0307272702|3.0|Good book to read, thought it was a bit slow in the beginning but picked up later.  Disappointed in the end though (appendix)when he said that all fats and oils are allowed, I would not cook in anything else than saturated fats since it has a high smoke point.  Maybe I missed it but could not read that he recommended the healthier grass fed animal meats from animals that are well treated in all aspects, bacon... I only know that salty \\"processed\\" one from the supermarket.  Sensible alternative sweeteners like Sucralose & Aspartame, I thought these were very toxic and also increase insulin?  Up to 3 cups of coffee with artificial sweetener is allowed/day.......  Overall it is a good book but can not give this one a 5 star, maybe his other book:Good Calorie, Bad calorie which I started recently will score higher?

1933492910|5.0|I am already a huge Terryl Whitlatch fan as a result of the Katurran Odyssey, so when I heard about this book I didn't think twice or even look at a preview before ordering it. When I finally got it in the mail my jaw literally fell open as I proceeded to thumb through this art book for nearly two hours. Terryl Whitlatch has an astounding knowledge of animal anatomy and it is wonderful to see the breadth of her abilities as a result of years of anatomy study. She showcases everything from sketches and scientific studies of animals to painting demos to creature design to illustrative alien characters. Just looking through her work I was inspired to grab the nearest sketchbook and get busy. Even if you are not an artist, if you simply enjoy looking at brilliant creativity this book is for you.

0307454541|4.0|This book started very slowly.  Wouldn't have finished it except that I was reading it for a book club.  However, I am SO GLAD I did.  It really picked up after the first 100 pages and was a fantastic book.  Stick with it....you will be rewarded.
0345529057|5.0|If you are watching \\"Game of Thrones\\" it is essential to read the book(s).  Yup!  Four with the fifth about to be released.  Since the books follow the story lines via various main characters, it is necessary to read the book to get the level of detail necessary to best understand the story.  How do the characters relate to the overall story lines?  How do the various story lines relate?    Oh, and its a great read.

014241543X|2.0|SPOILERS POSSIBLE<br /><br />\\"If I Stay\\" by Gayle Forman is about a girl who is in an accident with her family. She's in a limbo, almost, where she's outside of her body and she has to decide if she's going to leave and die or stay with her body and live on even though nothing is the same anymore. It has what's current woven with flashbacks to complete the story.<br /><br />Here's the thing: I didn't love it and I didn't hate it. I just... that's it. I don't like it, I don't dislike it, I'm just... in between about it. I feel nothing towards it. Nothing. Feeling nothing is not a good thing. You should feel something, be able to feel something to a book. No matter if it's love or hate. You still feel something. This was the first time I've felt nothing.<br /><br />I think part of the reason why I felt nothing was because I didn't care about anything. There wasn't any real plot, any real struggle, or any real antagonist in here. It was just Mia determining if she wanted to stay or leave. And there wasn't any real struggle about that either.<br /><br />The characters were one dimensional at best and there's no connection to them because of that. I feel I'm supposed to cry or something when everything happens, but I don't. I mean, her family is dead and she realizes all of this and nothing. Mia doesn't even cry! How in the world am I supposed to feel anything when SHE doesn't feel anything?<br /><br />Though I did enjoy what Adam, her boyfriend, said to her. I thought it was nice. But the same time, Mia already made her decision and she knew she didn't want to see him because she would change everything and she didn't want to. She wanted to stick to her decision. Yet... she listens to him and ignores her previous decision and does what he wants.<br /><br />Not only that, but earlier on, she mentions to her friend that she doesn't want to be one of those girlfriends who make every decision based on their boyfriends, one of those girls who have to live on what they say. Yet... she does. Literally. She had her decision already made, yet she listens to Adam and does what he wants her to do. I think that was a bit out of character. Well, for a flat character that didn't have much of anything.<br /><br />Also, I noticed that the second book mentions about how Mia makes a decision to avoid Adam, that because she lives, she doesn't see Adam. Like it was some balanced out sort of thing, but I didn't see that here. I don't see where she had to say \\"oh, I'll stay but I'm breaking up with you because of that\\", which is what it alluded to in the second book.<br /><br />I almost got this book from amazon but decided against it and purchased another book instead. Even more since I was able to check this out from the library. I think if I did purchase this book, I wouldn't enjoy it at all. I would almost hate it because I spent money on something that I feel nothing for. But as it is, I feel nothing. No hate, no love, nothing.<br /><br />Would I recommend this book? Not likely. Would I read the second book? Not likely. I feel nothing for this book, why would I invest in it again? After this book, I don't think I'll read anything by Gayle again. I just don't feel anything towards the book and I don't like that. I like feeling something for it, towards it. Because I don't feel anything, I'm giving this a two star review. If it had some sort of emotion in it, I would have given it a bit more.already made, yet she listens to Adam and does what he wants her to do. I think that was a bit out of character.

0316010669|5.0|Gladwell introduces the reader to the concept of \\"thin slicing\\", which is our intuitive responses to a situation are often correct.  This is interesting as we were raised to believe that our snap judgments are often misled.  Gladwell, who is a journalist for the \\"The New Yorker\\", uses his journalistic skills to organize this book which highlights cases of research studies, discussions, interviews, and real world examples about the concept of thin slicing.  His journalistic writing style allows the book to be a quick read, and Gladwell does not drown the reader in scientific mumbo jumbo.  Gladwell provides solid evidence that our intuitions are often correct, however these intuitions may mislead us due to our inner prejudice.  In order to fully grasp the power of thin slicing we have to calm our inner prejudice.  \\"Blink\\" is a quick read that informs the reader of a concept that we use on an everyday basis, yet we are not conscious of it.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|I'm not one of those who demands the original theatrical versions, but what I do demand is state of the art transfers, and I'm hearing that 2004 technology transfers are only a half step up from upconverting the standard DVDs. In other words, if you're expecting the mind blowing digital resolution in many of today's fine Blu-Ray releases, you can forget it with this version of Star Wars. (One of the things that won me over to Blu-Ray was watching Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean at the local Wal*Marts. Not that the movies themselves were good -- the transfers were great.)<br /><br />I'm canceling my pre-order until I see reviews on the transfer quality. I suggest that everyone else do likewise.
159420229X|5.0|I loved this book.  I could reread it 3 times at least.  The best parts of the book are its historical analyses of memory, culture and learning.   Also, Foer's writing is wonderfully fresh and lucid.
B002VQ7PVS|3.0|William Boyd was recently recommended to me. *Restless* was the only available audio book I could locate and it was a good introduction.<br /><br />While I will not reiterate the storyline and spoil it for those who've not yet read (reviewers, why do you do that?), I liked the different slant Mr Boyd presented on the usual British WWII spy thriller. The woman's perspective was particularly interesting - especially in contrast to her 1970s daughter's. There was nothing huge that I didn't like about this book, other than characters becoming too *talky* from time to time. But one can just fast forward or - as we do in our own lives - just stop listening. Overall, I liked his writing style and that his characters were not the super hero types so often presented in thrillers. Mr Boyd, I'll be back. DD@Phila
B004XWMXX8|4.0|I really enjoy Selena's new album. I didn't think I would like this album much, because I didn't like her last one much. This album really surprises me. I think this kind of music fits her voice perfectly. She has matured her sound on this album. I say Selena fan, or not get this album, because you can dance all night to this album. Selena is a great role model. I hope she does music as her career for many years to come, because I personally think she's great at it. I like the direction she is going musically, because is suits her. The stand out songs on this album are:<br />1. Who Says ( Of course this song is amazing, and an inspiration to me, keep up the great work Selena! )<br />2.  Outlaw ( She co wrote this song, how amazing, I just love it! )<br />3. Love You Like A Love Song<br />4. Bang Bang Bang
B001DF68MA|4.0|Wow, my son loves this thing! Its a wonderful item, if you need something affordable-but not super secure. My concerns are: the 3-point harness straps, always fall off his shoulders it needs an extra clip in the front (like a car seat). Luckily he's never fallen out of the seat and we've never crashed. I've modified it so that the straps don't slip off. Yes, you will have to ride a bit awkwardly, but its not a big issue. As for hills, I've climbed them and even stood up briefly to get the extra push needed-not recommended for an inexperienced rider. He loves when we fly down hills, but its something I avoid when possible. Otherwise for the time being, we love this item.
B004XWMXX8|5.0|In this album she is transitioning well from her first album. The songs are catchy and amazing i have it on repeat =] I'm so glad I Pre-Ordered super excited!!!!!

Because you can't not like this movie!
B0050CQY1W|5.0|Of all the Beyonce cd's, this one has the best collection of Music.  The music, the lyrics.  It has a great summer, breezy feel to it.  The biggest difference between this album, and her others....there are not tracks specifically designed for the radio (I say this as a positive).
B000002BYD|3.0|The first 6 songs are really great and then we have average and bad songs. Personally i like very much Pearl Jam in their previous albums and the half of this album. If you are a huge fan then definitely buy this album , if you are new iots better to start with their first albums and you can decide later about this one. So consider buying Ten - No code - Vs - Vitalogy.

B0056BMK6K|4.0|Chances are you know everything John Locke is going to tell you in this book, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Great reminder of how best practices in any small business apply to successful self-publishing.    As a first-timer in the self-publishing world (though I was a successful journalist and newspaper publisher for 11 years), I really enjoyed the author's approach to the business and marketing side of self-publishing. I was a little turned off by his down-playing of the importance of the technical side of writing and story-crafting, but it's what a lot of successful authors know, they just don't like to share it with the world. For that, he deserves some kudos.
B0050CQY1W|5.0|First off, a lot of Beyoncé fans are crying because she didn't make an album that sounded like previous songs of hers; \\"Single Ladies (Put a Ring On It)\\", \\"Deja Vu\\", or, even the leading single \\"Run the World (Girls)\\". It's not the album or it's songs that they're reviewing, it's the simple fact that she didn't stick to the mold their used to.    To the review...    \\"4\\" is an album for Beyoncé that will attract mostly her TRUE fans, and the R&B market a little more so than her previous efforts have. With help from the current single, Best Thing I Never Had, this album is more than likely crossover onto the Pop platform.    Anyways, \\"4\\" is a great album for an artist who has been in the industry for over a decade. This album contains mostly slow ballads (beautiful ballads) and a few mid-tempo tracks; Party, Countdown, End of Time, and the single, Run the World (Girls). People will mostly be intrigued by the lyrical content that has went into this album. Like, on Rather Die Young, she sings \\"You're my James Dean / You make me feel like I'm 17.\\" Or, on 1+1, she belts, \\"I don't know much about guns but I've been shot by you\\".    The lyrical content of \\"4\\" is one of the many reasons this makes for a great album. It's a very laid back album. An album heavily influenced by 90's R&B/Soul, with some hints of 70's disco, mixed with some modern day-sounding tracks.    By far, the best song on the album is End of Time. With it's live instruments over Beyoncé's vocals, it's masterpiece for the album! Other great tracks include Party, Rather Die Young, I Care, I Miss You, and Best Thing I Never Had.

The  fact  is  that,  the  very  best  part  of  this  film,  and  the  reason  it  got  what  attention it  did  was  because  of  the  REAL ( not  simulated )  oral  sex  scene  in  which  Chole  very  clearly  swallowed  at  the  end.  This  is  the  only  thing  I  can  see that  would  get  it  any  attention  and  the  only  reason  I rated  it with a 3.    Steve Of Tenn.    .
0486650677|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever laid my hands on. Lanczos does a tremendous job of blending mathematics, physics, intuition and philosophy. It leaves the reader with a distinct satisfaction of having gained some insight into the beautiful connections between these realms. To top it off, he builds bridges across to relativity as well (albeit contrived at some points)!<br /><br />Analytical mechanicians, by their very nature, are a philosophical lot. Maybe its because they assume everything will fit perfectly in their models or maybe its an outgrowth of their expectation of a rational natural order, regardless, this is a book tailored to that sort of mind. Recent texts in analytical mechanics, although tremendously useful for their pedagogical value, are usually quite cut and dry. There have been, in the last few years, exceptions to this but many of these spend more time attacking fellow researchers/scientists and dissecting competing views in the theory (quite reminiscent of traditional philosophers!) rather than attempt to give meaning through discussion.<br /><br />Lanczos is a great antidote for this. This is really an exquisite work that anyone in analytical mechanics will readily appreciate. If you want to know how to do analytical mechanics, look elsewhere. If you want to know the soul of analytical mechanics, look nowhere else.<br /><br />It must be noted that since many aspects of analytical mechanics are \\"point of view\\" rather than fact, some preferences of Lanczos may not be the only view or even orthodox. An example of this would be contemporaneous variations (Lanczos does not accept). Even though they are controversial in some sense, they do provide elegant alternatives of the proofs of several basic results in Hamiltonian mechanics.

B0050CQY1W|4.0|Like many other people, I wasn't impressed by \\"Run The World(Girls)\\" or Beyonce's last two albums; \\"I Am...Sasha Fierece\\" and \\"B'Day\\". I did like select songs though. When the song; \\"End Of Time\\"(which is my favorite leaked out) and was said to be the supposed second single; I instantly fell in love with it and played it over and over. It is still my favorite song on the album. It is thoroughly enjoyable and fun to sing along with. When Beyonce performed this song on the 2011 BET Awards; it gave me hope that the song would be a possible single.<br /><br />Elsewhere on the album; I was instantly attracted to the song; \\"1+1\\" like everyone else after seeing her performing it on \\"American Idol\\". Unfortunately I got over it really quick and I usually skip it when I hear it now. The second track; \\"I Care\\" is another favorite and I love the vocal performance(by Beyonce) as well as the lyrics. \\"I Miss You\\" is another favorite of mine co-written by Frank Ocean. The song is really simple and it does give you a slight 80s feel. I could see it being a single but Beyonce's younger fans would just be confused(like they are now).<br /><br />\\"Best Thing I Never Had\\" is good and fun to sing along too. \\"Party\\" is good and definitely gives you that throwback 90s feel and recalls the days of groups like SWV. \\"Rather Die Young\\" is fun to sing as well. \\"Start Over\\" is good and I'm still learning the lyrics to that one.<br /><br />\\"Love On Top\\" is irresistible and everything you want in a fun, bright song like itself. It definitely reminds me of a Stevie Wonder esque type song. I would also add that \\"End Of Time\\" makes me think of Michael Jackson's \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\". \\"Countdown\\" is fun and does recall the former hits Beyonce has on her past albums. I also like the sample used.<br /><br />\\"I Was Here\\" was written by Diane Warren and its tolerable.<br /><br />Overall Beyonce really impressed me and I think she has succeeded \\"Dangerously In Love\\". I've been waiting for Beyonce to make an album like this ever since and I'm glad she has finally came around.<br /><br />*Highly Recommended Albumand I'm glad she has finally came around.     *Highly Recommended Album
0451208706|4.0|I just finished reading this book, my first by Ken Follet. It was, to be sure, a pretty exciting read but I just could not bring myself to give it the full 5 stars. If I could have given it 3 and a half stars I would have, but instead I settle for 4.    Many of the other reviews have already described the plot and events which took place in this book so I won't go down that road again. I will say, as someone who is very interested in this period in history, that I was completely absorbed by the way this book described the details of what life was like for people in various classes at this crucial time in world history. Follet does a great job of showing how Europe was not only a political powderkeg of the competing empires of Britain, France, Germany, Russia, Austria-Hungary, etc., but how it was also a social powderkeg with the competing goals of suffragettes, anarchists, communists, democrats, and the aristocracy. Reading about the interconnectivity all of these different elements as they simultaneously seemed to reach their breaking points in the summer of 1914 was fascinating and a great overview of how and why the First World War began.    That being said, there were some problems that I had with this book. Specifically, the portrayal of some of the characters. Follet seems, in my view, to have gone out of his way to try to make the reader feel sympathy for Feliks and Lydia. The problem is that Felix and Lydia are both extremely selfish, despicable, and inconsiderate characters. Feliks is someone who has repeatedly killed innocent people completely without remorse due to his uncanny ability to justify each of his murders, and planned murders, as an act of righteousness. The problem is that often times his sense of so-called righteousness is built upon nothing more than self preservation (i.e. not being captured).     Lydia is someone who seems to have absolutely no conscience or sense of right and wrong. She spent 18 years lying to her husband, without whom shewould not have the lavish social life which she so obviously treasures, about the fact that he is not even the real father of their child. Little white lies are one thing, but this is, in my opinion, one of the absolute worst things that a woman could do to a man. Is Lydia concerned that this could devastate her husband? No. She is only concerned about the social damage this would bring upon herself. Nice. Then, when Feliks comes to see her at Walden's house in London, she simply tells him where Prince Orlov, HER COUSIN, is staying even though: a)she knows that Felix is an anarchist, b)an attempt had been made on the Prince's life just the night before, and c)Felix had a deep wound on his hand and that the attacker from the night before was also wounded on his hand. Yet she believes his weak reasoning for wanting to know because she got all horny in his presence. Then having sex with Felix in her husbands own house knowing full well that immediately after that Felix would be off to kill her cousin. The only time she even showed even a hint of remorse and tried to do the right thing was when it became obvious to her that to not do so would mean the end of her privileged social life.    I found Lydia to be one of the most despicable characters I have read in quite some time. At least Felix was mostly honest about who he was and what he was doing. Lydia however continued to lie and maintain life shattering deceptions right up until the second that it could harm her personally. Her husband Walden was the hero of this story and a decent man, it's just a shame that so much of this book was spent trying to garner sympathy for his wife who continually spit in his face.

B00475AUWW|1.0|This book is a wast of money. Don't buy it. The author overly dramatizes art. He feels so much resistance in writing. Well, I guess I would too if I attempt to write a whole book about it. Ok taking aside that I don't agree with what he's saying, this book essentially doesn't contain enough intellectual content. When reading this book, I can feel the author trying very hard to put in as much text as he can into an already saturated topic. A real looser. I want my money back.

0811875040|3.0|I pre-ordered this book, excited just to see the recipe for the princess cake, which looks amazing. However, I started small and decided to take a jab at making the vanilla buttercream. As another person pointed out in the review, the directions were not clear at all. Referring to the sugar syrup temperature and when exactly to pour it into the mix. You can figure it out after re reading it a few times however the initial read-thru it leaves you thinking there is another syrup to be added besides the sugar one that it has you make. The editing could seriously improve. Its disappointing that those mistakes made it to the final print. Especially for such a highly anticipated book. If she does ever re-print it, it would at least be a courtesy to offer a discount to those who pre-purchased it. Anyways,...I won't give up on it yet, however I dont feel as confident as I'd hope I would as a result of some of these errors.

B004Q0SQ24|5.0|My 2-year old has fallen in love with Chuggington via the Disney Channel, and these have been a great addition to our large collection of Wooden Train set toys. They are fully compatible with all of our Thomas and Friends and Brio Sets (from my childhood) except for some of the smaller tunnels and bridges. The base and hack half of the toy is wooden construction, but the face details are done in plastic. So far after several months of extreme love and hard play from a 2-year old boy, there has been no signs of paint fading, rubbing off or damage to any of the plastic parts!    Just watch out, if your child is playing with these while watching Chuggington and Action Chugger comes on (the one that flies), I've witnessed these toys go flying across the living room like Action Chugger!

B002ZG983M|4.0|I have to be honest. Even though this was a great movie, I found myself really disliking kick-ass by the end. To me it was about a hapless, clueless super-hero wanabe, who only survives his reckless stupidity because of the people who should have been the center of the film. The kick-ass character was like Jar-Jar Binks in the Star Wars prequels. Who needs Jar-jar as the central character? Somehow it seems like this is really the story of hit-girl, who is the hero who must look to her fate alone, and kick-ass is the hapless chronicler. More hit-girl and big-daddy, less kick-ass. Demote kick-ass in your mind and you've got a truly kick-ass movie. It will be half the sequel, literally, the way it went down.

Sure it has some b-movie aspects and it's not quite a masterpiece, but overall this is an awesome and enjoyable movie.  You will not see what's coming!      Anyone can get on Amazon and criticize a film.  Very few actually make films.  Even fewer take chances and make something as strange and great as Splice.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Everything's working fine after the update.  Very enjoyable and the quality is great.  I would highly recommend this appfor anyone.
B0050CQY1W|5.0|Beyonce already has 16 Grammys and has sold 75 million albums as a solo artist with just 3 albums.  Beyonce is clearly the Queen of R&B/POP  However, this album just solidifes her reputation with a much more mature and grown up sound. YOU MUST BUY IT    BEST SONGS  Run the World  Countdown  I Was Here  I Care
B0050CQY1W|5.0|Beyoncé has outdone herself with this new album! \\"4\\" is her best since \\"B'Day\\"!    Best tracks are: \\"I Care\\", \\"I Miss You\\", \\"Party (feat. André 3000)\\", \\"Rather Die Young\\", \\"Countdown\\", \\"End of Time\\", and \\"Run the World (Girls)\\"!!!!!    This is yet another different-sounding album for King B!
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I am saddened to see that REAL fans of this series are being slapped in the face again on this BD release. Some decent prints of the original theatrical version that does not have some kind built in flaw would be nice. I don't care about the dulled down Sesame Street versions that Lucas concocted in the 90s claiming it was how the series was intended to be made. I got mad when the DVD set I bought did not in fact have real anamorphic widescreen for these movies. I see it merely as a vehicle to earn even more money by refusing to release the version that fans really want. Hoping they will also buy the good versions next time around. Well, I will not fall for it this time. They fooled me by not giving me real anamorphic widescreen for the DVD box I bought the last time around.    Leave the CGI versions for the little kids. The grown ups want the good versions where Han shoots first, the background is not plastered with slapstick animals and where Sebastian Shaw in 20 seconds portrays Anakin Skywalker better than Hayden Christensen ever did throughout 2 movies. Even Jake Lloyd would have been better.    Dear Mr. Lucas stop ruining my childhood memories and just release the good versions Star Wars. The ORIGINAL trilogy! I don't care about those silly little flicks you made after that, and no sane person likes your \\"retouched\\" version. Just take the original negatives. If you intend to do anything with computers, make sure it is just to remove any possible dust or scratches. Put this on Blueray. Use the original sound. Don't add any dinosaurs or light hearted characters like Jar Jar Binks. We have been waiting for some good versions for far too long. Stop the shenanigans and just release a good version on Blueray, you got so much money from me already that you don't need to fool me this time around too!    I'd also like to add that the artwork looks horrendous. Why oh why can't they use the good original artwork? I mean I'd still buy it if it had good versions of the original films, but the artwork from the late 70s and onwards was just so much better than this.
B004G5ZY7E|5.0|I could not put this book down, literally. Every time i did, i picked it back up EXCEPT at bedtime because a couple of times i was too scared. So i am a bit of a baby when it comes to serial killers going after good people, sue me. However, READ THIS BOOK, as it is so well written that after a few chapters i got passed my confusion with all the Norwegian names.<br /><br />Harry Hole is one of the best detectives i have read, ever, and is a hugely interesting character. He is intuitive, cerebral and uses needs all of that and his experience to hunt for one of the sickest serial killers ever, and the first one in Norway's history.<br /><br />And i cared about Harry, and all of the main characters so i could not put this book down as i said. One of the things that did get me interested in trying this book was the comparisons to the other top Scandinavian crime fiction writers such as Stieg Larson and Henning Mankell. The only thing Jo Nesbo has in common with them is that he IS Scandavian but his writing is different, brilliant and it stands alone. I have already dloaded some of the earlier Harry Hole editions. Loved this book.
B0051OZ564|2.0|I saw this in the movies. Unless that put real printed foldable money in the DVD case stay a way from this movie. Now to explain why. The reason with out spoling anything is tht there is way tooo much un-explained in this movie. What is missing is greater then a leap of faith that is explained in the end<br /><br />To know more I have to state SPOLIER ALERT information below you may not want to know before watching the movie. Ok that said lets get to the un-explained:<br /><br />1) The Dance the female lead in the movie does this dance that makes people just focus only on her they are aware of nothing going on around them. What is this dance we have no idea we never get to see anymore then her swaying back and forth for a few seconds.<br /><br />2) The fight scenes at first she is alone in them then in the second fight scene she is joined with others how is that are they danceing also are they aware of the fight scene?<br /><br />3) we have all watched movies where part of it takes place in a dream world but now we have a movie where the dream world has a dream world.<br /><br />4) The core story that started the movie what happen to it. It is never resolved.<br /><br />This is a movie for those that perfer not to look for a good story just flashy things going on on the screen with no meaning or reason. I have to say most of the fight scenes are great but you could get that in any video game cut scene. The 2 stars I gave it is only due to the great looking fight scenes. Other then that the movie is a waste to watch much less own.
B004HD61KE|1.0|You have GOT to be kidding me, Amazon!!!! How could you even agree to sell this Kindle book for more than the price of the hardback and mass market versions?!!!! If you're trying to ensure that the Nook takes the market from you, good work! You have insulted all of us who spent the money on your product! Keep this up and I can promise you quite a few of us will just chuck the Kindle in the bin and go back to buying the paper versions.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Out of all the Reacher books there has only been one I did not like.  I loved this one, it sucked me in and hooked me on the Reacher Series. Jack gets the job done.  \\"nuff said!\\"
B004EPYZUI|5.0|I wrote this review mainly in response to Sucker Punch's 22% positive rating on Rotten Tomatoes. In my honest opinion that number is quite simply ridiculous. Sucker Punch so far has been one of the greatest films of 2011.    Yes there are some scenes in this movie which some view as rip-offs of other films. Here is what I said about Hollywood in response, so what?  We live in a world where remakes come out every other week and their sequels made to 30 year old films that have no business being revisited. Sucker Punch did nothing wrong here, Sucker Punch saw great movies and said to itself what can I do better?     And there were plenty of things that Sucker Punch did that were better. Look at the scene that mirrors, Lord of the Rings. Now, Lord of the Rings is one of the most treasured franchises in all of cinema but its protagonists were incredibly annoying. Sucker Punch did something that J.R.R. Tolkien was afraid to do, introduced hot women the equation. Is that really so wrong?    There are other parts of this movie the mirror Kill Bill. But where Kill Bill faltered, Sucker Punch succeeded. There was only one good-looking girl in Kill Bill. Sucker Punch had several. Once again, this is much better.    Other critics have said this movie too closely resembles the videogame. My answer, no such thing. Videogames try and look real, movies John look real. If every review videogame said, this looks too real then no video games would sell. The double standard in Hollywood is ridiculous here.    What does it say about we as a nation when we cannot appreciate the true gems that Hollywood has put forth? Director Zack Snyder has made a masterpiece here and yet only 22% of all critics can appreciate. This is absurd.  I highly encourage you to check this movie out. You will not regret it. This movie does not set out forth to abolish laws set by its predecessors. It comes rather, to complete, and it does so quite well.    Sucker Punch had so far been the greatest movie of 2011, bar none. Everyone should take the opportunity to own this gem on Blu-ray or DVD.
B004WOS7LO|5.0|I waited until midnight to listen it for the first time. I am one of those crazy fans that prefered to wait for the high quality sound of the real thing. It was sheer torture to read everyone's reactions to the record while I waited for the debut date but it was well worth it. I listened with my ear buds on before going to sleep and I traveled to the end of the galaxy and back with this album. Magical, magnificent, satisfying are just a few adjectives. English is not my first language so I find a bit difficult to fully describe my feelings towards this masterpiece.<br />Yes, masterpieces cannot be rushed and I am so so happy David Cook took the time to do it right. Radio waves these days are full of crappy lyrics, awful auto-tuned voices but David Cook came to the rescue. This is the best album I've listened to in decades. I really miss the power voices of the 80s and I think that's one of the million reasons I truly enjoy David's voice. I just hope the world gives him a chance to shine.
B004EC5IV6|5.0|This anime is well crafted. It is a quality evolution of an already superior form of philosophical media. To call it entertainment would be to sully its greatness. It is magic and transformation. Thank you, to all of those who helped make evangelion and what it is today.
B003F3NE1Q|5.0|The best season yet! Its always easier to buy from amazon because you will pay a fraction of the price from a retailer.
B000UAFDP2|1.0|The package arrived on time as do most of the movies from Amazon. However when I with great anticipation put the film in my blue ray DVD it stayed on 0000 and the screen was BLANK!!!!! I tried every thing I could with the machine hoping it was a machine malfunction, it was not. The disc was either blank to start with or damaged to start with and when dubed did not take. Either way I do not have a way to view this film in blue ray.
B00008G9JM|5.0|This is not really a rock album. It has nothing but great catchy and everevolving music on it produced with a fixed/limited set of instruments and great poetry skillfully laid on top. At times it seems to be making fun of rock conventions by spilling melodies where the guitar or organ solos are expected to be. In all honesty I can say that this album has everything I ever needed from Jethro Tull (and art-rock in general) and not a single thing that I don't like about them. The writing, playing and production are just too good, too clever without even a hint of pretentiousness to my ears. I discovered Passion Play very early on, so naturally I compared absolutely everything to it. If you want to have just one album by Jethro Tull with only two songs on it - I want you to choose A Passion Play.
B004SBX112|3.0|So I finally updated the ad-free version and I'm happily playing. All of a sudden, a few levels through a screen pops up and says &quot;next level available in 2 hours, 29 mins&quot; -- WTH?! Why is there a limitation to play the next level? I never saw this before... I'm kind of sad to see this come from Rovio.
B000A5044C|4.0|I will be honest, I gave this zero stars on Netflix right after I watched it, I was so depressed. But it's been about a week and the movie has really stayed with me. I won't go into a ton of detail on the storyline because lots of reviewers have done that. But there is a lot to say about Nobody Knows, and I'll limit my comments to a few.<br /><br />First of all, if you like happy movies and can't stand depressing, sobering ones, this is NOT for you. Trust me.<br /><br />Second, it was so well done. The kids in it really shined, they were such good actors, it was like watching a documentary. It was believable, raw and it really pulled out emotions, whether it was a scene about simple pleasures in life (and I mean simple), worrying about finances as a child, wondering what your mother is up to and hoping she's coming back..and on and on.<br /><br />Lastly, I have since gone back and am going to watch other movies similar to this one. While I was ridiculously bummed at the end (hoping I'm a good mom, putting my kids first all of my life, having survived a rough childhood) I have come full-circle and realized that this is a really, really good movie. It's worth your time. Yes, it's foreign but don't let that stop you.  If you love foreign films and realistic views on abandonment, coming of age too early, man..this is going to be your new favorite movie.
B003V6L94Q|4.0|I bought this CD for my husband for Father's Day and was very surprised to find that there are swear words in several of the songs.  (The 1st track has one and the 6th track has so many my husband won't even listen to it) The music is good but the swear words are unnecessary.  I wish I knew before I bought it....
B000HC2LI0|5.0|care of Amazon.com     To whom it may concern:  It is my understanding that the closed caption setting has to be   turn on for each dvd and is avalable througth audio setting of the   dvd it self some times there not always turned on hope this has been   some help to you at Amazon and am very happy customer with service go luck.
B000024D4R|5.0|I recently upgraded my car stereo and wanted a CD with great sound to jam out to. this was it. yay me.
B0000025T6|4.0|This album is for true fans only...It was recorded basically in a farm house with an acoustic guitar and a 4-track cassette recorder but the quality of lyrics are SO Springsteen; so stark and simple yet the complexity of the story-telling is truly Springsteen.  From the title song \\"Nebraska\\" to the beautiful \\"Mansion on a Hill\\"  each song tells a story in only Springsteen's style.  \\"Johnny 99\\" is haunting tale of desperation and every man's thoughts and fears.  \\"My Father's House\\"  is a lonely tale weaved between thorns and lonliness. \\"State Trooper\\" and \\"Highway Patrolman\\" obviously bring thoughts of Springsteen's anguish in his past to song.  But in the end, Springsteen does bring a ray of hope through \\"Reason to Believe.\\"   I love this album - it forces you to be introspective in a high quality, Springsteen kind of way.
160059672X|5.0|Is there really anything to say about Sherry Serafini that we don't already know. She is the best in bead embroidery and this book is just another masterpiece of hers. Great pictures and tips. This is a collector's item. Highly recommended.
1400079144|1.0|Dan Brown's Robert Langdon novels basically hinge on the idea that every smart person from antiquity up until the 20th century were members of a clandestine society of the super-smart who have all kinds of super-secret knowledge and hid that knowledge somewhere clever because the world wasn't ready for this knowledge to be disseminated and the only way to find it is to run all over town looking at works of art. Interestingly, because Robert Langdon is a very smart symbologist (Harvard fought hard to get this guy for its no-existent \\"symbology department\\"), contemporary crimes can be solved by running all over town looking at those same works of art. It should be noted that the villains are generally part of another, evil, clandestine society.    If you're looking for mindless running around interrupted periodically with long lectures by the protagonist about the merits of Free Masonry--It's about knowledge, man! They aren't trying to take over the world!!--then this book is for you.     The problem is that the book ends exactly where you think it will after the first chapter, and the pay-off is absolutely ridiculous. Unlike The Da Vinci Code, which follows a similar pattern but adds some interesting notions about the historical Christ that got conservatives' collective panties in a bunch, The Lost Symbol provides no interesting take on Free Masonry. Instead it reads like a long sales pitch for its awesomeness.     While the novel does have its characteristic puzzles that seem well connected to the real works of art that they are supposed to be connected to, the idea that somehow deciphering this crap is going to help catch the criminal is just short of ridiculous. Why would any criminal who is looking to make some grandiose statement to the world choose to do so through a series of events so esoteric that only the \\"brilliant symbologist\\" Robert Langdon can figure out what the hell is going on? It makes no sense whatsoever.     And in the end, all is well because Robert Langdon can look at some triangle and know that they really meant it as a vagina and therefore he must be a the Lincoln Memorial or something. Gotcha Fiend!!!     So, I guess, you should buy this book if you like that kind of crap.
1936719118|5.0|This is a short, well-written, thought-provoking, deep, entertaining and useful book. Ostensibly a set of stories about Derek Sivers's journey building and selling CD Baby, it's actually a philosophy (but not a dogma) and an illustration of how being an entrepreneur is entirely compatible with leading a life well lived. A brilliant book, well worth reading.
B00007G207|5.0|Always one of my favorite films, the director's restored scenes now reveal a few \\"unexplained\\" situations in the original.  Almost 3 hours long now, but every moment is a treasure of cinematic beauty.  Worth having!  Both versions are on the disc.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|Hello Mr. Locke,    While the rest of the writing world is largely exclusive, you, John Locke, exemplify what it means to be inclusive. Thank you for writing this book, for encouraging writers, for sharing your system with those aspiring authors, and for being you--a generous, caring, successful entrepreneurial writer. You're not required to help anyone else, but here you are laying it all out for all authors who have dreams to see their work see the light of day and be embraced in a way that makes the reading world brighter and kinder. Thank you for that generosity. Please count me among your OOUs.    If you're a self-published author or thinking about self-publishing your novel, this is the book you should buy. Now. Right now. Buy it. Read it. Do what it says.
B0057XSCJG|5.0|I just watched this movie for the second time and I have to say I was very pleased with it the modern day fairytale was truly breathtaking.   Vanessa Anne Hudgens and Alex Pettyfer are brilliant and electric as a couple I was blown away by the beauty and grace of the film the two young actors   proved to us all that \\"Love Is Never Ugly\\" it was so good that I almost cried at the end   all I have to say is it was \\"So Damn Beautiful\\" and I am positive I will watch it again and again.
0345529057|1.0|Everything is in the title.     I would have gladly bought this if the price was right. And the right price, all studies say, is about half of the paper edition. At that price, editors still make 50% better margin than with the paper edition.     But what we see here is insulting. The editors tries to steal customers. Customers will steal back.    Considering that greed is the main driving factor behind this editor, I will NOT buy the book. Not in Kindle edition, not even in paper edition.
0374290024|5.0|Ian Morris set himself an ambitious goal for this book: explain the last 14,000 years of world history. As Morris himself admits, there's a lot of what he calls chainsaw art in this undertaking the further back you go, but the broad outlines become somewhat clear with Morris' deft handling of evidence from archaeology, geography, history, sociology, and other fields. If you buy into his assumptions, then it's a satisfying work that ties in many seemingly disparate trends. I imagine, however, that adherents of various religions, especially the three big monotheistic ones, would have radically different interpretations of how and why history unfolded as it did. But so much the better. Variety is the spice of life, and Morris' spice will add some nice flavor to some people's intellectual palate. It comes with an outstanding bibliography and notes so one can pursue the many different directions covered in more depth if desired. If there's one thing I didn't care for it was Morris' refrain that each generation gets the thought or ideas it needs. Such a \\"just so\\" interpretation is without empirical evidence until after the fact and has no predictive capacity (you can't say what ideas future generations will need; you only know what they needed by looking back and saying, \\"Aha! So that's what they needed!\\"). But this hardly detracts from the larger argument. I also found the writing to be very felicitous and accessible and appreciated the humor. All in all, an excellent work. Highly recommended.
0525422943|5.0|This was the perfect sequel to If I Stay. I like how real the characters seem even when their lives take them in extraordinary directions. Very well written ending to an emotional plot, very satisfying.
B004F9OV5C|3.0|I think this book had a lot of promise, but thought the last few chapters were complete letdowns, hence my 3-star rating.    It starts with a a seemingly nice guy (Adam) who inadvertently gets caught up in a murder and has to hide out.  Behind the murder is a pharmaceutical scam, and those behind that see Adam as a convenient fall guy - but only if he can't talk.  Adam learns how to survive and become one of the many \\"invisible\\" people in London all the while being hunted down by a master-tracker.     Sounds suspenseful, and is, but I expected a flash-bang ending that never really happened.  It seemed as though Boyd brought the Pharma-scam to a crisis point and then couldn't figure out how to end the book so he ....just ended it, hanging threads and all.  Disappointing.
B004WPYNY8|2.0|Well, I was really looking forward to this release. I hate to say it, but I have to put myself in the camp of the unimpressed. This is just not a good collection of songs and the composition is simply uninspired. The instrumental performance is excellent, and the production sounds fantastic, but there's nothing really musically interesting going on here. Additionally, the concept is so utterly lame, that it brings everything down a notch. The lyrics are just so embarrassing and they are performed so ridiculously dramatic that it gets hard to listen to. For example:<br /><br />\\"I close my eyes, lost in a memory<br />Just like a candle in the wind<br />What could have been, with just one kiss goodbye<br />You spread your wings to fly\\"<br /><br />Really guys? This is sub-par for a second rate pop band and just completely inexcusable for a top progressive metal band.<br /><br />So I give it two stars for the rock solid performance and the great production, but Symphony X have taken a holiday from writing good prog metal on this release.
B0041KKYEM|1.0|This was the worst movie I have ever seen. Not really worth the review except to express my disgust for the movie! I love Natalie Portman, but I couldn't wait until this movie ended! It was gross at parts, sick, twisted, confusing, and boring! If you want a good movie go see something that will make you smile like Burlesque! Now that movie was worth every penny!
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|After updating now picnics wont open at all. it simply kicks me out. Im disappointed and hope they correct soon
0470901071|5.0|Exciting! That's one of the words I would use to describe reading the new 7th. edition Study Guide. Here's another- clarity. Todd is flat out the best, not even debatable, at taking confusing concepts and explaining them in a way that is easy to understand but also helps the reader build a solid \\"foundation\\".     I have read some other CCNA guides and they fell into 1 of 2 categories. They were either way too technical for a CCNA level candidate, (not to mention boring!)or they covered everything at a \\"high concept' level without actually teaching me any solid fundamentals. You don't have to worry about either result with Todd's 7th edition. Todd preaches throughout the book that you can't \\"memorize\\" an answer and pass the certification test. You have to build the skills that are tested. You have to be willing to work extremely hard and apply yourself to studying the material. and then (shock!), actually understand what you are doing when you do them!     I've never written a review for a book in the past, but this book is so powerful, so good, I felt i had to let others trying to get certified know what I thought and how much i feel I've learned from it. Getting certified is tough with the new exam(s), and we need to get the word out when something comes along that can really make a difference in our chances of passing.    And make no mistake- the concept is very clear throughout the book that if you want to pass the CCNA, you are going to have to make a commitment to studying the material. I feel that with this book, and a sim I purchased, I have everything I need. The labs that challenged in the beginning are a piece of cake after a few times through the book. I'm really just amped in general about how much the book has taught me.    Todd teaches throughout the book with humor and you actually feel like you are having a conversation with him in person as you read,  and take the numerous (and I do mean numerous!)written tests, reviews, practice labs ( oh yeah flashcards on the cd!) that are designed to build skills in a logical order. And the killer thing is it isn't boring to me to read and reread the material. Guess because Todd makes it so interesting? Who knows, all I can say is I have learned more and enjoyed this book more then anything else I've read in the tech field.    Each concept seems to build upon the last, until in very short order I was surprised with how much I'd learned, but also how comfortable I had become with routing and switching (my background is sys admin- network engineering was always for those guys who talked funny- now i am becoming one-thanks Todd!)    I just can't stress enough how awesome this book is - and how much I enjoyed it, and continue to enjoy it the 4th 5th time through it. Todd is a genius at making everything understandable, I mean every exam objective is covered at the necessary detail level, using a dynamic and funny narrative.     I plan on taking the CCNA later this week or next week at the latest. And I have no doubt that this book is a big part of the reason I feel confident that I'll pass. My biggest concern is what the heck am I going to read for fun once I'm certified?? haha.  Regards, and good luck to any pursuing their CCNA   John
0316056863|5.0|Tina Fey is hysterical and this book is no different. It reads as if she were standing right in front of you. Great beach read. Recommend to anyone who's remotely thinking of getting it.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|Let me start by saying I am the audience for this book. I am a self-pubbed author. I am looking to increase sales and build a following.    I loved this book. Some things I was already doing, others not so much. John puts everything togeher in a common sense way that I really enjoyed. Some may say 'I already do that, this is worthless.' That's fine. But the truth is, this guy sold a million books. Truth is, if he told me to dress like a kangaroo and give out free carwashes, I'd at least consider it.     I am going to put some effort into a) writing more books b) finding my niche and c) using the system. I may revise my review at that time, but for now, it's a win.
B003VS0CWO|5.0|Based on a stage play, THE ROCKY HORROR SHOW, still occasionally revived in London and New York, THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW now holds the all-time record for theatrical release---35 years! A flop in general release, ROCKY was saved by a bunch of intrepid New Yorkers who convinced the Waverly Theater, of blessed memory, to run it as \\"the midnight double feature picture show\\" in 1977.<br /><br />Not long after ROCKY was rescued, it became an audience participation film. How, why or when is lost to me, but audiences were soon shouting scat dialogue back at the screen, as in:<br /><br />\\"I really admire the way you beat the other girls---\\"<br /><br />AUDIENCE: ---With a whip!---<br /><br />\\"---to the bride's bouquet.\\"<br /><br />Scenes became cues for audience actions. A rainstorm onscreen led to the firing of water guns. A mention of prunes meant that the eponymous fruit was thrown at the screen; and so on.<br /><br />The Waverly was a mess afterward, but the cleanup was worth the gate receipts.<br /><br />Other area theaters, mostly grindhouses, soon picked up on this practice, and kept themselves in clover showing ROCKY at midnight along with such forgotten classics as PELVIS and THE CARS THAT EAT PEOPLE, or occasionally, on a holiday weekend, THE GRATEFUL DEAD MOVIE. That was a classic double bill!<br /><br />Eventually, this phenomenon spread across the country and now overseas.<br /><br />I can remember being seventeen and standing night after night, hands in pockets and breath fogging the frigid air, in line with hundreds of other dedicated nutcases waiting for the Mini-Cinema in Uniondale, New York to open its doors for the midnight show during the freezing winter of 1977-1978 just so we could see this unique and bizarre film for three bucks a viewing. (A friend just wrote to tell me that the Mini-Cinema is now a church. Oh, the grand irony of it!)<br /><br />Bottles of cheap wine and rotgut and other oddities were passed freely up and down the line along with various smoking mixtures that were imbibed, ingested and inhaled as need be, partly to get in the mood and partly, simply, to keep warm as the temperature thudded down to around zero. Sometimes it snowed. It sleeted. Who cared? We were engaging in a tribal rite.<br /><br />Occasionally, someone overdid it and barfed prodigiously, to the disgust and amusement of the rest of us.<br /><br />My first ROCKY (aka \\"losing my virginity\\") occurred the same night as April's 100th viewing, and so the audience of regulars was in full war cry, dressed (or downdressed) to the nines. Having been brought along by a friend who had not forewarned me, I soon found myself in a heaving mass of humanity, men dressed as women, women dressed as men, and a few souls, God knows what, dressed as God knows what. The regulars would burst into song, and occasionally, the line contracted obscenely upon itself. \\"What is it?\\" I yelped.<br /><br />\\"It's the pelvic thrust...\\" somebody, dressed as a DuMont television set, told me.<br /><br />\\"That really drives you insane...\\" a fright-wigged boy wearing cat's-eye sunglasses added.<br /><br />\\"Let's do The Time Warp Again!\\" everybody shrieked.<br /><br />My friend said, \\"You'll get it.\\"<br /><br />And get it I did as I became a ROCKY regular, topping out at (thus far) 129 viewings. At age 50, I'm still keeping count. Not as many as many, and I never dressed the part, but it was worth the cold nights and the occasional overindulgences. That was the winter I got pneumonia. Of course, I also weighed 135 pounds soaking wet.<br /><br />I caught ROCKY on Syfy at Halloween, and enjoyed reminiscing, as they ran it fourteen times in twenty four hours (I watched it twice or maybe thrice that day). Something seemed to be missing, but I didn't know what. But the other day, an old ROCKY fanatic invited me over. We watched the \\"UK Version\\" and everything fell into place. Since my friend and I both now write for movies, TV and publication, we got into a discussionabout THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW that has led me to this review.<br /><br />After 35 years and a remake on TV's  GLEE, ROCKY isn't outre anymore or particularly shocking. But Rocky is definitely an acquired taste. The film is popular among young middle-class white kids primarily, because it allows them to vicariously experience a wildly nontraditional lifestyle. ROCKY is replete with transsexualism, transvestitism, pansexuality, bisexuality, homoeroticism, heteroeroticism, and almost every other form of sexual expression, almost perfectly geared for adolescents who are first discovering their primary gender and sexual identities.<br /><br />Leavening all this mix-and-match sexuality, ROCKY is framed in an amusing pastiche of genres: It heavily draws on James Whale's classic FRANKENSTEIN. It references memorable low-budget 1950s Drive-In Sci-Fi favorites like TARANTULA and DAY OF THE TRIFFIDS as well as classic Sci-Fi such as FORBIDDEN PLANET and KING KONG. It throws in an homage to Rock 'n' Roll, layering it with Burlesque Theater and Busby Berkeley's carefully choreographed water ballet musicals.<br /><br />ROCKY's own odd songs (including its signature song, \\"The Time Warp\\") run the gamut from the amusing (\\"Dammit, Janet\\") to the frankly sexual (\\"Toucha-Toucha-Toucha-Touch Me\\")  to the frenetic (\\"Hot Patootie! Bless My Soul\\") to the moving {\\"I'm Going Home\\") to the truly dark (\\"Superheroes\\").<br /><br />Almost everything in ROCKY is done to a fine turn and to excess: Crotch-grinding seduction is punctuated with a murderous ice hammer attack, and a formal dinner, singularly \\"lacking in bonhomie\\" is revealed to be a cannibal feast.<br /><br />Despite a dire introduction by a noted Criminologist (Charles Gray), ROCKY starts out brightly enough. Brad Majors (Barry Bostwick) and Janet Weiss (or, to the audience, \\"Vice!\\") (Susan Sarandon) have just gotten engaged and are off to share the good news with their friend, Dr. Everett Scott (Jonathan Adams). On the way to Dr. Scott's home they get a flat tire, and are forced to take shelter in a nearby castle, where they are greeted by Riff Raff the butler (Richard O'Brien) and Magenta the Maid (Patricia Quinn), who take their wet things (leaving them standing uncomfortably in their underwear).<br /><br />They are shocked when a roomful of weirdly dressed people begin doing \\"The Time Warp.\\"<br /><br />At that moment, they are introduced to the flamboyantly cross-dressing master of the house, Dr. Frank-N-Furter (Tim Curry) who explains to them in lascivious song that he's \\"a sweet transvestite from Transsexual Transylvania.\\" After inviting them, \\"up to the lab to see what's on the slab,\\" he explains that he has just created a muscular male love slave, Rocky Horror (Peter Hinwood), whom he then animates, and takes off to a specially prepared \\"bridal suite.\\"<br /><br />Rocky is not Frank-N-Furter's only conquest that night. Despite their clean-cut rather uptight ways, both Brad and Janet fall easy prey to Frank's sexual blandishments. As the evening progresses, we discover that the good doctor is a complete hedonist, dedicated to giving himself \\"over to absolute pleasure.\\" His seductions include the rock `n' roll biker Eddie (Meat Loaf), Columbia, a house servant (Little Nell Campbell), and others. And although he is just entertaining himself with Brad and Janet, both of whose virginity amuses him, things take a much darker turn when Dr. Scott arrives at the castle looking for his nephew, the missing Eddie. Dr. Scott (aka Dr. Von Scott) is revealed as a former Nazi scientist working for \\"our side,\\" who knows the truth about Frank-N-Furter's origins on the PLANET Transsexual in the GALAXY of Transylvania. But even Dr. Scott surrenders to his own fleshly impulses. And so it is left to Riff Raff and Magenta (who are revealed to be Frank-N-Furter's alien companions) to stage a coup---\\"Your lifestyle's too extreme!\\"---and return to their home planet, leaving the Earthlings dazed and irredeemably corrupted.<br /><br />Despite its seeming idolatry to excess, there is logic to the movie. ROCKY is a cautionary tale. It is instructive that the only two people not destroyed (physically or spiritually) by Frank-N-Furter are Riff Raff and Magenta, who, though they have served him, have never been seduced by him. And it is also important to note that despite everyone's protestations of innocence, not one human being seduced by Frank-N-Furter was forced into anything. They have all been willing participants in their own undoing, even though like Brad and Rocky Horror himself, they may be completely unequal to accepting that responsibility. Like addicts, they have numerous opportunities to reject what they are being offered and to turn from the path of ruin that lies before them, but not one of them does.<br /><br />This lesson is driven home in the show's final song, \\"Superheroes,\\" though many younger American ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW fans may have missed this song, as it appears only in the \\"UK Version.\\" Some years ago, \\"Superheroes\\" was cut from the \\"US Version\\" as being \\"too depressing.\\" I remembered it from my early viewings and missed it without knowing what I was missing. Its exclusion is an unfortunate mistake, even if most of the film's younger audience overlooks the point:<br /><br />I've done a lot; God knows I've tried to find the truth. I've even lied.<br />But all I know is down inside I'm bleeding...<br />And super heroes come to feast, to taste the flesh not yet deceased.<br />And all I know ... is still the beast is feeding...<br />And crawling on the planet's face, some insects called the human race...<br />Lost in time and lost in space<br />And meaning.<br /><br />For a film that \\"failed\\" ROCKY's cast is singularly impressive. The well-known Susan Sarandon is cast opposite Barry Bostwick and Tim Curry, both veterans of many movie and stage roles. Richard O'Brien, the show's creator, still works in the London theatre, and Patricia Quinn, Lady Stephens, is a well-respected Barrister. Both Jonathan Adams and Charles Gray had long acting careers prior to their deaths. Peter Hinwood now deals in antiques, while Little Nell Campbell teaches music and dance. Meat Loaf is still a musical celebrity.<br /><br />The many DVD extras give us disturbing confirmation that ROCKY has become institutionalized. A \\"Rocky-oke\\" sing along segment and a \\"cued\\" version of the film (\\"Now throw playing cards\\") indicate that the spontaneity that created this one-of-a-kind audience participation experience has been ossified by the studio into regimentation. I would much rather my ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW inheritors discover this film the way it is meant to be discovered, in company with their peers.

0765348276|4.0|This is a 2004 sci-fi book that I'm reviewing because I think it's important to sci-fi fans. Once you read this book, you will immediately want to read the next three in this John Scalzi series. It reminds me of the Mars series written by John Varley.<br /><br />Can you imagine yourself at 75 years old joining the Army? Can you imagine the consciousness of your brain being transferred to a brain in a young green body? Now you are a member of Colonial Defense Force (CDF). You now have Smartblood, a brainpal computer in your head, and a ten year hitch. But you are not on Earth, you are fighting aliens in a faraway galaxy. If somehow you survive the ten years, you will be transferred out of the green body into a normal body and be given property on a alien planet that you helped colonize! Wow! I have to give John Scalzi credit for making everything in this book so easy to understand, unlike author Vernor Vinge.<br /><br />The main character in this book is John Perry, who meets and fights many aliens, including the superior Consu race. We also meet his dead wife, Kathy. Kathy died before she could enlist, but returns as Jane Sagan, as a member of the Ghost Brigades. The confrontation between them is comical, since she doesn't know who John Perry is.<br /><br />In this book, you will learn about skip drive, the old farts, the Rraeys', and CDF colonies. This is where I will stop. I'm not going to give the ending away, but it is good. You will be depressed that the book ended, but good news - there are three more books in this series waiting for you!
0756405890|5.0|Given the high number of reviews for this book, I don't believe I will say anything original here, but I wanted to at least express my fondness for it since it provided hours of entertainment. I start a lot of books. I finish very few. With so much out there, I don't want to waste my time with something that just isn't worth it. I read the favorable reviews for The Name of the Wind, so I decided to give it a chance. I started reading it, and liked it well enough, but I wouldn't say the first 100 pages or so I read was anything groundbreaking. However, I then downloaded the audiobook to listen to on my daily commute, and that is when the book really took off. The plot picked up and the narration was superb, probably the best I have heard. Pretty soon, I was listening to it outside of my car, which never happens with audiobooks.     The book isn't perfect. There are some slow parts and Kvothe does seem to be a little too talented at times, but he is a fantastic protagonist and someone that you really start to care for as the story progresses. I am three-fourths finished with the sequel now, and I cannot wait to get my hands on the final volume when it is released. I highly recommend this series to anyone, especially the audio version.
B0054JURZA|5.0|Definitely an evolving sound, but to me not so completely removed from before. Much like a more orchestrated \\"For Emma,\\" with a fuller/deeper sound stacking a wider mix of instruments/electronica/chords/harmonies on the same acoustic base. Different, but both sounds are deeply affecting! As in my review of \\"Emma,\\" I still think you will love all of Bon Iver, if the music of Sun Kil Moon/Mark Kozelek & Neil Young appeal to you.
0061784788|4.0|This is a Reading Good Books review.<br /><br />* In compliance with FTC guidelines, it should be noted that I received the book for free through Goodreads First Reads.<br /><br />I tried to beat the release date of this book but I could not finish on time.  But hey, better late than never, right?<br /><br />I am familiar with James Rollins' work by way of the novelization of the movie Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.  Later on, I came across his Sigma Force series.  When I received this book, I must say that I was concerned that I would not be able to grasp it very well because being the seventh in a series, it would be hard for me to catch up on character development; that the author would not put that much time in explaining who these characters are for the new reader.  Luckily, that was not much of an issue after all.<br /><br />The Devil Colony brings Director Painter Crowe and his team at Sigma Force to a race against time.  A series of nanobot caches threaten to explode and blow up the planet.  It takes them across the United States and even an adventure to Iceland.  It all begins with a discovery of a Native American gravesite containing gold plates with ancient script engraved on them.  Things become heated between the Native American groups and the National Guard and amidst that riot, the lead anthropologist of the dig dies suddenly, her body consumed by an unexplainable explosion.<br /><br />Not long after Sigma Force was called in to help, it becomes personal to Director Crowe.  His niece, Kai, is caught in the middle of it all, even being accused of masterminding the explosion.  Together with the rest of his team, Crowe will do anything to not only save his niece but prevent these explosions from destroying the world.<br /><br />This incorporated Native American history with the history of the Mormon faith (is it just me or did I read \\"JOHN Smith\\" somewhere in the book as supposed to \\"JOSEPH Smith\\"?) as well as nanotechnology.  All of it was pretty new to me so it was a lot to take in.  I appreciate all the explanations and the illustrations provided.  They were very clear and it really did help push the story forward.  Information-heavy as this book was, it was not boring at all.  I found myself getting more and more interested in the topics being talked about.  It was easy to understand.<br /><br />I also love all the action and adventure the characters went through.  I do not know how this compares to the other Sigma Force novels but this one was great.  A bit of Indiana Jones-like thing going on with Painter Crowe and his part of the story while Commander Grayson Pierce was on his own vigilante mission.<br /><br />As someone who is not familiar with these characters, I found them all engaging.  They worked well with each other, which was what I would expect with six books of development behind them.  At first, I was afraid that the author would just go into these characters without much introduction but Rollins gave hints of their backstories here and there.  Not a lot, but enough to for a new reader to get her feet wet.  My favorite was Kowalski.  I am sure he is a tough guy through and through but his lines are just hilarious.  Definitely the comic relief of the whole book!  His penchant for C4 explosives reminds me of one of my favorite Mythbusters quotes from Jamie Hyneman: \\"When in doubt, C4.\\"  I sympathized with Gray and the many problems he is facing on top of his already numerous responsibilities.  I am very curious about Seichan.  I was the most curious about her story and at the same time, confused by it.  Kat and Monk, they are so sweet.  Those two parts, I wished I read the other books so I would have a better grasp of their characters/relationships.<br /><br />I do enjoy these kinds of books, in general, even if I am not familiar with the history they are basing their story from.  Apart from not knowing the characters very well, I thought this was a solid and well thought out story.  This definitely made want to get the rest of the series and start from the top.  James Rollins, consider me a fan.<br /><br />Rating: 4/5.<br /><br />Recommendation: Fans of Steve Berry and Dan Brown would find something that they would like in this book.  If you are interested in technology and fictionalized history, especially Native American history, give this a try.  Although I might not recommend this being your first book to read out of the series.  As much information that the author gave about the characters, I was still pretty  much in the dark.from the top.  James Rollins, consider me a fan.    Rating: 4/5.

B0013IKUIK|5.0|You might just connect with this music if you share a love for the more acoustic sounds of Sun Kil Moon/Mark Kozelek & Neil Young. To my ears & spirit a quirky/beautiful alt folk-rock with a subtle, unexpected power.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I couldn't stop laughing, this book is so funny. I bought a couple additional copies for friends who really needed a good laugh. Tina Fey is one of a kind. Seriously one of the funniest books I've read in ages.
B0057AOOZ0|5.0|The album has an amazing balance of ballads, midtempos and uptempos. What is amazing they all have such a terrific energy to them. The songs really talk about the happiness and some of the parallels of love. It's done in both fun yet sophisticated way. The songs just really resonated with me. It's almost hard to even pick out what songs are my favorites because I will hear something I didn't pick up on and it'll make me like the song even more. Some of the standouts are End of Time, Start Over, Love On Top, Rather Die Young, 1+1, I Miss You and Countdown. Beyonce's voice is so lovely and powerful here. It's such a terrific album.
B0057UVLQ0|5.0|So Selena Gomez and the Scene's first album was awesome. All the songs had amazing lyrics to them with alot of depth. For their second album, Selena wanted it to have more of a dance feel to it, which it did, but alot of the songs lacked much meaning. Now, their third album combined the dance and techno songs from the second cd with the lyrics from the first to create an absolutley outstanding ablum! You can really tell Selena is maturing, but not to the point where she's losing her younger fans. Her audience is broadening. I love how she's not trying as hard as Miley Cyrus had to to get an older group of listeners, she's just making great songs! I'm very proud for Selena and the Scene for creating such an awesome album. Mission accomplished!
1439102724|1.0|I have read almost every Jodi Picoult book published. Although I do not always agree with or even like the endings, I enjoy her writing as it is easy to read and gives my brain a break from having to work too hard. The most recent novel, Sing You Home, is a far cry from her norm.<br />Besides the fact that there are gaping holes in the story big enough to jump through, you are given two very extreme sides to a hot topic: homosexual marriage and same-sex parenting. This story paints the anti-homosexual Christians as the oppressive right wing, narrow-minded, unsympathetic, and intolerant extremists while the homosexuals are portrayed as bullied, persecuted and loving heroes.<br />According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, the definition of Tolerance is sympathy or indulgence for beliefs or practices differing from or conflicting with one's own. Doesn't that mean that you have to be tolerant of me just as I am tolerant of you? Even if I believe that same sex marriage should not be legal? I am a Conservative, go to church every Sunday, am opposed to birth control and abortion and think sex outside of marriage is a sin. When was the last time someone celebrated my diversity?<br />I think this book was written hastily to satisfy an agenda since the story is so poorly developed. Unless you proudly fly your rainbow flag for the world to see, you will be better off skipping this book.
0307388921|5.0|For my money this book had it all and I really enjoyed it.  I rank this above Fight Club without hesitation.  If you like Chuck and don't have it, get it.
B000002AP1|5.0|If you want you rock as primal and raunchy as you can get it, then Raw Power just might be what you're after. Hell, you'd never know that Iggy's only 5'4\\" from listening to him sing.  On-line they state his height as 5'7\\" which is totally inaccurate, but whatever.  His has to be one the most masculine voices in all rock.  That is, next to the Lizard King, Jim Morrison. I have this on vinyl, and that's the version of choice in my opinion. In fact, I had to buy it as a British import because at the time The Stooges catalog was completely unavailable here in the States. And I'm not exaggerating when I say this album is a true classic, and like any other classic, it hasn't diminished one iota w/ time.<br /><br />The Stooges' line up on this album was a one-shot deal sadly. Guitarist James Williamson was the perfect match for Iggy, and his guitar is just as wild and out of control as the Igg himself. But rock and roll wasn't going to be a life time gig for Mr. Williamson who left the biz and acquired an engineering degree.<br /><br />Cranky people complain about Bowie's sub-par production on this album, but I like the subversive, recorded in a basement, feel of this album. The music feels underground and not quite normal.  That's Iggy too.  My friends and I played the hell out of this back in the late 70s. Just so you know - it took me a while to wise up - \\"Raw Power\\" is a metaphor for speed, and the music on this album is as intense as any speed freak or tweaker you've ever met. In fact, I'd recommend slapping Raw Power on (preferably @ high volume) if your parents are over and you want them to leave!
B0050XFY4O|4.0|Though very controversial, this story is very touching. Uncontrolled love in the hands of children \\"watching the world upside down,\\" as they say. The dialogues could be better developed and so could the characters, but not bad for a low-budget production. Worth watching.
1401207529|5.0|I love Frank Miller's work and this is no exception. Commissioner Gordon comes off real bad-ass. They should have called it Gordon and BatMan: Year One. I love some of the subtle way Miller shows Batman's relation with Harvey Dent without distracting too much this story about how Gordon and Batman's relationship evolved. I also liked how  Miller shows Bruce Wayne struggling to become Batman and realizing that he can't do it alone. I rarely read my comic again but I'm definitely picking this up again after I go through my comic queue.
0321647440|4.0|I downloaded Aperture 3 from Apple's App Store.  It came with only online training and few images.  This book and accompanying CD takes you through the steps of managing your photos.  I have Photoshop, Bridge and Photoshop Elements, but this is different entirely.  The exercises in the training not only guide users on how to use the program but also provides valuable information on photography, metadata, and image manipulation.<br /><br />On the downside, you have to get updated photos from the publisher's website.  It's a bit complex to get initially up and running in sync, but it is well worth it.<br /><br />In summary, this program downloaded for $79 plus $35 for the training beats the pants off $300 for Adobe Lightroom.
B000OPO6VU|4.0|This is a classic by the great Emerson Lake and Palmer.  Outstanding! A must to all rock music lovers and collectors.
B0050LJIRK|5.0|Many years ago I first was exposed to LB by a co-worker that was college educated, served in the military with high security clearance, and worked as a human resource manager for a healthcare company.  In short, he was not some sniveling 15 year old punk that was easily swayed toward antisocial behavior, as many have attempted to stereotype LB fans as being.  Neither was I, nor do I believe you can paint with such a broad brush the reasons LB resonates with certain people.    Fred is polarizing due to his public portrayal (and for that matter so is Wes) and vocals that you either \\"get\\" or not.  There seems to be little middle ground.  Love him or hate him, Fred gets attention.  Without Fred it would not be as fun.  And to speak truthfully, without ANY of the original members it would not be as fun.  They all are an odd concoction that normally does not work well together, but in the right mix it is enjoyably unique.    DJ Lethal is amazing because he (unlike many) seems to understand how to add to the sonic atmosphere instead of just dominating it.  The rhythm section of LB (Sam and John) is tight.  They drive the sound in an incredible and original way that gets people moving.  And without them Wes would not have a vehicle to do his thing.  And Wes, well . . . I have always been a guitar fan and he makes a statement with original sounds and riffs that blend in perfectly with the rhythm and song . . . Wes is nothing short of an amazing artists and performer.      OK, we now know Wes to me is a major draw to LB and I lost much interest when he left.  But honestly, while most of his other works were interesting to great, they never really brought me to the same highs as his inspired works with LB (and his other band mates were great, but just not as good in the over all product (for me).    LB is like an adrenalin dump.  The same way many Rap/Metal artists are, but with their own sound and flavor.  There is one LB and there will not be anyone to step into those shoes,for better or worse.  There will never be another B.B. King, Buckethead, Dave Matthews Band, Led Zeppelin, Jeff Buckley, or Slayer.  I'll go a step further and say if you don't get it, you really must have had a charmed life and probably will not appreciate what comes from struggle, feel safe in a box, and odds are will never contribute anything original.  So I am not misunderstood, getting it does not even mean you have to like it, but it means you have to respect the creativity.    As far as the album goes, I think it is a great return of a band I missed.  Like all their albums (and every artist I have ever listened to with perhaps a handful of exceptions) there would be a couple songs I would have replaced.  Overall, it is an odd thing.  The CD reminds you of earlier works and at the same time really does deliver something new and a different enough vibe that you want to listen to it over again.  It is an excellent LB CD and an excellent CD overall, when so much music is beginning to sound like the same troll from the center of the earth's brainwashing marking department decided to pump out.

1572814748|5.0|this is my favorite tarot. since i use Tarot mostly for symbolism, i love the warm and softly bright colors.  they are pleasant to behold. i prefer RW decks. i like the small size, the cards are 2 1/4 inches by 3 1/2 inches. it comes with a LWB and a very sturdy very handsome cardboard box that has a slip off type top thats stays on when closed. the larger Radiant RW deck is very similar, in color, there are a few minor detail differences, actualy these both my favorite tarot, the smaller being a bit easier for me to handle. the back of the Universal Waite, the smaller of the two, is borderless with grayish blue clouds on the long sides, between the clouds is a slightly darker blue but not a deep bue sky. in the center is a yellow eight pionted star. its very nice. im giving a dual review here, of the Universal and the Radiant, because i like them both so much. the back of the Radiant RW has a narrow white border, with a dark blue background, speckled with tiny yellow stars. its lovely. just to mention, the Radiant RW cards are 2 3/4 inches by 4 3/4 inches, and come  with a LWB, and a standard type box that can opened from the top or bottom. both boxes are very attractive and colorful. if you like original RW and a tradition stlye RW with more vibrant colors you will most likely enjoy these Tarot very much.
B0000026WD|5.0|Alright, we are talking about the KING of POP here!!! I even got a tatt of the symbol under the \\"GIVE IN TO ME\\" song on this album! Does that give ya an idea of how much I really love this artist and his music?
B004ULEEY8|5.0|I am talking about the \\"Critics,\\" and not this AWESOME movie, of course. Sorry to break the news to all the \\"high brows\\" and \\"low brows\\" out there... this was not about being an action or Sci-Fi Movie... it was a well written screenplay about ONE MAN (with some great supporting charactors and perspectives), and his personal experience/perspective when life \\"just happens\\" (As the great story of life is often apt to do). Has THAT story been told before? Sure... but this version had great acting, directing and visual effects to boot... just nothing over the top... which is GOOD.  It is AT LEAST as good as any film ever made with similar themes and genres... and that makes it GREAT, by default... if not with the blessing of the \\"annointed\\" critics out there.  Is it a \\"Chick Flick?\\" Nope. It's not a \\"metro man\\" flick either, but saying that... this film is not a \\"Movie for guys who love movies\\" flick either, per se (Sorry TNT), although it would work there. Intelligent and thoughtful women will love it just as much as any man capable of seeing the story in a movie, and not just the eye candy.    Better yet?... It does not take itself too seriously (like the critics who slammed it), but can justifiably be called a great, entertaining film with a REAL STORY anyway.  I'm prior service, and parts of this film made me very anxious duirng close-in battle scenes on the big screen in the theater, while other parts brought a sincere tear to my eye.  This is a personal story about irony, finding meaning in disaster and sacrifice, personal character in a crisis, and redemption of the tired and battered soul.  If you can't see those things when you watch... try switching to PBS or the Cartoon Network... you are not ready yet.  ;)
B0051QIGP4|1.0|I'm glad I waited for Cascada Original Me after listening to this CD at my friends house.  Every time he'd play a song 30 seconds into it I'd say, NEXT.  I loved Lady Gaga's first album, what a disappointment this was.  Say what you want about Cascada, but that bad can keep up with there previous albums.  This album makes me think The Fame was a fluke.
B0002EXH5O|5.0|Goofy cover aside, this is one of Megadeth's two 5-star releases.  The other being Peace Sells.  In my opinion, Rust in Peace and Peace Sells are the only two truly indispensable Megadeth albums.  I'd give 4 stars to Killing is My Business & So Far So Good.  Beyond that, the other, more recent Megadeth albums are 3 stars or less (usually less).<br /><br />Anyway, back to RIP - there are lots of good cuts on here.  The only two tracks that are forgettable are 'Poison was the Cure' and the title track.  However, getting 7 out of 9 right ain't bad!<br /><br />\\"Holy Wars\\" and \\"Tornado of Souls\\" remain two of my favorite Megadeth tunes to this day; 2 decades after their release I still fully enjoy these songs.  Great Stuff!  Honorable mention for \\"Take No Prisoners\\", \\"Five Magics\\", \\"Hangar 18\\", and the surprising \\"Dawn Patrol\\".<br /><br />This album deserves its rightful place as a classic thrash period piece.  It is a good one.  Definitely recommended.  Stick with the original 1990 release - do not buy the remastered copy.
B002ZFQD04|3.0|NO doubt that Sticky and Sweet is a tour de force, I still prefer Blonde Ambition and Girlie Show. Those were the reasons she became an icon.    Up to 2000, Madonna had gay dancers on her tours. For Hard Candy she seem to want to go after young urban black males.    Standouts on this one, includes a heavy metal version of Borderline and Hung Up. Some of the stuff I have seen in other concerts. The street scene idea for Into The Groove is also on Kylie's Fever Tour in 2001.    But the costumes are a let down. She looks like she's going for a Physical Education class in Shes Not Me.    Other than all these, the high energy and sexual antics is still abundant. Still enjoyable but I doubt it is as iconic as her earlier tours.
B003U9NAD2|5.0|This is it - the purest expression of Varg Vikernes' philosophy. The guitars are beautifully ugly, the drums are at their primitive best, the vocals are still the rawest ever in black metal, and the synths make the whole thing feel ethereal, other-worldly, and dreamlike. It's like wandering through a darkly beautiful mountain landscape - hungered, violent, solitary, godless (to quote Nietzsche). The whole thing is topped off with a long synth instrumental that sounds like the aural personification of ice.<br /><br />The lyrics (in Norwegian), contrary to common view (and regardless of Varg's personal opinions), are not Satanic, Nazi or even racist - they are either personal in nature or describe various Norse myths.<br /><br />There's not much more to say about Hvis Lyset Tar Oss, other than it is an experience not meant for all. Approach at your own risk, and don't be ashamed if you run screaming from the darkness.

B0050LJIRK|5.0|Gold Cobra is an awesome cd. Its a mixture of all their cds put together along with some heavy beats that make this one of their best. Limp Bizkit is back to their old ways and that is a very very good thing.
B0043EV774|4.0|I personally think they got the story on screen very well. The more you watch it the better it gets. You can't say that for all movies can you? Thinking outside the box is requiered for the viewer.<br />On the other hand, I would not advise anyone to spend the extra money for the \\"3D\\" experience. It just isn't worth it in this movie.

B00005N9CV|5.0|The Claus Ogermann arrangements are superb, especially in Dancing in the Dark, I Remember You, and the title song. The atmosphere he creates is a kind of lush orchestral impressionism. He is given more creative space here than in the classic Sinatra/Jobim recording from the sixties.
B00509OFE8|5.0|This series was awesome it was different than the other Stargate's. It is a shame that most people are closed off to the fact that we all come from Space. They can't bring it back because of money. What a crying shame...
B003H9M1QM|5.0|Ever since I was little, I've enjoyed this movie and now I play it for my kids as well. The quality of the Blu-ray is phenomenal, particularly if you have a high def television. My two year old doesn't enjoy the film as much as my four year old. May be different for your kids, but I find the older ones follow along with the story and get more out of the film.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|I can't tell you how fun this book is to read. I think ultimately the fun is more in the \\"being in the moment\\" of this book than the actual plot, but its such a great story and full of so much inspiration and wisdom.
B004A8ZX2S|5.0|I saw \\"The Tree of Life\\" yesterday, and I'm still reflecting on it today. Let me say right away that some of the audience hated it, complaining it was the worst film they'd ever seen, obviously not what they'd been expecting in the least. I can understand that reaction, just as I can understand the chasm between positive & negative reviewers -- this is NOT a summer blockbuster by any stretch of the imagination!<br /><br />That said, let me explain some of the reasons I found it so deeply moving & soul-nourishing ...<br /><br />First of all, it's a gorgeous & sumptuous film. The images aren't just vivid & lyrical, they flow into one another with a quiet, subtle rhythm that mesmerizes & enthralls. It invites to viewer to actually stop & look at the tiniest, most seemingly insignificant details of the everyday world & see how utterly wondrous they truly are. It's a reminder that beneath the familiar, ever-shifting screen of what we call everyday life, something that's increasingly more artificial & superficial, there's still a very real universe, something that preceded humanity & will long outlast it. This is an uncomfortable reminder for many, but it offers a necessary perspective for anyone aspiring to more than simply buying things & going from sensation to sensation.<br /><br />Then there's the astonishing evocation of childhood in all of its mystery & confusion & occasional terror. I found myself reliving a flood of my own childhood memories, sparked by what I saw on the screen. In particular, the father-son dynamic had me remembering my own late father & our relationship; this was both wrenching & healing. For those who have lost family & then come to certain wiser realizations later on, when it's too late to voice them, I think this aspect of the film will really resonate.<br /><br />And of course there's the philosophical & metaphysical aspect. We've all pondered & asked the questions raised in this film at one time or another, haven't we? We all want understandable answers to our unanswerable questions. Many prefer to bury those questions & get on with everyday life ... and I won't necessarily condemn them. But sooner or later, whether we like it or not, we've got to confront those questions & grapple with them. Better to do so of our own volition, rather than being forced into it by trauma & loss. Again, I found that the film invites us to do just that. It's not a coincidence that Sean Penn's Jack does this at midlife, when he's gained everything he could want materially, but lacks the peace & resolution he so obviously & desperately seeks.<br /><br />Like a few other films -- \\"2001,\\" \\"Baraka,\\" \\"The Fountain\\" all come to mind -- this is more of a tone poem, a symphony to be experienced & then thought about afterwards, than a traditional narrative. I think it's best seen in a thoughtful, reflective frame of mind, as if entering a cathedral or a museum, rather than as an evening's entertainment. Whatever quibbles I might have about this or that detail, they fade in the face of the film's overall achievement.<br /><br />Still, as I said at the beginning, it's not for everyone's taste. Read the reviews & decide for yourself it's the sort of thing you might find intriguing. If so, you're in for a remarkable film, one that will stay with you for a long time -- highly recommended!le questions.

Wheter you have a technical background or not, he breaks topics/objectives down in to small digestable parts and includes questions at the end of each chapter to check that  you've actual pulled from your study what was intended.  I've been a fan and avid reader of Todd's books for 4 years and highly recommend them.[[ASIN:0470901071 CCNA, (640-802): Cisco Certified Network Associate Study Guide]]

B002ZG975Q|1.0|Wow, I honestly did not think it was even possible to mess up a story so badly.  When I read the book last winter, I wasn't too impressed, but at least the author included the main points that make the \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" tale what it is.  Well, for some reason the scriptwriters decided to take all those things--the most interesting parts of the story, in my opinion, and throw them away.  They obviously had NO IDEA that they were trying to tell an old French fairy tale with lots of tradition behind it, and instead opted to make a boring teen sap flick.  Aside from the curse, virtually all of the magical elements were missing.  The so-called Beast was not even really a beast; they simply made him bald and covered him with tattoos and some scars--hardly anything to earn a second glance in New York City.  And I found the fact that the protagonist was so very ashamed of his new look, and the implications that a tattooed skinhead is intrinsically ugly, DEEPLY offensive.  If I were the author of this book, I would deny all knowledge of this travesty.
0316098329|4.0|I read this book in one night because I simply could not put it down. The 5-year old protagonist, Jack, has a fresh and innocently provocative voice and his story seems ripped straight from the headlines. It would have been easy for the story to have spun into pure cheese-- heroic woman and child overcome horrific treatment and emerge victorious from the lion's den-- but Donahue neatly avoids this pitfall by focusing (almost brutally) on the fragile and flawed nature of humanity. Neither Jack nor his mother are perfect, and because of their all-too-human weaknesses and moments of selfishness the reader is prohibited from putting either character on a pedestal for worship but rather must deal with the painful realism of their situation.   I would recommend this book for two audiences: readers looking for a heart-wrenching story of a mother and child's will to survive; and readers interested in child development and the importance of language acquisition. I was struck by a comment Donahue made in Author Interview that follow the conclusion of the novel in which she describes her research into \\"feral children\\" and the consequences of affection/attention deprivation in young children. She argues that the primary reason that Jack is able to achieve the level of \\"normalcy\\" and development that he has is because his mother encouraged him to engage with language games on multiple levels (parroting the television, combining words to make new compounds, naming and interacting with objects within the Room, etc.). The novel, therefore, works on a high level both as an entertaining and moving narrative, and as an exploration of healthy, sustainable childhood development/socialization.  GREAT read-- especially for book groups or English/child psychology classes

B0050CQY1W|4.0|I am pleasantly surprised by this CD.  Beyonce took me to another level and I enjoyed the ride.  If you are looking for her usual club bangers like \\"Crazy in Love\\", \\"Upgrade U\\" or \\"Single Ladies\\" you won't find it here, although remixes may come into play.  This CD is very chill in my opinion; one that you can just groove and ride to.     By far \\"Love on Top\\" is my favorite song.  If I had to put a rating to them from 1 - 5 stars it would be as follows (also give a lil snippet of the words from some of my favs):    1. 1+1 - (4 stars) Great song!  Fell for it when she sang it on American Idol.    2. I care - (3 stars) I like this one. Speaks about how one partner may not care about how the other feels at times but you care. \\"I told you that you hurt me baby but you don't care. Now I'm crying and deserted baby but you don't care.  Can't nobody tell me this is love....\\"    3. I Miss You - (3 stars) If you still feel something for someone that has done you wrong but you don't know why then you will understand this song.    4. Best Thing I Never Had - (2 stars)  Although not a bad song, I'm just not feeling it.    5. Party - (5 stars) - Ride to this one!  Don't let the title fool you, it's not your typical club song but it can definitely get some play.  \\"So in love, I'll give you everything just don't tell nobody tomorrow.  Tonight I'm gonna give you everything, music knocking till the morning light cause we like to party.\\"    6. Rather Die Young - (2 stars) Another one that is not a bad song but doesn't sit well when I hear it.    7. Start Over - (3 ½ stars) - \\"Let's start over, let's give love their wings.  Let's start over stop fighting bout the same ole thing.  Let's start over, maybe we can start all over give love another life.\\"    8. Love On Top - (5+ stars) - Absolutely the best song on the CD (to me)!  I can talk about it from beginning to end but will spare you the words.  Even though she over sings a bit on this song it sounds so good.     9. Countdown - (5 stars) - Didn't like this sing when it was leaked but once I got in the car it was quite right and it gets much play in the Dodge. \\"Ladies if you love that man show him he the flyest, grind up on it girl show him how you ride it...\\"    10. End of Time - (3 stars)    11. I Was Here -  (3 stars)    12. Run The World - (1 stars) I just don't like it.    BONUS: (from Deluxe CD)  1. Lay Under Me - (2 ½ stars)    2. Schoolin' Life - (5 stars) This is a nice song, really catchy.  \\"At 14 they ask me what I wanna be, I said baby 21 so I can get me a drink.  I'm not a teacher baby but I can teach you something.  Not a preacher but we can pray if you wanna.  Ain't a doctor but I can make you feel better but I'm great at writing physical love letters.  I'm a freak all day and all night.\\"    3. Dance for You - (4 ½ stars) Think of it as an upgrade to Cater to You. \\"Lovin you is all that's on my mind; wanna make that body rock...)    4 - 6. Boring remixes of Run The World    In closing:  It's a great purchase.  Even if you are not a typical Beyonce fan you will find this CD catering to a lil bit of everyone.  She cools it down and pretty gets her grown woman on.  Just go get it!

B004EPZ07U|3.0|Given some of the superhero movies that have come out lately, the best news about Green Lantern is that the studio, Warner Brothers, did _not_ go with their original idea of casting Jack Black as Hal Jordan (unlike Columbia Pictures who _did_ cast Seth Rogen as Britt Reid in The Green Hornet, condemning it to be The Green Bomb of superhero flicks).  Ryan Reynolds is actually fairly decent as the title hero, and while the movie did come up short in a number of ways, it wasn't for any failing on Reynolds' part.<br /><br />For anyone already familiar with the Green Lantern comics which go back for decades, no real synopsis is needed, but for everyone else here's the basic plot: Unknown to humanity, who only recently have begun to venture out into space, there is an ancient organization called the Green Lantern Corps, established by a race known as the Guardians of the Universe, to act as a kind of inter-galactic police force, with one Green Lantern assigned to each of the 3,600 sectors that make up the known universe. Each Green Lantern is armed with a ring of power that allows them to create whatever they need out of a kind of mystical green energy, the only limits being that of their imagination and their will. A battle with a deadly entity known as Parallax (voiced by Clancy Brown) leaves the Green Lantern for our sector, Abin Sur (Temuera Morrison), mortally wounded. Crash-landing on Earth, the dying Sur commands his ring to find a worthy successor among the inhabitants of Earth to take his place.  The ring, as fate would have it, finds Hal Jordan (Reynolds), a cocky if irresponsible and impulsive test pilot. The transition is made and Jordan becomes the new Green Lantern, only to be faced with opposition from Sinestro (Mark Strong), the current leader of the GL Corps who regards him as unfit to be the new GL.  Jordan has his own doubts about his fitness, but they quickly become immaterial as Earth is faced with twin threats: the entity Parallax and a human scientist, Hector Hammond (marvelously played by Peter Sarsgaard) who is accidentally infected with some of Parallax's essence, which causes him to mutate, disfiguring and crippling him but giving him extraordinary mental powers including telepathy and telekinesis. Alone and unsure of himself, Jordan must nonetheless use the power given him to save both the Earth and his love interest, Carol Ferris (Blake Lively).  Or die trying.<br /><br />As a film, Green Lantern is somewhat uneven, mainly due to the script and to a lesser degree some questionable casting.  Too much of the script consists of lumps of exposition, making it hard for the film to build up momentum and causing parts of it to drag unnecessarily. It also spreads itself too thin, bringing in characters from the Green Lantern comic lore like Tomar-Re (Geoffrey Rush) and Kilowog (Michael Clarke Duncan), two alien GL's, and Amanda Waller (Angela Bassett), head of a secret government science/security agency, but giving them minimal screen time and little to do.  And the choice of villains is highly questionable. Hector Hammond is hardly the most memorable GL villain from the comics and in this incarnation is rendered more disfigured than truly powerful, and Parallax is done here more like a creature out of an H.L. Lovecraft story than anything else, consisting entirely of special effects with Clancy Brown's voice behind them.<br /><br />(This is one of my frequent complaints about movies in recent years:  special effects do _not_ make up for a lame script.  Neither does doing the film in 3D.  Green Lantern cost some $150M to make.  They'd have been better off spending more money getting the script right than on trying to cover its deficiencies up with special effects and 3D.)<br /><br />And as I mentioned, some of the casting was unfortunate. Tim Robbins as Senator Hammond, Hector's over-bearing father, is utterly wasted and out of place, most of the time looking like he's wondering how he got stuck in the role andhow soon he can get out of it.  Angela Bassett is not only wasted, she's just simply _wrong_ as Amanda Waller as anyone familiar with the character from the comics can attest to.  And with Blake Lively, who's not remotely believable as a test pilot, there's a complete lack of chemistry between her and Reynolds. To be fair though, all of these people are fine actors who have been remarkable in any number of other movies; they were simply badly cast here and hampered with banal dialogue that would've tested any actor.<br /><br />But which leads me to mention the two stand-outs of Green Lantern. Mark Strong is quite convincing as Sinestro, GL's classic nemesis from the comics, though here he's in pre-villain mode and so can't take center stage.  Nonetheless, in the scenes he does have, Strong can do more with a withering glance than most actors can with a page of dialogue. But it's Peter Sarsgaard's Hector Hammond who really steals the show (not to mention every scene he's in). More than any other actor in the film, Sarsgaard seems to really get what comic superheroes and supervillains are all about. And he plays Hammond to the hilt, even hampered by the script and by a make-up job that is more Elephant Man than the villain from the original comics, reaching the audience on a level that no one else in the film does. You _get_ Hammond, even if you wouldn't want to be in the same room with him. And, it has to be said, Sarsgaard brings to the table the best (and creepiest) supervillain / evil-scientist laugh I've heard in years.<br /><br />The special effects, particularly the ring effects which are absolutely vital to making Green Lantern come alive, are fairly well done.  I wasn't blown away by them, but neither was I left feeling let down by them.  The same for the alien Green Lanterns and the Guardians of the Universe.  Not the best they could have been, but they work. With one exception: the attempts to make Hal Jordan's eyes green when he becomes the Green Lantern never quite pull it off.<br /><br />Oh, and make sure you watch the movie through the end credits: there's a scene with Sinestro that sets things up for what will almost certainly be the sequel, if GL has a respectable box office anyway.<br /><br />Overall, I'd recommend Green Lantern as a decent watch if you're a fan of the comic or of superhero films in general.Angela Bassett is not only wasted, she's just simply _wrong_ as Amanda Waller as anyone familiar with the character from the comics can attest to.

Now fight!\\"    oh yes, fight with the weapons you have inside yourself. what better lesson can we teach our children? do your girls a favor, fairytales belong in the 60's. it's 2011, prince charming is not coming to save you. save yourself. amen, sucker punch.    step away from the norm, be brave and go for it. you might be pleasantly surprised by how it makes you feel.    i hope you didn't expect me to babble about the plot, blah blah blah...there's enough reviews doing that. i just felt compelled to say how it made me feel.

0307272702|5.0|If you have struggled with a weight problem you will welcome the information that the author presents. There is a lot of detail, as he builds his case and can seem dry and repetitive at times, but stick with it. It will be worth it in the end. THIS IS NOT A DIET BOOK!!!! but explains in detail how your body uses the food that you consume. Finally, you can let go of the guilt of not being able to \\"control\\" your appetite. I have been applying this knowledge to my eating habits and it has made a huge difference. I never have cravings and have already shaved away 2 dress sizes slowly but painlessly.Highly, highly recommend this book.
B0030Y11XS|4.0|Michael Moore... by now, most people should know what they're getting with his movies by now.<br /><br />A strong dose of anti-establishmentarianism thrown together without much consideration for flow or story line. Moore's goal is to motivate his audience, exposing them to pieces of information they may not be aware of. If you want cited sources and in-depth analysis, you've come to the wrong place.<br /><br />The central theme, if any, is that corporate America does not represent the needs of the average American. If you can't agree with that you either haven't been paying attention, or have a CEO (or higher) position.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|no, it's not as awesome as the PC version.  although, I like the touch controls more!  still, for a mobile port, it's pretty good.  wasted a LOT of time with it, for sure.  I got it free.  worth $3? Yea, but having finished it, I probably wouldn't buy it (&quot;again&quot;), but I certainly will pay for the next installment on mobile!
B0052UZIFA|1.0|It is the second time it lost all my progress.  Good bye.  Luck I got this when it was free. Don't recommend it before Popcap fixes it.
B0037BB00I|5.0|I admit, I started listening to Adele after jumping on the \\"Rolling in the Deep\\" bandwagon. However, all of her music completely blew me away. What an amazing voice this girl has! So raw, so passionate, so emotional. I love every single track on this album. Favorite songs include \\"Best for Last,\\" \\"Chasing Pavements,\\" \\"First Love,\\" and the gorgeous cover of Billy Joel's \\"To Make You Feel My Love.\\" Adele has quickly become one of my favorite go-to artists. Whenever I want to listen to some incredible music, I reach for one of her albums. I cannot wait to see where her talents take her in the future.
B004EPYZU8|5.0|Since the critics universally gave this movie a \\"sucker punch\\", I immediately knew this would be an entertaining movie worth my time. Suffice it to say that they are movie critics since they cannot make it in the \\"real\\" world like the rest of us. Their lack of imagination insures they cannot possibly understand a movie on this level, way too complicated for them. Too many levels of imagery, allegorical interpretation, and symbology for them to have to sort through.     My daughter and I both agreed that we liked it, on many different levels. This movie is an excellent blend of a good moral story, sacrifice of one's self for others (the 5th element needed in the story-line from the wise character portrayed by Scott Glenn in Baby Doll's fantasies - who makes a surprise \\"real-world\\" appearance at a critical moment at the end of the film leaving us wondering) mind-blowing Matrix style action, surprisingly good acting (if this same level of acting had been in a boring ass movie made on a $50k budget with no special effects, filmed in France, it would have probably been a critically aclaimed gem by the critics, premiered at the Can Film festival), mind-blowing special effects that would make George Lucas proud, a kick-ass sound-track; these all insure this movie is worth 2 hours of your time.     The movie starts off with a enveloping story immediately, with Baby Doll, the young, petite, beautifully genuine young lady, placed in the mental institution by her abusive step-father after the death of her mother, also after she desperately tried to stop him from sexually abusing her little sister. In the struggle with her step-father, she discovered her sister had been killed.     The rest of the show details Baby Doll and her new friends from the institution/brothel in their plan to escape their chains of bondage into freedom.     Baby Doll uses her vivid imagination (the source of the fabulous special effects that abound in this movie) in order to escape from the erotic dances she is forced to perform for the evil men that surround her. Ironically, this enables Baby Doll to draw upon her fabulous imagination in order to maintain her sanity within the insane asylum, as well as her courage and spirit that she needs to lead the other girls in their attempt to overcome the evil men that surround them. This leads to an important morale of this story; never give up - never give in (Dare Devil style). No matter the consequences. No matter the cost. Evil men must NOT prevail. EVER. (This includes movie critics).     This is a movie that triumphs in it's theme of the unsuppressable nature of the goodness and unquenchable power of human spirit, and the ultimate sacrifice of good to win over evil. A sacrifice that has been repeatedly performed throughout the Millenia of human existance, that insure good wins in the end - every time. A concept a movie critic, devoid of all imagination, cannot possibly understand.....    The Amazon critic here just simply doesn't get it. There was actually an insane asylum posing as a front for the brothel that the girls were effectively slaved to. The critic writes that the brothel was in Baby Doll's imagination. What an idiot. All he can see is 5 scantily clad, sexually stimulating women in Japanese style, body bending, mind-numbing visual and audio special effects overload, repleat with rocket launchers, gatlin guns, 6th century Jananese and samuri swords, machine guns, colt 45's, zepplins, and one very cute \\"pink bunny rabbit\\" killer girl-controlled robot. By the way, these components are good as well....    People need to actually have an open-mind to understand a work as creative as this show. Given enough time, it will become a cult-classic.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|This album is incredible. It's even better than Adele's \\"19\\" album, which is saying a lot because that album rocked. Yes, \\"Rolling in the Deep\\" is a fabulous song, but it's not my favorite song on this CD by a long shot. Every single track on this album is fabulous and single-worthy. However, I think my favorites are \\"Lovesong,\\" which is a super sexy and seductive number, and \\"Someone Like You,\\" which is amazing and soulful and heart-wrenching...anyone who has ever loved and lost will totally be able to relate to this song. \\"21\\" is my favorite album of 2011 so far. Get yourself a copy now!
B0050CQY1W|3.0|So far, there have been many mixed reviews about Beyonce's album, \\"4\\" and the only reason being that music has rapidly changed in the course of one year. Let's be honest -- during the time of her \\"absence\\" or \\"hiatus\\" from the limelight, her break from the success of a string of hits like \\"Single Ladies\\" and \\"Halo,\\" other female artists like Lady Gaga, Adele have offered fresh new sounds. Yes, Beyonce is a great performer (probably one  of the best), a brilliant vocalist, got a great sense of fashion, a rockin' body, but she ultimately lacks personality. Why has Lady Gaga blown up so quick and so fast? She holds nothing back - she lets her fans know EXACTLY who she is in interviews, her vision is seen through her sometimes \\"wacky\\" and over-the-top videos. And you know what? It worked for her, and is still working for her. Fans feel like they know her - she's been bullied at school, fights for homosexuality, freedom to be yourself, individuality, etc. Other artists like Kesha and Taylor Swift are popular because they have an element that the audience can relate to. Take Taylor Swift for example. To many, she may be immature and annoying, but the fact that she is a young individual who is an extremely talented songwriter, and particularly writes about boys - keeps the audience interested. This is where Beyonce goes wrong. She lacks personality; the audience doesn't know about her well enough to think that she has LIVED her songs. She sings perfectly, hits every note but that does not necessarily mean that it sounds good. Adele - her album, 21 is a massive success because you can feel her pain and sorrow vocally. She has such soul to her voice that exceeds the vocal ability of Beyonce. You just don't get that with Beyonce's voice - it lacks genuine emotion. She is a perfect technical singer, but with Adele, her songs lyrically and vocally are just on another level. Let's be honest - Beyonce's lyrics aren't quite the greatest and at times, seem a bit immature. In 1+1 she yelps, \\"I don't know much about algebuh but I know 1+1 equals 2.\\" I mean, come on - that's the best that you got?! It needs to be heartfelt lyrics sung with emotion and soul, pain and sorrow, feelings of happiness and love. Even though she has been wildly successful in the past decade, what people are interested now is knowing the artist, feeling like we can relate to them as well. Lady Gaga is pretty much reigning the music scene right now, and by the looks of it - especially with this album, it seems like Lady Gaga, Taylor Swift and even Britney Spears can take her down. In many ways, this album is no different from all the other albums that she has released. We get it, Beyonce is a world class singer, performer, dancer, actress -- but who is the REAL beyonce? Sadly, we don't know much about her than the time she was in Destiny's Child. We know this much about her - she is married to Jay-Z, and from Houston Texas. She needs to open up a lot more to hold a candle to the reigning female artists right now.
B001AQMBJG|1.0|Not up to Warner's usual high standard of Bluray transfer. No real difference from standard DVD. New transfer supposedly available next year. Wish I had known, would have waited.
B0055FR5PS|4.0|Not bad. It is a decent action flick. Acting is Fair, what do  you expect for an action flick. I could repeat that over and over but again.... It has taken some time to mature my appreciation of cinema. Within each genre, not everything needs to make perfect sense.
B0041OJ0Y8|5.0|I am about to purchase their album, but have listened to most of their songs on their website or in concert or on YouTube. If you are doubt about them at all check out Die Antwoord, Max Normal T.V., or Original Evergreen on YouTube. The are witty, funny, imaginative, stylish and are taking over the world. There are many interviews with them on YouTube watch them. And besides both have the best haircuts in the world. In concert they are fantastic, I had no clue who they were before I saw them, but love them to death now. Check'em out you won't be disappointed! ;)  Keep the beats D.J. Hi-Tek! Kisses to you Yo-Landi! And I will never kick sand in a Ninja's face, never!  ~O_M~
B000FC1AGG|5.0|From the very beginning this book made me laugh hysterically out loud! It is a great read. You will not be disappointed! Could of even been alittle longer. Emma is a great character that you would love to be friends with.
B000FS9FCG|4.0|Excellent movie! It's incredible the way the drama unfolds, and it's difficult to tell you too much without giving away the plot. Just watch it if you're a Natalie Portman fan, and/or like films with unusual endings. I would not recommend this movie for kids under the age of 15, though; it does gets rather intense.
B001A3GSFW|5.0|Yeah, all the greats are on there ... long live the Ramones. Just put it on repeat, crank up the volume and zone out for an hour or so.
B000F2C7TU|5.0|This Cd was far better than i could of imagnied i always loved whitesnake and wanted their cds but couldnt find them in stores so i finally bought the rest here on amazon. Music is divided into eras if u will coverdales early stuff white snake through snakebite ep being their first era trouble through slide it being their classic era then the block buster whitesnake thru forevermore is for all whitesnakes metal fans (except restless heart, metal fans should check out slide it in cd to) im glad i finally bought them all whitesnake music is pretty varied but all great. The classic walking in the shadow of the blues is the hightligt for this release.
0142428256|5.0|Love love love love love. I really don't know what else to say. This book is now on my \\"favorites\\" book shelf. I listened to the audiobook version, and I couldn't stop. I found excuses to continue and almost listened straight through! I loved Where She Went even more than [[ASIN:014241543X If I Stay]]. It's beautifully written, almost lyrical, and told from Adam's perspective. It's a story about grief, closure, and hope.<br /><br />I thought Dan Bittner did an excellent job as the voice of Adam. He captured the rocker attitude and Adam's emotions well. I look forward to listening to him in Shiver and Linger as well when I prep for the release of Forever (Wolves of Mercy Falls, Book 3)!<br /><br />I don't want to give anything away so I'm going to keep this short and just say... if you haven't read [[ASIN:014241543X If I Stay]] then do so now, and pick up Where She Went with it so you can read them back to back. You will not regret it! I can't wait to see what Gayle Forman has in store for us next. I will read anything she writes.
B0050LJIRK|3.0|Typical Bizkit album: every song starts off promisingly with some excellent shredding by Wes Borland. Then Durst comes on with his pathetic raps and grating voice, and you quickly want to put your head through a plate glass window. It's the same as every album since \\"Significant Other.\\" After 10+ years, you need only follow the same instructions for LB's songs: either fast forward to Borland's riffs, or skip it entirely. Or, you could just listen to the still-awesome \\"Three Dollar Bill Y'all\\" again and wonder where it all went so wrong.
B004VBAHG6|5.0|This is one killer Peter Murphy album, with not one weak song on it. For those of you who may have been underwhelmed by previous Murphy albums (Dust: meet Bin), you have no cause for alarm. Ninth is at least as massively gorgeous, complex, quirky and self-assured as Deep or Cascade. And in answer to those who think the glorious voice has lost some range and control: Peter Murphy makes it work. I might even argue, on this album, the occasional hoarse waver adds a human vulnerability that matches the softer songs, such as in Creme de la Creme, which opens with an achingly lovely accoustic piano (I'm listening to it now, and I have chills.) Buy it.
B004SBX112|3.0|was enjoying this themed edition of angry birds up until the summer update. now it crashes when loading the first level. tmobile vibrant (galaxy s). please fix?
0061537969|5.0|Wonderful book.  I am not a big reader so it is rare that I read a whole book in one sitting.  This book is the exception.  It is beautifully written, emotionally engaging and very entertaining.  Do yourself a favor and read this book.
B004EPYZUI|5.0|I absolutely love the movie! I've been waiting for this day since I was in the theater in March! This is a one-of-a-kind movie, I've never seen anything like this! I strongly disagree with those who claim it has no story. It does have a story, even though the story is very simple, it is being told in a very special way: through a series of metaphors and symbolism. This movie takes your imagination to its limit! you may need to watch it multiple times to understand every bit of the symbolism used in the film. The extensive use of symbolism also opens up the opportunity for a long post-movie debate with fellow movie lovers! Last but not least, if all else fails, the 4 action sequences will be worth collecting!    Now Sucker Punch comes in Extended cut and Movie-only, what's the difference? The extended cut comes with 2 separate Blu-ray Discs, 1 for theatrical cut, and one for the R-rated Extended cut. I'm guessing the Blu-ray movie-only edition will just include the theatrical cut disc you find in the extended cut pack.    The extended cut is the original cut, I can see it's intended to be rated for  PG-13, no nudity or gore or F words or anything, but words are the MPAA insisted  on rating it R, so Snyder had to cut it down to the theatrical edition. The  thing to note is, the extended cut does not change the story line. there are  little bits and pieces added to existing scenes, and 2 full scenes not seen in  the theatrical release. So keep this in mind if you're deciding which version to  get, or if you want to know what you missed in the theaters.    In general, I have mixed feelings for the extended vs. theatrical cut. So I will  list all the changes I noticed, if you've seen the theatrical release, there  wont be any spoilers as I said the story is mainly the same.    *******!!!!!!!! SPOILER ALERT !!!!!!!!!********    Extra/Extended Scenes in Extended Cut:    1. Opening Scene: Babydoll fired a second shot at her stepfather after the  first, where the bullet goesthrough his arm    2. Sweet pea meets babydoll, the conversation involves clear statements such as  \\"The priest brought her here to lose her virginity, right?\\"    3. When Rocket gives Babydoll the tour around the theater, it shows details of  the cleaning supply room and the cook.    4. A full scene that shows the club's busy hours. girls dancing on stage for  customers to pick, what customers do, what girls do. here, all the main  characters and addition girls each get about a 5-second cut of a dance on stage  (except Babydoll who's cleaning). this is the same song \\"Love is the drug\\" as we  see in the ending credits in the theatrical cut.    5. in the dressing room scene where Babydoll first explains her plan, Madam  Gorski writs on the small white board the dance schedule, and the conversation  between Sweet Pea and Rocket is slightly longer.    6. The German steam soldier scene has added bits and pieces here and there.  Wiseman's briefing is more detailed and more shots of the girls fighting (one  shot where Blondie kills a field of soldiers, IMO it's a bit too long, the fight  between Babydoll and the commander is about 2 seconds longer, and the chase  after the map is about 5 seconds longer)    7. Madam Gorski gives Babydoll a small pep talk before her first dance for the  Mayer.    8. In the dragon scene, about 2 minutes added showing the girls fighting the  creatures. Here the music is synchronized differently from the theatrical cut on  the few shots that gets kept in the theatrical cut. There are also a few  2-second bits that are added. The flow is still very good IMO    9, Blue's lecture after Amber steals the lighter is slightly longer. One notable  change is where Blue says to Babydoll \\"I would....\\" in the theatrical cut, he  says \\"I would take you right now, and and I would pop that smile right off your  face\\"    10. Blue's lecture before he executes the girls, he says \\"... me, your father, you're lover, you're employer!\\" instead of \\"...me, your friend, your protector, your employer!\\"    11. When Blue executes Amber, it shows the gun's recoil instead of the glass of  water; when he executes Blondie, he shoots her twice instead of once (no blood  shown here). Blue has a few extra lines with Babydoll.    12. And finally, the scene everyone's been talking about, the intimate  conversation between Babydoll and Highroller. There is one long and deep  conversation where the highroller offers Babydoll freedom in exchange for her  giving herself to him. This is a very PG-13 scene, no nudity, not even partial  nudity! I do not get the MPAA...    13. When blue is talking to Babydoll after the labotomy, he has a few extra  lines.
B004Y03MQQ|5.0|Picture discs don't have the same sound quality as normal black or colored vinyl... why don't they release their new albums in high quality vinyl?? Metallica has released their albums in great deluxe and high quality vinyl, and Iron Maiden is better than them. Why can't Iron Maiden do the same?? I hope the next new album of maiden is released in a high quality black or colored vinyl. Iron Maiden's wonderful music deserve a better treatment.
B0055FR5PS|5.0|So....before watching this, ask yourself what it is you are really looking for in a movie. If you are looking for the next incredible script and/or amazing dialogue, you might as well just move on. This is an action film, pure and simple.<br /><br />The basic premise is that a bunch of clustered meteors appear on our tracking devices not long before impact, and seem to be falling near major coastal population centers around the globe. Before impact, they all slow down, and \\"pieces\\" of the clusters break away from their main hosts. Film crews on the scene reveal that they are actually aliens, who begin by killing the beachgoers and destroying the ships off the coast. Prior to \\"impact\\" a general evacuation of the target areas had been ordered by the gov't, but apparently, a lot of people wanted to witness the event, including swimmers and surfers. Anyway....<br /><br />The central focus of the movie is a squad of marines led by a green lieutenant and a grizzled staff sergeant with a reputation for getting his soldiers killed in combat and/or leaving them behind (played by Eckhart).  The marines set up a forward operating base to halt the alien invasion. Several units, including Eckhart's are sent into the warzone to rescue civilians that havent made it to the FOB, or are trapped. Of course, nobody is quite prepared for the alien soldiers they encounter, but the unit is gritty, and fights their way to some civilians. Their rescue chopper is blown out of the sky with their four (or five, cant remember) injured squadmates in it. So....they have to hoof it to the FOB. Did i mention that the gov't plans to carpet bomb the whole area, and they only have a limited amount of time to get out of the area?<br /><br />This is where the movie really starts getting interesting. I wont ruin the rest of it, but there are lots and lots of gunfights and explosions, some of which actually knocked my speakers off the entertainment center! Also, Eckhart in particular really shined in his role, but in truth, you come to love all the soldiers, and find yourself feeling proud of those who survive and those who die as well.come to love all the soldiers, and find yourself feeling proud of those who survive and those who die as well.
B0055FR5PS|5.0|I could not disagree more with the first reviewer.  I thought this movie was great!  It is nice to watch a movie out of Hollywood where we humans aren't the bad guys destroying our own planet.  This was a good patriotic movie with less cursing then most; I highly recommend it to anyone...unless you're sleepy...
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|What makes this show is the varied cast of characters involved in both courtly intrigue and a world sweeping epic. This is fantasy only in the setting, there is less escapism here than in shows like Sex and the City (which I also enjoyed btw!). GoT is about families, I think, more than anything else. Families we make and the ones we are born into.<br /><br />The cast is superb - I liked every choice save perhaps for minor characters than appear in one episode. Not everyone is perfect, some are still perhaps growing into their roles. Maisie Williams, playing Arya, however is a show stealer. I loved her scenes!<br /><br />I enjoyed the multiple stories being told, kept any one plot line from becoming too stale.<br /><br />The show manages to capture a range of events and emotion - dread of a great evil on the horizon, humorous moments between characters, courtly rivalries, conspiracies, and children growing (or forced to grow) out of the shadows of their elders.

0446571415|2.0|I was a big fan of Badacci's earlier books, but I have lost interest.  Two reasons I don't like this one:  (I'll be general to avoid spoilers.)    1. Feels like deja vu - Stone re-vists old locations from previous books, the plot twists feel too familiar, the characters have no new wrinkles and always react as predicted.  2. Weak Dialog - the dialog feels un-realistic and repetitive.  I lost count of the number of times someone brought up Stone's past name and accomplishments or the number of times someone said', \\"I'm going alone\\" only to have the other person insist on coming.  Not to mention the end where the bad guy asks \\"how did you know...?\\" allowing the hero to explain their great detective skills.    There is the occasional interesting plot twist, but overall it is tiring.
0062060554|4.0|I wasn't expecting much from this book because the author is new and the subject matter can go many different ways.  However, the book is worth the read and a good debut novel.<br /><br />Starting off, the reader is introduced to the main character of the book and the fact that she has no memory of the day before or any other day before that.  She usually wakes up thinking she is in her 20's or younger.  When she finally receives a copy of her journal and reads the front cover that says \\"Don't Trust Ben\\" that is when the reader is implanted with the idea that something must be off.  That sets the tone of the whole book.  The reader is looking for something that is off, something not quite right about the husband.  It is that which kept me reading the book.<br /><br />To be honest, the rest of the book before the end is not really too exciting.  The reader gets to read the journal of the last week or so along with the main character, both reader and her learning what has transpired and how she got this way.  Parts of it are sad and parts are rather dull and boring.  Anyone who has read some good mystery or detective novels in their past should be able to figure what is going on by midway through the book.<br /><br />Another aspect is that one has to get past the fact that no one would write a journal that reads like a novel.  This woman has memory problems to begin with, yet she can remember entire conversations from 12 hours earlier in great detail.  The time it would take to read the journal each day, then do the things in the day that she does, plus write in detail the day's activities does not work out.  I think the book might have been a little more realistic and easier to get to the point had it been written in the third person.  A lot of the detail that she writes in the journal could be explained in a third person narrative.  However, I understand the fascination of making a book like a journal or diary (see Dracula).  It is also a common thing for new writers to write in the first person.  Somehow it is easier to write that way.<br /><br />Overall, a good debut novel. It was entertaining.  There isn't much new about the idea of it or the way it is written, but it is a solid debut.  There are parts that drag on and seem irrelevant and dull, but that may be a matter of taste!  Worth the read.  4 stars!first person.  Somehow it is easier to write that way.      Overall, a good debut novel. It was entertaining.

B004Y8Y26C|5.0|When watching the film you can't help but notice the music.  It really stands out in a good way, I think the movie itself would not be watchable without such a superb soundtrack - it is timed so well with the lighting effects and mood of the movie it is impossible to separate the visuals from the music as you are watching.  When you listen to this soundtrack you find yourself transported to scenes in the movie without consciously imagining them.  As for how the soundtrack would fare not having seen the movie I can only guess that you would want to skip many of the shorter and transition tracks as they would seem odd and out of place.
B004SBQAN8|4.0|Like most movies based on a book, it was disappointing to watch after reading.  The movie however, if not thinking too much about the book, is awesome!  I loved the visual effects...and LOVED the actors who played the characters.  Overall, pretty good movie!

1575666286|4.0|In my view, there is credibility to the Gerson approach to therapy.  With all the high tech machinery used to treat cancer and other very serious illnesses, the Gerson therapy sounds simplistic at first glance, but it certainly is not.  The book does a good job of explaining the ideas involved, and clearly presents the successful 80 year history of this therapy.
B0050CQY1W|4.0|Beyonce seemed to be where Ms. Christina Aguilera was last summer. The first single from her upcoming album had been much less successful than anticipated, and the follow-up single was struggling to gain traction. Her record company was demanding that she return to the studio to record more songs because the album was devoid of hits. Beyonce refused, and thank God she did.    '4' stands as Beyonce best work yet, complete as a portrait of the woman at this point in her life. Opening with the elegant '1+1', she is a far cry from 'Single Ladies' schizophrenia and swelling 'If I Were A Boy' production. This works in her favor, as Beyonce can more easily showcase her vocals, which she isn't hesitant to do on this album.    The first half of the album moves between ballads and mid-tempo numbers, with not an outright bad song amongst them. Then, the tempos shift around 'Start Over', a brilliant stand-out that will in all likelihood, unfortunately, never be made a single. It's not necessarily the tempo; it's more Beyonce's delivery and attitude. She may be talking about a relationship, but when she says 'Let's start OVER', it seems she may be referring to what is about to serve as the up-tempo half of the album. Because, despite not getting her own disc this time around, it seems Sasha Fierce needs the spotlight.    The second half of the album is what elevates this effort above Beyonce's other records. She soars on vocal skyscrapers in 'Love On Top', raves on 'Countdown', the most fun song here, and then builds a spin class-friendly track in 'End of Time'. Beyonce hasn't seemed to have this much fun on record since 'Freakum Dress', and it's refreshing to see her back in playful form.    There are several songs that don't quite stand up to their counterparts. 'Rather Die Young' may be the most autobiographical of her younger days, but it feels weak between two incredibly strong songs. 'I Was Here' is a song made more for a greatest hits collection or a songstress ready to hang it up, and Beyonce is far from there. Thankfully the album ends strong with 'Run the World', as rave-ready as always.    '4' isn't all that much different in structure from 'I Am...Sasha Fierce' if that album was put on one disc; ballads begin the album, while the up-tempo numbers are withheld for the end. However, what truly makes '4' such a triumph is everything that seems to have been put into it. This can be attributed to the producers more than anything; in the 21st century, it's what holds or sinks an artist, and the beats here are sparse when necessary and never overwhelm Beyonce's vocals. The-Dream, Tricky Stewart, and Babyface helm the project, which makes it all a bit reminiscent of Mariah Carey's 'Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel' album. That album undeservedly bombed, so here's hoping the same fate isn't dealt to this record. The problem with Run the World was not Beyonce or her record label or anyone involved in the product. They delivered a song so different from anything on the radio, it was more balls to the wall than anything Lady Gaga has done musically thus far. America seemed too shocked or turned off to support it, and thankfully there's not another song on the record that feels too left field. Run The World is a one-per-album kind of song, and that's what Christina Aguilera seemed to miss on 'Bionic', an album stretched thin on sex and synths.  Beyonce has seemed to truly become the artist she's always wanted to be on '4', the most fatless album of the year thus far, and I have a feeling that this is the woman we will see on record from here on out. From what I hear so far, I can't complain.    Recommended Songs: '1+1', 'Best Thing I Never Had', 'Start Over', 'Countdown'
B001O1O71C|2.0|I found that this was to grim of a book to really enjoy. I didn't think there was much of a plot and it was very, very predictable. I didn't even like Bruno's character. And as a note i thought the end of the movie was extremley difficult to watch.

B000FC1LOC|5.0|This book really makes you think. It shows all sides of the story and not just Kate's. I thought that it was more than the disease that tore them apart. It was the actions they made around it. Warning: hysterical crying at the end is normal, at least for me

B003TSEL7S|5.0|Really really good!! I couldn't put it down. It always had me guessing and predicting. I thought this book was a little more mature than the Percy Jackson books. It had touches of humor, romance, and full of adventure. I was so sad that the next one doesn't come out til the fall because I finished it in Decmber

A Road Map for Islamic Women \\"Living\\" in the Web!<br />I Thank Ayaan Hirsi Magan for sharing her Life Experience with Us; her story is a Lesson & an Eye-Opener for me. I knew nothing of Islam & it's Strict Rules of Living but Infidel has changed Me Forever.

In spite of the undeniably sad qualities of this tale, I thoroughly enjoyed the book and plan on reading it again in the future - which is something I can't say about very many books. Yeah - it's reeeeeeally good.

B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I was very excited to read this last installment of the Hunger Games series. I really enjoyed the first two books (although I found Katniss to be a bit annoying at times, almost like Bella was in Twilight, but that comparison might be unfair in some respects), so I read the third with a sense of enthusiasm I haven't felt since I finally held the 7th Harry Potter book in my hands. However excited I was when I began reading, it dwindled down to a nothing numbness by the time I finished with the book. I even slept on it before writing this review, in hopes that I would feel better about it the next day. I feel worse.    First, I am disappointed in the character development. Though I might've been a little overwhelmed and annoyed by Katniss at brief moments in the other books (which I blame on the overbearing first person perspective and almost diary-type writing style that became too casual for me at some parts), I was very frustrated with her absence in this book. It seemed to me that when she wasn't shooting a propo for D13, she was either in a drug-induced stupor or sleeping it off in some abandoned closet(which makes for a pretty dull read). Peeta is also absent from 95% of the story line in this installment. It really bothered me when we come to realize that Peeta has been \\"hijacked\\" against Katniss, as I believed that his rescue might actually give her character more zest, when in fact it does the opposite. As a reader, I lost my trust in Peeta, and I was waiting for that moment when I felt that he could actually be the same again, but that moment never came for me. Finnick is the only character that I felt was well-rounded. I felt a strong connection to him and his relationship with Annie (which is never really fully explored), and was offended when his life came to such an abrupt and uncelebrated end. I thought he deserved more than to meet his fate in a sewer filled with muttations, and I did not appreciate that Katniss hardly gives his death a second thought.I also didn't understand the point of the fabricated mission to kill President Snow. We invested a lot of time following the group of star studded soldiers on their journey into the capitol. We whitnessed a lot of deaths...I think Katniss counts 8 deaths in 24 hours...and some fairly significant exchanges between Katniss and Peeta (real or not real?), only to have the mission suddenly cut short by an explosion. I understand the explosion's significance, as it kills Prim, the person that Katniss first swore to protect. What I don't understand is why Katniss had to be picked up and plopped back into D13. It was so anticlimactic and disappointing, not to mention frustrating because it seemed like a big waste of valuable pages.    Overall, I am disappointed with this part of the story because I wanted Katniss, the rebels, and myself to experience some kind of vindication...something that would make it all seem worth it in the end. Instead, Katniss is delivered a final blow (the death of her sister) that essentially deadens her, and with her, the story. I'm not sure what I wanted out of her...I wanted her to want to make a difference. Instead, it felt like everything she did was forced upon her. Nothing was ever truly in her hands. I thought she would stay in 13 and help build a new, functional world. I thought that we had focused on Peeta's skills with speech and people because he would eventually become the President of the new world. I thought everything would be shiny and new and hopefull, but instead of tears of joy, I cried tears of defeat and emptiness when I finally closed this book. I felt nothing, just like Katniss.
B004IFYMWK|5.0|I agree with the other 5 star reviews and find I was even more interested in the subject now that time has passed and the members of the Bush Administration that broke the law - got off without consequences.  The movie inspired me to read the books on which it was based and I highly recommend Joe Wilson's The Politics of Truth as must reading for any American that is tired of the lies circulated by today's main stream media and the right wing nut jobs that are getting all the favorable press.  This movie is terrific and the book is impossible to put down - even though I lived through these events and remember them vividly, new perspective is gained through reading the books.  Invest just a little time and you will be rewarded with some new knowledge and understanding.

B004K4IZ3G|2.0|I wanted to like this movie, but I don't. The Blu-Ray was very clear and at some times even a bit visually stunning... but the 7.1 DTS sounded terrible on my 5.1 sound system... and I can't stand techno-disco crap for music, so I was very put off by the sound... at times so loud that it drowns out the dialogue track so I had to use the sub-titles to even know where the story was going... which as it turns out wasn't very far at all! The original at least had \\"bits\\" of humor spread out, but this story didn't. Largely a disappointing evening to be had for all... I was expecting so much more.
B004ZH66XO|4.0|would give 5 stars if it had more levels.  they just added tilt controls which has increased my enjoyment immensely.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|This transparent case fits well and goes well visually with a white iPhone4. Design texture is good and the material is gripy and hence will not slip from hands or car dashboards unless you drive like me. TPU material is water white and not of a yellow tint. Very happy with it!
B0015AARJI|5.0|The product is still very good, especially the shock effect. However the build quality is not the same. I am replacing my original controllers after 4 years of extensive usage since the buttons are starting to malfunction. However I can clearly make out the difference in the build quality.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|Ok, i'm a HUGE fan of Firefly.    That should really be enough I suppose. However, let's go into it a bit more.    This is a great film. I'd already seen it in the cinema when it came out and as soon as I saw it was out on Blu-Ray, I had to get it. This is an awesome version! Great quality, the sound beats out and is just an all-round awesome experience.    Now, the only thing left to say. Bring back Firedly!
1586487981|5.0|Banerjee and Dulfo's research on development economics has helped launch a quiet revolution in our understanding of the poor and how to best help them.  Undeniably, their work (along with many co-authors) has been tremendously influential both in academic circles and with government donors, NGOs, and the governments of developing countries.  This book represents their attempt to condense the major findings of the last 20 years of research on the poor into a short, readable book, and to draw out the major themes and conclusions of this work.  On these grounds alone the book is a must-read for anyone with an interest, personal or professional, in the condition of the poorest people in the world and what might be done to help them.  Whether or not you agree with Banerjee and Dulfo's methodology or their interpretation of their results, this book is an excellent introduction to a school of economics that promises to remain influential for the forseeable future.    On a more substantive level, I found the arguments in the book highly compelling (although I must reveal that I know the authors personally and have studied under them at MIT).  The book's great strength is its balance between documenting the diversity of factors that affect the lives of the poor, while at the same time highlighting a few clear conclusions and policy recommendations.  This is not a polemic; the authors have no single overwhelming agenda, unless it is to document that the poor are much like everyone else except that their lives are harder.  Each chapter illuminates one way in which the poor face extreme challenges in their daily lives and the ways in which these challenges may perpetuate their poverty.
1936719118|5.0|I loved this little book! It's really easy to read, there's no fat or filler, and it gets straight to the point. Derek's insights are wonderfully clear and they leave you with a GREAT mindset for doing the work you really want to do.     I was really delighted by this. I think it might be my favorite from the Domino Project so far.
0812550757|5.0|Orson Scott Card's Speaker for the Dead is quite a different story from Ender's Game, but it's a great one. The setting is new, the characters are mostly all new and Ender is 3,000 years older (sort of). Unlike the first book, my favorite parts of this book have almost nothing to do with Ender. Rather, I'm all about the aliens in this one.    Much of this story takes place before Ender even arrives, which gives the reader a great chance to acclimate to the new surroundings. We are now on the planet Lusitania and we're even further in the future. There are so many new and wonderful human characters in this book and each has their own separate identity; I both loved and hated most of them. (I think I also picked up a bit of Portuguese from reading this book!)    The alien characters, aka the \\"Piggies\\" are extremely complex and mysterious while at the same time very lovable. Never could I have imagined reading a book in which I care so much about the aliens (maybe more than the people!). Perhaps the best thing about this book is that no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't figure out the twist at the end so it was a real and unpredictable surprise ending which I love.    I really loved this book - it's one of those books you wish didn't have to end. If you've read Ender's Game and loved it, I think you''ll love this one, too.    [Side note: I have read the next two in the series, but my advice is that if you want to remember the good times, stop after Speaker for the Dead and that way you can always think of Ender fondly.]
B0050CQY1W|4.0|I am very pleased with this record.  Beyonce kinda lost me for a while with some of the tracks on I Am...Sasha Fierce, but I hung in there; truly a fan.  she has certainly redeemed herself in 4.  Like many other reviewers stated, it is reminiscent of Dangerously in Love.  If you have doubts, get it; you will be glad you got it!!
B004TJ1H3C|1.0|Once again, lacking patience and with only an eye on the bottom line, Syfy (or SciFi, or NBC Universal, or whatever) has cancelled a series that required development and did not provide immediate gratification/fulfillment.  The ads want you to believe they support quality TV, but SyFy's actions say otherwise.    SGU was not everyone's cup of tea.  Regardless, it was good TV.  Imaginative, thought-provoking, different.  And in current SyFy tradition, now cancelled.    So as a PSA, here's a short summation of how I see SysFy and its relationship to the channels' shows' fan bases -    \\"Battlestar Galactica\\" - under pressure throughout and barely makes it to the end; fans screwed because we could never be sure we would get a complete story.  \\"Caprica\\" - brilliant - cancelled before it can get out of the starting blocks; again, fans screwed.  \\"Stargate Atlantis\\" - cancelled before the envisioned end; fans screwed.  \\"Stargate Universe\\" - really on the way up and destroyed by the network before it could get going; fans screwed.    \\"Firefly\\" not picked up by SyFy; fan base established and ready to support SyFy.  Nope - fans screwed.  \\"Defying Gravity\\" - hung out to dry by ABC leaving an amazed and distraught audience; fan base established and ready to support SyFy.  Nope - fans screwed - not picked up by SyFy (which it probably could have had for a song).    Don't be surprised when \\"Eureka,\\" \\"Warehouse 13,\\" and \\"Haven\\" get the boot (or become ridiculous parodies of their earlier selves. For instance, \\"Sanctuary\\").  Fans - get ready to be screwed.    Instead, what does the channel that promotes itself as the imagination channel give us?  MMA fighting, 10-year lame, failed series reruns, really bad Saturday night \\"blockbuster\\" (sarcasm) original movies, and ridiculous paranormal reality shows.    I'm done with SyFy.  Won't spend another dime on your DVDs, won't watch the channel (live or DVR'd).  I cancelled my magazine subscription.  You screwed us; well, right back at ya.Good-bye and good riddance.    Bronx cheer.

030014332X|1.0|When I read the blurbs on the back of this book, I expected an interesting telling of history with some insights that would have been new to me. What I discovered, after I had bought it and opened it, that it was written for children. Very nice for children; however, if adults find this book interesting and educational, their knowledge of history is sorely lacking, and their willingness to have it told to them as it would be told to fourth graders is astonishing. If you're interested in this book, let me give you a representative quote: \\" In England, King Henry VIII was on the throne. He had married Catherine of Aragon...but he didn't like her. He wanted to marry her lady-in-waiting,Anne Boleyn, instead...It wasn't long before Henry was tired of Anne as well, so he had her beheaded. Eleven days later he remarried, but that wife died before he could have her executed. He divorced the fourth and married a fifth, whom he also had beheaded. The sixth outlived him.\\" If you think that 284 pages of this sort of stuff will be worth the price of this book, good luck to you. I happen to believe that reading history as written for adults is more congenial.

0316098329|3.0|I really enjoyed the book up until the midpoint where their circumstances change, it should have ended there. I just didn't buy the character's actions in the rest of the book. I found the way the boy spoke annoying because it wasn't accurate. His mother spoke to him normally and he had television, he wouldn't have spoken so affectedly. And their part two reactions just didn't ring true, especially the pills incident. No way she would have done that, or recovered from it so quickly and easily if she had. She goes from doting mother to pawning the kid off on anyone, I just didn't buy it.
0300169787|5.0|I'm sure my obsession with this book is partly due to the fact that I got it at the Met just a few weeks ago, after seeing the actual exhibit.  Which, for the record, was breathtaking.  Literally.  As for the book, though, it is very well-done and it still hasn't made it to my bookshelf, I keep looking through it whenever I have a minute.  It's got a nice bunch of quotes by the artist himself, and the interview with Sarah Burton at the end makes an interesting read.  Best purchase ever.

B0056BMK6K|5.0|John Locke is the real deal. He really has sold well over a million e-books on Kindle (I got the KDP newsletter that reported the exact number). And he tells you how he did it in this book. In great detail. He doesn't hold back. He is honest and believable. He has confidence and moxie, not arrogance. Big difference. He doesn't wait for a tailwind to let him know the time is right. He doesn't worry about your approval to be a success. So I trust him. He is one of my new heroes. I loved the book.

The score of Love Never Dies is so captivating, the story so thrilling, that I have listened to it several times a day since I received it, crying every single blessed time. The vocalists/actors who play The Phantom, Christine, and Meg are really just sort of unbelievable in the sweep and delivery of their lines/songs.  These are amazing talents, and I look forward to hearing more from them.      I made my daughter sit through both CDs, and she said, \\"Mom, it just doesn't get me where I live.\\"  Hmmmm.  She's 17 years old.  By the by, where does she live?  There are those who don't like the story being tampered with.  Heck, All I Ask of You was sung at my wedding 20 years ago.  But truth be told, the Phantom was always sexier and more compelling than Raoul.  I think the problem is in the original version.  Gasp!  Every woman I know loved the Phantom and deep down wanted Christine to be with him.  That story was so very old, and the characters were not really very well developed.    Here's what I would change:  the ending.  I mean, come on, Sir Lloyd-Webber! We need a happy ending.  Honestly, we do.  And if you do make any changes, you may want to write a song for the Phantom that describes how he's changed over the 10 years.  Maybe that would make it more believable to those who can't let go of the old Phantom.
B000003TA4|5.0|It's a sobering thought when you realize that this album is now 20 years old.  I was a sophomore in high school when this came out and at the time, I wasn't that crazy about it.  I liked \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" and \\"Come As You Are\\", but that was about it.  All I knew was that within a year, girls started wearing flannel shirts and combing their hair straight, and all of the guys quit trying to learn \\"Eruption\\" on their guitars and started bashing out distorted power chords.  I didn't like Nirvana (or any of the \\"grunge\\" bands) very much when they first came out, but as time went on, I really began to understand just how important they were to rock music.  They changed everything.  Hair bands were never really that cool, and for the better part of 10 years, we were stuck with pointy guitars, Marshall stacks, and boys that dressed up like girls.  Some of the music, like Guns 'n Roses, was very good, but most of it was over-the-top, cheesy and wasn't really anything any common person could relate to.  When Kurt Cobain's distorted power chords first shot out of our speakers, we knew that something different was happening.  Most of us didn't know what the lyrics were, and we didn't care.  Rock music was taken out of the coke-infused culture of '80's Los Angeles, and put back in the hands of common people everywhere.  No more spandex, no more Aqua Net, and no more two-handed tapping guitar solos on every video that MTV played.  I help out with the youth group band at my church, and kids who weren't even born until after Kurt's death love Nirvana.  Those are the riffs that they're always playing when I walk into the practice room.  Nirvana is still cool, and rightfully so.  Whether you love this album or hate it, it's importance, both musically and culturally, cannot be overstated.
0307716511|5.0|Highly compelling and totally riveting!     Sister is an engrossing, emotional thriller touching on devotion, betrayal, self-absorption, madness, and grief. It keeps you wondering just how unraveled Bee is going to become and wondering what really happened to Tess. The story is cleverly plotted and fast paced. Bee is the responsible sister and Tess is an impulsive free spirit who sees the beauty in the world around her. When Beatrice learns that her beloved sister has disappeared, she rushes home to London. But when the police find young Tess's body, everyone seems ready to accept it as suicide. Everybody, that is, but Beatrice. While bureaucracy stands in her way, she leaves the rules behind and goes in search of the truth. Her search and discoveries blend romance, politics, and science in surprising ways. When everyone is sure that her pursuit of Tess's killer is a delusion, she has to nurture that so-called delusion to unlock the truth. This selective turn of the head gives her a vivid personality. The book is highly compelling and totally riveting. The writing is excellent.
1936719118|4.0|\\"In the end, it's about what you want to be, not what you want to have.\\"    If you agree with that statement (I think my favorite quote from this book), you need to read this book.  If you're looking for inspiration.   If you're afraid of failure.   If you want to start something.   You need to read this book.    \\"Don't pursue business just for your own gain. Only answer the calls for help.\\"    Derek Sivers, founder of CD Baby shares his success and his failures in this remarkably straight forward and honest book about how he basically accidentally founded a remarkably successful internet company - long before the internet bubble and without knowing anything about it.    I read this book in a couple of quick subway rides, to and from work. Don't be fooled by its ease, though. While you'll zoom through it, you'll close it feeling inspired and ready to start something new and, most importantly, you'll close it feeling less afraid of failure and less self-conscious about doing what makes you happy in life.    One more favorite quote: \\"... if you think true love looks like Romeo and Juliet, you'll overlook a great relationship that grows slowly.\\" Revolution - in business and in life - often starts with a small step.     This book will help you remember that.
B0034G4P8U|5.0|The most technologically astounding film franchise concludes with its strongest and finest installment. This movie truly is \\"More than meets the eye.\\" In 2007 Michael Bay brought to life the war between the Autobots and the Decepticons added in with the human touch of a teenage boy getting his first car. Transformers truly has been my favorite movie since the day I saw it, and then in 2009 the Transformers returned to the big screen in a very critically bashed sequel, that I still found to be just as fun as the first. Transformers Dark of the Moon is so different than the first two installments in every way. Making it more serious, dark and overall believeable and enjoyable. I dont think I must adress the effects because Transformers fan or not you cant deny that the effects raise the bar for what had been seen in a film. Michael Bay has made his masterpiece film, attempting things that have never been thought of before. Some parts in the movie will make you want to think they are digital effects, but in fact many of the shots are genuine. The soldiers diving out of planes flying through the city of Chicago in their own flight suits was real. Unlike the plot line of the first film, you have many human elements to the story line but still keeping it otherworldly. The plot twists major events from throughout history such as the moon landing, explaining that the space race between the United States and The USSR was to investigate a detected crash that turns out to be the flagship of the Autobots. These events held from Optimus and the other Autobots from the first film. The plot ties together very well, and features so many classic 60's sci-fi elements. On the note of the Transformers, like in the second movie there are new Autobots on Earth, but it is explained how they got there. Robot characters each have there own good amount of screen time and dialogue. Instead of delivering one liners in the second film. The movie has some great big name actors introduced into the series, such as Patrick Dempsey and John Malkovich. True Malkovichs character was as unneeded as Leo in the second film, but surprisingly Dempsey was great, SPOILER Humans are working with the decepticons, Dempsey is the great, badass playboy millionaire that he needs to be. Sentinal Prime voiced by the all time legendary Leonard Nimoy. Sentinal is my new favorite character of the Transformers franchise. He just has a great tone to him and he was beautifully designed. I was worried that the events of the second film would not continue on into the third, yet the Matrix of Leadership plays as a major key point. Adressing the whole Megan Fox is gone, a Transformers movie is not a Transformers movie because of whatever hot brain dead female actor they throw in for eye candy. Yet Rosie is much different that Megans character, she is much more confident and putting aside who looks better than who she does have a much brighter acting career ahead of her than Fox, she is a plot point and is in fact needed to the story. The film opens with some light comedy, that is actually very funny and easy to laugh out loud at. Wheter your immeressed in the Transformers mythos or not there is no denying that this is easily one of the best times you will have in the theater. This movie makes the first two look like mere commercials for this epic adventure. I feel my review is very cliché using words such as epic and amazing but there is simply no other way to put it that I just watched to most enjoyable film of my life, and is by far my favorite movie along side the first Transformers. Easily an 11/10

030746363X|5.0|I've been struggling to lose just 10 pounds for my wedding since January using my diet and exercise method that lost me 50 pounds, but after month after month of disappointment, I said, okay, Ferriss, give me the goods!  I have followed the slow carb diet and taken 5 cold showers since last Wednesday (1 week, folks), and I have dropped 8 of those stubborn pounds already.  If you need to shed pounds, try it!  And please try it before you consider any of those terrible surgical solutions!  Also, I have continued my usual hour long workouts (dance, pilates or kettlebells with Bob Harper), but I have cut them back to every other day.  The one thing that may have skewed my results slightly is my friend's wedding on Friday, during which I danced hard for about 2.5 hours straight...but it was also cheat day, and I had cupcakes and vodka to keep me moving.  :)    The other experiments he discusses are fun.  If you are a science nerd, you will enjoy this book, and you will be motivated to be a guinea pig for a while yourself.  Also, to those who think those early reviews are fake reviews, **NEWS FLASH**, people get advanced copies.  I looked at the reviews months ago and thought, oh, yeah, it's a load of crap, surely it won't work, surely it is indeed \\"snake oil\\" as one reviewer puts it, but my scale doesn't lie...and I don't lie.  I'm sorry that I put more faith in the negative nellys back then...I could have already lost 20 or 30 pounds by now!
B003UESJEM|4.0|A very relevant small movie about a group of men let go from a company.  The men are all late 30s and older.  The trouble they go through and the suffering is all very relevant.  Quiet, soft spoken and true.  Not a movie to spend a date night but one that needed to be made, especially when small movies aren't made very often in Hollywood anymore.  Every actor is just right and there is not grandstanding to be had.

B001FB55H6|3.0|The filmmakers behind Watchmen faced the difficulty encountered by all brave souls who endeavor to adapt a much-loved work of literature to the screen: how to rearrange the narrative to a filmic structure of approximately two hours.  Those who practice the relatively new task of adapting graphic novels face an additional challenge: how to interpret visually what has already been interpreted.  Though a literary work will often have precise visual descriptions of the narrative's world, there are scores of equally valid possible interpretations of Tolkien's Middle Earth or Dickens's London.  The challenge faced by adaptors of graphic novels is that the narrative is already laid out for them frame by frame.  When the graphic novel is not widely read before the release of the film (such as in the cases of Ghost World or Road to Perdition), this poses less of a problem to the filmmaker.  But with a work as widely read and beloved as Watchmen, it is as if a filmmaker's storyboards were devoured and studied by the public years before the release of the film.  Though it would still be a treat to those who have viewed the storyboards to see the film, much of the visual impact would be stripped away.  Such is Watchmen's cross to bear.    Watchmen has long been thought of as an \\"unfilmable\\" work, in the same category as scores of novels with long, interweaving plotlines, shifting narratives, and challenging themes.  Zack Snyder used the clout he gained from directing 300 to tackle the challenge, and he has turned in an admirable effort.  Those who have loved Alan Moore's creation for two decades (check time) understandably expected the worst: a soulless superhero film devoid of the numerous mature themes of the original (see the adaptation of Alan Moore's The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen) Snyder exhibits a strong appreciation of these themes, and valiantly attempts to pack in as many as possible in the film's bloated 162 minute running time.     It is this very dedicationto the original that gets Snyder into trouble.  While staying faithful to a masterpiece is rarely a bad strategy for adaptation, Snyder fails to offer much in his screen adaptation that was not present in the original graphic novel.  While he has made changes to the narrative, some significant, had a director offered a perfectly faithful interpretation, the emotional and intellectual impact of the film would be much the same.     What is particularly discouraging is that early in the film, Snyder shows a moment of extreme engagement with the original work while using the medium of film to differentiate his work from the original.  After the opening scene, the opening credits offer a beautifully shot and edited alternate history of a world with the film's characters, set to Bob Dylan singing \\"Times They Are A'Changin'.\\"  While the original work slowly allows the reader into the alternate universe, allowing the discovery of the differences in the story's world to unfold throughout the graphic novel, Snyder yanks the viewer into the world in the length of time it took Bob Dylan to redefine popular music.  This suits the filmic medium well, and offers the film a promising start, but for the rest of the film's runtime, Snyder is unable to match either the kinetic energy or the original interpretation of the credit sequence.    Alan Moore has never been happy with a film adaptation of any of his works, and I suspect he is the least unhappy with Watchmen, as Snyder shows a reverence for and understanding of the original missing in other interpretations of his work.  But while he may have kept Mr. Moore and die-hard fans of the original mollified, he did a disservice to the work by offering audiences little that could not be gained by a re-read of the graphic novel.  It is difficult in adaptation to be faithful to an original without being reverent, to honor it without it becoming an albatross.  While the initial thrill of seeing the beautifully rendered Dr. Manhattan, theflowing mask of Rorschach, and Watchmen's countless other iconic visuals is great, Snyder's decision to use the original as little more than a storyboard does a disservice to the revolutionary spirit of the original, and makes the adaptation of Watchmen something that the original never could be: boring.

B00003CXXS|1.0|What happens when you put a group of second-rate filmmakers together on an island, give them an enormous budget, and provide them with one of the most valuable film franchises of all time? You realize just how brilliant Steven Spielberg is.    \\"Jurassic Park III\\" is simply a pointless movie that never should have been made. The film simply reeks of a cheap sequel. The basic plot tells of a couple who tricks Dr. Alan Grant to take them into Jurassic Park after their son is lost on the island while parasailing. Predictably, all hell breaks loose as the dinosaurs continue to wreak havoc. Unfortunately, in all of this havoc there is not a single moment of decent dialogue, acting, directing, or special effects. The filmmakers seem to have interpreted the original \\"Jurassic Park\\" as a horror film, and treat this movie as such. Characters die in a timely and organized fashion, characters attempt to separate in order to be \\"more effective,\\" and so forth. The original \\"Jurassic Park\\" was not a horror film, and this movie should not have been treated as such.    I doubt that many people had high expectations for \\"Jurassic Park III\\" as a good film. Most probably thought the movie would simply be an enjoyable escape for an hour and a half with great special effects and a few memorable scenes. Yet somehow, even with a budget of approximately ninety million dollars, the movie's special effects were terrible. In the opening scene, I heard a kid behind me who couldn't have been older than eight turn to his mom and say \\"Mommy, that looks so fake.\\" If the special effects couldn't even make a child believe, how are they supposed to convince the rest of the public? Another huge weakness in this movie is the timing. One thing that made the original \\"Jurassic Park\\" great was the memorable scenes. I can instantly recall great scenes from the movie, such as the T-Rex chasing the Jeep at night, the young boy climbing the electric fence and getting electrocuted, and so forth. \\"Jurassic ParkIII\\" doesn't have any sense of timing, and as a result the film just feels like a bunch of scenes that bleed into each other without any rhyme or reason. A few moments in the movie could have actually been memorable scenes had they been timed correctly, but instead they are easily discarded and thought of as a joke. The lack of special effects and memorable scenes kills the possibility of \\"Jurassic Park III\\" even being an enjoyable excursion.    Yet through all the bad acting, poor writing, and mindless directing, the biggest weakness in the film is not as obvious. The filmmakers failed to realize what the original \\"Jurassic Park\\" was about. It was not simply a horror or action film in which the protagonists ran away from scary beasts. The film was an examination of man's role in nature and of how we view ourselves as the mighty rulers of the universe. While there were exciting chase scenes and great special effects, those were not the theme of the film. \\"Jurassic Park III\\" forgets all of this, and even occasionally mocks these themes in the original. If you took these themes away from the original film, all you would have had left would be a hollow horror film with great special effects. \\"Jurassic Park III\\" is simply a hollow horror film with mediocre special effects. \\"Jurassic Park\\" is a story about man; \\"Jurassic Park III\\" is a story about dinosaurs. That is the primary difference between the two films.    One would have thought that with the budget and the resources the filmmakers had, they could have produced a better movie than \\"Jurassic Park III.\\" Instead, the movie is a reminder of \\"Jaws,\\" another amazing Spielberg film that had sequels made by different directors that were subsequently mindless waste. While \\"Jurassic Park II\\" was not a great film by any means, it at least understood the original and tried to carry on it's themes. \\"Jurassic Park III\\" does none of that, and as a result is simply rubbish that should definitely be avoided.

0553386794|5.0|Journey to Westeros for the first time, with A Game of Thrones, but beware for winter is coming. In the first of George R. R. Martin's landmark, epic fantasy series, A Song of Ice and Fire, readers will be introduced to a complex world of many lands and many families, with many characters, but have no fear for Martin tells the story from unique viewpoints of different members of different families, forcing the reader to fit the different pieces of the story together, creating the overall puzzle of plot.  Readers will be reminded of everything they love about great fantasy stories, whether they be simple or epic; as well as discovering why George R. R. Martin has earned the title of the \\"American Tolkien.\\"<br /><br />In the world of Westeros, there are Seven Kingdoms, long ago independent, now united under the Iron Throne, but those named king never seem to last long in this world of corrupt, power-hungry families.  There are two main families which readers are first introduced to: the Starks and the Lanisters, emulating the Wars of the Roses with the Yorks and Lancasters.  With the Starks there is proud and strong Ned, who is to be the King's Hand to Robert Baratheon, and his determined and caring wife, Catelyn.  The sons are Rob, the eldest, Jon Snow, a bastard, Bran who suffers a debilitating accident, and Rickon who is too young to really understand what is going on.  The daughters are Sansa, who is a young, fair maiden always looking for her knight in shining armor to whisk her off her feet; and Arya, who is boyish and wants to learn how to fight with a sword, ride a horse into battle, and defend herself.  The Lannisters are a different type of family, constantly looking for gain whether it is with land, riches, or power.  At the head of the household is the aging Lord Tywin, with his children: the beautiful, blond and blue-eyed Jaime and his twin Cersei - who share much more than a sibling affection - and little Tyrion, a dwarf who has had to fight for everything in his entire life.  Cersei is wife to the king, Robert Baratheon, and together they have young Joffrey, heir to the throne, along with Tommen and Myrcella.<br /><br />While tension builds between the families at King's landing, far to the north lies the Wall - 700 feet tall and 300 miles long, protecting the Seven Kingdoms from the evils of the far north.

0439023521|5.0|I'm in 7th grade and never intended on reading this book until my best friend who is the biggest Jabberjay I'd ever met (in case you didn't know, Jabberjay is what extreme Hunger Games fans are called) made me. If you've never met a 13 year old girl, you should know that they can be VERY persuasive. But as soon as I read the first chapter, I was completely hooked! I think the whole thing is amazing and I loved the whole romance between Katniss and Peeta, who are honestly the best characters in this entire series. I was so intrigued in reading this book, I became obsessed with reading it! I read all 3 books in 2 days! It was definately a spine-tingling, exhillerating book that keeps you wanting more.        The story is based in a country called Panem in the future after North American fails. The country consists of 12 Districts and a Capitol. In the past, the Districts attempted to overthrow the Capitol, but lost. As a concequence of losing the war against the Capitol, each year a boy and a girl from each District from the age 12 to 17 would be choosen from a ballot to compete in the national \\"Hunger Games.\\" In the Hunger Games, the 24 children are forsed to fight to the death until only one remains, becoming the Victor. When 16 year old Katniss Everdeen's 12 year old sister, Prim, is chosen from the ballot, she volenteers in fear for her sister so she can prevent her from dying. Peeta Mellark, the bakers son, is the boy Tribute from District 12, and will go in the Games with Katniss.          After the \\"74th Annual Hunger Games\\" begin, the judge announces that the Tributes from the same Districts are allowed to work with one another, if still alive. Katniss and Peeta, who have formed a romance, work together until (spoiler!!!) they are the only 2 left. But instead of them winning as a team, the judge announces that the rules have been changed back and there can only be 1 Victor. But the 2 District 12 Tributes have decided that they cannot live without one another and don't want to be treated like \\"a piece in the Capitol's games\\". Will Katniss win and Peeta die? Will Peeta win and Katniss die? Or will they both eat the poisionous berries called \\"Nightlock\\" that they found so that they can be together forever? Read Suzanne Collins's \\"The Hunger Games\\" to find out, and... \\"May The Odds Be Ever In Your Favor!\\"
0061784788|4.0|James Rollins' latest book, The Devil Colony, does everything a thriller should with a compelling storyline, travel to exotic and unusual places, elements of the fantastic, and lots and lots of action.  Rollins describes his novels as rollercoaster rides, which The Devil Colony may well be, and reveals this author's storytelling and writing abilities at their very best.<br /><br />In this new SIGMA Force novel, Rollins blends some shocking and relatively unknown American history with cutting edge science that defies the mind.  Deep within the Rocky Mountains of Utah an incredible discovery is made of Native American mummies buried in a cave beneath the ground, as well as a number of priceless gold artifacts with some very strange ancient writing on them that doesn't seem to be Native American.  As the artifacts are brought to the surface, a terrible explosion rips through the air, causing a number of deaths.  Thought to be an act by a radical Native American group, the truth is revealed to be far more dooming as some unusual activated element has been brought to the surface and seems to be eating through matter of any kind with no end in sight.<br /><br />The SIGMA Force are called in to investigate, with Painter Crowe who is looking to help his niece - who has become tied up in the whole catastrophe - however he can, while Commander Grayson Pierce does his own research with some help from the beautiful and enigmatic Seichan.  This mystery will take them from the mountains of Utah to the volcanoes of Iceland to the impenetrable vaults of Fort Knox to the renowned geysers of Yellowstone.  It will also take them one important step closer to the ancient and secretive order known as the Guild, until it is realized that far more is at risk when a geological chain reaction is set in motion that could have devastating effects for the entire planet.<br /><br />While The Devil Colony certainly seems to push the boundaries of the conventional thriller, Rollins is careful to back up his incredible storylines with meticulous historical and scientific research, which he goes into detail with in his foreword and afterword, as he does his best to explain to readers the story behind the ultimate question of this book: Was America founded on a lie?

055357342X|4.0|The A Song of Ice and Fire series was originally intended as a trilogy, but as George R. R. Martin became fully imbrued with his epic fantasy series, the trilogy became four books, then five, and has finally (hopefully) stopped at seven.  As for the lengths of the books, these have also continued to grow, with the hardcover of A Game of Thrones reaching 704 pages, followed by A Clash of Kings at 768 pages.  A Storm of Swords is Martin's longest effort to date, reaching a whopping 992 pages.  While this manuscript could've certainly used editing, with some character tangents going on for too long, hooked fans at this point are firm believers of the adage \\"the longer the better.\\"  Plus, can you really call it \\"epic fantasy\\" if it's not over seven hundred pages long?    To the north Jon Snow has infiltrated the wildings, looking to get close to Mance Rayder, the king-beyond-the-wall, and find out when they plan to attack the Night's Watch, but he will find his loyalties challenged as he must fight and decide where his allegiances lie.  Then there is the storyline of Bran, one of the Stark children, who is traveling to the north to find his brother.  Theon Greyjoy now controls Winterfell through lies, deception and competing against his more popular sister for the love and support of his father, King Balon Greyjoy.  Meanwhile, Arya Stark continues to get pulled back and forth from bad character to worse character, but because of her smarts and cunning she is able to scrape through alive.  Jaime Lannister is let go to travel back to King's Landing under the protection of Brienne of Tarth with the hope that the Lannisters will free Sansa Stark.    As for the war, things are not going well, but then that really depends on whose side you're on.  Robb Stark continues to win battles but make little headway in the war, but after falling for a girl who looks after him when he is wounded and marries her, he must meet with the Freys to soothe their relations.  His uncle, Edmure Tully, will wed one of the Frey daughters and all will be well, it is hoped.  Robb's mother, Catelyn, doesn't trust Lord Walder Frey, as she travels with her son, grieving over the loss of her father.  But the Tully's have something fiendish in store for them.  Meanwhile in King's Landing Joffrey rules in his cruel, childish way, while his uncle Tyrion, the dwarf, continues to fight with his sister, Joffrey's mother, Cersei; then their father, Lord Tywin, arrives to upset the balance and organize things in his own way.    Far to the east, Daenerys Targaryen returns to Pentos by sea in search of an army.  She finds one in the Unsullied, a slave army, but she must give over one of her dragons for the thousands of slaves.  Daenerys has a plan and soon has her army which she immediately frees from slavery, making them unstoppable soldiers who will never defy an order.  As she travels across the land, looking to grow her army and power and create peace among these peoples, she discovers two of her closes retinue are traitors and must decide what she will do with them.    A Storm of Swords is Martin at his best, as the events and actions that have been building in the previous books are brought to a harsh fruition, and the author continues to reveal what makes his series so unique.  Some character storylines go on for too long and could use some heavy editing to shorten them down, or perhaps have been cut entirely as little seems to happen, while others are simply riveting, even when involving two character viewpoints covering the same event.  At the end, just as with the first two books, readers will be left impatiently wanting more.    Originally written on April 10, 2011 ©Alex C. Telander.

0316069353|3.0|This is the fourth book I've read by Connelly and the second that I think was just okay.  It's interesting that he is taking advantage of all the foreclosure news.  The twist ending was a surprise.
0553582038|3.0|Readers of the first three A Song of Ice and Fire books - A Game of Thrones, A Clash of Kings, and A Storm of Swords - will notice a trend with them: the page count is steadily increasing with each book.  It seems like there must be a breaking point when it simply won't be possible to bind that many pages into one book . . . well, that's exactly what happened with the fourth book of A Song of Ice and Fire.  George R. R. Martin was given an ultimatum from his publisher that the book needed to be divided into multiple volumes.  The resulting A Feast for Crows only features a limited number of the main characters readers have become familiar with in the earlier books, as well as a number of newer ones as further lands and parts of Westeros are explored and revealed for the first time.    The War of the Five Kings is coming to a close, as many of the rulers readers have come to know are now dead, or fled for their lives.  King Tommen now rules at King's Landing, though under the guise of his mother, Cersei Lannister, who has finally gotten her lifelong wish to rule the realm.  She fills her cabinet with loyal elders who soon fail in their duty and she becomes ferociously angry, suspecting and suspicious of everyone, driving herself to incessant drinking.  Then there is Margaery Tyrell, who is married to her son, the king, who she believes is looking to take over the realm as queen and do goodness knows what.    Meanwhile, Jaime has had enough of his sister and leaves to make what reparations he can to the kingdom, to regain control over the Riverlands in the name of Lannister and the realm.  Brienne is in search of Sansa, to free her from whatever perils she is in, fulfilling an oath she promised.  In the Eyrie, Sansa remains seemingly trapped by Littlefinger who conducts himself in a very strange way with her.  In the Iron Islands, the king Balon Greyjoy is dead by a freak accident, and now begins the long and laborious process of choosing a successor, as Balon's children come home to claim the throne, including his tough and determined daughter, Asha.  Far to the south, in the lands of Dorne, unrest is stirring as new contenders look to play a part in taking the throne, through Myrcella Baratheon who is told she has every right to the throne as her brother Tommen does.  Finally to the east is Arya who is learning and training in the ways of the people of Braavos, while Samwell Tarly travels on his own journey to Oldtown to become the new Maester for the Night's Watch, and travels to Braavos along the way, meeting with Arya.    It seems after the third book, A Storm of Swords, Martin made some big decisions for his series that were not necessarily good ones.  While A Feast for Crows took five years to be written, it is only half the intended book, with a number of new characters and lands that come as a surprise to the reader who has not been introduced to them before.   Then there is the long plodding storyline of Brienne's search for Sansa, which is made pointless when the reader already knows exactly where she is - the Eyrie; not to mention Jamie's and Samwell's ceaseless traveling that gets them absolutely nowhere fast.  And finally, Cersei is reduced to an inkling of her former powerful character, as she becomes a suspicious, spiteful, angry joke.    Nevertheless, some important story is told in A Feast for Crows, as the characters - at least the  interesting ones - are moved along, setting up for the next book and rest of the characters in A Dance With Dragons, originally intended a year or so after this book, and is now finally being released on July 12, six years later.

B004SBX112|1.0|The summer addon does't work... keeps kicking  me out  when I click on the 1st stage. Reinstalled 3 times... Wish I never updated it..
B004R63MWQ|5.0|Coming from the generation that knew about the first Tron movie and having formerly owned a Tron video game myself, I think this movie was an awesome followup!  I would love to see more like this!
B0050CQY1W|5.0|LET'S JUST SAY BEYONCE DID HER THANG WITH \\"4\\"...BEFORE YOU BLOW THE ABLUM OFF REALLY LISTEN TO IT WHICH MEANS PLAY THE SONG OVER AT LEAST 3 TIMES BECAUSE SHE REALLY PUT HER ALL INTO IT. THEN ON TOP OF THAT IT CAN EITHER HELP YOUR RELATIONSHIP OR EITHER HELP YOU GET OVER ONE ENOUGH SAID MY FAVES SONGS ARE..<br /><br />1. 1+1 - PLAYED IT SO MUCH THAT MY 2 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER KNOWS THE LYRICS..<br />2. MISS YOU- ON REPEAT RIGHT NOW!<br />3.BEST THING I NEVER HAD- TAKES ME WAY BACK (OLDMEMORIES ) LOVE IT.<br />4.START OVER- DEEP REALLY HAVE YOU QUESTION YOURSELF OR YOUR MATE.<br />5. PARTY- ANDRE 3000 KNOW HE GOES IN!!!!
B0050CQY1W|5.0|So far this is the best R&B mixed with house music she made. I love the live band and her producers.   She did good here.
1401310400|4.0|This is not a thinking book, but if you like Castle the tv series, you will like this read. It is funny and quick, a great book to take on vacation.
0143118706|3.0|I understand that Eat, Pray, Love is probably a once in a lifetime book which is why so many people have read it or watched the movie. Since this book follows Eat, Pray, Love and is about the relationship we all fell in love with, I thought that it might be the same (or at least similar)...it is not. I don't really need a lesson on insitution of marriage, the history, what other cultures think about marriage, or why people today are so \\"anti\\" marriage. Give me the story...the romance, the amazingness that is Elizabeth Gilbert's writing style not a history lesson. If you want a history lesson with a pinch of Eat, Pray, Love read this...
B003X2O6KW|4.0|Let me start out as saying no I don't think this is better than Late Regristration (his best album) no, but it his Second best album. MBDTF is well put together I think its great that he and the other producers who worked on this album blended all the sounds he used on his previous works. I love the fact that this album has theme that revolves around excess and celebrity. I read some of the reviews and what I see the most is that people are saying he needs to go back to making music that sounds like his first two albums. He shouldn't because he if he kept putting out music that sounds the same. Yall would be saying all his work sounds the same and that he needs to try something new. Another thing that most of his critics say is that his lyrics are inconsistent because he will say something thats pretty dope then the next few lines aren't up to par. Now I am not saying that he his own the level as Lupe Fiasco and Nas (Just to name a couple), but even the greatest lyricist in the world can give you something amazing on every line for that matter on a whole album. So when Kanye says something like  Penitentiary chances, the devil dances  and eventually answers to the call of Autumn  all of them fallin' for the love of ballin'  got caught with 30 rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin  inter century anthems based off inner city tantrums  based off the way we was branded  face it, Jerome get more time than Brandon  and at the airport they check all through my bag and tell me that it's random  but we stay winning, this week has been a bad massage  I need a happy ending.  I think its pretty creative. Only a handfull of rappers can top that. When it comes to putting out good music Kanye is great at it From College Dropout to MBDTF its all been quality music. Remember Rolling Stone named him artist of the decade(2000-2010) for a reason!!!
B002X9W50E|5.0|David Bowie is an icon, and part of the reason for his lasting influence is his penchant for reinventing himself completely every few years. Many of these reinventions worked, and a few didn't; but that willingness to take chances has served Bowie well over the years. Whether you first met David Robert Jones as the man making a psychedelic call to Major Tom, the man who sold the world hard rock in a dress and invented a new genre in the process, the androgynous alien rock star Ziggy Stardust, the cold, emaciated Thin White Duke, the minimalist artist of the Berlin period, the dance-pop titan behind Let's Dance, the ridiculously coiffed goblin king Jareth, the frontman of the skeletal, back-to-basics rock unit Tin Machine, the industrial-tinged rock experimenter of Earthling, or the somewhat less flamboyant but no less charismatic modern Bowie, chances are he left an impression. Those impressions, in many cases, extended to the landscape of music.    This live album is stunning in scope: 33 tracks covering almost every inch of his long career, and there's not a miss in the lineup. At the time of recording, Bowie was 56, and in stunningly good form. His voice has never sounded better, and he's an undeniable master showman. Whether you watch the DVD or listen to the album, it's impossible not to get into the spirit of the show. A few major hits are missing (fans may be bothered at the absence of Suffragette City and Space Oddity), but it's shocking how little they're missed in context, and perhaps even more shocking how neatly Bowie's more recent material slots in with the classics. The songwriting is strong enough that those unfamiliar with his catalog likely couldn't distinguish songs written in 1977 from those written in 1997 or 2002. But the setlist isn't important if the band doesn't have the chops to give it all it deserves, and Bowie and his backing band absolutely play the hell out of every song here. From the very beginning of the reworked Rebel Rebel, this isan album full of surprises and renditions that often surpass their studio counterparts to become the definitive live statement of a very long and often brilliant career.    I can't recommend this album highly enough. In my opinion, it's one of the best live documents to come out of the 2000s.
B004ULEEY8|4.0|There were a couple of horrific boners - the worst was \\"They have come to steal our water, noplace else in the universe has free water\\". I wish they had asked anybody that had an IQ above hat size about that one. Mostly, the special effect were first rate. The thing about making a big smoke ring just before crashing into the ocean was a little weird, but Hollywood always does something stupid and unneccessary. The marines were mostly realistic.
B003Y5H54W|4.0|Great cinematography, moderate plot, believable acting. But come on, it is little red riding hood. For sheer entertainment its a fantastic movie. For the people that dislike the movie, get over it, its a fairy tail. If anyone has ever actually read the original Brothers Grimm version, you'd have to give it at least a B+, for following the story line. This is a bit more realistic than \\"twilight\\" no pretty boys prancing here. If you liked this, you should watch Snow White A tale of Terror with Sigourney Weaver.
B002OEBMN4|5.0|World Painted Blood is their best album in years. Their previous album had a lot of potential also but personally, I like this way better. Most of the modern metal sound is gone which was consistent on their last few and it's closer to their thrash metal roots than \\"Christ Illusion\\". The songs are overall faster paced but there are some slower mid-tempo songs also like \\"Beauty Through Order\\" and \\"Americon\\". Their is more songwriting from Jeff Hanneman rather than Kerry King which is a better songwriter, if you don't agree than what about \\"Angel Of Death\\" or \\"War Ensemble\\". It's some solid thrash metal and it beats most of the modern metal out there today. It has some of their best songs like \\"Unit 731\\", \\"Hate Worldwide\\", \\"Not Of This God\\", \\"Snuff\\", \\"Psychopathy Red\\" and \\"Public Display Of Dismemberment\\".<br />In my opinion, it's one of the top 5 best albums of 2009 and Slayer's best since Seasons In The Abyss.
1936719118|4.0|This short and succinct book from CD Baby founder Derek Sivers is an excellent read for anyone facing decisions about how feed and care for your newfound company or project.    Derek explains the choices he made as his baby, CD Baby, grew up. From hiring practices to email order confirmations, everything Derek did was drawn from his priority of giving customers anything they wanted. When they wanted something different than he had in mind, he rolled with the punches and adapted.     Not everything worked out roses along the way, and Anything You Want includes some of Derek's mistakes and how he handled them. It's a great balance between encouraging and cautionary tales.    Overall, Anything You Want is a great balance against business books that primarily push for a focus on the bottom line and how to prepare for enormous growth. To Derek, if you do what you enjoy and keep your customers satisfied, they will take care of that growth for you.
B0057AOS3I|3.0|There is no question that Beyonce' has made a lot out of her last album, I Am Sasha Fierce, winning 5 Grammys for the album, and making a career-defining stance with Single Ladies. But with all the success she has had in her career, the pressure had mounted to see if she could really be able to duplicate what she had been able to do beofre with B'Day and Dangerously In Love. Well, with all the hype around her return, she had a dissapointing single with Run The World (Girls.) Now here is the real question, does Beyonce' hold her own against acts like Lady Gaga and Nicki Minaj in her return? Actually, the answer is absolutely no she does not.<br /><br />4, Beyonce's latest album feels more like a whatever happened to, from 3 years ago when she was on top of the world. Here, the songs doesn't feel like she really was able to do what she did before with I Am Sasha Fierce. Instead, the collection of songs feels more like a oddball from another lifetime. The album at times feels like it is more choppy on her songs like End Of Time, Run The World (Girls,) and a bit tired and exhausted on the ballads like 1+1. It just didn't feel like she was able to put her creative input into drive here, but instead as a trial of making you forget about Single Ladies. Even the other songs like Countdown, and Party with Andre 3000 from Outkast doesn't seem to fully drive the listener back in as much as it did before. Honestly, the songs just weren't meant to follow-up the success she even had on her beginnings of her solo work, and even her days with Destiny's Child bring in more of a positive joy than here.<br /><br />Overall, Beyonce's 4 is a album that feels more a crack in the sidewalk, than something that has been able to flow well. Unfortunately, for Beyonce', this album is absolutely to her what her idol the late Michael Jackson had with his final album before he died, 2001's Invincible, a waste on the ears. It might not be a bad buy for hard core Beyonce' fans, but honestly you absolutely do not get your money's worth on this album at all. Instead, I would absolutely recommend Jennifer Hudson's I Remember Me or even Whitney Houston's 2009 album I Look To You top and bottom. Those are both better albums for your money. It is honestly very sad that Beyonce' would lose out on re-establishing herself in the way she did before. If you are even new to Beyonce's music, 4 isn't the record to put where your mind can listen to it. For Beyonce' she might've tried to hit it out of the ballpark, but honestly this album isn't the best thing she has ever had in voice and spirit to master.<br /><br />Album Cover: B-<br /><br />Songs: C-<br /><br />Price: C<br /><br />Mastering: C+<br /><br />Overall: C-et your money's worth on this album at all.

0316056863|3.0|I laughed literally a few times while reading this. I'm disappointed overall, though. I thought Tina Fey was funnier. So much of the material in the book is just filler and kind of nonsensical and unfunny. It's choppy and could probably been edited down to a funny magazine article. Ouch.
B0050CQY1W|5.0|Beyoncé was on top of the world after releasing her third solo album \\"I Am... Sasha Fierce\\" in 2008. How she intended to follow that success was unknown, but she managed to do so with her most mature, emotionally deep, and sonically cohesive album to date! While it's true the track's on \\"4\\" might not be what we've come to expect from Beyoncé in the past, with this album she's sending us a clear message: Beyoncé cannot be defined!     As much as people will attempt to box her in and claim that \\"4\\" is going to flop commercially, its position on iTunes charts all around the world right now proves otherwise. While Run The World (Girls) was seen as a non-orthodox choice for a lead single, it was Beyoncé's message to the world that she's here to stay. On this album, as well, that message rings true! The way this album flows is truly magical. I will give each track a rating (out of 5) below, and I'll compile the scores to give an average (though overall I give the album a solid 5/5!)    1. 1+1 - [5/5]  2. I Care [4.9/5]  3. I Miss You [4.5/5]  4. Best Thing I Never Had [4.9/5]  5. Party (feat. André 3000) [3.8/5]  6. Rather Die Young [3.5/5]  7. Start Over [4.5/5]  8. Love On Top [4/5]  9. Countdown [5/5]  10. End of Time [4.7/5]  11. I Was Here [5/5]  12. Run The World (Girls) [4.7/5]    Overall: [4.5/5] - In other words, I definitely recommend purchasing this album! It's not in line with what's popular on the radio right now, but that's all the more reason to love it. As big a star as Beyoncé is, she took a risk releasing such a, for lack of a better phrase, \\"non-commercial\\" album, but if you give it a chance to grow on you, most of you will be enjoying it for years to come!
B000ETQR3Q|4.0|My son LOVES this toy.  Although we haven't had any trouble with this one my other son's did break.  The boys can spend hours have Nerf wars.  The Nerf \\"bullets\\" are easy enough to load and the Longshot does shoot a good distance.  Accuracy is okay given that the \\"bullet\\" is Nerf so is affected by being light-weighted and air.
0062060554|5.0|I have never written a book review before, but after reading some negative reviews, I felt like I had to stick up for this book and urge readers out there to, well, read this book!      I'm not going to go into detail about the plot, because I hope you will discover it for yourself, but I will say that it was like a breath of fresh air after reading the same old storylines and same old plots in so many books these days.  However, this book was so intriguing and unique.  It was quite different from any other book I have ever read and also quite hard to put down.  The characters were great, the plot was fascinating, and I was certainly sad when I realized the book was over.  So, I hope that helps and I would definitely reccommed this book!
B002C6A6N6|3.0|This is our favorite TV series ever. It's a shame, because the discs have flaws. We had 2 discs that wouldn't play right at all. And when I went back to replay the series, the first disc went bad too. Whatever happened to quality control?
B0006IIPIK|5.0|Sky Captain is an epic piece capturing the look and feel of early science fiction films.  It would have been a great serial to watch on Saturday mornings along with the  newsreel, two animated cartoons and a singing cowboy horse opera.  All the elements are there: the manly hero, his sidekick, the girl, the  villain.  Monster robots, and those great hovering aircraft carriers.  Watching it, I was 12 years old again.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|The money grubbing narcissitic greed wh*re George Lucas has once again ignored the multitude of Star Wars fans who have made him a billionaire and refused to include the far superior original theatrical releases on blu ray.  Instead we are subjected to his megalomanical unchecked \\"special editions\\" which in his sick twisted mind he believes are superior to the films that made him and were a worldwide phenomenon.  He hasn't created anything worth viewing in decades and he won't get my money again.
B00506NRBS|5.0|This little book by Derek Sivers is a quick, important read. I read an advanced copy on Kindle and am now picking up a copy for my library and some to share.<br /><br />It's the true story of how Derek grew his hobby into a multi-million dollar business. I walked away with practical tips to better manage my business and team -- and a revitalized commitment to doing work that matters in a way that makes me happy.<br /><br />Derek's passion - and his call to pursue your own passion in everything you do - will stay with you long after you turn the last page.<br /><br />Mollie Marti, JD, PhD<br />Author of \\"WALKING WITH JUSTICE: Uncommon Lessons from One of Life's Greatest Mentors\\"
B004A8ZX28|4.0|This one got me hook line and sinker.  The ending was a surprise.  I'm a fan or Liam's.  In book form this would be called a pager turner.  As in devouring the book not just reading it.  I watched it a second time to see if I missed anything.
B0035G04TI|2.0|The idea of love languages (basically, ways of expressing love) is useful, but in typical self-help style, the author makes it sound like this issue is the root cause of all marital difficulty.  I think the book could have been condensed to article length... to sum it up, realize that the ways that you want to show love to your spouse may not be the ways that they want you to show love.  Some people feel most loved when they get quality time, others feel most loved when you do acts of service (fixing things around the house, for example), and still others feel most loved through physical touch.  Enough said.
B0052OWGYW|4.0|The video suffered a lot in the download version.  Not to mention and I think I figured out why but my download took 3 days.  I think because my computer goes to sleep after an hour of no use that it was pausing my download.  But that sill doesn't explain the poor quality of the video.<br />I did like the move itself and that is what I am rating.  I liked the end better than the original with Charles Bronson and Jan Michael Vincent.<br />I now have another Hat I have to get.  LOL<br />I would recommend this move to a friend just not the downloaded version.
1936719118|5.0|Derek Sivers is a VERY likable guy and reading the story of his business success and advice is like getting it from your best friend.  I highly recommend this book---especially to entrepreneurs.  It's a quick read but the value isn't in its length, it's in the content.  If you only have a couple of takeaways to incorporate into your life I would suggest these:  \\"Never forget that absolutely everything you do is for your customers.\\"  If you do this you will succeed yourself.  Also a quote attributed to Steve Blank, \\"No plan survives first contact with customers.\\"  Oh, and do what you enjoy doing without too much regard for making money.

B0050LJIRK|2.0|By the time you get to the end of the Loser song, you'll either be pissed off and/or wondering WTF. I can't imagine who would want to listen to this album more than two times. For me, once was enough.
0671027344|4.0|I dont really know what makes this book so good. Maybe it's the fact that this boy is so messed up in the head, or the weridness of it. Whatever it is i think anyone will like it. Truthfully this isnt my type of book, but it seeemed to work out. If it would of had a different main character i might have hated it, but it didnt, So i loved it. :)

0553582038|1.0|Greed is spoiling this otherwise magnificent series.     Both author and editors are obviously stretching the story up to the limits of boredom.

B004A8ZX2I|4.0|This much IS known; Liam Neeson gives a terrific performance as confused biotechnology scientist Martin Harris who finds that someone has taken over his life when he is attending the Berlin biotechnology summit and not even his wife knows him. Based on a German bestseller \\"Unknown\\" is a clever thriller in the mold of something Hitchcock might have done in his prime.<br /><br />The Blu-ray looks extremely good with a nice, sharp transfer. The cool color scheme of the theatrical version of the film is kept intact for this version. The lossless audio sounds terrific as well and is very active.<br /><br />How much you enjoy \\"Unknown\\" is related to how much you can suspend your disbelief.<br /><br />The only special features on this edition are two featurettes one of the making of the film that examines the premise and another on actor Liam Neeson who lately has become something of an action hero with this film and \\"Taken\\". The deluxe edition also features a DVD edition of the movie. It's a pity there are no deleted scenes and no commentary track as it would have been interesting to see what didn't fit into the movie and hear what it took to adapt a convoluted thriller like this into a sleek, stylish audience friendly thriller.<br /><br />While it does share some elements of films like [[ASIN:B003H6KRIE The Bourne Trilogy (The Bourne Identity / The Bourne Supremacy / The Bourne Ultimatum) (Slim Packaging) [Blu-ray]]] in terms of having twists and turns in its plot that are somewhat unexpected, it is a very different thriller having more in common with [[ASIN:B00008R9KN Shattered]]or [[ASIN:0792844874 No Way Out]].<br /><br />\\"Unknown\\" is an enjoyable popcorn thriller.
B003Y74AZ2|5.0|What i love, is that no one has it haha and everyone asks me where do i get it, i just say, amazon.<br />looks good.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Cowboys in space.  Difficult to imagine and hard to pull of.  Yet Firefly pulls it off in aces.  Great story lines, great acting and lots of cliffhangers.  A great series and well worth watching prior to seeing the film Serenity.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|Does everything I need it to do. Much better than the stock calendar. Very flexible. Works well with numerous Google calendars simultaneously. HTC ThunderBolt
1881273873|5.0|This is an excellent book.  It help me understand how we all feel love different.  I have tried some of the suggestions and can see that the relationships are improving.
B003ZHQVJO|5.0|Bought this as a gift. Arrived in great time and was packaged excellently. From the person I gave it to, it's a wonderful album and a great gift.
B004SIP8MK|1.0|Besides being incredibly boring, I don't believe Uma Thurman could beat up a wood duck, much less the hundreds of victims she defeats in this move.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I thought overall this book was good.But I wish it would have explained Peeta and Katniss relationship more and not so much of the war and hiding it was pretty dissapointing I still want a sequel! Idk how that was a sequel but whatever! : (
B0057AOS3I|5.0|I love this new album.  She said in interviews before releasing it that Fela Kuti was one of her inspirations and you can definitely hear the African beat in many of the new songs.  Plus, instead of using the same style of vocals in her other albums, these vocals sound more raw (if you heard her sing live on American Idol, you'd hear the difference from her usual sound).  So, it is something new for her as an artist and I think you'll enjoy it :-)
B004XWMXX8|4.0|First let me list the songs I really like:  Love You Like a Love Song, Hit the Lights, My Dilemma, Outlaw, and Middle of Nowhere.  Now let me list the songs that are not bad but just ok:  We Own the Night, When the Sun Goes Down.  Now let me list the songs I just really do NOT like:  Bang Bang Bang, Who Says, Whiplash, That's More Like It and Dices.    Selena and Hollywood Records should have done one of two things.  Either push the release date back and continue to make really good songs for the album like Love You Like a Love Song, Hit the Lights, My Dilemma, and Outlaw to give the album more depth and more quality.  OR cut some of the bad songs like Bang Bang Bang, Who Says, and Whiplash and release it under A Year Without Rain EP.  The key being EP (Extended Play)  I believe there are a few good songs that would compliment A Year Without Rain and would make a nice addition to be released as an EP.    And finally, the album artwork and theme is supposed to tie everything together.  I just do not understand where Selena and/or Hollywood Records is going with the artwork and album cover.  It just doesn't make sense to me.      So I give it 4 out of 5 stars because I really like a few of the songs, but it just doesn't have enough of the good songs to be a 5 out of 5.
B003Y5H556|4.0|This was a good twist on a on old story of Little Red Riding Hood. I've heard mixed reviews on this movie, and decided to check it out for myself. I've seen various versions of the story, but this one I have to say I liked the best. Catherine Harwick did a good job of directing, and I thought Billy Burke (from Twilight) did a good job of his role.<br /><br />The story did keep me guessing, which is what I like. I did enjoy the romance angle and was pleasantly surprised with the ending. The story itself is fast paced, and has plenty of twists. Would I add it to my collection - possibly.<br /><br />If you enjoy a suspenseful horror, with the element of romance, you will like this movie. If you like werewolf cult horror like Wolfen, or Howling you might not like this one. I enjoyed it and would watch it again just to see what I missed the first time. lol.
0823016714|5.0|Bought this book at the suggestion of a drawing instructor and I'm so glad I did! This book is an excellent resource for all kinds of expressions from a wide range of people, races and sizes. What I also liked about this book is that every now and then, they throw in an art piece that was inspired by one of the images in the book. It's fun to find the facial reference that they artists used as inspiration.
B00004U2EZ|5.0|Hauntingly beautiful - I do not understand a word of French aside from the traditional greetings and such but even if you do not understand what is being sung...the CD is a must own for anyone who appreciates music and has the ability to get drawn into the subject via the melodies and emotions of the singers.  Buy this CD!!!
B004MKM8L8|5.0|The way to go with the Harry Potter collection is by buying blurays. Be careful with the non- originals copies of dvds.
B002ZG974M|5.0|All of life's questions are answered in this film.  I don't even want to call it a documentary.  It is the best film EVER.  In my opinion.  So funny to read the reviews...  I really loved it.
B004I4H8QS|3.0|So this makes, what, the 40th repackaging of this album?  Talk about squeezing every bit of juice out of the lemon.    Surpirsed that there was no attempt at a new insert or new insights into the album.  Same packaging, additional CD.  Which unfortunately contains nothing noteworthy enough to merit the effort.  Spector's two remixes are just dreadful, and if the other cuts were really going to go onto the next DATD album, I would have skipped that as well.  Yet another version of Layla to go onto my shelf until it's time to resells it.
068987474X|5.0|Wonderful book! Easy book with lots of insight. If you really want to understand a bit more of relationships, then I would recommend to leave behind any bias opinions about men or relationships, and go full throttle digesting every word in the book. Greg and Liz write to those who need tough love, but with a very kind and loving heart. Some information is straighforward, without any hesitation. But, wouldn't you rather know now than later?! I WOULD! I definitely began the book with an open mind and was blown away by some of the \\"wake up calls\\" I didn't know before. This book has definitely altered my path in such a positive and profound way! I am very grateful for every single word written within the covers.    (The book was delivered five days earlier than promised! How great is that! So, I was already starting off on the right path by selecting this book...)
B002BU0DPE|5.0|This is definitely the best headset for the price. This headset is amazing. My brother and I both have this headset and so far neither of us have found anything wrong with it. I love that you can listen to the game volume in them and i like that it has separate controls for game volume and chat volume. Another plus is that it has a long cord so you don't have to sit right by you TV to use it. Overall, great product. Definitely recommend.
B004V6MWFU|3.0|Mediocre at best.  It is exactly what you would expect.  It's Eddie Vedder with a Uke.  His vibrato is over the top (like Tiny Tim from the 60's).  If you think this is something special maybe you should go back to the 60's and check out the original.  It was a joke in the 60's and it still is...
B0050CQY1W|1.0|3 singles, all in the bottom , no top ten, slow, dull. and dont waste your money, wait a week or two and get it for 99 cents. Just plain bad. what happened? king B??????
B004HZ76FQ|5.0|I really enjoyed playing this game! the controls are easy to learn, and are very natural. i highly recommed it for you fishermen and armchair fishermen!
B00506NRBS|5.0|Once upon a time, there was an inspired person (maybe you... maybe me...) who came up with this brilliant business idea they think truly has legs.<br /><br />Before the idea has time to germinate though, it gets distracted by all the invisible industries that \\"support\\" business development. The idea gets so weighed down, it dies prematurely. The would-be entrepreneur comes to believe they must not have the goods and decides to get a job.<br /><br />Enter Derek Sivers.<br /><br />Anything You Want is a combination of autobiographical narrative and business principles that exhales fresh air into the room. It is a reminder to why we go after the entrepreneurial life in the first place. It's well written, inviting and addictive. You'll have it read in just the right amount of time to go do something with your day... maybe even make good on that brilliant idea.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
1936719118|5.0|I respect Derek because, unlike so many others, he's a self-helper who's actually done something in his life.<br /><br />Derek writes like a guy you'd immediately want to be your friend, your co-worker, your employee...your boss.<br /><br />(I really don't like audio books, but I implore you to listen to Derek speak to get his cadence and voice running through your head.  It truly makes his text pop more.)<br /><br />\\"Anything You Want\\" is THE greatest manual for running a business.  For creating your own Utopian business world that will make both you and your employees happy.  It's not about making money, or growing larger, or conquering the world, it's simply about filling a need that makes both you and your customers happy.  It's simple, but genius.<br /><br />The book tells the story of how Derek's \\"little hobby\\"--CD Baby, a company; no, not even a company, a website created simply to sell his musician friends' CDs--became a big business.  It was all an accident.<br /><br />Why?  Because Derek was filling a need for others.<br /><br />If you're filling a need for the world, and making yourself happy, that's all you need in life says Derek.  In many ways, \\"Anything You Want\\" reminded me of a more streamlined version of Tony Hseih's \\"Delivering Happiness,\\" also recommended.  The crux of Tony's business plan is to \\"WOW\\" customers.  Derek would agree with that sentiment as \\"Anything You Want\\" tells wonderful stories of all the little things he encouraged his CD Baby employees to do to make customers happy (a story involving a frozen squid is a major highlight.)<br /><br />\\"But please know that it's often the tiny details that really thrill people enough to make them tell all their friends about you.\\"<br /><br />There is seemingly so many things to worry about in life.  Even more if you're running a business.  But, that doesn't need to be the case.  Derek says:<br /><br />\\"Are you helping people?  Are they happy?  Are you happy?  Are you profitable?  Isn't that enough?\\"
0913866156|5.0|I just received this deck yesterday. Reading the reviews I was kinda iffy with the whole negative vibe thing and how this deck is not for beginners. Well, all I can say is that this my deck. It instantly spoke to me. The LWB that comes along with it is a tremendous help. I still have a lot to learn. This is the first deck that I have had amazing results and astounding accuracy. I am a highly sensitive empathic person and there were no negative vibes. This deck deserves ten stars!!
0061689246|5.0|Before you ask, this is a fantasy work that is in no way related to the David Bowie biography of the same name. It is an absolutely brilliant novel taking place in England and a magic land called Wall. Tristan Thorn is a lovesick 18 year old who rushes off to the land of Wall, after promising his beloved that he will bring her a falling star, they both witnessed. What he does not know is that in Wall, every kind of magic is real and stars are people too. His quest leads him to encounter airships, witches, princes, and many more fascinating things, he could have only dreamed of. There was also a great movie adaption so, check that out as well.
B002WCLG48|1.0|I was immensely excited when I first saw that this was coming out. I thought cool an anime that will fill in some of the gaps in the Halo universe. I was completely wrong. This is nothing but garbage and stupidity. None of the character act like they should and it is all just silly and annoying. I rarely do no finish things that I start, but this was so bad that I could not even make it half way through.<br />Then there is the matter of the graphics. This movie looks terrible as if it were drawn by a three year old.<br />In short there is nothing for anyone in this movie.
B0050CQY1W|5.0|This album is AMAZING! It's like a breath of fresh air in a time when most music is so predictable and unoriginal! She's officially reminded us of how music at it's best really should be a work of art! Definitely a MUST HAVE!
B004XWMXX8|5.0|Selena is a Great Singer I don't know why people say she is a bad singer but she is NOT! I am 33 going to be 34 in September and as a Grown Adult I love her music, Plus I love the Late Selena Perez and she is named after her so thats why I like her to. But this album is really good. People just give her a chance just because she is no britney Spears or Lady Gaga does not meen that you should not listen to her. She has more Talent then any teen that is out today singing!! Love ya Selena, never give up just because of bad reviews i love ya girl!!!
B000JVSUS4|5.0|Pearl Harbor to me is a modern day classic.  The digitally remastered Blu Ray is fantastically sharp and colors are true.  Great purchase at a great value
0062060554|5.0|I ignore author's reveiws, even authors I respect, because they are written for their own publicity, as a commitment to their pubilishers, and in hopes of favorable reviews in return. For S. J. Watson's debut novel however I can not think of a more appropriate assessment than what Dennis Lehane scrawls across the flap: \\"Momento on crystal meth.\\" Before I go to sleep is a novel that you do NOT want to read before going to sleep. Christine awakes every morning with no idea where she is, no idea who this older man sleeping next to her is, a few vague memories of childhood and shock as she realizes she is now much older than she would have thought. It turns out she has a rare form of amnesia that has wiped away the last several years of her life, and she forgets everything that happened or that she remembers from the day before while she sleeps over night. The man sleeping next to her is the devoted husband of many years. She learns that she has been seeing a doctor, who admittedly is also trying to help her for his own reasons. He has recommended keeping a daily journal of what has occured and any bits of memory she recalls. The doctor calls her everyday to remind her about the journal and where she has hiddened it, for they have decided to keep her treatment a secret from her husband, Ben. Over a couple of weeks, using the journal and going with her doctor to a few places of her past, her memories start to come back. But she soon discovers there are inconsistantencies, deceptions, and outright lies. But who can she trust? Ben, who loves and takes care of her though for whom she has no feelings and barely remembers? Her former best friend who suddenly comes back in her life? Her doctor? What do they want from her? Watson's writing is flawless, perfect in tone and pacing. We can feel Christine's confusion, frustration, and slowly mounting fear. This is a fictional thriller, but Watson has based it on true cases and this gives us a rare insight to those who have lost orare losing their memories.
B0041KKYEM|2.0|This is a peculiar movie about a morbidly thin young woman whose bulemia apparently drives her insane so she begins hallucinating.  She lives with her domineering mother and worries about a big promotion coming up at work -- will she get it?  Her boss says she has some of the qualifications but not all of them.  She rushes to the toilet and sticks her finger down her throat and later he says okay, he'll give her a chance.  About this time she starts worrying about a co-worker who wants the same job.  Is everything going to hell in a handcart all around her, or is she just imagining it because she's not eating anything?  Who knows?  Who cares?  I'd add that she looks perpetually constipated but I don't think that goes with bulemia so maybe it's something else.  The music was nice but is even better on CD, without the annoyance of constant interruptions by portentous dialogue and half-assed plot devices.
B004KA9MQO|2.0|I mean the first single just put this project on the wrong footing.  Bad grammar is not the way to begin any project, first single.  I also think that she returned with her second too soon because she really doesn't have a public image.  Today in the music industry you must stand out in some way along with your music. SHe is just bland too me.  I like the song for her mother and otherwise nothing truly stuck out.  There was no cohesiveness to the project, each song sort of stood out on it's own.  I think she needs a vocal coach not that her voice is bad but she has no real personal style or personality.  The media has also made her more than she is really worth, unfortunately.  Because of her Dreamgirls debut which I think was a fluke that she won because the picture was written for that character so she was likable for that reason.  She sang that song well from the movie but still did not touch the original by Jennifer Holiday.  Sometimes overnight success can compel you to be in the spotlight before you are really ready.
1400064627|5.0|im reading it for the second time.  im a HUGE fan of the movie.  i seriously must drive my family crazy with the movie.  im always watching it.    this is not a story you can just watch the movie with.  you have to read the book.    In filmmaking they have to cut things and take certain characters and stick more to them so they can sum things up in 2 hours but you get to see the world thats been living in your head through the book with your own two eyes and the movie was phenominal.   im the book your imagination is able to go buck wild and fannie does just that.    ever wondered if eva really had a three legged dog.  where did smokey lonesome come from and howd he end up on the road.    those questions are answered and so many more.  in the book you get to really know stump.  you learn more about ninny and evelyn.    you even get to spend a little more time with buddy.    i treasure this book and i hope you will too. id just love to find more books like this.  its from a golden time long gone.  I drive around town even now here in mississippi and see old buildings on the back roads from back in those days and its sad to think how manic things have become.    fried green tomatoes isnt about perfect people. its about real people, a mistery, a love story and a story about friendship.    This book is a gem.  its a fresh bunch of honeysuckle after youve spent the day in the stressful cement coated city.  you just gotta breath it in and go back.
B000P0J0EW|5.0|I watched this movie, again, over the weekend for the umpteenth time.  It NEVER gets old.  It is, by far, one of THE best movies ever made and has withstood the test of time.  I don't know how many times I've seen it, but I do know that the final scene never fails to bring a tear to my eye. One of the best movie lines ever comes from this movie, \\"Get busy livin' or get busy dyin'.\\"  Love, love, love it!
B0034G4P8U|3.0|The plot its great from the beginning, i hate to say \\"i knew so\\" but i knew that the man did not go to the moon just because. Thats what this is all about, having history involved kinda was the reason of having 4stars than 3 (to me)     The movie its entertaining from the beginning, however well this is a merely USA independence day movie type, just in time for 4th of july, this is where the Americans take all the credit and the Russians the blame... i wonder how the Russians took the movie message n i wonder if thats why they premiere the movie there.    SAM is the same old annoying scream like a girl guy with a slightly hotter GF if u into British accent girls with dirty blonde hair, which she seems more right to the job than the previous one... i mean this girl rocked the whole attack, runs, jumps, rescues on high heels! lets hope they didnt hooked up on real life like the passed one .. yay mate?    MOVIE: well its definitively a whole much better than part 2, however i cant really say that it blow my socks off.... it just kept me entertain enough that i couldnt skip a minute to go to the loo, so if u feel like peeing just go within the first 30mnts.    i wont comment on specific parts of the movie to avoid spoilers but:    First time i see a DODGE truck on a transformers movie...seriously... so funny enough its was only ONE! with a big logo of NASA on the door. i believe i saw a ford too but i cant put my money on that.    I thou that the last shuttle flight was next week july 8th....    I thou that the autobots could just transform into a plane and just fly away... but yet they need a shuttle to go beyond the earths atmosphere.    Boy i was wanting to go home and look for that airport firetruck for my collection of transformers but oh boy after the movie i dont want it anymore... he is such a traitor but maybe i will.. such a shame he is prolly the best transformers (to me)    The Movie its the same old, Decepticons trying to rule the world, thou this movie focused merely in USA.... i bet if they woulda try to set on a place like africa things woulda been better for them punks... however we seen what happened in Egypt, so i dont think it will matter or maybe it would've.. whats a shame is that Chicago will get a make up after this.    ACTION LOTS LOTS LOTS LOTS... this has MORE fights MORE attacks Much MORE robots of course all from the decepticons but no matter the number the autobots will always prevail.... on the the humanity ( USA army.... )    SCREEN in this case IMAX  3D .. NICE not excellent but passable.    3D wise ill say 90% of the movie was just converted in a VERY LOW way to 3D just like my Samsung TV does at home from a regular 2D source (where u can almost see the movie with the naked eyes). However there is COOL but fewer scenes where there is that deep 3D effect specially the 360 camera scenes, but again just a few.    IMAX wise we all know that there is only a few scenes taken with IMAX cameras or that are true IMAX, i wouldnt doubt only 25% or less is IMAX however the Digital IMAX does really make up for it, as if u were to watch it on analog u will kinda notice the non IMAX content if u put attention to it.  Still not any close to that AVATAR movie that we saw 2 yrs ago, but its definitively underneath  it =) is it worth the Xtra $$ yes but only on digital IMAX theaters     Bottom line.....this movie will be the summer HIT no doubt about that.... its a must watch !! for kids n kids inside of an adult, best yet if u have not seen the previous ones guess what it does NOT matter!!!!!!!
0439023521|3.0|If you have read anything about this book don't read the book. The Hunger Games is like the 90 minute comedy movie that shows all the funny parts in  the movie trailer. They spend 50 pages leading up to selecting the participants in the hunger games. Guess what the narrator ends up in the games  and spoiler alert guess who wins? The movie may be alot better than the book, let's hope. There weren't any real twists or much suspense just waiting  for the inevitable finish.
B003JBHQP4|3.0|Slower than other memory card readers, don't expect too much.  It's probably worth it to buy a more expensive card reader if you shoot photos/videos all the time.
0307593525|5.0|Purchased these as a Christmas gift for<br />my sister.  She was pleasantly surprised and<br />has tried many of the recipes, she loved them!!
B004VBAHG6|4.0|I wasn't much impressed with the last two offerings of Mr.Murphy and I didn't expect much about this new release, but fortunately he returned to the old good days of Deep and Holy Smoke: a mix of hard, goth, romantic, ethereal, etc.... and still singing great. I love the overall sound of the recording too, and IMHO is one of his best recordings. High points: Seesaw Sway, Peace to Each, The Prince & Old Lady Shade, Creme de la Creme ... and all the rest too. A must have for fans. Highly recommended.
B004K8WJ3Y|5.0|The Snake is back & better than ever.  Can't say enough good about this album!  Thank you David & company for continuing to fly the flag that is WHITESNAKE!!!!!
B003G4W49C|5.0|This was recommended to me by a friend a number of years ago, I could not tell my younger self how much fun I would have reading this book.  I have read it many times and it never looses its magic.  Even the Boyscouts in my toop who were less than avid about reading found this book hard to put down.
0439023513|3.0|While not quite as strong as the first two books, the ending is a satisfying way to tie up all the loose ends. I was only bothered by the fact that the most profound scene in perhaps the entire series between Katniss and Prim was a page long. I'm still shaking my head at that.
B000SZH7RQ|3.0|the music is classic and everyone should know that;   but the dubious \\"VBR\\" of the download seems cheesy and Amazon does not reveal this before ordering/downloading.
B004T0XYM8|5.0|A railroad magnate named Morton, Gabriele Ferzetti, hires a cruel gunman named Frank, Henry Fonda, to \\"remove obstacles from the track.\\" One of the obstacles is Brett McBain, who owns some water rich land the railroad must pass through. Frank massacres McBain and his family, framing a local bandit named Cheyenne, Jason Robards, in the process. Unbeknownst to Frank, McBain married Jill, Claudia Cardinale, on a recent trip to New Orleans. Jill arrives to find her new family dead and herself in possession of the land Frank will certainly kill again to obtain. Jill's survival depends on Cheyenne, who wants to find out who framed him, and a mysterious stranger called Harmonica, Charles Bronson, who has his own business to conduct with Frank.    \\"Once Upon A Time In The West\\" is perhaps the most beautiful western ever filmed. Employing his signature style, director Sergio Leone uses the wide screen format with the skill of a master painter, alternating breath-taking vistas with stunning close-ups against the magnificent score by Ennio Morricone. Leone lets the story unfold slowly. Characters surrender their motivations only grudgingly, all the while slowly building to a powerful conclusion. The pace of the film, which I credit as one of its strengths, may also be its main drawback today. Many members of the post-MTV generation accustomed to quick editing may not have the patience to let themselves be swept up by this film. That is a pity.    \\"Once Upon A Time In The West\\" stands as Leone's homage to the great, and not so great, western films that came before him. \\"Johnny Guitar\\" certainly springs to mind and the opening sequence makes an undeniable nod toward \\"High Noon.\\" However, unlike Quentin Tarantino's recent homage to his roots, \\"Kill Bill, Vol. 1,\\" this film not only stands on its own two feet, it expands the genre.     These characters are more than a group of archetypes wandering about under the western sun. Jill isn't your traditional victimized widow. A New Orleans prostitute taking a chance on a new life on the frontier, she's an independent woman who knows men. If sleeping with Frank is the only way to save her life, she will, knowing that after a hot bath she'll be the same as she was before. Frank, in a brilliant performance against type by Henry Fonda, is also a man in transition. He envies the power flowing from Morton's money. He would like to become more like Morton, but his propensity toward baser evil deprives him of the discipline he needs to become a businessman. Cheyenne seeks revenge for being framed and pretends to interested in the wealth the McBain land will bring, but he is mainly motivated by growing feelings for Jill. He's the most sentimental character in the film. He's a bandit with a heart of gold, which is more than can be said for Harmonica. Harmonica, the man with no name, develops a liking for both Jill and Cheyenne, but one gets the feeling he would sacrifice either or both of them if there was no other way to get Frank. He is not the classic, selfless western hero of old.    When I originally saw this film, I was disappointed by Bronson. I didn't think he made the most of a role obviously tailor-made for Clint Eastwood. I was mistaken. Bronson brought nuance to the role I doubt Eastwood would have at that stage of his career. In his three films with Leone, Eastwood's \\"Man with No Name\\" character tended toward smug amorality motivated only by self-interest. Harmonica has a little more depth and introspection than Eastwood's characters. He plays him with a certain sadness in his eyes; a doomed self-awareness. Harmonica realizes when he kills Frank the remainder of his life will be devoid of meaning or purpose. He doesn't speak much, but he tellingly attempts to wax philosophically with Frank about the nature of men of like themselves and the changing West. In a sense, he knows Frank is the only person who could understand him, since he had to become a gunman like Frank in order to achieve his well- deserved revenge. The characters Eastwood played for Leone were less troubled about their place in the universe than Bronson's Harmonica. This might be Bronson's best performance.    \\"Once Upon A Time In The West\\" deserves an esteemed place among the canon of great westerns.
B0051QJ83S|5.0|I cant explain how much Gaga wowed me with this album. Completely different from everything that's out there. Definately a MUST HAVE album!
B0051OZ564|3.0|This movie had every potential to be up there with Brazil.    Instead it just drug on and on.    The fight scenes were masterful works of computer CGI and her dream world was interesting.  The real world was poorly done and boring.    It is worth a rental but not a purchase.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|John,<br />I know you will read this five star review because it is important for you to know what your readers are saying. And I must say it is well deserved. I have such gratitude for you. Sincerely I give you a heartfelt \\"thank you\\". This is more than a book about social media and marketing. At the crux is- connection. Indeed I knew this was the secret, however I did not have the tools to create that connection on a massive scale until now. Put me down as your latest OOU and blog subscriber.<br />Best<br />Van
B001TODCII|1.0|nice outer packaging but real surprise is inside when its not what is on the cover, for christ sakes check your packages and make accuracy a priority or get out the business
0061733199|5.0|This is a good survival book for beginners.It covers alot  of information and is easy to follow with many of diagrams and pictures. The first aid is a bit outdated, but it is always so, because first aid changes yearly. The rest of the book is great. When covering shelters, the diagrams are easy to look at and build yourself. The rest of the book is the same way. besides first aid, this is a good book.
B00005JKCH|4.0|With nearly 1,200 reviews already written, there's really no use in describing the plot, etc.  I just want to give a few thoughts on this movie...<br /><br />I had never seen this 2002 movie until recently.  I guess I'm late to the party.  Overall, it's a very solid superhero movie with very good special effects by way of CGI.  The acting is good.  Spiderman's costume is cool looking.  The musical score is pretty good.  Overall this movie, in my opinion, ranks among the elite superhero movies ever made.  I wouldn't put it in the same category as The Dark Knight (2008), or Batman (1989), but it's definitely up there.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend this movie if you want to be visually entertained while watching a good superhero movie.
B0055FR5PS|5.0|Ok maybe aliens aren't going to invade the world, but maybe someone else will. Spending 30 months in Iraq this is a heart breaker. The loyalty, duty, respect, selfless service, honor, integrity, personal courage abounds throughout the entire movie. All the other reviews are wrong. If you served you will understand and if you have never watch and learn what our country posses. Yes, only a movie but the deep rooted meaning shines. Go US Armed Forces Happy 4th.
159420229X|4.0|I enjoyed this book a lot.  It's well-written, a quick read, and enjoyable.  While it does give a lot of interesting facts about memory and language, most of this is fairly well-known for those who have a background in memory research or neuropsych.  I wrote a thesis on memory (years ago) and have a degree in clinical psychology, so the book was a little superficial in subject matter for me -- I was hoping to learn something new -- but I still enjoyed the memoir side of the book. This is perfect for those who are totally new to the memory field, but still enjoyable for those with a bit more background.  This would be a great book to read on a long airplane trip.  Bravo to Foer for a well-researched, engaging read.
1401223176|5.0|great art work by lee,good story with a lot of good charecters,one of the better batman comics that ive bought from amazon.
B004ULEEY8|2.0|After seeing all the good reviews i just wanted to put my two cents in. This movie is more in tune for the war movie fan not the sci fi fan, and i wanted to make sure that those that bought this movie was aware of this. The only good thing about this movie was the acting. I think that the actors went above and beyond there abilities and the failings of this has nothing to do with them. I dont want to sound totally negative about this movie so ill list the pros and cons of this movie and let you the consumer decide if its worth parting with your hard earned money.    Pros  1. The acting was wonderfully done.  2. Was seemingly patriotic.  3. if you are a war movie fan this is for you.  4. if you dislike sci fi story lines / realism towards science this is for you.  5. good special effects.    Cons  1. The Aliens were totally unbelivable. so much effort was put into making them unique that they look like a two year old drew them on a scrap of paper.  2. The aliens tech looks much more inferior than our own tech. most of the ships and weapons looked like they rummaged through our garbage dumps and just sloped them together. They hardley looked opposing let alone make it out of their own solar system.  3. The aliens did a controled crash into our planet instead of just landing (WOW just WOW).  4. The Plot was absolutely the most stupidest thing I ever heard. They came for water too fuel their technology. Water is the most abundent thing in the universe next to hydrogen. it can even be made..... so an alien race moves from solar system too solar system allowing countless thousands of their own race to be slaughtered just to get something they can make themselves (REALLY?)    I am a huge sci fi fan and almost always rate high and give great reviews to the hard work put into something. But I rate this 2 stars only because of the hard work put into this movie by the actors its not their fault the writers are lacking the ability to put together a plausible story and its not the actors fault that the producers cant invision a plausible alien race / tech.
B003LXM1RS|5.0|This is a great CD. Every song is good. It is excellent for working out or just lifting your mood.
0321344758|5.0|The book is written in a way that common sense explanations help the reader to understand aspects of usability. So the reader does not depend on high technical knowledge.
B004VFYO52|5.0|This CD/DVD combination affords us the opportunity to hear Whitesnake, one of the defining 80's hair bands (who are musically quite talented as well), in its prime with the Coverdale/Vandenburg/Vai/Sarzo/Aldridge lineup.  Playing at Castle Donnington for the Monsters of Rock extravaganza, the set list here covers all of the usual Whitesnake hits.  No casual listener should be unhappy.    Let's start with the good.  The packaging, liner notes, and pictures for are superb.  Coverdale goes into detail about the concert, the creation of the CD, the fact that \\"no expenses were spared\\" for the DVD portion and that the concert sound was given a thorough treatment in the studio.  Transmitted by the BBC for radio broadcast, I would describe the sound on the CD's as better that I expected, given its age and source.  Slightly bass heavy at times, there's no doubt that a moderate amount of compression was used either in the studio clean-up or was present during the original taping during the radio broadcast (or both).  Nevertheless, as other reviewers have noted, everything comes through pretty clearly.  Aldridge's drums sound great, Vandenberg and Vai's guitar's are at times split between left and right channels (and you can tell who's who almost immediately); Coverdale's vocals are slightly recessed, but it's not a problem - it just sounds more like a concert where you're back aways.      Clearly a good night, the band plays with tremendous energy and speed.  The crowd's fired up and, with a little imagination, you can easily put yourself there about half-way back on the ground.      DVD footage is, as others have noted, not the best in terms of concert viewing.  This might something good for a party where no one is watching the TV constantly, but is perhaps talking, listening and occasionally viewing as they pass by on their way to get another beverage.      Overall, a classic live album from Whitesnake from one of their career high points.
B001FB55H6|5.0|Watchmen in theateres was already close to the comic in the most important ways with few changes, bu the directors cut gets evn closer to the comic by adding the missing elements and extending those already there.
B00338QENI|5.0|This was a Kindle purchase.<br />Never had a problem using my Kindle app.<br />Kindle also gave me 4 free books just for having the Kindle app.<br /><br />I passed my course!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />I would purchase more Kindle books when needed.

B000MLPGZG|2.0|The picture is coming in a box and bring accessories such as starters and the belt and I do not get any of that, plus the packaging pesimo an envelope, hit and damage the digital scoreboard, I thought that was coming in to buy a box and get the ball in a box in an envelope. I did not like.    no cd.  no belt.  no box.
B004XIQIPQ|2.0|I miss the band i first got into (Whatever people say..., Favourite Worst Nightmare) and while Humbug was still enjoyable with a little less energy, this album is DOA.  If you liked their older stuff, don't bother with this album.  if you started with humbug, this one should work for you.
B004G5ZY7E|5.0|This was the first of Jo Nesbo's books that I have read and I absolutely loved it. I could not put this book down once I had started.<br /><br />Seeing as how I'm not Scandinavian, I did struggle with some names/locations, but not enough to detract from the story. The story moves very quickly and has lots of twists and turns to keep you guessing. It probably didn't help that this book is in the middle of the Harry Hole (I can't help but snicker when I say that name), so there is a lot of \\"history\\" that takes place before this book. However it's an easy read as a standalone and I quickly got the gist of what had happened in previous stories.<br /><br />I will advise that there is a LOT of sexual content in this book. Not that I expect young children to be reading this type of book, but if you are uncomfortable with sexual content, you may not like this story.
B0055OK2T0|4.0|Wonderful chemistry between the leads. It's a love story through and through, and certainly tugged at the heartstrings of the hopeless romantic in me.
B003SWUC4Q|4.0|I'd give this five stars for Eminem's music because he's so talented, but it loses a star because this is a \\"clean\\" censored version of this album. It doesn't say that anywhere on the listing. I wish I had known. Censoring Eminem's music is definitely not the same as listening to the full version.    So if you don't want all of Eminem's colorful language, this is probably the best you're going to get. But for me, it just sounds randomly interrupted every 15 seconds. I'd much rather have the full version.
B004UXUXGE|2.0|I made a point of seeing this film in theatre, to do justice to its art. I recommend instead that you rent, mute the sound, and skip the talking heads completely. When I got home and realized that a well known director made this tripe I was stunned. The history and the science are badly done, the film suffers from an inane, rambling script, and the music is beyond mediocre and into grating. We do not need to be told the cave sparkles, or to hear a heartbeat. Worst of all, the cave paintings are badly filmed. Since the French botched the management of Lauscaux they are understandably protective of this more recently discovered cave. It could have been nearly impossible to film under their strict restrictions.     Chauvet most likely functioned as a spiritual retreat, and the caliber of its art is breathtaking. The animals are so alive, with so much spirit,  it is pure joy to see them.  For that reason I find it shameful that a better quality film could not have been produced. Frankly, who gives a damm about what the animal bones are, in the presence of art that fairly dances off the walls? This is a great cave we will never be allowed inside, with apparently hundreds of pictures we did not see.  Please make a better record of it before it is too late. And I am not talking a reproduction/amusement park like the one planned. Make a real film that treats its subject matter with the respect it deserves, by a director that has the lightness of hand to capture the essence of this great place. The cave is, hands down, five stars. This film is not.

B004WPYNY8|5.0|If any of you reviewers find this release sub-par, I have one release for you to check out- Queensryche's Dedicated to Chaos.  Then you will see what sub-par is.      So I'll keep this brief.  The layered guitar work and the production of this cd is magnificent.  As aggressive as the music may be, it is just as beautiful.  The band has never sounded better. Plenty of songs on here to enjoy.  Not one bad tune here. It's nice to see a band put out different sounding albums while still keeping their fanbase happy and not deserting the formula that made them who they are.  I think they really enjoy making this type of music and it shows! If you like hard rock/metal with Proggy elements to it, this release is for you.    Cheers,    METALFAN

B0041KKYEW|4.0|`Black Swan' is the acclaimed psychological drama starring Natalie Portman as an over-stretched, tense and neurotic ballerina.<br /><br />When Nina (played by Portman) wins the star role in the ballet Swan Lake she is informed she will also have to play the role of the black swan as well. Whilst she is well suited for the Queen swan role, she finds it harder to access the emotions needed for the black swan role. This film follows her as she searches for this character within her, whilst dealing with an over-bearing mother, a sexual predator dance director and a jealous fellow dancer. Soon the cracks begin to show and her neurosis' come flooding out.<br /><br />It is shocking to see the lengths the ballet dancers go to in the name of perfection and whilst some of the behaviours are nothing new (like starving oneself, vomiting, excessive work loads and colleague animosity), they are still disturbing to watch. You feel that although Nina is a very fragile and neurotic person, she also doesn't get any type of support either.<br /><br />This film feels very weird at times as Nina loses herself in her role, which only heightens the sense of Nina's breakdown and her fragile mental state. There are lots of minor hallucinations throughout which lead up to the films crescendo and the ending, despite being mildly clich&eacute;d, does have an impact.<br /><br />Portman acts very well and gives this film it's required edge and Kunis is great as the self assured jealous dancer. Winona Ryder shows up briefly as the outgoing ballet star and overall all three actresses give top performances. The direction is also very good and you can see why this film was so lauded at it's cinematic release.<br /><br />This is a very good film and whilst it feels disjointed and confusing at times, this is all part of the plot and keeps the film edgy and tense. This is well worth a watch and while I won't be watching it again anytime soon, I am glad I took the time to view it now.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B00004XPPE|3.0|Contrary to the description given by Columbia Pictures, this is NOT an anti-war movie.  It is an anti-America movie.    First, it is true that the acting is top-notch.  The character development is varied and rich.  The sets are few, and therefore more powerful.  The camera angles pull you into each scene, including a few sweaty close-ups of less than full face.  The pace and plot quickly become captivating.    HOWEVER, where this 1964 movie goes is almost unspeakable.      The timing of its production is important to know.  In 1962, U.S. President Kennedy and Soviet Premier Khrushchev had done a somewhat similar bluff/bravado regarding the Soviet \\"secret\\" missiles pointed at us in Cuba.  The two leaders then \\"agreed\\" to mutually remove (or was it \\"relocate\\") certain nuclear weapons.  But the writers of this propaganda story had \\"better\\" ideas, and Henry Fonda was the ideal lead.      Does the movie make you think?  I hope so.  But whether the ending repulses you or makes you smack your lips against America, reveals whether you are an American patriot.  \\"President\\" Fonda urged us all to be a \\"patriot.\\"  Note that the one \\"Fail Safe\\" commander who tried to stop the others from revealing our key defense secrets to the Soviet Communists was accused of \\"treason.\\"  Before you choose to vote for President in 2012, consider this movie and consider who it was who committed treason.    The supposedly unavoidable single option which \\"President\\" Fonda faced was not the only option.  Even if our bomber was headed to Moscow due to \\"our\\" mistake, no American President has the legal or moral authority to attack our nation.  The Constitution (which every President must swear/affirm to \\"preserve, protect and defend\\") which creates the office of President does not provide the absurd power to attack the United States.  Article 4, Section 4, obligates our entire federal government to \\"protect\\" the states \\"against invasion.\\" The power which Article 1, Section 8, gives to Congress is to\\"provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States.\\"  So, Pres Fonda needed to tell whoever in Moscow that he does NOT have the option of bombing our own people.  Then, if our bomber took out Moscow, our President's sworn duty to protect OUR country might mean doing what Walter Matthau suggested -- take out the rest of their weapons, before they take us out.  If someone is not willing to stand up to protect OUR country when the situations get difficult, they should never have sworn to.      The role/authority/power of a U.S. President is not to try to make the world all even out, like a corrupt referee who makes bad calls to try to keep the score close so feelings (supposedly) don't get hurt.     Did you know that in 1970, six years after this movie, Jane Fonda (daughter of Henry) said in a university speech; \\"...if you understood what Communism was, you would hope, you would pray on you knees, that we would someday become Communists.\\"  Then in 1972 in Communist North Vietnam (yes, this was while we were at war with them), Jane Fonda had her smirking picture taken pretending to be praying, while kneeling on one of our enemy's anti-aircraft guns.  This is part of Henry Fonda's deserved fruit from Fail Safe.    Part of the cowardice of Fail Safe is that it \\"ends\\" with \\"President\\" Fonda's bombing of our New York City.  The promoters and lovers of this movie's message do not want to have to explain their horrific notion of heroism.  Nor do they want to have to answer for the effect of this supposedly valiant decision by \\"President\\" Henry Fonda.  One of the many lessons of 9-11-01 is that Americans, who differ on so many topics, agree that an attack on just one part of one city of our nation is an attack on us all.

I loved this movie when it first came out and I love it still -- both the extended version and the theatrical release.  The costumes are great -- still.  The effects are dated, but that's what happens as life marches forward. I did not appreciate Kyle MacLachlan when I was a kid, but I adore him now. The movie could use a little more Duncan Idaho, but what can you do?

It's a bit late in the game (already middle of 2011), but this truly is a great Rap/R&B album.  If you want to support a great band and still listen to CD's, this is a worthy buy.
B00127RAJY|1.0|Maybe it's just me because so many people seem to love Jillian, but I can't understand why.  I consider myself an intermediate/advanced exerciser, and I've tried several of her DVDs but just can't get into it.  She wastes a lot of time talking (even though she says she's not going to), and spends a lot of time pointing out how awesome the girls in the video look.  And I get sick of hearing about how tough of a trainer she is.  If you can get past that, the workout itself isn't that great.  To me it was boring and poorly sequenced.  The moves are really high impact, which I usually like but they just weren't fun in this video.  I didn't see enough variety, and I felt almost nothing from her abs sections.  The cardio segments were lacking and didn't really get my heart rate up; they were more like faster strength moves.  And with the strength, it feels like she doesn't work all of the muscle groups and overemphasizes other; for example there are way too many moves that have you on all-fours or in a pushup position (in all the sections).  A MUCH better DVD is Cindy Whitmarsh's 10 Days to a Better Body.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I bought this book for my Kindle while I was traveling and I had to contain my laughs after getting dirty looks from people on the plane. The way Tina Fey compiles the stories is sort of random but I think it adds a sort of quirkiness to the humor. It's like listening to someone tell you a funny story but gets sidetracked by another something funny that they thought of. I really just enjoyed her candid and self deprecating humor...makes you want to say \\"oh yeah, I SO know what you mean!\\"
1402210086|4.0|This is a thoroughly enjoyable read.  The dialogue is lively and rich with popular slang of the period, which is sometimes challenging to decipher, but once you do figure it out, it is bright and witty.    I especially enjoyed the character, Freddie.  I have never read a novel by Heyer before and, I suppose because of the person who recommended this author to me, I expected a rather more serious tone.  I at first thought Freddie was just a fool, but soon realized that Freddie is the Bertie Wooster of the Regency period. Freddie doesn't have a Jeeves however, so he manages to become the hero of the piece by rescuing Kitty and her friends from various dilemmas.   This book is not a deep read; you won't find the satire, insight, or social commentary of Austen, for instance, but you will have fun!
0061339202|5.0|This book will quite literally change how you live your life (and I'm not one to speak in hyperbole...at least not in a public review).  'Flow' is a modern book on ethics and how one should live his/her life, and what's both shocking and comforting is that it was written over 30 years ago while retaining present day relevance.  Being that it is a book on philosophy, a word of warning is that it is NOT an easy read, but once you get into it, it's absolutely amazing.<br /><br />If you want an insight into what conditions are missing from people's lives that they do not have regular access to an optimal experience, AND want some guidelines so that you can re-create those conditions to discover your own optimal experience, this book is for you.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|Rio is bright, colorful, lively, and full of music--exactly what one imagines when they think of Rio, Brazil, Carnival Capital of the World.      Sure, some of the other (more critical) reviews you'll read on Amazon will gripe about forced themes and whatnot, but, really, all this movie comes down to is fun and finding love (for both the avian and human characters).      Remember, folks, these animated movies, although certainly entertaining for (and meant to include) adults, are really targeted for children.     My kids give it 5 Stars and can't wait to have their own copy.  They loved all of the characters--even mean, old Nigel--as their personalities are just as colorful and varied as what is viewed on-screen.    The animation is beautiful and the storyline understandable--a plausible explanation for how Blu got to Minnesota, why he's afraid to fly, and why he needs to go to Rio.    A great movie for little and big people alike!
B002XTBE6K|5.0|Move over, Kate Beckinsale. Gwyneth,I love you, but please. Romola Garai and Johnny Lee Miller are the [...] in the newest, and frankly, the best version of Emma.   The characters are perfectly cast and perfectly delivered--Mrs. Elton as obnoxious as ever, Mr. Elton is ridiculous & Ms. Smith is delightfully foolish.    Most importantly, Johnny Lee Miller as Mr. Knightley is FINALLY the right fit. Way better than MArk Strong 'I held you when you were a baby' (voms) and Jeremy Northam 'Perhaps it's our imperfections that make us so perfect for each other?'(queso). Honestly, I would have stopped the betrothal dead if my special man friend had uttered either of those awkward, creepy lines when sealing the deal. I like both the actors, but not as Mr. Knightley. And to be fair, the script adaptation is better and allows for the actor playing Mr. Knightley to be less cheesy.  Anyways, Ladies, gays and Austen afficionados, doooo it and don't look back. The details, costumes, scenery AND two full discs allow you to properly savor the classic. Well done, indeed!    (Obviously if you are a heterosexual male, you could probably give two flips over this, but when your girlfriend is on her lady time, needs chocolate and forces you to watch a chick flick with her, you want her to watch THIS version of Emma. Trust me.)
B004GYY714|5.0|Love this app. My favorite stations are available.  Some that are hard to get to tune in on a regular radio come in crystal clear with this app (like radio disney).  My guess as to why certain stations are not available is they're under contract with other applications.

A tip for the quad stretches at the end of the workout....if you find them difficult, you might try holding onto something to keep your balance.
B00466HM28|4.0|Picked one of these up yesterday, got home, set it up, and was jamming on the pads and twiddling knobs within minutes. The fun didn't last, though, as I noticed the USB cable wasn't seated properly into the controller, so I pushed it in a bit further and the device promptly disconnected from my laptop.    Sure enough, bent pins, like another reviewer mentioned. Bent pins in the socket, bent pins in the cable connector. The cable Akai includes with the MPK mini is a standard mini-USB cable, with one exception: there are tiny pins in the cable that mate up with tiny holes in the socket, and if they ever get slightly misaligned, you are in for trouble. The pins are fine enough that you won't even necessarily notice that you're bending them while plugging the cable in.    Today I exchanged it for a new one but used a 'standard' standard mini-USB cable, sans pins. Tested every key and control, everything works perfectly fine, so the pins on the Akai cable aren't necessary. Wish I'd known in the first place. The problem doesn't appear to be widespread (maybe people aren't plugging/unplugging their minis very often?) but you only need to bend the pins once and you'll staring at your now-useless controller shouting 'fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuuu.'    Connector problems aside, the MPK mini is a blast to play with, and makes using software synths considerably easier. Assigning the knobs and pads is a breeze (in two VSTIs I tried, I merely had to right-click on a knob onscreen and turn the physical knob on the device and blammo, it Just Works).    Yes, the keys are a bit small, and don't have any weight behind them. But this is a sub-$100 device meant to be used with your laptop, and for banging out basslines and tweaking the filters just right, this is miles and miles ahead of using your keyboard/trackpad/mouse.    Honestly, if it weren't for the crummy cable, easily a five-star product once you consider the functionality you get for such a low price. Obviously it doesn't do what other devices costing $100+ more can do, but that's not its niche.
B00506NRBS|5.0|We all love a good story.  And by now, everyone should know that 'storytelling' is the best way to get a message across.<br /><br />In \\"Anything You Want\\" Derek Sivers brilliantly delivers his own true story (not one of those allegories) about starting and running CD Baby, his online CD selling business for independent musicians.<br /><br />But he doesn't just tell his story, he uses his example of successes and failures to teach us critical business principles that apply in today's entrepreneurial environment.  And he delivers these lessons from the best possible position, one of humility.  He doesn't say that his way is the best way, or that everyone should be like him - he even hopes that some will disagree - he only wants his story to be useful in some way.  So he packed 10 years of learning into a bite sized book that can be digested in an hour.<br /><br />You don't need to be involved in the music industry at all to get great content from this book.  He shares how he made decisions, and then the impact of those decisions.  What was most impressive was his resolve to stay focused on his overall purpose and not give in to the standard processes or generally acceptable behaviors of a business.<br /><br />That's the magic of Sivers - how he continually fought the status quo and proved he could make things work on his own terms - except when they didn't.  This book is as much about failure as it is success.  When you continually fight the status quo, you'll get some things wrong, and that's okay. Pushing the edges guarantees a few mishaps, but staying true to the bigger picture - your overall purpose, will carry you beyond the minor setbacks.<br /><br />Derek's story is worth reading for anyone in business.  It is an iconic example of the new business realities that have occured over the last ten years, and demonstrates how someone can take a hobby for helping out friends into a multi-million dollar business.<br /><br />It's all intertwined in an intriguing story that will keep you glued until you learn every lesson.lesson.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|The reason this piece of work stands out to me,is because of the level of emotional slaughter that the characters go through. One can't help but become attached to the protagonists,since the author makes them come so much alive, that the only thing they didn't do was walk out of the pages. Outstanding work. No weak plot either.

As a person recovering from a illness effecting my brain and spinal cord, this book not only gave me hope, but may have even had techniques included that helped me get better.  A great read even if you did not go through what I went through...Very interesting stuff and I believe anyone could benefit from it.
B00C6B8EJK|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time. This steelbooknlooks great. A true must have for anyone who likes great movies.
0385533829|5.0|The Lost Symbol was an excellent book as most books written by Dan Brown are.  The illustrations help with the reading of the book.  I have finished it an enjoyed it immensely.  The book arrived from Amazon in a timely manner.  I try to order what I need from Amazon because they provide excellent service.
B000089RVX|5.0|This is an awesome album! But there's a couple flaws, I got it about two months ago and I love it! Evanescence is my favorite rock band! Okay I'll be reviewing all the tracks and rating them.    1) Going Under- One of my favorites, but overall not the best. I love the lyrics. Okay, she starts singing at the same time as the music starts. There's bass, drums and guitar (And a little bit of keyboard) within the first verse, my favorite line from this song was \\"I'm dying again\\" It has a lot to do with a character I made up, also the line, \\"I'm falling forever\\". Anyways... Overall rating, 9.9/10    2) Bring Me To Life- The way I found this song was actually kind of interesting. This IS MY FAVORITE on the album, as it is to alot of people. This was one of  the fisrt songs I learned, it has a beautiful melody as the keyboard starts the song, but soon into the first verse gutar, drums and bass add in. And the featured male vocals on this song is not Linkin Park, it's Paul MCcoy from 12 Stones. Rating, 10/10    3) Everybody's Fool- This is also one of my favorites (If not all of them). It starts with some weird noises (I don't know what they are but I think Keyboard). And then adds drums and guitar. This song is one of my favorite songs. Rating, 9/10    4) My Immortal- This is usually peoples favorites but not mine. It is a piano ballad (And I like there louder songs better) but I still like this song alot, her vocals are INCREDIBLE!!! Anyways, overall rating, 8.9/10    5) Haunted- I heard this song on a Youtube video for some dolls... And I loved it! It's incredible, but not one of my favorites. It is mostly just keyboard, but it has gutar, bass and drums to. AMy's voice is incredible (Preferably) on this song! In the fisrt verse she just a=has so much melody in her tone. Rating, 8.9/10    6) Tourniquet- I really love this song. She reminds me of Florence and the Machine when her voice sings, 'And Screaming'. It;s just wonderfull! THis is one of my favorites of Evanescence. Rating, 9.8/10    7) Imaginary- This is not one of my favorites. this is one of the less I heard on the album. But it's still amazing! Rating, 7.9/10    8) Taking Over Me- I also haven't heard this song enough to ABSOLUTLY LOVE IT. But it's really amazing also. Rating, 8/10    9) Hello- I really feel good when I listen to thus song. It is a ballad also like My Immortal and it's really amazing. But its not my ALL TIME FAVORITES, but I really like Amy's voice in this particularly (Sorry if I spelt this wrong). Rating, 9.7/10    10) My Last Breath- I really think this song is epic! It's really beautiful! To me (You may not agree) This and \\"Everybody's Fool\\" ARe alot like Linkin Park songs. DOn't blame me, It's just an opinion. Rtaing, 8.7/10    11) Whisper- I like this son, but I wish it would end in Amy's voice. Instead of the choir. To me, it's not the best song at all, not the least.... Rating, 7.0/10
B0021L8V0W|4.0|Salt (action, crime, mystery)<br />Directed by Phillip Noyce<br />Starring Angelina Jolie, Liev Schreiber and Chiwetel Ejiofor<br /><br />Sony Pictures   2010   101 min   Unrated   Released Dec 21, 2010<br /><br />Video:<br />Video codec: MPEG-4 AVC<br />Video resolution: 1080p<br />Aspect ratio: 2.40:1<br /><br />Audio:<br />English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1<br />English: Dolby Digital 2.0<br />French: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1<br />Spanish: Dolby Digital 5.1<br /><br />Subtitles:<br />English, English SDH, French, Spanish<br /><br />Disc:<br />Single 50GB Blu-ray Disc<br />BD-Live<br /><br />The Film 4/5<br /><br />Salt is full of action and includes an air of mystery. The opening scene takes us back two years and we see Evelyn Salt (Jolie) interrogated in North Korea. She's in pretty bad shape after being beaten, but refuses to talk, even when a tube is forced down her throat and gasoline is poured in. She's eventually released as part of a prisoner exchange and returns to work as a CIA agent. This all happens at the start of the movie and sets up what is to come.<br /><br />The final thing I'm going to reveal is an encounter with a Russian defector. She's selected to interview him and discovers that there's a plan underway to substitute certain Americans with Russians. They become sleepers who will eventually act on behalf of Russia. He informs any agents who might be listening that Evelyn Salt is the name of one such agent.<br /><br />Salt has a decision to make. Which of her colleagues can she trust? Should she stay and answer the accusations? Would it be better to run and try to prevent other sleeper agents from fulfilling their purpose? She decides to run and most of her colleagues see it as an admission of guilt. We're placed in her position and it's one with no obvious solutions. It has the same feel as the Bourne movies, with confusion surrounding her identity.<br /><br />The CIA isn't happy that she evaded capture and sends agents to bring her back. This results in a huge chase scene in which Salt makes some unlikely decisions. If you're a fan of action movies, this is where the story really takes off. The first chase scene happens on a highway and sees Salt making improbable leaps between moving vehicles to evade capture.<br /><br />Jolie looks capable of making some of the jumps, and we see her continually revise her plan as she flees her pursuers. The story keeps us guessing about the level of her involvement and we can't be sure what her motivations are. She's resourceful and uses her intelligence in order to predict the moves of her pursuers and discover the motivations of the Russian group.<br /><br />If you enjoy movies such as Taken, Wanted, Bourne or Die Hard, this is your kind of story. The first adrenalin rush comes early and we rarely have time to breathe. There is a plot, although it's secondary to the action. This is a movie that entertains because of its pacing and spectacular chase scenes. There's not a great deal of thought required, but you will see that everything makes some kind of sense if you think about what you have just seen. Well, it makes as much sense as the average James Bond movie.<br /><br />If you want to see Jolie running around, climbing, jumping and engaging in hand-to-hand combat, grab your popcorn and enjoy the ride. The loose ends are tied up neatly and the conclusion is satisfying. The acting is convincing, although Jolie never has to show the range of emotion that she achieved in Changeling. Schreiber and Ejiofor are always good and both play their roles well.<br /><br />Video Quality 5/5<br />It's hard to fault the look of the movie. Colors appear natural and detail is strong. There's a fine layer of grain and the picture has considerable pop. I felt like I was in the middle of the action. Sony has delivered another great transfer.<br /><br />Audio Quality 5/5<br />There's a lot happening on the screen and the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track handles everything that's thrown at it. Chase scenes sound incredible, while scenes involving explosions and gunfire have the appropriate impact. Dialogue doesn't suffer either, and the surrounds are active throughout the duration of the movie. The score adds to the action scenes and completes the experience. You won't have any complaints about the presentation.<br /><br />Special Features 4.5/5<br /><br />The additional features all appear in full HD.<br /><br />Spy Cam: Picture-in-Picture - The movie includes three cuts and this feature is only available on the theatrical version.<br /><br />Filmmakers' Commentary<br /><br />The Ultimate Female Action Hero (8:05) - Showing some of the stunts that Jolie performed.<br /><br />The Real Agents (12:33) - Former spies talk about their experiences.<br /><br />Spy Disguise: The Looks of Evelyn Salt (5:26) - A look at the various appearances Jolie used in the movie.<br /><br />The Modern Master of the Political Thriller: Phillip Noyce (9:15) - Noyce explains why he has good insight into the life of a spy, and describes how he tries to capture the attention of the audience.<br /><br />Salt: Declassified (29:47) - A thorough \\"making of\\" feature that goes into more depth about some of the things covered in the other features.<br /><br />\\"The Treatment\\" Radio Interview with Phillip Noyce (27:12) - Elvis Mitchell interviews Noyce.<br /><br />Previews<br /><br />BD-Live<br /><br />Salt is a well-crafted spy movie that's heavy on the action, although there are a couple of twists in there too.

B001CDLATE|5.0|Absolutely fascinating.  My brother had it and we saw just part of it at his house when we visited.  I immediately ordered it on line and it was here when we returned from vacation.  Great video.
B0000640VN|3.0|Thank god for Meg Ryan.  She's possibly the only star able to take a thankless script like this one and make it somewhat palatable.  Well, Hugh Jackman's burly charms work too, but really, isn't Meg Ryan the queen of nonsensical romantic comedies?  Flirting (but not so deeply) with the idea of time travel, much about `Kate and Leopold' makes very little sense (and it all just falls to pieces in the end) but getting there is half the fun, and Ryan and Jackman make sure that a good time is had watching these two stars shine for one another.  Basically it's your typical boy meets girl story, except this boy comes straight out of the 1800's and this girl is your modern day independent woman, searching for love and dating the great-great grandson of her new love interest (yeah, like I said...that ending).  Shuck aside common sense and delve into Meg Ryan's undeniable charm and you'll see why `Kate and Leopold' is a crowd pleaser despite being so, well, stupid.
1936719118|5.0|Excellent Book.  Derek is a very grounded entrepreneur whom has managed to be ultra successful and still stay level headed.  You will learn his mentality on things and how minimalism helped him to build a great company.  A 5 Star Rated Book for sure.
B004BSFC6Y|5.0|I purchased these socks for my cousin who is four months old and has vision deficits.  The doctor recommended working with her on the colors of red, white, and black and these socks fit the description.  Since she's been wearing/playing with these, her eyesight has improved, her ability to track objects has improved, and she loves to have them on her feet and \\"find\\" them.
B00005T30L|5.0|Witty and sharp, dry humor lacerates this indie gem.  What I love so much about `Ghost World' is that it understands that balance between humor and heart, and it knows that the darkest realities of loneliness and alienation use sarcasm and wit to mask themselves.  `Ghost World' feels richly honest.  This is certainly not a film that everyone will fall head over heels for; the humor alone is an acquired taste (not everyone will `get it' or find it funny) but for those of us who do `get it', this is a beautiful piece of cinema.  Thora Birch, Scarlett Johansson and Steve Buscemi are all spectacular here, especially Buscemi, who tears at the heart in ways unexpected.  Birch and Johansson find the normalcy in Clowes biting dialog, handling their lines with an ease that is richly rewarding.  The beautiful core of `Ghost World' lies in the idea that growing up comes in stages and is, as we all can attest to, very hard to do.  As the central characters are fleshed out (Enid, Rebecca and Seymour all get their room to shine) we see them interact and play off one another, and the true `thickness' of their relationships is tested and exposed.  Life isn't easy, and making that transition from childhood to adulthood is one of the hardest avenues of life.  For me, there are few films that can capture the emotional impact of the experience with as much style as `Ghost World'.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I really enjoyed seeing all the Firefly episodes together.  The extras on the DVD were great.  It was worth every pennt.  I am now an official \\"Browncoat.\\"  Edie
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I'm officially obsessed with this book.  I was hooked the minute i finished the blurb. I didn't want to put this book down at all. I ready all the through the night even though i had school in the morning.  It's really about a girl who meets a bad boy typed guy and their friendship. The way it's written is amazing and really you feel like the antagonist Aby. I would definitely buy this book. Loved it to bits.
B004EPYZUI|3.0|\\"A sensory overload\\" would best describe this movie.<br /><br />My BR Disc Review:<br /> It will give your sound system a workout.  The effects and images are in a word, Awesome!<br /><br />The story itself is a bit convoluted. I understand this is all taking place in \\"Babydoll's\\" mind, but the action that takes place in the real world does not properly build up enough to understand why the Protagonist is who she is.  The whole opening sequence is essentially a 10 minute montage, and I wont give anything away but the opening action seems to be the most crucial part of the story and it is essentially glossed over.<br /><br />This movie had so much potential for me when I read about it, but it fell short in the story telling.  I was most emotionally attached to the movie at the beginning and spent the next 1.5 hours growing detached from the story.<br />Compared to the other \\"Teen SciFi\\" which has come out recently (Push, I am Number 4, etc.)  this movie is far better in my own opinion.<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br />If you are a fan of the stylistic action of movies like 300 and Kill Bill; or you want a a movie to test the limits of you stereo system;  You should definitely put this movie at least on your rental list.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This one was a lot darker then the first two books, it seemed a little rushed at the end. I did really enjoy this book but I almost wish there was a couple more chapters, maybe I just enjoyed it too much and wish it wouldn't have been over so soon....<br />This is a good book and a great addition/conclusion to the series. Another book I couldn't put down (I read the entire series in about 8 days while working 14 hour shifts each of those days) I have to say this was a great series and I am glad I was able to read it!
B0056BMK6K|5.0|So much fantastic information in this book - that I'm going to have to read it again and again just to get all the information seared into my brain.  Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a workable marketing plan to self-publish their own novels.  I don't know if I can do it, but I'm certainly willing to try!
B003O86FMW|4.0|Another good read, after reading Hunger Games and enjoying that book very much I read this one and couldnt put it down. If you liked the first book you will enjoy this one as well! Very good read!
B001HNE3NO|4.0|This book is not your \\"typical\\" Holocaust book as it is written through the innocent eyes of a child.  The story will stay with you long after you finish reading the book.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book was gifted to me by my sister-in-law who tends to like books that I find not very entertaining however this book kept me reading and reading. I read it in just about 2 days with working 14 hour days I( stayed up just to read this book).<br />This was a mix of styles and I really enjoyed it. I wont go into the plot or a character break down to keep it short and to the point.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|An amazing voice for a young woman. The power behing it was not what I was expecting. Love listening to this up loud in the car for long drives.
0307346617|2.0|Very disappointed.  If you've never seen a zombie movie before, maybe this book would be fun.  Otherwise, it is an enormous bore.  How is this possible?!  The concept gets an \\"A.\\"  But the execution gets a \\"D.\\"  Every interview sounds like the last one.  There is almost no variance in the characters' voices.  The unending chapter about the FDR-New Deal-governmental reorganization going on in the Western US was miserable.  That's when I quit.  I can't believe Mel Brooks's son managed to make such a hash of such a good idea.  At the time of this review, the book has close to 900 reviews and a 4.5 star rating: HOW?  Ugh.  Amazon reviewers, you done me wrong.
B0051OZ564|2.0|I expected a great movie. I was cheated. The story started off great. The opening scene is very breathtaking. It falls apart once they make it to the mental hospital and the main characters tries to escape using her imagination and some newly made friends. Here's what I hated, the dream within a dream. The asylum disappears completely and somehow the place becomes a gentleman's club. Why? Why create an extra layer. The hospital was a gritty place to tell a story. You lose what really happens to this girl and her new band. It doesn't add up how she really forms such quick friendships. Whats worse is we learn very little of the main troupe. I would have loved to see cuts of Baby Doll in and out of dream world. She sees giant samurai, we see huge orderlies; she sees a sword, we see a knife; she sees world war one trenches, we see crawl spaces. I guess I expected \\"One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest meets Kill Bill\\" what I got was \\"Inception meets Kill Bill meets A Clockwork Orange.\\" It would have been more chewable if it really was just a story about a girl combat group fighting evil robots. The writer/director does great visual work, but his story telling needs some work. You need to feel for these characters, and you really don't.    I give it two stars. The visuals were amazing, but little else held my attention, which is sad because the main cast is five amazingly beautiful young ladies.
B0014JLYS8|3.0|I bought these crocs for my husband, they arrived promptly but the strap on one shoe is loose and disconnected on one side.  My husband put it back together and is enjoying the crocs as he does not wear the strap behind his heel.
0525951652|1.0|Pillars Of The Earth was one of my all time favourite books. I enjoyed it as much the second time as I did when I read it 20 years ago. Then came World Without End. I really looked forward to this one as it kind of continued the story that was started in Pillars (even though 400 years had passed). World was a huge disappointment. Some good moments, but nowhere near the class of Pillars. Almost like he passed on his ideas to a ghost writer and had them write the story. It seemed like every time the story was starting to bog down he would throw in some graphic sex scene to compensate. Then came Fall Of Giants. I thought I'd give Mr. Follet the benefit of the doubt and hoped he would revert to his former skill as a writer of historical fiction. What a major disappointment. I don't know how anyone can make the First World War and the Russian Revolution boring, but he managed to do it. And once again, any time the story was starting to lag, which was frequently the case, he would throw in a racy sex scene or something unbelievably crude to try and spice the story up. Mr. Follett, why not make the characters and the story a little more interesting, so you won't have to use crudeness as a plot device. I certainly won't be reading the rest of the trilogy, and likely won't read anything Ken Follett writes in the future.
B001KZI2WW|2.0|The picture looks like a olive green color or something like that...well you will really receive a Brown color..(Expresso) Sending back for refund for wrong description. I am only rating the description...not the shoe! I have had crocs before and they are VERY COMFORTABLE!!!!  You will not regret the commfort!
B004EPYZU8|5.0|This was a great action film, from start to end. I liked the main hot girls, especially Baby Doll. It takes place in a mental asylum and Baby Doll has a few days to escape before she gets a lobotomy. She uses her mind to create an alternative world and every time she dances, she again goes into a different world, but where all the good action is at. The music was great and the whole idea and plot was wicked. A real hardcore film that packs a sucker punch!
B000I5X80G|5.0|I'll be the first to admit- I'm not the biggest Neil Young fan in the world.  In fact, many Neil Young fans downright frighten me for their obsession to collect every single thing the man has ever released.  As you are probably well aware by now, Neil Young has an enormous discography.  I wouldn't even begin to grasp the number of studio and live albums he's released over the last 45 years, but I imagine if one were to count, the number of albums would easily go beyond 100.    I can't fall under the category of being a hardcore collector.  I'm someone who simply admires the talent of Neil Young, enjoys his exceptional songwriting (whether it be country, blues, folk or hard rock or whatever other styles he's dabbled in over the years) and I ESPECIALLY love the guitar jams of Crazy Horse which usually leave me completely speechless and, in this case, pleasantly exhausted.  I'll also be the first to admit I've been criticial of some of Neil's more popular albums, such as On the Beach and Tonight's the Night (the latter of which I regret because it's actually a classic after all- it just took me a while to warm up to the darker than normal tone).    Now, the obvious standout tracks on Live at the Fillmore East are the two lengthy guitar jams.  They happen to be two of Neil's most popular jam-oriented songs that he's created over the years- \\"Cowgirl in the Sand\\" and \\"Down by the River\\".   Even after all these years, I simply have a difficult time choosing which of these two songs I get more enjoyment out of.  I can't decide.      However in this case, I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this version of \\"Cowgirl in the Sand\\".  I've never heard a guitar jam focus on emotion as much as this one does, and this includes everything else Neil Young and Crazy Horse have released up to this point in time (at least, the songs that I've heard- remember, I'm not a Neil Young fanboy so I haven't heard everything).      Alright, perhaps some of Frank Zappa's guitar jams present the same kindof emotional beauty, but this... wow, THIS version of \\"Cowgirl in the Sand\\" is a flawless performance.  We're talking about a guitar jam that absolutely refuses to let go of the serious grip it has over your attention span.  You won't want to hear the studio version after this... well I mean, modest Neil Young fans won't want to. :)    \\"Down by the River\\" has more terrific guitar playing focusing mainly on a neverending journey of melodic licks, but it's overshadowed by the emotional showcase that is \\"Cowgirl in the Sand\\".      Oh, and what's up with the album cover?  Why show other artists names such as the Moody Blues and Miles Davis on a cover for a Neil Young album?  Perhaps a nudge on the part of the record company to encourage listeners to buy the Fillmore sets of *those* bands too?  Assuming they actually have such a Fillmore set available for purchase, that is.     Anyway, pick up this Live at Fillmore East album by Neil Young.  I don't care how short it is- 40 minutes is a perfect length for an album anyway (especially one that will probably wear you out by the time it's over) so it shouldn't be a problem.
B002ZG975Q|4.0|It's a plain and simple very i know what comes next though still fun film to watch. A rich popular guy has a curse put on him by a very cool witch and the ugyliness from within him is now showing on the outside. He has to find someone who can love him for who he is. The film seemed real fast pace in the first twenty minutes, from this to this like that! After it slows down and it's just him trying to get the girl while dealing with a blind tutor and his house maid who's trying to get her children into the country. It was an ok film and funny enough, the main guy actually looked cooler and way more interesting after he was cursed, like don't get ride of the curse, you look much better.. haha...
0312945973|5.0|I attest that River God is a challenging, yet rewarding read.  Since the Taita character is a genius and his survival is based on wordplay, Smith employs advanced prose, a deep and vast vocabulary, and jargon as well.  For instance, the use of vocabulary is so extensive that often times Dictionary.com did not have the definition!  And many times Smith uses a little known definition of a word.  The use of nautical, equine, and military jargon was also common.  I found the ethnocentrism between Smith and Taita ironic:  Taita was proud of his Egyptian culture and held it in high esteem, while Smith would have Taita use Smith's British terms and phrasings.  For example, jewelery, sledge, manoeuvre, and so on, and I found this a point of amusement throughout the novel.  In a single sitting I found myself reading about 1/4 of what I normally can, so if you're looking for a \\"beach read\\", there are other books that qualify.  But read on, River God is worth taking your time and experiencing all it has to offer.    Other layers that added to the challenge include learning about the ancient Egyptian culture, tradition, religion, spirituality, economics, and geography.  It was fascinating to absorb and learn, and perhaps it is atypical that I will stop reading and research topics encountered in the text.  River God also has love stories, national scope, and an overall epic masterful story intertwined with all previously mentioned.  Nearly every literary archetype is represented here and is welcome.    But something that I didn't expect happened; I feel I am a better person after reading River God.  The maturation and lives of Taita, Tanus, Lostris, and others instilled a certain mentality and grace from the Egyptian culture and being.  Smith expertly crafts wisdom into his audience through the characters' experiences and I found this to be utterly fascinating.  Only one other work of fiction has affected me similarly, but not to the same depth and degree.    River God is like nothing I've read before.  It is a challenging read and worth treating with reverence.  If you allow yourself the complete experience, it is my belief you will feel you have changed in some way.  There are few novels that can transcend their text and make this claim.  River God is one of them.
B004LWZWEC|5.0|For me this was hell of a trip.     The old movie, wasn't that great (I was really disappointed on the quality). The quality is highly improved, especielly on the video quality: on the old one it was sloopy, it was dark, it was in low pixel, but now it has changed a lot. The colors from the spotlights are far better than before you can't really not compare it to the old one.     If you thought there would be new camara spots or a lot new material, then you'll properly get disapoint if you buy this. Yes there are some bonus material, but it's mostly photos & some rocker fellows talking 'bout the band.     For me the whole watching experience talks for it self and to watch this movie in High Definition [HD] is far better than watching it in low sloopy quality.     The sound is also improved, but not far as much as the video quality.    Conclusion the movie talks for it self & if you really want a better experience, than buy the new one in HD & see what modern technology can do.

B000O599ZS|5.0|I read a book called Magical Movie Moments and in the prologue it talks about what makes a movie great, what makes a movie memorable.  Well, it is moments- visual or lyrical moments.  Moments- good or bad that burn into your mind and are hard to forget.  A good movie has these moments.  Well, the Searchers has many of these moments.  The film opens with the camera looking out of a dark cabin as a door opens to a western vista with sun, and clouds, and landscape that is just beautiful.  This is a \\"wow\\" moment probably much better when seen on a big screen in an old movie theatre.  Then there is a scene that i cant get out of my head, where John Wayne and his comrade confront some white women who've gone crazy from being captured and brutalized by indians.  The look on the women's faces were haunting only to be outdone by the look on John Wayne's face as he leaves the room.  He turns to look again and the camera closes in on his anguished and angered face.  Almost like their mental sickness is inhabiting him for a moment.  This alone could be why this movie is Wayne's greatest acting moment.  Unbelievable.  Then finally, the last scene seen through that same doorway (actually a different doorway) looking out onto the wild wild west with John Wayne looking in at his family and friends.  Then he wheels around in the best iconic John Wayne move and walks away.  Almost like a Charlie Chaplin bittersweet ending -but western style.  These are the moments that make a great movie, moments that haunt you for days after, and this is one of those great memorable movies.  I cant wait to watch it again!
B0051OZ564|2.0|some great special effects and action scenes but these get tiring after a while. overall very depressing movie that seemed to be trying to express some overarching deeper meaning. It failed. Miserably.Really,really not worth the time or the money.
B003NRWW58|5.0|This is a spin-off of Doctor Who but  stands alone as cross-over episodes are not common.  It is grittier than Doctor Who which I very much enjoy.<br /><br />This is a show for fun, but if you are looking for it there is plenty of social commentary in the script.  There are some storylines that are geared toward adults.<br /><br />The lead actor is adorable!<br /><br />If you are fan of crime shows, sci-fi shows and campy humor this is the show for you.
B0050LJIRK|5.0|The album is great. It will grow on you after a few spins, because well we haven't heard material from Limp Bizkit in awhile. If you are a fan you will not be disappointed. I purchased the cd from Best Buy because it comes with a few extra tracks, it was worth it. It has groove and great lyrics. I would have to say it seems to have a lot more feel with out over production almost raw but in a good way. For people who do not like Limp Bizkit give them another chance, I know they haven't been \\"in\\" but it's ok to like music even though the band has lost it's popularity. You will find that Wes has matured his style and it shows. The bass lines and drums are as powerfully and groovy as you would hope. The track names may seem kinda of corny but that's what Limp Bizkit is all about having fun and enjoying a good time.
0061780308|4.0|I will admit that I'm always wondering what our dogs thought of us as humans and, though our author goes a bit overboard, I am the first to guess that most dogs are more intelligent than what we give them credit for.  Enter Enzo, a farm-born mixed breed of lab and terrier descent who ponders the world of mankind and knows that one day he will be rewarded with the life of a human, though he deems them inferior to his species.  He is still funny, loyal, and sweet as he stands beside his racecar driving master Denny in some over-the-top mellowdramas.  He even knows what ceramic brake rotors are for when I never even heard of them!  The important thing is that he stands beside Denny through lost love, financial hardship, and sharing a pure adrenaline rush for cars like his master.  This is a touching and bittersweet tale told by a wonderfully devout dog on the last night of his life.  It's easy to see why some reviewers don't like it, but I was enthralled because I love every dog we have ever owned--several--and I like to think that they are as intelligent and prone to a better life the next time around as a reward.  Enzo is fabulous, and I can't help thinking my current dog is as smart as he is.
B0050I2PQE|3.0|I won't recap all of what is on here as others will do that.     For Deep Purple fans of this era it's a good product. You are essentially watching the demise of the band. What struck me on the concert footage was how good the quality was, because all I had ever seen was horrendous quality out -of -synch footage. The sound is really good and the picture is pretty good too.(Considering the era and previous versions) No synch issues. Sound and picture match up pretty well.    Ian Paice is just awesome on this show! If only he would play like this now! He's always been great, but he was exceptionally so on \\"Burn\\", \\"Come taste the band\\", and \\"Malice in Wonderland\\". He is really aggressive on this show. David Coverdale sings really well here too. Glenn Hughes, even when high, is a more dynamic bassist than Roger Glover. The band's core members know the band is compromised and they are trying hard to compensate, but it is what it is....It's a band without a guitarist that night.      As for Tommy Bolin? He is so bad on this show it is staggering to witness. Hard to believe he was capable of some of the great solos we all know from \\"Spectrum\\", \\"Mind Transplant\\", \\"Whips and Roses\\", \\"Ebbits Field\\" etc.   Jon Lord covers many of the riffs due to Bolin's supposed \\"hurt/numb arm\\" during this show. Bolin's stage presence is almost non-existent in comparison to Blackmore too. Just a shame all around as he just doesnt seem vested in the music. One of the booklets has an interesting quote from Lord about how Blackmore maintained a level of virtuosity even when not playing his best, and really didn't fall below that certain level.  Yet he intimates that Bolin sunk deeply at times. I've seen Blackmore on bad nights and nothing compares to this feeble Bolin performance. You will get no satisfaction of Bolin's guitar playing from this footage.    I saw this line-up in Providence Rhode Island later on during the US leg of the tour and Bolin was still only \\"adequate\\". Again he just seemed uninterested in what he was doing. I am a fan of his playing though, and we have do the great jazz fusion albums he played on!.... The guy could really play when he wanted to :)     I recommend the product to anyone who likes this era of the band, and especially to anyone who likes the incredible new remaster/remix of \\"Come Taste the Band\\" (Remix by Kevin Shirley) This DVD has a cool booklet too, which features some pretty interesting quotes and information from some of the peripheral business people surrounding Purple. I like hearing the members discuss the band, so the documentary portion is great to have and does hold up to repeat viewings. I can't wait to see a one-star review from someone saying \\"the concert is only 30 minutes man\\" (Or, I didn't receive the item\\")... :) :)      When you put it into perspective how little there is on this era of the band, it's a pretty cool product. I'll give it 3 stars although I'd like to give it 4. The only thing that would have made it better would be Bolin's actual playing. Perhaps some other personnel being interviewed would have been nice too. Glenn Hughes put it best \\"It's a postcard from that time frame of the band\\". This DVD illustrates the turmoil within the band over the drug issues of Hughes & Bolin. If you realize that going in you will probably find it a satisfying product.  In summery it's a good DVD if you know what you are buying, but NOT a good place to start for someone new to Purple's output.     Ps. There is an interesting but strange disclaimer at the end of the documentary stating that Glenn Hughes and Jon Lords comments revolving around the death of Patsy Collins are not necessarilly reflective of David Coverdales. Very strange. I wonder what Coverdale thought happened?????
1594484805|3.0|This was a tough book to review because I didn't love it; but I found most of it to be interesting. I didn't hate it; because there is nothing to hate about Daniel Pink's passion, research, or writing. So what gives? Perhaps the fact that this book just happned to be the last in a series of books on the topic of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation that I've read. Noted psychologists and authorities on the topic of motivation, Carol Dweck (\\"Mindset\\"), and Edward Deci (\\"Why We Do What We Do\\") are heavily cited in \\"Drive,\\" which just happens to be two of the first books that I read on the subject.<br /><br />Therein lies my dilemma. If you happen to be someone (or a student) who is unfamiliar with motivational psychology, \\"Drive\\" will probably be a good book for you (once you remember the whole Motivation 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 schemas that are used as a point of reference in every chapter). Yes, it's educational, and intelligent; however, it's really just orange juice made from concentrate. If you want the real deal, purchase the aforementioned books, or Google the abstracts by their authors. You don't know how much better freshly squeezed orange juice tastes until you have it.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|I received an e-mail last week from a mutual vendor that announced John Locke's 1 million eBook sales. Even more compelling was finding out that he is an Indy author. I was immediately intrigued and then pleased (but not surprised) to see he wrote a book about how he did it! I read it on the Kindle app on my iPhone (my Kindle didn't arrive till today) and didn't put it down till done...well, maybe once.<br /><br />Locke's approach, having tried all of the traditional ones to not much avail, brings home the concept that good 'ol fashioned communication using today's technologies (primarily Twitter and a blog) is what it takes to reach your audience and sell books. Is his pricing low? Yes. Does that devalue his books? No. Not in my opinion, and he states clearly why he believes his books ought to be priced at the 99 cents that you pay...and why this one is not 99 cents.<br /><br />There are no quick fix answers. No gimmicks involved. Instead he builds relationships, a following, and credibility. As my title says, he is brilliant and methodical in his approach...and in that regard, the turtle wins the race.<br /><br />As an author, did I already implement much of his advice? You bet I did. You can buy the first two books in my Unforgettable: Write Your Story series for 99 cents each on Kindle. But, that's not where his suggestions or methodology ends, and definitely not where I would want them to. I'm implementing the rest and am already seeing a difference. So, yes, I highly recommend this book.<br /><br />Heather Hummel, Author<br />[[ASIN:B001UV3FMS Through Hazel Eyes (Unforgettable: Write Your Story)]]<br />[[ASIN:B00318D72Q The Universe Is My Sugar Daddy (Unforgettable: Write Your Story)]]
0062060554|2.0|The premise was good, and the author is certainly a skilled writer, but this book is clearly a \\"first-effort.\\"  It was slow, predictable, and didn't utilize the variety of writing styles demanded by the various sections of the text.  If I had not read the reviews that said this was some sort of psychological thriller, I don't think I would have gotten that until the end - it read like a standard tragedy of a woman with a memory disorder...  the suspense seemed forced, and particularly heavy-handed... in almost every \\"journal\\" entry, she goes on and on about how/why she should love her husband... I felt beat over the head with \\"here's where the twist will be!\\"  On a similar note, I thought the structure of the character reading her own journal was smart, but as other reviewers have indicated, there should have been a personal, journal-istic style to these sections, rather than continued standard novel dialogue format... Run-ons, stream-of-consciousness, haphazard structures, would have added to the authenticity of the sections, as well as helped build the frantic tension and panic in the character.  Overall, Watson has promise, but this book is a beach-read at best, and, honestly, there are better beach thrillers out there this summer.
B0050CQY1W|1.0|The people that are stating that this CD is \\"amazing\\" - \\"it's her best\\" - \\"it's really great\\" must be die-hard BeYAWNce fans.  This CD sucks! She needs to grow up and do better music. Maybe she's trying to cross over to some other genre and that's a good thing to reinvent yourself but it's not working and we all know it's not working because she's barely getting any radio play. Most of the songs she's over singing or yelling, other songs the track is just terrible. I will not be rushing out to buy this at all.
B004LWZW24|4.0|I loved being able to watch a movie that has some scenes that make you jump without a bunch of gore. I liked the ending and I enjoyed being able to get into the movie even with missing the first few minutes. It was a little too cliched with the mom being all hysterical and believing in the supernatural and the dad being resistent to the idea. Other than that it was fun to watch and i plan to buy it.
B0041KKYEW|1.0|I found this to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  Acting was good, plot was terrible.
B004SUDPXW|5.0|it's hard to believe that a show would paint a drug maker as the good guy and cops are the bad guy, but somehow it's worked for three years.<br /><br />this is the best season so far. and i won't spoil it for those that are on the fence thinking \\"how could they\\". Just start with season 1 and continue to the third (and hopefully NOT the last)<br /><br />Brian Cranston plays a would be meth cooker who, helped by a former student, gets into many life and death situations that seem to be hard for the writers to write them out of. the end of the third season is no different. there are several cliff hangers left unresolved, i am dieing for season four NOW.<br /><br />this is a great show, and just watching it you can tell why it is winning all the awards over other shows with plots that are rehashed from previous shows or have story lines that start out as dramas and end up as love stories. this is a refreshing story, though sometimes intense, it is still refreshing to watch something different from a TV show
0062060554|5.0|It has been quite some time since I have read a book that captured me so completely that I wanted to ignore the kids and call into work sick just so I could continue reading this book.     I bought this book on a whim based upon the many good reviews, but you never know if it is going to live up to your own standards versus others opinions.  Fortunately, this book was a winner for me, despite a boring premise: a woman has amnesia and is unable to remember her past.  She has a journal where she writes things that people tell her about her life or little memories that she recalls.  Her doctor must call her everyday to remind her where she has hidden her journal so that she can write in it during the day.   When she goes to sleep, she will wake up remembering nothing of the day before.  Not her name.  Not her husband.  Nothing.  But she has written on her journal, \\"Do Not Trust Ben\\", her husband.  Was her husband responsible for her accident causing the amnesia?  Was it a bout of paranoia?  The unexpected plot twist at the end was a delight - a reminder of why I love to read.      Very enjoyable book and I'm hoping the author's second novel will be as equally successful.
0811869261|4.0|This is a gorgeous book, Marc Boutavant is a stunning illustrator.  This book has a nice fat puffy hard cover with thick glossy pages and comes with stickers.  We got this four our girls when they were about 3 years old, mistake.  We had to remove and hide the stickers so they didn't tear into them and use them up poorly, and the words were just not engaging to them, even at age 4 they are still not engaged by the text when read to them.  Also important to note, we found that it is a little difficult to read the text (small text on dark colors on pages super busy crammed with lots of little images).  I think this book is better for older kids who read well on their own.  The idea behind it is great, and it is a little educational in terms of what other places are like.  It was just not well suited for what we were/are after, an engaging picture book that we parents read to our little ones.  I think this is still a very worthwhile book and I am glad we own it and the girls will enjoy a lot one day, they will have fun reading it, looking at the pictures almost like an I spy because there is much there to see on each page, and putting the stickers on the pages in the book, so I would recommend this book and would still buy it again, but just for slightly older kids.
0345529057|3.0|Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love Amazon. But, this is the first time Amazon has disappointed me. First off the packaging is a complete mess. The plastic wrap was open on all four sides and the box itself is ripped on two of the corners. On top of that I didn't get a invoice/receipt for my order. So now that I want to return it and get a new set, I can't because I don't have the original receipt that it should have came with and on top of that the original packaging is compromised. I don't even want to open the set to make sure the books have all the right pages like someone else said on one of the reviews. Sorry to say Amazon, but I'm not happy.
B0050LJIRK|4.0|Oh, Limp Bizkit. The first album with the original band members since 2000's Chocolate Starfish and the Hotdog Flavored Water isn't at all how I expected it to be. Gone are many of the slower and slightly more accessible tunes from Chocolate Starfish and Results May Vary (with the exception of Walking Away, which is really good) and instead, we have an album much more along the lines of the rougher and more intense-sounding 3 Doller Bill Y'all mixed with a little Significant Other for good measure. We have a band here that's clearly been re-energized and ready to go back to heavier music and the results are, musically, very impressive. Wes Borland tears it up on the guitar, and Sam, John, and DJ Lethal are also in top form. The production's incredible; this is a fantastic-sounding record, with the mixing done perfectly. You can clearly hear all the instruments at all times. Bring it Back starts the album off after the intro and it's got not only an incredibly catchy beat but a heavy and fast chorus, and really doesn't sound like anything I've heard before. This is how rap metal would sound today if it still existed, I guess.    This great sound quality is evident throughout the album, to the point where I couldn't even believe it. Autotunage is the best example of a stupid idea (jokingly putting autotune over heavy rock) that, again, beyond my understanding, ended up with a song that sounds amazing. The song's as headbanging as most of the rest of them. Just when I find myself shaking my head in disbelief at the bad lyrics in a song like Get a Life, the final third blows me away again with the great guitar work which reminded me of the last 1/3 of It'll be Okay from Chocolate Starfish. Little touches strewn throughout this album serve to remind us of songs from past Limp Bizkit albums and they're pretty fun bits of fanservice. Shark Attack is pretty much Break Stuff Part 2 and Fred Durst is sure to make that clear with the first line of the song.     There's even some cool experimentation here with songs like the aforementioned Autotunage and Loser, which has a really cool sound. Shotgun demonstrates Wes Borland's ability to create catchy guitar riffs during the verses, and it works well with the chorus.     It's certainly not a flawless work...(even besides the lyrics, which I'll get to later)... Gold Cobra, the title track, is a pretty forgettable lead single, and 90.2.10 is just stupid. Killer in You is equally dumb and ends the album on an anti-climactic note. But for the most part, we have a selection of tight, fast, aggressive, and fun tracks. Musically the band should be proud.     Now, lyrically......things are pretty bad. This is to be expected from Limp Bizkit, but even on their past albums their song lyrics have had more variety than this. Though Fred Durst *attempts* some depth with Loser and Walking Away, much of the rest of this is either attempts at party songs or songs about wanting to kick someone's ass. It gets old and it's pretty shallow. There's also far too much rapping on this CD, which I don't get; Fred shows that he can still do a great scream, and even his singing voice isn't bad at all. Still, he lets his rapping dominate most of the verses on this CD, which is too bad because he's just not very good at it. This isn't a band that wants to be taken seriously, as Fred and Wes have said countless times leading up to this album, but still, it's unfortunate that while sometimes the lyrics work very well with the music, at others, it feels like the music's...well, up ^here, and then the lyrics are waaaaay down lower.     Still, this may be one of the few times I've ever said this, but if you can just sort of set the lyrics aside and appreciate how well Fred Durst's voice works with the music....even though his lyrics often don't, just appreciate this CD for its great music, and tolerate some of the laughable lyrics. I wish Fred would aim higher, as he's shown on past albums (and even in a line or 2 on thisone) that he can write solid lyrics. He just needs to put more effort into it. And do less rapping.     Anyway, Gold Cobra is a fun, fast, heavy, and quick listen, and it's a great return to form for the band. I said this in my review of Results May Vary, but it still applies, sadly. If they could just stop singing about stupid crap, they seriously can be more than just a fun guilty pleasure. And they have the talent to be.
0812973992|5.0|I wasn't sold on this book in the beginning, but I very quickly fell in love with it and was thoroughly moved by the end!      What an amazing read!
B004LFO0ME|1.0|Wiz Khalifa has no lyrical ability whatsoever in this album, it's just a bunch of played out radio songs for the \\"Lyrically challenged\\" listeners and forcer weedheads.
B0050CQY1W|2.0|I must admit that listened to the entire album on AOL while it was there, about 2 times.  I love Beyonce. She's a great performer.  But this album shows that she still has not evolved. A few of the songs sample some old school hits, but she doesn't ADD flavor to them.  Instead, they leave me wanted to hear the original songs and singers.  Personally, I love the song I Care, but that's about it.  She yells (not sings) on most of the songs as though she is trying to force herself into the music.  The best artists have done well when they were emotionally invested into their music.  Music is an artistic expression that conveys things.  This album is just a commercially packaged singer - almost like a cover band that can generally sing, but doesn't bring it like the original.  Last, I wanted to like the song that were samples of old school hits, but again her yelling took away from them.  My fiance says that what Beyonce should do is just be normal, turn it down.  I think she needs to become and show maturity with means balance and not extreme.  I look forward to see if they are ever going to turn her music career back up instead of down.
B000000OR9|5.0|\\"Blue murder\\" is the self titled debut album of the melodic hard rock/glam metal group featuring guitarist/vocalist John Sykes, drum legend Carmine Appice and bassist Tony Franklin, originally released in 1989. Having composed and recorded one of the top selling rock albums of the 80s as a member of \\"Whitesnake\\", John Sykes was removed from the ranks of the band, though offered a solo album deal by \\"Geffen Records\\". The musicians that would accompany him were arguably the ideal complement for Sykes; Carmine, the very definition of hard rock drummer, had released a series of quality 80s rock albums as the leader of \\"King Kobra\\" while Tony Franklin being the fretless bass master in hard rock sealed the enviable rhythm section.<br /><br />Conceptually the approach on the \\"Blue Murder\\" debut is similar to that of \\"Whitesnake-1987\\" Thick riffs, catchy choruses, endless amount of harmonies, romantic, often sexual, lyrics as well as substantial ballads. In addition \\"Blue murder\\" retain to a certain extent the \\"Whitesnake\\" groove which is expected to differ somewhat being performed by such an original rhythm section. Songs like \\"Sex child\\", \\"Black hearted woman\\", \\"Billy\\", \\"Blue murder\\" and are first class melodic hard rock material, particularly the first two songs named could have easily served for a \\"Whitesnake\\" release. These is also the incredible heartbreaker ballad \\"Out of love\\" very much in the style of \\"Is this love\\" only more intense and dramatic.<br /><br />Indeed \\"Blue Murder\\" picks up where \\"Whitesnake-1987\\" left off, unquestionably the album bares a personality of its own, yet evidently conceived on the same principles that made \\"1987\\" such an iconic record. It is rather unfortunate that \\"Blue murder\\" was to be the only album recorded by this stellar line up.
0451228375|4.0|There are some differences.    While \\"The Pillars of the Earth\\" had a strong start, \\"World Without End\\" spends the first 100 pages introducing the characters (there are quite a few characters on this book) and taking its time. In the beginning, I confess I was lost a couple of times wondering who is who, who is son of who, who is brother of who and so on.    Eventually the drama and suspense unfolds and the book becomes a page turner, resembling the pace and style of \\"The Pillars of the Earth\\".    My only criticism is that this book is a little bit too long. I understand that Follett wanted a 1000 pages book, but I wonder if he had material for that. On the last third of the book, I found that he stretched the story a bit, more or less like those soap operas with their never ending story.    Nevertheless, this is a good and entertained reading.     Despite the fact that \\"World Without End\\" is not continuation of \\"The Pillars of the Earth\\", I recommend reading \\"The Pillars of the Earth\\" first. It gives you a little bit of inside information.
B0050CQY1W|5.0|I'm very impressed with Beyonce new cd \\"4\\".  The music has great harmony and melody that lingers for a long time.  One of the best CDs of 2011!!.
B002VPE1XE|4.0|It is really worth for the money but beware of the size. I bought this one for Sony H70 and cover is quit a big in size.
B004PVKFR8|5.0|I've never written a review on Amazon before, but this album deserves it.  There's only one track I don't care for... all the others are amazing, and different from each other.    There's a bit of a Queen vibe, some Mika, a lot of Rock, some electronica, and some hip hop.    Fantastic album.  I listen to a lot of music and this is easily my favorite album of the last few years.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|I loved this movie when I saw it in the theater, and wanted to own a copy.  It's a one-of-a-kind musical, totally original and a little quirky, not predictable.  The music is terrific and the acting is totally natural.  I recommend it to anyone who loves good music and complex characterizations.
1594202842|1.0|My mother got this book out of the library and gave it to me to read.  I am just about half way through the book and refuse to read anymore. Thank God I didn't pay for it and put money in this woman's pocket!  I am both a teacher and a mother and this book continuously made me cringe!  I pity the poor daughters who put up with their mother's nonsense.  She prides herself on being overbearing and doing battle against her younger more rebellious daughter. She throws in her readers' faces the fact that both she and her husband have professorships at Yale and Harvard, that she worked for a Wall Street Law Firm and was bored.  She acts like she has something to prove to the world and has to make her mark.  It sort of sickened me how she continuously boasted throughout the first half of the book and criticized the American way of childraising and teaching like she, being second/third generation American, has the knowledge to condemn how children are raised here.   American parents praise their children for all the wrong reasons.  The Chinese way is the best way!  If she didn't wish to raise her children in this country, why did she stay here is my question. And worse yet? Why did the Jewish white American husband put up with all her nonsense and the way she pushed those children???
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Great graphics and good fun. There's definitely some strategy involved. The load time seems a little long but not enough to lose a star. Looking at the pictures just now made me excited to play again!

B004LROMSO|2.0|I love King Arthur and his legendary knights, whether it's gritty \\"historical\\" stories or a pile of medieval anachronisms a la Malory.<br /><br />But the once and future king has really gotten more than his fair share of rotten movies and TV, and the latest disaster is \\"Camelot.\\" No, not the Broadway musical or the movie adaptation -- this is Starz's attempt at updating the timeless Arthurian legends (which don't NEED updating), which just turns into a silly, sloppy and overly PC mess.<br /><br />The evil princess Morgan (Eva Green) murders her father Uther, exiles her stepmother, and allies herself with her dad's enemy King Lot. But Merlin (Joseph Fiennes) is having none of this, and hunts down Uther's secret illegitimate son Arthur (Jamie Campbell Bower), who has been raised by an adoptive family in the country. With Merlin's guidance and training (in rock-climbing), Arthur claims the throne --and gains Morgan's wrath.<br /><br />He also falls in love with Guinevere (Tamsin Egerton), the beautiful young wife of a loyal knight, and is deftly manipulated by Merlin in decidedly unmagical ways, sometimes with bloody outcomes. As young Arthur struggles to unite Britain under him, he must deal with Morgan constantly trying to undermine his rule and his power -- but with little idea of just how far she will go.<br /><br />The idea behind \\"Camelot\\" is not a bad one, and even the rewriting of Arthurian lore (the origins of Excalibur) aren't that bad. The problem is in the execution. This series wants to be a plot-heavy, gritty, authentic \\"Game of Thrones\\"-esque story, but it's actually more of a silly, anachronistic BCC \\"Robin Hood\\" (complete with multiculturalism and modern feminism, which makes it doubly ridiculous).<br /><br />Yeah, this is one of those series where the costumes, sets, perfectly-coiffed hair and even some of the beautiful scenery all feel like they were lifted from a Renaissance Faire. There's no feeling of timeless grandeur, epicness or awe -- instead, it sometimes feels like \\"King Arthur: The Legendary Journeys.\\" Additionally, the main storyline is.... rather weak, especially since the straightforward Morgan's plans for overthrowing Arthur get downright silly.<br /><br />As for the acting, it's a mixed bag. Fiennes is wonderfully conniving and Machievellian as Merlin, almost to the point of being villainous, Peter Mooney is dynamic as Kay, and Green is brilliantly wrenching as a destructive yet wronged young woman.<br /><br />However, Bower's Arthur is a massive twerp, with zero presence or charisma. He's a skinny surfer-dudeish kid whose appeal is honestly a total mystery. I mean, his Arthur only decides to become king because HE CAN SCORE WITH GIRLS. Who can take that seriously? As for Egerton, she's painfully awkward and rather flat, and her character is Mary-Sueish to the extreme.<br /><br />\\"Camelot\\" is a painful experience -- not just because it's a lackluster, weakly-plotted series, but because it could have easily been so much more. Give it a pass.he Legendary Journeys.\\" Additionally, the main storyline is.... rather weak, especially since the straightforward Morgan's plans for overthrowing Arthur get downright silly.    As for the acting, it's a mixed bag. Fiennes is wonderfully conniving and Machievellian as Merlin, almost to the point of being villainous, Peter Mooney is dynamic as Kay, and Green is brilliantly wrenching as a destructive yet wronged young woman.     However, Bower's Arthur is a massive twerp, with zero presence or charisma. He's a skinny surfer-dudeish kid whose appeal is honestly a total mystery. I mean, his Arthur only decides to become king because HE CAN SCORE WITH GIRLS. Who can take that seriously? As for Egerton, she's painfully awkward and rather flat, and her character is Mary-Sueish to the extreme.    \\"Camelot\\" is a painful experience -- not just because it's a lackluster, weakly-plotted series, but because it could have easily been so much more. Give it a pass.
B002JVWR4U|5.0|Yeah, I know, you can't trust totally about the  reviews from hardcore fans because is hard not to be biased in a away or another, but...this second season of Dollhouse is absolutely amazing! smart and catchy and fast paced action from end to end, it's a shame it has to be finished this way, but what a awesome way to left a landmark on how to make a high quality, funny, adult, clever T.V. show. Thanks to the previous development of the first season this story arc gone to a level hard to find in a current series. The extra features are some kinda better than the first season, and the guest starring cast will blow you up, believe me if there was a nirvana for the geeks in 2010 this one was for sure, and in there was a small comic book as a gift! I'm full and thanx to the people who made Dollhouse possible!
B004EPYZUI|2.0|I bought this movie thinking it was going to be a kick ass action movie with hot girls, well at least they got the last part right. It almost seems like they either had two writers write completely different stories and then piece them together or they wanted to add \\"depth\\" to a movie that was a TnA action movie. Honestly with movies like this, or what it should have been, I don't want to \\"think\\" that hard, if I want that I'll watch Inception or Pans Lanbrynth. It's like she's crazy and imagines herself as a berlesque dancer but that imaginary world is so messed up she imagines herself in another imaginary world fighting things.....what??! Other than the girls(especially Jamie Chung and Vanessa Hudgens) being hot and maybe 2 good imaginary fight scenes, I would'nt recommend this to anyone.
B0002XNRG4|1.0|This is a great lens, but it let me down at the worst possible moment. After 40 years of using Canons, I can never totally trust this lens, or Canon cameras. I got an error message saying the camera was not communicating with the lens and I needed to clean the contacts on the lens which I did several times without success. Then I swapped out the battery, turned off auto focus and image stabilizer, pulled the chip and put it back in, etc. All I got was a black screen and the error message. Then I pulled the lens from my 60D and mounted it on my 30D and still the same. Here I am on a road trip for my book a thousand miles from home and after a year of planning. Is this just an anomaly? No. My daughter had the same lens it and it failed her too. Like I said, if you're in this position, you need a backup lens and a backup body. I don't know what's going on with Canon, but either workmanship or engineering is in decline. I bought a 60D in April and the flash refused to pop up within a couple of weeks of purchase which Canon fixed under warranty. And by the way they won't pay for shipping. It cost me $33 for shipping and insuring to send it 40 miles to the West Coast service center. Today I'm driving down to Redding, CA to pick out a Tamron lens which is just what my daughter did. I'll get a repair estimate from Canon which I expect will be at least $180. If it's too high, the lens goes in the dumpster. Good luck.
B000002JSN|1.0|Along with other Led Zeppelin CD's I've purchased from Amazon this sounds muddy and flat.  An absolutely horrible remaster apparently from Argentina.  I guess Warner has no interest in investing money in producing a quality sounding product for one of the very best rock/blues bands that ever existed. I've listened to it on my car Bose system and my Onkyo component home stereo.  The track previews on the page sounded better than the CD itself.  A total waste and a darn shame.  At least I've still got my vinyl.
076115728X|5.0|Both of my daughters LOVE this book.  No matter how many times I told them art isn't always prefect they just didn't understand.  I woulld show them how to make a mistake cooler but they needed someone other then Mom to tell them. They wanted to take this book to show and tell and I know it did help other friends. My daughters are 4 and 7.<br /><br />Art is so subjective.  Their imagination has been stimulated even more. They see amazing little pieces og art everywhere one.  I highly recommend this book.

0674057929|5.0|What made Oscar Wild(e)?<br />  The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press has published a new edition of Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray. While there is no burning need for such a volume in the day of Lady Gaga and marriage equality, it's important to remember that Wilde spent two years in prison for being gay and for having the guts (stupidity?) to flaunt his sexuality. In many ways, it was the flaunting rather than the act themselves that so angered his persecutors.<br />  And Dorian Gray, his first and only novel, was certainly a shot fired directly into the heart of Victorian prudery.<br />  And in this day of Kindles, e-books and tweets, this is truly a magnificent job of bookmaking. Oversized, lavishly illustrated and gorgeously presented, Oscar would have loved it. The text is examined minutely, with a variety of comparisons from various publications of the novel, as well as Wilde's original manuscript. While there's nothing particularly new to discover in the emendations from the sources, merely a reinforcement of the outrageousness inherent in the piece, the scholarship is both astounding and informative.<br />  The annotator and editor, Nicholas Frankel, easily and effortlessly places the modern reader in Wilde's time and place, London's late Victorian Age in London. There is still a tingle to Dorian's story of endless debauchery while he remains looking pure and innocent for decades and the painting ages and grows monstrous, reflecting his sins and crimes.<br />  Strangely, the book seems more modern than one would imagine. Rather than merely a potboiler from two centuries back, WIlde's genius imbues the story with a strange and haunting immediacy, and a cautionary tale for us all: Be careful what you wish for.<br />  One could hardly wish for a more beautifully accoutered book.
0307346617|3.0|I am obsessed with post apocalyptic fiction and I enjoyed reading World War Z as it was a different approach to this genre. It was however not as engrossing as I would have liked it to be.     The book was set up as transcripts of interviews with survivors from around the world. The author must have done a lot of research as it was full of details about military policies, ranks and geographical information from many different cultures. It gave a lot of different perspectives from officials (military/health/government) rather than regular survivors and it did have a sense of a time line or progression but it didn't feel like it was all tied together. It lacked emotion or a personal perspective. It felt very detached. There was no narrative.     I would recommend it as something different. I just wouldn't suggest it is a stand out in its field.     Instead try Beyond Armageddon or After Armageddon.
B001OQCV6K|3.0|I purchased this blueray version specifically for the digital copy & DVD regular.  I don't own a blueray player, I only play my dvd's right now on my laptop.  So, when I tried to redeem my \\"digital copy\\"(I wanted a digital copy to upload to my iPod for portability when I travel, etc.) iTunes said the offer was expired.  So that means at least I have the DVD regular version.  However, I've half a mind to sue for false advertising--a gal has to make a buck somehow in this screwed economy.  Maybe if I purchased from the Warner Brothers website the digital may not have been expired but I would have paid twice the Amazon price--and if WB's was expired I'd still be screwed out of my digital copy--another reason to sue for false advertising.  On the Warner Brothers website it advertises the digital copy. Anyway, this is a 2 disc set--the blue ray disc and the regular dvd with an expired \\"digital copy.\\"  fyi--make what you will of the movie--I loved it, that's why I purchased it after seeing it on Netflix.  I wanted to watch it more than once--love Robert Downey Jr., Jude Law, Kelly Reilly, and Rachel McAdams after seeing her perform for the 1st time on screen.  Thanks Guy Ritchie for a fantastic ride!
1439181780|5.0|Love this book. It points out the obvious that most of us are too busy to remember. When we are spouting negativity, then negativity enters our lives. When we focus on love, sending thoughts of love to all portions of our lives then that love returns to us. So worth the few dollars it costs. It can change your life.
0307477479|3.0|I'm one of those folks who picked up \\"A Visit from the Goon Squad\\" only because it won Jennifer Egan the Pulitzer Prize. Because I'm no great lover of contemporary fiction (Sophocles is more my cup of tea), my expectations were low; but I ended up enjoying this book, flaws and all, to an extent that surprised me.    As many other reviewers have pointed out, \\"Goon Squad\\" has an unusual structure; it reads more like a collection of linked short stories than a novel with a single thread. To me, these \\"short story\\" segments were of highly variable quality. An early segment, set in Africa, did absolutely nothing for me (with Egan managing to make even a lion attack sound dull); but a later story set in Italy, with a similar travelogue vibe, worked well. Much of my enjoyment depended on how interested I was in a particular set of characters. Egan's middle-aged womanizer character simply bored me, but I found an academic dude with a dysfunctional family to be quite engaging. I guess that when you're dealing with episodic fiction like this, it's inevitable that one's interest will wax and wane a bit...    Speaking of the characters, many reviewers have complained that they're \\"unlikable\\" or \\"unpleasant.\\" Honestly, I've always found this to be a silly complaint, especially when applied to serious literature. Egan's characters are indeed flawed and often unpleasant - rather like real people - and they deserve the same degree of indulgence and forgiveness that we give to real people. The only thing that I can't forgive is a *boring* character; unpleasantness is just fine by me. Unfortunately, on this point, Egan's writing is again a little uneven; while characters like Bennie and Scott come to life nicely on the page, other characters fall flat. (An amusing trend is that the duller characters tend to have contrived names - e.g. \\"Chronos\\" and \\"La Doll\\" - which seemed a poor substitute for making them truly interesting.)    As far as themes go, the book touches on some timely stuff - celebrity culture, technology, depression, and so on - but I found that some of its observations were a little too predictable. At this point, I'm quite aware that yes, much of contemporary music is soulless corporate product. Do I need such a readily observable thing pointed out to me yet again? More surprising, to me, was Egan's vision of a near-future New York City in which young people don't curse and don't have tattoos ... I'll believe that when I see it. :-)    In the final analysis, then, my reaction to the book was mixed. I found it to be slow going at first, but gradually I got drawn into its complex universe of linked characters and events. I'm not one of those folks who think that Egan absolutely didn't deserve the Pulitzer, but I'm not exactly thrilled by the notion that this could possibly be the best book of the year. I think it blows something like \\"Super Sad True Love Story\\" out of the water, yet I can't give \\"Goon Squad\\" more than three stars; it's interesting and semi-experimental, but to me it's only partly successful.
B004SBX112|1.0|With the latest updates this app has become very disappointing. The fact that I have to be on wifi just to load the levels is frustrating to say the least.  Kind of defeats the purpose of having it on a mobile phone...
B000001FS3|3.0|First of all I'm going to start by saying that I'm a huge U2 fan. I love the albums boy, war, achtung baby, and the unforgettable fire, but for some reason I just fail to see what's so great about Joshua tree. I love the first four songs though. The album opening with where the streets have no name is truly fantastic and one of the best album openings of all time. Other then this however I miss the appeal. After bullet the blue sky the rest of the album seems very mediocre by U2 standards. So my opinion about the reason why this album is so popular is because the first three songs are three of the greatest songs of all time. Those three songs are the only reason why I listen to this album, but three great songs can't make an album great. In fact an album could be great without any great songs. So in conclusion the Joshua tree is one of the most overrated albums ever. It's sad for me to say this about one of my favorite bands.
B0047Y17P2|1.0|What a colossal waste of time. I just finished The Fifth Witness and I'm grateful that I can move on to more interesting and better written books. The book is blandly written with no character development and a transparent story line. Typically, whenever a Michael Connelly book comes out, I buy it immediately. But no more--from now on I will read a chapter or two before committing to a  Connelly book. Such it is with credibility--you lose it, it's gone for a very long time.
B002ZG99CC|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies and amazon saved me time by avoiding going to the store and also had the best price online.
B002ZCY7SW|5.0|I am a devoted fan of 24.   LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!!!!   I have the entire collection, and I have never seen a production like this, where there is non-stop action all the time and I could not wait for the next 24, because the series was such a pleasure for me to watch each week.     I am so heartbroken knowing the eighth season is the last, because it left me wanting more!!.  It makes you wish that there really could be a Jack Bauer, a CTU agency, and all the good stuff that comes with it.     Very good acting from all the actors and actresses that gave believeable performances weekly, and especially to Keifer Sutherland. A great body of work he did in making the Jack Bauer character so true to life, and to be so fierce with the ability to do so week after week. He was so creative and brilliant in that role and what a wonderful character for him to perform.  Hopefully, there will be a 24 movie soon with Mr Sutherland.    Also, splendid work from the entire crew that produced the filming, locations, special effects, the directors and writers, the photography, etc.  Week after week, their hard work always produced good shows for the 24 fans.     Having the entire collection of 24, and after the eighth season, I joined some friends and we had a great time reviewing and discussing past episodes.     Amazon, I could go on and on about 24, so, thank you so much for givng me the opportunity to discuss my personal review.  There will never be another series like it!!.
B0050LJIRK|5.0|Suprisingly this album is really good. They kept their 90's sound also. A lot of great guitar, just really solid. I know a lot of people are going to hate this, so I gave it five stars to off set their hate. Limp Bizkit is and always has been an aquired taste.
B000UJ48SQ|1.0|Barry Lyndon does indeed have some visual appeal, but this hardly makes up for the excruciatingly slow pace and a lead character who seems curiously disconnected from well, everything.  This is movie isn't even worth renting, much less buying.
B002WA4O8K|4.0|I've read a few of the 1 and 2 star reviews for this book and agree with much of what's been said in them.  Yes, much of what Deepak Chopra and many others like him do is repackage (mostly) Buddhism and small amounts of Christianity and/or other religions (sometimes even Native/Indigenous faiths) into lighter versions of the originals.  Yes, Deepak Chopra and many like him get rich off of repackaging these faiths (lol).  Yes, if you're already well steeped in a few (or all) of these faiths then you may feel like you're being duped when you purchase his and others' products/books.  However, these new 'religous-lite' takes on faith serve a purpose for those who either were never given much guidance or wisdom from their parents or guardians (in some cases kids were given nothing and I've met some of these folks in adulthood... it's not a pretty picture!)  AND for those who simply get caught up into Western life's chaos and need a reminder every now and then.  The book is like a stepping stone to a better understanding of the self.  It may not allow the reader to fully digest everything like a lifetime of practicing Buddhism might or allow for a slow unfolding of various concepts like a flower, but it helps to calm a nervous mind in a frenetic and chaotic culture and at least gives some time tested wisdom in easy to understand terms to those who need the guidance!<br /><br />As for the way the book was written?  Redundant and the editing could have been better - lol.  Still, I like it and would recommend it.  In my opinion, it couldn't do any harm except to those who feel like they don't want to pay $7.99 for something they already know.  ;)
B003V1WTMM|3.0|I was disappointed in Distant Hours. I loved The Forgotten Garden, but this novel was too reminiscent of The Hose at Riverton - long lost secret, family dynamics, which sister did what. The plot needed to be pruned, and by the time I finally got to the significance of the Mud Man, I forgot what I had read in the first chapter. Sometimes less IS more.
0307716511|5.0|I didn't expect much from this book, as I find a lot of murder mysteries to be far-fetched and only on the surface. \\"Sister\\" was different. Not only was the plot interesting, suspenseful and action-packed, but the format of the writing was moving and very touching. Often subplots don't work very well, but the connection between these two sisters was an excellent addition. I felt that I really got to know both of them in a deeper way often abandoned by authors. I read the whole thing in a day and a half. Without giving much away, the ending is the perfect amount of shocking without being insane. I would definitely recommend this book.
B004L79VUI|5.0|If you are a fan of Robbie Robertson, you will love this CD. I love the way he tells some of his life's stories in the songs on this CD. The songs on this CD remind me of the songs on his CD entitled, Robbie Robertson, released in 1990.
1594744769|2.0|Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is the literary equivalent of a blind date that looks amazing walking towards you at the restaurant, but 10 minutes in you know there's nothing going on upstairs. The story holds promise but ultimately never delivers, telling a poorly-paced story full of plot-holes. Disbelief must be suspended to its breaking point, not because of the nature of the Peculiar Children, but because of every character's nonsensical behavior.     If you're interested in the book, pick it up at your local bookstore, look at each of the photos involved, savor the lux paper, and enjoy the overall great design of the book. Then put it back down, as you've gained as much enjoyment from it as you're going to.
B003F3NDOE|4.0|It is so sad that this show is over! I have been an avid watcher since the show began, and really enjoyed the show's important message: love yourself for who you are, not how you look. I enjoyed the character's transformation from shy insecure teenager to a more confident, self-assured, young adult. If you are new to the show, this season is the best one in my opinion.
B004EPYZUI|4.0|This movie, at least at its top level, is not about femininity, female empowerment, or exploiting sexuality (or cynical pretenses of those things).  It's about oppression and injustice in the abstract.  The brothel is just as much a fantasy/allegory as the \\"video game\\" setpieces.  If the plot is seen as fighting injustice rather than a quest for freedom, the end pays off beautifully, especially if one tracks the talismans with the five stages of grief.    The action is not \\"next gen\\".  Aside from a beautiful long continuous shot through robots, it's excellent but normal action filmmaking, with some annoying cliches thrown in.  This likely isn't a \\"wow\\" movie that'll catapult itself into your top five.  But for me at least, it was a thought-provoker that demanded more than two viewings and made me glad to buy it.  Opposite nearly every critics' review, it's all about the substantive story, not the action.    I wasn't as impressed as others with the \\"maximum movie mode\\" extra.  A lively audio commentary conveys more information than these sparse interviews with simple green screen footage.    The bottom line for me, though, is that in today's climate any movie that even makes an effort to be different should get an automatic three stars.  Then it's uphill from there.
B004WJRJUE|5.0|This CD\DVD finally captures the raw power, skill, talent and driving force that makes Twisted Sister one of the all time greatest Heavy Metal bands. The remastered CD is amazing, the sound and production are top notch.  The songs bring you back to the origin of the band.  The DVD concert shows what a powerful band TS was, and they still are.  There is never a bad Twisted show.  The interviews with all members of the band are funny, smart and give you an insight into what was going on during the making of the orginal album and the performance on the DVD.  The CD\DVD are worth the price and more to anyone who is a TS fan, heavy metal fan, or rock music fan.  Everyone who loves music and great performances should have this in their collection.

B0045EJY90|4.0|EXCELLENT CD SOUND QUALITY    The sound is crystal clear.  Much more than what I'm used to from my other cd player, a Sony Shelf stereo.    REMOTE CONTROL NEEDS IMPROVEMENT    The remote could (and probably should) have bigger buttons and it should be easier to use.  (The buttons are too small and too close together.)    DISAPPOINTMENT :: THE RECORD FROM CD TO USB FEATURE DOESN'T SEEM TO INCLUDE THE SONG TITLES ! ! !    I figured I'd use the CD-P650 to record all my favorite CD's onto a USB memory stick.  I got the 1st cd recorded effortlessly, but alas I saw no titles of the songs or the artist's name.  I've tried several cds, some very new and the song titles don't seem to get saved to the USB drive.  So I've resolved to using my computer to rip my cd's onto the USB drive for now, since the computer is able to get the song titles and artist names so long as I'm connected to the Internet.    Perhaps a newer version of the CD-P650 will include an RJ45 jack to hook up to the Internet so song titles and artist names are successfully saved along with the music files to the USB drive?    NAVIGATING BETWEEN FOLDERS ON THE USB DRIVE IS POSSIBLE, BUT A LITTLE AWKWARD    Next, when you have several cd's ripped to the USB drive to get to the next folder, you push the folder down button until you see the folder you want to play from.  When I see the songs I'm interested in, I then hit the enter button twice, once to select the folder and once to begin playing the 1st song in that folder.    NO FIRMWARE UPGRADES AVAILABLE?    Finally, I think TEAC should make firmware upgrades possible for this and other units, especially since it has the capability of reading from the USB memory.  (I get the impression this is not possible.)    I've tried looking for other products that might serve me better, however there doesn't seem to be much else on the market to compare it with.
B004ZGM76A|5.0|Ok, Ok.  I get it.  This film is absurd.  The producers, writers etc went whole hog on visual effects and such and were light on story.  We get it.  Films of this type have to be taken for what they are worth, if you saw the trailer and other films by this director and team, you know pretty much what to expect.  Since this film was all about style and not substance one must judge it on those mertis or lack therof.  It looked and sounded fantastic.  I agree with those who point out, rightfully so, that the line between the dream world and the real world is, at best, blurry.  I agree.  Also this film suffered from the \\"Lovely Bones\\" issue of rating.  The target ticket buyers can't go to an R rated film.  The subject matter is R rated, what to do?  Make a confusing, yet visually stunning picture and hope no one notices, then release \\"Extended\\" version later to home video market.  I know, I know, I don't like it either, but with the cost of making a film, this happens.  I love Emily Browning, she doesn't really have to say anything, I have often wondered if she was a real person or if she only exists on film or in some digital never never land, she is fantastic in this bizaar, missunderstood oddity of a film.  BTW if you need a blu ray player check wallmart or AMazon, you can get one super cheap.  They are worth it.  LJB
B004FECNIO|2.0|I purchased the blu ray version with great anticipation as A.I. Is one of my all time favorite films and is noted for being  quite visually spectacular.  Watching on a 1080 back lit led tv and blu Ray player, I was confused at times ..as it seemed that it might not even be a blu Ray transfer....very grainy, lacking the definition, color clarity, intensity and depth that a good transfer should possess.    Also Amazon the reviews posted here Do not pertain to the blu Ray version and that is very misleading!

0062017926|5.0|How is it this is the only title by author James Rollins I've read? And why did I read the one right in the middle of the series? Luckily, it was so good, I can  enjoy reading this one again as I go through the entire series.<br /><br />The Judas Strain is as an odd book. The plot is simple, but complex. The characters are over-the-top, but believable. The text is intelligent, but easy-reading. Full on entertainment in its most pleasant form. I can't wait to read it again. But to you, I recommend reading them in order. That's always best.
1439102724|3.0|I used to love Jodi Picoult novels, so when did she become so trite and formulaic? The characters at the center of the novel are average and stereotypical, and the plot is pretty predictable. While the book was a quick read, much of it felt like something I'd read before. I hate to say it, but the last few JP books I've read haven't been the challenging, edge-of your seat stories that I've come to expect from her. While I was glad it wasn't as depressing as some of her other novels, it also wasn't as surprising or unexpected or twisty as I had hoped. It's a breeze for sure, but maybe because it's so simplistic.
B001DDBCUU|5.0|As someone who watched the series and still watches the reruns, this movie sums up the series beautifully. All the characters are the same sexy, feisty and hilarious girls we've all come to know. Only this time our beloved Carrie is getting married to Mr. Big. But as with all SATC episodes it's full of drama, sex and humor. I enjoyed this movie immensely. It makes you laugh, makes you cry and gives you the overwhelming feeling of love. It was a perfect compliment to the series.

Not quite the same as previous Pitbull albums, if you like a fairly mainstream beat and are a Pitbull fan, you'll probably like this.  If you're looking for more hip-hop and something edgier, you'll probably hate it.      How much wood could a woodchuck chuck?

When you don't have it in your hands, you don't realize how much you want to keep reading. But then when you ARE reading and have to stop, you don't just put a bookmark in and put the book down, you painfully tear the book away from yourself.

That's saying a lot from an Ole Skool Music lover.<br /><br />Much Respect,<br />To the artist on this CD, who gave us a small glimpse back in time.
B0034G4P8U|5.0|Easily the best film in the series. Tranformers: Dark of the Moom is the summer event film I have been waiting for. Perhaps the biggest surprise here is that the girl replacing Megan Fox is a much better actress. The action and set pieces, including an amazing chase scene on a freeway are incredible. The last hour set in a war-torn Chicago are some of the greatest sequences ever put to film. Shia does a terrific job being both witty and funny, but also very emotional when the time comes. Unlike the first two Transformer movies, this time it truly feels like something is at stake. While I loved the first two for what they were, this one has a more authentic story and tighter narrative. Finally a 3D movie with actually depth in the shots! Your jaw will definitely drop in certain scenes.
0446563048|4.0|This book is a history of Zappos and a biography of Tony Shea. You will learn some good non-traditional methods to build a great business culture. The book covers how Tony Shea achieved his first major business success by developing and selling the company Link Exchange. This provided him with funds and skills that would be essential to help the original founder of Zappos Tony Hsieh into company with intense customer and employee loyalty. After reading this book, I took a tour of Zappos (anyone can go on the tours - highly recommended) which proved that the company is extremely different than other companies.   One of the memorable stories in this book is how Tony Hsieh got the attention of Tony Shea for business funding. At the end of a not so good voice mail message, he mentioned that the catalog business was a multi-billion dollar industry. This one statement caused Tony Shea to followup eventually leading to the starting of Zappos. If you are looking for funding, have important (and shocking) credible industry information to justify business investment. If you are starting or running a business, this book will give you some great strategies and tactics along with some good motivating stories.
B004WQ2L9G|4.0|Part of Liszt's Tribute in the Bicentennial Year<br /><br />This Liszt bicentennial year 2011 has been well represented with the release of at least three mega box sets so far:  The first one early on in 2011 was the release of the Leslie Howard ninety nine disc megalith of all known piano music.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B004G7FFF8 Liszt: The Complete Piano Music]]<br /><br />The second one was the Brilliant Liszt Portrait, which many classical music fans here scarfed up  when Amazon erroneously (according to Amazon, at least) and mistakenly under priced it together with a half dozen other Brilliant Classics releases.  This box set is more of a hastily thrown together pastiche, more of a deeper than superficial incursion into the Liszt oeurve rather than a genuine attempt at completion.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B004MRX8HE Liszt Portrait]]<br /><br />Now, DG (Polygram, Universal Classics, London, Decca, Philips, et. al.) has released their tribute, this thirty four disc set, to the composer.<br /><br />Physically, the box is enclosed in a cardboard cube with cardboard (not cheap white paper) sleeves.  The box physically, fiscally, and superficially resembles its Siamese twins, so to speak: The earlier Robert Schumann Masterworks set, [[ASIN:B00386FG0M Schumann: The Masterworks]], released a little over a year ago, and the Brahms Complete Edition, [[ASIN:B001TH28EO Brahms Complete Edition]],released in 2009.  Each one has the distinction of being priced at a little under one hundred dollars.  Disappointingly, unlike, those two more generous predecessors, there are a substantial number of discs here in the set which clock in at under an hour, which is inconsiderate, bordering on being almost inexcusable and unforgivable in this day and age.<br /><br />The sound of the discs is good to excellent.<br /><br />There are several sides to Liszt's complicated artistic genius which are represented with this box set.  The Howard/Hyperion set touches but two facets of that personality in its enormous contribution to the tribute.  Within that genius, there is Liszt, the orchestral composer-which is depicted with the Faust and Dante symphonies and the tone poems (from several artists here, and not relying solely upon Haitink);  there is Liszt the virtuoso pianist-which is depicted with the three Ann&eacute;es de p&egrave;lerinage (thankfully with Lazar Berman), the Piano Concertos and the Hungarian Rhapsodies; there is Liszt, the chamber musician-seen with the several albums of Lieder (Barenboim and Fischer-Dieskau).  Then there is the spiritual side of  Liszt, and/or Liszt, the cleric, with the inclusion of Die Legende von der Heiligen Elisabeth, Missa Choralis, Hungarian Coronation Mass, Graner Messe, Via Crucis, L&eacute;gendes de Saint Francois, Cantique au soleil, and L&eacute;gendes de Saint Francois.  His neglected oratorio Christus is neglected here, too, and it is not included.  Here, an insatiable collector has to supplement elsewhere with perhaps Rilling on Hanssler.[[ASIN:B00000655L Liszt: Christus]]<br /><br />Another item of some disappointment here in this set is the absence of Liszt's Beethoven Symphony transcriptions, considering that DG undertook inclusion of a considerable number of Liszt's keyboard transcriptions at all.  The collector will have to look elsewhere and supplement his collection accordingly with either the Howard Hyperion megalith or he might consider the very fine Naxos set.  [[ASIN:B000IY062K Beethoven Symphonies Nos. 1-9 Transcribed by Liszt [Box Set]]]<br /><br />Included works are as follows: (from the DG website)<br /><br />CD 1: Liszt: Piano Concertos Nos.1 & 2; Totentanz<br />Piano Concerto No.1 in E flat, S.124<br />1. 1.

B00027JYLC|4.0|It's an interesting look at people who are different than us, an interesting story, but what was the reality within their community?
0062060554|2.0|I know I'm in a perilously small minority in panning this book, but ...    I'm perfectly willing to submit to a writer's request to suspend reality if it makes sense to do so in the context of the work -- say, when reading Tolkien or Poe or Vonnegut, or Marvel Comics for that matter.    But this novel requires the reader to suspend all sense of reality in a situation that supposedly is rooted in reality.  And that just doesn't work.    The idea that the protagonist, day after day, wakes up in a strange bed with a strange man, not knowing who she is, and, day after day, is resigned to the situation in an hour or two, and responding with minimal sense of fear, panic and confusion, is simply unsupportable.  It defies most standards of human behavior and emotion.     We're to believe that, in this situation, she agrees to dash off to meet with strangers who call her on the telephone?  That she can write page after page of seamless prose in her diary in mere minutes, while huddled on her knees at a bedroom closet door, pencil in hand?  Please. There are scores of other contradictions and illogic, but space precludes addressing them all.    I allowed a second star out of mercy, recognizing that the author had at least created a compelling (if not exactly original) scenario, no matter how poorly it was executed.
B001HOF8AA|5.0|Wild about Imelda May's rockabilly/punk sound! This is an excellent album; I can't wait for Mayhem to make it to the states. Imelda May herself is fantastic, and her band is fun and obviously talented. I've started looking them up individually to see what else is out there with these artists.
B004BBDHEK|3.0|I have just about all his albums and videos, so I guess you could call me a real fan.  I was excited to see what \\"new\\" creations he had come up with, after spending two years in his recording studio.    What a let down, to hear all this album contains, is either something that's already been done, or a rehash of it.  And very little of it is very exciting, or different, from what he's done in the past.    What a disappointment. What a letdown.  It's not trash, it's just boring old stuff that he's done before.    He can do better...a lot better.  But doing better means working really hard, not, to just duplicate what you've already done.    Maybe he should go back to long hair...at least then, he was creating magic people really wanted to hear.  This recording is one you could pass up on, and not feel as though you missed out experiencing something great.
B0057AOOZ0|3.0|I've heard such negativity towards the \\"run the world \\" song I didn't expect much from \\"4\\"..  I liked \\" I'd rather die young\\", \\"Love on top\\", and \\"Countdown\\"....  I like her slow jams much more than the fast songs... Which is unusual for a Beyonce' album...

0670022411|1.0|So I finally finished this book - 579 pages that could have been cut down to about 200.  Maybe it is because I am male, but where was the action in this book.  Also, tell me up-front that this book goes nowhere and I will have to buy the sequel.  I feel like I have wasted my time.  Some other quick observations:<br /><br />- Did I mention that this book should have been edited down?<br />- So Diana may be the most powerful witch ever, but she never used her magic growing up?<br />- Her home in Madison is bewitched?<br />- Is it me or does Matthew the vampire not sound like someone you would risk your life over, especially if you are the most powerful witch ever.<br />- If Matthew is so powerful, how did Juliet almost kill him and he put up virtually no fight?<br />- Why did Diana not become a vampire<br />- How could Diana go rowing early in the morning knowing all these creatures were watching her.<br />- The book was closed for many years and she just happens to open without knowing how?<br /><br />I could go on and on - very frustrated with this story, that I barely finished and had nothing happen at the end.
B00005JLR2|5.0|This movie is without reservation the most underrated Disney flick ever released. It is pure gold from the story to the visuals to the characters. I can't understand how anyone could dismiss this movie as anything but a masterpiece.
1402726899|2.0|(This is Matthew's wife, by the way!) This book has a lot of modifications but like another reviewer said, it shows the models with a lot of specialized equipment that I just don't have. Also, the modifications to the some of the poses aren't that much better than the original pose.  I disagree with a lot of the poses they claim are safe during the different parts of pregnancy, such as twists, inversions and lying on your back. Overall, I feel like this book is not meant for those looking for a safe, more gentle approach to flexibility and peace during their pregnancy.
B0050CQY1W|3.0|First, I will say I am a big Beyonce fan and I have a tremendous amount of respect for her as an artist, vocalist, person and role model. Although I hoped for more in this album, I still think the same of her.    I pre-ordered this album, hoping for a combo of up-beat songs like \\"Run the World\\" and powerful ballads like \\"Best Thing I Never Had.\\" What I have loved about Beyonce's music is that she is always sassy and powerful in her music. But other than those two tracks mentioned, the others leave me wanting more. I want more sass!    Her vocals are still great and she shows a vulnerable side here, which I respect. But overall, I find many of the songs forgettable. Most of the songs are slow, which is fine if that's what you want from the album.     This album just leaves me wanting more from Beyonce. If I would have listened to samples of this album, I probably would have just downloaded the two singles I like.
1586210661|4.0|Okay, so I like crazy. David Sedaris always provides a good amount of entertainment with his tales. His perspective is funny, and I think his family really helped create his zest for humor. The stories about them are great. I love almost everything he writes.
0307595862|5.0|I am an aficionado of Scandinavian crime fiction and had read two of Jo Nesbo's earlier Harry Hole books, The Redbreast and The Devil's Star. While I recognized that they were well-written, they were sufficiently gruesome to largely turn me off. I'm not sure why I found The Snowman more palatable in that department, as it's certainly as violent, but at the same time, the characters seemed more human, three-dimensional and appealing, which counterbalanced it to some extent. It's as if Nesbo, who's clearly a very talented writer, has finally hit his stride.<br /><br />In The Snowman, we once again find flawed detective Harry Hole on the trail of a serial killer, this time one who targets married women with children. With a new partner, Hole follows lead after lead, some extending many years in the past, but far too many are surfacing in the present, as the killer ramps up his spree. At the same time Harry is contending with police politics, the media circus and the pain of his lost love, Rakel. There are breakthroughs that prove to be dead ends, but in Nesbo's hands, each advances the plot--it's just not always clear how until later in the book. Numerous subplots add dimension, and Nesbo weaves them together artfully.<br /><br />Certainly the flawed but brilliant detective who's alcoholic, mourning a lost love and alienated from his colleagues has become almost an archetype in Scandinavian crime novels (Wallander, Erlendur, e.g.), but Nesbo imbues Harry with enough complexity that I didn't feel, as I have with some, that he was a cookie cutter character traversing the same turf that many others have before.<br /><br />I will say that I guessed who the killer was fairly early on, which is usually not the case with most Scandinavian mysteries, but there were so many twists in the plot and so many plausible suspects in Harry's crosshairs that it in no way detracted from my enjoyment of the book, as it was only at the end that I realized I had been right.<br /><br />As with other Nesbo books, The Snowman required a fairly strong stomach, but this time, I couldn't put it down.nowman required a fairly strong stomach, but this time, I couldn't put it down.
031603441X|3.0|I bought this book on a lark. I grew up in the 60's and 70's so I always listened to their music on the radio and know a bunch of their songs. I never really thought about the members of the Stones. I liked the history and stories, but the specific talk about chords and such didn't do much for me. I think a musician would enjoy those parts more. The tales of how they began, the drug stories, the loves, the personality of Keith Richards all were entertaining. I did know who a fair amount of the musicians in the blues and some other genres were so that was cool to read about. After reading this I think Keith Richards is very passionate about music and life.
B004EPYZU8|1.0|I saw Sucker Punch on opening night in the theaters. As well, I bought the DVD yesterday. However, I feel very much like a second class citizen since the extended cut of the film was only available on BluRay!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That's complete (R@P. I could complain extensively about this but, obviously, those responsible DON'T CARE WHAT I THINK. Which is what has created this prejudice manifesting in real-world terms of the product disparity. I was even going to buy the BluRay combo pack just to get the extended cut of the film until I read on the back of the box that the extended cut in the combo pack was only on the BluRay disc.

0061885452|5.0|I've enjoyed watching Craig Ferguson's career progress from the Drew Carey Show to the Late Late Show, but I had no idea how much physical violence and persecution he had to endure growing up in Glasgow. It's amazing how he has transcended both a rough childhood and a decades-long battle with drugs and alcohol to finally find success in a job he never even knew he wanted. This book is true inspiration to anyone struggling to achieve a dream, or to those who are on the verge of giving up. Craig has been there, done that, and against overwhelming odds, found happiness and success on his own terms. I've read other biographies that were obviously written by ghostwriters, but this is unquestionably a self-written tome, and no punches have been pulled - at least not where its protagonist is concerned. Ferguson has kindly declined to name anyone who might be adversely affected by exposure (unless, of course, they deserved it), and in so doing has earned an extra measure of my respect. His story is by turns mesmerizing, disturbing, inspiring and hilarious. Read it and weep/laugh/shudder. Not necessarily in that order.
1597801585|3.0|There is no doubt that the Windup Girl is beautifully written. I wanted to like this book but the dystopian feel and the constant sexual abuse of Emiko, the lead Windup, made me cringe on several occasions and not want to keep going. Reading The Windup Girl is like slowly watching a balloon get blown up and then explode. Pacigalupi does a great job pacing the novel, making each step lead up to the next. You also get a variety of perspectives, which makes the story more interesting. But in the end, you are left feeling quite miserable for all the characters in the book. I suppose I like to read to stretch my imagination and get excited by the possibilities fantasy and science fiction have to offer. The Windup Girl did not excite me, it actually did the opposite. When I finished the book, I felt somewhat morose feeling like I witnessed something more like a car crash and didn't want to keep the memory of it. Perhaps this is testament that it is a really compelling story? It's worth reading if you are into the dystopian sci-fi thing. If you're like me and are more faint of heart, then you probably won't enjoy it.

B000FC2PKG|4.0|This book starts with action right away... which I enjoy.  I was getting frustrated (in a good way) with trying to tie it all together the who what and why's before the author gave them to you.  It wasn't so easy which is what makes this a good murder mystery action book, not easily guessed.  I think it's strange this is considered a Detective DD Warren novel when she played such a small role in the book.  But I look forward to reading more of her and from Lisa Gardner.<br /><br />PS was a steal on Kindle for .99 (way back when I purchased it)  sad news means I will spend more cause it was good writing. :)
031261246X|4.0|\\"Zero Day\\" is well done:  good structure, good characters (that is, lots of gray), a fine sense of pacing.  It was both enjoyable and provacative. (\\"Ripped from today's headlines,\\" as they used to say.)  And, of course, considering the author there was no technical hyperbole, no magic ju-ju, no computer-babble that doesn't really make sense.  Russinovich's bona fides in the tech world guarantee accurate representation.  And that makes his writing chops that much more impressive.    Take it to the beach, read it on a plane.  It will keep your attention, engage your mind (but not overly) and entertain you.
B001G8XON0|4.0|Baz Luhrmann is obviously a very talented visual director.  This movie is eye-candy deluxe.  The songs, and singing are good throughout.

B0057AOOZ0|5.0|I really wasn't expecting much since I'd heard the first single from this CD.  But whoa! was I mistaken & surprised. So glad Bey didn't diappoint.      The music quality is really nice, on every song.  The lyric are good too. I love the fact that she is really doing some great singing (with a lot of ballads)on this album.  Her vocals soars on \\"4\\"!! IMPRESSED... My FAVR hits consist of: \\"1+1,\\" \\"I Care,\\" \\"I Miss You\\" \\"Best Thing I Never Had,\\" \\"Party,\\" (which I luv!!), \\"Love on Top (I luv, luv, luv),\\" \\"Countdown\\" \\"End of Time.\\" Every song broadcasts her on-point vocal capabilities, whether u like her,the song or not! Undeniable talent this girl has.     Well... 2 my surprise, the album turns out to be VERY good & should do GREAT!!! And although fast-paced songs are very challenging & NOT easily pulled off, she's known for singing these wordy type songs so effortlessly and with such clarity, just shows her vocal prowess. Her ballads are mastered just as effortlessly and heartfelt, too.      So, with that being said, You gotta give the girl her \\"props\\" on this one. Buy it, take an unbiased listen, you gon' be surprised, I'm telling U!!!                  [[ASIN:B0050CQY1W 4]]
B0051QIGP4|3.0|I would like to give this CD a proper review, but I bought it when it was first released as a special .99 cent download.  Because Amazon was overwhelmed with people downloading the CD at the special price it did not download correctly and I only received 4 songs.  They later sent out an email to everyone who purchased stating how to re-download the album if you didn't receive it all the first time, and the second attempt failed as well, even though I followed the instructions precisely.  The four songs I received were basic catchy pop songs, a la early Madonna.  I think Lady GaGa is talented and would have liked to hear the entire CD, but will have to purchase the physical CD to do so.
B0050CQY1W|5.0|Like many other, I am a very big Beyonce fan, and I've always felt that \\"Dangerously in Love\\" was her best CD.  This is not to say that I didn't like \\"B-Day\\" or \\"I Am... Sasha Fierce\\"; I actually love both of them!  This latest CD, 4, is by far the best one. She gives you R&B track after R&B track, mixed with different genres!  She gives you break-up tracks, hopeful tracks, die-hard in love tracks, summer tracks, etc etc etc! Lets go through...<br /><br />1. 1+1... I loved this song from the moment I heard it on American Idol. Such a POWERFUL song, and so powerfully sung.<br /><br />2. I Care... Love this song as well. Another catchy love song that's beautifully written and easy to sing-a-long to.<br /><br />3. I Miss You... VERY simple song yet powerful.  Now I realize (after having the CD in my hand) why I like it so much... it was co-written by Frank Ocean! POW!<br /><br />4. Best Thing I Never Had... such a \\"I'm an international icon\\" song.  Remind me of an anthem that would be sung by Cher or Mrs Dion.  I get chills everytime she says \\"you showed yo ass and I.. I saw the real you!\\" WOW! Say it Bey!<br /><br />5. Party (feat. Andre 3000)... definitely the song of the summer. Enough said.<br /><br />6. Rather Die Young... My favorite track on the entire album, and the beginning to the greatest section of the CD in my opinion (tracks 6-10).  This is when I realized that Bey is singing on this CD like she has something to PROVE!<br /><br />7. Start Over... another powerful track. Probably my second favorite track on the CD. The lyrics just capture me everytime...<br /><br />8.Love On Top... I don't know why, but EVERYTIME i listen to this, it reminds me of an old Jackson 5 song. That means, OF COURSE ITS A GREAT SONG! Love it!<br /><br />9. Countdown... such a creative song! Reminds me of a kind of R&B/pop remix of Fantasia \\"Only One You\\"<br /><br />10.End Of Time... Obviously, after it leaked on the internet, people fell in love with it, and so did I! Great track! Her performance of it on the BET Awards made me love it even more.<br /><br />11. I Was Here... powerful track. speaks on leaving your mark on this earth, even far past the time you leave it.<br /><br />12. Run the World (Girls)... I'm a dude, and I actually like this song.  You have to admit, its really catchy!  I especially started liking it when she started performing it! The Billboard Awards performance was SIIIIICK!<br /><br />Overall, spectacular album! GET IT!Here... powerful track. speaks on leaving your mark on this earth, even far past the time you leave it.    12. Run the World (Girls)... I'm a dude, and I actually like this song.

B001EN71CW|5.0|I didn't know about this series when it was on TV.  I learned about it later from a friend who had the series on DVD.  I borrowed his DVDs and watched the entire series and became a fan after the very first episode.  The characters, script, and look is very sharp.  I wish the series had stayed on longer as science fiction TV series of this caliber are rare.  I bought the blu-ray and it is a worthy upgrade from the DVDs.  Highly recommended.

B004G6009U|5.0|I was reluctant to see Tangled in the Theaters when it came out because it followed the disappointing \\"Princess and the Frog\\" which was mediocre, plus a film about Rapunzel sounded dull.  I love animation so decided to go anyway and was not prepared for what turned out to be one of the best movies Disney has ever done.  Everything about this film is a huge improvement over the dull \\"Frog\\" movie.  The music is great, the script is sharp and funny, and the animation is superb.  The animation when they light the lanterns while in the boat is as good as animation gets - jaw droppingly beautiful.  Highly recommended and get it in blu-ray, it looks fantastic!
B000003TAR|5.0|nevermind was a perfect rock album, in utero goes beyond .  A much more raw and harsh sound than nevermind makes this one the best nirvana album. each song has its own unique sound and rhythm. its beautiful. cant describe in utero in many words, you simply have to experience it yourself.          nirvana rulz
B002HK9I04|5.0|What can I say in a review of this film - you're either a fan of Southpark or you're not.  I think it's one of the best shows ever put on television.  Amazingly consistant, sharp and relevant.  If you don't like hearing cuss words, you will not like this film as every cuss word you can think of is said, and said repeatedly.  Trey Parker and Matt Stone like to poke fun of everyone and everything.  Religion, celebrities, countries, etc.  If you offend easily stay away.  The music is surprisingly catchy and they sound like good Broadway tunes.  The film is definitely worth the upgrade to blu-ray.  Trey and Matt like to poke fun of their \\"crude\\" animation style, but don't let them fool you.  Some of the animation is superb, particularily Kenny's dream sequence and the scenes from hell.  Great film.  I hope they make more movies.
B000003TA4|5.0|This album is nothing but pure pop-rock fun. Every song on this album is catchy and memorable, the song writing is what stands out on this album because it is so unique. I hate when people call nirvana and other early 90s rock bands(pearl jam and soundgarden for example) grunge bands, just call it ROCK. This album is brilliant, Kurt Cobain was bad as hell! krist noveslicis a pretty damn good bass player, and dave ghroul is amazing at the drums.    Best Tracks on the album(no not teen spirit) in my opinion.  lounge act  come as you are  drain you. are top 3 but every tract on this album is great!!!!!!!!      nirvana kicks ass, 80s hair metal is horrible.
B003UESJFG|4.0|The trailer for this movie made it look like something I wanted to avoid, even though I love animation.  It was recently offered on blu-ray at a discounted price, and the reviews on Amazon have been good, so I thought I would give it a try.  I'm glad I purchased it as it was better than expected.  It is not on a level of Pixar or Disney at it's best, but it has good animation and humor plus good voice characterizations.  Not great but above average.
B0000035E7|4.0|This album would probably only be REALLY appreciated  by all the die hard nirvana fans. This albums got some heavy-baddass-raw-garage band sound to it. its no nevermind or in utero but is still a impressive debut album(it was only recorded for 600$!). if you are(or claim to be) a die hard nirvana fan then this album better be in your CD collection(or ipod....sorry i forgot that CD's are becoming a dead technology, isnt that a downer?)
B004ZZITEU|4.0|This album suffered with a number of bad songs for example: \\"Too Extreme!\\" sounded like The Deathstars with a crappy dance beat and david vincent even speaks spanish in the lyrics. \\"Destructos vs. the Earth\\" wouldn't be that bad if that dance beat wasn't in it and the girl in the background saying destructos randomly, ruins the song even more. \\"Radicult\\" what were they thinking? It sounds childish, I thought they were a veteran metal band. \\"I Am Morbid\\" was horrible; God of emptiness showed us who's morbid. Every other song on this album is good other than those four I explained above. \\"Profundis-Mea Culpa\\" kinda reminds me of Hatework from domination although they both sound different the elements are the same and it's a good song. \\"10 More Dead\\" is my favorite from the new album IDI. The guitar riffs are good, drums are typical morbid angel. Vincent does good vocally. If your a long time fan of MA like me than you should still buy it.
0451169514|5.0|(Yes i know the title of my review is debatable)  Stephan Kings IT is by far one of the most bizarre and completely original novels i have encountered. The story is about 7 friends in the summer of 1958 in the fictional town of derry maine, where they all encounter a evil entity that can take shape of there deepest darkest fears( it mainly pops up as a clown called \\"pennywise\\"). after believing that the 7 of them have killed \\"IT\\" they all make a promise to come back if IT ever returns...and that's exactly what happens 27(or maybe it was 28)years later. The fact that this story came from one mans mind is mind boggling because there so many themes being delt with in this book. PLEASE! don't let the 1000+ pages turn you away from this book(there is no need to rush through a long read now). Is the book necessarily the scariest S.K book? maybe....idk.... i have only read one other(misery), but however the book is very disturbing, gruesome,and intense. this is perhaps the best book i have ever read.  Oh yeah and another thing............dont bother seeing the 1990 TV mini series it is not very faithful to book.(and apparently it is being remade into a feature film)
0670022411|2.0|I'm not likin' this new trend.  While well-researched and believable, the characters were somewhat stereotypical, a lot of the information came via info-dump (and didn't pertain to the story).  My biggest complaint, however, is the vast and pointless size of the book.  600 pages for a story that could have been told in 200.  And then when you get to the end - to discover that it's totally NOT the end.  Very Twilight-esque.      I feel like I've been taken for a ride...
B000003TAB|4.0|on first listening to this album i thought it sounded pretty lame. But then this album soon started to grow on me and now i think incesticide kicks ass! Its got a nice garage band sound to it, its got some fun pop songs like son of a gun(a cover of the vasileins song), but then its got some heavy songs like downer. give this album a chance,after all these songs were performed before nirvana became the biggest band of the 90s. it is a worthy addition to your CD collection
1936594641|4.0|juxtapose this with darwinian theories. Also check out frankenstein - i thought it was better but jekyll is shorter if have time constraints
B000O77SRC|5.0|I've seen this movie dozens of times and will probably watch it dozens more, because I have my own copy . It arrived quickly - in Great condition - at a great price - and I opened it and watched it :} Thank You Amazon.
1433502380|5.0|I LOVE THIS STUDY BIBLE. This book has helped me IMMENSELY. It is the most important book I have. I highly recommend it to anyone who's seeking to become closer with God.    Sadly, my first bible had a lot of blurry pages. But Amazon graciously let me return it (they even shipped the replacement with one day shipping!)
B0000640VO|5.0|This film was recommended to me very highly so I went to Amazon, looked it up, found the right one for the right price and it quickly arrived at my door. Thanks Amazon.
1594202842|3.0|On page 176, the first page of chapter 25, Ms. Chua demonstrates her ignorance of  comparative pronoun usage. She states, \\"Maybe because she was seven years younger than me . . .\\" She should have said, \\"Maybe because she was seven years younger than I was . . .\\"    I find it amusing that someone who demands academic perfection from her daughters, doesn't demand it of herself.     This book has been adequately reviewed by others and so to add anything else to my review would be repetitive.
B004A8ZX2S|5.0|Tree of Life was everything I needed it to be.     In terms of aesthetics, it was certainly a flawed film - the evolution sequence could have been edited down, certain lines of the script could be construed as cliche or pretentious - however, I think this film will be seen as one of the great masterpieces of our time.     In the opening section of Andrei Tarkovsky's book, SCULPTING IN TIME, he discusses the audience reaction of his fellow Russians to his serpentine, narrative-less film, Mirror.  Although many were confounded, he mentions that a significant number of people had sent him letters thanking him for making the film, and that they required no logical explanation about the events in the film for, as they told him, they \\"had lived it.\\"  I believe that if we approach it with open minds and hearts, without any reservations about the unique language of Malick's storytelling, Tree of Life will have the same impact on 21st Century Americans that Tarkovsky's Mirror had on Russians in the 1970s.  In both the most cosmic and the most intimately personal ways possible, Tree of Life represents the unfolding of our very lives before our eyes.     It's no coincidence that Malick portrays the morose, disturbed Sean Penn character as a vaguely corrupt, high-profile corporate businessman with childhood roots (quite literally, given all the shots of foliage) in the late 50's and early 60's, America's most naive epoch.  He's allowing the intricate mysticism of his film to act as a catharsis and rebirth for contemporary viewers who feel that our condition amidst this world economic crisis is one which was doomed from the start; one doomed by the sins, failures, and greed of generations past, and that we're left with no power to prevent that history from penetrating and governing our will to forge ourselves a better future.       But he does so not only by way of a traditional storyline in which some of the main characters evolve through personal experience and reflection, butalso by tracing back our existence to the very beginnings of the earth (a la 2001: A Space Odyssey), as well as attempting a conjecture on where we might be headed.  Thus, the logic of the film demonstrates, as primordially as possible, that while no one moment in the history of time carries more value or meaning than another, they all add up to something more valuable and meaningful than any one of us could possibly imagine.  In this way, Tree of Life acknowledges and accepts the fundamental tenents of nihilism and postmodernism, all while turning them on their head and daring the audience to submit to some vague metaphysical CHANCE which may ultimately lead us to the very essence of value and meaning.     The fact that Terrence Malick has one of the most visually stunning directing styles of anyone in the history of cinema certainly aids us in our acceptance of the vast risks this film takes.  One of the most jarring shots in the film for me was the image of the mother carrying one of her sons away from a seizure victim writhing in the middle of the road, concerned about the developmental effect that witnessing such an event might have on her child.  We never learn who the seizure victim was, why he was in that state, or what significance he played in any of their lives, and the shot only lasts a few seconds in a long sequence of equally-paced shots - the event never returned to again.  We only know that this brief instant had enough bearing on the characters' lives to be shown in the film, and this is all we need to know to accept it and treat it no differently from any other moment.  In Malick's universe, where every branch in the \\"tree of life\\" is equally valuable or valueless, we learn that we must treat all of them as precious, striving to fill them with love, kindness, acceptance, forgiveness, and understanding, for all life forms and for all eras of our lives - past, present, and future.     If you allow yourself to accept the complexities of its style andthe jarring, seemingly contradictory elements of its story, you won't be bothered by what you may perceive as weaknesses in the script, the editing, the performances or perhaps even the directing - you will simply allow Tree of Life into the core of your being, and it may well turn out to be everything you need it to be.  It was for me.     Go see this film.
B0050CQY1W|5.0|This album is fantastic & has been playing on repeat since I got it today! She is a phenomenal artist & it completely shows through here. This album definitely has a more mature sound to it. It sounds like Beyonce finally being true to herself & what B wants, she made magic with this album.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I did not see Firefly when it debuted, but after seeing the series on the Science channel, I'm hooked.  Great writing and superb production (easily better than Galactica or some of the awful products on the SciFi channel) mark this as a collector's item.  Too bad Fox did not have the courage to follow through and keep production going.
0756665949|5.0|A marvelous book.  It is all we wanted and much, much more.  We are completely satisfied with the details and information on this book.  It has become our favorite coffee table book, and the only problem we, expect is that we will need to purchase a several copies because the children all want their own copy.  The book, the facts, the pictures, everything is so tastefully and so professionally done.  This has been the best family fun book we've ever purchases.  As a family, we highly recommend it, you will not be disappointed.  And what a perfect gift it will make also, for those who love Lost.  I would give it with a Lost DVD or the Lost Sound track.  I would love it, if I got that gift!
B002D0L0R2|5.0|I saw Hairspray on broadway in 2005. I saw it off-broadway this year. Of course, I am always singing the tunes because they are so catchy. I decided to look for the DVD on amazon, and of course I found a great deal! The DVD came and worked perfectly, and it was inexpensive. Love it!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Even if you dont think dogs should talk or be the narrator of novels....you will enjoy this book!  Great read, wonderful life lessons disguised as driving tips! And then, there IS the dog. Read this in one day, could not put it down.
B00006878K|5.0|This wonderful album was recorded with Booker T and the MG's as Albert King's band.  The songwriting is great, the arangements are tight and the music is awesome! One of the BEST blues albums of all time!
B0034G4P80|5.0|After I saw Iron Man 1 and 2 and, The Incredible Hulk I thought that they'd make The Avengers movie.... I wasn't expecting them to do the hardest one though. Doing the Nordic God of Thunder and bringing it to the big screen was fantastic. I can't wait for Captain America: The First Avenger and The Avengers movies.
B004JN1D2I|4.0|The Kindle Edition is great, the best part is I dont even have a Kindle.  I read it on my macbook pro 13\\", and my iPhone 3GS.  I never realized how convenient it is to start reading.  About the series all I can say is wow!  Great story.  I love the fact that I can take my whole library anywhere.  This story shows me that the author has done a lot of research about the medieval era.  I am getting the next book on Kindle.
B004EPZ07K|5.0|I'm a big fan of Green Lantern. Always thought he was a dynamic character and to finally see him on the big screen played by a great actor (Yes, Ryan Reynolds was a great Hal Jordan) was just amazing. A lot of people said it wasn't paced well? I thought it was paced fine. Personally, just my opinion, it's up there with Thor and The Dark Knight. I loved those movies and now I love this one.
B004856SQ8|4.0|I love that the A-Team movie doesn't shy away from the over-the-top goofy action that characterized the original A-Team.  Any plan, no matter how bizarre or improbable, would come together in the end.  Rather than try to make a \\"serious\\" A-Team movie, the producers went the Charlie's Angels way and owned the improbability.  As a result, this movie works, and it's fun.  I give the director and the writers a lot of credit - while the script doesn't necessarily make a lot of sense, and the plot gets confused at times, \\"A-Team\\" manages to juggle a lot of convoluted spy/heist stuff without getting the viewer lost as to what's going on.  The actors were good choices to play the classic characters, Liam Neeson in particular.  It was fun to see Gerald McRaney, the king of 80s TV, back on screen.<br /><br />Part of the comedy had to do with those printing plates dating from the 70s.  Oh no - unnamed bad guys were going to print a billion or two dollars of \\"unbacked US currency\\" with them!  Given that the Federal Reserve does that on a daily basis, the viewer may end up cheering for the monetary restraint of the eventual possessor of the plates and/or hoping he or she might replace Bernanke.  Plus, hasn't the $100 bill changed a little since 1975?<br /><br />The movie bogs down in places, and a movie like the \\"A-Team\\" can't afford that.  It needs to keep up the energy so you don't think about it too much.  At 2 hours, this movie could have easily shaved off about 20 minutes and been a lot more effective.<br /><br />This is at least worth a rent, especially if you liked the original show as a kid.  It's not high art, but it's entertaining.
B0050PYNP8|5.0|I can't really say much about this movie because it was so funny. A few friends of mine said it was \\"preachy\\"? I thought it was fine. But damn, LOTS OF HICKS! LOADS OF THEM SCREAMING DEMON! But still, 10/10 in comedy.
B00532A8JI|5.0|Like many others here, I am an unabashed Symphony X manic fan.   I have everything they've ever done, and have seen them many times.  I was though, very disappointed in Paradise Lost, and barely listened to it. There were some good tracks, but it was noisy, confused and lacked conviction in my opinion. It even made me slightly forget about the band for a couple of years.    Now comes Iconoclast, and I am sucked yet again, into Symphony X.    They've again captured the brilliance of what makes them so great.  Everything from virtuosic melodic and technical playing, to meticulous production, to just mind boggling writing and arranging.   These guys do things as a band that very few others can come close to.  They are the amongst the most integrated and together group of high performance players out there.  The writing is sweeping, huge, bombastic.  The playing is perfect.    Russell Allen has never sounded better, bigger, badder and stronger.  The musicianship is unparalleled, with the 3 Michaels and Jason never sounding better.  Just WOW!    If you like melodic, technical, symphonic and gigantic metal, this album is simply a must have for your collection.  It is a sonic treat for lovers of the genre
B000FBFN1U|4.0|I couldn't put this book down, but there were times when I wanted to throw it out the window. A great story, but every once in a while something horrible happens to a favorite character or a villain fails to get his just punishment.
B004EPYZUI|5.0|I won't review the movie in full. There are many other reviews here, good and bad.    However, if considering a purchase, I want to stress to be sure you order the combo pack, which includes the Extended Edition. (The theatrical and extended editions each come on separate Bluray Disks in the pack).    I enjoyed the theatrical film when I saw it in the theater, but the extended edition flows much better and is a much more satisfying experience. I'm not sure how many people and critics who hated the movie in theaters will be swayed by the extended cut, but I think that most people who at least somewhat enjoyed the original cut will get much more out of the extended cut.    For people who missed Sucker Punch in theaters, skip the standard edition and go right for the extended edition. It provides a much fuller experience and it's easier to understand than the cut down theatrical cut.    It should be noted that the extended edition is Rated R, not NR. It is the cut of the film that the director had intended for theatrical release. The studio insisted on the movie being released as PG13, which is why we got the less satisfying, more confusing theatrical release. After watching the extended cut, I came to two very clear conclusions: The MPAA ratings board system is completely broken for giving the extended edition an R rating and the Studio made a horrible decision in forcing a cut that would prune the rating to PG13. It's beyond me how the deleted scenes would raise the rating from PG13 to R. It's also beyond me how the studio believed it would be better to have a somewhat \\"crippled\\" PG13, that really suffers from the cuts, rather than just going with the much better R rated version.    Also, shame on the studio for not offering the extended cut on the standard bluray edition, nor in the DVD edition. Fortunately for blu-ray owners, the price premium here on Amazon is miniscule, but sadly, people still stuck on DVDs miss out entirely.
B00138KN3C|5.0|There are some artists who save their best stuff for first.  Bruce Springsteen is one of those.  His first album was, at the time of it's release, not like anything else ever heard.  Is this rock? yes. but folksy, like Dylan? hmmm, not really but maybe. Bluesy? yes and no.<br /><br />The lyrics for all the songs on this album are unique.  Poetry and passion are clear in every word, but that is where the coherence ends.  As soon as \\"little early burley comes by in his curley wurley,\\" we wonder what is going on.  Then Wild Billy, that crazy cat, \\"shook some dust out of his coon skin cap.\\"  Good for him. What are you talking about? (I don't know, but I do know that Janey's fingers were in the cake).<br /><br />We know he came for her (\\"for you\\") but we are not sure what a \\"nursery mouth\\" is.  We know he didn't come because of the way she was \\"stretched out on the floor,\\" because, obviously, he had already \\"ran through all her windows\\" and did something to her doors.  What are you talking about? (I don't know, but I do know that you can \\"do what you like, but don't do it here\\").<br /><br />I didn't know Arkansas had a Queen. I don't know who the servants are, where they are going, or what they are doing when they are here. I don't know how Matadors got into this music. And I didn't know pimps had prophets nor that Bronx had apostles (with his hand on his hardware, no less).<br /><br />But I know this: it was a good day in music history when Bruce penned these lines, wrote this music and greeted us from Asbury Park NJ.  There may not be a better debut album ever produce by a rock and roller.  This might be the very soul of a Jersey poet put to song. This might be the best he has to offer.
B004O05NNQ|5.0|Got the discs very quickly, discs were in perfect (new) condition and had no issues with packaging or the casing. **Would have preferred the case not in plastic and maybe some type of thick paper but not a big concern**<br />LOVE THESE GUYS!!!
B0050CQY1W|4.0|Forget that this is a collection of records and not an album of songs, Beyonce's \\"4\\" has enough hooks, catchphrases, bridges, releases, repetition and spunk to almost make you forget how forgettable this music is. But lawdy the lady sings the crap out of it - even if there is way too much multi-tracking of her voice for my personal taste. You can also ignore her attempts to out-Rihanna Rihanna (\\"Run The World (Girls)\\" and \\"Countdown\\"). And of course the juvenile nature of the emotions portrayed in the lyrics (\\"I'd rather die than live without your love\\" \\"We like to party\\") can be overlooked. And please forgive Beyonce for her rendition of songwriter Dianne Warren's \\"I Was Here\\" feeling as out of place as a gymnast in a sumo wrestling match in spite of her stellar performance.<br /><br />What matters here is the abundance of hits here for the mining. We've already gone through \\"1+1\\" and \\"Run The World (Girls)\\" and \\"4\\" is just in stores today. Waiting for their turn to be unearthed are \\"Best Thing I Never Had\\" (already making some noise), \\"Countdown,\\" \\"Love On Top,\\" \\"I Care,\\" \\"Start Over\\" and \\"Party.\\"<br /><br />Though she never sounds less than superb, Beyonce's \\"4\\" is like a large portion of cotton candy, tasty, enjoyable and insubstantial. If her intention was to invade the pop terrain of current superstars such as the previously mentioned Rihanna and sugary comic Katy Perry, she has proven again that she's more talented than Britney Spears. She's going to have to do a lot better than this if she wants to continue her world domination. I just hope she doesn't turn into another Mariah Carey, squandering a brilliant voice on material that is beneath her abilities.
B004LWZW2E|5.0|I thought this movie was absolutely great! I love how that made it like the older horror movies with the creepy 70s and 80s horror music, and how the first act was different then the second act. At first i didn't like the ending, but now I realize that the ending was freaking great; it still provided suspense in its own twisted way. For you LOVE non-slasher horror movies I would advise you buying this movie!
0553582038|1.0|Martin has built up such an enormous narrative debt here with this &#34;continuation&#34; of the story, that it is next to impossible to keep fresh in your head everything that took place previously in the first two books of the tale. In other words, continuity is totally lost (you can't keep track of everything) unlike reading say Shakespeare's Henriad, Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, Moorcock's Elric saga, and Hebert's first three Dune novels. Also, the scope is so large that it is also difficult to infer where the author is going here. These two issues make for frustrated reading. Overall, this is the problem with modern fantasy, sci-fi literature, namely, knowing when to quit and end the story instead of drawing things out in order to create a cash cow, like Charlaine Harris' Sookie Stackhouse novels. A story should have a beginning, a middle, and an end. Martin should have stayed with his original plan to keep this as a trilogy. My prediction about how the series will end is as follows: Daenerys(a charcater I dislike very much)will change her allegiance because of The Others and ally with her foes to fight for a greater cause. During this, she falls in love with one of her former foes becoming Queen of the North, uniting both kingdoms where they live happily ever after. How predictable.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|So what if it displays a tiny ad at the bottom of the screen - it does the job wonderfully and it's free.
B0055FR5PS|1.0|A total waste of time and money. Absolutely brainless. Smoke and automatic weapon fire, yelling and that's it. Really. That's IT for 90 minutes.
B00021HBGS|4.0|These bath cars and streets are perfect for the bath. They stick pretty well to the wet bathtub and are colorful and durable enough to be fun outside the tub, too. There were more shapes than I expected, which is a plus. We don't use the streets much because they are large and heavy and, when my son tries to 'drive' on them with the cars, they just slide down the sides of the tub.  But, other than that - it is a great toy.
B0034G4ORC|1.0|If you like to sit, slack-jawed (read: no synapse activity), and watch smoke, explosions, people yelling and automatic weapons going off for 90 minutes of your precious life, this is for you. Because that's ALL it is.     What pure, utter crap. Save your money for something with a thought behind it.

0385523912|5.0|This was a very interesting book about the difficulties and general conditions of life in North Korea. I was hooked immediately and learned quite a bit from this book while enjoying the process of doing so.    Note: I've seen some comparisons between this book and \\"The Road\\" (McCarthy) and I just wanted to state my disagreement with them. This book felt very 'real' to me while \\"The Road\\" seemed phony perhaps because it was fiction, I don't know.
B001HPP2XW|1.0|The packaging was horrible, it came without any bubblewrap around the case. It made the DVD cover to be completely broken.  Not worth the money I'm paying for. They should  defintely improve the packaging.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|dexter is the best show on tv right now. once you start an episode, you'll blow through the season in a few days. it's that good
B0037QGS0A|4.0|There isn't much bad to say about this movie. It was thrilling from beginning to end. Julian Moore and Amanda Siegfried were brilliant; Moore is a wife who suspects her husband is cheating on her, and Siegfried is a prostitute. Their relationship is the key to the movie's success.<br /><br />Also, for those who like that sort of thing, there was an intense love scene between the two. Exciting and sexy is a good combination. Chloe is well worth watching and buying.
B004P02OJ6|1.0|Get real people, bad storyline, dragged out, not the usual RC movie, what a disappointment!  Too long, and to have Liam Neeson on the credits was a joke-he's in the movie for like 3 minutes.
B004WPYNY8|3.0|I'm in the camp who think that Symphony X's greatest work was \\"V\\" and it's worst being \\" Paradise\\". Having given \\"Iconoclast\\" a few spins I would say that it is a lot better than \\"Paradise\\" but falls short of \\"V\\".  First the good, all members of the band are exceptional musicians. Michael Romeo in particular is one of the best guitarists out there.  There is a layered complexity in this music that makes it an enjoyable listen.  However, there are a lot of annoying things that also hold the album back.  The first being that the songs lack a sense of identity.  From \\"Odyssey\\" back, a listener could instantly identify a song by hearing a short clip.  The vast majority of \\"Iconoclast's\\" songs are of similar tempo, volume and tone without any real hooks.   The result being the album feels like one really, really long song.  There aren't any real changes in volume other than the change from piano to guitar.  Once the guitar part picks up it sort of hangs there at a set speed for its duration. The sound engineer didn't punch up the parts that needed punched or pull back the ambient parts when they needed to recede.  The lyrics are also quite juvenile, on the order of \\"The Ballad of the Power Rangers\\" bad. Overall \\"Iconoclast\\" is a mixed bag. Its not the phoned in effort that \\"Paradise\\" was, but it's \\"sameness\\" throughout and unrefined lyrics hold it back from being truly great.
B0051OZ564|5.0|Great action, great music, entertaining, authentic, the cast really connected with their roles, uniquely artistic, kind of soulful.  Felt quite original.  My artistic takehome was the aformentioned combined with an excellent metaphor for the human condition, suffering, and the struggle for freedom.

B00364K6YW|5.0|I have read most of the reviews on here and I am in total agreement with all the positive reviews- 5 stars and more!!!  The actors are all amazing, Colin Firth is outstanding and alluring as Mr. Darcy as well as Jennifer Ehle,she is truly divine to watch, as well as the other actors, who all compliment each other well.     Although I am somewhat familiar with the storyline, it does not take away from the immense pleasure and anticipation for each and every scene, so rich in dialogue as well as entertaining.    Restrain yourself as I am , I just ordered it, and look at one episode per day, it just leaves you wanting more and more..and when I am finished ...will still want more and more...that's how good it is!!  If I had a past life, I would have liked to have lived and to have experienced this wonderful period in history....and now I can truly live it..:)
B004FOA84A|5.0|Fantastic app. Very well done. As others have stated it's a bit short but what do you expect for a buck or two. Well worth the money and your children will love to play this again and again. I played through it with my 4 year old the first time. Took about 2 hours with him, over the course of 4 days or so. Now he plays it all the time by himself. If you have a young one (4-9) do yourself a favor, buy this, and spend an evening with them solving the puzzles together.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|It works great on the HTC Evo. Not slow, has never frozen on me and I played it til my phone died. One thing is: this game eats you battery, fast!!! Love it on the PC and I love it on my phone ... Great game..
B004WOS7LO|5.0|First- Let me say, I am writing this in a time crunch, and will extend it later.      Get the Deluxe version!  The two bonus tracks, are incredible, and equivalent to some of the albums best songs, and the 30 minute behind the scenes DVD, is a MUST see for any David Cook fan(Watching it as I write this).     I could dissect the album, and will later, but right now only have time for a nutshell review.    The Bonus Track \\"This is not the last time\\" would have made a GREAT summer single, so disappointed it did not make the cut.  Reminds me of Daughtry's mega-hit \\"No Surprise\\".      \\"Right Here, With You\\" and \\"Hard to Believe\\" are surprising songs where the verse's are more enjoyable than the chorus, and are so great, that they make the songs two of my favorites.      Cicardian, Take me as I am, Time marches on, Goodbye to the girl, and Rapid eye movement are easily my favorites.     Fade into me bores me a tad to be honest, but, I think it will grow.    The last goodbye is easily my least favorite, so out of place on this masterpiece of a record, and a disappointing first single(With a great music video!).     After a very mainstream(yet AMAZING) debut, this Sophomore album is such a breathe of fresh air.  Such an incredible, original, unique, album.  Like nothing I have ever heard.    Just take the final 2 and a half, fully instrumental ending to Rapid Eye Movement.  With the haunting vocals in the background.    What an incredible album.  David Cook has taken himself from being a \\"Singer\\", to being an \\"Artist\\".  A MUST BUY.      Will update the review in maybe a month.  Just spent a LONG time doing a track by track IN DEPTH review, and Windows updated without any warning.  I was completed with the review, and lost EVERYTHING.  Irate......
B001GZ6QEC|4.0|[[ASIN:B0017I1FP8 The Dark Knight]]This is a fantastic movie. The city fulled with corruption, rotten and idealistic politicians, bad cops, good cops and in the middle of that: The Batman. Chris Bale is the propper Brue Wayne and Batman as well as his police link Jim Gordon played by Gary Oldman. This last is probably the best Jim Gordon ever; he does a human work playing the comissioner we all need, and along the director Chris Nolan Warner Bros has made a franchise we all beleive in. The Batman is an undestructible and credible hero. Let's not forget my favorite thing in movies: The score by composers Hanz Zimmer and James Newton Howard (Howard doesn't appear in the extra features..)The extra features are what we all fans expect.. I can't wait to see the next Batman film.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Doesn't work on my droid x so it gets a one star.. If it worked then it would have had a five star cuz this game was fun while it worked.
6305128952|5.0|If you are a fan of Robert Redford, and enjoy stories about horses and people, this movie is for you.  It is entertaining, and though a bit long, never gets boring.  It gave me a lot of surprises.  Redford's charcter's simplistic view of life is thought-provoking.  Well worth the price and one I've shared.
B0034G4P8U|2.0|*** Warning, potential spoilers ahead, read at your own risk.  Some events intentionally discussed in different order than they really occurred***    Whatever you do, don't be deceived by all the glowing reviews here.  After sitting through this movie and seeing for myself, I can easily say that it's the worst by far in the series.  The plot has holes big enough to hide Cybertron (i.e. how did Megatron come back to life again, and end up in the middle of Africa?).  The acting is equally forced and without any dramatic effect (why in God's name do they keep insisting on pushing Sam's lame parents into the story?!)  And why couldn't Sam have finally found a real woman with an actual brain to be his girlfriend?  Rosie is even more lifeless than Megan Fox on screen and is obviously little more than eye candy since even her few dialogue scenes are shot from behind to highlight the backside that is her only real asset.      Did I mention this is also the longest Transformers movie (152 minutes?!)?  That really shocks me - especially when nothing really important even happens during the entire first half of the film.  I found myself checking my watch several times throughout, and that is never a good sign when watching a movie.  They start by showing the back-story involving the manned space missions to the moon, but after that it just stalls for at least 45 minutes as it flails around trying to fill in the last few years of Sam's life (oh, he's ended up with another bimbo, big surprise; gee, nothing says \\"exciting action movie\\" like a half hour of Sam sitting around pushing paper in an office cubicle).  If they had at least given Sam somebody actually worth saving, the movie might have had some actual drama to it.  Even in the eventual cliche \\"lovers reunite and run towards each other to embrace\\" scene, Rosie stops after only a couple awkward steps and makes Sam run the entire distance to her (wow, really great job capturing the drama there, Bay).  Even Shia has this weird \\"was she really even worth it\\" expression on his face during their embrace (you can tell throughout the entire movie that Shia had to force himself to work with her).  Then, after an eternity (probably close to an hour in), the film finally gets back to the Autobots trying to reach the moon before the Decepticons in order to protect whatever it is that's there.  I'm still not sure how they never detected the energy signature on the moon two movies ago when they were first flying towards Earth but, hey, it is what it is.      Then, inexplicably (it's almost like Bay just ran checked his watch and said \\"okay, we filled 2.5 hours, let's quit\\"), the movie decides to go on fast-forward and end after yet another super quick (read, one hit) battle between Optimus and Megatron in which Megatron's head is dismembered.  Literally, after Optimus wins and utters a stupid one-liner about never forsaking humans, the credits roll.  Wait, isn't this supposed to be a grand finale to the series?  And the utlimate climactic sequence took only two minutes and there was no real conclusion whatsoever?  Just another mailed-in money grab that puts a once promising franchise out of its misery at a new low.  In fact, the best part was actually the Captain America trailer that showed before it started.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|One of Disney's best.  Inspiring.  Historical.  Fascinating all the way through.  The finish could not be better.  But it is one of those you don't want to see end.  One of the best movies I've seen in a good while - twice in the theater - now by owning it.  Any time I need to be uplifted, watching this movie again is a good way to do it.  The horse was fantastic as well as the acting.  It surprised me not to see it winn an award.  Nice to see a  movie you don't have to be ashamed to watch with your grandchildren, for a change.
B000I2MRHE|2.0|My daughter hated tummy time, she would struggle to prop up so she could see things, so I thought she might like this little gym. The mat is way too small, when she was on the spinner in the middle her head extended almost all the way out past the edge. There is also no way to strap a baby in, so you end up with a young infant dangling in the air off a piece of plastic. When she got tired she still flopped her head to the floor, only now her neck is resting on a plastic edge. The cover for the spinner is also just a piece of cloth, not much padding to it.   Overall, good idea but bad in practice. If your baby is old enough to be safe/comfortable playing on it, then they are old enough not to need it.  Very uncomfortable, and my daughter hated it.
B002ZG99CC|5.0|first i just loved the cast. the movie is kind of long and drawn out, but with jadens witty attitude you are able to get through the movie and not be bored. the movie was powerful and had the best meaning of all. never give up. i took my nephews and niece to see this movie and they love it. everytime they come over they enjoy watching this movie. has some bad words, but not too much.
B000003TA4|5.0|I grew up mostly in the 1990's.  I graduated from high school in 2000 and this is still the band/album that I associate w/ that time of my life.  W/out a doubt the grunge era will be my favorite genre of music for the rest of my life.  So many bands like Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Temple of the Dog, Mad Season, etc.  This however will be the album I associate w/those times the most.  It was the equivalent of Appetite For Destruction in the 80s Led Zeppelin's Zoso & and Pink Floyd's The Wall in the 70s.    I fell sad that the only two bands left that I feel that passionately about are NIN(past and current) and 1990s TOOL(Opiate, Undertow, Aenima).  I remember when MTV meant something to the music scene and the vast majority of their line-up was actual music videos.  Who would have thought that a channel named Music Television would actually play music videos?  There are only a few albums that are hit songs throughout the entire album & this is one of them.  However, Ten by Pearl Jam has probably a better top to bottom song selection.
B004SQS9FA|2.0|Now that Radiohead have put out more albums of casio keyboard styled low-fi laptop pop music than they have of the thought provoking british rock I fell in love with... I guess I'm just not a fan anymore. I respect these guys for doing things on their own terms...but I just don't get anything out of this style. For that, maybe it's not fair for me to review this album. But as a fan that was clinging to the hope that these guys would put down the computers in favor of guitars or that Thom Yorke would actually really sing again, frankly I'm once again disappointed. And I'm just not sure I'll waste my time on the next album. Maybe Radiohead is still good and I just don't get this style. I really don't know. But speaking on behalf of those that loved Pablo Honey, The Bends and Ok Computer... this is just another album that doesn't deserve to be part of that same catalog. If you're a fan of the albums that followed Ok Computer, and you're looking for more of the same...well, here ya go.
1609419693|3.0|First let me say that I like Tina Fey.  I think she's funny, smart, and talented, and that's why I got this audiobook from the library.  Having just finished listening to it, I have to say I wasn't that impressed.  There are some humorous parts in it, the descriptions about her dad, and her in-laws, but for the most part it seems to be standard stories about her childhood  (getting her first period-in every memoir written by a woman),  her rise to celebrity in spite of gender bias (Second City, SNL and 30 Rock) and motherhood (breastfeeding and the typical celebrity \\"working mom\\" guilt).  Who is her target audience?  The only group I can think of is young girls wanting to get into the business and her trying to show them Women can make it!  The next question I have to ask is, \\"Why did she write this?\\"  I sincerely hope it wasn't just for the money, but since there isn't much to this book, I can't figure out what else the motivation was, unless it was to defend herself and get back at anyone whom she ever perceived wronged her, which is an ongoing theme of the book.    A lot of the material seems a little forced too.  Like she's trying to be Interesting and Funny (her best friends in high school were lesbians and she learned that gay people were not put on this earth for her amusement, but were real people too). Really?  Is that all you got?         And then there's the whole working mom parts of the book.  As a working mom myself,  I found her \\"working mom\\" reference of  knowing what it's like to try and get a lot done on a Sat. because \\"I'm a working mom\\" pretty outrageous.  Pleeze!  She's a mom and she works, thus a \\"working mom\\" (who makes god-only-knows how much money) so I'm pretty sure she is not cleaning her house and going to the grocery store, and doing laundry on Saturdays.  And as all high-powered women executives I know she refers to her childcare provider as the babysitter, never the Nanny or Au Pair (for affected faux middle-class stature?).  She doesacknowledge this attempt at low-browing it-so I guess that's something...but instead of connecting with most working moms as is her attempt, I think she alienates them, at least that's how I felt.    She dishes about insider info on SNL, specifically about the Sarah Palin parodies, and 30 Rock, which I found mildly interesting, but I think most people like this sort of thing and will eat it up.      I know I sound like a curmudgeon, but I think this book just didn't do a lot for me.  I think as talented as Tina Fey is she could've written a less forced, funnier book rather than a canned \\"I'm a big Celebrity Now--Kaching!\\" book   Glad I got this at the library.
B0050LJIRK|5.0|This album sounds dated...which is awesome because that 90's-2000 sound has been lost in so much of today's music.  Aggressive rap/metal is completely absent from the radio.  The breakdown.    Bring it back:  5/5...outstanding chorus gets your head nodding    Gold Cobra:  4.5/5...sounds like it could be straight off 3 dollar bill yall    Shark Attack:  4/5... only gets 4 because of some stupid lyrics, but has a good sound    Get A Life:  5++/5... hands down my favorite off the album... crazy beat and riff...chorus is the high point. makes you want to beat the crap out of someone.  Upset there are not more high energy tracks like this    Shotgun:  4.5/5... Great song, chorus gets stuck in your head    Douchebag:  3.5/5...Probably one of the lamer high energy tracks on the album    Walking Away:  4/5... The better of the \\"softer\\" songs.  Limp should stick with the heavy and avoid these.  great ending though    Loser:  3/5 ...  ehhhhhhhhh?    Autotunage:  4.5/5... kinda cheesy but its grown on me    90.2.10:  4/5... party track    Why Try:  5/5... nice track, good rhymes...why try?    Killer In You:  5/5... good flow, great ending to the album, chorus somewhat annoying.    If you want to go back a decade musically ...buy this album!!

B00506NRBS|5.0|While Derek Siver's new book about the start and sale of CD Baby offers many interesting and surprising entrepreneurship lessons, the heart of the book is Derek's story itself. Derek plainly explains how he never meant to start the revolutionary CD company that eventually grew to 85 people and sold for $22 million. You can go along for the ride with him in Anything You Want, which reads like a memoir rather than a how-to, and ends with a surprising redemptive moment you won't see coming.
0060557818|4.0|Richard Mayhew has a life that most men would envy: He's got a good job, a nice apartment in London, and he's about to be married to a beautiful wealthy woman. But when he stops to help a girl (named Door) in the street, Richard soon finds that he's slipped through the cracks into Neverwhere: a magical and frightening underground London that people like Richard never knew existed. How could he have known that his Random Act of Kindness would ruin everything? And, most importantly, how can he get his old life back?<br /><br />Neil Gaiman rarely fails to amuse me with his creative concepts, quirky humor, and over-the-top villains, and Neverwhere, the novelization of his BBC television program of the same name, has all that. What it doesn't have is a tight and gripping plot or exciting and well-developed heroes. Richard is an average guy who's mostly along for the ride and Door and her monster-hunter bodyguard (named Hunter) aren't too stimulating either. The best characters are the caricatured villains, Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar, ancient assassins who enjoy killing famous world leaders and biting the heads off kittens. This is totally and purposely overdone, and humorous because of it.<br /><br />What makes Neverwhere worth reading is, without doubt, its wonderfully fantastical setting: an alternate London Underground. After visiting Neverwhere, you'll never look at a London Tube Station map the same way again. Ever wonder how Earl's Court Station got its name? Well, obviously, because a medieval lord holds court there. Who are the Blackfriars? And what about Islington at Angel Station? You'll meet them all and discover what they're up to in Neverwhere. I am not familiar with Underground London, but Neil Gaiman made me want to don a headlamp and begin exploring its closed off tunnels and tracks (\\"Mind the Gap!\\"). He could have done more with this setting, so I hope that someday he'll write another novel in this world (a sequel has been rumored for years).<br /><br />The other aspect of Neverwhere that I think is really well done is Richard's confusion about what is real. Is he really in another world below London, or is he just going mad? It's estimated that ' to ½ of the homeless are schizophrenic and Gaiman captured their delusional behaviors so well, explaining them in the context of Neverwhere.<br /><br />\\"Neil Himself\\" narrated the audio version I listened to. He's a good reader and his voice is always pleasant, but I think it's a little too light and upbeat for some of the darker scenes in Neverwhere. Still, it's nice to hear the author's interpretation of his own work.rwhere that I think is really well done is Richard's confusion about what is real.

B0050CQY1W|5.0|Purchased this album yesterday! I must say I loved it from start to finish. I have literally listened to this album like 3-4 times already and the songs below about 5 times a piece. Despite rumors of the album flopping i seriously doubt that! I recommended this album to 5 people who went out and purchased it right away and fell in love with it.     My Favorites:    END OF TIME  COUNTDOWN  PARTY  I MISS YOU  LOVE ON TOP  RATHER DIE YOUNG  WHO RUN THE WORLD    The entire album was a success for me. I absolutely love it.
B004GUSG4M|3.0|Even though the book was too long, the premise is interesting and for the most part the book is well written.  The character, Christine Lucas has lost her entire memory due to a traumatic event.  Each day she awakes with no memory of her life for the past twenty years.  She begins to keep a journal so she can remember the day before and hopefully start to string together a life.  In the process she begins to mistrust her husband and caregiver.  The middle bogs down and I believe the author could have moved the story along quicker.  Having said that, I wanted to know what happened to her and was surprised by the ending.  And that doesn't happen often.

0061784788|5.0|When I first read the publisher's summary of The Devil Colony I thought that I knew how it would end because I am familiar with Mormon doctrine on the American Indian. I was wrong. Author James Rollins fooled me again. The Devil Colony is one of his best, if not the best, novels. It has all of the history, science, action and adventure that are in his earlier works. Several intricate subplots add to the drama that make it one great read.<br /><br />The story is hard to summarize because so much action is happening simultaneously. However, the story begins with the discovery by 2 boys of mummified bodies and an ancient artifact from a Utah Native American site. The artifact threatens a prominent Mormon belief that the Native American Indian is the lost Israeli tribe of Manassah. When scientists arrive at the site, there is an explosion that is blamed on a bomb planted by a Native American girl. However, the explosion was too large to be from a man made bomb and the Sigma Force operatives are called in. Soon nanotechnology, volcanology, a secret group called the Guild, Fort Knox, Thomas Jefferson's relationships with Lewis and Clark, the Iriquois, and a 14th colony that tried to be included with the 13 that formed the U.S.A. enter this intricate plot. It's an amazing grouping of subject matter that I don't think has ever been attempted before.<br /><br />You simply MUST read The Devil Colony. It is too good to pass up.
B00479SVBU|5.0|Bought this because I have an older stereo and no way to play my IPOD Shuffle in the truck. This works great,the sound is loud and clear with no hums or buzzes so far. Been playing with it since I got it today. Plays in my truck, in my wifes car even picked it up on the radio in the garage while it played in the truck. The house stereo picks it up loud and clear from about 30 feet away.(probably goes farther than that)  The display says \\"no device connected\\" but it was playing songs from my shuffle, did'nt really use the buttons on the transmitter, other than to change stations. I used the suffle to change songs and even the volumn to a degree, although sometimes if the volumn is too high on the shuffle the sound is not as good on the stereo. I have not tired it with USB or SD card, I'm no expert and I'm not using all the features this transmitter comes with but I anticipate many years of fun and satisfaction from this transmitter. On longer trips, we go through areas that do not have radio reception and picking through and changing CD's can  be a pain, this way I can take lots of music in one little package. Love it :)
B004WOS3P4|5.0|This is a wonderful second album from David Cook. I am impressed with the concept of the album. David's vocals are spot on and musically the album works on many levels. My favorite songs are Rapid Eye Movement, Goodbye To The Girl and Time Marches On. I would recommend this album and also say that it is best listening from start to finish. Rapid Eye Movement is a stellar song and it caps off the album perfectly.

030745455X|3.0|This is the second in the Millennium series and the follow-up to The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. Everyone is back including Mikael Blomkvist and his journalistic team, but the mysterious and enigmatic Lisbeth Salander, the \\"girl\\" in the title, takes center stage here.<br /><br />To label Lisbeth as a unique protagonist is an understatement; barely five feet tall and weighing in at less than 100 lbs, she's a computer genius, anti-social, paranoid, prone to violence and fearless. In The Girl Who Played With Fire the reader learns about her extremely troubled past as well as what makes her \\"tick\\", which is both the good and bad news, for at times this book strains credibility - even for a fictional thriller. Also on the downside the story here takes forever and a day to get rolling - which may test the reader's patience - it did mine.<br /><br />The core plot concerns the murder of two free-lance journalists working for Blomkvist just before the publication of their expose on the illicit sex trade in Sweden - the circumstantial evidence of the crime pointing directly at Lisbeth as the culprit. The ensuing investigations - plural here because the police, Mikael and Lisbeth all somewhat independently pursue their own - are what finally drive the story. And there is a neat little twist concerning Lisbeth's past which does save the book. The problem is that it takes 200+ pages to get to the \\"case\\", whereas 50 would have been more than enough. Also once Lisbeth \\"engages\\" more than a few of her exploits are a tad over the top - putting James Bond, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Rambo to shame.<br /><br />Understanding the unique circumstances of the publication of this series - the author passed away soon after submitting the manuscripts - editing surely posed a problem - still a red pen and some cutting would have helped, particularly at the start of this novel.<br /><br />That being said once the story begins to unfold this is an engaging read. And if you enjoyed \\"Dragon Tattoo\\" you'll like this one - although probably not as much.ough probably not as much.
6304873441|5.0|This is one of the most spectacular films I've seen. So much so that I spent most of my life believing it was a Disney movie.<br />What I adored most was the music. The songs are memorable, the scenes are beautifully illustrated and it mixes russian history  with a tad of mysticism to give things an extra kick. The only thing that might prove a little scary for the kids is the villan. Rasputin. Based on  the man of the same name that was famous for being extremely hard to kill.  He's basically a walking zombie  with an annoying voice but if it were anything too scary I wouldn't have given it five stars. (I was one of the most  nightmare-prone children on the planet when it came to movies yet I simply loved this even then.). Anastasia's nightmare may also prove a little scary because it starts out beautiful before featuring some pretty scary-looking figures but other than that everything is great. I'm certain adults will like this film and small children will like it too(Though they most likely won't understand it completely.) I reccomend it.
B0050CQY1W|4.0|Beyonce's albums have so far been filled with songs that sometimes are mere snippets of melody, spare frames of songs hung on monster beats that somehow work. \\"Single Ladies\\" is essentially all hook, so much so it implants itself in your skull like some earworm, there for eternity whether you like it or not. Then you have stadium-sized ballads, like 'Halo\\", which soar straight out of your headphones into the stratosphere.    Her fourth album is a terrific addition to her body of work, with plenty of what we like Beyonce for, adding just enough surprises to keep us hooked from start to finish. There's four or five songs that will be on her eventual Greatest Hits album, and only a few you could skip over without missing much...    The first song on the album is a classic ballad, \\"1+1\\". It's got a great, old school vibe to it...\\"old school\\" came to mind a lot when first listening to the album, and in mostly a good way...and I LOVE the guitar solo at the end. If you told me this was a lost epic ballad from the early 80's, I would believe you. She doesn't always do the obvious in her songs (to her credit), which doesn't always work. Here, the way she ends each line with that octave jump, it totally works. This song could END her concert, and it'd be awesome.    \\"I Care\\" is a pulsing, mid-tempo tune, where the snippet/hook isn't good enough. Not bad, but it pales with the songs yet to come.    \\"I Miss You\\" has a minimal Casio-keyboard drum track with near subliminal synth washes draped behind her pleading vocals. The nice thing is that it doesn't stick around more than it has to. In an era where songs go on FOREVER, this is great to see/hear. I imagine a lot of people sending this song to their loved ones...maybe with different interpretations though...    \\"Best Thing I Never Had\\" is a big, glossy pop epic...and with over a half-dozen writers and a half-dozen producers...including Babyface...it had better be. Big piano chords, smashing drums, ecstatic strings, tempo shifts...but they needed seven writers to come with a line, \\"Sucks to be you right now?\\" I kid: I thought this was a great song. Single written all over it.    \\"Party\\" with Andre 3000 and Kanye West comes next, but it is surprisingly low-key and conventional...not exactly what comes to mind when you picture those three in a room. I hate to say this, but this was a little yawn-worthy...    \\"Rather Die Young\\" has a breathtaking 70's sound...like a classic late Motown girl-group, or maybe a little Roberta Flack? Still working on finding the right analogy; it's driving me a bit nuts. After the sleepy preceding song, this mid-tempo ballad-with-hand-claps-and-finger-snaps will snap you to attention. The little synthesizer noodling at the end punctuates it perfectly.    I'd like to mention how Beyonce uses instruments here in spectacular fashion. The guitar solo in the first song, piano shows up clear and strong on several tunes. There are some SERIOUS horns on a few songs, and there are string/orchestral flourishes and synthesizer lines that add detail and harmony and it all works.    \\"Start Over\\" is a sub-\\"Halo\\" power ballad. Perfectly adequate.    Oh my God what a ray of sunshine is \\"Love On Top\\"! A sunny R&B/pop gem meant for convertibles and beaches and backyard BBQ's...when you picture Beyonce singing this, she's smiling. Irresistible. Absolutely irresistible. Happy music pure and simple. The ascending key changes to run out the song is one classy touch. Sassy horn section here.    \\"Countdown\\" kinda starts with a \\"Rocky\\"-ish horn intro, then a little Boyz II Men countdown, then this repetitive staccato melody fragment. A weird amalgam...again, she doesn't make obvious musical choices all the time. I like the \\"killing me softly\\" quote...maybe I wasn't so off with the Roberta Flack comment. First time around, I really didn't like this one...but it makes me smile now, and that's worth a lot. Hooks with humor.    \\"End of Time\\" is another new classic, bound to be done at cheerleading/stepping competitions for decades to come. Bouncy, proud, booty-shaking with sizzling horn charts...this could be a show-stopper on tour.     \\"I Was Here\\" is a ballad written by Diane Warren, who has written pretty much a song for every artist ever in the history of ever. It's another \\"big\\" ballad that Beyonce does well, and Warren writes well. But I think it suffers in comparison to the rest of this album, and that's saying something. It would make a great soundtrack song for the right romantic scene in a movie...    The album ends with the worst song of the whole record. That whole snippet/fragment/melody thing WAY doesn't work...and I don't think it's because I'm just not a girl and I don't \\"get it.\\" It's kinda awful. Irritating to sit through.    So, you got some of the best singles of the year, surrounded by some pretty sweet filler and really only one clunker.   Few people will be disappointed...this is an easy recommendation.

No use writing another review that summarizes the content.<br /><br />I believe that the bottom line with a review is whether or not someone would recommend this to others. I also believe the bottom line with questions like \\"Would you recommend this to others?\\" is whether or not you actually do. Well, I read this on my Kindle casually in about two hours, then later that night I came back to Amazon.com and purchased and shipped three copies to my recently graduated friends trying to start their own companies. Mind you, I am a cash-strapped college student, so I do not have a lot of extra money to spend. I think the ideas in this book are worth spreading, so I spent some of what I have to help them spread.<br /><br />Buy this book. You won't regret it.
B000059TFO|5.0|Watching this brilliant film always puts me in mind, oddly one might at first think, of a song from Rodgers and Hammerstein's 1949 South Pacific, particularly when Willem Defoe's character, agent Alan Ward, asks the question of Gene Hackman's, agent Rupert Anderson; \\"where does all this hate come from?\\" If agent Ward had been a fan of Hollywood musicals he'd have already known that the answer is neatly encapsulated in Oscar Hammerstein's lyric for the song `You've got to be taught':    You've got to be taught  To hate and fear,  You've got to be taught  From year to year,  It's got to be drummed  In your dear little ear  You've got to be carefully taught.    You've got to be taught to be afraid  Of people whose eyes are oddly made,  And people whose skin is a diff'rent shade,  You've got to be carefully taught.    You've got to be taught before it's too late,  Before you are six or seven or eight,  To hate all the people your relatives hate,  You've got to be carefully taught!    The movie brilliantly evokes the atmosphere of hate and fear that must have been palpable in those early years of the sixties, precipitated by a clash of cultures and a dread of the unknown future that many would have readily killed to avoid. The characters of Ward and Anderson, whilst given light and shade through the performances of the two leads, almost too neatly embody the values and aspirations of those two cultures: the former, young, liberal, idealistic and rule book bound; the latter, middle-aged, conservative, cynical and willing to do whatever it takes to get the job done: that being to bring the arrogant, snearing killers of three young civil rights activists to justice. However, all of the acting performances are uniformally excellent but there are parts in the film where real life members of the local community are interviewed - and these are truly chilling.    Mississippi Burning has been criticized for romanticizing the FBI's role in the investigation and, to some extent, rewriting history. Both criticisms would be justified if this was simply a documentary. It isn't social commentary, it's fiction based on fact. It's an entertainment; a product of the film industry designed to make a profit. Whatever the criticisms it is a brilliantly realized evocation of a dark part of human history that epitomizes all that is mean-spirited, evil and base in human beings and lies at the beginnings of journeys that end in Belsen, Dachau and Srebrinica. It should be compulsory viewing in our schools.
0425241505|3.0|This book was funny and romantic with fantastic sex scenes. I loved how the characters came together and took time to get to know one another before doing the deed. I think that Ms. Harrison is going to be on my list of upcoming authors to look out for. I am an avid reader and always on the lookout for new authors. I can also usually ignore things but this time I cannot ignore a few minor things in the book that just got to me. Ms Harrison we live in the 20th century and no longer wear schrunchies and sunken lounges went out in the 70's. I hate to be so petty but somethings irritate me and this is some of them. Just my opinion! I think if you going to write a book about King then his surroundings including his woman should have the surroundings of a King. When it comes to fashion and d&eacute;cor I think Ms. Harrison may need to consult somebody who has fashion and decorating sense. Otherwise I liked the book and I hope the second book in the series does not disappoint. I have had several new authors that started with a great first novels but the second book is crap!
0345529057|1.0|This is a fabulous series but not in this format.  I read these books when they were first released.  Since I had borrowed the books from the library, I thought it would be nice to own them.  The deal seemed unbeatable until I got the books.  The type is so small that neither my husband nor I could comfortably read them.  So, unless you have fabulous eyesight or a magnifying glass, chose these books in a different format.
0062060554|4.0|I saw this book featured in a summer reading reading section of the newspaper and am I glad I did. Ultimately suspenseful and very well crafted. One of those books that once you begin it is almost impossible to put it down. I had to force myself to take a break to eat. What a treat!
0765365278|3.0|I generally stay at least 100 yards away from long series made up of 1000 page books. However, I loved Elantris and the Mistborn series (though was thoroughly disappointed by Warbreaker) so I was hesitantly psyched about starting the Way of Kings. Because I had already read his other books, I didn't pay any attention to all of the hype that had built up around this book, and I'm very happy I didn't, because I think the let down would have been enough to make me stop reading within the first 300 pages. Which would have been sad, because it gets much better after that point. I'm a little mixed about this book, which is why I gave it 3 stars. Even though for me my dislikes outweigh what I like about it, I will pick up the next book and read it - though I won't be buying it.     Why I liked it:  1. The world was really intriguing. The landscape was very interesting and so different from what I've read before.   2. It was a fast read - once you got past the first 1/4 of it - because Sanderson doesn't waste many words. Nearly everything included has made the cut because it is necessary. For a 1000 page book, this was a pleasant surprise.    Why I didn't:  1. I didn't like switching characters. Usually I enjoy it, and it works well, but throughout the first 1/2 of the book the only character I liked was Kaladin. Even near the end I preferred Kaladin to Shallan or Dalinar. Kaladin simply seemed like the only one that was very developed. Shallan particularly didn't make complete sense to me.  2. While the world was really cool, I did have a couple hang-ups about it. Mainly - if all the animals had hard outer shells and such (which was really cool) why were there horses and chickens? Because they're convenient?   3. Not a whole lot happened. Like I said, everything included was necessary, but that doesn't mean much happened. Not when you consider the length of the book anyways.     So I'm glad I read it and I'll continue to read the rest of the series (assuming it doesn't suddenly take a turn for the worse), but by the end I'll have to go back and read short summaries of the previous ones because I won't be rereading them.
0790729636|5.0|bought movie because thought i had vhs, but found it an its was a dvd, but hey two twisters make or one for each room , still the best to watch with family
0756404738|5.0|Alright, let's admit the obvious first. Does it wrap up any plot lines? No. Do we learn anything new about the Chandrian, Amyr, or why there's so much silence in Kote's inn? No. Do we care in the least? No. Not really. When I turned the last page I was shocked to see that it was 1000 pages long. After just finishing Sanderson's Way of Kings I couldn't believe this book was only 7 pages shorter. Admittedly, Wise Man's Fear wasn't the first in a series, but still. The second book in a trilogy is one of the biggest tests for an author (along with the first book after a successful series) and I can think of very few authors who have passed this test with such high scores.     This book had me laughing hysterically, gasping in shock, and punching my pillow with anger. I don't think I've ever read a character as real as Kvothe. He is a very fully developed character who continues to evolve throughout the book. Admittedly a little fast at times such as his new found interest in sex and the abruptness of some of the violence. I love Rothfuss's writing style and the fact that it's written from only one viewpoint. (Ok, actually the interludes with Kote, Chronicler and Bast switch viewpoints a tiny bit now that I think about it).     Really, the only true issue that I had with the book was that the second half of the book in particular it felt like the plot jumped from one obstacle to the next. Like oops I just pulled off a Taborlin the Great stunt, now let's forget about it and go help this new friend, and now oops let's kill all these people. In some ways it did fall into the middle-book-of-a-trilogy rut where a lot of stuff happens but it all seems to be there just so other things can happen in the final book. Also - I kind of wanted to slap Denna. Multiple times.    I've read a lot of sequels or new books that I've been excited about in the past month that I hadn't been able to read while out of the country. But this one put them all to shame. No, it certainly wasn't perfect, but I could not put it down. Now I just wish they actually WOULD have just a year in between release dates like Rothfuss suggested in an interview so long ago. However, if he beats Wise Man's Fear in terms of how impossible it is to put it down, I won't mind the extra couple of years.

B00506NRBS|5.0|I got a sneak read of Anthing you want courtesy of The Domino Project & BzzAgent.com and instantly enjoyed it. It is a quick read but there is a lot of good stuff in there. My favorite is that it is okay to say no. I work in a huge corporation and we just had a meeting to discuss how some of our customers don't pay their bills, call more than average, and overall take up more money then they are giving us. I read Anything You Want the night before and spoke up in the meeting. I expressed how we could say no to these customers while choosing to reward the customers we want to keep around. Although it seemed like a basic concept, Anything You Want gave me the confidence to offer this approach to our business.
B0054NQZ9S|5.0|This is a movie about hard economic times where corporate big shots was the target as well as the little guy. It is a heart warming film all about families and how they cope with hard times.  It is a must watch for people who are down on their luck and hopefully they will do everything to not give up. If you are one of these people don't be a coward and take the easy way out by commiting suicide. Suck it up and take a new aproach because deep down in our soul we are all survivors no matter how bad it gets.
B002YOJBYG|4.0|Probably this is the best out on DVD. I have reviewed the minimalist version by Sutherland and the latest MET version. Ultimately we need to judge this version against the standard which is the Corelli and Price masterpiece in the 1960s on CD only. There is no other possible comparison. This is perhaps the greatest of all operas. Neither Domingo or Kabaivanska are up to the task. We shall have to wait another 20 years to find a five star performance of this glorious opera.
B0009S4IKQ|4.0|This is a must for Garbo fans.I purchased this movie before I had actually seen it and was not disappointed. Garbo is in true form as a balerina that has lost her motivation and is wooed by the great John Barrymore. Her classic line, \\"I want to be alone\\" is in this movie and she says it 3 times. Great movie to get a vibe as to the glamour and grandeur of old Hollywood. Great extras as well. A featurette about the making of the movie and one documenting the premiere is also included. Overall a must have for classic Hollywood fans.
B00006J9OV|3.0|This is a great opera, fantastic story and libretto, and great staging and orchestration. Everything is perfect but the opera is dull and inspired. There are no memorable arias period. Wagner must have been depressed when writing this... There is not a single memorable aria in this 4 hour opera....too bad.
B002RI9TB4|5.0|This book tells the harrowing story of the Nigerian civil war in the 1960s, or otherwise referred to as the Nigerian/Biafra conflict, through the eyes of a houseboy, two twin sisters, a professor and a British writer.<br /><br />This war is a seminal moment in African history that dwarfs in terms of scale when compared to other wars that the continent has endured in its post-colonial era. However, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, recently hailed by Salon as one of America's most promising young writers (20 under 40), brilliantly retold history that was richly infused with color, character and emotions, taking it out of the Western stereotypes of any African conflict.<br /><br />The story jumps back and forth between the period of the early sixties, which protrays Nigeria in the early days of its independence from British colonial rule, and the late sixties, during which the civil war took place. But inspite of the big socio-political backdrop, this book is more about the relationship of the different characters to each other and how that relationship is affected by the horrors of war than about history or politics.<br /><br />The characters really couldn't have been more different to each other, and their relationship to each other may well represent societal relationships in Nigeria at that time. The book started with Ugwu's story, a village boy employed as a houseboy in the home of an eccentric professor of Nsukka University, the first native university, which predominantly caters to the local Igbo majority. With Odenigbo as his master, Ugwu discovers books, proper use of English and refined tastes.<br /><br />There are the twin sisters Olanna and Kainene, who are offpsprings of a wealthy Igbo businessman, whose dealings with the government is anything but clean. The sisters, despite of their elitist upbringing, have extremely diverging views of life. That difference is also cemented in how little they resemble each other. Olanna is a radiant, full-figured beauty who is full of ideals and resents her parents' way of life, whereas Kainene, is the tall, thin and dark-skinned sister akin to Olanna's shadow, who, despite of her apathy to her father's dealings, is in charge of continue expanding his business.<br /><br />Their fateful choice of lovers, and subsequently, their individual relationships and relationship towards each other, is what drives the story: Olanna found a lover in Odenigbo and settles in remote Nsukka, while Kainene becomes involved with Richard Churchill, an aspiring British writer who travels the country in search of material and inspiration for his first book. Richard is sent to do his work in Nsukka university, in which he becomes witness to, and later, embroils himself fully in the declaration of an independent Biafra.<br /><br />The setting is complex and the story is intricately layered. The plot twists and turns unexpectedly; surprises lurk in every corner. The storytelling may seem ambitious as it jumps between characters and time periods. Yet Adichie couldn't have done a more brilliant job, her prose is simple and effortless but surprisingly it has not reduced or belittled the intensity and impact of the story.<br /><br />War breaks and make people, and this was very much so the case in the book. Relationships break apart and are mended in such strange ways; people change in ways unrecognizable to their loved ones. Adichie has captured the transformation each characters goes through remarkably well. Even though the characters may seem stereotypical at first (the naive houseboy, the eccentric professor, the beautiful idealist, etc), but their transformations is far from stereotypical. For instance, as it turns out, Olanna, despite living to her revolutionary ideals, misses her life in luxury, and Kainene, despite of her sheltered upbringing, proved herself to be a leader and survivor. Again, without revealing too much, this book also tells what people are capable of committing as well as enduring in times of war, and so many of the plot twists are shocking and heart wrenching.<br /><br />Finally, the simplicity of the prose is striking. In simplest way possible, Adichie captures the intricate details of the conflict, the complex social and political backdrop that British colonialism provided to it and the human sufferings compounded by it. Yet the exotic, African-ness quality has not eluded the storytelling; in fact, it grew stronger with every turn of the page.<br /><br />As a reader and a total stranger to Africa, let alone Nigeria and its rich history, Neither did I find myself buried in new terminologies on ethnicity and culture, nor have I become confused in historical details. Yet when I put down the book I felt as if I had experienced both the ancient land infused with mysticism and the modern postcolonial world, later shredded and charred by war. many of the passages were memorable, the characters will stay long with me after I have put the book down. I can't stress enough how good this book is. Highly recommended.g and heart wrenching.     Finally, the simplicity of the prose is striking.

B0054W4JQK|5.0|Amazing debut! This is one of those books that is hard to put down, it is chilling and harrowing, almost to a breaking point. Yet the story keeps you going, page after page.<br /><br />Christine Lucas suffers a trauma that left her with a terrible predicament. Her brain is not capable of retaining any recently formed memories, she loses all of it when she sleeps. And so each day she wakes up, thinking she is in peak of her youth, when in fact she is middle-aged, married, brain-damaged. Everyday she goes through the same thing, rediscovering her past, understanding her present, making peace with a mixture of guilt, confusion, suspicion, remorse, anger inside. But when she tries to break this endless cycle by keeping a journal that recounts her progress in her memory, it reveals a little more than just the past.<br /><br />The book kicks off with Christine waking up in what she thinks is a strange place. Readers are taken through what she experiences everyday: the terror of finding a strange person sleeping next to her; the inability to cope that she has lost about 20 years of her own life, the mystery shrouding her trauma and the dizziness that comes with the confusion of her middle-aged life.<br /><br />This was cleverly followed with excerpts of Christine's secret journal, which charts all of her recent recollections. The journal allows Christine, and readers, make sense of new incidents and memory flashes and to put the past together piece by piece. But what it also brilliantly does is to make sense of the present piece by piece as new information is revealed with each journal entry. And even though the journal entries are often very long, the story is paced beautifully and none of the narratives seemed long winding or over bearing.<br /><br />And so with each journal entry, the puzzle to the past becomes closer to completion. But Watson was brilliant to leave readers with that feeling that something isn't quite right. And just when you think you've figured out everything, the plot twists and the puzzle you pieced together nicely suddenly falls apart violently. And what a twist it was! The pages were flying from that point on and I literally found myself holding my breath past a few passages.<br /><br />I will stop here before I reveal more of the plot. But my final verdict is: Brilliant and absolutely recommended!d the puzzle you pieced together nicely suddenly falls apart violently. And what a twist it was!

The Plugable USB to RS-232 solved the problem with minimum effort and near minimum cost.  All I had to do was load the driver, check/update the RS-232 parameters and plug in the adapter.  From there it worked like the old setup except that the new laptop running Windows 7 is now my processor.  It couldn't have been easier.
B004SGWYW4|5.0|Imagine if you will...... if the cast from Left 4 Dead was relocated to a Japanese high school and the cast was replaced by a two out-cast males and four buxom hotties. Each character has an interesting back story and dynamic personality. Each character grows throughout the course of the series.  Highschool of the Dead is one of the best series that I've seen so far this year. the series manages a really good balance between Action, Drama and Humor. Those of you who are turned off by excess amounts of fan service may be turned off by the amount of \\"close-ups\\" on the female anatomy. I personally found them hilarious (for example, in one scene when a main character has her mammories used a gun rest for an AK-47).<br /><br />You really feel for the main characters by episode 12. Everyone who enjoys this will probably have a favorite character and at least one character you wish will become zombie chow. Coda-the nerdy basement shut-in Otaku (with Dr. Jekyll/ Mr. Rambo personality) is probably my favorite.<br /><br />The animation is amazing and the action-scenes are very cool. It sucks that it's only 12 episodes. There are rumors about a season 2..... One can only hope.<br /><br />I would recommend this series not just to anime fans. Fans of horror movies and zombie flicks will find it enjoyable as well.

0792833279|5.0|A collector for loan sharks who loves movies discovers that his unique talents are ideally suited to helping him break into the business of movie production.    This is an ideal film for anyone who loves movies in general and crime movies in particular.  John Travolta's Chili Palmer is cold, tough, and intelligent, but what makes him endearing is the way his enthusiasm for movies is always bubbling to the surface.  There is more than one scene in which a tense confrontation effortlessly morphs into a discussion about a mutual love of film, and each time it is essential to moving the plot rather than gratuitous eccentricity.  This film is just packed with great actors sinking their teeth into terrific characters and the result is a delight from start to finish.
B003Y5H54W|2.0|When I saw this movie I did not know it was from the same director who did Twilight.  Actually, I was not fond of the Twilight movie and I am not pleased with this attempt either.  The movie is very slow and nothing exciting really happens.  There are no any edge of your seat moments or any sort of cliffhanger moments.  The movie tries to be a mystery of sorts with the villagers trying to figure out who the werewolf could possibly be.  However, the misdirection at other characters is rather weak and once the wolf speaks you can pretty much guess who it is.  The romance/love triangle is awkward and predictable...A girl betrothed to one boy; yet, in love with another who can offer her no real future. If you want to see this movie I would suggest renting because it is pretty lame, boring and predictable.
B004GCPJDQ|1.0|I purchased this unit because I thought that it's rechargeable battery pack would last longer than the rechargeable batteries I have been using. I had to destroy the box in order to have the instructions in my files. They are written on the box not in a manual. The back of the box is glued to a piece of rubber packaging. I was very careful to insert the battery pack correctly and turn off the mouse before I charged it overnight. The light was a steady green when I turned the mouse on and tried it. My computer could not find it. I turned it off and put it back on the charger. The green light flashed for about 3 hours then went steady. Tried it again and it still did not work.

B000HIVQD0|4.0|Am I the only one who thought The Pretenders were a great singles band, and who only bought their compilations?  That was silly.I was wrong.  I was attracted to THE PRETENDERS re-release after hearing PRETENDERS II in its remastered form. Redone by the folk at RHINO, you know you're in for a treat!  With a second CD containing 15 tracks(B-sides, demos, live) and at a ridiculously low price, there wasn't much of a gamble with this purchase.   The original 12 tracks were a real treat to hear, ranging from the gorgeous \\"Kid\\" through the huge hit \\"Brass In Pocket\\" to out-and-out rockers like \\"Precious\\" and \\"Mystery Achievement\\" and a Kinks cover with \\"Stop Your Sobbing\\". Great sound and marvellous musicianship - a top album I've ignored for 30 years!  The Pretenders were labelled New Wave & even Punk at the time. They were original, blessed with a fresh approach, a terrific singer and fine songwriting.  This re-issue deserves to be heard. A 2CD set, well-packaged, with an extensive booklet.   Grab it and be entertained by THE PRETENDERS.

B001992NUQ|5.0|Fight Club, for me, is the masterpiece of David Fincher. Everything works. Brilliants performances of Norton and Pitt. It's a shame that the movie was almost forgotten by the Academy.    Well, the blu-ray edition: Amazing video and audio quality. (5 stars!)    The edition have some special features. The best, no doubt, is the commentary tracks.    Superb and magnificent!
B002ZG99QS|3.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />In its time, the original 'Tron' was considered in the forefront of special effects cinema. Looking back today and comparing the original with 'Tron: Legacy', one is struck by the overwhelming primitive look of the original. I'm sure if the technology was available back in the early 80s, in terms of special effects, 'Tron: Legacy' is the movie that would have been made. It's not only an homage to the original, but a dazzling dream scape in its own right and the creative effects team should be praised highly for their efforts.<br /><br />That said, without a good story, all the special effects in the world cannot make a decent movie, great. It starts off rather nicely though with the focus on the effect of Kevin Flynn's disappearance on his young son, Sam. The film's scenarists were wise to create an internal arc in which Sam's main motivation is to reunite with his long lost father. We soon discover that Kevin's disappearance in the 80s has affected Sam in a most negative way as an adult. Despite being the controlling shareholder of his Dad's multinational company, ENCOM, Sam spends his time playing a practical jokes on the Board of Directors, such as breaking into company headquarters, hacking into the computer system and briefly posting a new software application on the internet.<br /><br />One notices that the ENCOM break-in scene is much too long as well as the meeting with Alan Bradley, his father's old friend, who informs Sam of a mysterious page (Alan still uses a pager) emanating from the old Flynn arcade which had been shut down for twenty years, Sam discovers his father's laboratory through a hidden passageway inside the arcade and after a few keyboard strokes, Sam is inadvertently transported inside the virtual world of the computer. What's interesting is that this computer world has no interface with today's cyberspace and reflects the computer landscape of the early 1980s.<br /><br />Once Sam is dropped into the virtual world, there are two sensational sequences with Sam battling the minions of CLU, his father's digital clone, who seeks to create a perfect world by subjugating everyone to his will. Sam's first battle involves gladiator-like combat where the combatants throw computer discs at one another and must jump from level to level on a chess-like grid. All the while, a huge crowd is enjoying the carnage. Sam is then brought before CLU, who has the face of the young Jeff Bridges, who appeared in the original Tron. CLU challenges Sam to a life cycle race (on digital motorcycles) and Sam is saved by Quorra, Kevin's assistant, who turns out to be last remaining ISO (Isomorphic Algorithm). The ISOs are sentient beings who somehow are found to contain DNA inside the virtual world. Quorra is played by the lovely Olivia Wilde (who reminds me of a young Kirstie Alley, playing 'Saavik' in the first Star Trek movie).<br /><br />The story slows down a bit when Sam finally reunites over the dinner table with his father who's morphed into a Zen-like Master. There's some dull chatter about each of them having gone to Cal Tech and then a better (and brief flashback) as Kevin explains how CLU wiped out the ISOs. Kevin also explains to Sam about the portal that was opened up when Sam arrived in the virtual world, how that's the only way out and it's going to close real soon. Kevin has this dumb idea that CLU can be defeated by opposing forces within the virtual world but Sam knows better--the only way to defeat CLU is delete the program from the outside and the only way to do that, is get to the portal and get out before it closes.<br /><br />You would think that all-knowing Quorra would then give Sam some good advice on how to get to the portal in the nick of time, but she recommends he look up Zuse, a sleazy David Bowie-like character who ends up betraying Sam, snatching his father's 'disc' (which CLU needs as it works as the master key to the Grid). Of course Dad shows upand saves Sam from CLU's clutches. There's a weak scene after that where Zuse bargains with CLU with no backup, gives up the disc, and is then easily murdered by CLU, when he blows up Zuse's nightclub. Meanwhile, Quorra has one of her arms blown off by CLU's henchmen and fortunately Kevin reprograms her so she can regenerate all her dead tissue.<br /><br />The final climax is a good one where virtual jet fighters are used in a race to the portal. Kevin uses his Zen-like powers to reprogram the original 'Tron' right before he kills Quorra and also uses Zen-like powers to prevent CLU from stopping Sam and Quorra successfully getting through the portal.<br /><br />I'm not sure how Quorra is able to survive outside the virtual world but as stated before, the actor who plays her, Olivia Wilde, is worth the price of admission.<br /><br />While Jeff Bridges does well playing his alter egos, the characters themselves aren't very complex. If you're looking for a story that will massage your brain, you won't find it here. But the special effects are dazzling and are enough to keep you entertained, despite the simplicity of the good versus evil storyline.weak scene after that where Zuse bargains with CLU with no backup, gives up the disc, and is then easily murdered by CLU, when he blows up Zuse's nightclub.

B000VZGK3K|5.0|A lot of people hate this movie. Well, I really like it! Scorsese is a genius and DiCaprio's performance is outstanding.    Amazing video quality, the audio quality is just good. Great special features. (None is in HD)    Recommended!
B004FRX0MY|1.0|I installed this App last night thinking oh neat free MP3 of the day, since its instillation my tablet has been unuseable. I will be needing to send it to the factory to get it running again as the amazon apps crash taking the entire device with it. I will not only not be reinstalling it when my Tablet is repaired I will not be installing any amazon software again.
B004T0XYM8|5.0|The best western in the history, in this edition, has a amazing video quality and fantastic audio.     Leone has the touch. He's a genius. Henry Fonda as a villain is just outstanding. Timeless score by Ennio Morricone.    And for the collector's, this edition comes with a nice slipcover.    Highly recommended!

B004WOS3P4|5.0|I have been a fan of David Cook since he was on AI. I also love his pre-AI music. I couldn't wait til \\"This Loud Morning\\" was released. This cd is a masterpiece from start to finish. There is so much garbage out there that is called music that it was nice to see a singer put blood, sweat and tears into an album. So many singers and bands today record every year and never have substance to their music. David Cook is a genuine singer,songwriter and musician. Not many in the music industry like him exist.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|This book is so many things that it's hard to categorize. Part romance (though with no detailed love scenes), part mystery (though not the whodunit type), part general fiction, all with a paranormal flair, \\"A Discovery of Witches\\" brings together a multitude of genres into one cohesive and engaging novel.  Diana Bishop is a witch and a historian who denies her magical background. Matthew de Clairmont is a centuries old vampire. Witches and vampires don't mix and they certainly don't fall in love. At least, that is what everyone has always been told by the Congregation, a group of witches, vampires and daemons that monitor the behavior of \\"creatures\\". After accidentally stumbling on a bewitched manuscript while doing research, Diana meets Matthew.  Their lives come together and are forever changed, not just by each other, but by those who love them and by those who would do anything to get ahold of Diana, her power and the ancient manuscript.    This is book one in a trilogy. The other 2 books are not yet available, so if you don't like having to wait for the next installment, you might want to hold off on reading this book. While it does not have a cliffhanger ending, per se, the book does not resolve the story, which will (I'm assuming) pick up in book 2 where it left off in book 1.    I really liked the characters, not just the main ones but the secondary characters, as well. They are three-dimensional and not flat like in some books. The story is at times exciting but it's not a \\"roller coaster ride\\". There's a lot of character backstory given which helps pace the book. However, at times Ms. Harkness can get a bit long-winded. While I enjoy vivid descriptions, I don't necessarily need quite so many descriptions of the wine they are drinking (for example). I think the book could have been shortened at least a little by removing some of the descriptive sections, but that might just be me.    All in all, I really enjoyed this book and I look forward to the next bookin this trilogy.
B000T9OP7G|4.0|First point I want to make about this show is THOMAS DEKKER IS TOTALLY MISCAST AS JOHN CONNER! Never in the whole show at ANY point did he show ANY star power or any charisma that would convince you in ANY way that he is the legendary resistance leader John Conner! He is absolutely in EVERY way an average JOE SHMUCK that you would find in ANY high school! This fact is GLARINGLY apparant throughout the whole show and SERIOUSLY drags its credibility down! In fact go and google \\"Thomas Dekker is gay\\" and it will only confirm your suspicions that sharp viewers will pickup during the show.    Now with that out of the way, Lena Headey does quite a admirable job as Sarah Conner. She exhibits grit and toughness despite her distractingly stunning super model good looks. Lena along with Summer Glau as a terminator truly carries the show. Serenity movie fans will definitely appreciate Summer Glau with her eccentric style and odd stare as well suited for the role of a terminator. The special effects in Season 1 are top notch and the story is riveting. Season 2 seems to run out of steam slightly and drifts somewhat.   Any fan of the movie Terminator series will enjoy this series as well.
0316056863|5.0|I listened to this as a audiobook as I commute, and laughed out loud...surprised I did not have an accident!  This book reminds why I am a fan of Tina Feys and why I admire her. It is her life story with humor and pearls of wisdom mixed in.<br />She is a big girl in a man's world and a very sucessful one.  Her stories of growing up, her early career, SNL, and 90 rock are priceless. Her honestly with trying to balance motherhood, marriage and career will endear her to every working mother.<br />Highly recommend!Funny, funny stuff :)

B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Kept hearing that they were going to make a movie out of these books so I decided to give it a go on the Kindle.  I tore through all 3 books in rapid fashion.  Sure, they were marketed to the teen set; but still a good read for a 30-something bloke like myself.  A mix of sci-fi action, love triangle, and commentary on war and terrorism.  The pace is fast and action packed which makes it tough to put down.  It seems like every chapter ended with a cliff hanger.    I definitely recommend picking this up.  Will definitely be interested to see how this translates to the big screen.

B004RSCWZ2|1.0|At her best, Susan Tedeshi sounds like Bonnie Raitt reincarnated.  But most often she sounds like a lame imitator of Raitt, close in voice and style but never really achieving Raitt's genuine soul and passion.  Sometimes even a poor imitation of Raitt is very good music but this disc only showcases Tedeshi's deficits.  Her singing doesn't soar or grab, it grates.  Same for the guitars.  Most of the songs are harsh and irritating.  Good music makes you stop and listen regardless of what you are doing.  The songs on this disc make you race to the stop button. The group sounds like a commercial joining of big names that fulfilled a contract without any regard for how well the musicians worked together, which unfortunately they do not.

B004XD03RK|5.0|Human has been my favorite Death album for a long time.  In a way, it's like a Reign in Blood of death or technical death metal.  It was the album that had the production, the songs, the seriousness, and the professionalism to show how much could be accomplished in extreme metal.  The new remaster sounds absolutely incredible.  You generally want louder and clearer with this sort of release, and you get both on Disc One, plus God of Thunder thrown in as a bonus.  Disc Two features the instrumental tracks for the whole album, something I enjoy listening to almost as much as the regular version.  It's definitely a different experience without the vocals.  You also get seven demo tracks from Human, for a total of twenty songs.  The booklet will interest most Death fans, with tons of old photos and a few pages of notes from Paul Masvidal.  The slipcase with the embossed Death logo is pretty sweet, too.  I'm very satisfied with this re-release.  As a longtime fan, the extras make it worth buying, and the improved sound just makes it that much better.

1594744769|5.0|\\"There's no time,\\" he whispered.  Then he raised his head off the ground, trembling with the effort, and breathed into my ear: \\"Find the bird.  In the loop.  On the other side of the old man's grave.  September third, 1940.\\"  I nodded, but he could see that I didn't understand.  With his last bit of strength, he added, \\"Emerson - the letter.  Tell them what happened, Yakob.\\" (p. 33)    I decided I wanted to read Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children after reading the book review written by Entertainment Weekly magazine, which described the basic plot, printed several of the photos from the book, and gave it a B+.  However, I was still unsure what this book might be about, exactly.  Once I read the passage on page 33 quoted above, I knew I would be reading a journey with mysteries that would unfold to explain Jacob's grandfather's dying words and enough foreshadowing to propel me forward.       I feel that a book of this nature is difficult to categorize.  The photos scattered throughout the novel, which are real vintage photos from various collectors that have been mostly unaltered, make this book captivating.  The story itself is addicting and difficult to put down.  This book is the first of what has to become a series, and Twentieth Century Fox will be making it into a movie (according to Entertainment Magazine).  I need to send a message to the author - I don't know if I can wait for the next installment!  I am now his biggest fan!     As a teacher, I am always looking for something that my high school students (reluctant readers, each and every one of them), will buy into.  I think this is it!  I'm excited to share it with them!  And if you, reader of reviews, are contemplating reading this novel - do it!  You won't regret it!
B0034JKZ86|5.0|This movie is such a classic, I can watch over and over again. A fairy tale set in Jazz Age-era New Orleans and centered on a young girl named Tiana and her fateful kiss with a frog prince who desperately wants to be human again.

B003UAKE9Y|4.0|While the plot might not be totally original, this movie is very fun to watch. I would follow the PG rating and not let little kids watch it, it can seem scary to them. My niece, who is five, said that it was too scary so we decided to watch something else at the time. I re-watched it after she left, and I really liked it.

B004EPYZP8|4.0|Matthew McConaughey is a talented actor who has spent the last ten years making forgettable romantic-comedies that stunt his ability to show his range. While The Lincoln Lawyer does not have him stepping into Oscar-worthy territory, it's a role that renews faith in his ability as an actor. Additionally, it's a solid film with a tremendous supporting cast and confident direction from relative newcomer Brad Furman (whose IMDB picture, with his Good Charlotte T-shirt and sideways hat, would not lead you to believe he was capable of making a coherent film).    McConaughey plays Mick Haller, a smooth-talking Los Angeles defense attorney who operates out of the backseat of his Lincoln Town Car, defending garden-variety criminals who can pay the right price. Mick is very good at his job and clearly fond of the luxuries it affords. When his driver, Earl, asks him if he can keep the job after Mick gets his license back, Mick replies \\"I got my license back three months ago, Earl.\\" Out of the blue, a bail bondsman named Val (John Leguizamo) approaches Mick with an offer to defend a high-profile client; Louis Roulet (Ryan Phillippe), the son of a wealthy real estate mogul, has been accused of brutally assaulting a prostitute. Louis vehemently professes his innocence and, although he is suspicious, Mick takes the job. Along with Frank Levin (William H. Macy), his investigator, Mick begins analyzing the evidence to build his case and finds discrepancies that only make his suspicions stronger...    The Lincoln Lawyer starts with a strong script, no doubt adapted from a strong book. I am not familiar with the author of the novel, Michael Connelly, but the last film adapted from one of his books was the 2002 Clint Eastwood thriller Blood Work, which was well-received. Two solid films out of two ain't bad; I think it's a safe bet that he's got talent. The script follows the formula of including a twist at every opportunity and this twisty plot keeps the film surprising and interesting. There are elements that require you to suspend your disbelief a bit (nothing too extraordinary, just too convenient) and it does get contrived at times, but it's much smarter and fun than the average Hollywood legal thriller. There are really two types of films here, the first hour being a mystery while the second being a legal thriller. I was a bit taken aback when they spill the beans only an hour in, but found the courtroom drama just as engrossing as what came before it. The mystery element is effectively intriguing, while the courtroom stuff is well-played, with intensity and snappy dialogue.    It's been a long time since McConaughey was in such fine form. This is a role with real bite and he reminds us that he's a movie star with genuine acting ability. Mick Haller is a suave, charismatic, arrogant, crafty, and manipulative character that McConaughey really sinks his teeth into. As an actor, he naturally exudes charisma and he takes to this character in the same natural way a Jazz musician takes to their instrument. Marissa Tomei as the L.A. prosecutor, and Mick's ex-wife, has a natural chemistry with McConaughey and a likeability and natural warmth that brightens up a film just by having her walk on-screen. Macy doesn't have much screen-time, but has the unique ability as an actor to bring a distinct quirkiness to his role and effectively steal all of his scenes. As the comic relief of sorts, he does just that here. The stunning supporting cast is not short on big names and big talent, consisting of Josh Lucas, Frances Fisher, Michael Peña, Bryan Cranston, and Trace Adkins (!?).    The Lincoln Lawyer is consistently entertaining and suspenseful while it moves at a brisk, clever pace. It has structural similarities to recent films (one that comes immediately to mind is 2007's Fracture), but what it lacks in freshness it makes up for in execution. This is not a film that tries to reinvent the wheel, but merely keep its audience entertained while they watchthe wheel spin. It's well-acted and addictive. It's nice to see a film that that aspires only to entertain, but doesn't disregard intelligence completely in doing so. It's not a great film, but it's great entertainment.    GRADE: B

B0025VLELQ|3.0|I remember watching this movie as a kid in the 80's.  It's a classic film with some very bad graphics...lol. Trailer park, video game, aliens, invading armada, space battle. Basically sums up the whole movie. If you love corny 80's classics then pick it up.
B004ULEEY8|5.0|After a disappointing earlier \\"alien invasion\\" movie called \\"Skyline\\" (which was not good at all), I thought this would be another one in the alien flavor of the summer variety.  Imagine my surprise when it was a guts for glory, hell yeh we can, do or die Marines versus the spongy, slimey aliens.  To me, the best movie is the one I don't have to examine for a social agenda or a psychological thriller that leaves one searching for the DSM-IV diagnosis. I enjoyed this movie because it didn't scare me to death, but it got my patriotic heart going pitty-pat.  Aaron Eckhart was terrific as the old hard charging war horse Marine. Great editing and special effects....way to go Raleigh Studios, Baton Rouge.  I watched it 4-5 times already.  A good movie is one you never tire of......in fact, now that I think about it......Gone with the Wind with Atlanta burning was as exciting!
B004ZZITEU|4.0|Like many fans, I was not sure what to think when I listened to 'Too Extreme,' the second track on Morbid Angel's new album, Illud Divinum Insanus. 'Too Extreme!' sounds like 80% Rammstein, 20% Soulfly, and 0% Morbid Angel. I listened to the whole song hoping that it would get better, but the programmed drums and industrial beat of 'Too Extreme!' is maintained throughout, and I was worried that the Morbid Angel I love was gone for good. Luckily, track 3, 'Existo Vulgore' is death metal the way Morbid Angel does death metal. The remainder of the album is about 75% traditional Morbid Angel while about 25% is a misguided musical experiment remniscent of 'Too Extreme.' If you are a Morbid Angel fan, or just a fan of death metal, I recommend Illud Divinum Insanus with a caveat: it's not all death metal. Most of the album is what you would expect but there are a few tracks I will be skipping every time and you may want to do the same. In the end, I'm just glad the boys are back together and making music.

She particularly loves the cows, the crocodile, and she constantly wants to watch \\"Let's give kitty a bath.\\"  She is two and we are very selective about tv time for her, but this is great!

B001FB4VXU|3.0|1 out of the 4 cds I ordered was damaged. I ordered season 2 of the big bang theory and was disappointed to discover that the 2nd disc of the season did not work at all. I know that the cds have been used, but for one not to work at all seems weird.
1594744769|4.0|I am going to start my little review with the one aspect of this gem of a book that I disliked: it becomes apparent towards the end that it is \\"part one\\" of a series. This might not be a negative for some folks, but I am rather tired of the trend that YA books MUST be serialized. One of these days I would really like a great, thrilling, stand-alone YA story.<br /><br />Okay, enough of that grumpiness.<br /><br />So, Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children. I liked it a lot. It has a stunningly lovely cover. I liked the integration of creepy old photos with the story, and I thought the tale was great fun, spooky and imaginative. The action bogged down a bit in the middle of the book, but there is very welcome and scary jolt around chapter nine that sets the story apace again. Most of the characters are interesting and curious(peculiar!), although the protagonist, Jacob, is not really one of them. The conceit of a hidden time-loop world, extraordinary and ageless children, shape-shifting bird/governesses, and ghastly wights and horrid hallowgasts make for a thrilling adventure. As noted, the story slogs a bit in the middle, but there are enough twists, chases, and creepy revelations towards the end to save it. I will seek out the next installment because I want to find out how the kids and the Bird fare in their quest, but gosh I sure do wish that it had simply been a bigger book with tighter storytelling. That said--I highly recommend Miss Peregrine and her fabulous wards as a great read and even better leaping off point for a day's musings. It's a story that stays with you even after you shut the book.<br /><br />Be sure to check out the author's website---- for some great videos and news about his upcoming photo collection book called Talking Pictures.
0670022411|5.0|I read MANY reviews of this book prior to purchasing it, and was a bit surprised by the percentages of those who liked it vs. those who did not.  First-time authors are sometimes overly criticized (clarification: Ms. Harkness is actually NOT a brand-new author, having written several books on factual historical topics--however, this is her first foray into \\"semi-fiction\\"); having said that, in my opinion, I think A Discovery of Witches will prove to many people that Ms. Harkness is a truly gifted writer who has a very bright future in the world of fiction.    Having finished A Discovery of Witches yesterday, I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed this book and would highly recommend it to others, with a few CAVEATs:  First, some of the scientific terminology and many of the historical references are not \\"common-knowledge\\" (after all, how many people the world over are experts on alchemical manuscripts?!?), and proved to be a bit difficult to follow at times.  Sometimes a passage made more sense after re-reading it (and I re-read several entire chapters to be sure my understanding was clear).  As a reader who likes to be enlightened as well as entertained, this book was right up my alley; however, for those seeking pure literary enjoyment/escapism, this book might prove to be a poor choice (one has to REALLY pay attention to every action, reaction, and subtle nuance).       Second, for those readers who may be drawn to this book because the main characters are vampires, witches, and daemons, be forewarned:  this is NOT a Twilight-esque romp through Forks.  The main characters (Diana, Matthew, Sarah, Emily, Ysebeau, Marthe) are MUCH older than the pseudo-teens of Twilight, and as such, are well educated, more grounded in their families and careers, and possess A LOT more life experience.  Also, most of the characters exhibit many normal human behaviors, in addition to their other-worldly ones, thus making them more believable.  If you enjoy the accurate, detailed descriptions of real people and real places, during various seasons and centuries, you will not be disappointed--England, France, upstate New York, and the \\"mystery destination\\" of the final chapter are each presented with painstaking yet wonderful detail.       Last, if you're expecting a \\"happily-ever-after\\" final scene, you WILL be EXTREMELY disappointed.  I understand that Ms. Harkness was intentional in designing A Discovery of Witches to be the FIRST of a THREE-PART SERIES, so when you get to the end, you WILL want to read the sequel, because there are just too many story threads which remain loose and untied.    In my opinion, a great effort by a first-time fiction writer, and highly recommended.
B001F6TXME|5.0|This is real simple plug it in the accesory port set your Nikon's shutter SHOOT!  It works great must have goody.  The cord is a good length not too long not too short.  Bottom line buy it worth the money.    Mike
B0050CQY1W|5.0|Let me start by saying I don't love ballads, but this album made me change my mind. Beyonc&eacute; gives her special twist to what could've been boring Mariah ballads, and turned them into a marvelous group of amazing songs influence by different styles. Some songs feel tropical, others feel like they are from ancient african tribes, and others simply feel as if they were ment to be released in the 80's. Her combination of different styles really worked out. I get that people were expecting a little more \\"Sasha Fierce\\" in the record, but B said she no longer needed Sasha to be confident about her art. And I agree, all the negative comments come from people that aren't used to change and can't accept that artists grow and change between projects. This album shows extreme maturity in her voice and her life. She sings about more mature songs because her fans have grown and she has to make sure that her songs are relateable. Buy the deluxe edition from Target, it is worth it.<br /><br />Favorite songs:<br />-Best Thing I Never Had<br />-Love On Top<br />-Countdown<br />-End Of Time
0439023521|5.0|Yes, this book is gruesome and sometimes disturbing.  Still a great read -- my 14 y/o nephew and I burned through the series in a week.
0545123275|5.0|I don't have a lengthy review...Just wanted to say as a writer and lover of romance, this was a great book! The second is wonderful as well and I can't wait to get the third book in. It flows wonderfully, and everything is described in great detail, which I love. The whole \\"golden eyes\\" thing gets to me just because I'm also a twilight fan and you know... his eyes were a big thing so it seemed mundane but it's all good. Still loved it!
0345529057|5.0|It seems like half the reviews here are about the Kindle version or printing flaws in the paperback copies. Therefore, the overall 3-star rating is not accurate. As you can see from the reviews of each book individually, the story gets 4/5 stars.<br /><br />I watched the HBO Game of Thrones series, so once the first season ended I had to pick up a copy of the books. I received the books yesterday and started reading immediately. I'm about 50 pages into the first book and I'm amazed at how accurate the TV show was. As I was reading, I could literally see each scene from the show. I think it helped watching the TV show first since it gave me an image of what each character looks like. For someone who reads to books first, it could be easy to get lost or confused since there are so many POV and characters.<br /><br />Several other reviewers have compared this story to Lord of the Rings, but I honestly think that they are non-comparable. Both stories are epic, but Game of Thrones is much more interesting and complex. It's not just a story about \\"good vs. bad\\" as character personalities and ambitions change throughout the series. It's also interesting how some of the characters are from different lands and don't even come into contact with others. I can't wait to read the rest of the books to see how everything plays out in the end. Hopefully the author will write the last two books soon!<br /><br />Now, about the quality of the paperback edition... I decided on this box set since it was only $20. A great deals since it comes out to $5 a book. They are mass market paperbacks, so they are on the small size, but the font is average compared to other books that size. The pages are thin, but not too thin. If they used thicker paper then each book would be about 5 inches wide since they are about 1,000 pages long. After reading some of the reviews of people having issues with the paperbacks (missing or misplaced pages, font being smeared, etc.) I was worried about buying these copies. When mine arrived, I checked it immediately and it's in perfect condition. I can only guess that there was a publishing/printing error with a specific batch of books.ved, I checked it immediately and it's in perfect condition.

B004VUP8WK|1.0|Wow. I'm truly stunned by this disc. What's really unfortunate is that there are a few decent tracks mixed in here, but they just get overshadowed by how unbelievably terrible the bad tracks are.<br /><br />It seems like someone in the band got heavily into KMFDM over the last few years and decided to inexpertly mimic their sound on a few tracks and call it experimentation. So we get 'Too Extreme!' 'I Am Morbid' and the absolutely ridiculous 'Radikult' as three of the truly worst tracks to ever grace a metal disc.<br /><br />The thing is I really enjoy bands like KMFDM, but if you're going to go for that sound you need to do it well. This, is just not good, not in any way.<br /><br />The more traditional death metal tracks here vary from good enough(Nevermore)to kinda boring but passable (Blades for Baal), yet none of them are interesting enough to rise above the truly awful, and I do mean awful, trash on here.<br /><br />After this sad effort, I think in may be time for MA to call it a day.
B000BFNAYC|3.0|I purchased this simply because I just can't afford a real blast cabinet & the portable sand/soda blasters are sooo messy. The whole idea with sand blasting with a pressure washer does work however this configuration is a little weak. I have the newer X series 5.74 (i think) pressure washer @ 2000 psi. It could stand to be another 1000psi before you could take off primer, paint, powder coat in a single pass where as it is right now I have to pass over several times to get everything off. 3 stars is because it works real well for what it is.
B004A8ZX28|5.0|Liam Neeson proves his success as an action hero in TAKEN was no fluke.  UNKNOWN is a tense, suspenseful film fueled by Neeson's performance.<br />Neeson plays a doctor visiting Berlin for a high-tech conference with his beautiful wife (January Jones).  When he checks into the hotel, he discovers he left his briefcase at the airport.  He takes a cab driven by Diane Kruger, gets into a freak accident and wakes up in the hospital after a 4 day coma.  Upon returning to rejoin his wife, she claims she doesn't know him and her husband is Aiden Quinn.<br />From this point, Neeson is whirled into a vertox of proving just who he is.  He convinces Kruger and a retired German soldier (Bruno Ganz) to help him determine what's going on.<br />Although it's fairly obvious what's occurring, the script throws in enough twists to make the whole journey a wild ride.<br />The director maintains both a kinetic energy replete with a great car chase and dramatic breaks giving us more insight into the characters.  There's a brief but chilling scene between Ganz and Frank Langella that's superb in its simplicity.<br />I loved the relationship between Neeson and Kruger.  You can't help but root for these two as they bring down the villains.  I personally enjoyed UNKNOWN a little better than TAKEN but they are both great films.<br />UNKNOWN is an intelligent well-executed thriller with a top-notch cast.  I highly recommend it!
B004XWMXX8|5.0|Let me just start by saying this...I'm a 23 year old male and I absolutely LOVE 'Wizards of Waverly Place'. I was pretty upset when Selena announced that this was the very last season for the show, and in April it was confirmed that there will be no 'Sequel' to the movie as planned. I met Selena Gomez TWICE (at the King of Prussia Mall = 6/20 and NBC 10! = 6/21) and she's just a down to Earth gal who is humble about where she comes from and is very loving to her fans ALL OVER!     Now, let's go on to the music.    I bought the album 'When The Sun Goes Down' at Target because I heard it had 4 bonus tracks and I have to say this album is pure brilliance! The images inside of the booklet takes me back to the '50's, '60's, and '70's!    Track List:  1.) Love You Like A Love Song - 10/10. She sounds like she's singing to Justin Bieber in this song. I saw the video and it was a very fun, cute video. The lyrics make you want to sing this at Karaoke and dedicate it to your boyfriend/girlfriend or best friend!    2.)Bang Bang Bang - 10/10. The lyrics are sort of like a \\"Look what I have and look at what you WISH you had\\". It talks about an ex who had done her wrong (Nick Jonas? Taylor Lautner?) and she's stealing back her love from him. All in all, everyone should use this as \\"revenge song\\" for an ex.    3.) Who Says - 10/10. Probably one of the rawest songs on this album. This song is so inspirational (I have the Spanish part as my text signature \\"*Dices, que soy imperfecta*\\") it makes me want to cry. Yes, I cried when I first heard this song. It really speaks the truth. Everyone is beautiful inside and out and this song belongs with the top 5 inspirational songs next to Ke$ha's We R Who We R, Lady GaGa's Born This Way, Cyndi Lauper's True Colors, and Britney Spears' I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman. Brilliant!    4.) We Own The Night - featuring Pixie Lott - 9/10. I personally like this song, but I think Pixie Lott shouldn't have been in the background despite her being co-writer. No offense to Pixie Lott fans (I never heard of her, and please don't say I'm bashing her), but her vocals isn't strong enough for this song. That is why I gave this a 9 out of 10. All in all, I loved the lyrics.    5.) Hit The Lights - 10/10. Very, very strong vocals here. This makes me wish I heard this in clubs sooner. It talks about going for your dreams and not being scared. Put the big girl/boy pants on and just GO!!    6.) Whiplash - 10/10. LOVE this song! I love the beat, and the cute 'Lickety split/A girl in a bit as she falls in a pit/Saying \\"Hello, darling\\"' part. This song was co-written by Britney Spears, which was a HUGE plus for me. It makes me wonder, despite Britney being on her own tour, will she join Selena on her 'WE OWN THE NIGHT TOUR'? Hmmm possibilities...    7.) When The Sun Goes Down - 10/10. This song is a feel good song. It makes me want to dance in the car with my best friend...which I do. I love the fact that she expresses her passion through the song and she's normal like anyone else! She goes to the clubs and dances...Simple!    8.) My Dilemma - 10/10. I love how she pours her emotion into this song. And I'm sure every girl can relate to this song. It's one of those songs that make you sit down and think REALLY hard...not too hard, ladies... But just sit down and really listen to this song. It WILL make you go \\"What?! OMG! That's SOOO me!!!\\" I should know...My sister did it. -.-    9.) That's More Like It - 10/10. Co-written by the great Katy Perry (Who wrote last's years 'Rock God' for 'A Year Without Rain')! This song makes Selena seem \\"bossy\\" and makes her out to be the champion against a guy who doesn't do things for her like make her dinner and serve it to her. This song is a great way to get your man to WISE UP!    10.) Outlaw - 10/10. This song gave me goosebumps when she sang the \\"Outlaw\\" part. The best part is when she mentioned where she came from \\"I'm from the Lone Star state and I'm ready to bring you in\\". That breakdown part with those lyrics are kind of foot-stomping a little. It's really addictive. In a way, it's heartbreaking because some guys are ACTUALLY that way. They leave you when you want to commit. And it can be scary.    11.) Middle Of Nowhere - 10/10. This song is probably the BEST song on the album! She really shows off her vocals here!! The sort of shouts the song and it's about trying to pick up the pieces after the person you love left you. I can totally relate to this song from a personal experience. I love the drum action in here. It's really catchy and you will have it on repeat for a while. This really brings out her \\"Diva\\" side!!!    12.) Dices (Who Says - Spanish Version) - 10/10. (Please see my review for 'Who Says')    Target Exclusive Version:  13.) Fantasma De Amor (Ghost Of You - Spanish Version) - 10/10. For those who have NOT heard the song 'Ghost Of You', it's track number eight off of last years 'A Year Without Rain' with some added vocals in the chorus that was NEVER in the English version of the song. It's about leaving a love, but their memory remains with you and it sounds even beautiful in Spanish. This is one of my favorites off of 'A Year Without Rain', actually. Love.    14.) A Year Without Rain (David Aude Radio Remix) - 10/10. I'm not one for remixes, but I personally LOVE David Aude's remix on this song. It's very club and techno sort of. It's a very fun remix!    15.) Who Says (Bimbo Jones Radio Remix) 6/10. Personally, this remix isn't my favorite. The 'Na na na na' part is slowed...It's fun, but didn't do much for me. But to each his/her own!    16.) Who Says (David Aude Radio Remix) 10/10. This is my favorite 'Who Says' remix EVER! David Aude kept parts of the original guitar elements with a club feel! I can see myself dancing to this in a club and some strobe lights going off. Personally, BEST remix.    Also, be aware that if you do get the Target edition, the CD cover is slightly altered. The picture is posted below:    [...]All in all, this album get's a 10/10! This a MUST have for ALL Selena Gomez & The Scene fans!!

B004V2S4SS|5.0|This is the type of show you literally put your life on hold to watch. It brings so much to the viewer! Mystery, humor, real life, and always an unexpected twist. Medium is by far one of my most favorite TV shows. I will definitely be watching the entire series all over again...it's just that good! Never a boring moment. Always pulls you in, whether it's the first time you see it or the 4th.
0143119419|4.0|I really enjoyed this book and found it to be very good at distilling many of the different hedge fund strategies commonly used.   A very interesting history of the industry and recommended to anyone interested in finance.    My only complaint is the author's attempt to move from storytelling into policy prescription, not so much because I begrudge him his opinion but because I believe those prescriptions are woefully naive.    First, it is not at all clear that some funds are too interconnected to fail.   Had the government not arranged a rescue (albeit with private capital from large banks who, had they been smaller, may not have had the reserves to do o without government help) of LTCMS there is a good possibility the counter party risk could have taken down regulated banks.    Bthe bigger flaw is that, iIronically, the author falls into the same trap as several of his earlier chapters' protagonists.   He reasons that because individual hedge funds are small enough to fail, government should encourage mire financial activity within this structure and not within \\"too big to fail\\" banks.   There are several issues with this beyond fees.  The biggest is that hedge fund failures are not isolated incidents.  Earlier in the book, he noted LTCMs incorrect assumption that it's trades are uncorrelated only to find them correlated in a time of crisis.  Likewise, the author tells the story of a \\"quant quake\\" when trouble at one quant fund spreads quickly to others as each is forced to rapidly del ever.  The quake ends only when a too big to fail institution, Goldman, recapitalizes one of it's funds with billions in additional equity.     A market full of correlated small-enough-to-fail funds is no safer than if those correlated-at-times-of-crisis funds were merged.
0439023521|5.0|Ok, so I have the hardcover version of this.  I am not normally a sci-fi or fantasy fan, but I absolutely LOVED this book.  I almost could not put it down!!!  I read a ton, and this kept me interested the entire time.  I'm not sure what else to say except if you buy this book you will like it!!  Unless you are a bore that is. LOL ..  Great book!
B0056BMK6K|4.0|A very easy to read, easy to follow little book. It makes a lot of sense. It's turned the light on for me, now I just have to put it into action, that's always the hard part. Thanks for sharing John.
0596805888|4.0|I got this as a gift and didnt know what to think when I first received it.  I Read this and a few  other books called cook master series. If you or someone wants to get deeper and really understand how things work in the food world, these types of books are enlightening. It also makes a great gift for someone that is passionate about cooking. I'm totally ADD on reading and I actually can read this book because it's divided into highly potent small pieces. The interviews with industry people are a real eye opener. This is a must have book since its more about teaching you the essentials.
0385504225|2.0|I enjoyed angels and demons and I like the Da Vinci code, but after picking this book up I was very disappointed.  The story just isn't very compelling.  It dragged on and on, I had to force myself to try and finish it.  Towards the end I simply started skipping whole sections because it turned out to be more of a lecture about spiritual mysticism.  Spare me please!  I get enough mystical nonsense from street preachers.     I would not recommend buying this book.  It's boring nonsense. I wish I had bought a magazine instead.
1400079144|3.0|The Lost Symbol is the latest Dan Brown book.  It is an important book by a great author, with some interesting science and characters and some plot lines that seem lost.  I dont know how to compare it to the other Brown books.  We have the same protagonist who seems to do some really dumb things for a smart guy. The other characters are all new, which is remarkable that Langdon has all these close friends and life long mentors who did not show up in the previous thousand pages. Reminds me of Rockford Files episodes where each week Jim's long lost cousin or childhood best friend shows up for the first time in a real jam that only Jim and Rocky can resolve.     The science that is going on at the Smithsonian is a dreadful bore compared to the fast paced DC action. What is noetics anyway, it has nothing to do with this story.  As is his way, Langdon races from corner to corner in the featured city, finding clues and getting the answer right at least 50% of the time. There are some incredible surprises in this book that I wont reveal.  No one is who they seem to be and it is not even clear who is quick or dead.    Brown does not write especially well, although he writes a lot better now than he did 10 years ago. This book could use some serious editing. Who are all these people and how are they relevant? We spend a lot of time with directions and details of getting from here to there. In any case make sure you read this.  You cant miss any of these, will be a blockbuster film real soon.
B0044RFT8S|1.0|I did receive the dvds but madagascar had 2 regular dvd´s inside, the bluray was replaced with another regular one
B00127RAJY|5.0|I workout and consider myself pretty fit. I do this DVD on mornings I don't have a lot of time or on days I can't get to the gym. At the end, I'm sweating! It gets my heart rate up and going and its a challenging workout. I've done all Levels now. In a way, I think Level 2 seems a little harder than Level 3 so don't be afraid to try Level 3 if you're still thinking Level 2 is hard.    The entire program runs around 23-25 minutes because it includes the warm up and cool down so don't think you're gonna pop it in, watch the clock and at exactly 20 minutes you're done - stick with it! Even when Jillian says \\"You don't get to workout for 20 minutes and take a break\\" and in your head you're thinking...\\"Ugh, this is really 23-25 min (depending on Level) so can't I just have a small break?\\" - LOL    I started with 2 lb weights and thought Level 1 was still a challenge. Now I exclusively use 3 and 5 lb and for the one arm raises I use 12 lbs (that's in Level 3)    I haven't logged in to try her diet plan but I intend to.    I'd highly recommend this DVD. I've even given it as a gift and have one of my best friend's doing it from her house with me and we check in together!     FANTASTIC Value!! I'm super impressed!
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I really loved this book. Jamie McGuire has got talent to really make you feel for her characters even if you sometimes want to smack them for their choices. I wouldn't recommend this book for younger teens though, to me the subject matter in parts is very adult,  not something I'd want my teenage daughter reading about just yet! However if you are a nearly out of high school teen and above this is a great read! If you haven't read the author's Providence series yet you are missing out!
B003F3NE1Q|5.0|Astounding.   The best television has to offer, no exaggeration. I was ready to give up on Grey's Anatomy. Then I bought this on sale at Walmart and I couldn't stop watching it.   This season had George's death, the hospital merger with Mercy West, and of course, the many relationships around Seattle Grace. I found the idea of the merger to add a new twist to the show. A lot of the character's true colors started showing. And the new characters introduced this season, while the \\"enemies\\", were likable.   Overall, I completely recommend this season even if you aren't a fan of Grey's Anatomy.
B004UHPTZ0|4.0|WARNING: For fans of Adrian Belew and the 80's and 90's Crimson sound.  do yourself a favor and sidestep this album.    For those who have followed King Crimson from the beginning  and Robert Fripps solo career, this project will come across  as a natural progression if not a gutsy one.    I for one welcome the change. This is a side of Crimson rarely  heard and harks back to the more suttle softer passages of there  earlier albums.    So sitback relax and enjoy the softer side of King Crimson. - EC
0307477479|1.0|I read this book because of the critic's reviews and its award winning status. I asked myself the following questions after reading it: 1) Why would an author waste 40 pages on PowerPoint slides that have little bearing on plot or character development? 2) What did I gain from reading this book? 3) Why was it awarded such a high honor?    The answers are as follows: 1) The author didn't have much to say. 2) I gained the knowledge that critics and reviews can sometimes err. 3) I don't know.    If I were you, I certainly wouldn't waste my time with \\"A visit from the Goon Squad.\\"
0762434260|1.0|I wish I had looked here before I bought this--I was wandering around a bookstore, and saw it and immediately had to have it--let this be a lesson about impulse buying!<br /><br />Nothing wrong with the idea of a wand that comes in four parts and screws together, this might come in handy.  I got it home, tried to put it together, and had a hard time with the base, because the screw threading, which is part of the plastic piece and not actual metal screw (which might have made it a more quality product) was really not fitting well.<br /><br />I finally got the threads tracking properly, and it was still hard to screw together because it was so tight.  When I got to the end where the wand met the base, it got very hard to screw together.  As soon as I got the base and the wand actually touching, it broke.<br /><br />I exchanged it for another, and managed to get this one together ok, but on this one, the last piece on the end wasn't molded straight or whatever, so now the end of my wand looks like a slightly crooked finger.<br /><br />I may try using the base to create my own wand.  I think that this would have benefited from using actual metal screws and screw casings, like I've seen in other cylindrical tools that have to be screwed together.  I know this is a toy not a tool, but Running Press could have easily sprung for the metal parts and made this worth the nine bucks I paid for it.
B003KATMYC|3.0|In this episode, the Doctor is called by the famous Winston Churchill from World War Two to help him fight the Battle of Britain. The Doctor didn't know that the Daleks, an enemy of the Doctor, is there trying to control the Earth by being friends with the British.    I'm unconvinced with the plot of this story. The Daleks becoming friends with Winston Churchill is hard to believe because there wasn't a convincing reason for the audience to believe this can happen. I'm a firm believer that if you can give a good reason for the audience to believe in something they will but the screenwriters didn't give one. What really turned me off is to see a world war two fighter plane fly from Earth to outerspace to save the Doctor using its machine guns to destroy the Dalek's spaceship.    Everyone knows the history of World War Two and Winston Churchill so the screenwriters have to give a good reason for the audience to beleive that aliens from outerspace has invaded the Earth. They didn't do it. Don't get me wrong. I love Dr Who but this episode wasn't the screenwriter's best story. Matt Smith and Karen Gillan tried their best to make it work but, at least for me, I didn't like it.
0205632645|5.0|Love the hard cover style of the book.  Some people have complained about the pages being to thin?  I thought the paper quality was fine and couldnt really figure out what these people were talking about.  Content is great, easy to follow and use good examples.  Definately recommend.
B004WOS7LO|5.0|I am so impressed with this record. Such craftsmanship. Start the musical journey into the depth of Circadian and close your eyes and let the story unfold, savor each song and David Cook's gorgeous vocals, it will come alive in your mind, heart, soul and ears. At the end of this voyage you end up in the amazing Rapid Eye Movement but with this song you get the idea of a circle that you will want to endlessly explore. And so as I did, you will want to listen again and again as if you are peeling back layers and layers finding more musical pleasures beneath.
B0034G4ORC|5.0|Battle:LA is an excellent war film. It's not some hokey sci-fi film like that dreadful Skyline or even Independence Day. ID4 was a good movie but doesn't quite hold up now due to the cringeworthy over-the-top moments> Especially from Will Smith.<br />Aaron Eckhart was superb in Battle. It made me appreciate him all over again. We loved this movie and will happily watch our Blu-ray again.

B00506NRBS|5.0|I was having a grumpy day, but spent the evening reading this book. It was a quick, wonderful read, with a treasure at the end. I highly recommend it to anyone who runs a business, works as a freelancer, or has a dream. Humans can learn so much from Derek. A huge thanks to Seth Godin for recommending it yesterday.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|I ate up The Hunger Games and Catching Fire, so naturally i was eager to start on Mockingjay!  Well, BIG disappointment!!  It was all jumbled and thrown together and confusing at a few parts.  There were a couple pieces i had to reread to understand what was going on because everything was being thrown together without something to lead up to whatever was happening, like in the first two books!    I could have been happy and content with JUST reading the Epilogue.  It was a total waste to read those 27 chapters!  I actually wasnt sure how i felt about the book, but then i got to Chapter 25 and that did it for me!  HATED IT!!
1416955070|5.0|I had no idea what this book was about or any of the other previous works Cassandra Clare has done. My friends all enjoyed it and I was a little nervous but I gave it a go. And I loved it! It was action packed from the beginning to the end. There were many twists and turns that I werent expecting and everytime I thought I knew what was going to happen i got a shock and had another secret revealed. Over all a wonderful book and Im definitely am going to be reading the next books to come. I reccomend this book to anyone who wants to be in a world full of action, romance, and magic :)
B001UV4XWY|3.0|Never a good idea to let a very weird guy into your house who then makes an indecent proposition.<br /><br />First of all, who would ever let this nut into his house?  Hasn't anyone seen a zillion slasher/serial killer/zombie movie?  Secondly, who would believe such an idea?  Me, if I was stupid enough to let a bizarro like this guy in, I'd immediately throw the bum out after his pitch (though I'd keep the 100 bucks...).<br /><br />Seriously, this is movie that makes little sense.  Who is this guy, Arlington Steward, anyway.  He's badly disfigured, he's got briefcases full of money, and he's got Mars on his mind?  What's NASA got to do with it?  The CIA?  The devil?  Martians?<br /><br />The movie is OK, asks some interesting questions, and certainly alludes to the Eve in the Garden of Eden.  (It's always the gal, I guess, just like the first instance.)  The special effects are good, and sometimes very, very good.  It's creepy, suspenseful at times, but in the end, you just want to shake these people and ask them why they make stupid decision.<br /><br />I mean, really, what's the difference between being a hit man, and killing someone you don't know, for money, and the Cameron Diaz character?  Just asking.

0156027321|4.0|One of the most interesting books I have read in a long time.  My daughter is reading this as part of their 10th grade summer reading.
0143038583|4.0|The first section was good, the second section was brilliant and the third didn't do much for me at all and seemed pointless. It would have been much better I think to end the book with the important points made in the second section, rather than just tapering off into the making of a pointlessly complicated and fancy meal.<br /><br />I learned a bit more from this book about why grass-fed beef (without a barcode!) is best, why monocultures are so problematic and why eggs from caged birds should be avoided by all. It made me feel so glad I don't live in the US where the crazily destructive corn subsidies exist! (Is anyone doing anything to stop them?)<br /><br />It's a good book and an important book but I do feel it could have been better organised to make slightly clearer points and would have been a better read if edited down to about half the length. Some parts just go on and on describing the most uninteresting and tedious small details! The great parts were often obscured by so much trivial detail, which was a shame.<br /><br />(The comment at the start that bread and pasta were 'uncontroversial' healthy foods made me laugh as well. What?!)<br /><br />I'm really glad I read this book though and would recommend it, and the doco 'The Botany of Desire' as well. Check to see if your library has a copy.<br /><br />Jodi Bassett, The Hummingbirds' Foundation for M.E. (HFME) and Health, Healing & Hummingbirds (HHH)
B0034G4ORM|5.0|An on the ground \\"grunt\\" war that is right in your face and with non stop action! The fighting scenes in the city was very realistic. I remember during Tet the Marines and my unit, 1st Squadron 9th Cav., 1st Air Cav Div. having to go into the former<br />Imperial Capitol of Vietnam, Hue. The fighting was street to street, house to house with snipers every where. Thank God for grenade launchers because they were pinpoint accurate, and caused some serious \\"hurt\\" as was shown in the movie. But hand grenades were minimal in the movie, and claymores were non-existent. One of the things we encountered were lots of dead bodies every where and dead animals. You would think there would be a lot of dead bodies in the movie, but I only remember two-and where where all of the pets, dead or alive? And with the F-16 Falcons and F-18 Hornets constantly flying overhead, no bombs, missiles or mini-guns and no areas littered with dead aliens. They really had it spot on about esprit de corps and camaraderie. You will never be closer to anyone than people that have stood next to you in battle and faced death. And yes people die and you feel an anger and just want to lash out and blame someone, which was perfectly portrayed in the movie. But you have to put your anger aside and work together as a team, or maybe no one makes it out alive. Wearing that uniform puts you under a set of rules that will get you killed. The action really picked up when they met the aliens with a crew-served weapon [made me think of the Germans and the 20mm in \\"Saving Pvt Ryan.]They finally reached a point where they could not defeat the aliens because of a superior weapon. In a very flamboyant move, the lieutenant, who is wounded stays with the bus, their former transit, and detonates a bag full of C-4 destroying all of the aliens and their weapon, and dying in the process. [I guess they left their spool of wire for remotely detonating the explosives back at the base?] From here on the drama which seems to let down with an air extraction suddenly increases when they spot an area that is dead black and they drop back to ground to run a recon to see if this could be the alien command and control center the USAF specialist with them is hoping to find, and take out because its the aliens that has had air superiority and no military aircraft of the planet could take to the the air to take the battle, to them! Well, they find the prize underground, but are discovered too, and head back up to street level. Once there they find some kind of super structure which they destroy. Just when you think that's it, game over, the ground rumbles and the entire alien command center surfaces to leave. They call in a fire mission for ground to air missiles that will home in on a laser spot which they will \\"paint\\" on the target, but the aliens use a drone to get in the way and the missile hits it. However on the subsequent shot they take out the drone with an AT-4 shoulder launched missile, and the missile they called in takes down the alien craft. This even causes the aliens on the ground to retreat with the Marines advancing.<br />Naturally they get back and are commended-and go right back out with the other troops to fight after rearming.<br />My criticisms are just nit picking. Its a thoroughly enjoyable movie with non stop action, and you wonder how anybody could have lived through it. I rate it 3 bags of microwave popcorn-my highest rating!n with an air extraction suddenly increases when they spot an area that is dead black and they drop back to ground to run a recon to see if this could be the alien command and control center the USAF specialist with them is hoping to find, and take out because its the aliens that has had air superiority and no military aircraft of the planet could take to the the air to take the battle, to them!

B0042H6VYG|5.0|The price is worth it for the DVD alone. It comes with their numerous television performances and a kick ass concert at Glastonbury. What a revelation it was to watch big burly men bobbing to the electro pop of the PSBs. I was kind of expecting the LBGT crowd that throng Kylie's shows.<br /><br />Those who have the earlier hits collection such as Discography and POPART should take the Ultimate CD as a bonus disc.<br /><br />A great package and I find myself watching it quite regularly. And it's a blast everytime.
B001HN691I|3.0|Being a Pixar film is a double edged sword. While simply being a Pixar film, the chances are you are going to be vastly superior to any other animated film out there.  However, just being \\"as good\\" or \\"better\\" than any other animated film out there is really performing below average if you are a Pixar film.<br /><br />The first Cars film is probably one of my least favorite Pixar films. So when I saw they were making a second one, my mind made a resounding \\"Meh\\". Then when I saw that Cars 2 was getting pretty awful reviews, I went in the theater with my son with very low expectations.<br /><br />The story basically revolves around two sub stories. The first is Lightning McQueen taking part in an international race promoting alternative, eco-friendly fuel.  The second is Mater getting mistaken for a spy and being drug into an international investigation with two other British spies, looking for who is behind an evil plan. If you are a fan of Mater then you will probably really enjoy this film because he really is the star. Lightning McQueen kind of takes a back seat.<br /><br />The film was very funny and kept us laughing through the majority of it but you could tell there really wasn't any \\"shine\\" to this one that we have grown accustomed to with Pixar. Toy Story 3 had it's impact gut wrenching moment, UP had it's heart felt moment and was an amazing film after the first 5 minutes, Wall-E was stock full of charm and laughter, while Cars 2 really didn't have any moments that really struck you to the core.<br /><br />In the end, as a stand alone film Cars 2 is a pretty good animated film. However, when you stack it up against other Pixar movies and keep in mind that we are used to having something that knocks our socks off year after year, this film really is just sub-par.
B000002UA7|4.0|This is a good CD. I found it at a record store very cheap. I enjoy most of the songs. My favorite songs on here are Wuthering Heights, Cloudbusting, Wow, Running Up that Hill, Experiment IV, and Babooshka. If you like Kate Bush than you should get this.
0596101996|4.0|This book is likely going to be helpful as a REFERENCE guide to javascript users. Consider two things: (1) this book will not teach you Javascript-Ajax (2)This book will not ENTIRELY clear up your confusion about javascript. This is NOT the book that explains this subject from START to FINISH.    I took a semester class (Spring 2011) on javascript and am still looking for the \\"next level\\" book that will fill-in my understanding of what I find confusing after the class ended. In my opinion, this book will not give me the breakthrough I want/desire. It reads like a \\"refer back to\\" book once you understand the subject.    At this point I must state, I have purchased 4 books on javascript. Each seems to add something to my understanding (even if it is legacy info). Each author takes time to state that what is shared in their book may be outdated at some point; apparently javascript is \\"primitive\\", but still evolving.     My hunt for the \\"Perfect\\" javascript book continues.
0345529057|5.0|I have occasionally watched the HBO series Game of Thrones and found it to be really interesting. When I found out it was based off a series of books I was ecstatic (books are always better!) and set out to purchase them for myself. I found this set on Amazon for only $20. At first I was suspicious about the low price- seriously twenty bucks for four books? Some of the reviews left me cautious \\"weak binding, thin pages, easily torn, tiny print, hard to read\\" ect... However I've bought mass market paperback books before and find them to be lightweight and easy to read, so I went ahead and purchased this set. At worst I would have spent $20 on a somewhat flimsy set.<br /><br />As soon as I got the set (two days after ordering! wow) I was pleased. The books are small, with somewhat thin pages, and small print. But nothing to the extent that they would make reading them difficult. I have no vision problems, never use reading glasses, and generally read in dim lit settings and have no problems reading these books. They are lightweight which is something I really do find pleasant, and despite somewhat thin pages I have not torn one yet. I just finished the second book, A Clash of Kings, and am eager to start A Storm of Swords.<br /><br />This set is not of extremely high quality but is very affordable and easy to read. If you are looking for a fantastic series and do not mind a generally lesser quality made book, it's a fantastic price that you just can't pass up. With the money you save buying this cheaper printing you can reserve your hard copy of A Dance With Dragons ;)
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|How do you finish such an amazing, emotionally charged, action packed adventure like Hunger Games? Not at all like I expected. A lot of sequels seem to run out of gas, with predictable, cliche endings. This one was not. The story moves from light to dark to tragic. Slow going at first, and then as dark and brutal as any of the Hunger Games. Profoundly good to the very end.
B0039UTDA6|5.0|Update: I'm through grinning and pretending, and defending Oprah. I can no longer defend that which cannot be defended. Oprah sounds sub-par, and she was not the best choice to narrate Life. I've always known this, but I decided to blind myself to the truth. My change of heart came January 12th 2013 as I was reading other reviews of Life by Oprah, and that's when I came across a review by Rick. Rick says he is a naturalist, a student of physical anthropology, evolutionary biology, and a holistic healer. This guy is a true nature enthusiast, and it was the way he politely introduced himself first, that commanded my attention. And he has pointed out in a nice and gentle way, the absolute truth of just how dumb Oprah sounds, as if she's reading from an obvious terrible script. I had to be honest with myself and agree, that Oprah does indeed sound illiterate. I had bought Oprah version first, and I had no idea that another version was far superior. I read all the negative comments about Oprah's version, but I still refused to believe at first that it was not about racism. I tried to take the high road by defending Oprah, even with all the loud commotion being made regarding her voice. Now I've taken an even higher road by getting off the, Oprah can do no wrong band-wagon. I'll leave it at five stars because this film is about the creatures, and not Oprah, and is still watchable.their disapproval of this entire film. True nature enthusiasts are very mindful individuals, they understand, remember, and eagerly respond to new information. Being subjective can affect how a person listens, learns, or pays attention to information. These individuals are too derogatory, and give off mean-spirited vibes, unbecoming of any good natured naturalist. Those on this destiny have a false sense of existence that distorts their perception of life and actuality. After these facts are presented, it's safe to say these people are unlike nature enthusiasts.<br /><br />Any serious naturalist, who has seen this film, would quickly dismiss the inference, that only David's narration makes Life worth watching. The exclusive emphasis or main focuses of the Life series are these creatures as the absolute focus of attention. After viewing this entire documentary for myself, I've determined these negative opinions of Oprah are completely exaggerated, and based on; personal preferences, vengeance, untruthful complaining, from insecure, obscure, insignificant enemies of Oprah. Every true naturalist who observed this series gave truthful and realistic reviews. Everyone withholding the truth continues this travesty by supporting this review hoax. Do not let these people misinform and deceive you, who will not be paying for your suggested Life. David's voice is more suited for narrating, but if Oprah's version was purchased first which is my case; I see no reason to make another purchase. These individuals are attempting to prevent online consumers, from freely making their own choice about Life.<br /><br />These people have posted their biased opinions, without actually seeing this series in its entirety, and just eagerly joined in denouncing anything involving Oprah. The true enthusiasts, who enjoyed this series, share their learning experience. The self-made enthusiasts give irrelevant remarks, full of disrespectful nonsense and sarcasm. These people do not speak on behalf of any serious nature enthusiasts, as their cruel nature has suggested otherwise.
0439023521|5.0|Excellent book. Very engaging from the start. It quickly became my obsession and I could hardly put it down till the end of book three. I really like the main character Katniss. She's complex, sometimes dark, often fearless, sometimes vulnerable, and wicked cool with a bow. It's also more than a typical action story or love story. Things aren't neatly resolved and the tension whether it's a love triangle, or a survival vs. compassion, or simply the conflicting feelings of a sixteen year old girl keep things interesting. Can't wait for the movie.
B003O86FMW|4.0|...so where were we.  The Hunger Games I gave 5-stars because it was a complete shocker for me.  I had no expectations and was therefore over-the-top surprised at the premise and how the book unfolded.  Since this is a trilogy and Catching Fire is the second book, it didn't really have too many surprises although there is a pretty good one toward the end.  I enjoyed that quite a bit.<br /><br />The book starts off where the first ended, so rest assured you won't miss a beat.  You do gain a deeper understanding of District 12 as well as the others including a much needed detail of many of their inhabitants.  About the middle of the book, there's a hint of ...well, I'm not going to say because it's one of the surprises you'll enjoy.<br /><br />Katniss and Peeta continue their ways and the oppressing government becomes even more so.  This book is really about finishing up some of the loose ends from book one, but then truly sets the stage for the climax in book three.  Get ready for more fighting, more action and just as much flash as the first book (it's really hard to outdo book one).<br /><br />The Mockingjay is back!<br /><br />Oh and for those people who want details of the book.  Sorry I'm not spilling the beans.  Some people like reviews that give specific details but in this series, in my opinion, that's the fun of it.  You really don't know what's coming next.  Collins does a great job of keeping you guessing.  And that continues in book two.<br /><br />I didn't give it 5-stars because it wasn't as good as the first - not as many twists, turns and overall excitement but don't get me wrong, this book is still fantastic.  Just keep in mind that the first book set the bar VERY high.  I'm excited to start the third, which I'm going to do right now.<br /><br />So, should you buy book two.  Without a doubt.  And if you read book one, I really can't understand how you wouldn't want to know what happens.

B000001ELL|3.0|(3.5 stars) After the four simultaneously released solo albums, Kiss regrouped in 1979 for their next full band album. However, the teaming with Vincent Poncia as producer, who had provided the same service for the likes of MOR acts Melissa Manchester, Lynda Carter (TV's Wonder Woman) and Ringo Starr, did not make a lot of sense. It consequently took them in a softer, slicker and more commercial direction. Though, in co-writing with Paul Stanley and Peter Criss, he did manage to give this recording a greater sense of cohesion in terms of a band sound than had been evident on their post-`[[ASIN:B000001EL3 Destroyer]]' albums.<br /><br />The glossy softer approach, including the rock disco opening track, `I Was Made for Lovin' You', more than slightly dipped the band's toes out of heavy rock and into a sort of adult pop. It is easy to see that a heavier approach would have resulted in the entire second half of the album sounding quite classically like the Kiss of old. At the same time, though the sound is a little unsatisfying from the point of view of Kiss being a hard rock band, all the songs are uncharacteristically well crafted. And this makes it quite a strong set in the end.<br /><br />Stanley again shows himself the best writer and singer with `I Was Made for Lovin' You', `Sure Know Something' and `Magic Touch' all being consummately infesctious. `Magic Touch', in particular, would not have been out of place on his solo album (with heavier production.). But Simmons, Frehley and Criss are not far behind him at all this time. Peter Criss' `Dirty Livin' is the greatest departure on the record, but still a fine song. Frehley's `Save All Your Love' and, particularly, `Hard Times' - both of which he sings (along with an over-rated cover of the Rolling Stones' `2000 Man'), are strong. And Gene Simmons is in surprisingly good form with `Charisma' and `X-Ray Eyes' - though, in truth, they are the weakest songs of the set.<br /><br />`Dynasty' may have made Kiss more accessible to a mass audience, but it also spelled the splintering of the original band line-up and a muddled approach throughout the rest of their recording career. (3.5 stars)t it also spelled the splintering of the original band line-up and a muddled approach throughout the rest of their recording career. (3.5 stars)
0062060554|4.0|This book has a really interesting premise and maintains a suitably creepy mood of suspense from page one until the ending--I stayed up way too late reading it because I had to know how it all turned out!  There are a few plot elements that don't stand up to being thought about too much, like the plausibility of Christine having time to re-read her entire journal and write lengthy new entries every day while also dealing with all the emotions accompanying her condition.  But I was usually able to silence (or at least muffle) my critical voice and just go with what the book was asking me to accept, and the result was a fun summer read which I would definitely recommend to others who like mystery or suspense fiction.  It will definitely leave you thinking about your own memories and how much knowledge you take for granted every day!
B004EPYZQ2|3.0|Ah yes, the 70s and 80s days of cutesy Spielberg sensibilities. Basically that's what you get here with J.J. Abrams latest installment. And why not? Steven gave his blessings and executive produced as well. But somehow I think Steven did much more than just produce. The films feels so Stevenish you'd think he held Abrams hand all through the production. You get the usual dose of Spielbergisms with the cute early adolescent kids who act twice as mature and smart as REAL kids of that age.    The film focuses on a group of kids in 1979 making a Super 8 zombie film (obviously inspired not by Steven but George Romero) and then get caught up in a government conspiracy involving a benign but very pissed-off extraterrestrial that the military has held prisoner for over 20 years. The kids witness the train wreck that causes it's escape and their peaceful little Ohio town experiences all sorts of mayhem.    Aside from the typical monster-on-the-loose plot, the film does have some good character developement. The characters, both adults and teens, are well drawn out. Touching on issues such as loss of family members, alienation with parents, a little puberty thrown in and you have all the makings of a warm and fuzzy drama Spielberg style. The only problem is as said before, these kids act just too mature for their age. When I was this age in the 70s, me and everybody else were just plain stupid. And we certainly didn't open ourselves up to each other like they do here.    All in all, the film is entertaining escapism for the summer season. While not a classic measuring up to the likes of Close Encounters of the Third Kind or E.T., I think J.J. can chalk up another winner with this one. After all, he got help from the master of the cutes himself.
157912688X|4.0|\\"Sad Cypress\\" is unique among Agatha Christie's works in that the reader gets to see a vast amount of story from a narrator who has been accused of murder.  And what is even more interesting, is that all the signs point to her guilt, and she herself is not sure whether she committed the crime or not.  But when another character is certain of her innocence, Hercule Poirot is called in to find evidence that could clear her name; that is, if any exists.<br /><br />Elinor Carlisle always expected to marry Rodrick Welman and both expected to inherit when their aunt, the invalid, widowed Mrs. Welman, died.  When Mrs. Welman suffers a second stroke and dies, it is discovered that she had never created a will and all of her money passes to her next of kin, her niece Elinor.  However, Elinor has become extremely jealous of Mary Gerrard, the daughter of the lodge keeper, with whom Roddy has fallen in love.  When Mary dies of morhpine poisoning, Elinor is the only suspect who had opportunity and motive, especially when one of the nurses who had assisted Mrs. Welman discovers a tube of morphine is missing.  Did Elinor also do away with her aunt?  Does her calm, composed exterior hid a riot of emotions that would lead her to murder?  It seems a certainty, but once Hercule Poirot starts making his rounds, he uncovers some clues that could point to other numerous hands being involved in the murder, and also makes a case that Mary Gerrard was not the intended victim, but that Elinor Carlisle could have been the target.<br /><br />\\"Sad Cypress\\" has plot elements that are easy to guess, but the ending is a satisfying and classic Christie twist.  Elinor is a sympathetic character led astray by her emotions and trying to act a part that is expected of her.  Poirot is practically sidelined in this story in favor of other characters narrating and Christie has most of the evidence and twists unfold within the courtroom.  This is a welcome change from having Poirot tell everything like a master magician explaining a trick.xplaining a trick.

It was so captivating and exciting with such imagination!  I strongly recommend reading this book.  I hope it comes out in a movie-it would be wonderful!
B004XJ7HSM|5.0|When I first realized there was a possible underlying religious theme to this movie, I rolled my eyes and thought about shutting it off, because I am an antitheist. But, I enjoy Matt Damon's acting, and it was a very clever movie up until that point, so I kept watching. In the end, I was glad I hadn't stopped watching.    This film has everything many of us want in a movie and then some. It's sci-fi, action, humor, drama, suspense and romance... and only just enough of each genre to make it an enjoyable movie. It's a great date movie, but it's also a great solo movie as well, if you are prone to \\"deeper than sheep\\" thinking.    The movie makes a very clear statement about theology and our responsibilities as humans... that we have the power to create our own destinies and make our own paths, if we really want to and if we believe in ourselves - instead of believing our fate is predetermined by a higher power or fate.     Unfortunately, we never see the beautiful Emily Blunt or Matt Damon wearing the clothes in which they're pictured on the front cover or the movie poster, which I think is bad marketing... trying to make a movie more physically attractive than it already is. Boo on you, marketing profs!    But, aside from that, this is now one my favorite films. It's a very clever twist on an old story, and everyone involved in the production did a fantastic job in creating this movie. Bravo!

B000WGWQG8|1.0|Just how false can the makers of this film be to the vision of the McCullough book? They do a very good job of rejecting the author's vision and replacing it with their own anti American anti western counterculture vision. McCullough did not write a fairy tale. He gave us Adams and others with their faults. But he also showed their greatness. His book is optimistic and life affirming.  The movie is unfailingly negative. In the end, the viewer is left with a feeling of dissatisfaction. This is not a great story. It is a sad story of aimless unhappy confused misled people who accomplished little.     It is instructive to compare John Adams with the King's Speech, also directed by Tom Hooper.  The latter is hagiographic in its presentation of the King. No dissenting voice is raised, whether in regard to the colonial properties, the royal family's propensity towards extreme right wing beliefs, including Hitlerism (later they came around to the proper way of thinking), the class system, the depression, the high unemployment and poverty that existed in Great Britain in the thirties.  We are given a perfectly loving royal family with nothing but the most positive feelings within the family and without. The very conservative virtue of Duty is emphasized. Edward is wrong in neglecting his Duty to his country. Nothing is said about whether it is reasonable to make a king abdicate simply because he wants to marry a divorced woman. It is Tradition that the Queen not be a divorcee and Tradition is good. I do not object to Hooper taking a wholly positive view of the royal family or 1930s Britain. He is not obligated to show warts. I do object to his taking a totally contrary viewpoint towards the US, a nothing but warts vision. The Duty we are shown in John Adams is not sacred. It is at best questionable and at worst just dumb.    Just as the King and Queen had a famously happy marriage, so did John and Abigail.  John Adams comes close to saying otherwise. Abigail and John do notseem to get much joy from being together. Abigail is made to bear a modern day feminist anger and at John and America. She looks sour most of the time as though already saturated with the Culture of Resentment. There seems little affection between them. So those few times, when they act like they like each other, it is puzzling. Where are these sentiments coming from? On her deathbed, Abigail remarks sourly that she did not think he would outlive her. A woman like Abigail, religious, puritanical, principled, would have died reconciled to her God and her life. And she loved John. I do not believe for a moment that she had any such thought as the movie indicates. The happiness of the union is disregarded as is the happiness of creating a new nation.    As a husband and a father, John Adams is continually put down. One of his children became an alcoholic and another made a marriage to an irresponsible husband. We are told this is somehow Adams' fault.  His children do not seem to like him. There is no evidence for this in history.  In fact, although the Adams were disappointed at times in their children, they also loved them dearly and cared for them and supported those who needed it as adults, and their grandchildren. Yet the movie takes the most negative attitude towards the family.  I suppose we must thank providence that the movie makers controlled themselves to the extent of refraining from showing Adams starving his children or molesting his daughter.  The movie is careful not to let John Quincy show any affection for his father. When a letter by Jefferson congratulating Adams on having a son who becomes president is read aloud, we get a close up of the son shaking his head in disgust as though God forbid, the father should take any pride in the son. We are told that Adams refused to help his son in law find employment. This is not true. Adams did help him many times. Nor did Adams force the husband to leave the wife, as the movie implies. When the daughter is diagnosed with breast cancer, Abigail without a look at her husband leaves the room. They do not comfort each other is the implication. They have a cold relationship. This is not true.    The tenor of the movie is sour and nasty. The creation of the US seems a bad thing. The Founding Fathers seem bad. There is no attempt to balance as in the book, the good and the bad. Everyone, including the Adams, seems in a permanent state of misery or bad temper. The exception is Thomas Jefferson, who maintains an attitude of contemptuous and superior detachment, of which the move wholeheartedly approves.    The portrayal of Jefferson reveals a great deal about the movie makers' intentions. Jefferson takes a radical view in regard to the French Revolution, applauding the overthrow of the entire old order and the violence directed at the French royal family and the aristocrats. He says that every once in a while there should be upheavals, riots, and bloodshed. Adams expresses dismay at mob rule. The scene is written so that Jefferson appears right and Adams wrong. Jefferson sounds like a modern day leftwinger so the film approves him.  In the scenes with Abigail, she seems to like Jefferson more than she likes her husband. She smiles at him continually and seems happier in his company.  One scene has her admiringly showing Adams the plans for Jefferson's Monticello. Later, when Abigail and John move into the White House, she remarks sourly that no good can come of a house built by slaves. Yet, Monticello was built by slaves. At one time, Jefferson owned as many as 700 African Americans and he never freed a slave. I kept on waiting for someone to point that out, but no one even utters even the mildest, oh, what about his slaves? Adams, on the other hand, was anti slavery and kept none. But Jefferson is shown to be more freedom loving than Adams.    In the end, we are asked to believe that Adams ended his days miserable and disappointed. It is true that politics made him miserable.He had not the ability to make himself the favorite of diverse men. Yet he did not view his life work as a waste. He was proud of it. He had love and hope in his new nation. He was surrounded by his children and grandchildren and his loving and loved Abigail, until she died. He lived to see his son become president and was rightfully proud. The movie presents the US, his life, as something bad.     In the past, movies glorified our past and ignored faults, wrongly, you could argue. But the modern day negativity and nastiness is worse.
1439107955|5.0|What in the world can be said about this fantastic book that has not already been said. I've bougnt three copies and given them away. As a long time volunteer, in various compacities, (UCSF) mostly friends enduring this hideous disease, this book was like a beacon. I will never view this insideous disease the same. My good friend died after battling breast cancer for ten years and for the last three since her death, I've been trying to turn the blog I did into a book. It is incredibly hard as I find myself still grieving. This book shows me that there is no cure for cancer. I got this out of it, maybe unintended by the author or not. And, this is not negative from my perspective. And, I might add, my really good oncologist friend begs to offer a different perspective. While she acknowleges that it is true, no cure; still, they have done some remarkable things. If they catch breast cancer early enough, they can give the patient a full life. OK!<br /><br />[[ASIN:0934145113 Gun Totin' Chaplain]]I've heard the good Doc/author interviewed several times: my favorite one was Terry Gross, from NPR. He is a great \\"interviewee\\" and more than a little inspiring. Another thing this book did for me: renewed my view that those who are in this field as professionals are incredibly dedicated and those who are the victims are brave beyond words. God bless them.
0062060554|3.0|This is the ONE book I wanted to read this summer.  I actually purchased it new, which is rare for me.  Because I was so excited this inevitably disappointed me somewhat ...<br /><br />What I liked was the way in which Watson builds suspense.  Every page is intriguing, he does does a fantastic job of mixing complex sentences with shorter ones.  I felt as disoriented as Christine does throughout her memory loss.  Watson also does a terrific job of leading the story in multiple directions and building action around the edges of scenes or settings (meetings in restaurants, at playgrounds, etc.)  On the whole, this is very solidly done and keeps a reader interested throughout.<br /><br />What disappointed me was the conclusion.  There probably are not many other ways he could have ended this book, but it seemed a bit mundane and strangely empty.  The resolution left me let down and wondering, \\"Wait, this is it??!\\"<br /><br />On the whole then, I found this entertaining and well done, but not all that I had hoped.
1439102724|2.0|The story itself has potential to be interesting, had it not been written in such a convenient, cliche, trite and eye-rolling style. The topics-- gay marriage, born again Christians, IVF, embryos, etc.-- are quite intriguing, however, the annoying characters and exasperating situations are enough to make you apathetic towards what could have been a fascinating storyline.     I admire Ms. Picoult's attempts to shed light on emerging topics that could be painful, confusing and difficult for individuals and families, however, the believability of relationships, turns of events, and the ridiculous ending detracted from the authenticity of the plot.     If you must read this novel, prepare yourself for heavy sighing and eye-rolling, but also some food for thought and controversial issues.
B004UID2LC|5.0|Awesome so far. I have downloaded several videos and mp3s so far. Videos work perfectly both stores on my phone (evo) our when transferred to my macbook.   So far only about 2 of the 4 mp3s have played on the computer though they all play on the phone. Most likely a problem with iTunes. My new favorite app. I'm sure I'll like it even better the more I have a chance to mess with it. I definitely recommend this app!
B0056BMK6K|5.0|I highly recommend this ebook to novelists, and I think other authors will get enough useful tips to justify the modest price. The first part of the book is slow going, as Locke shares his credentials as a bestselling author and successful businessman and explains all of the things he did wrong when he first started promoting his books. The good stuff is in the final section, where he lays out the marketing plan than he used to sell 1 million Kindle books. As a book marketing coach and business owner, I appreciate his business-oriented approach to book marketing.
0300169787|5.0|Simply Stunning..!!! I got this today, and i almost screamed!!! The Hologram cover is magnificent, and the photos in the book are very great. An Interview with McQueen is included in the back pages. I LOVE this book. This book will be sat in my top of the bookshelf. Don't hesitate to buy this if you are a fan of McQueen.
055358202X|3.0|You know the old joke, \\"In order to progress the plot, another Stark must die\\". Well, surprisingly, that didn't occur in this book.However, that is probably because the book focuses primarily on Cersei, Brienne, Arya, Sansa, Jaimie, and Samwell, with a nod to the Princesses of both Dorne and the Storm Lords.<br />Anyway, the book pretty much avoids our beloved Khaleesi, doesn't touch upon Bran basically at all, and barely touches Jon Snow. As always, characters you have come to know well in past books die or are pronounced dead as an afterthought in a few lines. There are a few shocking moments, and you definitely see that Martin has developed Jaimie Lannister into a sympathetic, dark hero type character, his pushing Bran off the ledge in book one not withstanding.<br />The hundreds of reviews here written before mine pretty much cover all the sordid details of the book overall. I would just say that if you plan to read the new book alleged to come out next month, you need to read this. With the advent of the HBO series, i have no doubt there will be a plethora of new readers. For certain, Martin has a gift for character development, although, as an esteemed friend of mine said recently, Martin has kind of written himself into a corner with this book. I know that Martin is aware of the various criticisms as well. At the end of the book, he includes a short and unsatisfactory explanation for not addressing some of the key characters of the series here.<br />Anyway, still worth the read, and i appreciate his writing style, so i am giving it a 3 star rating. However, i expect better from book five.
B00386EZJU|5.0|I Heard this Hundreds times. Great music scores. The Movie is my best, and the OST's also my best. Love John Powell!!!
B0050XFY4O|5.0|I have watched this film 4-5 times now, and I am discovering something else about it each time. As previous reviewers have noted, the subject matter isn't for the judgmental in any way. If you can put aside any sort of moral objection you have, I think you will be rewarded with a love story so pure that it defies an easy review. The leads have an entrancing chemistry with each other and never once make you feel that they are anything less than each other's soulmates. It is a worthy, beautiful, and evocative film.
1557048630|5.0|I Love the movie HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON, so I bought this book. There are full of overwhelming artworks of sceneries. This is really great book.
B0051OZ564|3.0|After seeing the commercials for this movie, I decided to rent it (thankfully instead of buying it). It is action packed, but is rather confusing. The scenes jump from one place to another and starts to remind me of the ending to Wizard of Oz - where Dorthy says she had a dream and everyone was in it. I never figured out what the plot of the whole story was. So I give it 3 stars = 2 for the Action and sort of excitement and 1 star for showing how strong women can take over an action movie.
B004SGWYVA|5.0|I just received mine in the mail today!  It's solid, it's exactly like the Japanese version.  The Blu-ray is uncensored, and everything is crystal clear. All the nudes scenes are in it, as well as the gore factor. I'm so stoked that I got it.  I definitely recommend this, HOTD is a must for your anime collection!      However, there is a downside to it if you prefer Japanese audio. The audio quality for the Japanese is only 2.0 where as the English dubbed is 5.1. So if you enjoy watching it in Japanese with Subs, like I do, you might have to crank it up a little more than usual. Also, the English dub isn't so bad, the dialogue isn't as awkward as others. So if you're cool with English Dubs then this is a plus for you!    Also, the Blu-ray does not come with the OVA for your info., neither does the DVD version.    Hope this helps!    P.S. it's definitely worth the price!
B0056BMK6K|5.0|I just finished reading Locke's \\"How I Sold 1 Million eBooks in 5 Months!\\" and when I was done, it had felt like I had just sat with a friend at Starbucks to get advice on publishing success. I deal with book marketing advice all the time and I sift through good and bad. This is a book that doesn't go into great detail on all the specifics you can do to publish and market  your book, but Locke nails the fundamentals regarding book marketing in this new publishing era.<br /><br />His tips will guide authors to simple things they can do to get the word out about their books. While the advice is relatively simple, it does involve work and commitment on the author's part and Locke makes this abundantly clear. He lays out the secret to his success and does it in an easy to understand way and without pretension.<br /><br />If you're looking for a magic bullet to create your best seller, then \\"How I Sold 1 Million eBooks in 5 Months!\\" is not for you. If you're looking to be impressed with a textbook filled industry slang, case studies, and pretty charts and graphs, then this is not a book for you. But if you want to sit at the table with a man who has done the improbable and pick his brain for his secrets, then you'll enjoy and cherish this little gem.
B004WCTLNY|2.0|This is one of the dumbest movies I've ever seen, and I'm surprised M Damon would stoop to such a thin, ridiculous plot, after the likes of Bourne and Oceans.  I'm glad I didn't pay full price at a theater for this one!
0316286850|2.0|I purchased this book based on the number of stellar interviews on Amazon. I waited eagerly for it to come in the mail and when it finally came I was hugely disappointed. It was not what I expected. I was expecting a book that would provide step by step information on make-up application. It wasn't very  helpful in that regard. The book seems to be more interested in airing Mr. Aucoin's socio-political views and at some points I felt like I was his therapist. Further, it takes up more space showcasing photos of famous women than providing usable information on make-up application. I'm not sure who its target audience is. Possibly beauty editors and people in the industry who already know how to apply make-up expertly. It does not seem geared at your every day amateur. I wish I had done more research before making such a hasty purchase. Also - and this is not his fault, obviously - because the book was written over a decade ago many of the techniques may be outdated. It wasn't a completely waste, though, because I learned one or two things I didn't know. Still for all the hype I expected better.
1442336390|4.0|I listed to this book on CD.  Portia reads it herself and I really enjoyed that.  She has a pleasant speaking voice and it was good to hear some emotion in her voice.  The book is very sad for the most part but as we know it has a happy ending.  Not knowing anyone with anorexia personally this was a horrifying description of how she lived for years.  I don't think it would be helpful to anyone suffering from anorexia because they probably wouldn't recognize why this is not a healthy life style both mentally and physically. I found the story gave me balance and perspective with my own weight struggles.  I have been overweight since my 40's and struggle with keeping it under control ( no binging or bulemia but just the feeling of being deprived at times).  However reading about someone going over the deep end puts it into perspective of how being overweight is not bad in the grand scheme of things.  Luckily it is not my job to be beautiful so I am able to focus on health and not the size of my clothes. It is sad to read of her struggles with her sexuality as well.  I'm glad to read that she finally loves herself for the way she is and doesn't try to hid herself any longer.  I have always liked watching Ellen's shows - she seems like a kind and loving soul.  I really hope Portia has a long and happy life with Ellen.  This book is very well written I found it interesting and educational.  I can't really say enjoyable because reading about someone suffering is not enjoyable to me but since I knew she is doing well now I could read it knowing it ends positively.
B0025WUK1U|5.0|I was so elated when I got this package in my mail. The minute I opened it I could see how thoughtfully Mary (Jeff's mother) had packed everything together - the photos, boarding pass as well as the booklet inside. Reading and looking at everything was wonderful. The CD and Dvd of Grace Around The World contains the live shows that Jeff did and are ,ofcourse, incredible. Before I ordered this package I had everything that was available of Jeff's music, and was afraid that it would just be the same stuff. But this package contains very different and unique performances as well as the touching documentary ''Amazing Grace''. I'm so happy I chose to buy this - it keeps Jeff's memory, talent, and legacy alive.  Much Love to all Jeff fans out there.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I first learned how to play Settlers about 5 years ago when I was in high school. A friend of mine had an earlier edition of the game (the one where the ocean was tiles instead of \\"puzzle pieces\\"). We played the crap out of it, and had a great time doing so. Fast forward to now. I hadn't played the game in several years, but had been wanting for a while, so I finally broke down and ordered it. It is just as much fun as I remember. The game moves along quickly, and doesn't suffer from stalemates or getting drug out such as Monopoly or Risk. It is also a lot more fun to play with other people, as it doesn't feel like you're getting beat up on if you get behind. Trading is an essential part of the gameplay, and it encourages players to interact with each other more.     As for build quality, the tiles are made out of heavy paperboard, and as long as you don't get them wet or throw them around the room, they should never wear out. One thing that I wasn't a huge fan of right away was the locking ocean pieces. If you don't have a flat, hard surface to play on, it can be difficult to get the island tiles to lock into place correctly. The first time we put it together was on some rather shaggy carpet, and we had a hard time getting things to stay. However, we've played on our table since then, and it locks together much better.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|I haven't bought this one yet, but it's on my list of things that I want. My birthdays coming up, so maybe. ^_^   I saw this just as my love for anime was beginning. At the time, I only had Spirited Away, the first season of Kenshin, and Fruits Basket. My sisters friend let me borrow it, and I fell in love with it. The story line, the art, but mostly, it was the music, it was the music that captured my love it. It's wonderful. If you love the Miyazaki movies and you haven't see this one, you should. Buy it, because it's worth what ever you pay for it.
B003HARV3Y|3.0|Percy Jackson and the Olympians(released Feb/10) brings back the Greek God motif to the big screen and in the process reminds this reviewer of how much I miss the magic of Ray Harryhausens work.Ray's movies included many of the monsters/characters seen here like the Medusa,The Hydra,Poseidan and many others.However here in 2010 its all CGI and I must say I was impressed with the work done.However the weak plot is what brings this film down and no matter the amount of S/FX,they can't make it rise above itself.<br />The plot finds The Greek God Zeus meeting with the God Poseidan atop the Empire State Building.Old Zeus is in an uproar because his infamous lightning bolt has gone missing and he is accusing Poseidans son Percy Jackson of stealing it.Zeus gives Poseidan a short time to retrieve it or there will be war.<br />Percy is just your average high school student,kind of shy and withdrawn.His main friend is on crutches and he has no idea who or what he really is.On a class excursion to a museum his teacher gets him alone,turns into a harpe like creature and wants the lightning.He is scared stiff and has no idea what it wants or why and it flees after his friend reveals himself to be his protector.He runs home to Mom and together all three head for a camp for half bloods(half humans ,half Gods that no mortals can enter).On the way his mother is seemingly killed by a rather large Centaur,who in turn is killed by Percy.In the camp the truth comes out and Percy now knows that he is the half son of the God Poseidan,with all the powers that come with a demi God.His friend is actually a Satyr,half man and half goat.He also becomes friends with the daughter of the Goddess Athena and the son of Hermes.During training at the camp Hades appears and demands the lightning from Percy and in return promises to give him his mother back.<br />Percy goes into action and on a quest to retrieve his mother,with his friends in tow.The son of Mercury gives Percy a map which reveals the location of three pearls which must be obtained in order to reach the underworld.Along the way they meet up with Medussa,a hydra and the lotus eaters who drug Percy and his friends into staying five days at one location,thereby losing precious time.<br />In the underworld,after a ride over the river Styx with Charon,it is found Percy has had the lightning tucked away neatly in a shield he was given by Hermes son.It was a setup.Hades takes the lightning and is about to do Percy and the gang in when Persephone,his wife,takes it from him and knocks Hades out.With Percy's mother now back with him only three can return and his Satyr friend volunteers to stay behind.Back on top of the Empire State Building Percy is ambushed by Hermes son whom he defeats.Down to the last few seconds Percy arrives in the nick of time with the lightning on Mount Olympus and with the details of who took the lightning.Athena's daughter meets her mother for the first time and Zeus grants Poseidon some time with Percy.The film ends with Percy happily back in half blood camp.<br />I found the story just does not pack the punch it should and while the action moves from one thing to the next to be sure,it has with no real twists or turns to keep one guessing.I also found Percy's disturbingly tepid reaction to his mothers death to be rather strange considering how close they were.The S/Fx as I have said are impressive throughout.I found Uma Thurman as Medusa to be a real stand out with her delicious modern take on that creature.<br />The movie is quite clear and crisp and it is transferred into its original a/r of 2:35:1.Extras include deleted scenes,the trailer and a featurette on the movie.<br />All in all an average movie that should have been better than it was but is still an enjoyable romp through Mount Olympus and back.Recommended.hree pearls which must be obtained in order to reach the underworld.Along the way they meet up with Medussa,a hydra and the lotus eaters who drug Percy and his friends into staying five days at one location,thereby losing precious time.

B001O5LVPI|5.0|I have loved this movie since the day it came out and I took my granddaughter to see it.  I have watched it so much I wore out my first DVD an had to buy this new one.  Our family travels to Kauai every year as we are lucky enough to have family there and a place to stay.  The movie is a wonderful representation of the Aloha and Ohana  spirits.
B0001I55SS|2.0|The Black Hole(released Dec/79)is a totally weak scripted,talent laden juggernaut that should have gone into that black hole and never appeared again.Unfortunately for us it did....anyone have a phaser? I saw it in its' initial release run and just watching it again(for the first time in 32 years!)has not changed my first impression one iota.<br />You may or may not recall that Sci-Fi was going through yet another renaissance at the time with TV's original Star Trek now popular again and now out in its first motion picture.TV itself had Buck Rogers in the 25th Century and Battlestar Gallactica.The movies had Alien,Star Wars and others.A great time for Sci Fi fans like myself.This movie had great potential with stars like Ernest Borgnine,Anthony Perkins,Maximillian Schell and Yvette Mimieux.The special effects were top notch and still stand up quite well today,so where did it go wrong? Let's start and look at the tepid plot.<br />A space ship called the Palomino is heading back home from deep space in the year 2130.On its way back they pass a black hole and find,inexplicably holding its own in one place against the huge gravitational force,another ship.They identify it as the Cygnus,a ship that had been recalled years before but had never been heard from since.They go in and investigate and it is seemingly deserted.On one of their passes of the dark hulk an afterburner is damaged and they start getting sucked into the hole.They send their small robot called Vincent(voiced by Roddy McDowall)out to fix it in the nick of time.When they return to the Cygnus the ship lights up and of course they have to investigate.<br />They find a ship filled with \\"robots\\" and all controlled by one man,a Dr.Reinhardt(Schell).He apparently has calculated that he can enter the hole in his ship and survive.The crew of the Palomino have their doubts except Dr.Durant(Perkins)who goes along with Reinhardt.In the meantime,and over the course of the film,it slowly comes to light that these \\"robots\\" are actually the original crew of the Cygnus all turned into mindless zombies(hidden behind a reflective face mask).It also appears that Reinhardt wouldn't mind adding the crew of the Palomino to his collection.They also discover another robot like their own Vincent called B.O.B.(voiced by Slim Pickens),who is a beat up old thing but who aids in the crews elaborate escape from the doctor.However just as it seems they might finally get away one of the crew,Harry Booth(Borgnine),chickens out and takes the Palomino away by himself.Reinhardt blows him out of space.With no where left to go the remaining crew of the Palomino along with those left on the Cygnus,get sucked into the hole.The ending is a reach even for the most intellectually brave of all of us.After they come out the other side Reinhardt merges with his main robot,overlooking a Hell-like scene.We then see an ethereal spirit of some sort going through a long shiny tunnel to turn into the Palomino heading towards an earth-like world in silhouette against a bright sun,which surrounds the body with a diamond shaped light.Is it Earth? Is it heaven? A new world? It is anyone's guess.<br />Yes,that ending leaves one totally baffled.Someone was trying to equal or out do Kubrick's immortal 2001 and failed by light years.And that wouldn't have been so bad if the entire lead up to that point had had more grit and depth.The script is totally lame and could have been written by a first year writing student.The talent on hand do the best with what they have but you can't make gold out of geese.And the comic relief of the tiny robots of Vincent along with B.O.B. sometimes hit the mark but more often than not they don't.They also tried to milk some pathos out of old B.O.B. but that comes off as totally cheesy.<br />Technically this DVD has been transferred into its original a/r of 2:35:1.The picture could have had better work done on it,but is generally pretty good.Extras include a making of featurette and trailer.<br/>All in all this movie gives the word\\"classic\\" a bad name.It's a sorry yawn fest whose 98 minutes seem like one hour and 98 minutes.It's good for Disney that their next foray into Sci Fi would be a winner in Tron.But give this Black Hole a big pass.gives the word\\"classic\\" a bad name.It's a sorry yawn fest whose 98 minutes seem like one hour and 98 minutes.It's good for Disney that their next foray into Sci Fi would be a winner in Tron.But give this Black Hole a big pass.

0316098329|5.0|This book haunts my thoughts. I constantly find myself thinking what Jack (the 5-year-old narrator) would say or do in my day-to-day life. I've read many books, and I've never felt as attached to two characters as I do to Jack and Ma.     If you want a light beach read, keep looking. But if you want something that will absolutely hook you, forcing you to finish it as quickly as possible (for your own sanity), pick it up.    What could have easily been purely repulsive and grotesque in nature, Emma Donoghue turned into sweet and addictive. Give yourself time to settle into Jack's voice, I'd say about 40 pages should do it.
B001TODCII|5.0|Action movies are not at the top of my favorite films list, but I have watched this one several times. The storyline of young girls being kidnapped and forced to work as sex slaves is disturbing and sadly all too true, but watching Liam do his best to find his daughter is mesmerizing. Most of the film is set in beautiful Paris and this adds an exotic element and a sharp contrast to the horrendous conditions the girls are forced to live in. Some edge-of-your-seat action scenes keep the story moving at a fast pace and the acting is terrific. The ending does not disappoint.
B00005JLEU|4.0|I've owned this movie since shortly after it came out.  Until very recently I only watched it in Japanese with subtitles.  It an endearing story of a little girl who doesnt want to grow up, but is forced to, and emerges as a strong young woman.<br />My two year old was recently going though my DVDs, and asked me if she could watch it.  I agreed, and as I dont want to have to read the entire movie to her, set the audio to English.  I was watching an entirely different movie from the one I fell in love with.  Chihiro was a whiney crybaby who refused to grow up.  Lin was turned into a mother figure instead to treating Chihiro as a peer.<br />I was really suprised that the dub was so different from the movie.  And even though my little girl loved it (she watched the entire thing -- never moved) I'm not sure I will let her until she can read.
0618918248|2.0|I think about the Big Bang, especially while reading this book. What is absolutely amazing is the comfort one feels by experiencing the so called proof of no creator. Certainly, there are absolute assumptions which cast doubt. On the other side of the question as to whether or not there is indeed a god, designer of the universe, are also assumptions and actual proof that there is a creator.<br /><br />As a matter of fact, in my book, GOD POWER, this duality of belief is a product of creation. Conflict exists because there is an absolute beginning heading toward an ending. What this book fails to do,in my estimation, is explain preexistence planning. It's beyond arrogance accepting as fact the known universe waited almost 14 billion years to somehow make awareness evident and the consciousness phenomenon relevant. Transpersonal experience in conjunction with research also gives proof to something likely called spiritual impulses, a union of science and supreme attentiveness. In other words, it is utterly impossible to generate a thought if there's no capacity for reasoning to begin with. It simply breaks down to one very simple postulate. Something cannot decide to strategize when there's absolutely no ability to cause a thought.<br /><br />Of course, all the atheists who are convinced that this book is their bible ought to ask themselves one simple question. \\"How does a thought come from nothing?\\" No scientist or atheist can explain that no consciousness, reason, planning, thought process, or provocation existed before the big bang. Further, it will be absolutely proved, there is a beginning and that energy dilutes (second law of thermodynamics) which means there has to be a source or power providing it!<br /><br />Because these important subjects have been cleverly left out of this exercise, I'm tempted to give this well written propoganda a low grade.
6304981635|4.0|Enter the Dragon is reminiscent of a 70s Bond film combined with elements of the Bruce Lee films, with many amazing martial arts duels. The film's slow pacing really enhances, rather than hurts, the film's build up to an intense, action-packed finish.     Sure, there's a little cheesiness, but fine performances, intense martial arts, and an interesting plot make this an intriguing, remarkable classic. Mr. Han (Shih Kien), who sits there with many of the diabolical James Bond villains, has a mysterious island laced full of beautiful women, faithful servants, secret entrances, exits and traps and plenty of other gadgetry. Han has a special delight in power, greed, and inflicting pain on others, and has the sinister laugh down pact.     Bruce Lee's shines in his final film, as he has a charismatic air about him, intelligence and a street smart toughness to not fall for Han's traps. We all love seeing Lee kick butt in martial arts showdowns, and in this film we see a climactic showdown of showdowns, but in Enter the Dragon is fun to watch him play spy, infiltrating the trickiness of Lee's island and his various secret rooms.     The premise:  Lee agrees to go Han's island to investigate the allegedly corrupt master of a narcotics gang, but also as a measure of revenge for his sister's death. Two others, Roper (John Saxon) and Williams (Jim Kelly) go to the island and join Lee in Han's Tournament, which is a tournament that is deadlier than they anticipated. Jim Kelly, who starred in many other kung fu films, brings an air of slick street coolness to his role as Williams, and has some unforgettable and clever lines when confronting Han. As Lee investigates the island, the truth of Han's corruption becomes all too clear.     Ashamed to say that I had never watched Enter the Dragon until a few weeks ago, but I'm glad I checked it out.
0316098329|3.0|To five year old Jack, Room is his world and all he knows. An 11x11 shed is where he was born and where he has lived with his Ma for the last five years.  It's where he reads, eats, plays, and when Old Nick comes in the night Jack goes to the wardrobe where he is safe.<br /><br />Although Room is home to Jack it is prison to Ma since she has been held captive there for the last seven years. Her determination to keep Jack safe and create a life for Jack leads her to devise a plan of escape that relies on Jack's bravery and luck.  Told from Jack's prospective, the reader is led into a world that although tragic is also all he knows.<br /><br />I wasn't sure I was going to be able to get through the book when I started because of the way it is written with Jack's pronunciation, however, as  I continued I felt as though I was truly getting a glimpse of the world in which Jack and his mother survived. I was intrigued by what Ma did to keep Jack occupied and I felt her struggle with getting out of the Room but also I felt in incredible desire to keep Jack safe.<br /><br />Jack's perspective on so many things that are taken for granted hit me many times when I read the book.  \\"In the world I notice persons are always stressed and have no time,\\" \\"Also everywhere I'm looking at kids, adults mostly don't seem to like them, not even parents do. They call the kids gorgeous and so cute, they make the kids do all the thing all over again so they can take a photo, but they don't actually play with them, they'd rather drink coffee talking to adults.\\"<br /><br />Their journey was not easy and was an interesting read and a fast read that did pull you in.  I thought the book was good, but I don't think it was great.  Out of 5 stars I give it 3.<br /><br />Happy Reading<br />Kara
B005G4TJUC|5.0|Now this is how you make a summer blockbuster movie! The action is so epic and it never stops. The visuals are insane and breath-taking. It has those hilarious moments, and even Mr. Chow from The Hangover gives a great cameo. It's a much darker film and not entirely kid-friendly. I'm sure anyone that grew up with the cartoon in the 80's would love it. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is a newcomer this time playing Carly, Sam's new love interest. If you don't dwell on it, you probably won't miss Megan Fox.<br /><br />The Autobots have formed an alliance with the U.S. They soon find out why they originally sent Apollo 11 to the moon in 1969, to discover a Cybertronian ship piloted by Sentinel Prime carrying pillars called The Ark. Optimus revives Sentinel and is immediately betrayed by one of his own. Sentinel and Megatron team up and try to bring their planet; Cybertron to earth. It's up to Sam, Carly, Lennox, Epps and the Autobots to defeat the Decepticons once and for all. I highly recommend TRANSFORMERS: DARK OF THE MOON!!!
B004EPYZUI|4.0|I liked this movie! People are very hard on it.  Sure the narrative is a little rough.  Could it use some smoothing? Yes.  Is it hopeless? No.  I found that the movie kept me entertained and the different venues for battles and plot progression kept the movie feeling fresh.  If you are the kind of person who goes to the movies to be entertained still and not worried about whether or not this movie is the next Godfather or Inception or (insert some award winner here), then get it!  Favorite part of this movie: Special Effects!!!!
B0041KKYGU|4.0|This movie was a little better than I was expecting. It was very funny and very dirty. Cameron Diaz is the best bad teacher ever. She cusses at her students, mocks them, drinks in her class, and does drugs. At the start of the new school year, Elizabeth meets a new teacher named Scott. She tries to flirt with him, but he just got out of a bad relationship and just wants to be friends. She begins to embezzle from the school so she can have breast surgery. Another snoopy teacher named Amy Squirrel competes against Elizabeth and tries to prove she is stealing money. I highly recommend BAD TEACHER!!!
B0009S2T0M|4.0|A man is mysteriously imprisoned during 15 years in a hotel room. And once he's released he will just have five days to find his captor and seek revenge.<br /><br />The plot is denser than ususal in this terrible existential drama that will involve victim and victimary.<br /><br />The movie in question was awarded with the Great Prize of Cannes in 2004. A well rounded script highly praised by Quentin Tarantino that knows this issue as just as few directors in the world.<br /><br />A cult movie since its immediate release.
B004HD61KE|5.0|Devil Colony has everything I love about Rollins.  High adventure, intriguing history, shocking revelations and an action-packed finale.<br /><br />Always the master of blurring the line between science and history, Rollins delivers in Devil Colony.<br /><br />I also loved the fact that this book highlighted Painter Crowe's Native American history and culture, then brilliantly tying the entire story back to the founding of America.<br /><br />Asking the question...<br /><br />Was America based on a lie?<br /><br />I know I have already bought my \\"Spread the Word about the Lie\\" T-shirt!
0345529057|5.0|I couldn't put any of these books down - got through all four long books in record time!  Now I'm waiting for the latest one.

B0051QK87S|3.0|I'm not much of a mainstream fan but there's some *mainstream* artists that I like listening to once and a while. Well, if you're going to turn the radio stations *ON* it's very difficult *NOT* to listen to Lady Gaga. Not just on radio stations in fact, even on TV shows, in bars, clubs, parties and regular restaurants even. Lady Gaga songs are just everywhere and as with her previous albums The Fame & The Fame Monster I was expecting this to be a smash hit.<br />Well, was it ? I would say it is in a degree, it doesn't live up to the hype or to the success of the first album however it is *different* than your usual Lady Gaga style.<br /><br />While, The Fame & The Fame Monster were mostly very *preppy* and full of pop beat songs, this album actually has some songs that take a different direction. It also has some saxophone and piano play with less electronic pop and auto tone involved which is not so much of Lady Gaga's style.<br /><br />I'm not going to review this album song by song as other reviewers did so well, So I'm going to divide it to the two categories (Songs that I liked and Songs that I didn't like) based on my opinion.<br /><br />SONGS THAT I LIKED :<br /><br />-Marry The Night (It's the #1 song in the album and it's quite decent actually. A Catchy song, O.K Lyrics I guess and an alright use of electronic beats. This Song like what other reviews has stated should have been a single)<br /><br />-You & I (It does in fact remind of Speechless and Brown Eyes. If you're not familiar with Lady Gaga's other songs that don't get any radio play then you'll notice it is quite different than for example Poker Face, Telephone and all the other popular Lady Gaga's songs. It only has instruments and singing with hardly any autotoning and I think Gaga should make more songs like that)<br /><br />-The Edge of Glory (Well, if you listen to the radio or if you already purchased this album chances are you're quite familiar with this song. I think it's better than most songs on the album and it also has a saxophone part. It's quite decent)<br /><br />SONGS THAT I DISLIKED :<br /><br />-Born This Way ( It does sound like Express Yourself. I just couldn't feel related to this song in anyway and I just don't feel it is catchy. Sorry)<br /><br />-Judas (This is pretty much you're average Lady Gaga song that you'll find on the radio. It's catchy for a while but it gets pretty boring after a short period of time and it sounds like Bad Romance but I like it less)<br /><br />-Government Hooker (Hmm, I don't understand this song or the concept behind it Oh, well. I still think the Hoooooooooooker Part is pretty annoying though and it's tiring for the ear after a while)<br /><br />So, Yeah that's my review. If you're a Lady Gaga fan then you'll no doubt buy this album or already has. But if you're a casual fan like me then it really depends on your musical taste whether you would enjoy this album or not. A Lot of The Fame and The Fame Monster fans liked this album less and some didn't like it at all. Another problem I had with this album is that most songs are more like album fillers to me than actual tracks.<br /><br />Give it a try, preview the tracks before listening to it and see which once you like best. If you liked most of them enough songs to buy the CD than go for it. If you only liked certain songs then it would be a lot cheaper to just buy those songs as singles from Amazon or iTunes :)art. It's quite decent)    SONGS THAT I DISLIKED :    -Born This Way ( It does sound like Express Yourself. I just couldn't feel related to this song in anyway and I just don't feel it is catchy. Sorry)    -Judas (This is pretty much you're average Lady Gaga song that you'll find on the radio.

B005342N58|5.0|WARNING: This review will be very biased because I actually liked Humbug. I also believe that Alex Turner could not write a bad song. (Average maybe, but not craptastic)    I'd have to admit that on the first listen, \\"Suck It And See\\" sounds very average. Aside from the adrenaline rush delivered by \\"Brick by Brick\\", \\"Don't Sit Down Cause I Moved You're Chair\\", and \\"Library Pictures\\", there's not really much to say about it.    This is where a lot of people get turned off by the album. There's really no point in listening to it a second time, they think. A lot of the argument coming from people who hate this album is that it's lacking \\"highlights\\".    The second listen was much better, mostly because I'm starting to discover hooks that I missed on the first listen.    Third listen was even better. The songs are definitely starting to sound a lot more catchier.    Fourth listen was when I truly fell in love with it. From then on I just fell deeper and deeper.    It's amazing how consistent the album is from start to finish. From the ominous guitar intro of \\"She's Thunderstorms\\" to the last buzzing bass note in \\"That's Where You're Wrong\\", there is never a dull moment. For people complaining about the lack of \\"highlights\\", I can assure you that each song has their own special surprise. Try listening to \\"Library Pictures\\" a couple of times and then try not to sing the last line or the \\"Ten nine eight..\\" part.    You may argue that I have to beat it into my head to like it because I forced myself to listen to it many times. Well yeah, if I only liked things based on their first impression, I wouldn't be able to appreciate a lot of things like hot sauce or sushi. It's a phenomenon known as acquired taste. However, if forced myself to listen to the sound of fingernails scraping a chalkboard over and over again, I doubt that I'd be able to beat it into my head before I beat my own head to death. My point is that I could not make the unpleasant sound more pleasant no matterhow bad I want it to be.    In terms of how they rank up against their first three albums, it's really hard for me to say. I like to think their albums as ice cream flavors in that I don't really have a favorite, but some days I prefer one over the other. If you genuinely liked the first three flavors, there's no reason why you shouldn't like this one. Suck it and see, you never know.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Great book, it was recommended to me and glad I took that recommendation!  This story stays with you!  If you are dog owner, this is a must for you to read!
B0050LJIRK|5.0|For everyone unsure of what what going to come from Durst after such a long absence from the spotlight, I ask you - did you expect something else?  This album is a conglomerate of everything that Limp Bizkit represents:   * Silly and abusive, yet profoundly rhythmic and catchy lyrics from Fred about kicking ass and hot women  * Amazing guitar work from one of the most underrated metal-esque geniuses in Wes.  From the strange to the melodic, he can do anything he wants  * John Otto dropping the beat in and out of the songs effortlessly, extremely well profiled in \\"Bring it Back\\"  * DJ Lethal and Sam Rivers lay the foundation of the background, with bass lines and added effects that you may not notice unless they're removed    Overall this album has the amazing guitar first shared with the world on \\"Three Dollar Bill, Ya'll$\\", some of the radio-single like tunes of \\"Significant Other\\", and the more melodic songs strewn about \\"Chocolate Starfish\\".  Luckily, Fred and the guys realized that without Wes in the mix, their music was utter crap.      For the Limp Bizkit fans that are now approaching their 30's that remember seeing them in concert or on TRL in the late 90s to early 2000s, this album remains what we would expect, and for that it is a welcome addition to my music library.
0756404738|5.0|Wise men and women fear starting a fantasy series, and then having to wait years and years and years for the next entry in the series to arrive.  This is the case with Patrick Rothfuss' Kvothe Chronicles.  I know there are 1000s of readers like me that awaited anxiously the arrival of \\"The Wise Man's Fear\\" and I know that now there are many of us who are frustrated that this compelling series with a nonstop narrative and action and romance and magic and mystery must wait a few years until the concluding volume gets printed.<br /><br />I read this 980+ page behemoth in matter of days, and found myself turning pages long after I was supposed to be doing something else.  I did get a little fed up with all the stories people told around the campfires, but if I take the longview, I suppose there was something important in those pages that will come to light in a few years.  I loved this book, and was sad to see it end.

B0050CQY1W|2.0|I've become a big Beyonce fan since her last CD \\"I AM Sasha Fierce\\" and was looking forward to her new CD. Well, I have yet to hear her single on ANY radio stations so I went to Amazon (my .com of choice) and listened to all the samples. I'm so bummed! I didn't hear even one that hooked me. Sorry to say, I will NOT be buying this album.

B002QQ8HAG|4.0|Very interesting behind the scenes of the making of the biggest fashion issue of the year at Vogue, but also a revealing look at Anna Wintour's background, professional/personal relationships & her immense ability to influence not just WHAT is in fashion... but even how fast manufacturers ship orders to retailers. Probably most interesting to those with fashion & journalism interests though.
0316056863|2.0|In the USA Saturday Night Live is an institution. In Australia it rarely gets shown & when it does it's usually shown either on pay TV or at some ridiculous hour way after midnight.  Unfortunately I haven't seen many episodes of 30 Rock either so I was unable to relate to the book in depth. There were times when I did laugh but too infrequently.     Most of the time I just wanted this book to be finished so I could read something else.  I didn't know who Tina Fey was when I picked this book up. I just wanted something funny to read & as this is in the best-seller list with favorable reviews I thought I'd give this a go.    NOTE: If you are familiar with Tina's work this review may not be relevant.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|First requirement of a good mystery met -- I could not put it down. Second requirement met -- it let me understand something which is outside of my personal experience, without actually going there. Third requirement met -- it is believeable and logical in development of the story. Fourth requirement -- end tidily. This book met all but the fourth. I felt like the author just got tired of telling the story and ended with a whimper instead of a bang. The concept is fascinating; it really got me hooked!

But this adapter is a piece of junk junK juNK jUNK JUNK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The worse Apple product ever!!
B0042X9L6A|5.0|Great flash, with new interface and modes. Love the compactness of the SB600 and the main features of the bigger models (800, 900). Knows the difference between FX and DX bodies.  At the price, no better flash. And if you find a few cheap SB600s, you can use the 700 as master.
031603441X|5.0|I spent $40 on the audio book which makes it the most expensive I've shelled out for. I was not disappointed (although did curse Johnny Depp for changing voices then found they had two readers who sounded completely different and ultimately Richards himself spoke the end.)     Okay, it's long. 20 CD's. It took a month to listen to it.     He describes his childhood, has a weird nostalgia of being a boy scout, used to get beat up but became a bully and beat up others, hid his lack of interest in school from his dad, started copying American blues 45's on his guitar with Jagger and they became a cover band. Then it gets very interesting - he and Jagger take up song writing and his descriptions of how he wrote songs, special tunings, etc. and even his drug life are fascinating. He's merciless to a few people who don't make it far in the book - Brian Jones and Pallenberg's 17 yr bf who commits suicide.     He comes off as crude in a couple of sentences - one where he refers to his daughters as T&A regarding the first initials of their names. He relates best with people who served time in prison - interestingly he never did but came close a few times, and he had an abnormal dislike of cops(okay maybe a natural one as they'd badgered him for so long). Jagger gets some well deserved comments on how he ended up big headed. And like the rest of the stones, he skips the perv. Bill Wyman (dated a 13yo with her mothers consent and married her when she turned 18 then divorced a few years later), apparently pushing that under the rug, and does not say a whole lot about his other bandmates either (other than Jagger). He loves Jagger but can't stand him. He speaks about the Winos which does make me want to check out their records.    He sounds pretty level headed and honest and like a true musician. It was far more interesting than other Bio's I've heard/read, and to me, worth every cent.
B0043RGY60|5.0|***I DIDN'T BUY MY CD FROM AMAZON***<br /><br />HOWEVER... IF I had bought my CD from Amazon I would've gotten it sooner than I did. I didn't get mine until Christmas. I had to search everywhere for one. I finally found one for $25 at FYE. I didn't even wait until I got home - I took the plastic off in my aunt's car! I was so excited because I finally had the pink TIW deluxe!<br /><br />From \\"Escape\\" to \\"L490\\" this CD is captivating, and 30 Seconds to Mars boldly dares to go where no band has gone before. With amazing synths, guitars, bass and drums, this CD would make an excellent addition to your collection!
B001VNB54A|4.0|The horrors of war vs. entertainment.  That's pretty much what a lot of people are trying to do when I see all the comments about Band of Brothers.  Two seperate series and it's a mistake to look for BoB in the Pacific.  This series was about the horror of war and the marines that had to live through it, plain and simple.  It was violent and gruesome but it was honest.      Not that I'm knocking BoB as that was a true story but the Pacfic lacks the comradery that BoB shared and for entertainment purposes that's a big thing to be missing in a war series.    The special effects, costumes, performances...all first rate.  Anyone that is gun ho for war and combat because they play too many video games should watch this first before they rush off to fight in a real shooting war.  War is hell and this series shows you just how much it is.

0792843584|4.0|It's rare that a movie comes along that is so vilified, so hated, so repelling, yet so misunderstood. Heaven's Gate is, in the annals of film-making, one of the biggest single disasters ever. It went over-budget innumerable times; it was more of a testament to the ego of it's director, Michael Cimino; it was savaged by critics and the public alike for every one of its failings; and it ended the free-wheeling era of big-spending Hollywood. Looking back 25 years since its infamous debut, Heaven's Gate a movie that becomes stronger and better, not only for its craftmanship, but also for its compelling message. It's story is a multi-layered one, too many layers for any movie to have, perhaps. It presents itself as a cautionary tale on the subjects of morality, political power, and the paradoxes of human desires and failings. It's a human story that is so massive that one cannot watch it once, because you will miss something. The movie does stumble, from rambling, near-illiterate explanations of the complex nature of the human condition, to moments are sheer beauty and moving visual poetry. The one scene that strikes hardest is the one where Christopher Walken walks into Sam Waterson's tent and kills the man (Waterson's lieutenant) for raping the woman he loves. Waterson, after the incident, goes into a explanation of the law, (He is the law by association with the politically powerful.) he sets the morality, and Walken is to obey him. Walken then asks Waterson if he's ever killed a man, (Can Waterson do his own dirty work?) as if to say that Waterson cannot defend his own morality with determined action. Waterson runs outside the tent, unholsters a gun, and executes a bound prisoner. In that moment, Waterson proves to Walken that not only is he the law and the moral authority, he will get blood on his hands and can act without moral cowardice. It's a powerful scene. The performances are uniformly compelling and well-done. Kris Kristopherson, Walken, and Isabelle Huppert present a wonderfully restrained, yet, expressive portrayal of their love-triangle. And Sam Waterson is one cool villain.present a wonderfully restrained, yet, expressive portrayal of their love-triangle. And Sam Waterson is one cool villain.
B003L77FYS|5.0|I've been in love with this show since the day it premiered on ABC.  This isn't your run-of-the-mill cop procedural.  It's full of excitement, drama, mystery, witty banter, comedy, romance, family moments, and all-out fun.  That's not to mention the amazingly talented and well-rounded cast that make it come alive on the screen.  The writing is also top-notch, giving a realistic quality to the characters and helping the show to move smoothly.  That's not to say the show hasn't had misses amongst its hits, especially this season, but as the show has grown and moved along, it has only gotten better.      This season, there was a lot more intensity and suspenseful drama than the first two seasons combined.  Now, while it's always nice to have a light, fluffy episode (e.g. Almost Famous, Close Encounters of the Murderous Kind, and Poof, You're Dead), the action of these more intense, darker ones (e.g. 3XK, Knockdown, Setup/Countdown, Knockout) really picks the show up and shows its full potential.  On top of being \\"bigger\\", the show has also kicked up its romance factor: Ryan proposing to his girlfriend Jenny in the middle of the precinct, Lanie and Esposito hooking up, Alexis getting a boyfriend, and the ever-growing relationship between Castle and Beckett (even with Beckett seeing someone else).  Perhaps getting viewers used to the idea of romantic relationships for when Caskett becomes a reality?  Just a thought.  Though, those two have matured greatly together over this season, and I personally can't wait to see them as a couple.  They've come so far and, as frustrating as the wait is, the writers have taken great care with getting them to that place together.  This season has truly displayed that.    One thing about this season that stuck out for me was its display of growth in the characters.  There were moments of very raw emotion as well as surprising moves from everyone; Alexis getting into a little trouble, Martha truly showing how wise she is, Ryan and Esposito fighting each other, Montgomery making one of the hardest (and final) decisions of his life, Beckett breaking out of her hard shell and showing her softer side, and Castle finally growing a pair and calling Beckett out on things he's been wanting to for a long time--not to mention owning up to his feelings for her.  It's more of these characters and who they are underneath that we've never seen until now.  It shows their depth and new dimensions to explore for future situations.  This is yet another thing that makes \\"Castle\\" shine.    In conclusion, and on a lighter, slightly fan-girly note: this season was FREAKING AWESOME!  I'm so excited for season four, and I'll be sure to buy this DVD to add to my collection of the first two seasons.  I could watch these episodes over and over and not get tired of them...really, I could.  So, as far as I'm concerned, this set will be more than worth the money.
B002VECM6S|5.0|This is a movie that stays with me and comes to my mind regularly. That it is based on a true story makes it even more significant to me.    I am so impressed with how kind hearted and brave some people can be, willing to take a lot of risk for what they believe in. This is a heart-warming movie that makes me believe that there is hope for the future and learns me that by giving you gain. I have a lot of respect for this wonderful Leigh Anne Touhy that Sandra Bullock portraits so well.    The acting is brilliant and the story well told. Highly recommended.
1597801585|2.0|Characters    The book follows 4 different characters: Anderson Lake, a man who manages a factory while searching for sources of genetic material, Hock Seng, a refugee and secretary who works behind the scenes, Emiko, the windup girl for who the book is named, and Jaidee, a well known and very well respected member of the military.  I think the most interesting character was Emiko, but it was in many ways less due to her character and more to what she is being a windup.  A windup is a genetically engineered human.  In Emiko's case, she is engineered to be a servant and she originally worked for a Japanese businessman but was then abandoned.  Overall I didn't care much for the characters in this book, they were well developed but were fairly static throughout the book.    Setting    The most interesting part of the book.  The book is set in a future Thailand.  Most of the plants in the world are no longer capable of growing because of several genetically engineered viruses that attack the plants.  Because of this, there are far fewer people in the world and the main power in the world outside of Thailand is that of several companies who produce genetically engineered food that is immune to the diseases.  As scientists have begun to genetically engineer food, they also genetically engineer animals such as the megodonts (essentially elephants that are used for labor) and different humans called windups.    Plot    The four characters that we follow are mostly separate throughout the book.  They are all working for their own separate causes and in many cases work behind the scenes from what the others see.  My problem with the plot was that the characters do very little to cause the overall events.  Most of the characters actions are reactions to what is happening around them.  The single biggest action for the plot committed by a viewpoint character is not planned and is essentially a reaction to being pushed around.    Enjoyment    I really tried to, but I just couldnot get into this book.  The worldbuilding is very well done and the high point of the book, but the setting cannot drive a story.    Overall Grade    I rarely put books down without finishing them, but this book came close.  I can't suggest this book too highly.    3/10    This and all of my reviews are available on my blog.

1843793792|4.0|I'm not a fan of the fake-Jane Austen novel (which seem to be proliferating lately), but I got the audiobook of Venetia read by Richard Armitage anyway. His rich, funny, sexy narration makes the mediocre (and predictable) plot enjoyable. It's a good one for a long car trip (which is why I bought it), but I think it was Armitage rather than Heyer who made the miles fly by.

B004A8ZX2S|4.0|As I sat through this film, I felt that there were moments of unparalleled, shimmering beauty surrounded by a film that was way too pretentious.<br /><br />There's hardly any dialogue,<br />no sense of narraration or story,<br />the Sean Penn chacter is baffling and useless,<br />the ending really had no climax,<br />the relationship between Brad Pitt (father) and Jessica Chastain (mother) is minimized,<br />The creation of the universe/dinosaur montage made no sense and<br />there were too many Discovery Channel/nature montages.<br /><br />Walking out of the theater, I had negative feelings about the film.<br /><br />However, I thought about this film that evening and the next day. It made me reminisce about my childhood and upbringing. Although the film takes place in Waco, Texas, it could have been anytown America, circa 1955-1975...my era. I grew up in the 60's and 70's and this film did strike a very emotional chord with me. It reminded me of my childhood, in a manner, that no other film has come close to. It captured moments of;<br /><br />The elation and jealousy of getting a baby sibling;<br /><br />The mischievous playing with matches and the adventure of first encountering firecrackers;<br /><br />The excitement of going into a downtown area/business district (before the era of strip shopping malls and convenience stores);<br /><br />The innocent strange and creepy sensation of first encountering a handicap person;<br /><br />The excitement of playing in a suburban neighborhood and running through the yards;<br /><br />The sheer joy of swimming or running through sprinklers on a hot day;<br /><br />The special bond formed between brothers of a close age;<br /><br />This film brilliantly made cinematic \\"rites of passage\\" that are a common denominator among us baby boomers (It would be hard for a person that grew up in an urban environment or generation X and Y to empathize with this).<br /><br />I honestly do not know, exactly, what this film was about. Brad Pitt was excellent as an Eisenhower-era suburban Dad. In today's eyes, he would be viewed as too stern and abusive however, he was dead on accurate as to how a man thought he was supposed to act during that era. As realistic as Pitt's character was, Jessica Chastain was the opposite since her character was played as a mythical beauty, a representative of pure grace. In the beginning of the movie, they learn that their 19 year old was killed (presumably ...in Vietnam?) and the rest of the movie goes back to when everybody was young and the movie simply ponders ...LIFE.<br /><br />This is not an easy movie to absorb. While many parts were brutally ponderous (the creation of the universe sequence lasts... like... 20 minutes, creating a very unneccessary break in the drama) most of the scenes, even if they did not work, were nontheless captivating.<br /><br />In hindsight, this movie is very daring because it has sequences of absolute, unequaled beauty and tenderness yet the film never feels that it has to explain itself or any aspect of what is going on. This is an unapologetic \\"take it or leave it\\" piece of art that is simply on celluloid.<br /><br />I changed my feeling about this movie because it stuck with me in a manner that no other film has done...and therefore, it achieved it's job. This is flawed yet director Terrance Malick's flaws are incompareable to the play it safe films that make the rounds. This film can only be appreciated by a parton that views movies as an \\"art form\\".<br /><br />NOTE, this film is compared to \\"2001, a Space Odyssey\\" but this is nothing like that, Kubrick's movie is much more cohesive with the \\"Star Child\\" ending being very pragmatic compared to lack of struture in this film. I compare this film to movies that capture innocent nostalgia, the very under-appreciated kids/baseball movie \\"The Sandlot\\" or \\"Stand by Me\\" coming to mind.ve however, he was dead on accurate as to how a man thought he was supposed to act during that era.

B001R60ESE|5.0|One of the best concert video's I've seen.  Fantastic line-up of guest artists performing with Mr. Botti.  Would have loved to see this live!
B001WCN232|3.0|Another reviewer is right: This disc sucked when it was released, and it still does. If, however, one wants an uncensored version of \\"Star Star\\" that truly ROCKS, get the one off of \\"Love You Live!\\"
B004VUP8WK|4.0|Boy, when a band releases an album after a gap like this, and dares to be different, it's either embraced or trashed by ham fisted reviewers that sound like a member of Dethklok on speed by the way they type.  Excluding the intro(which is GREAT in a war march kind of way)the album could very well have been released as two eps, with the industrial ep being longer  I understand exactly why fans are upset, okay?  It's a system shock on first listen, and that's all some people are willing to give this  The Death Metal tracks give off more of that \\"Domination Swamp Sludge\\" vibe, while the industrial numbers take a few listens to really sink in (this provides you can listen to them in their entirety)  \\"Radikult\\", with the misheard lyrics that has everyone saying \\"Boodycount wants their lyrics back!\\" commits the apparent Metal sin of being catchy, and to call this \\"Cold Lake\\" or \\"St Anger\\"  is ludicrous.  Judge for yourselves, I grew up with Morbid Angel, and matured as a person and realized that repetition, although safe, gets boring and stale after while  I also happen to be a fan of DarkThrone's crust punk influenced album's and also Carpathian Forest's \\"F**k You All!\\" which also get trashed regularly.  Guess what?  Neither band cares, just like Morbid Angel doesn't, but this album is the next logical step from Domination, if you listen openly  It's not the failure it's being screamed that it is, nor is it perfect
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|For many years the hero of this difficult to classify novel was close to his Grandfather, but considered the tales of his unusual childhood and upbringing with the scepticism that comes with age.<br /><br />But what if it was actually true?  What if there are perils out there that are inconceivable in the cold hard light of day?<br /><br />This is an unusual novel, probably classified as Young Adult as this is a story told by one such person, but it is unusual on many levels.  Realistically it is more a story of young compassion, devotion and dedication, and the struggle to be accepted it you are .... different.  If I have one small grievance it would be the ending (no spoilers here) but clearly there is more to come, and I would have preferred the novel to have had a stand alone conclusion.
B004W5T2RG|1.0|I did not like this movie at all.  It was bad.  1 start is really too good for it, but its the lowest I can pick.<br />Garrett Hedlund and Leighton Meester did a good job and sang well.  Gwyneth Paltrow was pretty boring and seemed to suck the life right out of the movie.<br />And don't believe the title, she wasn't country strong at all.
B004XE0P5E|4.0|I ordered this, read all the negative criticism (allmusic.com included), then toyed with the idea of getting rid of it, unopened.  Boy, that would have been a mistake.  At that time I had not heard For Emma Forever Ago.  I eventually ripped it open and popped in the car player.  My first reaction, \\"this ain't so bad\\".  Now I've played it a couple of times, I love the romantacism that these songs project.  I ran out and picked up Emma, and while I agree that I like that one better, this really isn't so bad, at all.  A solid four star effort, I'd give Emma another half a star for it's naked beauty but I'm diggin' this cat's songs and voice.

Some of the questions are serious and others are more just for fun but I think it would be great to look back over a few years and see how your answers have really changed, and what is important to you.  I might consider buying another one for myself.
B001AGXEAG|2.0|I loved this movie as a kid, but now ordering it for my 9 year old, I was shocked to watch it again and hear not only several profane words, but the \\"f\\" bomb, as well as many sexual references. I think they were a bit lax in their rating system back then-- definately more of a PG-13.

B0056BMK6K|5.0|I got my Kindle and this book on the same day - yesterday - then read the entire book last evening. My joy was limitless.<br /><br />First, I enjoyed John's stories about his background and the things he's tried. I wasn't tempted to jump to the money spot. Instead, I reveled in the build-up.  The payoff came after a mindset play and it was great.<br /><br />I already knew that social media was the key to everything. What I didn't know was how to use it properly. That's what John explains here.  It's simple but it takes a certain ability to see through the forest to the trees that are your audience and what will appeal to them.<br /><br />Thank you, John, for sharing. You gave me exactly what I needed. Looking forward to a long weekend to begin implementing my plan based on your insight.<br />[[ASIN:B004UH0MG6 Red Mojo Mama]]
B0037QGS0A|4.0|A small film done for television and it shows. Too many close-ups for one and the movements are so slow, including the final lethal accident, that they seem suspended in mid-air. And these moments of absolute concentration on one face with one expression that is stretched out to unbearable proportions are definitely too long.<br /><br />But there can be very good TV films? Sure, honey pie, sure, when David Lynch is the master of ceremonies.<br /><br />Now what about the subject? A university professor that makes himself academically and pedagogically available to his students. The film cheats at once and only shows girls. Of course such open relations with students can be verging onto flirting, with the girls or with the boys, or both. Students need to meet listening ears and professors need to meet mirror neurons that are going to mimic or mi-mock them. Sex is at times even the only thing they all have on their minds but they would never do it for a myriad of reasons.<br /><br />The wife is a gynecologist who has become frigid with her profession and she starts imagining for one thing among others that her late teenager nearly adult son is still a little boy who does not look at himself in the mirror and does not even know bees and birds have some kind of moss-life. Frigid I told you. Then she starts fantasizing her husband having an affair. So she hires a prostitute to approach her husband and test him.<br /><br />What had to happen happens of course and what's more the wife falls for the girl, and what's more the girl makes the boy trip and fall for her and even spend some good time in the mummy's bed, and mummy really is the right word.<br /><br />After a lethal accident everything will go back to normal. Three semi-strangers living under the same roof and nearly frigid to one another, estranged in all possible ways and only carrying on a life of boredom and dumb perversity. The husband will eventually assault a hotel maid and the wife will eventually have an affair with a female secretary of hers. As for the son he will probably be just as warped and twisted as his parents especially since he witnessed the lethal incident in his hastily put on briefs.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUAs for the son he will probably be just as warped and twisted as his parents especially since he witnessed the lethal incident in his hastily put on briefs.

0689835604|3.0|My 13 month old loves learning about body parts, so this book is a lot of fun for him. Unfortunately, the flaps he is supposed to lift are not thick like the pages of a board book, but rather thin like a piece of thick paper. As a result, they were hard at first for him to get his chubby little fingers onto (until he bent them out of shape so much that they no longer lay flat!), and they were easily ripped.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|I am officially addicted to reading on my phone but this app is taking up way too much space. Please let me move it to my SD card!    Some awesome features are:     Highlight a word and see the definition     Tap the screen to see your location in the book (though other reading apps show you the location in your chapter as well, kindle does not).    Whispersync. Syncs your furthest read location across all your kindle devices. Though it doesn't work if you re-read a book. It goes to the furthest read location, not the most recent location.     Three viewing modes: day, night, and sepia. Also you can adjust screen brightness from right within the app.     Overall I love the app. My only real complaint is that I don't see why it has to be on my device and not my SD card.

0061914177|2.0|Yes, yes, he has a lot of energy and you can feel it but it is overdone and  it shows.  Although a gifted speaker, he lacks writing perception as he may have rushed to write this one up for marketing sake. I guess that is his personality. At the end, I was disappointed to read a self centered autobiography. Perhaps, the most useful stuff is the instructions on how to get started. He misses the mark because if anyone can do it, that means that everyone will be doing it also making it a very low payed activity. I do not look forward to another book on this guru.
0425241505|5.0|So many reviews have been posted, and I completely understand the enthusiasm for this new series and this author. The plot has already been recapped, and I really don't think I could do it any better. That job's been done and done pretty well. I just wanted to say how much I loved this story and this hero.<br /><br />I had a friend suggest this story to me. She knows I have a thing for bada** alpha heroes, and who better to read than one deadly dragon with an attitude? A serious attitude, the kind that demands, that doesn't take No for an answer, and roars when things don't go according to plan. You gotta love this man.<br /><br />Dragos is totally over the top, and I love heroes like this. He is domineering and calculating; he is also dangerous, menacing, and stubborn. I loved every facet of his personality. I loved when he sniffed Pia like the top animal he is, when he bit her in passion, when he was jealous and protective of her. Man, he was so hot!<br /><br />Pia is also a great character. She's tough in her own way. One of my favorite scenes is when Pia kicks Dragos' crew in the gym. I was so hoping that was going to happen. And she stands up to Dragos too. She is more than a match for him. She is rare and special, in more than just one way.<br /><br />As a dragon, Dragos loves his pretty, shiny things. By nature, he is curious and acquisitive. No one steals what is his, not even one little penny. Nobody touches or takes what is his, and I loved how Pia becomes his treasure, his most prized and valuable possession. And if anyone touches his woman? Well, look out.<br /><br />There are so many great scenes in the book, so many great lines, but one line that sticks out for me is when Pia tells Dragos, 'You're like a stalker on steroids.' And that is Dragos, so obsessive, so commanding, so take charge. He is single-minded in his pursuit of Pia. He does learn to temper his steam-roll responses to a degree. For Pia, he will learn to say Please. For Pia, he will learn to do just about anything.<br /><br />This is a wonderful story, the hero, the fantasy, the romance, all the characters-- I can't wait for the next book!wonderful story, the hero, the fantasy, the romance, all the characters-- I can't wait for the next book!
0307272702|5.0|My husband picked up the audio book and pretty soon, he cut out carbs. His weight began to drop quickly. He kept talking, and talking about this book, and I was fairly skeptical. So I ordered it online and read it in a week. As a psychologist, I was incredibly impressed with the amount of research the author completed, especially going back to primary sources, and it is due to the grounding of every statement he makes in solid research that sold me on removing carbs from my diet. If this many studies over so many decades all showed the same result, removing carbohydrates from the diet makes more sense than any of the low-fat diets out there.<br /><br />I liked Taubes's writing style and appreciated his research efforts. He breaks the overall book into three books. However, the first part of the book dragged a little for me because it got somewhat repetitive as we kept learning about other tribes and cultures that had been healthy prior to the introduction of carbohydrates into their diets. The second book was a little more interesting. By about pages 115 or so, I was fascinated. Despite my inability to read through books one and two quickly, by the time I got to book three, because he has done so much research proving his point, I definitely got the point and believed him. Book three was a great read and told me what I needed to know to not only follow a low-carb diet, but to defend my choice to those who would doubt my decision.<br /><br />Actually, I have to admit I was outraged by the time I finished reading his book, because everything public health institutions and our doctors have told us about weight loss has been wrong, but the science and research that shows what will actually facilitate weight loss has been there all along. Many of these studies date back to the 1940s or even earlier, and yet the research has not been shared with the public, or even taught to our medical students. If obesity and diabetes are such huge health issues facing our country, and putting such a financial strain on our economy, why would the scientific community base weight loss advice on ideas not proven to work? It's mind-boggling. It also makes me angry that I've spent so much on fitness books, when exercising alone can't cause you to lose weight.<br /><br />I've now been on a diet mostly devoid of carbohydrates for close to three weeks. I've lost 7 lbs during that time period. I would estimate I started off about 20-25 lbs. overweight for my body type and height. Weight loss for women is often about 2 lbs. per week, so I'm doing slightly better than that. I've also been taking body measurements, and have lost 1 1/4 inches off my waist, 1 1/4 inches from my hips, and about an inch from my thighs. It depends on where you measure whether it's above or below an inch. These are pretty good results for not quite three weeks into a diet.<br /><br />The first four days of the diet were incredibly rough, and I wish I'd finished the book prior to removing carbs from my diet, because he has tips to help deal with carbohydrate withdrawal. I was definitely a sugar addict, and was lethargic and grouchy for the first four days, as well as experiencing some major cravings. On the third or fourth day, I was incredibly weak, felt like I had the flu, and slept all day. I should have been supplementing my diet with more sodium, through broth or whatnot, to help reduce the effects. I was also still going to the gym and weightlifting and doing cardio, something that Taubes said can be counterproductive during the first stages of removing carbs.<br /><br />The good news is that on the fifth day, I felt great. Unlike low-fat diets, I'm rarely hungry now that carbs are mostly out of my system. It was always hard to diet before because I was constantly hungry as I cut calories. I used to get home from work and would be famished; eating fruit or even carrots with hummus, left me hungry again by dinner time. By removing the carbs (even the ones in fruit and vegetables), my body works to use the protein and fat I've eaten, and then burns the energy stored in my fat cells, which is how it should work. I'm more energetic now, but am most likely eating less. I have cheated a few times. I've had 3-5 glasses of wine each week, but it's down from my daily glass. I had a small serving of dessert two times as well over the past three weeks. I'm planning on getting ice cream next week on the 4th of July as well. I need an eating plan to follow that will work for me in the long run, where I can maintain it but not feel deprived all the time. Removing most carbs, but still allowing myself a glass of wine or a treat once in a while, have made these past three weeks the most effortless eating of my life while trying to lose weight.<br /><br />For those concerned that we must have fruits and vegetables to be healthy, read the book. I can tell you that the majority of your essential amino acids come from meat sources, and that you don't need antioxidants if you're not eating carbs, but reading about the research will actually make this click in your brain. For most of us, what Taubes has to say goes against what we've always been taught. When we first hear we can get all our nutrients from protein and fat, our minds rebel. It creates dissonance for us. But embrace the idea, once you're reassured that the literature and research actually supports it, and you'll soon be dropping weight and feeling better.and fat I've eaten, and then burns the energy stored in my fat cells, which is how it should work. I'm more energetic now, but am most likely eating less. I have cheated a few times. I've had 3-5 glasses of wine each week, but it's down from my daily glass. I had a small serving of dessert two times as well over the past three weeks. I'm planning on getting ice cream next week on the 4th of July as well. I need an eating plan to follow that will work for me in the long run, where I can maintain it but not feel deprived all the time. Removing most carbs, but still allowing myself a glass of wine or a treat once in a while, have made these past three weeks the most effortless eating of my life while trying to lose weight.    For those concerned that we must have fruits and vegetables to be healthy, read the book. I can tell you that the majority of your essential amino acids come from meat sources, and that you don't need antioxidants if you're not eating carbs, but reading about the research will actually make this click in your brain.

Narrated by Derek himself, the advice feels more personal and the messages resonate with care and passion. Great work!
0439023521|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read. It got me not from the first sentence, but from the first word. The rest is history, I couldn't put it down. The narration is excellent! It actually made me suffer and worry about the main characters until the very end. I Looooved the ending. I immediately ordered the other two books in the series. I'm presently counting the hours for them to arrive. Thank you Suzanne Collins!! This is the type of book I always love!
B0042EJD8A|5.0|This documentary is something that I think Americans need to watch.  It seems like this was an accidental documentary that the producer just stumbled in to.  You can tell that as he found more and more information he spent time looking into the facts.  The video recording of this may be rough at times but with more effort being put into the facts and following where those facts lead.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|This is great! It helps keep the pacifier near baby's mouth, which is a lifesaver when driving. Our baby also loves playing with the toy monkey.
B000YABIQ6|4.0|Wow, this is just about the best thing I've seen on TV. I watched the first season on DVD and couldn't stop. The characters are perfectly cast. The story is gripping, with surprising depth. \\"Who is this Don Draper guy and why does he do what he does?\\" is the question that keeps you watching. The pitch about the Kodak slide carousel was incredible, for example. And it's fascinating to see a glimpse of that long-gone world of 1960. I really don't understand the reviewers here who found the show boring.    There is, however, way too much sex for my taste. Way way too much. Were people really that immoral back then? I don't know but I don't want to see it so explicitly.

B004ZGI1V0|1.0|I loved the movie Taken and heard this was more of the same.   However, I was totally disappointed in the progression of this movie.  It was so slow which just killed me.  It was also so disjointed that you have to fill in gaps in the plot with your own theories.  Also most of the worthy but scarce action scenes are at the end of the movie.  It's an okay rental but please don't buy.  Like I said, I expected too much and got so little.

0804106304|3.0|Having just read The Silent Girl, Tess Gerritsen's latest, with its setting in Chinatown and Chinese myths and culture, I remembered I still had two Amy Tan novels waiting on my shelf to be read. I decided to read her first one, The Joy Luck Club.<br /><br />Earlier I had read another of Tan's books and liked it, but this one was a disappointment to me. It involves four women who were born in China and came to this country as adults, and their daughters. The mothers have retained their Chinese ways. They agonize over the western ways of their daughters who have been raised in the U.S. The story is told in a series of vignettes. One of my problems was that I'm not used to Chinese names so I had to keep looking back to see which person's story I was reading. At the end of the book I was still checking the names, which means of course that I wasn't involved enough to get to know them by their names.<br /><br />The mothers' stories were definitely more interesting, even though the daughters had their own difficulties with their strict and suspicious mothers as they tried to assimilate with their friends and neighbors. One mother, for instance, had been widowed young in China and then tricked into becoming the fourth wife of a rich man. Her story was engrossing, and maddening for an American reader.<br /><br />Amy Tan is a great writer but it amazes me that this book was the one that made her famous. Apparently it worked for other readers much more than for me. Admittedly, I found the Chinese culture fascinating, so different than what I grew up learning. Perhaps you will like it.

B001JRB16U|5.0|C.S. Lewis believed that a story worth enjoying at 10 is worth enjoying again at 50.  While I do enjoy my childhood favorites: Gone With the Wind, Little Women, and Lewis' own Narnian series, I believe I can lower the age limit and say that a story worth enjoying at 3 is worth enjoying again at 50.  I loved Mary Poppins when it was first released in the theatre, but love it more now with my adult eyes and ears.<br /><br />Mary Poppins is a warm happy tale, but there is also a definite conflict with a strong protagonist: Mr. Banks and pair of antagonists: Mary and Bert.  Together the boyfriend/girlfriend duo of a chimney sweep and nanny assault Mr. Banks' cold harsh sensibilities like a blow torch and teach him that compassion and joy are far more valuable than financial gain.<br /><br />I found the extra pieces in Disc 2 very informative, and they left me wanting to see the stage show.  However, like Karen Dottrice (Jane), I was deeply saddened to learn of the death of the endearing young chap who plays MIchael.<br /><br />The only flaw I saw in the movie then, and now, is that there is not one shot of Mary's beautiful long dark hair down.  If Mary's room is right off the nursery, a shot of her getting up to get Michael and Jane a glass of water (or telling them to quiet down for the night), with her hair in a braid, or completely down, like that of a faerie tale princess,  as she teaches Jane proper hair care, would make Mary more realistic, while at the same time enhancing the charming magic of this timeless tale.<br /><br />When I was a wee damsel, I only had one word for the first movie I ever saw in my life, and that word still holds true:<br /><br />Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!

0061730335|5.0|Non-fiction tends to lean towards the feral, this book avoids a lot of this wildness due to the Author's good nature. The first part of the book introduces you to the Author's world, next goes the famine and finally the Author's age of progress. What will absorb you into this story is the Author's refreshing tone, humor, determination, and selflessness. Read this book because even in sub-Sahara Africa there are twinkling stars of hope.

1577314808|4.0|THIS WAS AN EXCELLENT BOOK FOR THE ADVANCED SPIRITUALIST. IT SPEAKS OF LIVING IN THE NOW AND THE FUTURE AND NOT TO LOOK BACK AT THE PAST. IT WAS VERY WELL WRITTEN AND DEFINITELY WORTH THE READ.
B0050CQY1W|5.0|Beyonc&eacute; goes ballad-heavy this time, which is a nice change. A truly great turn actually because i think this is where i could appreciate the vocal gymnastics of Bey.<br />Despite that, i still love the marching-sound madness that is \\"Run The World (Girls)\\". Lookout for the ballads \\"I Miss You\\" and \\"I Was Here\\" together with the<br />mid-tempo \\"Love On Top\\" and \\"End Of Time\\". These four are my current favorites right now.<br /><br />I think a lot of music fans are put off from buying this great cd because the first single is just to polarizing (Either you love it or hate it). Give \\"4\\" a chance, you won't be disappointed!
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|This movie  was a pleasant surprise when I  watched it on Amazon Instant Video the other night based solely on a look at the trailer.  Wahat makes this movie work for me is the excellent chemistry between the lead actor and actress, the lead actor and the \\"science nerd;\\" even the grudging respect that developed between \\"John Smith\\" and his arch-rival,the \\"quarterback king,\\" is well done and not overdrrawn.  This combined with the wise mentor in Alex, who for me had the magic of Mister Miyagi in Karate Kid and Obiwan Kenobe in  Star Wars, provides a winning combination.  The action and violence in the fight scenes advances the plot to the inevitable final battle which is quite spectacular in the high school football stadium, ironically empty for the \\"big game.\\"  And the Director makes us wait almost until the movie's end before revealing the surprising number 6.
0756405890|5.0|This is the only book I have ever read more than once. I've literally been waiting for years for the second book to arrive and I am rereading The Name of the Wind again right now before I read it. A truly great book. I love it and recommend it to everyone!
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Beautiful Disaster was absolutely hands down a great story!  I finished it the first time a few weeks back and realized after finishing other books since I just couldn't get this book out of my head so I read it again the other night and loved it just as much if not more than the first time.  It's a wonderful story of Friendship, true love, family problems, and lots of typical male/female drama!  Abby is such a delight, she is so different then most lead female characters because she doesn't throw herself at the gorgeous lady's man lead character Travis.  What can I say about Travis...he has that sexy bad boy image going on.  He is the boy that every girl wants to have and thinks she can change but he only does one night stands and is not friends with girls.  He is different with Abby, at first he genuinely admires the fact that she is different from most girls and wants to get to know her.  After developing a sweet and innocent friendship they both realize they have fallen in love.  Abby's best friend America is one special girl who anyone would be lucky to have as a best friend.  At times Abby may not feel like it but America always has Abby's best interest in mind and tries to help her make the best decision.  Shepley is a sweetheart who is very easy to love.  Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone.
B004Y03LQ2|3.0|I love Iron Maiden. But enough with the Best of.... & albums comprised of old tracks that we have on a number of albums already. It used to be that every Maiden song had its own identity. Every song sounded different. At least the last 3 studio albums are like a continuos song. The whole album sounds the same to me. They didn't even choose the best songs from the time period. I could go on nit picking, but I won't. I'll continue to listen to the good music they put out up to Fear of the Dark. I know Maiden tries to give their best for their fans, but maybe at a certain age you ought to just hang it up. One example KISS. I gave it 3 stars just for the people hearing Maiden for the first time. I could very well do without this album, but I'm a supporter of Maiden.
0765356139|3.0|The second book of the Mistborn trilogy. Having ended the first with the death of the main bad guy, Sanderson now switches course: our heroes have a republic, if they can keep it ... which it turns out they can't, what with the multiple armies converging on the capital city from every direction intent on establishing a new emperor, and Elend Venture's difficulty leading a fractious council with the power to depose him. Meanwhile, Vin is the regime's strongest weapon, and she's running out of atium, the metal that allows her to fight on a fair basis against other Allomancers. And there's a strange Allomancer following her around, and maybe a creature in the Mist, and she's beginning to think she might be the prophesied Hero of Ages who can defeat the evil threatening the world. Sanderson was definitely trying something different with a whole book on the difficulties of the aftermath of tyranny, and I also liked that Vin and Elend ended up having mirrored insecurities about their relationship that they eventually (spoiler alert) actually talked about, though I wouldn't say that characterization was Sanderson's strong suit. However, something that worried me a lot happened at the end, and the worrisome thing seems to be going exactly the way I feared in the third book and I also found out that Sanderson holds Orson Scott Card-like anti-gay beliefs, so I'm now depressed that I gave this guy money (and still have two books left to read on my shelf). Still a font of neat ideas, but kind of a John Birmingham-type disillusionment.

B004WOS3P4|5.0|It's rare that I want to listen to an album from start to finish without skipping at least one song, but that's the case with This Loud Morning. There is not one weak song on this album. I loved it from the first listen, also a rarity. I knew that David was an exceptional singer. This album really showcases those vocals, but it's not all about the vocals. The lyrics, the instrumentation, are all exceptional. I had high expectations for this album and it surpassed all of them.
0385523912|5.0|This book was excellent.  Gripping and informative.  It was easy reading and in some sense, no different from what we read in the newspapers.  However, the author really made their lives come alive and I feel I really know now what it's like to live in North Korea.

B004XANKVO|5.0|This is the best backpack I have ever used in my entire life.<br /><br />The first thing you'll notice is how durable the materials are. This bag is SOLID. The zippers and buckles are high quality. The straps and handles are rugged yet padded and very comfortable.<br /><br />At first I thought this bag wasn't that big inside, because when all the pockets are empty, it actually compresses down into a fairly compact size. Then I realized how much capacity there is. And the compartments are so smartly designed! To give you an idea: Right now the back compartment has my iPad and 15-inch MacBook (which is sitting on a built-in cushioned bottom so that it doesn't hit the ground when I put the bag down), the middle compartment has clothing and a pair of sneakers, the outside zipper is holding my AC adapters and wires, the hard protective case on the outside top has my sunglasses and camera, and the external pocket in the middle of the bag is holding the newspaper. (And I'm not even using all the compartments; there is still room in the bottom compartment, and there are tons of zippered crevices on the insides to organize anything you've got.)<br /><br />The sign of a really great product is when the designers put in features I didn't even realize I needed, UNTIL I used them. I am talking specifically about the \\"Shove-it Pocket.\\" This is a pocket in the middle of the bag that doesn't have a zipper, and it is accessible from the top of the bag -- you can quickly stuff things in there and pull them out quickly as needed. When I first saw this pocket I thought, \\"Um, this is kind of weird. I don't think I'm going to use this when I could put my stuff inside the backpack.\\" Then I realized that the external pocket is perfect for putting in my newspaper. And my umbrella. And my water bottle. And my banana! It is expandable with adjusting straps, and everything stays put. It's a genius feature, and because it is instantly accessible, I find I use it the most out of all the compartments.<br /><br />The only negative I could say about this bag is that it's kind of tall. But I'm 6'1\\" and it fits my frame perfectly - and the height helps it hold so much!<br /><br />In comparison to this Thule backpack, every other backpack I've used seems cheap and poorly thought out. This bag is comfortable, functional, durable, and brilliantly thought out. I cannot recommend it strongly enough.ve I could say about this bag is that it's kind of tall.

B004EPYZUI|1.0|Stupid pointless comic book anime wannbe childish abusive junk. Awful wish-I-could write like Frank Miller but can't, the main character doesn't say more than one line for the first 23 minutes ... makes no sense whatsoever, and the loud music doesn't make up for low budget FX ... think Sky Captain quality, not Clash of the Titans, \\"better than videogame\\" but barely. Seems like it's for boys who never grew up and/or wish they were chix. Don't waste your time on this mutt! Go watch Scott Pilgrim instead - that movie doesn't suck. This movie is really really bad.
B0042816YK|5.0|Maybe I am too simple in what I expect from a movie. I just want a temporary diversion, an escape. This was the reason movies were more or less invented, to divert people's attention from the woes and horrors of everything going on during the Depression and WW II. Today there are plenty of problems in America that make a movie like this one great entertainment, for me at least, to get away from tornadoes, forest fires, drought, floods and unemployment, to name a few.    I laughed a lot at the predicament of trying to learn a new language (Italy) and customs of India. Right away I am in Amazon looking up the movie to buy. Who cares about the deep under currents and subplots. I am 72 and I want entertainment. I laughed and I cried. That to me makes a movie that I would want in my movie library, to watch again and again.    P.S. A movie is like a restaurant meal. Some are good, some are not so good. If I don't like the food I don't have to eat it. I know other places that make food. The same goes for a movie. I know where to rent more movies. Why waste time on creative criticism?
B0052U59F4|5.0|Let me say right off the bat what I didn't like about the book. I read and I read and my heart was breaking, but in the end, I knew that everything was going to turn out all right. I kept thinking this as I watched the percentage grow at the bottom of my Kindle. I kept watching and reading and waiting as it reached 95%, 98%, and then it hit 100% and at the end, it said, \\"end of Part 1\\". I won't tell you how much or how loud I wanted to scream. I am stomping my feet and jumping up and down, having a hissy fit because I don't have Part 2 in my hands at this very second!<br /><br />Christian, with his piercing grey eyes, was cold and aloof, that is, until he saw Ana tumbling through his office door. And, as their worlds collide, they will be forever changed. I loved the characters. Christian has so much depth for a book character. The author made him come alive and you just wanted to hold him close and help him heal. I fell in love with the innocent Anastasia because I am a lot like her. When I see someone I love in pain, I want to do anything I can to help them. This book constantly tore at my heart's strings.<br /><br />I have never read a book with this much extracurricular sexual activity (okay, I'm a Prissy - figure it out - erotica,) but the beautiful love story being told was very much in the forefront of this book. The parental relationships, the best friend relationships, and professional relationships in the book were very well crafted and have a strong presence throughout the book. The book is well written, and I have to admit, my vocabulary increased while reading the book, but I liked that challenging aspect of it. The book is aptly named as the author depicts the many shades grey in the storyline. And, as you come to realize, we all have Fifty Shades of Grey woven throughout our lives.<br /><br />If you are naïve, (like the Prissy here, raising my hand,) you might want to cover your eyes through some of the scenes. I really enjoyed this book (education aside) and I highly recommend it. The sex is hot, and the love, an inferno. NOW, where is Part 2?!mend it. The sex is hot, and the love, an inferno.

0061784788|2.0|I've read James Rollins novels for years and always enjoyed them, even the early ones that required a high level of suspension of disbelief.  Devil Colony did something I thought impossible in a  Rollins novel, it bored me.  Combining the preposterous with historical possibilities, in a helter skelter fashion that never really hit it's stride, I was actually relieved to finish this novel and move on to something new.  Oh well, every novelist is entitled to the occasional dud.

0345522478|3.0|I'm not sure if the author was trying to hit for the type of literary stylings of the Dresden Files, but it was certainly what I was looking for and some of the similar elements on the book jacket attracted me to giving it a try for that sole reason.  However, the book doesn't deliver if I'm going to place it up to that standard.    As a stand alone book it's a mediocre supernatural in a modern times setting that makes for a lazy afternoon read.  Despite being described as laugh out loud funny, not a single peep escaped me.
0307463745|3.0|I enjoyed this book.  I didn't know about 37 signals before reading it.  In fact I went to check out their website and honestly I have no need for their products.   hahaha    In the book, Rework, I found some ideas quite thought-provoking and it made me ask myself about my business if I was doing it (or not doing it - depending on the example)    I found some of his ideas a bit silly however I see why it worked for them!    I thought they were very short chapters, which was perfect for me as I have a really busy life!    I like the idea of thinking differently about my business.

Whether it be Mr Bourdain's constant quoting of famous figures (Yes, we get it. You are well read and smart) or the way he looks on everything with disdain, the snooty and holier than thou attitude comes through in his writing. Yes, it is funny, but it makes me resent the fact that a schmuck like him can become rich and famous.. subsequently leaving his wife for a younger more attractive woman......

B004QSQML8|3.0|NOTE: I have extremely keen eyes for high definition video transfers from older sources, so please excuse me if I come off a little harsh at times.<br /><br />From the scrolling intro, it is already apparent that this high def transfer of one of my favorite fantasy films was going to be somewhat of a disappointment, as I could already see that the transfer team did not care to remove the dust particles (whether or not they made the transfer from the negative or from the DVD, I don't know). These are those little \\"specks\\" that pop up in random places on the screen. One film that had an excellent Blu-Ray transfer was The Wizard of Oz, in which you see absolutely no dirt particles. As long as Legend has been around, and as long as Blu-Ray has been around, I was hoping the transfer team would have addressed this. The other thing iv'e noticed is the film still has a grainy appearance, whereas a modern film on Blu-Ray, such as Transformers, has a crystal clear image. The detail is good, obviously, you CAN tell that this is a step up from DVD, and light years ahead of VHS, however, the graininess is a bit of a let down. The Wizard of Oz, as great a job they did of cleaning up the dirt, and restoring the image, still has the same issue. I suppose it has something to do with the original film negatives. These images are probably as good as it is going to get, as modern movies are filmed digitally, this may explain why those Blu-Ray transfers wind up looking as great as they do. All in all, I am glad that Legend is on Blu-Ray, it has both the theatrical version, as well as Ridley Scott's director's cut. Both are presented in HD, and despite Scott's mention that he believes the director's cut has the better picture quality, I have to say that I don't see any difference. They both have a grainy image as well as the dirt particles. The theatrical version has the Tangerine Dream score, which is decidedly better than the director's cut score. Keep in mind, I am a bit of a videophile, so please, don't let this review dissuade you. This is a great classic fantasy film, offered in the best possible picture and audio quality that you can get. It's just not the greatest transfer, that's all. If this was one of your favorite movies as a child, and you have children of your own now, or you simply would like to reminisce using your high end home theater system, get this version of Legend and enjoy.lease, don't let this review dissuade you.

B0050LJIRK|5.0|All I gotta say is Bizkit is back. \\"Golden Cobra\\" has the feel of \\"Results may vary.\\" It has much heavier guitar riffs with a real heavy bass. If you liked Bizkit before your gonna love this album. If you never liked them to start with don't bother. To me it was defiantly worth the wait.
B0055OK2T0|5.0|Simply one of the best movies we have seen in awhile. I think their kiss toward the end should win \\"best kiss\\" at the award shows. Good clean entertainment!
B004Z7AHZC|4.0|The Diary of a Whimpy Kid book series is the first series my son has read cover to cover. He really likes the movies and rated this second film even higher than the first.
0385732554|5.0|we read this past year in english class. i fell head over bum for this book. this is an amazing read(even tho it was forced up pon us by a teacher!) in a book store i would have tottaly looked past this book because i normaly wont read this kinda book, but even if your not into mistory books, this is one that is written so well that it really wont matter what u like to read. its just that good. the story line is amazing and you really conect with jonas. hes a brave soul. we should have more people in this world like him. it would sherly make this big bad world a better place.
B000S81MHY|5.0|My expienense with proxxon micro compound table kt 70 is that it is supprisingly well engineered for such a small light table it is made of alunimun but seems to have an anodize on it. Anyway I was supprised when I machined a piece of brass on it and got a pretty good finish no wavy lines, for the hobbiest such as myself its worth the money.
B004EPYZUI|5.0|The critics hated this movie and I just don't understand why. In this day and age we complain about remakes, reboots, and sequels but when an original movie comes along it gets trashed. I was expecting the world with this movie and it did not disappoint. From the beginning to the end I was entertained and that is what a movie is supposed to do. The plot was simple enough to follow. Girl gets locked in a mental institution. Girl tries to escape. Along the way she imagines different scenarios to deal with what is going on in the real world. It follows Inception with the \\"dream within a dream\\" idea. The music for the movie was unquestionably one of the best scores I've ever heard. Every song matched with the scene it was played with. Of course I can't get away without mentioning the visuals. Zack Snyder is one of the best today with how he portrays a scene. His work with 300 and Watchmen was well worth it when he did Sucker Punch. I can't begin to express how good this movie really is.
0439023491|4.0|I found this to be a quick read and the auther is not overly wordy but still developpes characters and descriptions enough to pull you in and be interesting.  The book has plenty of action and kept you wanting to get to the end. Fairly recommend. The second book in the series was just as interesting as the first. I thought it was a great build up on the theme of rebellion. This book more than others spent a little too much time for my taste on the  dilemma, but I guess there are probably readers that enjoy that kind of conflict.
067182449X|5.0|you know how they say that when you wright in a diary, that it should sound like your wrighting to a dear friend? well, anne did it perfectly. even though she would have never thought that millions of people would know her story, she wrote it like a true auther should wright. i love how she wrights to her friend, its beutiful. you feel as if she wrighting to you, thats how close you feel with her. even tho she is a person of the past, anne frank will forever be my friend.

B000068TPN|5.0|I would suggest this movie to anyone.  Not only was it a great story, but an actual account of what happen in that war.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|I live this game and the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was there was no updates for new levels otherwise. game looks great runs smoothly and will suck up time like no ones business. It lags a bit on tablets in the load screens
B004HZ76FQ|4.0|It is a fun game, but way too easy.  I passed every level on my first try, and finished with over $150,000. There are no options to increase difficulty.
0439023521|5.0|I absolutely love this book! I hadn't really heard anything about it, but I read the first chapter on Amazon for free and I was hooked. Then I started seeing it everywhere and realized that it was being made into a movie. When I mentioned to my sister that I was going to buy it, she said that she was already reading it and she let me borrow her copy. I have not been able to put it down! If you are offended by violence, then don't read this book. Obviously it is about people killing each other and sometimes the author goes into gory detail. My favorite thing about this book is the characters. They are so well described and developed, they almost seem real to me. Unfortunately I made the mistake of looking up the actors who will be in the movie and I've started to lose a little bit of my own imagination regarding the characters. I am considering buying my own copy of this book because I can see myself reading it again. I love it that much! I don't read a ton of books, but this one definitely goes down as one of my favorites.
B002FGU46C|5.0|This sandal is as comfortable and versatile as they come. I originally tried the Chaco Yampa but felt it lacked the adjustability and custom fit of the Terra Fi 3. Further, I honestly don't know what all of the complaints regarding the shock pad are about. It's completely unnoticeable and in no way negatively affects the comfort of this sandal for me. Sizing does seem about about 1/2 larger than claimed. Otherwise, the perfect sandal.
0061134007|4.0|Having been reading a few of the Scandinavian writers after helplessly roaring through Larsson with mixed feelings, I tried Nesbo. Really like the way he writes two stories occurring and sometimes interacting at once with implications of more. Some of the Scandinavians seem to be writing in a more \\"contemplative\\" mood - Mankel, Nesson. Nesbo's style is a bit more active. Like him a lot!
B00006CXSS|5.0|Such a great gift idea for my dad on father's day. He hasn't stopped watching it since! Amazing footage along with great storytelling. Highly recommended.
B001P9EQH8|4.0|This seems to be an excellent product. It appears to be well built, it amplifies without modifying the sound, the built in battery rechargeable using a USB cord is an excellent choice. The bass enhancing feature does work but seems rather a waste since most MP3 players now have this kind of feature built in.<br />I'm a little disappointed I'm not getting a higher amount of amplification out of it but considering I'm driving it with a Sansa Clip+ which is lacking in output in the first place, I'm sure it will do the proper job with a more powerful MP3 player. Well built and well designed, I like it....
0316069353|4.0|There is so much courtroom drama on TV today that everybody is expected to just understand it, right? Wrong! I love courtroom drama, yet, it doesn't always make sense to me. All that legal jargon can be quite difficult to follow. I feel that Michael Connely did a good job explaining it in this book. It certainly made me appreciate and understand the rules of the game.    The story is a little predictable since the defendant was so annoying from the start it was impossible not to draw conclusions.
B00005N6KG|5.0|Had been my personal choice for some ten years of running, gym and daily commutes. Excellent fit, durable design, decent sound for the size, capable of much higher volume than others. Great value for the money.<br /><br />UPDATE: ...until the price skyrocketed following discontinuation of the model. Currently I replace them with [[ASIN:B00006JPRQ B00006JPRQ]] for sports and [[ASIN:B004U5DH9W B004U5DH9W]] for other uses.
B002ZG98C8|4.0|Literally 5 minutes into this movie, I felt like I was 17 again watching cheesy Showtime B-movies at 2am.  This movie is so over the top, its more like a roller coaster ride. Just pure fun  And Michelle Rodriguez is smokin hot in this - omg
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Never judge a book by its cover....absolutely true!<br />I've loved this book so much I hope to have it printed to add this rare jewel to my library!<br />There's not a single thing I haven't loved and several scenes I've always hoped to read about in other books were all here just in one story!<br />And finally, FINALLY, no love triangles, something that lately seems to have become a set pattern and something I hate from the bottom of my heart. Here we have just Travis and Abby, first friends and then lovers but always and only in love with the other, no third party, no uncertain feelings on the way. Thank God!<br />They're young but not so young I can't relate to them.<br />Travis is to die for...with his tattooes and craziness but he could be all the bad boy he wants he knows how to love and Abby is a very lucky girl. The ending is superlative and not predictable in my opinion, that is, I know there'd have been an hea but not the one I hoped!<br />Give it a try!<br />It's been my first kindle read and purchase....a first I'll never forget...!!!!<br />I hope the author decides to write a sequel!
0439023513|2.0|What can I say, it's  all been said by the others who gave this one a bad rating. I waited and waited for something to happen, for Katniss to take control, but it never did happen. It seems almost all the actions done by our heroine were pointless. There are some very strangely placed anticlimatic moments which spoiled it for me. Actually, the whole book should have been a logical and powerful continuation to the first two, but it just never took off.  A pity.
B002VPE1PW|4.0|I got this case to fit an Acer Aspire One D255 netbook with a 10.1 inch screen.  The construction of the sleeve is pretty good and I expect it to last quite a while.  Since the item is described as fitting 7-10\\" netbooks, I thought it would be a pretty snug fit on a 10\\" machine.  However, it is slightly too large and my computer flops around a bit inside it.  The length of the case is about right, but it is maybe an inch too wide.  That leads me to believe that most any 10\\" machine will fit, probably with room to spare. If you are looking for a really snug sleeve, this is probably not the one. Still, for the tiny price I have no complaints.  The free 2 day shipping with Amazon Prime was awesome, as usual.
B003OJBWGK|1.0|if you have any neko case albums, there is no point to buying this one...it sounds exactly the same, only maybe a little fuzzier...if you want good beachy dreampop...i suggest \\"i'm having fun now\\" by jenny and johnny.
B00008WD6T|5.0|This is an incredible experience.  Groovy, Funky, Sexual Chocolate.  Masterfully mixed by DJ Maestro.  The depth of music is just amazing.  At any given time you can go from cool background beat to focusing in on one instrument and be treated to the incredible talent and spirit of the artist and their instrument.
B001I0T92Q|4.0|Bought this for use in my PSP and it seems to work quite well. However while inserting micro sds into it I noticed that it bends quite easily making it quite obvious it could be easily broken. If you're buying this to swap out often I'd look elsewhere for another solution. If you're like me and the card will likely never come out of where its inserted doubt you'll have a problem with it and I wouldn't hesitate buying one especially at this price point.
0307477479|4.0|I enjoyed this Pulitzer prizewinning book a lot for the brilliance of its writing, but I am clearly not in its target demographic. For about half of it, actually, it was more like a study in Cultural Anthropology. I felt I was reading about a tribe, perhaps even a species, of people that I have no knowledge of whatsoever. But equally clearly, this is a book written by an expert, and expertise is always fascinating. The book jacket says something about music pulsing on every page, but to me (old-school classical musician that I am) it comes across as more like a background noise that I wish somebody would turn off. Egan's view inside the rock industry is as foreign to me as if she were describing New Guinea tribal dances, but it is entirely convincing.<br /><br />Despite the word \\"novel\\" on the cover, this is essentially a collection of short stories, and Egan is a brilliant story writer. She has the knack of plunging you immediately into a situation, whether a women's restroom in New York, a safari camp in Africa, a snotty country club in some alternative Scarsdale, or the meaner streets of Naples. Even if you don't empathize with her characters, you do get involved with what happens to them, and time and again Egan adds some marvelously unexpected twists that reveal depths in what you might have previously dismissed as merely shallow. Although writing about a world which is pretty much amoral, Egan is herself a moral writer, and each time she shows this she catches you with welcome surprise.<br /><br />The main problem I have is that the stories do not add up to a novel. Yes, the characters introduced in the first two chapters -- the rock producer Bennie and his assistant Sasha -- have no more than one or two degrees of separation from those in subsequent stories, which go way back and eventually forward in time. Yes, Egan plants little interconnecting clues throughout. But because I never feel I know these people, I find it hard to care about them beyond the span of each individual story. There are a few instances when Egan will flash forward twenty years or so towards the end of a chapter; I find these quite moving, and they show that even dropouts and druggies grow up. But I don't see that arch in the novel as a whole. Perhaps I would have had more sense of completion had the last two stories been written in a more normal style. But the notorious penultimate chapter is entirely in PowerPoint, which gives facts with almost none of the emotional context (which may be the point), and the final one relies so heavily on text messaging it might almost be in a different language.<br /><br />All the same, Jennifer Egan does have talent, no doubt about it!al story.

B004K4AUZW|5.0|I love most of the songs.  Yes, it is a dance album but a damn good one.  Don't listen to the critics.  You have to make your own opinion.  There is a song for everyone.  Lady Ga Ga doesn't disappoint.  She is weird which I like and not afraid to pull out all the stops.  I would get this album.
0689878451|5.0|Love this book!  Such a heartwarming story, and a great way to teach my daughter that there are many types of families in this world, but the most important aspect is love.
0316069485|3.0|Albeit the book is fast paced it has on it several things or stories that are just to fill more pages. The book also is based on a precarious gist, this is that the jury must not know what exactly happened 25 years ago. That's not possible - you'll understand this if you decide to read the book. I think MC didn't know how to finish the plot and gave the book to another person to do that for him. Awfully bad ending. On top of that end he - or somebody else wrote some kind of epilogue that is the prologue of another book.
B003QCCS3Q|4.0|Some really amazing songs and some that really drag the album down. Definitely worth buying the cd where its easy to skip certain tracks. If you listen to vinyl you must sit through the bad songs or eff with the needle to skip em. Some of my favorite songs are on this album. Give it a listen.

Well now that I can carry it around with me on my rooted NookColor in between books I am back into my full fledged  plant/zombie addiction!

B004XQO90O|3.0|Captain Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) wakes up inside the body of another man - get your mind out of the gutter, I mean \\"inside\\" like Quantum Leap - he must use his next eight minutes efficiently, because the train he's on is about to explode.  How does he know this?  Well, it turns out Stevens is part of the Source Code, a secret government program that can use \\"parabolic calculus\\" (whatever that is) to fold time and put him into another person's identity.  A little like D&eacute;j&agrave; vu with Denzel except their superior technology had a 4 day window and...actually, it's a LOT like D&eacute;j&agrave; vu.<br /><br />This borderline plagiarism would have been better off using the term \\"velluvial matrix\\" instead of \\"parabolic calculus\\" to explain the technology, because there are numerous problems with the time travel aspects of this film.  For instance, if there is an 8-minute window, and the concept behind the limitations is glossed over, why can't it be 8.5 minutes?  Or 9 minutes?  For something so unknown and unexplained it sure has a strict timeframe.  Second, some of the movements and discoveries while possessing Chicago school teacher Sean Fentress are simply impossible.  If Fentress never did it, he couldn't possibly have the memories capable of supporting Stevens' escapades throughout the train.  What I'm trying to say is, ignore the metaphysical connections because the science is pointless.  Nonetheless, the majority of this film is enjoyable.<br /><br />Gyllenhaal exudes anguish in most roles, which made him perfect for Stevens.  He's unaware, dazed, and rushes through each 8-minute iteration with the gusto of irritable bowel sufferer.  Vera Farmiga, who I normally enjoy, appears to be coasting through her role as the pseudoscience facilitator, giving Stevens helpful guidance along the way (e.g. look for bags, hold on I'm playing Minesweeper).  Although, a more military and scientific approach to finding someone responsible for crimes in a parallel plain of existence would be to simply kill half of the people.  If the event doesn't happen, the culprit is in the dead half.  If it happens, next time around kill half of the left overs.  Divide by two ad nauseum.  Even the terrorist portion doesn't make a ton of sense.  One of the most predictable misdirections in cinema history is created when a Hollywood political slant is subtly inserted.  Ultimately, however, the movie asks more questions than it answers, and an ambiguous ending furthers the confusion.<br /><br />It's fun, well made, and performed well.

B000U0O9FM|2.0|I had never seen the movie pior to starting this novel so I was coming in as a tabula rasa.  I was very excited after hearing about how everyone raves about this novel.  Wow what a lie!  This book has to be one of the most falsely hyped novels I have ever read.  This book was very boring and predictable.  I honestly don't see why everyone thinks this is some kind of genius novel.  I have read other books by this author and this would not be classified as the best one for me.  I seriously think it must be some kind of male thing where all the men think it is pure brilliance because of the concept of starting a fight club.  Well to that I say big whoop!  That is not something innovative and this book was hardly thought provoking.  the only thing I will give kudos to the novel for is the hinting towards questioning the fabric of our society and what it constitutes to be human in America and what might possibly happen if someone were to suddenly stop caring so much.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|I love love love this game.  Graphics are crisp and clear on my Samsung Epic.  However, it's lost my progress twice now...and each time was after I'd beaten the entire game and had unlocked Quick Play mode.  To get it back, I have to beat the entire thing all over again.  Bogus.  About to delete the thing entirely, which is sad because, like I said, I love the game itself.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|had it on iphone, now glad its on android. only downside is updates are slower here than on the market. no big deal though.
B00514HDNW|4.0|Like many I saw the hollywood movie first before I even knew about the novel.  As a an avid reader I know that the novel is often much better than the movie version.  That was certainly the case with I Am Legend!  I think that the movie would have been ten times better if they had not have strayed from the original premise of the novel.  My only complaint was that the novel was so short.

B000000XBC|5.0|Great followup to Chronicle 1. If you cannot afford the boxed set, Chronicle 1&2 are you're best bet. Every song is great.
B004WPYNY8|5.0|Really...I mean I've always liked Symphony X but it wasn't till 'Paradise Lost' when they really blew me away! The added aggression and heaviness combined with the already outstanding musicianship really won me over being a fan of the Nevermore, Iced Earth, Evergrey style of metal.    That said this is even better! Even more heavy and aggressive but still very melodic and dense. Absolutely sick riffs and solos by Romeo! I like how he doesn't lean on the neo-classical basics anymore. This stuff comes from the heart and soul yet is still very expansive and layered!  Romeo deserves to be mentioned in the same breath of Jeff Loomis at this point!    And what more can be said about the amazing voice of Russ Allen!  Already considered one of the finest vocalist in all of metal his performance here might be his absolute best!  His passion, emotion, soul and range are simply incredible!  Other really heavy bands should also take note that you don't have to scream or growl all the time to express aggression in your voice!  Amazing that this guy can sing such awesome aggresive vocals and nail the tender slow parts with more grace than almost any of the top non-metal contemporary type vocalists!     Also the song writing is so perfect it's almost impossible to mention any standout tracks.  Every track is nothing short of amazing even on the bonus disc which is an absolute must!    Album of the Year?? Perhaps the best metal album of all time!!!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I have always been a fan of alien and aliens, but have only been able to watch them at VHS quality. Seeing them at blue ray quality is astounding!

B0034G4P8K|5.0|Slick and badass is a good way to describe the movie. If you have seen the other two movies, you know what to expect: impressive special effects, lots of action, lots of battles with Autobots and Decepticons and much more. The movie didn't letdown in any category.    Story: After the moon expedition in late 60s, Nasa discovers a piece a relic from Cyberton wars in the form of Sentinel prime-the original leader of the Autobots. The Autobots are angry that the earthlings have kept this discovery from them, but greater troubles lay ahead as the Decepticons are also aware of the finding and look to use Sentinel's return for their own advantage.    That's pretty much the gist of it without giving away much spoilers. There's also a side story with Sam Witwicky (Shia Lebouf) again trying to adjust to some normalcy as the quite hero who this time has trouble finding employment. Megan Fox was fired and replaced by Rosie Huntington as everybody knows. People said this would hurt the movie but really it had no effect whatsoever on it. Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson are back to reprise again their roles of Lennox and Epps.     The acting was fine. There was a lot of comedy as well, but when the action starts up, it didn't let up. Once again whether you love or hate Michael Bay you cannot deny that this franchise under his direction has been pretty cool. Yes it's flashy, it's slick, occasionally using some slapstick, but it's fun and entertaining. He knows when to tone things down and then turn the gears on when it's time.     Really that's what you come to expect from a movie like Transformers for a great time and to again recall some nostalgia from your childhood with these live adaptations. All in all a very good effort, no complaints at all. Recommended.
0441013597|5.0|Perfect science fiction. There is absolutely nothing I would change about the book. If you like sci-fi then you MUST buy this book and read it and then read it again!!!
B0034G4ORC|1.0|I lost my time watching this movie and whoever dare to compare this FIASCO with District 9 is WRONG!!!  B:LA is a District 9 wanna be. However you can compare this movie with Black Hawk Down (another Fiasco also)  SPOILER ALERT = SPOILER ALERT =SPOILER ALERT =SPOILER ALERT  (please don't continue reading unless you want to turn in a smart person and skip this movie)  What about every time that Aaron Eckhart have that long pity face doing every other soldier join him, just PATHETIC!!!. C'mon at least pick up some breakfast before you resume the battle, you are not running on batteries. Besides the overreaction of the soldiers celebrating when they succeed every task is unreal: WHO WILL CELEBRATE KNOWING ALL YOUR RELATIVES AND FRIENDS ARE DEAD OR NEAR TO DIE, IS RIDICULOUS. You don't have time, just keep going soldier!  Terrible overactings, very predictable, cheesy, a lack of a story and slow some times.  Save your money, this movie will be on clearance for sure at $5 next Thanksgiving Black Friday or will be included free when you purchase your next Blu-Ray. What a waste of time and money, TRUST ME.
0393330435|2.0|I don't regret reading Steve's account of his childhood and teen years, but the historical accuracy of his claims are a quite far fetched. The book also suffers from being a bit juvenile and highly repetitive, but that is to be expected from an autobiography that was essentially a collection of stories told to the ghost writer over pie (@ the Hickory Pit).    Unfortunately Woz spent too many years listening to Jobs and their early marketing efforts touting the Apple I and II as the first 'real' computers.      To be clear, I do not question his sincerity in his recounting of the tale, it just happens to be wrong.  Other reviewers have covered this in greater detail - the Commodore Pet and the TRS-80 - and the like.    With regards to his departure from Apple and his mythical relationship with Jobs, it does stand to reason that it's far less 'juicy' than what's commonly discussed.  It seems logical that Steve simply got bored and wandered off once the Apple II was fully born and didn't leave as a result of pressure from Jobs.  I believe Steve when he says his motive for writing this book was his attempt to 'set the record straight' about this.  Not unlike his career however, he got excited in describing the minute details of his beginning and then wandered away when he got bored with the story.    Historical accuracy and rampant hyperbole aside, it was still an interesting read and an insight into one of the fathers of the 8bit computing era. Woz is definitely a character and I'm glad he's found some amount of immortality in his cult status.
0596005903|5.0|This book is becoming dated and it is showing sometimes. Some APIs no longer work or have changed but such is the nature of the Linux kernel and as a device driver developer you should be prepared to face this. Thankfully there hasn't been any major change (such as removing of bottom halves) although there are things on the horizon that will have an impact on this books subject. I wish the authors would consider writing a 4th edition of it, but this is as I said still the best on the subject as far as I know and I use it all the time when I'm developing device drivers.
B000FZETIO|4.0|I am a HUGE fan of Pretty in Pink. So of course I was uber excited to see the \\"alternate ending\\" where Andy ends up with Duckie! However, I was somewhat disappointed in that piece from this DVD. It is actually the director and actors talking through the behind the scene filming where you simply see Molly Ringwald and Jon Cryer standing at prom holding hands with the cameras and microphones swirling around them. They repeat these images numerous times while there is commentary to fill the visual space. It was a disappointment as I expected to see an actual scene acted out with the characters. If you expect the same, don't. Otherwise, this is a great DVD to own if you love this movie!
B0045NDVFE|5.0|I was introduced to this group last night. Not being a fan of country I was thinking I was wasting my time. Was I ever wrong! The Band Perry has instantly become my favorite group. \\"You Lie\\" \\"If I Die Young\\" and all the others are great songs. Kimberly and her brothers are gonna be around a long time.
B0021L8V0M|2.0|\\"Salt' is a mess. The plot is either incomprehensible or ludicrous and illogical. The  action sequences are ridiculous , way over the top (What next I thought at one point, is she now going to fly ?)and way too long. Maybe a twelve year old would find it all exciting. I found it a monotonous bore.
B004QIG7CW|5.0|Great movie - kids and adults can enjoy.  Digital version makes this price/package a steal.  The music is the real draw.
B002ZG99TA|5.0|Indeed it is pure action from start to finish.  That is, if you can overlook all the goofs.  And don't take my word for it, go to the  IMDB site for \\"unstoppable\\" and click on link for goofs, the list is endless.  It is a movie for those who want to be entertained and know nothing about railroads, as much of what is depicted about trains and their braking syustems is purely fictional. It is based on a true incident that occured in Ohio, not Texas or Pennsylvania as others have stated.  But in that case, only a locomotive got loose.  The problem starts when an intellectually challenged hostler--played by \\"Randy,\\" the idiot brother of Earl on \\"My Name Is Earl,\\"  lets a train get away.  Denzel Washington and Chris Pine play the two heros who finally stop the train.  It is pure, non stop action and also shows the arrogant and  moronic behaviour of corporate types.  That was the most realistic part of the movie.  It is worth a view but not since \\"Runaway Train\\" and \\"Atomic Train\\" have we had such total b.s. in a motion picture related to trains.
B004SMDJ9U|5.0|Haven is a strong show - 13 episodes set in Haven, Maine.<br /><br />Quickly, you learn that this town isn't normal at all.  The show does a good job of peeling the layers back slowly.  The writers say they have 7 seasons of mythology, and at 13 episodes a season, I would believe.<br /><br />If you like TV that makes you think, this is an excellent show to pick up.  The special features are pretty interesting - the writers talk about Season 2, which sounds great.  They also point out that they do put in a ton of clues in each episode, that do build on each other.<br /><br />The season ending is certainly different.  Be warned, their are characters that will die that you probably like quite a bit.<br /><br />The main 3 characters are pretty strong, but my favorites are the two brothers who run the newspaper.  I would love an episode set in the past featuring more on them.

B0042X9L6A|5.0|This SB-700 is the new \\"legend\\" light and is the best balance between function and price and portability. It is the best balance between SB-900 (which is too heavy and expensive) and SB-600 (whose zoom-range is up to 85mm only and cannot use as a host but only slave). SB-700's recharging speed is very fast, and the new-iTTL/iTTL-BL system works reasonably well and is easier to be select by entry-level users. SB-700's zoom range is 24-120 mm (extensible to 14mm with build-in filter), and on a APS-C DSLR (D50/D60/D3000/D5000/D5100/D80/D90/D200/D300/D7000) it is 21-180 mm and suitable for most cases. If you have a Full-frame camera (D3/D3x/D700) and you like to use flash at 120 mm or longer focus, get yourself a SB-900 instead.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Drama... adventure... action... This book is an amazing work of art. It has made me laugh, it has made me cry. A page turner, no dought. BEST SERIES I HAVE EVER READ! I could not stop reading for 3 days! (That is how good it was)  :)
B000ID1J0E|4.0|This is just a crazy and bizarre movie.  Funny though, and a must watch for anyone wanting something different.
0894803123|5.0|My dad bought this book in the 90s and it was fantastic and it is still fantastic today. You would think that Ben & Jerry would never give away their recipes, but they do. They also include notes and comments on things that worked well and not so well. Fantastic Book.

B004RJZA1E|5.0|Although one album is not enough to begin calling a band a new force in a certain genre, this debut is certainly one of the most impressive of the past few years, and certainly leads me to hope that they will not succumb to mediocrity in their inevitable sophomore effort.  Their approach of three singers with different disciplines is not only fresh and intriguing in theory, it actually works amazingly well in practice. Each singer is A class-- there is no weak link.  The music is brutally heavy and melodic, the guitar work is exhilarating and energetic, the lyrics thoughtful and deft.   If they keep up such phenomenal work, they may very well begin the arduous climb to my personal favorites Kamelot and Epica.   It should come as no surprise that Amaranthe supported Kamelot on one of their recent tours, and their female singer filled in vocals for songs that Simone Simons from Epica had guested on in a few of Kamelot's albums.     In summary, a smashing debut that leaves me eagerly anticipating more.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|I've had this case for two weeks.  It went on perfectly, looks great on my white iPhone, isn't too thick, and provides just enough grip.  Can't beat the price.  I'm ordering another one or two for spares should this one yellow over time.

0062060554|3.0|Tidbits of deeper perception here and there (what is the self, etc) but too much factual manipulation to have a coherent theme. At the end, it seems as if someone clapped their hands and said, \\"ok, wrap it up now.\\"
B001UV4XHY|5.0|For the Potter-file in us all, this was def a movie that to really grasp it, you needed to be a reader. My mom, a fan of the movies, but not of the books, was very disappointed, but I think that if the last movie is anything like the book, she will be in for a nice treat.
0300169787|4.0|I recently went to the show at the MET and couldn't resist to buy this book. The pictures are amazing. I haven't had time to finish it but the quality of the photography alone makes it a great coffee table book and a must have for any fan of this artist.

0545140323|5.0|Penny is tired of boys, always cheating on her or treating her wrong, so she decides to created a club for the lonely people like her. Of course, she never thought so many girls would join her!<br /><br />Penny was such a great protagonist. I admit it, while reading the first chapter I thought I wasn't going to like her, but she manages to became one of my favorites ya protagonists. She actually matures and grows up to be an amazing girl.<br /><br />I couldn't believe some of the things that happened to her, as the principal's disrespect for her club and her or the people (like other girls) being mean to her. But in a way, it's very realistic. People is mean, and still exists people who don't accept girls have power (probably because they are scared). But I loved how Penny managed all of this with the help of her friends and parents.<br /><br />Penny and her family are fans of The Beatles, and the club's name is based on one of their songs. Personally, I love some of The Beatles songs, so I actually enjoyed the references and lyrics on the book. Besides, it was really cool and original for the author to find the perfect song for each chapter.<br /><br />Overall, I loved The Lonely Hearts Club. It's a quick, fun and light read, perfect for when you need a little bit of girl power!

0553386794|1.0|Martin has been compared to J.R.R. Tolkien with his Game of Thrones series.  It would be closer to the truth to compare him to Stephen King.  If you like King's excessive wordiness and meandering story lines, you will like this. Martin introduces a multitude of characters right from the start and, by the time you get to the 4th book, the number of characters has expanded greatly and all but a handful of the heroes you can get behind are dead, with little to no resolution to any of the multitude of plots he introduces.<br /><br />Giving credit where it is due, I do have to say that Martin did a fantastic job of World-building as pertains to the actual world. The story he then places in that world, however, leaves little to be desired.  With fewer characters, a more stream-lined story line, and a lot more true fantasy elements, this could have been a good series.  Instead, it turns out to be  great disappointment and not worth the money to buy.<br /><br />I would suggest by-passing this book and settle for watching the HBO series.
0811875555|5.0|This is very great quality of artbook, full of concept design and pre-production process. If the person who need to be a concept artist for animation film or who need to work in animation industry, must have it to be a reference. LOVE Tangled!
B003UBTX72|5.0|Ok, I'm a big Stones fan. I've seen them in concert several times - and no I'm not 90 years old - I'm not even 40. Ever since I've seen them I thought Keith Richards was amazing. The reason I love them is because their music is so vastly different - there is no song or album that sounds the same - everything is different and ORIGINAL. And naturally, I love the blues influence & could always hear the jazz influence as well in the background. What I didn't realize is how purposeful it is in there, due mostly to Keith. Everyone jokes about how he gets blood transfusions once a year (BTW he comments on in the book) and how he's always high and drunk and how funny it is. Truth is, the man is an actual artist who cares about his music and has some SERIOUS influences throughout his life. He takes his music very seriously and has continuously educated himself on it throughout his life. I was truly shocked. No wonder their music has stood the test of time!     I also liked the fact that the book didn't have a lot of smut in it about him and McJagger's differences (in music or women). There are some, but Keith definitely doesn't dwell on them and almost blows McJagger off as if to say, \\"That's Mick!\\" I was also glad that the book didn't have a lot of information about their flings with groupies or stupid stuff like that. Keith writes about his relationships, and has a few flings, but he writes about the relationships that he has in a serious manner and really only has 2 serious relationships throughout the whole book.    Overall, I thought it was a great read for any music fan - whether your curious or not about the Stones. How Keith talks about his music, how the Stones music was written, and what influenced certain riffs and melodies is definitely worth it! Definitely worth the money!
0307279189|5.0|My husband read this book first and loved it, so I thought I'd read it, too...what a WONDERFUL book!! He does such a wonderful job of intertwining different parts of the story with humor, creative flows and contagious passion. I got pulled into the story so much that I couldn't wait to read what happened next. There's some interesting research mixed in, too, that makes me want to read up more on the topic. When I read the last page I just sat back with a huge smile on my face and a sigh...and thoughts about how to train like him! Possibly the best book I've read this year, I highly recommend it.
B004JN1D2I|1.0|One of the main reasons I started using kindle is price; the whole point of e-books for publishers was reduced cost and better margins. This kind of gouging is a slap in the face for the consumer. E-books can make things better on both sides of the equation or create the convenience store effect; this publisher obviously chose the latter...
0439023513|1.0|The problem with trilogies is that once you've read the first two, it's hard not to read the third, no matter how bad the second was.    Mockingjay was bad enough to make me want to write a review of it.    What was bad?    1. The way the author fills so much space by unceasingly referring back to what has come earlier, even if it was just a few paragraphs earlier.    2. The way the main character keeps telling us, ad nauseum, how horrible she feels about, well, about pretty much everything in the world. She doesn't actually act in ways that demonstrate this, but rather spends hundreds of pages telling us that she feels guilty or confused about the two boys (of which she chooses the least convincing one)    3. The characters are plot-driven. Not the other way around. The main character herself is little more than a paper doll that acts whatever way the she needs to in order to get to the author's destination. The other characters are even less developed.    But most importantly, 4. The way the author takes us right up to the edge of the climax, knocks the main character out, and then wakes her up so that she can give a one-page synopsis of the thing that the entire trilogy had been aiming at. And she does this twice in a row.    So what was good?    It got so bad that I started taking notes, and I was able to build a pretty big catalog of things to avoid in my own writing. Thanks, Suzanne!
0316056863|2.0|Bought this book with much anticipation for a good summer read.  Had to postpone vacation - saved the book I had such high expectations.  Drat.  Not a very good read.

Hope you make some $  You will I am sure entertain me more fully again.
0763644765|5.0|When to ditch the diaper? Only a toddler knows when the time is right, but when the time gets close Potty will be there to encourage our young future potty users along. Go along with Baby as he discovers what it means to go on the potty instead of outside like a dog or in a litter box like a kitty, but on the potty like a big kid. From potty time with book in hand and kitty and doggie napping at his feet all the way to Baby's first pair of underpants. Show your toddler just what it means to lose the diaper and make time for the potty.<br /><br />You name it, we've tried it. Two different potty's, treats, cheerios, m & m's, stickers, many many books, and more. Nearly every trick you can think of to get our dear sweet Turkeybird onto the potty and out of the diaper, but no way. That is, until his little sister picked up this book and took matters into her own hands. Littlebug adores this book, and so do I.<br /><br />In classic Leslie Patricelli form with bold illustrations and a funny story kiddos are introduced to a new world of possibility on their terms. Which is exactly what Littlebug loves about this book. She's recently been on a `me do it!' kick. No more mom stepping in to help with anything, she wants to do it all herself. And I'm actually torn by this. In some ways it's a bit more difficult and takes more time, but in a few weeks I know our world will be completely different and quite possibly much better. And the best thing about all of this is that big brother has taken note and doesn't want to be left behind. So, I'm currently the momma of two potty-training toddlers. Crazy! I blame much of that on this extremely fantastic book!<br /><br />With bright colors, a cute character and a very funny story little ones learn that there is a better way than pooping in a diaper. There's the Potty! Not only, no more diapers, but big kid underpants with all sorts of fun pictures on them. This is the perfect book for toddlers and even those tough-to-train kiddos. By showing what can sometimes be a whole lot of waiting, but a very `big kid' thing to do, toddlers soon realize this may be something worth trying out. Without a doubt this would be my first recommendation when it comes to potty training books for kiddos. A fun story with a great way to teach little ones basics!<br /><br />Originally reviewed & copyrighted on my site, There's A Book.be a whole lot of waiting, but a very `big kid' thing to do, toddlers soon realize this may be something worth trying out.

B0055OK2T0|1.0|I haven't seen a movie this bad in a long time.  If you ever wanted to see \\"Primary Colors\\" meets \\"X-men\\" this is the movie for you.  Best watched with friends to make fun of this garbage.  I would  of taken this movie more seriously if it had starred Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Aniston, with some rom-com gags thrown in here or there.
B0030Y11XS|5.0|Michael Moore is \\"on the money\\" with his assessment of the Wall Street/Bank bail-out debacle. This is an insightful, very funny film.  And...to the crooks who caused the economic meltdown, and the (same) crooks who were appointed to address the problem (and the Obama admin. officials who oversaw this)...yes, We DO want our money back!!!<br /><br />Clearly, the Obama administration is as corrupt as the Bush one was.  And, once more, the American republic bellows in pain, as it slides down into oblivion!!
B001H5X7I4|5.0|Funny thing about this movie, the first time I tried watching it I couldn't have agreed more with people who didn't think there was anything funny about it at all. I just sat there wondering when it was going to start being funny. Finally turned it off at the part where they're dumped in the jungle and the director loses his head. I thought it was a complete waste of time. But the second time I watched it a couple of years later, I must have been in a different mood because I couldn't stop laughing. I thought it was laugh-out-loud hilarious from start to finish, which is more in tune with my usual reaction to anything Ben Stiller. And with Robert Downey Jr. in the mix, I don't know how I could ever have not liked it.
B0006B2A42|5.0|I loved the movie when it first came out. I loved the book. I am glad I now own my own copy. I have not got tired of watching it yet. All my friends who had not seen it before and have watched it agree it is a great movie with a great plot and some interesting twists along the way.
B004UA8D1O|5.0|Sat on the edge of my seat the who.e movie!  Loved watching in 3-D, scenes were beautiful.  A movie worth watching over and over.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|What a great title for this book...Beautiful Disaster!  It is the perfect name and explains the book 100%.  I am absolutely in love with this book.  What a great contemporary romance novel.  You are completely taken on a wild & crazy journey of love!  This book has so many things going on that it is a beautiful disaster.  Abby is a girl with hidden secrets about her past and does not need or want a bad boy like Travis.  Travis is the best bad boy ever!  He is covered in tattoos and muscles!  Whats not to love.  A must read on a rocky love story.  Jamie's best book!  This will be hard to top.
0385523912|5.0|This book was very well written and gives a reader insights into life behind the North Korean communist regime.  The author chronicles the life of defectors and what their lives were like before they escaped to South Korea.  Reading this book has given me a greater appreciation everything the United States has to offer: freedom, the ability to succeed, and simple material possessions that I have taken for granted.  I will never complain again after reading this book. There are so many people who are less fortunate then Americans and this book helped me to see that I am truly blessed and need to be more sensitive to the plight of others.
B000NVIXFK|3.0|There are definitely some nice songs on this album, but there is too much overlay in chorus in Geddy's vocals. Neil Peart is great, but overall this album does not have the quality of the earlier Rush albums, like Hemispheres or Moving Pictures...
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I LOVE this book. I am not that big of a fan of reading but after reading this book i cant seem to find myself to but another book down. I enjoyed this book so much i wouldn't put it down with the exception of work. I didn't even want to go to sleep. I would stay up later than ever to want to read more. If you are looking for something exciting and romantic at the same time I promise you this is the right book for you.<br />I want someone to make a movie based off of this book! I would totally buy it and watch it over and over and over again, like i would with the book. It would be my new favorite movie ever!<br />It's gonna be hard finding another book to match the intensity of this one for me to want to read anything else.

0307595862|5.0|It has been great fun discovering this author and I look forward to reading more of his books. Nesbo is an excellent writer, weaving a complex plot that is creatively presented. There are some unbelievable plot situations but they don't come across as totally ridiculous and Nesbo is a good enough writer to make them seem credible. The violence is not graphically written either but he gives you just enough detail to intensify your imagination. Good character development and very atmospheric as well. My only complaint are the Norwegian character and location names which were sometimes hard to keep straight.
B0040UAYI4|1.0|I purchased this this destroy my wife in Black Ops on PS3. Im a PC gamer and know the keyboard and mouse are superior to controllers so when i saw this adapter I thought I found a way to play console using my keyboard and gaming mouse. I first had to run software on my pc, that was fine. After applying the settings i plugged it into my ps3 and nothing. Spent 4 hours attempting to get it to work. Called the support line and spent another hour setting it up with a help rep. He concluded my keyboard was not compatible. Made a midnight trip to walmart and picked up a 10 dollar keynoard that worked right out of the box. So now im getting game movement. I can move my character but the movement was choppy and unresponsive at times. Did some online searching to attempt to adjust the settings to make it playable. Spent another few hours attempting to get the keyboard amd mouse to a movement that worked. 3 AM i placed it back into the box and sent it back for a refund.
0525423273|5.0|When I saw this book, I immediately thought that I was probably NEVER going to read this. Ever. It wasn't the cover because it isn't bad. It's actually sorta cute. Nope. It was the stupid title. Anna and the French kiss, really? It sounds icky and felt weird telling the people the title. Then I saw all these amazing reviews of it. Almost everybody I knew who read it LOVED it. So of course, I had to read it.<br />This book is AMAZING. Like all books that I love, I'm having a really really hard time describing it. Although I can say it's a pretty freaking amazing love story. And that you're going to wish that you were part of this story. (But I still want to change to the title)(Please?)
0345529057|5.0|The first book starts off slow but stick with it. Theres tons of characters to get to know and it can seem a bit confusing at first, hang in there you'll learn to love and hate them all; then once you thought you knew who you loved and hated Martin throws a wrench in there and makes you hate who you loved and love who you hated! I'm half-way through the third book now but I wanted to let you all know what I thought. Its so hard to find Good adult fantasy, I will be truly saddened when I finish this series. Enjoy!
B002SQ364Q|3.0|Anybody who was alive during Woodstock and knows the music and the stories will<br />be happy to see this movie which point to related stories around the festival.<br />We all know there was these little town that most people did'nt mind seeing all<br />these hippies coming through their town, and that were the magic begun...as the<br />invasion became a sea of people, music and happiness.<br />This movie captures the feeling with good acting from all. I applaud Eugene Levy's<br />for the great actor he is...even after those american pie movie, when he acts,<br />his character becomes truly believable.
0441013597|4.0|Pros: Within this book dwells a story unlike others. For that alone, I could go on for quite some time about how few narratives of greatness we possess, and the strange world that powerful people inhabit, but I think that is known. What really surprised me was how philosophical everything was. The people in this novel all spoke the same language (besides esoteric references) but if they were from different cultures or possessed different ideals, it seemed impossible for them to communicate with one another. The divides of class and culture were so great that the entire universe turned on individual realizations and cunning deeds that took advantage of those without knowledge, which was entirely thrilling for most of the book.    Cons: While some technologies and strange mental forays seemed well placed, others were muddled and awkward. It was readily apparent that the author had not dwelt in the desert - his renowned ecology is wrong on some fundamental points and several episodes of desert survival jarringly bizarre. The survival of people there was at least plausible, and directly resembled the culture of some desert natives, which, along with the assimilation of Arabic words, lead me to believe that Herbert outright appropriated western ideas of middle-eastern culture without experiencing the places first-hand. While this isn't necessarily bad, it did reduce my enjoyment of the narrative in places to the point of disdain. Also, like the Aeneid, it ends abruptly with the death of an opposing champion and no anti-climax.    Summary: You shall not find a story like this one. It has flaws, but it is still far more interesting than most of the other science fiction you'll read. It hinted at a theocratic empire like that of the Warhammer 40,000 Imperium, but was deliberately steered away, and that was an exciting alternative to a future of devout bleakness.    -FW
B001E5FYS8|5.0|All people have their own secret movie. One that they may watch when they are feeling depressed, or one that they watch on a Saturday night or after work one day. It's more than just a movie, or a good story, it symbolizes security, happiness, comfort, and a peaceful state of mind. Man on Wire is now my favorite movie, as I hope it is to many others. Man on Wire is a great picture as it involves almost every emotion: adventure, love, thrill, friendship, determination, loss, victory, and an almost overwhelming, but tasteful theme of sadness. It honestly is the most beautiful movie, as it is perfect.
1400052181|5.0|Rebecca Skloot has addressed an injustice and illuminated a part of medical research history that has hitherto been fuzzy at best.  Henrietta Lacks and her heirs so richly deserve the recognition that this book offers.  The author weaves a tale that could have been bogged down in too much scientific jargon and incomprehensible facts, but instead she artfully creates a story that educates and pulls you in emotionally.   May Henrietta finally rest in peace.
0073398101|5.0|I used this book for a course at my junior year at college and I really enjoyed it. it is the first and hopefully not the last college textbook that i truly enjoy it when reading, its easy to follow up and understand what is written there.
B004VUP8WK|4.0|How easily people forget the album Domination which I find this album is very similar to.  We have people here praising Domination but bashing ILLVD for being experimental and industrial.  If my memory serves me correct Domination had industrial songs and was bashed at one time.  Go back and listen to the songs Hatework and Eyes to see, Ears to Hear.  David's voice sounds exactly the same as on Domination.  Profundis sounds like Ceaser's Palace.  Being a huge fan of Domination, I welcome the return of Morbid Angel and the experiments on this album.  Anyone reading the other negative reviews go and listen to Domination and if you liked the experimental songs on that album then proceed to buy this one.
1416550550|5.0|In all honesty I haven't picked up a book for quite some time, but when \\"The Forgotten Garden\\" found its way into my hands, I couldn't put it down. The style of Kate Morton is easy to read, yet elegant as well. I'm generally a reader that keeps peeking up at the page number to see how far I've gotten since I last picked the book up, but not with this one; I was breezing through before I had a chance. The plot is perfectly-paced and full of intriguing detail. I was deeply interested in the book's tie with fairytales and Eliza's love of nature; my genre of choice is usually fantasy. I was pleasantly surprised. And so, I recommend this to all readers--if you're looking for a great book, you won't regret choosing this one!
B0056BMK6K|5.0|Hi John,<br /><br />I'm a new fan.  I'm also an author.  I read your book in one sitting.  That doesn't happen very often, at least for me.  I even missed dinner.  But it was worth it.  You offered down to earth advice that truly hit home.  In fact, you saved me a ton of dough with your list of don'ts.  I was just about to sign a three-month deal with a major publicity firm.  Whew!<br /><br />Keep up the terrific writing.  You're an inspiration to all of us.  I've followed your story in the news, but I haven't checked out your Donovan Creed series yet.  That'll change tonight when I dive into Lethal People.<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />Richard Bard, BRAINRUSH

B004WJREPO|5.0|C'mon Mac fans. This is an unbelievable album from Paul and it only gets better over time. Why? Because it's so experimental, it's Paul playing all of the instruments, changing his vocals, and going in a whole new direction after \\"Back to the Egg\\". This is defintely a must have for any fan of McCartney and espeially if you want to hear all of the demos/tracks he recorded during this time. I've heard he wanted to release a double album, but Colombia Records said no. Now we get it all REMASTERED!! This package is so worth it just because the extra songs, the book, and DVD's makes a real nice collectors item. Each set is numbered and it's value will defintely go up over time.
B004A8ZX28|5.0|In my opinion, Liam Neeson is a superb actor and in this film he is really amazing for his outstanding performance sided by other great artists. Also, January Kristen Jones is a very beautiful and talented actress who makes you get confused by her very real acting. You never know what's happening indeed. You go through this flick trying to figure out things like in a super puzzle. Lots of surprising things happen and you just can't take your eye off of the screen.

B004WOS3P4|5.0|I think many of these reviews have stated why this album is an instant classic in much better terms than I could. It may be shy of a masterpiece, but just barely especially when compared to the dreck so many pop artists put on the market now. I just want to add how proud I am of David Cook. From almost day one of his tenure on Idol, I felt he was worlds beyond the other contestants in every way possible. I recall after his stunning reworking of Lionel Ritchie's \\"Hello,\\" Paul Abdul saying to him, \\"I believe you are going to be a great, shining star,\\" or words to that effect, and I thought for once she isn't just being ditzy. I agreed completely. And from that point on, he has proved again and again her prophecy correct. With This Loud Morning he fulfills all of the lofty expectations that I (and many others obviously), had for him. Kudos, congratulations, bravo; welcome to greatness, David. We pretty much knew it was in you all along.

B004EPYZPS|5.0|Can you say, \\"E.T.\\" meets \\"E.T.\\"?  Arguably the most E.T. like movie of all time, Super 8 starts up with a bang and runs through every trick in the ET playbook before the first hour is up, then goes back in again and again to expand on the one thing it knows.  That thing is the essential mystery of childhood and how, once we become adults, we lose our innate understanding of aliens from other planets.  Happily for movie buffs, Super 8 tells the story of six brave kids teetering on the brink of adolescence, and sets the story in the late 1970s so we can all identify, even the middle-aged like me.  E.T. showed us a family led by a mother and father, but Super 8 presents the children at risk because their mothers have been snatched away from them by a cruel factory death.  Reading between the lines, smart viewers will notice that only one mother remains, and she is played by Jessica Tuck, the vampire spokesperson from True Blood--what's that saying about motherhood?  I have no idea, but I'm sure that Steven Spielberg's casting is always saying something pertinent, unlike his scripts.  (Next up, Lincoln with Daniel Day Lewis as Abe, and Sally Field, short, sixtyish and moonfaced, as weird Mary Todd.  Everyone's wondering, will Anne Hathaway play Anne Hathaway, Lincoln's first love?)<br /><br />Knowledge is power, summer films say, yet in Super 8 this harmless dictum is severely smashed.  In tracing the fate of the one roll of Super 8 film that accidentally records a horrific train wreck, director JJ Abrams convinces us that somehow this footage, which incidentally shows a monster rising from the wreckage, is going to be important in the denouement.  Like Hitchcock's McGuffins, the footage is presented pictorially as a matter of great consequence, and in addition it becomes a matter about which we the audience know more than the kids on screen.  Lo and behold, absolutely nothing of consequence occurs with this footage and we feel cheated, like children without a mother.  It's a great movie, even with that awful instant nostalgia factor suffusing the whole thing like air freshener.  Aliens with the minds of kids: will Hollywood, will Spielberg, ever abandon this theme?  Not on this earth.great movie, even with that awful instant nostalgia factor suffusing the whole thing like air freshener.

B004OEIL5O|5.0|Third the worst? Not even. I actually prefer this one over the sequel. Of course, the first Scream is the best, but the third one is pretty good. Scream 3 is a very enjoyable movie with a pretty nice cast. If you own the DVD, I say upgrade to the Blu-Ray, which can be bought for a very good price and is worth the upgrade. I bought Scream 3 on DVD for $2.49 New at Second Spin and it was worth it. I bought the blu-ray for only $6 and it is worth every cent. I bought a 2-Disc blu-ray case and placed my DVD copy in it, so I have a combo pack and I got a \\"combo\\" pack for a total of $10. What a bargain! I high recommend the movie. It is funny and scary.
0307477479|4.0|I see from reading other readers' reviews that opinions are sharply split on this novel. Many people loved it, some absolutely hated it. I fall mostly into the first category -- with a couple of reservations.<br /><br />This book is about the inexorable progress of time and what it does to people. We begin as bright-eyed teens with big dreams, few fears and the will to experiment. But we make mistakes -- sometimes fatal mistakes. And then time chips away at our dreams and as we age we begin to come to terms with the fact that most of us are pretty average and do best just grabbing on to a modest chance for happiness.<br /><br />Time is the goon squad of the title. This book does not proceed in chronological order. It jumps back to the 1970s and forward to the near future and lands at various points in between. We meet a group of loosely-linked characters and follow them throughout different points in their lives.<br /><br />Much has been written about the powerpoint at the end of the book. I thought it was clever and inventive -- but like all powerpoints kind of empty. Perhaps that's part of the author's point -- that we are moving away from verbal or written communication -- which is precise yet demanding -- to a kind of multimedia environment which is slick, yet less expressive. And the other point concerns a kid who we never actually meet whose obsession is measuring the gaps in songs -- those moments of silence that punctuate music. As if time can somehow be stopped in those gaps. But of course it can't. The music soon resumes and we gallop on.<br /><br />So this is a clever book, maybe even a profound book. But now the reservation: the author has a maddening way of ripping us away from her characters just when we're beginning to get close. And in doing so, I think she shows them a certain degree of disrespect -- as well as to some of her readers, who like me, actually care what happens to people.
1402714572|5.0|Note: Letter grades are given at the end of my review ranging from A (highest) to F (lowest).     (Sorry, I had to pull this review off Amazon for a few days because I accidentally wrote it on another user's account. I'm also sorry it appears twice. I'm not certain how this happened but I'm unable to get rid of either of my reviews.)    Ye be warned: Treasure Island (Robert Louis Stevenson, 220 pages) may leave you wishing that you were living inside it's brilliantly imagined world. Stevenson's lovingly applied detail in describing people, places and things sucks the reader in immediately, and you'll stick around to experience one of the finest narratives in all of sailing literature.     It is thus unsurprising that Treasure Island's somewhat visual style inspired several similar stories, mostly films. When I first read it, it reminded me of Indiana Jones 4 mixed with Pirates of the Caribbean and a tiny pinch of the Cohen Brother's True Grit adaption. You can sometimes feel the dry humor of the original Office in there too.     The plot involves an old sea dog taking residence in an inn in England, trying and failing to escape his old pirate shipmates, who want the treasure map he has. He dies of alcohol poisoning, and the map is taken by Jim Hawkins, who was owed money by the deceased sailor. Jim and his friends use the map to find an island where pirate gold awaits. The story sounds hokey on paper, but in reality this is the mother of all pirate stories, and it's execution is so flawless any disbelief is quickly and forcefully cast aside.     Treasure Island is much about its characters. There are quite a few of them, and Stevenson manages to juggle them successfully and keep all the balls in the air, if you will. There's a few humorous exchanges from Dr. Livesy and Squire Trewalny, who bicker like Holmes and Watson in Sign of Four; there's of course the infamous rogue Silver, who starts off as a cheery cook only to turn the tables and start hunting for our hero's blood. But the real star of the book is Jim Hawkins, an intelligent young boy (probably about 10-12 years old) who narrates the story and carries it along. Jim is somehow simultaneously funny, smart and a little complicated, a lot like Indiana Jones. In certain scenes, however, he displays moments of self-centered eccentricity, which do wonders to humanize him.     In film adaption and sequels, Jim is often overshadowed by Silver (who, to be fair, is also an interesting character). This isn't true to the spirit of Treasure Island, however, as Jim is largely the star character and rightfully so. He deserves his place next to Jack Sparrow and Indiana Jones as one of the greatest characters to wear a good hat and go treasure hunting. A
B002KSPKRS|5.0|I just got these after owning the previous model, X4's.  sold them to my bro so only cost me a few bucks.  These we noticeably lighter than the X4's.  The ear cups were deeper making for better comfort, especially in longer gaming sessions.  im sure battery life isnt too different, which i was satisfied with.  i like the new cord with inline volume control and mute functions.  It does not come with an AC power adapter, it's meant to be plugged into the xbox for its power.  I prefer the AC adapter, it can be purchased at their website, but i found a generic adapter laying around my house and works the same.

B002E3JVHE|3.0|I purchased this after buying the music of John Williams, a bit of a let down.  Great music in spots, but certain tracks do not belong on a \\"best of\\" style of disk/download.  Gladiator music with and without vocal makes up a bunch of my favorites.
B004EPYZUI|5.0|The extended cut of Sucker Punch adds approximately 17 minutes and 45 seconds of additional footage, and is R-rated.  The extended cut is much darker than the theatrical cut; while not necessarily being more visually explicit, previously implied suggestions are now explicitly overt.  The violence and action scenes have also been extended as well, with two re-inserted battle sequences, one with the orcs at the castle (arterial spurts of green orc blood), and the other with the German World War I zombies.    I don't think I quite understand Snyder's multi-layered metaphorical comparisons between the brothel, asylum, and Baby Doll's fantasy worlds, but I will say that the movie (especially the action sequences) are visually stunning, and the colors beautifully contrasted.  Credit especially to the actresses for their proficient firearms handling (but where exactly did they store all those extra magazines I wonder?).  However, it would be superficial to suggest that Sucker Punch is only about girls in anime costumes fighting monsters in fantasy worlds, though that is certainly an interpretation shared by many critics who panned the movie.    Here are the main differences between the Extended Cut and Theatrical Cut; NOTE, SPOILERS FOLLOW, so continue reading at your own risk.      (1) Baby Doll shoots at the stepfather a second time (as compared to a single time in the theatrical cut), resulting in some CG blood and an arm bullet wound, which the stepfather grabs at.    (2) When Sweet Pea first meets Baby Doll (with Blue and the priest), Sweet Pea says, \\"the priest brought you here from the orphanage to lose your virginity, right?\\".  Then Blue says, \\"The High Roller is coming in 5 days to do a little flower picking..\\"  There is no such comment about deflowering in the theatrical cut.    (3) Rocket takes Baby Doll on an extended tour of the nightclub, showing her a backstage area where clients are not allowed.  She shows Baby Doll the cleaning closet where new girls are assigned cleaning duties.  They pass by the kitchen where the chef makes a lewd face at the girls, who ignore him, and walk onwards.    (4) Full dance number of \\"Love is a Drug\\" as performed by Blue & Vera.  It's quite extravagant.    (5) The cook attacks Rocket more violently and physically in the extended cut.      (6) The backstage scene where Baby Doll explains her plans is extended.  Vera writes the order of the dancers, with Sweet Pea performing first.  Rocket and Sweet Pea then sit down, and Sweet Pea tells Rocket that she won't help Baby Doll.    (7) In the World War I scene, the Wiseman briefs the girls for a little longer.  The map they are to capture is a map of the trenches and troop locations, the map will be sent via courier by zeppelin.  The Wiseman then asks Amber how she likes the mech, to which Amber replies in the affirmative.  The Extended Cut includes a great shot of the girls slowly walking out of the fog into no man's land, and additional shots of zombie German troops rushing out of their respective trenches.  Amber shoots down several attack German fighters before herself flying skyward, and Blondie grabs her Daewoo K3 and mows down a horde of attacking zombies, littering the battlefield with their corpses.  There is additional hand-to-hand and (hatchet-to-bayonet vis a vis Blondie) combat in the trenches, and Baby Doll fights the Zombie commander initially in an extended sword fight.  I'm glad they extended the WWI sequence, it looks fantastic.    (8) Vera tries to cheer up Baby Doll pre-performance with a quote by Mark Twain about illusions.    (9) The orc/castle/knight siege scene has been heavily extended, most prominently featuring a new scene of the girls jumping into the courtyard, and decimating the orcs using firearms and edged weapons, while performing various acrobatic maneuvers.  Green orc blood spray across the screen.  Additional shot of knights trying to break through the gate with a tree trunk.  Extended combat scene of girls versus knights, and slow-motion scene of Blondie firing the side machine gun.    (10) Blue tells Baby Doll that he will \\"pop that smile right off of her face\\", whereas in the theatrical cut, he falters without completing the sentence.    (11) The sequence where Amber is killed shows Blue's gun being fired twice, rather than the slight vibration in the wine glass.  Blue shoots Blondie when she's on the ground an additional time.  Nothing graphic is shown.    (12) Blue attacks Baby Doll for a longer period of time (and more physically) in the extended cut, when backstage.    (13)  After Baby Doll is knocked unconscious, Sweet Pea steals a white dress while on the lam.      (14) During the last, infamous scene between the High Roller and Baby Doll, white gloved hands undress Baby Doll down to her skivvies.  High Roller and Baby Doll talk, and High Roller doesn't just want to deflower Baby Doll; rather, he wishes to grant her freedom from everything, in essence, granting her absolution.  Baby Doll seems quite taken and the two begin to kiss passionately, but no nudity is shown.  The Extended Cut directly links Baby Doll's deflowering in the brothel to her lobotomy in the real world; I can understand why this scene was cut to make the PG-13 rating, as it's rather sexually suggestive.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|I'd been avoiding Temple Grandin until about a month ago when I was asked to review the latest edition of her excellent book. Temple is arguably the foremost authority on Autism and Aspergers in the world - and as such, I guess that she's the \\"spoiler queen\\".<br /><br />I guess I approached the Temple Grandin movie expecting a typical Hollywood sob story. I certainly wasn't expecting the depth of concept and directness of story that I got. This is a movie that tries to take the viewer and put them in an autistic person's shoes.<br /><br />In this endeavor, the movie largely succeeds. When Temple walks into a room, we know what scares her. We hear the sounds which overwhelm her and we see the images which flash before her eyes. Her motivations are clear to us and parents of children on the spectrum may find themselves looking at their children's behavior through new eyes. You'll be thinking about the movie long after it ends.<br /><br />Claire Danes has done an excellent job and is completely unrecognisable as the girl from Romeo+Juliet or Terminator 3. In this film, she IS Temple. She has the voice, the mannerisms and look and the walk. It's an impressive and brave performance which takes the viewer far from the glitz of her previous work.<br /><br />The story starts more or less as Temple leaves school. It covers some of her early life via flashbacks and moves forward only a few years with only glimpses of the future. This makes for a strong and coherent narrative but in some ways it's also a missed opportunity. I'd have loved to have seen more of Temple's childhood and in particular the ways in which she overcame her inability to speak.<br /><br />Ultimately, like Temple's real life, this is a story about being the best that you can be, about bravery in the face of adversity and the power of positive parenting.<br /><br />Everyone with any connection to autism simply must watch this film. It's an inspiration not only to parents and to people on the spectrum but also to teachers. It clearly demonstrates the power that positive teachers and mentors have to inspire and to change lives.r that positive teachers and mentors have to inspire and to change lives.
B004H8GLXQ|5.0|There is so much I could say about this novel. It is another bargain book I scrounged up for a few dollars, a pick based purely off positive reviews. Those reviews I did not read mind you, I often like to go into a novel knowing as little as possible. Awful little excerpts on the back often reveal more than the first chapters. I looked at the mass quantities of 5 stars and swiftly added it to my cart. That being said, it was not the genre of fiction I am prone to buying. Gothic novels, I thought they had gone out of fashion long ago. I am quite, quite pleased Diane Setterfield does not follow trends.     In following my own preferences, I will not reveal much of a plot other than Margaret Lea an amateur biographer is called upon by the prolific writer Vida Winter to finally set the record straight. I think I was so drawn to the character of Margaret because I found her so personally relatable. Is it not obvious that I am an avid? That I would love to spend my days reading or dabbling in a bit of writing? Perhaps not, but this is a trait Margaret and I share. I long to be like her, within means, and own a lovely bookshop, nestled in my own private alcove. I am envious of that aspect of her life, and horribly so.    There are no words that I could pen to express the brilliance of Diane Setterfield's own writing, her skill far surpasses any I could hope to have. Each word was a treat, every sentence something to savor. Her plot twists were divine, her imagery vivid, her characters expressive. I wish to read more of her work, surely the success of this novel will warrant it. Snatch The Thirteenth Tale up quickly, it wont be discounted long.
B000MD9UJC|4.0|Negatives: The instructions (four wordless diagrams crammed onto one side of a 1.5\\" x 2\\" yellow sheet) were very poorly done. Secondly, I didn't like the switch- the pushbutton was mushy, it felt cheap, and it resulted in intermittent operation, so I didn't use it. The range of beam adjustability from flood to spot is reduced a bit, but is still fairly adequate. The LED leads need to be forced in pretty hard during assembly, I was concerned I would break the LED or bend the leads.  Positives: At $8, this is less than half the price of the similar LED upgrade kits for 2-AA maglites. Compared with the stock incandescent bulb, this LED is MUCH brighter- absolutely no comparison.  In conclusion, if you're looking for an inexpensive upgrade for your incandescent maglite, and you don't care about the switch, this is a pretty hard bulb to beat.
B004LWZW24|1.0|OK, just another quickie here. All that's really required is a sentence-long synopsis: This is \\"Poltergeist\\" without the special effects, cast with really crappy actors. If that's your bag, rip away and chew through the stale contents to your bloated guts' contentment.
B002VJ0576|4.0|If your idea of Sherlock Holmes adheres only to a strict visualization of the stories as written by Doyle then you aren't going to like this movie.  But if your Holmes has a little wiggle room to be young or old, manic or calm, brooding or almost affable, then you might look upon it as a guilty pleasure. I will dwell on the positives.  It moves quickly so we were never bored.  The chemisty between Holmes and Watson is well done. Their relationship is close without being slashy.  Much of it takes place outdoors, eliminating the claustrophobic feel of limited funds for sets. The music is lively, pleasant. There's a lot of humor, especially in the banter between Holmes and Watson. And well, yes, there's a dinosaur, and other assorted mechanical monsters and contraptions (think Wild Wild West movie) if you like your fantasy on the surreal side. I liked it. It's got a heart, as another reviewer noted. I would much rather see a sequel of this than one of the Guy Ritchie film.

0345472322|2.0|I was extremely disappointed by this book. I first heard about it a couple of years ago and then saw it highly recommended in the book Switch, which prompted me to purchase it. I tend to enjoy books on popular psychology, Malcolm Gladwell, etc. In particular I enjoy it when an author distills research into a particular area into specific actions I can apply. One would expect this might be such a book, given that it is written by an apparently eminent social scientist who has also written for The New Yorker (perhaps my favorite magazine).    What I found instead was a quite poorly structured, anecdotal collection of assertions about mindset. She only alludes to her research in the most passing fashion, often as a paragraph mixed up with a second-hand story about John McEnroe or some other celebrity. She never really defines mindset in any rigorous way, merely assures us that it is distinct from other traits that may also be significant, and it seems she has decided that once mindset is \\"the answer\\" it becomes her lens for viewing the world - hence she sees it everywhere. She applies it in a sweeping fashion to people, often famous, that she clearly hasn't met or studied with any rigor at all, and in the end I gave up, frustrated and bored. It felt a little like \\"an academic's idea of a self help book\\" - don't bother the little people with the detail, they will trust you, amd keep them entertained with lots of inspiring stories of how mindset gets you through. But really, \\"where's the beef?!\\"     What did I hope for? Well, how did she come to think of mindset as a distinct trait? What studies did she conduct? What emerged? How did she come to define mindset? What are some examples? And most of all, how specifically did she help people improve their mindset? What are the specific factors that help? What doesn't?     I was so disappointed by this that I asked for a Kindle refund - I must say I am delighted this service exists, for exactly this reason. I suppose I couldhave soldiered on to the bitter end through the rambling prose and subjective assertions, but my mind was made up.    Here's how to save yourself ten bucks or so: Be determined. Whatever you believe, you can achieve. Whether you think you can or think you can't, you're right. And a thousand other business cliches. Good luck!
B004VUP8WK|1.0|Before I kick off this review for the album, I'd like to say that while Morbid Angel certainly wasn't a perfect band (\\"Domination\\" and \\"Heretic\\" were pretty mediocre albums, but the rest ranged from really good to godlike), I felt for many years a certain comfort that Morbid Angel would never release such mainstream drivel that would be on par with such pathetic artists like Marilyn Manson and Disturbed.  After the disappointment that was \\"Heretic,\\" the death metal community rejoiced once David Vincent came back in the band and we all waited for the ultimate comeback album from such a huge name in death metal.  It was a long wait, and all we got out of that wait was one of the most laughable albums ever released by a veteran death metal band.  It was eight years between \\"Heretic\\" and \\"Illud Divinum Insanus,\\" and given how horribly lazy and awful this album sounds, it's like they waited until the night before the album's launch date to make the album.<br /><br />BAD EXPERIMENTATION<br /><br />Experimentation has been a signature quality for Morbid Angel since they released the godlike \\"Altars of Madness,\\" and while some of it went a little south, the band's past mistakes look like mosquito bites compared to this curse upon the death metal community.  This time around, Morbid Angel thought it would be a great idea to mix metal with industrial music.  This isn't breaking any new ground as there was quite a few metal bands that did this in the early 90's (most notably Fear Factory's \\"Fear is the Mindkiller\\" remixes and Godflesh's \\"Slavestate\\").  I'm also not against the idea because I really like old-school industrial, whether it be the filthy and grungy monolithic slabs of crushing terror in Godflesh's \\"Streetcleaner\\" and their electronic yet percussive nightmare that is \\"Slavestate,\\" to the dark, dance-inducing and abstractly poetic soundscapes of Skinny Puppy's \\"Bites\\" and \\"Too Dark Park.\\"  The problem with \\"Illud Divinum Insanus\\" is that the fusion of metal and industrial was done horribly.  Instead of sounding something like notable Godflesh songs such as \\"Christbait Rising\\" and \\"Someone Somewhere Scorned\\" or the Deep Dub Trauma Mix of the Fear Factory song \\"Scumgrief\\" (which are all pulverizing and daunting), the industrial-flavored songs on this album sound like Marilyn Manson and Static X leftovers flavored with some death metal elements.  Did Morbid Angel forget that a good deal of their fans started listening to them to GET AWAY from such mainstream garbage, so what makes them think we'd listen to an album that sounds a lot like such vomit?<br /><br />THE BAD SONGS<br /><br />The album starts off pretty decently with a typical Morbid Angel synth intro named \\"Omni Potens,\\" but there will be very few peaks when that ends, for we go on with \\"Too Extreme!\\"  Nope, that's not a joke to get people riled up, that's really the name of the song, and what a terrible song it is.  Like the back catalog of such mainstream tripe like Marilyn Manson, there's canned start-stop rhythms and lame electronic backgrounds and mind-numbing lyrics that even feature Vincent growling in Spanish, and yes, it's them bragging about how \\"extreme\\" they are.  \\"Destructos vs the Earth/Attack\\" sounds like a Sailor Moon fanfiction if the author decided to shoehorn an anti-human theme into it, and given that Trey Azagthoth loves Sailor Moon, I wouldn't be surprised if he spent a weekend watching that anime nonstop and decided to pen a song from it.  The song itself sounds like a dumbed-down marching anthem, with some start-stop garbage and lame chantings.  This is all you get in that song, don't expect any blastbeats or the amazing guitar solos Morbid Angel is famed for.  Then there's the disaster known far and wide as \\"Radikult.\\"  First of all, did they honestly try to cash in on Linkin Park's gimmick of really bad spelling?  Second, the song starts off with what's either \\"Kill a cop\\" or \\"Killa cult,\\" regardless of which it is, it sounds laughable (especially the former, as it's nothing like Morbid Angel).

Songs like \\"Existo Vulgore,\\" \\"Blades for Baal,\\" \\"Nevermore,\\" and \\"Beauty Meets Beast\\" are bittersweet reminders to us of what Morbid Angel's signature sound is and what the whole album should have been.  \\"Beauty Meets Beast\\" is a delightfully sleazy track that's more on the midpaced side of things, but has some exquisite guitar work and ear-grabbing riffs.  \\"Nevermore\\" is probably the most favored track by fans, and for good reason, as this is the best song on here.  This is the fast-paced and technically-accomplished death metal brutality Morbid Angel does best, with the brutality taking the forefront coupled with diverse and well-written dynamics.  The four songs I just mentioned in this section are really the best songs on this album, and if you're a \\"lemons into lemonade\\" type of person, can be a glimmer of hope that Morbid Angel will drop that techno drivel in their next album and write songs akin to the four good ones listed here.<br /><br />FINAL WORD<br /><br />This is easily Morbid Angel's worst album, and given how it ultimately destroyed this notion that David Vincent was a better fit for the band than Steve Tucker, I hope it makes those cynical of Tucker to check out \\"Formulas Fatal to the Flesh\\" and \\"Gateways to Annihilation,\\" which not only decimate this album in terms of quality, but also gives an appreciation for Tucker's presence in the band in the past.  Never in my life as a death metal fan would I have imagined that Morbid Angel would fall so hard.

0061914177|4.0|I've read the book and I've read the negative reviews and I'm not afraid to say that I liked this book and I've used the methods Gary talks about to increase my visibility and my business. I don't recommend it to \\"everyone\\" because it isn't that kind of general appeal book, but I do recommend it to internet marketers who are looking to build a long time sustainable business.    I don't see this as a beginner's guide to internet marketing or brand building unless you're a savvy beginner. If social marketing is something new to you, then this book should serve as an inspiration to get started down that road and take some action! Once you have your properties in place and you start creating your content, you will want to revisit the book for all of the action points.    The problem with Gary's actions points is that they aren't labeled as such in the book and so it appears that many are overlooking them and complaining about the lack of a concrete methodology. The methodology is there; it's just so simple that people gloss over it.    You have to show up every day and put in the time and effort. All of this stuff is a lot of work. Tons and tons lot of work and Gary makes that clear, but how many who read this book really put in the time necessary to do exactly what he recommends?    As Gary says, you have to search out and find every conversation you can on your topic of expertise and join into those conversations. That's an easy concept to grasp, but it isn't meant to be a concept, it's meant to be an action step.    So if you're new to internet marketing and you need someone to guide you step-by-step through an extensive process, then this book isn't for you. But if you're bringing enough to the game that you're able to grab the ball and run with it, then I heartily recommend this book to inspire you to get up and take action and to remind you of what, exactly, you should be doing.    To put this into well understood internet marketing terms, this book is a recipe for building authority and anyone who knows anything about building a successful internet business knows how important it is for you and your site to be seen as an authority on your subject.    Which leads me to my last and most important point, the one that I think is most often overlooked or misunderstood by the negative reviewers. Passion. If you don't have passion, then Gary has nothing to offer you. If you don't actually have anything that excites you and that you love to discuss with others, then it's game over for you for this particular style of internet marketing. There are other ways to make money on the net, but if you'd actually like to spend your time working on something you really care about (and there is something you really care about) then this is the book for you.    You can Crush It!
030746363X|2.0|If you've been working out for a while, my bet is you'll find this book is more entertaining than informative. The 'four hour body' is based on research done by Aurthur Jones in the 1970's - yes, the 1970's. It's based on high intensity training, or HIT as it is commonly known. Some people swear by this type of training, I've had limited success with it, but the point is it's all over the internet for free. Just Google 'Colorado experiment' and save yourself some cash. The same with his diet - it's kind of a weird Atkins hybrid - low carb with beans. Increase your bench press - use periodization, another workout protocol that has been around forever. Increase your testosterone? Eat more fat and throw in a few vitamins. Drinking cold beverages and being in the cold increases your metabolism - nothing new there.     So if your library has a copy, just borrow it, read it, return it and be grateful you didn't spend any money. That's what I did.
B002ZG976U|4.0|If you are looking for a film with the jaded urban sexiness of [[ASIN:B00005JLSE Chicago]] or the visual pyrotechnics of [[ASIN:B000077VR3 Moulin Rouge!]], Steve Antin's tame production of [[ASIN:B002ZG976U Burlesque]] will certainly disappoint (it may be the most 'G-rated' PG-13 film you'll ever see). But in it's own wacky way, the film manages to circumvent logic (in much the same manner as the epically bad [[ASIN:0792844882 Showgirls]] did), and is actually quite entertaining (which the earlier film certainly wasn't!).<br /><br />The credit for the film's success goes equally to Antin's \\"Aw, shucks!\\" screenplay, which turns 'The Burlesque Club' into a family-friendly [[ASIN:B0000524E5 Coyote Ugly]] with the female bartenders now strippers (who never get close to getting naked), Cher, who takes a small role (forget top billing), and plays the hell out of it (her voice is fabulous, and she looks great, even with puffy lips), and Christina Aguilera, who combines her astonishing singing voice with the youthful enthusiasm of an original cast member of [[ASIN:B0032JTV74 Glee: The Complete First Season]]. It's not a performance that wins Oscars, but she's far more likable in her screen debut than Britney Spears was, in [[ASIN:B00005JKWM Crossroads]]. The rest of the cast pales beside the two divas; Kristen Bell plays the stereotypical \\"witch with a 'b'\\" (in place of the 'w'), Julianne Hough is nearly unrecognizable in heavy make-up, Cam Gigandet is the bartender/boyfriend who acts gay but isn't, underused Alan Cumming is a club host who is gay, and does a Joel Grey/[[ASIN:B00009Y3L4 Cabaret]] send-up musical number; always terrific Stanley Tucci is wasted as Cher's bisexual second-in-command, Peter Gallagher is even more wasted, as Cher's overwrought business partner, and Eric Dane takes on the thankless Kyle MacLachlan role from [[ASIN:0792844882 Showgirls]], as the attractive but sleazy millionaire who can talk the talk, and wants poor Christina to sell her soul to him (don't worry, she doesn't). Truthfully, the film is all Christina, and Cher, when she's onscreen. And it works!<br /><br />I admit, it's a guilty pleasure, but I enjoyed [[ASIN:B002ZG976U Burlesque]]!t worry, she doesn't).

B004S9OUDW|3.0|As a past Corrs fan, I cannot recommend this solo album from Andrea Corr, Lifelines.  It consists of eleven mostly bland covers that typically served only to make me wish for the original songs.  That's partly because these covers are often worse than the originals, with examples such as a slightly less enthusiastic version of Tracey Ullman's \\"They Don't Know About Us\\" (stripped of the original's fun '60s \\"girl group\\" throwback element).  So many of the covers just seem unnecessary, like the cover of John Lennon's \\"No. 9 Dream.\\"  It's just a bad idea to do an easy-listening version of that classic tune!  Still, if you feel like you want to have a few songs from this album, a couple of slow songs at the end of the album are not too bad, covers of tunes by Ron Sexsmith and Daniel Johnston.  Those covers are better because she is singing less familiar songs, so she can put a bit of her own slant on the material without the long shadow of the original being cast over it.

0848833031|4.0|I seem to be one of the very few who has read 'Darkly Dreaming Dexter' and has not watched 'Dexter' on television (..too cheap to get cable/satellite!), and so this review judges the book solely on its own merits rather than as any sort of comparison.  Does the book stand well on its own merits?  Yes it does.  The story is told in the first person (by Dexter) and we get to feel all the turmoil in his twisted mind.  Dexter, a homicidal do-gooder lab technician on the Miami-Dade police department, is clearly abnormal on many levels.  But the author portrays him in an endearing fashion, which makes the book work.  The author also does well with involving some rather curious supporting characters (other members of the police department).  Oh, and I do like is rather sardonic take on life in Miami.  Yet, ... this is not a great book.  In his effort to have the reader fully understand/appreciate Dexter the author tends to put too much into Dexter's internal ramblings.  A little less talk and a little more action would have been better.      Bottom line: a humorously grisly sort of read.  Recommended.

0553593544|5.0|Robert Ludlum is a new author to me. Recently I just went through this book, mainly because I enjoyed the movies so much! In short, my review is I could not put this book down! I was left captivated by every chapter, paragraph, and even sentence. The story was extremely well written, so much so that I wish the movie had not deviated from it as much as it did. The author sucked me into this book by creating a mystery around the character of Bourne. In the beginning of the book I did not know whether Bourne was, in fact, a good or bad character. This is exactly what the author intended to happen, evident by Bourne's own internal question over his character. When it was finally discovered that he was a good guy, I was so relieved as if I was Bourne myself! I have become quite fascinated over the character of Jason Bourne due to his Christ-like nature. Now, before people label me a heretic, let me explain.<br /><br />Bourne is clearly a Christ-like figure due to his self-sacrificial attitude. He saved Marie from being brutally raped and killed, risking his own life in the process. Furthermore, we learn that Bourne paid the ultimate sacrifice for the entire country, and even world, by becoming Jason Bourne, the feared assasin and rival of Carlos the Jackal.<br /><br />If you want excitement, entertainment, and to become enraptured by a specific character, this book will not dissapoint.

One little annoyance, the details card that is on the back of the package also runs under the cover and is sticky down there so you have to pull that off to get the box set out of the case. Sill, annoying and possibly damaging to the packaging if you want to keep it nice.    But apart from that its great the sound is good to.
B004K4GDE4|5.0|The overall product is awesome.     It's 2 vinyls, with four sides. It includes all 14 of the regular version songs, plus the three that are on the deluxe edition. When you open the vinyl you see the GaGa-bicycle that is the cover of the original 14 song version album. The back as the picture of GaGa learning over with the tracks listed as they appear on the sides of the vinyls.     The labels are pretty bland though, nothing like what's on \\"The Fame\\" labels. The sleeves have listed on them \\"This is for ü with the heart around it, assuming you know who she is talking about (her boyfriend/ or more?) ...    I haven't spun it yet, but assume the quality will be good as what the Fame and The Fame Monser is. Also, I assume that its censored, just like the Fame Monser vinyl is, with the infamous bleeps on this record like the song Government Hooker.    About the quality of the music, it is good. I have heard the music, all except The Queen and am in love with every single song!     If you are a GaGa fan, a little monster :P you should enjoy this if you have a turntable.
B003Q6D1YW|3.0|This movie was blatantly falsely advertised as a thriller, but it is a documentary about cyber relationships, more specifically about how our desire for intimacy manifests itself in this age of social networks.     Even though it's a documentary, it still has a tinge of implausibility to it. The story opens with Niev's unlikely correspondence with a bright, child artist. The girl, a fan of Niev's photography, sends him painted renditions of his work. He first befriends Abby's mom Angela, then her entire family including her father, brother, and half-sister Megan with whom he has a romantic connection.     I knew what happened before I watched the movie, so perhaps that knowledge biased my viewing, or maybe I'm just excessively cynical, but I found it a bit narcissistic that Niev never found the situation suspicious. Why would her entire family take such an active interest in him? The \\"facebook family\\" a he dubs them, are all so pitch-perfect, talented and just plain neat, it comes off as contrived and disingenuous. Despite being perpetually drunk on attention, Niev, in a rare moment of reflection and common sense, decides to fact check some of Angela's incredible stories.    He, his brother and friend drive hundreds of miles to confront Angela and discover the truth about her and her family. Interestingly enough, this narrative shift also strips away whatever sympathy the viewer may have felt toward the protagonist. He morphs from the victim to the aggressor, with no concept of how his decision may impact this stranger.     However uncomfortable the situations and affected the characters, there is a sincere and bittersweet resolution that makes the film worthwhile and engaging. In this case, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.  Despite its flaws, this movie is relevant, and unique.
B0025VLELQ|5.0|It is amazing to watch movies like this, the ones I grew up watching. Though they tend to be a bit 'formatic', it's hard not to enjoy them. The Last Starfighter is one of the classic 80's sci-fi flicks that made watching movies all the more fun. What really impressed me was the Blu-ray transfer.<br /><br />The picture quality is phenomenal and the 5.1 audio track is quite nice as well. The presentation shows off all the minor details that I had forgotten about: alien costumes, ship designs, and the sweeping soundtrack. I simply was not expecting the film quality. If you're a fan of the movies of the 80's and have a good sound system, you'll love hearing the lasers firing all around, ships screaming as they accelerate to make hair-pin turns....<br /><br />There is a fair amount of bonus features as well; I'll be updating this review once I watch it all. I can't see it lowering my enjoyment of the Blu-ray.
1594202842|5.0|I've read quite a few of the reviews on this book and I think that everyone is just taking it way too seriously.  If you don't like it, fine, just say why.  It seems most of the \\"reviews\\" have turned into \\"rants\\".  I thought the book was extremely well written.  It just flowed and I couldn't even find stopping points to put it down.  Do I agree with every bit of her parenting style? no.  I think even the book itself shows that not one parenting style works for every child.  But I LOVED the idea of believing in what your children can do and become instead of being afraid they might fail.  For me, that's what I really took away from this: to believe in my daughter's potential and always challenge her to test her limits and who knows what she'll be able to accomplish.

I don't normally write book reviews, but I just loved this book, I wanted to share how great it was! The ending had to be my favorite, and had me wishing it wasn't over! It had a plot twist that I just did not see coming!    I would recommend this book for anyone to read if you love a good thriller. You won't be disappointed, I certainly wasn't!

B003UESJEM|3.0|The Company Men was a sobering watch, and though it is not without its flaws, the excellent cast makes this a worthwhile watch. The movie focuses on a couple of white men holding white-collar jobs and how the economic downturn affects them and their personal lives. Bobby Walker (Ben Affleck) plays a hotshot executive at a major corporation and at the beginning of the movie appears to be living the American dream - he owns a McMansion, has a Porsche, a stay-at-home wife, and two kids, oh, and a country club membership. Walker's world comes crashing down when he is laid off as part of his company's downsizing. He spends a third of the movie in denial, arrogantly assuming he will be re-employed in no time, refusing to downsize his life of luxuries (snapping at his wife when she refuses to pay the overdue country club membership), and basically refuses to accept the new reality of his life. His practical wife on the other hand goes back to her nursing job and convinces Walker to sell the house and move the family in with his parents to save costs. A large chunk of the movie deals with Walker's coping during this tough period, and how he eventually comes to accept his circumstances. Kevin Costner plays Walker's builder bro-in-law, Jack Dolan, who despite his own financial difficulties, reaches out to help his sister's family.<br /><br />Then there's Gene McClary (Tommy Lee Jones) who is at loggerheads with friend and company CEO, James Salinger (Craig T. Nelson). Salinger embodies corporate greed, choosing to lay off as many workers as he can to satisfy his stock holders and maintain his 22 million salary. When McClary is inevitably let go, the former top executive does some deep soul-searching about where he wants to go next. Another company man, Phil Woodward (Chris Cooper) does not fare as well. In his fifties and set in his ways, Phil takes the lay-off the worst - he is at his wits' end trying to figure out where he fits in the world, given that all his working life has been devoted to Salinger's company.<br /><br />The movie is not without flaws. Walker is portrayed as earning 160 K, and yet has this lavish lifestyle. In reality, that salary would never be able to afford Walker such a luxurious lifestyle in the Northeast (the writers may need a reality check here). Then there's the weak sub-plot of McClary (Tommy Lee Jones) having an extramarital affair with the HR lady (Maria Bello). There is no real credibility in this relationship and their intimate scenes fall flat and cold.<br /><br />However, the movie is sobering because it shows how even the upper middle class did not remain unscathed by the downturn, and serves as a wake-up call of sorts. Walker's character undergoes a sort of evolution as the movie progresses, learning the familiar lessons of sacrifice, endurance, perseverance, compromise, and above all, about what really matters. It also shows how some families learn to survive despite the odds, and some crumble in the face of difficulties. It was not a pleasant watch, but the strong performances by the three main actors makes this a compelling movie.devoted to Salinger's company.     The movie is not without flaws.

B0050CQY1W|4.0|Each time Beyonce comes out with a new album us men cringe. She has made songs kicking us to the left, demanding we put a ring on it and now she's telling us who runs this. That alone should make me want to give this album a bad review. But I have to remember that its just music. And as a reviewer I have to put my testosterone aside and listen. This album is adequately titled \\"4\\" of course meaning this is her fourth album. After the disappointment I had with her last album \\"I Am...Sasha Fierce\\", I tried to listen to this album with fresh ears. And it worked.<br /><br />The problem I had with her last album was there was too much nonsense going on. Her slow songs were weak and tired and her up tempo songs, which she is known for, were not better than any of her previous recordings. I was more impressed with \\"B'Day\\" (Deluxe Edition not the regular one) Beyonce starts this album off with the Etta James-esque \\"1+1\\". Most singers don't start their albums off with a slow song and I can see why. The song brings the mood of the album down too early. Its like a sprinter who gets off the block a second too late. They can still win but they have to work a little harder. She picks up the pace a little on \\"I Care\\". She resurrected legendary hitmaker Kenny \\"Babyface\\" Edmonds to produce \\"Best Thing I Never Had\\". Then she's hits her stride with the Kanye West produced \\"Party\\" ft Andre 3000. This is my favorite song on the album it reminds me of \\"Green Light\\" by John Legend. It should be her next single. \\"Rather Die Young\\" is another gem. She loses gas on songs like \\"Start Over\\" & \\"I Miss You\\". But she gains momentum on \\"Countdown\\". The slow song \\"I Was Here\\" is too confusing. It sounds like it should be on Sasha Fierce. She closes the album with the overhyped \\"Run This World (Girls)\\". I'm glad its at the end so I wont have to waste my time pressing the skip button.<br /><br />Beyonce has managed to finally put an album together that blends all her different styles together. This is a more mature \\"Dangerously In Love\\". She has dumped that bubblegum Destiny Child style and grown into her own. Like Janet Jackson of the 80's, B is in control. She will never have a voice like Jill Scott or Marsha Ambrosious, but she may surprise you from time to time. What you will get from her is at least three radio hits that are guaranteed to be played all day long.  And as long as she is around, we as men will be trying to shut their overhyped women up. (But it wont work)..jkDangerously In Love\\". She has dumped that bubblegum Destiny Child style and grown into her own. Like Janet Jackson of the 80's, B is in control.

B000YF86JS|3.0|I was excited to buy the CD for a great price that was a lot cheaper than what they usually sell for. The condition also said \\"very-good.\\" The shipping was first class and cheap so that was a plus. However, when I got the CD it wasn't as good as described. The case wasn't in the best shape and the CD had problems playing track number 8 or it didn't play at all. Luckily, the seller was polite and let me return it for a full refund. I just thought it was a little unfair that I needed to pay for the shipping to send it back. Overall, I don't know if I will do business with this seller again, but CDwarehouse was polite, understanding, and responded to emails quickly. Thank you for your business nonetheless!
B004HGBUVG|5.0|Some try to inflate themselves by criticising artistic excellence.   If you can appreciate Lucinda Williams, this release is a definite 5 star, on par with Car Wheels and Essence.
B003H9MSPG|5.0|According to my son, this is a great Nerf gun. It has good accuracy and range. He loves having Nerf battles with his friends. He wishes that more ammo came with it because it gets lost quite often. Sometimes the bullets do not fly straight. It is not because of the gun: if a bullet has been flattened or ripped, it won't perform as good. Also, as a tip, the Longstrike works better without the barrel than it does with it, because when the barrel is on, the bullet may scrape the edges and go off course or not fly far enough.    Pros.  The scope attachment to this gun can be attached to any other gun with a rail (a line of ridges on top of the gun).  Its barrel can be attached to a handful of other Nerf guns.  The Longstrike is very durable, so it will survive multiple falls (experimentally proven:).  Has a jam door, so if a bullet gets stuck, you can fish it out with your finger.  It can also be used with different clips: the 18 clip and 35 clip.  There are many ways to aim (which are all listed in the instructions)    Cons.  The shoulder rest cannot be removed.
0060936223|5.0|If you love Patti Smith/Robert Mapplethorpe/good music/poetry/art/love stories - read this book. It's amazing and genuine and I loved every bit of it.
0756405890|5.0|(I'm chanting encouragement for you to buy this book.)<br /><br />It's hard to be reviewer 1,002 and say anything original, so I'll just go ahead and second what everyone loved about this book: Kvothe is an amazing character, flaws and all. The central love interest (which doesn't really take up much of the book) is non-cheesy and believable. The magic is used almost as another character in the book - it's not just there for the sake of making this a fantasy. Rothfuss's writing is incredibly good, both in prose and in keeping the plot moving.<br /><br />I have recommended NOTW to everyone I know, and everyone who has finished it has come back to me, thinking I'm the goddess of book recommendations.<br /><br />However. A number of friends have not finished the book, claiming they couldn't get into it. I agree that the first 60-100 pages involve a lot of setting-up and framing of the story, and I implore readers to get through them and trust that the rest of the book is well worth the time spent understanding Kvothe's current situation in the first part. It's always hard to get into a book that has to create a whole world for you from scratch, but believe me when I say that those first 60-100 pages are part of a plot line that is just as rewarding as the rest of the book. If I sound like I'm trying my hardest to convince you, it's because I am. I know lots of people have a 50 page rule where they put a book down if the first 50 pages don't grab them - but you would be making a mistake.<br /><br />In short, this was the best book I've read in a long time, of any genre.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|i enjoyed the story of jacob and his perculiar friends very much! there was an enchanting sense of adventure and romance. i agree with a fellow reviewer when she says the ending came quickly. there ws more expliation needed. i will be excitedly awaitng  and hoping for the next installment of this series! i encourage this books for teens more so than for adults, but i condemn riggs for his wonderful and peculiar story! great work!
0756404738|5.0|Everything I loved about this book has already been said hundreds of times. I can't get enough of how Rothfuss balances great character building with page-turning plot-lines. This book, along with NOTW, are my two fave books of the year so far, which is saying something since I've been reading like a maniac since I finished grad school. I can't believe what a detailed world Rothfuss has created - it's on par with The Golden Compass. Rothfuss also doesn't shy away from showing Kvothe's flaws. He commits some pretty grisly acts in this book, and I'm starting to see how some people think of him as a hero, while others see him as a villain.<br /><br />A note about how I read this book: I'm training for a marathon, which has me doing a bunch of 2+ hour workouts each week. I bought the book as well as the audio version (you're welcome, Mr. Rothfuss) and jumped back and forth between the two, listening to the audio on my runs. Sometimes I find that audiobooks aren't as engaging as the physical copies, but in this case, I couldn't get myself to press stop, even after I got home and was in serious need of a shower. I invented reasons to keep listening - \\"Oh! I haven't reorganized the vegetable drawer in a while! Let me get right on that!\\"<br /><br />So consider this five stars for both the hardcover and the audio format. It takes a lot to distract me from my knees during a 13-mile run, but Rothfuss managed it.
B0034G4ORM|5.0|I almost did not watch this movie because of the poor ratings but I am glad I did anyway. I also brought this movie as well.  The special effects and story was very good. Although, it would have been better if I could have emotionally connected to some of the actors a little bit more but it was still a great movie and worth adding to your video collection.  Please do not try to compare this movie to independent day or any other movie like many of the other reviews have done. It is a good movie in its own right.  Most movies will and should be made differently compare to old movies and  I probably wouldn't want to see movies made like old movies.  It is good to have poor ratings but some of them are over the top and may cause you to turn away from an otherwise good/great movie.  Many of you will not regret watching or buying this movie.
B004SGWYW4|5.0|The T&A and fan service stuff is fairly excessive early on in this.  Honestly thought of giving a lower rating because of it but as things progress it settles into one of the best zombie flicks I have ever seen.  One thing to keep in mind is that this covers only the first three days after the zombie outbreak.  You could almost look at this as a prequel to Walking Dead.  Main difference is that it spreads very, very, fast.
B0050CQY1W|5.0|BEYONCE IS BACK, THIS ALBUM IS SO GREAT. ALL THE SONGS ARE AMAZING. I CANT STOP LISTENING TO IT, EVERYDAY!! :) LOVE IT.
0345529057|5.0|I have got to say, I have not been this excited to read a series in my whole life! I have read many books in my day and it is something that calms me down and makes me happy. After doing some research on trying to find a good fantasy series, I stumbled across many sites that talked about A Song of Ice and Fire. So what do I do? I go ahead and buy the entire set! I have been on pins and needles waiting for this series to come to my doorstep. And I cannot wait to devour what I have heard is some of GRRM's greatest work! I am also looking forward to getting the 5th book on July 12! Wish me happy reading!
055357342X|4.0|Having decided to read these books on the basis of the HBO series, I've now gotten well ahead of the TV version (which faithfully, allowing for some minor innovations, captures the first book, Game of Thrones). In this one, the third in the series, the story continues in all its intense detail as Lord Tywin Lannister returns to King's Landing to personally oversee the rule of his young grandson the godawful King Joffrey. Tywin replaces his dwarf son, Tyrion Lannister, as King's Hand with remarkable results. Tyrion, who was clever and ruthless enough to outwit the conspirators and his sister, Queen Cersei, by swift and decisive action and who engineered the brilliant defense of the capital against King Stannis Baratheon's attack, in the preceding volume is suddenly unmanned in the shadow of his cold and even more ruthless father. The Imp seems to shrivel into near helplessness as Tywin makes him into a pawn again, and all of the dwarf's insecurities in the face of an unloving sire come to the fore again. Indeed, Tyrion seems a very different man in Book Three and ends up suffering the consequences.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Arya Stark struggles to make her way to safety at Riverrun where she believes her family is holed up after a series of indecisive victories on the battlefield against the Lannisters and after having lost their ancestral stronghold, Winterfell, in the north -- while Sansa, her elder sister, still being held against her will at King's Landing, finally seems to see through the fairy tale gloss her childish imagination has imposed on the vicious world into which she has fallen. Alas, it's still not enough to sufficiently sharpen her wits and enable her to make smart choices. Even with the realization of the lies all around her, she still can't tell the players without a scorecard which she is most emphatically denied. Perhaps there is no dumber female in all medieval fantasy than the Lady Sansa Stark.<br /><br />At Riverrun her mother, the Lady Catelyn Stark, remains impetuous, stubborn and self-involved, characteristics which the proud and arrogant Jaime Lannister, captured and imprisoned by Catelyn's son, King Robb, will soon fall benefit to -- although he will not be entirely satisfied with the outcome. In the north, Jon Snow, King Robb's bastard brother, condemned to a lifetime of service in the Night's Watch, the brotherhood dedicated to protecting the realm from the evils of the Haunted Forest and worse things in the north, finds himself alone and imperilled on an expedition beyond the Wall to discover what the Wildlings are really up to. There he will come face to face with the terrible secret driving the Wildlings south, though he is soon forced to part with his white direwolf, Ghost, a creature whose soul he shares, while betraying his comrades of the Watch.<br /><br />But there is scheming and evil abroad south of the Wall, too, as King Robb, having broken his sworn word to Lord Frey for love of a woman must find a means to make amends for the Freys hold the key to the north and recovery of Winterfell. But Lord Frey is an aged and sour man upon whose capacity to forgive (and recognize his lot as bound up with theirs) the Stark party must now rely. Sandor Clegane, the King's Hound and personal guard, has departed King Joffrey's service in disgust and is now abroad in the land while Lord Beric Dondarrion, who has been gifted with the ability to cheat death thanks to the Red Priest, an adept of the eastern god R'hollar, pursues his vengeance against the Lannisters in the countryside they've laid waste.<br /><br />Oh and in the east the one time Dothraki Khaleesi, Danaerys Targaryen, last scion of House Targaryen, begins to move west again with her three dragons and shrunken khalasar in hopes of building a following substantial enough to enable her to reclaim the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros where House Lannister and House Stark (the latter now reeling from treachery) contend for the crown and where the old king's brother, Stannis Baratheon, still dreams of his own ascension to the Iron Throne aided by his Red Priestess, Melisandre, herself an adept of R'hollar.<br /><br />This volume is a great hodgepodge of many stories, all quite interesting in themselves but none really resolving much as the great saga presses ever onward. There is one rather shocking turn of events in the second half when King Robb at last reaches Lord Frey's stronghold at the Twins, an event which seems to turn the whole story on its head, but matters remain unresolved, awaiting subsequent volumes. It's easy to see how this story can fill several seasons or more of television time and do it well because of the richness of the characterizations and the hard-to-predict plot twists. But there remains one serious drawback: The tale seems endless because of its many interwoven strands, none of which manage to play out in full in any single volume. For those who, like me, enjoy the satisfaction to be had on turning a novel's final page and closing the book, there will be a bit of disappointment here. But if you're after a tale with lots of things going on in many different places and interesting personalities with plenty of plot surprises in a richly imagined world, you might not miss the absence of closure this book leaves you with.<br /><br />Stuart W.
