B000EJ9MTW|5.0|Best album of 2006 so far. <br /> <br />If you like early Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, the White Stripes and classic heavy metal in general, this one is a must have. <br /> <br />There's maybe one weak song on the album. It's classic.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|PJ are arguably the best band from the nineties and even in this century.No one even comes close to them,certainly not the overrated Nirvana who suck.This is their best album after Ten and Vs.What are you waiting for?.Get a copy rightaway and enjoy.
B000002HPV|5.0|Bjork for me is one of those artists, where I cannot chose just one favourite album of theirs. Every Bjork album is very very good, but there has always been at least one track that I simply did not like. 'Homogenic' is an alienic, electronic and very unusual album, which will leave you thinking something like wtf (if you are new to Bjork), I don't get this (if the album hasn't grew on you yet), or this is really creative and unique (if you like it immediately). Sometimes, I love this album, and sometimes I hate it, but that is why I find it so fascinating.<br /><br />The album begins with the magnificent \\"Hunter\\", which you have to be in a certain mood to enjoy it at its peak. It seems at first like a very simple song, with just a snare drum, and vocal, but the lyrics are complex, and as you will find out, the lyrics are also. This was the second single in the UK, and Bjork's lowest charting song there, peaking at #44 and only staying in the charts for one week. \\"Joga\\" is another song I have to be in a mood for to listen to it at its peak. It is a strange ballad, which samples atmospheric Icelandic sounds such as volcanoes and earthquakes. The strings are fantastic and it has an awesome climax. \\"Unravel\\" is a fan favourite but is a song that I unfortunately can not really get into. I find it more than a little bland actually. It doesn't really go anywhere.<br /><br />\\"Bachelorette\\" (#24 UK) is another alright song with gorgeous strings, and powerful vocals. The texture is thick, and the song itself is very very complex. The video, however, is one of my favourites (only behind Pagan Poetry and Cocoon). \\"All Neon Like\\" is quite a European song, and is the only song that comes close a bit to 'dance' music hence the wonderful bass synthesizer beat which comes in after a minute or so. This is one of the strangest songs I have ever heard, and one of Bjork's weirdest - ever. It almost has a hypnotizing effect on the listener as all the electronic layers gradually come in and works very well. \\"5 Years\\" is a nice song which again samples earthquakes and such. Like track 4, the strings are lovely, but are one of the more forgettable songs.<br /><br />\\"Immature\\" is actually one of my favourites. It has a tracney kind of texture to it, and it is great how Bjork simply just repeats the same few lines throughout the song - it does not get boring though. The song begins very calm and relaxing before verse 1 where Bjork asks 'How could I be so immature?', and some techno-like beats come in. Bjork soon answers 'How extremely lazy of me' and then sings some of her famous gibberish. \\"Alarm Call\\" follows and is defiantly the most radio-friendly song from this album. It was the third single in the UK, and is a nice contrast to the other crazy, out-of control songs on this album, and speaking of this \\"Pluto\\" follows and has to be one of if not the most crazy, out of control, high energy songs I have ever heard - which makes it my favourite song on this album. The beat is very hard and loud, and the song (like most others on this album, but to a greater extent) sounds like it belongs on Mars, rather then Earth. he climax comes when Bjork starts screaming (which I couldn't stand at first as it was very loud and went on for 1 minute), and after this, the song ends, and the calmest song on the album (which is another great use of contrast) \\"All I Full Of Love\\" closes the album wonderfully, although I enjoy the single version a lot better.<br /><br />Homogenic used to be my favourite Bjork album a few years ago, then it was Vespertine (9.5/10), but now I'm quite sure that Homogenic is the king of the mountain (yes, Kate Bush is another of my favourite females as you may have guessed)<br /><br />9.5 / 10ell. \\"5 Years\\" is a nice song which again samples earthquakes and such.

078322611X|1.0|Oh, Come On!  A guy who builds a ballpark in a corn field because voices told him to should be locked up, not celebrated!  Especially if he builds it for ghosts to play on.  Come on!  That's so stupid.  And then at the end where everybody's coming from miles around to watch a game they can't even see?  That makes no sense at all!  And I don't like movies that make Christians look like jerks.  Why couldn't Kevin Costner just make Bull Durham 2?  That would have been much better.  Bull Durham was a good movie.

B00005JOVN|4.0|This movie definatly could have had more twists, but when you think about it, an almost 3,000 passenger luxury liner turning upside down in the middle of the Atlantic is a pretty big twist itself! The cast could have been better. Some were good, others were terrible! If you like to see lots of destruction (pools and people bieng tossed off the side of a ship and then swept under, rooms flooding with water in seconds, elevators collapsing, and people walking on the celing) then you will enjoy this movie. There are some very corny parts; and sad. It is not the feelgood movie of the year, but it is pretty good. Oh, and if you are a fan of the girl from the \\"Black Eyed Peas\\", this movie may be a little hard for you.
B0000YEEHG|5.0|Ingmar Bergman, the great filmmaker responsible for both philosophically and psychologically charged titles such as The Seventh Seal (1957) and Hour of the Wolf (1968) will please fans yet again in Persona.<br /><br />Persona is a film which explores the psychological nature of identity, despair, the inner quest for individualism, and more importantly the philosophical theme of existence. As always those interested in existentialism and/or Nihilism need look no further than this Bergman masterpiece to supplement their curiosities in the uncanny/subconscious world. Not only does Bergman masterfully explore these themes through complex dialogue (as he's famous for), but also through beautifully imagery.<br /><br />While literally dozens of scholarly papers on aesthetics and film studies have successfully explored the imagery in Persona, such on-screen representations of emotional and psychological turmoil on the part of the main characters should not be missed. From the famous \\"burn\\" during the film's climax (which I mention further in an aesthetics/Bergman article recently written), to the shadow-play of dark and light Bergman uses during the film: this film is amazing.<br /><br />Regardless of what past reviews say, this is one of Bergman's more \\"tame\\" works as far as representational content is concerned and yet it manages to truly be an intense, eye-opening experience. Admittedly in the past some Bergman films - despite being of good quality - have been long, drawn out, and somewhat tiring (reading philosophical texts are sometimes similar). Persona doesn't suffer from this intellectual \\"lag\\" at all.<br /><br />Whether you're already a Bergman fan or you're just getting into his works, this film is a must see!
1400034779|5.0|A friend gave me the first four books and they sat on my shelf for a year before I read them.  Africa?  Botswana? Who wants to read about those places? I didn't.  But I was out of things to read and picked up book number one.  What a wonderful surprise! <br /> <br />The author paints the people and culture of Botswana in a such a wonderful array of colors - I'll bet Botswana tourism has shot way up since these books came out. <br /> <br />I love our heroine, Precious Ramotswe.  The mysteries she solves in the books do not involve CSI type gruesome murder plots but more down to earth mysteries such as \\"is my teenage daughter meeting a boy after school?\\"  The \\"mundaneness\\" of the mysteries is a large part of the charm of these books. <br /> <br />Like Lays potato chips, you will not be able to read just one of these books.  I guarantee your laundry and dishes will pile up as you just have to find out what happens in the next book - and the next book - and the next book - etc.
0060977493|4.0|More than halfway through the journey and you're still searching for a theme proper. Still seeking a proper end,a justifiable ambition. Yet to decipher the protagonist,the hero and the villain. Arundhati Roy's maiden novel \\"The God of Small Things\\" appears for the better part of its 340 pages an amoeba protruding out its pseudopodium in each and evry direction under the sun and exhibiting a quasi-movement. Indeed for a long,lond time in this immensely intricate great book,the reader doesn't even get the whosper of its central idea but when he does hear it,one by one all the pieces of the jigsaw puzzle fits into picture has an overtone of tragedy.    That the book is deeply soaked in tragedy is evident from the very beginning,but beyond this,the ideas all remain a surprise. Roy manages to portray a conventional Syrian Christian family in the south Indian state of Kerala against the backdrop of post-colonial India. Conventions and traditions and absurd customs are still embraced by the folks and political shrewdness and cunningness are searing into the Indian politik. The society is still immersed in prejudice and amidst this setting of dark landscape,Roy composes the tale,rather the childhood history,of Rahel and Estha,dizygotic twins who \\"fitted together. Like stacked spoons. Like familiar lovers' bodies\\".    the story begins when the sister Rahel---now adult---returns to her home vilage Ayemenem and commences realising her whole life that had been so maliciously distorted here. the novel is composed mainly in introspection as images from the bitter past invade the present and threathen to embellish the whole implication of existence. Rahel pairs up with her brother Estha,a self-procclaimed dumb,and confront the spectres of the past which the authoress designs with exquisite intelligence and conjures up with stunning complexity. Gradually we come to realise their childhood and with it the theme of the book. We meet their circumstancially confined mother Ammu and learn her tragic marriage and her subsequent love affair with a Paravan(read Untouchable) Velutha;we learn about Chacko,their uncle who had been a Rhodes Scholar at Oxforrd,his ex-wife Margaret Kochamma and little daughter Sophie Mol. The reader also gets acquainted with Baby Kochamma,Comrade Pillai,the Lemondrink Orangedrink Man and several other characters who're unobstrusively and crucially so massively significant to the structure of the plot. the reader learns numerous stories about a plethora of characters invoked in the novel and though he may feel that they're all disjointed,but actually all these stories congregate to fabricate \\"The God Of Small Things\\",a novel psychologicaly intense and intricate,a novel which invents its own language,a novel which mirrors the abject customs handed by convention which ultimately echo elements of tragedy.    Arundhati Roy's first novel is a gripping narrative of how a prejudiced and demanding society can cause the demise of innocence and love. The novel is basically a family drama which circumspects a family domain through the untarnished,unexperienced and virgin eyes of two children---Estha and Rahel---s they come to terms with the horrors and sorrow of their family membrs. But Roy's ingenuity lies not just in merely translating a regular real life unforgiving saga into fiction but actually in giving the larger dimensions of society a shape of a family caught between tradition and modernity,and be extension between dependence and independence. Roy composes this great work of literature not in classical tone or the Queen's English but in  language that is beautiful and hauntingly apt for the reflection of an equally haunting tragedy. Her language is nevertheless innovative and so is her simple but powerful similes and metaphors and great allusions. \\"The God of Small Things\\" ia a very well-nit,meshed-up novel with no specific apparent vivid ambition or protagonist. Arundhati Roy coalesces myriad stories into one,and none of them is out of context anyhow.    But so much so,the book,like any work of literature,isn't void of flaws. Arundhati Roy tries to be too histrionic,too dramatic at times,too subtle and employs the sting-in-the-tail strategy too often too abruptly. The novel is morally pervadind ,true,but the end isn't at all convincing---you're left dissatisfied. The reader questions even Estha and rahel's wit and intelligence:can they be so dumb as not to realise the truth hidden underneath the apparent? Does it really require a lapse of more than two decades to comprehend the incomprehensible? And who is this \\"God of Small Things\\"? The text marks Velutha so and if so,is he the central figure around which the whole scheme revolves? Does he deserve to be so as far as the plot is concerned?    Yet all these defects can be considered. Considered because at the end of the book, you like the book. More than just like it. Love it. More than just love it. Carry it with you in yourself. In your memory. In your heart.. The book stays in your mind as a scintillatingly great one. A classic maybe. \\"The God of Small Things\\" is a fantasticnovel thatmerges innumerable characters,stories and ideas but still they all are delineated in themselves. The authoress never goes too deep in any of the stories,but like an intelligent,ambitious sorceress,leaves the deduction of her tricks to her readers. She slyly glances off the rusting metal of politics in post-indepence India,borders on the social disdain,paints a lighter hue of a darker picture of social and moral restrictions. All too cleverly. All too sharply. All too beautifully. All too outstandingly. In certain parts,Roy's maiden novel finds ample similarities with Harper Lee's classic \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\". That is an American telling illustration of racial prejudice and discrimination perceived through the eyes of two pairs of kids and after you've read \\"The God of Small Things\\",you can easily discern that this is an Indian version of divisions ofsociety. Arundhati Roy's novel is a classic example of the hugely rich literature of India today and one that would forever leave a lingering echo in your heart to resonate.
B00004YA0T|3.0|Eugen Jochum made his first Bruckner cycle for DG in the Fifties and early Sixties but was such a specialist that EMI felt justified in bringing him back for a second cycle from Dresden in the Seventies. The sonics improved, but strangely, the usually refined and restrained sound of the Staatskapelle Dresden became coarse and imprecise under him. Jochum's way with Bruckner was highly subjective, featuring idiosyncratic accelerandos, explosive fortissimos, and abrupt gear changes. One might superficially compare his approach to Furtwangler's, but there is an order of magnitude difference in their talent, and devotees of Frutwangler realize that his seeming spontaneity often represented a carefully thought out interpretation that remained essentially the same over the years. For me, Jochum's reputation in Bruckner is a holdover from an era when only a few conductors championed the composer's entire output (Furtwangler himself thought that only the Seventh was formally completely satisfying), and there is no doubting Jochum's sincere advocacy.<br /><br />I've made my way through both cycles but only reluctantly reviewed them, given my general lack of enthusiasm. Here I'm prompted by a belief that newcomers should be warned in advance. Never mind the respectful coverage in the Penguin Guide and the Gramophone -- not a single reading in this box set rises close to the top of Bruckner recordings. Jochum has some irritating tics that disqualify him, for me, from serious consideration. His favorite is to tiptoe into one of Bruckner's allegro movements very, very quietly, only to drop a bomb of fortissimo brass, erupting in the crudest fashion.  Another is the abrupt gear change, and yet another the unmarked racing accelerando to finish off a movement (in both senses). Only the sheen of the Dresden strings and the relative composure of Jochum in the Adagios keeps this cycle from the two stars it deserves.<br /><br />How so many listeners and critics can find such unmusical, ugly performances acceptable, much less great, baffles me. Let the die-hard fans rain down their Unhelpfuls. If the inspired Bruckner from Furtwangler, Karajan, KLemperer, Boulez, and Harnoncourt isn't enough, skip Jochum and seek out the beautiful readings of the late Takashi Asahina, a legend in Japan, whose three complete cycles are a treasure trove of natural, deeply affecting music-making.ugly performances acceptable, much less great, baffles me.

B000ETQRCM|4.0|Pearl Jam has always been a favorite of mine.  This album is a great return as we haven't heard from the band in a while.  The tunes *Life Wasted* and *Worldwide Suicide* really reflect the artists' disgust with our current president and the government tactics that we all have to deal with.<br /><br />The album reminds me a bit of Vitalogy.<br /><br />I was so pleasantly surprised to listen to what I believe is a sort of comeback for the band that layed in wait before they had something to say.  And I suppose this is best....why speak until you have something to say?  Pearl Jam has been a band of few words...unless there was something to say.  And say it they always have.  This album is a great one.  The band and it's individual components are more mature and more comfortable in their own skin.  Their music reflects that.<br /><br />Thanks Eddie and the boys!  Good Job!
B000002LK1|5.0|Violator is nothing short of a modern masterpiece. It is absolutely filled with superb songs. It represents the culmination of everything that Depeche Mode did before it (though I much prefer the later works such as \\"Ultra\\") and is perhaps the apex of their interesting and varied career. Depeche Mode on this release began to explore the possibilities of using organic instruments (such as guitars) and combining these with their usual electronic/synthesiser sound (which they did to wonderful effect). The musical arrangements on the album, aside from effectively blending electronic with organic sounds, are also very original and well thought out - sometimes bordering on minimal and at other times overwhelming. Stylistically the album explores a wide spectrum and incorporates rock, electronic and even elements of classical. Nevertheless, the real key to the longevity of this release is Martin Gore's excellent songwriting which had matured substantially by this time. It is not only the more well-known tracks (like \\"Personal Jesus\\" and \\"Enjoy the Silence\\") that impress but also lesser known gems such as \\"Clean\\", \\"Halo\\" and \\"World In My Eyes\\" which help to make this album such a standout. \\"Clean\\" is one of my personal favourites - rarely has a band produced such profound and thought-provoking insights on the perils of drug abuse, lost innocence, purity, temptation and redemption. Harrowing and beautiful at the same time. Lyrically the album is sublime with Martin Gore contributing some of his most affecting work. This is definitely an album that gets better with time - one which has not dated badly the way so much of the other music of the 1980's has (although Violator was released in March 1990). It stands up very well in 2006 - much better than the albums immediately preceding it.  The older I get it seems the more I can appreciate it.  Overall this is a great album and a worthy investment for any serious music fan...don't let anyone tell you otherwise!
B000BISBDY|5.0|The Legend of Johnny Cash is a perfect and blended mix of Cash's early and later works. Standout tracks include: Hurt, Rusty Cage, The Man Comes Around, A Boy Named Sue (Live), Folsom Prison Blues, I Walk the Line, Jackson (duet with June Carter), Get Rhythm,and Ring of Fire. The sound quality is excellent, the catalog of songs are unique and shows the wide range of Cash's most timeless and popular recordings. You won't stop listening to his cover of Soundgarden's Rusty Cage, wow, now that's how a cover is supposed to be done! You will cry like a baby when you hear the song Hurt (Nine Inch Nails song). Of course his best and celebrated work are the songs he wrote. I love the song Jackson, Johnny and June sound so good together when they sing, it's complete and utter magic! I highly recommend this greatest hits collection for old and new Johnny Cash fans!
B000002L99|1.0|i am a van halen freak and loved their previous albums and was looking forward to hearing some more classic van halen guitar riffs and awesome drumming too. when i first heard why can't this be love i just about puked. could not distinguish guitar from synth, blah. there hits were boring piano music that lacked the excitement that they had. i don't think they were great because of dlr, what the hell happened here. new band and boring balads that makes you think of good times with your grandmother.i bought this album and i am saving it one day to burn. in the background i will have the original vh albums appear after the album is burnt away. i haven't bought any of the other vh albums with sammy and i only heard the singles off them off radio, what a terrible mess of hits from a band gone from exciting to boring. i am not saying i don't like sammy, this guys solo albums smoke anything he did with van halen.dlr eat em and smile was exciting to hear after 5150.still not classic vh.hearin dave sing \\"got me a date with a super model\\" on best of was such a tease. dave is not a technically good singer like sammy but he has charisma that makes it fun to listen to,he has got a great sounding voice. sammy is very generic singer who has a middle of the line sounding voice. if you listen gary cherone is very much like sammy, awesome in extreme though. some guys sing better but lack a good sounding voice. ozzy is no great singer, but his voice sounds cool. dio is both. just want to express my opinion about vocalists, hope you understand just cause you can sing good doesn't mean you have a voice that is enjoyable to listen too. when i think of classic vh songs i think of, full bug, everybody wants some,doa,light up the sky, cradle will rock, somebody get me a doctor, mean streets,secrets,hang em high,beautiful girls,i'm the one, hot for teacher,i'll wait,top jimmy, house of pain, so many songs which make you want to have a couple of beers and pick up some chicks and bring them home to party and play with.good times. it seems that when you get big it means big business and that is what is stopping a great rock n roll band from becoming the biggest reunion of the century, very depressed about it but hope that ed and dave will come around to give their fans and the industry what it is missing.hope you find my review worth reading and keep your fingers crossed, like me.
B00003CXMG|2.0|Almost Famous by director Cameron Crow is just mediocre and completely blown out of proprotion. Critics stated this was the best movie of all-time, I was very disappointed when I rented this movie. It was nothing like I thought it would be, yes Kate Hudson is glorious and mesmerizing as \\"band-aide\\" Penny Lane but the writing was boring and the other characters were so one-dimensional it was ridiculous! Crow hasn't directed or written great movies in the last decade, his best film is Say Anything, not Jerry Maguire or Vanilla Sky. The music is rockin' but Almost Famous had me singing another tune. Skip it.

B0009PVZWI|5.0|Foo Fighters dual disc In Your Honor is the coolest album of 2005. The first disc has hard-rocking songs including the first and incredible single, Best of You. Disc two is full of ballads, great as well. Standout tracks include: In Your Honor, Cold Day in the Sun, DOA, No way Back, Miracle, What if i do?, Over and Out, Resolve, and On the Mend. A lot of fans consider this album to be the weakest well...I love it!!!!!!!!! All the tracks are catchy, intimate, and impressive lyrically. I heard this album so many times last summer, just a gorgeous album all around. I highly recommend this under-appreciated gem!

Some good songs, I like the drum solos but its to original, I give the CD 2 stars
0393317552|4.0|I found this book very interesting. I especially enjoyed how he explained each term in the subject. Guns: you can have the best technology in the world but without the philosophy to use it--like the Chinese in the 14th century, you will not succeed. At that time, the Chinese were trading as far as the coast of Africa in ships they mastered. Unfortunately, a change in leadership, and that was the problem, decided trade was bad, burned the ships and the shipyards, and closed off China to the world. Germs: most of our germs come from animals we domesticated. Civilization exists because men first tamed goats, then cows and oxen and finally horses. Horses became more useful than oxen once we discovered the proper harness in the so-called dark ages. Horse are faster than oxen and can plow more land. This also meant that as farming replaced hunter-gathers, disease followed. It was not that the Incas were powerless, they had great leadership, it was that the conquistidors were dealing with a third-stringer--- the creame of the leadership died in the waves of disease that swept ahead of the west in the conquest of the new world. Farming replaced hunters simply because the same area of land can support 5 farmers and 1 hunter--no wonder the Indians of the west lost. The author explains why civilization seems crowded on the Eurasian continent: because that's where the best food, adaptable for human development is, that's where animals amenable to domestication exists. Africans never domesticated the zebra because it could not be done. American Indians never established wide-spread farming because corn is not a stable grain like wheat.<br /><br />My only problem with the text is that the best summary of what he is passing on is in the last 20 pages. He then explains why previous civilizations failed--like how the Greeks depleated their soil. Also, as I said in the title, the author rambles some. Still, it was interesting reading.<br /><br />This is a facinating book. It should be required reading at the university level.<br /><br />Please, if you like my review--vote!ing at the university level.    Please, if you like my review--vote!
B000A7Q2DM|4.0|To start it off 30 Seconds to Mars self titled album was much better then \\"A Beautiful Lie\\".

B00005JOVH|4.0|I love the Xmen comic books and I have to say the characters are really finely done in all three sequels. My all time fav is Wolvie and H. Jackman makes you believe he IS Wolverine. Rogue is just as annoying in comic book as she is in the movie. F. Janssen EXCELLENT Jean Grey.<br />All in all CASTING is best thing about all three films.<br />Xmen 3 - now I won't be recanting the story or giving my views on how idea of treating mutations as sickness relates to discrimination in our societies, just give my views in short (as always).<br />Story is decent, effects are reeallly nice but TOO MANY XMEN die! Well for my taste anyway.<br />Cyclops dies stoopidly. Jean Grey dies by Wolvie - why couldnt he just stuck the \\"cure\\" needle in her and turned her \\"normal human\\" instead of impaling her on his claws??? Arrgh!!!<br />The \\"other\\", low level mutants are depicted as disgusting transgressions of natural law and dont do much for likability of the mutant \\"cause\\".<br />Blah.<br />Who cares.<br />Good fun. If you liked first two, you will like this one too.
B000EJ9MTW|5.0|I was really hesitant to give anything a perfect score...but this album totally deserves it. If this came out 30 years ago, it would be on every \\"best of\\" rock album list of all time. This band is able to do what a lot of other bands try, but fail at. They blend the best elements of several rock groups together (several have been mentioned already: Zeppelin, Sabbath, Deep Purple, Blue Oyster Cult and a little Iron Maiden, Pink Floyd, Aerosmith, Stones and so on) and does them all justice, rather than ripping them off. I bought this CD yesterday and played it in my car on the way home. I was literally laughing out loud and shed a tear of joy because I was thrown back at how great this album is. If you're a rock fan who has been feeling diappointed at what the music scene has to offer these days, then do yourself a favor and get this CD. It will definitely rekindle your love of straight-up rock.
1577314808|3.0|I love to read new age/metaphysical/self-help topics and my main intention is to get whatever I can out of each book.  I know that not all books will give me tons of new ideas and that's not what I'm looking for.  I'll take even one or two new ideas or concepts that I've read before but are written in a way that I can understand or create an \\"Ah-ha\\" moment for me.<br /><br />I was disappointed in this book because I felt that it was so \\"hyped\\" by it being a bestseller that it had to be good.  The cover says, \\"A guide to spiritual enlightenment,\\" yet this book was \\"heavy\\" in content.<br /><br />I don't like books that I have to \\"work\\" to read, meaning that it doesn't flow but rather I have to pay very close attention or my mind wanders because it's either boring or \\"heavy\\" in that the language isn't friendly and easy to read.<br /><br />This book was 1/2 boring and 1/2 heavy.<br /><br />One other reviewer said something about how the whole book is in the title.  That's very true.  The Power of Now is all that it talks about.  Letting go of time.  That's it.<br /><br />It rehashes other writings of self-help issues such as letting go of your ego, forgiving, and how all of our problems arise from the illusions of the mind.  It reminded me of Deepak Chopra's teachings mixed with Wayne Dyer but written in a very heavy, dry way.<br /><br />The strange thing is, before I purchased this book, I kept seeing it pop up everywhere and I kept picking it up but my intuition had me put the book back every time.  The final time I picked it up I was distracted, already had a pile of books I was going to purchase, and I had to leave the bookstore because I had to be somewhere.  I finally bought the book that my intuition had me keep putting back for the prior month each time I saw it.<br /><br />Well, you know what they say.  Listen to your gut.  Instead I wasted $14.00 on a book that didn't really \\"speak\\" to me.  It may be different for you.<br /><br />I have gotten so much from Wayne Dyer and Stuart Wilde and I recommend both authors to anyone really looking for answers within themselves.  Both these authors have a gifted flow in their writing and they are the ones I keep going back to.

B000001C6M|5.0|this is and probably always will be my favorite thrash album. in my opinion thrash needs to be a little campy, it's what makes it fun. this album was chock full of over the top satanic lyrics, fun as hell riffs, fully air guitar worthy solo action, and enough leather and spikes to outfit some weird german porno. as far as i'm concerned this was the absolute best slayer album. don't get me wrong, the other ones are good, but tom and crew kinda started taking themselves too seriously forgeting that thrash is about fun, not macho posturing. in my opion this album and whiplash 'Power and Pain' are the best, buy them, bask in their ever so 80's glory, and just rock the chuck out... hailz
B00006LPEY|3.0|Or at least as an option.  That's strange to say considering the original was Japanese, but you know what I mean.  The voices don't have the unique sound each did on the VHS version.

0792844882|2.0|Big budget, but big on \\"stoopid\\" as well. The cast had some great potential, but the film flops on the tedious, tantrum filmed performance of its lead: Elizabeth Berkley.    Nomi leaves a bad life, moving to Las Vegas in search of a better one in the bright lights. She meets Molly, who takes her in, and eventually finds herself working at the Cheetah, doing lap dances while looking for her big break at one of the more upscale clubs. She gets her chance when Cristol Conners (Gershon), current Diva of the stage at the Stardust, buys her beau, Zack Carey (MacLachlan), the Stardust's Entertainment Manager, a lapdance from Nomi. While fending off the lesbian advances of Conners, Nomi manages to score big: she bags the role of Conners' understudy, snatches Conners' man Zach, and eventually dumps Conners down a flight of stairs in order to get herself into the spotlight.    Elizabeth Berkley is a Cinderella who behaves more like one of the wicked step-sisters. Her interaction with others is either wild-eyed temper tantrum, or sweet little innocent, oftentimes within the same scene. Take some Prozac, sister! The amount of time the other more substantial leads spend pursuing her in the face of her abuse, tantums and such makes the whole film less than credible.    Everyone spends alot of time nude in the film. Berkley shows all of her openings, gratuitiously, and her inane love scenes with MacLachlan (who shows quite a bit of backside) are more funny than erotic. There is NOTHING erotic about this film, though Gershon does show a vampishly stylish performance. Robert Davi, as owner of the Cheetah, is sleazily charming, as is Lin Tucci, the bawdy big lady who provides comic relief during the shows. MacLachlan... well, he's never been one of my favorite actors, neither for looks or talent, but he does have a fine ass, and shows quite a bit of it in the film.
B00062J00S|5.0|This is a classic film without a doubt. When you are down and out put this film in and really see what it has to say. When your back is against the wall and it seems hopeless there is still a ray of hope. Someone somewhere does care. You have made a difference throughout your life and you don't realize it. You made a difference to the ones you loved and loved you. You made a difference no matter how insignificant to many you have made contact with. Perhaps is worth living after all. You may have more to offer than you ever knew. You will be missed. You never know what's around the bend of life. Stewart conveys the torment and despair of hopelessness brilliantly. Yet, he perseveres. My heart goes out to him in this film. He just seems so sincere. Mister Capra, there is no corn here, just heart. Thank you so much for this film.
B000E6EGZ0|5.0|For my money there are many wonderful Tosca performances with numerous individual portrayals of the heroine?!? There are, however,(2) two essential ones: TOSCA DIVINA,the incomparable Greek-American Maria Callas, and TOSCA REGINA, the glorious African-American Leontyne Price. Both sopranos have recorded the opera twice commercially, with the general concensus being that each one's 'prima' was the best of the (2)two...debatable I know.<br /><br />DIVINA electrifies with artistic nuances, coupled with dramatic and daring (indeed, heedless) vocalism that no one else will ever duplicate. Such intuitive artistry must not be quarrelled with. I Love it!  REGINA revels in a sound so singularly gorgeous, rich, vibrant, and characterful, that it is hard to fault the diminution of the drama DIVINA brings to the role. Ms. Price creates a more subtle, feminine, feline Tosca, who purrs rather than snarls, and who's more fearful than furious when confronted by Scarpia during the 'torture scene', and the scenes that follow. While both divas express their contempt for the Police Chief with relish (\\"Quanto?..il prezzo?!), Price's Tosca seems more desperate and exhausted while killing Scarpia, contrasted with the exultant and wonderfully malevolent one  Callas gives us. Both interpretations are valid, though I could not imagine that scene without Ms. Callas' almost boastful exclamations. \\"Vissi d'arte\\" -however unimportant to the drama- is still one of Puccini's most poignant and beautiful arias. Both divas ably express the aria's pathos, but it is Ms. Price who gives one of the most vocally sumptuous readings ever recorded. Certo REGINA!!! Maestro Herbert Von Karajan, whose idiosyncratic musical genius is much evidenced in the Symphonic realm, was also an outstanding Opera conductor as well. He imbues this TOSCA with a lush, colorful, and immediate ambience that allows his singers to find the drama that is individual to their musical selves. His rapport with the justly-famed VPO is obvious by the unbelievable sonorities he elicits from them throughout the opera. That rapport is just as apparent with Leontyne Price, who he championed early in her spectacular career, as she is more than usually alert dramatically in this performance. Sadly, he is unable to resuscitate the 'dying' vocal splendor of the once-great Giuseppe Di Stefano. Blessed early with a marvelous instrument(and heard to much better advantage in the DIVINA performance), the tenor must resort to much hectoring, howling, and hollering to meet the dramatic AND vocal demands of his role. His soft singing, while often lovely and effective,is a blatant croon. Rarely in this performance  will you find a real legato from the tenor, which mars both \\"E lucevan le stelle\\" and \\"O dolci mani\\".  However, he is a truly ardent and passionate Cavaradossi,convincing in his duets with Tosca. Baritone Giuseppe Taddei's portrayal of the Baron Scarpia is secure, the interpretation commanding, authorative, largely lacking any subtlety. His vocalism is big, beautiful, and appropriate for the role. Though he has, like DIVINA and REGINA, recorded his role twice, neither version differs much in his approach dramatically. Sonically, this recording is superb, balancing the thrilling horns, opulent-sounding strings, and rumbling timpani of the sublime orchestra with plaintive clarity of the Act III bells or the majestic organ in the \\"Te Deum\\". The orchestral playing is unsurpassed on any recording. The comprimarios for the most part, sing with distinction, notably Piero de Palma. At no point during this performance, do Price, Di Stefano, or Taddei fail to generate a palpable chemistry(Von Karajan again perhaps),and collectively exude the excitement of Puccini's \\"shabby little shocker\\". The combination of an outstanding Tosca, masterful conductor, and  glorious sonorities of the magnificent Vienna Philharmonic orchestra should motivate even the fans of the great Tebaldi(another superior Floria), sublime Caballe, or any number of other Toscas to own and treasure the TOSCA REGINA of Leontyne Price.y number of other Toscas to own and treasure the TOSCA REGINA of Leontyne Price.
B000BBYMA2|5.0|I don't know why, it's ultra violent with comic book gore, but maybe that's one of the things that makes it so watchable. If it was darker, more serious, about a group of school kids that are forced to kill each other, it probably wouldn't have been as enjoyable. But as it is where else do you get to watch 40+ people die in the most imaginative (and dare I say sometimes comical) sort of ways. Don't get me wrong, there are a few moving quiet moments, but as a whole if you enjoy the blood-splattering 60's and 70's Asian films then you are bound to love BR. Don't waste your time on this copy though, which has ZERO special features, go straight to the director's cut version instead.
B000C65Z1G|4.0|Rachel Weisz won a much-deserved Oscar for best supporting actress for her role in \\"The Constant Gardener\\". Her marriage to Ralph Fiennes' character, which we are to believe is merely a marriage of convenience, is, as we come to find out, really much more. Their relationship, not the rather intricate plot, is really the heart of the movie and is memorable & quite touching. It serves as a reminder that we should always assume the best of those we love while they are with us, lest we have regrets when they are gone.
B00007L4MJ|5.0|This is the best verison of Lang's Metropolis that I've seen, and in several ways. The image quality stands out immediately, an amazing bit of film restoration. I'd believe that part of that very clean appearance came from the editors' access to multiple prints and editions of the film. Using digital techniques, they could pick the best of the bunch for each frame, but also (at least in theory) combine information from the multiple copies of each frame.<br /><br />Another fine feature of this film took a bit longer to sink in. It had scenes that I'd never seen before. According to the editors' notes, the original had been edited down to a shorter film many times and in many different ways. By comparing the various abridged versions, the current editors were able to piece together a much more complete version of the film. In a few places, the recovered scenes really changed the way I understood the movie. Even so, they say that as much as a quarter of the original appears to be lost, filled in with intertitles to indicate the missing scenes.<br /><br />Above all, Metropolis is an enduring statement of style. It captures the melodramatic excesses of the silent-film style perfectly. It also demonstrates the Art Deco style of the era in which it was made. The editors, in creating new title frames for this version, also used a bit of typographic style that was once common but now long out of use. Rather than using bold, italics, or underlining, they would s p a c e words to be emphasized - an economic use of type, back in the day when the additional cost for additional families of movable lead type would have been prohibitive. What is most striking is how the style of this movie lives on. \\"Bladerunner,\\" for example, mimics the pyramidal palace of commerce that appears in this movie's opening. It even copied minor scenes, like one where a blind is drawn over a wall-sized window. I do not think less of Bladerunner's director for invoking Metropolis's imagery, instead I think that much more of Lang's enduring vision.<br /><br />//wiredweirdnk that much more of Lang's enduring vision.<br /><br />//wiredweird
B000F7CMRW|4.0|\\"Syriana\\" is a complicated, but thought-provoking film.  It has been said time and again that the movie has too many threads to follow.  That may be true, but you don't need a notebook to appreciate this movie.  Getting the gist of the plot is a better idea and just go along for the ride.  The characters are well-done, the tension is formidable, and the revelations are relevant and interesting.  We are asked to follow all of the main players in the world oil market, including an American oil broker in Europe (Matt Damon) who puts a PR face of the petroleum industry.  We also follow the CIA via a member (George Clooney) and his complicated identities and missions.  Then we follow the oil industry directly through a corporate lawyer (Jeremy Wright) and his attempts to create a major merger.  Meanwhile, diplomats and militant jihadists are maneuvering to make their mark.  The stakes of greed, terrorism, and world need are demonstrated well throughout.  Some of the best scenes in the movie show the price that the CIA agent and the understudy jihadist take to advance their agendas. <br /> <br />\\"Syriana\\" isn't an easy movie to take, but it is enlightening.  One can lament political correctness, but the question is not whether it has a political agenda, but does it ring true?  The movie does well to illustrate its point, and only preaches when necessary and only when it manifests naturally through the dialogue.  (Unlike \\"The Constant Gardener,\\" another excellent film, \\"Syriana\\" shows us more than tells us about dire situations.)  Also, the interlocking stories are not as clearly or neatly woven like in \\"Nine Lives\\" or \\"Crash,\\" but that's more of an asset; one that makes the movie more realistic.  It is not mere clamor to show that as our oil resources are dwindling, and developing nations are becoming more oil dependent, creating the math that will add up to some sort of (more major) crisis.  If you don't mind the story as it's presented, \\"Syriana\\" is a fine and illuminating movie.
B00009V7P8|5.0|Damien Rice's first major-label effort, \\"O\\" is a near perfect album, defining the path of modern folk music (hopefully, at least).  Listening to it three-years after its release, this reviewer half-expected to criticize Rice, yet there is little negative to say.  Every element of this album shines, especially the composition of the tracks themselves and the selection of songs.  This album, unlike so many today, is a complete musical idea, instead of merely a set of songs.  Beginning with the anthemic song \\"Delicate\\" that sets the mood for the entire album, \\"O\\" is both a tender and heart-wrenching album, filled with love and loss.  Unlike many popular albums composed around a theme, every song on \\"O\\" is completely essential to the `plot' and distinct sound and theme of the album.  There is absolutely no filler on this album as each song is fresh, original, and has something to offer - even if they may sound somewhat similar.   <br /> <br />The similarity of the tracks may be due to the sometimes-bare-bones instrumentation and singing of the album, most songs consisting of little more than acoustic guitar, bass, and violin.  This somewhat sparse instrumentation is greatly helped by Rice's and co-singer (since on many songs, she does a lot more than \\"back up\\") Lisa Hannigan's vocals.  His voice is gruff, but not in a Dylan-esque way.  He's more akin to Conor Oberst, and though his voice is much more soft and powerful.  Still, Rice's voice still packs the same emotional punch without getting as whinny as Oberst can.  Rice has an emotional range  - from tender to rage - in his voice that is both foiled and enhanced by Hannigan's soothing sound.   <br /> <br />The almost too-simple-sounding music makes Rice very easy to listen to.  His voice is expressive enough to ignore his lyrics and simply fall into the beauty of the music.  That said, Rice's lyrics are subtle and lush, complementing the music wonderfully.  Though \\"O\\" itself is a collection of doleful lyrics, there isa sense of hope in all the sadness and despair found in the lyrics.  This sense of hope, while propagated by the lyrics, is exhibited beautifully by Hannigan's prescience in the album.  While Rice sounds like he is on the verge of crying in many of his songs, Hannigan's vocal provide a steadying element, especially in duets like \\"Older Chests.\\"  At times Hannigan can contrast Rice greatly, exemplified by the song \\"I Remember\\" which conveys the prevailing sense of hope on the album.  Here, the contrast is most striking.  The two sing similar lyrics, yet Rice's harsh, pained, vocals jar the listener out of the lull created by the past song and-a-half.  It must also be said that the composition of this song ties both the lightest and darkest musical episodes of the entire album, conveying the whole range of emotion in one song.   <br /> <br />At times Rice's lyrics seem secondary to beauty of the music and Rice's voice.  However, they still play a huge part in the composition of the album and the song.  They lack social the social consciousness of many other folk singers and make up for it with a simple yet wholly effective lyrical quality.  They're the type of lyrics that you can ignore for months, while still loving the song.  Yet, once discovered, they enhance the music and vocals splendidly.  Moreover, the parts of the album when Rice's lyrics stand out, specifically in the most emotional sections of songs like the aforementioned \\"I Remember,\\" \\"Delacite,\\" and \\"Cheer's Darlin'\\" are some of the best in on the album.  \\"O's\\" flaws are minimal - \\"Eskimo\\" tends to drag at times but also is a very fitting and deliberate end to this exceedingly well-executed album.
B000FQJAIW|5.0|I am so glad that the original 1977, 1980, and 1983 versions will be available on DVD.  Sure they won't be in anamorphic, but between anamorphic and non-anamorphic there is very little quality difference, esspecially for those of us who have regular 4:3 TV sets.  (Just compare Star Trek: Generations DVD with the \\"Collecters Edition\\" of the same DVD.  There is little quality difference.) <br /> <br />We still end up with a 2004 edition disks as well, but I plan on mailing those back to George Lucas anyway.  All I want are the original unaltered films on DVD.  And now I have them.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|This movie is unbelievable, and worth all the setbacks in release. just inexpressable. looked almost human.....a masterpiece to say the least.if you have played final fantasy 7 and still do not own this movie, then the greatest of shame is on you. its just a little hard to follow in terms of story, you might have to watch it a few times, which is still a good thing. a must have.
B000002JBG|5.0|Okay, when the movie came out I went ape$hit (I was like 12) and I ran out to buy the soundtrack because it just had to be good.  I was right, for every track her perfectly compliments the movie, ranging from the crowd pumping anthems like Quad City DJ's 'Space Jam' and Spin Doctors 'That's the Way' to inspirational ballads like R. Kelly's ever popular 'I Believe I Can Fly' and Monica's beautiful 'For You I Will' and everything in between.  Standouts include the rap fused 'Hit 'Em High' where B-Real, Busta Rhymes, Coolio, LL Cool J and Method Man give us the Monstars theme, and the hilarious 'Basketball Jones' where Barry White trades lines with Chris Rock...insanity.  Say what you will about the movie (I loved it) but this album is cream of the crop.
0060837020|4.0|The Bell Jar is an interesting read that one could pick up and get through in a couple of sittings or less.  The book follows a 1950's college aged woman who finds herself while simultaneously going \\"under\\".  The book has an interesting autobiographical element to it and this version has a superb section about the life of Plath, which I found fascinating after reading the book. <br /> <br />For me the most interesting aspect of the book is the way Plath delves into the psyche of this woman who is losing a grip on reality.  It's surprisingly and disturbingly sad and funny at the same time.  I could relate to some of her apparent disinterest but other than that I've never been exposed to someone who has been deemed by society to be \\"officially\\" crazy.  At times I wondered if she really had a problem all along or if everyone around her were such \\"conformists\\" that she was just out of place.  Also the portrayal of 1950's psychiatric treatment was well done in an entertaining manner but not convincingly accurate. <br /> <br />The writing is a uniquely stylized 1st person perspective and I felt like Esther was telling me this story face to face.  It's disappointing that Plath's life ended so early as her ability to write novels might of rivaled her poetry skills. <br /> <br />I would recommend this book to casual readers as it moves quickly and is easy to follow.  Appropriate for people over 18 although most high school students could probably handle it.  Contains sexual situations and adult themes. <br /> <br />Bottom Line:  A well-written fascinating portrayal of how quickly someone who is \\"normal\\" can fall from grace.  Great window into 50's society and expectations.
B000A59PMO|5.0|This is one of the most clever and entertaining shows on TV right now.   <br />I started watching the season 1 DVDs and couldn't stop watching!   <br />Just give this show a chance.  I did and now I'm a fan.  Can't wait for the season 2 DVD! <br />And kudos to the new CW for greenlighting a 3rd season, (now just move it away from the same timeslot as \\"LOST\\" so you can get more people to watch!).
B00000K0DQ|5.0|I have never written an online review before. Also, Sean Penn and Sarandon and Tim Robbins have definitely gotten on my nerves in the past. Having said all that, this is a BRILLIANT movie. Sean Penn gives the finest performace, undoubtedly, of his life. He had me in tears for pretty much the whole movie. Susan S is also just amazing, as it director Tim Robbins. Absolutely nothing bad can be said about this movie. It's not overtly political in anyway. But also keep in mind that every form of human expression IS political to some degree. How can it not be?<br /><br />Sean Penn is my new hero, simply by virtue of this movie. Honestly I have never been impressed with him in the past. Maybe I was just missing something. But I have never seen a better onscreen performance than the one he gave.<br /><br />See it. You'll be an emotional basketcase afterwards, but you will appreciate this movie.
B000000OAC|5.0|I had this album on vinyl when it first came out, so I had to get it again.  I want all the readers to know that I had the opportunity to purchase Queen Platinum hits (All the Greatest Hits CDs) but I chose this album alone.  This album has many songs on it that did not appear on the GH album.  This is a really great classic rock album.  There is not a bad song on the CD.
B000068CNX|5.0|Even more remarkable than \\"Friend's\\" first dream season was the fact that it managed to avoid a sophomore slump. With so much attention directed at it, people expected \\"Friends\\" to crack under the pressure. However, both the writers and the cast managed to keep the show fresh and funny in its sophomore season. Major storylines included the tortured Ross/Rachel love affair, Joey getting an apartment without Chandler, Monica falling in love with her parent's friend, Richard, and Phoebe beginning her search for her family. Some of the best episodes from this season include \\"TOW Ross's New Girlfriend,\\" \\"TOW Heckles Dies,\\" \\"TOW Five Steaks and an Eggplant,\\" \\"TOW Ross Finds Out,\\" \\"TOW the List,\\" \\"TOW Phoebe's Dad,\\" \\"TOW the Lesbian Wedding,\\" \\"TOW the Prom Video,\\" \\"TOW Ross and Rachel..You Know,\\" and \\"TOW the Two Parties.\\" Ross and Rachel ultimately drive this season and the chemistry between Schwimmer and Aniston is amazing and will carry throughout the rest of the series. Aniston is especially funny here and viewers can see her beginning to grow as an actress and comedian. Aniston really brings a vulnerability to Rachel and even when shes conniving to get Ross away from Julie, viewers still root for her. She steals the show in \\"TOW Ross's New girlfriend\\" (\\"Ins't that kick you in the crotch, spit on your neck fantasic?\\") and \\"TOW Ross Finds Out\\" (\\"And THAT my friend is what they call closure..\\"). Season Two is one of the best seasons of this long running sitcom and will provide many laughs for years to come.

B0000028M7|5.0|I thought you all may enjoy this little story....I was reading these reviews for one of the BEST bands ever when I ran across the idiotic statement made by \\"I love fall out boy\\".  People should NOT comment on things they don't know about. It's annoying to those of us who do.   Godsmack, of course, picked their name from the AIC song... however the irony in this whole thing is that as I was reading these comments today I thought the TRUE die hard AIC fans might enjoy the fact that I am wearing my Layne Staley memorial T-sheet that I purchased at the beach this year!  In addition, and here is the irony, about 2 weeks ago I took my 15 year old daughter and 3 friends to see Fallout Boy, From First to Last, All American Rejects, and Hawthorne Heights.  My daughter made me wear the Layne Staley t-shirt!!! I received many, many comments... Ironic huh??! Love to Layne and the remaining members of Alice in Chains!! P.S. I'm a rockin' 42 year old mom.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|I was surfing through Amazon looking for DVD's to buy and stumbled across BBM (again) started reading reviews, got all teary-eyed, and thought \\"I'll just watch the first few minutes\\"  yeah, right.   I've seen the movie 11 times now, 4 in the theatre, the rest on DVD, never get tired of it, keep finding new little details and nuances, still made me cry 3 times.   An absolutely classic, heartbreaking, work of art.   Once someone told me a tattoo was something \\"they\\" could never take away from you.   I guess I feel the film Brokeback Mountain is something \\"they\\" can never take away from me.   I would also urge anyone who watches it, to go all the way through the final credits and listen to both the songs.   think of them as Ennis's feelings as he continues through his life alone, up to being the old cowboy who Annie saw in a bar and inspired the story in the first place.   and say a little prayer of thanks for everyone who made this movie.
0060557818|5.0|Neil Gaiman's \\"Neverwhere\\", is one of my all time favorite books. <br /> <br />It follows the trials and tribulations of Richard Mayhew, a man who lived in London, until one fateful day he stops to help a small girl bleeding on the sidewalk. He takes her back to his appartment where he cares for her until two unsightly men stroll in looking for her. Richard's world is suddenly turned upside down as he realizes that somehow, no one knows he exists anymore. He is soon after hurdled into a wild nightmare of an adventure where people can speak with rats, men come back from the dead, and every mythical being is actually living (or dead by a certain Hunter's hand) in the sewers underneath the world. <br /> <br />Neil Gaiman never ceases to amaze me with his story telling. He has, once again, outdone himself. <br /> <br />This book is appropriate for anyone really, although kids under 12 might not understand some of it. Overall this is an excellent and (very) quick read. The action moves along at just the right pace and there is hardly ever a dull moment. I reccomend this book to anyone looking for a good fantasy adventure.

B00005QTU3|5.0|When my son suggested that we watch Shrek, I only grudgingly agreed, especially as he had already seen it. Still, how often can one get a son to do anything with his mother? So, we hunkered down to watch the film, and am I ever glad that I did. It was absolutely hilarious! This totally irreverent film pokes fun at many fairytale icons. Based upon the book of the same name by William Steig, this is a no holds barred, fractured fairytale, laden with humor, superlative animation, a great script, and a surprising ending. What more can a film lover ask for? It is simply a fabulous film that is sure to appeal to young and old alike.<br /><br />Shrek (Mike Myers) is a giant, green ogre, who is definitely not a candidate for Mr. America. He lives a solitairy, sterile, and lonely life in a swamp. One day, his whole world is turned up side down. When the diminutive and evil Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow) decides to evict all fairytale characters from their homes, the homeless begin squatting in Shrek's swamp, and Shrek is outraged. After making the acquaintance of a loudmouthed, infectiously funny, talking donkey (Eddie Murphy) who has muscled in on Shrek's swamp, an outraged Shrek pays Lord Farquaad a visit, demanding answers about the influx of the homeless in his swamp. What happens at their meeting results in Shrek agreeing to rescue a Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) from a dragon's den and bring her to the ambitious Lord Farquaad, so that he may make her his bride. In return for a successful rescue, Shrek will once again be allowed to reign supreme in his swamp.<br /><br />The adventures that the donkey and Shrek have in their determination to fulfill their quest are fun filled and funny. Shrek, who speaks with a soft Scottish burr, is an ogre whose size and fearsome demeanor is belied by his tender heart. Mike Myers infuses this gentle, green giant with a tenderness that makes the viewer fall in love with Shrek. The donkey is brash as only Eddie Murphy can be, totally irreverent and outrageously funny. John Lithgow is wickedly droll, as the size conscious, power hungry, scheming Lord Farquaad. Cameron Diaz, who probably had the toughest role of all, is fine as the fiercely independent Princess Fiona. As Ms. Diaz does not, however, have a distinctive voice, her characterization pales alongside that of the other characters and is the weakest link in this otherwise sensational movie. The film has a surprise ending that is utterly charming and novel. It is an appropriate one for this unique and fiendishly clever film. Shrek is simply a great movie, animated or otherwise. Bravo!erent and outrageously funny. John Lithgow is wickedly droll, as the size conscious, power hungry, scheming Lord Farquaad.

B0000041Q3|5.0|I avoided this for a long time because it was Puccini's final opera - written as he was dying.  For some reason I felt it wasn't going to be good.  I could not have been more mistaken.  This is a first rate work and the performance is outstanding.  There is nothing wrong here.
B000B3ZFG0|5.0|As a young child in the nineteen fifties, I used to watch this film whenever it appeared on TV on \\"Million Dollar Movie\\". I loved it then. I love it now. Time has not diminished the capacity of this film to mesmerize and hold the viewer in its thrall.<br /><br />The story line is basic. Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong), a filmmaker and entrepreneur, leads an expedition to Skull Island where he discovers its deep, dark secret. It is a land where time has stood still, and prehistoric monsters still hold sway over the island and its inhabitants. There, the natives pay homage to the one whom they revere as \\"Kong\\", and who is, indeed, king of the island.<br /><br />Denham, together with his beautiful, budding starlet, Ann Darrow (Fay Wray), as well as with the crew of the ship that brought him to Skull Island, investigates the strange ritual being performed on the island by its native population. Before she knows it, Ann finds herself captured by the natives. She is to become the bride of the mysterious \\"Kong\\".<br /><br />When Ann discovers who the mysterious \\"Kong\\" is, she starts screaming and doesn't stop. The ship's first mate, Jack Driscoll (Bruce Cabot), who happens to be in love with Ann, manages to rescue her from the clutches of \\"Kong\\". Notwithstanding the fact that \\"Kong\\" has taken a shine to her, Ann is relieved to have been rescued by the man whom she loves.<br /><br />Denham then arranges to capture the creature, whom he calls \\"King Kong\\" and takes him back to New York with them on the ship that brought them to Skull Island. There, King Kong makes his debut, one that movie lovers will long remember.<br /><br />The special effects of this film were superlative for its time and still pass muster today. The relationship between the beauty and the beast still makes the viewer sit up and take notice. This is an attention grabbing film that is as exciting today, as when it was first released over seventy years ago. It is a truly timeless, cinema classic. Bravo!Bravo!
B000E8NQU4|5.0|I've bought a number of stereo only SACDs that sounded good, but not noticeably better than the CD.<br /><br />Happily, that's not the case with this stunning remaster of the Moodies' best album.  I've been listening to \\"Lost Chord\\" for 38 years, and it's never sounded anywhere near this good.  SACD does offer a more precise soundstage (that is, the location of the channels) and a fuller, richer sound, and this is the best example of this I've heard so far.<br /><br />Like others, I'd have liked a surround sound mix, but with sound quality this good, I can live without it.  If you have an SACD player, you should get this disc.  As Eric Burdon once said, \\"It *will* be worth it!\\"
B00004RF98|3.0|I have to start off by agreeing with John Grabowski, who reviewed this movie only two days ago.  Singing In The Rain is a three star movie, not anywhere near being one of the greatest movies of all time, and for those of you who call it the greatest, I have to wonder why you are saying that.  This is a good movie with strong music and dance performances but be real, it is what it is, period, a three star movie.<br /><br />The one \\"five star\\" thing about it is the famous dance number by Gene Kelly to the title song.  Kelly is so happy, so graceful, it's a pleasure to watch.  Perhaps that is all that the other reviewers are thinking about when they give the entire movie five stars.  But the rest of the movie is a bit dopy.
0307277674|1.0|There's no \\"there\\" there. From the subtle-as-a-sledgehammer character names (and characters) to the contrived cliffhangers ending every short-attention-span chapter, this was a book designed, its convoluted conspiracy theories notwithstanding, for someone looking for something to do while waiting for an airplane or the laundry, and wishing to seem intellectual while doing so. An intriguing idea and a great story that deserved a much, much better book.
B000002HJR|5.0|one of my favorite albums of all time. every single song on this cd is worth listening to, one of the few cd's you don't end up skipping around on. \\"losing all\\" \\"rehab\\" and \\"bury me in smoke\\" are, in my opinon, the best songs on here. the whole sound is a lot different than pantera and superjoint. neither band has the melodic content this one has, really bluesy overall. it's got all the familar pentatonic passages you'd here on a blues album, the kind of playing popularized by black sabbath, led zepplin and hendrix, but it's amped and constructed like a metal album. much heavier than their second cd.

B000003CMB|5.0|This rules. Not as good as Eat a Peach, but so what? As far as live albums go, this is in a class of its own. Four expert blues covers, three solid originals... what's not to like?<br />Things start with a BLAST. You get the intro, \\"Okay, the Allman Brothers Band...\\", then the band blows the roof off of Statesboro Blues. Listen to Duane's playing! Bloody AMAZING! And they keep rockin' the house with Done Somebody Wrong, which just smokes all over the place. Then things get cooled down with my FAVORITE cover of my FAVORITE blues song, Stormy Monday. Now I've heard a lot of covers of this, but none of 'em match this version. I can honestly say this is even better than T-Bone Walker's original, which is an amazing song to begin with. But no other recorded version can compare to the Allmans', and this is coming from someone who loves the blues and feels that most blues covers pale in comparison to the originals (even their sterling Trouble No More and Hoochie Coochie Man can't top Muddy's takes). Duane's famed Coltrane-esque guitar solo has been discussed so much among Allmans fans that I can't say anything new about it, and Dickey's isn't bad either. Plus Gregg's tasty jazzy organ chart, often forgotten but certainly worth mentioning.<br />So far we haven't had one of those famous really long jams. Enter You Don't Love Me, starting off with a little guitar blurb and handclaps (kind of like One Way Out) before exploding into full-blown blues mode. Gregg's soulful vocal is a high point as always, and the jam just takes off... I especially like the part where the whole band drops out but Duane, who (literally) solos for three or four minutes before everyone else joins in again. Then they slow it down and kick into a brief quote from Joy to the World before finishing things up. Fantastic. Also good? The unfortunately named Tom Douchette's oft-ignored harmonica playing. They should've just enlisted the guy in their ranks, to further their authenticy as a blues band (as if they needed any, because the Allmans always struck me as more of a blues band than a rock one).<br />Now we get to the originals. The first is the relatively brief, but intense, instrumental Hot 'Lanta. Then you get a longer one: the powerhouse reading of In Memory of Elizabeth Reed, which after its introduction mutates into something totally different than the studio original. You know how a lot of bands like to make live recordings of their hits quite similar to their studio ones? The Allmans wisely decided to break that long-standing tradition, resulting in a classic performance that some would say tops the studio original. I don't know about THAT, but this is quite an achievement.<br />Then we get to the monstrous Whipping Post. At over twenty minutes, I admit I find it a bit wearing - some fans consider it a classic, though I  prefer the more compact reading on the debut. However, Duane's playing is superb, even if they could've afforded to rein it in a bit. But there's a classic moment right before the start: you hear some drunk moron scream, \\"WHIPPING POST!\\" (at least that's what it sounds like - either way, the \\"Free Bird!\\" gag started as people shouting for Whipping Post at random concerts), and Duane replies with (I think) \\"Actually, we were just about to play that\\". I'm not sure if this is actually what happens, but if it is, I like it.<br />Classic live album.ded any, because the Allmans always struck me as more of a blues band than a rock one).

0385504209|4.0|From the first page of the Davinci Code I couldn't put it down. I thought the book was intriguing and original for several reasons. First of all the subject matter, I thought the subject matter was original and captivating. I have never read a book like this, where religion and history are the most interesting part of the book. I also enjoyed the plot. As I said Brown pulls the reader in on the first five pages and he keeps you attention the entire book. With many plot twits and surprises to keep in entertaining the book was good from the beginning to end. The  way things are explained in the book was also good. The book can be read by many ages and many levels of readers. I didn't think the  book dragged on too much either. The length was good. It kept the reader interested bit didn't drag out. The ending of the book is strong, though a little cheesy. Overall I enjoyed the book a lot.
006056251X|5.0|This book curled my toes...<br /><br />I love a good Bad-boy Good-girl story and Sebastian and Evie are about as good as it gets. Smoking chemistry, great character development, and a compelling story. Loved it!  Watching hard-core rake Sebastian fall completely and utterly in love with a shy, studdering wallflower like Evie just melted my heart. Kleypas is at her best here.  I can't wait for the next (and sadly last) wallflower story.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|Okay, I really don't understand what the big deal is with guys who say that this is a woman's movie. This movie is the combination of romance and spirituality, both are qualities of all human beings, not just for women. In fact, I went to this movie with my book club. There are both men and women in this group, and we voted, unanimously, that this should be the best picture winner.  <br /> <br />Of course, we all know what Oscar did after that...Another sexist move, but expected considering that men dominated the Oscar board. <br /> <br />Oh, and the reviewer who said that this is a girl movie, not guys, and that straight guys should not watch this movie, you might be interested to know that I reported your comment to Amazon as inappropriate. Sexists comments like that should not exist anywhere on this board, if not the world!
B00007E8O5|5.0|Oh man!  I can't express the affect this album has on my soul.  I was a big fan of Boggy Depot and had meant to check this out for a long time after that came out but for whatever reason I hadn't gotten around to it.  What a mistake!  This album is great!<br /><br />It runs the gamut from slow, soft ballads to deep, heavy, distorted rock tracks.  I love it!  A lot of the songs are very catchy and stick with you.  But the real hook is the emotion that flows from the songs.  It seems that Jerry really poured his soul into many of the tracks.  A couple of songs speak to the despair one feels as he observes a tragic situation that he is powerless to stop or prevent.  This has obvious significance in Jerry's life, but will reasonate with anyone that has found themselves in a similar situation.<br /><br />It speaks to me and will to you too.  Buy it.

This book deals with courage in many different ways as Peter (the eldest of the four)overcomes many obstacles throughout the course of this magical novel.
B000001F76|5.0|Hank Sr. ( as great as it gets in American music ) dies at age 29 in 1953. Hank Jr. continues to annoy us with musical litter to this day......Although I have heard very good things about Hank Williams  III.... <br /> <br />Here's another question; why don't we ever hear tragic stories about bands like Good Charlotte dying in plane crashes? Its always people like Buddy, Otis, and Skynyrd. <br /> <br />I'm not advocating murder...but why do sucky bands never accidently meet with a tragic end and \\"force\\" us to have to do without their music?
B0000070QS|5.0|An interesting thing about when a band takes time off to purse solo project, is that you get to see what each member brings into the mix, and how good a synergy they produce. A-ha is my favorite band, so I bough \\"Wild Seed\\" just for that fact not knowing what to expect...I was blown away. Not putting down in any way Morten's work as A-ha's vocalist, in this solo effort you feel the emotional color of every song coming thru with the intention of conveying the message as never before. This is particularly evident in it's spiritual songs: Lord, Lay Me Down Tonight and Ready To Go Home. Brodsky Tune and East-Timor contrast as political themes, one sung in anger, and East-Timor as a beautiful plea of liberation. This album almost made me wish a-ha didn't get back together (kidding)...just makes me wish Morten would make more albums in English.
0385336691|5.0|Don't let the slow, lazy start to this novel fool you!  This is Jack Reacher at his most explosive best.  The book starts out with a kidnapping of a mother and her child, and Reacher is asked to help the husband find her.  Only after Reacher has been working with this man for awhile does he realize how cold-blooded and volatile he is, and Reacher is kept busy trying to stay one step ahead of him.  This ia an astonishing book and the plot is relentless.  Lee Child's books will keep you awake at night finishing the story, as this one did to me.  If you haven't read a Jack Reacher novel, than you are really missing something, let me tell you.
B000E8NQU4|3.0|This release is stereo SACD, and not very interesting really for people who've bought audiophile versions of this album before.<br /><br />The SACDs for To Our Children's Children's Children, Question of Balance, Threshold of a Dream and Days of Future Passed all have surround mixes.<br /><br />The liner notes for most of these releases are cut and paste from each other. Which is probably why this one advertises itself as multi-channel, but it's not.<br /><br />The other surround mixes are minor reworks of the Quadraphonic releases from the '70's, but still are huge fun. None of them are hand-crafted, modern 6 channel mixes. A little disappointing, but still ethereal and a blast.<br /><br />Surprisingly, Threshold is the most interesting, with Question following closely, and Children's a nice third. I would have thought Children's would be the clear winner, but it's not.<br /><br />I don't own the SACD of Days of Future Passed, having bought it long ago on DTS DVD. It was really thrilling, if a little too back channel on DTS, and probably is the same on SACD.
B0000041Q3|3.0|I bought this a long time ago, and I'm scandalized by the plethora of positive reviews. <br /> <br />I was surprised by how whiny and pathetic Sutherland sounds. Perhaps it is the lack of runs and turns. Her Italian diction is horrible. Plus I hate how she attacks her notes, as if they are preceded by acciaccatura. She is evidently miscast. Nilsson spent her career defining Turandot. The verity and constancy of her notes are such a delight, and Sutherland's recording only serves to underscore this.  <br /> <br />On the other hand, Caballe was excellent. She is the best Liu I've ever heard. Her singing was particularly rousing. I wish she could make her breathing less audible though. <br /> <br />The rest is OK. The audio quality is excellent.
B000BB1MIC|5.0|This season is totally awesome!  Luke and Lorelai start dating and their romance blossoms throughout the season, Rory meets Logan, Paris and Doyle even start dating, and the same mother/daughter relationship between Lorelai and Rory exists throughout.  It's a little of a tear - jerker at the end of this season because Rory ends up in jail for stealing a yacht and has to go to court for it, and she also ends up quitting Yale because she feels she can't be a journalist (watch the season for details; I'm not giving those away.)  Lorelai's left alone in the dark when Rory decides to move into the poolhouse with her grandparents.  Overall, this is a great season not to be missed and I'd recommend it to all Gilmore fans!
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Classic Chili Peppers! This CD is the Chili Peppers style that I fell in love with. It's a little Californication mixed with Blood Sugar Sex Magik; completely sexy and rockin'.
B000F1IQN2|4.0|The movie was long, intense, sometimes slow, but worth every minute. It reminded me of some other terrorist masterpieces with depth - \\"The Battle of Algiers\\" and \\"Z\\". There's action, there's strong plot, but there's also gut-wrenching slowness from time to time that allows room for reflection. It didn't even \\"feel\\" like a Hollywood movie, more like old European classic. I greatly appreciate Spielberg for being able to approach the heated Israeli vs Palestinians themes with such finesse.  The movie shows both the passionate attachment to the land of Israel (Avner, his mother, Golda Meir and others) and the heartbreaking struggle with the consequences of violence that goes around, around and around, destroying everything that's on its way (Avner at the end of the movie and lots of deaths on both sides). Movies or other popular media have the power to change or skew people's perception of history. I think that this movie adds an amazingly balanced, touching and thoughtful dimension to the remembrance of the events it is based on.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|The number of reviews here in Amazon.com is exceeding 800 as of this writing. Some are critical reviews but most are expressions of emotion. I cannot blame these people, Brokeback Mountain is a film so moving that left me in a new level of cinematic experience. What is more, it pushed me to write and share something about it.    At first I thought \\"movies\\" simply means \\"moving pictures.\\" With Brokeback Mountain, the meaning reverts to the root word \\"move.\\" Without a need for a detailed explanation, it moves the audiences not only on the emotional level but also on the physical level. It proves to be a force that causes the people who have seen it to move-- talk, write, share their experiences.    So now I understand a deeper meaning of \\"movies.\\" Maybe I am still young to decide it, but I consider Brokeback Mountain the real MOVIE of a lifetime.
B000005RYQ|5.0|The Police Greatest Hits cd is one worth purchasing buy one for the house and one for the car.I really love eight of the songs that are in this compilation.When I first heard \\"Every Breath You Take\\" I was instantly impressed the bass playing at the introduction of this song is really nice and still today even thouigh they are not together Sting is the glue that held The Police together he wrote many of the song they sang as well as played several instruments.\\"Don't Stand So Close to Me\\"reminds me of what a person might say when they get mad at their little brother or sister or if someone is just in their space.I think we can identify with title if nothing else.Another song that stays in your head all day if you listen to it is \\"De Do Do Do De Da Da Da\\"it is just a fun sounding song it makes you wonder where Stings gets the titles from.But all and all this is a really great cd.Stings <br />raspy but smoothe mixed voice pulls off every song perfectly. <br />Sting's longevity is very obvious he still has albums and collaboration to this very day.The police in itself was a great group and Sting is a great branch off from The Police.You gotta get this cd. <br /> <br />
B000002J03|5.0|A classic album, but why were Percy Plant and the boys so reluctant to credit their sources? Both Willie Dixon and Howling Wolf had to take legal action for this to be recognised. Shamefull. <br /> <br /> <br />
B0007KLH1Y|5.0|We just discovered Kapla at a science museum, and will now be getting some of our own. At the museum, I noticed people of all ages were drawn to these toys. Even young toddlers were making little stacks, my 6-year-old attempted some castles, a gaggle of preteens was challenging each other to build the tallest tower (and then knock it down, of course!), and even the grown-ups were having fun. At first, I just sat and watched, but soon my hands were playing with the blocks, too, and in no time I was building my own creations. My daughter and I could have probably played for hours. It's hard to find a toy that will interest kids of all ages, but Kapla certainly does. And it's a plus for me that they're not plastic and ugly, so I won't mind too much having them stacked around the house.
0671510991|3.0|Henry Kissinger is a highly regarded figure in American history within American circles.  In the international realm, he is considered a scheming, amoral con who turned the idealism of JFK New Frontier into Nixon's realpolitik of bombing Cambodia and Vietnam.  Lost among all this is the reality that Kissinger had to work in; a world of unequal powers, each with their own wants and needs.  Kissinger, a man of no arms, had to practice diplomacy to achieve conflicting wants and needs.  As such, he is probably America's most famous diplomat during the 20th century.  This book is his take on the art and history of diplomacy over the last 300 years.  Covering the major wars and treaties, agreements and arguments, this book traces the role of diplomacy and diplomats at various times and places and how they have affected history by words.  Examples include the Treaty of Versailles, the Treaty of Westphalia, and of course the formation of the UN after WWII.  In all these events, Kissinger shows how the words of a few usually determined the fates of the many; regardless of whether the few came from democracies or dictatorships.   <br /> <br />All in all, this is a good history book, though it fails in several respects.  First, it does not fully account for the power of corporate interests within the realm of international relations.  Second, many of the affairs in the modern world were not solely manmade.  Instead, nature has played a great role in determining human events.  Example, WW1 was surely shortened by the breakout of the influenza epidemic.  Third, the book also underestimates the role of non-governmental entities in the role of international relations.  Witness the role of the press in getting the British out of India, or Christian missionaries in exposing Leopold's reign over the African Congo.  But overall, this is still a good book to read.

B0000028RR|4.0|What can I add what anybody has said before? This is an album that started a new genre (crossover) just like Korn did with nu metal. Some believe Urban dance squad started it but i still believe Rage was first. It's influential cause of this and their new experiments with riffs and other guitar sounds. No catchy, 3 minute bubblegum pop tunes but long, experimental masterpieces. Morello's 'space-guitar' is incredible and Zacks flow and rhymes are intelligent and witty. Everytime I put on on of these songs I get chills and emotionally moved. Only thing I noticed is that all songs have the same structure. They all end with Zack shouting a repeated line. They influenced almost all crossover bands that shout their nonsense lyrics in their mics today. They also were a great, overwhelming live experience (I still watch woodstock '99 every now and then). Only bad thing about them was they split up. What do we got instead? Audioslave? meh
0345440900|3.0|I borrowed this book from a friend who swore by it.  I loved Ms. Hogg's conversational approach, and her tips about being sensitive to your child and treating him/her with respect even from birth.  I followed her advice and explained what was going on to my daughter from day one, and almost instantly she actually liked having her diaper changed as much as possible.   <br /> <br />However, while she claims to be \\"balanced\\" in regards to setting up a routine vs. a strict schedule, her recommendations inherently lead the nervous 1st time mommy like myself to the \\"scheduled\\" philosophy that she says she opposes.  She also does not provide valuable tips for overcoming obstacles with breastfeeding. <br /> <br />Her \\"start as you mean to go on\\" philosophy has strengths, but the breastfeeding schedule that she proposes is one that only works with the \\"perfect feeder\\".  My daughter had difficulty latching on and sucking... period.  I believe that limiting her exposure to the breast as early as 4 days old sabotaged our breastfeeding.  While she says to pay attention to the child's cues, she does not offer real assistance in the event of breastfeeding difficulty.  I wish I would have read more of the \\"attachment parenting\\" info because my daughter needed that type of approach earlier on. <br /> <br />The fact of the matter is that every childbirth experience is different, every mother's personality is different, and every baby is different.  My daughter's temperament is much different now than it was at first, because she is full and content instead of starving due to a nervous mommy trying to follow the advice of someone who was not even there. <br /> <br />So, while I recommend this book as a reference guide, I would encourage new moms to read books that follow the AAP guidelines and encourage \\"babying your baby\\", especially if their child doesn't catch on to nursing very easily.
B000009CEM|4.0|Fear Factory. \\"Obsolete\\"<br /><br />I have 2 of Fear Factory's CDs, \\"Demanufacture\\" and this. I'm working on getting \\"Archetype\\". \\"Obsolete\\" is somewhat of a concept album, about Edgecrusher, killing two people thingies Smasher/Devourer and Securitron. At least I think it is.<br /><br />This isn't really hard, at times it is, but it's mostly either soft or just kinda hard. This doesn't apply to \\"Shock\\", however, which starts the album off with a bang, and is also the loudest song on the disc.<br /><br />I would have preferred getting the new \\"Special Edition\\" of Obsolete, which contains 5 new tracks, but I got this off of eBay for 3 bucks, so I'm okay with it. Let's take a rundown of the tracks.<br /><br />1) Shock: As I said before, it starts off loud. A little 10-second opener thingy, then the guitars and drums kick in and at around 30 seconds, Burton Bell screams out \\"SHOCK!\\" Starts off fast and good.<br /><br />10/10<br /><br />2) Edgecrusher: Not as hard as \\"Shock\\", but it's still kind of fast. Continues on as really good.<br /><br />10/10<br /><br />3) Smasher/Devourer: I don't think this is as good as \\"Shock\\" or \\"Edgecrusher\\", but it's still kind of hard.

B000EHSVOG|4.0|Seen today, it is impossible to watch THE TOWERING INFERNO without reflecting upon the tragedy that befell the World Trade Towers on 9-11.  Perhaps even more disconcerting, however, is the discovery that the construction of the World Trade Towers actually prompted the two novels upon which THE TOWERING INFERNO was based: THE TOWER by Richard Martin Stern and THE GLASS INFERNO by Thomas M. Scortia and Frank M. Robinson, both of which concerned out-of-control fires in skyscrapers.<br /><br />When the 1972 success of THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE gave producer Irwin Allen the title \\"Master of Disaster,\\" Allen set out to live up to it and moved to acquire the rights to THE TOWER.  20th Century Fox was outbid by Warner Brothers--but Allen saw a way to turn a big project into a bigger one and encouraged Fox to snap up the rights to the Scortia and Robinson novel.  Allen then managed to negotiate a deal that found Fox and Warner combining forces on a single film: THE TOWERING INFERNO.  As written by Stirling Slilliphant, the story concerned the world's tallest building on its grand opening--when shoddy constructions causes a fire that traps hundreds of people above the eighty-first floor.<br /><br />In a general sort of way, INFERNO might have been called POSEIDON REDUX, for while the specifics were quite different the concept was essentially the same: an all-star cast trapped by a disaster and forced to fight for their lives.  And the cast is amazing; not only did Allen succeed in getting Steve McQueen and Paul Newman to co-star, he signed Faye Dunaway to play Newman's love interest and cast Fred Astaire against type as a con-man.  Even more astonishingly, he lured reclusive and legendary film star Jennifer Jones out of retirement for the sympathetic role of Lisolette Mueller.  Other notables include William Holden, Richard Chamberlin, Robert Wagner, Susan Blakely, Robert Wagner, Susan Flannery, Robert Vaughn, and a pre-scandal O.J. Simpson.<br /><br />But POSEIDON and INFERNO differ in two very significant ways.  POSEIDON focuses on the struggles of ten people who acted as a single unit throughout the film; INFERNO casts a wider net with multiple story lines, and the result is considerably looser in terms of plot and action.  With the exception of long shots of the ship, POSEIDON did not use minitures--and indeed every set and effect was real time; the sets were real, the water was real, the fire was real, and the cast (which did most of the stunts) was very much in the middle of it.  The fire and the heights involved in INFERNO, however, were too dangerous for such, and consequently INFERNO makes considerable use of minatures, various process shots (matte paintings and rear projection), and stunt people.  Some of this has not dated well at all.<br /><br />With its loose structure, the occasional dated effect, and a running time of almost three hours, THE TOWERING INFERNO is sometimes less tense than simply wearing--but only occasionally, and even with these defects it remains a visually fascinating display of pre-CGI \\"state of the art in special effects.\\"  At its best, it is an extremely exciting film, and certainly 1974 audiences found it so; it would play in theatrical release for close to a full year, becoming one of the biggest box office hits of the decade.<br /><br />The Special Edition DVD release is quite fine, including a host of extras that range from a nicely done AMC Backstory documentary to an interview with Irwin Allen himself; the various commentary tracks (one of the scene specific re effects and stuntwork) are also well done, although I did think it a pity that none of the surviving cast could be lured into commentaries of their own.  The picture quality is excellent and the sound quality quite good.  People will probably always argue about which is better: THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE or THE TOWERING INFERNO.  My money is on POSEIDON, but there's no denying that INFERNO, even with its occasional flaws, is right up there in the genre.

0812550706|5.0|Ender's Game is a great science-fiction book. For all of those who like science-fiction books, this is the book for you. Ender's Game takes place in the future where the world is in fear of the return of an alien race, the Buggers, which attacked seventy years ago. All children have to go to Battle School. While at Battle School are given a monitor on the back of their head at birth to see if they're smart enough to go threw school. All the children go to Battle School to learn combat and strategy incase the Buggers return. A small, six-year old named Ender who lives with his abusive brother, Peter, his loving sister, Valentine, and parents, must make the decision to go to Battle School or not. If he goes, he will not be able to see his family again until he is sixteen. If he stays on Earth, he will have to endure his brother Peter and his torture. In the end, he does go to space for Battle School, not knowing of the jealousy, fear and lament that await him. Ender's Game is a good sci-fi book that kept me involved. I would recommend this book to a person who loves reading science-fiction books. It also can be a bit tedious and graphic. I think the majority of people will enjoy this book.

B00006HAZG|4.0|I saw this movie after seeing Daniel Radcliffe in all 4 Harry Potter movies and I must confess that his acting touched me more here than in any of his other roles. I love Daniel Radcliffe but I wonder what happens to boys as they grow up? Do they find that they have to hide their feelings as they get older? This is what struck me in his more grown up films. All I have to say is for Dan to look at this and tap into what made his performance so excellent here. Please learn to cry again on film. <br /> <br />Maggie Smith is memorable as usual and Bob Hoskins is a delight. I must say that the second half of the movie is a bit of a snooze. The portrayal of the older David Copperfield is not nearly as interesting. Other than this I highly recommend it especially if you are a Daniel Radcliffe, Harry Potter or Dickens lover.

1932907009|5.0|Like a lot of would-be screenwriters, I've bought the <br />books and attended the seminars. There's plenty of useful <br />information available but there's also a lot of self- <br />important garbage. The bottom line for someone who wants to <br />write screenplays is: how do I put it together and SELL <br />it? Art is fine but paying the mortgage and establishing a <br />presence in the business is far better. Blake Snyder has <br />done all of us a great favor by breaking down the elements <br />in a successful screenplay so they make sense. Of just as <br />much value is his emphasis on what must happen before <br />FADE IN is typed. That ALONE makes the book well worthwhile <br />but the whole package is well-presented and really  <br />helped jump-start my current project. Highly recommended.
B000CC4GEW|4.0|This looks like a VHS copy onto a DVD, and sounds like one also.  Such a great picture needs a studio remastering onto DVD, why this hasn't happened is beyond me. I would have given this 3 stars, but it is such a wonderful movie with so many real extras in the battle scenes. Rod Steiger is outstanding.
B000ETRCMQ|3.0|Kudos to the Weinstein Company and IFC films for delivering a no holds barred movie.<br /><br />Summary: The name sort of says it all - this is a film about a transgendered person, and their travels across America.  The performances by Felicity Huffman and Kevin Zegers are outstanding.  I do not watch \\"Desperate Housewives\\", and have never seen Kevin perform, so their is no bias here.  Felicity IS this film - she carries the story.  Bree (Huffman) is about to undergo transgender surgery and become a woman when she receives a call that her 17-year old son (whom she thought was long gone from her life), is in jail in New York City and needs help.  And so begins the journey.  Bree heads to New York where she and Toby (Zegers) meet.  They begin a trek across country so that Bree can be in Los Angeles in about a week for her surgery.  Toby makes a living on the street, hustling men and women, drugs, whatever it takes.  The combination is not a match made in heaven, but makes for an interesting storyline.<br /><br />What I Liked: The relationship that develops between Bree and Toby is real, it is believable.  It is also odd and complex.  The viewer learns quickly that Bree is Toby's father, but she keeps this a secret from Toby through most of the film.  She also keeps her transgender status a secret as well.  They meet a host of characters as they travel across America.  And with each visit, we learn the true meaning of \\"dysfunction\\".<br /><br />What I Did NOT Like: I started wathcing the movie a week ago, and took a call from a friend.  I was about 30 minutes into the film, and had yet to be caught.  So it took me a week to finish watching it.  From my perspective, it moved at 1 speed, which is ok, after all this is an art-house style film, not a big hollywood production (many of which are so overrated).  I watch a lot of off-beat films, and this one didn't grab me.  But is was a very good film overall.<br /><br />Final Word: The film is less about transgender people, and more about human conflict, understanding and compassion.  As Zeger (Toby) said in the DVD extra, his Grandfather pretty much forgot the film was about a transexual, though he added that he didn't approve of what Bree was doing.  Fair enough.  I have a very open mind, \\"to each his (or her) own\\".<br /><br />The DVD: Includes a conversation with Felicity and another with Kevin, as well as the theatrical trailer and a music video by Dolly Parton, which features scenes from the film.  A nice extra.er people, and more about human conflict, understanding and compassion.

B0000C1733|1.0|The Red Hot Chili Peppers' first compilation \\"What Hits!?\\" was released back in 1992, and considering the immense success they've encountered since then, an update is certainly due.  However, we'll still have to wait for it, because this greatest-hits collection is abysmal.<br /><br />Too many songs that should have been on here were left off, and in their place are songs that were never hits and aren't particularly good (\\"Universally Speaking?\\"  \\"Road Trippin'?\\"  I didn't even know they were released as singles!).  Only one song from the One Hot Minute album, \\"My Friends,\\" made the cut, and I'm surprised guitarist John Frusciante was that generous given his feelings toward the Dave Navarro era.  There's no reason at all \\"Aeroplane\\" shouldn't be here, and \\"Coffee Shop\\" merited inclusion as well.  \\"Love Rollercoaster,\\" from the soundtrack to \\"Beavis & Butthead Do America,\\" should have been a no-brainer, but, well, Navarro appeared on it, so no such luck.  But perhaps the most startling and unforgiveable omissions are \\"Can't Stop\\" and \\"The Zephyr Song,\\" the two biggest hits off of By The Way besides the title track.<br /><br />Of course you get \\"Under The Bridge,\\" \\"Give It Away,\\" \\"Californication\\" and \\"Scar Tissue\\" along with a couple of new tracks, \\"Save The Population\\" and the incredible \\"Fortune Faded,\\" which has a great hook and is one of their best songs of the past ten years.  Still though, this is a great example of how NOT to put together a greatest-hits collection.  I like the Chili Peppers quite a bit but this album isn't worth your time- just buy the individual albums and download \\"Fortune Faded.\\"

Mix in 2 cups of Star Trek, a teaspoon of Battletech, a pound of humour, 1/2 pound of Battlestar Galactica and mix ist well. During mixing regularly add Spaghetti Western and Cowboy Bebop sauce. <br /> <br />Fill this into a Joss Wheadon Form, decorate with great characters and commitment and love to a story. Bake well for 45 Minutes. Out comes Firefly! <br /> <br />This is one of the very few, extremely innovative, fun, interesting, lovely, back-to-the-roots Space Movie that i have seen in a long time. Relight my Fire-fly! <br /> <br />Must have for all fans of cool science-fiction/space action series. The box set features 14 episodes + very interesting and delightful bonus material. To buy this will never be wrong, except maybe you work at FOX Network .... in that case shut yourself into an airtight room and breathe until your breath stops.

B000002UAR|5.0|I was all of 11 when this unbelievable album was released.  I think to understand the Beatles recordings correctly, one important factor must be realized - American kids who were buying records from artists who recorded in foreign countries more often than not were listening to albums issued on American labels.  The Beatles were British recording artists signed to EMI/Parlophone Records in England.  In the U.S. they struck a deal with Capitol Records and thus, the most controversial mess in rock/pop music records was born.  The very early years of the Beatles is well-documented and by the time \\"I want to hold your hand\\" was released in the U.S. in 1964, The Beatles already had 4 or 5 hit singles in England (Various American record labels turned The Beatles down, saying that no one in the States would be interested in a guitar-band from England).  By 1964, Beatlemania was at such a frenzy that by the time Capitol Records was approached to release Beatles' records in America, they jumped on it.  Unfortunately for The Beatles and their loyal fans, the arrogance and stubborness of Capitol execs dictated into how they \\"felt\\" we Americans wanted to hear The Beatles' recordings.  Capitol would re-mix their songs (adding echo, reverb, lengthening or shortening running times, etc.) and even worse, completely dismantling their LP's by taking certain songs off of their original albums as they recorded them on Parlophone Records and actually making their OWN Beatles' LP's!  As a result, millions of American kids, myself included) were introduced to the Beatles as \\"Capitol recording artists\\" and conditioned to their recordings in the manner that Capitol Records issued them.  Not until \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" were the Beatles records released in the same way everywhere.  As a result, \\"Revolver\\", as released in the U.S., is a very different album than the one The Beatles recorded in England.  Capitol Records deleted 3 of John Lennon's songs from Revolver, \\"I'm only sleeping\\", \\"Dr. Robert\\" and \\"And your bird can sing\\" and put them on the U.S. Capitol LP \\"Yesterday...and Today\\", making the U.S. version not only unbalanced, but also much weaker, both in terms of artistic quality and song quantity (14 songs on the U.K. version vs 11 songs on the U.S. version).  I wasn't even aware of this whole controversy until about 1970 or so.  A record store in my hometown (Columbus, OH) had an import section, which had all of these original U.K.-released Beatles LP's and finally I was able to get hold of The Beatles original LP's, including Revolver.  What a remarkable difference this amazing and sonically powerful album is in its original format.  Many of The Beatles' albums were gems in their own right(s), made even more spectacular when compared to their contemporaries of the times.  NO ARTISTS issued albums that even remotely came close to the superior quality, production and craftiness of The Beatles' albums, and the U.K. version of Revolver has stood the test of time even now, celebrating the 40th anniversary of this rock/pop masterpiece.  George Harrison's scathing ode to the \\"Taxman\\", his Indian-influenced \\"Love you to\\" and the bouncy \\"I want to tell you\\".  Paul McCartney's sophisticated string quartet-laden \\"Eleanor Rigby\\", the beautiful \\"Here, there & everywhere\\", horn-driven \\"Got to get you into my life\\", the tin-pan alley \\"Good day sunshine\\", and \\"For no one\\".  Then there's John Lennon at his most creative.  The dreamy \\"I'm only sleeping\\", his crafty homage to a pill-pusher \\"Dr. Robert\\", the guitar-driven \\"And your bird can sing\\", and two of his most ambitious works, \\"She said she said\\" (inspired by a statement Peter Fonda made to John about \\"knowing what it's like to be dead\\" and with a powerful drum performance from Ringo) and the acid-influenced \\"Tomorrow never knows\\".  Add in Ringo's \\"Yellow Submarine\\" and what you have is the perfect blend of sphisticated pop music with an edge that makes this the #1 rock/pop album of all time.  No more needs to be said - - - Buy it and listen!!
B000E6G6DK|5.0|I have to say this album is exceptional. The instrumentation, the vocals, the lyrics the arrangement. This is an awesome soul album! It has all the genre of the late 70's classic soul brought new. I have heard folks make that statement a 1000 times...This time it rings true. For those of you who don't grab and enjoy the auditory desert of this album and you claim you like neo-soul or just good music,,,,, you will miss out if you don't experience On the jungle floor!!! holla

0790729369|5.0|What can I say but that this movie is the ABSOLUTE BEST love storey I have ever seen.  I think I cried through at least 50% of the movie it was so moving!!  It really captures what it is like when two people are soul mates and so much in love that they can barely contain themselves.  It reflects the kind of love that is rare, lasts a lifetime and definitely worth waiting for! It is absolutely worth the purchase and I am sure I will watch it over and over and OVER again!!!
B000EULJLU|5.0|For those who don't understand, I pity you as well as others who live this music.  The music made by these guys is like few other bands where it might as well be its own genre. <br /> <br />Though I expected a bit more, it is still a fabolous work.  The have been a bit progressive as of late.  THe Lateralus is probably the best to date, but it is great to hear the group of artists get back in the game and put a cover and album together to get even the most sophisticated of listeners on edge. <br /> <br />Don't ask your friend to make a copy or download; buy it........they deserve the money!!!! <br /> <br />If you have not yet gotten into Tool, go all the way back and get all of the albums and be lost in the words, rifts, rhythyms, mellodies, then make sure you go and see them live.  $150 is not too much so spend for the live Tool experience!!  I'll be at Summer SOnic in Tokyo this August 14th to check them out for the 7th time.  summersonic.com <br /> <br />Yes, the great ones have left the studio and are ready for you listening. <br /> <br /> <br />
0743454537|4.0|This is my first Jodi Picoult book.  Although, like a lot of other reviewers, I was disappointed in the ending.... I have to say that I still really liked the book and do recommend it.  While I feel that Ms. Picoult should have done some more legal research (Mom can not just walk into a courtroom and begin practicing again after sitting out for some 18 years!), but the medical information was great.  Also, there is NO way an attorney would represent himself/herself in a case of this magnitude. The old saying an attorney who represents himself has a fool for a client....... that is so true!   <br /> <br />I didn't really like the mom character.  She was so self absorbed in one child.  I think she was trying to not only convince Anna and the Court that she loved her just as much as Kate, but she was trying to convince hereself as well. She didn't have nearly as hard a time when it came to Anna dying tragically and out of the blue, but she sure put up quite a fight to hold on to Kate for years and years.  I just didn't like Mom very much - did not care much for her character. But, then again... I've never had to be put into this type of situation and hopefully, never will. <br /> <br />I thought the book should have had a stronger ending.  Feels like Ms. Picoult got tired of her own story and ended it as quickly as she could with little diffculty. Compared to the great drama in parts of the book - the ending was weak. <br /> <br />I LOVED the scenes with Kate and her boyfriend.  That was so very touching and sweet.  Probably my favorite part of the book.  I went back and read that chapter a few times! <br /> <br />Not too far into the book, I was able to figure out why Anna wanted to halt the kidney donation. I do believe she loved her sister and would have done it... it only made sense that Kate didn't want to go thru anymore.  Ironic, that with Anna dying, Kate ends up with a sucessful transplant anyway (from Anna). Seems like if she was tired of it all, she still would not have gone thru with the transplant..... espcially since it was coming FROM Anna thru her death of all things... UGH! <br /> <br />Anway, I really liked our little heroine, Anna.  Great character, hate the way she ended.  Still, a very good book that compels MUCH thought on a very difficult situation.  Recommended read! <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JOFQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie but I don't understand why it was considered to be so spectacular. Firstly, I found the first 40 minutes to be really boring. That's probably because I don't like Westerns and I'm not thrilled with cowboys. The dialogue between the cowboys -- two men with seriously limited communication skills! -- was painful at times since so little was said verbally. Obviously, that was done deliberately to depict the personalities of the men and the acting was stellar in that department.<br /><br />After about 45 minutes, the movie really picked up for me. It was a heart-wrenching love story, compounded by the fact that so many people got hurt when two men who loved each other married women instead and fathered children.<br /><br />Cinematography was fantastic and in general, I liked it very much but personally, I wouldn't have voted in for best picture.
B0002HTZJI|5.0|Note for note, the songs on this collection are the same songs you can buy which are availible on the studio releases, but the live tracks contain a level of energy that is not retained via a studio recording.<br /><br />Buy this album because you want to rock and roll harder than you could rock or roll by simply listening to the studio albums.<br /><br />I love the Chili's songs, and these live renditions of the same songs are off the hook; they are surprising, spontaneous, and they will cause shock and awe.
B0002RGNRU|3.0|In many ways, this movie reminded me of Vanilla Sky, except that I loved the latter and I could hardly get through this one.<br /><br />Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind started out strong.  I have always loved Kate Winslet and she does a bang up acting job here.  My personal opinion of Jim Carrey is that he is an excellent actor who consistently takes bad roles.<br /><br />I found the beginning to be funny, sweet, interesting and to have crisp dialogue but after a half-hour or so, the movie went rapidly downhill.  The plot became very weak and the episodes were so disjointed that had difficulty following what was real and what was imagined or taking place in a dream.<br /><br />Liked the concept of this movie but not the enactment.<br /><br />Sigrid Mac
B000FIMG68|5.0|There is no other show on television now that has been as consistently good as the show LOST. Of course, that's just my opinion, but I just feel that with each and every episode the writing, the acting, and the whole production value of each and every episode keeps getting better and better and better.<br /><br />This season was a little bit darker than last season. In fact, my wife almost threatened to stop watching it...promises, promises...but darkness doesn't necessarily mean negative. Darkness is the womb of transistion.Darkness is what we usually all have to go through in order to find some glimpse of Light...some hope...some redemption...and it is that small glimmer of brightness that we as human beings cling to. But as Henry David Thoreau once remarked, \\"Most of us are living lives of quiet desperation...\\"<br /><br />Desperation sets in when we forget about those shreds of inspiration that are contained in each and every situation we are in. I think that's what we're going to see in the next season. I think we're going to find the characters having more faith, more resolve, more personal determination to go forward but that doesn't mean the show itself will turn into a sunny picnic because life isn't like that.<br /><br />I felt the new characters particularly Mr. Eko, Anna Lucia, Libby, and Henry Gale brought the show to a new level of excitement. I'll be honest with you, I cried when Hurley found out that Libby had been shot. Oh, did I spoil it for anyone? Mmmm...I'm sorry...maybe you should've been watching!<br /><br />This show is a classic in every way and I would just like to personally thank JJ Abrams and crew for making quality television. I cannot wait until season three comes out, but I guess I'm gonna have to.<br /><br />It's gonna be a lonnnnnng summer.
B00003CXA4|5.0|This is one of the best movies that I've seen in years. When it first came out, for some reason I missed it or didn't think that it would be interesting. How wrong I was!<br /><br />Gandhi is a fascinating account of a true hero, a lawyer who tried to give Indians rights in South Africa in the late 1890s, and graduated to taking on the entire British Empire in his effort to free India from their rule in later years. I always thought of Gandhi as a pacifist but in fact he used ACTIVE resistance and noncompliance, and was willing to sacrifice himself, his family and his followers for the sake of the greater good.<br /><br />A sincerely noble, honorable and remarkable 20th-century hero. Beautifully filmed and very well acted. Really an inspiring movie that makes us shudder to realize the way that Indians were treated in their own country such a short period of time ago.
0767849493|5.0|I loved watching the version on Comedy Central. BUt I had to get the video version and I did real cheap. I am ticked off at Kevin Smith because he badmouths Linda Fiorentino who played Bethany Sloane. If you ask me, I think he wanted to get into her knickers anyway. I bought the film version and I have to say it's still one of my favorite films. I think it could have been better but it's still wonderful. I love Alan Rickman and Linda Fiorentino. I can't imagine the film without Linda. She is the best actress around. Using Janeane Garofalo would have been mistake since it would have been a completely different film after all.
0385336691|3.0|Before describing this book, let me mention that it is redolent in gratuitous visions of brutality and inhumanity.  If you like your stories without stomach-turning details, skip The Hard Way. <br /> <br />As the book opens, Jack Reacher does the unusual:  He repeats himself . . . coming back to the same place to enjoy another espresso two nights running.  While there, he's approached about a man who drove a car away the night before.  Soon, Reacher finds himself on the payroll of Edward Lane, a man who runs illegal mercenary operations abroad.   <br /> <br />Lane's wife, Kate, and his step-daughter, Jade, have been kidnapped.  Their driver, another mercenary, is missing and someone wants a million dollars for returning Kate and Jade.   <br /> <br />Mercenaries may be good at killing . . . but investigating kidnappings is not their specialty.  Lane has lost another wife in a kidnapping where he called in the FBI.  This time, \\"no FBI\\" is his guideline.   <br /> <br />Reacher has only a few hours to track down the kidnappers.  Will he succeed?  You'll have to read the book to find out. <br /> <br />The investigation soon takes an unexpected direction when Reacher's search ends up leading him to unexpected skeletons in Lane's past.   <br /> <br />In many of the earlier books in the series, Reacher is involved in highly unusual crimes or has to perform superhuman feats.  This book lacks both elements.  He's much more like a somewhat clueless gumshoe with limited resources.  His lightning fast instincts don't tell him what's going on until quite late in the book.   <br /> <br />The book almost isn't a Jack Reacher novel at all.   <br /> <br />I would have been happier if I hadn't read this book.  The story isn't one that would normally have attracted my interest.  The focus on disgusting brutality made the story unpalatable to me.  I'll wait to read quite a few reviews in the future before I consider reading another book in this series.
B000ETRCMQ|4.0|Oscar Nominee Felicity Huffman (Best Actress, Transamerica) delivered the best performance of 2005 in this film. I love Reese Witherspoon, but I'm not sure how she beat Huffman. The movie \\"Transamerica\\" is a funny, poignant, and at times disturbing film that decieves you with the title. The film, as you may have read already, uses the transsexual aspect merrely a backdrop. The movie stars Huffman as Bree, formerly Stanley, a transsexual woman who's sex change is in less than a week. Everything is set, until Bree recieves a phone call from the New York City Police Department telling her that her son has been arrested. Turns out Bree had a fling in college. Her therapist tells her that she will not sign the papers needed for the surgery, unless Bree connects with her son. Her son is Toby (Kevin Zegers, a long way from \\"Air Bud\\" here), a deeply disturbed street hustler and drug addict. Bree is hesistant about revealing her identity to Toby, so she gives him the impression she works for a church that helps troubled youth. As Bree and Toby begin a long drive, they make a few stops. One of them is at Toby's sexually abusive step-father's house (his mother committed suicide), another involves an Indian man (Graham Greene, in a strong supporting performance) who gives them a ride, and eventually at Bree's parents house. Writer/Director Duncan Tucker had a lot of directions he could've gone with this film; I don't know if you can necessarily categorize the film as a drama or a comedy, but it's definitley perfect in the way it was made. All the actors turn in strong work and I'm really surprised that Felicity Huffman didn't nab an Oscar. Being heterosexual, some of the scenes in the film are a little bit hard to handle, especially some of the scenes involving Zegers. Coming from movies such as Air Bud, Wrong Turn, and Dawn of the Dead; the former child actor is showing some bright starpower. Anyway, I know I've praised almost everything about the film there are still a few downsides to it; It drags at points and little things so it's not quite a 5 star film but it's worth checking out. <br /> <br />GRADE: B+ <br />
B000FQJAIW|1.0|So they decide to release the Original Theatrical Versions! Cool right? Well, it would have been...Turns out these will be sourced from nothing more than letterboxed Laser Disc Masters. It's ridiculous that in 2006 a DVD Transfer is Letterboxed and not anamorphically enhanced. Shame on Lucasfilm, who has previously released some top notch stuff, all in Anamorphic Widescreen! The excitement of these finally being released spread like wildfire, until the fire was put out with 1993 Technology and a \\"Failure to Listen\\" to the fans. There still could be time to change all this, but we'll see how THAT goes. Until then, I'd say pass on this release. Do what must be done..Do not hesitate, show no mercy.
B000002U82|5.0|One review that I read about this album acknowledged that it was not for the ADD generation.  True that.  This album is moving in a whole different way.  I recently saw the DVD on the making of this album.  It added a whole different dimension to this album for me.  I am constantly amazed at how gifted and talented people can be.  Being able to take pieces of music and weave them together just so, is monumental.  Interestingly my favorite pieces on DSOTM are the instrumentals.  Love \\"Any Colour You Like\\" to pieces.  For those who don't like DSOTM, so be it...  Doesn't change the fact that it's like \\"Whoa\\".  No matter what some may say, this album reaches for and grabs you on the inside. <br /> <br />
076790592X|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book that showed the courage of a dying man to still teach us a thing or two about living life to its fullest. It is a story that will reach your heart and have you look at life in a different perspective.
0385338694|5.0|There are so many reviews here for this title, but I couldn't help adding my own.  This was really a fun read and contrary to some of the reviewers perception of the main character as over the top, I actually found her character to be fairly reflective of corporate life for women and men on the career ladder here in the US.  I found the message to be very refreshing, that women have choices and options that don't make us any less of a person if we decide to opt out of the rat race.  I think the ending is clever in the sense that the author leaves it up to our own imagination to create our own ending and provides a pretty realistic picture of just how difficult it can be to make career and personal life fit together.  Once I picked up the book, I couldn't put it down until the end.
0425188809|5.0|Having read many of Dean's books, I can easily put this one in the top three. I literally couldn't put it down, and rather than the slow simmer some of his books seem to take, it starts with a bang that just never ends. Every character is full-fledged and three-dimensional (even the dog AND The Outsider!). Even in the midst of terror, Koontz is able to give the \\"monster\\" a soft side that may not have you cheering for it, but you'll understand where it's coming from. Highly recommended in every way. If you've never read Koontz before, this is the book to start with.
B000EOTAM6|5.0|I really loved this movie not only for the visually pleasing aspect of it but for the storyline as well. If you have never seen the animated series on MTV, then it may be a bit confusing at first, but like all good twist-ended movies, it all comes together.     My number one reason I loved it so much is that it is technically classifed as Sci-Fi, but yet, it isn't your typical floating cars, all metal, everything electronic future. It's very ethereal and visually beautiful.     The plotline itself could have used a bit more work to explain a few small things here and there, but if you have a brain in your head you can for the most part pick up on everything that is going on. A lot of people are bashing this movie because they say it drags on and is confusing. THAT IS THE POINT!!!!!!! They want you to be cloaked in mystery up until the very end.....it makes your brain think about all the possibilities........ I personally liked the overall plot. It was very enticing, and perhaps left it open for a very different sequel.     The animated series was very weird for most, Aeon died at the end every episode, which obviously worked for the tv series since DNA is recycled and a tv series has to go on........so some that have seen the tv series are dissappointed because of that, and for the fact that it was very sexually oriented and strange. They toned it down for the movie so that it would be suitable for all audiences. They even say in the costume design part of the special feautres that they toned down Aeons costumes because she is doing crazy stunts and they didnt want her flying out of her costume. I mean, things can't be absolutely copied and perfect for numerous reasons........have an open mind!!!! People that haven't seen the tv series, don't be confused.....it's not that hard to follow, people that HAVE seen the tv series, don't be so judgemental!!! They can't always make everything perfect for the screen.....    PEOPLE THAT ARE SAYING THIS HAS NO PLOT OBVIOUSLY DON'T HAVE A BRAIN IN THEIR HEAD. LOOK AT THE UNDERLYING ISSUES, SUCH AS GOVERNMENT, CLONING, SCIENCE. IT TOUCHES ON THESE SUBJECTS THAT RIGHT NOW ARE VERY CONTROVERSIAL!!!!!!!     As for the movie as a whole, the narration could have used some work, it could have had much better speaking parts, but it works for now. I like to think of the movie as more of a work of art then a movie. It is in all senses beautiful. (watch the special features on the main menu........they give you an inside look at the making of the movie which is just as entertaining as the movie itself)
B000E97Y6K|4.0|Everyone over the age of 16 knows the story of King Kong.  It is an icon in pop culture, including children's cartoons.  This movie helps to cement the story in modern mythology by using CGI graphics and fantastic directing.  I loved it except for the few flaws that kept me from giving it five stars. <br /> <br />The central weakness is Jack Black.  He is not believable enough in his role.  This character needs to be darkly comical.  Unfortunately, Jack Black is just too silly an actor to pull it off.  Danny Devito or Jack Nicholson would have worked much better.  Black's performance doesn't ruin the movie, but it is certainly distracting. <br /> <br />Naomi Watts was wonderful, and her performance was enthralling.  Her link to Kong felt genuine.  Her vaudeville athleticism was endearing and added authenticity to her character. <br /> <br />My teenage daughters couldn't watch the original King Kong because it was too silly and dated for them.  The use of CGI and the updated cinematography has made this film a classic.  By the end of the movie all of my daughters were crying, and I was tired.  I couldn't believe how much time I spent watching the movie by the time it was done.  It was only my own exhaustion that told me that, yes, in fact three hours had passed. <br /> <br />The movie is best in the theater, so watch it on a big TV if you can.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|I saw this movie long after its initial release and was quickly sorry it had taken me so long to get to it. This is a beautiful, powerful and heartbreaking story of Ennis and Jack, two men who fall in love in the early 60's in rural America. But while Jack sees a possible life with Ennis, the reserved and troubled Ennis only sees a future fraught with danger and misery (he was forced to view the body of a murdered gay man when he was a boy.  Instead, they go on to live within the boundaries of \\"traditional\\" relationships, only to experience frustration, pain and unhappiness, living for patches of love and joy during the few times they are able to get together over the years.<br /><br />While Brokeback Mountain is about two men who experience a gripping and overwhelming physical and emotional love for each other, it could have also been about an interracial couple, or any other type of \\"taboo\\" coupling of people, during the same time period.  This movie isn't about being gay. It's about people sacrificing their own happiness to conform, and finding out too late they should have taken the risk of following their hearts.<br /><br />Story aside, the movie is also beautifully filmed and directed, and the acting is top rate.  Heath Ledger gives an unforgettable performance as the troubled and fearful Ennis.
0060730552|5.0|Some of us are adrenalin junkies. We need to feel the rush, the tension and the accomplishment that comes with scaling 21,000-foot mountains, such as the Siula Grande. Then there are people like me, who would rather read of other's accounts of such incredible experiences. And Joe Simpson reaches your psyche in ways few other writers could. Part of it is just the knowledge and fearful horror of what he went through -- realizing that not only did he make it through the experience, but that he was able to articulate such inexpressible fears and feelings in such a vivid, moving way. Of course one can never truly understand what Joe Simpson experienced, but when one reads his words and begin to let your mind wonder into the \\"void\\", isn't the book as close as anyone would want to get? This vicarious adventurer says yes, yes, God yes.
B00005JOVH|1.0|Over the years, I've come to acknowledge the rise of power that is Brett Ratner. He's done two big name blockbusters (e.g. Rush Hour and Rush Hour 2) and completely adapts Thomas Harris' Red Dragon without all the substance of Mann's Manhunter. If I recall, his last film After the Sunset or something to that name bombed. This may be because simply Ratner is hit or miss.<br /><br />He was lucky with Rush Hour 2, considering he made the same film the second time around just with only weaker scenes.<br /><br />In X-Men:The Last Stand, gone is all the surreal imagery and intricate subtext that director Bryan Singer created in the first two. The subtle off whites and silver and blue hue is completely annexed into a gritty, yet far from picaresque director's viewpoint that is both shoddy and direct-to-video.<br /><br />This film takes the first two, especially the original which brought about the comic to film craze, and completely throws any semblance or originality out the window. This is not a smart movie by any means, but yet a video game without controls. This is action packed with some of the most dull scenes. This is drama that makes General Hospital (especially the latter years) look like Oscar-worthy potential.<br /><br />Horrible comes to mind...<br /><br />Not even Hugh Jackman, the saving grace behind any film (e.g. Kate and Leopold, Van Helsing, Swordfish) that is destined to be worthless, can help this sinking ship. \\"Now in the spotlight\\" Halle Berry rips apart the Storm character that is stretching it's legs far too late in the game. Patrick Stewart is the next wall panel as he is pointless in the film's entirety and looks bored to add. Ian McKellan as the redunant Magneto reiterates the same point and \\"anti-humanity\\" speech. And finally, Anna Paquin concludes her pointless attempt at conceptualizing Rogue. Instead of the Southern, wonder girl-esque charm, there is the typical $5.99 Hot Topic goth-emo chick.<br /><br />The storyline which does NOT sport Singer's X-2 writing staff is littered with holes that not only trip each and every character, but sink the audience repeatedly into the ground. By the film's end, you're either yawning or sleeping at home as you've left the theater thirty minutes into it.<br /><br />Nearly five seconds into the film, the score alone proves this film doesn't have the haunches nor pillars to support it's ownself. Whereas the late Michael Kamen's score brought mystery and aura into the original and Ottman kept the pace, John Powell rips apart any backbone and nearly suggests the use of stock music from a late Charlie Chaplin film.<br /><br />On the positive end, if there is any, Kelsey Grammer nails the character of Beast--even down to the fighting styles. It's not as surprising considering he should have been in the series since day one. Yet on the other hand, Ben Foster is an unnecessary angle and horrible incantation of the beloved Angel. Instead, his dialogue is choppy, flat, and downright hammy.<br /><br />Isn't Angel supposed to be drop dead gorgeous? Not machine bought abs and 7.99 hair coloring?<br /><br />Some characters do continue their growth and shine. Shawn Ashmore as the merciless Bobby Drake (Iceman) not only steals a couple of the movie's fall from graceful scenes, but sports a new look by the end that should make any comic goer proud. His counterpart, as with this film any positive holds a triple negative, Pyro falls flat and is inarguably pointless in the entire tirade.<br /><br />In the end, the storyline moves at a rate that not even the comic character Flash could keep up with. While doing so, it drops any thematic merit or conceptualization that the originals had and in it's stead placed hammy dialogue and without a doubt, thee worst character actor ever, Vinnie Jones.<br /><br />If you're into the old Power Rangers episodes, then you're also in for a treat. This goes for anyone that found Mortal Kombat:Annihilation both entertaining and interesting.<br /><br />Foranyone else, may God have mercy on your soul.
B000E6UK5K|3.0|The first two songs are really great!!!!! almost Floydian. David Gilmour is a great guitarrist and music composer, unfortunately, is not a good lyricist. Polly knows to write, but not for a music album, maybe some songs. This album seems to be very personnal for Gilmour and Samson, is like they are shouting to the world: We love each other and don't care even if we write bad songs. <br />Anyway, this is a record you have to own. It's David Gilmour at the end, and he plays the guitar like god!
B000F7CMRM|4.0|Great movie. Important story. Good acting. Nice to see something relevant in these times.
B000EULJLU|5.0|When I first got this album I was ready to decree to all Tool fans that it was their worst album yet. But oh I forget, you can't just listen to a Tool album once and know what you think. As if it were a drug in your system, taken twice daily, 10,000 days will get you hooked.  <br /> <br />First you must cast aside all your hopes and expectations and listen to this album as if it were standing on its own. Tool has redefined their existence, lyrically and instrumentally. Not as heavy most of the time as previous albums yet not being completely artistic either, they find the balance inbetween. Maynard's voice and the band's riffs can at times lull you into a sweeping melody that seems to lift you to another plane of existence, but then, seeming to be at the right moment they wake you up with a blast of anger and defiance.  <br /> <br />I would listen to both parts of Wings for Marie to be very slowly built up to the climax in Part 2 when Maynard cries \\"Give me my wings\\". When it gets to that verse \\"Your the only one who can hold your head up high\\" No matter where I am I cannot help but sing along as the buildup has enraptured me into the song, until I become a part of it, and cannot help but cry out at the gates. You may complain about the length it takes to get that one part, but perhaps it is the 12 minute buildup to that point that makes it so special. Much like a story that has you sitting on the edge of your seat, waiting for that one climactic moment where you can release all the emotions you had built up. <br /> <br />Those who see me listening to this album over and over cannot comprehend how addicting it gets. But if I looked at myself before I began listening to Tool I would feel the same way. I was adrift after the shift in Metallica's style, never finding a band that I could identify with. Then came Tool, first drawing me in with their harsh tones of anger and defiance, and then gradually taking me to a place that I had never imagined. Finding a balance between harsh and light, love and hate. I find it hard not to be swept up.  <br /> <br />Listen to this album as its own entity, it has moments that would satisfy your need to hear more of the Tool that you know. But you can never truly enjoy this album until you cut loose the connections and allow it to lift you up beyond what Tool was. Ever changing, never staying in one place, always pushing the boundaries, Tool has transcended themself.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|Emmy Lou Harris has joined Mark Knopfler and his excellent band, and I think she has helped them kick it up a notch. For one thing, there are a bit more up tempo songs in this CD than previous efforts, which contrasts nicely to the slower, more lyrical songs; and for another, Emmy Lou's soprano, country-influenced voice contrasts well with Mark Knopfler's gravelly voice. She also adds a couple of songs that work well.  <br /> <br />The CD works in both a musical and a thematic sense. \\"Beachcombing\\" is a great opening with a wonderful interplay between the mandelin and Knopfler's guitar. There are some good up tempo tunes like \\"This is Us\\" and \\"Red Staggerwing\\", both fun to listen to. \\"Red Staggerwing\\" features fast country fiddling, which works well here.Then, there are the slower lyrical songs with a melancholy edge such as \\"I Dug up a Diamond\\", the title track, and \\"If This is Goodbye\\".  <br /> <br />The main theme concerns the lonely, vagabond life of being on the road (\\"Beachcombing\\", \\"Rolling On\\", and the title track) and the pull of the heart back to the family and home (\\"This is Us\\", \\"If this is Goodbye\\"). The \\"centerpiece\\" is clearly the title track.
B000FQJAIW|1.0|Caveat Emptor! Buyer Beware! Don't go thinking you're going to get a great transfer of the original Star Wars films, because these DVDs contain nothing but shoddy Laderdisc rips that were created in 1993.  <br /> <br />Is it too much to ask for George \\"Moneybags\\" Lucas to just release the original films the way there were originally shown in anamorphic widescreen? We fans are not asking for a massive digital restoration, just an anamorphic widescreen presentation!  <br /> <br />Simply amazing that awful films such as \\"Ishtar\\" get released in anamorphic widescreen, while the greatest Sci-Fi films of all time get a slapdash, no-effort release. <br /> <br />I understand that George wants to force-feed (no pun intended) the terrible 2004 special editions down our throats, but this DVD release is as low as it gets. Boycott this release!
B000301YY8|4.0|When I first heard You're Beautiful on the radio my initial reaction was shock.  I was shocked at how bad it was.  I couldn't believe those piss poor lyrics produced a hit.  I wrote Blunt off as yet another hack product produced by the industry.  Mind you, I like sappy pop music but that song. . .Please.  About a month later I got to listen to the entire album.  I listened to it a few times.  I still think that You're Beautiful is absolute rubbish however a few of the other tracks are surprisingly good.  No Bravery is probably the strongest track on the album. And there are several other very catchy tunes as well.  I'm almost ashamed to admit that I think Blunt's album is better then Coldplay's X&Y (which I desperately wanted to love but do not.)  Blunt is sort of a love child of Coldplay & Dido. Chris Martin paved the way for guys like this & that's not a bad thing. The lyrics are deceptively simple, cliche'd but they inexplicably work.  His voice - you either like it or you do not.  In the days where most CDs can't boast more then 1 or 2 good songs, I think Blunt is off to a good start.  Assuming he's still around in 5 years, he could be an interesting artist to listen for.
B00005JOVH|5.0|There are one or two of you folks that seem to forget that the majority of the people reading your \\"review,\\" certainly during the first few weeks of a film's release, HAVE NOT YET SEEN THE FILM.  PLEASE stop giving away critical plot twists and story spoilers!!  Don't tell us who dies and how before we've seen the movie!  You spoil the surprise and the emotional impact for the people that haven't seen it yet.  If you want to discuss the film with others who have already seen it then find your way to the applicable message board or chat, but this is not the proper forum.  Thank you.
B000004756|3.0|I'm sorry to all the people who've praised this album so far, this was the only album (of the ones that I've owned) by ANY of the three great guitarists that I gave away for free.  For those who enjoy the Azzura and Beyond the Mirage renditions found on this album, I can assure you that there exists a better version of each on Al Di Meola's \\"The Infinite Desire\\" album ... don't believe me, just go out and listen to this cd.  As for Paco De Lucia, with the realease of \\"Cositas Buenas\\" he returns to playing the style that he was born for, and to me that is much more rewarding than hearing him on this cd trying to showcase his ability to go hand in hand with the other two guitarists ... quite frankly he's in a league of his own when it comes to the<br /><br />guitar! As for John McLaughlin he's more mainstream than the other three ... yeah he has more of those over sappy lovey dovy tunes that corrupted North American music throughout his albums. To me he belongs with Joe Satriani, Steve Vai, Eric Johnson, George Lynch ... the G3 style of guitarists. As good as he is technically, I don't think he's on par with the other two guitarists on this album.  Sorry for the directness, it's how I felt about this album! That's why it was an easy give-away.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|First of all, in response to a recent kid's review:  I see where your coming from so I didn't vote your review unhelpful.  Much of the pop-metal in the 80s was very glammed up and commercial overall.  But like all forms of music, especially rock forms, it wasn't always glamorous.  Metal had its humble beginnings in the late 60s and it took years for it to reach its glamorous status in the 80s.  Once it reached its height it died out and alternative rock, which also began underground, took over as the commercial king.  Maybe Black Sabbath is more important than Van Halen because Sabbath guitarist Tony Iommi pretty much invented heavy metal guitar while Eddie Van Halen simply redefined it.  As you can see glam metal did die out so it didn't completely take over the world.   <br /> <br />Van Halen did rewrite the rules for what metal could be.  Since they were 'pop-metal' they were more melodic and hence more accessible.  They were one of the first to do away with nearly all blues influences and instead write music that was more quirky and energetic than your average blues band.   Eddie Van Halen was indeed amazing on the six string and could truly make it yell, sing, and wail.  He mastered the two handed tapping method, showcased on the instrumental \\"Eruption\\", and was one of the first to use it in a rock oriented setting.  The other attraction was David Lee Roth whose charismatic vocals and fiery showmanship set the template for heavy metal and glam-rock frontman for many years there after.   <br /> <br />The Subject matter is very light and often comical.  Even dead serious songs like \\"Runnin' With The Devil and \\"Little Dreamer\\" are given a cloak of false happiness.  One noticeable highlight is the cover of the Kink's \\"You Really Got Me\\".  Listen to the original and then listen to Van Halen's version if you want to know what the difference between straight ahead hard rock and heavy metal is.  The labido driven songs would sound not only dark but tasteless and triteif done in any other style but because it is done in such a light hearted matter that the songs take on a fresh and almost romantic preference. <br /> <br />I'm not going to say \\"Get this album if you have any respect for rock music!!!\\" because you simply might not prefer this style of rock.  Maybe you don't like commercialized music and would rather listen to underground bands.  More over, just because you don't like the band doesn't mean no one else should or that anybody who does is stupid and blind.  When people write these reviews they are not forcing you to buy the album or else, they are simply stating whether or not they liked the product and reasons why they recommend it.  Overall this is a recommended product if your in to lite and pop metal but if not then maybe this is not for you.
B000069HKH|5.0|In a time of corporate created bands who's talents are a mirage created in a studio/music television and who's songs are always focused on sex and materialism in order to appeal to the lowest common denominator in human nature, it is refreshing to know that we still have great musicians who can avoid such cliches in order to sell a record. <br /> <br />Bruce Springsteen who's songs tend to reflect the common person, arguably sits among the greatest songwriters of our time in Rock and certainly the best thing to ever come out New Jersey. In my opinion, Bruce Springsteen is the greatest living Rock star we have today.  <br /> <br />There are few celebrities that have my admiration when it comes to their talent. As the Amazon editorial pointed out in their review of The Rising, even at his worst he is \\"very good\\" - the difference being, I see this throughout his entire career, not just this album. <br /> <br />However Bruce Springsteen is not alone, for beyond Bruce's talent, the E. Street Band has proved to be his greatest asset.
B000B0WO0I|5.0|Simplified brings some new along with old favorites. Simply Red \\"smoothed\\" out old classics. The new material is just as good as the 20 year old tunes. A must for any Simply Red fan. And a cd that new listeners will enjoy.

The movie was great. The visuals were phenominal<br /><br />P.S: wait until the very end after the credits have rolled. There is a tiny scene that you must see
B000FQJAIW|1.0|If you're buying this to get the original theatrical version, be warned that you're getting a re-hashed 1993 laserdisc transfer of the original films. The picture will be substandard on digital, widescreen TVs, compared to even the most basic modern DVD transfers from film.  <br /> <br />There are film elements in existence that could have been utilized to produce a much better-looking transfer to DVD, but Lucasfilm decided it wasn't worth the effort or cost.  That being said, if it isn't worth their time, why should it be worth yours? <br /> <br />Buyer beware.
B0000CNY27|5.0|A definite cult classic Sci-Fi that is dark, bleak and thoroughly enjoyable! Kurt Russell is outstanding as the over the top anti-hero Snake Plissken and has a lot of fun with the role. The story line is fairly solid and keeps you watching. And although by todays standards the special effects may be a little dated... they are still adequate. A fun no brainer for sure! Just don't see the terrible sequel Escape from L.A. It basically was a bad remake of New York and was very cheesy and almost sad to watch.

There is no pan-and-scan version of the original theatrical release on either the widescreen or pan-and-scan releases of this DVD!  <br /> <br />There are film elements in existence that could have been utilized to produce a much better-looking transfer to DVD, but Lucasfilm decided it wasn't worth the effort or cost.  That being said, if it isn't worth their time, why should it be worth yours? <br /> <br />Buyer beware.
B000AYEIZY|5.0|Whether you are a lifetime Cream fan like myself or not, you will love this CD.  Any CD that can make \\"Pressed Rat and Warthog\\" good is worth buying, but Clapton makes that happen.  When Eric stops leading bands and instead does what he does best (playing great blues songs as a guitar player and not as a band leader) he excels, on every song.  The consistency is amazing and unmatched over every single piece they play.  I was at the October 24, 2005 Madison Square Garden concert and was blown away by this group, and this CD is the closest you can get to that experience (sorry, the CD lacks Tales of Brave Ulysses, played in NYC but not recorded that we know of, though it should be released as a single).  Jack Bruce is still the amazing vocalist and bass player extraordinaire.  Ginger Baker still has what it takes (does anyone else play the drums so hard? I don't think so, and you will be impressed).  This is \\"the same Cream,\\" meaning high quality rock, but is actually better in some ways than the original.  Eric's solos are great on each song, Jack propels him along, though with a somewhat different style than in the '60's, and Ginger keeps it all together (though he blew the opening of one song in New York, we'll forget that; it was funny to see Jack and Eric walk over to him and say \\"what are you doing?\\" and Jack said to the audience \\"Drum Solo, Ginger Baker\\" and we all laughed).  When Eric feels compelled to lead his own bands, you get drivel like \\"I Shot the Sheriff\\" (a terrible cover of a mediocre song, with nothing interesting at all, guitar-wise).  When Eric is part of Cream, he has no choice, he must perform an outstanding solo on each song.  That's what makes this music great.  Eric, stick with Cream, please.  All 3 musicians are on fire on this CD, it's a keeper.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I believe 'September Ends' is the only song to date that has really allowed Americans to lament the losses of 9-11 without anger - this 'Semptember' may never end without expression, at the very least this song addresses the grief of a nation - and perhaps may ease suffering in release of tension.     On the whole, the album is great music, catchy and interesting -the lyrics give expression to and are critical of a generation of apathy, aggression and paranoia and offer the alternative of a politically interested youth.     Their popularity and success are attestments to the demand for more 'pop' that can encourage, inspire and at the same time be critical of our culture.    It takes courage to be different - and to speak out when you recognize the contradictions in yourself and your culture. Green Day have come a long way. And in the end, it is the music that moves and it is some of the best of the decade.
038551123X|4.0|This is a peculiarly strange book.  It's weirdly fascinating and very clever.  I laughed out loud on several occasions, but yet felt creepy doing so.  It almost makes me nervous that the  author seems to so thoroughly know a sociopath's thought pattern....eek!! I listened to it as a downloaded book from  Audible and it stayed in my head for days, producing a few chuckles in the remembering.<br /><br />It's almost like I have to listen to it again to make sure it was a reading experience and I didn't just imagine it or have a bad dream of it...it's that peculiar.<br /><br />Anyway, it's worth a read or a listen.  The only downside I could discern was the way too many \\"he saids\\" and \\"she saids\\" in the audio version.<br /><br />An honorable serial killer?  Well... yeah.
0765340798|1.0|This book is a culimnation of a spectacularly awful series.  Unbelievably, the downward trend started in the first book of the series continued and provided the world with this drivel.  I am simply amazed that the powerhouse science fiction classic \\"Dune\\" could be so bastardized and beaten down by the creators own son.  If I could give this series 0/5 stars I would (but can't find a way to do so). <br /> <br />I struggled for months simply to get through this book because I thought it might reveal SOMETHING about the main power players in the classic series.  Suffice to say, the explanations provided are juvenile, idiotic, and worthless. <br /> <br />Take the money you'd spend on these books and start a small fire with it.  At least you'd get a modicum of worth and good feeling... hmm.. that gives me an idea.. I can still burn these books and use them as cheap fuel!
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Overall, this album does not disappoint. You will listen to it in the morning before you wake up to go to school or work. You will listen to it as you exercise. You will listen to it while you do housework. You will listen to it with your friends with a few drinks before you get ready to hit the clubs. It is certainly her best album since 'Ray of Light'.  <br /> <br />Best to Least Favourite: <br /> <br />(1) Get Together 5/5 (Her Best song since Drowned World/Substitute For Love, gives me chills)  <br /> <br />(2) Sorry 5/5 (Very catchy, great video)        <br /> <br />(3) Jump 5/5 (Funky, great song for dancing) <br /> <br />(4) Hung Up 5/5 (Good song, I've played it a lot though!) <br /> <br />(5) Push 5/5 (Takes a couple of listens, but grows on you) <br /> <br />(6) Like It Or Not 5/5 (Nice use of guitar sounds, reminds me of country line dancing... but in a good way!) <br /> <br />(7) Issac 5/5 (Very nice vocals, nice international touch) <br /> <br />(8) I Love New York 4/5 (A lot of attitude, reminds me of an early Madonna from CBGBs) <br /> <br />(9) Future Lovers 4/5 (Avid electronica fans will love this one) <br /> <br />(10) Forbidden Love 4/5 (Slower, more laid-back track on the album) <br /> <br />(11) Let It Will Be 3/5 (A bit boring, you may skip this one from time to time) <br /> <br />(12) How High 2/5 (Weakest track, slightly forgettable)    <br /> <br />Go buy it if you haven't already!  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000AMJDHY|5.0|I want to add to those who have already stated that this album is great.  I love listening to it all the way through.  Panic! at the disco has given us a catchy great compilation to listen to.  I find myself, like the other reviewers, wanting to dance and sing along, music that does that to you HAS to be good.   <br /> <br />Ignore the reviews that give it bad marks.  I will never understand why people review music genres that they hate.  It makes no sense. <br /> <br />Danny \\"The Lover of All Metals\\" may want to stick with reviewing music that falls into his own likes, rather than sandbagging music that he hates.  What a waste of his time.  I mean, criticizing a band by their name and the name of their songs is pretty ignorant.  Based on the percentages of what people buy after they have looked at this item, I would gather that ZERO people have taken Danny's \\"advice\\" to get <br /> \\"'Good Apollo, I'm Burning Star IV, Volume 1: From Fear Through the Eyes of Madness,' by Coheed & Cambria\\" instead. <br /> <br />[sarcasm]Nice catch Danny.  Thanks for warning us about this product.[/sarcasm]  <br /> <br />Those who do choose to buy this album WILL NOT be disappointed.  I can't say which tracks are the best because I enjoy them all. <br /> <br />Dave <br />
B000EMGAGW|2.0|like any east coast rap fan mob deep is deff a part of my cd collection.  from the infamous to americas nightmare.  although i lost some respect when they started beefin with nas.  but if ur a tru rap fan u will always hold respect for mobb deep.  and its because of those rugged grimy lyrics and non comercial sound.  i mean who could possible listen to shook ones and say they wernt feelin that track.  it is tru after jigga dissed them it seems it took their game down a notch.  but they still continued to rap with substance.  i will continue to be a fan of the pre g-unit mobb deep. <br />now to the part that hurts me.  im not dissin 50 im just stating the facts.  the fact is this is no were even close to what mobb deep is all about.  and i no it is part their fualt but they are rappin bout money ice and hoes.  this is def 50 leadin them in the direction to make money and b comercial.  the problem is the mobb cnt b comercial.  they never tryed and thats y they were sick.  but 50 cent is now puttin a very bad end to a great career.  he is on almost every track i could have sworn havoc and prodigy were the only to member of the group.  but i guess under g-unit 50 wants to be in mobb deep 2  more then half the tracks are about how g-unit gets all the groppies.  and yes mobb deep is rappin about screwin chicks.  hey it hurts me to say it.  there are flashes of the old mobb the inafmous mobb.  there is only on song produced by the alcamist and it is tight.  i mean u sign him to g unit y not use him.  i veiwed this cd as a chance for 50 cent to gain some respect back in the real rap game.  i mean he had a blue print to make a classic raw mobb deep cd.  he could have had the alchamist on every other track put m.o.p. on like 2 or 3 tracks.  have buck rappin about killin ppl instead of bangin hoes and 50 himself could have not been on the album or like one or 2 tracks.  then most importantly told mobb deep to rap like they used to. <br />its def sad to see 2 veterains in the rap game look like the new york version of ying yang twins.  well dnt buy this cd download the 4 or 5 hot tracks the rest is trash.  R.I.P. Mobb Deep

B00003CXAA|5.0|This all time best Francis Ford Coppola's movie has simply dazzled all its viewers and won their admiration. From Iraq's unseated dictator Saddam Hussain to the average American Joe, all have named this movie as their all time favorite.<br /><br />Produced in the 1970s about a story whose settings take place in post World War II New York, Coppola skillfully transformed Mario Puzo's The Godfather into a successful movie with Hollywood giant Maron Brando and America's favorite Al Paccino playing the roles of a mafia leader and his younger son who took over family business after the father became too old to handle the business and the elder son who was slated to take over was shot dead in one of the mafia settling scores activity.<br /><br />The success of the movie made its producers release parts II and III. However, the first one of this sequel remains the jewel of The Godfather crown.<br /><br />Vast literature has been written about the anthropological and sociological manifestations of this movie. Two main themes, however, have found their ways to the forefront. First, the movie captures the mood during 1970s America during which most communities where abandoning civil rights movements in favor of promoting retrieving their different community character and the Italian-American community was no exception. Second, the movie has been often compared to the rise and fall of dictatorships around the world especially in Syria where the life of its late dictator Hafez Assad looks almost identical to The Godfather. Assad was grooming his elder son, Bassel, was killed in a car accident. This forced Assad to groom his second son, Bashar, who was not into his family's business but was later forced to succeed his father. In both the Godfather and Syria, things eventually slip from the hands of the second generation and become more difficult for the successors to keep things as they were during the days of their fathers.<br /><br />The movie is a classic and is certainly a movie collector's item.m.

B000EPR7NE|5.0|The Gladiator, King Arthur, Batman Returns... and now The Da Vinci Code..... Does this man produce anything less than masterpiece soundtracks?? Bought the album of The Da Vinci Code mainly due to the track Chevaliers De Sangreal but was in awe of the music mastery Hans has once again portrayed. Though you can make out subtle similarities between the soundtracks of King Arthur, Batman Begins and this movie (listen to all three very carefully and you will hear it, but its subtle and thats what i love) Hans' ability to diverge at the right moment is what defines each of his works in my opinion. I have always loved the soundtrack genre of music and this makes one more fine addition to my collection. Kudos Hans Zimmer for a masterpiece that is as ethereal and mystic as The Da Vinci Code itself
B000EJ9MTW|4.0|Nothing real original here, but it's nice to see the younger Generation Embrace Classic Rock. Pick it up, it's one of the top releases so far this year.
B00006IU73|4.0|This CD is a must get for those who like to be challenged musically.<br /><br />Porcupine Tree are an inovative band with a modern approach.<br /><br />Beautifully recorded and sequenced a must get.
B00005JOVH|5.0|All I have to say is wait until the very end, after the credits have rolled through.  There is a tiny scene that shocked me big time!  Just go see it and you'll know what I mean.    P.S.    Loved the movie!  Great effects, surprising twists, awesome action sequences, and a great storyline!
B0002N4ZEW|2.0|I really love this band, however this CD just does not do it for me.<br />The annoying voice overs are just that very annoying.<br />There is no vocals, the music is good but has no real direction.<br />I can't really listen to this.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|The theatrical cut was a mess.  This director's cut fills out and expands the story, without making it feel a moment longer.   <br /> <br />It answers the questions of \\"how did Balian know how to defend a city\\" and \\"How did he know how to fight so well\\" and \\"Why did Sybillia go bonkers like that\\" and all the others.   <br /> <br />The deep, deep cuts in the theatrical film made so many complex political, religious and personal layers in the story and the characters just go away.  They are restored in this cut and it is a glorious movie. <br /> <br />Fox really screwed over Ridley Scott, Eva Green and Orlando Bloom by making Scott cut this movie the way they did.  The Director's Cut would have been Oscar material.  <br /> <br />
B000EMGAOY|4.0|What we have here is an honest (and, at times, earnest) effort by RHCP to blend the fan-favorite sound of earlier, hard-rocking albums like \\"Mother's Milk\\" and \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magik\\" with the mass-appeal of their more recent indie pop-rock releases, \\"Californication\\" and \\"By the Way.\\"  <br />For the first time in years, John Frusciante's guitar is pushed to the forefront: nearly every song on this album has a screaming, wailing, creaking, and/or crying guitar solo likely to please most long-time fans of the Good Time Boys. And a number of the songs are graced with the hip-hop/rap flavorings that dominated their eighties/nineties material. At the same time, most of the songs bear the gentle melodies and slow pacing that has distinguished their 21st century sound. Flea's world-famous bass has staked out a middle-ground in the mix, neither taking the lead nor fading to the back burner. <br />As a fan of both the old and new Chili sounds, I was by and large pleased with this album and would say that the attempt at stylistic fusion was mostly successful. I give it just four stars because a few of the tracks sounded nearly identical to songs from \\"Californication\\" and \\"By the Way.\\"

B00005JOVH|5.0|I have to admit I was skeptical going into a movie written by the men who brought me Mr and Mrs Smith, but I must admit I was blown away. I find it a travesty that this movie is being disparaged when Star Wars Episode 3 was being hailed as better then the original Star Wars...Let me make this clear that movie blew and this one knocks it out of the park.<br /><br />From the opening scene when Angel was \\"cutting it off\\"...a little freud in this movie...to the climatic ending when Wolverine squares off with a very powerful x-men gone wrong I was hooked. Many are complaining why spend time on Angel if he doesn't have a big role in the end. My answer to this is Angel's original story is to help us understand the X-men who don't want to change, and Rogue is vice versa. Also, many are complaining that X men are getting killed off in an attempt to wrap up the franchise....if they were trying to wrap up the franchise then why would they have the scenes before and after the credits....and face it those characters which died were less than the most interesting characters and had to kick the bucket sooner or later. Other than that I don't understand why anyone would have a problem with the story.<br /><br />The action in this movie is unbelievable, but I think it has a decent story to match unlike earlier attempts at summer blockbusters (MI:III and Da Vinci Code). This is the best comic book movie, with the exception of Sin City, since spiderman 2.
B00005JOVH|5.0|I liked X-Men, really liked X2: X-Men United, but I loved X-Men: The Last Stand. I am a fan of Bryan Singer's work, but the new director did a pretty good job of maintaining the flow and feel of the last two films. The special effects are amazing and the film is well casted. Even Halle Berry redeems herself here for her less than average performances of Storm in the last two movies. The new mutants are all interesting, but old favorites like Wolverine and Magneto are still the focus. Jean Grey gets much more screen time, as Wolverine did in X2 (when it was about his backstory), but characters like Cyclops are still given nothing to do. Everybody in my sold out theater seemed to love it just as much as I did. The end credits may be long, but if you stay you will get a surprising 15 second scene that will leave you wondering...is this really the end of the X-Men franchise?
0553801503|5.0|The whiners and haters have it all wrong.  This book was an excellent addition to the series.  I loved it and I can't wait for more!  The only possible way to view it in even a slightly negative light is to compare it to the previous books, as Martin is still the best there is.  Ok, so the book largely covers only half of the characters of previous books, saving the simultaneous actions of the other characters for the next book, and that means it was slightly less epic.  And I never really cared for Cersei that much, and she is covered in great depth in this book.  Those are the best I can do for complaints.  And then again, I never cared much for the House Greyjoy and the Iron Islanders, but this book really added lots of interest for me, so I expect any future Cersei stories to be quite fasciniating.  And thanks to the splitting of the book in half, we shouldn't have to wait quite so long for the next in the series.
B000002KOY|5.0|This is definately one of the 50 best records ever made in my opinion.  From \\"Gone Dead Train\\" to \\"Crow Jane Lady\\" it's first class all the way.  Danny Whitten, Billy Talbot, and Ralph Molina, with some help from their friends Nils Lofgren, Ry Cooder, and Jack Nitzche, recorded this classic during their time off as Neil Young's backing band. This line-up of Crazy Horse (and especially Danny Whitten) helped Neil record his masterpiece \\"Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere\\".  Danny Whitten was the real deal and if he hadn't fell prey to his weaknesses, he may have surpassed Neil Young as a recording artist.  As I said, this recording is all first class but I have to give special mention to my two favorite songs on it \\"I Don't Want To Talk About It\\" and \\"Dirty Dirty\\".  This recording is proof positive that the original Crazy Horse didn't really need Neil.
B000FQJAIM|1.0|If you're buying this to get the original theatrical version, be warned that you're getting a 1993 laserdisc transfer from the original films.

B00005JNTX|4.0|First, I'll start by responding to the review below referring to this film as a debasement of modern society. The film's obvious lack of realism hardly constitutes a true \\"snuff\\" film. Albeit there's lots of death, mayhem, cannibalism, scrotum-snatching, people-perforating and so forth, it's nowhere nearly as horrific as the less frequent but far more chilling death sequences of say \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" and the like. This movie laughs at death, as it should. The characters are surrounded by constant danger, live in a dark gritty, sans technicolor universe that's both horribly unforgiving, vengeful, sadistic, and just plain hell bent on their bullet/sword-induced demise. Despite all that death, they manage to smirk and make snide comments. I for one just love that. One can moan and complain about the sequences of death in this film, yet never mention once the countless CGI lives that were lost in the medievil battle on the fields of Pelenor. Both men and horses were impaled stomped on tossed and kicked about by the hulking feet of the Heradrim/Oliphant hoards. A man was slowly engulfed by gigantic bloodworms in the valley of Skull Island. Maximus Desmus Meridius killed many gladiators to survive servitude in the name of entertainment. The list goes on and on and on. The point is that without death, without mayhem, without the horrid underbelly of man's gruesome intent upon his fellow man, the element of danger is gone, and the audience ceases to care. In \\"Sin City\\", the characters were obviously in grave danger, every sequence was a tick closer to someone's death, creating a hellish gray-scale world of tortuous villains, a cannibalistic sociopath, Amazon Hookers, crooked cops and other assorted ubersadists we would only meet in a dark alley in our worst nightmares. The film was so visually astounding that the look alone was entertaining. The narrative was just as dark and haunting as the high contrast shadows and ominous unseen light sources. Robert Rodriguez's possible cult classic spews violent eye candy, and at the same time  throws in some of the most demented comic-noir ever to be seen on film. I wasn't shocked by the violence, as years of video games and other violent movies slowly developed a thick callous, but I was immensely entertained by this story set in the Urban equivalent of Dante's grim account. The movie's moral anchorage is as grey-scaled as its backdrop. The protagonists use brutish violence to exact vengeance, but are also murderers themselves. This obvious ambiguity of the film is also what makes it so alluring. The good guys act like bad guys, and the bad guys act like pure unadulterated evil incarnate. Everything about this movie works, even the things you'd normally think cannot. Its purified escapist charm spills out all over the screen with beautifully placed yellows reds and pale cool colors set against a sea of cold steely greys blacks and whites. Never have I ever seen a film that looks so awesome, and with the exception of the impending sequel, I don't suppose I will for quite some time.

B000FC2FVA|5.0|Although I'm having a hard time understanding the lyrics, musically these guys sound like a softer, more accessible Strokes. Right now I'm listening to track #2 \\"Consolation Prizes\\", and I really like the rhythm of this track. The rousing drums and guitars have a real Americana rock sound you don't hear that much these days. Vocals, while not so original, are not grating or overproduced. I hear some electronic synths, but they're used in moderation. Nothing on this album is over-produced or overdone. A nice blend of catchy tunes and quirky lyrics.<br /><br />Overall a catchy and easy to listen to album from this french foursome. Well done!

B000EHSVQ4|5.0|Wow! After seeing Ridley Scott's director's cut--the definitive cut--of Kingdom of Heaven I became angry and exhilarated all at once. I was angry at how badly studio execs can screw over directors in Hollywood thinking they know what audiences want. (They obviously don't if you look at the awful movies that have been released in the past two to three years.) It almost seems as if many of Ridley Scott's movies are butchered by the studios--Blade Runner, Legend, and Kingdom of Heaven. All three director's cuts of these movies are heads and above better than the studio exec versions. I implore studios to leave Ridley Scott's movies alone!<br /><br />I saw the theatrical print of KoH and was less than pleased. It was obvious the picture had been butchered. I cared not one iota for any of the characters. Even the war scenes I could barely invest in. Now, though, the true picture has been released and boy is it a revelation. The director's cut of Kingdom of Heaven is one of the best movies you'll ever see. It might even be better than Braveheart, a movie that closely mirrors KoH. The director's cut would have been nominated for every award possible and I think most will agree after seeing this definitive version. Everyone who loves historical epics needs to own this movie. Do not ever see the theatrical print. This is the only version you will want to see.
B000001FS6|5.0|There are very few bands worldwide whose live performances can match those of U2 in their tours of the US in the late 80s. Thus U2's borrowing from these live performances for the making of 'Rattle and Hum' lends the album an energy and an electricity that is irresistible. <br /> <br />Some accuse this album of being pretentious, however it is an album that is difficult to resist being drawn into. Certain U2 songs such as 'Desire', 'Pride' and 'I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For' (here using full gospel choir), are at their zenith in a live performance, and these versions will be a delight to all U2 fans. <br /> <br />'Rattle and Hum' is where U2 made their strongest connection to American music. From the more slow ambling sounds of 'Love Rescue Me' to the American rock stylings of 'Bullet the Blue Sky', to the Blues/Soul sound of 'When Love Comes to Town', the American influence is everywhere. Indeed the duet with B.B. King on 'When Love Comes to Town' is mind-blowing and is possibly the highlight of the album. <br /> <br />What I would say to those who have not heard 'Rattle and Hum' is; ignore the accusations of pretention on this album and simply come and enjoy a top quality album from on of the best bands ever.
B00000DHRX|5.0|This is a very high quality collection of songs by one of our finest Pop craftsmen. <br /> <br />His solo career almost, ALMOST redeems him for Wham and those short shorts in the Wake Me Up Before You Go Go video. No matter what you think of NSync and New Kids On The Block, at least they looked COOL doing it. <br /> <br />A lot of the songs on The Best can't be found on album releases, including Too Funky and Killer etc etc. <br /> <br />One beef I have is George putting the alternate version of I Want Your Sex on the album. Nobody wants that one, we want the radio version. Now I have to buy Faith just to get that one, which is nothing but double-dipping. <br /> <br />The Best of George Michael is a very entertaining career encompassing set. And the tracks are smartly separated into a slow-song album (for the heart) and a fast-song album (for the feet). Some of the slow songs like One More Try and Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me give me chills. And some of the fast ones like Faith are legendary. <br /> <br />If you're just getting into G. Michael, this collection is all you need (unless you find it necessary to get the hit version of I Want Your Sex).
0783117523|5.0|Tragic true stories can only be told with the inclusion of the suffering that leads to an inevitable sad end. So, not long into the movie, you begin to feel a variety of painful emotions along with Gia (Jolie, whose performance is spectacular). Even though Gia is not a 'happily ever after' film, it is an important one. It is also very well-written, directed, edited and acted. I was glued to my television, even though I wished that I could somehow turn things around for Gia. The bitterness in that feeling came from the fact that it is impossible to change events that have already come to pass. I watched the unforgettable film once and I'm glad I did. The performances and storytelling were excellent. But I truly hurt for Gia, a real woman who suffered a great deal. So I didn't watch it again. But the movie is a successful portrayal of Gia's life and a powerful film definitely worth watching.
038533348X|5.0|Cat's Cradle <br />Kurt Vonnegut <br />ISBN#: 038533348X <br />304 pages <br />Publisher: Dial Press Trade Paperback <br /> <br /> Cat's Cradle offers a pessimistic outlook on human society, religion, and politics, but does it in such an ironic, lighthearted yet dark way that the reader won't be able to put it down. The protagonist John, who is only referenced by name once in the story, attempts to learn from the children of the fictional scientist Doctor Felix Hoenikker about the day the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. It is revealed that the late Dr. Hoenikker, who was one of the top minds behind the bomb, created another weapon before his death. This substance, known as Ice-9, is a form of ice that freezes at room temperature. If it comes in contact with water it will force its molecular pattern on it, and freeze it into the diamond-like Ice-9 as well. The only known samples of it were given to Dr. Hoenikker's three children, Newt, Angela and Frank. Through a seemingly random series of events they eventually encounter each other on the poverty stricken island of San Lorenzo; ruled by a merciless dictator where everyone belongs to an illegal religion known as Bokononism. <br />These beliefs are central to the novel. A man named Bokonon sought to create an escape for the miserable people of San Lorenzo, and so he constructed a religion of \\"foma\\" or lies, which he himself calls lies at every turn. Ironically it seems to make perfect sense. These lessons, which are often in the form of short poetry or Confucius-like statements, are interspersed among the chapters of the novel by John, the narrator, who has realized he too is a Bokononist. <br />Cat's Cradle's deceptively simple writing style masks the deeper messages it offers including lessons on love, pain and human nature. These seemingly innocuous sentences blend together to create both a compelling story, and a valid view of both events in the past and those likely in the future of humanity. In short, thisnovel is an enjoyable read brilliantly choreographed by one of the greatest American authors of our time.
B00000IQCA|1.0|Ok the title of my review may seem odd, but if you ever see this movie you will understand.  I tried as a test of wills to watch this movie from beginning to end on at least 3 occassions and I found my self at some point or another contemplating the universe and life in general. I would then snap back to the real world and realize i had missed some half hour or so of the film. So if you are in need of sleep or want to contemplate the sound of one hand clapping this movie is for you
B000EHRVP6|1.0|This movie got so much hype behind Tarantino as producer, and reviews as the scariest movie ever [the 10000 film to claim this], that it is a wonder it did not get an Oscar. <br /> <br />The film is overambitious, and unlike Roths' simple Cabin Fever. A 2nd time director, he benefited from increased budgeting.  The plot is described elsewhere, but basically people are kidnapped in East Europe, and tortured for entertainment.  Sexy vixens lured them with sex, and they are then kidnapped.  The 'vixens' are the most interesting perhaps, as most of the tourists are too bland to register. <br /> <br />A must miss.
B00005JOVH|5.0|You wouldn't miss that Bryan Singer is gone, maybe even a good move, as X3 is 3 times what X2 was, with Brett Ratner (Red Draqon) amping up the action, character arcs (many of which come to a surprising end, quite literally) and just pounding action sequence after action sequence onto the big screen, which is exactly where X3 should be seen, in all its widescreen glory. Explaining any second of this movie would just spoil the surprises in store and tear-jerkers, of which there are many, like the number of mutants on display, including Beast and the New, and deeply unsettling, Dr. Jean Grey, now the dark Phoenix, who will blow you away... and everything else she comes in contact with. X3 is where the summer blockbusters begin. Finally we have something worth getting in queue for again. What are you waiting for? Leave your home this weekend and GO!
B000F0UV0E|5.0|I'm no critic and, frankly, I just don't know that much about either artist.  This CD, however, has become my favorite album this year.  I work with music every day and of the 2006 releases, this is the only one that demands my attention everytime it plays.  Each song is enjoyable, the arrangements are terrific, and the voices of Mark and Emmy Lou blend exquisitely to make the best \\"country duets\\" album in my memory. <br /> <br />I've grown to love each song, but the haunting \\"If This is Goodbye\\" is a stand-out.  I can hear the guitar weeping. <br /> <br />I'd wish for another collaboration from these two - very soon!
B00000I07P|4.0|I won't say Bon Jovi was the best metal band around at the time, but, Jon was probably the best looking lead singer at the time.  The songs were very commercial and sold well, but not for pure metal heads.  Enjoy!
0385335989|5.0|Sometimes I wonder what book the \\"reviewers\\" here actually read. Complaints of changing diapers (one line at the end of the book) or that the series takes a turn and deals mostly with Brianna and Roger (First 500 pages is 90% in the past). What you`ve read 400 pages of this novel and feel you need to share? Save it. If you pick up the book open to the last page and see the number up top is 1070 and complain that it`s \\"wordy\\", you`re an idiot. While the first three books had a new peril every 25 pages, this tome includes the same great writing and is at a slower pace, but the banter between Jamie and Clarie is still satisfying. Claire and Jamie have this wonderful insite and a sense of mirth about their daily lives now in the New World. Brianna finally meeting James? I read that page three times. Lord John Grey is a fantastic character and comes alive on two special occasions (...to all that put major spoilers in your reviews without warning may you die twice). If your a fan of the series the Fiery Cross awaits and I for one can`t wait to start it. There is no silly Mr.Willouby or Rev. Jack the Ripper revelations only and great style of writing with deep characters and engrossing dialoge that will have you fall in love with the entire family.
B000EULJLU|5.0|I really got into this when my friend told me how awsome it was and he showed me a couple tracks. I then went out and bought it and it is just brilliant. Before this the only real exposure to Tool I had had was when someone showed me the Schism video, and that was great, but a bit much for someone who wasn't expecting this. All I can say is that this is the best Metal album of the year.
B000BVD460|3.0|My nephew is really into Eminem, so I checked it out and liked it.  He's very creative, but I've been getting some conscious hip-hop to my nephew from artists like Dead Prez, Paris and Blackalicious. <br />On top of that, I've just come upon the incredible hip-hop of Latin America.  You don't need to speak Spanish to recognize the power of the work being done by Colombia's \\"Zona Marginal,\\" Argentina's \\"Actitud Maria Marta,\\" Mexico's \\"Boca Floja\\" & \\"Akil Ammar.\\"  Hiphoprevolucion dot org is one very useful site to find this underground material, as is the site of the Nomad Sound System. <br />And for those lovers of peace, Paris' \\"Sonic Jihad\\" features an incredible anti-war song called, \\"AWOL.\\" <br />Guerrilla Funk dot com.
B000000OQF|5.0|There's so much I can say about this album.  I got Appetite for Destruction when I was eight years old (on tape), and have been listening to this album for the past 17 years and have yet to get sick of it.  The songs just never grow old.  Granted, the album has songs that are now considered Classic Rock, and are played out in the mainstream...but for me, it's one of those albums, seems every time I put it on, that it never fails to take me back.  It makes you remember when rock bands were really rock bands, not like these bands today who are so fashion conscious and look like they walked of the pages some college's marketing brochure.  All those people who say GN'R was crap and untalented musicians... If you're happy listening to that Emo stuff, that's fine.  But if you're going to listen to that stuff around me, make sure you bring a bag so I have something to vomit in.  Think what you will of Axl, how the band fell apart towards the end, and the \\"new\\" GN'R now, but these guys (Axl, Slash, Duff, Izzy, and Steve) knew what they were doing.  This is how GN'R will be remembered.
B000EMGAOY|2.0|It's nice to see the Peppers maintaining their popularity 20 years after their start.  Few bands these days have that kind of longevity.  That said, it's time to admit, once and for all, that this new material is far inferior to their output from 1987-1991.  Go back and listen to Taste the Pain.  Knock Me Down.  Subway to Venus.  Good Time Boys.  The Greeting Song.  Apache Rose Peacock.  Suck My Kiss.  Funky Crime.  Backwoods.  Me and My Friends.  There is just no comparison.  That stuff had swagger, attitude, B*LLS!!  It steamrolled you with funky, booty-slammin' groove.<br /><br />Listening to the stuff off Arcadium is so tepid by comparison it's not even funny.  The songs just aren't that compelling.  I cringe when I listen to them.  The melodies, rhythms, lyrics are all pedestrian.  They lack everything the band built its former reputation on.  They may have gotten more popular by softening their sound, but they can't reasonably be described as \\"red hot\\" these days.  Maybe the Lukewarm Chili Peppers is more appropriate.
0440418569|5.0|I will not review the book here blow by blow.  I started the series with The Golden Compass on recommendation by a friend.  I found the first book to be ok.  I finished it only because it was reviewed so highly.  I read the second book which was better than the first, but not a knockout.  The last book was the best written of the three.  It is a triology full of mythic themes.  Some of the subplots and themes in the trilogy don't quite make total sense, but a yarn is a yarn.   <br /> <br />This is an intricate and dark coming of age story for two innocents, a boy and a girl, both gifted in their intuitive skills.  They each seek and attain a talisman with power.  Their wanderings take them through a wasteland where death, twisted spirits and experimental theology reign.  They meet allies and enemies and literally go underground in their search for wholeness.  They emerge from the Valley of Death wiser, discover love, and bring vitality back to the planet.  They literally fall in love in another garden/forest setting.  Rather than discovering their separateness in the original Fall, they come together and realize how much they love each other and merge as an emotional unit, complete each other.  They meet their wounded kings and witch queens in their search for  holy items and questing answers.  Whom does the Grail serve?  Whom does the knife serve?  Will and Lyra realize their destinies.  Human consciousness, love, and one's universe. <br /> <br />Pullman probably tried to cram way to much into his novels which are definitely not young adult reading matter.  His ideas are too complicated for a grade school reader and likely a middle schooler.  They are very thought provoking nevertheless.  Taken in the backdrop of mythic themes..it was engaging and entertaining.  Read it with a grain of Dust.
B000001ESP|5.0|This is the album that recently, but not so long ago, introduced me to RUSH. I have to say I'm definately not going to end with this one alone, although infering from the reviews here on Amazon.com, this is probably the most accomplished and accesible one. However, I will certainly give \\"2112\\" a shot soon, too. <br /> <br />Well, I must agree, this album is a very good one indeed. <br />Elaborate songwriting and musical virtuosity is the Canadian trio's hallmark here, and they carry out brillianlty what they set out for. In fact, this is how progressive rock should sound like. It's a lot different from, let's say Alan Parson's Project, but there is one thing beyond doubt: this is prog-rock at the very best.  <br />I got into Rush because I heard \\"Tom Sawyer\\" on one of the widely availible rock-compilations, and I thought it would be good to buy the entire album of this well-introduced to me band. <br />I must claim that although \\"Tom Sawyer\\" is probably still the best song here, the entire album stands up very well too, and it clearly desrves a 5-star-rate. <br /> <br />Songs are complex, well-crafted, elaborate, lyrics not shallow, not cliched. \\"My uncle has a coutry farm where it used to be motoryard\\"... This is how \\"Red Barchetta\\" begins, yeah !! <br />Such stuff don't get into oblivion easily. <br />In fact, the lyrics are very good and sometimes you end up thinkng why \\"everybody must deviate from the norm\\" and then  you look around... <br />You don't get bored and crave for more. However, what makes the album very listenable and accessible to a wider audience, is the choruses: almost pop-like, very tuneful, catchy and melodic, especially in \\"Limelight\\" and \\"Vital signs\\". Once you've heard them, you will hum them many times. Epics like \\"Red Barchetta\\" and \\"Camera eye\\" are great, whereas <br />the instrumental \\"YYZ\\" is one of the finest moments on this album and one of the best purely-insturmental tracks I've ever heard, perhaps along with Scorpion's \\"Coast to coast\\". <br />\\"Tom sawyer\\" is definately the marvellous, incredible highlight of this album, which is worth having it just for this one track. <br />The pacing of the song, the tempo and chorus is perfect. <br />Oh, I would forget, I didn't like the \\"Witch hunt\\"... <br /> <br />Pure pleasure in listening to this precisely well-crafted album. I recommend it to everyone who likes music,loves discovering new stuff and is open enough for progressive, not cliched rock. I'm looking forward to buy \\"2112\\".
0553212540|5.0|This book is one of my favorites.  I love The Picture of Dorian Gray, and also was amazed by \\"The Ballad of Reading Gaul\\"
B000002LGW|5.0|Depeche Mode are the masters of synthesizers and electric music, no doubt about that. But in fact, they are much more than that and this live album proves it to the world. Songs are skillfully played and the load of emotion is very high; Dave Gahan sings really well and keeps the party at the boiling point all the time. I have never seen DM live; a week ago I saw my favourites Bon Jovi on a concert in Germany, and they were great, but I can imagine DM is also one of the top-bands to perform live on stage. They were in Poland last year and the tickets were impossible to get; the next time I will definately try to get some. Though I'm definately not a die-hard fan, I have much regard for their music. Yes, some of the very early albums sound like a cheap OMD, and are rather hilarious without much merit but overall DM is really a great band. Especially their 1985-on records prove how good they can be.  <br />This CD is the Depeche Mode at their peak - buy, listen and fall in love with it !    <br /> <br /> <br />This one is - for casual fans like me - the best option to choose as it encapsulates pretty well the entire first half of their carrer. All the greatest hits that appeared also on the compilation Singles 81-85 are here, and some more as well, so if you just want to get the \\"cream de la cream\\" of this band of the pre-\\"Violator\\" and pre-\\"Songs of faith and devotion\\" decade, your'e just in the right place. My favourites here are non-singles \\"Nothing\\" and \\"Sacred\\"; I almost fell in love with these ones and can't stop humming them, but I don't know from which albums they come. The band does here some improvisation as well; everything makes out a great show. Of course, standard classics like \\"Never let me down again\\" and beautifully performed, acoustic \\"Somebody\\" is the class for itself.   <br /> <br />Generally, a brilliant \\"live\\" performance. 5 stars no doubt, as it has also the greatest hits at one shot. For not-die-hard-fans, you need to have this album, plus \\"Violator\\" and \\"Songs of faith and devotion\\" to get a fairly good outlook on their great career. I have to claim this is one of the BEST \\"live\\" performances availible on the market these days. DM rulez !!
0446691437|5.0|I bought this book on a whim after hearing someone quote Steven Pressfield from this book and I am really glad I bought it.   Coincidentally, the night before I heard the quote, my husband shared with me that his most favorite book ever is 'The Gates of Fire' by Steven Pressfield.  So, I guess I shouldn't say it was a whim... it was more like I was heeding the call of one those messages trying to make it's way to me.  And, boy, did this book have some significant messages to hear. <br /> <br />It's not often that I find a book anymore that doesn't say the same ol' thing.  So for me to even remotely give a great review is saying a lot in itself. <br /> <br />My only 'complaint' is I wish Steven Pressfield would have chosen a different subtitle.  This little gem of a book reaches far beyond the scope of breaking though creative blocks and a lot of people may pass it up and miss out on some of his profound messages by thinking that it's only for writers and artists.  It really is for anyone who is pursuing a dream that may be wondering why they're not there yet.
B000002JKS|3.0|Even though its probably not his best album,its definitely a staple in his career.It really is a must-have for true fans,and just like all of his works,it may take a little getting used to but in the end its sure to please.
B00005JOVH|4.0|After having seen the midnight showing in my town, and having mulled over in my mind what I thought about the film, I have this to say one simple statement.  I liked it. <br /> <br />Yes, many purist fans will shirk at the lack of depth in some of the new characters introduced; however, all in all the film did what so many films fail to do these days, entertain throughout. <br /> <br />Just to give a little initial background plot, as you probably know by now a lot of the focus is on Jean and the Phoenix.  Well, actually a ton of the movie focuses on this, and not giving anything away, but basically all the climactic events deal with Jean/The Phoenix.  Intriguingly enough though, she's given a very small role at least as far as speaking goes. <br /> <br />Instead, Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and Storm (Halle Berry) take the lead roles, as they advance their characters slightly in depth, but heavily in status.  Don't worry though if if you want and expected fresh faces, because the filmmakers also leave plenty of time for looking at, but not learning about, the newcomers.  Also to mention, the youngest X-Men Rogue, Bobby (Iceman), and Kitty have somewhat of a sub-plot love triangle. <br /> <br />Back to the plot though, because all those characters center on the story that a supposed-cure has been released for mutant hood.  This is obviously a very divisive issue, as it widens Magneto and Xavier separation even more, while threatening the already fragile make-up of the X-men themselves. <br /> <br />As I mentioned, the movie did have some flaws, as it seemed to want to provide too much in too short a time, while having to glaze over any kind of legitimate character development, (except for some for the Phoenix).  Still, if you were a fan of the old ones, or just like good, entertaining superhero-type films, then you're sure to like X3.
B000EULJLU|3.0|Frankly, I expected better from this album. <br /> <br />I don't buy that one should have to listen to an album multiple times to let it \\"grow on you.\\"  If it takes more than two listens, it probably isn't that good, and the listener is likely simply trying to convince him- or herself that it is good because he or she does not want to admit to wasting 18 bucks on mediocrity.  So, let me give it to you straight up: This album is too often boring.  With few exceptions, these songs sound like Lateralus on downers; several of the songs could have (and should have) been cut way down--you know, to just the interesting parts (I am speaking in particular of the title track and \\"Intension\\"), and the final song, \\"Viginti Tres,\\" isn't even music, just slow-motion sound effects--and not especially interesting ones like those found in the much better album Aenima (\\"Die Eier von Satan\\" comes to mind).  \\"Lipan Conjuring\\" is boring and should have been scrapped; adding some neato sound effects to a Native American chant does not make it sound more \\"metal.\\"  \\"Rosetta Stoned\\" and \\"Jambi\\" are the only songs that stand out as significantly different from what Tool has already produced for earlier albums.  That being said, let me express why I am giving the album three stars instead of one (I'd give it three and a half if I could): <br /> <br />1. The artwork is some of the most interesting that I have seen on any album.  Alex Grey is no mediocre artist.  His images are complex and multifaceted, and I especially enjoy the fact that they can be viewed here in three dimensions.  Thumbs up on the artwork. <br /> <br />2. The first two songs, \\"Vicarious\\" and \\"Jambi,\\" are quite good, as is \\"Rosetta Stoned.\\" <br /> <br />3. Okay, \\"The Pot\\" is also pretty good. <br /> <br />4. \\"Right in Two\\" has some interesting percussive elements. <br /> <br />5. \\"Lost Keys\\" is an interesting interlude. <br />
B000002BYD|5.0|I guess every artist or group that puts out enough records will have an album like Yield, that is a great group of songs and performances that do not get the credit they deserve as time moves on. It is probably because by the time Yield came out people had just grown to expect greatness from this Seattle outfit and another great Pearl Jam record wasn't anything new.<br /><br />As time has gone on, Pearl Jam's first three records of energetic, angry hard rock have been lauded time and time again as the band's high point, while that maybe true commercially, in my opinion the band has never put out a better album from beginning to end then Yield. (And right now I absolutely love their new self-titled record.)<br /><br />Starting off with the energy of Brain of J all the way to the calm laments of All Those Yesterdays, this is the sound of the band getting off their crazy trip through the early 90's and making their peace with what they had become and where they were going. This is due to an almost calm precision throughout the record, the album sounds polished and together with even experiments like Push Me, Pull Me seeming not odd, but just what Pearl Jam does (see Bugs).<br /><br />Nowhere does the sense of a door closing appear more then on the third song No Way. Starting off with a slow guitar grind leading to a chorus of \\"I'll stop trying to make a difference/ I'm not trying to make a difference,\\" the song acts as a clear admission that their earlier days of challenging every known industry norm (Ticketmaster, not doing videos) were no longer as big an issue, but the ending \\"no way\\" was also the band saying \\"we're not done being a total pain either.\\"<br /><br />Lowlight meanwhile offers a glimpse of the direction the band was going. A beautiful, melodic ballad that isn't layered with a sense of sadness (unlike earlier slow songs such as Elderly Woman Behind The Counter In A Small Town), this song shows a band removing layers off anger and reveals a peaceful sound and style. As if the song is putting to bed all the previous challenges the group had, it's also the highlight of the record (and of their career, recently they played this song at a concert I attended in 2006 and it received a huge reaction.)<br /><br />This record confirmed that Pearl Jam weren't going anywhere (a rarity for their style of music) and would keep being creative and daring, but were done being angry young men 24/7 (which has burned out many a band's sound and careers). On Wishlist, another calm melodic beauty anchored by the simplest of riffs Eddie Vedder summarizes this mood perfectly with \\"I wish I were a messenger and all the news was good.\\" For this band and that time, this type of statement was something new, whether anyone noticed or remembers is another issue.ul sound and style.

B0002XNT0I|5.0|I purchase a lot of DVDs.  For the past few years, it seems that almost every DVD comes in a special edition two-disc release that includes deleted scenes, documentaries, cast bios, trailers, teaser trailers, music videos, and the director's recipe for three-alarm chili.  I usually don't have time to get beyond the first disc, and much of what I do get around to usually turns out to be as boring as it gets.  This time, however, I am happy to report that the two-disc anniversary release of Philadelphia is worth both the money and the time invested in it, even if you already have Philadelphia on DVD.<br /><br />The special features include the 84-minute documentary, One Foot On A Banana Peel and the Other In the Grave, an extraordinary piece of amateur filmmaking by an AIDS patient named Juan Botas.  What I did not know was that Mr. Botas' AIDS diagnosis provided the inspiration for director Jonathan Demme to make Philadelphia in the first place, as Mr. Botas was best friends with Mr. Demme's wife.  In the meanwhile, Mr. Botas mentioned to filmmaker Demme that it was a shame that the black humor, amazing courage and other interesting dialogue that emanated from his fellow patients at the clinic where he was being treated was being lost forever as it left their lips.  Mr. Demme gave Mr. Botas his hand-held camera, and the results so impressed Demme that he wound up releasing the documentary through his own production company.  The finished film is touching, oddly comic, tragic and as effecting as any piece of drama you've ever witnessed.  One of the patients from the doctor's office was also given a few lines in the main feature, Philadelphia.<br /><br />Which brings us to that film.  At the time of its release, Philadelphia received some very harsh criticism from the AIDS community for its perceived flaws; it was judged by many as \\"too Hollywood\\" to be realistically representative of the HIV / AIDS experience.  To their credit, in the background documentary included here, \\"People Like Us\\" (which was the original working title of Philadelphia) the creative team behind Philadelphia (including Jonathan Demme, Tom Hanks and the screenwriter Ron Nyswaner) meet this criticism head on, presenting a defense of their work that is both credible and illuminating.  Many complained that Philadelphia was void of any tenderness or physical contact between the male couple (Hanks and Bandaras) but this is not only redressed by a closer look at their scenes together, an extremely intimate scene between the lovers in bed (which was excised from the final cut) was deleted not for its controversy but because the scene simply didn't work (having now seen it, I can attest to this fact).  I have long seen this movie as not a film about AIDS per se, but as a film about homophobia.  Indeed, the main thrust of the plot (besides the trial) is the transformation of the character of Joe Miller from committed homophobe to a more enlightened and tolerant person.  One of my favorite scenes (which it turns out many people wanted to delete from the final cut) deals subtly with Millers transformation - the \\"opera scene\\".<br /><br />In that scene, Miller is asked by the character or Andy what he thinks about gay people.  The attorney responds that, when straight people think of them at all, most straight people pretty much see all gay people as some sort of sub-human predatory monsters, out to ensnare the children of the world into a twisted sick life, and destroy all that straight people hold dear.  Andy abruptly changes the subject, \\"Do you like opera, Joe?\\" he asks.  Caught by surprise, Joe admits he does not know anything about it  - and Andy Beckett - this sub-human destroyer of children, responds by tenderly and passionately explaining his deep love for beautiful music by allowing Joe to see just a small piece of exactly why so many gay men love opera.  He plays the aria La Mama Morte, carefully, passionately and articulately explaining the story and the beauty behind the words and music.  Joe is immediately transformed - it's clear that he is deeply moved.  By playing the piece, La Mama Morte through again in its entirety, the screenwriter and director shows us that the music has stayed with Joe long after he's left Andy's home.  We see him leave Andy's apartment and go home in a sort of daze, kiss his sleeping baby and slip into bed with his slumbering wife, while the beauty of the music haunts and caresses him, like a gorgeous gay lullaby.  Some of my gay friends were among those who didn't get this scene - they saw it only as a stereotypical depiction of a gay man's love for opera.  I got it right away - by exposing Joe to a thing of beauty he'd never experienced before, Andy had suddenly allowed Joe to consider that gay men were not only something more than what he thought, he demonstrated that we are capable of enormous passion and the ability to appreciate delicate beauty.  This scene, more than any other, allowed Andrew Beckett to be transformed from a predatory sub-human freak into a human being, not only for Joe Miller, but for many in the straight audience.  It has remained one of my favorite scenes in a movie ever, and a small part of what makes Philadelphia such a powerful experience.<br /><br />Highly recommended.the beauty behind the words and music.

I got it right away - by exposing Joe to a thing of beauty he'd never experienced before, Andy had suddenly allowed Joe to consider that gay men were not only something more than what he thought, he demonstrated that we are capable of enormous passion and the ability to appreciate delicate beauty.  This scene, more than any other, allowed Andrew Beckett to be transformed from a predatory sub-human freak into a human being, not only for Joe Miller, but for many in the straight audience.  It has remained one of my favorite scenes in a movie ever, and a small part of what makes Philadelphia such a powerful experience.   <br /> <br />Highly recommended.                            <br />
B000FQJAIW|1.0|!!!READ BEFORE PURCHASING / WASTING YOUR MONEY!!! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Should we just consume everything Star Wars related without thought or question, nor any basis for quality or standards? <br /> <br /> <br />It's quite clear a this point, that the people behind these new releases, are doing their best to make them as unappealing as possible.  <br /> <br />The attitude behind this marketing ploy is of complete disrespect... <br /> <br /> <br />1) They are not putting any effort into the quality of the product. <br /> <br /> <br />2) They are not even going to offer the basics of home video standard that the world has come to expect in 2006 with 16x9 enhanced (read: anamorphic) transfers. <br /> <br /> <br />3) Instead they intend to source the video from outdated laserdisc transfers from the mid-90's, which is completely unacceptable. Why not just port over the full-screen VHS image while you're saving time, money, etc? <br /> <br /> <br />4) Nevermind the fact that they couldn't even see fit to put the individual DVD's in a simple slip box and package the 'trilogy' as it should respectfully be offered, and as any other movie franchise collection would be in 2006... But they've even refused to offer covers that look like a minimal ammount of time was spent to design and promote these inferior discs. Despite the terrible cheap looking photoshopped covers, the aesthetics aren't that significant overall - but it's yet another strike against any thought, care or quality control being devoted to this 'throw-away' release. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />So we are simply expected to purchase these DVD's because they are apparently \\"Limited Editions\\" (perhaps they want these pulled from the market as quickly as possible before anyone has time to realize and publicize on how crappy and insignificant a waste they are?) and because George Lucas and company recognize how much money they can squeeze out of consumers with anything SW related. <br /> <br />Not so. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br />************************************************************************************************************* <br /> <br />Buying these discs would be the equivalent of watching non-remastered, non-anamorphic, poor quality laserdiscs that were issued 13 years ago! <br /> <br />************************************************************************************************************* <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />So should we all simply run out and support this product by putting money in the pockets of George Lucas and the producers who so outwardly don't care about this at all? <br /> <br />  <br />NO!!! <br /> <br /> <br />I will continue to support quality products, releases, efforts, etc.  <br /> <br />Anything else is not worth my time or hard-earned money - Regardless of who or what is behind the sale! <br /> <br /> <br />The content is not the issue here - The presentation is!
B000B2YQX4|5.0|After all these years, Depeche Mode prove that they've still got it.  Easily the best 80's techno band ever.  This album is completely solid from start to finish, and \\"Precious\\" is one of their best songs to date.  \\"Playing the Angel\\" is sure to bring in new fans, as well as please the old ones.  Trust me, you can't go wrong.
B000EHSVQE|5.0|This movie is a CLASSIC. IT is so funny, and is the most oringinal movie I've ever seen. Maybe all of you forty year olds don't like this movie because 'it doesn't have a plot' GET OVER IT! That's why it's sooo funny and original. You have to see it if you already haven't! There aree hilarious quotes and scenes.
B000E1155E|4.0|With all the press these guys have gotten here in the US, I was expecting the second coming of the Beatles when I first popped the CD in my computer.  I was a bit dissapointed, to say the least.  This is still a pretty solid album, however, and definitely better than 95% of the \\"indie\\" schlock that's made it in on to the airwaves in the States.   <br /> <br />Overall, the songs are pretty catchy and the lyrics are witty.  A solid rock and roll CD, but it's no Led Zeppelin II or Exile on Main Street.
0783230079|5.0|In the history of film there are a masterpieces made almost every year.  These films are judged by the intellect as well as societal reactions to them, and finally how they measure to the achievements that went before them.<br /><br />BUT...<br /><br />What is much more rare, are the films that successfully and creatively focus on the issues of the heart.  Films that are able touch the beauty and innocence of the human condition- reminding us not what is wrong with the world, but what redemption can do for the world.  Films that do not manipulate the emotions of the viewer, but have the grace to warm our hearts.<br /><br />Heart And Souls is one of those special films that takes a tender and joyous look at redemption and true humanity, but with a humorous approach.  Robert Downey Jr., Kyra Sedgwick, Charles Grodin, Alfre Woodard, and Tom Sizemore all give wonderful performances.  The film is poetic, humorous, and touching all at the same time.  I think it's the type of film that can fit any mood regardless of if you want to be moved or just laugh and have fun.  When you get down to it, Heart And Souls is just wonderful entertainment.
B000FQJAIW|5.0|It looks like George Lucas listened to all the feedback that fans gave him about releasing the special editions and not the originals, and yet everyone seems more ticked off now.  It isn't George Lucas who is milking the fans out of more money.  How ridiculous.  Does George Lucas MAKE fans buy unwanted editions?  No: the fans will take what they can get, even if it isn't what they want.   <br /> <br />The fans could have protested the release of the special edition DVD's by refusing to buy them. Case Closed. I'm sure most of the complainers out there bought the special editions, since their reviews note that they feel like they are being ripped off now.  I agree that studios today do try to milk fans out of money by re-releasing special editions and the like.  It is sleazy, and I can't stand it either.  This may or may not be the case with these star wars re-releases, but to me, it doesn't matter either way.  Your opinion doesn't matter.  Your angry reviews don't matter.  What you paid money for is what matters to the producers of these DVD's.  In their eyes, what you buy counts as your opinion.   <br /> <br />So if you are angry about being ripped off because of this re-release, write an angry letter and mail it to yourself.  Next time a DVD comes out that isn't up to par, don't buy it; simple as that.  Stop acting like mindless consumers, put your money where your mouth is, and spare everyone your hypocritical comments (yes, it is hypocritical to trash a dvd and buy it anyways).  <br /> <br />I realize that my comments might come across as harsh, but I mean no disrespect to you all.  I understand how much the fans love star wars and how mad everyone must have been when they released only the special edition DVD's.  If only they had released this edition originally, everyone would have been very happy.  But if you love star wars so much that you felt like you had to buy the special editions because they were on DVD; let me point out that you do have a choice.  Don't speak as if you were forced to buy both.  Again, if Lucas did this on purpose, shame on him.  And if Lucas is listening to the fans, good for him!  I don't think it matters much either way.
B00005JOVH|4.0|We watched the first \\"X-Men\\" film in the afternoon, \\"X-Men United\\" last night, and then went to the midnight showing for \\"X-Men: The Last Stand,\\" where there was some serious cinematic discussions going on touching on everything from Rosebud in \\"Citizen Kane\\" to \\"Platoon.\\"  But once they showed the trailer for \\"Superman Returns\\" the crowd immediately got back into the appropriate literary frame of reference for the proceedings.<br /><br />For those expecting to see the Phoenix saga from the \\"X-Men\\" comic books played out it is quickly made clear that is not going to happen.  We begin two decades ago, when Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Eric Lensherr (Ian McKellen) visit the home of young Jean Grey, where we learn this little girl is the only Level 5 mutant on the planet (No, the idea of levels is not explored further, but my best guess would be that Professor X, Magneto, Storm and Callisto are Level 4s, and no clue about the rest, although I would think Wolverine is just an upgraded 2 because his healing powers are natural but the claws are not).  Phoenix is now the unconscious side of the powers of Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), and after years of being controlled by Xavier's mental blocks, the beast is out.  That is something Logan (Hugh Jackman) can relate to, but he does not like the idea that the professor has been messing with the mind of the woman he loves.<br /><br />The other element from the past prologue is young Warren Worthington III, trying to hide from his father that he is starting to have wings grow out of his back.  Father and son are ashamed, but what matters is that daddy (Michael Murphy) has enough money to do something about it.  Then we pick up the narrative in the not too distant future where relationships between humans and mutants has apparently improved to the point that Dr. Hank McCoy (Kelsey Grammer) is Secretary of Mutant Affairs in the cabinet of the president (Josef Sommer).  Meanwhile, a distraught Scott Summers (James Marsden), hearing Jean's voice in his head goes back to Alkali Lake to exorcise his pain, only to find out what we all know: the woman he loves is not dead.  She is just different.  Big time.<br /><br />However, that is not the big problem, because Worthington announces that he has found a mutant, Leech (Cameron Bright), who can \\"cure\\" mutants.  A magic formula has been created and if you do not want to be a mutant, your wish can come true.  But for Magneto, who still bears the number tattooed on his arm in a Nazi concentration camp knows full well, the government can always decide to cure mutants in the name of national self interest.  Besides, he does not think mutants need a cure, and he rallies an army to his banner to join him alongside Mystique (Rebecca Romijn) and Pyro (Aaron Stanford) (part of the fun is seeing who shows up).  Meanwhile, Storm (Halley Balle) has to take a bigger leadership role with the X-Men, where Rogue (Anna Paquin), who cannot touch another living soul because she can kill them absorbing their powers, is desperate enough  to take the cure.<br /><br />My primary cryptic complaints about the film are as follows.  First, we did not realize that the first X-Men to die in the film had actually died.  Only one of the deaths really had emotional resonance, mainly because I am a big \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" fan so it was really \\"been there, done that\\" for the final death.  But part of the problem is that we expect the dead to come back in these movies (Gandalf came back, Electra came back, hands up if you think we will see Dumbledore again).  Second, making Bobby Drake young enough for Iceman to be part of the next generation of X-Men with Rogue, Colossus and Shadowcat sets up an implied love triangle that rubs against the grain because the two things we know about Kitty is she walks through walls and loves Peter.  At least they did not cross the line in this film with that regard but they skate pretty close to it (literally).  Third, where wasthe Phoenix effect?  They set up the whole thing at the end of the second movie as we see the shape of the Phoenix beneath the waters of Alkali Lake and I waited for Jean Grey to go full-blown Phoenix, but she just stays on the cusp.<br /><br />However, there are more things I liked about the film.  The second scene at the home of Jean Grey is the most memorable in the movie, I liked the fact that the American military are better prepared for an assault by Magneto and his, and any scene in which Stewart and McKellen have a conversation makes you think they are still doing.  The script makes good use of Kitty and her powers (she has the single best fight movie in the film), and Wolverine and the Beast bickering is fun.  The key thing is that you have to go with the movie and not let your expectations be colored by the comic books you have read, because those will just prove to be false paths.  I was convinced that in the end Magneto was going to be leading the X-Men in an effort to stop Phoenix, and that Jean was going to regain control long enough to use the cure on herself, but all of that was from what I have read (and what Chris Claremont and John Bryne wanted to have be the original ending of the Dark Phoenix saga).  This could be the last X-Men movie simply because of the relatively high body count, but on the other hand the roster of merry mutants has been evolving to such a high degree since Claremont and Dave Cockrum brought them back with the international flair that you kill one of the X-Men and you have a half-dozen to take their place.d, where was the Phoenix effect?

B000053VAF|5.0|For a movie that features a rubber poop monster, Dogma received a whole lot of serious criticism for what was perceived by some (religious groups in particular) to be an attack on Christianity. It is, admittedly, taking some shots at the Catholic Church but the final message of the movie in no way diminishes Christianity.<br /><br />Enough for the serious stuff lets talk turkey... Dogma is a comedy from director Kevin Smith, the fourth of his \\"Jersey\\" stories, and everything just clicks perfectly together. Smith, and his favorite actors, have all matured nicely over the previous 3 films and, despite being cast in mostly different roles, are totally at ease with themselves and their respective roles; even Jason Mewes never seems to miss a beat in his reoccurring Smith part \\"Jay,\\" and the underrated Jason Lee is exquisite as the demon Azrael.<br /><br />Joining Smith's usual stable of friends and actors are some well know, and very talented, names such as Alan Rickman, Linda Fiorentino, Salma Hayek, Chris Rock, and Matt Damon (Damon and Affleck as the angles Loki and Bartleby have all the best lines). This great cast along with Smith's well balanced script keeps the film light, funny, and well thought-out when it could have easily turned into a stodgy, soap-box style dissertation on organized Religion.
B000EWBNMS|5.0|I am always hooked into watching each episode---the writers have successfully created believable characters with believable everyday life problems, which are also entertaining. When the focus shifts over to Alison's dreams they are only part of the plots that run throughout each episode.  Sometimes funny (the policeman in the casket comes to mind) sometimes just plain eerie, but still grounded with a healthy dose of human experience, I look forward to owning the whole series someday.
B00005JOVH|5.0|When it was announced that Brett Ratner would be directing X3, there was a massive outcry from the comic book nerds saying he would RUIN the X-Men franchise. Well, those nerds can eat their words now because Ratner's X-Men is so fantastic that it doesn't even compare to Singer's films. Singer did a pretty good job. But Ratner's film IS X-Men. He presents these characters the way they were always meant to be. What's great about this film? Story, acting, action, special effects, you name it. Ratner gets it done right. I actually teared up in a scene near the end. This movie is just perfect.<br /><br />I heard this will be the last X-Men film. That's a shame because this franchise is better than ever.
0307277674|5.0|Kudos to Dan Brown for popularizing a self-evidently correct notion about the marital status of Jesus rather than let it slip down the memory hole.  In the Book of Genesis, we are told that \\"a man shall leave the house of his father and mother and cleave to his wife and they shall become one flesh.\\"  We are also told that a man is to be \\"fruitful and multiply and fill the earth.\\"  These two commandments right out of the gate to get married and have kids has been incumbent on Jews since time immemorial and remains so today.  Any rabbi worth his salt wouldn't dare consider becoming a sexual deviant and social misfit by avoiding these 2 commandments.  Without clear and convincing evidence to the contrary--which does not exist--of course Jesus was married and had children.  Notice that this conclusion is obtained without resort to secret documents, a visit to France or an examination of any of Da Vinci's paintings.  Still, I have to hand it to Dan Brown.  He accomplished what the likes of Hugh Schonfield and Michael Baigent were unable to do with far more 'evidence' at their disposal: namely, exposing this pious fraud for what it has always been.<br /><br />And in a highly entertaining way, no less.
B000002J3W|4.0|listen to me...HAIR bands are poison, warrant, motley crue, cinderella etc.... skid row is one of the few good musical things to come from the 80's, and they dressed really no differently than metallica, is metallica a hair band? c'mon!!
B000EMGAOY|3.0|Let me begin by saying that \\"Dani California\\" is Tom Petty's \\"Mary Jane's Last Dance.\\" Listen to the two side by side and you see that the verses of each are EXACTLY the same - the same chord progressions, the same drum line, and even very similar lyrics (both are about a girl and make frequent references to states or cities). It's hard to say whether they ripped him off or not, but the evidence is definitely there - it can't be THAT BIG of a coincidence. You be the judge... <br /> <br />With that out of the way, it's still a good song on a good - not great - CD. Most of the album sounds kind of safe, but there are some real standouts here. The main problem with it is it's self indulgence - there are about 14 amazing songs on here that could make ONE perfect record, so why stretch it out over two with so many bland songs? Overall, the second disc is the better of the two as it sees the Peppers' experimenting a little more, and the first is chock full of potential singles. I would really give this cd a 3.5/5, but if they cut this down to one disc it could have been a landmark album in the history of rock. As it is, I still think it's a landmark record for the band itself, and is one of the better double albums since NIN's \\"The Fragile.\\" <br /> <br />Download these best songs off the album for a near flawless listen: <br /> <br />1.\\"Dani California\\" <br />2.\\"Charlie\\" <br />3.\\"Stadium Arcadium\\" <br />4.\\"She's Only 18\\" <br />5.\\"Especially In Michigan\\" <br />6.\\"Hey\\" <br />7.\\"Desecration Smile\\" <br />8.\\"She Looks to Me\\" <br />9.\\"Readymade\\" <br />10.\\"If\\" <br />11.\\"So Much I\\" <br />12.\\"Storm in a Teacup\\" <br />13.\\"Turn it Again\\" <br />14.\\"Death of a Martian\\"
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|O.k. for starters, unless you just woke up from under a rock or have been living in a cave for the past 15 years, this is Tool's lead singer's (Maynard) side project and this is their sophomore album. Unlike most sophomore albums, this album does not fall flat anywhere. And if it does, I couldn't find it because to me the album is just an artistic masterpiece. <br /> <br />The album is very similar to their first (\\"Mer de Noms\\") in the way it sounds. All of the songs are very melodic, smooth and almost trance inducing at times. I'm not sure what it is but there is something so beautiful and eloquent even real heavy bang your head off metal heads will enjoy this album. Honestly, I'm not even sure if you could classify this music as metal because it stands out so much on it's own that calling it anything other than great music would almost be an insult. <br /> <br />Thirteenth Step is a little slower than Mer de Noms, however it doesn't really matter because songs like \\"Weak and Powerless\\", \\"Pet\\" and \\"The Outsider\\" make up for that and then the deliciously melodic songs like \\"The Noose\\", \\"Vanishing\\" and \\"The Nurse Who Loved Me\\" show the amount of talent this band has. <br /> <br />Personally, I already think that Mer de Noms is an essential album to any metal fans collection but this one has to be as well because again, I almost can't explain it but whatever it is, this album is so beautifully written even my metal hating wife loves this album. Plus it's a big breath of fresh air to some of the other bands that are played on rock stations these days. So really let's convert all of the metal hating wives in the world by getting this album and turning it up as loud as possible! 5 stars no question!
B000FQJAIW|1.0|This is a rehash of the 2004 SE's (of which I will never buy because they have been bastardized from the original).  You can get it cheaper by buying the '04 SE box set rather than these separately.  But wait, as a bonus you get the unaltered original Star Wars.  Well true but you are getting it with inferior quality as they are not anamorphic releases.  STAY AWAY AT ALL COST FROM THIS RELEASE!!!!  Do not spend your hard earned money on inferior quality and if you prefer the SE, get the box set instead.
B000001GKC|5.0|Besides this recording, I also own Chailly, Celibidache (Munich), Jochum (Dresden) and Solti (CSO, nla).  The spirituality is much more intense than all the others. The acoustics of the Grosser Saal of Musikverein is superb (i.e. just resonant enough, not too reverberating).  The response from Wiener Philharmoniker is precise (you can hear pp,p,mf,f,ff), their playing natural and idiomatic.  The whole recording has been remastered with the so-called 'Original Bit Processing' and is very satisfying.  In short, it brings out the greatness of Bruckner's arguably best composition to its fullest extent.  Anyone who can afford this should acquire this.
B00005JOVH|4.0|In X1 there was the attempt by Magneto (played superbly by Ian McKellan) to convert humans to mutants. In X2 it was a plot by a corrupt Fed to kill all the mutants using Xavier (Patrick Stewart). In X3 a \\"cure\\" is found that makes all mutants human.<br /><br />Cure indeed. Who said the mutants were sick? Such  is the view of the mutant self proclaimed leader Magneto. Magneto fears that the \\"cure\\" will be forced upon the mutant population and wages war against the source of the cure with the aim to destroy it and anything that gets in his and his loyal followers way.<br /><br />The movie is suspenseful and exciting. No bathroom break urges in this one. New mutants are hatched and some of our favorite mutants are dispatched (quite early on in the movie). Special effects are 5-star.<br /><br />There is no need to see X1 or X2 in order to fully understand and be thoroughly entertained by X3. Hugh Jackman is back in the tough-guy roll as Wolverine (we like you better as a tough guy, Hugh); Halle Berry (Storm), Anna Paquin (Rogue), James Marsden (Cyclops) and Rebecca Romijn (Mystique) are all back too. And Famke Janssen is back as Phoenix as you've never seen her.<br /><br />Beast is in this one too actually played by (to my surprise in the rolling credits)...Kelsey Grammer! Now there's a real mutation!<br /><br />All in all a very entertaining hour and 45 minutes. X fans won't miss it. You shouldn't either if you're into the action genre.
B000ETQRCM|4.0|Pearl Jam are BACK with their new self-titled album. This is probably their hardest rockin' album since \\"Vitalogy.\\" This album comes out of the gates swinging, with the hard rocker \\"Life Wasted.\\" Next up is the single \\"World Wide Suicide\\", with great vocal work during the verses and an overall rocking vibe. By now you know the Pearl Jam of old is back, but here comes \\"Comatose,\\" the hardest song on the album. It's ridiculously good, with a nice little solo near the end. \\"Severed Hand\\" is next, which builds slowly into pretty hard rocker. In my opinion, this is the weakest song yet on the album, but it definitely sounds like vintage PJ. \\"Marker in the Sand\\" has an amazing chorus, probably the best one I've heard all year, and is one of my favorite songs on this record. \\"Parachutes\\" slows things down a bit for a good little acoustic track, leading into \\"Unemployable\\" which is probably the best track on the record. Another hard rocker comes i n the form of \\"Big Wave\\", then comes \\"Gone\\" which is an okay song. Next is \\"Army Reserve\\" - while not a bad song at all, it just seems to go nowhere and is the worst track on the record. It all ends with the 1-2 punch of \\"Come Back\\" and \\"Inside Job\\", a perfect way to end the record. <br /> <br />The first half of the CD is much better than the second, but overall it is still a great rock record and looks to be one of the better releases of the year. <br /> <br />Top 3 songs: <br />\\"Unemployable\\", \\"Marker in the Sand\\", \\"Life Wasted\\"
B0000844I8|5.0|Watching the movie, it's easy to see how this was turned into a TV series, had a spin-off series (Atlantis with another on the way) and a new movie now in the works. The film is very original, that's the best part of the entire thing. You have never seen or heard things that this film is showing and saying.<br /><br />The Stargate itself is a really cool thing to look; very good special effects are all over the movie. From the ships to the wardrobe, this film looks amazing. The story is also very compelling and very interesting. An alien, posed as their god Ra, kidnapping humans from Egypt way in the past and has made them slaves...what's cooler than that? The characters are also people you actually care about. Kurt Russell and Spader do an excellent job in the film. Overall, this film is another that to be seen to be believed. It really is hard to describe and has to be seen!
B000055ZDT|5.0|This is offically one of my new favorite records (right behind Boris' new album) From the opening Black Sabbath head nod, \\"Vinum Sabbathi\\" through the epic \\"Funeralopolis\\" and \\"I, The Witchfinder\\"  on to the amazing heady closer \\"Dopethrone\\" this is album is just full on sludge doom stoner metal. EEvery song is blanketed in a warm glow from mounds and mounds of distortion and feedback. The distortion practically consumes the drums and the vocals.... <br /> <br />Vocals lie somewhere near Ozzy Osbourne, (He actually sound very like Steve Austin from Today Is The Day) but with some effects and pushed way deeper in the mix. (which means you wont have to worry about picking out any cheesy lyrics) The one thing that I really like about this album is the fact that the drums arent completely swallowed by the guitars. Their older album Come My Fanatics, while also great, tends to bury the vocal and drums a little too much leading the songs to become almost formelss at times. But Dopethrone remedies that while still maintaining full bore with the guitars.  <br /> <br />The songs are long, hazy and thick. The drums lurch and the guitars hold deep ass power chords for more than a few seconds at a time, definitely threatening to blow your speakers. (NOTE: THIS ALBUM IS VERY CAPABLE OF DESTROYING YOUR HI-FI AUDIO EQUIPMENT - TEST IT OUT BEFORE YOU BLAST IT AND BLOW YOUR SPEAKERS OR AMPS) you will want to play this as loud as you can just for the sheer force of the guitar and bass rumble....have I aped on the thickness of this whole thing enough?  I could never do it justice. Imagine a version of Sunn 0))) that actually tried to rock out. That would be pretty close to the heaviness present on this disc. Though I love Boris, I definitely believe that the Wizard is far heavier. <br /> <br />My favorite track is \\"Funeralopolis\\". It starts with a heady instrumental jam, very bluesy with some hella deep bass. Then it rumbles in and the chords just envelope you. This is one of the fewsongs that picks up the pace slighty, but only after pummeling you with a three note guitar riff for about 4 minutes. By the end of the song they are galloping full steam and they even throw in what sounds like an echoplex. This makes the final few measures extremely spacy and frantic with the guitars and vocals swirling. A very nice acid drenched touch ala Comets on Fire. <br /> <br />Another fantastic track is \\"I, The Withcfinder\\" Easily the darkest track on the album and another opus of a song. I would have to say that all the tracks are extremely worthwhile, even the tiny jam \\"Hills Have Eyes\\" which leavens some of the overwhelming power that this band is capable of, only to drop you off on \\"We Hate You\\" and then the masterful closer \\"Dopethrone\\" <br /> <br />This music will definitely appeal to stoners who like their music loud. It will also appeal to fans of older metal and lunatics who are looking to have their bowels shaken by subsonic doom jams... <br />Something about the fuzzed out thick ass guitars just makes me happy. Especially when riding the subway and I know people can hear just a maelstrom of noise pouring into my head from my headphones....It just makes me smile. If they only knew...
B00005JOVH|4.0|This installment of X-Men doesn't quite live up to the second one, which is, indeed the best of the three. Angel has two or three lines and his powers are used one time in the whole film, Juggernaut is just a tad bit more than a cameo and the freak mutants that team up with Magneto are completely annoying. However, on the plus side, we do see Magneto move the entire Golden Gate Bridge, Kelsey Grammer does an amazing job with Beast and Jean Grey/Phoenix will scare the hell out of you. Keep your eyes open at the end right after Wolverine's shot on the balcony of the mansion for the best ending to any superhero film. All I'll say is this final scene is pure gold and will almost frighten you. I can not get the image of it out of my head. If you like the first two, you will like this one, however, like I said before, it didn't measure up to the second one.
B00005JOHC|5.0|I bought this dvd from hongkong and really liked it. the show is great, entertaining however i don't understand why the studio is not releasing the dvds in the US. one more thing i dont understand is why they release the tv show dvds first in hongkong and asia rather than in the US (Joey was released one year back in HK). ultimately what happens is people in US pay high amount to get these movies shipped from HK/China by purchasing through ebay.
B000002UAO|5.0|In \\"The Beatles Anthology\\", George Harrison commented that he didn't see all that much difference between Revolver and Rubber Soul; that they were both very enjoyable albums to make and they could be referred to as 'Part 1 and Part 2'.  Kind of a simplified way of saying that he and his mates were really enjoying their artistic growth (not to mention that he had to be elated to finally having more than one song on an album).  Beach Boy guru and resident genius Brian Wilson went so far as to say that Rubber Soul was the drive that motivated his creation of Pet Sounds, one of Rock's all time greatest albums. <br /> <br />Essentially, Rubber Soul (Released Dec. 3, 1965) marked the end of The Beatlemania period (although there were a few songs which occurred earlier that year on their LP \\"Help!\\") as far as their songwriting was concerned.  With influences from drugs to Dylan and the ever changing social awareness of the goings on around them, they no longer felt that they could write and perform songs without substance.  Ok, ok, so every now and then a \\"Yellow Submarine\\" or \\"All together now\\" or a \\"Wild Honey Pie\\" would occur, but even The Beatles knew that a humorous or \\"silly love song\\" once in a while was always a welcomed treat.  Musically, they were beginning to experiment with \\"new\\" sounds and textures, which would later culminate on \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" and \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\". <br /> <br />Of course, Rubber Soul was also sabotaged by those clever Capitol Records 'butchers' who saw fit to manipulate this remarkable album to their tastes as they again knew that we Americans wouldn't take to the original U.K. release.  In effect, the emerging folk scene was the catalyst for the removal of \\"Drive my car\\", \\"If I needed someone\\", \\"What goes on\\" and \\"Nowhere man\\", to be replaced by \\"I've just seen a face\\" and \\"It's only love\\", both of which appeared on their U.K. LP \\"Help!\\"  The idea was to make Rubber Soul softer in sound and in so doing, allowedCapitol to \\"produce\\" an album called \\"Yesterday...and today\\" containing the deleted songs from Rubber Soul and Revolver, along with \\"We can work it out\\" and \\"Day Tripper\\" (a #1 single of that year) whch was released between the two aforementioned albums.  Capitol's motto: \\"Let no artist's creativity stand in the way of the almighty dollar!\\" <br /> <br />Back to Rubber Soul, now - In it's original format, this was actually one of the (if not THE) first concept albums ever recorded.  Songs which flow to each other smoothly and no \\"filler\\" songs.  The album kicks off with \\"Drive my car\\", one of their many songs that, even though not released as a single, manages, even to this day, to get constant radio airplay.  We begin to see the emergence of John Lennon's songwriting genius, as he dominates this album.  He offers the classic \\"Norwegian Wood (This bird has flown)\\" with a great piece of sitar-playing from George.  This song is one of those Beatles' \\"hits that never were\\" and ranks among one of their most recorded songs of all time.  \\"Nowhere man\\" may be one of the ten best songs he ever wrote and the harmony singing between he, Paul and George is beautiful.  \\"The Word\\" is LOVE!  That says it all.  \\"Girl\\" is as dreamy as it gets, \\"Run for your life\\" (although John often said that he never liked that song) is John at his angry best and \\"In my life\\" (with producer, George Martin, on piano) never fails to produce a tear, especially in the wake of the event of Dec. 8 1980.  Paul's songs aren't quite at the level of John's here, but there are a few gems.  \\"You won't see me\\", with road manager, Mal Evans, on Hammond organ, is true pop music at its best.  \\"Michelle\\", if had been released as a single, would have challenged \\"Yesterday\\" as one of the all time most recorded songs in history.  \\"I'm looking through you\\" features Ringo on Hammond organ (Note that this version does not have the 'false start' as does the version on the U.S. Capitol Records release).  George Harrison's two songs show his peaking  songwriting ability.  \\"Think for yourself\\" is one of his better songs and features Paul on fuzz bass. \\"If I needed someone\\" showcases George as he sings his own harmonies by overdubbing over his lead vocal.  Lastly, \\"What goes on\\" gives Ringo his vocal spotlight as he co-wrote this with John and Paul.  Ringo was tuned in to Country/Western music more than the other three and that would surface later on his second solo LP \\"Beaucoups of Blues\\" in 1970. <br /> <br />As for the U.S. release, it's not quite as bad as Revolver.  By deleting the four songs (mentioned above) and adding those two from the \\"Help!\\" LP, at least there were 12 songs for listening enjoyment.  The obvious difference is the overall sound of the album.  The U.S. Capitol Records version is a little more laid back and the original U.K. release is slightly more electric, thus a stronger album.  Also, let's not forget George Martin, the man behind the Beatles' sound.  There hasn't been enough said about what his contribution as producer (and sometimes performer) has meant to the Beatles' records.  In either format, Rubber Soul is a must-have album, not just for Beatles fans, but for anyone who appreciates the true art of songwriting, performance and production.  It's sad that pop music today is what it is.  I'm so thankful and blessed to have grown up with The Beatles.  Along with many other ground-breaking artists, it was a musical era; the likes of which we'll never see again.  <br /> <br />
B0000CDL93|5.0|I really liked the JFK movie, even though it does mix fact and possible fiction.  It's a movie - it's to be expected.  All this whining about Oliver Stone's politics is virtually useless...save the wannabe-writer-attempts for your next sales meeting while trying to spew Shrub apologist babble.  As for the movie, I think it would bring people into reading more deeply into JFK...possibly of the point of disregarding the movie over time after other facts surface in one's search.  Heck, we've all seen movies that started our interests in something that after the facts were reviewed that the movie was half-bogus, but still a fun watch anyway.  It is a fascinating topic and will always be just like Pearl Harbor, 911, Iran Contra and many other things.  The questions are almost always much more interesting than the answers.  Until we have the answers, I suggest other partisan hacks stop their crying and complaining about Stone's interpretation.  This is a great place to start on becoming interested in one of our most possibly-overrated but never boring leaders if you'd like a place to start.  The acting is good, the music is not too overbearing and it keeps the viewer's attention...which is a lot more than I can say for other Stone movies.
015603252X|2.0|Amos Oz likes to say \\"the first thing you should know about [his] autobiography is that it's not an autobiography. It's an imposition forced on [him] by the Library of Congress.\\" An interesting confession considering \\"A Tale\\" was published  under the genre \\"memoir\\" and went on to reap much acclaim - and quite a bit of money -- as a memoir, including The Koret Jewish Book Award for Autobiography. Asked by befuddled interviewers to clarify himself, Mr. Oz will say only that having asked the dead into his home, \\"they told him the stories he never heard\\". This is a writerly response, with much truth and sense, but it doesn't excuse Mr. Oz for allowing his publisher to tout the work as a memoir or to blame the Library of Congress. Actually, a good old-fashioned name already exists: a semi-biographical novel. Or, if that's not hip enough, call it a post-modernist novel, then, a nod and a wink to the reader to figure out what is real and what isn't. As it stands,the many fans of Mr. Oz ---until now I've considered myself one --- believe they're hearing true stories, not stories conjured by the artist if he listens hard. This year we've been brutal on American writers who've played on the popular taste for truth; we've held them to standards and shouted \\"foul\\" when they haven't lived up to them. It saddens me that a great fiction writer like Mr. Oz hasn't held himself to a higher standard. \\"Oz\\" in Hebrew, we're reminded again and again, means \\"strength.\\" As a \\"moral conscience of the modern world\\", as we're also reminded <br />again and again, Mr. Oz demands \\"strength\\" from Israelis and Palestinians alike. And yet he wants us to accept with a titter of laughter that he was somehow coerced into calling his \\"Tale\\" a memoir. Shame on him. He should know better --- and something tells me he does.
B00005JO9J|1.0|If you expected the main character to be a strong independent woman just because she's a doctor, think again. She's like Bridget Jones times three. She's intimidated by everything, reactionary rather than proactive, and seems to generally have the social and emotional maturity of a twelve year old. I don't think there's been such a child-woman as a lead character in a tv show since Cybill Shephard in Moonlighting. The father/daughter dynamic of the relationship between Dr Shephard and Grey shows a disturbingly archaic attitude towards gender politics.  <br />The plots and supporting characters could potentially make up for the appeal the lead character is lacking, but they don't. They're not actively bad, just bland and inconsequential.  <br />
B000ETQRCM|5.0|I will say without hesitation how great I think this album is. To me it's up there with vitalogy, and just behind ten and vs. It packed a lot more punch than the last few albums, carrying a raw garage sound through songs like life wasted, worldwide suicide, comatose, and the softer melodic side through marker in the sand, and the last few tracks. Great album by pearl jam and rock standards in general. <br /> <br />That said, I've noticed consistently through every single pearl jam album there are those certain idiots always compairing it to nirvana. Its been 15 years now and people are still doing it. I read several reviews bashing this album because nirvana's the better band and pearl jam \\"sucks.\\" Nirvana holds no barring to this album at all. Its like this - Pearl Jam is Pearl Jam, Nirvana is Nirvana and has been over with for 12 years. I love nirvana, but I never understood the arguements over which band is better. I bet if pearl jam disbanded and 20 yrs. from now they decided to get back together and do a reunion album, there'd still be some babbling idiot talking about nirvana in a PEARL JAM review section. <br /> <br />Pearl Jam is good, Nirvana is good, please stop it already. And buy this album, because it's a good pearl jam album.
B00004XQ83|5.0|When I first heard \\"Man of Constant Sorrow\\" while watching the movie \\"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\\" I knew I had to have this album. Normally, I'm not big on movie soundtracks especially when it's bluegrass. However, this is one CD that breaks the rule. You can't go wrong.
B00005LQ04|3.0|I have the 1-disc DVD \\"Dario Argento Collection\\" version w/all <br />sound options (THX, dts/ES, etc.), re-mastered. Gorgeous color, but all through the film, I felt something was wrong. Some of the power was gone, due to the unfamiliar soundtrack. No matter what anyone says, this version does NOT have the original sound- <br />track. I am a musician, and I know an instrument called a \\"slap- <br />per\\", made of wood that made the (much louder, as well) charac- <br />teristic sounds on the original soundtrack. The \\"extras\\" section <br />has the European trailer, which has the real thing on it. Listen to that, and you know what it once was. I actually said to a <br />friend, \\" ... wait til you see the color, and hear the sound- <br />track. They'll blow you away, themselves.\\" I remove 2 stars for <br />the near-ruination of Suspiria's original power. If you can understand a European version, and they haven't made a twinkie <br />out of the soundtrack, get one of those instead.
0060557818|5.0|I had gone to a Neil Gaiman's book signing. Not because of this one book but because of others of his. I noticed that when his fans asked him questions it was mainly about this book. I decided I must buy it and read it.<br /><br />How glad I am that I did. The story takes place in London. Not just the London we know (which is called London above in the book) but also one called London below. Which of course is underground. There a man named Richard is swept from his comfortable and boring life in London above to the more magical and dangerous London below. He meets many new and different people, goes through many perils and is on his own quest to get back to London Above. I don't want to ruin it for you from there but the one thing I can say is that I hated for this book to end. I think I could of gone on forever reading it.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|Michael Buble's voice flows like honey; it's so smooth and sweet. His singing can soothe you to sleep or make you want to get up and dance to songs like \\"Save the Last Dance for Me.\\" <br /> <br />\\"It's Time\\" is just as great as his self-titled album. I can't even express how much I love this guy. His voice is so great. You never hear young people like him with a voice like his that sounds so classic. He sounds like he belongs in the times of Frank Sinatra but fits in great in this era anyways :-) <br /> <br />If you love all kinds of music and are open to anything then I highly recommend Michael Buble. And if you're not open to all kinds of music then you're really missing out.
0060977493|1.0|This book is a sophomoric and pretentious read.  I finished it through to the end to try to give Roy (and the Booker) a chance, but found myself audibly groaning at how cheap the authors use of language is.  Consider the following excerpt from page 280 (note, this is only the first of three similies on this single page): <br /> <br />\\"With every monsoon, the old car settled more firmly into the ground.  Like an angular, arthritic hen settling stiffly on her clutch of eggs.  With no intention of ever getting up.\\" <br /> <br />As I re-read that quote to type it here, a now familliar thought occurs to me again: Literary masturbation is *so* highschool.  <br /> <br />I jokingly told a friend that I would give him a dollar for every page of the book that *didn't* contain a similie and still be able to buy those Manolos I wanted.  And when the similies are this forced -- the book is painful to read.  Not to mention the Curious Capitalizations.  The detailed descriptions of Gratuitious Molestations and Explicit Violence.  (To borrow from Roy's writing, her:) Characters as shallow as a puddle in a grocery-store parking lot where wet bums collected and pissed on walls while society's good people were sleeping in their warm Safe Beds behind Locked Doors.  The Choppiness.  It's just. <br />Bad Writing. <br /> <br />The legacy of colonialism et cetera in an increasingly aware (and selectively apologetic) world contributes towards an unfortunate situation in the arts where priveledged Western institutions (and individuals, even) clamour to raise up and award voices of historically colonialized cultures.  Often, however, the artist's status as 'oppressed' is far more examined than the work itself.  (You know the syndrome: \\"Well, an Indian *woman* wrote it.  And she's speaking out against the caste system...I guess it has to be good) This kind of behavior/thinking is racist, sexist, culturalist etc. and it pisses me off.  The talented writers of India deserve better and the thought of anyone claiming that this hogwash be spoken of in the same breath as works by writers like Rushdie is dispicable and disgusting.
B00005JOVH|3.0|O.k. the storyline was great for the most part, but come on when Charles Xavier dies, how the heck wasn't his stupid wheel cahir blown into pieces when Gene/ Phoenix blows up the house!!!!!!!!!!! I also think that the army/ infantry men they had acting sucked!!! It was just bad directing/casting for that. DON'T GET ME WRONG though, although the movie drags, some of the scenes were well worth it! Dor instance, the Juggernaught scenes where AMAZING, I just didn't like the actor or actress (I really couldn't tell) who was the evil mutant that looked like Prince or Micheal Jackson! But To BE FAIR I'm being very critical, but I expected a lot more out of the movie. If you see the movie, wait after the credits to see an additional scene revealing Magneto still has some of his powers!!! IT was a great shocker/ ending for the movie. The Last Stand yeah right, they are going to make another one shortly! See this movie you'll probably like it! I gave 3 stars b/c the director over dramatized the deaths of cylcops, Gene, and Charles, and also how stupid looking they had the U.S. infantry act. See this movie and see for yourselves, I'm sure you'll most likely enjoy it!
B000F0UV0E|5.0|I must have a  different album than the official Amazon critic listened to!

It may have been a project that took almost a decade to see the light,but thankfully it is now available! If you are a fan of either artist you will enjoy this album.Greg

0671042858|4.0|Shame on me.  As a writer of supernatural suspense, I've avoided King's books for fear of imitating him.  Finally, on a whim, I picked up this book today--and proceeded to read the entire thing in one sitting.  Was it as scary as I expected?  Not at all.  As gory?  As horrific?  No.  Was it well-written and told with heart and soul?  Absolutely.<br /><br />The girl from the title is nine years old, lost in the woods of Maine and New Hampshire, and tracked by an ominous thing.  Young Trisha would write it off as imagination, except for the few signs of horrific evidence she discovers.  She matures through the course of the story, facing her fears, embracing her dreams, and wrestling with issues of family and God.  King does a fantastic job chronicling her survival, her mental state, and her slow deterioration.  His words are fresh, his narrative flowing and believable.<br /><br />In the end, \\"The Girl Who Loved Tom Jordan\\" becomes a modern parable of sorts, a David and Goliath story.  Though King's other stories may be more vulgar, more frightening, more meaty, I'm certainly glad to have made my first stumbling steps into his world of fiction with this slim volume.  Even in a world of subaudible fears and doubts, King points to path of hope.
B00004Y6TQ|5.0|I love the general mood of this soundtrack to \\"Dancer in the Dark\\". I found the good songs;Scatterheart,107 Steps, and Ive seen it all, on Limewire.

0790729644|5.0|It really all started with \\"Seven Samurai\\". Akira Kirosawa wrote, produced and directed the first modern western in 1954. What I mean by modern is the post-war-maybe-America-isn't perfect-and-neither-am-I-western. This movie was remade as \\"The Magnificent Seven\\" six years later. Kirosawa also made \\"Yojimbo\\", \\"Sanjuro\\" and \\"The Hidden Fortress\\" (\\"Fortress\\" is what Lucas based \\"Star Wars\\" on).<br /><br />\\"Yojimbo\\" and \\"Sanjuro\\" were remade as \\"spaghetti\\" or Italian westerns by Sergio Leone with Clint Eastwood. The basic ethos of these movies is to make gunfighters more complex and human- less than the John Wayne ideal.<br /><br />\\"Unforgiven,\\" directed by Eastwood, is the pinnacle of the modern western genre. There are no \\"good\\" guys and \\"bad\\" guys. Everyone's pretty equally rotten. It's really the logical progression of the western to its inevitable conclusion. In fact, there is no need for anyone to ever make a western again. I'm sure Eastwood will never make another. \\"Unforgiven\\" just says it all.
B00003CWPL|5.0|I saw this movie when I was still in high school over my Christmas break. Needless to say, it completely ruined my vacation. Nonetheles, when the new DVD came out, I was extremely reluctant to purchase it as the horrible feeling that followed seemed to sink back in. However, the huge Lynch fan that I am, I gave it another go. <br /> <br />The first thing that I noticed after purchasing the DVD is how crisp and clear the picture is. Never before has anything lynchian looked this good. Additionally, the sound is as great as it was when I first watched it. It's beautiful, mysterious, haunting, and challenging. After the movie ends, silence is horrible company and the urge to turn on a radio is overbearing. The extra features are incredibly interesting and worth a look as well. David Lynch always gave great interviews. <br /> <br />However, what impacted me the most this time around was the story. Not completely understanding the film in high school, this second time around was a real treat for me as my tastes in film have developed greatly. Eraserhead is a piece of art that combines the imagination of Lynch, the style of the painter Francis Bacon, and the technique of the late director Kubrick. It challenges our concept of reality, morality, loneliness and perhaps even concepts of what defines sanity.  <br /> <br />Eraserhead isn't simply a movie; it's the first and most powerful movement in a musical piece for an artist that has shocked and awed American crowds for over forty years. The last time I watched Eraserhead, I cried. I wept for the charcters and the creativity that was delivered. If you seek both inspiration and sensationalistic imgagination, watch Eraserhead. You will be only too happy to be caught up in this horrorifying tragety.

B0000029DD|5.0|Producido por \\"Andy Wallace\\" (Nevermind, Toxicity, Highly Evolved, Chaos A.D), \\"Grace (1993)\\" fue concebido por un hombre (Jeff Buckley) al que se le relacionaba frecuentemente con una vision ingenua de la industria discografica... siento que es verdad, pues para crear un disco tan hermoso y HONESTO como este; hay que tenerla. <br /> <br />Sinceramente esta obra es inrrelatable. Tendriamos primero que recordar que este album es contemporaneo al Nirvana y el grunge que rescato comercialmente la escena alternativa, por lo que sorprende una obra con tan opuesto detalle melodico, armonico y vocal. Logicamente Jeff paso desapercibido para las masas, mas no asi para la critica y los musicos. <br /> <br />¿Que hace tan especial a este CD? <br /> <br />Jeff poseia una voz realmente versatil, heredada por el multi-octavico Tim Buckley, en vivo solia abusar de su notas altas, sin embargo en el album es perfecta. Jeff era un hombre con lo que algunos definen como \\"lagrima\\",  se dice que un nuevo Tom York nacio al escribir \\"Flake Plastic Trees\\" despues de ver a Buckley... yo simplemente puedo decir que \\"Grace\\" es inmensamente conmovedor.  <br /> <br />Un hombre atormentado por rencor, abandono y soledad, pero luminoso como el sol, es la impresion que deja Jeff como ser humano en \\"Grace\\" y esto se percibe en la letra y muisca todo momento. El arreglo intrumental es realmente afortunado (inesperado conciderando el productor), meticuloso y lleno de equilibrio, no existe un sonido que quitarle o que ponerle. <br /> <br />\\"Exotico\\" es casi una definicion perfecta, NO ES UNA OBRA PARA OIDOS POBRES, sui-generis es centrifugar a \\"Led Zepelin\\" con \\"Nina Simone\\"... esto es \\"Grace\\".  <br /> <br />No quiero extenderme mas. Los detractores de esta obra siempre se argumentan sin notarlo en falta de gusto por el estilo (Rock Alternativo). \\"Grace\\" y la obra inedita de Buckley ha tenido enorme repercusion e influencia en los ultimos 10 años. <br /> <br />Mejor Corte- \\"Lover, you should've come over\\" <br /> <br />Influencias- Edith Piaf, Smiths, Bob Dylan, Van Morrison, Morrisey, Nina Simone, Led Zeppelin, Tim Buckley. <br /> <br />Influencio-  Radiohead, Arcade Fire, Coldplay, Alanis Morissette, U2, Robert Plant, Starsailor, etc.
B00005JOVH|4.0|Everyone probably knows the plot from the trailer or TV advertisements (I have a synopsis at the end of this for those that are interested in reading about it). Comic book fans can rejoice as Angel and Beast have finally been introduced into the X-Men films.<br /><br />How has Brett Ratner done with the third \\"X-Men\\" film? Well the good news for those who had their doubts about Ratner is that he didn't screw it up. The main story points were written before he came on board while Singer was still attached to the project so, in many respects, this is an extension of Singer's first two films. The screenplay manages to pack quite a bit of action and resolution into it considering the film runs under two hours. Ratner does a great job setting up the action scenes and even does a solid job during the quieter character moments.<br /><br />The visual effects are stunning particularly a sequence involving Magneto moving the Golden Gate Bridge. There were a few scenes where the visuals weren't 100% convincing (those involving Angel)but on the whole the production is top notch. While Ratner focuses on the action and humor at the expense of the drama at times, he's crafted a fine film that holds up well when compared to the first two installments directed by Bryan Singer.<br /><br />Some fans of the comic book or animated series will probably object to the liberities taken with the storyline and characters but many of the important themes that were handled in the comic book receive their due here. Kelsey Grammer is terrific as Beast even though he probably could have used a bit more screen time and James Marsden although he's used effectively could probably have had his role pumped up a bit as well. While Famke Janssen does a marvelous job in her dual role I felt that she also was under utilized a bit.<br /><br />Synposis:<br />Still grieving over the loss of Jean Grey (Famke Jannsen)Cyclops (James Marsden)has shirked his duties teaching the kids at \\"mutant high\\".

B000EPR7NE|5.0|I am a huge fan of Mr. Zimmer's work, mostly because of his scores for THE LION KING, GLADIATOR, BATMAN BEGINS, KING ARTHUR, BACKDRAFT and others. I simply love his music. The score he has assembled for Ron Howard's THE DA VINCI CODE, inspired on Dan Brown's worldwide best-seller novel does exactly this: creates the right level of tension and excitment, never letting us down. I personally enjoy the music of the last scene of the movie (track 13). I loved the movie, the book and I certainly love the score. One reviewer said wisely: \\"ABSOLUTELY AMAZING\\".

B000FQJAIW|1.0|Lucasfilm is not making any effort to make the unaltered, original versions of these films look, and sound any better, and they are making consumers who already purchased the previous 2004 releases, buy them again with this release.  I say it is time for the consumer to stand up, and quit taking this type of treatment.  Do not purchase these releases, unless Lucasfilm actually takes the time to make the unaltered, original versions of these films look, and sound, their best!
B000AYEIL8|5.0|WOW! What a great movie. It is tastefully created from all of the aspects. There is great scenery and camera work, wonderful soundtrack and great acting by a group of obviously very talented people. And there's this ongoing transition between fantasy and reality that are blended together in such a way that it is sometimes hard to distinguish which one is which. In addition, this movie is a fine example of how smart and sometimes cruel children are. Now a few bad things. I did not like how the movie ended, but I guess the movie wouldn't be as good as it was without a major sacrifice, which was also a great point of this movie. The cat scene is somewhat upsetting, considering that I am a cat person. But, again it was the necessary part and I wouldn't take it away. You want a raw reality of the things that are out there? Then accept what was in the movie. Otherwise, what's the point of owning this movie? This movie is one of those dark comedy motion pictures that have a message, a lesson and entertainment all in one package.<br /><br />Now about DVD. First thing that I want to say is subtitle translation is new and not the same as on VHS. So this new translation is terrible. I don't speak French but, a lot of language is very obviously incorrect. Sometimes there may be situations that called for paraphrase, rather than exact translations, and that wasn't done either. Also, there are no extra features at all. The only thing that is present is movie trailer. A good thing is that there is a DTS sound available.<br /><br />ONE MORE Inconsistency is that French DVD has 115 minutes and American has only 106. I wonder why.
6300215512|5.0|Often lauded as a 'film noir' classic it is not without good reason that Sunset Boulevard sits high within the list of greatest films ever made. An epic portrayl of the shallow fickleness that is Hollywood, it was (and still is) a cutting blow delivered by director, Billy Wilder to the world in which he operated.  <br /> <br />The story of tragic diva, Norma Desmond's desperate attempt to cling to the life of adoration and fame that she once knew by believing in a world that still needed her, brutally depicted the truth of the 'monsters' that were being created by the 'Hollywood Machine'in the late forties.  <br /> <br />The critique of the film's story line is supported by stunning cinematography, amazing lighting and some the greatest one liners ever commited to celuiod. Gloria Swanson's Norma Desmond is breathtakingly portrayed and still classed as a defining performance. Supporting cast and an amazing score go on to prove that while the special effects of today's digital age can make the unreal become true, a truely talented director, crew and cast can still make the real become untrue.  <br /> <br />It is Desmond's desperation to believe that after twenty years her 'people' were still waiting in the dark and the pathetic way she desired struggling writer, Joe Gillis to 'love and need her'that gives a still relevantly stark insight as to how the wonder of the silver screen has a fatal side effect; an almost psychopathical requirement to be wanted.  <br /> <br />Strangely enough though, even after fifty plus years there is still not a film that matches Sunset Boulevard for the bitter and unflattering truth that it portrays of the self obsessed world that is Hollywood. Perhaps not as many directors are as brave as Wilder to 'bite the hand that feeds them'   <br /> <br />
B000002KDO|5.0|Having achieved their commercial peak with their second album, \\"Paranoid\\" (which is not to suggest they had \\"sold out\\"; it just happens to contain their three biggest radio hits ever in Iron Man, War Pigs and the title track), Black Sabbath showed the strength of their musical convictions by resisting any temptation to try and recreate some kind of formula.  Instead, \\"Master Of Reality\\" displayed an even sludgier, darker sound than the band had yet delivered.  No hit single, perhaps, but an abundance of riffs place this album at the top of the heavy metal mountain.<br /><br />Sweet Leaf - sure it's infamous as one of the most adoring anthems to marijuana, but it also features an absolute killer of a riff, and the bridge demonstrates Tony and Geezer's chops and versatility.<br /><br />After Forever - Geezer's bass soars above the sinewy guitar figure laid down by Tony.  This song really highlights the way tuning the guitars down a whole step altered (and improved, IMO) the band's heavy sound.  And the lyrics - well, every time I ever heard someone suggest that Sabbath were devil-worshippers, I'd simply quote this one: \\"God is the only way to love\\"?  There's no irony here; this song is a straight-ahead cautionary tale about the dangers of turning away from God.<br /><br />Embryo - a cute little guitar ditty with strong Spanish influence.  Not really one of Tony's best pieces, however.<br /><br />Children of the Grave - Another monster riff, and while some may take issue with Bill Ward overdubbing extra drums, there's no denying the groove.  Great lyrics again; the same basic themes of loving and caring for each other and our planet that Ozzy would revisit on solo tracks like Revelation: Mother Earth and Crazy Train.<br /><br />Lord of this World: probably the most stereotypical Sabbath track on here; a great riff, and lyrics depicting the downfall of some poor sap who made the mistake of following the devil.<br /><br />Embryo - a very nice acoustic piece by Tony with some tasteful string backing.<br /><br />Solitude - A pretty enough ballad, although like \\"Planet Caravan\\" it does tend to drag a bit.  This one I'll occasionally skip, but Black Sabbath always incorporated a bit of slow, un-distorted music into their work, so it is a valid part of this album.<br /><br />Into The Void - they saved the coolest riff for last.  Tony and Geezer play off of and against each other to perfection, although Ozzy's vocal is a tad repetitive.<br /><br />The funny thing about \\"Master of Reality\\" is that, as dark and doom-laden as the music is, lyrically this is definitely Sabbath's most positive album.  The lyrics read like a hippie enivronmentalist peace rally.y Tony with some tasteful string backing. <br /> <br />Solitude - A pretty enough ballad, although like \\"Planet Caravan\\" it does tend to drag a bit.

B000EULJLU|5.0|I don't know what the fuss is. This album is great straight out of the gate. No explanation needed. No qualification desired. Get on with it.
B0000033OZ|4.0|This memorable debut from the prog supergroup was unmistakably on point in it's pursuit of perfection. While at times stumbling under it's own progressive ambitions, the album remains a tour de force in the pace of the songwriting, from the complex opening to the slow acoustic close (sadly brought way down by overpowering, dated keyboards). Bringing a new foundation to their formative years, the gents of ELP fused many influences ranging from solemn piano concertos to rock fuzzed psychedelia to turn in a head spinning application for a new musical language. This unique musical statement is in no small part due to the wide range, skill, and dominance in songwriting by the pianist, who truly helped mark out a distinct track for their sound.   While the amazing soloing from Emerson is offering enough to study some of the ideas this band was incorporating, by no means do the other two take a back seat, as ELP will most be remembered in my mind for their soaring, classical inspired progressive jams, which far outweigh their actual lyric based material.
B00005JMFQ|4.0|An alright movie for a Sunday night, particuarly if you are curled up on the sofa with the 'other half' and some junk food, but not really a defining moment in cinema.  <br /> <br />One point of note for me, however, was the scene with Emma Thompson set to Joni Mitchell's incredibly poignant later version of Both Sides now. Suprisingly moving, to the point that it brought a tear to my eye! Her depiction of the mother that puts aside her feelings to ensure that her family are not affected by the heartache and betrayl she has discovered made me think of the countless times that my mother must have put on a brave face even though deep inside she may have been falling apart.
B00005JLEU|5.0|If your favorite movies are stricly mindless action flicks, or if you don't like anything out of the ordinary, this film isn't for you. But if you are open to new and innovative ideas, you should definately see it. Sure it may be \\"wierd\\", and a tad-bit slow. But that doesn't matter, because it was interesting. Also, I am sickened by the fact that it was compared to 'Beauty and the Beast', because 'Beauty and the Beast' had a two dollar plot!!! But if you read this, you should seriously consider the first few sentences on this review.
B000EHSVS2|5.0|The Fox \\"Cinema Classic Collection\\" edition of PATTON offers a far superior picture transfer than the previous THX edition.  The new image looks to be from actual 65mm elements and is far less grainy than the old transfer, which looks to have been from 35mm dupes.  However, sometimes colors are a little unstable in new image, with often pinkish hues and reddish flesh tones, but most of the time the picture looks fine. The soundtrack seems the same as the old edition, which was just fine.  All of the extras from the previous edition have been retained, and the new commentary by screenwriter Francis Ford Coppola is interesting.
B000FQJAIW|1.0|The original versions being offered on a \\"bonus\\" disc is insulting. These will be non-enhanced for 16x9 Televisions and come from a 13 year old video transfer.

It's also insulting for people who have already purchased the special editions in 2004/2005 to be asked to re-buy them at a higher cost to receive these \\"bonus\\" discs of a classic film in a less than pristine form. LFL needs at a minimum make a new transfer or the original trilogy. Release this on dvd and then later on hd dvd or blu ray. If that it done, I don't have a problem with buying them again. Give these classics the respect they deserve! Until then I am done with Star Wars. See websites like digitalbits and hometheaterforum for more information.

B0002KVUKW|3.0|C'mon, folks! If you've come to find a darkly sinister and very scary movie .. this probably isn't the one! However, if you just want to be entertained and are looking for a couple of hours' worth of spiking your imagination, this one's worth a watch. I understand that it's not going to rival the fore-runners in this field, but it has a completely different way of looking at some of the better-known ghouls of past generations and I thoroughly enjoyed it. There's some very interesting use of digital graphics and you won't want to miss how Stephen Sommers has adapted such things into a scary/funny story line. It most assuredly doesn't adhere to the normal(?) way of thinking about vampires, monsters and all sorts of flying things, so go into it with an open mind and ... enjoy!
B000005GYI|5.0|I've listened to this album 9-10 times in the last three days since I received it, and I haven't tired yet. In fact, it only whets my appetite for more. If everything in the world I had was taken from me, and I had only 15 bucks left to my name, I'd go on out and buy this album again. Because it would sweeten the agony of my loss and make life possible again. You think I'm exaggerating? If you have any soul at all, if you have even a vestigal appreciation of good music, you will love this album. I have no less than 5000 albums in my collection, and right now this one is in the top ten. Think: Abbey Road. Think: OK Computer. Think: Gil E Jorge. Think: What's Going On. Think: MBV's Loveless. It's that good.

B0009I7NNA|5.0|I was first introduced to Avenged Sevenfold by purchasing \\"Waking the Fallen,\\" which is a good album, but I'm more into classic metal rather than screamo.  Well, singer Matt Shadows blew out his voice from screaming, and now he only sings, which could possibly be the best thing that ever happened to this band.  When I first heard this cd, I was stunned at how much more mature the songwriting and execution are as opposed to their first two albums.  As I kept listening, I came to the conclusion that this is the best metal album since 1991, when Metallica released the black album, Guns N' Roses put out their \\"Use Your Illusion\\" double album, and when Whitecross (for all you Christian rockers like me) released possibly their best with \\"In the Kingdom.\\"  The guitars on \\"City of Evil\\" are absolutely phenomenal and it has some of the best drumming I've ever heard.  If you're a Metallica lover like me and are looking for some great new metal, I highly recommend this.
B00004LN16|1.0|I remember this CD coming out around 1999, and at that time I thought it was the worst album AC/DC ever made.  Now it is seven years later and I still think the same thing.  AC/DC sounds burnt out and over the hill, as if they've ran out of good material, and are now just putting out a bunch of half @ssed filler to keep the royalties coming in.  The music is boring, and the lyrics are dumb: \\"I keep a stiff upper lip\\", and then they rhyme that with \\"I shoot from the hip\\".  How much thought would it take to come up with a song like that?  It sounds like AC/DC just threw this half @ssed garbage together in a couple of days!  \\"Stiff Upper Lip\\" is a perfect example of an old band that used to be good, but is now past their prime and has lost their edge.  It's hard to believe this is the same band that brought us such classics as \\"Highway to Hell\\" and \\"Back in Black\\".  They've really gone downhill in the last 10 to 15 years.
B000F0UV0E|3.0|I love both artists, have numerous CDs by both, and in particular have enjoyed Knopfler's recent melodic journeys.  Here too are a few nice songs, as others have described.  However, the voices in fact do not blend well, nor are there really very many highlights on this effort.  Knopfler's deep, almost spoken voice simply does not work well in consort with Harris's sharp, high and thin voice.  This incompatibility is particularly disconcerting in the harmony choral vocals, but even is distracting when one alternates with the other.  Few songs are memorable, and fewer still truly excellent. All in all, a very average effort, somewhat lost in practice, while appearing quite exciting \\"on paper.\\"  The obvious talent of both redeems this collection somewhat, so that it is still better than a lot out there, but I would rather listen to more than a handful of albums by each done individually before I listen to this again.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|This album is in my oponion the Foo's best to date. It allows you to see a new side of the Foo we have not seen yet. it has their sound that we know rock you out and a new acoustic cd. We have not heard anything like this from the Foo as the acoustic side really shows how musically talented they really are. The first cd really just rocks put it in and let it go, and the acoustic you really have to listen to as the lyrics can mean something different everytime you listen to it.  <br />In Your Honor has to be by far the best song on both cds. It pays tribute to whatever you get out of it in traditional Foo loudness. DOA is another song that will rock you like the Foo know how to. <br />The lyrics of the new cd seem different from previous cds. These lyrics are much more deeper. It seems that Dave has let go of some skeletens hiding in his closet. He puts it out there for you    <br />and you interpert it anyway you want.  <br />If you like loud than you will defenetily be drawn to this cd and if you like soft there is a cd for you also. Thats what is so great about this cd whether you are hard core or like it soft and slow buy the cd <br />I would have to rate this as my favorite Foo cd to date but it ranks up there with The Color and the Shape.
B000EULJLU|3.0|I love Tool and have ever since I bought Undertow when it first came out (Sober sold me right off the bat).  I got Aenima and after a few listens, I was hooked on it.  Lateralus I liked from the get go, but 10,000 days hasn't had the same effect on me as the others.  I have actually quit listening to it after about 5 or 6 times through.  The first 2 songs are good, but after that it is full of ambient crap with some decent songs hidden within.  I don't mind a little bit of the trippy ambient stuff, but this CD is FULL of it.  I guess I haven't taken enough acid or something to get it.  I like mellow music, I mean I listen to classical every night, but this is just noise to make you think \\"dude, that is trippy\\" and it is just a cheap way of getting out of actually having to write songs. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong, the actual songs are very good, almost Aenima-ish and I will listen to the CD just for them.  But there are only really about 5 songs on the whole disc I even listen to.  Undertow, Aenima, and Lateralus had their \\"trippy\\" elements, but they didn't feel like they took up half the CD and I could easily listen to them beginning to end without wanting to find an actual song because I knew one would be coming up soon. <br /> <br />That being said, I actually put Lateralus in after the 2nd or 3rd day I had the CD longing for a Tool CD that I didn't have to skip tracks after every song or fast forward through 5 minutes of crap to find the actual songs. <br /> <br />They still have yet to top Aenima in my opinion.  That is an all-time classic that should be in everyone's collection.
0553213105|5.0|What can I say about Pride and Prejudice that hasn't already been said? I read this when I was in junior high and didn't really like it. What was I thinking? It's been my all-time favorite novel for the past ten years or so. Its themes are the basis for hundreds of novels, movies and plays. Just think of how many stories you've read or seen that have the two main characters disliking each other, bickering and finally realizing that they love each other. If you just can't get enough of Pride and Prejudice, I suggest reading Pamela Aidan's series which tells the same story from Darcy's point of view.
B000EULJLU|5.0|The first time I listened to 10K Days, I liked it alot but didnt fall in love with it straight off - I expected this with Tool. As countless others have suggested, it takes several listens to really digest the brilliance of this recording. Well, i've now listened to it probably at least 25 times since the day it came out and without hesitation I declare it the best Tool album yet. I cant get enough of it, it is like a drug that I need every day. Not even the great Lateralus hooked me like this album has. This band just keeps evolving every time. Those that dont get it, probably wont ever and should just keep listening to Undertow. Those of us who do, are going along for a great ride with this incredible band.
0451526384|5.0|Although Persuasion is generally overshadowed by Jane Austen's more well-known novel, Pride and Prejudice, this is a beautifully written, poignant love story about the strength and endurance of love. Anne receives a proposal she very much wants to accept but is discouraged by a friend of the family who is advising her in the place of Anne's deceased mother. Anne listens, breaks off the relationship, and then regrets her decision. She turns down at least one other proposal that we know of (Charles, who later marries her sister) because she still hasn't gotten over her love for Wentworth. Through a series of coincidences, Anne meets her beau again eight years later and the spark is still there although they both try to keep their feelings hidden. They finally acknowledge their love for each other and ignore the protests of friends and family who would keep them apart. There's a very interesting discussion between the characters in the book about who keeps love alive the longest in the absence of the one they love -- men or women. If you haven't tried this one yet, I think you'll find it very satisfying.
B000002OHF|4.0|The last and acceptable album from the Mark 1 line-up. As it always happens with most big albums follow-ups rarely live up to the formers' glory. With Argus becoming their biggest seller \\"Wishbone Four\\" was a difficult follow-up. Ted Turner would leave after this album only to return for the all instrumental Nouveau Calls album. Laurie Wisefield would replace Ted to continue the twin-lead legacy of WA and to usher a  different but another nice era for the band. Martin's voice shows sings of wear and aging although the melody and the singing spirit is very much there. There are gems from the album, \\"Everybody needs a friend\\", `Ballad of the Beacon\\", \\"Sorrel\\" and \\"Sing out the Song\\". Good music on \\"So Many things to say\\" and \\"Rock and Roll Widow\\" but the familiar twin-lead guitar attack and harmony is diminished. Besides, most of the songs are slow and long and can wear you down. Album cover is a disappointment. Certainly not an attractive cover for the album with the band looking like a bunch of puny kids.   <br /> <br />Wishbone Four, a must for the ardent fan. Wouldn't recommend for the first timer.  <br />
B00005JOVH|5.0|With the new X-MEN finally comes the climax to the great philosophical and physical war between Charles Xavier and Magneto (both portrayed superbly by Star Trek's Patrick Steward and LOTR's Sir Ian McKellen). The original X-men movie is single-handedly responsible for proving that a decent MARVEL superhero movie could be made, effectively paving the way for SPIDER-MAN, which raised the bar even higher for the genre. In X-MEN: the LAST STAND, the mutants of Xaiver's school are back and growing in number as more comic characters are included in the third installment of the film series. Notable are the additions of KELSEY GRAMMER as the cerebral blue-furred BEAST a.k.a. Dr. Hank Mcoy . The BEAST was one of the 60's comic book original X-Men, along with the winged mutant THE ANGEL, played by Ben Foster (6 Feet Under). Vinnie Jones  is  the unstoppable fighting machine Juggernaut(who does not appear to be related to Prof. X in this incarnation). Other mutants returning for extended appearences are Kitty Pryde a.k.a. SHADOWCAT who can pass thru walls, more of the steel-skinned Colossus, more from the traitorous PYRO. Oscar-winner Anna Paquin returns as ROGUE,struggling with her relations & mutant powers. Shawn Ashmore again plays Bobby Drake a.k.a ICEMAN, throwing comic fans a frosty treat appearing briefly in ice-form. Rebecca Romijn is back in her glorious blue nakedness as the evil Mystique and Aaron Stanford as the disgruntled PYRO. James Marsden returns (briefly) as a grief-stricken Cyclops, even his lost-lady-love returns with Famke Janssen again as Jean Grey and more(read story summary below). Of course, Hugh Jackman returns as Wolverine, Jackman is still a perfect Wolverine.

B0006SSOHM|2.0|This DVD comes in a very chic clear box, that's the good news - the bad news is everything else.  The real horror of Saw is watching a fine actor like Danny Glover damage his reputation by appearing in it - I would suggest that a much more interesting film could be made showing how a gentleman like Mr. Glover could be driven to such desperate ends.  After that, the most disturbing thing about Saw is the pretensions to intellectualism exhibited by its director, James Wan, and writer Leigh Whannell (who also acts like a person acting in the picture).<br /><br />These individuals have studied their betters carefully, combing through Se7en, Silence of the Lambs, and more obscure efforts like Deathtrap and Sleuth.  Indeed, if these two had any skill at all, they might have structured the film as a play and shot the whole thing in that filthy room with the two protagonists and alleged corpse. Unfortunately, they aren't clever; they just want you to believe they are.  What drives all four of those better films is fantastic characters whose obsessions and peculiarities are fascinating.  Saw offers us a women slitting open the belly of a man so that she can paw through his intestines in time to find the key that will save her from having her head split in half.  (Edward Albee eat your heart out!)<br /><br />Which brings us to Jigsaw, the mastermind behind these devious \\"hands-off\\" killings, orchestrated so ingeniously.  Just where do the Jigsaws of the world come from?  These psychopaths seem to have unlimited time and resources, whiling away the hours dreaming up imaginative tortures, leaving lots of cleverly encrypted clues, adding presentational flair and panache to their intricate delivery, and of course, spending countless hours on victim research and pre-planning diabolical snares.  How convenient for everyone!<br /><br />If you're a 14-year old boy and video games aren't violent enough for you, you will find something satisfying in Saw.  However, if you know better, but you just have a hankering for senseless gore and mayhem, spare yourself the pseudo-intellectualism and get High Tension instead.ring for senseless gore and mayhem, spare yourself the pseudo-intellectualism and get High Tension instead.

B000A7DVR2|4.0|Fargo is close to perfect; multiple viewings only make it better.  Perhaps the Coen brothers decided that for their next effort they would just have fun.  Who knows?  But where Fargo is disciplined, structured, and perfectly timed, with well-drawn characters that live on the screen - The Big Lebowski seems lost from the opening credits, swerving around in a fog of passive stupidity, acted upon rather than acting.<br /><br />This, is course, is due to the nature of its protagonist, The Dude, played with convincing sloth by Jeff Bridges.  (Rumor has it that Bridges prepared for the part by smoking pot incessantly, drinking heavily, and going for days without changing his clothes - what a pro!)  To burn an entire sentence describing the action would be to squander perfectly good English words - this movie celebrates its pointlessness gleefully.  However, what it lacks in traditional film staples like motivation, characters worth caring about, development, and meaningful conflict, it returns in the form of quirkiness - and nobody does quirkiness quite like the Coen brothers.<br /><br />John Goodman is insufferable as Walter, the deranged vet.  Every second he's on screen, somewhere, somebody races to the bathroom.  As Donny, Steve Buscemi is hilarious - no one since Chaplin has made so much out of so little dialogue.  John Turturro is amazing as Jesus, the diabolical bowling maniac clad in purple.  Tara Reid's Bunny is compelling and visually pleasing, while the great Julianne Moore provides the movie with one of its most memorable scenes.  Naked except for a leather harness, and suspended high in the air above a massive canvas, she soars through space, hanging on a wire, frantically hurling paint as she goes.  Such a scene would make even an awful movie wonderful, and The Big Lebowski, while flawed, is not awful.<br /><br />The other truly sensational scene is the bowling dream, a Busby Berkeley-like hallucination The Dude has after being knocked unconscious.  This too is marvelous enough to redeem the picture.  No discussion of The Big Lebowski would be complete with a mention of the three Nihilists - painfully thin men dressed in black who hunt The Dude with their weapon of choice - ferrets.  Nobody will be seated during the horrifying throw-the-ferrets-into-the-bathtub scene!<br /><br />In short, there's enough fun here to make the trip worthwhile.  TBL is not a great movie, at times it's like the idea of a movie that's too lazy to get out of bed, but the Coen brothers are just so good, and so good at being funny, that the trip is always worthwhile - even if there's no destination.redeem the picture.

B00005JL2O|3.0|Although this movie has a lot of funny parts, I would just stick to Austin Powers: The Spy who Shagged Me. A vast majority of the jokes from the 2nd hilarious movie were recycled by the 3rd movie just not as funny. Its almost like Mike Myers couldnt think of anything original which really let me down. <br /> If you've already seen the 1st 2 movies, I guess your semi obligated to see the 3rd, just dont be expecting the same comic originality as the previous.
B000001F9N|5.0|Love Trilogy is one of the sexiest albums i have ever heard and it finds Ms. Summer in full steamy siren mode.  \\"Try me,I know we can make it\\" grooves along with hot dripping sensuality and captures Donna singing a seductive breathy falsetto throughout and then bulking up her vocals to tell you that \\"we can make it if we try\\".  Are you willing to make it with Donna or is it too much for you to handle????  \\"A prelude to love\\" finds Donna confessin',pleadin' and panting away in hot smoldering ecstacy which leads into the classic rendition of \\"Could it be magic\\".  Donna gives this Manilow classic a sexiness mixed with a contained yet fragile urgency that the original never had and you can feel the desperation and heartfelt sincerity in Donna's delivery resulting in one of her most compelling performances.  \\"Wasted\\" is a great little funky dance number which will get your feet shuffling and your body grooving and \\"Come with Me\\" closes out this love trilogy with a shake your booty get down and boogie disco vibe that's so hot that you'll need to call your lover to release that fire scorching from within you or to cool down those family jewels...  OUCH!!!!!!!!!!!  Simply put, Love Trilogy is a finger lickin' lip smackin' disco classic  and is without a doubt the SEXIEST Donna Summer album ever.  So get those fingers walking and let the music do the talking....    O.F.
B000FQJAIW|1.0|Unfortunately, Lucasfilm has taken the quick & cheap option of using film transfers from 1993 for the 2nd discs of these limited editions.  They are letterbox transfers made for laserdisc releases 13 years ago and are not up to the video and audio standards required for a DVD presentation of acceptable quality.  For anyone who owns a 16:9 high definition TV, or will in the future (and that will be the majority  of us in the next few years) these 2nd discs are not optimized for you.  Imagine, the folks who brought us THX, which has set such a high standard for the best presentation of films in both movie theater and home theater settings, releases such a sub-standard, shoddy product.  Lucas is determined to insure that the ORIGINAL version of these beloved films will not look as good as his \\"Special Edition\\" CGI'ed tinkered-with versions.  So he won't allow the originals to get the same quality treatment that the newer editions--as well as every other bit of bonus material has received--for their DVD release.  Shameful.  For the sake of film history, as well as the fans who wish to see these films in their original versions (before the addition of new CGI effects), Lucasfilm should provide quality transfers, optimized for 16:9 widescreen playback, utilizing the full resolution that the DVD format is capable of. Don't buy these releases; it's nothing more than a quick money grab...
B000EMGAOY|5.0|I have had this album since it came out, 8th May, at first I was disapointed and felt abit saddened by it. <br />After several listens though (well not really several, like 80 times per song.) <br />I have come up with songs that should be on the greatest hits, or what may become famous. <br />Are you sitting comfortably? <br />Then I shall begin. <br /> <br />For greatest hits; (Think realisticly.) <br />1. Dani California (Obviously it was number 1 in charts) <br />2. Stadium Arcadium (Melancholy works!) <br />3. Animal Bar <br />4. Turn It Again. (They are more great songs though, like 21 other great songs) <br /> <br />Could be famous hits; <br />1. Dani California (Already) <br />2. Hump De Bump (Good potiental) <br />3. Charlie (As above) <br />4. Stadium Arcadium (I'm more hoping this to be famous) <br />5. Turn It Again <br />6. 21st Century <br />7. Desecration Smile <br />8. Death Of A Martian <br /> <br />Because the album is so long, that means there's more hits, well in this case. <br /> <br />The album starts of with \\"Dani California\\" which everyone knows so well, the rock beat and vocals set you off in a good mood, <br />Then comes a nice cooling down intro, in which the lyrics are perfect, obviously im talking about \\"Snow (Hey Oh)\\", soon comes \\"Charlie\\" a sing-a-long and you may sound yourself shouting the chorus, \\"Stadium Arcadium\\" brings the sweet melancholy that blends so well and creates a perfect image of what maybe the video will look like, even though it takes time to get into this song, you eventually start loving this song and keep on playing it again and again and again...... <br />\\"Hump De Bump\\" livelys up yourself and brings a great funk sound, which all you Early RHCP fans will love! <br />\\"She's Only 18\\" such powerful lyrics, almost haunthing like, the way he saying mean things sound like he is saying them nicely, Its like a got-to-be-there-expeirance. Good song. <br />\\"Slow Cheetah\\", probably most poeples favourite, and I can understand why, could of been on By The Way, perfect sound for it. \\"Torture Me\\" is a damanding song which makes you think does he really want to be tortured? But thats the sign of a good song as it gets you think, the vocals are brilliant again. <br />\\"Strip My Mind\\", some would think an average song, it doesnt really make you feel anything, the chorus is good though. <br />\\"Especially In Michigan\\", its amazing how they can find so many rhyming words Michigan, yeah I think of at least 2, but still. Good song. \\"Warlocks\\" is funky and grooves every second of the song, the groove only stops when the song ends. <br />\\"C'mon Girl\\", average song to be honest, abit like Strip My Mind, good chorus. <br />\\"Wet Sand\\", lyrics are perfect, vocals are, and overal sound is amazing! Definately one of my personal favourites, listen it over and over again and it grovws on you more and more. <br />\\"Hey\\", Catchy song. Nothing else really. <br /> <br />Disk 2 <br />\\"Desecration Smile\\", the song has a catchy chorus, as well as a good verse, another good song, good way to start Mars. <br />\\"Tell Me Baby\\", Starts of acoustic, then to funk, then to rapping vocals, then to acoustic chorus, back to funk rapping, GREAT SONG! \\"Hard To Concentrate\\", I tried to get into this but still haven't it may grow on me. So far average. <br />\\"21st Century\\", a commercial song really, but a good song too, that always makes a famous song, etc American Idoit, Holiday. <br />\\"She Looks To Me\\", my brothers second favourite on the album, and I can see why, I just love this one, you can really tell he is talking about a loved one, thats what catchies me the most. <br />\\"Readymade\\", rock,funk maybe even punk, a great RHCP song which certainly has a good chance of becoming famous.  <br />\\"If\\", awaiting me to like, I've never really bothered with it, then when I have it sound rather boring, nevertheless I could change my mind. <br />\\"Make You Feel Better\\", a fast acoustic song, very unusaul for RHCP, but works well and becomes alot of poeples favourites. <br />\\"Animal Bar\\", my brothers favourite song, good chorus with good lyrics, even though the lyrics are wierd thats what brings the fun into it. \\"So Much I\\", Anthony Kiedis brings yet again a great vocal performance, I love this song simply for the vocals, the lyrics are excellant too. \\"Storm In A Teacup\\", at first it was my favourite, I just adored the funk, good funk songs always make me feel great, and this song will do that! <br />\\"We Believe\\", good beggining and chorus, adn the song still improves when the choir comes in, but then the song is ruined slighty when his voice just starts getting quiter and it finishes, when they should of carried on, and ended in a guitar solo like, \\"Wet Sand\\". \\"Turn It Again\\", I love the riff in this, all the way through the song is amazing and not a bad moment, I just hope this comes reconised by the public. <br />\\"Death Of A Martian\\", the rapping at the end, first caught my attention to the song, and after it catching my attention I began to love all the song, but the rapping is still the best bit. And I'm not very much into rap. <br /> <br />To put this in short words \\"This-Album-Rocks!\\", please pick it up, despite some of the bad reviews, they just haven't listen to it probably. <br />If you don't it will be your own lose.
B00006L3S3|5.0|Meat City was always a favorite Lennon song of mine. This album is my all-time favorite John album. He pushes the limits like he always liked to and does his strange wordplay thing. I think he is the master of that. This is sort of a forgotten Lennon album because there weren't really many hits, if any at the time, from this. But, it's a great example of John's lyrical and musical ability. I think you should listen for yourself. You won't be disappointed.
B00005JOVH|4.0|thats all well and good, but where the hell is nightcrawler!!!???  do they even explain where he is? I felt someone should mention him. After all he is part of the classic lineup alongside cyclops,prof.x,wolvie,storm,colossus,etc......  <br />and he is one of my fave characters, I was stoked that he was in part 2 <br /> as for the 4 stars....well, its a great movie series. I have not seen the 3rd one yet. lost a star for not having Nightcrawler!
B000B2YQX4|2.0|I love depeche mode and I really think they struck a nerve and found their souls in Songs of Faith & Devotion and Ultra.  <br />Think back for a minute and realize what made those 2 albums so powerful. For one, the band was bouncing back from depression and drug use. Second, they used (for the most part) natural instruments. When those drums (from a real drum set) came crashing down, you felt it right through your spine. The synthesizer just doesn't provide that reality...cause it is what it is....synthesized music...yuk. <br /> <br />Sorry, but I'm sooo over their 80's sound.  Time to break new ground guys. <br /> <br />Dissapointed fan.
B000002UJQ|5.0|And the third best of all-time, only behind Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon and the Beatles' Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band.  This album is just amazing from start to finish.  radiohead captures you with their mysterious background noises, to create a very interesting ambiance that very few bands can emulate.  Each song can hold its own as single, but they all come together to make this masterpiece of an album.   <br /> <br />Let's take a look at the track-by track listings. This is scored from 1-100, with 50 being average.  I grade very hard, and very few songs can achieve a score over 90 (I've only given about 70 songs a score of 90 or above).  Most radio friendly songs are in the upper 70s and above (usually 75+).  With that in mind, here is a song-by-song look at OK Computer: <br /> <br />Airbag (84/100) -- A very distinctive opener, it sets up the first half of the album, and creates a memorable ambiance.  After the drums and Thom Yorke's voice enter, you know this is a Radiohead song.  It is a fairly catchy song, and has a little bit of everything from the album, yet is one of the weaker tracks on it.   <br /> <br />Paranoid Android (97/100) -- This is the quintessential Radiohead song.  Similar to the Doors' LA Woman and Pink Floyd's Dogs, if you like this song, you will surely like the rest of Radiohead's works.  If you don't like it, this album is not for you.  Paranoid Android combines everything, from great vocals by Yorke, to a great opening riff, to a great jam session in the middle, all without losing focus from the song.  This song is different for everyone, and must be experienced first.  This is definitely one of the ten greatest songs ever recorded.   <br /> <br />Subterranean Homesick Alien (84/100)-- If I recall correctly, this was the most played song from OK Computer, yet surprisingly, it is a weak track in the album (but still a great song compared to other songs by other artists).  This song is more bouncy and spacey (given the title) than the rest of the songs on the album, but still sounds very Radiohead-esque.  It is still a great song, it simply pales in comparison to teh rest of the album. <br /> <br />Exit Music (For a Film) (88/100)-- The uppity SHA exits, and this slower, more mellow song (with an older, Pablo Honey feel) takes over.  It slows down all the commotion of the first three tracks, and sets up the middle portion of the CD.  Thom Yorke's voice resonates over the keyboards and guitar, but each piece is integral to the song.  Then, again background noises pop up, subtly, but noticeably.  This song is put together brilliantly. <br /> <br />Let Down (87/100) -- Just as a title suggests, this song is like a feather floating back down to earth.  The chorus is catchy, the drums are there, but the overall tone is soft, but not as soft as Exit Music.  The album begins to pick up speed again. <br /> <br />Karma Police (91/100)-- Many first-time listeners skip all the tracks all the way down to number 6, where they put this one on.  From the opening piano riff, to the hazy sounds in the end, every moment in the song seems perfectly placed.  The dominant piano, in conjunction with the guitar make this a huge fan favorite. <br /> <br />Fitter Happier -- This is not a real song, but more of an interlude about halfway through the album.  The Stephen Hawking voice is a little disturbing, but also calming, while Thom Yorke's drunken piano playing kicks in halfway through. This gives OK Computer more of the sense of an album, and not just a collection of songs. <br /> <br />Electioneering (93/100) -- This is another trademark Radiohead song that would fit well on either of their previous albums as well.  It is political and a harder rock song than any other on the album.  It also has a great opening riff. <br /> <br />Climbing Up the Walls (88/100)-- A recurring theme in OK Computer is the background noises, and this song is the climax of it.  The  song itself is good; good enough to alone be worth an 80 overall, but its creepy background noises create the image that you are actually there.  just close your eyes and listen, and you will know what I mean. <br /> <br />No Surprises (85/100) -- Another radio song, No Surprises, starts out softly and bouncily, taking us away from the hellish Climbing Up The Walls.  Yorke's voice is softer, and more uplifting.  This song begins the closing of the album. <br /> <br />Lucky (86/100) -- Seeming to mirror the SHA and Exit Music, this song starts out a lot lower, and a bit sadder than No Surprises, but as a surpirse, it picks up a little bit in the chorus and then back down again.  It dampens to the final track. <br /> <br />The Tourist (85/100) -- This closing track is very mellow, but still has te background noises and Radiohead feel to it.  It is trying to end up softly, like a car braking to a red light.  There is a solo from each band member, and Yorke's voice again amazes. The closing keyboard ends the album, with all of its ups and downs in a peaceful way. <br /> <br />In conclusion, this album (from 1997) is one fo the best ever.  Many people will not like it, because unlike a Kelly Clarkson song, you cannot jsut get into it in 30 seconds.  It takes a good few listens to fully appreciate it.  It does not have a Britney Spears-like chorus that catches you right away, but after a few listens, you will apreciate all the choruses, and musical ability.  OK Computer is the best album of the last 20 years (better than Appetite for Destruction, Nevermind, In Utero, Bulls  on Parade, and Oh, Inverted World).  It is truly amazing, once you get into it.  Please, take a listen, and enter the world of Radiohead.  It is a shame that most radio stations do not really play Radiohead much, because they are truly one of the greatest bands of all time.
B000002O51|5.0|In the days one-album-a-year contract with music label was pretty common, absence of 8 years could mean the band is dead. Even if the band managed to restart, are there market enough to boost the sales of the album? Boston with this third album in 1986 did such miracle like a phoenix from the ashes. Also this title is one of my all-time top favarite albums.<br /><br />The album despite the fact it produced three huge hits including Amanda which became first #1 single for the band, is a concept album describing the third huge leap in your life stage. So the core track is three-parted THE LAUNCH with very progressive approach, rare for the music during 80s. The rest are carefully chosen to fit the very theme of the album.<br /><br />AMANDA opening and the band's biggest hit also has reprises in the album such as MY DESTINATION or partly HOLLYANNA the last track. WE'RE READY which became the second biggest hit from the album works as a prelude to the opus THE LAUNCH. THE LAUNCH is the instrumental which provides the very reason you buy this album and listen to the album as a whole work. COOL THE ENGINES set the tone back to pop-oriented side of the album while A NEW WORLD resides as a last stand for the pompous rock the symbol of 70s progressive rock. TO BE A MAN, I THINK I LIKE IT and CAN'T CHA SAY again invites you to the mellower yet dynamic pop rock the trademark sound of BOSTON. HOLLYANN is the variation of AMANDA in opening part yet closes the album with ethreal chorus.<br /><br />Verdict: The last glory of classic 70s styled rock.<br /><br />Rating: 97 out of 100<br /><br />Recommended for: Pompous Rock fans who like 70s Queen, Kansas, Styx, Asia and Yes. Also essential for 80s rock collectors.
B0000019PA|5.0|This is simply one of the most beautiful, meloncholy, and yet uplifting albums I own.  The title track gives me goosebumps every time, and makes me feel all the beauty of life and bittersweet of death.  That's all I can really say about it.  Get this album if you are serious about music.  I hope you will love it as much as I do.
B000HCO83Q|3.0|Brett Ratner (Rush Hour 1-3) keeps true to the look of the other films and he can handle action and big special effects. Still, he's a lot more careless than Bryan Singer. He goes for a no one is safe approach and kills off some main characters. He also wanted to introduce new mutants, which is why he killed off some people and why Night Crawler is no where to be seen. Kelsey Grammer is at least a good addition to the cast as Beast and same with Ellen Page as Kitty Pryde. Vinnie Jones isn't a bad Juddernaught as well. He's the best new villain, but all the other villains that Ratner introduced though are undeveloped and just wear leather and look like porn stars lol. So half of them I didn't even know if they were from the comics or not since we don't even get their names.<br /><br />  While there's no going back with how bad it is with what they did with Cyclops. James Marsden was punished for choosing to be in Superman Returns but they all punished fans as well. While Famke Janssen who was excellent in X-2 is just wasted here with a blank stare and barely any lines as Dark Phoenix. Halle Berry who always demanded that Storm had more to do since...she's an Oscar winner got her wish though. Cyclops gets pushed back as leader just so we get more of her. Meanwhile someone needs to crush her ego by reminding her that she was in CatWoman. She was never even right for the part of Storm. It's Jenssen who actually deserved more to do as Jean Grey.<br /><br />  As a last film the movie doesn't work as well since it hints to things to come in the credits. Which is why it bugs me when some fans say, hey there's still origin movies coming out. I just want to know what happens next. We already have a good idea to what happened with Wolverine before the X-men movies. Same with Magneto who also has an origin movie coming out. I'm not sure how they could clean up the mess that Ratner made with this film with a part 4 but I'd still like to Singer come back and try. He at least loves and respects the characters enough not to kill them off.s and respects the characters enough not to kill them off.
B00005JOE8|5.0|I went to see this movie without any information about it, almost resigned, as a companion. I thought I was going to be another comic adapted to the big screen. Another expensive proof of the Hollywood's lack of ideas. And, OH! BIG SURPRISE! It was a great movie, ideologically shocking, surely a pain in the capitalist's ass! I LOVED IT. YOU MUST SEE IT, if you want to think, discuss, argue, and even if you want to hate it. You will not be indiferent!
B00000F169|2.0|Dark Star is as if the Ren and Stimpy episode, \\"Space Madness\\" were made into a live action film and extended into feature film length. Like George Lucas' debut THX-1138, it is a film that would be forgotten if the director had not gone onto bigger and better things. It might pass if you have a fetish for cheesy 70's sci-fi such as Soylent Green and Logan's Run. For the rest of us all I can say is give me a break. The talking voice is lifted straight from HAL in 2001. The effects are so terrible that its hard not to burst out laughing when one of the main characters have a dialogue and a fight with a beachball (!). Otherwise, it just seems as if everyone is stoned. I can forgive John Carpenter, because after all its just a student film and he went on to make Halloween, which is probably one of the best horror films of all times. I just wouldn't rush to watch this. You'll feel as if you're trapped in space with the characters the whole time. As one of them says, \\"I like it up here\\".
B000EGF0B4|5.0|I have simply fallen in love with this film!!! Heath Ledger & Jake Gyllenhaal were absolutely phenomenal!!! These two amazing gentlemen captured human emotions & feelings so fantastically I cannot explain. Heath was exceptional as Ennis! He just brought the character to life and made us understand where he was coming from and how difficult it was for him to accept what he was feeling, wanting, and going through. Heath comes across as a stubborn man who doesn't want to accept what he feels for Jake. One of my favorite scenes is when he and Jake say goodbye and Jake's looking at him walk away through the car side mirror. Then Heath's character shows how he feels when he is kneeling down in the barn house and is huffing and puffing and crying because he's so confused, angry, and sad about what's he's feeling inside and because Jake and him just said goodbye. The kissing scenes and the scenes of them lying down together were magnificent. Although the scenes had something to do with sexuality they also had to do with human release and being at peace and ease with another human soul. There was so much art and beauty shown in this film that you can't help but watch it again and again. The maturity and depth shown in this movie is outstanding. I give both Jake & Heath props for their incredible portrayal of two human souls in the most beautiful and realistic way. This film has made me an even bigger fan of both Heath & Jake. I respect them and their talent so much now. I must also admit that seeing them together was a bit of a turn on for me not only because they are two handsome hotties. But also because they portrayed the male species in a more humanly beautiful way than I have ever seen on film. Although Heath seemed so angry and hard to get through to you could understand why and what made him act that way. Some may look at some of the scenes when they're fighting and see them as violent. But for me I saw it as the venting of confusion that they both were feeling and going through. I mean Heath's character was brought up to be some kind of a tough guy and manly man. So when Heath's character Ennis starts to have feelings for Jake's character Jack this ignites Ennis's state of confusion and unwillingness to accept what he's feeling inside. It's like he wants this thing inside of him to go away but he can't control it. It seems to me like that makes him more and more withdrawn through the film and more unable to express himself. He wants to deny what is happening but can't deny his feelings for Jake's character. I really enjoyed this film because it was so mature and so real. I also loved Michelle Williams's portrayal of Ennis's devastated wife. She was right on the money in every scene. I also loved Anne Hathaway as Jack's wife. You could sense what Anne was feeling in a single facial expression! All and all the actors were great. The feel of the film was so real and intense. This will probably be one of my favorite films for a long time to come!  <br /> <br />
B000FQJAIW|1.0|The poor man only has three movies to rape for profit, give the hack a break. Whose gonna buy 5 versions of the Howard The Duck special edition \\"now with new scenes!\\" His talent was apparently removed in 1983.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|For those of us who are rabid Jane Austen fans, like myself, who went in to watch this looking forward to it but not expecting much after watching the superb and nearly-flawless BBC miniseries with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth countless times, this movie was a joyous and exhilerating shock. I admit that after watching the preview and reading everything there was to read about it before it  came out, I wasn't expecting much.I was still crazy-wild to see it-it looked very romantic and come on, its Pride and Prejudice-but Matthew MacFadyen as Darcy looked plain and boring, and some of the changes to the handling of the atmostphere and everything sounded very dubious. Having said that, I went in and came out stunned. The new movie is gorgeous, tender, passionate, lovely, fun. But mostly it brought back to me a feeling of what love is really like-that understanding that we've lost so completely after hordes of mediocre and wishy-washy romantic comedies and soap operas. The only thing that has come close to re-creating that feeling is Titanic,and I thought that Pride and Prejudice did a better job. And Matthew MacFadyen was superb as Darcy. He is Darcy-he captures a different version, a different part of him than Colin Firth, but he is as utterly him as Firth was. The man was perfect-by the end of the movie you are utterly in love with him. He starts out, like the movie,a little bit of a nonentity-you're not sure whether you like him or not. Then both he and the movie pick up speed and from there it just gets better and better until the ending, which is as nearly perfect as a movie ending can be. Don't mistake me-the old Pride and Prejudice will always in the end be the quintessential one, and Colin Firth's Darcy remains at the peak-but this movie is very nearly as good and MacFadyen's Darcy is really just as good, in a very different way(I never thought I would say that). MacFadyen played him with shyness, intensity, subtlety, warmth, idiocy, humour, and charm by turns,and by doing so turns out a very human and completely-perfect man.

B000002UA0|5.0|This is Pink Floyd's debut album from Aug 1967. This album is unique in the fact that this was when Syd Barrett fronted the band. A very different sound than your typical Pink Floyd album. For one thing this album does not have the \\"heavy\\" sound that would typify future Floyd albums. Barrett's strength was in crafting short excellent pop psych tunes much like the ones in the album with the exception of of \\"Interstellar Overdrive\\" a wonderful instrumental feat within itself. The songs consists of chiming guitars and spooky organ breaks. Syd's weird sense of humor comes across here in songs like \\"Scarecrow\\" and \\"Bike\\".  <br /> <br />So be forewarned this again does not sound like your typical Floyd album with David Gilmour on guitar. \\"Piper\\" is much lighter and whimsical.
B00008EY9G|5.0|James Mangold Identity is one hell of a movie. The twist is amazing, didn't see that coming. The ending will shock you to pieces. John Cusack and Amanda Peet are superb in their roles, he plays a former cop and she plays a hooker trying to get home to Flordia. Clea Duvall also appears in this film, Duvall was previously in Girl, Interrupted (another Mangold film). This film kept me interested for all its 90 minutes. Great direction, top-notch acting, and awesome plot. Identity is the best pyschological thriller of all-time, I highly recommend this engrossing little film.
B00005JNEI|1.0|I support Bush, but I am always open to listening to opposition.<br /><br />This movie is only good if you're anti-Bush.  It completely just shows one side of the story and edited out anything that wouldn't completely seem anti-Bush.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I knew this movie would be anti-Bush, but I thought it would atleast show some of the other side of the story.  Instead, all you get is a fat guy acting like he should be president, ridiculing every little thing George Bush did.
B00009UW0N|5.0|John Carpenter's classic horror flick, Halloween is sickly cool. This was Jamie Lee Curtis's first major role and boy she is brilliant as Laurie. Could this movie be any better, some critics have accused this film as being to slow especially when it comes to killing scenes but I think the tempo is right on. The beginning is so amazing and freaky, Michael Myers kills his sister for having...sex with her boyfriend. After that horrific incident Michael is placed in an instution but when he is a grown man he escapes and he returns to his childhood home to get his pent-up revenge on unsuspecting horny teenagers. But how can Michael kill Laurie when she is a virgin? Well you will just have to watch this little treasure to see what happens, enjoy!
B000000OAC|5.0|The Queen juggernaut reached it's apex here with \\"News of the World.\\" They were one of the biggest bands on the planet at the time. They had been all over the radio with huge hits like \\"You're My Best Friend\\", \\"Somebody to Love\\" and the ubiquitous, unique \\"Bohemian Rhpasody\\", but reached unprecedented levels with that huge combo single that opens the record. <br />One could not escape (actually, one STILL cannot) that thundering crowd-stomping intro of \\"We Will Rock You\\" that entire year. It was everywhere then, and continues to live on now in sport stadiums and obscenely popular televised karaoke competitions.  <br />The abrupt shift into the plaintive vocals of Freddie Mercury, followed by a piano accompaniment is pleasantly jarring, and escorts us into one of the best-known singles of the era. <br />There is a lot more to the album than just that song, though. <br />Actually, many of the varied styles they dabbled in throughout their career can be found here. <br />The breakneck rocker, \\"Sheer Heart Attack\\" precedes an example of their melodramatic pop-opera in \\"All Dead, All Dead.\\" <br />\\"Spread Your Wings\\" is a straightforward pop ballad; \\"Fight From The Inside\\" a snarling rock anthem. <br />\\"Get Down, Make Love\\" is a strange amalgam of moody, dramatized slow \\"hard rock\\"...I don't know why it reminded me of some old Gene Simmons-led KISS songs, but it did. <br />The end of the album has a jaunty, bluesy \\"Sidewalk\\", stadium-friendly fist-pumpers like \\"It's Late\\" and a retro, turn-of-the-century frolic in \\"My Melancholy Blues.\\" <br /> <br />This is a clearly biased review, as I LOVED this album in junior high. This was definitely the right album at the right time for me. <br /> <br />It's held up pretty well over the years...I was almost embarrassed at how much I still remembered...and still enjoyed...this classic album.
B000ASDFEU|2.0|A Bridge Too Far has been one of my favorite films for a long time. It was the first more-or-less realistic war movie I saw as a kid and has held its own against more modern movies ever since, giving up its spot at the top of my list only to titles like Saving Private Ryan. That said, I was dissatisfied with the old DVD release, and looked forward to this special edition as a chance to get a better transfer of the film.<br /><br />No such luck. The picture quality vacillates between decent, acceptable, and unforgivably hazy. Some scenes look like a badly compressed JPEG image, and others look as though someone had just breathed on the lens (not a problem in my old VHS release, which still manages to look better than this DVD). The special features are nice, especially the interviews with Richard Attenborough, but then again, I didn't buy A Bridge Too Far for the special features, did I?<br /><br />Still waiting, patiently, for a better transfer.
B000FQJAIW|1.0|If you are mainly buying this release for the original versions, please be aware that they do not use the full resolution of the dvd format.  They are merely copies of the Laser Discs from the early 1990's, and are not \\"enhanced for widescreen TV's\\".  Buyer beware!
B000021Y77|5.0|This is a great, fast-paced movie. I was initially skeptical of watching the same 20 minutes depicted three different ways, but this movie won me over from the beginning. Run Lola Run has style and energy, and I really did have a blast watching it.<br /><br />The music, the photography, the editing--everything contributes toward a very fast film experience. After watching it I felt like I needed to do everything as quickly as possible. Loads of fun.<br /><br />One of the great things about it is that it stands up very well to repeat viewing--watching it the second time was just as rewarding, possibly even more so, as the first. The interconnection of all the events in the film is much more clear the second time around (though not being as clear the first time doesn't hurt the film in the least).<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|I knew I had to have it as soon as it was announced. Mr Knoffler is a master of the guitar, and Emmylou is a legend of a vocalist. I've listened to it several times now, and their voices blend so well it's like hand and glove. This CD just always lifts my spirits. \\"All The Roadrunning,\\" \\"Right Now,\\" \\"This Is Us\\" and \\"Belle star\\" are the stand outs for me, but all the tracks are wonderful. I think you should give it a try.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|Once again Pearl Jam puts out another great album. My favorites of this album are Life Wasted, World Wide Suicide, Comatose, Severed Hand, Marker in the Sand, Parachutes, Unemployable, Big Wave, Gone, Wasted Reprise, Army Reserve, Come Back and Inside Job.
0425152251|5.0|I first read Sophies world when I was in college in 1998.  I think is the only book that I have read over and over again, and still enjoy the wisdom of its pages.  Even though its a book about the history of philosophy, I view the book as the history of my life, and yours too.  Every time I feel I am becoming enslaved into the dreadful power of habit, I read Sophies World to escape to freedom and awe.
6304698526|5.0|This is undoubtedly the tightest, best-directed, best acted \\"quiet anti-hero detective with a hot '68 fastback Mustang\\" ever filmed. Though there any number of great details to enjoy in this film (not the least of which is Jacqueline Bisset as a very glamorous architect)--check out McQueen's silky smooth double-clutching during the famous chase sequence, and Robert Duval as the balding taxi hack who takes McQueen over the same route the bad guy took--this film's finest moments are the chase, of course and the powerful dialog-free ending.<br /><br />The chase, if you know even a bit about San Francisco geography, is a physically impossible route, cutting from central S.F. to the Marina, etc., but it works brilliantly as cinema.  The soundtrack of most films in 1968 would be jarringly outdated to today's viewers, but by using a semi-cool jazz theme, the film retains a certain auditory timelessness.<br /><br />The closing sequence of this film just isn't a good cop movie ending, or a good Steve McQueen movie ending or a good 60s film ending--it is great film-making, period. It is very quiet and not at all the cliched gloating that is de rigeur in the genre. No dialog, no music, just McQueen returning home dog-tired in the early morning--a masterful ending which captures the essence of the character, the violence of his profession, and his relationship with Bisset.
B000003TA4|5.0|For some reason, it seems like for the last while it has become more and more trendy and hip to discredit this album. I, for one, will not sit by idly and let it happen without voicing my opinion.    To begin with, the most overused and only somewhat valid complaint about Nirvana, and this album in particular, is that they weren't the originators. They completely ripped off the Pixies. Ok sure. Kurt admitted he stole a few chords from the Pixies. Big deal. Does anyone have any clue as to how many songs use the same chords? Especially in rock, where power chords are commonly used. People must realize that chord progressions aren't what makes a rock group unique, or groundbreaking. The Pixies may have been one Kurt's many, many influences, but not nearly to the extent that Nirvana was just ripping them off. This argument has become a popular \\"look at me I'm cool and smart because I know music history better than you\\" mantra of the Nevermind antagonists, but is a tired and pointless way to dismiss Nevermind.    Secondly, those who don't think this album is special either A) weren't alive in 1991-92, or B) have completely lost their memory. Dare I say no other album in history has changed the music industry the way Nevermind did. It captured the general feelings of apathy and cynicism that permeated society at the time. During a time where radio was dominated by polished, fake, and contrived \\"artists,\\" Nevermind was the thing we automatically attached to because THAT was the way we felt. Nobody could relate to Poison or Michael Jackson.    Third, a lot of people think of Kurt as a selfish, heartless maniac. This perception is entirely baseless and naive. He absolutely hated his popularity. He wasn't after fame, or riches, or any of the things that many existing bands were/are after. The people he admired were people like Daniel Johnston and Calvin Johnson, truly sincere and unassuming people. And the judgmental people who write off his suicide as cowardly and selfish obviously have little experience or knowledge about mental conditions that are very real and can rarely be blamed on the person. How dare you think you'd respond any better than he if you were in his shoes...you never knew him well enough to know such things anyway. You people must be invincible. Congratulations for achieving perfection.    This album has a place in me that no other music holds.    Too bad many of you have forgotten, or never experienced, the true emotions behind this truly landmark album.    Oh well, whatever, Nevermind.
B000FQJAIW|1.0|I for one love the Star Wars films.  No one can deny that they were definitely ahead of their time.  In 1977, when the first film was released theatrically, movie-goers were treated to what could only be described back then as pure magic on the silver screen. <br /> <br />Like others, I was ecstatic about finally owning the ORIGINAL trilogy on DVD, the way these films were shown in theaters in '77, '80, & '83.  Sure, George Lucas re-tooled the films in 1997 for the theatrical re-release, and even moreso in 2004 for the DVD release, but let's face facts.  The ORIGINAL films are what made Lucas the bulk of his riches. <br /> <br />So why on earth is he releasing these films without anamorphic enhancement?  As many have stated, it's 2006, and non-anamorphic transfers have become a thing of the past.  Releasing a film anamorphically IS the norm for DVD in this day and age, so again, I ask WHY? <br /> <br />Furthermore, Lucasfilm is touting the ORIGINAL films as no more than BONUS MATERIAL.  To me, and many others, this is a huge slap in the face.  Sure, Lucas feels that the re-tooled CGI laden versions are the definitive films, and as the director, he is certainly entitled to that opinion.  But let's face facts.  It wasn't the special editions that people clamored to see over and over again in the theaters.  It wasn't the special editions whcih earned Lucas & Co. the big bucks.  Furthermore, it wasn't the special editions that were nominated for various Academy Awards.  The films we saw in the late 70's and early 80's WERE and ARE the films that many of us remember so fondly.  To sell these films as simple bonus material is downright ungrateful to the millions of fans who grew up loving these films the way there were shown ORIGINALLY. <br /> <br />But if I must, I can look past the fact that this is bonus material.  However, I can't look past the fact that these films will not be enhanced for 16x9 sets.  That's just uncalled for. <br /> <br />Let me put this in the simplest of terms.  Many people nowadays own widescreen television sets.  Watching an ANAMORPHICALLY ENHANCED widescreen DVD on a widescreen set means that all (or most of the image will fill that screen.  In the case of the Star Wars films, small black bars will be seen at the top and bottom of the set, only because the film was shot wider than the TV itself. <br /> <br />Now, to watch these films with NON-ANAMORPHIC enhancement, approximately 2/3 of your screen will be black bars.  Of course, these TV's have a ZOOM function which will zoom in the image, but be prepared for an even worse image than you expected.   <br /> <br />See, this is what Lucas thinks of his fans.  He's simply throwing them a bone by porting over the LaserDisc editions which were produced 13 years ago.  No cleanup, no anamorphic enhancement........nothing.  George Lucas, the same man behind THX and the highest possible standard for audio and visual presentation, can't even adhere to today's standard procedure for producing DVDs, and that's making these films ANAMORPHIC.   <br /> <br />I emplor you, please don't buy these films in this current state.  You'll only be proving to Lucas that he was right; that people will buy it regardless of its condition.  We fans deserve better than this.  These films are groundbreaking in every possible way, and as such, should be treated better than this.
B000062XE1|2.0|I am a fan of Oscar Wilde and of BBC productions, but to make Wilde's plays and stories boring takes either special effort, or decided lack of effort.  I've bought this dvd but it's unlikely I'll ever watch it again.    The stagy and low-budget sets are to be expected from older BBC tv productions; the costumes are very nice. Sound and picture qualities are excellent.  The actors are mostly very good especially  Susan Hampshire and Jeremy Brett in \\"Ideal Husband\\", who each provide provide sorely-needed beauty,youth, and especially, energy. (The overaged Mrs Cheavely acts well, but is miscast).  But the pacing and direction of each production is so dull, that I found myself just wanting these to end quickly.  The \\"Earnest\\" is so slow and boring as to be the most unwatchable of the group, and that should be a criminal offense.
B00005JMR5|5.0|In this day and age of movies being released on home video within 6 months of the theatrical release, how could this movie NOT be on dvd?? <br />Somebody really needs a reality check and realize that VHS is just about dead and unless someone releases this on dvd, the movie might as well be dead too.
B000EULJLU|5.0|This album took some getting used to but I wasn't about to log on after only 2 listens and trash the album like so many others. Some of the criticisms are valid...they do repeat themselves by lifting riffs from 3rd Eye and H in \\"Rosetta Stoned\\".  The 3rd Eye riff is especially noticeable. But even this isn't unique to this album. They've borrowed from their own catalogue before. Tool has maintained a pretty consistent sound throughout most of their albums while still managing to keep the material fresh...which is not easy to do.  Guitarwise, most Tool songs are just variations of similar riffs, and I think the unbelievable drumming of Danny Carey is what keeps things varied and interesting.  But as usual, Tool do try some new things here. The 2 part title track is suprisingly mellow throughout most of the entire composition. The song may bore some, but I found it to be a pretty moving piece that grew on me with repeated listens. As usual, you have to listen closely for some really subtle things, and the listener will be rewarded accordingly. (By the way, while I said mellow, nothing on this album is even close to being the dreaded power ballad. The material is as experimental and unconventional as ever) <br /> <br />I'm not sure its better than Lateralus...yet. But I still can't believe a lot of these reviews, where people say \\"I didn't like Lateralus for about 3 months but then it sunk in and then I loved it.  I listened to 10,00 days twice and I still hate it !\\"   Well, duh.  If the last album took so long to grow on you then why would you expect this one to be any different? <br />
B0009QTS1M|5.0|Incorporated into this version from the original 155 min movie?<br /><br />GLADIATOR is my absolute favorite movie of all time up to this point.  As much as I watch television, I never saw any advertisements for this new DVD version.  Actually, I didn't even buy the DVD until 2004, since I expected that an extended version would one day be released.  However, if it is the deleted scenes incorporated into the film it would definitely make the continuity much more engrossing as they do add more depth to the main characters.
B000B8QEZG|3.0|Disco is dead for a reason so why on earth did she feel the need to resurrect it?!? Not one of Madonna's best albums, but it's getting a lot of hype right now.

B0009R1T7M|2.0|I get it, damn it! Lyrics that use common sense as revelatory pronouncements, under psuedo-spiritual guises that reference \\"the soul\\"...how deep. I MUST listen to it then, shouldn't I?  No.  Without a doubt, this ranks as one of the most pretentious albums released in recent memory. I've tried and Tried and TRIED to give this album a go. Listened to it at night, at day, in the morning, in the evening, alone, with friends, in bed, whatever...and EVERY. SINGLE. TIME I find myself thinking \\"What am I listening to this for?\\"  Just because it's \\"not commerical\\" or \\"goes against the grain\\" doesn't mean anything. So the guy has some artistic integrity. Good. That should be the lowest common denominator for anyone who expects others to put down money for their work. Move on! Get to the songs!  Yes, there are some decent arrangements in there, and a couple of the chord changes grab your attention...but otherwise...ugh.  I don't need to get into this for it's \\"ironic hipster appeal\\". At the end of the day, it's a guy run amok in a studio, and the tunes just aren't that good. Damn...
B00005JOVH|5.0|On the whole, X-Men 3: The Last Stand fulfilled my expectations but it was not without some fairly significant problems which I'll mention here before moving on to what did work...<br /><br />The first and biggest problem is that the score by composer John Powell is ABSOLUTELY HORRENDOUS.  In no way, whatsoever, does it tie into the EXCELLENT Michael Kamen X1 score (Which was VERY SOLID!) nor the SOARING John Ottman X2 score (Which, like the movie it supports, is easily the best of the three!) which had some degree of overlap and drew from the same core melodic well.  This new soundtrack makes no sense thematically, is not appealing in the slightest, and basically takes the audience hostage every time it rears it's ugly head because in addition to totally sucking it also is just TOO BIG for the film.  Additionally, even when the acting and story are synchronized, which is most of the time, the music actually desynchronizes the audience from what's happening.<br /><br />They also managed to TOTALLY screw-up the sequencing of the opening credits so they don't look great and are in the wrong order which makes for yet another distraction.  IT IS SUPPOSED TO GO LIKE THIS: 1) opening credits, then 2) through the security scanning eye of Cerebro, and then 3) to the flashback, and then 4) move forward to the present.  It's a small but glaring detail that fans will notice.  Try and imagine Star Wars without the Lucasfilm Insignia, the \\"a long time ago in a galaxy far, far, away...\\" thing,  and the episode's opening crawl?  It matters!<br /><br />The second problem is the pacing.  The film moves much too fast and it's isn't nearly long enough.  The acting and story are good but they are trying to do WAAAY too much in WAAAY too little time and the film seems to lack the more quiet and contemplative moments which defined the first two films between bursts of action.  It's not impossible to work with but it is rather \\"jarring\\" to behold: an X-Men Movie strung-out on crack and that is stuck pedal-to-the-medal on Fast-Forward!<br /><br />The third problem is some story/acting/applied super-power inconsistencies.<br /><br />It was perfectly obvious (at the end of X2) that Xavier was aware that Jean had faked her death in order go solo for a while and to pursue the development of her powers to their full-potential without the distraction of her dual-attraction to Scott/Logan and without Xavier keeping her reined-in.  He gives a solid (if fairly lame-ass) explanation for how Jean might have survived and -- though it is an explanation that film fans and fans of the comics will laugh with and enjoy -- it doesn't seamlessly interlock with the first two movies as well as it could/should nor does it make a lot of sense continuity-wise when it's perfectly obvious that Xavier KNEW that Jean had survived.<br /><br />The most glaring (And VERY surprising!) inconsistency is how they portrayed Storm's power-of-flight in this movie.  Though the X-Men franchise has always been very good at stretching the boundaries of what is possible it has also been a franchise that obeys the laws of physics with reasonable levels of believability.  Storm's ability to fly upon the winds that she summons requires those winds to be of tremendous speed/lift/suction (Which is why she's called the Windrider!) and she doesn't just glide around like a weightless leaf as they showcase her doing in this movie.  Phoenix and Magneto can do that because their powers directly affect/override gravitational forces but Storm has no such ability and if they are going to have Storm fly they might try and make it more convincing because it would take a hell-of-a-lot more quickly moving air to keep Halle Berry's ass in the air than the pseudo-zero-gravity effect they used.  Also disturbing is the complete lack of The Phoenix Fire/Firebird Effect which was teasingly used and alluded to at the end of X2 when Jean lifts the jet while holding back the wall of water -- one of the greatest reinterpretations of a seminal event in comic book history.  Whether she was Balanced Healthy Phoenix or Dark Phoenix, The Phoenix Effect was ALWAYS on hand when Jean amped-up her powers.  It's UNBELIEVABLE that they wouldn't include it!<br /><br />Those problems aside, there are many things that were done VERY WELL...<br /><br />The Neutralizer Storyline + The Legacy Virus Storyline = The Synthesized Cure Storyline was an excellent instinctual choice and it works beautifully and with a minimum amount of set-up.<br /><br />Pretty much all the kids from the school that appeared in the previous two movies have returned giving it a very nice Harry Potter-like multi-generational consistency.  They were some nice casual moments like when Colossus is carrying a TV around the hallway which audiences are going to go wild over.  The NEW Kitty Pryde ABSOLUTELY ROCKS -- and it's a real shame that we didn't have her aboard sooner -- and all of the adult X-Men look and behave like they should.  Kelsey Grammer was an INSPIRED choice to play Beast and bringing-in Olivia Williams aboard to play Moira MacTaggert was also a very smart move even though she's a little bit too young for the part.<br /><br />The Dark Phoenix storyline was something of a let down because we didn't get to see the healthy side and miraculous application of Jean's Phoenix-enhanced powers first.  Going straight to Dark Phoenix may have been necessary but it watered things dows a bit since the Phoenix Saga had both ups and downs to it.  Beyond that, the final resolution is depressing though since Jean is Phoenix a resurrection is easily possible provided there are more films and the studio can bring Famke Janssen back to play Jean again.<br /><br />The film's ending is a mystery AND THERE IS A SCENE AT THE END OF THE CREDITS THAT YOU HAVE TO STAY FOR which leaves the door wide-open for a sequel and also raises some questions about what actually transpired during the psychic battle between Xavier and Phoenix.<br /><br />The love story between Jean/Logan/Scott is very nicely resolved and Jean & Logan FINALLY get the credit they deserve for being the hotter and more interesting of the two relationships.  When I was younger, I preferred Jean & Scott, until I grew-up, and realized that you need humor, passion, fun, and sexual attraction to have a healthy relationship and realized that Jean & Logan had always been the better pairing.  Jackman and Janssen's chemistry on-screen also made it difficult to buy a Jean & Cylops pairing since they had no heat.<br /><br />Fans will also delight in the battle sequences, the insults, the humor, and the distinctive characterizations.<br /><br />The movie could and should have been longer and better, but, it's done a good job of capping-off this first trilogy and it leaves the door open in a non-pressured/non-anvillicious way for future movies.ory.

The movie could and should have been longer and better, but, it's done a good job of capping-off this first trilogy and it leaves the door open in a non-pressured/non-anvillicious way for future movies.
0385504209|1.0|Dan Brown could've just wrote a regular murder mystery, and he might've got some good money from it. But that's not exactly what he did. Insted, he writes a book that totally assaults the Christian faith. I'm not a total Jesus freak, but I go to church, and I know my religion. About all of these so called, \\"facts\\" about christianity are completely false. Jesus never got married. There were no gospels telling that Jesus was just mortal. Constantine had nothing to do with the structure of the Bible. The book says that these \\"lost gospels\\" were burned by the Catholic Church, and that Constantine the Great assembled the gospels we know today. It also says that some of the \\"lost gospels\\" survived and were part of a collection of lost scrolls called the Deep Sea Scrolls, which were discovered in the 1940's.<br /><br />In reality, there accually IS a collection of lost scrolls found in the 40's called the Deep Sea Scrolls. But those scrolls don't even mention the name Jesus Christ, let alone being a lost gospel.<br /><br />Many church leaders have looked over many separate hand written Bible manuscripts, and they are completley the same, even word for word, to our Bible today. There are only 11 verses that were strangely added to today's Bible, and none of those even give a hint at suggesting anything that Dan Brown says in this book.<br /><br />All these lies show that Dan Brown has either never looked into the acual facts, is completely ignorant to the acual facts, or is totally against the acual facts. Millions have already been fooled by this catastrophe. But you can save your faith if your a christian, by not reading this book or seeing the movie.
B000FQJAIW|1.0|1) You've already bought this movie several times, and probably have the 2004 DVD editions. You are being forced to buy the 2004 edition AGAIN just to buy the original theatrical version. <br /> <br />and <br /> <br />2) This DVD will not be enhanced for widescreen TVs which means if you have a widescreen TV you will have black bars around ALL FOUR SIDES of the screen. Even if you don't have a widescreen TV, the picture quality will be very poor, transfered from a 1993 release. <br /> <br />Do not buy this title.
0066620996|5.0|Before I read this book, I would often allow myself to make compromises. I would say to myself, \\"I'm so busy... this is so hard... I will just accept what is coming to me and make the most of it.\\" Now, I am determined to accept nothing but the best, and to be quick and decisive as I lead my company to success. My ability to focus, set goals, and lead my team to victory has improved dramatically after reading \\"Good to Great\\".<br /><br />This book attempts to inspire readers to become the best they can be - whether they are leading a start-up, coaching a soccer team, or teaching first-graders how to read. One of my favorite aspects of the book is the number of eye-opening and encouraging stories that Collins includes. He and his team have combed through tons of materials and distilled a world of business information into several kernals that will help you the most.<br /><br />After reading this, I bought copies for each of my staff and I have already seen the positive effects. If you feel that you are doing good but would like to do better, I can tell you from personal experience that these techniques work!
B00005JKES|5.0|First off, it must be said that Twin Peaks is one of the most amazing shows ever created for television.  It is moody, atmospheric, and well written.  It challenges the viewer at every turn and takes chances in a way that precious few shows ever have. <br /> <br />Written by David Lynch, who is best known for making quirky arthouse films, Twin Peaks is on its surface about the murder of a teenager named Laura Palmer.  But, in reality, the show is more about character development and personal relationships in a town where nothing is as it seems. <br /> <br />The DVD set is well worth the investment.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|By the end of the week I predict I'll be saying this is one of the best albums ever.  I'm planning a short trip from LA to San Diego this weekend and I plan to play the double CD Stadium Arcadium on the trip down...repeatedly.  I've already been playing it in my car...most frequently.  When I arrive, I just want to keep listening, don't want to get out of the car.  Then when I get back in the car and start listening again, I think, oh yeah this CD's pretty damn good.  It just flows nicely. It reminds you why you like music in the first place.  The Chili Peppers are rock, they're funk, they're very California-y. Ahh...they make me proud to be an Angelino. With this album they give their props to musicians that came before them; Tom Petty, James Brown...dare I say the Mamas and the Papas with that great harmony that's going on from time to time. Why wait 'till the end of the week, this is one of the best albums ever!

B000FQJAIW|1.0|...there was a director who pioneered the \\"space opera\\" and revolutionized the way we see and hear films. In addition to these cinematic advances, he once claimed he was \\"...very concerned about our national heritage, and I am very concerned that the films that I watched when I was young and the films that I watched throughout my life are preserved, so that my children can see them.\\"<br /><br />Yet, he messes with the OT and decides to release these \\"fun\\" versions as almost an FU to the fans of the OT. \\"See? You wanted 'em, you got 'em. But, you're going to get 'em MY WAY\\".<br /><br />Thanks, but no thanks.<br /><br />I've seen fans that hold your TRILOGY with more reverence than you do.
B00005RRG9|5.0|Although the story has been remade several time (once quite successfully) I still find the original to be the best.  Two young girls meet at camp and immediately take a disliking to one another.  As pranks escalate between them they are finally punished by being forced to share a cabin together.  It is then that they discover they are identical twin sisters separated long ago.  Now their talent for pranks is turned against their parents as they decide to switch places with one another.  This way they can meet their other parent and then reveal the deception and force mother and father to meet again. <br /> <br />No sooner is the switch enacted than trouble is brewing.  The father seems bent on marrying again.  The deception is revealed and the two groups come together.  But there is still the matter of the father's girlfriend to deal with.  She is a gold digger with no redeeming qualities and she becomes the target of the twins' talent for pranks.  Of course all works out in the end and everyone is happy (well, almost everyone). <br /> <br />A strong cast combined with new technology allowing Hayley Mills to interact with herself make a very firm foundation for this tale.  There are plenty of extras packed on the second disk while the feature offers the opportunity to start with the Donald Duck cartoon that originally preceded the film in theaters.  All in all a very fun film for all ages.
044651652X|1.0|Good Eastwood-Streep movie, but terrible book. The plot itself is fine, but the manner in which the book is written is amateurish and just plain sappy. Skip the book and watch the movie. If you want to read a well-written love story that doesn't insult your intelligence, then may I suggest Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice? Now that's good writing and an entertaining yarn to boot!
B000AU9UYM|5.0|One thing movie makers are starting to learn is that you can start a series anywhere in the timeline of the story, and then go back and fill it in.  In the late '70s, it was a gamble for George Lucas.  Now it is priven fact, and a true monument to his genius and creativity.  This film is another example, and with a cast to match!<br /><br />I loved the casting of this movie.  Christian Bale outperforms the Cloonies and others who have tried to portray the most entertaiing action hero - Batman, and his second Bruce Wayne.  He restored the character to my most favorite potrayal by Micheal Keaton (who will always be \\"Batman\\").  He even looks somewhat like him, which adds to the prequel format of the film.<br /><br />The plot is wonderfully written, and is a trbute to the writers, producers, and directors, who put in the time to make it a spectacular story that will be watched and enjoyed over and over, which makes it a wonderful value in the world of movies.<br /><br />A great film for any collection.  What more can I say!
B000FQJAIW|1.0|Obviously I haven't seen the actual DVDs yet, since they won't be released until September, but I *have* seen the transfer  that will make up the \\"bonus feature\\" on disc 2, the original 1977 version of \\"Star Wars\\" (as it was then known.)  I own the 1993 laserdisc.  That was \\"state-of-the-art\\" THIRTEEN YEARS AGO, but the state of the art has moved on considerably since then.  The transfer will look like trash on DVD, especially blown-up on a widescreen TV.  (Among other things the translation subtitles for the alien languages will be cut-off, since Lucasfilm and Fox decided to put electronic versions in the letterboxing bars rather than use a print with the subtitles burned into the film or at least have the electronic ones placed over the frame where they belong.)   <br /> <br />Even if you don't have a widescreen television, you should always insist that any DVD you buy today be \\"enhanced for widescreen TVs\\" or \\"enhanced for 16:9 displays\\".  Why?  1)  Chances are your next TV will be a widescreen HD set.  2)  An DVD enhanced for widescreen TVs can only be created from a very high-quality digital video master.  That means the studio can't just slap an existing laserdisc or VHS master created an old print years ago onto a DVD (which is what Lucasfilm is doing here.)  Instead they have to go back to the source material, and *create* a new hi-def digital master in cases where none existed before.  That produces a better looking and sounding result on both standard screens and wide screens.   <br /> <br />If you are thinking about buying this disc primarily to get a true high-quality DVD edition of the 1977 film, as I was, save your money.  I already own the Special Edition on DVD and the 1993 laserdisc.  I would have cheerfully bought this new release if it had included a newly remastered, enhanced-for-widescreen edition of \\"Star Wars\\".  But I'm not paying twice for material identical to what I already have.   <br /> <br />Perhaps if enough people ignore this release Lucasfilm will spend the money necessary to do a *proper* release of the film - which contrary to their claims is certainly possible with the use of the latest film restoration techniques and with source material that survives in the hands of private collectors.  I can't imagine that they will have any trouble making their money back, since I, for one, have bought about six different editions of these movies on home video.  But I won't buy this one.   <br /> <br />Quite apart from anything else, the three original \\"Star Wars\\" films, especially this one, are a part of film history.  They changed the industry, they changed the expectations of the audience.  But it was the film released in 1977 that did all that, not the revised, improved and prettied-up version released in theaters many years later.  The original film should always be preserved and made available *as it was* in the best format available for today's audiences and for future generations.  No one can judge the impact the film had by watching the 2nd re-edit of the film done 27 years after the fact. <br /> <br />Vote with your wallets.  Vote \\"no\\" to a grudging and insulting release.  Vote \\"yes\\" for a future release done right.  Do *not* pre-order this nonsense.  It may not be too late to change some minds at Lucasfilm.   <br /> <br />
B000E41MS6|5.0|I grew up watching DR Who... From Jon Pertwee on I was a fan, I even liked that Americanist Fox TV movie with Paul McGann (as the Doctor) and Eric Roberts (as the Master)<br /><br />After watching Christopher Eccleston's portrayal of the Doctor and Billie Piper as Rose Tyler, I was won over. Rusell Davies reinvention of the British classic with a nod to the original and moving it forward. The Doctor never seem better.<br /><br />This 13 episodes on five discs is great. the extra are special. This Doctor is back-the hour long episodes make for an interesting transition to the new era.<br /><br />Bennet Pomerantz, audioworld
1400034779|5.0|A truly delightful book and character. You will love to meet Mme Precious Ramotswe and hear her bits of daily wisdom as she experiences her ordinary yet extraordinary daily life. Do not come to this series expecting some great thiriller or mystery, they are more about the rich texture of lives of a different culture that you are thrilled by the pure simplicity and richness of it all. Think of eating a well made milk custard;..simple, yet rich.
1582403589|5.0|I've been a zombie fan since I first saw Night of the Living Dead. I love reading books about zombies, and when I heard about The Walking Dead series, I had to find out more. I was able to read the first 25 pages online. I was hooked. I got Volume 1 and read it non stop. The story was Great, and the art work even better. Can't wait to read the volumes 2-5!
B0001BS4Q0|4.0|I must have heard this album in that very book store where the other reviewer (the one who hated the album) works. :-)  I was not really there to listen to music, but in half an hour that I was there, I caught myself liking what I was hearing at least 2 or 3 times.  This doesn't happen very often, so I asked what the album was and listened to it on Napster when I got home.  I must admit I didn't purchase the whole album.  In fact, the only tracks I did end up purchasing are the ones that noone seems to mention - Don't bring me down, The Church of What's happening now, Natale's song, Where I belong.   <br />I must agree that she doesn't articulate at all and lyrics ARE very hard to understand most of the time.  But hey - how can you get annoyed by lyrics if you can't understand them, right?  :-)  I'm still planning on listening to the songs while looking at lyrics in the nearest future, in the meantime, I can't really criticize or embrace them.  However, I find her melodies to be absolutely gorgeous and mesmerizing, the best I've heard in a long while, and to me that often matters more than highly philosophical lyrics (and how often do we see those, anyway - from what I can understand of her lyrics, they aren't any less or more pretentious than 90% of what we hear on the radio these days?). <br />I also don't find anything annoying about her voice (her lack of articulation aside - but that seems to be the trend for a long of singers these days).  I think it works very well to create a mood.   <br />Wouldn't buy the album for $20 or so at the store simply because I don't find all tracks equally appealing (thus, the 4 stars), but those that I like, I definitely like a lot and enjoy listening to often.
006056251X|4.0|I read this book from cover to cover within one day.  I was just sorry that Kleypas turned him into a politically correct sniveling whipped jelly of a man!  My gosh..when Evie told him that he would have to be celibate I actually WANTED him to go out and have an affair or at least goad her.   <br />In the last book, he was so strong and actually said the longest he had ever went without sex was one week, how the heck does he turn into this whipped man within a day??!!  I wanted him to be a little more resistent to Evie and I would have liked to read more about her family.  <br /> <br />Therefore, this book gets four stars instead of five because while the love scenes were hot...there were not enough (only because St. Vincent is supposed to be sensual) and also because I would have loved a little more character development.  It just felt a little to rushed...like Kleypas was in a hurry to write this on a deadline or was only allowed to write the book at a certain length.
B000EGCIU0|4.0|Well, I'm not really a Pink fan, my wife likes her and that's why we bought the CD but I gotta say this CD is really good. Pink has a great voice and the bonus track with her dad is wonderful. However, my wife put the CD in our 5 CD Changer in slot number 1 and it played it just fine, so we went to take it out to watch the DVD footage and the CD got stuck! I decided to take the screws off and see if I could get the CD out, well apparently Phillips didn't want me to do that because they used these stupid screws that no one in the world would have a screwdriver to fit (except maybe them of course). So I pull it down off my entertainment center and decided to fool with it in the other room. I turned it in different directions and kept pressing \\"open\\" to see if it would dislodge it and open the CD tray so I could take it out...finally in a miracle the CD tray opened and I got it out! All I have to say is that if you buy this DO NOT PUT IT IN A SHELF DISC CHANGER! The thickness is too great and it WILL get stuck!
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Green Day made their most important album, 2004's American Idiot, 15 years after forming their band. 2006 is the year for the Red Hot Chili Peppers to do the same thing.  <br /> <br />Stadium Arcadium is a solid 2-disc 28-track album featuring the Peppers at a more focused and much more mellowed out form than their previous albums, while maintaining their funk along the way (just listen to Hump De Bump for proof). Lead vocalist Anthony Keidas's signature singing style, Chad's precise drumming, and Flea's funky bass playing can't quite keep up with the energy that guitarist John Frusciante brings to the California quartet's groovy sound formula (If you thought that John's ethereal guitar licks on Scar Tissue were out of this world like I did, then there's plenty to be mesmerized by and discovered on Arcadium). In a nutshell, Stadium Arcadium is extremely infectious, and is destined to be the biggest rock album of the year.  <br /> <br />The album's first single, and album opener, Dani California is by far the best rock single released so far this year. The track follows up on Dani, a character referenced in 1999's Californication and mentioned in 2002's By The Way; the song also triggered a memorable music video featuring the band impersonating The Beatles and Nirvana amongst others. As a group, the Peppers deliver some of their best tunes to date using the same ingredients they've used before, mixing funk, punk, alternative rock, and Beatlesque harmonies: the groovy ballad Snow (Hey Oh) and C'mon Girl, the even groovier Charlie, the mellow future single Stadium Arcadium, the elusive Lenny Kravitz style rocker She's Only 18, the 70's style rocker Strip My Mind, the surreal Especially In Michigan, the acoustic Slow Cheetah, the bass driven Torture Me, the cool rockers Warlocks, Storm In A Teacup, She Looks To Me, Make You Feel Better, and Desecration Smile, the radio friendly Tell Me Baby, and, one of my personal favorites, what could possibly be the strongest balladthe Peppers have ever written Hard To Concentrate.  <br /> <br />16 years have passed since the band made their first mark in the mainstream. With the release of Stadium Arcadium, it seems that the Chili Peppers are just now getting hotter!  <br /> <br />Track Picks:  <br /> <br />Dani California  <br />Snow (Hey Oh)  <br />Charlie  <br />Stadium Arcadium  <br />She's Only 18  <br />Slow Cheetah <br />Strip My Mind <br />Especially In Michigan  <br />Desecration Smile  <br />Tell Me Baby  <br />Hard To Concentrate  <br />Make You Feel Better  <br />Storm In A Teacup
B00000264F|5.0|I'm very pleased about discovering Europe. <br />This album is pure metal and outstanding, even better than the Final Countdown,their most famous. Energy-full. <br />The typical metal here is more evident. The keyboard usage by Joey Tempest is minimum in comparison to the succeeding blockbuster. His vocals are more disjointed. <br />The drums here are tuned differently too. <br />This cd has the original version of open your heart ( the newer found in out of this world 1988), the guitar solo is different. <br />Actually,I prefer the remake because it's more enriched. <br />Now I can see why Don Dokken chose John Norum to replace George Lyinch  in his group for a while : his guitaring here, which is worth the price of the cd, is magnificent specially <br />in tracks 7 ( 2:28 what the heck???? ), <br />4 ( almost entire song,lick abuse , his fingers don't stand still , the atmosphere here has some rage); <br />5 ( instrumental masterpiece, some finger tapping to produce a \\"olun-lun-lun-lun\\"-like sound ); <br />10 ( he sounded like the master Van Halen,check in 2:11 or 2:20) <br />and 6. <br />Most catchy songs : 3 , 1 ,8 and 6.  <br />Dreamer is the one I like less , but not bad. <br />In scream of anger the guitar, with the help of a pedal, had a different muffle,interesting. The band likes playing it alive. <br /> <br />This album isn't very easy to find, but you can try to download if it's impossible. It's worthwhile.
0380715430|4.0|This is a lighthearted look at the intricacies of the English language: its history and development as well as colloquialisms, modern slang, and general language-mangling by non-native speakers.<br /><br />It's not a reference book, but a playful examination of one of the most intricate languages on earth. If you're more fond of pedantic linguistic analysis (as many previous reviewers seem to be), it's best to look elsewhere. If, however, you have a good sense of humour and are up to a fun read, definitely check this out.
B000EGCITG|5.0|Pink doesn't disappoint on this 14-track album I'm Not Dead.  She's not dead.  If anything, she's just getting started!  \\"Stupid Girls\\" starts this album with a kick ass attitude, and lyrics that are so true.  \\"Dear Mr. President\\" is about Pink talking to the president one on one, asking him if he's happy with the choices he makes.  Really powerful stuff.  Other good songs are \\"Leave Me Alone (I'm Lonely)\\", \\"U + Ur Hand\\", and `Cuz I Can.  There is also a hidden track, with Pink and her dad singing \\"I Have Seen The Rain\\", which is another good song.
B000ETQRCM|2.0|I love Pearl Jam.  They're songwriting skills and emotion made them great in the 90's and early 00's.  Unfortunately, I'm very disappointed with this album.  It has terrible sound quality, like it was recorded in someone's garage.  The voice, drums, bass, guitars, all sound distorted like they're overdriving the microphones, so it's hard to listen to.  The other reviews indicate Pearl Jam is back in form and compare this to Ten.  I don't know what album they were listening to. <br />   <br />Maybe that same Pearl Jam I loved still exists but you wouldn't know it from this recording.  On a side-note, what the heck is going on with the artwork?  It's full of mutilated body parts and grotesque images.
B000F0UV0E|4.0|It must be a pretty good CD, because I'm the first one to suggest that the title track, All the Roadrunning, is its highlight.  We'll have to listen again, because after six listenings, we still had not picked up that \\"If this is goodbye\\" is a 9-11 track worth listening to many times.  Also enjoy \\"This is Us,\\"   In the end, I  agree with those reviewers who suspect this pair could produce a Six Star recording, and didn't.  Which is to say: not perfect, but a blessing to listen to, and yes, the Amazon reviewer is an outlier on this one, this one has legs.
B000FQJAIW|1.0|This could very easily be an ecstatic 5-star review. The original, unaltered Star Wars trilogy, finally on DVD with no droid & alien cartoon antics, no Hayden Christensen's face on Sebastian Shaw's body, no videogame-quality Jabba the Hutt, the original Academy Award-winning special effects, the music we remember... This should be a red-letter DVD release for Star Wars fans. Sadly, it is not.<br /><br />Here's why you should boycott this release:<br /><br />1. The picture & sound are intentionally presented in mediocre quality. These DVD's are transferred from the exact same videotape used to create the laserdisc release in 1993. That means a non-anamorphic, muddy, letterboxed picture that will have to be zoomed in to fill widescreen TVs or computer monitors. Lucasfilm refuses to fulfill the basic minimum standards of a current DVD release and make a new transfer. The quality of this DVD presentation will not live up to that of such timeless classics as Caddyshack II & Ishtar.<br /><br />2. It's overpriced. If Lucasfilm is only willing to toss out these beloved films in this shoddy version, and they are unwilling to spend any time or money at all on their release, that is their right. They should charge accordingly. As bootleg-quality laserdisc transfers, these DVD's should sell for $5-$10, tops. Incredibly, Lucasfilm is charging $90 retail for these three movies! That's almost twice the cost of the (still available) box set with the exact same Special Edition discs!<br /><br />They're trying to justify the cost by bundling the unaltered movies (the only reason to buy this version) with the Special Edition movies, but they must know it's a sham. Anybody who is willing to pay $90 ($60 @ Amazon) for the Special Edition DVD's has already bought the existing box sets. The Special Edition discs in this set are a complete waste of plastic, and they do not justify the outrageous cost.<br /><br />If, for some reason, you have not yet purchased Star Wars on DVD, this set may be an adequate value. For anyone else, this set plus the existing box set you already have will run you a total of $160 retail ($110 @ Amazon). Is that a fair price to pay for an intentionally mediocre release of the movie that made Lucas' empire possible? Is it right to release this classic piece of cinematic history with picture and sound quality far below the latest releases of Buckaroo Banzai or Barbarella? I'll leave that for you to decide.this set plus the existing box set you already have will run you a total of $160 retail ($110 @ Amazon).

B0002OERI0|1.0|If were 15, I'd probably like this album, then again, what's really frustrating is that, a band like at the drive-in never got the praise this band has. But whatever, just listen to the lyrics, plain bad... even with the catchy riffs, and the artificial pasting of them in jesus of suburbia don't save this album. <br />Then again taking it into context, only teenagers listen to this poor musical offer, but given the praise in the music media and pressing this gets only one star.
B0007ZEBIK|5.0|I've already reviewed the actual CD \\"Still Not Getting Any...\\" so I'll just talk about the bonus tracks/videos.<br /><br />The live tracks are amazing and so are the videos. Lots of bonus footage. :)<br /><br />My only complaint is that the VCD quality is not the best. So if you're expecting amazing video quality, you won't find it on this CD.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|People before me have gone into much more detail about the songs than I will. I am only writing this to say that if you once liked Vs and Vitalogy, you should get this album. I don't undestand why people have such a problem with PJ's experimentation phase, but in this case there is none of it, we have a short and sweet grunge rock album just like in the old days. The songs are well performed and the track list flows well: I wouldn't change anything. ..well except the cover artwork...
B0001MDP3G|5.0|Beanie huge fan of all of the three main actors, this ensemble and the writers and directors will everyone who worked on the film made this film a must-see event.  An incredible depiction placed in the Civil War this beautiful tale of love and war, friendship and agony, joy and loss captivate every one of your senses.<br /><br />The love story between Inman played by Jude Law and Ada played by Nicole Kidman is romantic, poetic and heart wrenching.  Showing what happens to each character separately serves this movie well.  The narration of the letterwriting brings you deeper into the story.  The ending will surprise you.
B00005JNDZ|5.0|The Edge of Reason is very amusing.  A sequel to Bridget Jones Diary, this movie is nearly as funny as the first.  Taking Rene Zellweger from TV reporter to the drudges of a Taiwanese jail, this movie is full of fun and frolic.  In a time when not only real-life events maybe a little too serious as well as the movies that are presented to us this is a fun departure from reality.  One of the funnest scenes is when Rene is in the Taiwanese jail and befriends the women who are in their.<br /><br />Another must-see movie both Mark Darcy played by Colin Firth and Daniel Cleaver played by Hugh Grant returned to this sequel to round out the movie.  While most sequels are disappointing this is one movie sequel that does not.  This movie had everyone laughing in the room male or female and talking about it afterwards.
B0002W4SWC|5.0|A surprisingly funny film.  Being a huge Rene Zellweger fan I had to see this film even though originally it was not appealing to me.  I was happily surprised by the performances of all three characters.  Unhappy with her life as it is Bridget Jones played by Rene Zellweger sets out to turn her life around and uses her diary to show us the way.<br /><br />Delightfully narrated by Zellweger her comedic portrayal of Bridget Jones leaves a lasting impression.  Hugh Grant is never better as he plays Bridget's creepy sex addicted boss.  The ending leaves you pleasantly surprised.  This is definitely a must watch movie.
0393316041|3.0|I'm in the camp that believes Feynman was a brilliant scientist but somewhat of a jerk.  His practical jokes, though perhaps brilliantly conceived, were often hurtful and arrogant.  His stories about his bar-hopping and womanizing lack credibility.  I'm not impressed that he knew how to play bongo drums -- who doesn't?  And then there are his \\"cultural\\" pursuits. I know other scientific types who look down on the arts and believe they are easy.  As a result, we get a lot of scientists who think they can write, compose or play music, do art, write poetry, etc., when, in fact, they are usually embarassingly terrible at those things.  Feynman is guilty of that; his prose is mundane and cliched.  Where was his editor?  On the other hand, I was very impressed by Feynman's passion for correct learning, that is, to make sure you UNDERSTAND something, not just rely on rote.  That's valuable.  Ditto for his belief that if a person does not live up to another person's expectations, it's the fault of the person who set the expectations too high, not the person who failed to meet them. I enjoyed the vignettes of other great thinkers. I appreciated his plea for total intellectual honesty in all endeavors. And although I think Feynman was a wiseacre, I have to admit that he had me laughing in a few places.  I believe Feynman was a great man -- perhaps more accurately, a great nerd.  I'm glad I read the book, but in its entirety, I would have to say it merits only three stars.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|As so many Firefly fans (Browncoats we proudly call ourselves), I too discovered this jewel of a verse after the series was cancelled. <br /> <br />At Dragon*Con 2005 there was a huge buzz about some cancelled show called Firefly and a movie called Serenity.  I went to the first panel and along with 3,000 others Q&A'd with the Cast and got to watch a preview of the movie.  I was hooked then and there. <br /> <br />Firefly is THE most unique, and I mean that in a great way, tv show to come to the small screen in many years.  All I can say that hasn't already been said, or maybe it has, is you owe it to yourself to buy this DVD set!  If you own no other, this is the one you need. <br /> <br />Watch the episodes, the way they were meant to be seen, many times.  Then buy the follow-up to the series, the movie Serenity. <br /> <br />In the mean time, \\"I'll be in my bunk!\\"
0385336691|5.0|This is Lee Child's tenth Jack Reacher novel. Reacher is the modern hero. Rootless. Anonymous. He has no roots, nothing. His luggage is the clothes on his back and a collapsible toothbrush. Trouble never fails to find Reacher. He doesn't look for it: it unerringly finds him.<br /><br />  This time, Reacher is in New York City, just sitting enjoying his coffee. He idly watches a man get into a car and drive away. The next evening, Reacher is once agin sitting in the same cafe when a man comes in, asks around and Reacher is pointed out. Trouble has once again find Reacher.<br /><br />  A man named Lane is worried: his wife and child are gone. Kidnapped. Lane lives in the legendary Dakota, where Yoko Ono lives. Lane has six ex-special force men with him, for Lane is a contractor, a man who rents out mercenaries.<br /><br />  Reacher becomes involved with the hunt for the kidnappers of Kate and Jade Lane. And as he runs down clues, he realizes that everything is not as it seems. That of course means still more trouble that only an intelligent, ruthless, brutal man like Jack Reacher can resolve.<br /><br />  Reacher has changed in this book. The violence isn't nearly as frequent as it has been in the earlier Reacher novels. Frankly, I miss that. Violence at the slightest provocation, always for a good purpose, is a hallmark of Jack Reacher.<br /><br />  There is a pretty substantial romantic interest in this novel as well, another rarity for Reacher.<br /><br />  As always, Lee Child's is the total master of his plot and his character. The characters all have substantial depth and the plot is wonderfully complex, but never muddied or vague. Child is just a great writer, pure and simple.<br /><br />  The climax on this one is a bit drawn out, but to good effect. The last couple of dozen pages rachet up the tension.<br /><br />  Child moves the plot along with a couple of interesting backstories.<br /><br />  For those who know Jack Reacher, this is another treat. If you don't know Reacher, but want to meet a man with no name, no roots, no possessions who wanders the world doing good through violent means, it's time to read this book.<br /><br />Jerryther treat. If you don't know Reacher, but want to meet a man with no name, no roots, no possessions who wanders the world doing good through violent means, it's time to read this book. <br /> <br />Jerry
1596003308|4.0|Lee Childs \\"Jack Reacher\\" books are my favorites, and I've read or listened to all of them.  This one, while not the best, is really good and keeps you involved with the characters.  Since I'm into audiobooks now, I especially am thankful that Dick Hill is narrating these Reacher books.
B000E8QVWY|5.0|I need to listen to more Johnny Cash.  I haven't heard much of his music, but after seeing Walk The Line, which shows his rise, fall, and rebirt, I realize that I am missing out. <br />Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) grew up on a farm.  His father Ray (Robert Patrick) always liked Johnny's older brother more, seeing Johnny as good for nothing, and throwing his life away listening to the Carter family sing on the radio.  After Johnny's brother died, Ray blamed Johnny. <br />While in the air force, Cash began writing songs about being in prison, despite having never been incarcerated himself.  Upon his return to the States, he married his childhood sweetheart Vivian (Ginnifer Goodwin), despite her father's protests and fears that Cash wouldn't be able to provide for her.  And at first, he can't.  He is too preoccupied with becoming a music star that he can't concentrate on his door-to-door sales job.  Finally, he decides to take his band, which, according to Vivian, is composed of two mechanics who can't play well, to a recording studio run by Sam Phillips (Dallas Roberts), owner of Sun Records.  Some of the other artists Phillips signed include Elvis Presley (Tyler Hilton), Jerry Lee Lewis (Waylon Payne), and Waylon Jennings (Shooter Jennings).  While on tour, Johnny meets June Carter (Reese Witherspoon), who was one of his idols while growing up.  She still sings, but she also performs comedy sideshow routines between the \\"real\\" musicians.  As Johnny and June get to know each other while they tour together, an attraction forms between them, and they become best friends.  While this is fine for June, who is also married, Johnny wants more.  Soon, he also gets into drugs, which eventually get him kicked off a tour when he forgets the lyrics to his songs and kicks out the footlights on stage.  Meanwhile, his homelife continues to get worse.  Vivian isn't very supportive of him during his dark days (I'm told that the real Vivan Cash was more supportive than portrayed here, but Iguess the film needed to make a few adjustments for the purposes of drama), and she becomes very jealous of June's relationship with her husband.  Eventually, Johnny drives away everyone he loves; his wife, his three daughters, and his band.  The only person who sticks by him during his darkest times is June. <br />While I'm sure that some of the events were a little embellished (as I already said, Vivan's character was a little off), these are all real events and they are as exciting as even some the best fictional love stories.  June's committment to her best friend is amazing, and Johnny's struggle, while not unique, is definitely trying for everyone involved. <br />Phoenix and Witherspoon deserve special recognition for their performances here.  Both of them nailed their characters so well.  Phoenix was able to perfectly imitate Cash's trademark deep voice and both of them did their own singing!  Every actor involved did very well, but these two were amazing.  It's too bad that Witherspoon gets stuck in so many silly romantic comedies, because she is truly wasting her talent in them. <br />Biopics aren't my favorite genre of films, but this one stands out as one of the greatest I've ever seen.  It's got a great story as well as an amazing soundtrack.
B000F48CD8|5.0|One part White Stripes, one part Brendan Benson, two parts Greenhornes... put these elements together and you get an amazing record.  I do think the Raconteurs made a mistake releasing a single with 2 album tracks (Steady As She Goes and Store Bought Bones) that are both uptempo rockers.  A good deal of this record is mellow tunes, and some people may not be into that.  Since I am, I think this stuff is brilliant.  This record is a collaboration between these talented musicians, so if you expect another Stripes record or another Benson record or another Greenhornes record, look elsewhere.   <br /> <br />I have seen many good reviews from mainstream press and many slams on the internet.  Reading these, I get the impression these \\"net hipsters\\" feel a mainstream nod is the same as a band \\"selling out\\".  I think this is rubbish.   <br /> <br />Way before this record was released, someone said that when they heard Broken Boy Soldiers they were reminded of hearing Nirvana's Nevermind record.  I understand this comment: when Nevermind was first released you didn't know THAT the record would become a huge smash, but you knew it SHOULD.  I feel the same way about Broken Boy Soldiers: dunno if it'll be huge (which would take crossing over to huge mainstream success... pretty unlikely) but it should.  It's that good.  Nevermind is much more accessible on the first listen, however.  This record will take a few listens to really \\"get it\\".  But that's how I like my music.   <br /> <br />Peace.

B000ETRCMQ|4.0|\\"Transamerica\\" is writer/director Duncan Tucker's feature film debut, a relationship film that takes the form of the road trip movies that the director most enjoys. Bree Osbourne (Felicity Huffman) is a transgendered woman one week away from her sexual reassignment surgery, the final step in her transformation to female anatomy, when she gets a phone call out of the blue from a young man looking for his father. Toby (Kevin Zegers) claims that his father is Bree's former self. Slightly shaken by the call, but determined not to do anything to jeopardize her upcoming surgery, Bree tells Toby that Stanley no longer lives there and hopes to forget the matter. But Bree's therapist Margaret (Elizabeth Pena) won't consent to the surgery until Bree deals with this ghost from the past. So Bree heads to New York to bail Toby out of jail and feel the situation out -which leads the odd couple to a cross-county road trip, Bree passing herself off as a missionary to juvenile delinquents and Toby trying her patience and evoking her sympathy with his troubled lifestyle.<br /><br />\\"Transamerica\\" is a nice combination of family drama and road movie. Ostensibly, the goal is to reach California in time for Bree's surgery, with various dramas along the way. But this is Bree's quest for her identity. Bree hardly seems more comfortable in her female identity than she did as a man. Her growing relationship with Toby and their misadventures lead her to assert her identity more forcefully. I have to question director Duncan Tucker's interpretation of a transsexual woman. Bree is very unnatural: Bad hair, ill-applied make-up, a bizarre voice that sounds like a woman trying to sound like a man trying to sound like a woman while speaking through a toilet paper tube. This is not someone who has lived for years as a woman. Bree's appearance and mannerisms are freakish. That's not realistic. Even weekend cross-dressers aren't this unnatural. Why make Bree out to be an alien when you are trying to focus the audience's attention on her emotions? It's distracting at the very least. \\"Transamerica\\" is effective as a whole, but I can't imagine why Duncan Taylor chose to make Bree a freak show -albeit a sympathetic freak show.<br /><br />The DVD (Weinstein Company 2006): Bonus features include 3 featurettes, an audio commentary, a music video for Dolly Parton's theme song \\"Travelin' Thru\\", a blooper reel (4 min), and a theatrical trailer. \\"A Conversation with Duncan Tucker and Felicity Huffman\\" (19 min) is too long, but includes comments from Huffman on how she approached creating the character of Bree and from Tucker on filming, characters, actors, and the film's early reception.

B00079HZUM|5.0|Starting with the ancient Greeks, tradition held that all roles in a play were to be played by men.  Whether the role was male or female made no difference.  There were various reasons given to justify this (most of them rather chauvinistic, but that's beside the point).  It was the way things were in the realm of theatre.<br /><br />Then, one day in the 17th century, a mere 300 years ago, this tradition came to an abrupt end.  Women(!) started portraying women(!) in plays - on stage!  This was a truly radical idea.<br /><br />The present movie tells the story from an interesting angle, that of the men who played women in plays.  Billy Crudup portrays just such a man.  It's not so easy for him to merely begin playing men's roles as he was trained from adolescence on to play a WOMAN.  Period.<br /><br />Suddenly, Crudup's character goes from being one of the most popular actors in Europe to being on the very bottom of the actor's guild food-chain.  The story is rather heart-wrenching, and Crudup does a remarkable job of playing an actor in a very vulnerable spot.  Claire Daines is beautiful and superb as the pioneering \\"first\\" actress.<br /><br />The movie is fixated around the death scene of Desdemona in Shakespeare's OTHELLO.  I believe that this scene is picked as symbolic of the \\"end of the line\\" of male actors playing female roles.  Whether that assessment is correct or not is for you to decide.<br /><br />In any case, if you're a fan of Shakespeare, the Thespian art or Period movies in general, this film is certainly for you.  In a word, it is.....tragic.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|This film came out months ago, and I've now seen it several times in the movie theater, and many more times on DVD.  The characters get inside your skin, the haunting loss and yearning in the movie staying with you long, long after you've finished watching the film.<br /><br />I've heard fellow women comment on Jack and Ennis's cheating on their wives, but the point I make to them is that the film isn't about that element.  Well, it is to some degree in that it's a movie about the destruction that having to hide who you are can bring.  But the larger theme I take away from the infidelity is that it's just one more byproduct of what happens when you refuse to stand for something--anything in your life.  What Ennis chooses by allowing his life to go on, year after year, without making a choice to risk everything for love...he winds up making a default choice.<br /><br />Heath Ledger as Ennis DelMar is obviously brilliant, as has been pointed out many times over.  His bottled up rage and frustration, his subtle performance, always dancing on a razor's edge, gives an incendiary quality to the film.<br /><br />Gyllenhaal has been severely underrated, however, at least in this viewer's opinion.  Without his sunnier, inspiring hopefulness in the role of Jack, the movie would find itself almost too much to take.  It's the yin and yang of the actor's portrayals that makes vivid the yin and yang of the men's love for each other.<br /><br />A perfect, beautiful movie in every possible way.  An all time favorite for me.<br />Deidre
0061053147|2.0|At best, this book should be looked at if you're interested in the facts behind the production of the film and you're able to look past Sammon's masturbative narrative. <br /> <br />While the book is informative on what happened and the difficulties behind the making of the film, the author's writing ability is about the same as someone standing next to you with a bullhorn. Self-aware and bordering on narcistsic, Sammon's dirt-basic writing ability has a constant feel of \\"Hey! I was here to see all this!\\" attitude that really undermines his attempt at objective writing. <br /> <br />Frustrating and amatuerish, \\"Future Noir: The Making of Blade Runner\\" is an unworthy footnote and a worthwhile coffee coaster.
078401213X|5.0|Don't read this if you haven't seen the movie! <br /> <br />It took me more than a dozen views to start figuring out how everything was connected.  What's with the bugs?  What's that stickey stuff in his mainfraim?  How are his breakdowns and paranoia connected to his work, and what is the quite white place he ends up in?  All the weird stuff is chaos slipping in between the seams, chaos which he thinks he's fighting against... at first.  Max had a thread of a connection to the great infinite divine, that which human beings are not wired to see.  He does see it though, glimpses at first, then the whole thing.  It almost kills him.  It's the classic Iccarus story, except that Max survives and finds happiness at the end.  I disagree that the end is a 'cop out' or incongruous-- it is the cumulation of every frame of the film... it is the point!  He looks at the leaves blowing in the trees, *doesn't* see a pattern, can't see a pattern, doesn't want to see a pattern-- and, for the very first time, he smiles. <br /> <br />Why isn't it perfect?  I would have like to see more actual math.  The concepts are there, but the details aren't.  Not a big deal.  \\"A Beautiful Mind\\" put a lot of effort into putting real math into the plot, and I like that. <br /> <br />Also, some of the details didn't connect.  For example, the 'name of god' (216-letters long), and the 216-digit number his computer spits out before dying, wouldn't necessarily be connected.  The system they explained indicated that different numbers of integers would represent a single letter in Hebrew.  Like 42 would be a letter, and 2 would be different letter.  So, the number of digits wouldn't really equal the number of letters... Darren kind of painted himself into a corner there.  He wisely chose not to make the punch line of the movie a complex number theory proof, and I didn't even notice (much less become annoyed about) this detail until viewing #15.  Up until then, every time I saw it something different would finally make sense. <br /> <br />Thus, five stars.  I'm inclined to give five stars to any movie that makes me think longer than the credits roll, so this one should get many many more. <br />

0385504209|4.0|First, as to the quality of writing, Dan Brown deserves a B-. The plot moves along at a good pace, and I personally liked the short chapters, which were reminiscent of a movie script. The downside of his writing was the lack of character development, and the dialogue that was way too simplistic and boring, even childlike.<br /><br />The star of The Da Vinci Code is the subject matter, specifically, the Jesus and Mary Magdalene relationship. Dan Brown's book is convincing that there really is something to this whole thing. I'm not saying that I'm convinced that Jesus was married and had a child by Mary. I'm saying that a lot of people in years goneby believe he did, and one of those is Leonardo. Anyone who looks at Da Vinci's Last Supper and can't see that that person next to Jesus is a chick and not a dude, needs glasses and possibly therapy of some kind. As for the so-called experts who try to explain this away by saying that John was the youngest apostle, and therefore, beardless and feminine in comparison with the other apostles, you've got to be kidding! John was a rugged fisherman, and one who Jesus referred to as a \\"Son of Thunder\\", a very masculine term. (see Mark 3:17).
B00005JOVO|4.0|It's New Year's Eve aboard the cruise ship Poseidon, and the revelers in the ballroom are unaware that a \\"rogue wave\\" is headed their way.  But first, we meet the unsuspecting partygoers:  Father (Kurt Russell) and daughter (Emmy Rossum), handsome and conceited gambler (Josh Lucas), single mom and her small son, and rich but depressed businessman (Richard Dreyfuss).  The surprise wave turns the ship over, there are countless causalities, but who will survive the climb to the top, er, bottom?<br /><br />Comparisons with the Irwin Allen original are natural, but they really are very different movies.  The 1972 version was character-driven.  We knew a lot about the personalities and histories of the main cast and cared about them.  There was a lot of inter-personal drama that was quite enjoyable and special effects were limited to the upside-down roll of the ship.  The new \\"Poseidon\\" is all about the CGI effects, and they are truly outstanding.  The flipping of the ship is much more violent and realistic this time around, and it's just the start of the action.  And there are enough underwater scenes to have you holding your own breath as you are caught up in the excitement.  We know almost nothing about the characters, but that didn't bother me as the star of the show is the explosive action.<br /><br />The director maintains a high level of tension throughout the film; the danger never lets up, and the pace is quick.  We know some of the cast won't survive, but we don't know who, and that keeps us involved.  (I was surprised no one said, \\"Let's climb to the bottom of the ship and get out that way; you know, like they did in \\"The Poseidon Adventure\\"!)  Action fans will surely enjoy this non-stop thrill ride.  Heartily recommended.

B000EMGAOY|5.0|The year is almost half way over, yet there is a particular salience about the Chili Peppers new double disc album that, in my humble opinion, make it stand out as the first terrific album of the year.  The Chili Peppers are grown up, and exhibiting their maturity in Stadium Arcadium, however, that's not to say that they deviate an inordinate amount from their tried and true formula.  This album is top notch, as they chronologically bounce back and forth throughout the last 15 or 20 years with throwback \\"old school\\" songs (Hump de Bump) as well as songs that sounds like their 1990's music, and of course songs that sound futuristic even.  All in all the best album as of May 2006.  I can't recommend this highly enough!
1594200823|5.0|Michael Pollan has produced a truly eyeopening work.  The Omnivore's Dilemma is an indictment not just of factory farming and the industrial production of food, whose cruelties and inhumanities we all have to be aware of, intellectually if not in actuality, but of the Western diet and the ill health and assorted other problems it causes.<br /><br />Reading this book strips away some comforting fantasies: free range chickens only get to spend a few days \\"outdoors\\", government programs designed to produce more corn make even less economic sense than the old Depression era programs to reduce production, etc, etc.<br /><br />As Pollan rightly points out, the dilemma we face seems insurmountable, and even when we can make some changes, new problems inevitably surface.  While we would all love to get our food exclusively from places like Polyface Farm, the realities of population and climate (among many others) make that impossible.<br /><br />Pollan reveals these difficult truths in an engaging, memoir-like style.  The people he meets and writes about are pleasant and the circumstances interesting.  Even though you might (and should) feel revolted by some of what Pollan reveals, you should read The Omnivore's Dilemma for a better understanding of one of the major quandaries of our time.
B000HCO83Q|4.0|Well there was so much doubt about this movie and it is finally out. In my opinion they did a good job. We start the movie with Charles and Eric going to Jeans house to bring her to the school. We then skip to the future and it seems that the X-MEN are training. Awesome indeed. Scott seems to be a depressive state and is also getting messages from Jean. He leaves to go to the lake where she died. We also find out that a cure has been produced. Magneto has found out and is furious. Cyclops gets to the lake and Jean is still contacting him. In a furious rage he blasts into the lake and wakes Jean up. He seems egstatic but well -------. Back at the mansion Hank informs them of the cure and in storms word \\"Theres nothing to cure. Nothings wrong with us.\\" Xavier feels that something is wrong and tells Storm and Wolverine to get to the Lake. They find Jean and get her back to the mansion. Then we learn what the truth is. To protect Jean from getting out of control Xavier needed to put psychic blocks on her. Unfortunately she has broken free of them and he needs to put them back up. Before he can do this she gets away. I think this is where I will stop. The movie gives us a good character developement with all the mutants that were there before. There really is no sense in bringing more mutants into the equation and getting us confused. No matter what people say. I think seeing the mnutants that were in the movie was fine. Everyone get their fill. Of course the movie didn't follow the original story of Phoenix merging with Jean and going into space and everything. I think the reason why Ratner didn't do all of that was because of budget and it would have been way too CG'd and taken the quality away. I am a believer of the comic book I know the stories. This was a good adaptation.
0553802534|4.0|I found the book entertaining once I decided to overlook its few weaknesses.  <br /> <br />For one, it annoys me when characters behave illogically, or do things just to bolster the plot. Both of the main characters are guilty. And while all of us have things hidden in our closet, the hero and heroine in this story have an attic full. <br /> <br />As with many novels, this one could have been edited down about 100 pages and still would have worked just fine. Fortunately, Gardner's writing style is quite crisp, which makes for a fast read. <br /> <br />Overall, an enjoyable, if slightly flawed book. <br />
B00006LSM3|5.0|I purchased this album shortly after it was released and, unfortunately, only recently began to venture beyond the first few tracks.  Better late than never.  This is easily the best release by a former Beatle since the 70's.  Brainwashed is certainly head and shoulders above McCartney's recent releases.  I've long felt that George was vastly underrated in many ways: as a guitarist, as a songwriter and as a lyricist; fortunately his great skill in all of those areas are present in abundance on this great album, in particular his lyrics.  Many of the songs on Brainwashed have simply brilliant lyrics that offer a glimpse into George's spiritual journey as it was coming to an end when this album was being written and recorded.  Any Road, Pisces Fish, Rising Sun, and Stuck inside a Cloud stand out in my mind as being particularly poignant in light of George's search for divine truth and meaning.  The adoration of peers and friends such as Eric Clapton, Tom Petty and the members of Monty Python, among others, that was shown in the film \\"Concert for George\\" (which I would also recommend) showed what a wonderful friend Harrison was to many.  This album demonstrates the great talent he had to share with those who would listen--in the final analysis, George Harrison was truly comparable to the Lennon/McCartney juggernaut.  Lennon once said:\\"George himself is no mystery, it's watching George discover himself that is so damn fascinating\\"  Brainwashed is the final chapter of that discovery and it is every bit as rewarding as Lennon suggested.

Some of you will already know what I'm talking about... a racially driven device to hide certain features from the type of consumer who wouldn't buy this CD if the hidden feature were shown in all its natural shape. <br />And Rihanna is not the only artist to be subjected to such tactics. For the most part, I hadn't seen this tactic all too often anymore, but it manages to pop up on an album here, an album there. <br />I'm sure many will say they don't like this review because I'm bringing up this reality, one that those who aren't affected by it, won't care to here about and will be quick to deny it. I'm primarily writing this for the people who know what I'm talking about, and if others come to be aware about this through this review, then so much the better. <br />NOW, as for the music, it's a step down or two from Rihanna's previous album, which had more of a reggae/dancehall feel, a sound that is largely absent on this album, which is more of a pop/R&B album, full of ballads and whatnot. So it's OK, but if you had to choose between the two, take \\"Music of the Sun,\\" which also shows Rihanna's beauty without resorting to such racialist gimmickry as covering up her nose with hair and lightening her complexion.
1592401791|5.0|My Beatles library now spans over 30 volumes and, up until this point, I had credited George Martin with developing the \\"Beatles sound.\\" Though it occasionally suffers from poor editing (a minor quibble), here finally is the *real* story of how such revolutionary recording techniques as backward vocals/guitar, tape loops, ADT, and vocal-through-the-Leslie came into being--by the cleverness of the unheralded Geoff Emerick. <br /> <br />Thankfully, this book doesn't get into the Beatles' lives outside of Abbey Road studios; I've read enough about their Liverpool and Hamburg accounts, of Brian Epstein, the Maharishi and how Yoko purportedly destroyed the group. Rather, like Andy Babiuk's fastinating contribution, this book focuses on the most important aspect of the Fabs' career--the tremendous musical heritage they left behind and how it came into being. Well done, Geoff!
B000007U5G|4.0|If you are a Glenn Hughes  or a Deep Purple fan of the Coverdale/Hughes era you should get this CD. Although I thought Deep Purple took a step back when Ian Gillian and Roger Glover left Deep Purple and David Coverdale and Glenn Hughes joined the band they made some great songs. This CD in my opinion captures Glenn Hughes at his best singing some of the best Deep Purple and his own songs live in concert. His voice is in top notch form and the sound is great for a live recording. If the rock and roll Gelnn Hughes is what you like here it is in all it's glory. At times I can give or take some of his solo stuff but this is kick [...] all the way. Listen to it loud and enjoy.
B000069AUI|5.0|Some great music here. I don't think it is as good as  Parachutes, but how many bands ever make a second album as good as the first. That said this is still a very good album. Coldplay are always a step ahead of the rest of the bands of their ilk. Chris Martin sounds excellent on this CD as do the rest of the band. \\"Politik\\" - \\"In My Place\\" - \\"God Put A Smile Upon Your Face\\" are pretty darn near perfect pop songs that really show the bands ability to shine. Coldplay have created a large bag of beautiful and engaging songs, and this is only their second album. I think the lyrics are more interesting on this one than the other two albums, but \\"Parachutes\\", musically, was better. I find my self listening to this album a lot lately, a real great CD.
0722532938|5.0|The Alchemist is my girlfriend's favourite ever book, and after she recommended The Life of Pi to me, which I loved, I thought I'd give it this a go too. I'd never thought about reading it, because I thought it was just some kind of deluded new-age fantasy.    But now it feels like I've been missing out all along - and I regret not having read it sooner! It's a simple story about a shepherd who goes on a long journey, and in so doing, discovers not only his true love, but also himself.    It's written in a very simple style, and so you could almost read it as just a fairy tale. But there are hidden depths - everything that happens can be applied to your life. It makes you look inside yourself, and ask questions that only you can answer. There's much more to it than meets the eye. It makes you wonder what's going on in everyone else's life.    Reading this book, you understand that life can be an uncomplicated and joyful adventure, rather than a daily grind. It has a simple, elegant beauty, one that makes me happy just thinking about it. I feel like my life has changed now that I've read it, and I can see why Natasha loves it so much! I'm ready to give everything up to pursue my goals and dreams - I feel like a better, happier person!
B000FQJAIW|1.0|Thanks Mr. Lucas for giving us the original Star Wars trilogy as a \\"bonus feature\\" complete with terrible picture and sound. Can I have all the money I've spent on Star Wars since 1977 please?
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Wonderful!! Need I say more? I think that every girl that has watched the movie feels the same way as me: we def need to clone Mr. Darcys for all of us. I loved the movie and I think it was better than the Notebook by far. And I dont intend to offend those who liked the Notebook, I did like it also. <br /> <br />The movie sticks to the book. When youre watching the movie its like youre reading the book. Most of the dialogues are exactly as in the book.  <br /> <br />I recommend the movie to everyone, especially those hopeless romantics out there. And I think guys should learn from Mr. Darcy. The movie shows sublime, real love and respect between Elizabeth and Darcy.   <br /> <br />Great movie!
B000ETQRCM|1.0|As a long time fan of the Seattle,WA. alternative underground explosion that hit like a bullet 15 years ago (Nirvana/Soundgarden/Pearl Jam) I have to say this is by far the worst Pearl Jam album I have ever heard. It's the kind of record you will soon find at a gas station when buying that soda to keep you awake for a long trip down I-5(for $1.99) <br />In fact one might even save themselves some time by just going to a flea market where I promise every booth will have a copy on sale for a quarter. If Eddy want's to take a few years off he better spend that time creating at least an above average CD. Im am very dissapointed!!!
B00005JP4U|1.0|Having seen this movie at a preview, I can say that Gore is every bit the equal of Michael Moore. Which is to say, he's a liar and a propagandist. Another reviewer summed up the truth nicely - there is in fact a global warming trend, and it may cause problems. But there is NO evidence that this trend is due to human causes or influences, and in fact, all evidence points to the contrary. <br />Unless you're making up your facts, that is. Inconvenient indeed.
B00005JOVH|2.0|I write this as a fan both of the comics (certain Claremont era work, Grant Morrison, Ultimate, Astonishing) and of the first two films.  I will not spoil anything, as that task has been well completed by those who came before.  I simply wish to express my disappointment. <br /> <br />Part of why Bryan Singer's direction of the first two films was so great was that he's gay.  Because of course the X-Men have always been about minority identity groups, be they gay, of a different ethnicity, female, or persons with disabilities.  This made the wonderful \\"Bobby Drake comes out to his parents\\" sequence in X2 so poignant and effective.  And also why the same topic didn't really need to be broached again. <br /> <br />But instead they've made an entire film out of the topic, with some of the most ham-handed dialogue I've heard coming out of Halle Berry's mouth since Catwoman.  Yes.  We know.  There's no \\"cure\\" because there's no disease.  It's genetic.  We get it.  Thanks. <br /> <br />But that's not really my problem, though that would likely be enough.  No, my problem with the film lies in the rather shocking (mis-)treatment of some of the most beloved characters in all of comics.  Others have complained that Ratner has no style of his own as a director and this film thus comes out looking a standard action flick.  This is true, but we're hardly in the realm of the auteur anymore.  Others have complained that characterization is not given enough time to get off the ground (particularly with Angel, Colossus, Kitty, Callisto, Jamie Madrox, Juggernaut, &c.).  This is also true, though for my money one of those underdeveloped characters, Kelsey Grammer's sublime Beast, delivers the best line in the picture; but perhaps I only say so since I'm a Frasier fan as well. <br /> <br />These are valid complaints.  The film feels rushed because it is.  There's an awful lot to get to in the span of 107 minutes.  You can do this if you're Wong Kar-Wai, but Brett Ratner, I think we canall agree, is no Wong Kar-Wai.  The special effects are exactly what one has come to expect.  They are not astonishing by any stretch of the means, but I can't remember the last time I was astonished by special effects.  Characters are dispensed with abruptly and for no apparent reason - when they are gone (with one exception), you would think that the audience would be allowed to mourn for these characters with whom we've already shared two films.  Not so.  As I said, there's too much to do in this picture - we simply cannot allow an appropraite mourning period, because we've got to go ruin the Golden Gate Bridge (in a none-too-subtle parallel to contemporary terrorism concerns, thank you very much once again says the dead horse). <br /> <br />But perhaps most damning is the Dark Phoenix herself.  The comic saga written by Chris Claremont (back when characters had thought bubbles!  There were so many words on the pages back then...) is among the best ever plotted for the mutants, and holds up nicely over time.  Granted, pulling that big of a saga into a film is impossible, and I wouldn't expect anyone to attempt it.  But what we see Jean Grey become in this film is undertheorized and underwhelming.  When the Phoenix takes over, Jean suddenly becomes, for the most part, mute.  When she does speak it's to say nothing of any consequence, and sounds in the main like an adolescent who's just been told she can't have any pudding since she didn't eat her meat.  The other characters, Xavier and Magneto in particular, are constantly in a tizzy about just how powerful Jean is.  \\"Oh, good heavens,\\" they say, \\"you have no idea how powerful she is.  Gracious!\\"  And, true enough, in the comics the Phoenix is a god-like entity who goes around consuming stars.  You know, like the Sun.  In the film, it would seem that her powers are more or less limited to disintigrating flesh (and could we please, finally, come to some sort of consensus on just how quickly Logan's healing factoractually works?) and making sure that objects (like water!) fall up instead of down. <br /> <br />I was perplexed. <br /> <br />I'm nitpicking to a certain degree, to be sure.  And I can absolutely see how some might find this film enjoyable.  It is a decent action flick, filled with some nifty explosions and the occasional bridge relocation.  But, growing up with the X-Men and continuing to love them and revisit them as I do, I have to expect more from them as a fan.  And that's basically the summing-up - I expect more from the X-Men.
B00004CZOE|3.0|This film creates a nightmare. The sun never shines. It is always dark. The characters are either street toughs, who engage in habitual brutal exploitation, or their victims, who are shadowy and undeveloped. The violence is really extreme, on every level. It could be a story of life inside a prison or of a war, but we are told it takes place in Brooklyn in 1952.    I kept trying to find something redeeming, some selfless act of human kindness, something half way beautiful that would lead me out of this version of hell, some visual depiction of the exquisite string music provided by Mark Knopfler as the score; but very little was there. The film did not show anything that cried out for justice in the strike, and therefore it was hard not to sympathize with the company, which at least employed some reason in their tactics. All the personal relationships were either superficial, or so briefly touched upon, that it was hard to imagine any depth or lasting impression or anything very meaningful.    If it is enough to depict a hell of violence and victimization, then this film succeeds, with gut wrenching performances such as Jennifer Jason Leigh's. But it leads nowhere.
B000F0UV0E|4.0|Mark and Emmylou sure sound good together, and the guitar and lyrics are awesome.  I heard this one over the music store loudspeakers while shopping in Germany and asked the clerk to fetch me a copy.  It now gets lots of airtime in my house, but the first few tracks are stronger than the rest.  Still, some real winners and a great sound from a duo I hope to hear more from in the future.
B000002UWP|5.0|Thinking back now, I realize how truly blessed I was to be coming of age and be able to buy my own records precisely in 1991. Sit back and reflect for a moment and I'm sure those of you who entered their teenage years around that time can recall a veritable barrage of amazing ambums from that particular year: Nirvana's Nevermind, Metallica's Black Album, Guns N' Roses' Use Your Illusion 1+2 & Michael Jackson's Dangerous (which spawned more singles than any album I can remember) and a host of Greatest-albums from artists like Queen, among others. And here in Denmark, where I'm from, rockers DAD released their pinnacle album, Riskin' It All. Now, alongside all of those there was a plucky duo (duette) from Sweden who were determined to claim their piece of the pie. They were & are Roxette and Joyride was the album with which they accomplished just that. My story with this record is like many you all can tell. I was visiting a friend and suddenly he says 'Hey I got something you should hear' and proceeds to put on Fading Like A Flower. I'm a sucker for power ballads, always will be, and needless to say I was hooked and sang it all the way home. So, inevitably, I bought the album (on Cassette, no less - I would switch to CD's the following year) thinking that if there was just a couple more songs as great as Fading on there I would like it. I started playing it...and then I found myself completely and helplessly unable to stop playing it! I simply fell in love with practically every single track on that damn thing - and now, 15 years later, I still get a kick out of putting it on. If THAT's not the definition of great music then I'll gladly admit that I've missed something. Yes, there are a couple of fun filler tracks but it's also very varied album and the percentage of great songs is nothing short of astounding! I would not hesitate to proclaim this one of the great pop records of all time. And in a way, I'm glad that Roxette decided to mature their sound after this. Because I honestly can't see how even they could have begun to try and top this... <br />So, in closing, if you're looking for a fun, energetic pop/rock album that features great songwriting to boot, then hunt this up. You shouldn't be dissapointed.
B000F6IOC0|1.0|I stopped watching it after an hour.  I kept waiting for it to get better, but  it didn't.  It followed the same cycle every 10-15 minutes or so: Kate Beckingsdale jabbering on about deathdealer and lycan history.  Just when you're ready to fall asleep, just cue to Speedman turning into a monster and fighting for 5 minutes.  Then, after the fight's over, listen to Kate jabber on again for another 10-15 minutes.    <br /> <br />Rent it if you must, or see one of the Blade movies.

B00005YW4H|5.0|This is the first Norah Jones CD I've ever had; indeed, it's the first time I've heard her music in any quantity.  I heard \\"Don't Know Why\\" on Sirius in the car one day, and was intrigued enough by her voice and style to want to hear more.  And I was NOT disappointed! <br /> <br />This CD is perfect for coming home, kicking off your shoes, pouring a glass of wine, and just letting the day drain away.  Norah's smoky, velvety voice is wonderful.  The selections she offers here are reminiscent, to me, of the songs featured on the Sleepless In Seattle soundtrack, and not a one is a let down. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this CD.
B00005NWM3|4.0|When I saw Nickelback's add for this on TV, I thought they were one of those soft bands, judging by their choice of album art. I judged the book by its cover, or in this case, the CD cover. Boy, was I wrong! This is great stuff man! I sang how you remind me at school and everyone just loved it. It is such a great song. It is my favourite song on the album. The reason why I'm only giving it four stars is because they aren't as good as Green Day and I gave Green Day five stars. No band or single artist is as good as Green Day. <br /> <br />So you should check this out. They write great songs, and I haven't heard a single song by them I don't like so far.  <br /> <br />And as for mullet \\"guess im wasting my time writing a review :)\\", what are you on about? If you do not think fans of this band have been exposed to very much music, then you're wrong. I watch a musical every week, and I listen to loads of music. I take the subject at school. So maybe you wanna think about that statement again.
B000FQJAIW|1.0|You know, I can remember when I was 8 years old. Day to day life was fine.....normal in all respects for an 8 year old boy. The year was 1976, Jimmy Carter was elected President, and my Dad was just starting to complain about the price of gas....and my next door neighbor was busy showing off his U.S. mint bi-centinnial coin set to me and all the other kids that lived on my street... <br /> <br />Then, fast foward to 1977.....OH MY GOD.....My Dad took us to see this movie called, Star Wars.... I don't think I moved or dared breathe the entire 2 hours....I begged my Dad and we ended up seeing that movie 3 more times that year.... <br /> <br />Flash foward to today 29 years later,....while I am glad to see some effort being done to bring me the movie I remember as a wide eyed 9 year old boy, I am distraught with the idea that it has been reduced to a \\"bonus\\" feature as part of a trilogy I already own. And guess what anamorphic DOES matter. Some knuckle head wrote in his review, <br />\\" I prefer the black bars...then I know I'm seeing the whole movie and not a cropped version to fit your stupid 16x9 televisions! Ha! Ha!\\"  <br />I have news for you moron,.....anamorphic movies aren't cropped, its actually MORE resolution....IDIOT. <br /> <br />Anyway, (sorry for my outburst, but that guy pissed me off with his dribble)....I am not going to buy this and I'll tell you why. It's out of principle....if I buy this I am saying to George Lucas that's its OK. That I some how am grateful that my favorite movie of ALL TIME is a \\"bonus\\" feature......Great George, thanks alot. Sorry George, not in a million years.
B000E1155E|5.0|What is the ideal attitude a rocker should have today?  Subversive, Self-Aware, Confident, Articulate, Ambitious, Interested.  All of this is the well contained sound of Artic Monkeys.  This attitude, combined with some serious talent has brought them to the bleeding edge of rock.  Nothing is boring about this music.  The form, rhythm, and vocals always keep you on your toes.  It doesn't drone like some punk rock.    It is varied in all ways and each song is unique.      From what I have been reading, there has been a lot of buzz about this album.  I never heard any of that and I don't think your high expectations should bring this band into a disapointing light.  These guys are f-ing good.  This is a young band that are far beyond their years in theory and sound, and pretty much everything, except for spirit.     Alex Turner, the lead singer, was declared \\"Coolest Guy in the World\\" by TME Magazine.  If that's the case, my Mum has been lying to me all these years.  Well it's just opinion.      Bottom Line - if you have the itch to rock, Artic Monkeys will make it all nice.  Their energy is pervasive in almost all situations.  Save a Mountain Dew and listen to Artic Monkeys.
B000002I6V|5.0|\\"Songs for Beginners\\" is one of my all-time favorite albums.  I can't stop listening to it.  Graham Nash has proved himself to be an excellent musician even without the presence of his band members of either the Hollies or CSN/Y. It's a wonderful, mellow album to just relax with.  My only complaint with the entire album is the presence of the choir in \\"Be Yourself.\\"  Otherwise, it is beautiful and touching and I wish it was much, much longer.  I cannot emphasize enough how much I love this album!
B000301YY8|5.0|It's hard to give this album a reasonable assesment because James Blunt polarizes so many people.  If you don't like him now, this review probably isn't going to convince you.  So many people shoot down Blunt for his sentimental tone.  Fact is, he was a soilder in Kosovo and was put in authority over many troops as a captain.  This guy knows how to control people and music.  A lot was put into this album emotionally.  If an album were sold based on how much work put into it, like handcrafted woodwork is, \\"Back to Bedlam\\" would be very expensive - especially relative to most of the pop mush out today.   <br /> <br />The Songs are similar but strangly not boring.  They meld together very well.  James Blunt's falsetto voice might be unlike anything you've ever heard but after the initial shock, you realize that this guy has a real talent for songwriting and performing.  If James Blunt is pop, I don't think I have heard pop that is so emotionally compelling.  But if there is a limit to how emotional pop music can be, I will say that I think Blunt is at it.  If nothing else, credit him for finding the emotional possibilities of pop.
B0000027RL|5.0|Simple and right to the point. This is best best album ever created as others here have high praises also. It doesn't get any better. No further explaining - just listen to each and every song and be amazed.
B00005JOVH|3.0|<br />First off I have to point out that while I was not a fan of the original X-men that came out in 2000 I was a huge fan of the second in the franchise.  This film, while it raises interesting philosophical questions falls well short of my expectations.   <br /> <br />Its not that the story is a bad story it just promised too much and delivered too little.  The special effects are great but there are plot holes in the movie that are big enough to drive a train through.   <br /> <br />The acting is all over the map  <br /> <br /> <br />Hugh Jackman <br />....  Logan/Wolverine <br />Halle Berry <br />....  Ororo Munroe/Storm <br />Ian McKellen <br />....  Eric Lensherr/Magneto <br /> <br />These three perform well especially Mckellen who always manages to snatch an acting victory from the jaws of defeat.  The rest of the cast is hardly given any screen time at all.   <br /> <br />Even though its been 4 years since the last one came out the story feels half baked.  They needed more time to nail it all down.  At times it felt like there were 2 or 3 separate storylines.   <br /> <br />Overall-I hope everyone connected with this project counts their blessings and just go their separate ways.  This movie is not exactly a high note but it is a good place to end it.  I really wanted to like this movie like I did X2.  I never could quite manage it.   <br />
0596007124|5.0|Soon after the Gang of Four published their book about basics of Design Patterns, I bought the book and read it very carefully. About that time  I was busy doing other engineering work so I could not put the patterns in immediate use in some practical project. Maybe that contributed to my troubles understanding it. <br /> <br />While reading the GoF book I found it very complicated to memorize the pattern. After reading so many books on programming, so many technical and other books every year in several decades in the past, I thought I have a very strong and sound learning techniques from books. But GoF book simply was out of my reach from some reason. The problem was this: when reading about a pattern, I could understand every sentence, every paragraph, and most of the time the whole chapter about that particular pattern; but it seemed hard to keep in mind that pattern, and soon afterwards, I could hardly implement the pattern in my programs. It was as if you are keeping the slippery fish in your hands, and just when you think you caught it, it slips from your hands back into the water.  <br /> <br />Finally after this book (it is still in reading) I found what I was searching for:  <br />1) the crystal sound explanation of  Design Patterns &#8211; why you use any of them; <br />2) what is important and what is not important in pattern. Actually the authors of HeadFirst does not speak much about it explicitly, but when they explain the pattern you do not have to think what I was constantly thinking when reading GoF book: what is the most important part of the pattern and which part of pattern can be changed for specific use. With HeadFirst book you get the right measure of all parts of pattern explanation. <br />3) I could memorize, reproduce and implement the patterns with ease!  <br /> <br />Second, the book is astonishingly new, refreshing and perfect in the presentation sense. It is full of pictures and with hand-written comments. Everybody who was ever involved in the presentation material would tell how hard is to achieve such a great presentation level with so many diverse visual effects and putting them in perfect shape like this book achieves. I think this was the problem for one of the very rare reviewers of this book to give this beautiful book such a bad grade. I think he was wrong to falling under the first-impression opinion and misjudged the book greatly. <br /> <br />The truth is the HeadFirst Design Patterns deserves the highest possible marks &#8211; I do not give it only 5 stars, but I give it the Oscar for Design Patterns. And that is final even before I read the last page of it. Authors of this book, if you ever read this comment here is the message for you: my sincere complements for your hard work, you has been terrifically good, and I mean it! <br />
B00003CXXP|5.0|This is a magnificent film.  In many ways, this is Kubrick's swansong, despite being directed by Steven Spielberg.  It's one of the greatest, most moving, haunting science fiction films ever made.  It made me think for days afterwards.  I love the structure of the film.  It's very Kubrickian, in that it has 3 main acts, and there's no linking between them.  It's very similar in style to 2001, where you jump from prehistoric times to 2001, then to the moon, then to Jupiter, then beyond the infinite, or in Full Metal Jacket, where you're in boot camp, then, bang, you're in Vietnam.  Haley Joel Osmet gives a superb performance as David, the robot who longs to be loved and human.  And Steven Spielberg does a masterful job directing this film.  It's interesting to note that this is one of the few Spielberg films (Close Encounters of the Third Kind being the other) that he wrote himself.  Even though the material was based on Kubrick's treatment, this film along with Close are 2 of the best science fiction films ever made.  He really was the only other director who could have made this film.  He even remarked that he made a Kubrick film, in that the film really polarised people.  One of Spielberg's best films.
B000002VCU|5.0|Another previous reviewer said that this and I ROBOT were the two best Parson's albums, but TURN OF A FRIENDLY CARD is far better in my opinion than I ROBOT. Only EYE IN THE SKY comes close to this one because of the two great songs on it &quot;Silence and I&quot; and &quot;Old and Wise&quot;. I have been totally mesmerized by this album since I aquired it back in 1981. The sound quality on every song except &quot;Games People Play&quot; is brilliant and amazing. I don't think they've even tried to remaster any of these Project cds (except I think they might have remastered TALES OF MYSTERY AND IMAGINATION) because they were recorded so brilliantly. I'm not sure, but I think some of them (like the cd STEREOTOMY was) were recorded digitally. Parson's is definitely a great sound engineer. Everything on here is within the concept of gambling except the song &quot;Time&quot; which is a brilliant ballad sung by the great Eric Woolfson. That guy is such a brilliant vocalist and Parson's knows how to find the right type of singers though Woolfson is my personal favorite. If you want to show off a great home or car stereo system this is one of the better cds to pop in it. This would definitely be the very best Project cd to aquire first, along with, maybe, EYE IN THE SKY. Enjoy!!!
6300182576|3.0|Several important scenes are missing from<br /><br />the DVD print!

B00000IMTE|4.0|I was a big Deep Purple and Elf-Dio fan and this debut Rainbow effort is one of the better if not the best albums that Dio has ever appeared on. I think that it's about tied with LONG LIVE ROCK & ROLL as the finest Rainbow album. Another reviewer said that RISING was better than the debut but I don't agree. RISING is an aquired taste in my opinion, and it took me awhile to get into but it's still a good album. I got rid of the first issue of BLACKMORE'S RAINBOW several years ago, but just aquired the newest remaster and the treble response sounds a lot worse than from before and it sounds really distorted on my great car cd deck. There's nothing wrong with my car stereo either because all my other cds sound just fine. I can't believe other reviewers aren't mentioning the bad sound quality but I won't take off a star or anything because this album is such a classic. I guess I'm going to have to search out a used first issue of this on Amazon. Believe me, every song on this is just superb and definitely no filler on this release. I just wish that Dio could have gotten along with Blackmore better so we could have had a lot more albums from this lineup, but sometimes two big stars like this will definitely [...]heads, and that turns out to be the case. Go for the first issue if you want to buy this classic metal-hard rock offering. Took off 8/10 of a star due to the botched remastering. It would get the full five stars otherwise.

B00006690G|1.0|Ok, let me first say I DID (cannot believe I am admitting this) buy this cd.  For ONE reason...\\"superman\\" has got a SWEET bassline.  THAT'S IT.  Eminem is a washed up clown, who happens to have become famous maybe for his ability to \\"rap\\" but mostly because of his skin color and contraversial lyrics.  How on God's green earth do we go from Manson to this guy.  Not saying Manson is any better lyrically.  But MUSICALLY.  Screw rap.  How much talent do you need to rhythmically talk in front of a loop.  Instead of buying this crap and possibly dreaming of following in his embarassing footsteps, do yourself a favor and the future of music a favor and buy a guitar and WRITE yourself a song that consists of a MELODY.  Or if you want music with intense emotion that ties into every human's instincts SCREAM in front of seething guitar riffs.  Because how many of us really care about mono-tone stupid G content. I'm not a gangst\\"a\\" and 99.99% of the mainstream isn't either. So stop lying.  Music has sucked since Eminem was even remotely compared to Kurt Cobain.  Artistically, no freakin' contest.  Children are getting more stupid.  As is the mainstream.  Please God send us our next meaningful BAND.  NOT MC.....A BAND.....that writes and performs music we can mosh to.  Or for musicians like myself have to put forth effort and time practicing in order to play. I cannot wait till the time comes when rap now is like 80's glam rock because THAT DAY WILL COME.  You watch.  Holy crap it's worse now though.  This music doesn't even require you to play an instrument or have a godly voice.  EVERYONE CAN DO IT!  yeah, that's talent. Maybe that's what people want in their lack of intelligence and ability this day and age. God help us all.   <br />P.S. MTV \\"sells\\" us trends all the time.  Rap and eminem are very fashionable music items.  Not to mention all the gold around everyone's neck.  The american dream of money 24 hours a day but the only difference is it's them not you, stop paying these con artists.  That's right CON-artists........not artists.
0316776963|3.0|I usually get a laugh from David Sedaris, but this book seemed a bit sparse in that department. Still, he's the funniest essayist since James Thurber, so who's complaining?
B000AYQLX6|4.0|Everyone has said plenty about the album itself.  Most people <br />looking at this probably already know the album well anyway. <br />So I will just make a quick comment on the remastering.  It is <br />well worth the upgrade!  I just did an A/B comparison, and the <br />detail, especially at the higher frequencies, is like night and <br />day.  I always thought the mix for \\"Whatever Gets You Through The <br />Night\\" (both LP and original CD release) sounded like it was coming <br />through a telephone.  It's greatly improved here, as are all the <br />other tracks. <br /> <br />I give the album 4 stars, only because I'm comparing with other <br />Beatle work, rather than the general huge body of stuff out on <br />the market.  This is an excellent album.
B00005JOVH|4.0|I'm not going to go into a long winded review about why the movie sucks or dosent suck.  I will say that Brett Ratner has taken the ENERGY to the next level, and that some of the FX are some of the best captured on film. I will say although I liked both X-Men 1 & 2, they both could have used a bit more action. I'm for a good back story as much as the next man, but this one actually did what i thought the franchise needed, they brought the feel of the comic book to the big-screen. I mean c'mon in both the comic and the cartoon the X-Men USE THERE POWERS. in both one and two the powers of the characters were underutalized. <br />Storm would use her power like once a film, ice man turned coffee into ice, etc... Not in this one, the focus is put back on what the people want to see. Powers galore and great battles.  I must admit the film is rather shallow, but the first two brought enough depth to compensate for this one.  To me its like the difference between Alien & Aliens one was more cerebral the other more spectacle. I advise you to go out and see it, Enjoy it. Sure people perish, sure there are some corny lines, but thats what comics are all about right?
B00005JOVH|2.0|I've been a fan of the X-men for over a decade now and I'll honestly admit that my complaints outnumber my compliments for this film, and the entire trilogy of X-men movies.<br /><br />I'd say the best quality of it has been the choice of actors/actresses for certain rolls. Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, Halle Barry, Kelsey Grammer, Vinnie Jones, Ian McKellen and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos were all great for their rolls. In fact, they were so great that it's unlikely such a unique combination of stars will be able to outperform them in the event that somebody tries to tell the story correctly.<br /><br />The worst quality I've seen is that characters were introduced in the wrong order. For example, Beast and Angel were two members of the original X-men (I have the poster) and they came before Wolverine, Storm, Colossus, Nightcrawler, Shadowcat, or Jubilee.<br /><br />The second worst part is how so many characters were killed off just for shock value, and this was done before missing characters were even brought into the film (ie: Gambit, the Blob, Psylocke, just to name a few).<br /><br />Another part that bothered me was that Nightcrawler didn't return for X3. He more than proved himself in X2, but then just vanished, as he's known to do.<br /><br />Plus, Rogue, Cyclops, and Angel all had minor rolls in The Last Stand. Plus, how could they rob Rogue of her powers like that before she gains her superhuman strength & flying ability from Ms. Marvel? That sucks.<br /><br />Personally, I think the trilogy would've been far more successful if:<br /><br />1) Arnold had played Colossus<br /><br />2) Lucy Lu had played Psylocke<br /><br />3) Jean Claude Van Damme had played Gambit<br /><br />4) Characters were introduced in the right order<br /><br />5) Perhaps someone was brought in for the roll of Blob & Morph, with a little comedic relief, like John Goodman & Ryan Renolds.<br /><br />If all that had been done, Hollywood would've probably been able to get away with killing so many team members on each side, but that sucked too. It would've been great to see a rematch between Wolverine and Sabretooth.<br /><br />I've heard this is supposed to be the \\"Return Of The Jedi\\" conclusion for the X-men movies so I guess all of these flaws will remain unfixed.<br /><br />Better luck next time, Hollwood! Oh wait, that's right, they don't mind editting the story to make money.team members on each side, but that sucked too.

B000089RVX|5.0|I bought this CD after hearing Bring Me to Life on the radio. This was the first time i EVER bought a CD after hearing only one song, that's how impressed I was by the song.  And i'll say i was NOT disappointed in the least by the rest of the CD.  I was impressed to hear some heavier rock with a female singer that mangages to combine some intense music with a beautiful, feminine voice. <br /> <br />Going Under- 4.5/5 Not the best song on the CD, but really good nontheless. Interesting mix of a beautiful voice and dark tormented lyrics. <br />Bring Me to Life- 6/5  Don't know how else to rate a song this good.  Played all the time on the radio, but never got sick of it. More uplifing than the rest of the songs. <br />Everybody's Fool- 5/5  VERY good musically. Not sure what the lyrics mean, but a very good song regardless. <br />My Immortal-4/5 A very beautiful song, I'm just not into the slow type of song.  Shows Amy Lee's voice very well without much music to cover it up <br />Haunted- 4/5 Not the best on the CD.  Very haunted (haha) and dark sounding.   <br />Tourniquet-5/5 Probably the most depressing song on the CD, but the best musically.  Song sounds full of emotion and deals well with religion and suicide in one song without seeming overly religious. <br />Imaginary-5/5 weird topic for a song, an imaginary world, but shows off her beautiful voice really well. Great musically as well. <br />Taking Over Me- 5.5/5 Again, more than a perfect song.  What more can i say? <br />Hello-4/5  Again, not to thrilled with the slow song, but I LOVE her voice even if she manages to sound extremely depressing. <br />My Last Breath-6/5  More than perfect again.  One of the more emotional songs of the CD.  Manages to be a very pretty song even if it is about death. <br />Whisper-4.5/5 Not the best on the CD, but still good.  The music is more intense than some of the other songs.  The choir in the background got really annoying at the end of the song, but hey, who hears the end of the song that's last on the CD!
B00003CX8J|2.0|Hollywood made a good attempt. As both an X-men fan and an actor, I can understand complaints from both sides.<br /><br />The critic in me sees how characters were introduced in the wrong order (Beast and Angel came way before Wolverine or Storm). Some were even missing, such as Gambit. And then Toad and Sabretooth were killed, leaving Magneto with just Mystique.<br /><br />The actor in me understands how expensive it can get to travel all over, hosting auditions and gathering so many people together for a film, including big names that bring star-power to it: Patrick Stewart, Hugh Jackman, Halle Barry, etc.<br /><br />In the end, I feel the story of the X-men has been around far too long to be done in an incomplete manner.
0312319517|1.0|This book just doesn't have the credibility that Forsyth's earlier books carried. Possibly the credibility issue began with the publication of Icon, in which the hero brings about the return of the Russian Czars -- but with a heck of a lot of help. In Avenger, Cal Dexter succeeds against a whole array of opposing forces with very little help and far too great ease. The worst of his suffering is leeches attaching themselves to him during a swim and thirst. I think one person can succeed against difficult odds, but Cal Dexter just sails right through practically impossible odds with the eqivalent of just a few scratches.<br /><br />There is way too much background information about the United States and Russian governments including the CIA and KGB, the military, and the various political leaders (with much emphasis on the two Bush administrations.) There is so much background material that it greatly hurts the plot. I think the material on the political climate and extreme violence in Bosnia is appropriate, but we do not hear much from the actual bad guy. In fact, he only makes an appearance in the last few pages of the book, and doesn't offer a shred of violence when he does. It's very odd that the actual bad guy doesn't behave like a bad guy.<br /><br />In Icon, the hero uses an anatomical skeleton to trick his pursuers into believing him dead for a short time. In Avenger, Cal Dexter uses the trick for the same purpose, but the method is a lot more complex and harder for the reader to believe. Only the skeptical Deveraux checks further into the supposedly picked-clean skeleton found in the jungle. This, too, is hard to believe. Aren't these anatomical skeletons held together with wire? Wouldn't the presence of wire give the game away? Only one bone in the skeleton is actually broken; wouldn't a feeding animal break at least a few more for the marrow?<br /><br />In Icon, the bad guy's security chief commits horror after horror throughout the plot. We learn of how he tortures people. He has the unfortunate secretary Akopov drowned. Later, the old cleaner is beaten to death on his orders. In Avenger, the bad guy himself is nonviolent. It is hard to believe he is a sadistic killer because we don't see him in action until the very end of the book, and then his action is limited to complete surrender after a few bribe attempts. Not seeing the bad guy in action hurts the book most of all, because we need to build sympathy for Cal Dexter as he hunts for him. We need constant reminders of the bad guy's ongoing cruelty and killing. We need to see him actively being bad, but we don't.<br /><br />Unlike Day of the Jackal, this book doesn't have a shred of romance. The Jackal has wonderful bedroom scenes with the Countess, but kills her when she stumbles into his rifle. Jacqueline, the French beauty whose beloved boyfriend was killed in action, readily agrees to become the mistress of a high French official in order to supply the Jackal with vital information. We also see another romantic subplot in The Fist of God where one of Saddam's top generals is seduced for months by a beautful mistress before being caught writing notes of their bed talk. Cal Dexter doesn't have a shred of romantic interest in anyone. There isn't a single suggestion of romance throughout the book. And the book suffers from it. A romantic subplot would greatly add to the interest quotient.<br /><br />Could this book, like James Clavell's Gai-Jin, mark Forsyth's decline as a writer?

0792846443|5.0|I love this film! It really does justice to Stephen King's novel (which I just Finished recently). I say that this is better than the book because it is alot less bloodier. The story works alot better without most of the gore. I still would have liked to seen the scene when Annie uses a lawnmower to kill a young policeman. I would not have laughed at it. It would have been nice to have it included as an extra.
B00005JOFQ|2.0|I don't know what it is about films like this one or another \\"head-scratcher\\" from a few years back, \\"A Beautiful Mind\\", that gets audiences and even some critics so stirred up, but they are certainly not what might be considered noteworthy. Now, this film is actually very beautifully shot. The scenery is just breathtaking. In fact, I constantly found my mind and my eye being drawn to the composition of the shots and grandeur of the landscapes, leaving me completely bored by the melodrama being played out in it's proscenium. There is one award worthy, performance in the film given by Michelle Williams as the betrayed wife of one of the two leads. Her characterization was strong, sympathetic and very moving overall. What I find the most interesting about all the excitement surrounding this film is that there was another film out this year with a similar plot line and situation to this film entitled, \\"The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada\\". It was also about cowboys and concerned relationships, honor and duty, but without the homosexual angle that I feel was exploited in \\"Brokeback\\". \\"Three Burials....\\" was an extremely well made film but, sadly, without the tabloid sensationalism and hype lavished on \\"Brokeback\\", it remained relatively obscure and unnoticed by the general movie going public. But all that hype did not garner this film a Best Picture award and this may be a sign that the Academy members are finally starting to be a little more discerning of which films are bestowed that honor. Granted, \\"Crash\\" ended up with best picture and best song went to \\"It's Hard Out Here For A Pimp\\", so there is clearly still room for improvement. And so, I turn my head towards the future with hopes for better offerings in the coming year and on down the road.
B00008977N|3.0|I really love Peter Gabriel.  Unlike a lot of newer fans, I've followed his career since he was fronting Genesis with songs like \\"The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway.\\"  Most people now don't even remember Genesis, much less when Peter Gabriel was their lead singer.<br /><br />It took quite a few years after his departure from Genesis before his solo career really took off, but I was totally fascinated with ALL the tracks on his \\"Security\\" album (that was the one that included the hit \\"Shock the Monkey\\").  I bought \\"So\\" within days after its U.S. release, sight unseen, and when I listened to it, I knew that P.G. had finally blown it open completely, and that this record was going to be a MAJOR smash for him.  Sure enough, over the next year or two that album went multi-platinum, and the rest is history.  Blockbuster hits from \\"So,\\" like \\"Sledgehammer,\\" \\"Don't Give Up,\\" \\"Mercy Street\\" and \\"In Your Eyes,\\" have since received the critical and popular praise they so richly deserve, and P.G.'s well-earned place in rock history has finally been firmly established.<br /><br />The \\"Secret World\\" concert memorialized in this particular DVD showcases P.G. at the zenith of his popularity and musical power.  The music is awesome.  The live presentation was clearly solid, imaginative and highly entertaining.  However, the technical execution on both the video and audio is surprisingly weak for an artist of P.G.'s caliber!<br /><br />On the video, whether due to atmospheric conditions in the concert hall, or the film and lighting techniques employed, there is no question that the video quality is not so hot.  The images are grainy, and the overall cinematography (use of camera angles, lighting, sequencing) seems only average, at best.<br /><br />On the audio, I noticed DRAMATIC variances and \\"dropouts\\" in the levels, apparently an \\"artifact,\\" or leftover, from either \\"overproducing\\" (e.g., by post-production sound guys playing with their toys) or plain poor equalization/compression techniques used in connection with preparation of the soundtrack for DVD mass production.  In my view, the DVD soundtrack should be every bit as good, if not better, than the audio soundtrack alone.

B00005JLIU|3.0|Still flush with the rapture of seeing \\"Mary Poppins\\" and \\"The Sound of Music\\", my parent bundled us all up and took the entire family to see this, then new, Julie Andrews picture at a posh first run movie house in Washington D. C. The Uptown. I had not seen the film since then and had little memory of it except the creepy lady with the chopsticks in her hair, the dancing to make the elevator operate and the ominous squeaky wheel on the cart that comes to carry away the recently abducted and their possessions. Other than that I was a fairly uninterested ten year old and was ready to leave quickly. My parents didn't find the story nearly as suited to families as Julie's previous triumphs and, (remember this is 1967) happily agreed to let me wait outside the theater for them until the show ended. Ironically, I spent the last part of this \\"non family-oriented\\" show out in front of the Uptown theater with a fake cigarette I had brought with me, pretending to smoke using my own breath combined with the cold, November air as the smoke, and hoping to shock all those who pass by. Flash forward to a fairly uninterested 49 year old who was still ready to leave quickly. I tried, for a while, but soon found myself fidgeting like I did nearly 40 years ago and soon I was in the other room paying bills while the movie droned on and on. Oh, the cast was great. Julie was superb as always and Beatrice Lillie was wonderful as Mrs. Meeks. Mary Tyler Moore was cute but added little to the mix and Carol Channing just always makes my flesh crawl. Also, the big slapstick climax was embarrassingly terrible in both staging and timing, coming off worse than an old Three Stooges short, much worse because I love the Three Stooges. But, frankly, the problem with this film is that, even without the Overture and Intermission, it's just THOROUGHLY too long.
B00005JOVH|3.0|***WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS*** <br /> <br />     First off, despite my above warning, I will truly try my best to keep this review as spoiler free as possible, however I may not be entirely successful.  Now, I've just come back from seeing X-Men: The Last Stand with a few of my friends.  Coming out of the theatre, my reactions to the movie were decidedly mixed.  Overall, I thought it was good action movie with some spectacular special effects, and great acting by everyone involved.  On the other hand, I could not help but feel cheated (and in a couple of cases pissed off) at what the writers did to some of the characters.  To casual movie goers, what happened to some of the characters in the movie may not have that much impact.  But, as someone who grew up with the X-men from a young age, I couldn't help but feel a little angry. <br /> <br />     X-Men: The Last Stand's story revolves around the discovery of a cure for the mutant condition, which can supposedly turn a mutant into a normal human permanently.  Magneto sees this as a threat to himself, and the entire mutant race.  He personally takes it upon himself to unite all mutants under a common \\"Brotherhood\\" and destroy this cure.  Also, Jean Grey is resurrected as the all powerful Phoenix.  However, with her new found powers comes a near uncontrollable rage, and Magneto attempts to use Jean for his purposes.  The X-Men have to band together to stop Magneto before he starts a war that can tear apart the world. <br /> <br />     As usual, almost all the actors and actresses turn in another solid performance for this movies.  Hugh Jackman gives a solid and convincing performance as Wolverine.  Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen also deserve high marks for their portrayal as Professor Xavier and Magneto respectively.  I also enjoyed Kelsey Grammer's turn as the intelligent and ferocious Beast.  Acting has never been my primary concern with action movies, but with the X-Men movies, good acting is one of the movies'high points. <br /> <br />     Of course, most people don't go to an X-Men movie to see Oscar worthy performances.  They come for hard-hitting action and cool special effects, which The Last Stand definitely delivers on.  Arguably the most impressive sequence in the whole movie is when Magneto uses his powers to separate a section of the Golden Gate Bridge to create a walkway to Alcatraz.  A lot of work must have gone into that sequence, because it looked absolutely fantastic.  The final fight scene between the X-Men and Magneto's Brotherhood was also spectacular.  Seeing the powers of so many mutants being used in one place was very satisfying.  On a related note, I was surprised at what good a fighter the Beast was in this movie.  There was no indication to his fighting ability throughout most of the movie, but seeing him let loose towards the end was great. <br /> <br />     However, the fact that we see so many mutants fighting each other also highlights one of the movie's weaknesses...that being there are TOO many mutants to keep track of.  For example, even though the character of Angel is featured prominently in the movie trailers, his appearances in The Last Stand are fairly brief and infrequent.  At times, it feels like the plotlines of too many characters are being crammed into the movie, which is especially apparent considering this movie is only 104 minutes long.  As such, we do not delve as deeply as we could into the characters, which is a shame considering how much history and depth most of them have.   <br /> <br />     Now you also might be wondering, what is it about what happened to some of the characters that could make me a little irate.  Well, for that, I'm going to have to put on my X-Men nerd cap on...and go off on a little rant, so please bear with me.  I could talk for while about what happened to several of the characters in the movie, but for the interests of time, I'll just focus on one character in particular...Cyclops.  (Again, I'll try to keep the spoilers down, but if you don't want to know anything about what happened to any of the characters, please skip to the last paragraph)  Personally, Cyclops is my favourite character in the entire X-Men universe.  In the comics (and even the Fox cartoon show), he is portrayed as a strong and dedicated leader, who is willing to sacrifice himself for the good of the team.  I have always felt that Cyclops was underused in the first two X-men movies, but this is especially true in The Last Stand.  With the rise of Jean Grey's Phoenix powers, here was an opportunity to finally utilize Cyclops as a character, considering the relationship between the two.  This does not happen.  Instead, Cyclops exits the scene very early in the movie.  What was particularly jarring was how abrupt and unfitting his exit from The Last Stand was.  Now, I know that Cyclops' character isn't everyone's cup of tea, but everyone I've talked to agrees that his character, as well as other characters, were treated pretty poorly in the movie. <br /> <br />     There have been whispers and rumours flying around that, other than the Wolverine movie, there could be fourth X-Men movie.  As much as it really hurts me to say this, I hope these rumours are untrue.  You'll understand what I mean when you go see the movie, because what happens in it does not lend itself to another X-Men sequel.  In the end, I still liked X-Men: The Last Stand and I still recommend this movie, especially to fans of the series.  It has good acting, and even better action sequences.  However, I will agree with many reviewers that The Last Stand is definitely the weakest in the trilogy.   <br /> <br />I give X-Men: The Last Stand a 7.5/10.   <br />
B00006JMQG|4.0|This is certainly one of the most interesting silent films of the time period.  Unusual story line, beautiful use of light and shadows and very artistic sets all askew as if from a Dr Seuss illustration.  Whether you are into German Expressionism or not, this is an entertaining movie to watch.  The score for this edition was absolutely horrid- synthesizer and electric guitar-that does not go with the movie at all. After muting the sound the movie was great.
B00005JOHC|5.0|For once, Australia actually has something first.  We have this first season on DVD and I love it.

B000ENC67S|5.0|I was hesitant about this movie for one reason. From the previews I saw I figured it depicted gay men in a negative light by getting married and eventually hurting the women and children they belonged to. But I was wrong. <br />This movie isn't about that. It is about love, plain and simple. <br />There aren't the descriptives here to express the ability this movie has to move you. <br />The acting is stellar from all. The story is excellent and carried out very well on screen. The cinematography is breathtaking at times and the music truly reflects the mood. <br />The basic theme of this movie is that love will strike in it's own time, and with whomever it deems is 'the one'. The love that struck the two main characters here was taboo and they do the best they can to quell the fire within them. When the realization hits that it's bigger than the mountain they met on they meet throughout the rest of their lives to satiate the need they have for each other. <br />The angst, confusion, identity issues and all the other problems that would go with a 'taboo' love are what carry this movie. <br />An unlikely forerunner in the award category, this movie is destined to be a classic. It has all the right elements. <br />If you have been hesitant to watch this movie because of the theme do yourself a favor.... rent it and watch it. It has a lot to say about life and love.
B00005JOVH|4.0|X3 was one of the movies I was looking forward to seeing this year and I was somewhat pleased.  There were many ups, but some downs that almost ruined the movie.<br /><br />So the pros.  The acting was nicely done, Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry and others did an above and beyond performance given the stigma of bad acting in Marvel pictures (ie: Fantastic Four).  I was very pleased with Hugh Jackman's performance as Wolverine as he assumed command during critical parts of the movie.<br /><br />As to the plot, the movie started out somewhat slow as events built up, then sped up dramatically and ended just as quickly.  It almost seemed as though the entire movie was being built up for this one final 15-minute showdown.  It was somwhat disapointing.  The plot also killed more main characters than a Quentin Terrentino movie as main heroes were almost being picked off from beginning to end, one by one.<br /><br />Lastly on the plot... I don't think X3 was meant as the finishing movie for the X-Men franchise.  The ending (like many trilogies try to do) sets you up for a sequel as Magneeto's ending has a cliffhanger and STAY AFTER THE CREDITS to see another one with another main character.  I think Stan Lee is setting us up for a sequel... and I was disapointed with how it was done.<br /><br />One of the other things I wish the director did was allow more time for character developement.  There were two characters I never caught the name of... until I read reviews online.  The two characters being Calypso and that girl that walked through walls... forgot her name again.  Also, there was no clarification on Wolverine's past.  Granted I watched the series, read the comics etc, etc and I know a little, but I think it would've been nice for the general audience.<br /><br />Then there's the consistency errors.  Any fans of the series knows that Juggarnut is technically NOT a mutant but apperantly he was taken down because his \\"powers\\" were leeched.  I was pleased, however, to see the producers remembered that Hank (Beast) likes to read upsidedown and to include the Danger Room.<br /><br />Pertaining to the visuals... nothing but impressive and the display of mutant powers was incredible.  I have officially dubbed Storm as the Sith Lord of the X-Men world... watch how she deals with her nemisis in the showdown to see what I mean.  They also showed the true form of Iceman, which was also nice and even Pyro's weapons.  For fans, this'll defintely make things more enjoyable to watch.<br /><br />The one real thing I wish was they had more Angel sequences since he was one of the first characters introduced in the introduction... and of course... I WANT GAMBIT!!  I don't care if Stan Lee says he's a shallow character, Gambit is awesome.<br /><br />All in all, an 85% and a solid movie to boot.  One worthy of my movie collection when it comes out on DVD.  The general audience, families and fanboys alike will enjoy this film if they STAY UNTIL THE END OF THE CREDITS!!however, to see the producers remembered that Hank (Beast) likes to read upsidedown and to include the Danger Room.   <br /> <br />Pertaining to the visuals... nothing but impressive and the display of mutant powers was incredible.

As I got older, I started researching faith and religion, beliefs and the history of Christianity. What I found out was enough to shatter the illusion of God.<br /><br />Sam Harris writes about those doubts that trickle through the minds of many people. He shows the dangers of holding onto beliefs that were started thousands of years ago when our knowledge of the world included a flat earth, boring holes in our heads to relieve evil, and immaculate conceptions!<br /><br />We find our nation taking backwards steps as we hold onto outdated and ancient beliefs. Sam Harris shows us where this has led us to date and the dangers we face in the future if we don't have the courage to smarten up!<br /><br />I challenge you to read this book and consider its contents with an open mind!
B000FQJAIW|1.0|Without the 1977 version of Star Wars, George Lucas would be just another filmmaker, ILM would be just another effects shop and Skywalker Ranch would be a few acres of undeveloped land in Marin County. <br /> <br />The original theatrical version may not be the film George Lucas believes he wanted to make.  He may be be embarrassed by it now, but for millions of fans, this version has been more than good enough.  If it was so bad, George, why did so many people see it a dozen times in the theater?  Why did it play in the theaters for almost a full year without interruption? <br /> <br />The 1997 and 2004 \\"special\\" editions did not make you a billionaire.  This version did and it's time you showed it the respect it deserves, like a fully anamophic transfer on DVD instead of an inferior 13 year copy of a laserdisc.
B00005JO20|5.0|Jackson shined in this movie as I expected, never a dull moment. I actually felt for Kong and going into the movie I didn't think I could feel for a cgi (or whatever they use these days) created character like that, but I did. The effects were amazing, Skull Island was actually scary as hell; the cast was perfect, even Jack Black did a great job, he added that touch of comedy that was needed. Another genius film by Jackson, loved it.  <br /> <br />And about the time length, people are never happy, you give them a short film and they want a longer one, give them a long film, they still complain. So if you're reading the time length complaints, it's not a problem, you won't even take your eyes off the screen...atleast I didn't.
0226264211|4.0|This book probably should not be treated as \\"capitalist manifesto\\" a la Marx but more like an attempt to present a position opposite to famous Galbraith \\"The Affluent Society\\" (1958). Reading the book without reading Galbraith first creates an impression of cheap advocacy of market fundamentalism (unregulated market aka \\"socialism for banks\\") almost in best libertarian (anarcho-capitalist) style. But as a polemic with Galbraith vision of post-capitalism (post-industrial society) the book looks like an interesting albeit deeply flawed historical document. Actually Friedman's Economic Determinism -- the idea that economic freedom creates political freedom -- can be considered to be a flavor of Marxist Economic Determinism. Both postulate that economic forces (market in case of Friedman) drive societies either to the Liberal Democratic Ideal (a la Fukuyama) or to the Communist Ideal.<br /><br />In his book Galbraith stressed that to become successful, post-WWII America should invest heavily in infrastructure (highways, phone infrastructure, etc) as well as education using funds from general taxation and government intervention. At the same time he felt that the government power should be balanced against the power of capitalists using some countervailing forces (he mistakenly assumed that unions can play such a role). He also noted that large companies are actually exempted from competition on a national level because they are closely linked with the state and competition is limited to small companies (and most of their profits are expropriated by banks, landlords and state). In essence he argued that the USA society is no longer a capitalist society but some different dualistic social organization that combines elements of socialism (government bailout of large banks -- \\"too big to fail\\" aka \\"Greenspan put\\") for the largest firms with limited \\"free market\\" capitalism for small fish. Many argue that GM troubles proved that Galbraith was wrong. But if you look at GM problems it's clear that it was not national competitors who squeezed Detroit.<br /><br />While definitely intellectually weaker (and somewhat corrupt in best CATO \\"researchers\\" and Heritage foundation traditions  ;-), Friedman nevertheless was the most intellectually astute opponent of Galbraith post-industrial society vision. The problem of his book and his vision is that along with constructive idea of the danger of excessive government intervention he throws the baby out with the bath water and declares that market is a completely self-regulating organism, which is a very dangerous utopia. In this respect he reminds me fringe pseudo-religious figures like Rasputin.<br /><br />Such an exaggeration of value of deregulation might have value at the time when the books was published as a defense of capitalism when the USSR was still present of the world stage. But this free market Utopism completely inadequate and very dangerous today. In it undeniable that market forces served and will continue in the foreseeable future to serve a constructive role in the history of mankind. For example, the great virtue of the market is that it enables people who hate each other to cooperate economically, serving as a powerful antidote to nationalism.<br /><br />But history teaches us that absolutization of \\"free market\\" and weakening of regulation of financial institutions logically lead to dominance of financial oligarchy and such side effects as \\"corrupt markets\\" with rampant financial speculation, insider trading and stagnant economy (casino capitalism.) The latter logically leads to events like the crash of 1927. Combination of weak regulation of financial institutions with fiat currency is especially dangerous cocktail as it enables reckless levels of leverage, levels that endanger the stability and well being of the whole society. In a way \\"free market\\" = \\"corrupt markets\\".<br /><br />Failing to understand the necessity of regulation of banks and capital markets for the maintaining of the health of \\"free market\\" is a most serious, grave flaw of the book which make it outdated, naive and dangerous \\"preaching\\". We need \\"fair market\\" more then we need \\"free market\\". The latter is just a codeword for unlimited power of banks, the power that has nothing to do with freedom and nothing to do with fairness. It is is a just a variant of a dictatorship (\\"inverted totalitarism\\") much like any communist dictatorship.<br /><br />In reality the term masks a blatant attempt of redistribution of wealth in best communist tradition with banksters instead of commissars. Friedman was either unable to understand that or continuously played the role of fifth column (I suspect the latter).  Due to this grave flaw most of the content of the book is completely detached from reality and most chapters sound like a draft of yet another utopia. Sometimes the level of radicalism of this advocate of \\"free market\\" (free as in \\"absence of regulation\\") suggests that he is closer to socialists (especially Trotskyites) then conservatives and from defender of \\"status quo\\" logically turns into promoter of a new, radical and rather dangerous social utopia, an economic messiah who preaches that unregulated market + fiat money used with a specific rule of money stock expansion (3-5% per year) will save mankind (\\"In Goldman Sacks we trust\\" bonanza using Galbraith catch phase).<br /><br />Simultaneous advocacy of free market and fiat money (if printing press controlled by government guess who is controlling the markets) a way makes Friedman's views very similar to Marxists (extremes meet), although his utopia proved to be definitely less costly for mankind. In this sense his Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel (often incorrectly called Nobel Prize in Economics) looks somewhat strange. With fiat currencies  all businesses are hostages of the government.  And the ability to switch money printing press to full speed any time the government finds convenient (usually to cover war expenses) provides an easy way of confiscation of wealth of people by government without any communist coup d'état. How stable is the world of fiat currencies remain to be seen.<br /><br />It is interesting to note that governments which the most loudly claim that they are proponents of \\"free market\\" actually behave more like \\"Military Keynesians\\" then sincere \\"free market\\" advocates. Just look at the actions of Bush administration  after the dot-com bust. The same was true for Reagan administration. Actually it was during Reagan's years when conservatism adopted the banner of \\"free markets\\" and had grown into more and more dangerously Utopian social vision ready for dangerous experiments with society. In this sense Friedman's book played important role in crystallization of new type of social radicalism, radicalism that has potential of destabilizing the society in a way Marxism, Corporatism and Maoism did in the past. It's funny that it was Bush administration that  bestowed on Friedman the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Evil people might claim that it was done for his role in abandoning gold standard...<br /><br />Friedman's arguments that planning and regulation are unnecessary and that market forces have built-in checks and balances and can do wonders if they are freed from any and all government intervention can be understood seriously only in context of polemics with the representative of the opposite extreme views (statists). For readers in 2006 and especially European readers it's clear that Friedman's views of the market are anti-historic and \\"free/unregulated market\\" described in the book never existed and probably will never exist in human history. Actually the level of ignorance of the history demonstrated in the book make it even closer to a typical Utopia.<br /><br />The truth is that if government regulation weakens below certain threshold we get reckless speculation and orgy of excessive leverage along with some other \\"externalities\\" (\\"S&L\\" or like Enron-style corruption). In a way bubbles are natural side effects of activity of financial institutions in unregulated markets. The fact that all those newly minted robber barons and buy-out princes run for government cover with the first signs of credit market crunch demonstrates that market never exists in vacuum and always is intrinsically connected and always experience significant level of control/support by the government (level much greater then roles of an arbiter of disputes and the provider of the currency presuppose). For large financial players \\"free market\\" means private profits along with \\"socially ensured\\" risk (in the form of government bailout of the most reckless players with taxpayers money). This is famous \\"too big to fail\\", or \\"Greenspan put\\" problem. So there are obvious contradictions inherent in fundamentalist \\"free market\\" argumentation and that converts Milton Friedman into reckless and dangerous preacher of a new Utopia and a member of fifth column of financial oligarchy.<br /><br />Real conservatism should respect the status quo, not try to change the economic landscape in arbitrary untested ways. It's really unfortunate that unlike Maestro Greenspan, Friedman managed to avoid getting the Enron Award for Distinguished Public Service for his services. It should be noted that lately Freeman himself abandoned his \\"monetarist views\\" (and that makes chapter III, one of the central chapters of the book just a historical curiosity). But unfortunately Britain and particularly xUSSR and Eastern European countries already served as guinea pigs for his utopia. As for implementing Friedman's \\"free market\\" and other economic utopias I would like to quote German \\"Iron Chancellor\\" Otto von Bismarck. When one of German parliamentarians proposed to implement socialism in Germany he make a biting remark: \\"OK, let's do it. But let's first choose for this experiment a country, that we do not care about\\".<br /><br />Market is andalways has been a regulated construction of government, not some kind of state of nature without it. Indeed without proper regulation to maintain a fair and transparent market, it is doomed to inefficiency, injustice, and abuse including anti-market, monopolistic behaviour of major players.
B00003CX8J|4.0|Even when I was really into comics more than a few years ago, the X-Men just never really appealed to me.  Maybe it was the fact that I really didn't know the story behind each character; that was certainly one of the issues I had with this film.  Granted, my encounters with the X-Men have been few and far between, but I've just never seen much of anything behind any of the characters other than Dr. Charles Xavier and Wolverine.  I followed Wolverine during the first couple of years of his first solo comic, largely because he was a complicated, mysterious, deadly character with great depth and passion, a man still trying to discover what he truly was.  Despite his mutant powers, Wolverine always comes across as a human being, with all the positives and negatives that implies.  Without him, I can't connect with any of the other mutants, so I think the filmmakers definitely had the right idea when they used Wolverine as their cinematic conduit to the viewing public.<br /><br />This is a rather unusual film, in that it was obviously written with sequels in mind - there's not a very big sense of completion to this film at all.  Not only does it refrain from supplying some important answers, it doesn't even get around to asking all of the questions yet.  The first half of the movie basically serves to introduce us to all the major players.  Even still, I feel like I know next to nothing about Storm (Halle Berry) and Cyclops (James Marsden); in actuality, I can't work up much of a reason to even care about those two very much.  I have to wonder, though, if Cyclops is supposed to be so annoyingly prissy; Marsden seems to be channeling a Footloose-era Tom Cruise, which made it impossible for me to like his character.  I can't complain about the two heavyweights in this particular arena, though.  Patrick Stewart adds an important air of believability to a story that could have easily stumbled down the road toward campiness, while Ian McKellan - a rather surprising choice to play Magneto, I feel - actually brings gravitas to a role that seems quite beneath him.  The special effects are quite impressive, and the story is interesting enough, but I'm not sure this film would have worked without Stewart and McKellan.<br /><br />As I mentioned earlier, I tend to look upon this (for the most part) as Wolverine's movie.  Hugh Jackman pretty much nails his character, in terms of both the look and the attitude.  Despite his personal preference for solitude, Wolverine's the one who helps Rogue out when she's trying to find her bearings; most of what we learn about Dr. Jean Grey (Famke Jannsen) and Cyclops are a direct result of the connection he makes with Grey; he is the one who draws the most important information out of Dr. Xavier, etc.  The movie doesn't really bring this out, but Wolverine also has a special rivalry with Sabretooth (Tyler Mane, who doesn't do the character a whole lot of justice to my eyes).<br /><br />In terms of the plot, you basically watch Logan and Rogue slowly make a place for themselves among the X-Men, eventually coming together with Grey, Cyclops, and Storm to prevent Xavier's old, wayward buddy Magneto from succeeding in his dastardly plan to establish the dominance of mutants over human society - even if it means inciting a war between humans and mutants.  Honestly, it isn't the most impressive script I've ever seen, basically putting the ultimate fate of the film in the hands of the actors and actresses bringing the story to life.  Some darn good casting really saved the day here.neto, I feel - actually brings gravitas to a role that seems quite beneath him.

B00005JOVH|3.0|Sheesh! Did enough people get shamelessly killed off in this one? Although Cyclops is only \\"presumed\\" dead since they didn't find a body, even though he's hardly had any airtime in the last movie either accept for being brainwashed or wussying on about Jean being \\"presumedly\\" dead. As for Prof. X's bit at the end, since his body was destroyed, he must've downloaded his consciousness into a comatose body in the facility where Dr. MacTaggert was working at. Jean could of course probably come back too since she's been resurrected more times than Jason, Freddy Kreuger, and Jesus combined!<br /><br />They did a pretty good deal with the extended mutant cast. Although they didn't explain how Beast was in human form in X2, and now he's fully-furry. Callisto got way too many powers from her comic counterpart. Psylocke was dumbed down alot as far as her powers too. Nice to see Multiple Man. Shadowcat finally gets some decent airtime, although it would've been cool to see Jubilee too. Angel was fair, even if he is one of the more boring X-Men. And Juggernaut just rocked! Don't care if he's not really a mutant, that was just gold! It would've been nice if they bothered saying whether Toad or Sabertooth were still alive or not from the first flick, or where the hell Nightcrawler was.<br /><br />For the original cast, they brought this whole darker side to Prof. X that actually made Magneto's side look like the fair one. Magneto was a cold prick though after what happened to Mystique(\\"That's my slave name!\\"), and him being turned human would've been an act worse than death for him, which might've only been temporary on high-class mutants. Iceman finally ices up, although I don't remember his clothes being visible before when he did that. Rouge pretty much wussed out at the last minute, which I don't know why she's at the Xavier Institute since she's human now. Cyclops just was a whiney bitch as usual. They just couldn't write anything interesting for him after the first movie. Jean's version of the Phoenix's is more like something out of a Stephen King novel. I half-expected to see the 666 sign on her forehead. And...Mystique's a brunette? Say what?<br /><br />Even though alot of reports had come in claiming that this is the last X-flick, they left a big enough room for more. I saw in an interview with the director Brett Ratner about why he doesn't want to do an X4. He said \\"because there's never been a good Part 4 of a movie franchise\\". Uh...hello. Star Wars: Episode Iv-A New Hope ring any bells? Plus, Star Trek 4 which was the best of the classic Trek movies. Hell, even Rocky IV wasn't too bad!e.

B00026W82U|5.0|Firstly I would like to disagree, with both amazon and some of the other reviewers on here claiming their sound to be unoriginal and comparable to Belle & Sebastian. I have an enormous music collection that is beyond excessive and yet I have declared Kings of Convenience as my favorite band of all; and rightly so with the most play counts in iTunes. I never write music reviews, but I've made an exception for this.<br /><br />No matter what mood I'm in Kings of Convenience feels right. Whether going to sleep, feeling low, chilling with friends, or doing homework it doesn't matter, once you put their album on you are automatically in a relaxed and reflective mood. You will think of past loves, you will think of your cat, curled up in a ball on the couch, you will think of happy times, sad times, you will think of how much longer that candle will burn for, you will think.<br /><br />Now I do not say all this out of a biased worship, I am simply sharing my own personal experience with this music, everyday I listen to new music, and I have yet to find anything comparable. It may take a while to grow on you, but once you realize what you've been missing, you too will be glad you added it to your collection.<br /><br />Out of all three albums my favorite is \\"Quiet is the New Loud\\", and if you do become a fan the \\"Versus\\" cd is a must, while I didn't appreciate it at first it is essential and actually quite good after a few listens.
B000002I2G|5.0|Although the critics never really liked this one, I think it's one of the Doors most creative albums. They get very experimental here exploring different sounds and instruments and even throwing in a little bluegrass influence. This is why the critics didn't like it.  <br /> <br />At the time this was made, great bands like the Beatles were pushing music to its limits and trying out new sounds, instruments and influences. The Doors' members, being the highly intelligent beings that they are, were no different and wanted to push the boundaries and move their music forward to the next level. I think they succeed here and it's too bad that more songs from this one weren't/aren't played on the radio. If you like the Doors or just want something interesting to listen to, try this one.  <br />
0670034711|3.0|In this book the author relates how she was shattered and depressed during the last portion of her marriage and the divorce that followed.  Finally, she decides to turn her life around by taking a year off and eating food in Italy, staying in her guru's ashram in India, and visiting a wise old medicine man in Indonesia.  This is the story of her quest for enlightenment and peace. <br /> <br />Quote: \\"Look for God, suggests my Guru.  Look for God like a man with his head on fire looks for water.\\" <br /> <br />My feelings about this book are really mixed.  I thought the writing was excellent- right amount of detail, witty, charming, funny, but still the story itself often lagged and was only saved by the good writing.  I expected the book to be more focused on the travels of this woman through Italy, India, and Indonesia- I didn't realize it was so centered around her quest for enlightenment.  I got very tired during the chapter about studying in her guru's compound in India, although I do admit that I might have a lingering bias against guru's after reading My Life in Orange earlier this year.  I enjoyed the Indonesia chapter the most (the Italy chapter was entertaining, but so narrow!  I like gelato as much as anyone, but there are other nice things in the country too).

If you want to really see a wide variety of musical acts from many genres push the limits of their own talent with songs from one of the best songwriters around, get this one.<br /><br />Take the lineup from the Concert for Bangladesh and add more musicians and you've got a major musical fete here. Outstanding performances by George Harrison, Eric Clapton, Neil Young (maybe the best one), Johnny Winter, Johnny Cash and his family, Willie Nelson and many more. You'll love it.

I'm not moved to post reviews very often but the spectacular scope that this novel manages to cover, along with initmate development of a large array of characters as well as leading a wild ride through an amazing city and country has motivated me.  The writing is so vivid that I feel I have lived the story.   Roberts manages to inspire the full gamut of emotions as well as introducing some absolutey beautiful prose and observations on philosophy and the things that motivate us all.  Can not wait for his next work.
B00006HAZG|5.0|David Copperfield is a wonderful BBC miniseries which boasts an all-star cast--Maggie Smith, Bob Hoskins, Daniel Radcliffe (a young Harry Potter!), and Emilia Fox, just to name a few. It is a first-rate production and should appeal to a wide audience (very family friendly).<br /><br />In David Copperfield viewers see young David grow from a helpless child abused by his stepfather to a self assured young man. Along the way there are storylines filled with some of the most vivid and interesting supporting characters in literature:  David's eccentric Aunt Betsey Trotwood, the eternal debtor Macawber, and the Copperfield's ever faithful and loving servant Pegaty are only a sample of the wonderful characters and roles. Joanna Page also does a wonderful job as Dora Spindlow, playing her with a sweet naiivity.<br /><br />My only complaint is that I just didn't want young David played by Daniel Radcliffe to grow up! Radcliffe was perfect in his role, and while the adult David wasn't a bad actor, I felt that they could have cast someone a little more appropriate for the role. However, this complaint is only minor and there are more than enough good things about the miniseries to make up for it.<br /><br />I strongly urge all movie lovers to watch David Copperfield. They will not be disappointed!
B000ETQRCM|5.0|As a band that has been around enough time to be praised and trashed throughout their career by media and so called music experts, Pearl Jam is still able to prove that they are the ones to set the trend mark in rock.  <br />This album is the living proof of PJ's maturity and their knowledge (that only time can give) of what rock music should sound like. <br />Intensity, crazy guitar riffs, monster drum playing and Eddie's vocals switching off the pace at the right moment of each song. Lyrics fall down a little, but it's like if they know now that music is the message, not so much the words. <br />Using every trick on the book, PJ has pulled off the record that could and probably will put them back on the top. <br />Only thing lacking here...a Black or Immortality kind of ballad to put the melancholy vibe. <br /> <br />In sum, buy this, enjoy it and forget everything you thought you knew about this Seattle's band. <br />
B0009WFFS6|5.0|Can I be more specific about what these concerts made for my musical inspiration? <br />It's all about the music, about playing well and bringing it to the people. The production is very good, though spliting it in two DVDs made it impossible to give it the 6 stars as well (fact, the HD and DTS advantages have to take their toll). Sounding great, looking like there really is technology in use today. <br />Thanks guys, I'll be wearing my DVDs' double layers off. <br />
B000003TA4|5.0|Nirvana's 1991 album Nevermind is still one of the '90s best albums to me. It just jumped right out of left field. I didn't hear it until 1992, but I was just blown away by the riffs and well recorded songs.  There's a rawness to this album that doesn't let go!  Smells Like Teen Spirit is still fresh 15 years later, as well as Lithium, Polly, the more poppish Come as You Are, On A Plane and others. One of two surprises that also stand out is Territorial, which zooms so fast at 115 mph in its sound and how they slow the speed down dramatically as if a record player is turned off. Kurt Cobain's screaming like crazy after the first minute. It sounds as if you're hearing the guitars mashed right up very close to the amplifiers, all the screeches and the like!  It makes for a great song without the typical formulaic verse/chorus/verse songs we're used to hearing.  Another surprise is the quiet ballad, Something in the Way and its acoustic feel. Melodic and well written. I never thought that Nirvana would pull it off on that song--I thought they were mostly loud all the time, but this is one of their best songs from their catalog. The album's Kurt Cobain all throughout, but Dave Grohl and Krist Novoselic were superb on the lead guitars and drums that dominate this effort. It has really had an impact on Dave's current success with the Foo Fighters.  The songwriting from Cobain was different, but top notch. After Nevermind, nearly every alternative band except Pearl Jam was copying its sounds and textures.  Some succeeded and some failed. This album helped make alternative music dominate 6 years of the '90s, yet it balanced well with the R&B ballads, rap, dance and pop artists that dominated the decade. Although Cobain is no longer with us, this album keeps his and his band's spirit completely alive. Ten to 20 years from now, they're still going to be talking about this album. Kurt didn't expect the multi-platinum success it got, but people still love it, still buy it and are still playing it. It is one of the 20th century's best albums, artistic, aggressive and chance taking.
B00005JOVH|4.0|After reading a few of these Amazon reviews about this X-men movie, I'm surprise to hear that there may be more than one version of a secret clip after the long end credits. I watched the movie on opening day and at the end of the credits, my version wasn't about Magneto or Wolverine. You'll just have to see it for yourself.
B000000H66|5.0|This album along with Sound Of Perseverance has a style more akin to the Melodic Death Metal genre with more melodic guitar lines, and progressive tunes. Chuck Schuldiner moves to a more higher pitched shrieking compared to the early Death CDs. This is definitely a must have for Death fans and metal fans period. The guitars amaze me so much and it's not that whole \\"make a bunch of noise\\" kind of thing like some death metal bands do. Death is a band whose death metal music is actually well structured, complex, and actually influenced by jazz! All these things make Death stand out more than any other death metal band.<br /><br />RIP Chuck Schuldiner - you're a true metal god and hero
B00005JP3Y|5.0|Heartwarming and full of personal courage, this is also a fun and wacky movie, based on a true story.  The fashion runway scene at the Milan shoe show is worth the price of admission alone.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|There's really nothing that I can put here that has not already been said; I'm just one more person who is hopelessly addicted to Firefly. Although I'm disappointed that Amazon raised the price of this set by $10 (which made it fall from its number 6 spot in the Top Selling DVDs list into the 30s), the fact that it still remains in the top 40 highest-selling DVDs is yet another testament to its enduring appeal. Never has a television show been more deserving of a renewal than this one. FOX, if you're listening, please put this show back on the air. And consumers, don't stop buying this set. It's one of the best DVD purchases you will ever make.
0767827791|1.0|I love \\"Picnic\\" starring Kim Novak and William Holden but...the movie was not in letterbox format!! The entire movie with the exception of the very beginning and the very end of the movie was in WIDESCREEN format.  You could not get the full effect of this timeless love story of a drifter who changed the lives of many in a 24-hour period.  I recommend that this movie be put in letterbox format ONLY and burn the widescreen versions of this timeless classic forever.
B000FDEUFS|5.0|Disc two is as good as the original ABB Live at the Fillmore. Great sound quality as well.Duane & Dickey's guitar interplay has never been matched or surpassed. Sounds as good today as back in '71.
B000003C2U|5.0|The first Death CD that I got was \\"The Sound Of Perseverance\\" and I feel in love with that CD since. So I've read that Sound Of Perseverance was the last and most complex and melodic arrangement Death has released. But I was convinced these guys new how to prove people wrong when they say that heavy metal was \\"just a bunch of noise\\". Sure, it's not actually \\"singing\\" but this actually gives a unique feel of anger or death in the music along with the well played music of guitars, bass, and drums. When I got this CD, my first listening reaction was more noticing of the vocal style. Chuck's vocals are shrieking but not as high of a pitch he displayed in \\"Symbolic\\" and \\"Sound OF Perseverance\\" but you can still tell it is Chuck. The guitar playing still has the amazing blow-you away solos and the music is still brutal. Now I knew where Death came from and the music they played to grow more tighter and progressive from this CD to Sound Of Perseverance. This is a great CD filled with classics such as \\"Lack Of Comprehension\\" which exposed the band to more fans of metal. Although not as progressive as the bands future releases, this still deserves credit as an influential metal CD to metal bands and even Death themselves! RIP Chuck Schuldiner and thank you for making your music.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|I hated the Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher versions of Batman so my expectations were very low that anyone in Hollywood could make a good Batman flick. So imagine my surprise when I finally watched Batman Begins and found a movie version of the Dark Knight that could have been taken from the comics.<br /><br /> Christian Bale gives the definitive Batman portrayal in this excellent film and he is joined by an entire cast of amazing actors that give life to characters of the comic mythology; Michael Caine as Alfred, Liam Neeson as Henri Ducard, Gary Oldman as Jim Gordon, Cillian Murphy as Dr. Jonathan Crane, Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, and the list goes on...<br /><br /> At its core this movie is about fear and how it is dealt with (and dealt out) and director Christopher Nolan has captured that theme and embedded into every scene and nuance, and the actors, Bale in particular, keep a veneer of fear over their performances that adds to their realism.<br /><br /> Christopher Nolen has rebooted the Batman franchise and turned it into what it should have been all along.  Now let's hope that the movie moguls don't screw it up again!
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|The melodies both rock you and haunt you at the same time, a strange mix you almost never come across. The lyrics make you think. <br />The first self-titled CD is just as good in a different way, an awesome collection of music. Both CDs are worth having. This band was a real surprise to me.
B000FQJAIW|1.0|I find it hilarious that the main selling point for this DVD is what is featured on the extra disc. Why else buy it? The speical edition is available in two other releases that came out in the past 2 years. Well, my dear Star Wars...to think it's come to this. RIP Star Wars.
B00005JOVH|3.0|I was kind of disappointed by this third X-Men flick.  As much as I enjoyed the first two - especially the 2nd one - this new movie had very much of a \\"been there, done that\\" feeling for me.  Perhaps it's because all of the super powers have already been demonstrated so well previously, or maybe because this is the first X-men movie without Mr. Singer at the helm.  Whatever the reason, I just never really got into the story.  I also thought several plot developments were handled rather casually or sloppily, especially the death (?) of one of the major characters and what happens to Mystique following the loss of her powers.  Another example is what happens when Kitty Pride attempts to rescue Leech and is pursued by Juggernaut.  The way he is taken out of action makes little sense in the scene, and doesn't match the X-men mythology either.  (I.e., Juggernaut's not having mutant powers.)  Then there are various continuity errors such as the way the Golden Gate bridge scene takes place during the day but then suddenly it is night, without an apparent time lapse(??).  The first two movies had a bunch of scenes where I thought, \\"Wow, that's cool!\\"  There were very few such scenes this time.
B00005JOVH|2.0|I'll try not to write in any spoilers, but I'm sorry, not only did this movie lack any coherent plot, but Fox just killed off their biggest blockbuster in their catalog.  It all boils down to this... great special effects, but with their budget this was expected; visually appealing fight scenes, but with this director it was expected; decent attempt at a plot, the cure was an excellent idea and could have been a wonderful vehicle to introduce the mutant wars, but that fell short; horrible character development, in fact it was as if the screenwriter knew nothing of the X-Men besides their powers... they got everyone wrong, wrong, wrong. <br /> <br />In the end, this movie will be liked by a lot of people who know nothing of the comics, but most everyone who liked X-Men because they knew the comics will HATE this movie.  Its almost as though Fox rushed this movie to get back at Brian Singer for directing Superman and ended up with a movie that had a lot of people wishing the end would show Professor X waking up in bed realizing everything you just saw was some alternate reality turned nightmare. <br /> <br />See it if you like effects, stay home if you like the X-Men.
B000B5XOXY|2.0|Tim Burton tossed out the mythology from the Batman comics to create his dark (and very unsatisfying) version of Gotham City's Dark Knight. Joel Schumacher took that dark vision and gave it a metrosexual makeover.<br /><br /> Val Kilmer takes over the role of Batman/Bruce Wayne and, even though he is better than Michael Keaton, doesn't seem like he really cares to be in the film, Chris O'Donnell joins the cast as Robin and returns us to the creepy, homoerotic feel of the sixties TV series, Tommy Lee Jones gives an uneven performance as Two-Face, Nicole Kidman is bloody awful in a pointless part, and the one saving grace for this terrible film: Jim Carrey as The Riddler!<br /><br />  Even though The Riddler origins have been rewritten, which is a huge mistake; Carrey's manic performance is a joy to watch and, at times, seems to be taken directly Frank Gorshin's great Riddler from the sixties.<br /><br />  A big day-glow thumbs down to Joel Schumacher ludicrous version of Batman, and a thank you to Jim Carrey for keeping the viewer from gouging his eyes out in disgust.
B00006AFUR|5.0|Simply awesome. There's nothing else like it out there. Thanks to the other reviewers that highly recommended this to us. The more I listen the more I'm hooked into this strange world.
0671042734|1.0|Anyone who thinks this book has any resemblance to how things really work and who thinks this resembles good writing is either working for the publishers or needs to get a life!  The lack of a genuinely interesting plot is disguised by snide, upper-class English pronouncements which, as in real life, substitute for actual hard work and talent.
0066620996|3.0|I don't want to repeat what's in a lot of other reviews; go ahead and read them. Here are some of my observations: <br /> <br />1. The book is entertaining, and it is a good exercise to read it and think about it, especially if you haven't been to business school, as I haven't. <br /> <br />2. It could say what it has to say in 15 pages. But then, I guess it wouldn't be a best-selling BOOK. <br /> <br />3. I see a lot of correlations in it, but I don't see a lot of cause and effect. If this book captures an academic study, I say to the author, \\"good evidence collection. Good discussion. Where are the conclusions? And where's any citation of previous work as a foundation?\\" I.e., it says \\"we observe that great companies have these characteristics,\\" but not \\"we conclude that this collection of characteristics will ensure XX percent of the time that a company will become great.\\" There's some missing research before one could get to that point. <br /> <br />4. Collins uses a tightly bounded definition of \\"great,\\" and I may add it's a very convenient one from \\"let's sell a pop-culture best-seller\\" standpoint. It is based soley on profit. One of his great companies is Phillip Morris. He speaks of how the executives within Phillip Morris have this rapturous love of the concept of tobacco. O-kay. Maybe not so great. <br /> <br />5. Still, it's a valuable book. I predict that most folks who read this book will remain incapable of the self-reflection necessary to make anything of it for themselves. The business owner who recommended it to me, like many of the business owners who recommended it to many of you, could make better use of a book entitled \\"Bad to Mediocre.\\"
B000B5XOY8|2.0|Having just posted a review for Batman Begins I couldn't resist the urge to finally speak my mind about this film that so many people seemed to think of as perfect...<br /><br /> This Batman film is bloody awful! Tim Burton does make a dark and vaguely oppressive world, after all it is the ability to craft palatable darkness that has made him the deity of goth kids everywhere, but atmosphere alone doesn't make a movie and this film is rife with plot holes so huge you could toss Superman 3 and 4 into them and still have room for the Catwoman movie...<br /><br /> ...But wait, shouldn't I give more leeway to a movie based on a comic, you ask? Not when that movie totally discards the mythology of that comic; Batman intentionally killing off his enemies? Bruce Wayne being an absent minded imbecile? Alfred escorting strangers into the Batcave? Commissioner Gordon being an ineffectual slob? The Batplane being weak enough to be brought down by a single pistol shot? These are not the trappings of the comic and should have never occurred. I won't even go into the rewriting of the Joker's origins, which was so perfectly established in the graphic novel \\"The Killing Joke.\\"<br /><br /> I am giving this film a 2 star rating because, sadly, the worst was yet to come with this series. Spend your hard earned money on Batman Begins instead which, thankfully, reboots the franchise.
0790729628|3.0|Let me begin by agreeing, and without entering into debates over whether the original theatrical release or the Director's Cut is better (personally speaking, however, I do prefer the Director's Cut), Blade Runner is far and away one of the finest SciFi flicks ever committed to celluloid.<br /><br />But the very bad news, like others have already noted, is that this DVD transfer of the movie is absolutely abysmal!<br /><br />I own both the VHS as well as the DVD versions of Blade Runner.  But the DVD version is actually, and inconceivably, worse than the VHS. I'm not engaging in hyperbole, I don't think, when I say that the DVD comes across as if someone snuck a handheld video camera into a local movie theater, filmed Blade Runner, and then pressed the image onto a DVD.  (I should note I'm strictly speaking of the Region 1 DVD release for North America.  But other regions may fare better.  For instance, I've heard the Region 2 transfer, for Europe, is actually quite good.  Not sure if this is indeed true, or if so, why, but you can perhaps google around for more info if you're interested.)<br /><br />In fact, in my opinion, it's not even worth the currently reduced Amazon price of $9.99. If you must have the movie right this minute, perhaps if you need it for a gift, I'd recommend purchasing the VHS instead. The VHS version is not anything outstanding, but it's not by any means \\"bad\\" either, and it's certainly better than the DVD in picture quality.<br /><br />Morever the DVD is essentially a bare bones, movie-only version; it does not include additional special features.<br /><br />Thankfully, however, Blade Runner fans are not left at an impasse. The latest, and yes, official news -- not rumor! -- is that Warner Bros. Studios will be releasing a new limited DVD edition of the 1992 Director's Cut of Blade Runner in Sept. 2006! This edition will only be offered for a few months, until the end of the year, I believe, or possibly until the beginning of next year, 2007. Then it will be followed by a theatrical release of an updated, \\"ultimate\\" Director's Cut of the film, which is basically everything that Ridley Scott has ever wanted to do with the film (no word on specifics, though, at least that I know), to celebrate Blade Runner's 25th anniversary. And then the biggest news is that all this will eventually be followed with a colossal multi-disc DVD edition of Blade Runner, which should include every version of Blade Runner ever released, including the latest theatrical run.<br /><br />HD-DVD and Blu-ray versions are also in the works, but I don't think there are any set dates for these.<br /><br />So, if you can wait, there's much for Blade Runner fans to look forward to! :-)al release of an updated, \\"ultimate\\" Director's Cut of the film, which is basically everything that Ridley Scott has ever wanted to do with the film (no word on specifics, though, at least that I know), to celebrate Blade Runner's 25th anniversary.

B000BJS4OY|5.0|My favorite Bruce<br /><br />I like this Bruce the best...down home rockin' out. I never cared for Born in the USA because I felt he was only doing it to get really commercial. I'm glad he's going in different and better directions today. This album is a classic, and if you like good music you should listen to it. Who would think something so great could be improved.
B000F7CMRM|5.0|If you are one of the many people I have known who thinks this film was overly complicated....go have your brain checked! <br />This was an excellent spy thriller...with realistic international plot twists and current events mixed in just to make it even spicier! <br />This film goes out on a limb...to show the American public how sinister our own CIA etc. are when it comes to protecting US Corporate interests around the world...they will stop at nothing to further the cause of world economic dominance <br />As I stated earlier...if you can't follow the story of this film...you are one dumb bastard! <br />Oh yes...and by the way...this was a great piece of film making for 2005...I'm surprised it did not do so well....but then again why should I be?  Most idiot moviegoers didn't understand half of what was going on in the film!!!
B000B5XOSO|3.0|You really have to wonder if Tim Burton got into film making to make movies or as therapy for his issues with parents. Every Burton film seems to let mommy-daddy problems overwhelm the story...<br /><br />  ...This time he has attempted to work through his issues by destroying the history and character of the Penguin and recreating him as a sideshow freak who was thrown into a river as a newborn because of his deformities by, you guessed it, his parents. We get it, Tim; you have parent problems.<br /><br />  Anyway, the origin of Catwoman has also been changed (apparently Mr. Burton didn't think much of the rich history of the Batman comics) and Gotham City is more dark and oppressive than ever. Returning from the first Batman film are a completely out of character Batman who doesn't mind causing the death of his foes, an absent minded Bruce Wayne, an ineffectual slob as Commissioner Gordon, and Batgear that seems really easy to break and hack into (you would think that Bruce might spend a dollar or two developing longer lasting gear).<br /><br />  ...And just when you thought all hope was lost for even a mediocre film, in walks Christopher Walken. Walken's character, Max Shreck, is paper thin but, thanks to a great performance, becomes ten times more interesting than the costumed villains. It is Walken's creepiness and Michelle Pfeiffer's performance (only when inside the catsuit, however) that ultimately make this film watchable.<br /><br />  It's too bad Mr. Burton decided to ignore the rich heritage of Batman because this could have been a good film. Thankfully the series has been rebooted with the excellent Batman Begins.
0307276902|4.0|By the time I borrowed this in audio form at the library, I had heard the book contained a number of lies and half-truths. In a way, this was one of the reasons I wanted to read it: to see if I could spot them.  <br /> <br />I quickly lost myself in the story, and in the end it didn't matter to me whether Lilly or Leonard were fictional, or how much jail time Frey did. It still presented an accurate account of what fate might have held for a person like a Lilly or a Leonard if they DID exist.  <br /> <br />The portion of the audio version where James gets his dental surgery sans anesthesia literally had me groaning. Whether authentic or merely metaphoric for the forms and levels of physical pain an addict might suffer, I groaned just the same. Odds are (in my opinion only)...there was B.S. involved in this. If James had needed an appendectomy, would Hazelden have required him to have it without anesthesia? Certainly not. <br /> <br />Since Mr. Frey has already been called out on his lies, I will no longer belabor this point.  <br /> <br />Perhaps the eeriest part of this book is the way Frey was-in a strange way-following several of the 12 AA steps whether he knew it or not...if one simply eliminated the word \\"God\\" from those steps. The existence of the book itself is possibly, for James, HIS 12th step. The progress and confessions James made regarding his parents resembled steps 8 and 9 in many ways...and the little paperback book he turned to throughout his Hazelden stay was in many ways James' Bible...he considered IT powerful, perhaps to the extent that it became his version of Step 2...his Higher Power. And just maybe, this is how his \\"program\\" worked for him.  <br /> <br />No, I'm not attempting to absolve him of his responsibility for truth...this should have been presented \\"based on a true story\\" rather than hard truth. One way or another-truth, lies, or in-betweens-James Frey's story is very moving. I was impressed with his ability to express the depth of his emotions, and I'd still recommend the book to anyone.

B000CNFC76|4.0|Sports movies are harder to do than one might first think.  If it is a historical movie, the acts are known, and the necessary fictionalizations for dramatic effect are always criticized.  However, if it is fiction, all the possible tweaks and turns have been done in the previous thousands of such movies made.  One cannot make the movie a downer and expect it to be a blockbuster.  Even if the inevitable \\"Big Game\\" is lost, the hero has to win in some other way.<br /><br />Anyway, this movie tells the story of the great Francis Ouimet his win of the U.S. Open Championship in 1913 when he was an unknown twenty year old against the even greater Harry Vardon and the then reigning (British) Open Championship winner, Ted Ray.  I really like the way the movie makes a point of Vardon's modest, well poor, no, poverty stricken, origins as it tells us of Ouimet's working class origins as well.  Ouimet, as modest as his family origins were, still had much more than the Vardon household.  Ouimet may have won the U.S. Open at twenty, Vardon didn't even take up the game until he was twenty.<br /><br />The movie tells the story in broad strokes.  It manufactures the story of Ouimet's family and father, though.  Ouimet actually learned the game from his older brother and they had built a three hole course in their backyard, rough as it was, with tomato cans sunk in the ground for holes.  Also, Ouiment did not panic or even breathe hard over the last hole.  Vardon's gamble at 17 had put him several strokes back and Ouimet won in a seeming calm.<br /><br />Still, the story of Ouimet and his ten year old caddy, Eddie Lowery, is charming and the famous picture of them walking the course during the tournament has endured.  I am also delighted that they had the course in the relatively rougher conditions that existed in those days rather than the manicured works of art we have today.  And I loved the accurate sound of the balls rolling on the grass.  And the stymie was a nice touch as well (they don't exist anymore).<br /><br />The actors do a fine job and Bill Paxton did a nice job in putting the story on film.  He keeps things moving and conveys the sense of the golf tournament quite well.  The look of the film is fine (although I doubted they played in coats so much) and it rained more than in the film, but one cannot have rain and gray skies in a movie for audiences.<br /><br />Good film about a golfer anyone who loves the game, or even just likes it more than bit, should know more about.  Ouimet was justly the founder of popular golf in America and for the rest of his life was a wonderful ambassador of the game.  It is good that this film gets his name and the tournament that placed his name in the history books in the popular imagination.  Ouimet also subsequently won two American Amateur Championship titles and other tournaments as well.  Yes, he was surpassed by Bobby Jones, Ben Hogan, Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, and others, but he was still the guy who put golf on the map of popular sport.<br /><br />Fine family film, too.as well (they don't exist anymore).   <br /> <br />The actors do a fine job and Bill Paxton did a nice job in putting the story on film.

B000003FMY|4.0|Perhaps not fair but I'll mainly comment on the \\"Pictures at an exhibition\\"<br /><br />Frankly, I didn't got blown away with this perfomance of \\"the Pictures\\"<br />Considering all the rave reviews by professional and customer reviewers: \\"Best Pictures ever\\", \\"Never to surpassed\\" and \\"Desert Island disc\\", I was preparing myself for a musical feast.<br /><br />Most parts are terrific, but some rather disappointing, including two of my favorites: \\"Il vechio castello\\"  and \\"Gnomus\\".<br /><br />The opening \\"promenade\\" is rather tame, correctly played but without any grandeur, but that didn't bother me much, it's only an introduction.<br /><br />\\"Gnomus\\" starts great, but the screechy violins at the end sound very polite, not disturbing at all.<br />I scratched my head...how can this be?<br />One of my personal highlights of Mussorsky's Pictures is played that tame...and this on the greatest recording of the pictures ever???<br /><br />\\"Il vechio castello\\".<br />Nice mood, great alt-saxo solo, but not as \\"Russian folk\\" like Kubelik's mono version on Mercury...and then the strings play without any mystery, not veiled at all.<br />A drop out in the recording or transfer on cd? takes me out of the mood again.<br />Only at the end of this piece the strings are nicely veiled and have that mysterious sound.<br /><br />Now the best part:<br /><br />\\"Bydlo\\" is magnificent. Perfectly built to a climax, incredible sound. Wow, this really deserves all the praise possible.<br /><br />I also like Reiner's \\"A night on Bald Mountain\\" very much.<br />What a speed and power, very exciting.<br /><br />The other pieces on this disc didn't get my attention that much, I don't care much for marches (or they must be in a symphony by Gustav Mahler) and I generally dislike Tchaikovsky's music.
0380973839|5.0|I have been reading this one since the mid l950s and still from time to time give it another shot.  This is not a \\"happy book\\" by any means.  In fact, it can be down right depressing at times.  I suppose that is because there is so much of \\"us\\" in it.<br /><br />This work of course can certainly be classified as a classic.  It is well written, and at the time of publicaiton, more or less set the standard of the time, and set it quite high.  This is a wonderful collection of short stories which are interlinked, concerning the colonization of the Planet Mars.  Bradbury, in typical Bradbury style, is able to examin our own civilization threw these stories.  Most of the stories are rather sad in nature, ergo, the unhappiness of the book.  Through his writing the author more or less makes the point that we certainly do not learn from or mistakes, repeating the same ones over and over again.  I absolutely hate the phrase \\"a must read,\\" but in this case sort of am forced to use it.  It is certainly a must for any person interested in the history of this genre and you certainly will not be the worse for wear in reading it.  Recommend this one highly.

In Gary Chapman's 'The Five Love Languages', the author suggests key communication/interactions that will better faciliate a loving relationship.<br /><br />The five love languages are:<br /><br />-Quality Time<br /><br />-Words of Affirmation<br /><br />-Gifts<br /><br />-Acts of Service<br /><br />-Physical Touch<br /><br />Nothing new to any of this; however, in the breath of the authors writing style, there is an easy flow and understanding on how an open mind and open heart of taking the time to notice another will in fact allow for a loving relationship to be fostered.
B000C65Z1G|5.0|While I do not love this film as much as many others do, I think it is superbly acted and powerfully told.  It is the actual story with the \\"big pharma\\" companies as stand ins for the Nazis or the Commies.  Really.  John LeCarre uses authorial anger as a stand in for facts and clear seeing or understanding.  It is a movie that says that drug companies would sacrifice human lives in Africa to bring a faulty drug to market so they can lose billions upon billions of dollars to law suits, fines, and credibility once the faulty drug kills people in the rich West.  Does this make sense to you?  But of course this is the kind of thing you are supposed to feel rather than think about.  And that anyone gets sick and dies in the entire world has to be someone's fault, right?  Everyone would live forever in Eden if it weren't for wicked businessmen and the politicians they own.  Yeah, right.<br /><br />Ralph Fiennes is absolutely wonderful as the government diplomat, Justin Quayle.  Seemingly, he is all diplomatic avoidance, but underneath he is quite strong.  Justin is all about what goes on under the surface.  From his conversations we learn that his family has been in the government diplomatic corps for generations and that he has not been a particularly brilliant or ambitious diplomat.  He does love to garden and is passionate about keeping weeds out of his garden.  Hence the title.<br /><br />Rachel Weisz plays Tessa Quayle, Justin's love and wife.  We only see her in current time briefly.  The rest of the film, her role is in flashback.  Tessa is a very charismatic young woman who is passionate about her causes to the brink of nuttiness.  The questions are, has she become unbalanced, is she using Justin for some other purpose and cuckolding him, or is there something else she is onto?  What is it the she and Dr. Arnold Bluhm (Herbert Kound&eacute;) are up to?  Romance?  These are the mysteries of the film and different parts of the film seem to push us into different paths.<br /><br />Sandy Woodrow (Danny Huston) is Justin's longtime friend and seems to be there all along the way to support Justin.  However, the question about Sandy is whether he is trying to manipulate Justin or whether he really believes the path he is trying to encourage Justin to take.<br /><br />There are other spies, government bullies, and all kinds of paranoia inducing technologies that are almost standard spy stuff anymore, but it is used well to enhance the drama of the movie.<br /><br />I found the ending the Justin chooses for himself rather sad and unsatisfying.  It seems to me that he would have honored Tessa more by taking a more defiant and life affirming stance.  Still, what Justin accomplishes with Tessa's cousin makes for a powerful affirmation, but I simply don't think Justin should have chosen the ending he did.  Too nihilistic a romantic conclusion for my taste.  You might certainly feel differently, and that is perfectly fine with me.<br /><br />This is a very well acted and dramatically satisfying drama that really does rise above the mystery-spy genre.  That is, once you get past the nonsense of connecting the bad guys of the story with any bad guys in real life.  Don't do it!<br /><br />The \\"R\\" Rating is for some gruesome scenes of the results of violence and a few romantic flashback scenes between Justin and the pregnant and nude Tessa in and out of the bath.. <br /> <br />Sandy Woodrow (Danny Huston) is Justin's longtime friend and seems to be there all along the way to support Justin.

B00005JNJV|5.0|This is one of the best Superhero films ever because is both entertaining  but at the same time, displays a kind of emotional intensity that I've  never seen before in the Batman Series.. it's extremely well produced  but the MVP goes to Christian Bale (who finally gets to really touch 'em all as Batman).  He's one of the finest actors of my generation!!
B000002UAI|4.0|This was the 4th album by The Beatles and it represents the real beginning of their parting-of-the-ways of Beatlemania, mainly in Lennon/McCartney's songwriting.  Imagine what it must've been like to have been The Beatles - - - the constant world-wide touring, radio spots and promotions, TV appearances, and still realizing the importance of putting out albums and singles for their millions of loyal fans.  By now, you have to believe that even they were tiring of performing those early songs, especially in the wake of the folk and singer-songwriter music which was emerging.  Artists such as Bob Dylan, Paul Simon (w/Art Garfunkel), Joni Mitchell and many others were writing songs that were reporting on social events and other important issues.  What was happening was the 1960's beginning to \\"grow up\\".  The Beatles For Sale represents The Beatles as serious songwriters, especially John Lennon.  Even though only 8 out of the 14 songs on this album were written by Lennon & McCartney, one can see (and hear) the change in their writing.  <br />The first three songs are probably the darkest three songs to ever lead off an album, but within those songs are some brilliant lyrics, especially in John's \\"I'm a Loser\\".  The only single which came out of this LP was \\"Eight Days A Week\\", a title which I believe came from Ringo (who also came up with the title \\"A Hard Day's Night\\") as something he was just saying in passing conversation.  A very radio-friendly song, the kind that Beatles' fans love; you hear it and you're forever singing it in your head.  The remaining original songs are just good Beatles songs.  \\"What you're doing\\" may be one of the best Paul McCartney songs people don't know of and \\"I'll Follow The Sun\\" continues the trend of Paul, the balladeer.  The remaining 6 songs are covers from Chuck Berry (\\"Rock And Roll Music\\", which showcases John Lennon's powerful voice.  I don't think anyone in Rock music had a voice like his.  He truly understood the medium and anytime he sang a cover tune, it was superior to the original), the team of Lieber & Stoller and Little Richard (\\"Kansas City/Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey\\" - sung convincingly by Paul), two by Carl Perkins (\\"Everybody's Trying To Be My Baby\\", sung by George and \\"Honey Don't\\", sung by Ringo), Buddy Holly (\\"Words of Love\\", with beautiful three-part harmony from John, Paul and George) and lastly Roy Lee Johnson (\\"Mr. Moonlight\\", this song often heralded as one of the worst songs of The Beatles career.  Personally, I can think of some songs that would rank above this one, although the organ does seem out of place). <br /> <br />The Beatles For Sale may not rank on a par with the likes of Rubber Soul, Revolver, Sgt. Pepper, A Hard Day's Night, The Beatles (White Album) or Abbey Road, but they can be forgiven by putting out a 4-star album at a time when Beatlemania was still straining every drop of energy from these four lads.  The Beatles may not have been meant to be \\"live\\" entertainers, such as The Rolling Stones and others, but what they did to transcend the art of rock/pop music and the recording industry has impacted every serious artist since and today - 40 years on, The Beatles' songs haven't dated one minute.
B00004XONN|5.0|The greatest album ever produced by mankind. A beautiful and brilliant testament to the exploration of atmospheric melodies and  utter innovation. - Zan Holmes
B00005JOVH|2.0|X-men 3 is one of the most disappointing films I have ever seen.  The dialogue in it is very sub par, leaving dramatic lines such as Magneto's when he loses his powers in the end incredibly anti-climatic.  To someone who has never dealt with X-men before then I suppose this film could pass as entertaining, but to any X-men fan it completely defaces any reminance of a true X-men storyline.  Instead of using beloved characters as the new villians, the movie uses characters that many fans don't really care about, and it uses them incorrectly.  Sure there are some new villians who are a good addition, notably Juggernaut and Arclight.  Callisto would have been a good addition if the movie hadn't created powers for her such as super speed similiar to Quicksilver and the ability to detect any mutant and their powers.  Another addition is Kid Omega as they credit him in the movie, but instead of having massive intellectual powers this Kid Omega has the powers of Spike (who by the way is also in the movie).  The rest of the new villians rarely show any powers and are taken down in such numbers by the X-men that it reminded me of the fight scenes in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.  There were all of these lesser known villians of the X-men universe, but nowhere to be seen were well loved brotherhood members such as Avalanche, Blob, or even an explanation as to where Sabertooth or Toad were.  The X-men themselves were also greatly disappointing.  So many characters were killed off that it would be near impossible to make another X-men movie to make up for this folly without it being completely corny.  Wolverine apparently took the place of Cyclops as the only X-man who can truely get to Jean and break the hold of the Phoenix over her.  Professor Xavier isn't the pleasant understanding Professor X you would expect, but is instead rather harsh and condescending up until the moment he is killed.  I did enjoy the addition of Beast, as his fight scenes were some of my favorite, and Bobby Drake finally icing up to become Iceman was also enjoyable.  But in the end it seemed like there could have been more X-men to help fight instead of just watching Wolverine fight everyone and Storm get her tail whipped by Callisto.  Even Colossus couldv'e been paid a little more attention in the fight scenes, maybe even with a fight between him and the brute Juggernaut.  All in all this movie completely warps any ties to the X-men comics and any true fan of the X-men will leave feeling as if this movie was made just to piss off real X-men fans.

B00005RIKI|5.0|Pronounced Leh-Nerd Skin-Nerd is a timeless classic from the most important group of musicians ever to come out of the South.  Enough has been said about the music from this classic album so my comments center on this particular CD release.  This re-release from 2001 includes bonus demos that the boys did with Al Kooper before going into the studio with producer Kooper and engineer wiz Bob \\"Tub\\" Langford (Joe South, Atlanta Rhythm Section, Blood, Sweat & Tears).  The demos show how tight their arrangements were before entering the studio but they also show the magic that \\"Tub\\" was able to get on tape once the real album was recorded.  The band were so indebted to the sound that Bob \\"Tub\\" Lankford found for them that they included a photo of him and a special thanks to him on the original release of the album on Sounds Of The South Records.  The original album was a gatefold (like a double disc foldout) with pictures, lyrics and credits covering both pages.  After the initial release MCA began pressing future orders for the album and for cost reasons dropped the gatefold and the information contained there in.  The black MCA label also replaced the original yellow label that Songs Of The South had used on the first pressings of the LP.  This re-release CD now contains all of the photos, lyrics and credits contained in the very first issue of this classic album along with an essay about the band's early beginnings.  The sound quality is incredible on this disc and the added bonus tracks make it a must have for any music fan that appreciates what really goes into making a record of this magnitude.  The 12 panel insert provides enough information about these timeless recordings to make even the first time listener feel as though they have a special insight into the beginnings of one of the greatest rock bands of all time.
B00000253N|5.0|BLOOD ON THE TRACKS is almost universally regarded as Bob Dylan's greatest album after BLOOD ON THE TRACKS (or at least after the inconsistent brilliance of the songs that he recorded with the Band in Woodstock, NY, some of which made it into THE BASEMENT TAPES) and with considerable justification.  Although Dylan remained productive for most of the decade following the release of BLONDE ON BLONDE, his output was clearly not on the same level as on it, BRINGING IT ALL BACK HOME, and HIGHWAY 61 REVISITED.  Though JOHN WESLEY HARDING represented only a slight decline from those masterworks, such ill-conceived ventures as SELF PORTRAIT, DYLAN, and PLANET WAVES caused many to believe that Dylan had lost it.  BLOOD ON THE TRACKS was one of the great comebacks in the history of rock, comparable to Elvis's 1968 television special.  The Dylan of this album was different yet the same, still spinning out one astonishing lyrics after another, and stretching songs to narrative limits as never before.  With the release later in 1975 of a some of THE BASEMENT TAPES, Dylan was completely back on top.<br /><br />In my opinion, only one thing keeps BLOOD ON THE TRACKS from equally HIGHWAY 61 REVISITED and BLONDE ON BLONDE for utter genius:  the back up musicians.  Both of those albums featured a host of utterly brilliant musicians, from the likes of Michael Bloomfield and Al Kooper, to Nashville veteran Charlie McCoy, whose eleven-minute brilliance on acoustic guitar on \\"Desolation Row\\" made an already great song even greater.  But one looks in vain on BLOOD ON THE TRACKS for musicians who contributed guitar like Bloomfield and McCoy or Al Kooper's accidental organ on \\"Like a Rolling Stone.\\"  The playing on BLOOD ON THE TRACKS isn't bad; it is merely uninspired.  As a result, an absolutely astonishing group of songs is held back ever so slightly.<br /><br />Still, abject amateurs couldn't have obscured the brilliance of the songs on this album.  All the songs on the album are at least very good, while at least five or six are by any standard--or more importantly, by Dylan's almost impossibly high standards--great songs.  \\"Tangled Up in Blue,\\" \\"Simple Twist of Fate,\\" \\"Idiot Wind,\\" and \\"If You See Her, Say Hello\\" are simply masterpieces of the first rank.  And \\"Lily, Rosemary, and the Jack of Hearts\\" almost approximates a B-Western in its comic yet moving narration of a bank heist and murder in the Old Western.  That song proceeds almost cinematically, moving the story forward not so much by focusing on the action but by a series of glimpses into the main characters.  All in all it is an astonishing achievement and might be the finest telling of a tell of any song in wrong.  \\"Simple Twist of Fate\\" similarly tells the story of a man who falls in love with a woman after a single night of passion.  The musical highlight of the album for me is, however, \\"Idiot Wind.\\"  Since BLOOD ON THE TRACK Dylan has even on otherwise weak albums written a score of superb songs.  But I'm not sure that any of his post-1975 output has matched \\"Idiot Wind.\\"  The passion in his singing was matched previously on such classics as \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" and \\"Positively 4th Street,\\" but not on many other occasions.  He sings some of the words almost as if he is trying to stab someone with them.  Everything is in the song.  Humor in the way he sings \\"I can't help it if I'm lucky\\" after he tells of how he inherited a million bucks after the death of the woman who originally inherited it from her husband when he died, perhaps by the singer's hand.  And irony in the way he snarls the words \\"Sweet lady.\\"  But with all the anger in the song, much of it is reflected back on himself, and he truly does seem to mean it when he sings \\"We're idiots babe/It's a wonder we can even feed ourselves.\\"<br /><br />In my opinion (well, OK, it is the opinion of a mass of music lovers, so I can't claim any originality here) Dylan is the predominant musical figure of the past forty years.  Thatit isn't his greatest album is a remarkable testimony to his genius.  But let me try to express how great this album is another way:  if any other figure in music had produced an album this great, he or she would instantly have been declared one of music's greatest lights.  Music may occasionally reach this level and even in a few instances surpass it, but those moments are very, very few and far between..

B000001EG6|5.0|One of the great things about the film ALMOST FAMOUS is that it helps remind us that once upon a time Elton John was loved by music snobs.  This was before the excess, before succumbing to schmaltz, before the sunglasses, before the almost cartoonish self-parody.  Two of the great moments in that fine film are centered on Elton John.  First, as the band and their entourage at first listen and then sing along to the wonderful \\"Tiny Dancer\\" and later when \\"Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters\\" plays while William struggles to thwart Penny's suicide attempt.<br /><br />I'm not sure what drove Elton John to shift the focus away from the music to his self-image.  I wish he hadn't.  Perhaps there are those who enjoy the spectacle, but I personally preferred him when it was all about the music, when the effort was expended into making the music good, instead of cultivating an image.  And the music here is good.  Not all the songs are good, but most are, and a few are great.  \\"Your Song\\" was almost overnight a classic.  Even though John and Taupin wrote it, it felt more like it had been around before them and they were merely adapting it.  \\"Take Me to the Pilot\\" was also excellent, though I have always found it somewhat overproduced.  I have always been especially partial to \\"Sixty Years On,\\" with some of Taupin's least opaque and most moving lyrics.  This album kicked off an amazing five year period in which Elton John and Bernie Taupin spun out such marvelous albums as MADMAN ACROSS THE WATER, TUMBLEWEED CONNECTION, HONKY CHATEAU, DON'T SHOOT ME I'M ONLY THE PIANO PLAYER, GOODBYE YELLOW BRICK ROAD, and CAPTAIN FANTASTIC AND THE BROWN DIRT COWBOY.  After that there was the steady decline as more and more and then almost exclusively it because all about performing a role and John gave into the worst tendencies in his music.  In the last three albums I note above there were more and more hints about things to come.<br /><br />My fondest wish at the moment is that Rick Rubin, who achieved such remarkable things with Johnny Cash and Neil Diamond, take a hand at producing a new Elton John album.  It would be wonderful to see if John were able to come to focus again more on the song and less on the singer.  But regardless of what had happened more recently, this is a very fine album and it signaled the appearance of a major talent.  My fellow music snobs, who view themselves as too selective to explore John's music, really should give these early albums a shot.  There are many truly beautiful songs here.kable things with Johnny Cash and Neil Diamond, take a hand at producing a new Elton John album.

B000E8QVWY|5.0|This is such a great film. Before I saw this movie I had never heard of Jonny Cash or June Carter, but Joquin Phoneix and Reese Witherspoon did a terrific job portraying them. This movie shows how important it is to have a friend like June. She helped him become a better person, and he never made the same mistakes again. I also enjoyed the music in this film because all of those songs were actually John and June's.
0060090383|4.0|Of the four Marian Keyes novels that I have read (all of which have been enjoyable), \\"Rachel's Holiday\\" was by far the best.    Now, I did not feel so enamored the entire time I was reading this novel.... Rachel is a very thick-headed character, and for more than half of the book, I was nearly wailing aloud with misery at her inability to see reality. And yet, reality is what makes this book so wonderful. The stark, harshness of life and family and love and friendship and emotional issues and addiction all come to light in \\"Rachel's Holiday\\". As odd as it may sound, reading this novel about a delusional drug addict made me feel more acutely aware of reality and the joy of living.    This funny & poignant novel about another daughter of the dysfunctional Walsh family, is entirely perfect. I would most definitely recommend it to others.

0385336691|4.0|I won't rehash the story line as you can get that from the editorial reviews.<br /><br />I was turned on to Lee Child's Jack Reacher novels a couple of years ago by a friend; I am eternally grateful to that friend, and owe him a big one.<br /><br />This novel is a real pleaser, and continues to develop Reacher's character while rolling us along on a roller-coaster of an adventure.<br /><br />As I was thinking about writing this review, it came to me that I'm old enough to remember (and have read) the Ian Fleming 007 books when they first became popular in this country (not the posthumous tripe written by Gardner and others). The appeal of the Bond character was that he was a very concentrated and accomplished weapon with a clear moral code.<br /><br />That's what we have in Jack Reacher, and I think helps explain his great and growing appeal. He's almost a modern-day version of Clint Eastwood's Man With No Name character in the spaghetti westerns. The prototypical Avenging Angel. He's remorseless in killing the bad guys, shows a strong moral code ( which seems to be getting rare these days ) upon which he has no fear or hesitation on acting, and is ruthlessly effective in carrying out his actions.<br /><br />After which, he rides off into the sunset! You've gotta love it!<br /><br />Sure, it's not timeless literature; so what? The Reacher books are about the most fun reads available anywhere.<br /><br />Get this book. If you haven't read the other Reacher books, get them, too.
B0009SOFFY|5.0|The pinnacle of punk rock. The desperation, edginess are part of the monotony. Hey, he didn't have a lot of fun.

B0000BWVCM|3.0|I'll keep this short and to-the-point. I am a life long reader of comic books. I love them and passionately anticipate and enjoy most of the recent motion pictures based on them.  <br />DC and Dark Horse comics have always been my favorites, and aside from The Punisher and Ghost Rider, I do not care too much for Marvel. However, despite that, I enjoyed the original X-Men very much. I think Bryan Singer is one of the most talented directors of his generation (see The Usual Suspects.)  <br /> <br />Yet, I was really disappointed by this sequel. Don't get me wrong, X2 is a very well done comic book adaption when compared to shameful misfires such as Hulk and Elektra, yet I do not believe it to be nearly as wonderful as everyone says. The whole film just feels so muddled and pointless to me. The ending drags on forever, and doesn't really have much of anything new to offer. Perhaps I missed something, but other than the addition of the awesome Nightcrawler character, this felt very routine and meaningless. I can't say I have very high hopes for X3 either. <br />I do highly recommend the original X-Men, but I don't feel either of these films come close to the real masterpieces in the genre, such as Batman Begins, Hellboy, V For Vendetta, or Sin City.
B000002INR|4.0|Skid Row is one of my most favorite bands by far and this album is also one of my favorites. Skid Row is usually lumped in with pussy metal bands such as Bon Jovi because of this album but although thier sound on this album is a-bit pop metal thier attitude is much closer to Guns N Roses as can be herd on such tracks as \\"Youth Gone Wild\\" and \\"18 And Life\\". If you are just beginning to listen to Skid Row you should wait to buy this album as it may give you the wrong idea. Get \\"slave To The Grind\\" or \\"sUBHUMAN rACE\\". Overall KICK ASS album.

B000FQJAIW|1.0|The chief selling point for this release is that it supposedly contains the original version of the film on the bonus DVD. This is not true. It in fact contains the Laserdisc version of the film made in 1993 on DVD and is not a dedicated DVD transfer of the original quality (if it were, it would most likely be released in the anamorphic DVD format).    The only people who should buy this DVD are those who don't mind wasting money and those who either don't care about the original trilogy or want to support the original trilogy even knowing the details of this obviously substandard DVD release.
B00005JOVH|4.0|It's good to know that a comic book adaptation can still show some degree of complexity. \\"X-Men: The Last Stand\\"--the third and most likely final film in the series--transcends a lot of other superhero stories by presenting a meaningful, thought provoking story, one that parallels the reality of equality and acceptance. This is not just an emotionless gathering of highly choreographed action sequences; it goes deeper by presenting a genuine sense of morality and ethical issues. It accomplishes its task without getting satirical or preachy, while at the same time providing enough computer generated eye candy to remain entertaining.    But for a film that provides a decent dose of humanity in the midst of stylized violence, it seems oddly incomplete. I think the meticulous attention to substance resulted in the neglecting of some crucial plot-advancing methods. For one, a couple of characters were introduced but never adequately defined. Take, for example, Warren Worthington III (Ben Foster). He's a mutant who has the ability to sprout majestic white wings and fly (appropriately giving him the nickname Angel). His father (Michael Murphy) is the head of a corporation that has discovered an antibody capable of altering the genetic structure of mutants, turning them mortal. In essence, a \\"cure\\" has been found. He tries to give the injection to his son, but he dramatically flies away (through the office window, no less). After that, he virtually disappears from the movie. I felt as if the chance to get to know him was never given.    Another character left in the dark was Jimmy, also known as Leech (Cameron Bright). We do know that he's the source of the mutant-altering antibody, something powerful enough to render a mutant's abilities useless even when standing in his presence. But that's pretty much all we know. Who exactly are his parents? How did this corporation get a hold of him? Do they ever intend to let him go? None of this is helped by the fact that Cameron Bright played virtually the same role in \\"Ultraviolet\\"; how many times in one year can the same actor portray the source of a controversial cure?    Still, I have to give credit where credit is due, and I think that despite the issues I have with the film's structure and characterizaton, it's still a worthwhile experience. A majority of the story connects to the mysterious return of Dr. Jean Grey (Famke Jannsen), the powerful mind reader thought to have been killed at the end of \\"X2: X-Men United.\\" The other characters still believe she's dead at the beginning of \\"The Last Stand,\\" and no one is taking it harder than Scott Summers, better known as Cyclops (James Marsden). He and Logan/Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) have never gotten along because of her, and her apparent death only made things worse between them. Scott's anger and pain drives him to return to the lake where she drowned. There, he hears her voice calling his name, so much so that it overcrowds the thoughts in his head. She then appears before him, and the two engage in a passionate reuniting kiss. But all is not as it seems; something in Jean has changed, something that affects her ability to control her powers. And unfortunately for Scott, it's too late for him to do anything about it.    Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) knows that all of this is going on, and he seems to be succumbing to the stress of the whole situation (as well as of teaching at his mutant-friendly school). Even Ororo Munroe/Storm (Halle Berry) seems to think that something is bothering him, and while he insists that she shouldn't worry herself, her concern grows (especially since he considers her his eventual successor). And it grows even deeper when Jean is brought back. That's when the Professor attempts to psychically locate this unstable force within her and put it back in its cage. It's a force called Phoenix, Jean's alternate personality that operates on primal emotions, including rage. Jean ultimately endures psychological turmoilas she attempts to gain control of her mind. She's not the same Jean Grey we used to know, and she may never be again.    The other part of this story involves Eric Lensherr/Magneto (Ian McKellen) and the war he declares against humanity. While the previous two films portrayed him strictly as the evil villain, the third film actually gives legitimacy to his bitterness. According to him, the vaccine is not a \\"cure\\" at all; it's merely a way to turn people of above-average ability into regular mortals. It's a volatile situation, especially since mutants are now a part of the American government. Here enters Dr. Hank McCoy/Beast (Kelsey Grammer), a blue, furry behemoth who recognizes both the drawbacks and benefits the vaccine has to offer. He works closely with the Professor as well as with the President (Josef Sommer) in the hopes of avoiding conflict between those who applaud the cure and those who oppose it (knowing full well that the point is probably moot).    This aspect of the story shows a fairly realistic reaction towards a controversial idea. Some mutants are genuinely attracted to the prospect of finally being considered normal. Because of that, they wait in long lines to receive the vaccine. Marie/Rogue (Anna Paquin) is someone who takes the idea into serious consideration; her inability to touch without causing physical harm has driven a wedge between her and her boyfriend, Bobby/Iceman (Shawn Ashmore).    But just as many mutants are outraged, and they are the ones who militantly join Magneto's cause. He already has Raven/Mystique (Rebecca Romijn) and John Allerdyce/Pyro (Aaron Stanford) as his main accomplices, but if he's to succeed in stopping the humans, he needs others at his side. He manages to attract a new group of mutants: the lightening-fast Callisto (Diana Ramirez); the duplicitous Multiple Man (Eric Dane); the burly, hotheaded Cain Marko/Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones); and the prickly Spike (Ken Leung). Magneto also needs to build an army large enough to successfully attack the site of the vaccine's production (which, interestingly, is the former site of Alcatraz). Lastly, he'll need Jean, a woman with powers greater than even his. Magneto slyly encourages her to unleash her dark side. Eventually he'll understand just how dangerous she has become, not only to herself, but to everyone else, as well.    The movie culminates with a final battle at the heart of San Francisco Bay. Like any comic book film, it's an entertaining, highly stylized sequence that includes death, destruction, and redemption. Some of the moments are new and surprising while others are entirely expected. Does that make it a bad scene? Not really: for the most part, it's a lot of fun. However, I was turned off by a couple of things, including Kelsey Grammer's participation in the fight scenes. His overall performance was too sophisticated to allow for testosterone-driven kicks and punches. He should have remained the calm, intelligent politician he started out as, one who fights with words rather than fists.    I realize this has been a strange review, seeing as I pointed out a lot of flaws in a film that's pretty well made. It's not a perfect sequel by any means, but I did find its willingness to be complex and insightful very meaningful. This could have easily been just another low-grade science fiction/action/adventure extravaganza, something entertaining yet shallow. \\"The Last Stand\\" cleverly disguises real social issues as a comic book plotline, and I think that's what made it the most compelling. True, a few loose ends were not tied up, and some of the explanations are vague at best. But its humanity outweighs its shortcomings, and for that, I'm going to recommend it. Hopefully, it can effectively shed some light on the issues we face today.
B000FQJAIW|1.0|<br />Lucas is once again showing his contempt for the greatest movies of all time and his disrespect for the fans that made him rich. <br /> <br />He is trying to erase these classic films in favour of his constantly revised CGI, slapstick versions. He thinks by fobbing us off with inferior transfers he can achieve this. <br /> <br />Please don't buy them. We all deserve better. <br /> <br />Lucas will likely still be smugly laughing all the way to the bank but we need to stand up for the classics - classics that deserve a proper release. <br /> <br />The covers are awful too.
1400079179|5.0|This book captivated me within the first three pages and I didn't put it down until I read it from cover to cover. A friend loaned it to me along with an art book of Da Vinci's sketches and paintings that were mentioned in the novel. I was very impressed with Mr. Brown's research regarding the Priory of the Sion, Grail Lore, sacred geometry, Mary Magdalene, LdV's artwork, and the research on Rosslyn. What he has written is not new to individuals who are interested in this aspect of religious history. There are a myriad of books out there discussing the Grail Lore. I am just so impressed with his ability to take these facts and weave them into a modern murder mystery, starting out at the Louvre, winding around Paris and its outskirts, until the reader is flown to England and zipping around London. I could *not* put this down. Bravo!
B000065KH4|5.0|Hello All, this is a response to Jerome Quigley (see his review below). <br /> <br />I would first like to say that this was a wonderful film. <br /> <br />My beef with the comment below is that Jerome said he would not recommend this film to children under 2000... Surely children do not live that long?!?!!!?  <br /> <br />Dr. K <br /> <br />P.S Juliete Binoche rocked in this film! <br />
B00005JNEI|3.0|This well intentioned documentary about George W Bush was mostly enjoyable, but I would have to say it was somewhat ruined for me by the fat tramp character who kept popping up and moaning about the war. Less of him in the sequel please. <br />
B000EPR7NE|4.0|Oscar-winner Hans Zimmer's at times beautifully passionate and powerful, but always ambianic soundtrack manages not to invoke images of the controversial book or movie, but creates a wonderful mood that manages to be spiritual and secular at the same time.  It's not the type of score you listen to picturing images from the movie, but rather stands on its own as a well crafted musical composition.
B00000JSJC|4.0|This movie just showed on the FX channel so I watched it after seeing it for the first time since it was first released on cable.  I had forgotten a lot of the plot but the characters are unique and maybe because a woman direct it, the Angela Basset character is very strong.  Anything with AB is a plus.  Fiennes can disappear into roles and I don't see any of his other characters in this performance.  The plot itself is a bit thin, but it unfolds through a lot of character interaction.  I prefer this type of scifi movie to one where theres just a lot of shooting and special FX (that's right SW, I'm talking to you).
B000AL730O|5.0|have to do justice with this man, he has done some awful in his long career, but there a re times when he remembers that he was once the creative force within the best rock band ever!!. <br />This album is a gem from start to finish, his last 3 albums (from flaming pie) were great, each one being better than the previous one. <br />Come on, he's over 60 and has nothing to prove, but he still has the joy fore making music and in the meantime making us a little bit happier!!. <br />Thank you again paul.
B000EQ4G5K|5.0|I am an artist myself. I'm also black. My choice of music is pop and rock and a little bit of r and b. Pop and rock are not only my choices because I love them, but let's face it; it sells more. Notice Rihanna's album is doing way better than her last album. <br />White people buy CDs and black people burn them. THink about. WHo would you more cater to???? You'rw in the music business to make money.  <br />Also I think black people need to stop bickering and be open minded. I can't tell you how many black people I hear say they don't like rock and so forth. Diversify your self to music. Why be one-sided. <br />And to buddy that wrote like a whole negative essay on RIhanna's CD. I can't believe you had the time to sit and actually take apart her whole CD even to the midis. Do you know what makes a great album? The songs. Whether you use a pot and pan to make the music, music is music. Do you think when people pick up a CD to pourchase they ask them selves \\"Geez did she use a midi in here? I wonder if a harp was used? Was this album made in my state?\\" No they don't. They pick up the CD because they love the sound, lyrics, are both. Remember life isn't perfect, no one is perfect, nothing is perfect, no album is perfect.
B00005JOVH|2.0|I *really* liked X-Men 2. I wasn't such a fan of the first movie, but I did appreciate that the writers and producers couldn't cram ALL of the characterisation and development of the characters into one two-and-a-bit hour movie - and it was a pretty decent first effort, as franchise sci-fi goes. <br /> <br />This movie, on the other hand, is just pretty flat, all things considered. And, even though it weighs in at a hefty running time and contains a number of potentially very entertaining plot elements, it's still just... well, just plain flat.  <br /> <br />The problem occurs with the script: Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn's screenplay contains surprisingly little dialogue; most of the movie feels like a segue from one special effects sequence to another. In an age where it's so obvious on a movie screen as to what's real and what's not, one would have thought that the writers might have focused a little more on the characters that have kept Marvel fans loyal for the last almost-fifty years. Alas no, and what we're sadly left with is a thin and perfunctory sort of movie, where the characters, at least via their characterisation, come across as two-dimensional and wooden. <br /> <br />Acting's pretty average - Ian McKellen in Magneto's more powerful scenes looks like he's suffering from 'Mommie Dearest' syndrome, Patrick Stewart isn't given enough to do, and Hugh Jackman and Halle Berry do great jobs at looking either A. Angry or B. Blank. The one high point on the acting front for me was Kelsey Grammer in the role of Beast - during the penultimate battle scenes he comes across as a whole and likeable sort of character, compared to Jackman's incessant grunting or Berry's woeful whining. <br /> <br />And that was another big problem - with a credited cast of many, many people, why did this movie become the Hugh and Halle Show?? <br /> <br />All in all, this was a big disappointment. It will appeal to the rabid fanboy element, but for fans of action and science fiction, it's nowhere near the fleshed-out fullness of, say, 'Batman Begins' or 'Episode III'.
0804102988|5.0|Sarum tells the tale of the historic heartland of southern England, Salisbury. Originally founded as an Iron Age hill fort by the Romans, the Normans gave it the name Sarum. And when the action moved down the hill to the new settlement of Salisbury, the old site becomes Old Sarum.<br /><br />Rutherfurd tells the history of the Salisbury area from earliest times in his standard style by following the fortunes of five families. Witness the history of Stonehenge, the Roman empire, the Salisbury Cathedral, the Black Death, and the Industrial Revolution.<br /><br />I rank Sarum at the top of Rutherfurd's grand historical epics. A satisfying read for fans of historical fiction. Outstanding.
0307277674|3.0|The book splits itself into two distinct parts, the controversial background material and the suspense-chase story. It bounces unevenly back and forth, never really blending them in a satisfying way.<br /><br />The suspense sequences are surprisingly lame and hokey at times. The background work (plausible or not) is much more interesting and easilly overtakes the horribly flawed narrative.<br /><br />I couldn't get over how events near the end contradict - even cancel out - the beginning. The author presents developments which can be seen to render the whole damn plot unnecessary.<br /><br />Overall, OK basically sums it up.
B000EYK4KI|3.0|I almost - *almost* - bought the original Elektra single disc DVD, but didn't when I found out about the directors' cut.  Then I bought the 2-disc one. Unfortunately, not only Fox, but every studio wants to double-dip anymore.  It's going to be a matter of withstanding temptation.  If you can hold on for a few months, it'll pay off in the end and you'll get the all-the-bells-and-whistles movie you SHOULD have received the first time.  This will be my first time seeing the movie, so I can't give it a rating anything but in the middle so far.  I feel sorry for those who paid for the first version, really.
B00005JLEU|5.0|It was at least two years ago when I watched \\"Spirited Away.\\" I still remember so many vivid details about it. The exquisitely drawn characters and scenery, combined with lovely colours make it very easy to remember a lot about this movie. The plot is much better than most animated movies I have watched, but even a small child can enjoy it, if only for the unique characters seen in this film. It is very enthralling, and you may find yourself being sucked in, and forgetting that you are actually watching a movie.  <br /> <br />Because of the uniqueness of this movie, some people may not enjoy it. They may find it to be \\"weird\\" or the plot to be too slow. If you are open-minded, though, and enjoy anime (or even if you aren't familiar with anime, but can take an animated movie seriously enough to give it a chance) you will probably like this movie. Even after two years, I remember loving this movie and I plan on buying for myself very soon.
B000EWBNMS|5.0|Being somewhat of a disbeliever in psychic phenomena, I really avoided watching this show for awhile. That was my loss. What I didnt realize was that this show is for BELIEVERS AND NONBELIEVERS alike. You don't have to believe in psychics or mindreading abilities.<br /><br />  Because, let's face it: so many movies, from Batman to Lord of the Rings, depend on our suspension of belief, on our saying, \\"What if?\\" Medium is no different. If you believe, fine; if not, you can simply say, \\"What if? What if someone COULD read minds?\\"<br /><br />  And so I decided to go along with the premise and imagine what it WOULD be like for someone who had the psychic abilities Allison does. I also became involved in the details of her life, her family and how her job and home life intertwine. This isn't a series built around a \\"gimmick\\". It is a fully fleshed out show, one that gets more complex and interesting as time goes on.<br /><br />  The relationship between Allison and her husband is a bit edgy, not always smooth and harmonious. They clearly love each other but he becomes frustrated with her at times. After all, she has a habit of waking up from terrible dreams, often in the middle of the night,dreams warning her of some impending crisis - or perhaps giving her clues to solve a crime. In any case, she is always having visions and she is also quite sensitive. This leaves him baffled  - and sometimes his anger comes out.<br /><br />  Her job and home life can't be kept separate. They intersect in all sorts of ways and it is this connection that gives the show real substance. At this point, I can't wait to see what happens next. Patricia Arquette seems to be more comfortable with her role as time goes on, seems to have a real sense of who Allison is. The show is a pleasure to watch.
1557424292|5.0|This book was truly one of the jewels filled with beauty that will never fade with time. It was the way I think a book should be written. The plot was both intriguing and unsettling. The ending to this beautifully told story would be - in itself - reason enough to read it.<br /><br />Although, the plot is not even the best reason to read \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray.\\" Lord Henry Wotton, one of the main characters, hold beliefs so incredible that they actually prove to be quite credible. They are very interesting to read, and you may find yourself agreeing with the majority of what he says, as I did.<br /><br />Make sure not to skip over the preface. It is also quite interesting. The whole book in very fascinating and enjoyable. But, be warned, chapter eleven is quite difficult, so make sure you are able to concentrate on it when you read it (although, it does not exactly play a large role in the plot of the book).
B000E1155E|5.0|Despite the multitude of seemingly lukewarm reviews I've read here ad nauseum from the armchair critics (who all seem compelled to belittle the band) the undeniable fact is that they still give the cd 4/5 stars! So, if these people all really like the cd so much why resort to cheap insults? I see no such reason to justify doing that in this review. Simply put, this is the cd of the year to date in 2006. The music sends shockwaves down the spine with menacing guitars, then just as swiftly, Arctic Monkeys juxtapose a heavy riff with a quiet ballad, all the while stringing together one fine song after another. They remind me of Oasis for all the right reasons: they're loud and crass AND they gave us all a swift kick in the arse. 5/5 stars for the lads from Sheffield.
0767834739|3.0|I dunno quite how you should rate this movie.  Certainly, it is bad, but it is also amusing.  3 stars and a C seems fair, I suppose.  Anyway, It's really quite a sight. You don't often see movies in this day and age with this kinda of budget that is as flatly goofy as 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse'.  The original RE film was stupid, yes, but it really wasn't in the same league as this one in terms of sheer wackiness. (To the best of my recollection, anyway. It's been quite a while...)  Still, you've gotta give RE: Apocalypse this: It's gotta whole helluva lotta action.  It's quite nonstop the first like 2/3 of the movie, though it actually slows down some towards the end. It actually gets a little dull for a while, but the final fights, particularly the outrageous kung-fu battle between Alice and Nemesis are sufficiently hilarious as to get the movie back on track, or at least as on track as it ever was.<br /><br />Anyway, this one takes place directly after the original, with the zombies and various other monster having escaped the Hive and laying waste to Raccoon City (It's adorable that they kept that name, by the way.)  It is shortly sealed off by the Evil B*stards in charge of Umbrella.  Also, there's a scientist dude who invented the T-Virus and isn't quite as evil and he wants to get his daughter out out, and there's Nemesis whose been let loose in the city and he's a jerk, and Alice is there too and a bunch of STARS people and a reporter and also this jive-talking black dude who is quite likely to offend those who are wont to be offended by things and blah blah blah.  Anyway, they've got to run around and yell and shoot a lot of zombies and lickers and some zombie dogs whatnot.  And so they do.<br /><br />To give credit where credit is due, the set design and art direction in this film are generally quite excellent.  I particularly like the large church/cathedral they take refuge in.  However, the cinematography and editing leave a lot to be desired. It's trying to be hypermodern and flashy but it's mostly just chintzy.  I'm not really opposed to this kinda thing in and of itself, but it's easy to screw it up, and that's what they've done here.  The action scenes aren't exciting, but they do have a sorta goofy energy to them that makes them fun.  Also, the film is never in the least bit scary, but what can I say, I'm a sucker for zombies.  These ain't the greatest zombies ever, but they work.  However, the film is utterly devoid of gore, which is quite aggravating and unforgivable.  We don't even get any notable close-ups of zombies getting their brains blasted out, and you need like a bare minimum of 15 of those in your zombie movie. (You could perhaps go a bit lower here, as shooting them in the head isn't necessary, but there need to be a lot more than none of them, anyway.)<br /><br />Performances are generally either comical or flat.  Milla Jovovich is quite dull and really not all that attractive as our crazy semi-mutant hero Alice.  Sienna Guillory is our second major protagonist, Jill Valentine, and is better than Milla, or better looking anyway, which is what mostly counts in this kinda movie.  As you probably already know, they dress her as Jill was dressed in RE3,(i.e. tube top and mini skirt) which amuses me to no end.  This does not strike as the most practical battle outfit, but she didn't really have time to prepare, I guess, and she does look pretty damn hot, so I'm not complaining.  Also in attendance is some dude playing Carlos.  I do not remember a single thing about him, apart from one utterly hilarious line of dialogue.  There's also this Nickolai dude.  He's pretty cool. He's my favorite character, in fact, but he hasn't got that much screen time, sadly.<br /><br />As if I haven't made this clear yet, this is definitely a good-bad movie.  I wasn't quite laughing at it, but I was smirking, continually, which is about the same thing.  I had a good time watching it, what can I say. Wouldn't mind watching it again some day.  It gives me hope for future video game movies, that they can still be stupidly amusing.  They've headed in a bad direction as of late, with 'Silent Hill' and 'Doom' being stupidly boring rather than stupidly watchable.  RE:Apocalypse gives us the real goods, at least as far as this kinda movie goes.<br /><br />Also, it does have perhaps the greatest line in all of film.  Some STARS dudes are discussing how, after they've been left in Raccoon City, they don't matter to the corporation and they're expendable and then Carlos (I believe) says: 'We've just been expended.'  HA!!!!!!!!!  That is frickin' hilarious.  I believe the proper term would be spent.  Anyway, an entertaining movie.<br /><br />Grade: Cme hope for future video game movies, that they can still be stupidly amusing.

0060763280|5.0|I just attended one of Mr. Eker's seminars and read the book. I think both are fabulous and full of vaulable ideas. To those complaining abot the book all I can say is \\"you're broke\\". Those of you who read and understand the book will know what that means. I've read 2 reviews that are classic responses from broke people. If you think you only need enough money for yourself then that means you are too selfish to care about helping anyone else. I've spent quite a bit of time around poor people and all of my current and previous friends do, in fact, resent the rich or anyone who has more than they do. Read this book and get an education people. You owe it to the world and your families to create wealth in your life.
B000FQJAIW|1.0|Read all reviews carefully. Note all the \\"one-star\\" reviews.    Why?    Unless they change their minds, Lucasfilm has decided to simply transfer the LASERDISC versions of the STAR WARS trilogy to DVDs. You probably will have to write the titles on the discs yourself with an exclusive Clonetrooper-shaped CD-marker.    The quality you get will be just a wee bit better than your old rotten VHS tapes.     This is a quick marketing ploy to suck some money out of STar Wars fans before they release another set in 2007 (30th anniversary for Star Wars).    Lucasfilm has sent a response to fans asking about this, and confirming laserdisc transfers (thus, non-anamorphic like all DVDs even transfers of old movies).    I am talking about the original trilogy discs here of course. The \\"special\\" edition discs are, of course, worthless to any old school Star Wars nut.    Lucasfilm will pacakge the original, unaltered (unaltered in terms of, well they were actually altered quite a bit before the laserdisc too) as BONUS MATERIAL, while most fans are interested PRIMARILY in the original films. BONUS, of course, so they don't have to do squat except hire a guy to copy the laserdiscs over to DVD. They probably pay him with left-over Jar Jar Binks merchandise.
B0007VZ9DK|4.0|Robert DeNiro plays an intelligent casino owner in Las Vegas. His leadership style and high standards leads to a very successful operation. The muscle behind his casino, played by Joe Pesci, takes care of any problems facing the casino using classic mob means- but the man eventually gets out of control which leads to a series of trouble throughout the movie. <br />Their lives, which start at the high life, gradually decline and the results become trajic- like most mafia movies.  <br />Everything about the movie is great, but it does become very long and drawn out once you realize that disaster is immenent.
B000FQJAIW|1.0|To those who say that anamorphic makes little difference in picture quality-- you are wrong. On televisions that can take advantage of it, it means a 33% increase in lines of resolution. More lines of resolution equals better picture. Even if you don't have a widescreen tv now, you most likely will in the future, and you will miss the extra resolution. Some non-widescreen sets (4x3) can also display anamorphic titles properly as well. <br />
B000EQ5TSI|3.0|When I think of the amazing schemes and plotting of the original, I was amazed to find that this sequal had none of that. In John Woo fashion, it is pure action and a pretty good amount of symbolism throughout the film.  <br />The action actually is really exciting and the soundtrack is a great booster to the stunts. I was also happy to learn Cruise did a vast majority of the stunts himself. <br />However, the overuse of the fake masks makes the movie very boring and predictable. So, prepare to see a lot of action but dont be expecting to be duped or confused like MI1.
B000A3DFZE|4.0|Eric Clapton is 60 something.  Let him the **** alone.  If you don't like his output here, go listen to Wheels of Fire for the zillionth time and pretend that half of it isn't dated and boring.  Listen to the album in its proper context: he has earned the right to make the music that he wants; you have the right to take it or leave it.  He's not doing another Layla, ever, and he does not have to do one.  The music here is good, period. Enjoy it if your head isn't messed up on Clapton mythology.
B00005JMJG|5.0|People hardly ever see funny man Jim Carrey in a serious movie- but his performance in this creative movie is superb! Not only his performance but the cast of Kate Winslet and many other great actor/actresses proves perfect and beautiful in a movie such as this.  <br />This is the story of a man whose girlfriend was so much in love, that upon the completion of their relationship opts to get her memory of him erased. He soon discovers this proceedure and does the same thing. However, once the process has began, he has a change of heart and although the memories are disappearing one by one, he is fighting for just one more moment with the woman he loves.  <br />There are a few subplots on the side that are equally as great and dramatic that builds up for an exciting yet glorious ending. Hardly ever does a movie really make you feel good when its over, Eternal Sunshine accomplishes just that.
B000687M48|4.0|Overall, I like this.  Evanescence gave an outstanding performance (although some songs sounded a little alike), and I was surprised at good they sounded live.  Also included are the band's music videos to date, which are worth checking out if you haven't seen them before.  The \\"insightful\\" behind-the-scenes segment offers a personal look at the band, revealing a free-spirited (although sometimes silly) side that one would not expect when considering the content of their music.    That said, this package is still far from perfect.  My cheif complaint was the videography itself.  There are lots of unnecessary special effects edited into the performances, and the cameras switch so often and so quickly that it actually makes the show uncomfortable to watch at times.  Also, the CD track listing is incorrect, and this could potentially cause some problems when trying to copy songs from the CD.    Because of those complaints, I would recommend this primarily for Evanescence fans, especially those who have never seen them play live.  For everyone else, I suggest checking out the \\"Fallen\\" album first.
0446310786|4.0|This seems to be one of those books many schools are requiring kids to read. I have to admit, if you have to read a book for school, this books ain't bad. I mean would you rather read The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (which I personally thought was a bore), or To Kill a Mockingbird (not nearly as bad)? If you get a choice between a list of books, I'd pick this one. I wouldn't watch the movie though. That music is just too much. Terrible music. Only two songs and the worst part- THEY STICK IN YOUR HEAD FOR DAYS! <br /> <br />But back to the book, I guess it's actually pretty good. I like reading good quality literature and this definately makes the cut. It's probably not appropriate for younger children seeing as it deals with racism and rape but it doesn't go into much detail so its okay for middle school and up. I would probably even let a 5th grader read it or a mature 4th grader.  <br /> <br />Yeah, the book...um, i guess I probably would have read it even if it wasn't assigned cuz it's pretty good and doesn't take that long to read. It kinda depends on your style I guess.
B000FQJAIW|1.0|Fool me once:  shame on you.  Fool me twice:  shame on me.<br /><br />A few days ago, I got back a report I commissioned from NASA.  It cost approximately $300,000, mostly for some time on an IBM distributed supercomputer.  And that report revealed that George Lucas has released approximately 16,390 versions of Star Wars, each of which is his current \\"Vision\\".  Interestingly, each new DVD set has little to do with technological advances or brilliant new formats, rather the answer is rather simple:  WE KEEP BUYING THEM.<br /><br />This latest version has the theatrical versions, in a crude, non-industry standard non-anamorphic format, thrown on as \\"extra material\\" to the highly-altered 2004 versions.  It is astonishing that a man allegedly invested in advancing the cinematic arts and technology would treat some of the greatest movies ever in such a cold and callous way.  Those theatrical versions made him into the global juggernaut he is today, and he can't even be bothered to make a vaguely acceptable formated copy of them for today's market.  It is truly amazing.<br /><br />And, of course, next year is the 30th annniversary of Star Wars.  People are getting so sick of these lame DVD stunts, and so rightfully critical of Lucas, that Lucasfilm has had to preemptively deny that it won't just come out with another version next year!<br /><br />Lucas should wise up and just release the theatrical originals in a legitimate format so we can all go home and be happy.  I'm tired of wasting money on him, and on Star Wars - whatever version he happens to believe in today.
B000001FS3|5.0|I think this is the best U2 album and one of my TOP 10 favorite albums of all times. I had two vinyls at the time (it came out before CDs) that I wore thin and one cassette that I used to travel with in my walkman (no ipods back then). I think this album epitomizes the very best of U2's creative genius. Nothing they have ever done comes close to this one accept maybe How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb... If you've never heard this album, once you listen, you'll never stop...it's simply timeless. Extremely recommended.
6305657947|2.0|As soon as I realized who was in this film, I knew how it was going to go. Its Pierce Brosnan . Playing James Bond with another name. In this movie he's a rich guy {thief} with a thing for art. Of course, he kept all of his UNCANNY charm from his Bond roles.  If you wanna see Brosnan {effortlessly} make fools of EVERYONE {like he does in every movie he plays in} then this is for you. Personally I find it hard to care about a character that NEVER has it rough.

B0000AZKLF|5.0|Albert King and SRV appeared on the Canadian TV show 'In Session' and the result was incredible.  The music itself is really good, with two great musicians playing the tunes they loved.  But it's the dialogue between Albert and SRV that puts this over the top. <br /> <br />Albert's story about Stevie sitting in with him about 10 years earlier when he was just a skinny kid in Austin was amazing.  And while SRV was coming into his own at the time of the session, he was still paying a lot of respect to Albert.  There was this aspect of passing the baton from one generation of blues players to another about this session. <br /> <br />Finally if the combination of 'Who Is Stevie' and 'Pride & Joy' doesn't have you smilin' and hummin' along - then you just don't like the blues.   <br /> <br />You can't go wrong with this CD.  In addition to the good music the recording is also pretty realistic.  I keep wondering what it would have been like to be in the studio when this session was recorded...
0385336691|5.0|I'm a big Lee Child fan.  As far as I'm concerned, the tight-lipped, human arsenal Jack Reacher is the most compelling figure in contemporary escapist thriller fiction.  So when I tell you that \\"The Hard Way\\" is the best novel of its kind to hit the shelves in the last few years, I'll admit I'm biased.<br /><br />This is the tenth in the Reacher series, and it may be the best.  In \\"Hard Way\\", trouble finds Reacher innocently enough, sitting in a New York sidewalk caf sipping an espresso.  Events unwind, and soon our hero is locked-and-loaded in solving a kidnapping, thick as thieves with a team of mercenary thugs, contemporary soldiers of fortune with shady backgrounds led by former Special Forces colonel Edward Lane.  Lee Child is at his best when spinning a good mystery for Reacher to solve, and nagging incongruities surrounding the kidnapping of Lane's wife and daughter provide the perfect backdrop for Child to practice his craft.  \\"The Hard Way's\\" Reacher is a bit wiser, more mature, using more brain and less brawn.  More Sherlock Holmes and less Rambo this time around.  In fact, more than 300 pages have turned before Reacher actually hurts someone, but the Child layers the tension and drops hints masterfully, leading up to a climax that will have you sweating right through your Barcalounger.  The author's patented lean and no-nonsense prose is in top form, but what makes Child so readable are the obscure little bits of knowledge and factoids tucked away in cracks and corners of the plot, adding enough depth and authenticity to give the larger-than-life Reacher credibility that sets him apart from the just plain silly superheroes of so many \\"thrillers\\" of the day.<br /><br />So to wrap it up, \\"The Hard Way\\" is about as good as it gets - intelligent, clever, a .50 caliber pressure tank tale that twists and turns and jumps from Greenwich Village to Africa's west coast - of bad guys doing bad things and paying the price to an avenging angel in the form Jack Reacher.  One word of warning: don't start reading this unless you've got some free hours ahead, for once started, \\"The Hard Way\\" is likely to trash plans for the weekend or keep you up way past bedtime.  But the again, I'm biased.Reacher.

B00005JOVH|4.0|If you read -X-Men- comics, loved the previous movies, or just plain love explosive confrontations, then -X3: The Final Conflict- is the film for you.  So BE WARNED!<br /><br />If, on the other hand, you prefer introspective love stories, passion mixed w/sorrow, jealousy in action, or tragedy mixed w/fury when a character metamorphoses ... OK, you'll still get `em, here, but in a very truncated form.  & characterization is pretty thin on the ground, except for Wolverine [Hugh Jackman, sinking his teeth in a meaty role], Storm [Halle Berry as a devastated woman trying to deal w/death as her world crumbles], Jean Grey [Famke Janssen is terrifying as the woman who evidently can't die ...  & won't face that fact] & Professor X [Patrick Stewart shine in a role that's far too brief].<br /><br />Altho there are a number of other roles [Kelsey Grammer as the Beast,  Shawn Ashmore as the Iceman, Anna Paquin as Rogue & Ellen Page as Kitty Pryde] that Have Their Moments, this film is primarily the former's.  As the Phoenix - here presented as a separate personality rather than an intergalactic Power -  sucks the life from those she loves, Jean Grey joins Magneto's [Ian McKellan, having a ball *again*, this time as the megalomaniacal mutant] Brotherhood to fight the mutant `cure' created by Warren Worthington II.<br /><br />Houses explode, tempests form, & the world is nearly brought to an end as the heroes battle the bad guys.  & there's a sweet denouement after the film itself [ya gotta stay to the end of the credits, for it] as a bonus...
1590581814|5.0|Moody, dark, and atmospheric, \\"Drive\\" is the perfect refresh of the pulp crime masterpieces of McBain, Westlake, and Block; a raw and rugged little novel of a guy we know only as Driver, Hollywood stunt driver by day and getaway man for criminals by night.  A simple tale - Driver gets set up on a robbery gone bad and plots his revenge on the mobsters who, as it turns out, have badly underestimated their mark.  But here the story takes a back seat to form.  For as a writer, James Sallis has serious chops.  Seedy characters and shady deals twisted around lean and mean prose lurching from halting street talk to phases that turn so slick you'd think Cormac McCarthy was reinvented.  And throw into this mix a nonlinear story line that hooks and jabs and keeps you off balance while building the mystique of this surrealistic little gem.  Charlie Huston, Dean Swierczynski, and Victor Gischler  - new masters all of contemporary noir.  Add James Sallis to the head of that class.  Unsettling, disturbing, brilliant - read it.
B000DZIGE4|4.0|\\"Jarhead\\" is a marine expression that describes a recruit as an open vessel waiting to be filled by the commanders that be and by the haircut that makes the marine look like one.  The movie is a recollection of the first Persian Gulf War, told from the point of view of Private Anthony Swofford (who wrote the book, but is played by Jake Gyllenhall) and his trek from marine recruit until the end of Operation Desert Storm.  The war only lasted six weeks, and his contributions only four days, but the process he undergoes is absorbing.  \\"Swoff\\" undergoes initiation and later reluctance until he meets his command leader Sgt. Sykes (Jamie Fox) who gets him ready.  His biggest challenge is keeping a fellow marine in check (Fowler, an ex-con) who seems unstable at best and incorrigible at worst.    The movie isn't as intense as the most acclaimed war movies, but it isn't less insightful.  We are given a palpable reality.  The scenes show the urgency of missing women, the boredom and agony of anticipation, and the wild comraderie in all its details.  The best scenes are when the narrative focuses on Swoff separate from his brigade and he shares his inner angst.  The dream sequence tells more than any scene and has a surreal stream-of-consciousness effect.  We also get a first-person feel to when they have to play football in the grueling 112 degree heat.  Other revelations are done well, too.  For instance, their frenzy is present when watching \\"Apocolyse Now\\".  There's an interview scene where Swoff and others show their reluctance to follow the military's command to keep silence about the downside of being a recruit.  (They're just brimming to tell it like it is.) Later, Swoff gets into big trouble during a holiday party where he shares contraband liquor.  The war itself, for all its brevity, in the movie and in real life, just tells the unvarnished truth.  It shows the war, like any war, in all its mundane horror.  Swoff leaves us with some concrete thoughts about how hisexperience changed him forever.    \\"Jar Head\\" is a good movie experience.  It feels genuine.  The performances are fine, too.  Gyllenhall makes the experience authentic, and the supporting cast is believable throughout.  Jamie Fox, in particular, shows an acting range here that makes us appreciate his other contributions.  (His Oscar for \\"Ray\\" seems all the more deserving after seeing this film.)  The music and other atmospherics help to create a solid movie--even if it doesn't brim with suspense.  Overall, it doesn't try to sensationalize anything.  (3 1/2-4 stars)
0446310786|5.0|I absolutely adore this book. I first had to read it in my sophomore high school English class, and I thought at first I would hate it.

B000ETQRCM|5.0|I have heard quite a bit of a band called 'Pearl Jam' and how it was a Seattle grunge band. Hearing that, I filed it in my mind in the 'Nirvana' folder. Then, about a month ago, a friend of mine showed me 'Rearview Mirror' and I changed my mind about them. I went and listened to this new effort from Pearl Jam, and I was impressed, now I am the proud and happy owner of a great CD by a great band. Don't just write this one off as another 'Nirvana'-copying group, because they are much, much more.

0307277674|5.0|Fast paced read full of twists and turns.  The only reason I read it was because of the hype.  It was well worth the afternoon it took to complete it.  It is not written for theologians, history buffs, or those obsessed with facts.  It is a product of the author's imagination, it is not fact, it is fiction. Great book and if you can get the illustrated version, it is even more fascinating.
B000002LBH|5.0|Anything by The Smiths, one of the best rock bands in history, should get 5 stars (except for maybe Meat is Murder, an indulgent but competent album). Louder Than Bombs is a true rarity - a collection a record label got right. Not only are most of the essential non-album songs included, but the song order could not have been better.  Whoever put this CD together should be applauded. <br /> <br />Out of all The Smiths CDs, only four are true original albums (Smiths, Meat is Murder, Queen is Dead, and Strangeways). Two are merely non-album singles and b-side collections (Hatful and World Won't Listen). Louder Than Bombs is a combination of the two collections and in my opinion better than either of them and, since it omits true album songs, is better.  <br /> <br />The seven main Smiths CDs are essential to any fan of rock/pop music. Despite, the Smiths CD discography is lacking - there are many different versions of songs that are very good and some have never appeared on CD (Wonderful Woman and Jeane).  <br /> <br />I don't understand record companies; another CD with these loose ends would complete The Smiths legacy. They erronously assume people download free songs because of price, when actually it is because for the most part they don't know what they are doing. Louder Than Bombs, however, is an exception.

B000066C4V|4.0|Directed by Robert Altman, this film take place in the English country side of the 1930s at the lavish and beautiful estate known as Gosford Park. Sir William McCordle (Michael Gambon) and his wife, Sylvia (Kristin Scott Thomas) host a large, weekend hunting party for a distinguished assemblage of guests, who arrive accompanied by their downstairs entourage.<br /><br />It soon becomes clear that the film revolves around a hodge podge of subplots and intrigues, both upstairs and downstairs, some of which are quite interesting, others seemingly less so. They all become pertinent, however, when one of them is murdered by someone in their midst. The film plays as if it were a more upscale and lavish version of the PBS series \\"Mystery\\" or as a film based upon an Agatha Christie mystery.<br /><br />The cast is stellar with excellent performances by all. Maggie Smith is outstanding in the role of Constance Trentham, a snobby, self-absorbed, old biddy in need of money, so that she can continue the lifestyle to which she is accustomed. Jeremy Northam is wonderful playing matinee idol, Ivor Novello, and continues to extend his range, as this role requires him to sing, which he does quite credibly, in fact.<br /><br />Helen Mirren and Eileen Atkins are superlative as the housekeeper, Mrs. Wilson, and the cook, Mrs. Croft, who are, apparently, at war with each other. Richard E, Grant, Alan Bates, Derek Jacobi, Emily Watson, and Kelly MacDonald are wonderful as part of the core of downstairs folks through whose eyes the viewer see events unfold.<br /><br />Stephen Fry deserves mention for his brief, though memorable, turn as the laid back Inspector Thompson, whose bumbling investigative efforts seem almost sure to leave the murder unsolved. The audience, however, knows who did it by film's end, even though Inspector Thompson appears not to have a clue.<br /><br />The cinematography is beautiful, as it captures the sumpuousness and richness of the upstairs life in the manor home. It also captures the bleakness and confinement of downstairs life, as well, serving to further underline the great divide that exists between the two. The gulf is further delineated by one of the subplots, which sees the character played by Ryan Phillippe gamely straddle both worlds.<br /><br />The one small problem I found with the film is that, because there are so many characters with their own subplots and intrigues, the film is somewhat confusing at times. Moreover, some of the dialogue is occasionally unintelligible and garbled, due to overlapping dialogue, which was a bit annoying. Watching the DVD with the English subtitles feature on, however, would probably resolve this issue.<br /><br />The DVD offers a number of interesting features, including an enjoyable mini- ducumentary of Altman's efforts to ensure authenticity of period detail. They apparently hired a cook, a butler, and a maid who were in service during the early nineteen thirties as a sort of sounding board as to how things were done. It also features two commentaries, as well as a short on the making of Gosford Park. It is a value packed DVD and well worth the money. Viewers who like period pieces and mysteries will especially enjoy it.It also captures the bleakness and confinement of downstairs life, as well, serving to further underline the great divide that exists between the two.

B000069HNW|3.0|This film tells the story of soulmates who seem destined to be together only to be torn asunder by fate. It relates the journey that each one will make alone, only to have the fates ultimately put to right what once went wrong.<br /><br />Kate Beckinsale is positively luminous as Sara Thomas, the beautiful, young woman with whom Jonathan Trager, earnestly played by John Cusack, falls in love. They meet while Christmas shopping. The scene where they meet, however, haggling over the last pair of black, cashmere gloves in Bloomingdale's, an upscale Department Store in New York City, seems a tad too forced and contrived. Still, they end up spending a few pleasant hours together, and it seems as if they were destined for one another. The fates, however, intervene, and their paths diverge, setting each one on a separate life journey. They will, at times, unknowingly criss cross each other's paths, until they are once again reunited by the very same fates that brought about their separation.<br /><br />Jeremy Piven gives an engaging, high energy performance in the role of Dean Kansky, Jonathan's best friend, reprising his real life relationship with John Cusack. Molly Shannon is adequate in the role of Eve, though she seems miscast. John Corbett does a star turn as Lars Hammond, Sara's fiance, a new age musician with a world wide following. The lovely Bridget Moynahan, as Jonathan's fiancee, is nothing more than a movie prop, so rotely does she play her part. Moreover, while Kate Beckinsale and John Cusack give excellent performances, the chemistry between them seems to be at the low end of the spectrum.<br /><br />This is, however, a reasonably enjoyable, though predictable, date flick in the tradition of \\"Sleepless in Seattle\\". It should appeal to those with a penchant for light, romantic comedies.
B00009MGGI|5.0|This is an English trilogy, cleverly done, which strikes at the heart of dirty British politics. Watch as Francis Urquhart, party Whip, maneuvers his way into the Prime Ministership, using any means necessary including cleverly arranged scandals, media manipulation and seduction, and yes, even murder. But don't think Urquhart's wife is an innocent. She's his master plotter, the evil voice in his head. She's ambitious and drives her husband to succeed. The plots are complicated, their execution flawless, and Urquhart becomes Prime Minister. And all this is just Disk 1.<br /><br />On Disk 2, Urquhart, now Prime Minister, has a new foe, the new king who's intentions are better than his practicality or senses. Urquhart and his wife must use all their wiles, launch the most clever of scandals to put this king in his place. Or the English form of government may not survive. But now Urquhart has a new allie, a pretty bright young thing, whom again he is urged to bed by his scheming wife. But the plot begins to thicken as the girlfriend becomes suspicious how Urquhart gets the seemingly impossible advance knowledge he is exploiting.<br /><br />Disk 3 finds Urquhart standing longer in office than Margaret Thatcher, but is he about to crash? There's been another murder, and his girlfriend allies with his chief whip to investigate the murder Urguhart committed in the first disk. As his reign begins to unravel, his wife becomes concerned for her future and Urquhart's legacy. And she may be the most dangerous predator of them all.<br /><br />Set in actual government buildings or their exact duplicates, this trilogy is the best political intrigue you will find. I've now seen it twice, and will soon watch it again.<br /><br />Keep your friends close, your enemies closer.
B0000633LR|5.0|This is a superlative film, directed by Ron Howard, someone who is sure to be remembered as a legend in his own time for the number of high quality films that he has directed, thus far. He is certainly one of the finest directors around today, and this film is certainly reflective of his talent. The technique that he employs to illustrate the descent of John Nash into the world of schitzophrenia is highly effective.<br /><br />Loosely based upon the biography of the same name by Sylvia Nasar, the world of schitzophrenia is brought to life in this film by a wonderful screenplay, deft direction, and superb acting. Featuring the life of Nobel Prize laureate, John Nash, this film begins to chronicle his life from 1947, when he was a young, promising, though eccentric, graduate student at Princeton University. The film delineates his lack of social skills, eccentricities, rise to prominence, marriage, and eventual descent into schitzophrenic hell. It follows his battle with madness and his own way of coping with his inner demons. It also shows how Nash's early work proved to be so influential that it netted him a Nobel Prize decades later. While a number of people have objected to the fact that this film leaves out some of the darker sides of Nash, one would do well to remember that this is not a documentary but merely a dramatization.<br /><br />Russell Crowe gives a memorable portrayal of the afflicted and tormented John Nash, beleagured by the devils that existed only in his mind. Ed Harris is compelling as the slightly sinister Parcher, a shadowy government operative whose existence is intertwined with that of John's. Paul Bettany, as he did in the role of Chaucer in \\"A Knight's Tale\\", once again almost steals the show in the role of John's alleged roommate and friend, Charles. Christopher Plummer is excellent as Dr. Rosen, the psychiatrist who appeals to the dormant rationality in Nash. While Jennifer Connelly gives a very good performance in the role of Alicia, John's caring wife, it does not rise to the level of Oscar worthy, though she won an Academy Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role.<br /><br />This two disc, widescreen, awards edition DVD clinches this as being worthy of five stars. It is an absolutely value laden two disc DVD. The first disc offers a widescreen version of the film in addition to two commentaries. One is by the director, Ron Howard. The other is by the screenwriter, Akiva Goldsman. The second disc is devoted entirely to special features. Particularly memorable is the feature with John Nash himself, explaining his theory on equilibrium. There is also a feature that shows the Nobel Prize awards of 1994 and Nash's acceptance of his in Economics. All in all, this is a great package deal and simply first rate.n's caring wife, it does not rise to the level of Oscar worthy, though she won an Academy Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role.<br /><br />This two disc, widescreen, awards edition DVD clinches this as being worthy of five stars.

0783240236|4.0|This is only my third Hitchcock movie, but I have to say that it isn't my favorite thus far. (although the other two I have seen, Vertigo and Rear Window, both deserve five stars with no questions asked) <br />Rear Window is brilliant in the way it can make the viewer delight in voyeurism (you may find yourself wondering what's going on in Miss Torso's window very often...) and the brilliant level of suspense it can wring out of something as simple as a phone call. <br />Vertigo is the kind of movie that should have changed the entire mystery genre, instead of becoming admired, yet ignored, by Hollywood as they churn out endless remakes and cookie-cutter movies. It can keep you watching with your eyes glued to the screen as the plot is masterfully, compellingly, and chillingly laid out only to take a sudden twist just as surprising, not to mention its technical mastery. <br />The Birds, however, is just too short. That's the only flaw I'll really hold against it, because just as the movie is building up to what feels like the middle of the movie, it ends. Even more disconcerting is the fact that there was a much better ending planned which was never shot. Luckily, the storyboard and script are shown on the DVD, so we have the benefit of imagining them.  <br />However, if there is one contribution this film has made, which to me at least is above all others, it is this: it laid the groundwork of the zombie genre. Think about this as you watch it, and you'll realize that the famous Night of the Living Dead owes everything to it, from its sudden, mysterious onset of zombiesm, its confined environment, and even its closing scene. <br />Overall, the movie is quite enjoyable, its only flaw being that it is too short. I reccommend it not only for its originality and technical mastery, but as brain food as well.
B000057V7R|4.0|Christopher McQuarrie's Academy Award winning, original screenplay, coupled with Bryan Singer's masterful direction of a stellar cast, makes for a complex and absorbing film. Told in flashback, the film recounts how five individuals on the wrong side of the law hook up to steal a multi-million dollar cache of cocaine from a docked vessel.<br /><br />Led by former Los Angeles detective turned bad guy, Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), Roger \\"Verbal\\" Kint (Kevin Spacey), Michael McManus (Stephen Baldwin), Todd Hockey ((Kevin Pollack), and Fred Fenster (Benicio Del Toro), proceed to their rendevous point and begin executing their plan of action. Their foray into this million dollar drug heist turns bad almost immediately. Something or someone is afoot who does not want them to succeed, and who seems to know their every move.<br /><br />The story is told in flashback by \\"Verbal\\" Kint, a club footed, crestfallen, soft spoken, unlikely looking criminal. He recounts the details of the doomed heist to hardnosed Detective, David Kujan (Chazz Palmentieri), building his story around an almost mythic, Hungarian crime lord named Keyser Soze. As \\"Verbal\\" details what happened, the viewer is mesmerized by his compelling narrative of how he and his partners in crime were inveigled into attempting this daring heist, which ultimately led to the disastrous events that culminated on the ship. It seems that their heist was probably destined to be doomed from the start, as another agenda may have been paramount to theirs.<br /><br />Kevin Spacey won a 1995 Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his low key, ingratiating portrayal of \\"Verbal\\" Kint. Gabriel Byrne also gives a compelling performance as the cop who ended on the wrong side of the law. The rest of the cast also give stellar performances, with the exception of Benicio Del Toro, who gives an odd, marble mouthed performance. Notwithstanding this, the film is really a splendid tour de force that is sure to captivate the viewer. Who is the mythic Keyser Soze? Watch the film and find out.o is the mythic Keyser Soze?

B00005OWEG|5.0|Never in my life has a movie had such a mind-blowing effect on me as when I watched Apocalypse Now. A movie that starts off promising to be a Full Metal Jacket clone, but becomes more and more until you want to peel off your clothes and go carve an idol of Marlon Brando to sacrifice animals to. <br />Apocalypse Now has the largest collection of unique characters I've seen in a movie so far, from the introspective, bland assassin Willard to the charismatic, surf-happy Kilgore, all the way to Marlon Brando's jungle god, Colonel Kurtz. <br />This is not only the single best Vietnam movie ever, but beats out every other war film I've seen thus far. Perhaps the much talked-about forthcoming Tarantino war flick will rival it, but that remains to be seen. This movie is more than a collection of dramatic deaths, heroic triumphs, and inevitable victory. Why? Because it doesn't have any of these things. There's not a single hero in the movie, not one redeeming quality among any of the characters. Nevertheless, we are compelled to watch as Willard and his crew make their way up the river through every obstacle until they find the new Gomorrah which Brando has established around himself.  <br />Beside the visceral disgust and terror you will feel, the amazement at the sounds and color, or the rich characters in the movie, it will leave you with the most profound sense of disillusionment and terror possible from a movie.
B00005O0Q4|5.0|This is a raw and powerful movie on the drug trade and its corresponding law enforcement response. It is a series of riveting, interlocking vignettes that tell the story on all fronts of the war on drugs. It paints a picture that will stay with the viewer for some time, so powerful is the imagery employed and so compelling are the actors in their performances.<br /><br />Michael Douglas plays the part of Robert Wakefield, a newly appointed drug czar, who tries to mount an all points attack on the drug trade. Naive and well meaning, he is, unbeknownst to him, being manipulated by the powers that be in Mexico, who are fighting a turf war over the profitable drug trade. He is so clueless that when the drug war actually lands on his door step, as when his teenage daughter, wonderfully portayed by Erika Christiansen, succumbs to peer pressure and becomes addicted to drugs, he is initially in heavy denial and ignores all the standard warning circles, until it is nearly too late<br /><br />Benicio Del Toro, in the star making role of Javier, an intelligent, decent, and honest Mexican law enforcement officer, who has his own war on drugs going on, is riveting with his quietly powerful performance . He, too, is being manipulated by the powers that be in Mexico. Nearly too late he realizes that the Mexican gweneral, who is ostensibly battling the war on drugs and to whom Javier had given his full support and cooperation, is engaged in some drug action on the side from which he hopes to profit. The only drug war that the general is really involved in is the one that one drug cartel has with its rival.<br /><br />Meanwhile, back in the states, a wealthy and respected San Diego business man, played by hunky Steven Bauer, is arrested, as it seems that his businesses are really just a front for the drug trade. His assets frozen, this leaves his beautiful and greedy wife, played by the lovely and talented Catherine Zeta-Jones, picking up the pieces of her husband's empire while he is in jail, awaiting trial. As regent to the kingdom, she cold boodedly negotiates with the drug cartel to restore her and her husband financially. No shrinking violet is she!<br /><br />There are several other subplots that are also of note and move the story along. All of these vignettes interlock with one another in some fashion, serving to bring the story full circle. To find out how they do so, watch this well directed and powerful film. It is certainly well worth watching and a welcome addition to one's personal film collection.is in jail, awaiting trial.

B000EYK4GW|5.0|I, like many, grew up watching \\"Dumbo\\" over and over again. It was one of those movies that you never could enough of and, at a little over an hour in running time -making it Disney's shortest full length feature- time truly flew while you were enjoying it. Today, it's been 65 years since the movie's release and the emotions it stirs remain intact.<br /><br />As for the extras included in the DVD, I found the audio commentary just as useful and enlightening (in terms of information about the people making the movie) as the 14-minute long featurette \\"Celebrating Dumbo\\", which was more like a promotional piece than an in-depth look at the making of the film. There is also a couple of fun pre-Dumbo shorts, \\"Elmer Elephant\\" and \\"Flying Mouse\\". Most of the bonus features are designed for children, including sing-along songs from the movie, a read-along storybook titled \\"Dumbo's Big Discovery\\" and a fun Disneypedia game called \\"My First Circus\\".<br /><br />In all honesty it doesn't seem to offer much more than the 60th Anniversary Edition released five years ago. I can't see enough justification for this release. However, a classic is a classic, so those who didn't get the previous edition, get this one. You will be delighted. Those who own the previous edition, you are safe to skip this one.
B000AADYYO|5.0|Opeth have done it again. They released this masterpiece and it's definatly the best album of 2005! They have created a beautiful mix of melodic death metal and prgressive metal similar to Dream Theater. Mikael Akerfeldt is one of the best vocalist of all time! It's amazing how he switches from a soft singing voice to a death metal growl in the same song. As usual with any Opeth album the songs are very long and over 10 minutes most of them. The production quality is excellent like any Opeth album and the guitars are awesome. The drumming rocks and the bass is audible at all times! Don't forget about the keyboards to!<br /><br />Here's my question: Why won't the Grammys pay attention to this album? All they nominate is that Coldplay, Kanye West, and Green Day crap that is extremely overrated! This is the best album of 2005 and you know it, you're just afraid to admit...
B00005JOVH|4.0|First let me start off by telling people there is a additional scene at the end of this film SO DO NOT LEAVE till after the credits. Now, I have VERY missed emotions about this film. The movie goer side of me loved the movie and was blown away by the special effects and story. The comic fan in me was disgusted by the liberties that the writers of the film took in changing storylines and making people die that NEVER EVER died in the X-men universe.<br /><br />The story was actually quite marvelously told. The story honestly seemed a bit rushed for me. The movie's running time is about 1HR and 45MINS and it could have been a tad longer.<br /><br />In a really small nut shell, the movie takes place not too long after the second movie. Wolverine and Storm are training the newbies, IE Iceman, Rogue, Colossus, and Kitty Pryde. Cyclops is a mess since the death of Jean Gray and Magneto is on his way to stering up trouble again.<br /><br />A cure is found for Mutants. Something that can supress the X gene and make them normal again. Around this time Jean Gray returns from the grave as Dark Phoenix. I have HUGE problems with the whole Phoenix angle in this film and how it was handled. It was handled in a way that was very much inconsistant with the last film. I'm not going to give you all the details of what happens in the comics but needless to say nothing like the movie, but I will say Dark Phoenix is scary as hell. Anyway I digress, Magneto then decides to organize the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants to try to stop mutants from getting the cure, and a two front battle begins, X-men VS. Brotherhood and X-men VS. Dark Phoenix.<br /><br />The new characters in the movie have little more than cameos basically. You get very little back story and no one really cares. The stars of this film are clearly Wolverine, Storm, Beast and Magneto.<br /><br />Now about the liberties that the movie makers took, I have a huge problem with some of the X-men that die. I thought it was rediculous and not necissary at all. One death happens in the very beginning of the film, but you don't get to actually see their death. I think a grand total of about 3 X-men die, WAY TOO MANY. The thing the puzzled me is that some of them NEVER DIED IN THE COMIC, EVER! So why kill them off? It just didn't make any sense to me.<br /><br />Then there are the mutants that get the cure. One of which actually gets the cure because they choose too. To me, this totally betrayed this particular comic character. I could see how it worked from a movie perspective, but from a comic book perspective it was a giant slap in the face of all comic characters. However, it is made very clear by the end of this movie that this cure is more than likely temporary, so no long term effects will be felt from the decision to make some of the characters normal again. Also it is pretty clear by the end of the movie that the story will continue in the Wolverine spin-off, esp. if you stay after the credits!!!!<br /><br />All in all the movie is fantastic, but the X-men legacy is destroyed by this movie. Too many liberties were taken with a story that is as sacred to some people as a classic like \\"Gone with the Wind.\\" You just don't take it as far as the writers did, but do I reccomend this movie?

B000000H6Y|5.0|In 1993 Type O Negative released their 3rd album \\"Bloody Kisses\\" and one major thing changed. The band turned from a thrash metal style band to a gothic/doom metal band. Peter Steele used his vampiyric voice throughout the entire album and barely screams like he did in the past. This is my favorite Type O Negative album ever and one of my favorite albums of all time! The whole album is pure genius! The lyrics are so well written. The music is gothic, sad, ocassionally funny, and creepy. Peter Steele just like Glenn Danzig before him has always had a scary reputation and was feared by critics and the rest of the media. The songs on this album are all very awesome and I'm going to review them(I won't rate the intro and skits, just the actual songs):<br /><br />Machine Screw: The opening intro and what an interesting one it is. Be warned, it's very nasty.<br /><br />Christian Woman: 5/5 The first actual song and basically starts off slow and then goes through so many changes in the almost 9-minute time this song runs in. Very beautiful and pokes fun at Christianity as well! ;)<br /><br />Black No. 1: 5/5 The first very gothic song on the album and the longest song as well at an amazing 11:15! It pokes fun at gothic culture and it's ironic considering the band is goth. However this is an incredible song that has catchy lyrics and amazing quiet moments.<br /><br />Fay Wray Come Out and Play: Yikes! The first of a few skits on the album and it's very disturbing and kind of funny. It's basically a tribal group sacrificing a woman to some monster thing...<br /><br />Kill All the White People: 4/5 A disturbing title and an odd song as well. Peter is yelling in a German accent and you can hear a fight in the background as well. Great guitar work in this and makes fun of racism and Nazism. A little odd though...<br /><br />Summer Breeze: 5/5 An amazing cover of the Seals & Crofts hit! This version is kind of depressing but the vocals kick-ass and this was the first ever Type O Negative song I ever heard actually!<br /><br />Set Me on Fire: 3/5 \\"Summer Breeze\\" builds up to this song. A very Beatles-esque song but incredibly cheesy. Not so good.<br /><br />Dark Side of the Womb: The shortest skit on the album and incredibly unusual. It's basically a baby crying over an industrial beat. Sounds like an abortion of some sorts?<br /><br />We Hate Everyone: 5/5 Despite being kind of light-hearted, this song is awesome! It's poking fun at the people that hate Type O Negative and how they don't give a fu**.<br /><br />Bloody Kisses(A Death in the Family): 5/5 The epic title track and a very depressing one of that fact. Very doomy and beautiful with incredible lyrics about lost love etc.<br /><br />3.0.I.F: The last skit on the album and also my favorite one. Incredibly scary! Listen to it in the dark.<br /><br />Too Late: Frozen: 4/5 A surprisingly up-beat song about lost-love as well(the last few songs are about that same subject). Gets kind of repetitive but the Beatles-esque melodies are very cool.<br /><br />Blood & Fire: 5/5 This is another awesome song with rather sexual lyrics. It's kind of odd but it has very awesome guitar especially the opening riffs!<br /><br />Can't Lose You: 5/5 Emotional closer to this masterpiece!tually! <br />Set Me on Fire: 3/5 \\"Summer Breeze\\" builds up to this song.

0395925037|5.0|During the Nazi Era, this book was the most un-read bestseller in Europe.  Lots of people purchased the volume, but very few took the time to read it. <br /> <br />Therein lies a tragedy; Hitler had outlined his entire diabolical program before it was carried out.  In Mein Kampf, Hitler's evil blueprint was laid out in detail, but nobody knew much about it because they didn't take the time to read it.  <br /> <br />This book is putrid and evil, but revealing.
B00030590I|4.0|Hero is a very unique movie. In this movie, the characters have very little character development. It is as if it almost does not exist. Also, the amount of dialogue is very limited. The director hoped to make use of the limited dialogue to create and touching atmosphere, however, he was unsuccessful. When characters in the movie died, I felt no emotion, because I did not feel connected to them. <br />After watching this movie, I was not sure of who the actual \\"Hero\\" referred to. It could have been protagonist, Nameless Warrior, but at the same time, almost all the characters in the movie were heroes in their own ways. Maybe the director's goal was to allow the audience to walk away from the movie, still wondering who the real Hero was. <br />Before watching this movie, many people informed me that it was a very good movie. But because I am not a big fan of action movies, I was unsure of what the movie would be like. Surprisingly, although this movie is filled with action, the fight scenes are not overwhelming. They are short and sufficient. <br />The director is very talented. He was able to transform an action movie into one that I enjoy. I would definitely recommend this movie to viewers of all ages. <br />
0385504209|4.0|This book was pure entertainment: a fun page-turner.  If there were separate 5-star scales for \\"entertainment\\" versus \\"literature,\\" I would give The Da Vinci Code 5 entertainment stars.  It isn't a 5-star work of literature- but after a long day of work, or while stuck in an airport during a 4-hour layover, this is definitely an easier story for the reader to escape into than something by George Eliot or Herman Melville.<br /><br />It's surprising that some of the other reviews of this book have been so negative.  It isn't fine literature, or even posing as such.  It isn't a work of religious scholarship or history, nor does it pretend to be.  It's just pure entertainment with some fun brain teasers and a much more creative plot than most other action/thriller novels.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|I am sure that all of you have already read the many reviews about this movie. So instead of giving out spoilers, I just want to say how much of a breakthroughs this movie is to the movie industry <br /> <br />Americans have always had a reputation for being simple minded. Part of the reason is their tendency to judge something by its cover rather than what it truly is. So many people focus their attention on action movies that they never stop to appreciate the beauty of the plot. <br /> <br />Brokeback Mountain has set a new standard to the film industry. It shows people that we are no longer brainless robots that believe in propaganda, but intelligent beings who have the mind to appreciate beauty and stories. I would give this movie a 10 star, but there is no such function.
B000001FTD|5.0|as another reviewer said, anthrax IS contagious. this album spawned the classic \\"caught in a mosh\\" which was an enormous hit in its day. my favorite song on this ablum has to be either among the living or i am the law, which are two other phenomenal tracks on this kick ass album. other good songs are efilnikufecin (N.F.L.) indians, and one world. the only song i didnt rate 5 stars on this album was skeletons.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|I remember when I heard of the Oscar annoucement for Crash being the Best Movie of the Year.  <br /> <br />My first impression is: ARE YOU GUYS OUT OF YOUR MIND? <br /> <br />Brokeback Mountain not only presents a conversial idea, but also place in a mixture of emotions, plots and turns, as well as a insight into humanity lacked in most films today. Compared to this movie, Crash is just another action movie about Racism. <br /> <br />The only comforting thing to note about Crash is that, no matter how the Academy rated it, did not do nearly as well in the eyes of movie viewers. It only had a 3 1/2 star on Amazon, with only 50 million in US Box office, nothing internationally. Compared to Crash, Brokeback Mountain produced 83 million in US alone, and 166 Million Internationally. Brokeback Mountain is also heavily rated by viewers with 5 stars, where as Crash has been receiving 1 star and 2 stars lately.
0553062182|4.0|There's a fine line between taking care of yourself and self-obsession. <br /> <br />Even in highly creative families, overly sensitive children are often considered \\"selfish\\" or egocentric. Hypochondriacs. Whiners. It's ironic so many end up with autoimmune diseases: diseases where the body does not recognize it's own tissue and attacks it as an invader. What a picture of self-rejection...never learning healthy regard for self care <br /> <br />Perhaps coming from this background, I had a hard time with the tone of this book...it almost seemed arrogant. <br /> <br />At any rate, there's too much good info to pass up. Buy it. Take what you like and leave the rest.
B0000B1OFL|4.0|I believe this is a very well done movie! The story is simple but with a lot of finess and with several non-expected turns. The line up is impressive of course and you feel like you almost get to know the characters.<br /><br />[...]
B00005JOVJ|2.0|What a let-down this movie was.<br /><br />I've always been a huge fan and avid reader of the X-Men.  What made them exceptional was the incredible character development, intricate plotlines that involved moral dilemmas and inter- and intrapersonal struggles.  It was never boring -- the human aspect to things kept it real and gave it depth.<br /><br />The movie has none of this depth.  It does have some exemplary special effects.  But I have to say -- it's really frustrating when they reduce almost all the newer characters to mere cameos... They just tease you with a little bit of special FX to illustrate their powers, but then fail to do *anything* with the character for the entire movie.  Most of the characters are mere 'bit' parts -- even (strangely enough) Professor Xavier and Magneto.<br /><br />As for what other people have said regarding the acting: I agree full-heartedly that the acting is flat and uninspired.  Neither Patrick Stewart nor Sir Ian McKellen are given the opportunity to showcase their incredible talent. (Nor is Kelsey Grammer.)  Hale Berry is horrible.  Hugh Jackman makes a convincing Wolverine, but you really wish they'd explore his character more.<br /><br />So what to say?  I saw the movie because I love the X-Men; but the movie did not fulfill its potential in the least.
0066620996|5.0|This book has already become a business classic and will remain talked about and influential for years to come. Its greatness lies in the quality and quantity of the data and the analysis, and in the author's own personality, brilliance and drive.    Collins starts with the question, \\"Can a good company become a great company, and, if so, how?\\" To answer this question, he assembled a team of 20 researchers and launched a six-month \\"death march of financial analysis,\\" looking for fortune 500 companies that exhibited a particular pattern: fifteen-year cumulative stock returns at or below the general stock market, punctuated by a transition point, then cumulative returns at least three times the market over the next fifteen years.    The team identified 11 companies that averaged greater than 6.9 times the average market return after their transition points, and 17 comparison companies. They performed over 10 person-years of research, collecting all articles published on the 28 companies dating back 50 years or more, and interviewing most of the good-to-great executives who had key positions of responsibility during the transition era.    Collins says of the effort: \\"For each of the 28 companies...I would make a presentation to the team on that specific company, drawing potential conclusions and asking questions. Then we would debate, disagree, pound on tables, raise our voices, pause and reflect, debate some more, pause and then discuss, resolve, question, and debate yet again about 'what it all means.'\\"     This collaboration is the key to the success of the book. Collins clearly enjoyed the process and the team tested each other's conclusions and collectively came up with a view that could stand intense scrutiny. The book needed a leader and an intellect like Collins, but without the team it would have been a shadow of what it became. In other words, the making of the book was a reflection of its subject, by taking a concept that had potential to be great and developing it incrementally until it was transformed inexorably from a good idea into a great book. Cumulative returns on this book are surely many times the average.    The particular power of the process is that it unearthed some results that defy conventional wisdom as well as Collins' own preconceptions. For example, Collins was surprised by what he didn't find in good-to-great companies:    - No charismatic, celebrity leaders   - No link to executive compensation   - No correlation with strategic planning efforts   - No focus on actions -- success was more dependent on deciding what not to do   - No innovative technology   - No mergers and acquisitions   - No change efforts or initiatives   - No fortunate positioning    Instead Collins and his team found that the 11 companies had 7 key concepts in common:    1) Level 5 Leadership -- \\"We were surprised, shocked really, to discover the type of leadership required for turning a good company into a great one...these leaders are a paradoxical blend of humility and professional will. They are more like Lincoln and Socrates than Patton or Ceasar.\\"    2) First Who...Then What -- \\"We found that they first got the right people on the bus, the wrong people off the bus, and the right people in the right seats -- then they figured out where to drive it.\\"    3) Confront the Brutal Facts (Yet never lose faith) -- \\"Every good-to-great company embraced what we came to call the Stockdale Paradox. You must maintain unwavering faith that you can and will prevail in the end, regardless of the difficulties, AND at the same time have the discipline to confront the most brutal facts of your current reality.\\"    4) The Hedgehog Concept (Simplicity within the three circles) -- \\"If you cannot be the best in the world at your core business, then your core business absolutely cannot form the basis of a great company. It must be replaced with a simple concept that reflects deep understanding of three intersecting circles [What you can be the bestin the world at, what you are deeply passionate about, and what makes enough money]\\"    5) A Culture of Discipline -- \\"When you combine a culture of discipline with an ethic of entrepreneurship, you get the magical alchemy of great performance.\\"    6) Technology Accelerators -- \\"Good-to-great companies...never use technology as the primary means of igniting a transformation. Yet, paradoxically, they are pioneers in the application of carefully selected technologies.\\"    7) The Flywheel and the Doom Loop -- \\"There was no defining action, no grand program, no one killer innovation, no solitary lucky break, no miracle moment. Rather the process resembled relentlessly pushing a giant heavy flywheel in one direction, turn upon turn, building momentum until a point of breakthrough, and beyond.\\"    All the data and all the research are summed up in these seven concepts. The central idea, however, is even simpler. The key to the book is that in order to go from good to great, you need to have a selfless leader who builds a great team that goes on relentlessly to pursue a simple goal over a long period of time. The central goal, or Hedgehog Concept, has to have certain characteristics: the goal must be economically viable, and the team needs to  care about it deeply and have the capability of being best in the world at it. This concept may not be easy to find, or may not exist at all for any given company, but once discovered it is always remarkably simple.    The book is successful because this simple idea emerges clearly from the data. The book starts with what seems like a relatively uninteresting financial analysis of large successful companies, but ends up with a set of principles that seem obviously correct. Moreover, the findings are interesting because they are surprising and they touch on the motivation and drive that make people achieve extraordinary things in many fields.     As Collins puts it, \\"This book...is ultimately about one thing: the timeless principlesof good to great...I see my work as being about discovering what creates enduring great organizations of any type.\\" But it is more than this; it is ultimately about the unquenchable thirst of the human spirit for great accomplishment and mastery.    This helps explain why the book has meaning for everyone -- not just the few leaders of Fortune 500 companies. The concepts apply to all human endeavors, and so have resonance and applicability for everybody.     In all respects, this is an excellent book. It's exceedingly well-written and easy to read (or to listen to on tape), the content is solid and useful, and the conclusions are presented in a very clear and memorable way. The messages of the book will stay with you long after you finish reading it.    Graham Lawes
B000ETQRCM|5.0|Pearl Jam isn't \\"new to the scene\\" you idiot, they were making music under different names before Nirvana formed. NO ONE thinks of writing off Pearl Jam as a nirvana copycat...

B00005JOVH|3.0|X-men: The Last Stand will have reviewers and viewers divided.  Some, who know only a little or nothing at all of the X-men mythos, will enjoy it.  Some, who have read or seen all of the comics, will hate it.  And some will be like me, stuck in the middle.      As a movie, X-men 3 is a pretty good way to end the *movie* series.  It ties up a lot of plot-lines, has some good twists, great Fx and a pretty decent story about love and mutants.  Its exciting to watch, visually stunning in parts and actually and surprisingly keeps the style and tone of the first two admirably well.    On the other hand, as a story set in a mythos that is dozens upon dozens of years in the making, X-Men 3 falls flat on its face.  I  loved the first two, even though the mythos was messed around a bit, because it was a movie and you have to make some concessions.  Bryan Singer did an admirable job trying to tie together years upon years of story and create something that is true to the source and entertaining to those who have no idea who Wolverine is, as an example.  Unfortunately, X3 throws the mythos out of the window and simply does things it shouldn't do.  I can't talk about most of these things because I don't believe in spoilers.      I will say, Rogue was totally under-used and spent most of the movie standing in line.  Storm was finally used in a decent way.  The major deaths in the film were insipid (as was the after-the-credits \\"revelation\\" that really ruined anything the movie had going for it).  Bret Rattner apparently has seen the Juggernaut video and there is a scene that is a nice and hillarious homage to that video.  But unfortunately, practically everything the first two films stood for was thrown out of the window.     So, I'm torn.  On one hand, the movie was pretty decent as a *movie*.  Unfortunately, a portion of my soul died when I saw it last night and shook my head at the way Ratner handled the story.  If you know nothing about the X-men mythos, enjoy.  If you have read every single comic book, be prepared for a let down.  If you're like me, go in with an open mind, knowing that it won't be exactly as it should and maybe you won't be disappointed.  Maybe.
B000FQJAIW|1.0|I was ecstatic when I first read the announcement that the Original Unaltered Star Wars Trilogy would be released on DVD in September. It didn't seem possible since George Lucas had previously stated on several different occasions that the Special Editions/Editions of the moment are his preferred versions and that in fact, the originals no longer exist. Hope was all but lost that the non-SE versions would ever see the light of DVD. But then the announcement came and all was right with the world. Finally LucasFilm was releasing official DVDs of the films that started it all in, I presumed, the best quality possible because, hey, this is LucasFilm. They stand for top notch quality and presentation. All of their previous DVDs have featured incredible picture and sound, so this announcement was a wonderful surprise. Even though the original theatrical versions were to be released on the second disc of a two-disc package with the main feature being the 2004 Special Edition which I already have since I bought the previously released 4 Disc Trilogy box set, and even though the Original Unaltered film would be relegated to the second disc of said 2 Disc package as \\"bonus material,\\" I wasn't too concerned given LucasFilm's track record of fabulous treatment of bonus material. Every other previous Star Wars DVD had some wonderful supplements - all enhanced for widescreen displays which is very forward thinking to a time when widescreen HDTVs will be in households all over the country. Just another reason to have confidence in LucasFilm.<br /><br />Then a few days later, Bill Hunt at thedigitalbits.com broke the news that the transfers for the Original Theatrical Versions were going to be ported over from the most recent (circa. 1992/93) widescreen laserdisc transfer and not be enhanced for widescreen displays. LucasFilm has confirmed this in an email sent by Lynne Hale and in published interviews with LucasFilm employees. This news is unfortunate on many levels. For one thing, given the state of the Home Theater art LucasFilm is essentially releasing a sub-par product. These days widescreen films are always enhanced for widescreen displays - more detail is shown because of the extra lines of resolution. There isn't a studio that does not carry out this practice, no matter how low a film's box office take it will be treated to a brand new widescreen transfer that will be enhanced for my widescreen display. But LucasFilm has opted to ignore the industry standard and give us a transfer that is vastly inferior to the mainstream. These films will suffer from loss of detail and the widescreen image will be framed by a large rectangle on my widescreen display. Not a pretty picture!<br /><br />I'm sad to say that I won't be purchasing this DVD because the only reason for me to have done so is for the Original Unaltered Version of Star Wars - I already own the 2004 version. LucasFilm has lost a sale due to their missed opportunity.the state of the Home Theater art LucasFilm is essentially releasing a sub-par product.

B000EJ9MTW|5.0|In the age of nu-age crap rock (nickleback, green day, blink) it's awesome to see a new band that displays the classic roots of all that is rock n roll.  Sometimes this band sounds like they came out in the 70's, hell the singer's vocals resemble Robert Plant of Led Zeppelin fame.  Awesome band that doesen't bend to the sellout crap rock sound that plagues the radio stations with manufactured rap stuff, this is ROCK.
B000002GK1|4.0|Though it would be their next album, the uber-classic \\"Superunknown\\" that would take them to stardom, Soundgarden's third album \\"Badmotorfinger\\", is absolutely no slouch; in fact it's probably the heaviest mainstream hard rock album of 1991, when their contempraries Nirvana nd Pearl Jam would break on through to the other side, as Jim Morrison used to say. The punk element is brought down and the metal element and accentuated melody is brought to the forefront, especially on songs like \\"Outshined\\"(nice heavy bass riff by Ben Sheperd)\\"Rusty Cage\\"(a Ramones-ish catchy number) and \\"Jesus Christ Pose\\"(whose video would be banned form MTV).This is also the last album where Chris Cornell(who after Marvin Gaye, is the greatest male singer in any genre)screams at the top of his lungs;on \\"Superunknown\\" his voice and emotions are more controlled and concentrated.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|Just had to cast my vote. This album is absolutely amazing. Now, Pearl Jam is already my favorite band, and I can't claim to have a favorite album (although I must say that anyone who thinks Riot Act wasn't a great album is hearing-impaired), but this album is breathtaking from the first 30 seconds. It's not an album you have to listen to start appreciating. I bought it the day it came out, loaded it into my mp3 player, and haven't taken my headphones off yet. I'm listening to it right now. Seriously. If you haven't bought this album yet, you're living a lower quality of life than you could be. Buy it right now. In fact, you shouldn't even still be reading this; you should be clicking the \\"buy now\\" button. A++++
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Before I provide my full insight on this album, I must state that I'm only a fan of RHCP's music with John F.  In my opinion, RHCP's music prior to his addition is not even comparable.  Nonetheless, I believe that this album, although very reminiscent of their last few albums (especially of Blood, Sugar and on), has a wealth of creativity worth listening to, especially if you consider yourself a true RHCP fan.  Occasional listeners cannot truly appreciate the artform that has become the staple of RHCP's music.  Particularly, John F's enchanting guitar solos are extraordinary and should be recognized as such.  Complimented extremely well by Flea's unpredictable yet rhythmic bass, the album's string instruments shine most of all.<br /><br />This should not detract from Anthony and Chad's skillful contribution to this album.  Anthony's metaphorical vocals add the mysterious element that has signified RHCP's orginality among conventional rock bands since the group's inception.<br /><br />Finally, Chad Smith's percussion is as integral a part of the compostion to this album as the other elements.  Smith never misses a beat and provides the steady lows that he has been known for in the past decade.<br /><br />In synopsis, my favorite tracks are as follows (in no particular order):<br /><br />1. Dani California<br /><br />2. Snow (Hey Oh)<br /><br />3. Charlie<br /><br />4. Stadium Arcadium<br /><br />7. Slow Cheetah<br /><br />8. Torture Me<br /><br />11. Warlocks<br /><br />13. Wet Sand<br /><br />14. Hey<br /><br />1. Desecration Smile<br /><br />3. Hard to Concentrate<br /><br />4. 21st Century<br /><br />6. Readymade<br /><br />9. Animal Bar<br /><br />10. So Much I<br /><br />11. Storm In A Teacup<br /><br />12. We Believe<br /><br />13. Turn It Again<br /><br />This album is WELL worth the purchase.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Ok, now I have been listening to the Chili Peppers since I was about 7 years old, when i first heard my brothers copy of Mothers Milk...I was hooked.<br /><br />Now im at the ripe age of 22 years old and still to this day listen to these boys religiously. And I have to say, Stadium Arcadium not only gives Blood Sugar a run for its money, I think in a lot of ways it may just surpass it for some of the best work put forth from them. Now I love BTW and Californication and every album and till I picked up this album, I always found myself returning to BSSM. Its just that the albums in between were just lacking something, something that I cant quite put my finger on. But I knew as soon as I heard Dani California, that were on another level musically that they havent been on in a long time.<br /><br />Now each album offers something to every listener. I myself am more partial to the Mars disc. But that doesnt mean Jupiter isnt as good, because it is. I find Jupiter to be a very slow, relaxed cd. Some of the key tracks, to me are: Shes only 18, Torture Me, Especially in Michigan and I fell in love with the song Wet Sand. But in all actuallity, there isnt one song that I dont like.<br /><br />Now Mars, is what gets me going. With songs like Storm in a Teacup, Turn it Again and Readymade, how can you not just jump and and boogie around the room? You cant, and if you say you can, youre a liar. But I think Mars holds the gem of the entire Album. Desecration Smile. They've never put out such a smoldering song ever in their career.<br /><br />Im absolutely in love with Stadium Arcadium like I said, I think it just may be their best effort to date. Its got a little something from every Peppers era, you really just cant go wrong.<br /><br />and Anthony even references Jungle Brothers...cmon now? Thats just awesome.
B000EMGAGW|4.0|This album is one of those albums you really need to listen to thouroughlt before you form and opinion on it because im a huge mobb deep fan and on the first day on the shelves i bought this cd, but once i had put it in the cd player i was thoroughly dissapointed at first. Even though i didnt really like it immediately there was something about it that compelled me to keep listening to it and by the third time i had listened to it it really grew on me. One thing that will put people of buying this album is how often mobb deep talk about how rich they are now or the riches they are soon to see which is kind of sad cause its not what mobb deep has ever been about since they signed to G-unit, except possibly a little bit on Amerikaz Nightmare. I9 think mobb deep being signed to G-unit is a really good thing but im a little dissaponted at the substance in theyre lyrics. But one thing that is pleasing is that for the most part Mobb Deep has managed to keep that same grimmey feel for most of the tracks. 50 cent probably has done one or two too many guest appearances on this album and i dont really like many of the songs that he featured on. The production is A little inconsistent. Havoc makes a few tight beats but he really isnt what he used to be as far as producing goes, The alchemist laced one of the best tracks on the album and it kind of leaves you wishing that he was producer for more then one track on the album. I do miss the traditional style of mobb deep which i fell in love with when i heard \\"The Infamous\\" and \\"Hell On Earth\\" but artists need to adapt and chage styles slightly. Over the last few years they have done so unsucsessfully with the releases of \\"infamy\\" and \\"amerikaz Nightmare\\" both of which i atill can enjoy but they had crossed over slightly to a more mainstream feel with those two albums which lead to less sales from hip hop fans but still hadnt created enough buzz for mainstream fans to take note in it or be interested. The release of \\"blood Money\\"has brought them to the limelight and they have still managed to make it a tight album which is what they have been so desperately needing for some time now. I hope they stay on G-unit and release another album with in the next two years once the excitement of being \\"filthy f**king rich\\" has worn off, to see wether they can bring theyre music back to more of a street feel but managed to be popular. <br />The stand out tracks for me on this album are <br />-Put em in their place(A tight grimmey beat) <br /> <br />-backstage pass(Just a good song) <br /> <br />-give it to me(not liked at first but very catchy W.yOUNG bUCK) <br /> <br />-click click(good song with a sick beat W.Tony Yayo) <br /> <br />-day dreamin'(best song on here,who dont luv a rags2riches tale) <br /> <br />-the infamous(sick beat, alchemist on production W.50cent) <br /> <br />-Have a Party (bonus track, awsum song originally from get rich or die tryin sound strack, fredwreck on the beat did a gr8 job) <br /> <br />-Outta control remix (bonus track, crazy song originally taken from the massacre special edition, Dr Dre on the beat enough said)
B000FQJAIW|1.0|...and for those without widescreen televisions. <br /> <br />Be aware that the \\"original\\" trilogy being offered here as \\"bonus material\\" is presented in non-anamorphic letterboxed widescreen. This means you will not be able to make full use of your widescreen display, if you have one. The image will simply appear in the middle of the screen, matted on _all four_ sides. Anamorphic widescreen is the DVD standard, and this release should be no exception. In fact, this release should set the bar, not fall short of it. <br /> <br />Yes, it has been confirmed that the 1993 laserdisc masters are being used for this release. These are the versions of the films that appear on the 1993 Definitive Collection laserdisc set and the 1995 \\"Faces\\" laserdisc and VHS sets. These are 13 year old transfers, inherently inferior by today's standards. These films deserve better treatment, and so do you. <br /> <br />Then forcing the consumer to purchase the revised trilogy (again for many people) in order to get the original only adds insult to injury. <br /> <br />The egregious details are all out there and have been confirmed by Lucasfilm. All you can do is voice your opinion and hope that these films will someday see the respect they deserve.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|Okay, before I say anything, I must confessed that the reason I bought this film is because of the contraversy on it, and also the fact that it stayed on the Amazon Top Seller List ever since the DVD Came out. <br /> <br />Having said that, WOW! This film is incredible! I am a big Jake Gyllenhaal fan, and, in my opinion, his performance in this film out-classed all his other movies! I can't stop watching this movie, and though it brings tears into my eyes every time I watch, I still want to watch it! <br /> <br />Definitely recommended! If you haven't seen this movie, BUY IT RIGHT NOW!
0385336691|5.0|Enigmatic drifter Jack Reacher is minding his own business in Manhattan, sipping an espresso in a coffee-bar patio, when a man crosses the street in front of him and drives off in a Mercedes. The Benz contained one million dollars worth of ransom money. With that simple act, Reacher is dragged into the life of Edward Lane, the man who paid the money. Lane, who runs a highly profitable mercenary operation for any government that can afford his fee, is willing to pay any price to get his family back. <br /> <br />And an ex-military investigator like Reacher seems to be just the man Lane needs. Soon Reacher is tracking a sadistic kidnapper through the gritty streets of the Big Apple. And, along the way, Reacher begins to discover that Lane has some secrets of his own. But now that he's in the middle of the kidnapping, Reacher has to see it to the finish. And that finish will be anything but peacable. <br /> <br />By my count, Child is ten for ten. Read all of the Reacher stories -- in any order -- for a sure-fire adrenaline rush. Child's thrillers are so good you'll find yourself agitated when you hit the last page. It's just a shame he isn't cranking them out faster or, at the very least, getting some of them on screen.
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|In my opinion, this album is better than the first.  Don't get me wrong, I listened to the first a whole lot..but I've definitely listened to this one more.  People whine and complain about Jared Leto and this band..\\"stick to acting\\" blah blah blah.  There will always be people who don't like things, but that is okay..everyone has their own opinion, right?  Just try to be open minded when you sample music, if you aren't..then you'll be dissappointed more often than not.  I like some good bands, like Tool for instance.  They're one of the best bands out there in my opinion, but I don't go listening to stuff expecting it to be like Tool..that is where I believe a lot of the bad reviews come from - close-minded people.  Like the top review calls it \\"Space Metal\\"...this is definitely \\"space rock\\" at its finest, I have yet to hear anything like it.
B000BKVQTS|3.0|So-so fantasy movie. Neither the story, nor the acting, nor the visual effects are high caliber. Heath Ledger's performance is definitely forced, Matt Damon is a bit better. At least Lena Headey is gorgeous and acts better than both her male co-stars.
B00006AFUR|5.0|Coming from an avid fan and ECHELON member, this an extremely amazing CD, to say the least.  I listen to a variety of music, some of my favorite bands include Tool, Dredg, Opeth, and of course Thirty Seconds to Mars.  This band is opening what I believe to be a new frontier in music..my friends and I like to call it \\"space rock\\"...its definitely worth a listen.
B000FS9FCG|5.0|V for Vendetta was a truly fantastic film, see this as soon as you can. It is very interesting as it is told from the point of view of a terroist. Based in the near-future (it is never actually revealed, but we can guess around 2030) England has become the new 'USA' after America fallen into civil war. England is now ruled by a heartless dictator. A teroist only known as 'V' emerges by blowing up a building. There is a lot more plot that I don't want to give away, all I can say is that this film was amazing and you should see it imediatly.
B00005JP4W|5.0|When I was a child, people clapped at the end of movies -- we knew that the filmmakers wouldn't actually hear us, but we showed our appreciation nonetheless.  Over the years, it seems that tradition has died out.  I don't think I've heard anyone clap at the end of a movie for twenty-odd years.  Until, that is, this afternoon. <br /> <br />The entire audience clapped at the end of \\"An Inconvenient Truth\\". <br /> <br />It is all too rare to see people act out of idealism and ethics.  Those qualities shine throughout this film -- Al Gore has noticed a problem -- a BIG problem -- and he has learned about it, and is trying to solve it. The \\"news\\" media gives us little 15-second soundbites instead of news and arguments, believing that we, the American public, are too stupid to comprehend any non-trivial ideas.  Gore, on the other hand, clearly has faith in us to UNDERSTAND, to do the right thing, and, above all, to CARE.   <br /> <br />See it. <br />
B0002ZDVEU|4.0|THE BOURNE SUPREMACY is a super DVD transfer action flick that is meant to hold you in suspense for the duration of the movie so that the viewer can forget the heat of the news outside And it works! Director Paul Greengrass has dialed all of the cameras' and actors' meters to breakneck speed, and while the big screen does at times seem overwhelmed by all the blitzkrieg action, the characters appear so involved that the film is all of a piece. Reprising their roles are Matt Damon (who handles this genre very well), Julia Stiles, a glimpse at Franka Potente, and very fine acting by Joan Allen and Brian Cox. This is a high suspense frolic and well worth jumping on for the escapist ride. The locales are beautiful - Goa,India, Berlin, Moscow, a New York City. And if you can take time to notice, the musical score by John Powell has some truly beautifully written moments. A terrific escape from the media doldrums!
B00005JOVH|3.0|I love the first two X-Men films, and I was ready to like this one as well, but sadly my expectations might have been a bit too high. I saw this movie yesterday evening, but it feels like I watched it a couple of years ago. X-Men: The Last Stand is oddly forgettable for a movie that kills off three major X-Men characters. Anyway, here's what I liked and didn't like about the third installment:<br /><br />The Good<br /><br />***I liked the scenes where Phoenix uses her powers.<br />***I liked the fact that Storm got to use her powers more.<br />***I think Ian McKellen did a good job as Magneto--I especially liked the scene on the highway where he saves Mystique.<br />***Some of the special effects were good (like where Phoenix uses her powers)<br />***I liked the concept of a mutant \\"cure\\" and what that implies about our own society's values.<br />***I liked the fact that there were more mutants who used their powers--too bad they didn't have a very good reason for using them.<br />***I liked Beast!<br />***The last scene in the movie with Magneto playing chess gave me hope.<br /><br />The Bad<br /><br />***What's up with Storm's hair? It looks horrible. Storm is supposed to have long flowing white hair which looks cool when she uses her powers!<br />***I didn't like the fact that the killing of one of the major characters was done off screen.<br />***Rogue didn't use her powers at all in this movie.<br />***The script sucks. Not enough story, not enough emotion, not enough DIALOGUE.<br />***While the directing was excellent in some (meaning very few) scenes, it was mediocre for the most part.<br />***The final battle needed to be longer and the final X-Men that dies also deserved a better exit.<br /><br />Overall, if you're one of those people who just has to see it, go see it! You might like it. The three other people I watched it with all agreed that this was the worst of the three movies, but from reading countless reviews here and elsewhere, some people actually liked it better than the first two movies. I guess it depends on what you want. I personally wanted more.<br /><br />While I own the other two movies, I'm not sure if this one is worth having.<br /><br />If the characters that died in this movie are meant to stay dead, then I don't see a need for another X-Men movie. If you check Hugh Jackman's profile on IMDB, one of the movies listed is Wolverine. I really don't see the need for a Wolverine movie since the first two movies were basically all about him. I also saw a Magneto movie listed under Ian McKellen's profile. While I think Ian is a great actor, do we really need a Magneto-only movie?<br /><br />In conclusion, I was disappointed in this film. It really could have been much better than it was.<br /><br />UPDATE<br />---------<br /><br />I just found out that there's an important scene AFTER the credits. So, if you plan on watching it, stay after the credits.<br /><br />Well, I read on the internet what that scene was about, and am now pretty sure that there might be an X-Men 4 in the works.<br /><br />All I have to say is...WHATEVER! These people make a mediocre movie and expect people to stay AFTER the credits (of people who you probably hate by now if you didn't like the movie) to see a major scene you didn't even know was coming.<br /><br />So I get to pay $9 to see a movie that wasn't that good, and on top of that nobody even tells me that there's an important scene after the freaking credits?<br /><br />Can I get a refund, anyone?<br /><br />-Ateronally wanted more.

B000F0UV0E|5.0|A great album by consumate pros. The song selection is wide ranging; some blues hooks, rock and roll, bluegrassy picking, balads. Love the harmonies with Emmy down low and Mark singing on top. Now if Emmy would just do and album with Peter Rowan...
B000E1ZBH2|5.0|I find that I was quite mistaken in my first impression of the new (now out on DVD) P & P movie with Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen. When I saw it in the theatre I was distressed by what I then considered the squalidness of the Bennet household. After viewing the Keira Knightley/Matthew Macfadyen DVD version a number of times, my opinion now is quite the opposite from my first impression. My delight in this movie comes from the complex and complete portrayal of the Bennet family; and after all, that entire family is the protagonist in the Austen novel. Austen created a love story about Lizzie and Darcy, but she also beautifully creates for us the texture of real 19th century country life as lived by the Bennet family. While I have loved the A & E version for many years, I must admit that I have always been a little perplexed by it because I do not think that the A & E version portrays so great a difference between the Bennet and Darcy circumstances as to cause the least amount of doubt in Darcy's mind about whether he should marry Lizzie. This new version puts it out there, unmistakably. It definitively and masterfully portrays the differences between town and country life, so skillfully written about by Jane Austen. Bravo!
B00005JOFQ|5.0|If every literature professors were to gather tomorrow, and select classic films for each genre of viewers, then there will be only two films in the Romance Genre. Romeo and Juliet, and Brokeback Mountain. <br /> <br />The story allows people a peak into the hidden, but ugly side of society that still exist today. Yet even through the tragedy, it portrayed love to its finest. <br /> <br />Definitely a film worth watching.
0618477942|5.0|I've never read any of Bechdel's DTWOF series, although it was her status as a lesbian author that landed her on my Amazon Book Recommendations list.  I admit I was drawn in (no pun intended) solely by the Six Feet Under-ish premise of the book, but I remain astonished by its depth of feeling and literary style.  Chockfull of allusions to classical mythology, landscape architecture, and modern psychology, Bechdel's drawings belie the seriousness of her narrative.  It is a triumph of solipsistic ennui.  And if you don't know what that means, you might want to pick up another book.
1592402038|2.0|As the little girl once said in her first book review: \\"This book told me a lot more than I wanted to know about asparagus.\\"  Or perhaps it was a little boy?  Hell, it could have been the teacher.  I don't know.  All I know is that like the first spotlight reviewer I found Ms. Truss's attempts at humor (humour) shrill, contrived, and bloody irritating.  At the same time I learned a couple of things about commas I didn't know before, had a few other things verified, and enjoyed a few of her examples meant to show how important punctuation is to communication.  So there.  I look forward to her next \\"hilarious\\" book on those little circles  teenage girls use to dot their i's.  (Wouldn't you know...I haven't a clue how to use my comma in i's.  Calling Miss Truss!)
B00030590I|4.0|Yes there were some aspects that seemed exaggerated, but the gorgeous visuals made up for that. I liked the focus on abstract areas during suspenseful scenes. Low: Action. High: Visuals. Note: I bought the import version, which has all the Chinese on it and the 5 mug shots of the characters on the cover. If anyone has the import version and you've seen the special features on it, please contact me! I do not know how to access them as I didn't see the words on the menu. Thanks.
B000646MNE|5.0|I didn't watch this one when it was showing on HBO.  My hesitation in buying this one was that I have never been a fan of anything that is overly explicit and I'm not a fan of Sarah Jessica Parker.  I have always thought that Kim Cattrail was absolultely beautiful, but to be honest, I could have done without seeing her naked. <br /> <br />The Tributes on the dvd seem to indicate that this was an \\"original\\" series.  The only really original thing about it was the explicit nature.  I would classify it as a very adult version of FRIENDS. I found it very hard to buy that the characters were 30. With the exception of Charlotte, they looked 40. <br /> <br />It took me until the third season to warm to the series. <br />Carrie couldn't make up her mind whether to dress in very interesting and classy clothes or to wear things that didn't match at all.  Some of her clothes were just plain tacky! <br />She wore too many colors together that didn't match and the see through clothes with colored bras and male briefs were, to use their words, \\"ICK.\\" Someone also needs to clue Sarah Jessica into the fact that she looks much better with the straight, shorter hair and not all of those \\"skunk\\" colors in it. <br /> <br />The only thing that kept this from being porn was the story line. The characters did mesh together well.  They were real inspite of the explicit sex and funky clothes.  I find it hard to believe that ANYONE is that permissive about sex.  I also don't know of anyone who talks that explictly about their sex lives with other people. <br /> <br />On a positive note, I could identify with feeling that you have the right guy, then discovering something about him or the relationship that couldn't be acceptable. Dating becomes harder as you grow older in that we are more discerning about who we date.  We have learned more about who we are and what we want and what we can or can not tolerate.  I could also identify with the feeling that they would NEVER find the right man, much less their soulmate... I myself am still waiting. <br /> <br />Despite my outdated old world values and morals, and my adversion to things that are too explicit, ( I am of the opinion that implied is much sexier than explicit.) this series is worth a watch. If you are of a more modern outlook than I am, chances are that you will really love this series.
B00005JOVO|3.0|I really liked the original Poseidon Adventure.  It had great actors, and a really incredible story line.  Well, I had high hopes for this movie, but I knew somehow it wasn't going to beat the original story becuase of all of the reviews that I had read.  <br /> <br />I was right.  This movie could have been so good, but unfortunately it seemed really rushed, and half of the script seemed missing.  For example, at the beginning of the movie we all know that a huge title wave is coming, and we were thinking that one of the crew members was going to inform the captain that something odd was showing up on the monitors.  But, no this didn't happen.  Instead we hear the captain saying \\"I feel something odd.\\"  And then half a minute later, people are yelling \\"There's a huge wave over there.\\"  I guess it came out of absolutely no where.  How unrealistic.  <br /> <br />Also, after the ship turns over, there is no true sence of panic, and no true sence of fear.  You don't hear anyone screaming hysterically! <br /> <br />And some of the scenes in this movie are just absurd, and you would never hear them in a real life situation.  Becuase in real life most people will heroically try to help others in danger, and will even risk their own lives to help others.  I think that 9/11 is a really good example of what I mean. <br /> <br />But in this movie, we have one really crazy scene. In this scene, the survivors are trying to get across an elevator shaft and Richard Dreyfuss is almost there except that he ends up having a crew member hanging onto his leg for dear life - becuase if he lets go, he will plummet to his death by falling down the elevator shaft.   <br /> <br />All of a sudden we start hearing \\"Kick Him Off! Kick Him Off!\\"  yells Josh Lucas.  When I heard this line, I couldn't stop laughing.  My husband couldn't stop laughing either. At this point I knew that this movie was going to be a bit ridiculous, and for sure unrealistic. <br /> <br />I still recommend the movie though becuase of the special effects, and it is still a Disaster Movie.  I just wished that they could have made a truly unforgetable movie.  Oh well.

B00023BLXK|4.0|Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights is a movie that uses music and dancing as a language to connect two young teenagers in the midst of a hectic time of adolescence. When young Katie moves with her family to Havana, Cuba, she is at first, very hesitant about the country. Katie is initially quite distant and refuses to take advantage of the country and its beautiful culture until she meets an amazing young man named Javier. <br /> <br />Javier is a young Cuban waiter who initially helps her find her way around. Javier becomes friends with her and later sees how she is intrigued by the style of dancing in Cuba. He then decides to help her learn the moves and the two's chemistry continues to build as their moves improve and are synchronized to the music. Javier is later fired from his job and desperately needs money to support his family. Luckily, a new Latin dance contest is going to be held with a decent amount of money offered as a prize. Katey decides to enter the contest with Javier in hope of winning the money and to help out her new love and his family. The movie takes a new twist when history is written when Castro's revolution interferes with the two love birds' plans and desires. <br /> <br />This movie is ultimately a great dance movie and is great for any person who loved the first Dirty Dancing or the art of dancing in general. The movie has a very sexy and sultry feel and although the ending seems abrupt, you'll want to watch it more than once! The actor, Diego Lunes, who plays Javier, has a smooth character whose moves are flawless and whose personality and humor keep all eyes on him. Katey, played by Romolo Garaj, is the typical teenage character that goes through some changes yet meeting Javier makes her reach self actualization and realize her passion for dancing. <br />
1400079179|4.0|\\"The Da Vinci\\" code has been much critisized for its lacking accuracy of supposed historical facts. Regardless of how many of the book's claims are true, Brown makes one important point: There's always two sides to a story and the history books are written by the winners. Keep in mind: Don't assume everything someone says is true, be it the Catholic Church or Dan Brown. Check both sides, do some research. Don't automatically assume this book to be true, but it might inspire you to question some supposed facts of Christian history.<br /><br />This is not the first time a fictional work claims to be based on fact and whether Dan Brown truly believes in the Priory of Sion - which has been revealed to be a hoax - is not really important. As long as you read this book as a thriller, it is definately an entertaining page turner, well worth reading.
B00005JOVH|4.0|At long last, we have the third, and possibly final, installment of Fox's X-Men movie franchise, and it's been no easy road getting here.  There were a lot of behind-the-scenes troubles that plagued the film which led to many online fansites predicting the worst.  After seeing it, I can say that despite the backstage drama, this ended up being a pretty good movie.  It's no classic, but it's good for what it is.  And while it's not the best superhero film ever (that honor either goes to Batman Begins or Spider-Man 2), or even the best of the series (X2: X-Men United), it's nowhere near bad.  After Jean Grey's (Famke Janssen) death at the end of the last film, the atomosphere at the X-Mansion hasn't been the same.  Everyone misses her, but no one as much as Scott Summers/Cyclops (James Mardsen), her husband, who can barely pull himself together.  Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) has even resorted to having Logan/Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) substitute teach for him.  Meanwhile, Magneto (Ian McKellan) is still at large along with Pyro (Aaron Stanford), his new lieutenant and Mystique (Rebecca Romijn), who has recently been incarcerated.  The new president (Josef Sommer) is much more tolerant of mutants, going so far as to appoint Hank McCoy/Beast (Kelsey Grammer) as Secretary of Mutant Affairs, but he can't ignore the threat Magneto poses, and when a drug company develops a \\"cure\\" for mutation, he sees it as an answer to Magneto's terrorism.  Unfortunately, shortly after the X-Men learn of the cure, which completely catches them off-guard, Prof. X receives a psychic disturbance from Alkali Lake, the place where Jean died saving the rest of the team.  As it would appear, Jean was able to save herself, but in doing so, she unleashed a part of her subconscious mind that Xavier worked very hard to suppress.  Jean is a Level 5 mutant, meaning that she is off-the-charts powerful, and Xavier recognized that if he didn't find a way to keep some of her more \\"animal\\" emotions in check, she could very likely destroy everyone on Earth.  When Xavier and the X-Men try to bring Jean back to the mansion with them, Magneto shows up with some of his new recruits, including Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones), who is an unstoppable brute and Callisto (Dania Ramirez), a speedy girl who can also sense other mutants.  After a huge struggle against the nearly omnipotent Jean, now known as the Phoenix, Magneto's Brotherhood acquires Phoenix in order to use her against the humans in their campaign to \\"exterminate\\" mutantkind.  Now, the X-Men have to deal with the Phoenix, the Brotherhood, and the lure of the cure.  While many mutants are appalled at the idea that they are a \\"disease\\", there are some who want to give up their gifts, either because they see them as a curse, or to end their persecution at the hands of humans.  Rogue (Anna Paquin), for one, wants nothing more than to lose her powers.  She can't ever touch another human without harming them; her touch sucks the lifeforce out of others.  If the other person is a mutant, she temporarily acquires their powers, while she puts humans into comas.  Fearing that her boyfriend Bobby Drake/Iceman (Shawn Ashmore) may be straying from her to be with Kitty Pryde/Shadowcat (Ellen Page), who he can actually kiss, she begins to wonder what life would be like as a human.  Eventually, the movie culminates in a huge battle on Alcatraz Island, which is definitely the most epic sequence in the entire series.  While it is very good, there are a few times when I had to roll my eyes (though there were moments like that throughout the film).  The ending of the movie seemed to wrap up most of the events and themes of the series, making an effective trilogy (though I can't urge you enough to wait until the end of the credits to see a scene that reopens the franchise for a fourth film, which many insiders say is a possibility should The Last Stand do well in theaters).  This film is directed by Brett Ratner as opposed to Bryan Singer who directed the first two.  This was the source of all the controversy.  Due to some complications between Fox and Singer, he left the project to direct Superman Returns for Warner Brothers.  Fox then forced Ratner (who was not the first replacement) to get this film into theaters before Superman as a kind of \\"screw you\\" to Singer and Warner Brothers.  This, along with a few pre-release photos of Grammer as Beast and Jones as Juggernaut caused a lot of fans to be skeptical of what the final project could be.  Fortunately, in my opinion, the movie turned out well for everything that was standing in its way.  It had problems (as I said, there was some dialogue that merited some eye rolls) including a somewhat poor explanation for the Phoenix.  Cyclops is underused, but that is no different from Signer's installments.  Unfortunately, he has always been glossed over, which is sad, seeing as how he is a really great character in the comics.  Finally, there are just way too many characters.  Many of them get very little to do, and this goes for both new and returning charactesr.  Warren Worthington III/Angel (Ben Foster) does very little, Rogue doesn't even participate in the final fight, and many of the new Brotherhood mutants have one moment to shine then are forgotten.  But all in all, the movie worked pretty well.  The one thing I never understood is that Joss Whedon, the man who wrote the cure storyline in the comics and expressed a lot of interest for writing, and after Singer left, directing, was never even consdiered by Fox.  Oh well, everything turned out well in the end.

0679422714|4.0|I truly agree with those who say that to criticise a book about a tyrant equals an immediate assumption that those who criticise are somewhat fond of the tyrant's ideals. Anyway, this is not my case, since I've always hated Mao, Stalin, Hitler and all those mass murderers. <br /> <br />In the case of this book, I have to agree that no mater all the thorough research that has been certainly made in order to write this book, we keep on having the feeling Mao is being continuously treated as the monster he truly was but in a very biased way. I mean, one thing is to say Mao was an evil man who took control of China, and another thing is to say Mao was a monster that took control of China in a monstrous way in order to become even more monstrous. Even if both affirmations are true, the first one fits rightly in what is supposed to be an historical approach, while the other is more fitted for a biography written by a fugitive of Mao's labour camps who has accumulated hatred for him throughout the years. <br /> <br />As for those who think Mao had to have something of a genius in order to take control of China, well ... things tend to be a lot easy when you spread a reign of terror around you, have the moral and financial support of a superpower nation, have a good propaganda warfare machine and dwell in the middle of a highly poor, unhappy and uneducated people. <br /> <br />Anyway, I'm quite sure all the events detailed in this book are true and based on real documented events. Take the personal opinions out (easily identifiable) and what you are left with is a landmark in the history of Mao's already published biographies.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This is a miniseries of epic proportions, but even though it's 10 hours long, plus a bunch of bonus features, it's well worth every single second.  To many people today who weren't there, WWII seems like ancient history, and the veterans are elderly.  This miniseries goes a long way towards disspelling those preconceptions among those who might have them.  The action and the times are immediate, and we get to see these soldiers as they were then, as young vibrant young men.  The viewer goes through everything they do--basic training, preparations for D-Day, D-Day itself (the second episode really makes it vividly clear just why it was called \\"Day of Days\\"), battles in France, Operation Market-Garden in Holland, how the men felt towards the replacements who came in after D-Day, the Battle of the Bulge in Belgium and the long hard ordeal in the forest of Bastogne, battles in Germany, the ending of the war in Germany, the liberation of the Landsberg camp, the capture of Hitler's Eagle's Nest in the beautiful Austrian mountains, and their very early return to civilian life during the immediate end of the war, while they were still stationed in Austria but not doing any more fighting.  BoB makes it so clear why this generation has been dubbed \\"The Greatest Generation,\\" why WWII was a morally justified war, and why we should all be very thankful that these men (and countless others like them) did this, sometimes even making the ultimate sacrifice, to free Europe and the world from tyranny.  It portrays war as it really is, and makes this experience so real.<br /><br />Each of the main discs has a field guide, which provides a glossary, an explanation of Army ranks, maps, a historical timeline, a summary of the episode, and profiles of the soldiers featured in each episode.  I was very pleased that the sections on the soldiers contained no spoilers, so that the viewer can find out for oneself what happens to each particular soldier in each episode as opposed to knowing ahead of time, for example, that one of them might be killed or injured during that episode.  The bonus material is also great.  There's a featurette on the making of BoB, a special message from Jeep, previews of each episode, a very powerful, moving, and poignant documentary based around interviews with the surviving veterans of Easy Company and historical footage, short video clips to give a general idea of each of the main soldiers, a written who's-who section on the soldiers, and a 12-part video diary from actor Ron Livingston, showing the real boot camp he and his co-stars went through in preparation for this miniseries.  You don't really find that kind of thing too much anymore, with actors literally throwing themselves into a role like that.  They went through ten days of boot camp and the exact type of military training the real-life soldiers did, complete with equipment and clothing from the 1940s, and also had to endure such things as sleeping in bombed-out buildings and re-enacted battle scenes.  This was a great strategy, and helped them immensely in being able to portray these soldiers so well, since they'd already been put in their mindset and gone through these experiences more or less for real.<br /><br />Since this miniseries is 10 hours long and the viewer goes through so many emotional ups and downs with these men, with such realistic recreations of battles and everything else they went through, one can almost feel as though one knows these men and that it's more than just a very long movie.  This is an incredibly epic and personal experience, and is so much more than just another WWII movie.  (Although, for obvious reasons, I wouldn't recommend watching it with young children, due to the graphic violence, graphic injuries, a brief sex scene near the beginning of the ninth episode, and a lot of off-color language.)  We see war through the eyes of those who lived it; it's not portrayed as some glorious adventure, nor is it potrayed as constant bombardment and suffering.  We see the ups and the downs of war, and fully come to see in the ninth episode why this war had to be fought.  I actually felt a bit sad after coming to the end of the bonus disc, after having invested so much time and emotion into the lives of these heroic men.  This is one of the most emotional and powerful movie experiences anyone could ever hope for, and one that should be revisited many times.bardment and suffering.

You can't just read this book one time.  This is a book that must be dog-earred, written on, underlined and high-lighted.  Each time I pick it up, I find some new discovery! Great read, awesome reference!
B00005JOVH|4.0|Having been looking forward to this since the release of X2, I can safely say that I was not disappointed. <br /> <br />Of course I, like many others, have my petty complaints (no gambit, too short, too many trite, 5th rate mutants,) but overall I felt this to be an outstanding effort, with a few flaws, in terms of characters and their personalities, backstories, etc, etc. <br /> <br />- Colossus has no russian accent. <br />- No Storm/Calisto backstory brought up <br />- Psylocke is a british woman with psychic abilities <br /> <br />but those aside, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.  I was amazed at how well crafted Beast was, this being my main concern, since he's one of my favorites, but lo and behold, I wasn't disappointed in the least. <br /> <br />The one thing that stood out the most, to me anyways, was Ellen Page's performance.  Although she had only a few lines, I felt her screen presence to be incredibly captivating, but of course I absolutely LOVED Hard Candy, which made me a fan, so I suppose I'm a bit biased. <br /> <br />Ms. Page aside, I think the majority of the actors got their characters down very well (how couldn't they, this is their 3rd time around.) but the newer people did great as well, especially Juggernaut, whose personality was pinned down to a t. <br /> <br />Overall, this was worth every penny of the $6.50 I paid, and I would whole heartedly recommend it for a Friday/Saturday/Summer action flick.
B000AADYRQ|5.0|I suppose Death Cab for Cutie could be classified as emo or goth or something ,   but I don't care. I loved this cd. It had a lot of good, new sound songs and I scold anyone who doesn't give them a fair chance.    Some tracks (I'll Follow You Into The Dark, Brothers on A Hotel Bed, What Sarah Said) make you think and overcome you with a weird sense of emotion. Others (Crooked Teeth and Soul Meets Body) are more upbeat and catchy. This album really sang to me even though quite a few of the songs were depressing. A good listen when you're in a slower and quieter mood. Crooked Teeth, Soul Meets Body, What Sarah Said, Your Heart is an Empty Room, and the amazing I'll Follow You Into the Dark are some of my favorites. You may have to give some songs a second chance ( what I did ) or skip slow introductions (What Sarah Said) but overall, this album is very worthwhile.
1400079179|3.0|Dan Brown's novel needs no introduction, merely because it is so well known.  So I am going to skip plot introduction and go straight to my opinion, which is basically that this book is fascinating.<br /><br />At first I dismissed the story as simple, and did not realize how hooked I got, until I read in only two days.  Yeah.... But now, I recognize my judgment was rushed, and that there were positives and negatives, and that too label 'simple' is too pass judgment, too simply.<br /><br />What I particularly liked was the focus on history (fact or fiction) and how since the book has come out, more average people have been taking time out of their life to do a little learning about art, the catholic church, and perhaps more generally just books.  At the same time, the story is really quite a common-type thriller, and if it weren't for the hypothetical truths that all seem to be debating over, few people would have read the book.<br /><br />I'd also like to mention though, that compared to his first book, `Angels & Demons', I prefer `The Da Vinci Code' because, well frankly it is notably less gruesome.  So on the whole, I recommend that you read this book (especially before the movie), but this probably won't be your most favorite book.

I wish they could put everything on one album but that's a bit ambitious I'm sure!  But this is a great compilation of their songs!  Thumbsup!!
B000F6IOC0|2.0|I watched this movie at first hoping it could at least be a descent sequel like it was supposed to be.   Not even close.   The story goes from moveing fast, to agonizingly slow, and then back to fast.   I dont mind a slow movie but changing the pace too much just makes me bored.   The special effects are cool, but nothing to get too excited about.   If you have seen the first movie then you dont get anything new out of this one.   Mostly though, the villans are boring.   If I want to see someone who can regenerate from ANY wound in one day then I will watch X-men agian.   Don't get me wrong, I liked the first movie, but I feel cheated out of a couple bucks after watching this, so unless you have to see it to make your life complete then you are better off with any other vampire movie.
B0000259IH|5.0|It is a shame really, that a lot of talented artists, such a Michael Jackson, had to resort to \\"Crossing Over\\", (Thriller), to get a little respect and acknowledgement. Even though years prior, before \\"Thriller\\", \\"Off The Wall\\" displayed his obvious and undeniable talent as a successful solo artist. This album made Michael Jackson relevant and creditable.  <br />-He commands the lyrics on \\"Don't Stop til' You Get Enough\\" with a soft, mature, and controlled falsettous fury. The energy,  the sound, the beat, and the technical melody is unmistakable to this day. Michael takes you places, musically,  midway through the song, and brings you back with a loud \\"OOOOOH\\"!!!!-This phenomenal record is almost a song within a song. There is so many things going on throughtout, its hard to pick out whats what. The beats are so complex and intricate, as well as, hard to discribe sounds that are truly fresh and unique. It almost sounds to me like Michael can be heard playing on a bathroom drain pipe with a pair of spoons, while blowing through a bottle at the same time!!! <br />-(or maybe not.)-smile!! <br />-You see, this is what makes this album so much better than \\"Thriller\\". The risks and the limitless creativeity that engulfs this project will forever stand the test of time.  <br />This album is a historical musical milestone.  <br />As I continue on, <br />-\\"Rock with you\\", \\"Off The Wall, and \\"Burn This Disco Out\\", were all written by Rod Temperton; And less not forget, contributed greatly to Michael's huge success as a solo artist. \\"Rock with you\\", the better of the three, starts off with an introduction of heavy and distinctive drum beats, which afterwards,  allowed michael to croon and flow through the mellow melody with ease. The smooth rhythms of \\"Rock With You\\" is a welcomed change after the hyperkinetic energy of \\"Don't stop til' you get enough\\"!! <br />-Ladies and Gentlemen, what can I say about Michael's \\"Working Day and Night\\" except, Michael never seems to let up on this song either; -He puts it in over-drive. He safely escorts you through his wild musical beats like the crocadile hunter going at a 100mph in the AFRICAN jungle while being chased by a hungry LION!!  <br />-\\"Girlfriend\\" is a easely dimissable, forgettable, NERDY, and clueless, but playful piece of work written by paul mcartney. I'm not sure why michael and \\"Q\\" decided to put this song on the album. It really is out of place. <br />-(It reminds me of the \\"girl is mine\\" on \\"Thriller\\")!!! <br />-\\"I can't help it\\", -This jazzy love ballad created by Stevie Wonder proudly displayed Michael's soulfulness and joyous passion for his work. This has got to be my favorite song on the whole album!!! <br />\\"She's out of my life\\"-makes you weak with vulnerablity. In this song, Michael truly bares his soul. <br />Overall, I must say, Michael Jackson incredible talent is overwhelmingly evident on \\"Off the wall; Even though, \\"Thriller\\" and a niave MTV generation will ultimately over-shadow the brilliance of this great album, while gaining Michael Jackson the recognition he so rightfully deserved. No one could forsee, however, that he would eventually loose touch with what brought him to the dance in the first place.  <br />-His SOULFULNESS.
B000EOTAM6|1.0|I dont mind getting thrown into a fast paced action movie.   But when the main character can perform moves in a Kill Bill fashion without the intentional camp factor then it get boring really fast.   The plot was a flop for me though I didnt know about a series before I watched the movie.   Apparently she gets driven into moral action outside of her duty when she begins remembering things from a past life she had some 400 years ago, goes against the orders of some all knowing rebel leader, begins figuring out things that no human logic could jump to, and manages to fit a sex scene in all at the same time.   I will say though, the cg was pretty good, but other than that there is no reason to see this movie.

B0000009RX|5.0|\\"We're Only In It For The Money\\" reminds me of an early \\"MAD\\" magazine. If you are familiar with the first incarnations of this magazine, even as far back as the days when it was a comic book (early and mid 1950's), it does share some elements. Where the record by the Mothers is a pointed barb at what was happening in 1967, and the magazine wasn't topical early on, each has lots of little barbs and puns, and you have to peruse it several times to see what's going on here.<br /><br />This work has been criticized for having abstract sound collages being passed off as musical compositions, but remembering that Zappa found tonic value in nonmusical sounds and used them as part of his repertoire, especially at a time when musicians were looking for the furthest-out things they could record, the \\"noise\\" on this disc fits right into what this recording is all about. The Mothers Of Invention were the Anti-Beatles. The Fab Four had long-since sold out, selling merchandise that had nothing to do with their music, to a degree that was rivaled only by KISS, a full decade later. So, why not substitute the neatly trimmed mustaches and glittering Sgt. Pepper outfits of the Beatles with scruffy beards, stringy hair, and dresses that look like they came out of a third-rate thrift store? Ugliness was always a part of the Mothers' image. The picture on the cover that spells \\"MOTHERS\\" in watermelons and carrots, is pretty clever, considering the other cover uses flowers to spell \\"BEATLES.\\" The slam-dunk of poor taste in the artwork, apart from the image included here of Lee Harvey Oswald being shot, is the mannequin on the left side of the cover photo, face blacked out, arms broken off, and the stomach split open, giving Cesarian birth to a baby doll. And to think, the Beatles' \\"Butcher\\" photo was banned from publication for, how many years? This is one thing of many that makes the Mothers Of Invention one of my all-time favorite bands; the all-out tackines of it all. It is a slap in the face to all the restrictions some folks seem to feel entitled to impose on the rest of us. This band was what happens when you think you can control people. Rebellion. Conformity is scary, if it is coerced.<br /><br />Despite the muddiness of the sound, this was a cutting-edge recording, and still is, even this many years later. The rapid-fire of sounds and ideas can be a little confusing, even exhausting, especially if this isn't what one is used to hearing. There have  been times where I would be listening to this, and people would go \\"WHAT ARE YOU LISTENING TO?\\" So I would just laugh at the private joke shared by the band and me. And, yes, despite the good musicianship and the seriousness of the state of things then and now, it is, a huge, elaborate joke. Original vocalist Ray Collins began to dislike Zappa's songs, and started to hate singing his lyrics, and had temporarily left the band at this point. It's my guess that \\"Call Any Vegetable\\" was the last straw. The lyrics to \\"Uncle Meat\\" are similar, and Collins' tracks were recorded at this time. But the content of this piece is so pointed, so incisive, that Collins, I feel, missed out on the band's peak. Bringing Bunk Gardner, Don Preston, Ian Underwood and Billy Mundi into the band over the past year, already better than many bands at this point, pushed the talent level over the top. And the financial strain of touring this band hadn't driven it into the ground yet.<br /><br />This was an unusual band, poking fun at the very people that gave it it's livelyhood. One listen to \\"Who Needs The Peace Corps?\\" shows this. The band sings \\"...every town must have a place where phony hippies meet, psychedelic dungeons popping up on every street...,\\" and the phony hippies still bought the record, and still followed the band. A forgiving bunch, I guess.<br /><br />Probably the most subtle bit of parody on this record is closing it with \\"The Chrome Plated Megaphone Of Destiny.\\" As everyone knows, \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" ended with \\"A Day In The Life,\\" featuring abstract sounds from the orchestra building up to a creshendo, letting loose at the right time, the last time ending on that one big piano chord that fades into infinity. Here, it's all a sampling of sounds and voices with no melody, and ending it on a lone chord that fades the exact same way.<br /><br />As stated earlier, this is like reading the oldest copies of a \\"MAD\\" magazine.

Jake Gyllenhaal does a decent job in this film,but this film feels like a Music video in spots&just takes on so many cliches of service life&War without having a real central zone. the film felt long&just  didn't really move me in the end. there was a great story wanting to come out,but this film was nowhere in that neighborhood to me.
B000AZLK8Q|2.0|This film would have gotten three stars from me if ONLY the fight scenes were not so HORRIBILY directed. Shot at extreme close-up, one has to struggle, unsuccessfully, to follow them. I cannot believe the crappy way those scenes were shot, it ruined the whole movie for me. The clueless director should have taken a cue from Spiderman 2 or the X-Men movies. People want to be able to see the action in fight scenes. Maybe he did not want us to get to good of a look at that terribly designed bat-suit. In fleeting shots, it looks okay, but if you get a good look at it, forget it. This film probably would have done better at the box-office (it limped to 200 million, good, but look nothing compared to the spidey movies, a fact which I am sure disappointed Warners, but that it is what they get for having a director ill-equipped to direct coherent fight sequences) if these flaws had been fixed before release. <br /> <br />Also, it looked like he tried to rip off the far superior \\"Blade Runner\\" in some of the claustraphobically obvious set scenes. (hell, he even has Rutger Hauer (Nexus Six) in a barely there supporting role!) The use of real world settings like Chicago, does NOT mesh when mixed in with these scenes, which also have some laughably chessey cgi, exspecially for a film with a supposed $ 200 million budget. Most of that budget must have wound up in someones pocket, or more likely, it was only there on paper. <br /> <br />Bale was merely okay as Batman, to me he has an overall sinester appearance unsuitable for the role. Katie Holmes was a baby doll so she could have been awful and I would not have cared, but she was servicable in a thankless damsel in distress role. Neeson was good, but too beefy for the role of Ras. Why do they always do that?  Way back in ' 89's \\"Batman\\" fat ass, bald nicholson was all wrong visually for Joker, yet he undeniably stole the show with a great performance. Neeson was unable to overcome this asthetic  flaw to  to make the role his own. And where was his hot daughter Talia, or his hulking henchman , Ubu ? The only cool thing was the red herring thrown at us concerning Ras's true identity.  Oldman made an okay Gordon, but being able to not only drive that crappy looking batmobile with no training, but succeeding in his mission with it? Gimme a break.  <br /> <br />Now for the one thing that made this movie cool for me , Cillian Murphy's STANDOUT performance as the \\"Scarecrow\\"!! He was incredible and truly made the role his own, the one real casting gem in this seriously flawed film. But, he did not have enough screen time. Why do these idiotic movie executives feel the need to have two major villians in every \\"Batman\\" movie since the original?  Again, have they learned nothing from Spiderman's incredible success? The first Batman film had a gross none of these seguels could remotely come close to, especially if you factor in adjustments for inflation. Why in the hell are they so retarded?  If Scarecrow had been the only villian, the movie would have been much more solid. He should definately return as the main villian in a sequel. <br /> <br />It was way too long.  That's right , you don't even see Batman until the film is half over. The boring first hour spends WAY too much time focusing on Bruce Wayne's transformation into becoming Batman. Again, the incoherent fight scenes do NOT help matters, although for some stupid reason, Bruce's fight scenes are easier to follow, which is really dopey, 'cause people laying down their hard earned cash expected to be able to see BATMAN in action, not all this training crap. I am damn glad I did not pay money to see this in the theater. Matter of fact, I pretty much never pay to see movies anymore, because of crap like this. The simple minded exec's who greenlight this stuff try way too hard to suck in every possible demographic, (this reached a pinnacle with Batman and Robin) diluting the movies into averge pap unworthy of my hard earned cash. <br /> <br />So, I am still waiting for a truly good Batman movie. I think that one with a different director, better shot fight scenes, a better looking batsuit, more like the one from the actual comics, complete with visible bat symbol with the yellow , a utility belt that looks like it could actually hold stuff, and a better looking cowl, along with the return of Scarecrow as the major villian. Or Joker, if he is done right. Which I doubt will ever happen.  <br /> <br />Why does hollywood hate comic book fans?

0307276902|5.0|This was a very good book about the trials an addict faces in recovery. Although the writer may have exaggerated on some points, it was still very accurate and held my attention until the last page. I even intend to purchase the next book. I couldn't put it down.
B000002U82|5.0|This is a very good release from my younger years.  Is it over-rated?  Of course it is.  Is it great?  Yes it is.  I'm not sure I understand the almost universal appeal of Dark Side of the Moon and how it stayed on Billboard's top 200 for almost 15 years, but I do enjoy listening from time-to-time.  Not that I always could mind you...  My younger brother had the lp and he played it and played it and played it.  It was at least a decade before I could stand to listen to it again.<br /><br />These days the synths sound rather dated when Wright is using the sine-wave and saw-tooth-wave forms on the VCS3 synths.  My daughter, when she was about 7 years old, was riding in my car and DSOTM was playing.  Her analysis was:  \\"Dad!  that's Nintendo music!\\"  I had to laugh.<br /><br />Still, this is worth your money and more than the occasional listen.  Gilmore and that guest sax player Dick Parry play some very soulful lines throughout the CD.  Gilmore's playing is tasteful, uses silence very well (the guy knows when not to play, i.e, he doesn't try to play 32 notes per beat like some shredders)<br /><br />I think it is funny how some reviewers shower this with grand falloons such as \\"The greatest record ever\\" and so on.  First of all, when it comes to artistic expression, sales don't mean squat.  Roger Waters would be the first guy to tell you that, in fact he did so on \\"Wish You Were Here.\\"  The tracks \\"Have a Cigar\\" and \\"Welcome to the Machine\\" lambast the runaway commerical success of Dark Side of the Moon, and subsequent fan and record executive expectations for their next release.  I recall being alarmed when I heard Waters had spit on an audience in Toronto (or was it Montreal?) some years back, I thought \\"what a jerk\\".  I could never condone spitting on someone but with reviews like The Mostest, Greatest, Bestest, Goodest, Niftiest, Most Colossalist Awesome-ist record ever made, I can understand how he got to that point.  Listen:  These guys are artists, not rock stars - they really couldn't care less about your exhortations. They just want you to listen and hopefully be moved by what they've done.  End of story.  While Dark Side of the Moon is sounding a little dated in places because of the synths, it is certainly still very moving.<br /><br />One small bone of contention.  When reviewers heap all that nonsensical praise on this recording, they seem to forget that producer/engineer Alan Parsons had a HUGE hand in the creation of this masterwork.care less about your exhortations.

B000EMGAOY|5.0|After the technically proficient but slightly hollow sounding By The Way, the Red Hot Chili Peppers appeared something of a spent force. A greatest hits album, a live disc, whilst worthy additions to their canon were by no means essential purchases for fans who, to be fair, already knew the songs. New tracks such as \\"Fortune Faded\\" showed a band grasping for ideas. <br /> <br />I have no idea what happened, but \\"Stadium Arcadium\\" is an unadulterated joy from beginning to end, with the Chili's genuinely  rediscovering a groove they have not tapped since the seminal \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magik\\", and managing to seamlessly mix it with passionate, heartfelt, more mid-tempo songs that ebb and flow and tug at your heartstrings in a way that the plastic balladry of By The Way could never do. <br /> <br />The first disc begins with radio friendly single \\"Dani California\\", a song which announces the return of the Chili's with a stomping drum beat, fluid guitar hooks and a bubbling bass part which shows that the increasingly passive Flea has rediscovered his mojo. Kiedis too, has never sounded finer, bringing back his old school, staccato delivery but adding his new found power and sensitivity to the mix. <br /> <br />Other highlights of \\"Jupiter\\" include the shimmering Snow ((Hey Oh)), raucous Hump de Bump, which brings back the old funk rock stylings of the Peppers, complete with horns, and the more considered brace of ending songs Wet Sand and Hey.  <br /> <br />\\"Mars\\" is a slightly less in your face affair than the first disc, starting with the thoughtful, but still stadium sized Desecration Smile, and including the mellowed Animal Bar, If and Hard To Concentrate. It also includes the album's only real misfire, the wooden 21st Century, which despite being a track most bands would sell body parts for, seems weak in comparison to the rest of the material on display here. <br /> <br />This album also marks the complete rehabilitation of guitarist John Frusciante. Not only is he now a genius at picking out the finest tones and knowing which notes go where, he has also regained the prodigious skill that he possessed on his earlier work with the band, a skill that was absent from By The Way, and to an extent Californication. Every few tracks Frusciante thrillingly cuts loose, and adds a whole new dimesnsion to the band's sound. <br /> <br />Overall, the Red Hot Chili Peppers have created an album of heart, power and beauty, and it should not be ignored. With enough hooks for the mainstream, and enough cleverness and genre hopping to satisfy the muso, this could well be one of the albums of 2006.
B00005Y1TL|4.0|I'm a newcomer to Aphex Twin and the world of electronica in general, but even a rank newbie can recognize brilliance when he hears it. And this is no exception.<br /><br />It's hard to believe that British wunderkind Richard D. James was only a teenager playing around with synths and samples (dating back to 1985, no less). This album's composition remains wholly undated and refreshingly accessible (an aspect that isn't always present in later Aphex Twin) laden with hooks in the form of catchy basslines, clever beats, and intriguing found sounds. Every track is at least above-average, and some are amazing--opener Xtal, with its blissed-out female vocals and waltz-like rhyhtm, is a track that I wish could last double its 5-minute run. Same with the dancy Pulsewidth and Heliosphan, the proto-IDM of Green Calx, and the serene beauty of I.<br /><br />In fact, I'm only docking the half-star because the merely good tracks (ie. Tha, Ptolemy) stretch for a bit too long while the great tracks get cut short. Oh well, that's what the repeat button is for...<br /><br />Absolutely necessary for the foundation of an electronica collection, and just great in general (so long as you're not expecting insanely complex Rubik's Cube IDM like Autechre). \\"We are the Music Makers,\\" indeed.
B0009R1T7M|1.0|This album sucks.  It's just prog-rock given the title \\"indie\\"<br /><br /> and suddenly everyone eats it up.  It has way more in common with Yes or Genesis than anything that's real rock and roll.  PRETENTIOUS!

B000B8QEYC|3.0|I felt the words 'caged bird' were appropriate for the title of my review simply for the fact that I believe that Enya is a caged bird. Her creativity has been caged by monotony and the inability to try something new.<br /><br />If you want a sure and time-tested formula, this is the album for you. Enya really does not re-invent the wheel. For a fan of her musicianship, I think she is sadly held back by Nicky and Roma Ryan. She needs to assert herself more and find new songwriters. Amarantine? What the heck? Poor word choice and the song is sickenly dull. Amarantine, the word, doesn't even sound pretty. It doesn't feel right in a song either. Amarantine sounds like it should have belonged on Memory of Trees. Somebody Said Goodbye sounds like it could belong on Memory of Trees.<br /><br />The two best songs on the album are The River Sings and Water Shows the Hidden Heart. She sounds her best. The River Sings also helps to cut through the dull slo-mo of songs. They sound so similiar and run into each other. I also would like to say I hated Sumiregusa. I know this probably an ode to her Japanese fans. However, her layered singing drowns out the beauty of the words.<br /><br />If you don't mind a lack of change and are an Enya fan, I am sure you would love this album.<br /><br />If you haven't heard much of Enya's material and have never bought any of her CDs, I recommend you stick to her first three albums - Celts, Watermark, and Shepherds Moon. They are her best work.<br /><br />She needs a new songwriter for starters. She also needs to experiment with instruments more. Her samples are getting old.<br /><br />I hate to be harsh, but I am just not happy with her artistic offerings this time around. She has so much more potential.<br /><br />Finally, I give her three stars simply for the fact that her voice is beautiful and her albums are always well produced. Beyond that, this album really is a two.

B000EYK4GW|4.0|I had to scratch my head when I saw that Disney was re-releasing \\"Dumbo\\" at the end of this month. The 60th anniversary edition pretty much covered the gamut of bonus features and improved animation. What could possibly be done on this new version? Not much.<br /><br />The story of a baby elephant named Dumbo with big ears who is treated as if he was freak by the other elephants remains timeless as ever. With the help of his mouse friend Timothy, Dumbo comes to terms with his unique physical appearance and eventually comes to appreciate his rather large ears. After all these years, I still enjoy \\"Dumbo\\" as much as I did the first time I saw it in elementary school. I still get all choked up when Dumbo goes to visit his mother which is very sweet yet sad. \\"Baby Mine\\" still gets to me after all these years.<br /><br />This version of \\"Dumbo\\" is definitely geared more towards the younger generation with the games & activities, music, and bonus shorts. Is this worth $29.99? Not really but if you get it a cheaper cost, then it is worth it for your kids. The 60th anniversary edition is much better for adults who want to own this classic animated film.
0393327655|5.0|This is truly a revolutionary book.  Most of us were taught that two things are never discussed in polite company...religion and politics.  Nearly everybody, myself included, has been indoctrinated with the idea that \\"religious freedom\\" means that one shouldn't engage or challenge others' religious beliefs.  However, Sam Harris' thesis, amply supported, is that religious faith in general is dangerous (some more so than others, particularly Islam) and that failing to engage in discourse on it with people (from the perspective of an atheist) is virtually akin to ignoring a crime.  In a sense, the book is almost a plea for a kind of evangelical atheism, to get people to abandon the faith they grew up in and in which they deeply believe--a difficult task, to say the least.  Although such a movement (maybe someday there will be a First Atheist Unchurch, with sermons and discussions on the dangers of faith)does not yet exist, maybe it is time that it should.  The reaction against such a movement is likely to be rather pronounced, I'm sure, and for various reasons of self-interest I doubt most atheists will take up the call.  However, it may be that such sympathies are more widespread than one might think...I took the book to read one day while I was working out, and one of the personal trainers at the gym smiled when he saw me reading it and said \\"great book.\\"  I think Harris for the most part is right on the mark, and he has a very pithy writing style.  I might also note it is unfair to attack him on failing to provide more neuroscientific evidence for his views, because the state of science in this area is still in its infancy, and he does quote the few relevant recent articles along these lines in his bibliography.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|This is one of those incredible movies that I want to watch again and again. It is not a happy ending, and I found myself lamenting over lost chances for peace, but this story line makes an impact on the viewer that won't be forgotten. When the peaceful King Baldwin dies at a young age, it's hoped that the blacksmith son of Knight Godfrey will take the king's place. Though things would've been far better, Balian struggles too much with his dark past to do what must be done to marry the princess, take the crown, and save the kingdom from bloodshed. Great movie!<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author
B000EHRVP6|1.0|There is an extremely funny Internet Flash-animation series called \\"Retarded Animal Babies,\\" wherein our titular characters drink, swear, do things of an outrageously sexual nature, and sometimes meet gory deaths; it's easily the most hilarious animated series out there, and possesses an understated intelligence and razor-sharp satire that probably goes unnoticed by most of its viewers.  Every time an episode loads, as the 'KB' tally increases towards being fully loaded, a separate countdown beneath it shows the viewer's IQ rapidly decreasing.  \\"Hostel\\" is a movie that carries much in common with that latter countdown; in a way, it is the cinematic equivalent of mental retardation--the more you watch, the dumber you become.  This is the latest offesive, over-hyped piece of trash from the talentless Eli Roth (who also gave us the inexplicably--and unjustly--successful dung heap, \\"Cabin Fever\\"), whose incredible popularity will always be an infuriating mystery to me (just seeing that snapshot of him amongst the 'Masters of Horror' directors makes my stomach turn).  Any attempt at a plot synopsis is pretty superficial in the nihilistic world of \\"Hostel\\"--we have a group of homophobic, rock-stupid, jock-like American guys backpacking through Europe when they run afoul of nude, loose females who find idiocy an irresistible aphrodisiac.  Anyway, our femme fatales transport our boys to a dank, bowels-of-hell warehouse (complete with poor lighting!) where they are tortured and murdered by a bunch of wealthy businessmen who get their kicks from killing.  Like \\"Retarded Animal Babies,\\" \\"Hostel\\" tries to inject some satire into its poisonous blood, but doesn't have an ironic bone in its body--Roth fogs up the screen with so much prurient flesh and gratuitous gore that any 'message' is muddled at best.  The film is an out-of-control mess of unfunny, barn-door 'humor,' blood-caked squalor, and juvenile masturbational fantasy.  We never build any sympathy for our completely unlikable 'protagonists,' and therefore cannot care all that much as they are drilled, dissected, and disfigured; some might argue that that is the whole Point, but I didn't even find myself applauding their deaths...instead, an icy detachment washed over me.  I wound up being neither impressed nor horrified by whatever gore effect Roth would throw in my face next--his craftsmanship is so poor and his overall tone so unbalanced that it's impossible to look at \\"Hostel\\" as anything more than a monument of ineptitude that doesn't even succeed in a so-bad-it's-good way.  Mr. Roth proved himself a fluke with the inexplicable success of \\"Cabin Fever,\\" but when something as grotesque and tasteless as \\"Hostel\\" rakes in millions and gets a heavy DVD promo push, it speaks volumes for not only America's bankrupt morality in finding 'thrills' in such rancid material, but how complacent we are in accepting such things.

B000929AJQ|4.0|A few years back, I went through a total Anti-NIN Phase, where I all but denounced the Nailhead Religion in favor of other forms of music (most of which I have similarly denounced at this point, ironically).  There were times when I found myself longing for that gruff yet sensitive tone that Mr. Reznor so often invoked in his emotionally contrived, angsty anthems.  Back in '99, I was so smitten with the band that I picked up \\"The Fragile\\" the day it was released, and was so hell-bent on hoping for a revolutionary masterpiece that I tricked my mind into thinking it was such.  Eventually, my optimism and naivete wore off and gave way to a rankled cynicism...one Amazon reviewer stated that the two-disc opus was \\"more bloated than a whale in labor...like listening to two hours of flatulence,\\" and it shamed me to agree with that.  Understandably, I was put off of NIN for several years, until the release of \\"With Teeth\\" became imminent; on the eve of the album's release, I listened to it for free on MySpace, and was literally (all caps) BLOWN AWAY.  Not only had Mr. Reznor dumped the pretentious, concept-album baggage of \\"The Fragile,\\" but also  produced a more compact, economical album that succeeded because it WASN'T trying to dazzle us with 'innovation' around every corner.  Considering how hard he's tried to inject some degree of originality in every project he's produced, it was rather refreshing to see Trent go down the musical path of least resistance with \\"With Teeth\\"--it is more successful than most of his other albums because it adheres more closely to convention (granted, convention done well, with its own inventive tweakings).  That being said, there are still some sprinkles of creativity to be found, from the sinister 'Sunspots' to the aural stellarsphere of 'Beside You in Time.'  Though nearly every track on the album is a singular standout, it might prove inaccessible for fans who have spent years championing NIN's innovation.  For the rest of us, however, this shows either a personal submission or maturity on Trent's part, as he loosens the expectations of both his fan base and himself to produce what he does best --catchy pop songs with a leathery rock exterior, punctuated with snippets of electronic noise.this shows either a personal submission or maturity on Trent's part, as he loosens the expectations of both his fan base and himself to produce what he does best --catchy pop songs with a leathery rock exterior, punctuated with snippets of electronic noise.

B000002UCE|5.0|Easily Lennon's best post-Beatle work.  And what a shame too, as it only comes barely a year and a half after their final swan-song, \\"Let It Be\\" hit the market place.  One would think, that like his Beatle career, he would keep getting better and better and better.  But who was to know?  This disc, tastefully co-produced by Phil Spector (who also aided Lennon on his previous solo outing), is a much more commercial venture than \\"Plastic Ono Band,\\" his first real solo disc.  The vitrol in the lyrics are gone, replaced by themes of love for Yoko and the world.  The music is fuller, more fleshed out.  Not the least of reasons being that orchestration is used on several songs and Lennon employed for the most part, more musicians on each track than he did the \\"Plastic One Band\\" disc.  \\"Imagine\\" kicks off the dsic and it's an all-time classic.  Simple, solemnly-sung, touching and to the point.  \\"Crippled Inside\\" finds John getting superb aid from ex-bandmate George Harrison on dobro.  It's an upbeat, shuffling song, given a lot of life by Nicky Hopkin's honky-tonk piano.  \\"Jealous Guy\\" finds Lennon in a remorseful mood.  Heavenly orchestration allows Lennon to literally toy with the words, alternately caressing and pleading his case.  Jim Keltner excels on drums.  \\"It's so Hard\\" is up next.  It's a straight-ahead, hard-driving band number aided by the horn work of the late King Curtis.  \\"I Don't Want to be a Soldier\\" finishes off the side and really, it goes on too long.  This is the only real evidence of Spector's trademark wall-of-sound. Although the irony is that's it's a perfect fit for this song.  At over 6 minutes the song is not nearly interesting enough to keep us interested.  \\"Give Me Some Truth\\" is a blistering song and Lennon never lets up.  Harrison also excels again.  Harrison's contributions on guitar for this disc cannot be overstated.  His playing is simply brilliant and outside the scope of what he played for the Beatles.  \\"Oh My Love\\" is little more than a trite song with an interesting melody but Lennon sings it well and one tends to overlook it as it's sandwiched between two killer tracks.  \\"How Do You sleep\\" is John's personal attack on Paul.  The sneering vocal, the cutting slide played by George, and the on-the-money drumming by Alan White makes this one of the highlights of the disc.  \\"How\\" is another beautiful tune.  Who said he couldn't write good melodies?  \\"Oh Yoko\\" is rather endearing.  Even though it's about Yoko, it has a good tune and it's very catchy.  Avoid the new \\"Yoko re-mastered\\" version of this disc.  This is the version Lennon himself released in 1971.  How on earth could Yoko think she knows better than John.  This is Lennon's best solo work and the standard all his other solo efforts are compared to.a trite song with an interesting melody but Lennon sings it well and one tends to overlook it as it's sandwiched between two killer tracks.  \\"How Do You sleep\\" is John's personal attack on Paul.

I felt that this was just a juxtaposition of random thoughts spewed onto the page, without any consistency or coherency.  This is the first book I did not read word-for-word, and even skimming it was painful.  I do not recommend.

Even if Oasis take their sound farther than they used to do in thier biggest success What's the Story, it still sounds very \\"Oasis\\". <br />The best tracks are: Lyla, A Bell Will Ring and Let There Be Love. <br />If you were wishing for a good material by the Gallagher brothers, you must purchase this album
B000EULJLU|5.0|In case anyone's not yet aware, Wings for Marie(3), 10,000 Days(4) and Viginti Tres(11) are designed to function in synchronicity. Give it a try, you'll look at this album and the thought and time invested, in a different light. I'd be very cool if the band released a single for 10,000 days, in which they played these 3 tracks together, as they were meant to be. <br /> <br />The more I listen to the album, and in different moods or states of mind, there are so many more powerful feelings provoked that I couldn't see or feel at first glance. <br /> <br />The only thing I would change about the album, if I was in the band, I'd recommend a track or two after Viginti Tres. I had my hopes up, thinking I would find a very in depth, psychedelic musical wave of exploration, some incredible and haunting melody featuring Danny's work at it's best. An predictable clash of unconscious power, like a Reflection-ThirdEye-Flood culmination. <br /> <br />Despite my unrealistic and unanswered expectations, Tool is a form of art. The power and meaning of any artform lies in the perception of the beholder.
B000BZ99WY|5.0|This book Shake Hands with the Devil written by Lt.General Romeo Dalliare about his own encounter in Rwanda truly showed me the failure of humanity that is capable of hurting so much people, and how such a tragic event could happen without anyone trying to help it. After reading this book I truly understood why this event was so tramautizing for the author, as he even attempted to commit suicide after returning to Canada. The thought of wanting to help, but being helpless is one of the worse feelings one can experience. Overall this book was well written other than sometimes it can be complicated because of the vocabulary used and the numerous number of people that are involved with in this book. However, the glossary at the back is really helpful because it provided essential imformation to understanding some of the key words. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about genocides or how nowadays there are big events happening in other parts of the world that you never knew about. This book will amaze you and those of you who are emotionally I recommend having a box of tissue right next to you. The way he tells his experiences touches you so deep that you also feel like you were at Rwanda at the same time.
B0006399FS|4.0|30 years and counting, the legendary band U2 lives on. You'd be thinking these guys'd run out of steam and stop producing brilliant music. Wrong again. <br /> <br />I particularly liked 'City of Blinding Lights,' 'Sometimes you can't make it on your own,' and 'vertigo.' They, as well as the rest of the album, provide a nice blend of melodious music, as well as the trademark U2 rockish sound. <br /> <br />But admittedly, it can't match the likes of 'The Joshua Tree' or 'Achtung Baby,' though the track 'sometimes you can't make it on your own' sounds somewhat like the all time classic 'with or without you.' Which is why it gets 4/5. <br /> <br />So for all of you U2 fans, this album is throroughly impressive. It still captures the typical U2 tunes and melodies, and i do recommend it. But the thing is, it does pale slightly compared to some of their older albums.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|Anyone who has seen the Kingdom Heaven should at least give this one a rental. You owe it to yourself.  Whether you liked the theatrical release or were disappointed by it, you will find the pieces that you may have sensed were missing from that earlier version.  The 2005 release was cut, released, and marketed as a summer action/thriller.  The director's cut is different film.  What we have here instead is a historical epic that answers all of those nagging questions that I have seen many reviwwers seize upon.The seeming plot flaws are smoothed and eliminated and much more developed characters result from these changes.    <br /> <br />If nothing else, this veersion of the movie is proof positive that editing can make, break, or destroy a film. The restored and extended scenes in this version of Kingdom of Heaven make it a totally new experience.    <br /> <br />While the Extended Versions of the Lord Of The Rings Trilogy are superior versions of very good, theatrically released films, the Kingdom of Heaven Director's Cut is vastly superior to its theatrical version..  Indeed, I would submit that this version will supplant the theatrical version, which will be soon forgotten,  It just doesn't measure up to this version.
B00003CX8N|4.0|How can a true bibliophile not like this 1987 chestnut? Based on Helene Hanff's semi-autobiographical story which was later translated to a short-lived Broadway play starring Ellen Burstyn, this is not a movie that has much action or even significant character development. However, it sneaks up on you with its delicate portrayal of a time-spanning, transatlantic friendship that develops between Hanff, a brash, struggling New York writer and antiquated book lover, and Frank Doel, the genteel manager of Marks & Co., a London bookstore specializing in rare books. It's a relationship based solely on postal correspondence, and they bond over the things they share about their lives. That's really it. Yet, director David Hugh Jones and screenwriter Hugh Whitemore flesh out the episodic story with warmth and affection. Also helpful in setting the right tone are George Fenton's period music and Brian West's burnished cinematography.<br /><br />Executive producer Mel Brooks bought this property as a birthday present for his wife, Anne Bancroft, and it's no wonder as it affords a prime opportunity for this wondrous actress to show off her subtle dexterity in making us care about this irascible woman with just her typewriter, endless shelves of books and a small circle of friends. Yet, she is not a pitiable character by any means, as in Bancroft's hands, she's smart, opinionated, funny and quite empathetic to the woes of the British after WWII.  As a precursor to his similarly quiet work in \\"The Remains of the Day\\", Anthony Hopkins brings an unexpectedly coiled passion to the strait-laced Frank. Well before her imperious persona set in, Judi Dench plays his Irish wife with warmth and a hint of her trademark spunk. I could have done without the decision to have Hanff look into the camera to narrate, and the episode where Hanff gets taken away in a police wagon is rather contrived. Regardless, the story evolves in such an engaging manner that it produces the necessary emotional response from the viewer by the end.  Sadly the 2002 DVD has no extras.from the viewer by the end.

B00005JOVH|2.0|I went into the theater probably thinking the same thing you'll think, this is gonna be a great movie. How can you not think that after seeing the advertisements and the other two films. But i have to say, I haven't been this dissappointed with a sequel since the second matrix film. <br /> <br />I have to say I really think things would have been different if Brian Singer would have stayed with the project. The acting, direction, and story all suffered because of this. <br /> <br />I really wanted to like this movie. I tried the entire hour and 45 minutes. The acting was very poor the second the movie started. There are few in the movie that stood out, but not many. Hugh Jackman, Wolverine, was able to pull off a very good performance. But not even Ian Mckellen or Patrick Stewart were able to do this, it was horrible. I'm not blaming this so much on the actor's as I am on the direction. That was probably the weakest part of the movie. They try and use the ploy of getting rid of characters to shock us. It instead is done very poorly and comes off as quick and unnecessary. The music was awful and usually completely innapropriate for the scene. <br /> <br />There were a few things I liked. As stated before I thought Wolverine and Pyro had good performances. It could have been great, instead it's a typical cash-sequel.
B00005JOVH|5.0|X-men distinguished itself from other modern sci-fi flick in a way that it is very human. It is about the human side of mutants. Their powers are there but what we are looking into are their human side, how they are not different from other humans when it comes to day to day life. They all long for love, they all suffer from loss, and they all wanted to be treated equally. However, dealing with differences is never the strength of Homo sapiens, so the story of X-men - the struggle for survival and integration in the human world, where they were supposed to belong to - continues.<br /><br />X3 presented itself as The Last Stand, hinting that it will be a story to end all stories. Is it true? In X2 we saw Scott suffered the lost of Jean, but will the return of Jean as Phoenix, the dark ego of herself, be able to fill the emptiness inside him? Jean had become what both Charles and Magneto have foreseen, someone they were both excited and worried, even scared. At this time came the cure, which ironically, was created from another mutant who has the power to neutralise any mutant power within his proximity - a mutant born to cure another mutant. Some people long for the cure, while others treated as a threat to their very own existence. A battle is on the verge of breaking out.<br /><br />In X3 we see a lot more on the human sides of the heroes and villains themselves. How they suffer more losses, how some were indifferent to the loss of others, how some to struggled just to be accepted, how some tried to change themselves so that they could seek what they want in life. However, would all these efforts come to an end with the rise of the Dark Phoenix - the mutant evolution that went beyond all mutants? We see a lot more mutants well known in the comics showing up in X3 - Multiple Man, Angel, Beast etc. We would also be able to see Iceman in his comic form for the first time. Fans of the comic or the movie series will not be disappointed. However, certain faces left us this time round, the most noticeable being the Nightcrawler, whom was featured quite prominently in X2. The director has changed but the direction of the movie hasn't so you can feel the continuity of style going quite naturally in X3. The movie was made a way that it is an end for the trilogy, but as usual, there is a tail to the end, probably if 20th Century Fox can get all the main cast signing up again (this time will be for an astronomical price), then we might see the X-men again.us this time round, the most noticeable being the Nightcrawler, whom was featured quite prominently in X2.

B000BMSTMS|5.0|I've been a big fan of Korn since their first album, but their output the last few years (see: \\"Take A Look In The Mirror\\") has been pretty mediocre. The news that they'd be collaborating with the Matrix (among others) on \\"See You On The Other Side\\" didn't bode well. So I was pleasantly surprised to find the band breaking new ground with this CD, successfully reinventing themselves. True, it's far from the heaviest Korn album, but this is their best stuff since \\"Issues\\" and proof that the band still has a lot to say musically in 2006. Track-by-track thoughts: <br /> <br />1) Twised Transistor (4.5/5). Fairly poppy, but catchy as hell. Those who don't care for this song will be happy to know that the rest of the album doesn't sound like it. <br />2) Politics (3.5/5). Good music, but not a huge fan of the lyrics. <br />3) Hypocrites (4.5/5). One of the heavier tracks. Fans of older Korn will dig this one. <br />4) Souvenir (4/5). Typical Korn, but distinguished by a very cool breakdown. <br />5) 10 or a 2-Way (5/5). The album really starts to take off here. Twisted lyrics, outstanding drumming and great vocals, both singing and death-style. <br />6) Throw Me Away (5/5). Heavy on the industrial vibe, killer chorus. <br />7) Love Song (5/5). Another moody mid-tempo tune, very well done. <br />8) Open Up (6/5). Best song on the album. Freaky, funky epic with a Zeppelin-esque ending that will blow you away. <br />9) Coming Undone (4/5). Catchy, solid rocker. Good single. <br />10) Getting Off (4/5). Great intro and riffs undone by a somewhat lame chorus. <br />11) Liar (6/5). The heaviest song on the album, and maybe the best. An instant classic. <br />12) For No One (4/5). Solid song, but not particularly memorable. <br />13) Seen It All (5/5). Another epic that incorporates some elements (chorus, strings) that are unexpected but work well. <br />14) Tearjerker (5/5). Haunting ballad with some great vocals by Davis. <br /> <br />Along with System of a Down's \\"Mezmerize,\\"Bloodsimple's \\"A Cruel World\\" and Trivium's \\"Ascendancy,\\" this is on my short list of best metal albums of 2005.
0425188809|5.0|Though I do not include Dean Koonz among my favorite authors I have chosen to read \\"Watchers\\" since it was listed as a \\"must read\\" in a list compiled by fellow thriller authors and also had a good rating by readers from Amazon    Travis Cornell, a depressed loner having leisure in the mountains meets by chance a golden retriever who seems to have an IQ that exceeds the intelligence of a dog, from that on his life takes a sudden turn when he decides to become the master of this dog, he named Einstein.

Travis life is at risk, he will never return his beloved smart dog    Characters, emotions and events are so freshly and realistic described that in some chapters seem to pop out of the pages.

0446691437|4.0|This 165 page book, with its short essays and abundant white space, is indeed an easy read.  And, it's filled with inspiration. <br /> <br />Mr. Pressfield, in his easy style, presents dozens of short, narrative bursts of creative ideals and ideas.  He shares his own experiences as author of The Legend of Bagger Vance and other works, what he's discovered about the power of the muse and the need to sit down each day and write.  These ideas are offered up in 50-250 word vignettes and essays, each dedicated to understanding and overcoming the creative blocks that keep us from achieving our daily and lifetime goals and dreams.  What Mr. Pressfield does, is share his artistic philosophy. <br /> <br />The book is divided into three sections:  Resistance (Defining the Enemy), Combating Resistance (Turning Pro), and Beyond Resistance (Higher Realm).  Each section is filled with short descriptions and digestible ideas.  This is one of those books that can be read cover to cover, or randomly opened for a quick moment of inspiration. <br /> <br />If you've read other writer self-help or creative inspiration books, you'll notice glimmers of stuff you've read or stuff you already know.  But, Mr. Pressfield's invocation of the muses and light connections to Roman myth added a nice layer, as do his selection of inspirational quotes from the likes of the Dali Lama, modern film, and the ancients. <br /> <br />There were some concepts that Mr. Pressfield shared that I'll admit I didn't agree with, but I'm not going to share those with you.  After all, we all develop out own life philosophies.  What I found interesting is that, while I didn't agree with him on every point, I also kept reading.  This gut reaction to keep going and trust the words, even through a filter, is a good indication that his philosophical concepts are pretty solid: one of those agree to disagree moments. <br />

B000024D4R|5.0|Animals finds Pink Floyd after Dark Side and Wish You Were Here as true rock superstars. Thus this album finds Roger Waters detesting not only the band's status but the society that put them there in the first place.  <br /> <br />For me Dogs is the best track and it could quite possibly be the best Floyd song ever if not for the fact that it's about ten minutes too long. But Pink Floyd don't do anything by the book. The first seven minutes of Dogs is exceptional to say the least with the acoustic lead in and Dave Gilmour's soothing vocals offering what Pink Floyd do best. Waters lyrics strike a chord to this day making Dogs as relatable today as when this album was released. I'll be honest and say Waters part of the song is not even close to Gilmour's, vocally anyway, and that Gilmour should have covered the vocals for the whole song. <br /> <br />Sheep is also fantastic and the vocals by Waters lends itself to the fast and loud pace of the track. While not quite as graceful as Dogs, Sheep more then makes up for that with the fantastic climax with Floyd jamming for at least a good three minutes.  <br /> <br />Pigs (Three Different Kinds) is the weakest track on the album with a real cheesy feel to it. At times the song resembles a Beatles song but it's a true a cynics song and who better then to relate this then Waters himself. I didn't mind the length of Dogs or Sheep but I found myself wondering when this track would end. It's a solid track but is easily the least memorable on the album. <br /> <br />You start and finish with Pigs on the Wing offering the only glimmer of optimism with a soothing performance on both tracks by Waters. Had Gilmour been the main vocalist on Animals I feel this album would get more justice but alas this album served as the bridge to Pink Floyd's (or at least Waters) musical apex otherwise known as The Wall.
0393061310|4.0|The big question addressed in this book is why certain groups of people have been successful in conquering others.  The book's title suggests a partial answer, but the root cause, according to Jared Diamond, is geography.  In short, certain geographical conditions favored the development of farming, which in turn fostered the development of stable societies, large populations, better technology, and resistance to killer germs.  So the societies that were the first to develop farming conquered everybody else. <br /> <br />It's a neat hypothesis, but Diamond has taken a lot of heat for it.  As many others have pointed out, some of the critiques have been overtly or implicitly racist, suggesting a genetic basis for the superiority of one group over another.  Until someone comes up with some evidence for this ugly position, it's best to ignore it. <br /> <br />The other arguments boil down to religion and culture.  These aren't necessarily incorrect, but they beg the question.  One could just as easily ask why certain societies developed cultures or religions that enabled them to be more successful than others.  As Diamond correctly points out, geography has the advantage of being objective and open to scientific investigation. <br /> <br />The other problem with culture and religion is that they confuse cause and effect.  While it's true that religion inspires people to make certain choices, it's also true that people tend to invent religions that justify whatever they happen to be already doing.  Same goes for cultural traditions. <br /> <br />Diamond does have a tendency to overstate his case, and to speculate somewhat recklessly.  That's probably why people are annoyed with him, but I don't see that as a reason to dismiss the book's main message, which is extremely interesting.
B00005JNRY|5.0|Went to to World Premier of Cars last night at Lowe's Motor Speedway in Charlotte, NC.  GO SEE THIS MOVIE!  Disney/Pixar has once again produced a terrific animated film.  Race fans will love it and need to watch closely for the parallels to NASCAR.  Those of you who have been to the infield for a race at Charlotte will like the Redneck Hill reference.  The stars turned out for the premier and Disney donated $1 million dollars split between Paul Newman's Hole in the Wall Gang Camps and Speedway Charities, which includes Kyle Petty's Victory Junction Camp.  The characters in this film are loveable.  Paul Newman's 1951 Hudson Hornet is a small town judge and nobody in town knows about his checkered (flag) past.  Owen Wilson lends his voice to the main character Lightning McQueen.  Fans will fall in love with him.  Bonny Hunt is wonderful as the pretty Porche, Sally befriending Lighning in his journey through Radiator Springs.  John Ratzenberger again lends his talent to another supporting character in a Disney film. Don't leave before the credits to see additional work by John.  Tony Shaloub (Mr. Monk) plays Luiggi an Italian tire store owner and Ferrari lover.  Darrell Waltrip, Dale Earnhardt, Jr., and Michael Schumacher also make voice appearances in the film.  If you are a race fan you will love it.  If you are not, there are enough aspects of the film not revolving around racing for you to enjoy it.  Kids will love it and parents prepare for the onslaught of marketing that will have them wanting all things cars.  I willingly purchased 2 items today for my kids as I loved this wholesome family film.  GO SEE THE MOVIE!!!  I am eagerly awaiting the soundtrack.  Brad Paisley has 2 songs in the movie.  He played 3 songs at the Premier last night.  It's loaded with good music that young and old will enjoy.
B00005JOVH|4.0|I watched the previous two movies in the \\"X-men\\" series, but I almost didn't watch this one. The reason is simple: pretty much all the reviews I read said it was awful. I should have known better than to pay too much attention to them!<br /><br />I ended up going to watch \\"X-Men - The Last Stand\\" this morning, because my sister wanted to see it. I had a very welcomed surprise. This movie is probably the best in the series, at least so far. Of course, you shouldn't expect too much: this is a movie designed merely for entertainment purposes, and it is quite far from being a classic or anything similar to that. That having been said, it engages the audience easily, and it entertains.<br /><br />This movie doesn't pretend to be more than what it is: a blockbuster with lots of action and not too much character development. However, that is all right in my book, at least in some of the films I watch. Yes, \\"X-Men - The Last Stand\\" could have been better, but it is nonetheless a film you will probably like, specially if you are already a fan of the series.<br /><br />The inspiration for the plot is taken from the \\"X-men\\" comics, even though the story has been substantially modified. In a nutshell, a cure to treat mutations has been found, and mutants react differently to that discovery. The Brotherhood, a group of mutants whose leader is Magneto (Ian McKellen), plans to destroy the cure. The X-Men, led by Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), think that every mutant should be able to choose without pressures whether to remain one or not. In Prof. Charles Xavier's words \\"Since the dawn of existence, there have always been moments when the course of history shifted. Such a turning point is upon us now\\" (...) \\"I do not know if victory is possible. I only know that great sacrifice will be required. And because the fate of many will depend on a few, we must make the last stand\\".<br /><br />There is also a secondary plot: Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), an X-Men that died in the second film of the series in order to save her teammates, is reborn, but as someone different, more powerful, and much more dangerous. Jean is now her alterego, Phoenix, a force that cannot be controlled, and that might well wreak havoc on the world. But is there any way of saving her? And will Professor Xavier, Scott (James Marsden), Logan (Hugh Jackman) and Storm (Hally Berry) find it, before it is too late?<br /><br />On the whole, I think that you will like this film a lot, if you are already a fan of the series. It is more of the same, only a little better. In case you haven't watched the previous movies, give them a try before watching \\"X-Men - The Last Stand\\", because then you will understand better what is happening in this film. Of course, recommended :)<br /><br />Belen Alcat<br /><br />PS1: Don't leave the cinema as soon as the movie finishes, as there is a little and very surprising scene just after the credits finish rolling up. You will have to wait a few extra minutes, but believe me, it is worth it!<br /><br />PS2: There are new additions to the X-men, the most noteworthy being Beast, that is Dr. Hank Mcoy (played by Kelsey Grammer).second film of the series in order to save her teammates, is reborn, but as someone different, more powerful, and much more dangerous.

B00012FXAE|5.0|...Building Better Worlds. <br /> <br />This 1986 release from director James Cameron served as many things to many people. On one level, it was an allegory to the relatively recent (at the time) U.S. involvement in the Viet Nam war. Specifically: A well trained military fights an enemy it cannot see and doesn't understand. <br /> <br />For others, it was an indictment of corporate greed for profit at the expense of human lives. <br /> <br />For me, it was a good old fashioned suspense film that integrated Science Fiction and the military quite nicely. The result was a tight story that moved well, despite the fact that the theatrical version was over two hours long. It also featured a new twist in the casting of a woman (Sigourney Weaver) as the reluctant hero Ellen Ripley. Paul Reiser is completely convincing as the consumate company man, and we even get a cameo from \\"Jonesy\\" the cat from the first movie. <br /> <br />Excellent movie that won't dissapoint you and leave you drained from the suspense...

The same gentleman recommended the book to me, and within a week I read Ferrazzi's philosophy that the network is more about helping others than yourself.<br /><br />An easy read compared to most business books, and people looking to grow should look at as they do everything: a buffet. If there are parts you don't agree with, then don't use them, but implement the skills and techniques that you feel can be a benefit to your stage in life.
B00005JOVH|3.0|ok someone needs to bring brian singer back and that is all there is to it.  i can wholly blame brett ratner for this movie because i think that marvel is also largely to blame.  the plot is very un-xmen like.  the premise is believable but i dont think that it was an appropriate way to \\"end\\" the franchise.  the fight scene or last stand of the movie is the best part.  one thing i loved about this movie is the use of powers on display by all the mutants involved.  beast's acrobatics were cool, wolverine was same as usual, i liked that storm flew and actulally fried someone.  kitty displayed some nice moves, and iceman finally ices up.  pyro really shows his evil side and callisto was pretty cool.  the multiple man makes a great appearance in the movie also, i got a kick out of him.  JUGGERNAUT IS NOT A MUTANT!!!!  this is almost to the point of unacceptability.  althought i think that he had the best line in the movie.  colussus looked cool but very underdeveloped.  why did rogue have to take the cure, she has tried this in the past (comicwise anyway) and she has always gone in the opposite direction.  frustrating to say the least.  now the effects in the movie were pretty good.  the bridge scene is awesome.  what happened to cyclops?  where is he?  is he disintegrated?  i think that a fight with sentinels would have been a better movie.  just my opinion.  is this really the last team movie?  i hope not.  i did feel sorry for mystique in this one, just goes to show you how evil magneto is.  but it may look like the effects are only temporary.  so who knows what is going to happen.  also dont kill everyone in the movie, it may make for drama but that does not mean that the drama is good for the movie.  this is my rant and i am sticking to it.  i am frustrated because i am a loyal fan of the xmen and have thought that the last two xmen movies rank at the top of all time comic movies.  this one does not.  they messed with the system and they are messing with the core audience of the book.  i am aware that this is a movie and not the book, but those who make the movies should always remember that those who read the books are going to be the majority that see the movie.  i am an xmen purist and proud of it, i would just like to see respect given to the history of the book and what it stands for.  by the way stay till the end of the credits, apparently there is a scene at the end.
0307276902|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who know's anyone that is in a bad situation, this book demonstrates that in every cloud there is a silver lining. It also makes you aware of what drugs and alcohol do to you not only physically but emotionally.
B0006A9FMI|5.0|Well, i just wanted to say, that the fact that the movie doesn`t have an english audio doesn`t mean the movie is Bad, most of the comments here are like \\"i am not going to read a movie\\" or \\"i am not japanese\\" but think about it.., the movie was made in Japan, what you were specting? well yes, Dream Work could work a little more like \\"special features\\" or the audio stuff (then i should blame it cause they don`t work in the spanish version) but for that the movie is no bad, and for the ones that says \\"they should say that the movie haven`t audio english\\" well.., read better, cause in the \\"details\\" says that the audio its only japanese..,  <br /> <br />If you are not ok, reading, then you can wait another version, or just enjoy it, i really don`t think that you buy a dvd to watch it just 1 time, if that is the case, then go and rent it..,  <br />Overall, its a nice movie, have some animation like Final Fantasy's movie,  <br /> <br />Its hard to read those comments of people calling him/her self BIG FAN and they are just giving bad reviews just cause they don`t want to read.., :S:S that`s a shame..,
B00000889A|5.0|Page and Plant could have easily released this under the Led Zeppelin name, and it would have come off as a lot more satisfying and legitimate than a lot of \\"reunion\\" projects from dinosaur bands of the 60s and 70s. Nevertheless, I'm glad they didn't, both because Jonesy wasn't involved and because it shows their willingness to let the music stand on its own, millions of other copies this would have sold had they simply printed \\"Led Zeppelin\\" on it somewhere be damned. Tracks like \\"When The World Was Young\\" and \\"Most High\\" can hang with pretty much any Zeppelin material, and the whole album is a great listen. Highly recommended, especially if you've got all of Zeppelin's stuff and wish there were more.
B000F4RHB6|5.0|I've been a fan of Huey Lewis and the News since I was in my teens.  They are still such a great band.  While I have a few of their cd's, I wanted this one so ALL of my favourite songs of theirs are on one cd. <br />To me there are heaps of standout songs, but my favourite one by far is If This Is It.  I also really love Stuck With You, I Want A New Drug and Hip To Be Square.   These guys still have it going on and there are some great jams here.  If you are a fan of them already, you'll love this cd; if you don't know a lot of their music, then this is a great place to learn.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|Growing up in a Catholic family, I have always been taught that homosexuality is evil, and even when I started my own family, I always passed this idea down to my children. <br /> <br />So imagine the shock I endured when my wife bought, not rented, Brokeback Mountain home for family movie night. <br /> <br />I watched nevertheless, to show that I do keep an open mind about the subject. But by the end of the film, even I had tears in my eyes. I believe that books and movies on romance now should not categorize Homosexuality to its own category, but as \\"Romance\\" where they are suppose to belong <br /> <br />This film changes you, and after watching it, you will never be the same person again.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|In addition to its keenly observed portrait of two men in love, who live in perpetual fear of discovery and reprisal, the multi-leveled \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is a searing comment on a society that forces its non-mainstream inhabitants to conceal their identities from both outward prying eyes and, inevitably, from themselves. The tragic consequences of this loss of a sense of one's true self are what drives the ultimate sadness and unhappiness of the characters and leads them to their respective fates.    It is an overwhelming passion and intense love that propels Ennis and Jack, the protagonists of the film, to defy societal convention and see each other in secret. \\"This thing grabs hold of us...it has no reins,\\" says Ennis. Although Ennis deeply senses that the uncontrollable urges he feels are a true and real form of love, he cannot reconcile what he feels with what he has been taught since childhood, and that has been grilled into him by an unkind, unforgiving world. Images of gay men being attacked and ridiculed constantly inhabit his thoughts. As the clandestine relationship progresses, Ennis becomes more bewildered and lost, so that by the end of the film he has accused Jack of being responsible for his feeling like \\"nobody and nowhere\\". He has lost any true sense of who he is, and helplessly straddles between the gay and straight worlds. He is unhappy and unfulfilled in both places. Although Jack remains closeted, he has a keener sense of himself, and has successfully erected a wall between himself and the negative opinions of others. He is willing to take risks in order to be happy, but his overpowering love for Ennis forces him to conceal his true self and seals, ultimately, his fate.    At first I had conflicting feelings about the film. While overwhelmed and impressed by its incisive, understated screenplay, skillful, heartfelt performances, spectacular vistas, and precision like directing, I could not stem the feelings of anger rising up in me. Do we needanother film where gay men are unhappy, unfulfilled and alone?  Do symbols like lovers' shirts or possessions have to substitute for the real thing?  I ultimately decided, however, to view this film as a depiction of, and a comment on, a particular time and place in history, and to admire its fierce courage in depicting passion between two men with insight and sensitivity. The sadness of the outcome does not diminish the beauty of the love between these two fellow human beings. It is a love that lingers in one's memory, and stabs at one's heart.
B000002J2B|5.0|In contrast with the somewhat softer and more acoustic A Trick of the Tail album, this late 1976 album is a lot moodier and features more in the way of instrumental pieces.  Sadly, this would be Steve Hackett's last studio album with the band, although he would go on to a prolific solo career.  It is worth noting however, that some of his finest recorded performances with Genesis are on this album.<br /><br />As a huge Tony Banks fan, I feel compelled to point out that he contributed most of the material on this album including the excellent One for the Vine.  He also pulled out the stops in the keyboard department and plays a total of seven types of keyboards.  As a result, the music is very synth-heavy, which lends a deeply atmospheric feel to the whole album.  Steve's haunting work on the nylon string classical is also very impressive and contributes a great deal to the music.<br /><br />The tracks on the album include some classic Genesis compositions including Eleventh Earl of Mar and One for the Vine, several instrumentals that feature the band's unique interpretation of American jazz-rock fusion (and Phil's superior technique on the drums) (Wot Gorilla?, Unquiet Slumbers for the Sleepers..., and ...In that Quiet Earth), and all around good song writing (Blood on the Rooftops and Afterglow).  In my opinion, the only weak track is Your Own Special Way, which is a Mike Rutherford composition.  The track is weak in large part because the arrangement is poor - in fact, Mike has admitted as much in interviews.<br /><br />The 1994 remastered version of Wind and Wuthering does recreate the original cover art and record jacket theme along with the lyrics.  I feel that the sound quality is OK.  Although Rhino has recently remastered this album (in 2007) it is a bit expensive. Moreover, some folks have commented on the severe compression used on the 2007 remaster of Wind and Wuthering.<br /><br />All in all, this is the last Genesis album that featured the classic elements of British progressive rock, although the band still had a great deal to say right up until 1980 with the superb Duke album.  Wind and Wuthering is highly recommended along with Nursery Cryme (1971), Foxtrot (1972), Selling England by the Pound (1973), The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway (1974), and A Trick of the Tail (1976).rock, although the band still had a great deal to say right up until 1980 with the superb Duke album.

B000056IKS|5.0|This 1971 album is an excellent example of music that was coming out of the experimental rock scene in Germany during the early 1970s.  Neu! was largely the product of a collaboration between Mike Rother (guitars/bass guitar) and Klaus Dinger (drums/percussion), with Conrad Plank as the engineer/partial producer.  My own opinion of the album is that it is the finest that Neu released, although \\"75\\" is pretty good too.<br /><br />With the exception of the last track, which features some slightly off-key and hoarse whispering/singing, the six tracks on the album are instrumental and range in length from 4'50\\" to 10'07\\", with most tracks in the 4 - 7 minute range.  The album is at times hypnotic and nearly trancelike, with a pulsating and insistent drum part atop which very spacey guitar parts weave in and out.  There are experimental tracks too, that present \\"found sounds\\" (everything from human voices to jackhammers, and a shouting audience) and eerie effects generated on electric guitars.  This is (to my ears at any rate) indicative of a 1968 - 1969 Pink Floyd influence. In fact, I would even go so far to say that these guys were also somewhat influenced by American minimalist composers such as Terry Riley - their music is similarly very rhythmically charged with subtle permutations in a given musical theme.  Although I love the whole album, my favorite track is Negativland, which is pretty heavy.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very atmospheric and experimental album and is very highly recommended along with \\"Neu 75\\" (1975).
0062502182|5.0|This is a common theme these days. Do not fear what you are capable of, in fact you should embrace it. The Alchemist takes complex concepts and breaks them down to the simplest emotions one can experience. This book can be read in about 4-6 hours because it captures the imagination and grasps the reader with hopes of answering eternal questions. To every reader I would imagine that the answer was provided in some way shape or form. Personally, I would challenge anyone to read this book and not break through the shell created by current events, the state of the union, the quiet before the storm, etc;  <br /> <br />This is truly a special book. It enables one to spend time with themselves in a time where time is more precious than whatever one perceives as valuable.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|I can't remember any other movie affected me like Brokeback Mountain did. I watched it twice and read the original short story by Annie Proulx several times. And I never before watched any other movie twice. It's been more than one week since I first watched it and I just can't get it off my mind.     Yes, like some people said it's a gay cowboy love story; but more than that it is about pure and unconditional love between two human beings. When watched the movie I forgot both Jack and Ennis are men, mesmerzied by their deeply charged feeling for each other and felt sorrw for the tragic depressing life they lived. Under the directing of Ang Lee actors Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal put their whole feelings and minds into these charaters to create unforgetable images of two people in love. When Ennis held the blood-stained shirts to his chest and inhaled it deeply and murmured:'Jack, I swear..., I couldn't hold my tears any more. No other movie moved my so much.     I think Brokeback Mountain really is a cultural watershed consider so many Holywood movies nowadays are full of violence, criminal acts, sex, lust, car chasings, guns... Brokeback Mountain is so refreshing and unique no wonder it has received so many rewards and tons of rave reviews.     Of course like it says no such things as perfect, same for Brokeback Mountain. I feel little regrets that some details in the short story, which actually are very important to show the sparkling feeling beween Jake and Ennis, are not showing in the movie: When Ennis lead Jake to his home and meet his wife first time they see each other in four years they hardly can control their feelings. In the original story:'\\"You got a kid?\\" said Jack, His shaking hand grazed Ennis's hand, electrical current snapped between them.'... Another one:'From the vibration of the floorboard on which they both stood Ennis could feel how hard Jack was shaking.' I guess probably it is very diffcult for the actors to express such subtle movements. Or I didn't notice it?    I read a lot of reviews about Brokeback Mountain and found many different opinions such as 'love beween gay people,' 'social prejudice against gay people,' 'wives and children are victims,' I think these opinions are not wrong at all.     But after all, as the director Ang Lee pointed out, it is simple about love.
1593083246|4.0|This is a most amusing and entertaining love story which has ever written that shows human limitations at its best. The title of the book is indeed well-named for pride and prejudice are the essence of the whole book.  Pride of the hero Mr. Darcy and prejudice of the heroine Elizabeth Bennet combined to reveal what kind of character a person can be, regardless of his/her financial situation and social stature.<br /><br /> British society under the Regency rule was exemplified and made explicit to generations of readers.  The author was telling us about the everyday life of people living in rural England after the Napoleonic Wars, and Britain was on its way to become a maritime power in the 19th century.  The Industrial Revolution of Charles Dickens' days had not yet arrived to upset the power of the English nobility and the landed gentry, so much so that gentlemen like Mr. Darcy, a landowner of vast estates, could live a life of luxury and self-importance, and could easily look down on the less fortunate who had to work for a living.<br /><br /> Reading Jane Austen's work is always a pleasure.  It puts me in with the characters, as if I were an unseen and unknown observer in the room! In fact, I feel that I am living in the early 1800s, doing the same things that those characters are doing, and feeling just as they are feeling.
B000063V8R|5.0|The Star Trek Collection is a worthy hobby and certainly the largest of the television series DVD Collections (The Original Series, The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, Voyager and Enterprise). At around 1100 minutes per box (a few hours less than the TOS seasons) we are still looking at approx 30 boxes with 700 hours of viewing. That is 1 month of non-stop Star Trek. No DVD series comes remotely close to that. Get going collecting right now and build up on each succession over the years. By the end you will have a very serious anthology that defines the word awe. This is the kind of item that requires 1 hour a day of your time for the next few years. It is a cherished memory that served your fathers and will serve your children also. Our very planet, Earth, has advanced because of Gene Roddenberry's admirable concept. Roddenberry nailed the premise of the series when he said that he wanted to create a show with characters that we could look up too. `The Bridge' members are like our family. Watch what they do. Then go and spend your life striving for the same on Earth. What engineer, medic, scientist, teacher, worker can not say that Star Trek has not influenced them? The show is this significant in the development of our species. Even Christians respect and quote its authority and it is not hard to see why. The DVD case is not quite as fancy as the TOS (The Original Series) cases. The TNG case is supposed to resemble a TNG crew briefcase. The case opens to reveal the disc booklet inside a sleeve. Sliding the disc booklet out of the sleeve and flipping it open reveals a spread of 7 discs. There are 4 episodes per disc. However the last disc, disc 7, only has two episodes, for a grand total of 26 episodes (TOS has 8 Discs, 30 episodes). The rest of disc 7 is devoted to Star Trek interviews and trailers with the usual expected extras...and then some more. The episodes are ordered not in the sequence they where filmed, but in the sequence that they aired, however each episode has been numbered according to the order they where filmed in. This means on one disc you have shows 4, 2, 12 and 1, in that order although Season Three was aired fairly much according to the chronological produced order except for episode one and two which are switched around. The sound has also been remastered to 5:1 Dolby Digital! Since the show was shot in full frame, these dimensions are retained.<br /><br />Star Trek, The Next Generation (TNG), Season Two continued with the amazing impact TNG had when it was first broadcast but made it more Enterprise based with less beaming down than Season One. Season Three corrects this somewhat critical tilt with Season Two by reintroducing us to lots of planet based exploration stories... and good ones at that too. Season Three has a whole new opening sequence to improve on the first computer generated images of our solar system as Captain Picard utters the immortal words... `To baldly'... I mean... `To boldly go where no man'... I mean... `To boldly go where no one has gone before.'  It was the dawn of the 90s and since CGI had undergone some development, the improvements can be seen not only in the new opening sequence, but with better looking planets (complete with moving gaseous atmospheres) and major enhancements in particle effects. Towards the end it undergoes new model development, lighting and subspace effects of a movie budget look. The crew uniform has changed with a new type of collar. Most of the main characters from Season Two are here, Captain Jean-Luc Picard, Commander William T. Riker (now with a bigger belly), Lieutenant Commander Geordi La Forge, Lieutenant Commander Worf (letting his hair grow even more), Commander Deanna Troi (with more makeup, costume changes and even an aerobics outfit [that really isn't as good as it sounds]), Lieutenant Commander Data and Ensign Wesley Crusher (new hairdo). Dr. Beverly Crusher is back (initially with a terrible hairdo that gets better) and Doctor Katherine Pulaski has been dropped from the show never to reappear again. Pulaski's disappearance is not officially explained (in reality Diana Muldaur was told her character was not working and she was offered a role in L.A. Law instead. McFadden was asked to rejoin the series again) the crew do act like she has just left because her time was up with Dr. Crusher making reference to Pulaski's work in Episode four. Commander Lieutenant Tasha Yar makes a surprise guest appearance for one episode! Dwight Schultz (Murdoch from the A-Team) makes his first appearance as Lieutenant `Reg' Barkley, who would have a reoccurring role. Colm Meaney is here again as Miles Edward O'Brien, Navigation, doesn't have much of a role boost since Season Two, while the Whoopi Goldberg's Guinan character of the wise El Aurian, the bartender in 10 Forward, has her background further developed. Season Three of TNG is mostly about nanotechnology, colonization, super aliens, the prime directive, orphans, ancient space booby traps, Romulans, wormholes, peace negotiations, defectors, super humans, terrorism, Q, court inquisitions, parallel universes, AI, Klingon high councils, captivity experiments, time travellers, biological space crafts, morale, the first law of robotics, Vulcans, Sarek, evolutionary speciation, and the Borg. Unlike Season Two there is much more planetary exploration and lots of alien encounters. There are loads of unforgettable episodes in this Season, \\"Evolution\\" where nanotechnology takes over the Enterprise, \\"The Survivors\\" is a mystery about a single household that is the only structure to survive an alien invasion on a whole planet, \\"Who Watches The Watchers?\\" is about the prime directive failing when the Enterprise team are spotted and kidnapped, \\"Offspring\\" sees Data creating another sentient android, \\"Sins of the Father\\" has Worf return to his Klingon homeworld to defend his family honour, \\"Hollow Pursuits\\" has Lt. Barkley fantasizing about crew members in the Holodeck, \\"Sarek\\" is about the Vulcan of the same name from Star Trek: The Original Series, who is back for what looks like his final peace negotiation, and of course the pot-boiler end episode of \\"The Best of Both Worlds, Part I\\" (widely acclaimed as one of the best Star Trek episodes ever!) marks the grand entrance of Locutus of Borg onto the scene. The bottom line for TNG: Season Three is that it is often cited by fans as the best TNG Season and is probably the first of the Seasons to really be worth the price tag demanded of these very expensive box sets. In Season Three everyone seems to have matured, included the writers who are giving us exactly what we want and the series has a serious enough budget to make every episode look like a movie, especially towards the end. There is lots in this season to enjoy and of course not since J.R. Ewing had been shot did we get the kind of cliff-hanger episode that \\"The Best of Both Worlds, Part I\\" would deliver on, meaning every Trekie (and who wasn't at this time) across the planet from LA to Hong Kong had to wait all summer to learn how Picard could be saved.

B00005JLR2|5.0|I'm not in the habit of reviewing movies, but I'm making an exception for this one because my kids love this movie, and it is my favorite Disney outing to date (though I also enjoyed Tron, Dinosaur, and almost anything from Pixar).  This fast-paced, re-imagined version of Robert Louis Stevenson's classic story is watchable for many reasons, but I enjoyed the great voice acting, the Brandywine School inspired backgrounds, and the interesting hybridization of futuristic elements with 18th century technology (I'm glad Disney didn't play it straight with this one). <br />BONUS: The most artful combined usage of traditional and CG animation to date!   <br />Two pieces of music contributed by John Rzeznik of The Goo Goo Dolls make a great soundtrack greater. <br /> <br />
0385512058|4.0|Keith Ferrazi's book \\"Never Eat Alone\\" reveals much about his process for meeting VIP's and establishing influential relationships. As some of the reviewers on Amazon.com note, it's easy to become a bit frustrated with some of his terminology such as \\"conference commando' and an emphasis on what might come off as 'aggressive networking' in this day of pull versus push marketing. I'd be fascinated to see what the MYspace generation thinks of this book and his philosophy. Social networking has progressed tremendously in the past year...Ferrazi mentions a few of the online social networking sites like Linked In and Friendster but he really doesn't give any top hints on how to employ these online networks into your 'relationship-making'. Chapter 21 (the last chapter talks about On the book jacket it notes that Ferazzi's form of connecting to the world around him is based on generosity, helping friends connect with other friends. Yet the book doesn't really talk about the opportunities for meeting people through charitable work -- being on boards, going out for a weekend to build a Habitat for Humanity House-- all are great ways to get involved, meet new people and hammer nails side by side with what may be a Fortune 500 CEO or even an out-of-work webmaster who may be your next employee in your small design company. The emphasis on VIPs and CEO's and IMPORTANT people is a bit much for me. I've found that you don't have to go to coffee or go to lunch with someone important to harness the power of other people to help change your life for the best. I got into grad school in film at USC on recommendation of a screenwriter I met at Bagel Nosh in Beverly Hills sitting at the lunch counter by myself. Traveling alone to Europe or China, I've made not only some of my best friends but invaluable business contacts. Ferrazzi's chapters about getting past the gatekeeper and warming the cold call are welcome additions to your business tool-kit. The chapter on Pinging all the time sounds like it could get you deleted from even your best pal's Buddy list. There is no doubt we have gone long beyond the 80's and 90's networking events where you shake hands, clink glasses and exchange cards. Read the book for it's great ideas, don't think of it as a rulebook for next-gen relationship-making though. A client of mine once came into my office with a very large suitcase (the kind you take on the Queen Mary for a 4-week cruise). And then he opened it up to show me all the business cards he had collected in the past few years. On many he had even written notes on who he had called and where he had met them. BUT he had no database, no real ambassadors or great business colleagues who he could turn to at a very tough crossroads in his life. Would have been great to see info about database software and email newsletter systems included. What surprised me most of all is that Ferrazzi makes no real effort to 'connect' with his readers. He does include an email address nor does he have site that lets readers connect with other readers which would have been a terrific public service. BUT he does reveal his pattern for high level networking which combined with good listening skills and a strong sense of making the world better for everyone. Along the way don't forget that random acts of kindness may pay off far beyond that VIP Ivory Tower meeting you're yearning for. There's a story that goes around Hollywood every few years about how a young screenwriter who wanted to meet Spielberg tried every method possible --writing and calling all of his father's influential contacts in Hollywood. Nothing worked. Then one day he went to the dentist and chatted in the waiting room with a friendly older gal --who turned out to be Speilberg's mom. I wish that Keith Ferrazzi would have included this kind of story in his book....where just being nice, smiling and talking to the people we meet every day pays off --not just in contacts but in a sense of truly being connected to the world out there beyond our computers and email and blogs and instant messaging. Turn off your phone, take off your watch and talk to a few people this weekend--who knows you might make a new pal or meet someone that YOU can help reach their dream. And go ahead eat alone-- just don't forget to chat with the waiter/waitress, busboy and the guy next to you.

B000FQJAIW|1.0|Greetings fellow fans,    First, I would like to apologize for the miscommunication regarding the inclusion of the original theatrical films on these DVDs.  Seems somebody at LucasFilm jumped the gun and decided to release these as bonus material.  I want to assure you that I had NO INTENTION WHATSOEVER to make these versions publicly available again.  Honest.  Also, I would like to apologize for the Special Editions but see, my ex-wife Marcia was taking me to the cleaners so I had to make some changes for legal reasons so I wouldn't have to divvy up half the Ranch just to get her off my back.  That is the reason why I will never let the original films out of the vault again.  I swear.    Oh, one other thing, I have just built a new complex for ILM at the Presidio and I just got the bill and it seems I'm a little short on cash so if you could all be so kind and buy these cheapo DVDs for me just one more time, I'd really appreciate it!      MTFBWY!
B000EHRVPQ|4.0|In his treatise on horror, \\"Danse Macabre,\\" Stephen King establishes the genre exists on three more or less separate levels with \\"terror on top, horror below it, and lowest of all, the gag relex of revulsion.\\" In the wake of \\"Saw,\\" and with \\"Wolf Creek\\" and now \\"Hostel,\\" it seems clear to me that we are in the heyday of the low card in that particular set. The goal is to make the weak flee the room, before or after they throw up, and to make the strong put their hands over their eyes, but still sneak a peak through their fingers.<br /><br />\\"Hostel\\" is what writer-director Eli Roth did with the freedom Lion Gates Film gave him after his success with \\"Cabin Fever.\\" As you probably know, hostels, usually called youth hostels, are what young people use when they are backpacking around Europe. As you can easily anticipate, \\"hostel\\" is real close to \\"hostile,\\" so you can easily anticipate that this is going to be about one of those places where kids check in, but they do not check out. Paxton (Jay Hernandez), Josh (Derek Richardson), and Oli (Eythor Gudjonsson) are backpacking across Europe, but have only made it as far as Amsterdam and are only having a good time and not a great time. Then they are told about a hostel near Bratislava in Slovakia where women will have sex with any guy with an American accent. Since Paxton and Josh are from the United States, they immediately head for Bratislava so they can have sex.<br /><br />Now, at this point the idea that the three are going to die horrible deaths sounds like a good thing, because we are talking two Ugly Americans and a freak from Iceland. These people are asking for it and the only fly in the ointment is that Roth delivers on the horrible deaths to the point that we are forced to admit that even these people do not deserve what happens to them. \\"Hostel\\" really has two distinct halves, with the European sex trip that opens the film giving way to the giant torture sequences. Roth even toys with his audience, relying on a combination of suggestions and screams to get you squirming, not to mention thinking that maybe you are not going to really see the gross stuff, and then he starts showing you the gross stuff. At this point no not feel terror, forget about feeling horror, and just go right for the revulsion.<br /><br />Even though it really takes too long to get to the blood and gore, and even though the film ends up taking its foot off the pedal at the end, I rounded up on \\"Hostel\\" for one reasons. That was because when I got to the point where both I as a viewer and the last character standing were wondering what the hell was going on, Roth came up with an answer that rather that surprised me (\\"Hostel\\" is actually inspired by soemthing that really happens, albeit in the Far East rather than Eastern Europe). I even felt more horror than revlusion as well.<br /><br />In terms of the current crop of revulsion films, there is s more blood and gore in \\"Hostel\\" than in either \\"Saw\\" or \\"Wolf Creek,\\" but that is due in part to the fact the cast of this movie is several time larger. The other key distinction is that while \\"Hostel\\" obviously is set up for a sequel, which Roth is working on this year, it is really the only one of these films to offer any sort of catharsis in the end. That actually works against this type of film, and you might be surprised that \\"Hostel\\" is the most lighthearted of the three. So \\"Saw II\\" has the best squirming scene with the pit o' hypodermics, \\"Wolf Creek\\" will leave you the most empty, and \\"Hostel\\" will give you the most blood and laughs. Do not say you were not warned.ying on a combination of suggestions and screams to get you squirming, not to mention thinking that maybe you are not going to really see the gross stuff, and then he starts showing you the gross stuff.

B000E1ZBGS|4.0|This is a most amusing and entertaining love story which has ever written that shows human limitations at its best. The title of the book is indeed well-named for pride and prejudice are the essence of the whole book.  Pride of the hero Mr. Darcy and prejudice of the heroine Elizabeth Bennet combined to reveal what kind of character a person can be, regardless of his/her financial situation and social stature. <br /> British society under the Regency rule was exemplified and made explicit to generations of readers.  The author was telling us about the everyday life of people living in rural England after the Napoleonic Wars, and Britain was on its way to become a maritime power in the 19th century.  The Industrial Revolution of Charles Dickens' days had not yet arrived to upset the power of the English nobility and the landed gentry, so much so that gentlemen like Mr. Darcy, a landowner of vast estates, could live a life of luxury and self-importance, and could easily look down on the less fortunate who had to work for a living. <br /> Reading Jane Austen's work is always a pleasure.  It puts me in with the characters, as if I were an unseen and unknown observer in the room! In fact, I feel that I am living in the early 1800s, doing the same things that those characters are doing, and feeling just as they are feeling. <br />
B00000DR5I|5.0|I have had both Pheadra and Rubycon since they first came out on imported LP's!. When they finally released them on CD I bought 2 copies of each title!. This is experimental or if you prefer advant-garde music at its best. I have most of Tangerine Dream's CD's and even saw them live at Radio City. I can tell you Rubycon and Pheadra are thier best works. When I really want to get away from it all, this is the music I listen to. Only early Steve Roach (Structures From Silence)comes close.
B000F4PD7G|5.0|A film beyond any other film I have seen recently, it is a masterpiece of restraint, skill, authenticity, beauty and storytelling. It retells the most ancient text of the English language. <br /> <br />Beowulf and Grendel is not an adaptation but an interpretation of the original text. It is overflowing with beauty and a deep respect for the 1500-year old piece of skaldic poetry. Every image is a work of art and the screenplay respects the original epic, whilst allowing some artistic license. <br /> <br />Unlike the saga, it takes a neutral stance on the tale and demonstrates how a culture of violence and revenge is inevitably doomed. <br /> <br />Where this film differs greatly from the \\"original\\" is in its Christian content. Naturally, it is difficult to talk about Christian content in Beowulf since it is a pre-Christian text. The themes contained in the medieval text are of pagan origin: kinship, revenge, the acquisition of wealth, honour and death in battle, etc. As the roots of the tale developed in Scandinavia, the story switched to written form. Naturally only the clergy could write, so the story took on a Christian twist. The film wants nothing to do with this, looking through the dogma and deep into its true pagan roots. <br /> <br />It would of course be unfair to say that it is purely a pagan story line since there is clearly a Christian element to it, the Celtic missionary, but he simply serves to demonstrate the underhanded methods used by the early Church to convert the \\"heathens\\". <br /> <br />If I was to nitpick, I would say that it would have been interesting to have the film in Gamle Dansk. Passion of the Christ did this for Aramaic, it would have been feasible to do it here. <br /> <br />With this weak criticism, I exhort you all to watch this.
B000A6T1JU|5.0|Walter Hill's 1979 cult classic still holds up all these years later.  The Warriors is one of those films that one just has to see to believe, and while this new director's cut adds comic book-ish frames between scenes that don't really add anything to the film, they don't distract from it either.  Based on a mythical story from Greek history about soldiers trapped behind enemy lines, the Warriors are a New York street gang wrongfully blamed for the murder of a charismatic gang leader who wanted to unite all the gangs of the city.  As they try to make their way back to Coney Island, they are trailed and hunted by every gang in the city, and some won't make it back alive.  Though in some spots the film hasn't aged entirely well, the Warriors still manages to pack a punch (literally) and remains one of the best cult films to come out of the late 70's.  The DVD itself features some nifty featurettes with looks back on the film by Hill and stars Michael Beck and James Remar (who played Swan and Ajax respectively) among others, and there's even a clip for the great video game by Rockstar, which is definitely recommended for anyone who is a fan of the film.
B000EYK4GW|5.0|For the first generation of Disney animated films the most emotional moment has been and will always be when Bambi's mother is shot.  Chandler Bing is correct, that all they did was \\"stop drawing the deer,\\" but that is why we talk about the magic of animation and movie making.  But the second most emotional film experience is the classic Disney collection has to be \\"Dumbo,\\" which also deals with the fear of being separated from your mother (albeit with a decidedly happier ending), but which deals as well with the pain of facing discrimination because of the way you look.  Consequently, this 1941 film has a couple of compelling universal themes.  Then you throw in some solid songs (including Disney does Dali with \\"Pink Elephants on Parade\\") and a colorful animated train to along with the cute title character and you have a real winner.  I assume I am preaching to the choir here, because it strikes me as silly to tell anybody what the story of \\"Dumbo\\" is about.  The question is whether you want to pick up this \\"Big Top Edition\\" DVD, which despite the price is only a single disc.<br /><br />\\"Dumbo\\" is only 64-minutes long, which RKO Radio Pictures thought was too short to release as an A picture, but then originally it was going to be a 30-minute featurette before it was expanded.  Along with \\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,\\"  \\"Dumbo\\" is the only classic Disney film to use water colored backgrounds, which were less expensive than the gouache and oils used for both \\"Pinocchio\\" and \\"Bambi.\\"  Since both \\"Pinocchio\\" and \\"Fantasia\\" were, believe it or not, failures at the box office initially and did not turn a profit until they were re-released.  \\"Dumbo\\" only cost $812,000 and by grossing over $2.5 million in its original release actually earned more than both \\"Pinocchio\\" and \\"Fantasia\\" combined in terms of their original grosses.  Ultimately the simplicity of both the story and the animation style contributed largely to the success of the film because it proved that a story is more important than creative animation (\\"Fantasia\\" did not have an overriding narrative) and that that the characters matter more than the backdrop (the rainstorm in \\"Bambi\\" might be the crowning achievement of the studio in terms of drawing, but it is not as meaningful as the looks on the faces of Mrs. Jumbo and her baby in this movie).  So this might be the shortest of the Disney animated features, but in its own way it remains one of the most important.<br /><br />There is almost a sense that the DVD extras threaten to overwhelm the simple little movie (notice you usually have to light up the magic feather to make selections).  There are a pair of Silly Symphonies that actually relate to the main feature, with 1936's \\"Elmer Elephant,\\" where we learn how you kiss if you have a trunk and what else big ears can be used besides flying, and 1934's \\"The Flying Mouse,\\" in which the original blue fairy grants a young mouse his wish about being able to fly (\\"I would like to be a bird, and go sailing through the sky\\").  There are a pair of sing alongs with \\"Look Out for Mr. Stork\\" and \\"Casey Junior\\" (but not \\"When I See an Elephant Fly\\"?).  There is a music video of Jim Brickman on piano and Kassie De Palva singing \\"Baby Mine\\" (replacing Michael Crawford from the 60th Anniversary Edition DVD of the film).  Adults can enjoy the audio commentary with animation historian John Canemaker, who details the history of the film and explains why it works.  After countless commentary tracks where actors are trying to remember what happened in the movie they are watching, it is great to hear somebody as well prepared as Canemaker, and if you want to know where you get your money's worth with this DVD, then I would say right here with what Canemaker provides.<br /><br />But that does not matter, because of the scene where Dumbo goes to visit his mother when she is locked up as a \\"Mad Elephant,\\" and their trunks touch, and she cradles her baby in her trunk, you simply have to cry.  They did not need \\"Baby Mine\\" being sung in the background.  You can make the argument that Dumbo is the triumph of the underdog, which does for little boys what the story of the Ugly Duckling does for little girls (we are talking culturally, going back centuries and not about contemporary gender issues).  Cinderella just has to become a princess to live happily ever after, but Dumbo has to win the respect of the other elephants by doing something and the important lesson is that he does not change his appearance.  The fact that Dumbo does not have to change makes it a valuable lesson for all youngsters.  The only educational downside here is that the magic flower is revealed to be a placebo, which is not exactly a card in the parental deck that you necessarily want the kiddies to understand at too young of an age.ve to cry.

B000001ESJ|5.0|Ok, I have 7 of Rush's albums (in the order purchased: Moving Pictures, 2112, Fly By Night, A Farewell to Kings, Vapor Trails,  Counterparts, Permanent Waves) and my personal favorite happens to be A Farewell to Kings.  It has so many cool sounds that send you into a surreal world of waves, like on Xanadu.  It sends you into the dark depths of a black hole in Cygnus X-1.  It gives you a look into the mideivel ages and a sweet rockin session on the title track.  It's got 3 shorter songs that are also a force to be reckoned with.  Closer to the Heart and Cinderella Man are memorable classics.  Madrigal is okay, but it could've been left out.    In short: if you like prog, BUY THIS ALBUM!!! If you're an interested Rush fan, BUY THIS ALBUM!!! If you're looking for your first, start with Permanent Waves or Moving Pictures.  Or take a gamble and go with this one or 2112.  Whatever your tastes are.  This album is a must-have for Rush fans or prog fans in general!    UPDATE: I now have far more than 7 albums. This may not quite be my favorite album of theirs anymore, but it is up there hanging around the #1 or #2 spot.
B000002G87|5.0|Many moons ago a jock buddy of mine lent me a cassette of this album-didn't care for it. Twelve years later, it's all I wanna listen to. Rippin' guitar, soulful playing, and oh, twangy as hell. This really puts the classic in classic rock. If you don't dig this, you are either an ignorant high school junior (as I was), or a hopeless fool who doesn't deserve your sense of hearing...I feel bad for deaf people, for they will never hear the majesty of this record. I never understood why Eddie Van Halen worshipped Clapton-now I do.
B00007LTIL|5.0|I am not a big fan of the Dead, but I would argue that everyone should have this Cd and \\"Workingman's Dead\\" in their collection. Both Cds are essential American Music.
B0000630BT|5.0|This is unlike other Priest albums - this album has got pounding complex drum playing, thunderous bass guitar, soaring guitar riffs and impressive guitar solos, and shrieking vocals and still has Judas Priest all over it. I love Judas Priests other albums as well but that's just either hard rock sounding or standard heavy metal, but his has got progressive speed metal to its credit. With Scott Travis as the new drummer, pounding and crashing drums fill the entire album and the guitars are faster and heavier than ever. One of my favorite Metal albums of all time.
B00005JOVH|5.0|Bryan Singer has abandoned the X Men to tackle Superman instead so Brett Ratner stepped in and took the helm. Ironically Rattner was once up for this year's Superman so it's funny that he and Singer have traded films in a manner of speaking. <br /> <br />Contrary to initial fears and rumors X3 is not trashy but has loads of action a good, solid storyline with all your favorite X Men back and a plot packed with some surprising turns of events. The basic story premise is that the government has found a way to eliminate in other words \\"cure\\" the mutant X gene thus eliminating mutants from society by turning them into regular human beings. Although humans and mutants have now learned to coexist this newly propagated cure is reason enough for Magneto (Ian McKellen) to mount an offensive and wage a war on humans in \\"a fury the world has never seen..\\" <br /> <br />Rattner has improved on the pacing which in my opinion was but the only fault of X2 keeping a steady balance between character exposition, action and humor. The production quality such as special effects, camera and sound mix is first rate; aside from the established cast Halle Berry, Famke Janssen, Hugh Jackman and Anna Paquin there are some new mutant entries Kelsey Grammar as \\"The Beast\\" aka secretary for mutant affairs, Vinnie Jones as \\"The Juggernaut\\" and Ellen Page as Kitty Pryde, a young girl who can walk through walls and serves as Rogue's rival love interest for Bobby. <br /> <br />The best acting, however, belongs to Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart and most of all to Sir Ian McKellen (Magneto). McKellen who happened to be the best part of this year's abysmal DaVinci Code is quite the scene stealer in X3 portraying a smart, calm yet lethal villain, who happens to come across quite sympathetic. <br /> <br />In a nutshell: finally a nice, solid good summer blockbuster - good entertainment! Can't wait for the DVD!
B00005JLWN|5.0|I first discovered this movie about a year and a half ago. A freind lent it to me with a promise that it was better than \\"The Matrix.\\" Skeptical, I began to casually watch it as I did some work. After about five minutes, I left my work on the desk and became totally immersed in the movie. Christian Bale sells the story as Cleric John Preson, a futuristic law enforcer who ends up missing his dose of Prozium, a drug that deadens emotion. Once he begins to feel, he chooses to fight back against the government to liberate the people. Director Kurt Wimmer is probably better known now for the awful \\"Ultraviolet.\\" Rest assured, that movie has little in common with this underrated gem, whose limited theatrical release in America was sorely undeserved.
B0006399FS|5.0|I'm not sure I fully grasp the negativity vented against this album by many reviewers here other than, I suspect, that there are people who simply resent the fact that Bono uses his fame to promote causes other than himself.  Heaven knows we need someone like that in an age in which people like Britney Spears, The Simpson sisters, and Paris Hilton manage to coast to mounds of overexposure and publicity on the merits of little discernable accomplishment. <br /> <br />As for this particular U2 album it is probably the most spiritually steeped of them since \\"The Joshua Tree\\" nearly 20 years ago and it finds the band continuing the artistic renaissance begun with its previous album \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind.\\"  After the unfocused \\"Pop\\" and one off experimental \\"Zooropa\\" (each of which had their moments, but failed to achieve and overall impact) this is reassuring.  Songs like \\"Vertigo,\\" and \\"All Because of You\\" hearken back to the big, powerful guitar sound that shaped the feel of albums like \\"War,\\" and tracks like \\"Crumbs From Your Table,\\" \\"City of Blinding Lights\\" and \\"Love or Peace or Else\\" build on that sound and bring it full circle. <br /> <br />So, if you haven't found this album yet and are wary given the somewhat mixed reaction here take the plunge.  I think you'll find that people more apt for \\"American Idol\\" aren't really in the best position to review a U2 album anyway.
0684853523|5.0|Do you want to know how to write a book? Read this one.  You do not want to know how to write a book, still read this one.  Either way you will enjoy \\"On Writing.\\"  Even though the book is not an instruction manual on how to write and even though the book is not an autobiography of Stephen King, it is somewhat both at the same time.<br /><br />The advice, the hints and the basic steps he presents to the reader are helpful to the want-to-be writer as well as to those who do not have the slightest inclination to write, but like reading.  Both will learn that writing is not a \\"piece of cake.\\"  Even if you feel you have a gift on creativity and writing skills, there is more to it than the process of putting your creative thoughts and ideas on paper, and Stephen King shows you why.<br /><br />The book is not a \\"horror\\" story; the only horror the author presents in this narrative, is the many mistakes made by the want-to-be writers.<br /><br />In addition, Stephen King is crafty, witty and humorous.  You will be more than pleased and you will laugh and will not want to put the book down.<br /><br />I highly recommended this book to everyone.
B000002H33|5.0|Master Of Puppets is THE landmark in Heavy Metal history and most likely the greatest Thrash Metal piece ever. The band uses a more progressive formula that started in Ride The Lightning with more lengthier songs and more complex songwriting. The guitar work is brilliant - James Hetfields precise riffing and rhythm just pounds and chuggs, and Kirk Hammett's guitar soloing just cuts through metal smoothly and earns guitar honors, and those twin guitar riffs and solos are catchy! Lars Ulrich's drumming is more complex and pounding, and Cliff Burton's thunderous basslines can clearly be heard as this is probably Cliff at his greatest (listen to his little solo in \\"Orion\\"!) RIP Cliff Burton - the greatest bassist in heavy metal history. <br /> <br />1.) Battery - 10/10 Great way to start the album - starts off with acoustic guitars (like in \\"Fight Fire With Fire\\" off \\"ride The Lightning\\") then pounds into a thrash metal slaughter that deserves the title \\"Battery\\". Great solos and fills and HEADBANGING MOMENTS such as the ending. <br /> <br />2.) Master Of Puppets - 10/10 A well known favorite. Happens to be one of my favorites as well. This song shows great improvement of complex songwriting in lyrics and music that started to mature in Lightning. I love the twin guitars in the slow part and the solos! The lighting fast solo is also amazing. The riffs are favorite among many guitar players as well. <br /> <br />3.) The Thing That Should Not Be - 9/10 A song a bit slower that most of the other songs on the album. This song gets pretty repetitive after a while but there is complexity - the riffs and rhythms repeat but they are such parts that are long. The solo is fast, but I thought could be better, but it still shows Kirk's presence. <br /> <br />4.) Welcome Home (Sanitarium) - 10/10 Similar to \\"Fade To Black\\" and \\"One\\" (which are also track 4 songs on Justice and Lightning). Great intro solo and riffs - melodic and really fits to the mood of the song. Excellent guitarwork throughout - I love that fast wah-wah solo and the twin guitars and the ending!!  <br /> <br />5.) Disposable Heroes - 10/10 Great war song about the battle front and life and death. Long song, but the solo seems a bit short for the song but it still represents Metallica. That shout of \\"BACK TO THE FRONT\\" really makes me feel like a leader yelling at soldiers to FIGHT! <br /> <br />6.) Leper Messiah - 9.5/10 A little bit different feel from the other songs with some kind of groove to it. Rhythm's are simple in the verses, but when it speeds up then it kicks! Another classic Metallica song. Oh yeah, and a lightning guitar solo as well! <br /> <br />7.) Orion - 10/10 Excellent instrumental. Has its complexities of mid-tempo to slower tempo. In the slow parts, WITH CLIFFS GREAT BASS SOLO, I can really see how they called this song after the constallation \\"Orion\\" - the slow part is very relaxed, and spacey and makes you think of stars. Of course a great Metallica song can't be completed without some guitar solos!  <br /> <br />8.) Damage, Inc. 10/10 Great way to end the album - with a fast thrashy song that starts off calm then just destroys everything in its way. Probably the fastest song on the album and of course Kirk puts his touches with a fast guitar solo as well. <br /> <br />Master Of Puppets is my favorite Metallica album and is one of my top favorites of all time - probably my #1 favorite! I recommend all of Metallica's early albums - Kill 'Em All, Ride The Lightning, Master Of Puppets, and ...And Justice For All. The Black Album is alright but different - still ok check that out if you want.
B000FDEUFS|5.0|Forget about the fact that you have probably listened to this classic work a thousand times...you need this! <br /> <br />The 2nd disc is an absolute must-have- in fact, the version of \\"You Don't Love Me\\" that graces this new deluxe edition is worth the price of admission ALONE.  Duanne and Dickey create a sound that is nothing short of majestic- it literally gave me chills.  Add that the sound quality of the live set is fantastic, if you have any appreciation for the this great American band you should own this. Essential listening.
B0006GVJEE|5.0|\\"The Professional\\" is the thinking man's action flick. After seeing the original Americanized watered-down version, I was hooked. With the release of the uncut edition, many loose ends from the editied version are tied up. Perhaps the most compelling aspect is the inclusion of more of Leon's backstory, which helps audiences more closely relate to the hitman. I reccomend this version for anyone who enjoys a good action movie and can tolerate some violence and profanity. <br /> <br />As a side note, I bought this edition and had no problems with the video track--mine was mastered fine and worked properly, so I assume that the disc a customer made mention of on this site was part of a faulty batch of discs that was later corrected.
B00005JNQA|2.0|This is the type of movie that you need to see on DVD instead of the theater because it is hard to follow and you may need to re-watch earlier scenes several times to understand everything. <br /> <br />The beginning scene is pretty hard to watch because two guys are slaughtered by some kids.   You know that somehow this scene will have a bearing on the movie.  The next scene shifts to the UN and Silvia (Nicole Kidman), is working as an interpreter during a session.  There is an issue with one of the metal detectors not functioning so the security force shuts down the building until they can check that nothing has been snuck in (of course something was snuck in but we will only find out at the end).  For some strange reason Silvia needs to stay late (apparently to retrieve her flute) and hears a conversation in the seemingly empty conference hall.  Surprisingly it is in an African language which just happens to be her native tongue.  It implies an assassination attempt on the heard of her country (How does a woman with an Austrailian accent happen to be a native African?). <br /> <br />Sean Penn portraying a secret service agent is called in to investigate and initially does not believe Silvia.  As the story goes on we now that Penn is saddened by the recent death of his wife and Silvia, by the slaughter of her family in Africa.  Everything in this movie is not what it seems to be and anyone that might have seen The Manchurian Candidate can later figure out what will happen. <br /> <br />I found this movie very slow and disappointing.
B0002EXH5O|5.0|This album is filled with guitar solos - every song has got guitar/bass solos and the entire CD is a pure thrash metal piece that deserves to show off the fanciness of guitar playing by Marty Friedman and Dave Mustaine although Mustaine's solo style seems a bit repetitive and pure fast picking shred guitar but it sounds good for this kind of music. Holy Wars and Hangar 18 are my favorite guitar honors on this CD and I enjoy all of this CD.
B000FQJAIW|1.0|This dvd release, which is marketing the inclusion of the original theatrical versions of the films as the \\"big draw\\", falls so miserably short in terms of video quality by even the most basic industry standard in 2006, that it is a disgrace.    If you already own the special editions, steer clear of this blatant rip-off from LFL. There's no reason to buy these titles. The original versions will only look slightly better than VHS, and if you have a high-def tv, be prepared to break out your binocluars in order to watch these films in their correct, undistorted aspect ratios. Between the letterboxing AND the pillar boxing, so little of the screen will be dedicated to the picture that you won't even want to bother watching.    Shame on LFL., and shame on Lucas. They owe the fans and the films that made LFL possible, infinitely more respect.    Do Not Buy!
B0006L16N8|5.0|I'll be the first one to admit that I was somewhat disappointed the first time I listened to \\"X&Y\\", which was the very first day it was released. I had been a fan of the band since before \\"Parachutes\\" was released, and musically, this album was a massive departure from some of their previous tunes. Or so I thought. Once I listened and relistened to the tracks, the album soon became my favorite, and not just my favorite Coldplay album--my favorite album of all time. I know I must sound like a fanatic, but there are two very good reasons for that. 1). I am a fanatic, and 2). I have a good reason to be. Anyone who truly appreciates music will realize the complexity of these songs. Oh sure, on the surface the title song may seem simple (even the nonchalant chorus \\"You and me are floating on a tidal wave, together/You and me are drifting into outer space...\\" may seem overly basic), but if you actually take the time and listen to the music you begin to realize how complex it truly is. A great example is \\"Low\\": grab a pair of quality headphones and crank up the volume, and try to figure out just how many layers of sounds are in that song. It's absolutely unbelievable. I can't pick a favorite song because they are all favorites. The album is just that good.
B000AARKOO|4.0|Ridley Scott again shows his mettle and sure hand with action films full of the violent and spectacular scenes and melees that are his forte. Although most probably won't say this is a greater flick than his previous Blackhawk Down, I enjoyed it more, probably because of the historical connection to events present and past, and the film's story seems realistic enough so that it could have happened, and perhaps it did. All the performances were excellent, and I even thought Orlando Bloom did a decent job in his role, although up against competition like Neeson, Norton, Gleeson, and the guy who played Saladin (don't know his name, but he brought a convincing and studied intensity to the role), he has his work cut out for him.<br /><br />One minor correction, the major battle scene with what they called the ballistas are actually trebouchets. The ballistas are very large arbalests, or crossbows. To employ an overused word, the battle is truly awesome, and reminscent of the opening scene in Gladiator, but even better. It was still a couple of hundred years before gunpowder and canon came into use in the 1300s, and it wasn't uncommon to have battles in the Middle Ages where both sides were pounding each other with literally hundreds of catapults. So I thought that part was quite accurate and pretty interesting.<br /><br />Of course, with a current heart throb like Bloom in the lead role, there has to be a beautiful woman and a little romance thrown in, but this isn't allowed to sidetrack the main story as the tensions between Christian and Muslim forces build and finally erupt into at first sporadic raids and skirmishes, leading up to the final big battle with the siege of Jeruselam. Scott deftly unfolds the events and the action, controlling the pace of the movie with a sure hand, until the final climactic scene. Overall, another fine film from Scott and worth seeing on the big screen.<br /><br />By the way, a little Ridley Scott and movie trivia here, there are websites devoted to discussing the various film genres and I've seen the second Alien movie (Aliens) called the greatest action flick of all time. And this was by people weren't necessarily sci-fi fans. In fact, after seeing Kingdom of Heaven last night with a friend, the subject of Aliens came up as we were discussing Scott's other films, and my friend said that when he went to see it, the film broke and they had to stop and fix it. When they stopped the movie and turned on the lights, he said the whole audience heaved a collective sigh of relief at the opportunity to take a break from the intense, non-stop action. :-)e websites devoted to discussing the various film genres and I've seen the second Alien movie (Aliens) called the greatest action flick of all time.

B000002IKR|5.0|I love Thrash Metal, and Testament has to be one of the greatest bands in thrash along with Metallica, Slayer, and Megadeth. Chuck Billy's vocals kind of remind me of James Hetfield but with a more higher pitch, I dunno that's how I heard it. But this album is a thrash classic - enough said.
B000EDWL82|1.0|If I wanted to listen to Interpol-I would. So what if they're British. I'm Texan. How does this fact make these schmucks better than American bands creating that \\"brit-rock\\" sound? That's right it doesn't. Now I'm not defending bands like The Bravery or The Killers (I am defending Interpol) but at least these guys jumped on the band wagen at least two years ago. Where were the \\"Editors\\" in 2002? Still struggling? Interpol had their debut out way before the \\"Editors\\". Just because this Tom Smith putz has an accent people are flocking to him. Fine. Slap an accent on Paul Banks and call it a day. The fact is \\"Antics\\", Interpol's weakest album (but still freakin' brilliant) surpasses anything from \\"The Back Room\\".
B000AYQLX6|4.0|\\"Steel and Glass\\" was about Allen Klein who John was suing at the time.  He was John's former manager and he lost his mother when he was young (like John) and had a \\"New York walk and a New York talk.\\"  I really liked the song \\"Whatever gets you through the Night\\" which John didn't really like too much.  This is one of John's better post-Beatle albums.  Still, with all the drinking and drugs John took during this period, the album lacks the care and polish of his work with the Beatles.
B00005221M|4.0|I remember seeing the original version of Michael Mann's The Last of the Mohicans on TV and thinking afterwards: \\"Why do they have to take an otherwise decent period film based on a classic American tale and imbue it with popular sensibility, including a new age rock song at the end?  GAWD!\\"   Period films are a chance for one to be absorbed into another time; rock songs just don't cut it in this context!  (For the record, I like Clannad's music on its own.) This \\"director's expanded edition\\" eschews most of what I didn't like about that original version and held me enthralled to the end -- an end that certainly resonates more than previous.    The settings, period garb, and milieu are well-rendered with often striking cinematography.  Though shot in North Carolina, one can easily imagine being in colonial-era upstate New York traversing the Adirondacks, the north woods, and its wild waterways.  Not entirely accurate historically, the siege of Fort William Henry and its immediate aftermath was nonetheless depicted most adequately. One significant problem I had was that so much of the action at the fort and elsewhere was shot at night (or perhaps \\"day for night\\"); the constant darkness was off-putting. (I watched on my computer, which \\"may\\" have had something to do with this.)      Thankfully, the romantic angle between Nathan (Daniel Day-Lewis) and Cora Munro (Madeleine Stowe) was handled without excess sap (unlike in Braveheart!).  The stirring scene at the Huron settlement with Nathan, Cora, and Major Heyward held captive in the presence of the entire tribe including Magua and the tribe elder was also well-done, albeit in the typically melodramatic Hollywood manner.  Hand-to-hand combat was depicted with appropriate brutality, though it felt over-choreographed and cinematically embellished at times.  Chingachcook (Russell Means), the last of the Mohicans, exuded the necessary dignity and barely repressed emotion.  His soliloquy at the end with a spectacularly scenic backdrop made for a memorable, if somewhat stilted conclusion.    I can't agree with those reviewers who state that the scenes and editing were worse than the original version; this had a nice combination of history and rousing adventure with pacing that allowed for scenes to adequately \\"breathe\\", characters to establish themselves, and the viewer to be immersed in the period and predicaments.  My opinion of Michael Mann's action-packed interpretation of a favorite story has taken a definite turn for the better.
B000EULJLU|5.0|In some ways this is the most mature release Tool has ever done...incredble album. It starts out with the hard rock riffy tracks Vicarious, destined to be the album's single, and then Jambi, which is aggressive as well. Then, in the true Tool fashion, it gets all epic with the Wings for Marie and 10k Days tracks. very emotional, very personal. The Pot following, which is very unique, and again an epic, Rosetta Stoned, which tells a story in a way. Intrusion after that, which isn't bad but is IMO the album's weakest track, and then Right in two, which is a good song, very APC-like. The albums closer is love-it-or-hate-it, I personally don't care for it, it's simply noise washing with a strange voice. All in all however, a fantastic album. All hail Tool.
B0001GF2DS|1.0|This is without question the most appalling example of film restoration that I've ever encountered.  It is a textbook example of how work of this kind should NOT be approached.    Firstly, there is the look of the film itself.  It is radically different from the original prints that used to circulate prior to 2003, a semblance of which can be found in earlier DVD releases.  Although the colors here do possess a degree of vibrancy, the overall look is washed-out and is not true to the original picture.  But even more distressing is the misuse of audio.  I do not understand why film studios feel the need to convert an original mono soundtrack into surround sound.  If it is an attempt to attract a younger audience, it is bound to fail since it's unlikely that such a demographic would be interested in a film from 1966.  And if it's aimed at an older and supposedly more discerning audience, surely they'd value the integrity of the original soundtrack over an artificallly created one.      Even more than the picture, the sound mix violates the spirit of the original.  Furthermore, some of the technical people involved in the restoration decided to \\"play god\\" and RE-RECORD PARTS OF THE SOUNDTRACK!  Now, regardless of whether you feel that it now sounds \\"better\\", the point is that the director's vision should always be preserved.  To completely trash the original soundtrack is cultural vandalism of the highest order and this is particularly noticeable in the sound of the gunshots which Leone spent many hours perfecting.  These are now completely gone, replaced with more modern sounding effects which further negates the charm of the original.    There is also a noticable difference in how the music appears in the overall mix.  Possibly more than any other selection of films, the music in Leone's play a central if not the central role.  It's integral to the entire film and yet on this DVD, it sits way back in the mix, reduced to the incidental.      Film restoration is a tricky thing.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it's a disaster.  The important thing, though, is that the director's vision should be preserved as closely as possible which is clearly not the case here.  I'd recommend everyone reading this to try and see an earlier print of the film and judge the differences for themselves.  The Good, The Bad and The Ugly is one of my five favorite films and it's hugely disappointing to see it mauled in such a way.  I'd hope that in any future restoration attempts, more cultured individuals who genuinely care about the film are involved rather than crass technical people who would like to think they have Leone's talent but really are little more than clueless hacks with little imagination or even interest in the art of cinema.
B000FQJAIW|1.0|Just when it seemed that George Lucas was going to relent and release the Original Unaltered Trilogy, he pulls a fast one and yanks te rug right from underneath the fans that have been begging and pleading for them for years.  <br /> <br />Not only are these sold as \\"Bonus Discs\\" bundled with the twice released 2004 Special Editions with all that additional CGI garbage, but the movies that made him rich and famous are getting a disrespectful treatment. The DVDs of the theatrical cuts are transfered from 13 year old Laserdisc masters and not even getting the industry standard widescreen anamorphic treatment. Even with the excuse that these are just bonus discs bare in mind that thi is the first Star Wars DVD where the bonus extras are not anamorphic widescreen -- ironically it's a Star Wars movie.
B00005JO9J|5.0|Just when you thought TV execs had scraped the bottom of the medical show barrel, along comes GREY'S ANATOMY, a surprisingly fresh dramedy about the personal and professional lives of five surgical interns and their superiors.  In particular, the show focuses on Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), the daughter of a legendary surgeon who - unbeknownst to everyone but Meredith - has advanced Alzheimer's disease.  In the first episode, Meredith awakens next to her one-night-stand, then rushes off for her first day at work.  When she arrives there, she discovers that her one-night-stand is in fact her boss, Dr. Derek Sheperd (Patrick Dempsey)!    Meredith's not the only one with problems - her friends and fellow have their share of difficulties as well.  These friends include the wisecracking Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh), ex-model Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl), kind and shy George O'Malley (T.R. Knight), and the arrogant Alex Karev (Justin Chambers).  In charge of the interns is the cantankerous Dr. Bailey (Chandra Wilson), also known as \\"The Nazi\\".  They must also contend with the stern Dr. Burke (Isaiah Washington), who hides a kind heart beneath his harsh shell.      There are two \\"hot\\" medical shows currently airing on TV, each resting on one side of the medical show spectrum.  At the dark, pessimistic end of the spectrum is HOUSE, M.D.  At the light end of the spectrum is GREY'S ANATOMY.  GREY'S ANATOMY utilizes a staff of talented writers who consistently come up with intelligent, creative scripts and inventive scenarios for the characters.  The show is never dull and always interesting, thanks in no small part to the writing staff.  The dialogue is witty and well-written.  The series masterfully fluctuates between being cheerfully humorous and grimly dramatic.  None of this would be possible without the great writing staff.  However, I must bring up the point that Meredith's voice-overs are so simplistic that they're cringeworthy.    Even if the writing wasn't top-notch, the cast would be able to keep the show afloat.  Ellen Pompeo is very good as Meredith, but her performance is dominated by those from the rest of the cast.  Katherine Heigl and T.R. Knight are particularly great, and the two work very well together.  Sandra Oh is very amusing, and she has some great chemistry with Isaiah Washington - who is, by the way, excellent.  Then there's Patrick Dempsey, whose Derek Shepherd is as suave and cool a doctor as ever there was.    It seems that most shows today have great soundtracks.  GREY'S ANATOMY is no exception - in fact, it has one of the best soundtracks of any show airing today.  The songs add new depth to each scene, always enhancing the show rather than detracting from it.  The theme song, Psapp's \\"Cosy in the Rocket\\", works wonderfully in the credits sequence.  I must say that the credits sequence is one of the best I've ever seen.  I don't know what it is about it - it just seems perfect to me.  There are no pictures of the cast, merely credits and images which let the audience know that this is more than a medical show: it follows the personal lives of the characters as well.    How odd that so many great shows have begun as mid-season replacements.  GREY'S ANATOMY is one such show.  What began as a mid-season replacement has now become one of the biggest shows on television - and rightly so.  Great writing, inventive yet realistic scenarios, an excellent cast and a terrific soundtrack: what more could you want?  There's only one flaw in the series' first season: it's a mere 9 episodes long.      GREY'S ANATOMY is like a breath of fresh air.  And by the end of this season, you WILL be gasping for more.
B00005JOVH|4.0|Overall impression? Extremely well-done and eminently worthy of the X-Men title it bears. Hugh Jackman has by now proven that he OWNS the role of Logan/Wolverine and plays that role to perfection in every single scene he's in. I suspect Jackman, whether he means to or not, has been immortalized as one of those actors who will forever be remembered as the superhero he played, regardless of his more challenging or prestigious roles. (Think of it: I say the names George Reeves, Lou Ferrigno, Adam West, Lynda Carter, Christopher Reeve --who sprang to mind?) In so many respects Jackman carries the movie, building on his position as an outsider even among outsiders, and that's not an easy task in such a vast ensemble.<br /><br />At the other extreme I have to dump on Halle Berry. Her dismissive contempt for the role of Storm is unforgivable three movies into the franchise. If she thought so little of the role why on earth did she take it? Someone's got to nudge that woman in the ego. There was one moment where she actually began carrying off enough passion and emotion to make me believe it was really Ororo Munroe comforting Logan after Xavier's loss --but it was too little too late.<br /><br />Ian McKellen continues to amaze me in the way he just keeps layering one new dimension after another upon the role of Magneto --just when I thought I had the X-Men's fiercest adversary all figured out, he goes and pulls another surprise out of that dorky helmet. What looks like self-serving aggrandizement turns into a deep selflessness, and then later on a simple act of what looks like a mischevious safety lesson (i.e., locking the children in the car) turns horrifying when we see what he and Pyro intended for that car. His abrupt dimissal of Raven Darkholme/Mystique is especially startling, given how close the two had been in the previous two installments.<br /><br />This movie goes a little easier on the uninitiated --it does you the courtesy of starting out with some exposition if you didn't happen to catch the first two installments; \\"X-2\\" made no such concessions. It borrows some thematic elements of the \\"Dark Phoenix\\" saga (for example, Jean's inexplicable return to her childhood house), and makes passing homages to some common themes from the Claremont/Bryne heyday such as the Colossus-throwing-Wolverine trick, a walk-on by a Sentinel robot, and even Iceman's \\"all-over\\" body ice effect. A powerful scene involving Jean's ability to nullify Scott's optic beams is lifted pretty much word-for-word from the aforementioned Dark Phoenix saga.<br /><br />Kelsey Grammar as Hank McCoy/The Beast was a marvellous bit of casting --the character gets to have laughs at his own expense and still manage to bring something vital to the team by story's end. Unfortunately Grammar was a standout in a cast that, like the comic, tended to collapse under the weight of sheer numbers. All of the primary cast has returned (with the notable exception of Nightcrawler), and it is because of this that we don't get to bond with characters. A solemn \\"we're-a-team-together-to-the-end\\" moment loses some of its impact when we've barely had any time to really get to know Kitty Pryde or Colossus. Anna Paquin as Rogue resolves some personal issues along the way, but again, it feels like an unimportant subplot. Warren Worthington III's redemption also seems rushed --what could have been a powerful presence in the storyline feels somehow marginalized. Likewise for Mystique --we barely have time to feel any regret or pity for her eventual fate --emotions that \\"everyone knows\\" aren't supposed to be spent on villians. There is even less time spent on getting to know a lot of the new Brotherhood mutants --in many cases names aren't even given, we just have to hurry to keep up and wonder what happens next. Two exceptions may be Pyro, who has matured into a full-fledged bully, and the long-awaited Cain Marko/Juggernaut, who behaves as if he'd been lifted from the very pages of the comic book itself. His unexpected humbling at the hands of Kitty Pryde is hilarious.<br /><br />Despite the heavy screen presence of Logan, Xavier, and Storm, ultimately this story is about Jean Grey and the emergence of her dark nature --a nature which was always there, lurking just beneath the surface. Famke Jannsen is clearly very knowledgable about Jean and is more than up to the task of playing someone so complex --besides being just incredible to look at, she carries off the \\"tortured soul\\" performance to the point where we probably didn't need such elaborate visual effects to tell us when she was being Jean and when she was being Phoenix. Her passionate \\"resurrection\\" in Logan's arms is at once intolerably sexy and deeply frightening. In playing off such a character, Patrick Stewart's Xavier unfortunately comes across as an overused cliche, someone who's mode of thinking may well be outmoded and ever in the minority, and though Mr. Stewart of course gives it his all, Professor X still ends up looking weak and incapable, and even (dare I say it?) boring. As always, I found myself playing the \\"What If?\\" game with myself --imagining myself with mutant superpowers and then wondering which camp I would join. For the first time in this movie franchise, I realized I would rather be one of Magneto's Brotherhood than enroll in Xavier's school.<br /><br />Of course the visuals are stunning --even disturbing at times. This movie probably doubles the body count of its predecessor as cars are systematically flattened or set on fire. Brent Rattner is a more than worthy successor to what Bryan Singer has set up; he pays attention to the story and doesn't let the narrative wander too far afield. In fact the pacing is damned near excellent --a good balance of dialogue versus the action elements. In the interests of trivia, this movie marks the first time that the entire original X-Men roster has featured (Xavier, Cyclops, Jean, Beast, Iceman, and Angel, although there isn't an actual moment when all six are seen together). The duality of the chess scene which ended the first movie is revisited here in the final moments before the closing credits, and there is an even more unexpected bonus AFTER the credits have rolled, so stay in your seat until the house lights come up!<br /><br />Okay, nerdy moment over. Go check it out. On balance, I don't think you'll be disappointed in the least.of the comic book itself.

B00005JOVH|4.0|A fitting end (so it would appear) to a very good series.  Last Stand lacks some of the fun the first two X-Men movies, but it's still a top-notch comic book film.  As with the previous two, Last Stand is among the best of the Marvel comics books-to-movies.  In this series, though, it's the weakest of the three.<br /><br />Could there be more X-Men movies?  Sure.  But with Magneto (and Rogue) made human (non-mutant), Professor X, Jean Grey and Scott Summers dead, it would be a pretty bad idea to make a 4th movie, unless the remaining X-Men were teamed with other heroes (Spiderman, Fantastic Four, etc.)<br /><br />It was well-acted and scripted.  Parents, if you're concerned about language, there was some mild cursing.  Otherwise, kids will like it alot.  It will probably disappoint the hardcore comic book fans.<br /><br />Last Stand is definitely worth the price of theater admission.
0792843584|5.0|This is probably the most maligned motion picture ever made.  The only thing I find confusing about this picture is that it was mostly shot in sepia, a film format that emulates old tin-type photos.  Had this film been in full color I think the original reviews from the '80's would have been much better.  Even the actors and actresses while original filming was being done believed they were involved with the next, \\"Gone With the Wind\\", and had this picture been released in the late 1990's I believe it would have been a block buster. <br />The main characters are cleanly introduced at the beginning of the film during the college commencement scene.  The character played by Christopher Walken(Nate)is the dark-evil of the film. Without this character the film would be meaningless. <br />Very good film and worth watching the full DVD release.
B00005JOVH|2.0|To say that seing \\"X-Men: The Last Stand\\" was never-racking for a giant fan of the first two chapters in the mutant saga was putting it lightly.  The departure of cerebral director Bryan Singer for the sledgehammer simplicity of Brett Ratner did not bode well for the franchises' future.  Thrown in the fact that the writers of \\"X2\\" left with Singer and Zak Penn (Inspector Gadget) and Simon Kinberg (Mr. and Mrs. Smith) replaced them, and the thematic weight, intelligence and character development that made the first two \\"X-Men\\" movies so satisfying looked as if it was going to be severely handicapped.  Sadly, that is just what happened. <br /> <br />\\"The Last Stand\\" did start off with promising premise:  A pharmaceutical company run by a mutant-phobe (Michael Murphy) creates a way to suppress the mutant genes in all the world's mutants.  Marketed as a benevolent cure, the X-Men (Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, Patrick Stewart as Charles Xavier, Halle Berry as Storm and newcomer Kelsey Grammar doing unexpectedly great work as the warmly intellectual Beast) and all their fellow mutants have to grapple with the ethical implications and consequences that the cure presents.  What would a person, mutant or otherwise, do if they had the power to remove genetic differences they had with an accepted norm and avoid the possible persecution that comes with beng an outsider?  However, the nefarious Magneto (an ever-superb Ian McKellen) sees the cure as a way to subdue and eradicate the mutant population.  The X-Men, caught in the middle between the humans and Magneto's growing army of disaffected and threatened Mutants, have to step up and fight in a desparate end-game. <br /> <br />But the promise and potential of the premise is wasted.  The question of the cure is raised, but it is never plumbed for thematic richness, and in the end, it is simply used as a weapon to deliver visceral, shallow thrills.  Ratner, Penn, and Kinberg do their plot no favors by throwing in the saga of JeanGrey as the ressurected Phoenix (Famke Jansen), and way too many new characters.  None of the story's nourishing sub-plots or supporting characters are germinated or allowed to mature, and the emotional impact of the movie is blunted by the overdose of too much mutant mayhem, plot and chaos.  Even the deaths of three major characters inspire only indifference.  The action may be incredibly and visually impressive (no sequence moreso than Magneto's rerouting of the Golden Gate Bridge) but Ratner, Penn and Kinberg do not understand that action holds weight only when the audience can give a damn about the figures involved.  Ratner and co. squandered much of the goodwill leftover from Bryan Singer, and even though a ton of money will be made off of the \\"Last Stand,\\" audiences will hesitate a long time before even considering seeing an \\"X4.\\"

B00004TH6O|5.0|I own all of QOTSA'S albums and I have to say this my favorite one. If you haven't heard the songs from this album. You'll go crazy for such catchy tracks as \\"feel good hit of the summer\\" which doesn't have the best lyrics but it does have some of the catchiest (CaCaCaCocaine!!!) on the album combined with simple but groovy guitars this song proves to be one of the best songs on the album. The album doesn't lose steam and continues with \\"The Lost Art Of Keeping A Secret\\". \\"Leg Of Lamb\\", \\"Better Living Through Chemistry\\", \\"In The Fade\\", and contrary to the name \\"Lightning Song\\" slightly slower tracks but all of them are full of intensity, powerful licks and lyrics. For those who like the heavier stuff check out \\"Tension Head\\". All in all this album is full of great songs and variety. A righteous CD that is must have for everyone.
B000AYEIZY|4.0|Jeff Beck once said, \\"The reason I left Beck, Bogert & Appice is because they expected me to tear my hair out every night and play my guitar until it melted!\\" If you expect this CD to be the Rapture, the Alpha & Omega, the Second Coming of the soul of Jimi Hendrix, well, then you may be disappointed. But, you want a first-rate blues-rock CD by three of the best players in rock history, then you'll be plenty pleased. Jack Bruce, sounding more ragged and Scottish of voice than ever, brings a new, chilling reality to \\"We're Going Wrong;\\" and, of course, his bass playing is solid as ever.(He also adds some pretty fab-oo-lus harmonica playing to the Muddy Waters standard, \\"Rollin' And Tumblin'\\"!) Ginger Baker, always cheerful, handles the recitation of \\"Pressed Rat and Warthog\\" with aplomb and brings \\"White Room\\" and \\"Toad\\" to new heights with his pounding tympani style. As for Eric Clapton---Well!!! Just pull up and listen!!! Old Slowhand is positively rejuvinated at not having to play leader for once: His vocals are sharp and confident and his playing on \\"Outside Woman BLues\\" and \\"Stormy Monday\\" is very, very good indeed. \\"Sunshine Of Your Love\\" just happens to contain one of the best rock guitar riffs ever, and this version will make you shine. Yes, the world's greatest supergroup is back, sounding just like a GROUP, thank God, not a collection of individuals. Buy this CD, you won't be disappointed, especially if you don't expect torn hair and melting guitars.
B000089RVX|1.0|Evanescence is the illegitimate child of Nightwish and Lacuna Coil, filtered of any life for mass consumption. (Even moreso for the latter.) The real kicker is that none of the bands this is derived from are any good.<br /><br />Amy Lee has to be the most overrated vocalist of the millennium. She doesn't sound dark or \\"mysterious,\\" nor is she talented. Her singing is glorified pop vocals with a superficial melancholic edge, no doubt processed beyond recognition.<br /><br />I once heard that 1 out of every 8 pennies, or some ridiculous statistic, has passed through someone's system at some point. If bands were coins, Evanescense would definitely be a stinkpenny.<br />- Thus says the Pellington
B000ETQRCM|5.0|I wasn't at all familiar with this band before they made a recent comeback. My first comparison when I heard the powerful opening track \\"Life Wasted\\",was with Free and Paul Rodgers,and their band's playing style.<br /><br />Am I the only person to have noticed this?

B00005JMCW|5.0|I really like this movie! It is one of the best movies I ever seen. I think the plot is really creative which brings out meaningful insights. In addition to that, it also points a problem between parents and teenagers which is lack of understanding. Through the switch, Tess Coleman and Anna better understand each other such as their problems, difficulties, pressure so on and so forth. Anna realized her mother's life isn't that perfect after all while Tess Coleman understands her daughter's problems at school such as the conflict with the history teacher and the constant detention. They both change a lot through the movie. At the end, they know how to get along with each other. I really like the ending! I think this movie is really engaging, Lindsay Lohan has done a great job acting out Anna! Overall, the movie is really hilarious!
B00005B36H|5.0|This is absolutely the most intricate, complex, deep and perfect album ever created.  Whether listening to the melodic and brilliant \\"Schism\\", the serene, entrancing \\"Reflection\\", or the powerful and heavy \\"Lateralus\\", Tool creates a sound that is both innovative and fresh.  For anyone who is even remotely interested in rock or metal, this album is a must have.
B00005JOVH|1.0|This movie was a HUGE disappointment...It was just two hours of inconsistentcy and was overall just horrible..1st off, The script was just very boring and had very little action in it.  2nd, It was very unoriginal and stole sinpets from Joss Weadon's Astonishing X-Men Books=yet the rest of film did a total 360 with straying from the comics. #1, Jean comes back and... KILLS CYCLOPS (what???? the leader of X-Men? her boyfriend..what? ), #2 they have ROGUE have her powers removed with \\"The Cure\\".  #3 The X-Men tame Magneto with \\"The Cure\\". #4 Mystique is hit with \\"the Cure\\" and betrays Magneto and the Mutant Brotherhood.#5 Jean also kills....Professor X? what again? (Plus, they call her the Pheonix, but she's nothing like the firery one we knew in the comics, just some BS \\"EVIL\\" version for the flick...#6. to save the world, Wolverine KILLS JEAN?????... <br />Okay, in many of the comics to film movies, villans were killed in the end, but this movie had the heroes turned into such distant versions of themselves in this movie, it was nothing but sterile uses of the names and designs of these characters...Sure Jean Grey and The Professor have died and have been ressurrected in the books and stuff, but the way the film had them die was just rediculous..I cannot believe Stan Lee let this script and movie be released to the public...This was a sham..I thought the whole movie was a joke...It was a horrible film which I won't see again and will not buy when released on dvd...like the pathetic Catwoman and that little runt they got running around in tights for the new Superman Returns films, I'll just forget X3 exists...(Hopefully  Spidey 3 won't suck this bad, but, yet again at the pictures I've seen of the sad black costume they have him sporting, it looks like Spidey 3 maybe a bomb of a flick in process...maybe the super-hero flick craze and quality of these films is starting to run out of steam?>>)
B000ETQRCM|5.0|Pearl Jams new album just takes off with the first two songs, Life Wasted and \\"World Wide Suicide\\", in a terrific hard rock sound and the CD goes on to offer quality content all the way through in a very satisfying collection. What is most impressive is not just Eddie Vedder's quality vocals that range from his hard rock voice to \\"Parachutes\\", where he sounds like a laid back Harry Nilsson, and \\"Come Back\\", a song that Bruce Springsteen could add to his repartee, but that this band instrumentally is technically great. The guitar work is just outstanding along with the drums, the whole band sounds technically fantastic playing off each other with great timing. They have the skillful ability to jam one minute in a song and then ease into a slow section appropriate for the specific song and then revving up the music like a pilot who can do the perfectly smooth touch down and get airborne again without a bump. The variation in sounds really adds to the CD that predominately rocks as the CD's songs seem to set each one up in a flowing arrangement that makes the whole CD a joy to listen to. The whole CD is a pleasure and although there are standout tunes, such as \\"Army Reserve\\", I think the listener will have plenty to choose from and accept it as one great catalogue.
B000EPR7NE|5.0|I love Hans Zimmer, so I knew this would be great, but I was blown away by it.  <br /> <br />I saw the movie yesterday, and it was . . . okay.  But listening to the score made me wish I could watch it again right now.  It's that good.   <br /> <br />Choral music is a particular favourite of mine anyway, but Zimmer's pieces add an ethereal beauty to the score that makes it even more beautiful than Zimmer's usual already amazing work.  It is both soaring and sacred; classic, modern, and ancient.  It is everything the score for this movie should have been and so much more:  a beautiful work in its own right.   <br /> <br />Really, you can't go wrong with it.
0312962118|5.0|When I read the summary of this book, I ordered it, without wasting a second. This book didn't disappoint me in the least. This is my first foray into the Russian thriller genre, and I can't wait to read another.<br /><br />Anna Khorev, Alex Slanski, Jakob Massey, Yuri Lukin. 4 different people trying to accomplish 3 different objectives. These 4 different people about whom the readers will learn a lot.<br /><br />A plot to assasinate Joseph Stalin. Knowledge of this plot by Soviet leadership. The reader gets to see both sides.<br /><br />The setting, plot, character development and skillful artistry with which Glenn Meade writes are a recipe for instant success. This book is gripping, intense and absolutely readable. In all honesty, this book now tops my list of favorites.<br /><br />I hope you enjoy this book just as much as I did.
B00005JOFQ|3.0|The makers of this movie wanted to make an \\"art\\" movie supposedly.  They never thought it would be a big box office hit supposedly.  So they underpaid the actors and made Budweiser one of the main characters.  The bar had nothing but Budweiser signs and the people drank nothing but Budweiser that were of the current design in spite of the fact that this movie supposedly takes place in the 60s.  But continuity means nothing to movie makers who want the product placement payola more than they want to make a great movie. <br /> <br />Brokeback is NOT a great movie by any stretch of the imagination.  It's widely overrated simply because it is about homosexuals.  The dialogue is often painfully simplistic relative to the dramatic impact the movie wants to make.  Heath Ledger's character is so wooden, it's hard to understand what the heck Jake sees in him. <br /> <br />The portrayal of the characters in middle age is a joke.  They still look like they're in their 20s.  A fake mustache was a quick and easy but pathetic attempt at aging Jake.  They needed more makeup work and some sort of receeding of the hairline.  <br /> <br />The sodomy scene was gratuitous and to some people disgusting.  There was no romantic leadup to it, so it was just weird. <br /> <br />Brokeback Mountain = overrated.
B0009MDPYW|1.0|Slow, unoriginal and down right dumb horror film that is held down by a lousy script, a director who did not know the basics of directing a movie and a career worse performance by Keanu Reeves that makes this movie unintentionally funny in all the wrong places. Reeves is so bad in fact that he makes his co-stars look just as bad as he is with their acting with the grand exception of Rachel Weisz, who not only proves how strong and powerful an actor she is by giving the only great and meaningful performance in the entire film (Not an easy thing to do considering the fact that she is stuck holding Keanu Reeve's hand during the whole film while he makes a complete ass out of himself) but manages to make you kind of interested in what's going on with the film while you want to desperately turn off the DVD player in disgust. The screenplay is a jumbled mess with a story that contradicts itself on several occasions and The directing hold no ground in terms of moving the story along and is so badly shot in some places that you don't even now what is going on from time to time. <br /> <br />The movie is a pathetic disaster and it should have never been made <br />
B0007GAERG|5.0|Mariah made an incredible come back with this album.  It was pretty good.
B00003CWNR|4.0|The film version of the book has some great performances, especially from Michael Caine. It helps that John Irving himself wrote the script. It's a nice, touchy-feely movie but the plot somewhat drags in the middle and the characters become somewhat fuzzy as well. But I enjoyed it very much. It's one of Tobey McGuire's strongest performances pre-Spiderman. Charlize Theron also showed her pre-Oscar dramatic chops here.
B00097A5HW|4.0|Very artistic with lots of depths especially with the song \\"No\\".  Track number 4 was musically fulfilling and a nice surprise.  Track three is fun...got addicted to the song, overall a good album.
B0006B2A2E|4.0|I admit that I didn't like the movie when it came out. I thought it was strange and the editing is bizarre and I thought Jim Carrey overacted but Kate Winslet was good as usual. The fast cutting gave me a headache. As I said, I didn't like it that much but then I saw it again out of boredom with friends and this time I got it. The quirky characters and story suddenly made sense to me and I realized it was really a very smart, sentimental, and original love story. I like love stories; I just wasn't used to them being told this way, and I wasn't used to an ambiguous ending but that's the charm of it. I couldn't stop thinking about it afterwards. So in that sense, it is a very good movie.
B0000X61VE|1.0|I bought this Cindy workout on VHS when it first came out - it was a bit fast but I loved the exercises and music.  At that time, I showed it to my personal licensed long-distance exercise physiologist - my lovely sister-in-law.  She works with many different groups and individuals in her private practice and agreed with me that the exercises were great but ridiculously fast and the form needed adjustment.  I agree with \\"Dr Beth's\\" assessment that this is no problem if you are experienced and in good health - so you do 14-16 to every 20 of Cindy's moves.  <br /> <br />The DVD, however, is a totally different animal.  Everything is on super-fast forward - exercise, music, even voices.  It has a comic effect; I am surprised everyone doesn't sound like Alvin the Chipmunk!  Who edited this transfer to DVD?  It didn't work and shouldn't have been marketed.  Give me back the VHS!
B000EHRVP6|3.0|it had good gory effects, but the movie was a waste of time...
B000005QH3|5.0|This movie was very weird because everything about it is early ninties-ish, everything, the actors hair, makeup, music, the picture quality, yet this movie was made in 1971. its one of the damnedest things ive ever saw.
B000005Z0G|3.0|This is 2pacalypse Now part 2. It is just as raw/rough and that is the Tupac everyone enjoyed. Not that his Deathrow releases were anything but amazing, however nothing compares to 1991-1995 Pac. This album was quite overlooked however it contains four singles (Holler If Ya Hear Me, Keep Ya Head Up, I Get Around, and Papa'z Song) all great tracks. Keep Ya Head Up is my favourite out of those, a real classic that proves Pac can write a song without bad language and violence etc, which is a thing that most rappers can't seem to do. Its no wonder his the number 1 MC of all time. On this CD I like the following tracks  Holler If Ya Hear Me, Point The Finga, Souljah's Revenge, Guess Who's Back, Representin 93, Keep Ya Head Up, Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z., The Streetz R Deathrow, I Get Around and Papa'z Song which are all top tracks from the best rapper of all time.    R.I.P. Tupac Amaru Shakur aka the best rapper of all time
0765315246|5.0|John Scalzi's debut novel, Old Man's War has an intriguing premise, some interesting science fiction concepts, and a complete ability to ignore military SF cliches that usually turn me off from this kind of book.  It's a wonderful little book, violent but not overly graphic (though there are a couple of scenes that go beyond that), and it's certainly worth all of the accolades that have been heaped on it.  Only the fact that it's a bit slow to get to the meat of the action drags it down even a little bit.<br /><br />Earth has reached the stars, and been slammed back into isolation.  Humans are out there colonizing the galaxy, but Earth itself is cut off from it, becoming almost a backwater in comparison to everything else.  The Colonial Defense Force (CDF) insures that this remains so.  On the other hand, once you turn seventy-five, you can enlist in the CDF, go out and see the universe, and kill lots of aliens who are out to kill you too.  You'll just never see Earth again.  John Perry has decided to take this route, and Old Man's War tells the story of this decision, and what he runs into when he gets out there.  What he learns when he gets there is beyond what he could ever have imagined.  He gets a new, grown body (green and all) that will make him young again (even if he's not completely human any more) and the extreme possibility of dying out in the mean universe.  But he could be dead in ten years anyway, in a broken down body, on Earth, so why not go out where his death means something?  Will John be a successful soldier, not only surviving but rising in the ranks?  Or will he just be more cannon-fodder for the human colonies?<br /><br />Scalzi is on record (in a Usenet post when asked about his military experience) as saying that he wanted Old Man's War to be accessible by his grandmother, who has no interest in things military.  This meant that he wasn't going to spend a great deal of time on infantry tactics, technology, and the jingoism that many military SF novels embrace.  The weapon of choice for the CDF is an adaptable rifle that fires five types of ammunition and can change on the fly, and he spends a bare amount of time making any explanations for the science of the situations he presents, such as the \\"skip drive\\" that gets everybody from Point A to Point B.  It's the military SF novel for those who can't stand the genre, and I loved it for that.<br /><br />Still, Scalzi doesn't completely avoid the science, and there are a couple of \\"theoretical\\" (as in, one of the characters who doesn't really know a whole lot about it is theorizing) explanatory scenes that seek to get this sort of thing out of the way.  I found this appropriate given the situation that Scalzi presents.  The humans that are enlisting don't know any of this stuff.  The CDF keeps humans ignorant of it intentionally, so Scalzi is able to gloss over it a bit.  While I did find it appropriate, I also thought that these occasional theorizing scenes slowed the book down much more than they should have (though certainly much less than they would have if they had been fully explained, and yes, I'm speaking to you, Mr. Weber!)<br /><br />Scalzi gets the characterization down perfectly, creating a great \\"hero\\" in Perry.  He's intelligent and he rises through the ranks fairly quickly by using his brain.  The friendships that Perry forms when he first enlists seem very logical, as these people have been thrown together into a strange situation with no visible support apparatus.  Even the fact that the first thing these older people do when they get young bodies is to enjoy themselves with as many people as possible is certainly understandable, and Perry's first scene like this is hilarious (though none of it is actually shown, for those prudes among us).<br /><br />There is only one characterization misstep, and I'd say the good and the bad of the character even out.  Perry's drill instructor, Master Sergeant Ruiz, is hilariously portrayed by Scalzi, with all of the typical movie drill instructor attitude.  Even better is that he acknowledges the drill instructor stereotype, insisting that the recruits get that stereotype out of their heads because he's not going to gain \\"grudging respect\\" for them.  He doesn't like any of them.  This is all refreshing, acknowledging the clich&eacute;s and then moving beyond them.  Unfortunately, after his brilliant opening scene, we don't see a lot of him, and the description of subsequent events make him seem like the drill instructor that we all are familiar with.  Only his last scene with Perry really moves above this.<br /><br />The other small problem with Old Man's War is that it takes a long time to get through the setup of the setting.  This is mitigated by the entertaining way that Scalzi writes these sequences, but it takes almost half the book before Perry actually gets into the action.  The rest is his journey to the CDF and the establishing of the galaxy and his place in it.  It's only a small problem because Scalzi does make it interesting, but I wish some of it could have been condensed.<br /><br />Overall, Old Man's War is a wonderful book, one that I raced through because I was loving every minute of it.  If you absolutely hate the genre of military SF, then you may find that even this book won't be enjoyable.  But if you're just annoyed with a lot of the military SF that's out there, give this one a shot.  It's an excellent debut novel, setting up an interesting situation, with characters that are a lot more compelling than in others of the genre.  This one's worth a shot.<br /><br />David RoyScalzi, with all of the typical movie drill instructor attitude.

0812550706|5.0|Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card proves to be a better book than expected. It takes you away into a mystical land where a sense of a totalitarian government is created as well as a taste of how society would be if run by only a few powerful people. Not only did Ender's Game show the story of one small boy, Ender, growing up but it also showed his brother, Peter and his sister, Valentine. Love is shown as well as a powerful and fun plot. <br /> <br />This book should be read by all ages due to the way the characters are written. They all show that they have compassion, but at another point, they can also be harsh and hurtful to those around them. Orson Scott Card has proven that the characters are 'human'.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|There are a lot of people who rated this CD as only one star because it's not \\"real metal.\\"  These people need to chillax.  I don't care how many metal bands you can list off.  No one does.  Do you like it, or do you not?  <br /> <br />As for me, I like it.  I love the guitar solos, I enjoy the singing, I like the drums, and I think the songs progress nicely.  Simple as that. <br /> <br />They've improved a lot as musicians, and it's fun to see them trying to branch out a little bit.

Eeeeeek! <br /> <br />I will definitely search out some other titles by this author!
B000005RTQ|4.0|Although never breaking through in the States like fellow British metal bands Def Leppard, Iron Maiden, and Judas Priest, Saxon released several strong albums in the early to mid-80's and Crusader would be their last one until they went back to their roots in the '90s. Starting with their previous release, Power and the Glory, Saxon added more melody to their heavy sound in order to gain popularity in the U.S. While Power and the Glory suffered from a lack of memorable songs, Crusader was a stronger release and while their sound was more polished than on classics like Wheels of Steel and Strong Arm of the Law, it was still hard enough to please their diehard fans while being more accessible.<br /><br />Most of the songs here are strong and have something to please all metal fans. If you like melodic metal, it doesn't get much better than \\"Sailing to America.\\" With its memorable melodies and choruses and its killer guitar solos, it's on par with Def Leppard's most melodic (and way more popular) material. \\"Just Let Me Rock\\" and \\"Run for Your Lives\\" are melodic mid-tempo numbers while \\"A Little Bit of What You Fancy\\" and \\"Rock City\\" were good anthems although not on the level of \\"Wheels of Steel\\" or \\"Denim and Leather\\". Like many of the British bands of the day, Saxon tried their hand at writing an epic and while the title track won't make you forget Iron Maiden's \\"Hallowed Be Thy Name\\" or Judas Priest's \\"Beyond the Realms of Death\\", it's still very good. Other good tracks include the pulsing \\"Bad Boys (Like to Rock N' Roll)\\" and a scorching version of Sweet's \\"Set Me Free.\\"  Finally, \\"Do It All for You\\" is one of the great metal ballads that could appeal to both love sick teenagers and hard rock fans. All told, Crusader would the last of the strong Saxon albums for awhile as Rock the Nations and Destiny (among others) would suffer from both a lack of focus and weak songwriting.
B000001E7T|5.0|TO BRING YOU MY LOVE was PJ Harvey's third release and honestly I didn't know what to make of the album at first.  I had heard that the band had split up and she was going it alone, with help from producer Flood (!).  In a way I was prepared for a different sounding PJ Harvey but looking back I guess I had no idea HOW different.  I had just come off quite a high with her first two albums, the excellent RID OF ME and the beautiful debut DRY.  When I first caught sight of the cover I thought, \\"Waaahhh!\\"  It looks like our dear lil Polly is all growns up, and quite the force to be reckoned with, fierce in that red dress.<br /><br />Gone are the days of the raw Albini produced sounds, this album has got a major blues vibe to it.  I had heard the single \\"Down by the Water\\" and seen the video but yet I still wasn't prepared for this record.  I wasn't prepared to fall in love with another PJ album, especially one that's such a departure from her beloved earlier works.  But of course I did fall in love again and I think this album is her strongest work to date, both in songwriting and in use of instruments.  Polly explores a darker range of topics with her lyrics this time around, especially in reference of a religious nature.  Plenty of guitar, lush organs and standout vocals make for this dark, dense record.  The ten tracks will take you on an intense  musical journey and stretch your imagination, leaving you in awe of the complex yet spare sounds and its brutal melodrama will bring you to your knees.<br /><br />We start off with the title track, \\"To Bring You My Love.\\"  This song to me is the only song reminisce of ROM on the record.  It's a bit raw but in a moody kind of way.  As soon as you hear Polly's voice you'll immediately sense this is a powerful song.  What I love throughout this record is the usage of her vocals, clear and urgent, Polly's singing is impeccable.<br /><br />\\"Meet Ze Monsta\\" is a crazy restless song.  It's all over the place, I imagine a very strong woman trying to fight a \\"big black monsoon\\" but of course she loses and eventually gives in to suicide to \\"meet ze monstra.\\"  Over a quarrel with her lover.  Alls fair in love and war.<br /><br />\\"Working For The Man\\" is a strange, strange song.  In a good way.  It is very sinister, PJ's somber vocals very effective in lending to the eerie effect of the song.  I think this song is about a psychotic serial killer who preys on women and insists he's doing well because he's \\"working for the man.\\"  You know, HIM.<br /><br />\\"C'mon Billy\\" is bluesy folk rock at its best.  I love the acoustic guitar, the emotion the strings bring out of me and the desperate yearning of PJ's voice here.  A very heartfelt plea from a very desperate woman for the father of her son to return and lay with her on golden cornfields for days on end.<br /><br />\\"Teclo\\" is stranger still.  I read in a magazine that PJ said Teclo is someone's name.  I would've never guessed.  Hearing this song makes me conjure images of angels, halos and God.  I dunno why.<br /><br />\\"Long Snake Moan\\" is awesome!  I swear this song helps me curb my road rage.  I shout along to the lyrics and instantly feel better, it's like a stress reliever of a song.  This song makes me feel powerful and important because I can work voodoo and make mere mortals and even \\"God above, All drunk on my love...\\"<br /><br />\\"Down By The Water\\" is the single off the album and one that actually did well on the charts, I think.  It's a very catchy song, with the heavy steady keyboards, playful bells and the malevolent chorus, \\"Little fish, big fish swimming in the water/Come back here man gimme my daughter.\\"<br /><br />My favorite song on this album has got to be the very dark, \\"I Think I'm A Mother.\\"  Reason being, well, frankly I just don't understand the freakin' song and I long to find out!  I'm fascinated with this song, from the slow opening of the guitar and the building of the drums to the nonchalant-ness of her voice as she sings something about wanting to have an abortion because she despises the mother-in-law.  Wait, what?!  I know, hence the fascination.<br /><br />\\"Send His Love To Me\\" is very similar to \\"C'mon Billy\\" in that it's very folksy.  A very heartfelt, beautiful song.<br /><br />\\"The Dancer\\" is without a doubt the most passionate song I've ever heard.  I dare anyone to  come up with a more beautiful, soulful song!  The swaying of the strings, the gut-wrenching<br /><br />wails of her voice and the killer lyrics just leaves me begging for more:<br /><br />He came riding fast like a phoenix side a fire flame<br /><br />He came dressed in black with a cross bearing my name<br /><br />He came bathed in light and the splendor and glory<br /><br />I can't believe what the Lord has finally sent me<br /><br />He said \\"Dance for me, fanciulla gentil\\"<br /><br />He said \\"Laugh for awhile, I can make your heart feel\\"<br /><br />He said \\"Fly with me, touch the face of the true God\\"<br /><br />And then he cried with joy at the depth of my love...<br /><br />Oh Lord, how that song kills me.  And what a lovely way to end an epic of an album.  At first I wasn't sure how to feel about the album but a listen is all it took for me to be very impressed indeed.  5 stars all the way.of her voice as she sings something about wanting to have an abortion because she despises the mother-in-law.

0307277674|1.0|This is the worst drivel I've ever read. It blows my mind that anyone would call this book good, much less great. I practically grew up in a library and I'm a writer with a degree in English, but you don't have to be educated to be able to see how bad it is. I don't have enough time to point out everything wrong with this book so I'll just say flat out, Dan Brown can't write. My perspective has nothing to do with my religious beliefs. In fact, I can't believe that anyone would come to doubt their religious beliefs because of this book. Dan Brown's re-writing of history is so unconvincing and far-fetched it's laughable in some places. Hidden symbols of the \\"sacred feminine\\" in Disney's The Little Mermaid? You've got to be kidding me.<br /><br />Someone mentioned that Brown teaches creative writing? That amazes me, since the number one rule of writing--\\"Show, don't tell\\" gets completely thrown out the window in this book. There were absolutely no surprises. I had to force myself to finish the book when I got to the half way point.<br /><br />This might have been a lot more readable if Brown had actually put some work into it. I'm not talking about research, clearly he did research the historical elements to some extent. I'm talking about the actual writing. He seems to have been so anxious to \\"enlighten\\" the world with his concepts that he wrote it all out as fast he could and turned it in. It reads like a first draft. I can't put all the blame on Brown, however. Any editor worth a darn should have been able to turn this mess into something readable. Maybe he decided to go out and find the grail himself?
B00005JOVH|2.0|I rarely go to the movies these days what with tickets being upwards of nine bucks.  But X-men movies have been the exception, because the X-men comics were my favorite back in the day and I thought the first two movies were great hero flicks.  Also it is said that X-men 3 is to be the last of the series, although a Wolverine spinoff is in the works.  Sadly I think X-men 3 finishes off the series on a low note. <br /> <br />The movie starts off shortly after the events of XM2.  The X-men are back at the school licking there wounds after the death of Jean Grey.  It is revealed that a drug company has come up with a cure for mutants that would make them normal.  This of course is used by Magneto to recruit for his organazation (The Brotherhood) who wishes to launch a war against mankind.   <br /> <br />XM3 has a lot more action than the first two and racks up a impressively high body count along the way, but sacrifices plot and character developement along the way.  Wolverine gets his fair share of screen time, but most of the others are short changed, and in a few cases killed off fairly quickly.  The most interesting subplot for me of the last two movies has been the Iceman/Rogue romance.  At the beginning this promises to again be interesting as Rogue, who cannot touch another person without hurting them, considers taking the new mutant cure.  Sadly though this sub plot is not fully developed and Anna Paquin is mostly absent from this film.   <br /> <br />XM3 also adds several characters from the comic series including Angel, Beast, Collossus, Shadow Cat and various Morlocks and Marauders if I remember correctly. Only Beast, played by Kelsey Grammer gets any screen time. Most of the participation of the newbies is at the cameo level, and that is a bit sad because some of them are interesting characters, especially Kitty Pryde. <br /> <br />Speaking of Kitty Pryde, Ellen Page does a wonderful job and steals what few scenes she has and Kelsey Grammer is also excellent as Beast.  The film does have a few interesting fight scenes but left me feeling a unsatisfied as I left the theatre.  In the end it is hard for me to imagine who will really enjoy this film a lot.  People who know nothing of the X-men world except the previous movies will be a somewhat lost by the parade of new characters.  I haven't read a X-men comic in close to 20 years and I saw some big inconsistencies so I have no idea how the fanboyz are going to take to this.  In the end, this is just a summer action flick, so if you check your brain at the door you may have fun.  Then again maybe not.
B00005MP58|5.0|I have seen this movie three time and it is still a favorite.
B00013F38K|4.0|People who grew up during those 70's years must appreciate that the producers decide to release Kung-Fu on DVDs. Some said that some of the episodes were cut, but what the hack!! You can have them all and enjoy, particularly, the important lessons of life those masters gave to young and major Kwai Chang while at the temple. Those thoughts should be listed and presented them on a book for everybody to be read. The unhappy fact about this show was that Bruce Lee should've been playing the Caine character not Carradine, for racial reasons!! Nevertheless, Carradine took the roll and he did a great perfomance, deeping his mind into it and becaming an icon during that era, and learning how to persistently walk without shoes. The episodes mixed lots of people as guest actors and singers that would become, some of them, famous in the future years; Jodie Foster, Harrison Ford, Leslie Nielsen, Mako, Jose Feliciano, etc. Interviews are interesting as  guidance, saddly, two important chinese actors are no longer around with us. During the 80's, some people tried to dust the show without the same success and mystic of the 70's, even though Carridine was envolved in it. But, back to the point; buy these 3 collections, the price is right for a worth time of joy and wisdom.<br /><br />J.C. Varela
B0000524CY|5.0|As if this horror flic isn't scary enough, the Exorcist was actually inspired by the authentic, nearly two-month long exorcism performed in 1949 on a 14-year old boy by the Catholic Church. Also, if you're really interested the actual case that inspired the \\"The Exorcist,\\" you can find all the facts on the net, or even watch \\"Possessed,\\" a 2000 horror film starring Timothy Dalton. Although I must warn potential viewers- -the Timothy Dalton movie isn't all that great.    Well after watching this movie, I was so impressed that I decided to read the novel, written by William Peter Blatty. Since several, well-written plot summaries have already been given, I think I'll skip the whole synopsis bit. I must say that \\"The Exorcist\\" truly does justice to the text it is based on. Unlike most novel-turned-movies, this film closely follows Blatty's original novel without adding any made-up, superfluous scenes, characters, or storylines.     What's more, this new, unedited version of the Exorcist is exactly the same as the original film, except for the fact that there is the famous spiderwalk, several other deleted scenes, and a few extra creepy, demonic faces briefly flashed onscreen.      However, I do have one tiny, miniscule complaint concerning the Exorcist movie- -it lacks some of the complexity and intrigue that the book has. Throughout the book, there is an ongoing mystery as to whether the little girl Regan is truly possessed or not. Surprisingly enough, telekinesis, superhuman strength, speaking in other voices, and even ESP are somewhat common traits among severely disturbed individuals. Thus, despite all the shocking, belligerent episodes Regan has- -they can all be explained away by modern psychology (well...everything except for the whole head-spinning bit).      In fact, up till the novel's conclusion, the author (Blatty) does such a superb job of describing the psychological aspects of Regan's behavior that I was continually caught between the belief that she wastruly possessed, and the notion that she was mentally ill. Unfortunately, the movie doesn't offer this kind of suspense- -throughout the entire film, one can pretty much assume that Regan is possessed. Not to mention, the book delves much more into the details behind the identity of Pazuzu, the sole demon responsible for Regan's possession(Pazuzu is supposedly the god of sickness and pestilence, who had previously lost a religious battle against the character Father Merin, played by Max Von Sydow), the church desecrations that occur near Regan's house, along with the mysterious death of Burke Dennings. Burke Dennings'character is a good friend/colleague of Regan's mother who \\"mysteriously\\" falls out of Regan's bedroom window and breaks his neck to the point that his head is twisted completely backwards. Nevertheless, this is still one, if not the very best horror movies ever made. What's more, I highly recommend reading the novel.

B000FQJAIW|1.0|When the news of this release was first issued, I was ecstatic.  Finally, I could have a Luca$film release of Star Wars, Original Version - non special ed - on DVD.  The news started trickling in.  This release would be the Special Edition with a bonus disc.  The bonus material would be the Original unedited edition.  I was still happy with being able to have a this on DVD.  Then more news of it started trickling in.  The bonus material would be basically a transfer from laserdisc.  No picture restoration.  No picture cleanup.  Just a laserdisc transfer.  Then even more info came in.    The bonus material will be letterbox.  It will NOT be widescreen anamorphic.  The sound quality is still up in the air. <br /> <br />It appears to me that the \\"Originals\\" are being released in a very poor format.  It appears to me that Luca$film is releasing them only so that they can say to the fans of the Original Trilogy that \\"hey, we gave it to you.  Now shut up\\".   <br /> <br />No, this release is a slap in the face.  It is an insult to fans of the Original Trilogy.   <br /> <br />To everyone that already has the special editions on DVD from last year... why buy this?  You already have the special editions.  If you want a really good laserdisc to DVD version of the Original Trilogy, head on over to Ebay and tell Luca$film how you feel with your wallets. <br /> <br />So, what could have been a wonderful release of the Trilogy (both versions that would encompass ALL fans) will not be.  It will be a release for the special ed fans and a slap in the face to the die hard fans that made Luca$ the wealthy man he is today.
B00005JOVH|5.0|This movie, although different than the first two X-Men movies, was great because it was X-Men. The first two had a completely different feel from the X-Men franchise because it didn't go enough into the X-Men, instead it went into the characters themselves, X-Men was about working as a team to fight bad guys-and that was what this movie was about. If you liked the first two, then you will enjoy this one; if you disliked the first two because of the difference between the movie and the comics/cartoon, then you will like this one. And what is with you people who are fussing over three characters dying-200 dollars say that THEY DIDN'T DIE!!!! SPOILERS AHEAD: <br /> <br /> <br />1.) If drowning couldn't kill Jean Grey, how could being stabbed by Wolverine kill her? <br />2.) Cyclops died off-screen, which means it is still possible that he could come back-or when Jean Grey comes back as a good person, she could use her powers to bring him back to life <br />3.) Xavier is definitely not dead, and if you think he is, then stay after the credits <br />4.) Magneto got his powers back at he end, which along with the fact that when Beast went toward Leech his hand turned normal but when he walked away it turned back means that the \\"cure\\" was only temporary and all the mutants that were turned, including Rogue, Mystique and Magneto are all going to be back better than ever <br /> <br />I KNOW that none of them are dead
B00008PC2O|5.0|This movie has the coolest action I have ever seen!Rated R for strong sci-fi action,violence,language,and nudity.
B00009RGBS|5.0|Bob Fosse's \\"Chicago\\" is a spectacular and naughty musical.  Two Showgirls (Rene'e Zellweger and Catherine Zeta-Jones) are put in the slammer for each murdering their lovers.  Their crimes of passion are presented as petty, but predictable in the Windy City during the Jazz Age.  The only regrets they have are the gallows, and their only deliverance is a greedy and conceited lawyer (played by Richard Gere).  Even though the women are desperate, they also crave the publicity that oddly gets them help from the papers if they know how to use it.    The drama moves from the prison to the stage where the singers unbear their souls for each key scene.  The numbers and choreography are steamy and smooth, and the story is entertaining.  The performances are good, but don't require any subtlety.  Queen Latifah is particularly fun as the female warden.  The scenes are interspersed well and flow at a good pace.  There is some cynicism in the story, but the playful antics overshadow the darker elements of the movie.

B0009UC810|5.0|This Movie Rocks! Rated R for language,brief mild violence,and some drug use.
0060920084|3.0|This easily could have been a 5-star piece of work, and in fact it started out that way.  Bryson's glimpse of America by car can be funny, instructive, wistful, and a good argument for seeing more of this country.  Unfortunately, he clearly has some mean-spirited baggage to dispose of, because there are few people he encounters along his journey for whom he doesn't express outright contempt.  Overweight women and gay men in particular seem to come in for the lion's share of ridicule.  I lasted up through the phrase \\"mincing little fag\\" before I moved on to something else.
B00005UPO2|5.0|This movie is the greatest action spoof I have ever seen in my life!I recomand this movie to anyone who likes hot shots.Rated PG for sexual humor and brief humorous language.
B00005JOVN|4.0|I have seen the original with Shelley Winters and this movie can stand on it's own.  It doesn't follow the same direction as the original but within 5 minutes you've forgotten about the first movie and just start enjoying all the action.  Not once do you look at your watch to see how much longer the movie has!! Would see again.
0316172324|3.0|Blink is an entertaining read. Lots of interesting stories and anecdotes. It was also a quick read. Nothing too terribly deep or thought provoking to slow down for and contemplate. The actual \\"lessons learned\\" are few and far between, and not well tied together. I did find the book changed my perspective somewhat, but not in a significant way.
B000E1ZK5A|5.0|I thought the acting in this movie was very well done. The people in the movie seemed very real, not the over done, I am in charge, no matter what, if you like it or not, type of acting, usually found in this type of film.<br /><br />Some posters have said that the movie was not true to life. I would guess in a way, it was not, but does it really matter, in a work of fiction.

If I ever produced or directed a film - this would be it.....<br /><br />The musical score is out of this world as are the performances, set designs, choreography, costumes and art direction...<br /><br />It`s a very CinemScoped film aaaaaaaaaaaaaand for the better of it:-)))))))
B000FIMG68|4.0|The show takes some unexpected turns this season. Like when thinking about where the show will go and what was in the hatch, who thought some strange guy named Desmond would be living in it already. I always read message boards where people say the show sucks, yet they are writing huge paragraphs about where the show will go next. Yet they are always wrong.<br /><br />  In this season we meet Desmond who lives in the hatch pressing a button on a computer which to him is very important. When he leaves the hatch, Locke takes over pushing the button. Also after getting back to the island after their raft is destroyed by the Others, Michael, Sawyer and Jin are captured. They aren't taken by the Others though. They were found by other passengers that survived the crash but that crashed on the other side of the island. 4 new main characters are intoduced then. We see that Rose's hsuband Bernard is alive like she said. We meet a former female cop Ana-Lucia (Michelle Rodriguez) and the great Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as a priest named Mr. Eko. There's also Libby who may or may not be what she claims to be \\"we'll probably never learn all the mysteries of her character with how things play out later in the season\\".<br /><br />  In one of the best episodes of the season, we get an episode about those passengers and how most of them were taken by the others. It's also well-done how one of them turns out to be an Other. That episode sorta may get some people to like Ana after she accidently shoots and kills Shannon in the episode before that. That episode with Shannon by the way shows that the writers aren't afraid to kill off characters in episodes that are about them.<br /><br />  Also shortly after Michael comes back to his side of the island, he steals some guns from the hatch and sets out to rescue his son Walt from the Others. Jack, Kate \\"who's not supposed to be there\\", Locke and Sawyer go after him only to find the Others who warn them never to go to that part of the island again. Also Danielle \\"the French chick\\", captures who she claims is an other and hands him over to Sayid. Sayid questions him and says he knows he's an other but Jack won't listen. The man claims to be Henri Gail who got there on an air balloon and that he buried his wife's body there. We also get a clever episode about Hurley where we see him in the nuthouse and he finds out that his bestfriend isn't real. When back on the island Libby gets him to hold back on his appretite. Then he starts seeing his imaginary friend again who he thought he got rid of. He tells Hurley that the island isn't real and that Hurley is really in a coma. He says that if he wants to get back to reality he needs to jump off a cliff. It's up to Libby to try to talk sense into Hurley. In the end of that episode we learn that Libby too was in the nuthouse with Hurley.<br /><br />  Anyway there's tons of other smart moments in this season but I don't want to give too much away. This season may have lost some viewers since it's mostly about mind games between the others and the passengers. It's also about whether or not Locke or anyone else for that matter should even bother pushing the button in the hatch. It's a brainy season that takes your full attention even more than the first season. I think it's only problem is killing off main characters and choosing them all to be women.<br /><br />  In the preview for this season they say \\"they aren't the survivors they thought they were. So we expected some people to die. All the killing to me though seems meaningless. Shannon probably just died because they couldn't think of where to go with her character. While with Libby, they had good ideas for her but never give us her full background after making us interested in her with the Hurley episode. Also when we get the second Ana episode, I thought \\"whether people like her or not she's gonna be here for awhile\\". Then in the same episode...bam!, she's dead. It was shocking tv but it also bugged me since she was growing on me. So in next season they need to give the killing a rest. I also personally hope that Desmond isn't dead and becomes a regular, since he's the best new character next to Mr. Eko.<br /><br />  Plus they give us so many mysteries of the island this season, that it makes me feel like season 3 will be the last. They need more than just passengers stuck on an island with mysterious other people. I'd like to learn that the Others really aren't the big bad of the island and that there's something else worse than them there. Otherwise it's going to be hard to squeeze out more seasons. People are already getting bored with the others, so the show needs more than them. Since this is one of the best shows on tv I'd hate to see it fail due to losing viewers.ince she was growing on me.

B000AL730O|4.0|When I first heard this album I was skipping over certain songs but when I was listening to it in the back ground I was noticing more and more things I liked. Now I don't skip over any of the songs.  Each is unique in it's own way. Give it a chance and hopefully you will see what I see.
B000FP2OPY|4.0|Supernatural is probably the best new show next to Prison Break. It stars Jared Padalecki (House of Wax, Cry Wolf) as Sam and Jensen Ackles (Dark Angel, Smallville season 4) as Dean who are  two brothers who set out to destroy the evil that's all over the world. After their mother was killed by a demon when they were little, it became sort of a family business. Sam wants out though and to go to college. He decides to stick with Dean once his g/f is killed the same way their mother was. Throughout the season they are also curious to where their dad is and why he hasn't called. He too is out hunting demons and evil spirits.<br /><br />  The show isn't always scary and it can be silly how they easily walk on crime scenes and make believe they are cops or anyone else for that matter. Plus there's a little too many earlier episodes that just end with them cruising away in Dean's car listening to classic rock. Still though this is good tv and two leads are always fun together. Even if it isn't scary, it's always entertaining. Jensen Ackles gets a character that he's really good at playing....a sarcastic wiseass with funny one-liners. He was wasted in Smallville as Lana's b/f Jason who was mostly just there to be jealous of her and Clark. Here he actually gets to shine and play a fun kickass character.<br /><br />  While Invasion and Surface were already canceled while they both claimed to have been season finales, I hope this show comes back. Especially with how the season ended. Canelation would be a shame since the WB needs this show since Charmed is gone and since Smallvile was disapointing last season since they focused way way way too much on the super played out Lana/Clark relationship. Then when they put her with Lex things even got worse. So the WB needs Supernatural bad, it's a show that has Buffy or Charmed potential or eventually maybe it could be even better than both.
B000002UC5|5.0|I love this album because I like the raw, live feel of it. It's not your typical production polished McCartney album.  Filled with great guitar and a mixture of instrumentals. I think for an album that was basically thrown together and recorded at home by himself with Linda adding backing vocals also put out to the public right after the \\"Break Up\\", It's worth a few listens.  Like I always say \\"give it a chance\\" especially if you listed and didn't like it maybe you will if you listen now :-)
B000BKVQTS|4.0|I had really high hopes for this film, being an avid fan of both the genre, and the way director Gilliam typically brings such pieces to the screen (Baron Munchausen is still one of my very favorites). It also had a fantastic cast, with Matt Damon and Heath Ledger and Wil and Jake Grimm; Monica Belucci, one of the most beautiful women in the world today, as the Raven Queen; Jonathan Pryce as the mad French General; and Peter Stormare, always an underrated and underestimated actor, as the General's zany master of torture.  <br /> <br />The production value certainly doesn't disappoint. The film was shot in Prague and the forests around the Czech Republic, and those incredible scenes in the forest pretty much reflect the fairy-tale quality of the area. The special effects are great, and the costumes are all lavish, adding great atmosphere to the story.  <br /> <br />The sad thing about this film is that the first half of it is really boring, and the second half quite excellent. Usually films start strong, and then lose it in the middle. This one does just the reverse. There's far too much focus on the French invasion and invaders as a plot device, and it seriously weakens the film. Plus, Matt Damon looks ridiculous in the wig and make-up, and comes across more a pretty boy prostitute from Queer as Folk than a well educated con man.  <br /> <br />The film catches its second wind in the second half, however, when the plot shifts from the issue of French occupation to the mysterious evil living in the forest around Mountbadden.
B00005JOVN|1.0|As a huge huge HUGE fan of the 1972 original, I approached seeing \\"Poseidon\\" - even with its decent cast - like you'd approach a rattlesnake while wearing shorts and no shoes or socks; with total trepidation and fear.  Sure as heck, my fears were very much real.    Comparison between the two in inevitable - and I've even read the original (and brilliant) Paul Gallico novel, which both films heavily diverted from.  But even standing alone, this \\"Poseidon\\" can't - it's just a fairly awful movie by itself.    The S.S. Poesidon is capsized in the middle of the ocean by a \\"rogue wave\\" - turned upside down so those wishing to survive quickly realize they have to work their way through an upside-down world and get to the bottm of the ship (now the top) and somehow get out, in order to survive.  Simple enough premise, but clocking in at only 90 minutes \\"Poseidon\\" doesn't even give you a chance to know or care for the characters; where the first story had some lead-in time before the wave hits, where you got to learn a bit about Rogo and Linda, Susan and Robin, Reverend Scott and the Rosens, etc. - here, the wave hits maybe 15 minutes into the film or so, with so little time given to developing the people in the story, you couldn't really care that much for them when they become endangered or die later.  Richard Dreyfuss plays a weepy, suucidal gay man who is about to hurl himself off the ship himself when he sees the monster wave coming and suddenly wants very much to live; Josh Lucas, as Dylan, is an adventurer/bad boy who gives the best performance in the film (not saying much), and is BY FAR the only truly interesting character to watch; Kurt Russell is the ex-firefighter who is on board with his daughter (Emmy Rossum), and Russell's acting here is so hammy it's almost laughable.  \\"Six Feet Under\\" star Freddy Rodriguez - one of the best, most real performances in the film - is given WAY short-shrift, in more ways then one, in one particular scene that made me mad as helljust watching it.  Kevin Dillon, as a chauvinistic creep, turns in a performance that easily makes you forget the guy's brother was noimnated for an Oscar for \\"Crash\\" so recently - ugh, so much for talent running in the family!    So the ship overturns and Josh Lucas decides he's not staying around and waiting for the water to come in.  Kurt Russell, searching for his daughter in the disco on another floor of the ship, goes with him - but there's no scene where those willing to climb up and out try to get anyone else to come.  Nothing's really said, a few people just start following Josh Lucas and that's it.  Andre Braugher, in maybe THE WORST performance of his career as the Captain, insanely tells everyone to stay where they are and help is coming, etc. - but unlike the original, it takes awhile for water to get into that ballroom ... and by the time it does, you won't give a damn who drowns and who doesn't (and in fact, those trying to survive sort of indirectly cause the room to finally flood, in the first place - how much does THAT suck??).    The obstacles and challenges the motley crew of survivors go through are pretty lame - and yet, somehow, whenever these passengers find a ship's map, or need technical info on how the ship works, someone always either easily reads the map or already knows the answer.  It's amazing, and amazingly stupid.  The only two scenes worth watching are the actual capsizing of the ship (great special effects, period), and at the end, when those who make it do get off (how they get out makes more sense, logically, then the original's ending, as well - when the survivors just showed up at the time the rescuers were cutting through).      But overall the script stinks and the acting is sub-par and Wolfgang Petersen shouldn't have taken it on without giving the project more care.  There's no love or TLC put into making this movie by anyone - worst of all, especially not by the director.
B000ESST6U|5.0|Musically, this recording of \\"Giulio Cesare\\" is surely the best on either CD or DVD.  Until now, my two favorites have been the New York City Opera-Beverly Sills-Norman Treigle production from 1966-67 (which I saw in person) and Rene Jacobs' 1992 recording on Harmonia Mundi.  No longer, however, does one have to sacrifice drama for completeness and original pitch.  Conductor William Christie, the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, and a superb Glyndebourne cast prove that historically informed performance can be even more exciting and absorbing than the shortened, transposed versions from the early days of the Baroque revival.  Sarah Connolly (as Caesar), Danielle de Niese (as Cleopatra), and the other singers and instrumentalists equal or exceed their predecessors in all respects.  (The horns in the opening and closing choruses will just blow you away--pun intended.) <br /> <br />The production portrays Caesar as a 19th century British imperialist, but the conceit is worn lightly and is generally successful.  (I can't explain the anachronistic dirigibles, destroyers, and ocean liner that appear in the harbor of Alexandria at various points.)  In the documentary that accompanies the performance, director David McVicar acknowledges that some of Cleopatra's stage action is inspired by Bollywood films, but even these scenes do not seem inappropriate.  Remember that other serious Baroque and classical operas, such as Serse and Don Giovanni, contain humorous elements. <br /> <br />The two protagonists could not be bettered, either vocally or dramatically.  Sarah Connolly dominates the stage, moves with a masculine swagger, and makes a most effective Caesar.  And it's no wonder that the older man falls for the beautiful, funny, flirtatious, and phenomenally talented 26-year old Danielle de Niese.  Patricia Bardon (as Cornelia, widow of Pompey) and Angelika Kirschlager (as Sesto, Pompey's son) carry the tragic element as they work to avenge the murdered king. <br /> <br />This DVD of \\"Giulio Cesare\\" joins the Handel honor roll, which includes Christie's \\"Hercules,\\" Christophe Rousset's \\"Serse,\\" and Trevor Pinnock's \\"Tamerlano.\\"
0380730405|5.0|This book was very good.From the first page it grabs you, and never lets go.It was very suspenseful, it got me guessing so many times, but I was always wrong.If you are looking to read a good suspenseful book this is IT.
6305558167|5.0|One of the greatest cinematic portrayals of the Arthur legend, \\"Excalibur\\" does a magnificent job of synthesizing different features of this diverse legend. It brings together the mysterious Grail story, the myth of the King's healing sword, and the destructive adultery that threatens the kingdom's unity pretty much seamlessly. If you are going to watch three classic Arthurian films, pick this one, along with the musical romanticism of \\"Camelot\\" and the refreshing humor of Monty Python. The three pretty much provide a comprehensive triangle of approaches. All three films are true, each in its own way, to Thomas Malory and the medieval Arthurian legend.    Be ready for the movie's stylized approach. The knights are never without their armor. The film essentially fetishizes metal. Magicians and Knights alike speak throughout in a rather stilted way, and the violence is made sexier and more appealing than I think it needs to be. There is almost a militaristic aesthetic here, though that's not untrue to the very male focus of the medieval legend. The Wagnerian sound track of course underscores the instability of this aesthetic, which at times almost verges on a Third-Reich glorification of manliness.    As a counterbalance to all that, I'll just say that my favorite performance in this film is the young, exceedingly talented and wonderfully sexy Helen Mirren as Mordred's mother, Morgana.
0140177396|5.0|I first read this book in High School, after a couple of years I decided to read it again. I fell in love with the character Lennie, I really felt bad for him sometimes. The story touched my heart, and you are definetly missing out if you never read it.I'm definitely going to read more of John Steinbecks books, he did a great job with this book.
1594481938|3.0|Nick Hornby is a fine writer and has several novels out there that capture the essence of 25-40 year olds in the world. \\"Fever Pitch\\" for the sport freaks. \\"high Fidelity\\" for music snobs and \\"About a Boy\\" for selfish pricks. \\"A Long way down\\" is more for everyone in that it describes many people. All four of the characters in this book are reprehensible in a way and aren't we all. Hornby does a good job of getting these people to the top of the roof. It's when they come down however that things get interesting. I have never recalled reading a book and thinking to myself \\"god, these people are awful, I wish they would go away\\" but of course they can't. The story is about them. Funny at times, startingly scary at others. You can place yourself to the feelings these folks go through. I'm just not sure in the end if I care that they live or not.
B000000P17|1.0|this pile of crap, like all poser efforts, was created to make money.  after the 91/92 punk revolution via grunge, tons of bands jumped on the bandwagon to cash in. after realizing they had lost much of their fanbase during this period, gnr decided to try to gain some street cred by covering some old alternative songs and a golden oldie, but by doing so they proved just how little musical ability they had.  all the songs they covered were played in the exact format as the original with the exact same instrumental accompinament.  the old boys from la did nothing new and nothing creative.  but i do have to give them credit for one thing they did right, saying in the liner notes to pick up the original records, how true.
1932100385|1.0|Is Campbell deliberately lying to us? Or is he merely suffering from an inability to cast aside his own personal prejudices and present a full and objective presentation of the facts, because the facts conflict with what he wants to believe? <br /> <br />The facts, as anyone who actually peruses the data produced by the study Campbell claims to have drawn his conclusions from (which can be found in Chen J, et al. Diet, life-style, and mortality in China: A study of the characteristics of 65 Chinese counties. Oxford, UK; Ithaca, N.Y. Oxford University Press; Cornell University Press, 1990.), show that consumption of animal protein - especially meat - was associated with a 29% REDUCED risk of mortality, not an increased risk, as Campbell claims. For that matter, the study also shows a reduced risk of cancer in those who consume alcohol and tobacco use. <br /> <br />So where did Campbell get his claims? Who knows. Wherever he got them, it's definitely not from the study he named his book after.
B00004YYWI|5.0|If you are one of the opeth fans who hate screaming than this one might not be for you. They have definantly evolved over the years since making this one. I on the other hand love the distorted vocals as well as his singing voice. I think that the style of screaming on this cd is better than the type on there later cds. However if you can get past the screaming This is a masterpiece. Making masterieces is nothing new for opeth. It seems like they cant pick up the guitar without making a genious riff. The accoustic sections are also shorter but no less brilliant. The song Forrest in October is so awsome that it is quite possible it might end up being my favorite song of all time. That is if it stands up to the test of time. As with all opeth that I have everytime I listen to them they get better. Some thisngs that are obviously different here are mikaels clean vocals are not as refined as later cd's. For the most part the accoustic breakdowns are shorter, and less frequent than in later albums. The melodies themselves dont feel as progressive. To me they sound more like the melodies of norwegian folk metal. Having said that they are still great. And obviously the production is not as clean as later cd's. This might bother some people. I on the other hand listen to mostly black metal, so I have an appreciation for underproduced sounds. It gives this cd more of a underground metal feel, which they were at the time. <br />In Mist She Was Standing 9 Opens with the usual steller Opeth riffs. They deliver the first solo about three minutes in. At about the 5:30 mark the first accoustic breakdown eases in. Man is it beautiful. Underneath it a soft serene electric guitar glides to and fro hyptnotizing the listener into a state of bliss. That is my favorite part of this song. After that the usual series of riffs, solo's and accoustics go by. <br />Under the Weeping Moon 10 This is probably my third favorite song on this cd. At about 3 minutes in the first accoustic breakdownstarts. It is very similar to that of the first song except this one has a darker tone. While the first song had more of a serene feel. There are also some strange fluttering sounds that help to dramatize the aptmosphere. All in all this is an excellent song with many memorable parts. <br />Silhouette 9 A piano instrumental by Anders Nordin the drummer. It is an exquisite piece that winds through my soul everytime I hear it. Somewhat somber, yet beautiful. Its kind of a tease because it would be nice if they would have used this type of stuff more often. Perhaps even mixing it with the accoustics and riffs during the songs. Than again who the hell am I to interfere with the minds of these geniuses. <br />Forest of October 20/10 This is not only the highlight of the cd, but I think it is the highlight of opeths entire career. Definantly in my top 10 metal songs of all time. I could write an entire page describing in detail each and every riff, solo and melody here. The opening riff is slow and full of emotion. My favorite part of this opus is at 4:50 all the way to the end. It is filled with some of the best riffs, solo's, melodies and even some psychadelia. <br />Twilight Is My Robe 10 This one opens and closes with godly riffs and melodic guitar. However the heart and soul of this song is the long accoustic section, that has some of Mikael's best singing on this cd. His vocals were'nt as refined this early in opeths career. They are still great and add a soothing feel to this otherwise metal album. His voice is more of a soft low humming compared to the heavenly vocals he would aquire in later releases. <br />Requiem 6 This low rating in no way cuts down this track. It is some really good accoustic strumming. My problem is that it is rather short, and should have been added to a existing song rather than given its own track. <br />Apostle in Triumph 10 Picks up where the last one left off. A pretty good accoustic intro. Than there is a lull before the song picks upagain. This is probably my second favorite song on here. At 7:25 there is some strange sounding istrument that is really good and gives this song a strange medieval aura. My only complaint with opeth is that I wish they would do more experimenting with different instruments like this. Another example is the celtic sounding melody that appears briefly in \\"Black Rose Immortal\\". <br /> <br />Anyways this is an awsome cd that you have to get if you are a fan. Some may just look at this as the cd opeth got their start with. Now I agree that opeth has become more complex over time, yet this one will always hold a special place with me. <br /> <br /> <br />  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />   <br /> <br /> <br />
B000000WJ2|2.0|It took \\"Talk is Cheap\\" a little while to grow on me, but after awhile I loved it, and listened to it about 100 times.  <br />Not so with \\"Main Offender.\\" I liked the song \\"Wicked as it seems\\" but have very little recollection of the other tunes on the album: they were mostly boring and sounded like they were written on a bad hangover and too much aspirin day. The album made me nauseaus. I love Kieth, but this CD makes a good cup coaster for my coffee table. I have a small dog, so it may be a good frisbee to toss around to the little mutt.
0156027321|4.0|I have to say this is an interesting novel, especially from a philosophical perspective.  It incorporates many different theologies/perspectives, without being too \\"in your face\\" about a solid viewpoint.  It's very Zen, and you can take only what you need (or all of it, if you're so inclined...)  At the very least, it is very thought-provoking.
B00097A5I6|3.0|I would give this 3 1/2 stars, if I was able to. <br /> <br />I always allow some room for nostalgia, as that's a big part of Oasis (for me).  My favorite tracks on this album are The Importance Of Being Idle and Part Of The Queue.  'Part of the Queue' is definately one of my favorite Oasis tracks to date, it's very different from their normal, and I wish they would go deeper in this direction.  All in all, every track on this album is solid and worth a listen to. <br /> <br />Keep in mind I don't listen to the radio and got this as a promo from the store I work at. <br />
B000B8NI6O|4.0|My daughter and her boyfriend invited me to watch this movie with them. I did so, somewhat reluctantly, as it was not the film I would have chosen, even though I had previously seen the two other Austin Powers films and enjoyed them. Well, am I ever glad that I did! It was, without a doubt, the funniest Austin Powers film to date.<br /><br />From the great opening scene to the surprise ending, replete with cameos by Tom Cruise, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kevin Spacey, Danny Devito, the Ozzie Osbourne Family, Steven Spielberg, Britney Spears, Burt Bacharach, Quincy Jones, Nathan Lane, Katie Couric, and John Travolta, the film is a laugh riot. Austin Powers (Mike Myers) still has his mojo amd, together with his gorgeous female sidekick de jour, Foxxy Cleopatra (Beyonce Knowles), sets out to rescue his father, Nigel (Michael Caine), from the evil clutches of the notorious Dutchman, Goldmember (Mike Meyers). To do so, they must go back in time to 1975, the era of disco fever.<br /><br />Fans of Dr. Evil (Mike Myers), Fat Bastard (Mike Myers), Number Two (Robert Wagner), Scot Evil (Seth Green), Frau Farbissina (Mindy Sterling), Basil (Michael York), and Mini-Me (Verne Troyer) will be happy to know that they are all back in this film. Mini-Me very nearly steals the show, and he does this without ever uttering a single word. Fred Savage joins the party as Number Three/The Mole and becomes a running sight gag throughout the film for reasons that will be obvious to the viewer.<br /><br />The only problem in the film is with the character of Goldmember. He is the weak link, as he is simply gross and not particularly funny. What was Mike Myers thinking? Notwithstanding the fact that the title character is pretty much of a zero, however, the film is still hilarious, overall. The plot, what little there is, primarily exists to set up a lot of sight gags, send ups, and a number of very funny scenes. If, however, scatological humor offends your sensibilities, this is definitely not the film for you. If you are not easily offended by the crude and the lewd, then this film will make you laugh up a storm.for you.

B000002GXX|4.0|This is really a funny one to review.  I have grown into a huge Eagles fan, and I have also grown very attached to their first two ablums, Ealges, and Desperado.  I was always told how different the Eagles had begun to sound on this album, and I found that that claim is almost completely false. <br /> <br />At first, this sounds nothing like the older albums.  The first track, which is also the title track, almost sounds disco at times.  Yeah, the tune is groovy, and fun to listen to, but the Bee Gee-esque falsetto in spots is hard to take at first. <br /> <br />But besides that, the albums is not only solid, but very alike the Eagles of old.  The second track, \\"Too Many Hands\\", with Meisner on lead vocals, sounds like it could have easily been on Desperado.  \\"Lyin' Eyes\\", the big ballad of the album, is classic Henley/Frey.  It's easy acoustic sound and laid back vocals conjure up images of that desert sunset on the first album. <br /> <br />The jewel of this album is the Felder/Henley penned \\"Visions\\".  It's a driving rocker, not like the older ones like \\"Out of Control\\" or \\"Chug All Night\\" but this new, straight forward sound is certainly welcome. <br /> <br />So what's the last word?  This album is a little different from the preceeding three, but at times sounds better.  It has the same country twang, acoustic calm, and grooving rock as Eagles and Desperado, but isn't full blown country-rock-pop like Hotel California.  Definitly among their top three.
B00005JOVH|3.0|\\"X-Men: The Last Stand\\" is lots of fun, if you don't think too much about it. The effects are pretty-well done -- bridges coming off their moorings, guys shooting lasers from their eyeballs, people disintegrating or running through walls, etc.<br /><br />The basic story is this: a \\"cure\\" has been found for the mutations that gave rise to the X-Men. Evil villain Magneto (Ian McKellen) is trying to destroy the cure and raise a mutant army to do goodness knows what. Good guy Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) doesn't want the cure destroyed, for equally unclear reasons. The ensuing face-off is completely confusing and pointless, although very fun to watch. Lots of people, cars and houses getting levitated with mind control; lots of flaming, flying cars and lots of general mayhem. In the midst of this, characters are still trying to come to terms with their \\"talents\\" and wondering whether to take the cure and become normal. Scattered love interests add fiery arcs to this celestial fireball of a movie.<br /><br />\\"X Men III\\" is great if you just want to have a good time and not think too much about plot consistency and plausibility -- like why superheros need to walk \\"en masse\\" to the their targets (rather than fly teleport or whatever) or why the government doesn't just \\"cure\\" all the bad guys rather than transport them overland in vulnerable trucks, etc.<br /><br />But the mutants are fun -- one guy has porcupine quills, another shoots darts from his hands -- and Juggernaut (my fave) -- rolls through just about anything. Though I still can't get my mind around Kelsey Grammer's \\"Beast\\" who looks more like a big blue Furby than anything dangerous. Check your inner critic at the door and have a good time.
B000002GGO|5.0|Simple Minds came closer than ever before to all-out rocking on this album. They do rock here, but they still exhibit skillfully played musical shadings. Highly inventive, underrated guitarist Charlie Burchill steps forward and rocks, but not without his rhythmic subtlety. At the time, this album was criticized for being poorly mixed and sounding muddy, but I quite like that thick din of sound. I haven't heard the remaster, so I hope they haven't botched it.<br /><br />\\"Up on the Catwalk\\" kicks things off with rumbling thunder and haunting keyboards. One of SPARKLE's best songs despite borrowing the already overdone U2 theme \\"I'll be there tonight.\\" Singer Jim Kerr delivers a fantastically wordy vocal that moves into improvisation towards the end of the song.<br /><br />\\"Book of Brilliant Things\\" is good but not my favorite, although it grows on you with that catchy guitar hook.<br /><br />\\"Speed Your Love To Me\\" and \\"Waterfront\\" are the album's glorious centerpieces. Simply brilliant and uplifting (and totally rockin'!)<br /><br />\\"East at Easter\\" is a slow burner that builds with subtle intensity.<br /><br />\\"Street Hassle\\" is one of Lou Reed's best songs and SM actually improve on the original, giving it a smoother, more organic quality. Fantastic orchestration. And, let's face it, Kerr has a much better voice than Reed. Lou must've approved because he sings (or, rather, speaks) on SM's \\"This Is Your Land\\" from STREET FIGHTING YEARS a few years later.<br /><br />\\"White Hot Day\\" - not the best, but still a good song with musings about \\"time.\\"<br /><br />\\"'C' Moon Cry Like A Baby\\" is another favorite. This one has an infectious swing.<br /><br />\\"The Kick Inside Me\\" is the hardest rocking song on the album.<br /><br />\\"Shake Off The Ghosts\\" is floating serenity. Keyboardist Michael McNeil, so integral to the whole album, really takes this instrumental to a place of wonderment. A beautiful way to finish.<br /><br />It's wonderful to hear an album that rocks without banging you over the head with feedback, distortion and the like as so many bands do today. People who call this the start of their U2-style bombastic phase are really missing the point.that rocks without banging you over the head with feedback, distortion and the like as so many bands do today.

B00005JOFQ|5.0|Recently in my film study class, we were instructed each to write an essay demonstrating how modern film industry has degraded society. So I rented Brokeback Mountain, since I thought it would be an excellent film for the title. <br /> <br />It sure is, but not in the way I anticipated <br /> <br />After watching the film, I am convinced that, even though most movies today are degrading our society and culture, masterpieces like these will always demonstrate humanity at its finest. So I wrote an entire essay countering my professor's view on movies. <br /> <br />When I got the paper back on Thursday, I was surprised to have received an A+. The professor thinks I make a good argument, and my ideas are provocative. I wish I can take the credit for this grade, but I owe it all to Ms. Anne Proulx and Mr. Ang Lee and their masterpiece Brokeback Mountain. <br /> <br />Some of you may not like this film, but you got to admit, the film demonstrate all sorts of emotion, and the very concept of this movie is thought provoking. I suspect that the Academy may be influenced by society pressure in choosing Crash over Brokeback Mountain for Best Pictures, but the quality, and the messages of this film will never change, both to me, and to the world.
B0000793Z9|5.0|On this album, Simple Minds evolved from their brilliant underground electro-art-rock to, well, more accessible versions of the same thing. Although I love their previous phase, the band sounds more relaxed and natural on NEW GOLD DREAM (a bit like the change from Tears for Fears' THE HURTING to SONGS FROM THE BIG CHAIR).<br /><br />Every song here is great except I really can't take \\"Promised You a Miracle\\" (the biggest hit, no less) which sounds like annoying, cheesy disco to me (obviously an unorthodox opinion, but to each his own). Typically, I skip it. \\"New Gold Dream\\" and \\"Glittering Prize\\" are also disco-tinged, but I like those two a lot. They're very up-beat with great melodies.<br /><br />\\"Someone, Somewhere in Summertime\\" is one of those magical songs that warms the heart and, for me at least, evokes an indescribable feeling of nostalgia, even when I first heard it. I also really like the more \\"relaxed\\" songs like \\"Hunter and the Hunted\\" featuring a frantic-fingered Herbie Hancock (!) and the hypnotic \\"Big Sleep.\\" \\"King is White and in the Crowd\\" is also hypnotic and dreamy.<br /><br />The album's sound fits perfectly into the time it was made (1982), yet it doesn't sound dated, at least not in any negative way. If this is a quasi-disco album, so be it. Jim Kerr could be seen as letting his soul shine through a bit more on this one (which he continued to do more and more on subsequent albums). The band follows suit; everyone seems to have lightened up for this one. I'll always go back to this album.<br /><br />(this review pertains to the original issue - haven't heard the remaster)
B0000AQS0F|5.0|First, I've watched a few of Joss Whedon's other franchises on an irregular basis, so I wasn't a fan of his per se, before watching Serenity.  Then I watched Serenity, and found it to be a great film with very strong characters-which is the most important factor in a good story anyway. <br /> <br />Naturally when I found out that Serenity basically was the epilogue of Firefly, I just had to see Firefly.  It was like watching 14 more one hour movies of Serenity!  Or perhaps Serenity is just Firefly #15?  What makes Firefly special to me is that all the episodes have a very, very strong story and a consistency that you simply don't find in Babylon 5 or the first two Star Trek shows (TOS, TNG).  I'm not talking characters referening previous episodes here either-it's simply the intensity and quality of the writing that is noteworthy.  With other TV shows, you typically get some or a lot of good stories during a season intermixed by some average and maybe even a bad episode (see Grey 17 Is Missing from Bablyon 5 for example), but never all of the episodes are good.  Firefly is the exception here.   <br /> <br />While the chances of Firefly being resurrected are quasi-null, I hope more Serenity films are made and I'd like to see Mal admit he has feelings for Inara-to her, that is, before Joss Whedon decides to actually, formally end this great sci-fi show (supposedly a Serenity Trilogy could happen based on various interviews with the cast and crew).  The unresolved romantic tension is exciting, but killing me at the same time... <br /> <br />Mal seems harder, and colder, in Serenity than he does in Firefly, but that seemed like the only change I found as far as character behavior goes. <br /> <br />This is a show-and a movie (Serenity), not to be underestimated.  If you love good science fiction with a unique western style, this is it.

0375507256|4.0|Mitchell is brilliant, certainly. The book is a Chinese box of six stories, set in different eras and locations, each in a different genre and told in a different voice. The first five are taken to their half-way point, broken off, then resumed in reverse order after the completion of the sixth. All are enjoyable, and Mitchell's versatility of style is uncanny. But the connections between the stories are trivial (less than in Joan Silber's [[ASIN:039332687X IDEAS OF HEAVEN]], say), and one looks in vain for some overarching philosophical theme to connect them, over and above the structural one. I became frustrated waiting for payoffs that never came, and it was harder to pick up the thread of each story the further one got from its opening section.<br /><br />I suspect that individual readers' responses to the book will depend on their literary tastes generally. Those that admire structural ingenuity for its own sake will have few problems. But others will find themselves responding to certain genres more than others, and this will affect their perception of the rhythm of the book. I, for example, am not a fan of science fiction, and thus found the central 180 pages quite hard going; perhaps this blunted my appreciation of the outermost stories when they resumed. But the first three tales each appealed to me in different ways: the first (which few other readers seem to have liked) in much the same manner as Matthew Kneale's marvelous [[ASIN:038549744X ENGLISH PASSENGERS]]; the second about an English musician and thus very close to home; and the third a splendid piece of whistle-blower political fiction. I would have enjoyed reading any of the three at normal novel length . . . and I am not sure that they would have lost much, if anything, by being removed from Mitchell's overelaborate surrounding structure.
055321263X|5.0|I read this book in one day, a day where no classes were attended, no phone calls were taken, and no visits made. I cooked and ate my food with it in hand, and sometimes damned my inability to read faster, I was so eager to find out what was going to happen next.  <br /> <br />\\"The Woman in White\\" is not just one of the most engaging and gripping Victorian novels I have ever read, it is one of the most engaging and gripping novels of all time. Collins creates vivid, memorable characters (ranging from brave intelligent Marian to the surprising and sinister Count Fosco) who are engaged in a plot that twists and turns like nothing else. There are so many unexpected, even shocking incidents, and Collins moves between them with exactingly precise yet graceful and beautiful prose. Not only that, his narrative style, which moves from character to character, allows for fantastic comic interludes which break up the drama (the chapter from the point of view of the hypochondriac uncle is gut-bustingly funny). <br /> <br />A couple of people I know, who are generally not fond of 19th century literature, loved this book. I have never met someone who has not been charmed by it. I strongly urge anyone and everyone to read it.
B0007XT7V8|4.0|<br />Gasoline is a really good album by theory of a deadman its a lot more solid all round than there debut and a lot better. Santa Monica is the stand out track for me on this album its a true classic song by Theory, also the brilliant hello lonely, me and my girl and say goodbye standout has well on the album. <br />Theory of a deadman really took me by surprise with this album I really couldn't believe how good it was when I heard it. <br />They sound so different to there debut album, which was a good album, but out the two this one's the best in my opinion.  <br />I cant help but think theory of a deadman are one of the most underrated bands out there at the moment which is a shame because there are a great band. Great Album <br />
1592400876|5.0|\\"Eats, Shoots and Leaves\\" is a lauded book, for all the right reasons. In a world where accurate communication and clear self-expression is becoming increasingly rare, and where grammar and spelling seem more and more like antiquated notions, we NEED people like Lynne Truss to speak out. Yes, her style of humour is sometimes sharply sarcastic, but her grasp of the subject matter is complete, and her explanations of various grammatical concepts are both thorough and easy to understand. It seems popular to point out obscure errors made by Truss. Whether or not these criticisms are accurate (some are, some aren't), the fact remains that, when it comes to functional grammar, the lessons and lectures provided by this book can't be beat.     It's sure to anger people who somehow feel that having poor grammar is a RIGHT and how DARE this woman MOCK them, but for people who sincerely want to improve and who appreciate a laugh, or for people who merely want their \\"inner stickler\\" reinforced even while their funny bone is being tickled, this book is tops --- unless, through some strange inner working of pride and spite, you have the compulsion to try and knock Ms. Truss off her pedestal by whinging about hyphenating \\"zero tolerance\\" or her not getting the sexual innuendo of the title. Sheesh.
0143034901|4.0|The prose of this novel is magnificent!  (It is a superb translation.)  This book, while being both a mystery and a shadowy story, is a mystical journey into intermingled souls.
B000F1IQN2|4.0|The best thing about Munich is that it is believeable.  Even knowing that it's based on a true story -- built from accounts, according to Spielberg, which could not be discredited -- I half-expected a James Bond over-the-top action/adventure.  I should have known that Spielberg would not stoop to cheap gimmicks and corny action cliches.<br /><br />More than the action is the drama.  The characters have to confront the evil that was done in Munich in 1972.  The are forced to reflect on whether they're right in their response to that evil.  Without melodrama, Spielberg brings these issues to the surface, plays them out through credible interaction between the various characters.<br /><br />The lone drawback of this movie is that it tends to drag at the end. It never gets boring, but it seems like some fat could possibly have been trimmed out somewhere.  This is a minor point as there's nothing in the movie that obviously does not fit.

B00003CXIP|5.0|By the time my older children were oh, around 8 and up, this movie had been released on VHS (that's what we all had back then) and also played relatively often on TV. This release to TV resulted in the necessary removal (rather comically is some cases-especially during the \\"pie-eating contest\\"!)) of the \\"swears\\". Therefore my kids could see it! They are now 24, 22 and 18: they are not young adults who only care about cellphones or whatever another previous reviewer said, and they remember this movie fondly. We always laugh when we see \\"Verno\\" (and his comb, of course) on TV (actor Jerry McConnell- wow, has he changed!) This movie has a universal appeal to kids and grown-ups alike: issues of loss & grief, abuse, isolation,post traumatic stress,parent's indifference & apathy and of course, hair issues in case your photo is suddenly taken for the newspaper.  This movie is at once hilarious and heartbreaking and I'll bet Steven King is thrilled that this director (and actors, and everyone else involved in this production)actually \\"got it\\".(unlike the majority of his wonderful books where the movie turned out to be something less than wonderful, \\"Carrie\\" being one major exception of course.)  This movie is a masterpiece and, if I could just find a copy somehow without the \\"swears:, I would love my [...] daughter to see it. So, if you haven't seen it, treat yourself to this movie. It is thought-provoking and wonderful.Thanks for reading! Faith
B00009MGGI|5.0|I found it amazing that this set has not been brought more obviously to the attention of the American viewing public, at least those of the PBS ilk. I only found it thanks to a recommenation by Netflix (which alone makes that service worthwhile).  The HOC trilogy is about a ruthless MP who manipulates the system that he is supposed to serve towards his own ends, to say nothing of the people around him. The trilogy happens to play out in decending order in terms of excellence of the script, the first being easily the best. The bite of the satire is sharpened by the device of having Francis Urquet break through the fourth wall to address the audience, often in front of other characters. Face-framing close-ups are used which accentuates the man's menace. And it works because its so bleakly funny and black. Proof that political cynicism as part and parcel of govenment was fully in flower a long time ago.
B00007JVBI|4.0|Personally, I liked Shaking Paper, Good Woman, and Werewolf.  Werewolf is a beautiful song because its rendered in such a slow melodic way that allows for the lyrics to be shuffled into imagery very vividly.  Its like imagining a silent movie from the 20s playing, only its this song in the background.  Good Woman, on the other hand, offers that heart-wrenching pain of leaving a person you hold so close.   <br /> <br />Basically, the songs on this CD are more than the sum of their parts.  Its well worth the adventure to see what you like about it.
B00005JO20|4.0|I just watched King Kong on widescreen dvd.  I really wanted to give Jackson's King Kong 5 stars but can't quite get there from here.  4.5?  The first 30 - 40 minutes are somewhat tiresome (I'm being generous... we get too much detail.  It goes on too long and it's boring).  Once we get to Skull Island things pick up.  Boy do things pickup!  To start with, the indigenous people on Skull (Mordor) Island are downright scary, it's like the Mau Mau Uprising meets Night of the Living Dead.  Disturbing imagery!<br /><br />The Kong \\"character\\" is incredible as are all the creatures on the island.  His range of emotions is amazing - prediction:  this Kong will never be outdone.  My only problem with Jackson's movie is that the action scenes are so over the top in places that they become laughable.  I actually found myself laughing watching Naomi Watts digital stunt double being thrown around from hand-to-hand like a rag doll during the T-Rex battle.  Can you say whiplash whiplash whiplash whiplash whiplash?  There is no way a human being could survive all that tossing around and then stand up.  Every bone in her body would have been broken.  The scene with the brontosaurus/raptor stampede is fun but it's still way too over the top.  I just couldn't suspend belief THAT far - it went from exciting to ridiculous.<br /><br />In summary.  Great effects, great acting (Naomi Watts manages to pull off caring about Kong without getting corny, as in Jessica Lange's prior take on this character), great cinematography, great directing, great scenes, but the action scenes are just too much in some places and this takes a little away from an otherwise brilliant remake.  Also, this film was at least 30 minutes longer than it needed to be.  I'm reminded of Stephen King's over-indulgence in details details details and books that are a couple of hundred pages longer than they needed to be.<br /><br />Love yer work Peter Jackson.  Tone it down a smidgeon next time.
6305308659|5.0|I remember that the first time I saw this movie, I was about 12.  I thought that the idea of two teenagers from the present living in a black and white TV show eventually turning things into color was a fun little premise.  However, I could not even begin to grasp all the symbolism behind the events taking place in that \\"pleasant\\" little town.  Upon further viewings, I realized how well-made and almost scary this movie is.  David (Tobey Maguire) and Jennifer (Reese Witherspoon) may be twins, but they're polar opposites.  David is a quiet introvert while Jennifer is a popular girl and (eventually) a self-proclaimed slut.  They come from a bit of a broken home, and they each have their own way of escaping their chaotic lives.  Jennifer has sex while David takes solice in Pleasantville, a 1950's show about a town where nothing bad ever happens.  Ever.  It never rains, the basketball team always wins, everyone rolls perfect games when bowling, and every family is completely functional.  The father works hard to support his wife and kids, the wife stays home and cooks, cleans, and raises the kids, while the kids do well in school.  There is no sex.  No one knows what it is, and even husbands and wives sleep in separate beds.  There is no literature.  All the books are blank.  No one does anything wrong.  Pleasantville is very much in league with shows such as Ozzie and Harriet, Father Knows Best, and Leave it to Beaver, all of which taught the values that every American should have.  When people refer to \\"the good ol' days\\", it seems as if they are actually referring to these shows, which portray a way of life that never did nor could actually exist.  One night, David plans on watching a Pleasantville marathon, but Jennifer wants to watch something else.  A fight over their remote leads to its destrcution, but soon a mysterious TV repairman (Don Knotts) shows up and offers them a retro-looking control to use.  Another fight breaks out, but this time, the pair somehow getsucked into the world of Pleasantville (the film never explains how the remote works, but, then again, no explanation is required; it has no place in the film).  David, now impersonating Bud Parker, and Jennifer in the role of Bud's sister Mary-Sue, are now supposed to live out the lives of their characters.  It's most likely that the repairman did this in order to get the two to get along better.  David immediately tries to convince Jennifer to preserve the way of life that the other residents of Pleasantville adhere to, but Jennifer decides that she ought to inject a little bit of 90's culture into what she considers to be a dull existence.  After all, wouldn't paradise get boring after a while?  What is life without the unpredictability that keeps things interesting?  Soon Jennifer's meddling begins to create a ripple effect which causes small changes here and there.  Suddenly, the basketball team loses their first game ever.  The books in the libraries begin filling in with text, and random people and objects begin being colorized.  At first, doctors and politicians attribute the coloration to a minor disease that is spreading, but isn't life-threatening.  Thinking that it will \\"go away on its own\\", everyone initially writes off the changes as a minor hiccup in the overall pleasantness of the town.  Then Jennifer drops a bombshell on the town.  She introduces sex to the town.  Teenagers and adults, who had all previously been chaste as children, discover the new activity and cannot get enough of it.  Eventually, entire people change from bleak black and white to vibrant technicolor.  Though not everyone is happy with these \\"unpleasant\\" changes.  The mayor of Pleasantville (J.T. Walsh) finds the changes upsetting, and he tries to convene the \\"true\\" citizens of Pleasantville to find a way to deal with the problem of the \\"colored\\" people.  Eventually, in reacting to the unpleasantness of rock 'n' roll, books (including Huck Finn and Catcher in the Rye, two of themost frequently banned books in America), sex, and color, the remaining pleasant citizens cause riots, intolerance, and many other true forms of what can be called unpleasantness, if one were to put it lightly.  The film deals with numerous themes and parallels.  The idea of the blandness of paradise starts things off, leading to dealing with personal change.  Towards the end of the film, Nazism and American racism against blacks is displayed through the way the black and white citizens treat the colored citizens.  While the film is mostly seen as a fun little sci-fi, if interpreted in certain ways, it can be seen as a horrific reminder/warning of what happens when intolerance takes over.  I find Pleasantville to be a highly underrated film.  While the premise seems a little cheesy, it is well written and acted.  The metaphors are all done very well, and the dialogue is wonderful through the use of ultra-saccarine 50's TV euphamisms (swell and such) juxtaposed with David and Jennifer's 90's lingo.  Both leads do well with their roles, while the supporting cast, including William H. Macy, Joan Allen, and Jeff Daniels perform amazingly as well.  This movie definitely is not for everyone, but I encourage everyone to check it out at some point, if only to view it as a study of society.
B000F0UV0E|2.0|I'm afraid this struck me as too much of the same old country that we hear from others.  I did not find Harris' voice carrying that extra edge that pulls me into the pathos of her songs with the echoey sounds here.  It seems they both left behind the striking qualities that made them stand out from the crowd.  Sorry to agree with the official review, but I do.
B00001OH7P|5.0|Of all the Bowie albums,,,ehhh...cd's out, and all the different obsessions and variances in his music and art; of all the hidden messages and obscure references; of all the melodies and dance rhythms, back beat, up beat, down beat...THIS IS THE PLACE TO START, the Essential Bowie.   <br />First time listeners of David Bowie should really look no further than Ziggy Stardust.

B00003W8NM|5.0|Still the only movie that, for me, describes the experiences of my generation-our values dictated by consumerism and badly in need of violent negation in order to bring us back to ourselves. It's also VERY funny, very stylish, mischevious and the acting (Bonham Carter just gets better every time you watch it) is transfixing. Makes Fincher's follow-up (Panic Room) seem kind of empty.
B000F4PD7G|5.0|I'm uncertain why this film hasn't been released in the United   States. However, this film adaptation of the ancient, beautiful, epic tale, Beowulf, was a blockbuster in Canada, Iceland, and the rest of Europe. It can be purchased, nonetheless, on Amazon.ca (Canada's Amazon.com).
B0002XL35G|5.0|Harry Dean Stanton and Nastassja Kinski are two of my very favourite actors; there are few who are as earthy and 'real' as they. As always, their acting is unparalled, which I think is due to the fact that they are earthy and real.<br /><br />In this movie you will be taken on a journey unlike any other and one which I have experienced personally in very similar circumstances so I may be a little bias but only a tad, the movie is excellent in its' own right.<br /><br />This movie is not for every one (there are many dead heads out there) but in any case it deseves 5 stars for it's brilliance and uniqueness. It is refreshing to see 'something different' and not the usual same ol'. This is truly a work of art. If you know excellence when you see it, you MUST SEE this movie.<br /><br />Every one else has given you the story line, I just want to tell you just how brilliant it is. I LOVE THIS MOVIE. The sound track is also brilliant and fitting. I own both: dvd movie and the soundtrack.<br /><br />A movie you must see before you die.<br /><br />Love from me in Melbourne.
B00005N83M|1.0|when i first heard her Play, I thought it's gotta be a good R&B-Dance album overall, but when i've listened to it couple of times it just grew on me and....i hate it.

So if you want a perfect example of bad singing and horrible songs, this album is for you. Enjoy & Courrage!!!!
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I actually avoided this movie while in theatres due to my undying loyalty to the 1996 BBC version with Colin Firth. Well, my friends, this is not exactly better, but breathtaking, extremely well written, directed & produced. And if you think/thought Matthew MacFayden is no Colin Firth...  just watch it.  He says more with his beautiful blue eyes and facial expressions than has ever been spoken (in my humble opinion).  It is better in some ways, obviously gets to the point MUCH more quickly without losing all the development of the family characters - and the ending, OH!!!!!!  For me, though I LOVE the '96 adaptation, the ending kind of just didn't get it for me.  This one will satisfy that for you (I couldn't breath!!) <br />Just when you think it can't get any better...

B000FMADWS|4.0|I have been interested, as a pro-Republican partisan, in the Spanish Civil War since I was a teenager.  What initially perked my interest, and remains of interest, is the passionate struggle of the Spanish working class to create its own political organization of society, its leadership of the struggle against Spanish Fascism and the romance surrounding the entry of the International Brigades, particularly the American Abraham Lincoln Battalion of the 15th Brigade, into the struggle.    Underlying my interests has always been a nagging question of how that struggle could have been won by the working class. The Spanish proletariat certainly was capable of both heroic action and the ability to create organizations that reflected its own class interests i.e. the worker militias and factory committees. Of all modern working class uprisings after the Russian revolution Spain showed the most promise of success. Russian Bolshevik leader Leon Trotsky noted in one of his writings on Spain that the Spanish proletariat at the start of its revolutionary period had a higher political consciousness than the Russian proletariat in 1917.     That analysis calls into question the strategies put forth by the parties of the Popular Front, including the Spanish Communist Party- defeat Franco first, and then make the social transformation of society. Ernest Hemingway in his novel For Whom the Bells Toll weighs in on that question. Whatever value the novel had or has as a narrative of a small slice of the Spanish events one must look elsewhere to discovery the causes of the Republican defeat.    Ernest Hemingway most definitively was in love with Spain and always lurking just below the surface was his love affair with death. That combination placed in the context of the Spanish Civil War of 1936-39 makes for an explosive, dramatic tale. The hero is an American, Robert Jordan, aka Ernest Hemingway, of fizzy politics but a desire to help the Spanish people. Additionally Jordan, if expediency demands it, is willing to face danger and death at the command of the Communist-dominated International Brigades (although it is not always clear whether he is a Lincoln Brigade volunteer or a freelancer). Hemingway's critique of the Stalinist domination of the military command and therefore authors of the military strategy that led to defeat at times overwhelms the story. His skewering of Andre Marty, leader of the International Brigades, also has that same effect. In short, Hemingway believed that 'outside forces' meddling in Spanish affairs led to death for Jordan and disaster for the Spanish people. Well, nobody expects nor is it mandatory for a novelist to be politically astute or correct. Here Hemingway joins the crowd    The one subject that Ernest Hemingway seemed consistently to excel at was the telling of war stories. And whatever else might be true of For Whom the Bell Tolls it is preeminently a war story. A classic war romance if you have also seen the movie treatment of the book starring Gary Cooper and Ingrid Bergman. It might be a male thing, it might be a Hemingway thing, or it might be that the nature of war lends itself to dramatic tension that holds a story together. Today, in some literary circles, it is not considered politically correct to laud works by such dead, white males as Hemingway but the flat out truth is that the man could write. If his work stands outside the current canon of American literary efforts then something is wrong with the new canon.    To make matters worst the current leftist-oriented literary establishment, grizzled, hard-bitten battle-tested warriors that they are, has not been the only force that has taken aim at Hemingway's head. At the time of publication in 1940 the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Battalion, those who actually fought in Spain and the various Communist Parties throughout the world were unhappy with the novel. Why? Hemingway was too harsh on the deficiencies of the Communists, the International Brigades and the Republican forces in general. Above I mentioned that writers were not expected to be politically astute. That is one thing. But to say that Hemingway was essentially sabotaging the exiled Republican efforts to aid the refugees by the thrust of his novel is also politically wrong. The man did materially and militarily aid the Republican side (financially sponsoring volunteers and ambulances, as well as reportage). That accrues to his honor. In short, Hemingway's writings-yes. Hemingway's politics no
B000EYK4GW|5.0|Dumbo has no big ambitions in story or art and was made with a mediocre budget.  Still, it's a timeless classic with a story that resonates just as effectively today as when first released in 1941.  Its charming characters will still bring audiences to tears and the music will stay with you long after the lights come back up.  This film is simply bursting with heart and soul.<br /><br />Is there anyone who doesn't cry when Mrs. Jumbo, locked in her cell, cuddles and swings her Jumbo Jr.?  The sequence is a masterpiece.  Combining the psychological pain we feel at the separation of parent and child, a beautifully touching song and warm, subtle character animation.  But the truly amazing thing is that tucked into this unassuming little story is the highly imaginative pink elephant sequence, the greatly comic \\"When I See An Elephant Fly\\" and a few nods to German expressionism.  Quite a combination, and proof that Dumbo is much more than just a distraction for the kiddies.<br /><br />Dumbo was not given the extensive restoration that Snow White was given a few years ago and a bit of dust and scratches are seen throughout the film.  But this is still the best the film has looked on home video.  In fact, it appears to be the same transfer from the 60th Anniversary DVD of 2002.  Even the menu screens are the same.  All that's been added are a few games for the younger set and a music video for \\"Baby Mine\\"performed by Jim Brickman and Kassie DePriva.  Not included from the 60th Anniversary release are a music video for \\"Baby Mine\\"  performed by Michael Crawford, two trailers and a segment from \\"The Reluctant Dragon\\" that explains how the Casey Junior voice was achieved.  Thankfully, the highly informative commentary by John Canemaker is included on this new release as well.<br /><br />Also on this DVD are two animated shorts that pre-date Dumbo yet mirror some of its themes, and a 15 minute \\"documentary\\" that's really just myriad Disney alumni heaping praise on Dumbo.  It's always good to hear great things about Dumbo but something a bit more in-depth and behind the scenes would have been better.<br /><br />All in all this is a very solid release of Dumbo that should not be passed up by anyone who missed out on the 60th anniversary release.  Its a film that the entire family will enjoy for many years to come.

Why? Hemingway was too harsh on the deficiencies of the Communists, the International Brigades and the Republican forces in general. Above I mentioned that writers were not expected to be politically astute. That is one thing. But to say that Hemingway was essentially sabotaging the exiled Republican efforts to aid the refugees by the thrust of his novel is also politically wrong. The man did materially and militarily aid the Republican side (sponsoring volunteers and ambulances). That accrues to his honor. In short, Hemingway's writings- yes. Hemingway's politics no <br /> <br />
B00070Q7VO|5.0|I first heard of Michael Bubl&eacute; from a friend of mine and I was immediately hooked and had to go out and buy this CD.  His style is at once a throwback and completely new.  He evokes Sinatra on \\"A Foggy Day,\\" \\" Save The Last Dance For Me\\" is a swinging number that always make me get up to dance and \\"Home\\" is just beautiful.  This is a stronger, more assured album from his first release.<br /><br />I'm sure, in the years to come, Michael Bubl&eacute; will become a major force in music.  People are looking for something different yet assuring and Michael Bubl&eacute; is it.

B00000634J|5.0|I'm a huge Beatles fan, and recently I've started to get into their solo work. When it came to choosing a John Lennon solo CD to buy, I really wanted to get a greatest hits cd so that I'd be getting his best work. I'd only heard of the well-known hits \\"Imagine\\" and \\"Give Peace a Chance\\", which are classics. When I bought this CD my ears were opened to a whole new side of Lennon, along with his best music. All these songs are standouts, but my personal favorites are \\"Instant Karma\\" and \\"Watching the Wheels\\". I recommend this CD to any Beatles fan who wants to branch out into their solo work, but don't necessarily have the money or time to spend on each of their solo cds. This CD is constantly in my stereo, and it's something any Beatle fan would love, and at a great price too!
B000EWBKM6|5.0|What are we to do now that such a controversial, yet heart-warming and hilarious show is off the air. I will truly miss the joy and laughter I experienced each Thursday and will do this knowing it can never be replaced. Goodbye to Jack and his dimwit egotism. So long to Karen and her boozed up superiority. Farewell to Will and his anal retentive sarcasm. Good Night to Grace and her care free quirkiness. It has been memorable.
B00005JNX0|1.0|They call this the biggest film of the year, HA! When they <br />say Hollywood's running out of ideas, they're right! In the <br />previews they made it look funnier than a PIXAR film.

Not only do I read it to him, but I also use the book to teach him colors and the sounds that the animals make. Also this book reads like a song...it has a rhythm which I believe really captures my son's attention.  Even thouth he can not repeat all the words clearly but he tries to read with me using the rhythm.

Emmylou Harris's voice is always carries that hauntingly familiar edge while Mark plays incredible music with stellar harmonies.  An excellent team who are both talented and passionate in an industry that has gone stale.<br /><br />Because these two have been together for so long it helps their song strategies.  Excellent songs with wonderful arrangements make this CD a must-have.  Jaci Rae
0671015206|5.0|This book really gave me a clear understanding of the real millionaires. They are not the jet setting, cavaviar eating people we would suppose. Most of the people in the huge houses with the sports cars are not wealthy, they are high income earners who are leveraged deeply in debt, or business owners who have huge cash flow but low net worth. The high income/low net worth people work very,very hard and spend a lot of money and most of the time end up bankrupt at some point in there lives. In contrast the real millionaires may live next door to you, have a nice middle sized house that is paid for, drives a paid off car, has been married only once, and believes strongly in investing and staying out of debt.You can not tell these people are millionaires because they live like regular middle income America, except they spent 30 years making great financial decisions while their neighbors spend all their money on trips,new cars, bigger houses, and consumer debt. The book is filled with the specific information gathered from the millionaires they met with and surveyed. the results shocked the authors.This book changed the way I looked at the truly wealthy.
0060574216|4.0|I read this book, when I am feeling that I am not understanding my spouse. What a relief. when ever I try to help my wife, she used to get angry , that used to upset.  Author nicely explains with simple examples how to diffuse this type of situations with 'Men - No fixing only validation, women - No critcism with a hope to helping '. Like this there are hundreads of techniques.  There are hundreads of tips like that in this book. When I tried to explain people, some people are not open to change, even resistant to listen. Except this book it is highly informative.
B000000OMB|5.0|Asia was formed as a 'supergroup' of talented musicians, similar to Led Zeppelin. The results here are outstanding. I can (and have) listened to this album over and over. It reminds me how bad todays' (post-mtv) popular 'music' is.
0451169514|2.0|I've read most of Stephen King's books (though admittedly I've avoided all of his post-car accident books like a plague), and as far as scariness goes, \\"It\\" rates pretty high up towards the top. However, the scary parts are few and far between, and if you're initially put off by the absurd length of the book, trust your instinct and don't read it.  <br /> <br />\\"It\\" smacks of a tome that desperately needed the chopping hand of an editor. I think at some point in the early 80's, King had become such a success that his publishers would print just about anything he dished out, no matter how long and tedious it was. I enjoyed King's early books because, though they were short, they were a great deal scarier and more intriguing than the crap he's been dishing out for the last twenty odd years. <br /> <br />I think a good book should be something that you simply don't want to put down, where there doesn't seem to be a point when you can call it quits. Not so here. We are introduced to a ridiculous number of meaningless characters and given an intricate backstory on each one of them. For example, early in the book we are introduced to a woman who is the wife of one of the characters as an adult. Her only purpose in the story is to discover that her husband has committed suicide in the bathtub, yet by the end of her chapter, the reader knows what high school she went to, how she met her husband, and even some rather disgusting details of their sex life. After she discovers her husband's body, she is never mentioned again. King does not seem capable of creating a character without giving his readers a summary of that character's life.  <br /> <br />Also, this book is replete with detailed sexual encounters. There are some authors who are masterful at sex scenes - some are brilliant enough to merely imply a sexual encounter between characters. After all, we're not reading a harlequin romance novel here, we're reading horror. I don't need to know what scent the woman's orgasmis - the thought of a lecherous nerd like Stephen King sweating over a typewriter as he writes this is the very definition of repugnance. As long as I understand they had sex, that's all I need. But my \\"orgasm\\" example above is not made up - there are moments in the book that read like a \\"Dear Penthouse\\" letter, and not for the betterment of the story. You read them and you just feel like taking a long shower afterwards. <br /> <br />Criticisms aside, when this book decides to be frightening, it succeeds. And aside from a dopey upbeat ending, I think it ultimately succeeds as a horror novel.
078681859X|4.0|The beginnings of fantasies always start with you knowing exactly what is going on and who's who, et cedera. That is completely unlike this unique and original novel by Jonathan Stroud. This starts out with Bartimaeus, a djinni, being summoned by Nathaniel, a magician, expecting like you know a lot more than you do. I almost abandoned this book for that reason. Then, after after while, the mysteries unfolded, and this book became an exciting, action- packed novel. Bartimaeus kept unfolding the unknown facts about magic through his human bias. This gave a lot of needed information in an entertaining way. As you go through the book, you understand more about magic, which is a good way of organizing it, however, the beginning is so unknow that it is boring and not promising as a book. Around ten chapters in and it reflects the oppisite image, with you knowing just enough to understand the book, but short of you knowing everything. This style proves bad in the beginning, yet extremely good in the end. If you feel like abandoning the book within a few chapters, just read through it; that will thank you in the long run for this book.
068987474X|4.0|A helpful no holes barred book with all the signs of when he's not into you.  <br /> <br />As for Dr. Marilyn Barry, a/k/a Dr. Marilyn R. Barry, if you're so busy being a doctor, why do you constantly recycle the same reviews over and over again, and then vote on them yourself? People are getting tired of seeing you sell the title that you're really trying to push in disguise of your constant recycled reviews.  <br /> <br />As for this book you'll see the signs, but what to do from that point is where it needed to give some advice. Overall, if you're confused about whether or not he's into you, it's really helpful.   <br />
0743490304|4.0|I read all books by Dan Brown, and Deception Point was the last book i read. It is a very exciting book like any other Dan Brown's productions, but the plot seems quite predictable. Reading from Da Vinci Code, Angels & Demons, and Digital Fortress, I can tell that Dan Brown likes to use twists. I can predict that the meteorite is fake from the starting of the book, if it was real, how can the story develop in a Dan Brown way? Although there are flaws of repetitiveness within the book, I think overall it was pretty interesting, I was able to learn about some Biology and other mechanisms in the book, a highly recommended.
076790592X|5.0|\\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\" is a book about Morrie Schwartz, an old history professor who has been diagnosed with ALS. Mitch Albom, his former student heard about the news after watching a show on the television and decided to pay him a visit.  After Mitch Albom sensed an immense attraction Morrie Schwarts life lessons and invitation to meet him again the week after, Mitch ends up meeting him every week until Morrie meets his death.   <br /> <br />Like many people, I decided to read \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\" after seeing the numerous positive reviews on it. Despite this fact, I was still doubtful when I first picked it up since I am not especially passionate about reading book, let alone one that is more than 200 pages (its quite a lot to me). To my surprise, I bought this book one Sunday afternoon and finished it in about 2 hours.  <br /> <br />This is one spectacular book that moved me as Morrie and Mitch's relationship grew from the life lessons Mitch learned every week. \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\" is definitely a book not to be left unread.
076790592X|5.0|Other reviews explain what this book is about. All I want to say is that it is a fabulous book that has taught me a lot. Morrie is a true inspiration, and I find myself quoting him quite often. <br />It's a fast read...I read it in a matter of a few hours. I think I'll be loaning this book out rather often as well. It was also interesting to hear a bit about what ALS does to one's body...but certainly does not effect the mind. Great find!
0385512058|4.0|I wish I could give 3.5 stars for this.  Four seems a little generous, but three seems too harsh.<br /><br />This book offers a great networking overview for those not too familiar with the subject.  I agree with all the points.<br /><br />However, for a passionate student of networking, I was looking for more examples of how to deal with tricky situations, which this book did not really address.<br /><br />I also prefer Harvey Mackay's more concise style of explaining the activity.  His little Rolodex book is such a nice, quick overview.<br /><br />Thus, if you're semi-experienced at networking, you can gain a few points from this book but probably nothing surprising.  On the other hand, if you are more of an amateur, this book provides a thorough introduction.
0743487583|2.0|I'm probably biased, because I hate the romantic period for its namby-pamby emotional fireworks, and I think Frankenstein epitomizes that. Everything is so dramatic to the point of being histrionic, and annoyingly so. Honestly, the author's life and the inspirations for the novel were a lot more interesting than the novel itself, which was neither scary nor emotionally involving. If anything, I felt little besides sheer ire toward the protagonists. This book awakened my schadenfreude. Unless you have to read it for school or something, stick to the legend of Frankenstein as the monster, not his creator.
0060012358|5.0|\\"The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents\\" was my first Terry Pratchett read, but not the last. In a spoof of the Pied Piper, Pratchett describes Maurice, a highly intelligent cat by way of the wizards' trash, and his group of rats. Along with a pipe-playing boy called Keith, Maurice and his gang scheme money out of towns by getting rid of their rat infestion.<br /><br />There is something hilarious and yet serious about the entire book. The rats themselves have to be the funniest- with names like \\"Dangerous Beans\\", \\"Hamnpork\\", and \\"Darktan\\", it isn't hard to get a laugh out of them as they explore the world with their new intelligence. They take a stab at philosophy, wondering what happens when you die and what is the point of dreams. In the end they prove stubborn for rights in the town, as well as courageous in their own way.<br /><br />Maurice himself is the most well-done character. Streetwise and cunning, he manipulates the rats into winning him the money that he does not, in fact, know what he's going to do with. In the end he's sweet and heroic- but he's still got that fierce spark in him.<br /><br />I loved reading this, and it has to be my favorite spoof ever. It was my introduction to Terry Pratchett's world, and in my opinion his most well-done book.
B000E1155E|5.0|I'll admit, I didn't know about this band until they appeared on Saturday Night Live a few months ago. Seeing them on stage really intrigued me into their music. I decided to check out what info there was online and ended up in my local book/music store buying it. <br /> <br />The music full of raw, pure energy with catchy lyrics. \\"Anticipation has a habit to set you up, for disappointment in evening entertainment, but...\\" are the words that Alex Turner sings in his thick Sheffield accent in The View From The Afternoon. Each track is creative and unique in its sound. They chose wisely by using I Bet You Look Good On The Dancefloor as one of their singles - though it's even three minutes, it packs in just as much, if not more energy than the five minute A Certain Romance. <br /> <br />The View From The Afternoon - 9/10 <br />I Bet You Look On The Dancefloor - 10/10 <br />Fake Tales of San Francisco - 10/10 <br />Dancing Shoes - 9/10 <br />You Probably Couldn't See For The Lights But You Were Staring - 10/10 <br />Still Take You Home - 9/10 <br />Riot Van - 8/10 <br />Red Light Indicates Doors Are Secured - 10/10 <br />Mardy Bum - 10/10 <br />Perhaps Vampires Is A Bit Strong - 8/10 <br />When The Sun Goes Down - 10/10 <br />From The Ritz To The Rubble - 9/10 <br />A Certain Romance - 10/10 <br /> <br />The best songs in my opinion are: I Bet You Look Good On The Dancefloor, You Probably Couldn't See For The Lights But You Were Staring, Red Light Indicates Doors Are Secure, Mardy Bum, and A Certain Romance. <br /> <br />I recommend this album to anyone who is looking for a solid, good-throughout album.

B000ENV2P0|5.0|Man, this album is just pure cosmic funk and flow. It sounds like Frusciante's guitar was crafted by the lightning of Zeus, Flea's bass was forged in the halls of Valhalla, Chad's drums were summoned by Odin, and Anthony is channeling the voice of a Titan. <br /> <br />Hyperbole aside, this is one of the Red Hots superior efforts. They've managed to bring back the funk rock they're known for continue with the beautiful melodic path they've started in By the Way. This is probably the definitive Chili Pepper album. <br /> <br />Most of the extras are pure junk-- marbles, notes, and spinning top provide exactly 20 seconds of entertainment. I like the whimsical idea of that, but maybe a Chili Peppers comicbook or T-Shirt might have been more of a value. A photo album would have been sweet. What makes the Box set essential, as a die hard fan, is the music video and making of Dani California, and even more essential is the band commentary. It was really a fascinating look into the creative process and a chance to hear the band discuss the music you've come to love. <br /> <br />Anyway, my only complaint is the track order. I've found that lbums sound better a la Californication--the harder, funkier stuff up front and then you glide into the pretty tunes. <br /> <br />Here's my personal Stadium Arcadium mix that I use to work out to as I need harder and faster stuff to get me ready to run or lift-- <br /> <br />1) Tell Me Baby <br />2) Readymade <br />3) Dani California <br />4) Storm in a Teacup <br />5) She's Only 18 <br />6) Snow ((Hey Oh)) <br />7) Hump De Bump <br />8) Especially in Michigan <br />9) Stadium Arcadium <br />10) 21st Century <br />11) Torture Me <br />12) Make You Feel Better <br />13) Slow Cheetah <br />14) So Much I <br />15) Warlocks <br />16) Charlie <br />17) We Believe <br />18) Death of a Martian <br /> <br />It's not a complete mix, as I consider every Red Hot track, including B-Sides, to be essential, but if you'rein the mood for funkier stuffwith a couple slow tracks thrown in to feel the flow, this is a dead on mix IMHO.
0380729407|4.0|I had only read Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 and I wasn't sold on the genius of Ray Bradbury.  It is hailed as a literary classic and there is merit to this, but quite a few literary classics don't really hold up as a pleasurable read...but then folks have different tastes and perspectives.  Then I came across Something Wicked This Way Comes, and honestly it was half title and have Bradbury that made me pick it up.  I love the title of the book, and the back of the mass market paperback has to be one of the single best book descriptions to hook a reader.  The book jacket read like a carnival barker trying to convince you of the wonders you will find inside the tent, or within these pages.  A carnival is exactly what has come to Green Town, Illinois.  Two eleven year old boys, Will and Jim, were born minutes apart.  Will was born a minute before midnight on October 30, Jim a minute after, October 31.  Light and Dark.  They are best friends and in the middle of the night, two weeks before Halloween, they hear a train whistle blow and music in the air.  They sneak out of their homes and discover a carnival being set up, except there is something dark and dangerous about this carnival coming in at three in the morning.  By daylight things look better, friendlier, but there is a darkness and a creepiness hiding behind every tree and every carnival ride.  Something is wrong.  How wrong?  I couldn't say without spoiling the surprise, but while there is the sense of the innocent to this book there is something truly wicked on the horizon.<br /><br />Had I read Something Wicked This Way Comes when I was around the age of the boys, or even a few years older, I would have absolutely loved this book.  It has that creepy vibe that works better when you are young and reading a scary story alone in a mostly dark room.  I have no doubt about this.  When I have children and if they want to read a creepy book when they are a little older, I'll recommend this one.  It is not at all filled with gore or excessive violence, but the imagery and what is occuring is the stuff of bad dreams.  Ray Bradbury is very effective in telling this story, building tension, and capturing the tone and perhaps essence of young boys.  This novel seems geared more to a younger (early teens, maybe pre-teen), but it is written with skill and craft, it isn't a low budget campy movie, it's a quality prestige piece that is accessible to a range of audiences.<br /><br />Still, I had difficulty being truly engaged all the way through.  It's a great campfire story, but reading it in the daylight and fifteen years later than I should have, Something Wicked This Way Comes just didn't completely click with me.  I can admire Bradbury's craft and imagination here, but I didn't love it like I would have fifteen years ago.  It's a very well written book for a younger reader, though readers of all ages can certainly still enjoy.  I certainly did.<br /><br />-Joe Sherryilled with gore or excessive violence, but the imagery and what is occuring is the stuff of bad dreams.

B000EULJLU|5.0|I have been a huge fan of tool since early on, been listening to them since their very early days of undertow and opiate. Now before I go any furter i should tell you I love tool, I am a huge fan, but i dont restrict myself to only their music. Most of the people that listen to tool or write reviews at least seem to be very Tool-biased in that they havent really exlored other genres (or so it seems). I usually listen to a wide range of music from burn the priest to floyd. that being said im going to tell you my honest opinion of this album in the following text; <br /> <br />When I usually read reviews for albums I am quite often gathering information that I will use to determine wether or not it is worth it for me to go out and purchase that particular CD. In doing so, I often look for things that the person reviewing the album has in common with my particular tastes such is if they like a certain song i enjoy etc. So in order to address the validity of the review im writing I decided to list below my feelings towards the previous tool albums, and therefore you can judge for yourself how my thoughts on 10,000 days will compare with your own particular tastes (to see if you like tool for the reasons i do). Im rating the albums based on a decimal scale of 1-10 with brief descriptions for all the releases prior to 10,000 to keep things simplified.  <br /> <br />Opiate: 8.6 - great sound original, heavy yet interesting <br />Undertow: 9.0 - first step towards the \\"spacey\\" tool we know and love. <br />Aenima: 9.5 - huge leap in song structure, maynards vocal abilities and concepts improve tremendously, great songs on this particular album. have taken steps from \\"new sound\\" towards \\"new genre\\" <br />Lateralus: 9.6 - vital album that shows the band hasn't yet peaked with aenima, and can continue to produce an evolving sound. again improvement in song structure and has an even more progressive \\"experimental\\" sound. <br />10,000 Days: 9.8 - Ok now to 10,000 days. Most people who have grown to love tool know that an album usually takes a few listens for us to accept it as \\"par\\" or even \\"better\\" than the previous. and let me just bring it out and say that they are talking about lateralus. When you first heard lateralus you were skiptical, so was I because it was achange from Aenima, and Aenima was a sound that you had grown to love. (however trivial that change may seem now) This however is not the case with 10,000. This is an amazing album, tool has grown here in every way that you would \\"Expect\\" them too. In fact im very suprised at the quality of this album because as a long time fan, it takes a great album to \\"convince\\" me. For those who have listened to the band lets say atleast since the aenima days, will have no problem adjusting to the transition. As far as most of the complaints about this album ive seen, arent coming from true Tool fans rest assured. The complaints are:1) too much filler; a: any tool fan knows that with every CD there is going to be \\"filler\\", transitional peices that help the overall album seem as a cohesive arrangement. I actually like them seing as how i enjoy sitting down and lisetning from cover to cover often and letting the music carry you along its emotional path (now you know i smoke) so filler peices nothing new here. 2) not as heavy as previous albums a: first off if your listening to tool to be heavy your listening for the wrong reasons, yes tool can be heavy, tool can be beautiful it depends on the particular song, in my opinion this album is the heaviest tool has ever produced, but again if your lisetning to tool solely for the \\"heavyness\\" you need to listen to metal, and leave tool be. 3) maynards voice is not as good or too subtle a: maynards voice is different in some songs yes, and in some he sounds mirror-image laterlus-aenima era, his vocals are evolving as usuall, they have gotten better if you ask me, (and i had my doubts that they would seing as how i hated emotive, the lastest apc CD) but despite his side-band, he has come back and filled the role of tool frontman seemlessly, tool fans to do fear. As for his voice being subtle? its subtle when necessary and aggressive when needed, like all tools music has been since their conception, again NOTHING we older tool fans havent seen before. To some up this rambling attempt at an accurate review. If your a tool fan, buy this album, it will dispell all your doubts as well as reminding you why you still love tool and will give you a CD to listen to until your sick of it like you did with all other tool releases. Enjoy.
B000EHSVSC|4.0|Remember this movie; forget \\"Pearl Harbor.\\" Fox has rereleased the outstanding 1970 film that covers Dec. 7, 1941, from both the U.S. and Japanese sides. Richard Fleischer provides most of the direction, with Kinji Fukasaku and Toshio Masuda handling Japanese sequences.<br /><br />The Fox DVD's upgrades appear limited to the generous collection of extras, which address the historical questions raised by the film. (Owners of the previous disc should upgrade only if they're interested in the special features.) As on the older disc, there are pounding 4.1(!) audio and decent but unexceptional video.<br /><br />Fox also upgraded \\"The Longest Day\\" and \\"Patton,\\" just in time for June 6. All three titles go from single- to double-disc presentations, with some extras ported over. \\"The Longest Day\\" gets a more relaxed aspect ratio than on the previous release. \\"Patton's\\" numerous upgrades include an intro and feature-length commentary by screenwriter Francis Ford Coppola.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|My heart pounds with the powerfully frantric drums and piano of Apocalypse Please, my quench for skillfull rock is healed with the tantalizing beats of 'Stockholm Syndrome', 'Time Is Running Out' and 'Hysteria', and the serene love song 'Endlessly' is a touchingly vulnerable tale hailing over the likes of 'Unintended'. 'Butterflies and Hurricanes' is a true tribute to the classical soul and the eeriely soft beauties of 'Blackout' and 'Ruled By Secrecy' is matched only by the accompanying violins and talented piano. The sounds of 'Falling Away With You' is streamed with crys of the skillful Matthew Bellamy, and the final troubles of a drowning soul are described through 'The Small Print' and 'Thoughts Of A Dying Atheist'.<br /><br /> The album is an event triggered by the sounds of the Apocalypse (track 2) and all songs following are the racey thoughts of ending lights and feverish attempts to grasp that 'Absolution' before it's over.  Truely Muse's most mature and dramatic peices.
0553573403|2.0|I'll start with what George R.R. Martin did right.  On a sentence and paragraph level, he is a very good writer.  He is able to compose tight prose that forces the reader to go on to the next page.  Now that that's out of the way, I will now cover where Mr. Martin went so horribly awry.<br /><br />  First of all, In 807 pages, he is unable to properly resolve even one storyline.  One story ends solely by virtue of the POV (point of view) character's death, which was such an utter farce that I couldn't be bothered to care.  Which brings me to the second problem with the novel;  Nearly all the characters share the quality of being utter morons.  Eddard, for example, reveals to the queen that he knows her dirty secret while the king is out on a hunting trip, giving the queen plenty of time to make her plans to \\"remove\\" Eddard.<br /><br />  This is only one example of the gross idiocy demonstrated in the novel.  It is routine for people to trust individuals who are obviously not trustworthy, to accept evidence that is plainly planted, and to otherwise act without any sort of consideration for consequences and results.  This also applies to the \\"antagonists\\", who succeed in their plots solely by virtue of being marginally less stupid then the \\"protagonists\\".<br /><br />  Third, It seems as though Martin is obsessed with having as many horrible random events strike the characters.  The more random, pointless, and out of place, the better.  If a chapter goes by without rape, molestation, incest, pedophilia, murder, or gleeful reference to the above, I couldn't find it.  Furthermore, many of these events come out of nowhere for no discernable reason.<br /><br />  Fourth, It is manifestly obvious that Mr. Martin is uncomfortable writing fantasy.  95% of the novel would have comfortably fit into the dark ages (not suprising, given that the whole storyline is ripped from the war of the roses), while the remaining 5% is very akward and poorly done.  In a Game of Thrones, magic is a plot device that does nothing except fulfill the minimum quota necessary to be called a fantasy novel.  There's a man with a flaming sword, who has absolutely no narrative impact, an impending invasion of undead from the north, which never materializes, and the birth of three dragons, which is handled so poorly that I actually gagged on the writing.<br /><br />  All in all, I would highly recommend against reading \\"A Game of Thrones\\".  For a real mature fantasy series, go to \\"The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant, the Unbeliever\\".e.

B00005JM02|5.0|Finding Nemo (Collector's Edition)~ Eric Bana is one of the best made animated movies in a long time and also one of the greatest animated movies that I have seen in many years. The music is awesome. The animation is first rate and ranks right up their with other animation classics such as Lion King, Jungle Book and many others. The acting is great and the dialogue is quick and witty. The plot is well developed and this is an instant classic that will be liked and loved by children of all ages for many years to come and is bound to become a real classic. Highly recommended, i give it 5 out 5 stars.
B0007GADZO|1.0|First of all, Steve Vai is in my opinion one of the most talented and exciting guitar players/musicians I've had the pleasure to see. That's high praise, because I've seen Stevie Ray, Van Halen (Roth era), Rhoads, Foghat, Frampton.......you get the picture. He is also an amazing person to meet and talk to. Very spiritual and just a great person; very positive. <br />   Lately though, each time Steve puts out a new cd, I become more hesitant to lay down the cash because his music rocks less and just pushes the envelope in the wrong direction. This cd is too experimental. The playing is great, but the songs have no balls to them. Maybe Disney could use him for all the kids animation movies? It's just \\"girly\\". <br />   I know he knows what people want, because he plays all the cool stuff in his live shows. Why is that? Because that's the stuff that is moving and what makes a live show \\"live\\". So why must we be subjected to  all the \\"filler\\" stuff? I'm not saying that all the songs have to be fast and rip, because he can play 2 notes with as much feeling as 1,000 notes. Please Steve, just write some songs in song form. The world is waiting for more jaw dropping music.
B00005JOVH|2.0|Ok, they had 40 years of comic lore to draw from and this is what they come up with?   <br />    <br />First the good:  The movie looks great, but great special effects are not uncommon these days.  And the acting is pretty good overall.   <br />     <br />Now the bad:  The story is weak. That love triangle between Cyclops, Jean Grey and Wolverine in the first two movies?  Wisked away.  The new love triangle with Shadowcat, Iceman and Rogue?  Underdeveloped to a point that you just don't care.  And hey, they finally got Angel in the movies! ...and did nothing with him!  Angel was one of the first X-Men in the comics, did he even have three lines in the movie? <br /> <br />And what of Magneto?  He's so dedicated to his cause that he'll send wave after wave of his loyal mutants to their doom.  Um Mr. Magneto... if you kill off all of your followers, who will you lead when you take over the world?  Doesn't matter!  Attack!    <br /> <br />There are a few nice moments.  Kelsy Grammer was a pleasant surprise.  He did more than just let his makeup act for him.  Wolverine got his claws dirty a couple of times.  And Juggernaut filled in nicely for the all brawn, no brains role left vacant by Sabretooth in X1.   <br /> <br />Everyone else was pretty much interchangeable.  How do we know he's a mutant?  He's green.  Ok, what does he do?  Not important.  This guy is a porcupine.  Ok, what's his name?  Not important. Magneto refered to them as pawns.  Evidentially, so did the screenwriters. <br /> <br />I was entertained, but I wasn't moved.  The first two X-Men films had emotion, a sense of adventure and loss.  X3 had a sense of obligation.  They setup a coming war in the first two movies, and they hinted at Jean's resurrection, so here it is! If only they followed the Dark Phoenix saga from the comics, it could have been fantastic.  Instead, it's all action, no heart. A forgetable effort. <br /> <br /> <br />
B000EGCITG|5.0|I cannot stop playing this CD.  Dear Mr President says it ALL.  Thank you Pink for saying what most of the US feels right now.  I'm in my 6th decade of life and I love your work so it goes to show that you don't have to be young and in-vogue to love your music and lyrics.  I own all of your CDs but this is by far the BEST!!!!!
B00005JOVH|4.0|It was worth the price of the ticket to see Kelsey Grammar portray the Beast, the blue-skinned, fur covered X-Men with a several advanced degrees. It was a perfect piece of casting. Most of the cast from the previous X-Men film are in Last Stand, one notable exception is NightCrawler (my personal favorite) and a few old favorites were added: Angel, Colossus, Kitty Pryde.  <br /> <br />The special effects were great, this time around the audience gets to see characters like Magneto, Storm and Jean Grey really go \\"all out\\" with their powers. Hugh Jackman puts in another great performance as Wolverine as well. <br /> <br />Some X-Men fans will be upset over the various plot lines taken from comics and jumbled into this film but Last Stand will entertain most X-Men fans and non-fans alike.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I bought this dvd collection (and the movie Serenity) because this is the first tv series I want to watch over and over again. The characters, storylines, dialogue, the overall look...everything is so creative.  The actors are completely believable in their roles and really do have great chemistry together.  Dramatic and funny too.  Although you can watch Serenity as a stand alone movie, I would recommend watching the Firefly series first to get the full background/storylines. <br /> <br />There's so much more to explore in the Firefly/Serenity universe, I hope Joss and crew have that opportunity.
B00000JJSK|5.0|John Garcia's Unida is a great band, and this album is one mean motha. Those expecting the spacey fuzzed out jams of Kyuss will not find it here. Instead you get eight huge rocking stoner anthems to bang your head to, full of gigantic riffs and huge vocal deliveries from John. If that's not enough, then you need to get off this page.<br /><br />Quite simply every track on this album rocks hard, and John gives it everything. 'Thorn' kicks things off with a simple and catchy riff with John wailing about love and lust. Great groove throughout the song, a fine opening. Things don't really change direction, but then they don't need to. 'Black Woman' is one of my favorite moments on this, especially when the band come back in to pummelling power chords after a stylish guitar solo. Just great rock n roll.<br /><br />The band keep knocking out great riffs and songs. 'Plastic' is a bit of a slow burner with a real groove-laden close. 'Nervous' is probably my favorite track on the album with John's resentful delivery of 'You should have told me, you had another f*cking breakdown' laced over a monumental riff and no-nonsense skin bashing drumming. If this one doesn't get your head bobbing and toes tapping, then you have absolutely no hope.<br /><br />Simple try and get this album, despite it being out of print, you need this in your rock collection.<br /><br />Fans of Kyuss, Dozer, Karma to Burn, Hermano etc will enjoy.
0307277674|3.0|I had heard alot of positive and negative reaction toward The Da Vinci Code, so I never bother to read it until the theology war was getting out of control and boycotting around.  Myself, devout Christian so I gave up and went to library to read the new edition (new cover) of The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown...as I read it became very addictable filled with many mysterious and suspene as I really ENJOYED it alot until the character Robert Langdon and Sophia Neveu came into serious dialogue with Sir Leigh Teabeg regard Lord's last supper involving the Mary the Magladene being married to Jesus was FULL of jokes!  I dont appreciate how Dan Brown put such as misleading doctrine on Holy Grail based on Jesus Christ our true Lord and Mary the Magladene.  I am finally able to understood why it is upsetting Protestant and Catholic seriously, I do respect Dan Brown for his creative of storyline style but I dont appreciate how Dan Brown put misleading about Jesus Christ.  It is very deeply disappointed but I strongly urge anyone who have strong faith as Christian to read this book to help understand the hersey doctrine better in order to decode and break the Da Vinci Code better!
B000E33VWW|2.0|I'll keep this short as alot of reviewers on Amazon are not going to like me for my opinion.<br /><br />This film was interesting at first with a stunning transformation and performance by Philip Seymour Hoffman.  Capote is brilliantly directed with fantastic visuals of the 1950's.  But..... I found the film to be a bit too dragged out and very slow paced.  PS Hoffman does keep you interested, as he drags you through the very slow pace of the film and slaps out a couple of slightly amusing jokes.  However, Capote is a serious film that deals with an even more serious subject, but seems very dull and lifeless and in some parts very boring.<br /><br />I would have liked to see this film done better, with a bit more pace and character as it is a very interesting subject to take on.  Hoffman good, film bad.
0812974611|5.0|I think this book is a terrific read.  Great description, characters, well written.  I thought I knew the history of Pompeii - I learned so much more!  I have recommended this book to several friends, and gave a few copies as gifts.  I will definitely add Robert Harris to my list of authors and look for more of his books.
B000000OAC|5.0|I've read reviews on this site (and in other places) that say News of the World 'gets old fast,' but this isn't the case for me. <br /> <br />This album, like A Night at the Opera, contains huge hits but is a lot more consistent than people give it credit for. Some songs, like Sleeping on the Sidewalk, Who Needs You, and Fight From the Inside take more time listening to in order to get used to them, but they, like many of Queen's tunes, are among the underrated. <br /> <br />My ratings and comments on the songs (if anybody cares):  <br /> <br />We Will Rock You - 4/5 (It remains a rock and roll staple to this day, but gets tiring after a while) <br /> <br />We Are the Champions - 5/5 (Many will claim that Bohemian Rhapsody is Queen's \\"greatest hit\\", but I think this (along with We Will Rock You and Another One Bites the Dust) overtakes it strictly in terms of worldwide popularity) <br /> <br />Sheer Heart Attack - 5/5 (My favorite song written by Roger Taylor. Hard rock at a breakneck pace. What happened to Roger's writing style in the '80s, I don't know, but Radio Ga Ga and A Kind of Magic don't hold a candle to his '70s stuff) <br /> <br />All Dead, All Dead - 4/5 (A slow ballad by Brian. Not his best, not his worst) <br /> <br />Spread Your Wings - 5/5 (John Deacon's best) <br /> <br />Fight From the Inside - 4/5  <br /> <br />Get Down, Make Love - 3/5 (Funky, occasionally noisy song by Freddie, complete with plenty of blatant sexual innuendo \\"You blow my head\\", \\"I give you meat\\") <br /> <br />Sleeping on the Sidewalk - 4/5 (Simple tune written by Brian. Tells a story, much like Spread Your Wings) <br /> <br />Who Needs You - 4/5 (Catchy, but that's about it) <br /> <br />It's Late - 5/5 (Like The Prophet's Song, this remains one of Brian's best and, unfortunately, most underrated. Beats We Will Rock You any day) <br /> <br />My Melacholy Blues - 5/5 (Just Freddie singing at the piano with some bass and percussion, but it works. The only Brian-less track on the album) <br /> <br />The remix of We Will Rock You - 1/5 (Humorously written on the CD as \\"Ruined by\\" Rick Rubin, a well-deserved credit. He makes a 2 minute song over 4 minutes long and it sucks) <br /> <br />News of the World is a great album, don't let some reviews sway you. After the two first hits, there are still nine classics that  are well worth it. Just skip the remix.
0887307280|3.0|Even though I don't feel the ambition of growing to become a fortune 500 multinational, the authors advice to see my business as the prototype of a future-franchise is still very interesting, Ill give him that. But he should stick to business advice and not at the same time try to turn this book into a novel! <br /> <br />So mr. Gerber, if you intend to write more books: please get to the point quickly (remember, we're all business people) and don't stray towards poetry!
076792603X|4.0|I read the paperback edition and I want to know if Dan Brown tells more in the illustrated edition before I spend money to buy it.<br /><br />Dan Brown was very clever in the paperback version to disclose in the end that Sophia Neveu was a direct descendant of Mary Magdalene and Jesus Christ. I think Brown intentionally let the reader ponder upon a hidden clue; Sophia Neveu drank but never urinated to make her half God half human. Robert Langdon, too, he drank but never urinated once in the whole story. He got to be the Worthy to find the Grail.<br /><br />On page 448, Dan Brown wrote \\"Then, leaning forward, she kissed him tenderly on the cheek.\\"<br /><br />And then there's no sex between the two?<br /><br />I had to go back to 4 pages to understand Dan Brown's hidden clue.<br /><br />Page 444, he wrote \\"a full moon was rising above the tree line.\\"<br /><br />Ah, the connection between full moon and women's menstrual cycle. That was why Sophie kissed but did not make love to Robert.<br /><br />Anyway, I give 4 stars for 4 pages that I had to flip.
0752815423|4.0|This book has lots of great parts, but the ending was flat to me.  I can't really tell why without giving away the ending, but it felt quite anticlimatic.  I have enjoyed all of the Connelly books I've read so far but this was NOT my favorite.  Worth reading once, but it won't be on my 'keeper' list.
1400079179|1.0|Imagine a conspiracy so large that it encompasses smaller conspiracies within it. Imagine if you will that this conspiracy is designed for mass consumption. How would it be done? Firstly, by writing in a style that appeals to the masses. Simple & tasty with an aroma that you can smell at every corner. Sound familiar? But what would this conspiracy be? The search for the grail? Think bigger; a global spirituality, a new age of Aquarius, where sexual freedom not only prevails, but is lifted to religious status as it was in the late great empire of Babylon. A Global Babylon. Now who says sex doesn't sell?  But how could this be achieved? Most religions are based on pesky starchy ideals of morality, ethics & age tested regulations. My how those regulations are boring. Law! So let's start with turning common symbolism on its head. First we get the pentagram, the collectively universal symbol for Satanism & magiK & carefully reconstruct it to mean `sacred'. That's a good start. We then sprinkle in some obvious & rallying facts like Women are equal opposites to men; in fact let's make them superior (lets face it); & how hierarchical church structures removed the spirituality out of religion & murdered millions in the name of God. (Who can deny that?)  Then carefully weave Aquarian age Goddess symbology into the story & back it up by `suppressed history', wooooo! That will supplant most `Gods' with a hyper politically correct Goddess, as we've been trying to do for a while. Then subtly shift the Goddess to be Venus, the morning star, represented by the pentagram it apparently weaves through the heavens every 8 years. We leave out the messy bits like how Lucifer (Satan) was symbolized by the planet Venus in the Bible,(Isaiah 14:12, King James Version, not the New International one. You want a real life conspiracy? Work out why they took the name Lucifer out of the New version of the Bible) but sidetrack the whole show with `Jesus was just one of us really - divine? NAHHH'.  This will appeal to all who want their spirituality but want to mould it in their own image. Hey. Isn't that New Age? Anyway, if you like to turn off your mind and accept stuff, you'll LUV this. The kid below did.This will appeal to all who want their spirituality but want to mould it in their own image. Hey. Isn't that New Age?

B000EMGAOY|5.0|Great Album -  <br />I read the rock critic reviews first - which gave me the impression the cd was okay but not great.   <br /> <br />I'm glad I took a chance because the boys rock on this CD - it's simple yet sophisticated - beautiful - rough, dark and hopeful - all at the same time.   <br /> <br />Highly recommended - if you want confirmation that rock music can still be vibrant and alive - like Neil Young's Living With War album - a soundtrack for our times.
B00005JOVJ|5.0|Imagine removing the slow burn between action scenes of the first movie, ramping up the action scenes of the second movie, and throwing the result (together with a dozen more mutants) into one film. That's what you have with XMTLS. Fans who cheered in the theater during the second film when Wolverine killed the guy in the kitchen will get more than their fill of claw-slashing action.<br /><br />XMTLS is an incredible film and easily the best of the series. While it's true they probably tried to put too much into one short film (this is the shortest of the three for some reason with the largest cast), Ratner and company do an admirable job of pulling it off for the most part. While rumors abound this is the last one due to contract problems with certain \\"Stormy\\" stars, this film proves if nothing else that the X-Men universe can survive without the whole cast. There are enough heroes waiting in the wings to get treatments that we can afford to lose anyone not willing to return.<br /><br />The film pulls off some key moments in powerful ways. The problem is that it tries to pull off TOO MANY key moments and therefore loses the impact of most of them. Yes, we finally get to see the Danger Room. Yes, The Angel finally makes an appearance (for about ten minutes of film time). Yes, The Beast is every bit as cool in the movies as he is in the comics (Grammar does an amazing job of perfectly portraying Hank McCoy's intellect while pulling off some amazing fighting moves). And hey, they've thrown in Juggernaut, Colossus, Sprite, Psylocke, Madrox the Multiple Man, Arclight, Marrow, and Spike. And Iceman finally \\"ices up\\"!<br /><br />What did they do wrong? In adding so many characters, there's not enough screen time for them. Rogue uses her powers ONCE early in the film when she could have been used in a great way during the climactic battle scene at the end. The death of a MAJOR character ten minutes into the film is only alluded to rather than shown (which is a rip since we've stuck with this person through two other films). Speaking of deaths, this film pulls out all the stops. The Xavier Institute's backyard goes from scenic to a graveyard in ONE FILM! Shouldn't we have spaced these out a little?<br /><br />Still, despite giving too much in too little time (this could have easily gone over the two hour mark without making anyone upset), this is the best film of the series. Hugh Jackman adds a depth to the character of Wolverine with one scene that truly shows how he's grown from the previous two installments. Storm becomes a central player to the team finally. And we see the Colossus/Wolverine \\"Fastball Special\\" from the comics. Ratner even throws in a little curve of his own after the credits finish rolling to show there could still be life in the franchise if anyone's interested. I'd say we definitely all are! Cut down the cast a little (for heaven's sake, lose Magneto! The \\"Mutants are superior to Homo Sapiens\\" routine has gotten too old and the guy's more of an irritation than a menace now), add some faces to give us more fun (Gambit could appear to add some spice to the Rogue/Iceman/Sprite love triangle), lengthen the movie (by at least a half hour to give us a breather between explosions), and keep giving Wolverine people to slash and we'll all be happy!

1400062756|5.0|I've been a fan of Carol Dweck's scholarly work for years. Her work on self-esteem, self-concept, and the incremental vs. entity theories of intelligence provides some of the most powerfully useful tools I've encountered for educators and parents in their work with children, as well as in their own self-awareness and lives. I'm delighted to see this information written here in such a user-friendly conversational tone, rich with stories that illustrate the nuances and complexities of Dweck's research and ideas.

B00005JOVH|5.0|As everyone know the plot is simple to lay out - a drug company has discovered a \\"cure\\" for the mutant condition - the antibodies of a boy who negates all mutant powers around him.  Some people want the cure, some see it as a danger.  And then, our government, in their eternal wisdom turns it into a weapon, giving Magneto precisely what he needs to start a revolution.<br /><br />And the Phoenix rises from Jean Grey's watery grave to wreak havoc.<br /><br />However, as will all Xmen stories, those in comic books, graphic novels, television cartoons or movies, this is not all.  There is pathos, love, hate and Holocaust allusions galore. There is acting of high caliber and action everywhere. All of this is top notch.  And we see HUNDREDS of various mutants, including Beast, Leach, Callisto, ArcLight, Mulipleman... Well you get the point, but not one little hint of our favorite Cajun, Gambit.  Why was Remy left out AGAIN???? Argh!  To me this was the only drawback of the film.  I mean people, he WAS part of the Brotherhood, he could have just been inserted for a second in the damned forest! Any way, as I said, the acting is there, the action is there, the Shakespearen plot twists and Greek Family Tragedy theater is there.  And it is wonderful.  Unfortunately, Brett Ratner just isn't Bryan Singer.  That is good for the Girls, we see Storm as she was meant to be, the second in command, a weather Goddess and strong willed.  We see the Phoenix as she was supposed to be, and the guys kind of take a back seat, except for Xavier, Iceman, Magneto and Wolverine.<br /><br />SInger would have had a defter touch, but may not have given us the strong female leads we needed.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />1. Ian McKellan.  It is wonderful that he has come into his own in major blockbusters in the last decade.  It is a pity he didn't before.<br /><br />2. Patrick Stewart.

B000E97Y6K|5.0|Since I am on vacation, I watched King Kong for the second time today. I am amazed by this film on several levels. Jackson may have outdone himself on this one from what he did on Lord of the Rings.  <br />  <br />A young seventeen year-old I work with told me when she watched King Kong at the movies she cried at the end. I thought she was crazy. I even asked if she understood that I said I was thinking about buying King Kong. I thought she must have misunderstood what movie I was talking about. She said the ape was so real. Again, I thought she meant real from the standpoint of special effects. Nope. That's not what she was talking about. <br />  <br />There is a line in the film that reoccurs: \\"they're only words\\". First time I saw the movie I caught on to the fact that they were repeated. I did not understand their impact until watching the film for the second time. Heinrich Zimmer said those things that are most important can never be put to words. Well, in this movie, the most important and emotional scenes have no words whatsoever. Tears and laughter, but, no words. They occur between Ann Darrow and Kong. I do not believe it is by chance that Peter Jackson never had Ann Darrow mention Kong's name in the film. It puzzled me while watching the movie why she never referred to the ape by name. The natives called him Kong. The film director, Carl Denhem, referred to him as Kong. But, Ann never says his name.  <br />  <br />The humanity with which Kong is imbued in this movie is absolutely astounding. Who but a Peter Jackson whould ever be proud enough to lend such subtle and human traits to a computer animated being? Who but a Peter Jackson could actually succeed in making something so delicate work? After watching this movie twice, I now know why my young friend cried at the end. Kong is used as a metaphor of human traits that are lost as we become adults. I am not speaking of a childlike quality. I am speaking of a transcendent, primordial innocence that we as aspecies lost thousands of years ago. That wild innocence is seen in Kong and his relationship to Beauty, Ann Darrow. The one word that Kong pantomines to Ann is just that word: \\"beauty\\". And, in his completely innocent love for Ann, we see a transcendent nature we as humans strive all our lives to regain. <br />  <br />King Kong lends itself to many psychological interpretations because it deals with pure archetypes. Kong is the animal within us all that has been so tamed we have lost an important part of our humanity. Ann Darrow, the Beauty to Kong's Beast, is a representation of all that is worth fighting for in life, all that means something. Again, I feel it is no accident that Ann's gown in the final scenes is pure white, constrasted to Kong's blackness. Just before they meet up for the last time the soundtrack has Peggy Lee singing \\"Bye Bye Blackbird.\\" In Ann and Kong we have the perfect Ying and Yang, the pure blending of the pairs of opposites. And while the iconic line that Beauty killed the Beast is in this update of the story as it was in the original, Man is the real instrument used in killing Kong. And, through what part of Man's accomplishments is the Beast killed? - that proudest achievement of our industrial history: the airplane. Man as Machine. And, even in the almost last scene of the movie is another psychological theme produced. Once Kong slips off the Empire State Building in death, Ann rushes into the arms of her Knight in Shining Armour, Jack Driscoll. Kong becomes the Father-figure that must be killed before the innocent child can become a woman and take unto herself a husband. Pure Freud. <br />  <br />Yes, the special effects in this film are even more spectacular than what Jackson did in The Trilogy of the Rings. The fight scenes are incredible. But, proving that he is more than just a film technician, through the elemental aspects of this story, Jackson proves he is the most intelligent director doing mainstream movies today. I have to admit it: The Lord of the Rings was no fluke. This man and the people he surrounds himself with are the most talented film makers making films today. King Kong is an instant classic in anybody's book.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|I've never considred The Chilli Peppers as one of my favourite bands.'Blood sex' and 'Californication' were very good but i've even stopped listening to those albums in recent years. <br />After the disappointment of \\"By the way\\" I greeted this album with scepticism, reluctant to part with 13quid upon its release. After listening to \\"Dani California\\", i was thinking 'jesus, if this is the best song on it theyve chosen as the lead single, what is the rest of it gonna be like?', not that i dislike the song, it just so happens that it is in my opinion the worst.  <br />As soon as the opening guitar riff of 'snow' pleasured my ears, Stadium Arcadium left me thrilled and slightly bemused at how astonishing it really is. <br />Stand out tracks for me would be \\"slow cheetah\\", \\"hump de bump\\"; which shows they haven't forgotten they were once a funk band,  \\"Especially in Michigan\\" is great but the greatest moment on 'Jupiter' for me is the outro of \\"Wet sand\\" which is glorious, and on 'Mars' it would be Frusciante's guitar solo in \\"Turn it again.\\" If i ever get as good as Fruciante at the guitar I'll die a happy man, I got over 20yrs before I'm his age so here's hoping! <br />ANYONE who compares it to green day is an idiot. Sorry to sound judgemental but there you are. <br />All i can say is that I think this is the best album that's been released since Radiohead's \\"Hail to the thief\\" in 2003, and 'highly reccommended' would be an understatement. <br />Hats off to the Chillis.
B00003CXMG|4.0|If you are looking for a movie that is comprised of comedy, drama, and good music, then I would highly recommend Almost Famous. This Academy award-winning flick will make you laugh, cry, and sing along with the characters and you might even learn a thing or two about the 70's. In terms of the plot, Almost Famous is anything but predictable and the various obstacles that William, the main character, must overcome and the challenges the other characters face, will keep you in your seat. Although I, being born in the late 80's, never had the opportunity to live in the 1970's, Almost Famous enabled me to learn various aspects of the lifestyles and culture of rock n' roll's hottest time period in American. Everything from the rocking music, clothing trends, and the care-free attitude in this movie will bring you back to a more exciting time in history and can make anyone wish they were on tour with a 70's rock band. All in all, Almost Famous is a great movie.
B000056K04|4.0|Got this CD in 2001. At first it was a difficult listen - I thought I had wasted my cash again (The space between was/is good though. <br /> <br />Then one day I put the CD in the car and forced myself to listen - well it was the only CD I had in the car and the radio was driving me nuts. By the time I was on the 3rd play I was hooked. <br /> <br />Angel is particularly good. Now it is one of my regular  <br />CD's <br />
0385510454|3.0|What's the deal with this book?  Going along reading it, and every other page there's a five minute dissortation on sites to see.  The history of, how long it took to built, good grief, am I reading a novel or a travel book?  It's an obvious way for the author to show off all the information he's learned while writing this book.  Definitely slows down pace.  Okay novel.
B00005JOVH|5.0|Awesome action and suspense! Lots of special effects, visuals, everything!! HIGHLY Recommended!!   <br /> <br />A great powerful ending to the X-Men trilogy.
B000003S09|5.0|I have never heard anything like this and I'll never forget the very first time I heard it (isn't that the way it is with GREAT music?) I know there was no music of this type at the time, and I'm not sure there has been since! Beautiful, scary, spacey, freaked- out, the whole smorgasboard. Oh, and if you, like me, think mellotrons are cool: this is the album for you!!! And I don't believe I've ever heard a saxophone so freaky in my life. I personally think Greg Lake has one of the best voices in rock. Love all of King Crimson's CDs, this one being my favorite (doesn't it blow your mind that this was their DEBUT?)Basically, I'm writing this to give homage to one of the most brilliant pieces of music I've ever heard. I know it doesn't need my help, just a listen with an open mind and ears. Can't forget the totally awesome lyrics of Pete Sinfield that make this such a wonderful experience. If you don't own this, please do yourself a favor and introduce yourself to some unique, sublime, powerful and, at times, spooky music. I'm glad I did!
B00005JOUM|4.0|It's summer time here and it is hot in the afternoon. So we tend to go to the theatre a bit more during the summer, and use their air conditioning.<br /><br />It is a worthwhile action movie with enough twists to laugh and be puzzled about. I missed the main point despite it being pretty obvious (not jail but the hidding place), didn't see the diamond pass off coming but certainly laughed when it happened. Which is my general reaction to the movie, i laughed and enjoyed the plot and twists, got them mostly after the fact, rather then predicting them, which i appreciate. (i didn't get the sewer pipe for instance, before it was obvious)<br /><br />Making the chief bankrobber a really nice guy, fake guns, switching their own people into the little groups were well done pieces. Making the cops bungling but sincere fools chasing their shadows was pulled off well, probably because of the talented acting by Denzel Washington. Making the goal elusive yet highly moral with Jodie Foster in the employ of a bad guy with a bad conscience really helps for the realistic believability of the plot. A few unexplained problems don't seem to bother the overall quality (how did he know were it was?), something that often disturbs detective cop type movies in the final analysis.<br /><br />It's good, mind involving entertainment, with a few interesting questions brought up but not really followed(expiation of guilt), the plot twists and action being the main big point.<br /><br />Worthwhile to watch in the theatre but i'm not sure if i owed the DVD that i'd watch it again, it is trying to figure out the plot twists that make the movie, once you know them it is not nearly as involving.<br /><br />thanks for reading this short review. If you live in the North Hemisphere, get out of the heat this summer, join me and go to the movies.
1592401791|5.0|This book is just a recollection of what Geoff remembers and his opinions about his experiences with the Beatles.  It's as simple as that.  He may have gotten some facts wrong, and he may have enjoyed working with Paul more than George, so that's what he wrote about.  Were people expecting him to say George was a genius if he didn't believe it to be so?  One reviewer on here only read about 100 pages and wrote a review.  Goodness.  You can tell that the 1 and two star reviews are from people who don't like what he had to say. If you don't want to hear criticism of George and Ringo and a lot of stories about the great relationship Geoff had with Paul then don't get this book. I don't agree with everything that he wrote, but I certainly am glad that he wrote his thoughts and opinions.  Someone wrote that it is another piece to the puzzle of understanding the Beatles.  That it certainly is.  At the time of this review you can get the book for about about $12, so at this point is is definitely worth getting it.  I bought it new and feel it was worth it.  We Beatle People are lucky that Geoff has decided to share his memories with us.
B000056NX5|4.0|Although I enjoyed this production very much, there were some rough spots that keep me from giving 5 stars. <br /> <br />First, I disagree with the negative review here about Judas - who I thought was brilliant with his acting.  But I do agree with that reviewer that Harrod was just plain flat.  Also, I found Pilot over the top.  I enjoyed his performance the first viewing - but found it grating each viewing afterwards.

B00005JOVH|5.0|I went to see this last night with my dad and my tomboy sister.  we thought we would be dissipointed with this, because of the negative reveiws from the people ( i don't trust critics) but we went ahead and seen it cause we still wanted to give it a try and we were all very impressed the effects were really cool and well done the plot wasen't so bad the action was good and intense and very dramatic (at least to me) storm had a bigger and better part, Jackmen Mckellen, and Stewart really did the parts well and there was a very shocking scene with professer x and i haden't been this shock or sad sinc saw benji when i was seven, DARK PHONIEX WAS SSSCARRY and was done very well, cyclops didn't do much for me so i was okay with it when he died but i could ask for a better death for him rouge had a small part but there wasen't munch she could do. this was probadly my 2nd favorite x-men my 1st favorite was the 1st x-men movie then x-men 2, i did miss nightcrawler.       <br /> <br />p.s. look closely at the begining when xaveier made the cars float in the air we see a cameo of stan lee the creator of the x-men comics.
6304039328|3.0|Travolta did a great job portraying a mafia guy who decides he wants to produce movies instead.  For the most part, he was believable and humorous.  He was always chivalrous and seemed to make friends with everyone, and one step ahead of everyone else.<br /><br />The plot line was fine, and the movie was paced well.  At times though, it got a little \\"cute\\" in how the script that they were trying to produce mirrored the actual movie itself.  I did get tired of the language and violence, even knowing it was an R movie.  In places it seemed like an actors reunion with all the stars that popped in.  The ending wasn't spectacular, but it did give closure on most of the loose ends.  Not a terrible movie, but not a blockbuster either.
B0000073BG|5.0|The best work of Renaissance never strayed far from the symphonic style of  19th and 20th century music.  Scheherazade & Other Stories, certainly one of the band's most ambitious recordings, saw the band using their classical roots to produce one of the signature albums of 1970's progressive rock.  Unlike other prog-rock groups, Renaissance eschewed much of the technology in favor of acoustic instruments and orchestral arrangements.  Electric guitars and synthesizers were seldom used, giving the band's music more of a symphonic sweep.<br /><br />This is not to say that Renaissance was without talented musicians.  John Tout was an accomplished pianist and his work is well represented on Scheherazade & Other Stories. Jon Camp innovative bass lines often provided the melodic structures for the songs. And of course, Annie Haslam's ethereal vocals were the musical centerpiece of the band.  Renaissance was an incredibly talented ensemble and featured one of the loveliest voices in rock music.

B00008DDSC|5.0|This film doesn't just cover the S/m aspect of BDSM but also the D/s (domination/submision).  It an eye opening movie for those who don't know much about BDSM other than the typical lies, myths, and stereotypes perpetuated by society.<br /><br />All in all James spader and Maggie Gyllenhaal made this a great movie and I recommend it to anyone who has an open mind, or someone who is willing to put themselves in another persons shoes.
B000E6G4Y6|3.0|This was the final commitment to ABACKO records, or London Records. It is a mix of alot of songs in the closet. Most of these would wind up on the cd box set called \\"The London Years\\" in 1989. There are some rare things here some are rather lame, but there are some tasty nuggets here. \\"Out Of Time\\" originally released on the \\"Flowers\\" album this is an alternate version with British Blue-Eyed soul singer Chris Farlowe singing with them, \\"I'm Going Down\\" probably the best Stones song from the 70's that wasn't on the \\"Sticky Fingers\\" album. If I heard this on the boardwalks of New Jersey I'd consider it a fond memory today, \\"I Don't Know Why( I Love You)\\" is actually done very well here. Written by Stevie Wonder it was recorded the night Brian Jones died, and \\"Memo From Turner\\" I've heard and loved this song since I was 15 was from the soundtrack of Mick Jagger's movie \\"Performance\\". The rest was either o.k., or terrible, but the one I don't think I've heard it yet, but \\"Heart Of Stone\\" I know it's off of \\"The Rolling Stones NOW!\\" album, but I remember hearing an orchestrated version of the song which was conducted by Stones manager Andrew Loog Oldham. I'd want to hear that again. This is probably the lone Stones album that would make it onto a Trivial Pursuit card because chances are \\"You Don't Remember IT!!!\\" It's reissued now, but unless I find it to be like $11.99, or lower I will pass.
0312330537|5.0|I experienced two \\"states of grace\\" in connection to this amazing piece of literary fiction by Australian writer Gregory David Roberts.<br /><br />At first, there was my initial impulse to *buy* SHANTARAM. Buried beneath what is now perhaps pixellated miles of well-deserved kudos (see other Amazon.com reviews below) on Roberts' life-work was one particularly moving commentary which I shall dare to paraphrase. It went along the lines of: \\"...I'd been waiting for a novel like SHANTARAM for nearly forever...and if I'll never read another like it in ten years, I'll be more than satisfied. Shantaram was the one I was waiting for. I don't think I'll be as moved by anything quite like it for a long while yet.\\"<br /><br />I knew, right then and there, that SHANTARAM was something I just *had* to get my hands on. If you'll reference my review of Roberts' intriguing short tale, entitled ROMA, available at Amazon's `Shorts' section - you'll observe there how I came across this author's work quite by accident (hard to believe after SHANTARAM, though). In fact, I now sheepishly and foolishly admit that I thought Roberts short story had a `Roma,' or gypsy, theme to it, and for that reason it stood out for me, I having recently spent time in Eastern Slovakia where I've got kin.<br /><br />Once I'd opened the PDF and read it, I was quite shocked by what appeared. Combining captivating lines, true-to-character dialogues, and distinct personalities within a short few pages, Roberts' ROMA supplied just a glimpse of what was soon to become a literary feast with SHANTARAM.<br /><br />But I mentioned *two* states of grace, didn't I?<br /><br />Well, the second time came when I'd cracked the fresh paperback's binding and dug into the story of Roberts' background. The material itself - graceful, eloquent, and relentlessly magnetic -- kept me turning the pages. Grace#1 -> my impulse to buy. Grace#2 -> once I'd read it, and the impulse to continue reading. I finished this tome in less than a week (!) because - and I take a risk in saying this - it became nothing short of my obsession.<br /><br />I realize that to normally admit to such things in the course of an Amazon review is somewhat in keeping with bad taste, but seeing as we're all friends I suppose it hardly matters now.<br /><br />It was because I just needed to know what became of Lin (Roberts' alter ago), sometimes more than I felt like eating dinner. I was locked into the burgeoning love interest between Lin and the scintillatingly beautiful Karla - starcrossed lovers hailing from opposite ends of the globe - Lin from Australia (by way of New Zealand), Karla from Switzerland...I just needed to know what would become of them (which I won't spoil for you). Their dalliance was related by Roberts with such a thrilling style and drive - all hail to Roberts for pulling us along this path inexorably.<br /><br />There were heaps of such examples over the course of the nearly one thousand delightful pages of SHANTARAM...Roberts recounts his life's work with a Rod Sterling-esque, Hitchcock-ian style...even the Grand Masters themselves would have been abundantly pleased.<br /><br />In advance, I realized a review was forthcoming at the end of my read. I thought several times about plucking relevant snippets and quotables from this long narrative, to pepper them liberally in here for your later enjoyment/inspiration as part of my review. But somehow I figured it'd do nothing but spoil the `Roberts magic.'<br /><br />Lest you think there isn't a Camelot-like spell which the author casts upon you, I recommend - dear reader - nothing less than to get your hands on SHANTARAM for yourself.<br /><br />See, the seeming \\"problem\\" with works like SHANTARAM - as I'm sure author Roberts has contemplated at least a few times, perhaps moreso recently - is just *what* does he do for an encore?!<br /><br />With something *this* good, this meaningful, and this personally challenging (as most of you will come to learn,Roberts had the first two drafts of his work scrapped (!!!) by the prison authorities where he was incarcerated) I can't possibly conceive of what might follow.<br /><br />Needless to say, I won't need a recommendation.<br /><br />I'm already, as the Aussies say, \\"in like Flynn.\\"<br /><br />Word is that a film is in the works. If this doesn't win a couple of awards along the movie's journey, then Hollywood's gone all to pot and I'm going to eat my Borsalino.<br /><br />`Nuff said.was incarcerated) I can't possibly conceive of what might follow.

0425188809|5.0|In a new afterward, Koontz reveals that \\"Watchers\\" was his favorite book to write...that the words just flowed.  He mentioned that often at book signings, that Readers still say that this book is the best thing he's ever written.  I would concur.<br /><br />As ever, Koontz is a master with suspense, characterization, and words.  \\"Sun fell like an endless rain of gold doubloons on the sand and on the sea.\\"  God, but this guy is good!!

She almost seemed to know what I was saying.  Obviously she wasn't as smart as Einstein, but \\"Watchers\\" made me realize that when you have a dog that is super intelligent...it is almost as though you have a child.  Three years later, I still grieve and miss her. Thank you Mr. Koontz for letting me relive the joy - when I first discovered how very smart my dog was. I think perhaps that only another person who has owned a smart animal can understand and write about the loyalty, humor, and friendship that such a dog brings.<br /><br />\\"Watchers\\" is an analogy of good and evil; of moral responsibilities that supersede man-made laws.

B00006AW2L|2.0|I feel it didn't matter whether it was the States version, or the UK's version this album was terrible. I feel that most of the appalling material here with \\"High and Dry\\", \\"I Am Waiting\\", \\"Don'tcha Bother Me\\", \\"Lady Jane\\" which was the groups first attempt at psychedelia I suppose it comes off here as sounding like overproduced fairy talk rock though, and then there's the god-awful \\"Going Home\\" which is a eleven minute opus with Jagger doing a masturbating ritual to a harmonica solo I just didn't get it. There were some spotlights here such as \\"Paint It Black\\" which became the groups third number 1 hit which showed a progression that was in the right direction, \\"Under My Thumb\\" is alright, but it's better to hear it live as it is on \\"Got Live If You Want It\\", and \\"Still Life\\", and finally \\"Think\\" a good pounder indeed. However, the rest is just there, and therefore making this not the classic everyone thinks it is. I know people that kids in junior high school thought me cool for the moment when I talked about this album as one I wanted, but none of them ever knew that I really hated this album. It shows them trying to go psychedlic, but not sure which way to go about it as with \\"Paint It Black\\" they tried the American route with meanicing guitars, drums, and the sitar, and then with \\"Lady Jane\\" they tried fairy tale folk music which was a rather depressing love song. Not sure if this was because of pressure from the management to produce many hit records, or if it was pressure that the band put on itself to show that they could be hit songwriters, but they had already proved themselves with \\"Satisfaction\\", and \\"Get Off My Cloud\\", and a bunch of other originals what more did they need to prove? This mind you was the first album without a cover song, but it may have helped the cause a little here.
B000EWBKM6|5.0|The final episode of \\"Will and Grace\\" was in one word---excellent---if not flawless. I believe there was one too many flash forward plot elements, but this is a very minor quibble. Very poignant ending to a groundbreaking sitcom.
B00005JOVH|4.0|Fans gasped when it was announced that X-MEN and X2 director Bryan Singer was leaving X-MEN III to make SUPERMAN RETURNS - and he was taking his crew with him.  Singer told 20th Century Fox that, if they would wait until he completed SUPERMAN RETURNS, he would make X-MEN III as well.  Fox decided to go ahead without Singer, bringing numerous directors on to the project before settling on Brett Ratner.  This worried fans ever more, as they realized that Ratner's previous films included RUSH HOUR, MONEY TALKS, and THE FAMILY MAN.  What many fans forgot is that Ratner also directed the superb RED DRAGON.  Personally, I was optimistic.  Ratner's work on both RUSH HOUR movies and on RED DRAGON had impressed me, and I thought that he could do a nice job on the film.    I was right - sort of.  Ratner does a fine job, but he tends to favor shots that are either very close or very far away.  Because of this, he creates a sort of claustrophobic feeling which hung with me throughout the film.  Also, he can't wring great performances out of the actors like Bryan Singer can.  On the plus side, Ratner does create some stunning visuals (with lots of help from the special effects team) - namely a sequence involving the Golden Gate Bridge.  Though Ratner is potentially a very good director, he is nowhere near as talented as Bryan Singer.    Three other new additions to the crew are screenwriters Simon Kinberg (MR. & MRS. SMITH) and Zak Penn (BEHIND ENEMY LINES, ELEKTRA) and composer John Powell (THE BOURNE IDENTITY).  The script is good, though it feels like the events in the film are rather rushed.  Perhaps editors Mark Goldblatt, Mark Helfrich, and Julia Wong - taking over for John Ottman - are to blame for this.  I also noticed that some of Wolverine's lines seemed forced; they didn't seem natural like those from the previous films.  I must say that the ending, however, is very clever.  Very clever indeed.    Then we come to the matter of the soundtrack.  John Powell's music fluctuated between being grand and atrocious.  It's a sweeping score, but it seems a little too over-the-top.  It's not as good as John Ottman's score for X2 or Michael Kamen's score for X-MEN, but it will suffice.    The cast seemed far less stellar this time.  At her request, Halle Berry's part was expanded.  Though I've always thought that Storm was an interesting character - and Berry did very well as her in the first two films - her performance seems rather weak in this film.  Hugh Jackman is still excellent as Wolverine, but even his performance isn't as wonderful as it was in the previous films.  Then we have Ian McKellen, who is just outstanding as Magneto.  He shines in each and every one of his scenes.  Famke Janssen is great, although she doesn't get many lines.  Also great is Kelsey Grammer as Hank McCoy (a.k.a. Beast), Ellen Page as Kitty Pryde, and especially Vinnie Jones (LOCK, STOCK, AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS, SNATCH.) as Juggernaut.  Juggernaut is a hulking character whose special ability is plowing through everything and everyone with no difficulty whatsoever.  Jones turns Juggernaut into an extremely amusing character.  His scenes are the most fun of any in the film.    As both a comic book fan and an avid moviegoer, I enjoyed this film very much.  However, the comic fan within me wishes that we'd learnt the origins of Hank McCoy (which I've also found very interesting) and seen Gambit, one of the major X-Men characters from the comics (LOST's Josh Holloway, a perfect choice, was offered the part but turned it down).  Though it does seem rushed and a little short (it clocks in at 106 minutes, compared to X2's 133 minutes), I had a ball throughout the movie.  I'd have liked to see Joss Whedon or Matthew Vaughn as director (both of whom were attached to the project at one time), but Brett Ratner did a good job.  X-MEN: THE LAST STAND isn't up to par with Bryan Singer's X-MEN and X2, but it's a fine film nonetheless.

0393035158|5.0|If I could award 6 stars, I would. The issues discusses in this book are issues (and conclusions) that I have come to myself.  Beginning with Paul Hurtz's The Transcendental Temptation's sections on Mormonism and Islam, following through with Randel Helm's Gospel Fictions and Who Wrote the Gospels, as well as other books.<br /><br />But Sam Harris has done a superior job of explaining just why most religions are so harmful.<br /><br />This is a book that, were I capable of committing it to memory, I would.  There is so much in this book that needs to be remembered and quoted.<br /><br />Excellent, excellent, excellent.
0446677450|1.0|It is still amazing to me that this book is such a legend.  I read the book in one afternoon, after having it recommended to me by a co-worker.    I honestly can't see what all the fuss is about.  There is one, exactly one, tidbit of great information in the book:  that rich people tend to own and run businesses.  (He seems to mention more about real estate, probably due to his background giving \\"no money down\\" type seminars, but acquiring and managing real estate is a business, too.)    The rest of the book?  I don't consider it particularly good.  In fact, some of the advice seems particularly bad.    What do rich people teach their kids?  For one thing, they teach them to get a great education.  The rich send their kids to places like Andover and Exeter to prepare them for places like Harvard and Stanford.    Yet this book takes a decidedly derisive tone towards education.    The book contains some fables that make it easy to read, but frankly, I found them rather insulting.  Almost all the narrative devoted to lessons from \\"rich dad\\" seem to be contrived and overly simplistic.  Perhaps they really happened, but I doubt it.    How did this guy make so much money?  Well, I suspect he made a lot of money in real estate, and even more money when his book went into orbit.    However, if you follow the advice in his book, you'll find that not all of it is that readily practical.  You'll also find that some of it appears to be grossly unrealistic.    It seems that the most glowing reviews of this book are from people who have managed to miss the central point of the book entirely:  that you make more money as a business owner than an employee.    Show me 10 people who thought this book was \\"great\\" and I'll show you at least 9 people who are still working a job.    The popularity of this book is a mystery to me.  It's very long on very nebulous advice, and very short on anything tangible that you can actually go out there and do.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|Wow.  This cd is amazing.  Quite possibly the best cd of this decade in my opinion.  Pearl Jam once again prove to never disappoint, continually releasing great cd after great cd.  I loved all of the songs upon first listen.  So yeah I'm not going to write a real long review of this album.  But I will definitely tell you that you should pick this disc up-You won't be disappointed.

B000EOTAM6|5.0|I do not understand why this movie tanked at the box office.<br /><br />Great action, an engaging story, smooth direction, good special effects, and Charlize Theron in tight clothes; what more can you ask?<br /><br />But seriously, Aeon Flux is a great film and shares some interesting similarities with a sci-fi movie from long ago: Blade Runner. Wait, before you groan and move on hear me out:<br /><br />Both are set in post apocalyptic futures.<br /><br />Both are filmed with a 1940ies style.<br /><br />Both are dealing with the issues of death and what it means to be alive.<br /><br />Both movies end on an uncertain, yet hopeful note.<br /><br />...But everything in-between is, intentionally, different. Technology in the world of Aeon Flux is almost organic, society lives in a utopian world, architecture is all smooth and curved, and everything seems to be in harmony with everything else until you dig below the surface. The best example of this is the total absence of view screens; anytime someone watches a video of something it looks as if the video being reflected off the surface of water. Its great little touches like that that give this movie a unique style.<br /><br />Charlize Theron was amazing in the lead role not just for her believability but for the amount of stunts she did on her own and the training she went through. This was her first film after Monster and, while she had lost the weight, she wasn't in good shape when she got the part. It took months of physical training for her to be healthy enough for Aeon Flux, and her dedication and hard work shows.<br /><br />Watching this film the second time was even more fun; with the plot twists all known I could focus on the extra touches that I didn't consciously notice the first time around - How Aeon's jagged, anime-style haircut set her apart from the smooth, curving society around her. Camera angles and dialogue pauses that hint at the secret that this utopian world was built on. Subtle biblical references to the expulsion from paradise... If I go on I'll start spoiling the plot twists.<br /><br />This is an enjoyable film that works on every level.le biblical references to the expulsion from paradise...

1563523302|5.0|This book dispels a lot of myths about wealth, who has it, how they got it, and how they keep hold of it. <br /> <br />As insightful now as it was a dozen years ago.  This is a great book that should be required reading for anybody who wants to retire financially secure.
B000F6IOC0|5.0|This is a terrific movie. BUT you do have to go into it thinking you will see an action-filled vampire movie much like the first. You CANNOT expect to see \\"Shawshank Redemption\\" or \\"LOTR\\" quality. If you go into the movie thinking you are going to see a good vampire-action movie, you will LOVE this movie. The plot is twisted a little bit and the way everything is tied in makes \\"Underworld: Evolution\\" better than the first movie!!!
076790592X|5.0|Tuesdays with Morrie is a collection of notes taken by Mitch in 1995 during the 14 Tuesday meetings with his old professor, Morrie, who is dying from ALS, a fatal neuromuscular disease. As an international bestseller, this nonfiction is recommended for people of every age. The book guides us to look at the world and problems we face in a different perspective. Despite the fact that death can be a morbid subject, the frank discussion about life and death is very thought provoking. In today's society, life's priorities are often upside down and the book made me reconsider my philosophies of life. <br /> <br />The book tells us that the most important thing in life is to learn how to express love, and to let it come in, as in the book says, `love is the only rational act.' I feel that the chronicle discussions between them about the various aspects of life and death were natural, transparent and honest <br /> <br />We are also too wrapped up in egotistical things, career, family, money, etc, all these little acts that keep us going. The love relationships we have, the universe around us, we take those for granted.  <br /> <br />But is this all? Is that what we want? Is anything missing? Am I doing all I need to do? Am I being the person I want to be? These are questions which need to ask ourselves. <br /> <br />Lastly, how much does this book cost? Only $9.97 US! When you read it, you are actually exchanging $9.97 US for 70 years of life experience from an inspirational professor. The book is an easy read and only takes us only 7 days to read, and our value system will be changed and our lives would be more fruitful.  <br /> <br />Every page of this 192 page tiny, moving book shines with the warmth or love and humanity. But after reading the story, I realize there are no regrets for Morrie's death, as a life cycle shall, sooner or later, end. However, Morrie's memories and the lessons he teaches us will remain in my mind forever. <br /> <br />Let me ask you a question,today if George Bush dies, how many of you are going to cry over it? That is the point of my presentation. Even if you are the most powerful, if you don't have love, forgiveness and compassion for other people, your life has no meaning. <br />
B000DWMYQ8|1.0|All I can do is just mentally cry over this poor, lame, pathetic movie. WHAT IS DISNEY STUDIOS THINKING??????????? Just because CGI movies are now big in the animated world nowadays doesn't mean they should think, \\"Oh gee, nobody likes hand-drawn animation anymore. If we make anymore of those lame movies, nobody's gonna watch them, so let's make CGI movies from now on.\\"<br /><br />WRONG, WRONG, ABSURDLY WRONG!!!!!!!!!! I am so frigginly sick of CGI movies!<br /><br />STORY: Once upon a time, a nerdy little chicken (um, excuse me, a chicken is a female, not a guy) with giant green glasses with a frantic personality, who claims that the sky was falling, and nobody believes him, not even his dad (okay, now this was the only part of the movie that touched my heart, making me symphathize for poor Chicken Little. Believe me, I know how it feels not to have anyone believe you.). Then the movie industry makes a humiliating movie about the poor kid, about how he believed that there were aliens. Soon, he plays baseball, and everyone on the team picks on him because he's such a shrimp. Blah, blah, blah, I'm fast-forwarding with the story here, and soon, there's alien invasion, and then the chicken saves the day, and then the movie industry makes another stupid movie about him, making him flying in space with his friends, all buff, and the duck that he just all so suddenly has a crush on was made into this sissy girl who sighs over the chicken, who she calls \\"Ace\\" with a dreamy, sappy voice, with long eyelashes, and a revealing, slinky dress. And then the credits roll in, with everyone singing, \\"Don't go Breaking My Heart,\\" like the characters from \\"Ella Enchanted\\", another movie I'm extremely annoyed about, right at the ending.<br /><br />OMIGOD, like, Holy S**t! I can't believe this movie! It's absolutely pointless, and entirely stupid! And that movie tagline, \\"THE END IS NEAR,\\" exaggerates too much, and it's just plain stupid. Why oh why does this magical movie industry all so suddenly makes idiotic animated movies? Just ten years ago, they were doing wonderfully, and nowadays, their animated movies are just SO stupid! Why can't they continue making hand-drawn movies? I mean, someone HAS to do it! People, it's becoming a lost art, and if someone doesn't make anymore of those wonderful movies, it's going to die with the past! I hate CGI movies nowadays. It's like hogging the animated world! What about stop-motion? At least Tim Burton is smart enough not to make CGI movies, unlike the Disney Studios nowadays! And what about hand-drawn toons? Nobody's making anymore of it, and when Disney actually DO make hand-drawn movies, they're just released straight to the DVDs and videos, and never hitting theaters.<br /><br />I wonder if Walt Disney is watching his studio from Heaven. If he is, I bet he's furious with the animators there. I'm so angry at the creator of CGI movies. It would be so nice if Walt Disney could just come back to life and change the animation studio back to how it was before he died, when hand-drawn animation were successful. Even his ghost would be perfectly fine. I hope Disney Studios will get their magic back, and go back to making hand-drawn animated movies, because that's their specialty. CGI is only good for them if they were doing it with Pixar.<br /><br />-Jo W.es idiotic animated movies?

B00007JGHM|3.0|Hands down, this romantic comedy is a Hugh Jackman vehicle, as he totally steals the show from Meg Ryan. Jackman plays the role of the Duke of Albany, Leopold Mountbatten, an English nobleman visiting his uncle in New York in 1876. At his uncle's behest, Leopold is to find a rich socialite to marry, so that he may replenish the family's depleted coffers<br /><br />While at a ball in his uncle's New York house, awash with rich and eager heiresses, he notices a stranger who had earlier caught his attention. He follows the stranger and finds himself in the year 2001, as he falls through a portal in time. Landing in the apartment of Stuart Besser (Liev Schreiber), the stranger whom he had followed, he soon meets Kate McKay (Meg Ryan), Stuart's former girlfriend of four years and a modern day everywoman. Let the games begin.<br /><br />What follows is nothing earth shattering. In fact, it is pretty predictable. Leopold and Kate fall in love, though the big question is why, as there is nothing to suggest why they should. Meg Ryan does her usual Meg Ryan thing, though she is starting to get a bit little long in the tooth to be playing the brash, cutesy ingenue. She is, in fact, getting to be quite tiresome in these sorts of roles, as she plays them all exactly the same, making them virtually indistinguishable one from the other. She needs to extend her range, before her adoring public stops adoring her.<br /><br />Jackman, however, does a star turn with his gently effective and ingratiating portrayal of Leopold. He is simply sensational. Charming, handsome, and warm, with a light British accent that rings true, he is totally believable as a chivalrous gent from another time. Jackman totally upstages Ryan without meaning to do so. It is a good thing that he does. Were he not to have done so, the film would most likely have totally tanked. Clearly, Hugh Jackman is big time, leading man material.<br /><br />Liev Schreiber is unappealing as the film's erstwhile time traveler and Kate's ex-lover, Stuart Besser, who, it turns out, is the great, great grandson of the Duke. Moreover, it is not believable that Stuart and Kate would ever have dated, much less have been lovers for four years, as there is no chemistry between them. Still, it is more believable than the relationship which blossoms between Leopold and Kate. The happy ending also makes Stuart's and Kate's former relationship somewhat distasteful, if not downright incestuous, in retrospect.<br /><br />The rest of the supporting cast is fine with an excellent performance by Breckin Meyer in the role of Charlie McKay, Kate's somewhat goofy, but lovable, cute, younger brother. Bradley Whitford of West Wing fame also gives a winning performance as J.J. Camden, Kate's smarmy boss, who ultimately has second thoughts about what constitutes professional behavior and lets the cream rise to the top, so to speak.<br /><br />All in all, this is a moderately entertaining film, all but forgettable, but for the memorable performance of Hugh Jackman.nd Kate's ex-lover, Stuart Besser, who, it turns out, is the great, great grandson of the Duke.

B00008LDPU|5.0|this movie was so great.  especially the second renaissance 1 + 2.  I don't generally love anime or cartoons, but WOW everybody should own this and throw out their copys of the Matrix 1, 2 and 3.
B000EHQTZO|5.0|As a young child in the nineteen fifties, I used to watch this film whenever it appeared on TV on \\"Million Dollar Movie\\". I loved it then. I love it now. Time has not diminished the capacity of this film to mesmerize and hold the viewer in its thrall.<br /><br />The story line is basic. Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong), a filmmaker and entrepreneur, leads an expedition to Skull Island where he discovers its deep, dark secret. It is a land where time has stood still, and prehistoric monsters still hold sway over the island and its inhabitants. There, the natives pay homage to the one whom they revere as \\"Kong\\", and who is, indeed, king of the island.<br /><br />Denham, together with his beautiful, budding starlet, Ann Darrow (Fay Wray), as well as with the crew of the ship that brought him to Skull Island, investigates the strange ritual being performed on the island by its native population. Before she knows it, Ann finds herself captured by the natives. She is to become the bride of the mysterious \\"Kong\\".<br /><br />When Ann discovers who the mysterious \\"Kong\\" is, she starts screaming and doesn't stop. The ship's first mate, Jack Driscoll (Bruce Cabot), who happens to be in love with Ann, manages to rescue her from the clutches of \\"Kong\\". Notwithstanding the fact that \\"Kong\\" has taken a shine to her, Ann is relieved to have been rescued by the man whom she loves.<br /><br />Denham then arranges to capture the creature, whom he calls \\"King Kong\\" and takes him back to New York with them on the ship that brought them to Skull Island. There, King Kong makes his debut, one that movie lovers will long remember.<br /><br />The special effects of this film were superlative for its time and still pass muster today. The relationship between the beauty and the beast still makes the viewer sit up and take notice. This is an attention grabbing film that is as exciting today, as when it was first released over seventy years ago.  It is a truly timeless, cinema classic. Bravo!. Bravo!
1594200823|5.0|The buzz about this book was such that I immediately went out and bought a hardcover copy, something I almost never do.  I have long known that the corn/soybean monoculture was environmentally costly, but this is the first understandable explanation I have ever read about how the farm subsidy system works, how the overproduction of corn has contributed to the obesity epidemic, and how intricately industrial animal agriculture is connected to the corn surplus.  It is a system that is mad.  I hope a few corn farmers read this and begin to consider how they can end the madness.  Change will have to come from the grass roots:  one farmer and one consumer at a time, because we've had nothing but disastrous farm policy from the federal level for years. <br /> <br />This book excites me because it could contribute to lots of positive changes:  more vegetarianism, more healthy eating, more support for Community Supported Agriculture Farms, more support for farmers who raise animals on grass and who farm sustainably, more support for small scale agricultural processing facilities, more support for local economies, more support for farmer's markets, more support for the development of a sustainable and authentic regional food culture, in line with the Italian-originated Slow Food Movement.  The book provides more support for complex thinking!  <br /> <br />This book will succeed in reaching lots of people because it features several very well told stories.  We share Pollan's distaste as he faces the reality of the chicken slaughter house and the suffering of cows, pigs and chickens when raised in industrial systems.  We also share his delight as he experiences the wonderful Polyface Farms in Virginia, and the experience of hunting and foraging.  <br /> <br />Could this book have the same impact on our food and agriculture system that Silent Spring did in the 1960's?  I sincerely hope so. <br />
B00004VYMD|4.0|This is an enormously entertaining film that is slyly intelligent, chock full of action, and quite humorous. The time is the future, 2032 AD. The location is California, and the police just ain't what they used to be, as the future is a sanitized, politically correct world, where only the most benign behavior is the standard by which all live. Even bad language is a no no. The police of the future have nothing in common with the police of the past. Guns are outlawed, as is all physical violence. Los Angeles is no more, having merged with San Diego into a new entity known as San Angeles, which is ruled by the architect of the new society, Dr. Raymond Cocteau, who is played with sage aplomb by the late Nigel Hawthorne. He is not, however, all that he seems.<br /><br />This is, indeed, a \\"brave new world\\" and Lenina Huxley, played with delicious comic abandon by Sandra Bullock, is a police woman who waxes nostalgic for the past. The LAPD is now the SAPD. Her colleague, Alfredo Garcia, played with Eagle Scout earnestness by Benjamin Bratt, epitomizes the new order of things. He is a Dudley-do-right without the wherewithal to set right what is soon to go wrong. His is a future where everyone's whereabouts are known to the police, as all are tagged with a device that allows the police monitor their whereabouts. His is a future where all obey instantly, and civility is the standard of the day. His is a future where all address each other by their full names. His is a future where meat is no longer a food item, the use of salt is illegal, and corporate franchise wars have left Taco Bell to reign supreme as THE restaurant of the time. His is a future where sex is a non-contact activity.<br /><br />The violent past intrudes on this sanitized future in the persona of Simon Phoenix, played with over-the-top abandon by a blond Wesley Snipes, who, like a phoenix arising out of the ashes, is freed from his cryogenic prison and unleashed upon an unprepared SAPD. Clueless in the face of such testosterone charged violence, the SAPD arrange to have twentieth century super lawman John Spartan (Sylvester Stallone) released from his own cryogenic prison in hopes that he will be able to deal with the chaotic nature of Simon Phoenix and stop his senselessly violent rampage. Lenina Huxley is teamed up with Spartan in order to help him adjust to this brave new world. She is over-the-top with happiness at this development, as her fondness for nostagia will be sated by the opportunity to get up close and personal with a blast from the past.<br /><br />Needless to say, Spartan and Phoenix clash, as old warriors are wont to do. There is enough violence, mayhem, and action to satisfy the most die hard fans of this genre. What happens will not disappoint the viewer, as old scores are settled, inequitable situations are righted, and a brave new world gets a little fine tuning for the better. This action flick, sci-fi crossover does not fail to entertain, and it does so more intelligently than most films in this genre. Make no mistake, however, while Wesley Snipes gives her a run for her money, it is Sandra Bullock who steals the show with her drolly delivered dialogue, her deft comedic timing and innate charm.

B00005JNNZ|5.0|This one is definitely one of the best sports-based movies that show the growth of teens in a basketball team growing up in a neighborhood filled with bums, drug dealers, gangsters, and young students from Richmond High School, that are about to be influenced by the streets.  As this team continues to bond together, after the appearance of their new basketball coach, coach Carter (Samuel L. Jackson) the players changed for the better.   <br /> <br />As Coach Carter teaches the team members the importance of respect, education, and the heart of a champion, their growth becomes evident, along with their team's winning record.  They ceased to act like punks, and acted like champions.  They ceased to be just ball players, and became students.  They ceased to become boys, and became men.   <br /> <br />This movie is one not to be missed and is definitely inspirational to everyone, whether or not you're interested in basketball.  \\"So you can push up, or shut up!\\"
B000EHSVS2|5.0|Reading a lot of the reviews to this film the writers appear to be students of World War II.  I am not personally but I can attest to the excellence of this film probably because I viewed \\"Patton\\" more as a character study than as a war film per se.  For sure director Franklin J.Schaffner stages the war footage magnificently.  Where this film succeeds is twofold.  Firstly in the terrific script by a young Francis Ford Coppola and a later assist by Edmund North.  By focusing on George S. Patton and explaining the contradictions that were the man Coppola and North have crafted a portrait of a warrior whose actions would deceive you into thinking he was a warmonger.  Secondly you have an absolutely spellbinding performance by George C. Scott.  Scott has you mesmerized throughout and your eyes never leave him despite the bombast that surrounds him.  For sure Scott demonstrates the maverick side of the man but he is equally effective in the quieter pensive side of Patton.  Do yourself a favor and listen to the commentary track by Coppola.  Coppola offers insight into the genesis of the project and has the forbearance to be quiet during crucial moments in the film.
6305907145|3.0|I have not read Jane Austen's novel \\"Mansfield Park\\", so cannot address how well this movie does or does not carry the spirit of the book.  However, the back cover of this DVD calls this a \\"fun and sexy comedy,\\" leading me to believe it would have the same light-hearted humor in \\"Emma\\" (Gywneth Paltrow version) or even the recent Keira Knightley portrayal of Lizzie in \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". <br /> <br />Instead, we get a fairly dark movie that addresses the grim reality of the torture and sexual abuse suffered by slaves in Antigua, abject poverty (Fanny's rather slovenly family), reputations ruined by adultery, lascivious attentions paid to Fanny by her benefactor and even by a female \\"friend.\\"  This movie is only a comedy in the sense of the word that means \\"ending in marriage\\", but don't expect humor or light-heartedness. <br /> <br />I give it three stars because it's certainly not a terrible movie as a drama, but the DVD cover, which also calls this movie a \\"smart, playful and funny hit,\\" is criminally misleading.
B000002BMV|5.0|Hey, just don't forget that this is the album with their 3 most known songs (Open Arms, Who's Crying Now, Don't Stop Believin')<br />This release is not competitive with their previous releases, Escape suppased them by far, with this huge success Journey started a new circle in their career, this is the album that changed their status and gave them the status of Superstars.<br /><br />Also the success of Escape is maybe the only reason that their early-year albums recieved multi-platinum status.<br />Their two next albums, Frontiers and Raised on Radio were their most successful efforts for a strong and brave comeback, but everyone will remember Journey for their romantic ballads from Escape and espesially their biggest hit \\"Open Arms\\".<br /><br />This Album holds them to one of the greatest and highest positions of rock music's entire history.
B00000255F|5.0|Since Rock & Roll began, there have been a few key turning points in it's history. Certian points, like the release of Elvis Presley's \\"Thats Alright Mama\\", or The Beatles on the Ed Sullivan show brought about huge changes in musical thought and attitude. Bruce Springsteen accomplished no less than this when he released \\"Born To Run\\" in '75. Reving up the engine with his first two LP's. His third album had the perfect fuel mixture and torque to race into Rock & Roll legend. Bruce combined all his influences. Chuck Berry's rebellious rock with descriptive lyrics, the introspective songs of the 60's and the ever growing anthem rock of the 70's. Story telling may not have been a new art form, but this was our story he is telling. In \\"Thunder Road\\" he writes \\"riding out to case the promised land\\" and i felt myself wanting to go! As a teenager at the right age, i really did have \\"barefoot girls sitting on the hood of a dodge (actually a Ford, same concept though). But words are just poetry by themselves. Bruce formed a band (including himself) thats rocks as talented and as hard as his lyric are moving. I recommend his other classics like \\"Darkness\\" and The River\\" to get the full compliment of his Rock & Roll range and heart. But to me, with \\"Born To Run\\", Bruce Springsteen put himself in some pretty good musical company, and influenced my heart for good.
B000000H3Z|5.0|Before this album, Sepultura struggled to make a decent album. Their first two albums were plagued with horrible production quality and lack of substance but then in 1989, Sepultura released \\"Beneath the Remains\\" which became an instant classic. First of all the production quality was much better and still holds up today. This is Sepultura's heaviest album and the one with the best guitar work. The best solo is probably the one in \\"Inner Self\\". This album doesn't have the Brazilian influence on \\"Chaos A.D.\\" and \\"Roots\\". This is straightforward death/thrash metal that's very similar to Slayer. My favorite songs are the title track(one of the best intros ever) and \\"Inner Self\\". This is a must-own album and is my second favorite Sepultura album. Only \\"Chaos A.D.\\" comes ahead. Avoid all of the Derrick Green [...]!
1400079179|4.0|Handsdfdd, djfei kdseikd, skjaddfd. Djdaie skdk dfsks dkeisp. Did you understand any of that? I didn't think that. But you know what? That's what some of the Da Vinci Code sounds like. This book takes a very high reading level to complete, but if you have it in you, it can be the best book of your life. Even if it's not, it can still make your day great. I hope that it will be better than the days that Robert Langdon had to go through.<br /><br />  It starts out with Robert being woken in the middle of the night to news that the owner of the Louvre, who he was supposed to have met the previous night, is dead. When he visits the body, the police and himself find many clues to a secret society that protected the secrets of Jesus and Christianity. With only the help of the owner's granddaughter Sophie, Robert has to figure out why he is being framed for the murder and why there is an albino monk trying to kill him. And things worsen after he realized that the man he considered a friend and went to for help is working for the bad guy!<br /><br />  Now, you may think that the opinion of a 13-year-old isn't that important, but if you want to hear what I have to say, then listen up. This book has everything that a mystery/action book needs. It has parts in it that make you think that the jig is up. Once, Robert and Sophie are in the back of an armored truck trying to escape from a Swiss Deposit Bank. The police are right there, but they escape thanks to some quick thinking of the president of the bank who is trying to help. This book also gives a nice history lesson as well. Whatever you may not know about the Egyptian and other times like that. Along with that, it provides a real challenge to try to solve the puzzles before they do.<br /><br /> I would recommend this book to anybody 14 and over or child prodigies. I also think that anybody who enjoys high level reading. I think that Dan Brown is one of the greater authors of all times. If you like the Da Vinci Code, I think that you should check out his other books, such as Angels and Demons and Deception Pass. But don't take my word for it, go and read it for yourself.If you like the Da Vinci Code, I think that you should check out his other books, such as Angels and Demons and Deception Pass.

B0006L16N8|1.0|This is an overrated mess that is loved because it's different from other crap on MTV. Chris Martin has an extremely whiney voice that's so god-damn annoying, it'll make you want to rip your hair out. The guitars are boring. The drums are piles of drab. The bass is inaudible and the pianos although the strongest part of the band are also mediocre at best. This band got a ton of Grammy nominations because they have bad taste in music. Why don't they nominate Opeth, Nevermore, Judas Priest, or Dark Tranquallity for the Grammys? Because they suck and all they love is ColdCRAP!
0316172324|4.0|Under normal circumstances, it's a given that all books you must read for classes are not enjoyed.  (That's some thin slicing for those who have already read this book.)  But here, I was skeptical because I really enjoyed the class I was supposed to read it for.  Good thing I was! <br /> <br />This book demonstrates the idea that the first little snap judgments we make about things tend to be more accurate than the lengthy analyzations we make, and does it in a non preachy manner (even devoting an entire chapter strictly to its flaws).  The chapters are more example-based than textbook-based, meaning that they consist of real people demonstrations (as if news articles are intermixed; was Gladwell a journalist?) of whatever the chapter's topic is.  It's quite fascinating. <br /> <br />If for nothing else than a reason to reconsider your first thoughts on ANYTHING and learn how they might have been MORE ACCURATE, read this book!
B000AMJG4Y|3.0|Fans of FFVII are going to love this movie due to the nostagila (if you want to call it that, FFVII is not that old), but people unfamilar with the game probably won't like it. It has a pretty weak plot, but some awesome action scenes and just great special effects in general. <br /> <br />I enjoyed it, but I was hoping for a little bit more in terms of a story.
B00005OM4N|2.0|Britney Spears's Britney album is a 12 track fiasco. Only two songs truly grabbed my attention which are That's Where you Take me, and Lonely. She shows potential on songs like Anticpating and Let Me Be but the rest of the songs are pretty awful and embarrasing like the song, Bombastic Love. In the Zone and Oops...I did it again are her best albums. Of course lately I could care less about Spears, her career is in the toilet and she knows it. This album was a waste of time and money for the pop princess, I am sorry to say but she could use some singing lessons, her success ain't because she has a spectacular voice, her success is all image. This disc belongs in a junk yard, skip this one.
0312995423|1.0|I won't waste time rehashing the bazillion technical mistakes others have documented.  This is a stupid story with unbelievable characters and guessable plot twists.  Am I really so smart that I can solve problems faster than world authorities?  Not really - if I were really smart, I wouldn't have finished the book.
B0000TG9E2|5.0|Walt Disney's Alice in Wonderland is one of my favorite animated films. Some great characters in this one, the smoking caterpillar, chesire cat, the queen of hearts, the mad hatter, and of course that busy White Rabbit. Alice in Wonderland is such a sweet, sensitive and quite risque film, clearly the caterpillar isn't smoking incense but this film is classic, I love it so much. I can't wait til my nephew starts watching this film. Other Disney films I enjoy include: The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Cinderella, and The Lady and the Tramp. I highly recommend Alice in Wonderland, could this movie be any better? I think not.
B00005JOVH|5.0|....And the summer movie season is off!!!  X-Men: The Last Stand is the first REAL blockbuster of the year and a great action film!  The third installment of this X-Men franchise brings us the appearance of new characters, old ones and a the transformation of Jean Grey into the Phoenix, all in one movie.<br /><br />The plot involves humans discovering a \\"cure\\" for those who wish to be rid of their mutant powers and blend into society.  While both sets of mutants, led by Professor Xavier and Magneto, respectively, do not agree with a cure, the two take different view points on how to deal with the situation.  Magneto decides it is time for the mutants to stand up to the unevolved humans who are trying to erradicate anyone with mutant powers.  Xavier's X-Men knows it is up to them to stop their evil counterparts from going to war with humanity.<br /><br />This film marks a huge change in the franchise.  There is the death of THREE major characters, major characters lose their powers to the \\"cure\\" and there are changes in leadership at Xavier's school.  Magneto's Brotherhood is also affected, left in shambles by the end of the movie.<br /><br />While I enjoyed the film, I do have some small complaints.  I'd liked to have seen the director do more with Angel.  He was pretty much left with nothing to do.  To be honest, I would loved to have seen the Phoenix hang around for another film.  The Phoenix is such an interesting and complex character, I think we could have benefited from another appearance in the franchise.<br /><br />As for compliments, I really enjoyed Kelsey Grammer as Beast. I really hope we see more of him in the next film. I think the director did a good job of keeping the story fast moving and giving the fans a lot of action.  And the ending pretty much shows us that things are not over.  I, for one, am looking forward to the revamped mutants and the next challenge they will face.  Worth your money and highly recommended!<br /><br />(I just edited my review to encourage movie fans to stay until the end of the credits.

B000EDWKXI|4.0|This flick was something I picked because of the Casanova-meets-his-match aspect, and that wasn't disappointing.  However, I expected a tamer, romantic drama, instead this movie keeps upping the comic twists until it reaches a very cheesy climax and denouemant.  I was delighted!  My husband and I kept snorting at some subtle dig here or there, until they became overt.  The climax was a little over the top, but that's my opinion.  (I also thought the Pirates of the Caribbean climax was over the top the first time I saw it, and then it grew on me.)  Very fun, and this movie will definitely go on my wishlist.  If you enjoy romantic comedy, you should enjoy this movie.  If you enjoy beautiful scenery, you'll enjoy this movie, but only if you can enjoy the comedy at the same time.
B0000A118M|5.0|Before I begin, let me cover some ground that should be addressed . . . Mark J. Slezak's review of this CD has been rated as not being helpful. THAT IS RUBBISH. Reviews should NOT simply gush praise upon a CD - something which I shall being doing forthwith - they should offer an honest opinion buttressed by some foundation of familiarity. Mark admits that he if fan of jazz and notes several artists that he admires; then he offers his opinion with respect to Coltrane's \\"A LOVE SUPREME.\\" His review has value and, for some, has merit. I would suggest a listen to Ornette Coleman's [[ASIN:B000002I55 Free Jazz (A Collective Improvisation)]]. A chaos most infuriatingly beautiful.<br /><br />As for my opinion of John Coltrane's \\"A LOVE SUPREME\\" - there are hundreds of thousands of nascent Jazz fans who have one single CD in their collection: [[ASIN:B000002ADT Kind of Blue]] And, if truth be told, my Jazz Listening Fellow Felons, knowing such a fact as this inspires a bout of crestfallia in yours, definitively.

Upon first listening, the unfamiliar, faced with this unfamiliarity, may be nudged to listen away to weaker sounds. But, with each successive listen, you will - on my sacred honour -fall deeply for Coltrane's \\"LOVE SUPREME.\\" For I assert - with a certain kind of klint - that \\"A LOVE SUPREME\\" is a very nearly a perfect sound, from note 1, to note 2, to note OUT.<br /><br />dmaVE SUPREME.\\" For I assert - with a certain kind of klint - that \\"A LOVE SUPREME\\" is a very nearly a perfect sound, from note 1, to note 2, to note OUT.     dma
B00005JOVH|4.0|This is a fine entry in the X-Men film series, and possibly the last one (though never say never when millions of dollars are on the line). <br /> <br />X-Men 3 concerns the discovery of a \\"cure\\" for mutancy and what implications it has for the mutant community. Those who view their mutations as being not only good, but a step in the evolutionary process, are led once again by Magneto against the X-Men. Also, Jean Grey comes back from her apparent death in the second film, but not all is quite right with her. <br /> <br />This movie shares some of the strengths and weakness of the earlier films. Strengths include great casting and, thus, performances. Having Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen share a screen is simply awesome, and it's always nice to get Halle Berry and Rebecca Romijn on camera. :) Weaknesses include trying to fit too much into the film; this series has always been weakened in that it tries to satisfy all of the X-Men fans by shoving every character in, in one way or another. As a result, we finally get Angel...  but only for about 10 minutes of screentime. Juggernaut gets even less. Someone less familiar with the comics might get confused with all of the characters, running on and off screen for a few shots. I think it would've worked out better if they'd had fewer characters and plotlines altogether, and concentrated more on them. <br /> <br />Truth-be-told, this is probably the weakest installment of the series. The writing is a little cliche at times, and Cyclops' character continues to be grossly misused. There once was talk of Joss Whedon being involved in this project, but it never came to pass. I wish he had; Whedon has a magic with him that this movie could've used. And yet, the movie is very entertaining and never dull. <br /> <br />Big Tip: almost everyone walked out from our theater when the credits began to roll (they always do). Don't do it. Wait till the credits are over; there's an important scene after the credits which pays off something subtly set-up earlier in the film. <br /> <br />All in all, this is a fun movie that will reward those who've watched and enjoyed the first two. Despite a small decline in quality (from the *stellar* X2), it remains entertaining, larger-than-life, well acted and with stunning special effects. A good Hollywood movie.
B000059ZLH|5.0|The album was probably one of the best musical pieces ever and everything I do in music today is influenced in some way by that album, the way they wrote it as a musical play is just amazing. However the DVD just blows everything else that's out there! The way they play on this album, their smoothness and the setup of the show are just unbelievable. The image quality is very good, the sound is near perfect. Something I thought was very good was the little film transitions during the songs, they really help you get into the atmosphere of this great storyline. Even though they weren't extrememly well acted, they were an enjoyable bonus. <br />The 2nd DVD has a very nice picture gallery where you more of Portnoy's butt than actual pictures, just kidding! <br />The 5 extra live songs are as well recorded as the main DVD and they are truly well played, mostly \\"A change of seasons\\" which is to me their best song to this date. <br />The behind the scenes documentary is nice and gives nice info on the band out of shows. <br />Overall this a wonderful DVD that will keep you watching for a very long time, and after it's over, you will want more!
B00005JMYI|3.0|Stupid comedy is an art. <br /> <br />Like with any art, sometimes it works out and sometimes it doesn't.... On the top end of the stupid comedy scale, we have films like Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, the Wedding Singer, Spaceballs and Mystery Men. On the other end of the scale, we have all of the Rob Schneider movies and a few of the Pauly Shore ones. Dodgeball is closer to the bottom, There's Something About Mary is closer to the top. <br /> <br />Anchorman is right about in the middle. The humor works... sometimes... like the gangfight scene. That's pretty funny. But sometimes Anchorman falls flat, like the \\"jazz flute\\" sequence. The jazz flute bit is kind of lame. <br /> <br />People who don't usually like stupid comedy probably won't like Anchorman much at all; the humor relies on Ferrell's mugging and obnoxious overacting. Some of the casting is good, some misses the mark--Steve Carell is comedy gold, and usually Fred Willard is, too, but he looks a bit miscast in his role, here. The cameos are awesome, bringing in Tim Robbins, Luke Wilson, Jack Black, Ben Stiller and others. <br /> <br />Overall, this is an inconsistent film. Some people are going to absolutely love it, others are going to hate it. Me? I was a little disappointed, but it's still an okay movie. It's not Ferrell's best work--he's better in Zoolander, Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back and the Producers, for instance--but he does a fine job nonetheless. Among stupid comedies, it's of a comfortable, middle quality.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Blood Sugar Sex Magik, is with out doubt probably one of the best albums ever produced. So what do you expect? To see them make a copy of it? <br />No the Red Hot Chili Peppers aren't like that, every album is differant (Its Is!). <br />BSSM - Pure Funk, and the odd nice slow track. <br />OHM - Mmmmmm, not to good, I can't really tell what genre this is, some good atempts. <br />Californacation - More slow, I would not say Pop, but I would not say rock (well its more rock then pop.) <br />BTW - Pop, Melancholy. <br />SA - Melancholy, Pop, Funk, Acoustic. <br /> <br />See, SA has got loads of differant genres, so its not like Californacation or BTW. <br />This album is like, abit from BSSM, abit from OHM (SA has got a couple bad songs.) abit from Californacation, abit form By The Way. <br /> <br />And do not tell me, this album is only filled with BTW because its not, its alot differant, you just need to listen, maybe that would help. <br /> <br />This is my second favourite RHCP album, and may climb. <br />Buy It!
B00005JOYC|5.0|This movie was excellent. I went to see it in the movies three times even though it costs around $7 for a ticket. Some of you (and most definately some previous reviewers) may not realise that this movie was adapted from a video game series of the same name. If you liked the movie and are into video games as well, I encourage you to try out one of the games.
B000F6IOC0|3.0|I found the first one to be just \\"okay\\". This one was a bit better, but not by much. It had the cliche hot chick in leather kicking ass and all eyes were on her, but I was more interested in Speedman's character. I think because he was supposed to be so special, that he would have more to do or say in the film. The plot wasn't necessarily what I wanted, but hey.
B00005AAFS|2.0|Whats the deal with the 5 star reviews here?  This is not a 5 star album even if you are a fanboy.  1-6 is good solid stuff, but the rest of the album is quite repetative and boring.  ALot of very boring and predictible riffs and drumming.  I know that they are not a technical band but I could easily snooze through most of the songs they aren't too creative.  I am a fan of their other albums though because those ones are better written than this.
B000002UDG|5.0|When compiling this retrospective 'best of' compilation Mr McCartney wisely ignored all of his output from his ill advised stint with the Beatles and selected songs purely from his solo career and his other band Wings. Let 'Em In, Mull of Kintyre and of course the Frog Chorus are true classics not to be missed. Get it now!
B00005JOVH|2.0|Another name for this film might be \\"And Then There Were None\\" considering the killing off of the characters.  The thing was very short, predictable and for the first time, hokey,almost as if the actors were playing at a movie.  Once again, special effects saved the day but after the first 10 times of seeing objects (or people) turned into molecules by Jean (or was it her evil twin?) you want to say, \\"All right, we get it, she's a Class 5.\\"   <br /> <br />The logical question one might ask is why, with all of Jean's galaxy-defying powers does Magneto need an army of Mutants to seize the \\"cure\\" (ball headed aloof lad in gownlike clothing)?We descend into pure teenage angst - will the Freezer & Roane ever make it or will he find true love in the arms of walking through walls lass? Will the school go on or must they give up the daily lectures on being good little mutants? (What DO they learn at this place?)  <br /> <br />To say I was disappointed is an understatement. Amazingly, the reaction of the audience was the same as mine - Is this all there is?  The story was trite - a mutant cure is found and they will be offered a chance to become human. Alas, the cure is a young lad who permanently removes all mutant powers. The evil Magneto sees a chance to lead the Mutant world in a fight for supremacy and gathers his flock. For some reason, the President's son is a mutant although how sprouting wings like the archangle Gabriel can be considered a mutant \\"power\\" fails me. He makes a couple of quick appearances then flies into the sunset.   <br /> <br />Then again, I may be trying to find coherence where none was planned, logic where illogic reigns and continuity where all that was called for was a series of individual vignettes loosely related to each other.  Here's hoping for a better Xmen IV. <br />  <br />
B000000WCA|4.0|Everyone admired the spice girls for their marvellous 'girl power' attitude, which frankly put the suffragette movement of the early twentieth century to shame, and nobody can deny the catchiness of their tunes. One quibble however - what's this 'zigazigah' that they are claiming women really, really want. I have no idea what a zigazigah is or how to present it to a lady. Come on girls - be more specific!. I also lost a perfectly good ladyfriend when I attempted to 'get with' her friends as they suggested. Verdict: Good music but don't take it too literally.
B000EOTAM6|4.0|Don't need or have to know the history of this movie's origins with MTV to enjoy it. <br /> <br />Sci-fi movies aren't always my favorite genre to watch, so was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. Charlize Theron did an excellent job of playing the lead role of Aeon Flux as I wouldn't have thought she'd be good at this particular role!! This role had seemed more suited for Angelina Jolie! <br /> <br />Loved the settings and costumes for this movie. Aeon Flux is set 400 years in the future and most futuristic movies made over the years have been very dark, drab, & dreary..... Aeon Flux's settings are light and bright and are very nature inspired... a more feminine feel. The costumes are great.... a sexy few to them. <br /> <br />Thought the writers of the script did an excellent job of translating the original animation series to a non-animated movies with real characters and settings.
B00009P1MP|3.0|I am a huge fan of Buddy Holly and as such was touched to hear that Mr McLean had written a tribute to his hero. The tune is pleasant enough and I was tapping along happily until we got to the chorus. Why is it that Mr McLean feels it necessary to repeatedly refer to the late Buddy Holly as 'Miss American Pie'. I think this is a preposterous and inappropriate epithet for such a wonderful musician. A pity.
B000ETRCMQ|5.0|My curiousity to see \\"TRANSAMERICA\\" (2005) was based almost entirely on the critical raves it received, especially for Felicity Huffman's performance.  Those honors (Best Actress wins in Golden Globe and Independent Spirit Award, nominee for SAG and Academy Award) are well deserved, in an very difficult role as a male-to-female transexual, dealing with pre-op jitters, complicated by the sudden appearance of a teenage son (Kevin Zegers) she fathered and never knew about.<br /><br />While Bree (Felicity's character) is clear about her transgender nature, and knows she is doing the right thing by going through with the operation, the emotional baggage from her childhood and earlier life make her passive and weak-spirited.  She almost has to be bullied into flying from Los Angeles to New York City to meet her 16 year old son, in trouble with the police there after having run away from an abusive stepfather following his mother's death.  Although very different from Toby, they are, in some ways, kindred spirits, in that both have low self-esteem and a degree of self-loathing.  She chickens out from telling Toby she is his father, instead claiming to be a church missionary.  He insists he wants to go to California, and they set out driving together cross country, learning about each other as well as themselves.<br /><br />Huffman's acting (and makeup) is incredible, with her voice even descending further in one part of the film (when she is without her pre-op hormones).  The handsome and talented Zegers is also perfect for his role, as a streetwise but somewhat insecure young man looking for love and acceptance.  Beautifully photographed (in NY, AZ and CA), the screenplay is witty, realistic and positive. I was expecting the transexual aspect of the film to be front-and-center in the story, and was pleasantly surprised that it was almost incidental to the real focus of the story: learning to love and accept yourself as the first step in being able to relate to and love anyone else.  The fact that the message could have just as easily been delivered by a gay or lesbian (or straight) character reinforces the concept that, as different as we may be on the surface, we are all really very similar where it counts.  I give it five full stars out of five; this one is a permanent addition to my DVD collection.<br /><br />Rated R for incidental nudity (Zegers) and adult content.  DVD has excellent extras including director commentary, interviews with Huffman and Zegers, video of the Dolly Parton's catchy Oscar-nominated song \\"Travelin Thru\\", and a blooper reel.ove anyone else.

B00005OAIE|3.0|I like enough of John Mayer to purchase this CD new - unusual for me, because I'm cheap and tired of getting really crappy music for my money.  <br /> <br />While Room for Squares is not terrible, it's not great, either. The songs from the radio are the best, of course, but some of the other songs sound exactly like, well, other songs on the CD. The lyrics might be different, but the sound is same. <br /> <br />This is a great CD for relaxing or if you want something under conversation when you have people over, but it does get a bit annoying after a while. Put it on shuffle with a good variety and you'll be OK.
B000BDJ60Q|5.0|As time passes by inexorably and relentlessly, and I think of the many thousand of songs I've heard, changed in style and sophistication, I come back time and again to The Kick Inside. This album doesn't just stand the test of time - it makes time stand still. At once haunting (The Man With the Child in His Eyes) and feel-good (James and the Cold Gun)there quite simply is not a bad track on the album: in fact, every track is just so effortlessly exceptional.  This album defines the term 'classic' - a 'must have' in your collection!
B00003CX5P|3.0|The Phantom Menace was probably one of the most anticipated movies of all time, and ended up disappointing a lot of folks.  The DVD release has fared better.  The DVD contains lots of special features that describe the technical, human, and creative work that went into creating Episode I.  In doing so, this DVD has set the foundation by which all newer DVD releases are measured; how completely do the special features describe the movie and all the thought and work that went into making and advertising it.  Ignoring the movie itself, there are several features of the DVD that could have been improved.  First, the extra and deleted scenes should have been incorporated into the movie itself, or the DVD should have come with an option whereby the viewer can watch the movie with or without these extra scenes.  Second, for a movie advertised throughout the world, the DVD should have came with subtitles in more languages.  Third, it would have been nice for the DVD to include a special feature that breaks down the cost of making this movie.  <br /> <br />Now to the movie itself.  <br /> <br />1. The music was good but not great.  Too much of the music was a rehash from the first (last) three movies.   <br /> <br />2. The acting was wooden in many places.  More specifically, there was not enough of it.  The movie was essentially dictacted by action scenes, when it should have been a movie about relationships.  For example, the relationship between Anakin and Qui Gon Jin should have been expanded into a central part of the story, such that the death of the latter would be the first of many scars on Anakin's psyche that would eventually turn him to the dark side.  This is also another failing of the movie; it shows no emotional connection between the death of Qui Gon and Anakin. <br /> <br />3.  For a movie franchise that has so many female fans, it would have been nice to have had more female lead characters.  One example would have been to make Qui Gon Jin's character a woman.  We don't see a major female Jedi knight in any of the six movies.  Imagine that; Anakin leaves his mother and comes under the care of a foster mother - who later dies in battle and emotionally scars Anakin.  This in turn would set up the loss of his real mom in Episode II and his wife in Episode III.   <br /> <br />4. Why do so many of the alien races talk in English; especially in English that sounds like that spoken by foreign immigrants to the USA?  Watto and Sebulba were the two most believable alien characters for me in this movie; and they both spoke in different tongues. <br /> <br />5. The podrace scene was astounding.  It gets my vote for the greatest race scene ever.    <br /> <br />6. There should have been more development of Darth Maul's character and the origins of the Sith lords.  Being Episode I, there needs to be more backstory to such a complex galaxy that Lucas has created. <br /> <br />7. Part of the mystery and mystique of the first (last) three episodes are the surprises it pulls; Vader being Luke's dad, Leia being Luke's sister, the trap Palpatine lays for the rebels on Endor, etc...  This is totally absent in The Phantom Menace.  Most importantly, the character of Palpatine and Darth Sidious are given away immediately.  And Palpatine's head of the Galactic Senate is a total giveaway for his eventual dictatorship.  A more clever and interesting way would be keep Palpatine's character on the side and less powerful until the very end (Episode III).    <br /> <br />8. Why didn't the Jedi go to rescue Anakin's mom from slavery at the end of Episode I and bring her somewhere safer or at least closer to Anakin?  Or for that matter why didn't the Jedi knights free her from Watto?  Slavery was illegal and there would have been nothing Watto could have done to keep Shmi if the Jedi Knights took her... <br /> <br />All in all a good movie and a good DVD, but neither are great.
B00030590I|3.0|The movie Hero was a very interesting movie, because it was separated into different sections with different colors for different stories. There were black, green, red, white, and blue, each colors represent a different perspective of what really happened.  <br /> There were four main characters in the movie, Flying snow, Broken Sword , Nameless Warrior and the emperor. Each character had their own personality and uniqueness, but all of them had the same goal and purpose, and it was to kill the emperor. I think the characters Broken Sword and Nameless Warrior were the only two characters that had a turning point in their personality and goal. They both wanted to kill the emperor in the beginning, but towards the end, they looked at the problem in a more in depth way and decided it the whole country would be worse than it is now if the emperor was killed.  <br /> I think the different perspectives and the different colors of the stories made the whole movie really confusing. While I was watching the movie, I didn't now which perspective I was watching. And after the movie, when I was looking back to review the movie, it is really easy to confuse the different stories.  <br /> This is a movie I would watch if I was fully awake and not tired, because if you are tired, it would be very hard to follow through the movie. <br />

0142000663|5.0|I read maybe two books a year, and it's sometimes hard to keep up with this characters and details of a book as a result.  However, I found very few dull spots in this book.  This is a hard book to put down and once you do...you won't be able to forget about the story.  I enjoy reading fiction with a strong historical backdrop.  This book offers itself as a good historical reference, as well as a wonderful story of personal and societal struggles.  This is an adult reading and I highly recommend it.
0743454537|5.0|I loved this book.  I cried my eyes out.  It contains great characters, an important topic for our era, good storytelling.  I could have lived without the Jesse storyline, it adds little to the book and it is resolved in a very cursory fashion.  But that is the nature of minor characters and subplots.  I thought the book was well-written and sympathetic to many different points of view.  Brava, Ms. Picoult!  I will probably look for more of your works.  I have already recommended the book to friends.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This movie does just what a classic love story should.  It takes two headstrong people with (very) different backgrounds and throws them together against the backdrop of an over-polite society and social prejudice. <br /> <br />Each and every actor in this film is perfect and thoroughly believable. <br /> <br />Kiera Knightley, though playing a character with limited opportunity to show her evident quickness of tongue, managed to jut her chin and give back-handed insults just enough to flaunt the independent spirit of Elizabeth Bennet. <br /> <br />Matthew Macfadyen as Mr. Darcy was an interesting casting choice.  What I particularly like about this man was that he isn't your average pretty boy.  Macfadyen gave the character (and audience) something more than just the gorgeous smile and perfectly placed hair so often seen on Hollywood screens. <br /> <br />Rosamund Pike, playing Elizabeth's sister Jane, shone in a supporting role.  Her short scenes were beautiful, full of hope, tears-on-cue, and occasional self-doubt. <br /> <br />And it's not just Rosamund either.  The other supporting characters, in all their glory, delivered just enough giggling or disdain or awkwardness as was required. <br /> <br />I definitely enjoyed this movie.  It made me think.   <br /> <br />Just a warning: you may be initially caught off guard by a certain important protestation of love from one character to another, but, upon review, you will discover that significant looks and the like were evident throughout the earlier bits of the film. <br /> <br />Rent or buy this ASAP - you won't regret it! <br /> <br /> <br />
B000001GY9|5.0|it is curious to ponder what Schumann thought orchestration was suppose to be,what was in his mind when writing for the orchestra,we know these Symphonies have been \\"re-done\\",in parts touched to augment their clarity by the modern world; we know Brahms and Bruckner thought in \\"organ-like\\" formations,whatever the flute played the violins played, similarly,the violas bassoons and cellos all had the same line most of the time; hardly any(well middle -Romantic) sensitivity to the reality of timbre;only latter in life did timbre come to their imagination(as latter Bruckner, and the \\"chamber Brahms\\",Trio) Schumann as well had much difficulty with instrumental colour(the large piano repertoire solos being the exception) almost like he composed his entire oeuvre with one colour in mind,one-dimensional like a toneless \\"grey\\",and any interpretations of Schumann that have risen to the heights of intellectual interests,(or purely musical ones) ones worth a second approach are those where you have strong performers as Michelangeli,Brendel and Horowitz, and the fairly recent Pires Quintet,(with the Abbado orchestra?, DGG label)Piano and string quartet. There you find an overwhelming clarity and a sensitivity to the clarity of timbre,the performance suggests much more than what is on the page,for if your care to survey the literature of Schumann chamber, it is fairly uninteresting.<br />Here as well Lenny's direct \\"hit-em-in-the guts\\" approach works very well,gets the sound, the resonance high in the air,strikes the ear with propulsion,it must compete with all the other stuff you hear; anything short of this aggression is pure myopic wrongheaded boredom as one reviewer who falls from the \\"5-Star\\" Fold, please don't! you are only encouraging mediocrity, and Schumann's music is for the most part very mediocre,Brahms spent his entire life \\"out-doing\\" him (for Clara hey Johannes!) I think sitting here in the 21st Century we can be arrogant and pick and choose what we care to buy incessantly and listen to while barbarism continues around the globe, but let's not get too severe here. Lenny's approach knows how to impart, charge the music, impell, compell \\"cattle-prod\\" it forward with an aggressive sense of rhythm, and he is not afraid of allowing the Vienna musicians to overdo the gesture at times,making \\"ugly\\" sounds for he knows clarity will always be there,unlike with the New York Phil where mistakes were commonplace during his reign there. Only Boulez came to clean,mop-up the technical mess. The music speaks for itself, listen to the recordings man!!.I don't need to exaggerate for rhetorical effect.Listen to the vinyl archive.<br /><br />Schumann is well disposed here even the \\"Rhenish\\" only von Karajan comes close to offering the power and arrogance, something he is good at, very good at in his \\"cathedral-like\\" bottom to top visions, or \\"ill-visions\\" in the music. But he was a corporate dog anyway. Lenny on the other hand only had the music in mind within his last days, and as another reviewer had mentioned the LIVE performance is what Lenny does best, nobody does it better. Schumann's music has enough contrast long enough to hold your interest with frequent excursions transformations in textural, with reedy winds introduced to put the strings at rest, but the aggressive power here suits the motifs of Schumann's aesthetic.Mostly shaped in classical proportions with the frequent \\"Schnell\\", fast Scherzo movment he was good at;Curious how much of these Symphonies seems to hover in the Beethoven spectres of gestures ,large robust statements mixed with \\"interlude\\",like passages,lots of telescoping of the music;s materials as well,all around. One wonderful aspect of Schumann's music is that he really did not want to follow Ludwig down that road of the pure symphonist,the pure abstractedness of the music, time to get beyond, transcend the Viennese Master Signifier, and I'm sure Schumann did set up the creative paradigm for the future with the comingPost-Romantics Mahler, Bruckner, R. Strauss and early Schonberg, with his focus on inner subjectivity,the private contemplative that any image can become transformed into the Romantic spirit, a la Schiller.This part is not here however; The private introspection is really not here from Lenny he is more the social gregarious interlocutor,making the BIG statement, the grandiose, the stately, the Maestoso.You will like the clarity of sound of balance and part playing,the ensemble phrasing as well is somewhat more disciplined than previously Lenny.Schumann have more \\"compact\\" features, more surface than Mahler makes this set much more a unified whole than the Vienna and Lenny together you will also find on Compact disk and DVD.tics Mahler, Bruckner, R.

0143036556|5.0|Jared Diamond must have a wonderful life. He spent years researching Collapse in Asia, Australia, Europe, the Americas, and various islands. He spoke with hundreds of fascinating experts: from natives of Easter Island to professors of Japanese history. And he got paid for it all.<br /><br />Dr. Diamond has found out what causes civilizations to collapse, and how other civilizations have managed to survive. He has written it down in clear and entertaining style, even if he does include a lot more information than anyone really needs to understand the issues.<br /><br />His conclusions: Societies collapse because of resource exhaustion, environmental degradation, overpopulation, climate change, conflict with enemies, loss of connection with allies, importation of pest species (like weeds, insects, and predators) and a couple of other causes. Societies fail to deal with these problems because they don't see them coming, because their leaders are too cut off from the people to appreciate the growing problems, because some people benefit from causing the problems, or because they can't - the problems are just too powerful.<br /><br />Diamond's history starts with Easter Island - a society which collapsed around 1500 A.D. after several hundred years of providing a good living to over ten thousand people. The main problem there was deforestation - they cut down all the trees for construction, firewood, and making the famous statues. Diamond says the Polynesians may have thought the trees would grow back faster than they did, because Easter is colder, and has higher latitude and altitude than the islands the inhabitants came from. (After the collapse, they still had 1 - 2000 people scratching out a hard living, until the Europeans came and almost finished them off with disease and enslavement.)<br /><br />So it's a combination of a rough environment and lack of foresight that does civilizations in. The Anasazi of the Southwestern U.S and the Norse colonizers of Greenland died out when their already harsh climates grew either dryer or colder. Other Polynesian islands collapsed after their trading partners collapsed, leaving them unable to import needed materials. Diamond tells all these stories sympathetically, with lots of interesting sidelights, like the way the Europeans couldn't understand how the Easter people had erected their giant statues. Some whites even concluded that spacemen had put the statues up. Meanwhile, Easter's survivors were trying to tell them, \\"Hey, we know how we did it.  My grandfather told me...,\\" but nobody would listen.<br /><br />More interesting than the collapses, to me, are the societies that didn't collapse. Tiny Tikopia Island has supported a population of 1200 for over a thousand years. The sustainable civilizations did it by being very strict about population control, amazingly resourceful about using resources, especially trees, and not wasting anything, ever. Some of the population control methods would seem too harsh for us today: they included infanticide, frequent small wars, a variety of contraception techniques, and voluntary suicide.  Governments had to be quite strict about who could use what, and this could be done by a dictatorship of some kind (as in Japan and the Dominican Republic) or by everyone agreeing on the problems and the need for sustainability (as on Tikopia and New Guinea.)<br /><br />Of course, the trillion dollar question is \\"will modern society be a survivor or a collapse victim?\\" Diamond tries to be positive. He calls himself a \\"cautious optimist\\" and concludes almost every chapter with a section called \\"reasons to hope.\\"  Unfortunately, I can't share his optimism and find little hope in the reasons he gives.<br /><br />Yes, people have solved terrible environmental problems in the past. But nothing in our present social structure gives anyone the authority to compel sustainability, or gives the people access to sustainable ways of living, even if they did come to understand the problem. And of course, almost all media (especially advertising) try to cover the problems up and push us to consume even more.<br /><br />Meanwhile, we face all the problems that did in other societies, all at the same time -- population, exhaustion of fisheries, forests, and farmlands, climate change and all the rest. I hope Diamond is right that we will pull through, because if he's not, global warming and other problems could mean the end of all of us, even non-humans, and in a fairly short time. We have to do the best we can to spread the word and adopt the most sustainable practices.  A good start would be global adoption of China's 1 - child policy.  We'll see what happens.<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Environmentally-sound living is also healthy living for individuals, families, and communities.

0385336691|2.0|This is the worst of Lee Child. I really enjoyed all of his other books except this one and I am quite surprised that others found it enjoyable. There is zero action and suspense until the very end of the story and what little action there finally is is quite tame compared to his other books.
B00005JNRY|2.0|I absolutely loved the premier. It was a movie for all genders and ages. I must admit that 'Mater' the toe truck, voice by Larry the Cable Guy, was the best part of the movie.

0930289234|5.0|Even casual observers such as myself know Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons's Watchmen is generally reputed to be THE graphic novel, or at the very least on the short list of the best and most influential in the whole medium, as well as one of the works that brought respectability to the form.  I'm too young to personally remember the effect Watchmen had on the comic genre, but my brother was in middle school at the time of its release, and when he saw me reading the book recently he said the reaction to it back then was, \\"Like, holy cow.\\"  And it's not hard to see why.  Moore's V for Vendetta was certainly a great book, but this one is so far ahead of its predecessor in terms of complexity, detail, and psychological depth it makes V look like, well, a comic book.  Like V, Watchmen has heavy doses of sociopolitical ponderings mixed in with its more traditional action and interpersonal drama, but in Watchmen Moore creates a whole universe of frequently morally ambiguous characters, telling his story on an infinitely grander and more nuanced scale than before.  This is a true novel, incorporating multiple plot strands and backstories, with as much emphasis on ideas as on the fast-paced narrative and lavishly colored and detailed artwork.<br /><br />Ironically, Moore creates a world where comic-book-styled crimefighters are (or were) very real, and very human, and uses it to explore issues that go well beyond the purview of anything that could've been dreamed up in the early days of superhero myths.  The world of Watchmen is an ugly one, filled with violence, social decay, and general depravity, where decent people strive to make a difference only to question whether anyone can, and where characters who face the darkness and insanity that surround them are defined by their reactions to it.  The book's overarching plot expertly exploits the fear and paranoia of the Cold War era, along with any society's ever-present tensions between order and liberty, as an apparent scheme to knock off former costumed crimefighters (The Watchmen of the book's title) intersects with escalating hostilities between the U.S. and the Soviet Union as the threat of nuclear holocaust hangs eternally overhead.  And at the risk of overdoing the V for Vendetta comparisons, much like that book this one doesn't ask the reader to take sides: there are plenty of competing philosophies and worldviews on display in Watchmen, and while none of them are exactly idealized, all are at least explained.<br /><br />Really, though, it's the embellishments that make Watchmen near-mandatory reading.  I've read some novels that were pretty out-there in my time(Infinite Jest and House of Leaves, to name a couple of the more prominent), and while this one isn't quite as dense and narratively complicated as those two, it's up there.  Interspersed between each chapter is an addendum of some sort, usually an excerpt of text, that sheds light on the characters and the world they inhabit.  Even beyond that, the book is filled with little asides and interruptions that give it an almost stream-of-consciousness feel.  Watchmen doesn't just show a guy sitting at a newsstand reading a chilling comic called The Black Freighter; it overlays passges from the book into the main narrative and throws in a biography of its creator for good measure.  We don't just see a militantly right-wing newspaper editor thundering his philosophy at a hapless underling; we get to read one of his editorials for ourselves.  Watchmen isn't just action or intrigue for its own sake; everything has its context.<br /><br />Much as I hate to say it, the above review has been woefully inadequte, but there's just so much in here that's worth thinking and writing about that it's pretty much impossible to encapsulate it in a few paragraphs.  Similarly, it's hard to digest everything in this book without some careful reading, but in the end it's more than worth it.  Actually, if I had to come up with a complaint about Watchmen, it's that the ending is a bit of a letdown, but after the sustained brilliance that preceded it, that was practically inevitable.  A great book all around.n, it's that the ending is a bit of a letdown, but after the sustained brilliance that preceded it, that was practically inevitable.  A great book all around.
B00005JNBQ|3.0|Hi. My family rented this movie last night to watch. And... hello! What the heck is the point of this? Almost eveyone in my class says this movie is hilarious. This is what my class was talking about? This is the funniest movie ever? No way! There are a ton of movies that are funnier than this. So what, Napoleon lives with his grandparents and  brother and has a llama? So what if his idiotic Mexican friend Pedro wants to be class president? (now i understand why he wears the shirt that says \\"vote for pedro\\") This movie is about a nonsense idiot who has no goals in his life, has horrible friends, and lives with his grandparents. I also rented Yours, Mine, and Ours, and it was much funnier and made more sense. So, if anybody actually enjoys this movie, don't talk to me. I hope this was helpful. <br />*****************************PEACE EVERYWHERE*******************
B00005RHGK|4.0|I found this VHS at a thrift store for a dollar and added it to my collection.  I had never seen it before and I must admit I was surprised that a post-2000 movie could deliver such chills.    The most chilling moments were in the first half of the film.  Our two main characters, a brother and sister driving home from spring break along a desolate stretch of country roads somewhere in central Florida, are chased off the road by a maniac in a horrible old truck.  Seemingly a salute to \\"Duel\\", the director here really outdid Steven Spielberg in casting the ugliest, most horrifying old truck in existence!  If all we ever see in this movie is the truck it would be scary enough!  They later pass an abandoned old church along the roadside where the same old truck is parked and see the driver tossing what looks like wrapped bodies down an old pipe.  The art of the filmmaker is exquisite here.  The driver, clad in a long tattered overcoat and hat, turns and stares at them as they pass.  The scene takes place in broad daylight and yet is one of the most chilling and creepy movie moments I have ever seen.  He gets back in the truck and pursues the teenagers and the story goes on from there.    Only the southern values of the kids could dictate going back to help someone they believe is in trouble, and our characters do just that.  What they discover in the basement of the old church is more frightening than they had first suspected.  The movie loses some momentum from this point on.      The actors give good, competent performances and the location shooting in rural Florida lends a frightening sense of isolation.  Eileen Brennan is good as the crazy old backwoods cat lady.  It is an entertaining movie I don't regret owning.  Victor Salva is a talented campfire storyteller and this movie will probably be his masterpiece.  Handle your sequels with care, Victor!

B00000DCHI|2.0|Why on earth would anyone purchase this anthology when these tracks can be heard anytime for free by riding the elevators of office buildings, nodding off in airport lounges, or waiting in the checkout line at Wal-Mart?  Billy Joel is the gold standard of adult contemporary schmaltz; he pumps out the sludge by which all other sludge is measured.  Small wonder; his gift for writing hooks is amazing, he sings on-key without being interesting to listen to (which would be distracting), his ballads are so insipid that they're certain to offend no one, and his up-tempo numbers bear an eerie resemblance to rock without actually containing any of the bite or irreverence that are the hallmarks of real rock.<br /><br />As for his lyrics, he is not the poet laureate of shopping malls for no reason.  Though he occasionally stumbles over content in his songwriting efforts, as he did in Allentown, he is far more at home in the woozy and comfortable world of words that, devoid of meaning, can roll smoothly from the tongue, scamper along the piano keys, and jump quickly into the cash register where they belong.  Examples abound but, has there ever been a song with less of a rock sensibility than Still Rock And Roll To Me?  It is pointless to deny Billy Joel's gift and his skill, he has demonstrated time and time again that his instincts for rising to the middle are infallible.  Many people have found pleasure in what he's produced over the years.  Awful music and wonderful music could not exist without music that is profoundly mediocre, songs that serenade the middlebrow.  That is Billy Joel land, the middle of the dial.  If he has any value at all, which is questionable, it is that he defines mediocrity and has made a science of it.
0451457994|4.0|Two things up front:  (1)  I've never seen Stanley Kubrick's film.  (2)  I'm not a fan of science fiction.<br /><br />And still . . . I enjoyed this book.  Having heard nothing about this author and only the vaguest hints of the film (I vaguely remember seeing an ad for *2010:  the year we make contact* in the mid-80s.), I wasn't sure what to expect.  I picked up my paperback edition in a library sale and was very pleasantly surprised by the story it contained.<br /><br />In a rather shocking way, the portrayals of space travel and technological advances were remarkably accurate for a book written prior to the moon-landing.  Even more interesting was the characterization of Hal, the AI machine that controls the spaceship Discovery.  He is, perhaps, the most fascinating character in the novel - excluding the unknown alien species, of course - owing not in part to Clarke's rather sympathetic portrayal of his murderous tendencies.<br /><br />One of the greatest strengths of this novel is its readability.  The descriptions are very visual, and the action moves rather quickly.  In a sense, the reader does seem to be \\"viewing\\" the book.  (This is perhaps true because it was written during the filming process.)  There's not much heavy-handed symbolism here, and I felt no urge to uncap my hi-lighter and annotate passages, but it WAS thought-provoking in its own way.  The only real weakness is the lack of transition between the novel's sections.  Just as you become invested in one of the characters, he disappears into a literary abyss.<br /><br />By the end - which I reached quickly - I wanted to see more funding for the space program.  Seems a tragedy to stay encapsulated in our atmosphere without the desire for exploration - what Steinbeck refers to as \\"westering\\".  Still, there is the hope that future generations will revive their curiosity, whether by natural compulsion - or alien influence . . .
B000002V1D|4.0|This album was a total surprise for me. After the disappointment of 'Liberty', I expected much of the same. But no, this album really 'kicks'. Unlike all Duran albums since RIO, which are full of fillers, this album has 11 good tracks and only 2 that are disappointing (Drowning Man & Shotgun). We all know the big hits 'Ordinary World' and 'Come Undone', but this album also contains other gems...The Milton Nascimento collaboration, \\"Breath After Breath'' is fantastic and as good as anything that the Duran's have ever done....A real good album that stands the test of time and you can pick it up at a bargain price !!
B00011F5DK|5.0|This game is easy to learn in a few minutes.  My 4 1/2 year old son learned the rules quickly and could play with me the first try.  Becoming an expert is much harder though!  The game is different each time we play, and always challenging and fun.  Best of all Blokus isn't like any game I've played before.  You have to plan ahead like chess, but the game changes so fast you're always changing your strategy on the fly.  Blokus can be played very quickly with a young child, or at a more thoughtful pace with an adult or older child.  All in all Blokus is great, and ADDICTING the way a good game should be.
0767805712|5.0|This is a great fiction movie based on some realities of life; nothing more to add to all the other great reviews here. Uma Thurman is at her best. These roles suit her so well. She is extremely elegant same like everyone else in this movie. The dialogue is great same as the photography and the music.<br /><br />The DVD quality is also very good. Highly recommended.
B00008BXJF|4.0|The thirteenth King Crimson album, and third with these players, isn't exactly new material, but it's good stuff, and much darker than usual.  Here's a run down of the tracks, which hopefully makes some connections many people may have missed to past KC tracks:    The Power to Believe (Part 1): This introduces the theme of the album: a single vocal line with a similar effect over it to what we heard on some of the 'Happy With..' EP, such as Mie Gakure.    Level 5: Larks Tongues in Aspic V.  It has an awesome main theme which makes it better than part IV and is one of the best songs here.    Eyes Wide Open: This song is absolutely gorgeous.  The guitar interactions are amazing.  It's the first of three vocal songs on here.  I prefer this version to the acoustic version from the 'Happy..' EP, as it has more power.  This is probably my favorite song on the album.    Elektrik: Fracture part 3.  This is more distant from the original than FraKctured was, hence the different title.  It's a cool version which works very well with the two tracks that come before it.    Facts of Life: Musically, this fits in, but the lyrics are far too simple for music this complex.  The aggresive vocals are lame, and give this song an aritificial and amateur feel - something that shouldn't be on a band's thirteenth album.  This is probably the worst song on the disc.    The Power to Believe (Part 2):  This is Virtuous Circle with Shoganai and The Power To Believe vocal sample layered over it.  It's an awesome ambient piece.    Dangerous Curves: A simple buildup song which creates a lot of tension.  It's cool, and it works with the album,  but it's forgettable.    Happy With What You Have To Be Happy With: An amusing parody of nu-metal and a/b/a/b/c/a songwriting.  Luckily, they shortened it from the EP version for this album, as it barely fits in with the other songs here.  Better than Facts of Life, but worse than everything else here.    The Power to Believe (Part 3): This is 'The Deception of the Thrush' with the T.S. Eliot sample replaced by The Power to Believe vocal sample.  Interesting song.    PTB Part 4 is an ambient outro that gives the album a finished feel.  As a whole this album barely holds together, as it's been assembled from various materials which have been floating around for quite a while, but it works in the end.  The beginning flows perfectly, but by the end you almost feel like you're listening to a compilation.  However, this album is definitely an improvement over The ConstruKction of Light.  The  playing is great as usual, and the album is mostly instrumental.  The rhythmic devices are awesome, although they don't approach the complexity and intensity of those on Thrak.  I'd recommend this album to anyone, and I think it makes a good introduction to the modern incarnation of the band, although it's a little bit more difficult to make sense of without having heard where all of this material came from.  It's King Crimson with a much more modern, dark, and heavy sound.
B000002UAU|5.0|How Could you Not love this album, it has such a wide variety of music and there is something on it for everyone. <br /> <br />Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band 9/10 - Not much to this song, only the beatles could make a song so powerful that clocks in at under 2 minutes. <br /> <br />With A Little Help From My Friends 9/10 - Classic Beatles sound. Not one of my favorites from the album but still a great tune. <br /> <br />Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds 10/10 - Classic song, one of the best on the album. Such great variety, listen close to the lyrics and you can really picture this song in your head. <br /> <br />Getting Better 10/10 - Nice beatles sound without too much pop. One of the catchiest tunes you'll ever listen to. <br /> <br />Fixing A Hole 8/10 - A little slow paced, not very exciting but none the less a fantastic song. <br /> <br />She's Leaving Home 9/10 - Really neat song, not much to it, so basic, yeah so good. <br /> <br />Being For The Benefit of Mr. Kite 10/10 - One of if not the best off of the album, shows real beatles maturity and its a song that you could listen to over and over again. <br /> <br />Within You Without You 9/10 - A little long and drawn out but do what I did, smoke a lil hydro and turn this tune on. You will go on the wildest trip of your life. <br /> <br />When I'm Sixty-Four 8/10 - Typical paul, a little poppy for my taste but you still can't deny that its classic beatles. <br /> <br />Lovely Rita 9/10 - Awesome tune, catchy chorus, nice rhymthmic balance here. <br /> <br />Good Morning, Good Morning 6/10 - Not too sold on this one, it's annoying, repetitive and messy but its still the beatles so it's worth a listen. <br /> <br />SPLHCB (Reprise) 8/10 - Not much too it, nothing great just a quick closer <br /> <br />A Day In the Life 10/10 - Not the most uplifting song but an awesome song none the less. You are basically taken through a day of someones life. Classic <br /> <br />
0446310786|4.0|<br /> My second book I read for trimester three was To Kill A Mockingbird written by Harper Lee. The main conflict in the book was about Atticus trying to win a rape trial including a black guy.  <br /> The book was very exciting to read. I thought it was exciting because the trial kept going back and fourth and I never knew who was going to win. I was not able to feel in the book because the time period was way off and I couldn't make many connections to the book. The main conflict was very interesting because I never knew who was going to win the trial and it always kept me guessing. I thought that characters in the book were very realistic because the author explained them perfect and made them face real life situations. I thought that the ending was a bit disappointing, but it was what I was expecting. I wasn't so happy with the ending because the person that won in the trial wasn't the one I wanted to win.  <br /> The author wrote with a narrative southern voice. The author's voice was southern like the characters. The author uses vocabulary in a very interesting way. He uses difficult words through out the book but they aren't to difficult that you can't understanding them. I think the author wrote in a very unique way. It was really unique when the author talked in a southern voice like the characters did. The author also explained everything so perfect which made the book one hundred times better. The author used a lot of dialogue in this book. The author had to use a lot of dialogue because of the trial and there were a ton of people talking at different times. I thought that this author wrote this book perfect. He explained everything perfectly for me and I always knew what was happening. <br /> I would give this book an eight out of ten. I give it this rating because I am not very satisfied with the ending but it was overall a great book. I recommend this book to kids thirteen and older because they will understand it a whole lot better. I also recommend this book to people who want a very good book that is challenging.  <br /> Overall I thought that this was a great book. I really thought the author did a good job writing this book and I am looking forward to other books written by him. I think the greatest thing about this book is how the author always keeps you guessing through the trial and never gave away who was going to win during the book. Something I didn't mention in previous sections was that Atticus' kids were afraid of the neighbor's house because he never came out and they never saw him and they thought he was like a mass murderer or something. The neighbor was overall a great guy and the kids noticed that during the book. If you want to know more about the book then go out and read it yourself because if I told you more I would give the book away.    <br />
B000EULJLU|5.0|Hey, this is less of a review and more of a plea for rationality. Be patient with this album - I think its flawless. You have to look at sections of the album in a similar fashion to \\"Parabol\\" and \\"Parabola\\" from Lateralus. Quite cleary \\"lost keys\\" and \\"Rosetta stoned\\" are linked aswell as \\"Wings for Marie\\" and \\"10,000 days\\"(Which by the way is beautiful and should not be dismissed). There are links between \\"Jambi\\" and \\"Vicarious\\" too(due to the subject matter it acts like a continuation from a different point of view).From what i can tell \\"Intention\\" and \\"Right in two\\" are both views on humanity and are probably deliberately ordered- much like the rest of the album!. If anyone else uses the word \\"filler\\" and the word \\"Tool\\" in the same sentence- i'm practically sure they will never understand this band. This is a mature album and I love it. Pipe down - you have got your moneys worth and far more.K x
B00005JMCW|4.0|The nominal plot of this movie is formulaic. Mother (Jamie Lee Curtis) and teenage daughter (Lindsay Lohan) are at each others' throats, all day every day. Through magical means, each spends a day living the other's life. They reach a new understanding of each other in a tearful rapprochement, and everyone ends up back where they belong. The end. (The fact that Curtis's character was a therapist and had so little respect or understanding to start with makes me think of shoemakers' children going barefoot, but we'll let that slide.)<br /><br />If you have a couple of hours to kill, that much offers a merciful way to euthanize them. What lifts this movie above banality is the physical comedy that both lead actresses bring to the show. Lohan has a few good moments, including some motherly primping of her daughter, Curtis. Her best is the \\"That's not mine!\\" sequence when the mother wakes up inside her of her daughter and takes inventory of the unfamiliar body parts. It really isn't a memorable performance, though. That's OK, because Curtis more than makes up for it. She manages all the teenish petulance and gawkiness you could want, channeling not only her own inner child but a few other people's as well. It's a role you simply have to see. Writing about it would be like explaining a joke. It might get the point across, but only at the cost of everything that makes it worthwhile.<br /><br />It's family-safe and amusing. Against all odds, it rises to one's expectations - as long as you set them low enough.<br /><br />//wiredweird
B00005JOVH|4.0|I was a little nervous going in to this movie because it was from a different director and there were some negative reviews. Maybe it was because my expectations were lowered, but I found this last X-men installment to be a highly enjoyable film. As one who never read the comics and was simply looking to be entertained with some fast-paced action and cool mutant powers, I got what I wanted along with a healthy dose of the darkness that made the previous two X-men so compelling. <br /> <br />As others have mentioned, the one thing lacking in this movie was the character development. Halle Berry as Storm seems to get much more screen time than usual to do basically nothing. I really wanted to see some more of Rogue, and Angel could have been a much more interesting character with more attention. But I guess they figured we knew most of the characters pretty well from the previous films, and were focusing more on wrapping up the story. This they managed in a satisfactory way, with just a hint of an open ending in case this is not the last movie after all. <br /> <br />In short, a fitting end to one of the best comic-based franchises going.
B00004WGY9|4.0|A lot of people mentioned that they can't find the songs of the singles in the CD. The interface in the CD is not very clear. The best way is to use Explorer on the CD. The song files are in Quicktime MOV format in the folder D:\DATA\QTS. I opened the files on Itunes and converted them to audio format. These files CAN'T be played from the original CD on a CD player.
B00005JOVH|3.0|<br />I think the biggest problem with this installment, as many have pointed out, is that it was just a showcase for how awesome mutant powers look when put onscreen. Virtually all of the characters that were developed in-depth and made the first two movies great were either killed off or missing-in-action for most of the movie.  <br /> <br />Logan, Ororo, Jean, and Magneto were some of the only ones who got enough attention. It was speculated Scott got so little screen time because James Marsden had other projects to work on. He was probably on the promotional poster just to get people to see the movie, even though he didn't even have time to get in his costume in the film. And I have no idea why Rogue was hardly present, other than the fact that maybe it was decided that her powers wouldn't add any POW to the movie. I have also read that Nightcrawler was written out completely because there would be too many \\"blue\\" characters, but I really hope there was a more valid one. Kitty and Colossus are actually two of my absolute favorites, but their treatment in the film was the same as generally every other mutant we saw, which was, essentially \\"look at the cool powers!\\". And, of course, Angel and Beast finally made it so the original X-men had appeared in the movie, but they also had roles that were sadly lacking.  <br /> <br />As a fan of the comics, I tried my ass off not to be disappointed as the deaths of several main characters, because in the X-men Universe, people dying and being ressurected multiple times is not uncommon. So I assume they did this to simplify the movie, and killing beloved characters is a very good way to amp up the feeling in a film. And if this was supposed to be the final installment, killing the characters is certainly a way to make sure that no one comes along and makes another one. I can't decide if the open ending was to hint that there might be another movie in the future, or just to piss me off.  <br /> <br />The high points were there, too, though, namely the special effects were, obviously, awesome. And the story itself wasn't bad...the biggest problem was the character treatment. If Brett Ratner wanted to make sure everyone knew this was his film and his characters, not Bryan Singer's, he did a hell of a job.   <br />
B00005JOFQ|5.0|Wow.  This movie was absolutely wonderful.  The acting was superb, the cinematography was breath taking and the story was one of a great love and also of a great loss.  I watched this with my husband and he enjoyed the movie as well, but I was in tears by the end of the film.  What outstanding performances by the two leading men and the supporting cast.  This one should have been an Acadamey Award winner for best picture.

B00005NC66|5.0|Why is the first movie by Godard different from so much independent cinema nowadays?  After all, Godard always is trying to impress us with cinematic tricks and arbitrary changes of mood and pace.  But there is an important difference.  When you listen to his characters talk, they are speaking reality.  When he films Paris even before the fifties were over, you get the exact feeling of the town without sweeping shots of the skyline.  And when he does some expected thing, he does tongue-in-cheek, playing with the conventions, subverting them and making you laugh about them.  So you have innovative cinema, instant icons, cult scenes, and a lot of talk about love, sex, high-culture, jazz music, post-modernism before it was even imagined, and one of the more beautiful imagined cities in the world.  And after this Godard would become even more radical, changing the way we can understand cinema, challenging the status of the art that he wants to elevate (but he knows how?).  I cannot emphasize how revolutionary all the thing feels.  And it is forty-seven years old?!  Like other Godards, it makes you think that we, as Westerners, haven't got too far from what he saw so many years ago.
B0006GAOJA|2.0|After making the classic and thoroughly joyous rock-jam film The Last Waltz with marvelous `guest' performances from Joni Mitchell, Van Morrison, Muddy Waters, Eric Clapton, Neil Young backing up The Band & good friend Robbie Robertson, Martin Scorsese took a two-year break from moviemaking, during which he was wed and divorced to actress Isabella Rossellini.  Their falling out left him in a state of deep depression, from which 1980's Raging Bull emerged.  Like Travis Bickle's gruesome homicidal explosion at the end of Scorsese's modern-urban-Dostoyevskian masterpiece Taxi Driver (1976), making Raging Bull was Scorsese's personal catharsis, which he apparently used to empty every negative and self-destructive aspect of himself onto celluloid.      Shot in stark, merciless black-and-white to reproduce the urban grittiness of Little Italy circa 1940, Scorsese's film pays tribute to champion boxer Jake La Motta's primitiveness.  Much like British director Mike Leigh's movie Naked (1993), Scorsese presents a reprehensible, brutal main character sympathetically, as if his paranoid, cruel and violent behavior is utterly beyond his control - as if it's the corrupt society in which the character lives which deserves the blame for this abhorrent behavior, but certainly not the character (or the simple-minded storytellers).  It's the old `absolute product of the environment' dramatic scheme which argues against the existence of characters' having any access whatsoever to personal choice; Jake La Motta is Scorsese's embodiment of the human being as total animal, nothing more, who behaves solely as `nature' dictates.    Stylistically, Scorsese's self-described \\"kamikaze\\" style of filmmaking, of throwing himself at the material, here bears both the exhilarating highs and wretched lows of free-writing.  The boxing sequences are the greatest ever put on film: Scorsese's camera pinwheels, pirouettes, dollies in and counter-dollies, and he has Oscar-winning editor Thelma Schoonmakerprovide ample freeze frames, slowdowns and speed-ups of the footage; all to create a searingly Expressionist depiction of La Motta's destroy-or-be-destroyed P.O.V. in the ring.  (Frank Warner's sound design in particular helps to lend the sequences an added bit of surrealism: for example, when La Motta bears down on Sugar Ray Robinson, the shrieks of a condor closing in on its prey can be heard in the background.)      Yet in the dramatic sections, the film is bland, stale, stagnant.  Scenes drag on endlessly, like dialogues in a later Kubrick film; only Scorsese uses improvisation, and gets repetition and anticlimax.  (That anticlimax is all too literal when De Niro pours a pitcher of ice water (!) down his boxer shorts right after fooling around with girlfriend Vicki (the stellar Cathy Moriarty) - La Motta's got a fight coming up, and he wants the additional tension of sexual frustration to use as fuel in the ring.)  Self-pity suffuses Raging Bull, and is actually its unstated (and very likely unconscious) central theme.  Scorsese's and star Robert De Niro's concept of Jake's character is a strictly one-note affair: Robert De Niro's monotonous, quasi-autistic performance as La Motta says over and over again, \\"I'm dumb, I don't know any better, therefore I deserve your sorrow.\\"  This `new' form of non-acting was awarded with the Best Actor Oscar of 1980 (an honor that De Niro deserved infinitely more for his extraordinary performance as the haunted Travis Bickle five years earlier, which still stands next to Brando in Last Tango in Paris, Orson Welles in Citizen Kane, Daniel Day-Lewis in My Left Foot, etc., as perhaps one of the twenty greatest performances in movie history).    While Joe Pesci as Jake's brother Joey is individually funny, charismatic and winning, his scenes with De Niro go nowhere; he says something, then De Niro asks him to repeat what he just said.  Also, the movie's ending is beyond ponderous: after Vicky, then his wife, finally comes to her senses and ditches him (looooong after we've started rooting for her to do so), La Motta winds up in a lousy nightclub, telling lousy jokes.  (It wasn't enough for us to see his lousy behavior, so we've got to be witness to his lousy sense of humor too?)  Whether or not these scenes are genuinely biographical is irrelevant; they aren't dramatic, because there's no conflict, no sense of going anywhere...which very unfortunately might be Scorsese's ultimate, self-indulgently depressive point.  We have here a movie where mundanity itself is the subject, a movie which prefers to childishly implore for the audience's sympathies in regards to its self-defeatism, rather than intelligently deal with its issues.  Jake doesn't want inner health, he hasn't the vaguest notion of what that means - he wants power and control, and when he doesn't have it he cries like a baby and pounds his head against a wall.  Scorsese's lingering on him screaming \\"I'm not an animal!\\" again and again isn't visually psychologically fascinating, it's the definition of cinematically banal (and maybe the most overwrought temper tantrum in movie history).   It's the visual equivalent of Scorsese the movie-director-who-also-wanted-to-be-a-priest grisly administering himself lashings as penance, with us the audience as his spectators.  (If you happen to be a secular movie viewer, as I am, the sight of all this gratuitous, almost medieval self-flagellation and punishment can be an especially head-scratching and unpleasant experience.)      Raging Bull has been acclaimed one of the twenty greatest movies in history by most of the major critics' and directors' polls (Sight and Sound, etc.), and it's proven to have been deeply influential to future generations of moviemakers.  Whether or not that influence has produced movies of quality is open to debate; personally, I think Raging Bull's unique and very unfortunate aesthetic combination of chaotic-urban-emptiness-as-divine-holiness has inspired as many terrible and amateurish takes on this theme (think the majority of Abel Ferrara's movie career) as Tarantino's profoundly more entertaining Pulp Fiction later did for the ironically-wisecracking-hitman genre.  Some moviegoers may indeed pray at screenings of Raging Bull, but I think they're bowing their heads to a false idol.  To me, Raging Bull is nowhere near as thematically imaginative or psychologically complex - or directorially and cinematically ingenious - as Scorsese's Mean Streets, Taxi Driver, The Last Temptation of Christ, GoodFellas, The Aviator, or his brilliant short `Life Lessons' from the New York Stories movie anthology.  It's these works, plus his masterful documentaries The Last Waltz, My Personal Journey Through American Movies, My Voyage To Italy and the recent No Direction Home: Bob Dylan, that stand as the very finest examples of Scorsese's most vital, creative, passionate and rewarding work in the movies.

0684135051|5.0|I bought this 2 years ago knowing nothing about Elizabeth Zimmermann.  It wasn't an immediate hit, though I enjoyed it.  Not being a sweater-wearer, I wasn't sure how much she had to offer me.  Her conversational style of directions makes the entire book readable, even when it's actually the pattern!  I now own all of her books, most of her videos, and frequent the website of her company Schoolhouse Press.  This time I'm buying a copy for my local library, whose collection of knitting books is pathetic.  I encourage knitters everywhere to buy the books they love and donate them to their library.  Maybe we will be responsible for the next knitting fanatic!  There are some good non-sweater patterns in the book - my absolute favorite is the tam o'shanter hat, though the spiral hat looks like it may be fun.

However, I havent stopped listening to it since i bought it. You really have to appreciate the smaller, finer, musical points of the album to really grasp the amazingness of it. <br />On the song 10,000 days, the musical suspension builds up for about 5 minutes and then releases pure ecstasy for the ears. On Rosetta stoned, the drum rythym and beat are absolutely astounding and like they do best, tool puts you in a music trance until maynard screams  you out of it. There slowest and softest album musically, 10,000 days is a must for any tool fan.

B000FDEUFS|5.0|Not being a dyed-in-the-wool Allmans fan, I can only recommend a few of their albums, and quite obviously the ones I would *most* recommend would be those featuring the original lineup of Duane, Gregg, Dickey Betts, Berry Oakley, Butch Trucks and Jaimoe.  If you choose to only buy a few Allman Brothers Band albums, start with their eponymous 1969 debut and work your way up to Eat a Peach.  (Some will suggest going with the next one as well, Brothers and Sisters, but I'll admit I'm not thrilled as much by that one, with Duane and Berry gone.  Don't get me wrong--Dickey Betts is a fine guitarist and has some good country-styled lead vocals, and \\"Ramblin' Man\\" is a true rock 'n' roll classic [if a bit overplayed on classic rock radio], but it just doesn't feel the same to me.)<br /><br />That said, Eat a Peach is one of the best places to dive in headfirst with the ABB's music.  For my part, I've had a CD copy for the last 17 years or so, current copy being the 2004 hybrid SACD remaster.  I'll hang onto that, of course--there's not a bad track on this album, and remixed into 5.1 Surround, it sounds absolutely wonderful...like travelling back in time to 1971-72 and being present at the recordings and performances of a band who were dealing with a crippling blow (Duane's tragic death) and were shortly to be dealt a second, when Berry Oakley would be killed in another motorcycle accident less than a block from where Duane died in Macon, GA.  Through all of this, they managed to create music with an immediacy and a sharpness few other jam bands have ever really managed.  \\"Ain't Wastin' Time No More\\" could easily be Gregg's statement of purpose--going to carry on no matter what happens.  The live tracks are absolutely fine--this performance of \\"Mountain Jam\\" is, as far as I'm concerned, the definitive one--and the pre-accident tracks...well, Duane and Dickey duetting acoustically on \\"Little Martha\\" makes for one of the most memorable closing tracks on any classic rock album ever recorded.<br /><br />I am so glad to see that the complete Fillmore performance from June 27, 1971 has now been included.  These were the shows that put the ABB on the map as a prime concert destination, not to mention the last days of a true rock 'n' roll institution, which I was not, regrettably, old enough to have experienced (I was just 3 years old when Bill Graham closed the two Fillmores).  I will certainly buy this Deluxe Edition, if only for the added live disc.um ever recorded. <br /> <br />I am so glad to see that the complete Fillmore performance from June 27, 1971 has now been included.

B000AQ691I|4.0|This movie endures as a favorite in corporate (and government) circles because, unlike Dilbert, it's still funny after all these years.  The characters are fresh and engaging (except for the one name, Aniston somebody), the storyline is edgy (if logically flawed in parts), and it made me laugh several times.  A great rental.  Not to buy.  No.<br /><br />It's also pretty vulgar, though I admit I don't get out much, being the father of two small children (my most important job, bucko).  Do what I did--see it at home while on sick leave.
B000FQJAIW|1.0|Fans and potential buyers beware, you are going to get non-anamorphic versions from laserdisc transfers, meaning the quality of these versions (of the original films) will be very poor according to today's standards. Lucasfilm says it doesn't have any better masters or prints for these releases, yet how many directors do you know who would not keep prestine quality prints of their first three movies that were huge successes?  Come on, consumers aren't dumb.  Don't fall for the money game with this one.

B0000025FG|3.0|In the fall of 1979, I had just turned 11 years old, and had not only just been given one record for my birthday, but also had received money which I then used to buy the first vinyl LP I ever bought.  (I had only seriously begun to pay attention to the top 40 that spring, and had only bought 45s up to that point; I owned a grand total of 3 LPs, all of which had been given to me as presents, and maybe a couple of cassettes.)  It was the very beginning of my long history (27 years now) as a collector.<br /><br />That first LP was ELO's Discovery.  All that spring and summer, I had been hearing the various singles from that album (\\"Shine a Little Love,\\" \\"Confusion,\\" \\"Don't Bring Me Down\\" and \\"Last Train to London\\") on my favourite radio station of the time (WIGY 105.9 FM, in the Bath/Brunswick area in Maine), and so when the opportunity came to purchase this record, I jumped on it.  Needless to say, I knew nothing at the time of Jeff Lynne's Beatles influence, although I was a huge Beatles fan--still am to this day; they will always be the Gods of Rock 'n' Roll in my heart--and it probably would have raised his stock considerably for me.  In the months to come, I would buy copies of ELO's Greatest Hits and Out of the Blue (mine being a cutout copy on United Artists that cost me just $4.99; this was a bargain for a double LP in early 1980).  In the meantime, I played Discovery as often as I could, and I loved it all.<br /><br />Fast forward to 2001.  Sony made their first attempts at catalogue remasters of ELO's albums; along with the classic Eldorado, their three albums from 1979-83 (Discovery, Time, and Secret Messages) were also remastered and reissued.  Wishing to rediscover a favourite of my 'tweenie years, I bought the remastered Discovery on CD.  22 years on, I realised that Thomas Wolfe was right--you can't go home again...and even if you could, nothing would be the same.  Your tastes change, and mine certainly had.  Here's my adult synopsis of Discovery:<br /><br />Only 3 of this album's 9 tracks are truly essential--\\"Shine a Little Love,\\" \\"Last Train to London\\" (which is *not* instrumental, by the way--there are vocals and lyrics) and \\"Don't Bring Me Down\\" all keep things moving along nicely, even if \\"Shine a Little Love's\\" bridge rings a bit twee these days.  Three more tracks--\\"Confusion,\\" \\"The Diary of Horace Wimp\\" and \\"On the Run\\"--are entertaining and move alone nicely, but I wouldn't rate them among this album's best tracks, just a little less painful than the other 3--\\"Need Her Love,\\" \\"Midnight Blue\\" and \\"Wishing.\\"  Of the final 3, \\"Need Her Love\\" is embarrassing in its twinkly saccharine-ness, which include unbearable naive-sounding lyrics and sweet synth arrangements (sweet enough to raise your blood sugar to dangerous levels!), thus making it the worst offender of the lot.  The other two are saccharine throwaways, just bad enough to be memorable.  What was forgivable at 11 isn't so at 37, when your perceptions have sharpened and your inner self hardened a bit against the depredations of the world.<br /><br />On the whole, this was truly the beginning of the end for ELO.  They had pared themselves down to just a quartet--Jeff Lynne, Bev Bevan, Richard Tandy and Kelly Groucutt--having dropped the string players after Out of the Blue (on which you can, of course, see trouble just over the horizon).  It makes some sense that Bev would sub on the drums for Black Sabbath on a couple of tours a few years later; perhaps even he needed some meat after this bit of cotton candy.br /> <br />Only 3 of this album's 9 tracks are truly essential--\\"Shine a Little Love,\\" \\"Last Train to London\\" (which is *not* instrumental, by the way--there are vocals and lyrics) and \\"Don't Bring Me Down\\" all keep things moving along nicely, even if \\"Shine a Little Love's\\" bridge rings a bit twee these days.

B0002IVN9W|4.0|Great CD, it still has that big-screen feel of their debut.  Nothing is small on this album.  They have a their own sound that makes me think of orchestras.  Would definitely recommend buying it.  Am giving 4 stars not 5 because it's not as amazing as their EP.  After 'no cars go', nothing on this album quite hits me the same way.
0553208845|4.0|It is a little hard to trudge through the wordiness of the novel at times but if you take some time, there is a good message to be heard. I think it touches people individually, I appreciated its life lessons while my husband was more profoundly moved.  Hermann Hess' Siddhartha is definately worth the time to read.
B00005JOQ9|2.0|I have an idea of what witer/director Eli Roth was probably going for here; nevertheless, this film is a huge disappointment. It seems that the story of three heterosexual, misogynistic, and extremely brash young men (2 of which are American) who venture to Europe looking for beer, clubs, and lots of sex is trite at best.     As explained by previous reviews- -these three men travel throughout Europe, constantly getting drunk and trying to holla at foreign women while pissing everyone else off with their arrogant, churlish behavior. That is, until the three main characters are told about Slovakia, a land where the men are few, the children travel in weird little hoards of weapon-carrying, psychotic beggars, and the women supposedly go crazy for Americans. Once they arrive in Slovakia, our would-be heroes are seduced by several attractive, libidinous women...only to be set-up, kidnapped, and inexplicably tortured by an unknown organization.      Well, as mentioned earlier, I think Eli Roth was trying to portray the whole what-comes-around-goes-around/careful what you wish for theme. In other words, the main characters only see those around them (especially the women) as mere objects to be used and thrown away. But the tables are quickly turned when the three protaganists are captured and tortured by wealthy sadists as a twisted, cruel form of amusement.     However, the problem is- -the characters aren't developed well enough to really pull this off. While the three men are mostly jerks, their dispositions aren't deplorable enough for the viewer to enjoy their demise, nor are any of them kind/relatable enough to offer them pity. Thus, the viewer is left with a sense of ambivalence towards the film's conclusion- -one can't feel all that passionate about the prospect of the main characters being killed, or of them even escaping and/or exacting vengeance on their tormentors.      Overall, the plot is a little inane- -sort of like a wannabe \\"Girls Gone Wild\\" meets \\"Houseof a Thousand Corpses\\" storyline. I mean...why is it so hard for contemporary horror-makers to realize that special effects combined with a bunch of superfluous, gory scenes doesn't necessarily make for a good horror film? In fact, the only time I was ever truly interested was when one of the characters was being tortured. As a horror fan, the scariness/gore content is intensely enjoyable at these moments. However, shock value alone never makes a movie. In the end, I suggest renting this film or even waiting till it comes on HBO- -under no circumstances should anyone buy this movie.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|In an oppressive world that we live in today, there is almost a majority movement that claims for basic human rights that, for some reason, society will not grant them. One of these rights is the issues with Homosexuality in society. <br /> <br />Coincidentally, Brokeback Mountain came just at the time when people's cries homosexual rights are at their peak, and though the movie does not have fast moving action of Mission Impossible III, or articulate actress of romance films, the drama of this movie speak louder than anything the world has ever witnessed <br /> <br />Countless people have said that their lives have changed because of this movie, and countless people will continue to change for generations to come. This movie is art at its finest, and in the 2D 21st Century we live it, this piece of art probably defines humanity at its best.
B000002I53|5.0|The title track, \\"My Favorite Things\\" is a lovely musical journey into the mind of a master. With Coltrane re-working the theme from The Sound of Music and McCoy Tyner lending audible gold on the keys, the song is a gem.
0553577123|4.0|I read A Diary of A Young Girl In My Independent Lit. Survey Class for a class project. The book moved me very good. It made me think about what life was like in the Holocaust and how life was for Annie Frank. I have also seen many plays about her and The diary thought it helped me understand what it was like through Annie Franks view. It also helped me learn more about how her life was lived and how she died at an young age. The diary starts out with her telling of her life before going into hiding and it continues on after going into hiding. The book had a lot of details and kept to one topic at a time. I rate the book 4 stars because the book had a lot of details but it also didn't keep my attention through out the book. Annie Franks life compared to the book was very hard and she lost her life because of a guy named Hitler started a war against all the Jews. Annie sister also ended up dying in a concentration camp where also Annie was held. Annie father was trying to find her to give her diary back because on of the family members that was up in the attic with the Frank's found the diary after they were found. The book was a really good book and I recommend the book to young adults, teenagers, or parents who have young kids who understand the Holocaust. The book is also a good research item if a student or someone else is trying to find research on someone that lived during the Holocaust. The Holocaust was a horrible time for the Jews including the Franks. Before Annie and her family had to go into hiding they had all the things that they needed. A nice home, friends, and Annie and her sister where able to go to school freely intill the went into hiding.
038542471X|2.0|Of the 7 or so Grisham novels Ive read this one is my least favorite. <br /> <br />It's not a bad story at all but it's just way too long, about 150 pages longer than it needed to be.  <br /> <br />It also just lacked credibility in many spots. Grisham is normally quite good at presenting characters and situations that are at least plausible, if not really interesting. Most of his books give the layman some insight into the workings of the law that Ive always thought were fascinating. This book, however, plods along and doesnt bring anything new to his body of work. <br /> <br />The other thing that really got me was the dialogue he wrote for Mark Sway, the 11year old protagonist. He sounds more like a street-wise 30year old, using words like \\"wonderful\\" and phrases that have been out of use since the 70's. I think Grisham forgot he was writing the words for a young boy and not one of his more typically older characters. <br /> <br />This isnt a bad book if you just want to escape for a few hours a day but most of his other ones are far more enjoyable.
B000EULJLU|1.0|Okay, maybe it can't be that bad.  The first 2 tracks off this record are good ones, nice heavy and melodic just like the Tool you would know.  But for the most part, this whole Album and the last one can be thrown away in the same place.  They need to get some fresh stuff.  Everything just sounds too much alike these days with tool.  Maynard sounds great as always, and the drummer rocks.  But the guitarist and the bass player need to go.  It's all the same.  I'm sick of hearing the same guitar licks.  Change it up a bit.  When Maynard played with A perfect Circle it was a refreshing change, and it still rocked.  If Tool is just aging and thier stlye is changing thats fine, I'll just like their older stuff.  But don't label them as a heavy metal band anymore because there is nothing heavy or metal about them anymore.  Most of this Album was the guitarist playing soft clean guitar.  NOT heavy by any means.  And he plays on his delay pedal like he just dicovered it or something.  common man, change it up.  Take some advice from Eddie Van Halen, or even in your case Bon jovi can be more creative.  He uses the same effect for the entire album, just like Neil Young putting a stranglehold on one note for 70 minutes. If the Tool guitarist and bass player can not play anything different, it's time to move on.  The singer and Drummer can't carry them through anymore worth while records. I'm so pissed that I have to even say anything bad about anything Tool would put out. They use to Rock.  What has the world come too??
B000E33W1W|5.0|This movie is pretty good!I really liked it a lot. Rated PG for language and scary ghost violence.

0440237688|5.0|The following was written by YM, age 11 (Grade Six), as part of a homeschool novel study assignment:<br /><br />I think that  The Giver is an amazing book. I like the way it<br />helps us understand how the characters feel at all times. For example, when Jonas is trying to transfer the memory of red to Asher, we can understand how hopeless he feels, and sympathize with him. This is an excellent book by an excellent author, and I hope we will be seeing more from her soon, maybe even a sequel to The Giver. I sure hope so!<br />  --Y.M.P

B0002RGNRU|5.0|There are almost 600 reviews to date of this movie so the plot has been reviewed to death.  I was pleasantly shocked to see this movie get such rave reviews from so many people and that was a major factor in deciding to watch this film and I am not disappointed in the least.<br /><br />The casual observer would never think that Jim Carrey (known for his comedic skills) would be able to pull off a dramatic role but he did it (and then some) with \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.\\"  I like the way he whispered throughout the film when a memory with Clementine came up.  It added depth to what was about to happen (\\"This was the last time I saw you\\").<br /><br />I've always had great respect for Kate Winslet (I feel she was slighted for never receiving an Oscar for her role in \\"Titanic\\" and she was superb in \\"Quills\\") but watching this just made me respect her a little bit more.  She played flaky but introspective Clementine convincingly, drawing you into her character.<br /><br />The supporting cast was just as good.  I didn't think I'd be impressed with Kirsten Dunst but boy was I wrong.  I thought she was going to play an empty role and leave after a few scenes (scene candy) but what a twist the ending turned out to be (watch it to find out).  Mark Ruffalo was cute in his role as the assistant to the scientist behind the memory cleansing technique and who could have guessed the turn Patrick (Elijah Wood) would take?<br /><br />This is quite the proverbial cut above the rest.  I feel the way the film was edited added to the depth of the storyline.  The film's format was far from conventional (having the opening credits roll 18 minutes into the movie underscored that) - there was no spelling out of the plot nor was it too obvious, the twists at the end, for me, were a pleasant surprise (not a shocker that left you wondering \\"Where did *that* come from?\\") and the way the scenery would collapse as Joel's memories were erased was outstanding as well as the way he would convey his current feelings in the context of past events (\\"By morning you'll be gone.  The perfect ending to this piece of s*** story!\\").<br /><br />There is only one word to describe \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\": BRILLIANT!  Do yourself the favor and watch this movie without any interruptions.  - Donna Di Giacomoin the context of past events (\\"By morning you'll be gone.  The perfect ending to this piece of s*** story!\\").      There is only one word to describe \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\": BRILLIANT!

B0000683WG|5.0|I NEVER SET OUT TO BE A MARC BOLAN FAN, AND HE SLIPPED INTO MY SUBCONSCIOUS COMPLETELY AGAINST MY WILL....well perhaps that's a stretch, nonetheless, THE SLIDER is truly a defining moment in rock history, and nothing will ever take that away from Marc, may he rest in peace.This is the Be-Bop Elf at his peak, and this album is a total, absolute climax to the Nth degree!!!If you are familiar with his earlier material, this is a definite crescendo, and he is reveling in his fame, and believing that he is the greatest ever. The amazing thing is his confidence is rewarded by an album of complete stream of consciousness, nonsensical, whimsical, sexual frenzy-filled songs of utter delight(filled with other-worldly pop hooks to die for)! The actual lyrical content is more simple, than say even Electric Warrior, and earlier works are more wordy, and mystical, yet this is a powerful album.From the onset of 'Metal Guru'(the most perfect pop song ever) which leaves you shell shocked right from the start,then suddenly you are confronted with an utterly surrealistic love song called 'Mystic Lady' which is somewhat akin to 'Cosmic Dancer' (off the warrior album), but somehow sweeter,and though less introspective(that is I think he's talking about someone else!),just as poignant. Next we are refreshed with a basic rocker, accurately called 'Rock On' and a great rocker it is! Continuing on is 'The Slider' which has gotta be the coolest thing I have ever heard, even if I can't understand the basics of kissing a car....'Baby Boomerang' is that girl we all know who walks with her mouth and talks with her boots- fun rock and roll....'Spaceball Ricochet' is utter nonsense, but humbling, and makes sense on some level- great glam-rock tune....'Buick Mackane' is Zepplinesque' and heavvvy!Great riff....next is 'Telegram Sam'-what a gem-reminds me of 'Get it On' but more subtle and confusing....'Rabbit Fighter' is something off of the White Album ala 'Happiness is a warm gun' only the riff is the fattest guitar Marc has ever done to date.....'Baby Strange' is strangely simple and must have taken five minutes to come up with, yet what a hook!!!He pulled that out of nowhere, and one of my favorites! Oh my, finally we get to the best song on this mighty album....namely 'Ballrooms of Mars' Wow- it still blows me away after all these years and lost brain cells.....you've gotta get this album just for that song...anyway, we still have a couple more songs left-'Chariot Choogle' which is so powerful-it will stand the hair on the back of your neck right up!!It sounds like 'Kashmir' by Zeppelin- or should I say that three years later Led Zep would record a song called 'Kashmir\\" that sounds like 'Chariot Choogle'? Last but not least is the song 'Main Man' which is another nothing song, but it hides within it a weary, sad Bolan -tired with this fame, wishing to be back riding on that unicorn.The song is infective, and a good closer to this great moment in the mind of Marc.Also included in this extended 'Slider' album is 'Cadilac', 'Thunderwing', and 'Lady'. All three of these songs are great, and could have fit on this album nicely- especially 'Thunderwing'. By the way, 'Lady' has the best hook of all I think, and years later didn't a band called Aerosmith record a song that has an eerie resemblance musically to this song called 'Dude looks like a Lady'?I wonder.......one more thing- the second CD called 'Rabbit Fighter' is the BEST alterative take of any album ever!!!!  thanks for reading this.the fattest guitar Marc has ever done to date.....'Baby Strange' is strangely simple and must have taken five minutes to come up with, yet what a hook!!!He pulled that out of nowhere, and one of my favorites!

B00006F7S4|3.0|I completely don't understand the obsession with this album.  Yes, Beck is talented, and the music is good.  The lyrics are beautiful, the production well-done.  However, each song sounds the same... where's that Beck originality and color?  Sounds almost as if he harnessed and rehashed all the slow Pink Floyd songs ever released, which are beautiful in their own right, but simply not what I was hoping for in this album.  Someone needs to tell Beck that \\"sad\\" can be expressed in more ways than one....
B000E97HIA|5.0|Just got this CD for my birthday and cannot say how excited I am to own this.  Prince and I are in the same age group and I've followed him since Rude Boy.  It's funky, hip, soulful, inspirational and got that hard beat that only Prince could produce.  It's brilliant and Prince being true to himself and giving us a glimpse into his mind again.  Love it, love it, love it.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Not to say that Tool is a phenominal band, with very complex rythmic chords, creative overtones, and layers of detail creating a very harmonic balance, but over the last few years, their talent on the strings and drums seem to be slowly decaying.  But with age, comes maturity.  This is a very well written album, probably their best one as far as lyrics go.  Definately not near as good instrumentally as say Undertow or Aenima, but as you definately saw in Laterus, their lyrics are amazing.<br /><br />APC was a fun side project, but Tool is back and just as good as always.  While one APC, Maynard experimented with a lot of new elements, and The Thirteenth Step was a decent portrail of his vision, but it was still nothing like the perfection of Laterus.  Tool is  his true calling, and there are definately some very powerful tracks.<br /><br />If you are a fan of progressive rock, Tool, Maynard in general, or just like to hear a wide array of talent, this album is a great add to your collection.  Also, the CD case is awesome.  If you look at it in person at a store or something, you'll see what I mean.  Tool has always had really fantastic CD cases, but this goes a step beyond.  It almost looks like goggles, and there are photos inside that look really sweet when you look through them.  With Tool, this isn't a gimmick, it's a bonus, so enjoy every minute of this full length album!
B000FQJAIW|4.0|Well, the long wait is finally over and we can finally see the StarWars trilogy the way it originally was. I can say that Im angry that Lucas didnt release the theatrical editions with a picture clarity as good as his remaster editions. I have viewed both and the remastered films are certainly cleaner then the bonus disk. Still, the bonus disk theatrical films have accpetable picture and sound (just not as good as his remastered films).<br /><br />One of the big problems with him previously only releasing the remastered films was that most of us had nothing to compare the new ones with. The entire time I couldnt enjoy the films because I was too busy wondering what was new and what wasn't. Mostly I just noticed the really bad additions like the CGI dance scene at Jabbas palace (in the 3rd film). Now with these new DVDs I can admit that there is some new things I like, for example in \\"empire strikes back\\" when Luke is trapped in the Wampa ice cavern the remastered film shows the wampa eating a bloody carcas before luke escapes. I thought this was a nice addition.<br /><br />I still prefer the originals and Im glad Lucas finally released them along with the new versions. shame on him for not putting more effort into the originals, but oh well....
B00005JOVJ|4.0|The Last Stand is decisively the weakest film in the X-Men `Trilogy'. Director Bryan Singer was replaced by Brett Ratner, who, like Singer, never made a sci-fi film before; but while Singer took a restrained and dramatic approach to the genre, Ratner behaves more like a child with a new toy and plays the high-budget special effects to excess. Dramatically, The Last Stand is not as convincing as the first two parts; it does continue the action/soap opera combination that characterized the first two films - as well as the X-Men comics - but the romantic side, namely the love interest between Wolverine and Jean Grey, fails to deliver. Hugh Jackman gives a performance that is hardly as strong as in the first two films, and other than Ian McKellen - clearly the best actor in the whole trilogy - who does as breathtaking a job as he always does - there are no characters here that are very interesting by their own right. <br /> <br />That's another major problem the film suffers from - there are way too many new characters, and very few of them are interesting enough, even if most of them are well-cast. That same problem was apparent in the first film, which introduces all the main characters in a very short span of time; what made the second installment the best one was that it focused mainly on a tight group of main characters, leaving more room for drama. Iceman, Juggernaut (a wasted performance by the fantastic Vinnie Jones), Callisto, Kitty Pryde, Colossus, Pyro and the rest are half-baked characters, mainly in it for the action scenes; Angel - who was marketed as one of the lead characters - has a remarkably small side bit. The only new character that really made a mark was Hank McCoy AKA Beast - played, in a bit of casting genius, by Kelsey Grammer. <br /> <br />But all complaints and grievances taken into account, although the film is not very strong dramatically, and has serious pacing problems with scenes that drag out with not enough action to balance them - whenthe action does come it's spectacular. The final battle of the film is the most impressive action scene in the trilogy, thirty minutes of beautifully shot and choreographed mayhem and destruction. It's a credit to Ratner that he took very bold decisions of letting a large number of main characters die, making a sequel - although possible - very unlikely; and he really let go and went all the way with the carnage, making this final scene a feast to the eyes. This is where the large number of new characters finally makes itself worthwhile, and for any fan of sci-fi and high-effect action this scene is a pleasure. <br /> <br />The Last Stand is not as good a film as the first two X-Men's, but it's a very well made action film. If that's what you're looking for, then you'll love it. If it's drama you're after, you'll be less impressed, but there's still McKellen, always a pleasure to observe, who plays a stronger part here than in X2. A worthy conclusion to the X-Men trilogy.
B0000C3I6U|5.0|If you're into bodybuilding, weight training or even physical fitness in general, rent or buy Pumping Iron.  It will inspire you to work harder, to pursue your physical fitness goals.  Watching these mammoth men training is both eye opening and entertaining.<br /><br />Seeing Arnold in his prime, and Lou Ferrigno as an up-and-coming star in the sport, is fascinating.  The bodybuilders of that era, unlike the monsters of today, had the right combination of size and definition. They also were pioneers and introduced a lot of training and dietary techniques still used 30 years later.  Pumping Iron is a glimpse into that era.<br /><br />Lou Ferrigno said in the 25th anniversary edition that he did not like the film after it came out because of how it portrayed him.  The film, in my view, actually paints him in a great light.  In it we see a 24 year old kid from Brooklyn, hungry for his dream, doggedly trying to reach the top of his sport and cast mighty Arnold down from his throne.  Arnold is the Muhammad Ali of the sport and that's obvious in the movie; he would try to get in the heads of Ferrigno and his competitors.  Ferrigno is the everyman bodybuilder.  He comes off as kind, gentle, down-to-earth but very determined.  I had no idea what a great guy he was and is until I saw this movie.<br /><br />The anniversary edition's extras and outtakes are great.  Seeing all the stars of the film come back 25 years later -- Ferrigno being the only one still in fantastic shape -- is quite interesting.
B00009ATIX|3.0|If you haven't seen the original Solaris then I suggest you do before you buy this, then you'll be able to judge a masterpiece against this act of mimicry. It's woefully let down by the supporting cast all of whom would find it difficult to get parts in a school play. Natascha McElhone plays our hero's dead wife - I guess the producers wanted a striking beauty in keeping with the original film, but she has no emotional depth. Upon realising that she is a clone she exclaims: \\"Oh, my God!\\" as if she's just discovered a run in her nylons. She has neither the haunting beauty nor emotional intensity of Natalya Bondarchuk (compare the scene where a little too much liquid nitrogen is taken. In the original film, it's one of the most memorable scenes in cinema history - in this it's nothing). There are two jokers in the pack, I'm sure some bright spark suggested that one of the characters do something with his hands and so we have a third-rate actor wiggling his fingers about as though he's high on butane: how did this idiot get to be a scientist on a space station? On the positive side, we have George Clooney - the one actor who makes you forget about comparisons with the original.  <br /> <br />The director's heart is in the right place - it's far from the juvenile \\"shoot `em up\\" Hollywood sci-fi, although one of the characters (the glum and sexless one) says in a familiar refrain, \\"kill it, it's not human!\\" If you want to spend time with a good-looking movie buy this, but if you're after something a little more substantial - something you'll be thinking about long after viewing, get Tarkovsky's original.
1594200823|4.0|I heard this book discussed on NPR, then read an excerpt that appeared in the New York Times Magazine, and decided to give it a whirl even though the size of it was a little intimidating - I didn't know if I would have the attention span, quite frankly, to stay through the whole thing.  Pollan goes up and down the food chain to find out exactly where American food comes from, starting with a corn field in Iowa where the \\"golden river\\" finds its way into nearly every food substance we consume in America today (although actually, starting in an oil field in Iraq, to get the fossil fuels to make the fertilizers and power the machines) and ending with chanterelles and a wild pig he has hunted himself thereby removing the middle men.  Pollan's metaphoric summation that Americans are basically nothing more than walking ears of corn, and the subsequent explanation of how this came to be, left me really feeling sorry for people with corn allergies because I can't imagine what's left for you to eat?  Anyway, if you're starting to think green, or eager to explore the truth behind what it means to farm organically (small vs large organic will be an eye-opener for some), or curious about how food is grown and raised in our industrial times, this book will interest you.  Pollan's writing style is easy to follow, if occasionally repetetive, and kept my interest throughout a long weekend.  The middle section of the book is the best, in my opinion, where Pollan spends time living on a self-sustaining organic farm and clearly develops a little touch of hero-worship for the farmer in question.  Not to knock him, though - after finishing the book I wanted to pack up and move to Virginia just so I could buy all my food from there.  My biggest complaint is that Pollan sort of skims over the whole omnivore thing, and I was expecting more discourse on how Americans really need to vary the diet to something other than corn-based-everything because we need dozens of different nutrients, andhow part of the reason we are so easily led by marketers and the companies & government is that we really don't have a definite food culture and we don't know WHAT to eat when we are faced with limitless choice ... Pollan takes the political/environmental/social path rather than the scientific or psychological one, and there's nothing wrong with that in the end.  After all, this is expository journalism, not self-help or a diet book.
B0006SSOHC|5.0|Every now and then a horror movie emerges from the underground, made by a fine bunch of young people, who all share a genuin enthusiasm for the genre in general and for some new hot ideas in particular.    In the early eighties a young Sam Raimi messed around in the woods with some friends, a camera and a handful of nasty demons. The result: \\"The evil dead\\", a funny, sparkling and nasty little horrorflick with some powerhouse inventive camerawork, created mainly out of budget limitations.  Just a few years back, young maverick director John Carpenter set new standards in the slasher genre with \\"Halloween\\", again a low budget film, with some intruiging cinematic techniques to go along. Go back again a few years and you stumble upon \\"The Texas Chainsaw massacre\\", again made by a young, inexperienced but extremely motivated crew on a shoestring budget, forcing all involved with the filmmaking into a creative kind of minimalism.    Now, in the beginning of the new milennium there is again a small little horrorfilm, that oozes as much childlike, playful enthusiasm as it does gallons of blood. I admit, there is more special effects and blood splashes then in its predecessors and a more physical approach to the pain and suffering, but it's done with so much tongue-in-cheeck, that you are more than happy to go along with.     The setting in \\"Saw\\" is in a quircky sort of way not much different then the classics I mentioned above: In \\"Halloween\\", \\"The evil dead\\" and \\"The Texas Chainsaw massacre\\" the protagonists are inside a house and the evil is out there and it is coming to get them. Going back to Roman Polanski's best work: you'll see the same: The frigide girl in \\"Repulsion\\" fights to keep intruders out of her house, as does the pregnant woman in \\"Rosemary's baby\\" when she slowly starts to realize that all other appartment inhabitants might not be as innocent as they seem.    In \\"Saw\\" the two main characters find themselves in a filthy, abandonend bathroom like cellar. They are not, however, because they choose so, and this is immediately a different kind of approach. The young men are bound by physical chains and by a whole bunch of mental ones.  Cryptic talk by a menacing, unseen maniac force them time and time again to reconcider the whole situation and slowly accept the fact that there is a hidden, underlying connection between the both of them, although from the start it is suggested that the two never met before.  To put things even worse, only together they have a chance of getting out of this mess, but their stalker makes it very clear to them early on, that one of them has to die.  And from there on, it only gets worse.    Paranoia, blood, gutted humor, plot twists, sawed of limbs, buddy-movie-things, and mind bending puzzeling to go along, and all slick but juicyful put together with dazzeling camerawork, fast paced editing and chilly atmosphere, giving us the same feeling as the audience got when they saw the above mentionend grand daddy's in this genre.     And, yes, \\"Saw\\", as fresh and young as it is, may still be a baby now, but it wouldn't surprise me at all if in ten years time, another new scary movie would come along, hinting with much delight at this one, making it an instand \\"Another Great Granddaddy Of The Genre\\"
B000003JBM|3.0|Guru (AKA Keith Elam,), Gang Starr's MC delivered his first in a series of Hip Hop Jazz related releases with \\"Jazzmatazz, Vol. 1\\" (1993). I respect Guru's willingness and drive to provide \\"An experimental fusion of Jazz and Hip Hop\\" (as stated on cd). Guru's name is short for \\"Gifted Unlimited Rhymes Universal\\". This twelve-track release (including intro and interlude) is an early notable Rap/Jazz collaboration album. Guru gets things started rhyming on the smooth \\"Loungin\\", while Donald Byrd plays the trumpet and piano. Guru collabs with female singer N'Dea Davenport on the semi-decent \\"When Your Near\\", and then takes his audience on a \\"Transit Ride\\", highlight of this cut for me is Branford Marsalis on the Sax. The chorus and rhymes to \\"No Time To Play\\" is a bit to repetitive for my liking. Guru with help from Lonnie Liston Smith on the electric piano provides a standout with \\"Down The Backstreets\\", Smith's piano play is outstanding, and Guru's rhymes are grimy. With help from Roy Ayers, Guru then drops \\"Take A Look\\" (At Yourself), a track which has Guru kicking knowledge, advising his audience to be accountable,  and make moves rather then wait for them to happen. N'Dea Davenport returns for another half decent collaboration with Guru on \\"Trust Me\\". Guru reps himself on \\"Slicker then Most\\" then collabs with French MC Solaar for \\"La Bien, Le Mal\\". The album's closer and longest track is \\"Sights In The City\\", backed by a soprano sax and flute Guru drops some on point ghetto stories. I agree with reviewer Ziontrain about Guru not yet displaying the lyrical talent (with a few exceptions) that would be found on the Gang Starr albums. Guru for me will always be best remembered for his work with Premo. Bottom line though I have to admit it is hard for me to have the same reverence for \\"Jazzmatazz, Vol. 1\\" as Jazz/Rap collaboration enthusiasts. I recommend checking out this release if you enjoy experimental albums.
B000EULJLU|5.0|My love of this band is disgusting and unhealthy and they can do no wrong in my eyes. With that out of the way I will say that 10,000 Days is not my personal favorite overall, but there are some really great points in this album. Especially in the song \\"The Pot\\"- I can't get over the bass and Maynard's vocal range. Don't expect every new effort to sound like Aenima and Lateralus and you won't be disappointed. Even for not-their-very-best, it's pretty damn good and it beats pretty much anything any other band is putting out these days. Tool remains true to themselves and their art. I don't think there is anything better or more to ask for.
B0000C1HLF|1.0|Charlie's Angels Full Throttle: Words can't describe how stupid this movie is. A puerile hodgepodge of special effects, allegedly hot women in skintight clothes, explosions, and more explosions. Watching this inane movie I had to plug my ears with cotton to keep my brains from pouring out of them. I've seen MST3K movies that made more sense.<br /><br />Say what you will about the original 70's TV show it was never as mindless as this waste of celluloid. In addition to the \\"jiggle\\", there was some semblance of a plot and a story in each episode. This movie is nothing more than a bunch of ridiculous action scenes and special effects pasted together and set to 1980's music. The script has no dialogue the characters have no personality, and the special effects are just there to be there.<br /><br />The plot if you can call it one: Two rings contain the world's -whatever are stolen by a rogue angel played by washed up Demi Moore trying to make a comeback ten years too late. Charlie sends his three stooges (Barrymore looks like Larry to me in this movie, Liu, acts like Moe, and Cameron Diaz might make a decent Curly if she shaved her head.) to go after her and get the rings back. Everything leads up to a big fight between the three stooges and Shemp. (Moore)<br /><br />Director McG is has revolutionized filmmaking with this movie: He's the first man able to direct a movie dumber than a box of rocks. No, strike that, it's offensive to both the intelligence of the box and the rocks inside it. I actually think if I put a picture a box of rocks onscreen for two hours it would be more entertaining and make more sense than this movie. The fast moving frames of this brain melting drivel don't come together to form a cohesive story; they just seem to be there because he wants them there.<br /><br />I don't know who's more retarded the braindead executives who greenlit these orange crayon scribbles calling itself a screenplay, the producers who invested over a hundred million dollars to make this dreck, or the stars who agreed to act in it after reading the puerile script written by chimpanzees high on LSD and Red Bull. Perhaps we the audience are the most mentally deficient because we keep spending money to see this trash even though we know it's garbage. I just know this: I will never watch another movie directed by guys with pretentious one-word names like McG, or Pitof.<br /><br />There are no good performances here. Everyone in this movie is just here for the paycheck. Cameron Diaz, Lucy Liu and Drew Barrymore are just three cardboard cutouts with cell phones taped to them. Bernie Mac needs something to do in between takes for the Bernie Mac show, and Demi Moore is just here to show off what $20,000 worth of plastic surgery bought her. She'd have been better off spending her money on acting lessons, yoga, and groceries for her household or something else worthwhile.<br /><br />IF YOU VALUE YOUR BRAIN AVOID THIS MOVIE! If you want to watch a silly \\"jiggle\\" movie, pick up Hamburger: the Movie, Porky's or Hot Dog: The movie. As stupid as these movies are, they all seem to look intelligent compared to Charlie's Angels Full Throttle. At least those movies have a cohesive plot structure and one-dimensional characters you can relate to in some way.ck, or the stars who agreed to act in it after reading the puerile script written by chimpanzees high on LSD and Red Bull.

B000FA57N0|5.0|This movie delivered. I can't say that it is one of the year's best but I can say that it deserves a chance. This film just plain delivers what we expected. Even for those of you who haven't seen Firefly (Should still be on the air!) this film is a great ride. And for all you people who are glad not to see the same Buffy style acting Alan Tudyk this movies savior. This guy should be getting some serious roles. The film is funny; action packed and doesn't take anything seriously.
B00005JMCW|5.0|I had a lot of fun watching Disney's remake of Freaky Friday. In some ways this updated version improves on the themes of the original 1970's version. Funny and smart, Disney's Freaky Friday makes a great date movie or a great family movie.<br /><br />The story follows a family days before a widow's wedding to her new fianc&eacute;. Daughter and mother are at odds with each other over the upcoming nuptials A trip to the Chinese restaurant and a fortune cookie lead to daughter and mother switching bodies and experiencing each other's lives. It's only when they come to appreciate each other that things change back. I know I'm leaving a lot out; (I usually write detailed synopses in my reviews) but I really want people to watch this movie and experience it for themselves. Disney's Freaky Friday is JUST TOO GOOD TO SPOIL<br /><br />This movie is a lot of fun; the jokes are hilarious and the music is great. My favorite scenes are the collision in the bedroom between Anna and her Mother. I also liked the talk show sequence and the scenes in the car with some McDonald's fries (I can relate.) Really funny stuff. The updated script is well written and the cinematography is solid.<br /><br />Disney did a great job of casting their version of Freaky Friday. Each actor and actress is perfectly cast in their roles. Lindsay Lohan gives a strong performance as Anna. For a young actress she handles the dual role very well, making both a convincing teenager and middle aged woman trapped in a teenage body. Jamie Lee Curtis is hilarious in this movie. Her performance here is worth the purchase of the DVD alone; the way she transitions from middle aged woman to hot teenager trapped in a middle aged woman's body are incredible. Her scenes with Chad Michael Murray made the movie for me. I could actually feel the chemistry swirling between them. She needs to be in more movies; I love watching her perform. Chad Michael Murray is in top form here as Anna's love interest. They need to let him do more on One Tree Hill. Veteran actor Harold Gould gets some great lines in some key scenes. Mark Harmon (NCIS) is a surprise as the mom's love interest. Nice to see him playing something light and funny for once. Look for Christina Vidal as Anna's bandmate.<br /><br />Both versions of Freaky Friday are Shawn James five star Essential Movies. After almost 30 years the story is on its way to becoming a modern classic. While you're buying this one pick up the original 1970's version and the great book both movies are based on.Hill.

B000E1MTXQ|5.0|All I have to say is that this movie was better than the first one. It is better by far than the modern James Bond films and it is worth every penny. The only problem at all with this film is some jumpy camera work that was done to make you feel apart of the chase sequence. All in all, they should never stop. They need to make 10 more of these.
B000E6UK5K|4.0|On an Island has grown on me so much so that my initial thumbs down has reversed towards the upright position! <br /> <br />First off, Dave your music is so superlative and your skills in producing an album are beyond reproach. <br />Why was I initially disenchanted and remain so to some degree? The lyrics--plain and simple.  <br /> <br />Now there are some that chide Mrs. Gilmour as Yoko Ono or as Roger put it: Mrs. Spinal Tap (lmaf at that one!). However as Dave's #1 fan (from a fellow guitarist's perspective), I refuse to bestow unconditional praise on him--he has to earn it. Why are the lyrics lamentable?--They alternate from the painfully explicit to utterly cryptic--basically they are not inspirational nor do they belong in rock music. <br /> <br />Dave please stop giving in to nepotism--your musical reputation is not to be trifled with. Someone who is so meticulous in the production stage should take more care in the front end. You let your wife write on the Division bell and now you have given her de facto prominence on this album. How much longer can we handle hearing about strolls on the beach or lying under the stars? Please find a new writer for the next album (AHEM!--Roger, oops did I say that?) <br /> <br />Dave, the guy was practically humping your leg during Live8. It was so obvious for all to see. He wants to resurrect Pink Floyd! He's made it clear that the band is not a spent force and that he has creative ideas yet! OK the guy was a ruthless and obstinate megalomaniac but those days are behind--And you were all so much younger back then. The passing years have no doubt refined and tempered all of you! You are ready for a new stage! You are completely different men now! Let bygones be bygones! <br /> <br />I must take exception to what you have said in a recent interview regarding the prospect of Pink Floyd. <br />You said: <br />\\"What, would make me want to go back there? What is it that people want? A load of men in their sixties playing their old  <br />tunes in football stadiums? It's mad. They are mad. <br /> <br />No Dave we are not MAD!!  <br /> <br />But you have lost perspective. <br /> <br />If they are old irrelevant tunes than why the heck are you still playing them? The fact is they are still relevant. A lot more relevant than \\"children swinging higher and higher\\" as your new lyrics proclaim. Not trying to be mean--just the hotel guy with a 6 A.M. wake up call. <br /> <br />Pink Floyd is more relevant than David Gilmour solo or Roger Waters solo ever will or can be. The truth is Gilmour-Waters are greater together than the sum of their parts. They are ying and yang, peas and carrots, Lennon and McCartney NOT Lennon and Yoko!! Why can't you egotistical rock stars recognize that? Why do you deny your fans that which is most natural and to be expected? Roger's writing and Dave's musical ear is what has produced some of the greatest music known to man. As a musician myself I recognize that the truly great musicians in the past have played and thrived off each other. While paying respect to your solo work, frankly, it pales in comparison to Roger bringing out the best in you and vice versa. <br /> <br />Lastly, I implore you to consider re-uniting as the ultimate gesture of respect and loyalty to your fans. The fans, which recognized your talents in the 60's and made all of you very wealthy and famous.--We will not tolerate petty squabbles, resentments, laziness or any other tomfoolery! The fans which you have deprived and betrayed by your mismanagement and disregard of the Pink Floyd enterprise. <br /> <br />I'M SORRY BUT YOU OWE US !!!  <br /> <br />So Dave I encourage you. Stop talking about not having it any more, or being tired, or asking who wants to see old guys on stage--we see you up there as an Adonis, with energy to spare, doing what you have always done; and how much more glorious it would be to have \\"THE MACHINE\\" reassume its natural position. <br /> <br />So as I said, let Roger write the lyrics (no doubt he has a lot to say about the crazy world we live in after his 2 decades self imposed exile)...and you add the finishing touches, and I'll see you live at the Skydome in Toronto as I did twice in the summer of '88. <br /> <br />By the way Polly, no offense, I'm sure you are a first rate human being. I'm just unsure if rock music is a medium that is suitable for your writing talents. <br /> <br />p.s - Roger, I'm not sure I can forgive you so easily for being such a disagreeable and destructive force to the band--but I think you have realized your mistakes and hope you would apologize.--I still cannot believe how much creative output you have squandered and denied your fans and your mediocre solo work most likely has been purgatory enough. I would have mercy on you. No one is perfect. You have written to much gold for me to hold a grudge. <br /> <br />\\"icy wind of night be gone this is not your domain\\" <br />
B000E1ZK50|1.0|On paper I bet this looked great. You have interesting actors, and characters, great looking locations and a fun story line. But when all was said and done what ended up on film was just junk. With so much potential I cannot begin to figure out where they went wrong. But more disappointing was the CGI. Nothing ruins a film faster that people interacting with obviously fake villains. I reminded me of how the cartoons walked around with all the real live people in Roger Rabbit only worse.
0930289234|5.0|Here is a quote from Amazon.com's own review: \\"...some of the overlying themes (arms control, nuclear threat, vigilantes)have dated...\\"  I wonder whether anybody out there is following the daily news.

B00005JOVH|4.0|Hello everyone. I saw the movie twice. May 27 and May 29, 2006. Reason why? I made a mistake by leaving the theater when I thought that was the end when the end of the movie credits came on screen. To my surprise that was not the end. I want to tell everybody stay until the end of the movie credits. You will not be disappointed. Overall it was nicely done. It left a lot of plots. Several spinoffs. In my opinion this is only the beginning of an epic journey. I want to also say thanks to all the people who made X -Men The Last stand. In my life right now I am going through a lot of stuff and to have a chance for a few hours to step out of my world made me feel very happy. I also say that it gave understanding of meaning of choices we make. I am a 27 years old. To be honest I never read X - Men comic books. But I love to watch all the cartoons they use to have. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars because what happen to Nightcrawler? Once again thank you. I hope to see another X - Men or spinoff in the next 3 years. THANK YOU ALL
B00005JOFQ|5.0|Usually I am not much of a movie finatic. Particularly since most movies today don't have content, just glamours tricks on film. <br /> <br />But I have read numerous feedback about Brokeback Mountain, so I decided to give it the benefit of the doubt and the movie is so good, I had to pick up a copy of the story book in which Brokeback Mountain is found. <br /> <br />Mind you, though, that content is what many movie viewers don't know about. So if the only movie you watch is action, or flicks, then you probably aren't sophisticated enough to appreciate this film.
B000A6T1KE|3.0|Let me make one thing clear: If you plan to buy this movie, get this version.  The added scenes occasionally offer a glimpse of how they might have made this movie better, if nothing else. <br />Frankly Nemesis is a movie that worked a lot better when seen on a massive screen in the theaters.  It's got what is easily the best and most intense starship battle scene of the TNG movies, and for the first time shows off just how amazingly powerful starships really are. <br />Unfortunately, this was the high point of the movie.  Most of the movie's plot and dialog could be described as a loosely strung-together batch of obscure continuity references and lines borrowed from the television series.  All the character development that they did with Worf on DS9 and Data in the movies seems to have been conveniently forgotten in order to try to capture the feel of the TV show.  It hardly does this very well, though, because the main story is hampered by a series of almost embarrasingly fan-boyish action sequences.   <br />The other dissapointment was the fact that this movie was supposed to be the one where we finally learn more about the Romulans.  Unfortunatley we are shown absolutely nothing new, as the story is entirely focussed on the new race, the Remans, who have apparently been slaves and front-line troops for the Romulans for millenia.  One can hardly fault the writer for taking this easier way out - the Romulans have never been given enough in depth attention for us to learn that much about their culture - but it's dissapointing to see this missed opportunity.   <br />Despite the flaws, however, there are some moments where the show really starts to shine through.  The first conversations between Shinzon and Picard are interesting and thought provoking, as is the underlying theme, but both of these seem to have been shelved to allow more time for the final battle. The result is a lot of fascinating build up to something that is never properly resolved.
1400079179|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It is definitely a page turner! I guess what makes me love this book so much, is the ease with which Brown conveys his theory to the reader. His theory is very ... accessible... for lack of a better word. You don't have to be a history major to make sense of what he conveys.<br /><br />Brown connects the dots between Jesus, Constantine, New Testamant, Old Testament, Knights Templar, Da Vinci, Holy Grail, Dead Sea Scrolls and the modern church and packages it inside a modern day thriller.<br /><br />I am a non-catholic so it may be easier for me to digest what Brown suggests. However, I also enjoyed the \\"Left Behind\\" series which presents the other end of the spectrum so know that my opinion is not biased.<br /><br />If you have an open mind you will thoroughly enjoy this book. If you are sensitive about religion and are not up to a good debate about it, then this book might not be for you.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|Like other reviewers, I found the characters in this film invading my life. The night I saw the film, I did not sleep well; my dreams were haunted by the losses experienced by Ennis DelMar (Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal). The following day, they stayed with me.<br /><br />The film, based on the 1997 New Yorker story of Annie Proulx, throws Ennis and Jack together on Wyoming's fictional Brokeback Mountain where they guard sheep for the summer of 1963. The rancher who hires them, a distant relative of Jack, discovers their liaison, terminates their work earlier in the season than planned, and refuses to hire Jack again the next year.<br /><br />But that doesn't end the relationship. Desperate, Jack four years later sends Ennis a postcard and the lovers soon begin meeting for \\"fishing\\" weekends and week-long vacations at Brokeback.<br /><br />In 1963, of course, life was far more complicated for gay men than today. Even in the big cities, there was no gay rights movement. But in the countryside and west, things were far more tenuous indeed. Lest this point is unclear, viewers witness Ennis' flashback as he recounts the time his father dragged him by the hand to view the dead body of a gay rancher, murdered and mutilated for his sins.<br /><br />Jack and Ennis are enough in love to periodically cast aside their heterosexual pretenses and families and to reunite in the wilderness setting closest, along with one another, to their hearts. But they are not enough in love to permanently eschew traditional lives and set out in life together, whatever the cost.<br /><br />Like other reviewers, I too have heard women complain about the infidelity of Jack and Ennis to their respective wives, and their consequent \\"immorality.\\" What disturbed me much more was their refusal to openly admit their love and act upon it in a meaningful way.<br /><br />Heath Ledger needs no more recognition for his startling portrayal of the conflicted Ennis. For me, he reembodied a Texan friend who died of AIDS many years ago. His refusal to accept his feelings also revived my memories of and sadness for heterosexual men who were equally unable to commit themselves --- which in a few cases I believe caused ill health, and even early death.<br /><br />But Jake Gyllenhaal also did a superb job portraying his personal difficulty and ambivalence.<br /><br />--Alyssa A. Lappenfusal to accept his feelings also revived my memories of and sadness for heterosexual men who were equally unable to commit themselves --- which in a few cases I believe caused ill health, and even early death.

B00000DCH9|5.0|Billy Joel followed up his 1971 album \\"Cold Spring Harbor\\" with this album which sowed the seeds for the rest of his career.  Known for both his ballads and his \\"heavier\\" version of rock and roll, Joel has crafted an album which has served as a trademark for much of his career. <br /> <br />Of course, the signature song on this album is the title track.  Joel's piano and harmonica bring this song to life as he describes playing piano in a smoky bar while tring to earn a living.  The stereotypical characters, such as the \\"real estate novelist\\" and \\"the old man\\" are brought to life by Joel.  \\"Captain Jack\\" is another memorable song from this album.  The lyrics are a little risque, but the song is still very good. <br /> <br />Other tracks, such as \\"Travelin Prayer\\" and \\"Ain't No Crime\\" showcase Joel's many talents.  I give this CD my highest recommendation.  I've been a Billy Joel fan for many years, and I still consider \\"Piano Man\\" to be one of the best albums he has produced.  This album has defined the career of Billy Joel, and it continues to be popular more than thirty years after it was first released.  Listen to \\"Piano Man\\" and witness the beginnings of one of the greatest rock and roll performers of all-time.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|Over the course of thier entire 16 carrer, Pearl Jam has always marched to the beat of thier own drum. They have long since given up on mass adulation that greeted them after the release of TEN. In fact some would argue that after the release of 1994's Vitology, the band did everything it could to lose it's formidable fan base. Beginning with 1996's brillant No Code and right through 2003's Riot Act, the band began to step away from the arena ready rawk of the first three albums to a more challenging brand of music. Music that stirred not only your loins but your soul. Not all fans understood or wanted this change, so album sales began to tail off, Leaving only a group of dedicated and loyal fans who have come to be known as the Jamily. As a proud member of this group it looks like i am going to have to get used to sharing my band again with the general public after people start to really listen to this album, because it is Pearl Jams masterpiece! I instantly loved every song on the album and you will too. If you are a fan of good ol' fashioned rock and roll do yourself a favor and buy it. Pearl Jam is simply perfect from beginning to end. It is a brillant blend of the early Ten,Vs,Vitology era, with the more sophisticated and challlenging later works that turns this record into the masterpeice it is. Believe the hype, it is that good. DISREGARD ANY REVEIW SCORING LESS THAN FOUR STARS. Pearl Jam have always attracted more haters than any other band in rock, so it is to be expected. BUY IT TODAY!
B000F1IQMS|5.0|Director Steven Spielberg has brought to life the tragic events of September, 1972, when Palestinian terrorists abducted and eventually killed the members of the Israeli Olympic team who were competing at the Summer Olympic Games in Munich, Germany. <br /> <br />Infuriated by the murders and seeking revenge, Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir (Lynn Cohen) approved the development of a special team of assassins who's job it would be to track down the Palestinians who were responsible for the killings and assassinate them. The team consisted of Avner (Eric Bana), Steve (Daniel Craig), Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz), Hans (Hanns Zischler) and Carl (Ciaran Hinds).  These men were stripped of their identities, and, if caught, they were on their own.  Israel did not know them.  Their job was to track down the Palestinians throughout the world, excluding Arab countries, and eliminate them. <br /> <br />Working with a secret agency run by Louis (Mathieu Amalric) and his father, the team is provided with pictures and the whereabouts of the Palestinians.  Soon, the group springs into action and the killings begin.  However, it does not come without cost to the Israelis.  Avner, who left his pregnant wife in Israel, is beginning to wonder about the true purpose of his mission, while the others, including Hans and Carl, meet their own demise.  In the end, Avner begins to suspect that Louis' agency may have been providing information on him and his group to the Palestinians, although this was never revealed to be true.  Avner's team succeeded in eliminated six of the eleven Palestinians, along with a female Dutch assassin who was suspected to be working with the Palestinians. Eventually, nine of the eleven Palestinians were elimated.  Two survived. <br /> <br />As for Avner, he and his family moved to Brooklyn, but he still had constant nightmares about his part in the assassinations. <br /> <br />This is a spectacular film.  The historical authenticity is perfect, and I especially thought the original ABC Sports broadcasts from the 1972 Olympics covering the kidnappings were one of the highlights of the movie.  Jack McKay and his co-anchors did a yeoman job of keeping the world informed about the crisis.  I can remember as a young child watching these events unfold on television, and I'm glad Steven Spielberg chose to incorporate them into the film.  The kidnapping scenes are especially shocking, while the scenes with Golda Meir and her advisors show her true resolve to avenge the athletes' deaths. <br /> <br />I give this movie my highest recommendation.  The story of Avner's team is brought to life, and, although there were actually several Israeli teams looking for the Palestinians, the viewer gets a first-hand account of what it was like for these determined men to avenge their countrymen's deaths.  The acting is excellent, and, of course, the directing and production is top-notch.  Its easy to see why this movie was nominated for five Academy Awards.  Watch this masterpiece of a film and experience what it was like for those few tense days in September of 1972.
B00005JOVH|5.0|If you have a friend or loved one with BIPOLAR disorder, this movie will make you think about them. Jean Grey does an excellent job of portraying how someone with bipolar disorder behaves when not medicated properly. The ending with Wolverine and Jean Grey was really sad and almost made me cry !
B00005JOVH|2.0|thinly veiled cultural insights into society's response to homosexuals, minorities, and terrorists will only get you so far. i fell asleep somewhere b/w the fifth melodramatic speech about mutant rights and the part where patrick stewart dies. i woke up three hours later in the middle of a nacho libre preview. if i want to get lectured for two hours and watch bad cgi i'll visit Holy Land. damn you brett ratner.
B000EULJLU|5.0|First off, I just have to say, this is not a metal album. If you want something to headbang to, look elsewhere, Tool has moved on. In fact, with every past realese, Tool has always gone in a different direction, they have never made the same album twice, which is one thing I love about Tool. I notice how lot's of people like to compare this album to Lateralus, and while it may be true that there are moments on this album that are reminiscent of their previous record, this album is about as similar to Lateralus as Lateralus was to AEnima. Sure there's one underlying style, but it was made by the same band! This album will take some getting used to, but over time I would like to think that most people will come to appreciate the sheer complexities and dynamics of this album, if not the brilliant lyrics and rythyms that have always been Tool's signature. This is not Maynard's vent of anger like AEnima, nor is it the brilliantly subtle Undertow or the musical journey that Lateralus is, this is a new album, and it doesn't sound like anything they've released thus far. Seriously people, this is a brilliant CD, it just may not be what you're used to, but you should give it a try all the same.
B000FQJAIW|1.0|Can you believe this quote?? <br /> <br />\\"We put a lot of time and effort into digitally restoring the negatives for the 2004 DVD releases,\\" Singh said. \\"The late '90s theatrical versions represent George's vision for Star Wars. We hoped that by releasing the original movies as a bonus disc, it would be a way to give the fans something that is fun. We certainly didn't want to be become a source of frustration for fans.\\" <br /> <br />Give them something that is fun?  Do they even know their fanbase?  Yes, they do.  They know very well that this would anger all the fans once they found out that it was a LD transfer.  They will keep milking it until we've had enough - then maybe they will release the originals.  Ha! <br /> <br />Lucas should take a page from Anchor Bay and their distribution of the Evil Dead films.  They release countless versions of the trilogy, but at least they give the fans what they ask for: Director's Cut, Extended editions, etc. <br /> <br />George Lucas will always be known as the guy that constantly lets down the people that made him who he is today.  He has given nothing back to those fans that have supported since day one.  He knows exactly what they have been wanting for all these years, but he refuses to give it to them.  He is a selfish jerk. Of course, he doesn't care - why would he?

Once this pattern is established, then the mind tends to rely upon that pattern in future situations, in order to facilitate decision making & action in an otherwise complex world...\\" (The Use of Lateral Thinking).<br /><br />Breaking old habitual patterns is definitely the first & foremost priority in your journey to creativity!<br /><br />Once your shift your focus, you begin to change your paradigms or the way you look at the world around you. Always remember this: Your brain follows the direction of your dominant thought. Once you focus on something, that thing becomes the foreground.

B000AP2ZDK|4.0|Jay Dee was in the middle of blowing up when his life came to a tragic end, far too soon. Luckily, the 30-plus beats that make up \\"Donuts\\" provide a fitting tribute to the man who even the me-first Kanye West referred to (right on the CD cover!) as \\"a drum god.\\" <br /> <br />Dilla's drums, however, don't necessarily take center stage on this beat collage. It's the chopped soul loops that are the main attraction. Bits of vocals and instrumental snippets slide in and out of the mix, creating a future-soul sound that would likely have launched the careers of plenty aspiring MCs. <br /> <br />While I personally prefer Madlib's \\"Movie Scenes\\" instrumental album to \\"Donuts,\\" there's no doubt that this is worth adding to any hip-hopper's collection. <br /> <br />RIP Dilla.
B0000074NU|5.0|Better than the previously released \\"Essential\\" compilation CD. This was a great band that never got the respect they deserved in America. If you want to own a real good overview, then this CD would be it.  <br />I would also recommend \\"Strangers in the Night\\" their double live LP from around '79 that captures them at their finest. One of the best hard and heavy live albums of the 70s.
B00064WSNW|5.0|Robert Fripp is legendary as being *HYPERcritical* - both of his bandmates (whoever they may be at the time) as well as of his own playing and writing.  Basically, he is never happy. I read an interview with Fripp several years ago, in which he stated that the  ONLY album he has *ever* been completely satisfied with was this, Discipline.  Keeping in mind the scope of this guy's work and all the albums that many put in the \\"masterpiece\\" category, that just about says it all.   <br />Simply, there is no other Crimson album that compares.  Period.  And that ain't just my opinion, but also FRIPP'S. <br />In my opinion it is one of the top-10 pop albums of all time.  Flawless.  Mind-bending complexity, lyrical, stone-crunching heavy, intellectual, emotional, serious *and* humorous, it's punk and rock and minimalism and prog and new-wave all at the same time.
B000EYK4GW|5.0|Walt Disney's beloved, modest classic \\"Dumbo\\" carries a different history than most in the studio's library. It lacked \\"Fantasia's\\" groundbreaking animation/music choreography. Its story wasn't as familiar as timeless tales of Snow White, Cinderella, or Alice in Wonderland Disney stamped as its own. Its dialogue was sparse, its main character silent. Even its home video history is unique, being  Disney's first \\"classic\\" title released to the format and consistently in print while Disney withdrew and re-released others.<br /><br />But 1941's \\"Dumbo,\\" deservedly updated in this deluxe \\"Big Top\\" edition, was Walt Disney's favorite films (he says so in one of the DVD's bonus features.)  It's no surprise; this simple story of a long-eared, baby elephant, cherished by his mother, mistreated by nearly everyone else and eventually victorious, addressed themes of maternal love, perseverance, and self-esteem covered in Disney and other children's films to this day.<br /><br />The movie is still a speedy 64 minutes (which cynics would say is about your wait for Dumbo's Disney World ride). Yet young Dumbo and his mother's story are fully and economically told around them through characters like Timothy Mouse, jazz-jiving crows (singing the musical highlight \\"When I See An Elephant Fly\\") and elephants cruel and catty (at the circus) or pink and near psychedelic (in the film's fantasy sequence). \\"Baby Mine,\\" where Dumbo's mother cuddles and rocks him through circus prison bars, is among animation's most moving scenes.<br /><br />Besides the TV \\"Disneyland\\" intro, the \\"Big Top\\" edition also holds two Disney \\"Silly Symphonies\\" (\\"Elmer Elephant\\" the better of the two), a newly sung \\"Baby Mine,\\" a Dumbo DVD storybook, matching cards and an appreciation led by film critic Leonard Maltin. Overall, this \\"Big Top\\" edition gives \\"Dumbo\\" the well-deserved treatment its hero received at the end of the film. It's indispensable for Disney fans, an essential  diamond among children's films.lms. <br /> <br /> <br />
0802130208|5.0|This tops my list of books to recommend to friends because it is such an easy book to enjoy. It's funny, clever, and it never slows down. He's also way ahead of his time (the book was written in the early 60's) in the humor he finds in issues of race relations, homosexuality, onanism, and political correctness.
0307276902|4.0|For all those critics out there, I would ask you to listen for just a moment to my take on this novel. Obviously, Frey's mistake is portraying this as a true memoir while fictionalizing areas but that is not to discount of it in its entirety. I found the novel to be deeply moving and emotional. While there has been so much controversary surrounding this book, I think we should not forget that there are people who found help with their situations through reading this book. I have been effected by many people in my life with similar problems and this helped me understand how strong of an addition alcohol is for millions. If it helps one, then it was worth writing and I for one am glad I read it.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Consider the attempts to explain how people listen to music in Aaron Copeland's book 'What to Listen for in Music'. In my opinion, to the unexperienced Tool listener, this is required reading.  <br /> <br />It's not just music. It's expression.  <br /> <br />I, for one, don't listen to music because the sound appeals to me. Don't get me wrong, I love music that can give me sonic pleasure, but 90% of the time that I enjoy music I like to listen to because I want to be able to appreciate the musician's perspective on tangible reality and listen to the stories that are told; I like to be made to think about what's being said. For example, whenever anyone has a \\"poor me\\" moment, and get to feeling really down because life isn't treating you properly, you should sit down and listen to Korn's song 'Daddy'. If ever I need to be humbled, I like to listen to that sort of thing, and Tool is just another group of stories and/or interpretations and should be taken as such.  <br /> <br />Anyone who doesn't get Tool and just wants to listen to something that really rocks should probably grab this CD, pick and choose what appeals to them, and then play it in their car and enjoy it with the other songs that 'just sound good' to them. I guarantee that this sort of person won't take away each track from 10,000 Days.  <br /> <br />However, if you need something reliable that makes you think, as Tool always does, have a listen to 10000 days. It's Tool, and it works.
