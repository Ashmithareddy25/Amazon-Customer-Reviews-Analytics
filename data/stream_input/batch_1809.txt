B00AE2I4WK|3.0|A Similar plot in a different setting. Dance routines were cool but nothing memorable. A popcorn movie none the less.
0199575282|4.0|For the experienced writer most of the material is already known. But it doesn't hurt to hear it all again!  Not complicated. Down to earth advice.
B000NQRE9Q|4.0|Over the years the Indy movies has provided original and exciting stories. George Lucas has given the world much more than Star Wars.
B009RI4ZKC|4.0|We watched this movie as a family (youngest child is 11) and we all really enjoyed it. It's fun, funny and quirky, a great story of youth, romance and adventure. Wes Anderson did a great job putting it all togther, beautiful cinematography.
B00AH8VU0Y|5.0|If you're wondering if you should watch on after season two of Walking Dead, in short the answer is YES!  One of the hardest things to do in Television is to keep the plot moving forward without sacrificing the original thematic elements and content that drew the audience in in the first place and Walking Dead has done this brilliantly.  As you know from how the last season ended, this is the season of the group entering the prison.  It's a great plot device, as the idea of living in a structure that has many un-tapped resources really is brilliant, as each episode seemingly brings new elements to the table base on the new location that they are inhabiting.<br /><br />Some people I know have qualms about the new characters introduced in season three.  I must say that although it's annoying to have to get used to new characters at times, it's very necessary and the backstory provided by the writers of the walking dead is simply excellent.  I always feel like each new character has many secrets, which will unfold over the coming episodes which makes me like them more, and provides me with excitement to watch on!<br /><br />Simply put \\"The Walking Dead\\" is one of the best shows on television today and is brilliantly shot on 16mm and the acting in it is just as good.  Keep watching, it's just as exciting as it was before!
B004LWZWGA|3.0|The Dark Knight Rises could never live up to the expectations that The Dark Knight created. Someone, somewhere will not be happy with what the end result of the 3rd movie. I guess I'm one of those people, but not because it's a bad movie, far from it. It's is a great movie. This is sort of a strange criticism, though I'm not alone in my stance: this should have been the fourth movie. There needed to be a movie in between The Dark Knight and the Dark Knight Rises. It hasn't even been 8 years in real life, and yet we have to imagine that after two big battles with arch villians, Batman retires. Isn't he more convicted to the oath he made to his parents about fighting crime, doing what he could so no one would go through what they (and he) went through. Bruce Wayne spends more time trying not to be Batman in this trilogy, rather than being encompassed in his obsession to right wrong. I'm sorry but that's not the Batman I've come to know and love in the comics.It's as though he bowed out way too early. And with a seedy place such as Gotham, why would crime magically stop for 8 years until Bane comes into town.  What I think would have been better is a smaller scale movie (which Nolan would be able to do with much bravado)with say, the Riddler, and show Batman actually quitting. He's making mistakes because of he's not thinking straight (d/t loosing his love interest in TDK). He would be battling the police but also trying to do what he swore to do. Then somehow segway (like they brillantly did with the Joker in Batman Begins)that Bane is coming. a plan such as the one that Bane and Talia came up with would take 8 years to come up with. This would leave me more satisfied than, oh hey, I said triology, so I'm going to make this huge movie and end Bruce Waynes run as Batman. It was a rush job. Its in no way a bad movie, just needed more before it to make it epic and not just big.
B001O4XWJM|5.0|Good western, however, how come everyone is so clean. Mortensen and Harris are great actors , but  the part played by Renee Zellweger is over acted to the point of sickness.  Great hats!
B0084U0IEG|2.0|I've enjoyed a lot of Ian McEwan's work - Atonement was moving and Enduring Love was gripping - but this novel just doesn't seem have the depth that would demand an emotional or intellectual response.  I guess the central conceit of the novel is quite clever on one level, but it came across as a trick rather than a revelation that added to the book's meaning.  It compares very unfavourably with Julian Barnes' The Sense of an Ending which was engaging on so many levels.  I spent the first few weeks after I had finished reading The Sense of an Ending telling anyone who would listen that they should read it.  I could not make the same recommendation for Sweet Tooth.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|It was fun to play but was not long enough., beat the game in 2 days but it was fun. Worth the purchase.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|You will not want to stop reading this book. Your activities of daily living will suffer, your family will wonder what happened to you. An amazing thriller. Kudos to Mr. Landay!
1439127700|5.0|I got it for my son-in-law for Christmas but ended up reading most of it before it hit the wrapping paper..If you love American history this is a good read.
0593070631|5.0|Hard cover with lots of pictures. close up information on all the boys. I have not read the book because I am giving it away as a present. But I am pleased with the appearance and it is very thick. Lots of good reading
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This is marvel comics at its best!  I can not wait for the avengers part 2.  If you are a marvel comics fan then this should be a part of your dvd collection
0345803485|1.0|I feel silly for writing a review for this, because I admit I didn't even finish the book.  I managed to finish the first third of the book and put it down.  I put it into a bag and then proceeded to give it away to a neighbor who had commented that she wanted to read this book.<br /><br />Drivel.  This really did not need to be published and I question society as a whole - is this what literature is coming to?
B004YM6JLO|5.0|This is the best vampire series on TV and I hope it never ends.  It just gets better and better and I am waiting for the next season to begin
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Now that I have read all the books from the Hunger Games series, this is my least favorite. Still pretty good though.
B0072OFOM6|5.0|Excellent series if you can stand the blood and erotica!  It picks up from where the first season left off and the actor who replaced the previous one who died was great.  I look forward to season 3
B006P96PAO|5.0|This is definitely the best film yet from the Kendrick franchise. It is a challenge to fathers to step up. The movie is certainly a statement of how God intends fathers to lead, and the consequences of failing in that role. There are some very funny moments, and the movie is not preachy. It is a movie with a message. Given the state of many families in America, perhaps people, regardless of their faith or lack thereof, could see that men are not disposable, and fathers are critically important in the lives of their children. It is a movie that will likely make many men uncomfortable. I can not recommend it highly enough.
B001NSAJ3G|4.0|I knew I was a fan of most of The Moody Blues songs that I heard on the radio, but when I ventured out to listen to their other albums, I was pleasantly surprised by &#34;Days of Future Passed.&#34; I started with &#34;Question of Balance&#34; and &#34;Every Good Boy Deserves Favour&#34; before moving to this album, so I can say that this is one of my favorites. On the other albums, there is always one or two songs that I have to skip, but &#34;Days of Future Passed&#34; is one cohesive unit of music. It's a perfect blend of classical music and classic rock of The Moody Blues. There is also a nice mix between Graeme Edge's poetic influence and the pop/rock influence of the 60s in songs like &#34;Peak Hour.&#34; It is an album that I can have as background music to motivate me while getting work done and it's also one that I can take my time to listen to the lyrics and continually be excited by the new meanings I find behind songs such as the fact that the album's theme is one whole day as well as the passage of time in a person's life, with the songs gradually becoming more somber and serious.
B000I9U9A4|5.0|Big fan of the O'brien books. The movie didn't try to follow any one book. It created a composit story with some of the best characters. O'brien would have been proud of the results.
B0096I9UTE|5.0|Loved everything about this album. I am able to listen to this album on rotation and enjoy the low and slow tempo of the music.
B00992CF6W|5.0|For you guys wondering how to get to survival mode you need to make a new world and under the thing you use to make a name for your world and you'll see a button under it saying creative tap the button and it will go to survival. P.S I love this game!
B005DOKL3E|5.0|I like this sleeve because I could close the case securely. It hold the kindle save and sound. You should buy it.
B008I43DYU|5.0|This is a great calculator.  The numbers are nice and big which helps a lot for old eyes. Having a scientific calculator just by rotating 90 degrees is a clever and great feature.  I would recommend this calculator to anyone.
B000641MB6|4.0|This is an interesting and cleverly worked out addition to the Christmas spirit via the movies.  It reflects the general delights of old movies and the quieter, more trusting spirit of the time.  Totally fanciful in theme, like most popular Christmas films, yet conveying its heart message with good effect.  Like any old movie, of any period really, there is always something to pick at if one wishes.  Old movie fans see those things as well, but generally have decided their preference over obvious flaws and detriments of modern films.  They have opted for the way things were more graciously presented, and Christmas movies are no exception.  This was made post-war when there was a need for regaining faith and hope, along with grace and beauty in everyday life.  People were receptive then and still appreciate it now.  It's always a treat to see different times gone by, men standing up when a lady comes into the room, people wearing dress clothes as a standard in businesses and courtrooms.  It also presents powerful heads of business as well as those leading the legal arena cherishing the same family connections as the rest of us.  The plot and other features are already noted here. Just hurrah for old Hollywood, despite its flaws, especially at Christmastime.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Well written, intense and sexy in a very intimate kind of way....cant wait for the next one to be released!!!
B004HX4RT6|5.0|Game is ridiculously easy up to level 4 and then stops sabotaging itself at level 5 and becomes quite challenging, 100 percent victories at level 4 and 5% at level 5 is my only beef.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Very good book...great educational tool for kids to read to express to them what it was like during the slavery days in a fictional manner.  Heartwarming and heartwrenching all in one.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Greatly enjoyed this book. Definitely makes one look at other aspects from different perspectives. Looking forward to more Robert Landon adventure.
B002EULANU|3.0|Didnt like the fact that it had 9 songs, before you know it- its over. I found myself replaying this album. Love it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is so good. I rate it a 1,000 because Suzane Collins wrote the best book ever!Thanks Amazon for publishing this book.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This book is about a murder that takes place in a small town suburb of Massachusetts.  The story is narrated by Andy Barber who is the town's assistant district attorney.  The victim is a 14 year old boy who is a classmate of Andy's son Jacob.  As the murder investigation starts, Jacob soon becomes a suspect and in an instant Andy's world changes.  He desperately tries to keep his family and life together by saving his son and proving his innocence, even as he starts to realize that his world wasn't quite what he thought it was.<br /><br />I feel there is no denying that this is a well written, fast paced book that is full of those precious \\"can put it down moments\\".  This is not a feel good book.  It is however an intelligent and well written book, which focuses on thought provoking family dynamics such as unconditional love, nature verses nurture, and parental responsibility.<br /><br />I love a book that is full of surprises.  However, I don't like when those surprises are so completely random that they don't make sense nor tie in neatly with the plot.  Happily this is not the case with this book.  What I loved about Defending Jacob is that as much as it kept me guessing, at the same time, when I thought back, I could completely see plausibility in each twist and turn and could see a clear thread through the chapters of how the story worked from beginning to end.  This is a great book that I would highly recommend.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|great can't wait for rest of the season could have a lil bit more action but great story line. Yeah
B003IEJZUG|5.0|There are already a ton of reviews for this title, so I don't know of anything else I could add. I was afraid it would be dense and hard to read, but although there is a lot of information about animals and zoos, it was a quick and really enjoyable read. In spite of the ease of reading, it leaves you with lots to think about.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|What can I say. MItch is always good. The book was different. But made you think and reflect, which is always good.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|The first person narrative really puts you in the harrowing story of Pi.  I've been meaning to read this book for years but just never picked it up.  I was recently motivated when the film version was released.  I was very pleasantly surprised that the movie followed the book and held true to the story.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The book was very entertaining. Different. Had a hard time putting it down. Kept you wondering until close to the end.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Charlie is such a character. I flew through this book. Not boring at all. Im going to try to make more (infinite moments) like charlie had in the book. And I learned from the book, that I need to participate more often.
1439102430|1.0|This was my first and last Kathy Reichs book.  I was interested as I love the character Temperance Brennan from when I used to watch the TV show (which has also jumped the shark, sad to say) and had always meant to pick up one of her books.  But this version of Tempe was rather dull and uninspiring. The story wasn't that interesting, and the male leads were horribly unsympathetic.<br /><br />But the thing that really bugged me was the ridiculous product placement - I may use an iPhone, but I do not refer to it as an iPhone REPEATEDLY!  \\"I set the alarm on my iPhone\\", \\"I checked my iPhone for messages\\" on and on.  It is really hard to miss.  That and calling the rental car the \\"camry\\" as in \\"meet you at the Camry\\"- I mean no one talks like that!  You rent a car and then refer to it by model name?  It made the whole dialogue seem stilted.<br /><br />So sorry - no more of these for me.  There are many other writers out there to try...
B009IF82SK|5.0|This episode did not disappoint, funny moments were present, sheldon as always unique and the main character, is just overall a great experience.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|DeMille as usual keeps you on the edge of your chair with the intrigues of the enemy - and your supposed friends and colleagues.  It is always exciting when a new DeMille is published.
1419705849|5.0|Only series of books that our 9 y/o will read from front to back more than one time. Now if we can get him to read other books just as fast.
B001VLXNO2|3.0|After twenty pages realized that I had read this book several years ago.  The details of the difficulties are still interesting and it is amazing that they did the climb with what we could consider inadequate clothing and gear.
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|This is one of my favorite time periods with the old cars and trucks. A simpler way of life in those days, makes you think we might be better off back then until the moonshine business took off along with Prohibition closing in on our personal liberties. This movie has somewhat of a sub plot reminding you how we are losing our personal liberties today as with bigger government in our lives and only making things worse.
B006TTC5JK|5.0|Jimmy Stewart at his best.  Great family entertainment.  One of very few examples of a movie that I enjoyed more than the stage play.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Some movies deserve to be seen in theaters. This movie fits into the Top 5 list in this category. You got to watch it in IMAX to appreciate the grandeur. As far as the story goes, yes, the movie is a bit slow to take off but after an hour into it, I bet you'll not leave your seat. The ending is particularly epic. Hans Zimmer added repetitive value to the movie.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|It is a neat game. I like games that are not to hard to play on my phone/tablet. I really like it.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|Such a great show.  I had to watch seasons at a time.  Definitely addicting!  Love Donald Draper and crew.<br /><br />Great costumes!
B008XG1X18|5.0|The Pinterest app for Kindle Fire is the reason I don't get any sleep anymore... I can't put it down!! :) It's super easy to use. It's also really handy when I want to make recipes but don't want to print out a whole sheet of paper... I can just bring my Kindle with my pinterest app into the kitchen to cook! :)
B008LVCKH6|5.0|This story was so different and had so much humour.  I had many good chuckles and laughs.  Terrific book to read and enjoy.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|The animation is beautiful and matches the story.  No words, just stunning artwork and music.  I have purchased this DVD for every new baby born.  I give it to the parents along with the plush snowman.  I cannot say enough good things about this video.  No need for language - the animation and music tells a wonderful story.
0446573027|5.0|I had fallen out of love with Baldacci. I never like the Camel Club series, but read a review of this book and decided to give him another try.  Love, love, love the new character, he's so interesting.
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|We're never giving any insight into these characters, so it's pretty hard to care about what is happening with them.  There was great potential to tell a story here, but it was never mined.  We never really understand why she suddenly feels a need to reignite the sexual aspects of the marriage after such a long time, or for that matter why he is so resistant.  The scene in the hotel room when he looks at her and stops---- what was that?  That just really muddied things up with no later resolution.<br /><br />Then ending just sort of muddles to a stop, though the sequence in the end credits was cute.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|The movie is fun. The blu-ray presents it as well as you could possibly wish for.<br />What is there not to like about this product? Nothing I can think of.
B009RI4ZKC|5.0|This movie is quirky, well acted, and wonderful.  The characters in this movie are great and well-developed.  The direction style really ads to this movie.  Moonrise Kingdom is funny, touching, sarcastic, and a little sad all at one time.
B000OJFV4C|5.0|....to this fabulous series, and Season 1 kicks it into high gear right out of the box!  This is such a well-directed and well-acted series, combining political action and personal intrigue.  I've watched the entire series (Seasons 1-4) at this point and the character and story development is masterful.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Its an okay app. Some puzzles are really good and I can challenge myself with them. The hold back is that I just don't. like some of the puzzles. If you want different ones you have to buy them. Other wise great app and I toatakly recommend it to you!!!!
B008FRFN7A|1.0|Didn't work with my Fire.  None of the print apps seem to work with .pdf's  I'm working on this every other day.
B009ZM7BEC|5.0|Is there any possibility this amazing movie has spanish subtitles? if there is one, im interested in buying it, either in blu-ray or the DVD traditional.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The story was very predictable;  I thought the ending was awful.  I was surprised; most people loved it!  I did not.
B001JNNDGA|3.0|I didn't see this film when it first came out in theaters,I just couldn't stomach myself to go see it cause of the quote un quote Hollywood concept now these are only my opinions there is only one film about Jesus that I loved as a child and years later still love its \\"Jesus of the Nazareth\\"This film still brings tears to my eyes & my entire family every time that we view it,its just a way better movie...
B004I8WD7S|4.0|The case is a great deal for the money.  I gave it 4/5 stars because while it's well built, the edges are a bit sharp, the bottom section is a little thin due to the opening for the connector, and the plastic shows any fingerprints.
B005RUV0NY|5.0|The only thing I don't like about The Walking Dead is there aren't enough episodes! I wish the seasons were longer because they are so good.
B007THA4FI|2.0|It isn't that this book isn't well written -- it is.  I think that I got about halfway through, expecting that something, anything would happen.  It's interesting enough in terms of everyday life happenings, but my own life is probably as interesting.  I just gave up, which I hardly ever do.
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|Pentatonix makes such great harmonies on these classic Christmas songs. The arrangements on the songs are very nice also.  I loved all the songs.
1451696191|5.0|Very relatable story! Wish I had this book when I was in high school and definitely saved my life.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Very help full great app.Keeps you well informed of your batt life.Would recommend to anyone who has a Kindle. or a Kindle Fire.
B005M5PENG|5.0|I fell in love with Hawaii 5-0. I already had an amazon gift card, and while searching for the season on DVD, I discovered you can purchase individual episodes for a considerably low price. Also, no waiting or hassle for shipping. It is available right away and the best thing is you may keep the video as long as you have an Amazon account. Instant video is a terrific product. Having Hawaii 5-0 available makes it 10 times better.
0525952926|5.0|I have loved both of the Century Trilogy books and can say they have been an amazing source of knowledge and insight for me. I feel that History books fail to impart the emotion or build up of historic events, and books such as Follett's enable people to feel as if they were there and feel some of the real emotions of those times.
1250006341|5.0|This book is a must read for all Downton fans. The pictures are amazing and it does give you a behind the scenes look of the filming of Downton Abbey. I loved how it also had side stories of where they get the ideas and the plots and some real life inspiration. It's a fascinating story, especially the one involving Cora and how she would have been a \\"bucaneer\\" and where her money would have ended up. I also loved learning about how the inheritance and title would end up with cousin Matthew- fascinating details on British aristocracy, that I would not have known about other wise. Can not wait for season 3
1452110581|5.0|I almost peed on myself because the poems in this book made me laugh so incredibly hard.  I also laughed so hard I cried, and had a pretty intense coughing spasm to boot.  Despite all that pain and suffering, I still love this book.  I keep it on my coffee table and read it aloud to anyone who is (or sometimes isn't) willing to listen.  My cat lover friends love it.  My dog lover friends love that I love it.  Everyone loves it.  If you have cats, you should buy it.  And just for extra flavor, I should add that I did not identify or Love every poem in the book.  But, I did identify and love enough of them that I think it's worthy of 5 stars.
B000ZHCQ5U|5.0|Dr. Strangelove is a classic.  It is witty, hilarious, and Peter Sellers can't be topped. My favorite film of all time!
B000M39HB8|5.0|this is an old favourite movie and we watch it each year about this time.  It has the song &#34;White Christmas&#34; with Bing Crosby, so it cannot be missed!
B005MMJ84K|4.0|I found this book to be incredibly addicting! I never wanted to put it down and found myself wishing I could read faster!! Every page brought new twists and I think I liked it even better than the first book.
B003YNFYD8|5.0|As described, price was affordable.  Took quite awhile to arrive since it came from overseas which I didn't realize.  Nice Christmas gift.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|This game is very boring and there's nothing to it. Even my six year old wasn't amused. He handed my phone back after 1 minute.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|I picked this one up because the marketing push behind it was hard to moods, but also because I had heard it was the result of a NaNoWriMo effort and it made me curious. Harkness piles on plenty of esoteric trivia wrapped up in the familiar trappings of a supernatural romance. While the main character, at times takes you right up to the edge of Mary Sue territory, she never topples in and becomes the audience stand in that plagues the genre. A Discovery of Witches was a fun read and I look forward to the sequel.
B002PMV9FG|3.0|I was disappointed it did not come in the case. This is the first dvd I bought off-line that wasn't in the box so even though I paid .75 I still paid $2.99 shipping. I personally don't know if it said no case it was something I didn't know to look for, since all other movies I bought came in the case I guess I just assumed they all did. Especially when you look at the item you are looking at a case. I wiill know better next time. I would of paid more for one in a case.  Haven't watched it it looks scratched so hoping when we get around to a Harry Potter Marathon it's going to be ok. Did put it in the dvd player makes a funny noise but with the volume on you don't hear it.
0345803507|5.0|I loved this book, all three! And they came in with a few days and were cheaper than any book store!
B008LY9AWG|5.0|Very fast read and a typical Michael Connelly. Great book for the kindle that you can read anywhere. Con is that they were finished too fast. I would have enjoyed longer stories.
B007REV4YI|2.0|Slow, humorless, boring, derivative, and joyless...<br /><br />SPOILERS!<br /><br />Let's set aside the fact that Skyfall didn't make the least amount of sense.  Sure, if Javier Bardem wanted to assassinate M, he didn't need a private island, a massive army of evil henchmen, and the hacking powers of God almighty.  He could have happily shanked her on the sidewalk somewhere, no fuss, no muss.  I wouldn't have cared if they hadn't taken away everything which made Bond cool.<br /><br />It's a problem that he's a blonde thug, but it's even worse that he's gone from a suave, unflappable wisecracker to an emo moper.  Now, there are no chicks in bikinis, no corny puns, no cool gadgets, no insane action set-pieces and no fun.  Part of what made Pierce Brosnan the best Bond ever was that every cocksure second he was on screen he looked like he was having the best time of his life.  Yeah, Craig's Bond drives cool cars... but he doesn't savor it.  He's a sad sack who doesn't get an iota of enjoyment out of being an international superspy.<br /><br />Probably because he sucks at it.  The plot is a list of him failing at things:<br /><br />In the opener, he fails his mission (getting shot by both enemy and friendly fire), hides and drinks with frat boys.  Then he fails all his Mi6 evaluations, but M puts him back into service anyway. He tracks down a sniper, doesn't stop the assassination, and accidentally kills the sniper before getting any information out of him. When the girl's life is in danger, he can't save her because he's nervous and can't shoot very well.  He fails to stop Bardem from escaping MI6.  He lacks the credibility to convince anyone that Bardem is walking into the Ministry with a murdering rampage in mind.  Craig shows up late to the Ministry. Bardem has already killed a few people.  M only survives because two different guys throw themselves in front of bullets for her.  Craig walks in and, in a rare display of confidence, winks to a wounded man and shoots acouple fire extinguishers (yay Bond!).  This time, as Bardem escapes, Craig doesn't even try to follow him.  Instead, in a bold stroke of WTF,  Craig decides it's time to take M to his dead parents' decrepit mansion in the Scottish highlands, populated by a guy who's not Sean Connery.  Not because it's a secure location, but because Craig wants to blow it up, because he's so emo about it.  He fails to outmaneuver Bardem, so he tricks him into thinking he's dead by dropping into a frozen pond while Bardem watches (which totally works).  Finally, in the lamest ending in Bond history, Craig kills Javier Bardem by sneaking up and, without warning, throwing a knife into his back-- and M dies anyway.<br /><br />This new Bond was supposed to be fresh and visceral, but instead they're re-hashing the exact same, \\"Bond is a relic of a bygone era\\" business that they were doing with Pierce Brosnan, but without Bond standing up for himself and pushing back.  He's witless, he can't spy for crap and he can't shoot straight.  And now Miss Moneypenny is a confident black feminist.<br /><br />In Skyfall, Bond is England's whipping boy, and he takes it.<br /><br />P.S.  There are no poker chips worth $4 million Euros each.
1419705849|1.0|Book itself was good.<br />But delivery was so late. It was pre-ordered item. When I got a book, my son already finished book which he borrowed from his class mate.
B003ZSJ212|3.0|depending on a persons point of view.<br />sounds like i,ve heard that line somewhere before.oh well! back to my review.<br />this version is quite different from the movie that i enjoyed much better.<br />althought every disc might not be up to par it certainly has a broader prespective of<br />what most fan,s enjoyed about star wars when it was first released in a galaxy<br />far,far, away.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|This movie is HILARIOUS!!! Great cast, funny one liners....awesome movie, great singing. Rebel Wilson definitely stole the show in this role
B007NKLTZK|3.0|as a musical icon both chris squire of yes and steve hackett of gensis have put together<br />a great blend of prog rock hensforth the lp,s name squackett.<br />both of them duet vocally very well and the track selection varies on the individual listener..<br />i surmise that if a sequal is eventually released it will probably be called<br />squackett 2.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this is a really fun game. people are complaining about not being able to exit the game but I think its more on it being the user not being smart enough to pay attention. when you click on the stuff button you should notice the kindle arrow pop up at the bottom from there all you have to do is click on it then click on the kindle house. as far as the unplanned purchases again this is on the neglect of the user or in most cases the parent. instead of not paying attention to what the child is doing play the game WITH them that way you are spending time with them and not just &quot;getting them out of your way&quot; OR you can be proactive since you ALREADY KNOW that your credit card is attached to your account simply LOCK IN GAME PURCHASES and make it so you have to enter a password. don't blame the game programmers for your inability to be active with your children. its not their fault you are nor paying attention to what your children are doing. my 4 year old LOVES tthis game an other gameloft games. she has never made not one purchase I have not known about simply because I have LOCKED the in game purchases and I gave actively taught her to ask me if we can get something. its simply called being sn ACTIVE PARENT.  in the details of the game the programmers TELL you that this game has the option of in game purchases. READ the game details before you download a game that way you know what to expect from a game. please disregard all the negative feedback from parents that don't want to take responsibity for their lack of active parenting
B00920HMNM|5.0|A+ fine album. Always a fan of Donald Fagan and Steely Dan.<br />This is again one of the albums I will cherish forever.
B009VB97EY|4.0|I expected so much more from this movie since it was star studded with some great- and hot- actors. But instead I was disappointed. It was worth watching and had an okay plot. However, I wish it had lived up to my expectations.
B007HOOAH6|4.0|My daughter loves &#34;reading&#34; this book.  It hasn't helped with getting her to use the potty yet, but I do think it's helping her grasp the concept.  I wish it were a little more wordy, I find myself filling in parts of the story (specifically, what where the cat and dog go).  Short, fun read for toddlers.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|awesome lots of really cool games to choose from something for everyone I like that there are so many games just wish you could get more points
B005HJWWW8|4.0|this little thing surprisingly worked very well.  who would have thought that something like this would make such a difference.
B000SEGTI0|3.0|Philip K. Dick's \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\\" is a very interesting, thought provoking book.  Unfortunately, Dick's writing in it is also very technically flawed.  My biggest problem occurs at the point where the actual plot begins:  Deckard is told about eight androids who have sneaked back to Earth.  But, where did that information come from?  Supposedly, his predecessor came up with it.  But, how?  These androids are, for all intents and purposes indistinguishable from humans and have gone to great extent to keep themselves secret.  Yet, somehow, Deckard's predecessor has their number, names, and addresses.  Plus, no one, not even the police, can be sure someone is an android without testing.<br /><br />My second biggest problem is that Dick doesn't change his writing to match the supposed personalities of the characters.  Most specifically, the secondary character J.R. Isadore's \\"voice\\" is flat-out wrong.  He's supposed to have failed an IQ test and is characterized as being a \\"chickenhead.\\"  Yet, the vast majority of his external speech and all of his internal voicings are extraordinarily eloquent and deeply philosophical.  It's highly jarring.<br /><br />And finally, there's an issue that comes up near the end where someone talks about having been \\"close friends\\" with the infiltrating androids for two years.  As far as I can make out, it looks like those androids have only been on Earth for a short time.  Well, I take that back:  some of the androids seem fairly new to Earth, while others seem to have long term Earth personas.  But, supposedly, they all arrived in one batch.  So, that, in itself is a problem.  Yet, even if I'm wrong about how long the androids had been on Earth, the person claiming long-term friendship with them should have been unable to have ANY contact with them.  Plus, if there had been contact, it would indicate a huge conspiracy somewhere and Deckard should have been wetting himself trying to get that information up the chain.Yet, the issue just fades away.<br /><br />Those three holes in Dick's universe are big.  If the world he's set up here hadn't been so interesting, I would have given the book a much worse rating.  But, still, I can only give it an OK 3 stars out of 5.
B0083Z3O8Y|4.0|Jane Austin captures the styles and manners of the period so well. I find her works very interesting and informative.
1451695195|4.0|I was really enjoying this book until I hit Chapter 33; it seemed that that part had been written by somebody with an entirely different experience from the rest of the book.  Still, all in all, it's a very interesting book.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|you feel really smart when the grids are small, but the upper levels can really be tricky to solve.  love this game, but very addicting!!
B00099BPP6|3.0|There's something odd about this recording -- it should be better, given the cast -- and I think that the sound engineering is at least part of the problem.  There are times when Bergonzi, Scotto, and Fischer-Dieskau are singing solo when they just sound rough, perhaps as if the microphone is too close?  Then you listen to them in the ensembles and they sound, so to speak, like themselves.  In these latter cases, the microphone placement seems a bit more distant, and it catches the voices as we remember them from other recordings.  When I first listened to \\"Cortigiani!' and \\"Piangi fanciulla\\"  I didn't like them at all, but I played them again, and while the sound still bothered me, it was clear that Fischer-Dieskau and Scotto were singing well -- i.e. phrasing well, sustaining the notes etc.  In the \\"Bella Figlia\\" quartet, they and Bergonzi and Cossotto as Maddelena sound just fine.  Some things go very well -- Bergonzi's \\"Parmi veder\\" is really good, and Scotto is quite riveting in the final Act.  About Kubelik's conducting, I'm less happy -- he accompanies \\"Questo o quello\\" clunkily, but in other places, he conducts with clarity and even elegance, though rarely with excitement.  Not an unqualified success, then, but I think that not all the fault is with the musicians.
B007SGM084|5.0|I could never read just one chapter.  Wonderful book.  Can't wait to see who will be cast as Christian in a movie.
B001MSMULG|2.0|The characters were boring, the bad guys acted stupidly, it never really take off. It was a lot worse than Brad Thor or Vince Flynn novels.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|I got this because I loved the 4HWW and 4HB, and I love cooking and learning.  Did not disappoint!  Tim is the man :)
B008DM4OTA|4.0|My son loves to play on my phone, but most of my games are too hard for him. Once we figured out this game, he loves it and plays it all the time.  I took one star off because there were no instructions (that I saw) so I had to figure out what to do, starting from the beginning where the patients arrive and just sit there.  The other con is that there are only a few games that repeat over and over with no changes.  He loves it but I worry that it will get boring fast.
B008D19WBQ|5.0|I was waiting for this edition for so long!<br /><br />This Collector's Edition is really great, 10 seasons inside, excellent packaging.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Amazon instant video is so easy to use on my netflix player! This show is so addicting! I dont have cable so I love the fact that I can get it instantly for $1.99

B00AHSMDQY|2.0|Lacked so many things... horrible acting, hard to keep your attention, this just seemed nothing like other BatMan movies previously made!
B009329ZF2|3.0|The story might be predictable  but its a heart pumping watch. We all enjoy it and would not mond seeing it again and again.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|With every season the show just gets better and better. The special effects are amazing and the characters really bring the show to life. The more you get to know them the more you are rooting for them to survive.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Very sad that the franchise has over but this film had made a significant and memorable closure to the series, love it!!
B00785P2QC|4.0|good game fun cant wait to expand and make my city awesome looking......Awesomapolise will be the best city ever. glad money collects when I don't playing.

B000VDDDVO|5.0|This great movie is one I have wanted for a long time... It is one of those movies I would lend out and never get back!! Go figure!<br /><br />So here it is the colorised AND black and white version! It was delivered quickly and arrived in excellent condition!
1609611543|5.0|Anyone with undiagnosed digestive problems should read this book.  Gluten could be the cause of many people's quasi Celiac diagnoses.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game It is so awesome and I think you should buy it if you are intrasted in this game I just adore it when it came In the app store I was so excited
B001O4FGG4|5.0|This is a must see for horror movie fans. It's what the movie doesn't show that makes it great. Awesome!
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|It was not what I had hoped for or expected it to be.<br />it was a let down from hollywood.
1423140605|5.0|My son requested this book and loves it.  He has a hard time putting it down.  He loves the entire series.
B008YW5RH2|5.0|its awesome Its good for tennis lovers time passes by when I'm playing this game it awesome I love it
B006YXTRHY|5.0|This was a great movie and the streaming worked very well. The picture quality was fantastic and makes me want to stream another movie again. I defiantly would watch this movie again through amazon.
B0010AN7Y0|5.0|I loved this movie when I first saw it years ago and I still do. If you like adult British comedy this film is a real gem.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|My sister got me into this game on her Xbox and I was happy to find it for my Android. This version does NOT have all the extra play options the Xbox version has, but I understand that it being the mobile version, they probably wanted to cut down on size.<br /><br />It still is fun, and has some challenging stages. But for the rice of the game, it would be nice to have more options and update the graphics, they look a bit blocky, and the load screen, menus, and some of the other screens and animations look a bit aged, and on HD screens like my One X, it is even more noticeable.<br /><br />Its still a fun time waister, but would be nice to see an update with more play options and updated graphics for the price.
B00992CF6W|5.0|finally Kendal came out with minecraft so amazed good game love it it is Coll even though. I don't play a lot because. I am on the xbox thank you mojang sorghum if I did not spell right
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Where all of the other books about elite warriors fail, this one succeeds with flying colors- forget about the mysticism of warrior rights of passage; this story removes that curtain and testifies to the power of the human spirit in overcoming challenges far tougher than BUDS.  This book eloquently strikes at the heart of what makes human super-achievement possible- love and faith. . A unique story that will inspire all of us especially those affected by drug or alcohol addiction.
B004GVUPFE|1.0|It dose suck I never can get the red thing in the correct spot I do not know why I got this app
B007MU85D0|5.0|I expected to hate this album.<br /><br />And I couldn't have been more wrong. After one song, I was hooked and I can't stop listening. Some songs are weird... one is about a dragonfly that runs away from home and comes back with an epic story of a war between birds and bees. Other songs are more serious and delve into topics of life and death and love.<br /><br />The music, vocals, and lyrics all work so well together and paint these wonderful landscapes of sound.<br /><br />I highly recommend checking this album out. You won't regret it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Truely enjoyed reading.  Some kinky scenes but overall at love story.  Written for a typical woman reader.... women always over think situations.
B0049VZ222|5.0|Love this show. Can't get enough can not stop watching.<br />Not your every day zombie show.. :):) all smiles. D
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Enjoyed the trilogy of 'Fifty Shades'.  Yes, some kinky sex but over all it's a true love story.  It will be interesting if movie series are produced.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|First I want to thank Chris for his service.  It is people like him that help me sleep at night knowing that our backs are being watched.  Thanks for the amazing recounting of your life in service and your wifes input was very interesting as well.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|This book was very enjoyable reading.  I also enjoy the movie staying close to the story line in the book.
0553801503|2.0|I'm not sure if a harsh two stars is fair, or if it just reflects disappointment at the marked drop off in quality from the previous three books.  Rambling, unfocused, with little character/plot arc.  The characters you're likely most interested in are largely ignored.  There are a few powerful scenes in the book, but it's mostly slogging through it.  The main point of this review is to report that book five, of which I've read about 80%, is a big improvement, with all the key characters (who are still alive)returning.  I might never have risked reading book five if my girlfriend didn't already have a copy on hand.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This is another great effort by the Kendricks.  I love the message and it leaves you feeling that Dad's do make a difference in the life of their kids.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|This is actually my favorite Avenger movie.  Acting is very, very good and it keeps your interest throughout.  Only a couple of slow parts, but excellent visuals and very well written.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Just finished reading and really enjoyed it.  There were little hints throughout the book about the outcome but I was totally surprised by the finish. It was easy to read and kept my interest throughout the book.
B005LAIHZY|3.0|Great visuals, as expected from a Pixar production. Story line isn't so great, writing not so great and it gets really slow at times.  I had to force myself to watch it in one sitting. The Irish accents made it hard for me to understand at times, but I managed. A better decision for me would have been to rent this one, not buy it.<br /><br />Younger folks may respond to this movie more positively than me.
B007REV4YI|1.0|Okay, before I begin with my scathing review, this movie wasn't bad from an entertainment perspective.  I liked it.  I had fun and if there is any challenge to watching it, it was to turn off my brain long enough to enjoy the sheer fun of it.  A cerebral exercise, this movie is not.  Cliché villain, impossible plots without reason and big explosions is more this movie's forte.<br /><br />This movie follows three evolutions.  Improbable, Stupid, and Impossible.<br /><br />Improbable<br />1.  The opening sequence was great.  Still a little unbelievable to survive that immense fall.  It should have shattered every bone in his body on impact.<br />2. Bond left the shards in his body, which was causing immense discomfort for months.  Even the doctors at MI6 didn't think to remove them.<br />3.  The shards from his shoulder easily matched up to the henchman they had no details on, but was still able to track based on the fact he is only  1of 3 people that use the weapon.<br />4.  Bond lets the henchman assassinate a random dude when it was clearly in his ability to stop him.<br />5.  Bond dumps his only communication to his partner/slash backup in a martini drink prior to talking to the informant.  This seems like a very bad idea for a superspy.  Consider if Bond needs help, or he is killed and the backup needs to deliver the information.  By disposing the mic, his partner is left clueless.<br />6.  Bond sleeps with a prostitute.  Apparently STDs are a weapon of choice for 007.<br />7.  The villain is somehow able to infiltrate MI6 Headquarters, hack into the director's computer, and plant a bomb without anyone knowing.  How this is done is never explained.<br />9.  Bond lets the prostitute get killed.  Two minutes after she is murdered, it becomes abundantly clear Bond could have made his move before her death.  Considering Bond's reaction to a fellow agent he was ordered to let die earlier in the movie, you'd think Bond would be a little more sympathetic to saving her.<br />10.  Bond has a secret warehouse with a supped up super car complete with machine gun jublies, but no weapons stash.<br /><br />Stupid<br />1.  The villains plot is to embarrass MI6, then kill M in some elaborate plot involving getting captured, escaping, M being questioned at the ministry for a previous failure to stop the villian, making his way to the ministry without out being caught or shot by security, and assassinating M.  At the beginning of the movie Bond was easily able to sneak into M's apartment flat and take her by surprise.  Villains are stupid.<br />2.  The villain's hideout is an abandoned city/island the villain had faked a biological disaster at.  You'd think the government would have sent in a HAZMAT team to investigate the incident, but apparently not.<br />3.  It only took two days to decrypt the secret file.  Using any modern encryption, even with the world's largest super computer, which the villain did not have, would have taken decades, if not centuries to accomplish.  The villain had nothing more than a room full of server racks with lots of wires hanging out from what I am pretty sure was nothing but rows of switches.  He needed a room full of Cray super computers, and I doubt that would have been successful, least not in 2 days.  BTW, what kind of bandwidth was he getting on that island and why wasn't service cut off when the island was abandoned?<br />4.  The MI6 super hacker can access anything he wants with a standalone desktop computer, which he was able to plug a thumb drive into with no concern for security on the entire network.  Not to mention Bond broke the encryption by randomly connecting plain text that was visible in the encryption (No modern encryption displays any type of plain text in the code).  Not to mention how impossibly well funded MI6 seemed to be.  I work for the government and I can't even get toner for the printer.<br />5.  I am fairly certain arsenic doesn't dissolve the bones (or muscles) in your skull.<br />6.  When MI6 moved to its underground layer, the villain somehow knew the complete layout, and exactly what room he would be held captive in, the security he'd be in, the sewer exit in the room, and the direction through the sewers to get to the ministry and where he needed to plant the subway bomb to sabotage Bond who would be arriving at the exact time a subway train was traveling over him.  He did this without so much as a watch.<br />7.  The villain was kept in a see through Plexiglas cage, bounded, with no bathroom while armed guards watched him.  Despite the unlikely prison quarters, somehow the villain escapes and kills the guards.  It is not shown how this is accomplished.<br />8.  The villain stands in the middle of an open room shooting people in a building filled with armed security and no one shoots him.<br />9.  Bond goes into hiding with M, leaving a trail for the villain to find him.  Bond doesn't think to put M someplace safe.<br />10.  MI6 doesn't send any sort of back-up to Bond's hideout to fight off the terrorist attack.<br />11.  The villain has a limitless supply of loyal henchmen who are killed off in droves and still relentlessly pursue Bond with no cover or backup.<br />12.  The villain shows up in a military grade helicopter.  Now, he had to fly from Britain to Scotland in this.  Does Great Britain have no Air Force or flight control?  Where do you get an attack helicopter to begin with?  Where was the villain keeping this stashed the whole time?  This is a country where you can't even own a 9mm.<br /><br />Impossible.<br />1.  The two-way radio in Bond's ear work's perfectly, despite being miles underground, and separated by tons of rock and concrete.<br />2.  The whole house explodes, even the parts that weren't struck by the helicopter.  Not sure why, but it does.  I can only assume Mr. Bond left the pilot light off by accident.  Come to think of it, the carriage of the helicopter exploded too for some odd reason.  And why would an attack helicopter even explode at all?  For a machine designed to fly low into heavily armed enemy territory, it is awfully prone to spontaneous explosion when shot, killing all on board.<br />3.  While escaping down a tunnel, Bond dodges a fireball, consuming hundreds of feet of oxygen per second. (This is why I hated Independence day)<br />4.  Speaking of fire balls, Bond doesn't suffocate when the fire ball consumes all the oxygen in the tunnel.  Maybe the fireball forgot to do this.<br />5.  Bond doesn't suffer from any of the effects of hyperthermia when drowned in the ice pool.  He also doesn't think to pick up the bad guys weapon, (despite doing so repeatedly in the house) but this would have killed the clichéd foreshadowing from earlier when Bond was asked what good a knife will be.<br /><br />Okay, I am done, and don't care to write more and I am sure everyone is tired of reading. The writing in this movie is horrible and filled with holes, but the action sequences are superb, and makes for an immensely entertaining movie if you don't think too much about it.  So lay back, shut off your brain and enjoy.  Not recommended to watch with yappy wives and over opinionated best friends like myself.
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|I just dig the Avenger stuff, and this film did not disappoint. There are some disconnects with the link to Thor's universe, but just watching this group of actors makes you forget that.  Weakest character is the Hulk, but have the most humorous scene in the movie.  As always, Ironman steals the show. If you like state of the art digital effects, this flick is for you. Story line is just ok.
B004KKX814|3.0|Not for me, not much to say, they look good, pretty and good performance. Thanks. repeat, not much to say.
B004LWZWGK|3.0|Expected more as I didn't really have any idea what the plot was about before viewing.  Too long for sure, very convoluted and some &#34;don't make sense&#34; plot lines and characters.  I think producers were really stretching viewer's &#34;suspension of disbelief&#34; threshold here.  I did like the Cat(woman), but will Michael Caine just hang it up, please?  Retire to the old actor's home and have a cigar.<br /><br />Just not as good as the earlier Batman films with Bale as the lead.  Too bad. I guess we now see intro of Robin? Or different incarnation of Batman.
B008OOYALE|5.0|This is one of the few games that you can really play for free. Thanks for a fun game that allows even broke folks to progress. What a pleasant surprise.
B005LAIHY0|2.0|Yep, I bought it and regret it.  Just not a very good movie at all.  Visually, it's stunning in parts but for the most case, I can't see why this movie was made.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This game is great fun. Only downside is how addictive it is! And it truly is free (you just have to view some ads from time to time).
0316228532|1.0|I really wanted to like this book.  I was prepared to think of JK Rowling as just another author and not compare this to her Harry Potter books.  I wasn't prepared for the amount of foul language in it.  Characters toss out multiple F-bombs in casual conversation.  Other very foul words show up from time to time.  It was jarring to read with so many swear words.  Unfortunately, swear words don't make a book and adult one.  Neither does this lack-luster plot.  There aren't that many books that I haven't finished, but this is one of them.
B0036OS3Q0|2.0|I've now gotten about two weeks of use in the snow out of these boots.  They are getting the job done, but it aint pretty.<br /><br />First, the size.  I read all the reviews, and knew that they ran small; I'm a 9.5 wide and so I ordered an 11 (largest available).  The problem comes from the basic croc shape.  With classic crocs, you can slide your foot in horizontally, but with boots, you need to point your foot and wedge it forward while you place your heel.  The croc upper doesn't allow any stretch for that maneuver.  Once my foot is properly in the shoe, they fit ok--but man they are hard to get on and off.  The soft lining tends to roll under the seam as your slide you foot in, making the opening even tighter, and if you manage to get your foot in while this is happening, and take a few steps, it's going to be painful.<br /><br />Now, once you have them on properly, you go out in the snow.  Only a few inches?  Great, these are warm and have good traction, you won't have a problem.  Is the snow deep enough to cover your foot?  You might find after a few minutes that the softer area near the heel is not actually water proof.  Actually, it won't even take a few minutes, the second I had snow touching any of the non-rubbery parts of these boots, my feet were instantly cold and wet.  Another reviewer commented on this, but she used the word \\"leak\\", so I assumed there had been a hole or similar defect.  I examined my boots closely, there is no hole, no tear, no gap in the seaming.  The cloth just soaked up the moisture and transfered it directly to my socks.<br /><br />My last complaint is a small one, and in light of the other two I hesitate to even mention it.  The top part of the boot only goes about 6 inches up my leg, maybe a third of the way to my knee.  From the picture I imagined it would go at least half way, but given that it isn't water resistant, I suppose that wouldn't help anyway.<br /><br />So, even though I should have known better because other reviewers said the same things I'm saying now, I'm giving two stars only because my socks are wet and that makes me grumpy.
034580404X|5.0|the hotest books i have ever read....amazing E. L James<br />Had not read a book in 20 years because I always fell asleep reading....there is no possible way to fall asleep reading the Trilogy!!!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|My son downloaded this game on my Kindle because I was having a bad day and he thought it would make me laugh. The interpretation of the Star Wars characters by the birds is hilarious and their special powers are pretty cool.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|We all love this album from Michael Buble. My teenage daughter even loves it! He does such a wonderful job with the songs and gives an extra special feeling to listening to this Christmas music.
1400069289|5.0|Definitely one of the most unforgettable business books: There is a new story in each chapter with a new protagonist, and rarely do you have so many of them or their relatives DIE at the end of each chapter IN A BUSINESS BOOK!!!<br /><br />I couldn't think of other business books where there were so many \\"deaths\\" strategically located at the end of each chapter.  I could only think of the protagonist Nero, who died at the end of the book \\"Fooled by Randomness\\";<br /><br />So it definitely is a page turner, and it reads like a novel, but a lot more educational that that.<br /><br />I still have a sense of shock, regret or WTF moments after these sudden / tragic deaths in the stories which are supposed to be real, and I guess that's why it makes the stories so powerful and memorable.<br /><br />To conclude, the book is extremely well written: theories are simple to understand with good explanations on the experiments, but what is so different from any other business books I 've read is that the stories alone are simply unforgettable.<br /><br />For anime lovers:<br />it feels like watching the first few episodes of Sword Art Online where a new set of characters that were introduced in the previous episode would immediately die dramatically in the next episode.<br />Shocking but memorable.
B00081U7HC|5.0|It was wonderful and we really enjoyed watching it and will watch again at some point. My mother-in-law had never seen it

B000NIVJEU|5.0|Eragon....Great book in good condition as ordered. My husband  thoroughly enjoyed as part of the series he is reading. Doris Mason
B007HACDLK|5.0|Another outstanding read from Vince Flynn.  It was hard to put it down and go do other things.  Flynn shows a great knowledge of our government and how it works these days including the corruption that seems to be the usual thing these days.  Mitch Rapp may be a bit of a neanderthal to many people, but to those who value freedom and getting the job done, he's our hero.
B0071WQ7WU|5.0|it came in awesome shape. would order more from same person.got here sooner than i thought it would. thanks. peace!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
B008Q09K2U|5.0|Another great DeMille book starring the inimitable John Corey.  His witty, irreverant character is again brilliantly written  and his novels always a page turner. Can't wait for the next.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I love that this has a built in timer and that I can configure exactly the sounds I'm in the mood for.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|This was a fun movie and I thoroughly enjoyed watching it. Kindof reminded me of the movie The Royal Tanenbaums the way it was acted and narrated.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|Movie was really good and the picture quality was great. streaming from my ROKU was very easy! I would recommend this movie. It was very funny & sad and most likely true to most people that have been married for that long. something to think about when I get to be that age!
B003MC5N28|5.0|ok, so my kid is taking this in school -- and it sure makes for interesting conversation!!  loved it & would recommend it to the parents of all the kids who are reading it in school. you'd be surprised at what they are studying in grade 6!!  love what this author has done with the whole series!! :)
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a great way for me to do my daily Bible reading on a bigger screen. Love this app
B009SQRL4U|5.0|It's well animated, entertaining and has a great overall message about Christmas and family ties.<br />Good for all age groups and adults.

B009IU6N5Y|4.0|the only problems is that I can't share with my family because the digital recording does not have Spanish audio nor subtitles so this fact is forcing me to bay the actual disk instead. this is very bad

B002DJSBL6|3.0|Thought the movie was well done but just didn't care for the movie theme itself. Too many things that normal humans would question all went unnoticed by the people making it not believeable for me.

B008YWY0HK|5.0|I loved the annimation, particularly of Merida's brilliant red mop. Merida is a great role model for little girls, and you don't see that often enough. I am amazed that this movie went over so well in Scotland as the scots in the movie are steriotyped and poked fun at. But I loved it. The sets and scenery were well done as well. We saw it twice, and once again in French. It's just a fun movie.

B002RKSU3K|4.0|Certainly not heavy reading, but one of those books on my list of classics. If you enjoyed the disney movie than this book is for you.
B00280LYIC|5.0|My 8 year old daughter absolutely loved this book and could not put it down.  My 9 year old son has started it now and is also hooked.  I have to admit that I also read it and was very impressed.  They both plan to read the entire Percy Jackson series.
B000JQUHLM|4.0|Light, easy to read. One of those books I've wanted to read for years. A great filler book while you're looking for your next serious read.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|Ms. Cornwell includes a lot of technical information about forensics that slow the story and is not really necessary.  Also, there are many references to previous books that seem to be used as &#34;fillers&#34; rather than to advance the plot.
0743457900|4.0|I have said in reviewing another of his books, that my issue with Mr. le Carre is that he writes in the King's English, which I do not speak.  That said, this book has good character development, a good story, is suspenseful and is well written.
B005OZ4EVW|5.0|Incredible album, Italian, Spanish, English... you always deliver with your VOICE AND HEART! When are you coming out with another album?<br />Thanks for singing Laura
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I can't tell you if it is of high quality simply because it is still wrapped under the tree.  I can tell you it arrived quickly and in good shape :)
B005MMJ84K|5.0|I love how much Lena has grown and that no matter the horrifying events in her life she does not shut the door for love...I love distopian novels and this is one of the best you can find. I am very excited to reed the last installment, I can see how challenging it can get for Lena, especially that she will have to make a choice related to love, which is in my eyes impossible! Don't read this book before the first one, Delirium!
B009329Y30|4.0|I'm a guy who watched this because of high ratings and weekend sale price on Amazon. I liked it a lot. Zac's character offers a great demonstration of patience, perseverance and strength. If you'd like to see a good way of how to handle a bully, you'd do we'll to check out this film, for that alone. Again, nice story. Blessings
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is a must read for all Americans who want the real story behind this operation. Disregard the political spin by this administration who just sat & watched the real heroes do the job they trained for.<br />For all of my Military shipmates who conducted this operation; I offer you a hearty &#34;Bravo Zulu&#34;.
B007HACDLK|5.0|It's just another great Vince Flynn novel featuring Mitch Rapp. I can't wait for the next one to come out.

B00ABGEFWC|5.0|this game is very fun and has very cute pets. it also has fun minigames!The pets are darling and very fun to play with!!
6305657947|5.0|I am not a fan of remakes but this one is worth watching more than once! The remake is better than the original. Absolutely love the chemistry between Pierce and Rene. They are electrifying!!! Love scenes are tastefully done but very sexy. This is truly a feel good film and a fantasy. Every woman would love to fall in love with a billionaire...well maybe, lol. Not going to be a spoiler but the film has a little of everything in it as far as emotions go. Ms Russo's wardrobe is absolutely stunning and so is she. I think they both did an excellent job of acting in this film. I have both the regular dvd and blu ray...both work fine. This film was reasonably priced and the shipping time was 2 days. Can't go wrong with this one. I gave it five stars because I adore Rene Russo for one, two, the chemistry is excellent, three,  the acting is respectable, and the movie keeps you engaged. In my opinion this one is a keeper.
B005VPRDAY|5.0|My daughter loves this box of Legos, thats why it gets 5 stars.  She likes the colors included in it, and the little decorative bricks that are included as well.
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|This is one of those games they should have given up on in development phase.  It frustrates my son to no end.  The tutorial is inadequate and after a few rounds there is no way to figure out what you are doing.
1419707671|5.0|Me 7 year old loves these books! Easy to read and makes them laugh! This book inspired my girl to read so much more!

B009YU62H2|5.0|Getting together with your old band-mates is very much like getting back together with an old lover. You already know how to get each other going. You know what buttons to push to make the blood boil.<br /><br />These guys know exactly what to do to make beautiful music together.<br /><br />And, I believe, Cornell's voice gets better and better with age. If that's possible.<br /><br />Two thumbs, two fore-fingers, and two pinky-fingers raised above my head!
030759565X|5.0|My girlfriend loved this as a gift -- it has great recipes, easy to follow instructions and presents cooking in a much simpler way!
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Read this in eBook format after buying from the Kindle app.  The previous versions were bought in paperback form @ brick-and-mortar stores.  This one ups the tempo from the 2 previous versions and ties all the loose ends (i.e., &#34;All The Evil&#34;).  Engrossing till the very end...
B006ZDU7QI|5.0|I was surprized how much I really like this whole album. MPV or whatever they are called today.<br />great buy and easy to get. one click...
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This app works perfectly for me on my Kindle Fire; no problems with the time displayed or alarms. Love that my Kindle can be hibernating &amp; the alarm will still sound. Also shows the day of the week &amp; local weather. Well worth the dollar.
B00007KWHG|5.0|Bought this for my wife after we saw The Jersey Boys.  Highly recommend the show and the CD.<br />You won't be disappointed with either one.
1451695195|1.0|It's ridiculous just to think that there's a heaven.<br />It's more ridiculous to say that you've \\"seen' it, and it's beyond ridiculous to think that being \\"near death\\" would somehow validate such a claim!<br /><br />It trivializes heaven to say it can be \\"experienced\\" or \\"observed\\" by a living person.  If heaven exists at all, it would not be in the same physical dimensionality that we call space-time.  That's why we have the word \\"metaphysics\\", to describe things that are not in the physical world, i.e., not in our space-time dimensionality.  Heaven is metaphysical (again, if it exists at all).  To \\"get there\\" one must first die.  And death is an irreversible process, think of it as a \\"mini big-bang\\" that results in some aspect of us (commonly referred to as the soul) somehow \\"jumping\\" into the same metaphysical dimensionality where heaven might exist.  It's ridiculous to think that this could ever be reversible, I mean what would be the point of that?  The process of death is one-way, and irreversible.  Sometimes people claim to have been \\"brain dead\\" or \\"clinically dead\\" - this is not death - it may be \\"nearly dead\\", but \\"nearly dead\\" is not dead.  Dead is dead.  THAT SAID, it's therefore impossible for someone to say that they \\"experienced\\" or \\"observed\\"  heaven.  Heaven would be a \\"state\\" in which one exists, in that other, metaphysical dimensionality, but NOT observed or experienced since that implies brain functions we associate with being alive in our familiar space-time dimensionality.  The \\"state\\" of being in heaven, or heavenly, would have no analogy to earthly experiences, nor can we even imagine what the state of \\"heavenly\\" would be like (again, if it exists at all) since even that trivializes heaven, as does talk of \\"angels\\".  So if someone claims to have had visions of floating above pristine or majestic landscapes, while lying comatose in a hospital, you know that they weren't in heaven - regardless of whether or not the field of neurology would agree.  Neurology is a science and science deals with our physical, space-time dimensionality, not the other non-physical dimensionalities, for which we have metaphysics.  So the LAST person I'd believe who claimed to have experienced heaven is a neurologist after a coma.<br /><br />Maybe his visions occurred as he was becoming conscious, but his memory was addled and it's convenient either way to CLAIM they were during the coma, which raises the question of why do people think one needs to be in a coma or near death to be able to have such an experience?  Can't I have one just walking down the street?  Or when I'm dreaming? Or lying in bed staring at the ceiling?  Or while listening to music or making brownies in the kitchen?  Why do I have to be near death, because even \\"near death\\" is still alive so why can't I experience \\"heaven\\" while in ANY living state, but just the state that is closest to death?  I don't think the brain is even in a different state even just before death, so why would it be more prone to \\"visions\\" at that point, and why do we attach special meaning to \\"visions\\" that occur then?  In fact I can imagine the exact things that Eben Alexander envisioned when he was in his \\"coma\\" right now and I'm obviously not in a coma!  Why would a particular \\"vision\\" have a certain implication if it occurred while I was in a coma but not otherwise?  That doesn't make sense.  Why do \\"ethereal visions\\" while in a coma equate to book deal but if I have the same visions while I'm driving my car it somehow has less grandiose implications? There's really no such thing as \\"near death\\" - you're either dead or alive, even if it's not obvious.  Even if we don't actually know what the tipping point is, a person can't be both dead AND alive, which means we're either dead OR alive.  So I don't now why the claim to have such an experience is more credible because the claimant is near death.  Plus it's easy enough, to enhance the snake charming effect, to SAY that one was neardeath when that may not have been the case at all!<br /><br />Movies like \\"Heaven Can Wait\\" perpetuate an idea of heaven that's childish ( most of our ideas of heaven, and hell, are childish).  In Heaven Can Wait, a man dies at a relatively early age (mid 30's or so), goes to heaven, but convinces God to let him return to Earth to finish his life.  Now, even if the process of death WERE reversible, and you're IN HEAVEN - why would you want to return to Earth?  And do you think God would second-guess his decision that your time is up?  You think that \\"entities\\" in heaven are negotiating with God?  You think that if you had an argument with God that you'd win?  On something as big as being reborn?  Why would anyone choose such a cosmic downgrade?  The metaphysical state of \\"heavenliness\\" would far surpass any earthly pleasures, even sex - which is why I wonder why people expect to have a lot of \\"free sex\\" in heaven.  Thinking heaven is for sex is the most childish thing a person can think, and it's amazing how many adults think this.  Sex is what you do on Earth; if you want more sex, have it now, while you're alive - if you don't understand this logic you've truly missed the boat.<br /><br />If you believe what I'm saying (and of course you do), then you will also agree that hell is not fire and brimstone, since this experience would be physical and heaven and hell are both equally metaphysical, if they exist at all.  Personally, I think heaven may exist, but not hell, the two do not need to go hand in hand like Hansel and Gretel.  Hell would be punishment and what's the point of punishment if not redemption?  It's interesting how much of our adult perspective of things is based on things we learn as children, i.e., childish ideas.  Personally, I also don't believe there's a devil, which is a cartoon if ever there was one.  God \\"may\\" have existed at one time, but I don't think it's necessary that he still exists.  I don't think God is perfect (if there is or was one)nor that he is infinite, after all nothing lasts forever.  Pardon me for referring to God as \\"he\\", since God has no gender, since God is not a person, God is incorporeal, and is a metaphysical construct, which also means we weren't made in his \\"image\\", which is just more cartoonish nonsense even if there is or was a god.  It's also interesting how we associate God with Jesus, but even Jefferson claimed the two have nothing to do with each other, and I agree, although this belief of Jefferson is not as famous as his other ideas, for some reason.  It's also interesting that we wonder why God allows bad things to happen, which is really just more childish thinking, because there's really no such thing as evil, OR good, because the reason we exist is for the sake of existence itself, a bit of order amidst the chaos, and our approval of all this has not been requested.  War, Peace, Health, Disease?  You can't have one without the others so you  may as well embrace all of it with full fangs dripping!<br /><br />But one thing remains certain:  if you ever get to heaven, it is not an \\"experience\\" that can be shared with us or other occupants of space-time.  This book is obviously a gimmick and a fraud.  Of course I didn't read a single word of it, I read a review of it in Newsweek and don't need to read yet another trippy \\"account\\" of someone's \\"experience\\" with heaven. (update: shortly after posting this review I read the book, or most of it, but that didn't make a difference.) Time magazine had a similar cover story earlier this summer, which I read, and I expected it to put the heaven myth to rest - what was I thinking? - but of course these articles, and books, are always just reliable gimmicks used by publishers to exploit the gullible and magical thinking public.  [Full disclosure:  I have a B.S. in Biochemistry, which is slightly more respectable than an \\"academic neurosurgeon\\".  So you know that you can take whatever I say on faith.]
B006LS7DQE|4.0|Its runs pretty smoothly. I play this game all the time on xbox and its a real time burner.I think 3.99 was a good price for this fun game.
B006GWO5NE|1.0|I lost my original charger.  It wasn't clear from the descriptions that I would need to order both of these items.  They worked for less than a month.
B0082EOJYE|5.0|It was good, better than I expected for a black and white silent film.  Very moving and you could follow it very well.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Marvel's The Avengers (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo in Blu-ray Packaging) is a great movie. I really like it. A big fan of The Avengers.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It is easy to set up and fun to play - It  offers options for difficulty as you get better!
B0044RUSZM|4.0|This laptop stand is by no means UNstable, but it is too easy to destabilize. The two metal &#34;U&#34;s upon which the laptop will sit are held together by a clear plastic &#34;I&#34;; the &#34;U&#34; pieces fit snuggly into slots at either end of the &#34;I.&#34; Usually. And usually it's nice that it's pretty easy to assemble and disassemble the stand. The problem is, if you jostle it too hard, the stand will disassemble itself and imperil your laptop. I didn't realize that the pieces wouldn't be firmly or permanently joined. I worry about it enough to have considered using Super Glue to ensure it remains permanently assembled.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|please fix!!!!!! Fire HD will not load news feeds... cant like comments. cant comment on anything with out problems.<br />please fix
B003TNM2K6|4.0|The Mist is perfect for the connoisseur of bad, sci-fi movies. It's got that pleasantly accessible made-for-TV quality you might find in, say, the Benjamin Bratt &#34;Andromeda Strain&#34; remake, and most of the acting is, if not stellar, utterly passable. (That said, a few actors -- Marcia Gay Harden in particular, but also Thomas Jane -- bring the overall quality of acting from inoffensive to outright enjoyable.) The reasons to watch are the Stephen King plot, Harden's gorgeously campy evangelizing, and shamelessly absurd special effects. The end is almost refreshingly dark...
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|I enjoyed the storyline of the first season more. I was also confused when I watched the first episode of this season. I didn't know it would start on a completely new plot using the same characters from the first season. Overall this is a good season, you can watch season 2 without having to watch season 1.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|Getting this camera connection kit transformed my iPad into a laptop-substitute. For me, the most compelling thing about the iPad was the prospect of replacing one's laptop with the much lighter, much easier to use iPad during trips. The problem I encountered was that I invariably want to download and store photos, or share photos, during a trip. Voila! A compact, reliable, durable solution...
B009IQ0TGM|5.0|At first I wasn't sure if I would like this album, since I bought because it was on sale and I enjoyed her first album, but I love them album. It's rare that I like most of the songs on a single album, so I'd recommend this as a good buy.
B002QUWYWE|5.0|This is the kind of movie that makes you rue ever having disregarded the friend who's been telling you for years you need to see it -- and the kind that makes you run to the books section during or immediately after the film to acquire the book from which it was derived. (Stephen King!)
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This season is amazing. I really liked episode 1 of season 1 then after that I found myself not as interested in the series anymore, but I stuck with it because it seemed like it was headed in the right place and I was right! I can't wait until the mid-season break is over!
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|But definitely not the best. The visuals were pretty good and of course the gadgets were pretty cool but the audio was horrible. I hate it when the music is so loud you can't hear the dialogue.And speaking of the dialogue. Some of the lines must have been written by grade school bullies.
6305014140|5.0|The product arrived in a timely matter and I really enjoyed the movie. Even though it is a used product, the movie was free of scrathes.
B0072OFM28|5.0|This is a series that I have followed since it began on Starz a couple of years ago. I loved the first two seasons of the show. This season was very engaging and interesting for me. The characters in Spartacus are great and deep. The death of Andy Whitfield was tragic, but Liam McIntyre stepped into his shoes and filled them completely. I think it was kind of poetic actually, Andy was much more reserved and quiet which fit perfectly into the first season. In this season, the character of Spartacus needed to be a fierce leader, the much louder Liam McIntyre fit this new role perfectly. I would reccomend this series to anyone who likes to be entertained.
B004ZJZPXO|5.0|This is a must see for any fan of the scifi tv show FIREFLY.  It gives fans the much needed and deserving wrap up of the series.
B007P6PLDI|5.0|I have loved The Smashing Pumpkins for a while now. This box set is awesome and it made me love them even more. It comes with two CDs, a DVD and a cassette tape of some of Billy Corgan's very early work. The two CDs are just as great as you would expect the Pumpkins to be. I would definitely recomend this to and Pumpkins fan.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I like it, works very well and love how big it is and the percentage computing. I also like how your last calculation shows beneath.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Well, if you had a boring childhood and never read comics, this isn't for you, but I was, and I'm glad I now own this one.  More sequels tied to this movie are coming out, and I'll be buying them too.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|This is probably my favorite movie of all time. Watching it on Amazon Prime with my family was really cool too!
B005LAIHSQ|4.0|That was a great show, but as usual, Kristen Stewart still can't look anyone in the eye.  Needs acting lessons.<br />Got my movie quickly after ordered.
B000001ESF|5.0|I had to do a project on this album and when I received it. It was amazing! This Rush album is a great listen.
0525952926|5.0|Having read Fall of Giants for our book group we decided that  second installment would be perfect for our January selection and I was not disappointed ...in fact  Winter of the World more than delivered.  You can tell that a great deal of research was done by the author on the events leading to WWII and what transpired on many fronts during the war as well as much detail about the Spanish Civil War that is somewhat forgotten.  I can't wait for the third book and have recommended the series to many friends.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|I was originally skeptical about watching this movie which from the trailer seemed lime a big disappointment after the amazing UP. So I decided to watch it just because, in general I'm a big an of Pixar (cars and cars 2 the exceptions). But from the very beginning I was wowed by the amazing graphics, beautiful directing and story telling and also really surprised by the charming and engaging characters and plot. Its funny and dramatic, well paced leading to an emotional climax and contains messages that should resonate with anyone of any age.<br /><br />The soundtrack is 90% perfect, with a bit of a disappointing commercial track thrown in there but it solidifies the overall quality of the movie.<br /><br />Not quite as good as past outings from Pixar such as UP, Finding Memo or Monsters Inc but it rates highly and will not disappoint.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Not as good as the first two movies, but it was an enjoyable conclusion to the trilogy.  Check it out if you enjoyed the first two movies.
B00AE2J5HI|3.0|Prohibition sounds like a really engaging basis for a story and I was really take with the trailer.<br /><br />However Lawless doesn't really deliver on its potential. Tom Hardy's character lacks any depth and he just walks around look king tough and hardly says  word. LaBeouf ends up playing the obligatory  &#34;Hollywood&#34; role of the young hero who goes for the love against the odds and is living the dream of bettering himself and he then proceeds to irritatingly overact the rather lack luster events. The talents of Oldman are wasted on a bit part that serves no purpose whilst likewise Pearce's abilties are never exploited with  him portraying perhaps the most interesting character who is completely underdeveloped .<br />Overall the story as a few good moments that don't really go anywhere and the true story of the bootleggers of prohibition is painted as a weak backdrop and overshadowed by the contrived love story of the younger brother and the somewhat weak story of Hardy's character.<br /><br />Pace wise it doesn't really get going,the end is rushed and really leaves you feeling empty.
B008Y1YK9Y|3.0|I loved the first MIB and I really liked the second MIB.  This one was just Ok.  It did have some new characters in it, but it didn't really expand on the new characters like it could have.  That, in my opinion is the primary weakness of this third movie.  If it had developed more fully some of the scenes with the new characters in it, it would have been much more interesting and enjoyable.  As it was,  eeh-- not so much!  I probably would have wanted to have the movie and watch it no matter what anyone said about it because I am such a Tommy Lee Jones fan!!  However, that said,  now I have a movie I probably won't watch again, as opposed to the older ones which I have seen numerous times and laugh every time.  As it turns out, if this is the best they could come up with, they should have just left it at the first movie and one sequel.
B008K6HN8I|3.0|Was put on my kindle for me.  Have no idea what it does or doesn't do so not sure how to rate.
B005J4ASDG|5.0|I listen to this when I want to relax and get away from my troubles of the world! This will always be a part of my life, as it brings me countless hours of joy!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Great Book! Absolutely loved both characters and the chemistry. My heart pounding with all emotions spiraling up and down in what was going to happen next and scared of the turn out. Absolute true love!
1475143389|3.0|author explains viewpoint well but information is very repetitive and sounds like an infomercial.  &#34;My experiences equal all you need.&#34;  &#34;I'll tell you the answer to that in a minute.  But first,,,,,&#34;  &#34;Yes, you can be Mr. Muscles in no time at all.  But first,,,,&#34;<br />Didn't mind that the author treats his experiences important information.  Didn't like the feeling of being treated like an idiot or listening to a repetetive sales pitch with little scientific evidence to support the conclusion.<br /><br />Maybe good information.  Delivery is hard to endure.
0307592731|3.0|Another over rated book courtesy of Oprah Winfrey.  Oh don't get me wrong, its not horrible or anything and towards the end my curiosity was piqued.  Its just that I had to suffer through 3/4's of the book to get there.  I should probably qualify this review by saying I'm not much interested in personal stories of self discovery especially when the \\"devastating\\" events that sent Ms Stray on a downward spiral that prompted her to hike the PCT is what most of us call life. I tried hard not to roll my eyes at some of the more self centered over indulgent feelings of \\"why me\\",  that permeated the first half of the book and were scattered through out her journey like unwanted presents that we the reader didn't want to open.<br /><br />After a time I was able to discern why I didn't like this book; it was boring, plain and simply.  I was very much interested in the adventure of hiking the PCT trail and was disappointed with the lack of detail, information and first hand experiences related to that subject. Because the author undoubtedly kept a detailed journal I don't doubt her version of events or her feelings during the hiking of the trail, BUT the dialog between the uninteresting characters she met during this adventure, names names and more names, was almost laughable in its simplicity.  Since I KNOW she didn't keep the conversations, word for word in her journal she no doubt had to paraphrase these conversations.  Wouldn't this be a perfect opportunity to write some interesting fictional dialog that has no impact on her true story other than to spice up the conversation beyond the simple, \\"how are you\\", \\"I am find\\", \\"nice to meet you\\" \\"oh you too, see you up the trail\\".  I also found her carelessness and stupidity on the trail, irritating and exasperating.  Being a cute dumb blond shouldn't be sensationalized when hiking the PCT trail.<br /><br />The only real part of the story that resonated with me was the vulnerability of a women hiking on the trail alone.  Been there done that.  No man will ever understand.<br /><br />So if you are looking for a book about hiking the PCT trail, this one isn't it.  Sorry.<br /><br />PS - Since when does REI offer you 100% return and/or exchange policy when you don't actually return or exchange anything?  HMMMM.
B008HK3XOU|4.0|I got this case for my new kindle fire HD and so far its been a great case! My ONLY problem with it (which might actually be an app/Kindle Fire problem not the case) is the power port location in relation to the case. What makes sense to me is to have the side that has the power plug on it on the outside of the case so you can charge it while its in the case and still have it stand up right as its charging. Logical. However, at least with the Angry Birds Star Wars Edition, that app won't let you have the kindle whatever direction you want like most apps do. And seeing as I use that app a LOT I have to take the kindle out of the case and turn it the other way while playing it. Or I can't charge it and play with it at the same time.<br /><br />Dumb reason I know but its the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars. Great case outside of that. but if you don't play Angry Birds you're probably just fine with this case :)
030758836X|5.0|It's a phenomenon that an author can write a commercial thriller with literature level prose.  Flynn has created this novel with the powerful magnet that places the reader in the mindset of the characters and we face our darker side.  For those that loved Gone Girl this acceptance is closer to awareness than the reviewers who hated it. Those are the individuals in denial.  Flynn is illustrating the twisted combustion of Amy and Nick whose darker side is closer to the surface, and she illustrates that Rand, Marybeth and Go have buried their evil by supporting them. I could elaborate on the plot, subplot, story line and theme, but 4,000 plus reviews detail this quite well. My only annoyance with Gone Girl is several times Flynn addresses the reader on proper grammar.  (Nick and me) then she writes yes, that's proper to show us she intentionally wrote it that way, while assuring those that have always held to the belief that it should be Nick and I. She does this so we know she's aware that she's not committing a grammatical error: a trivial point, but a little distracting. .Gone Girl has become a part of my psyche and I will volley the consequence for quite some time questioning if that's a good thing. That's how it's done, darlin'.
B00068TJM6|5.0|Wonderful. Just as i expected.  Excellent watch<br />Really classy and solid. goes great with any attire.I will surely buy the gold to match
B006RXQ8RI|5.0|in my opinion this picture and of course part 2 are Quentin's masterpiece. As I said though this is just my opinion.
B00AE2IJIE|3.0|I did like the and the animation was awesome but the movie's story seemed like it didn't have anywhere to go?

B009FZHYKU|5.0|Incredible story line. Manages to keep the zombie theme going was after the whole zombie craze has moved on. Characters come and die keeping the cast fresh. A lot of jumping during this show.
B0029O08WA|5.0|This was a great soundtrack. I enjoy the movies and had to have the CDs too. This is one CD your going to want to have in your collection.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Book 5 was a relief in terms of getting more adventures involving my favorite characters which did not exist in Book 4. However there is so much bad in these books, you cannot expect to read something that warms your heart. Well, I guess it is a bit too late to complain about that having read all 5 books :)
B008JGSM6G|5.0|During this stressful time of trying to balance my life, I found this game to really relax me. Free Flow allows your brain to rest and replenish to think clear.
B0090SI42Y|2.0|\\"The Man with the Iron Fists\\" UGH O Lord, where should I begin? Let's start at the beginning, shall we? Two minutes in I was getting annoyed by the uncommitted execution of the opening scene. I won't bother with exposition, because if you've ever seen any of those old Kung-fu films, you've seen this one, only those were better-done. I actually thought I would have enjoyed this, because of Tarentino's affiliation, but, alas, no.<br /><br />I wish RZA would not have narrated or acted in this. His English pronunciation is poor and his acting skills are non-existent. I prefer to hear \\"news\\" be pronounced \\"nyoos\\" not \\"noos\\". The character names are are a study in cliche: Lady Silk; Silver; Bronze. The action scenes are a less-inspired, poorly-choreographed and executed vision of those from \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\", and the script in its entirety is mutably banal. What are fine actors like Crowe and Liu doing in a thing like this? I don't know.<br /><br />I believe this is The RZA's first attempt at directing on this scale, and I bow to him for taking on such a painstaking job and bearing his soul to daggers more of which undoubtedly this movie will recieve. He's certainly done a greater job than I could have, but it was difficult to sit through this thing without groaning, sighing, falling asleep, turning it off. -Amuse4god
B002UBRFDC|5.0|An epic novel, another page turner! On the edge of your seat, read it twice! Hope they make a movie out of this one again.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|The film was very well done, kept my interest, and was suspenseful. It  was definitely more &#34;adult&#34; than I imagined.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I can't seem to put this game down.  Its a great game for all ages. There are a lot of options to keep you interested and the game fresh.

B009FXIICK|5.0|This puzzle game is somewhat frustrating but VERY addictive. I had a great time trying to chain together as many rows and I could. Definetly worth the price!
B00A3DZ61W|4.0|I often wondered what was the big deal with these Angry Birds and what were they so angry about.  I am still not sure why they are angry, but I did find this game to be a fun time waster.  I am looking forward to the Empire Strikes Back edition.
B000UYJR7I|1.0|do not waste your money. i like Samuel Jackson but hated this movie. Save your money and buy something else
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is really fun. if you enjoy it you should try temple tun brave. you can also use a bow and arrows.
B000T9OP7G|5.0|It came in perfect condition. It came early to so i am very happy with this purchase. I would suggest my firends to but this.
B0086700CM|5.0|running away from angry monkeys is harder than one may think, you cant just run and tilt. you have to jump over tree roots and holes, you have to turn, and you have to go under obsticles. Temple run is exhilerating and addictive, after a bad run into a tree trunk, you would want to run again!
B003DTMUOE|5.0|Revise os comentarios antes de comprar este libro. Vi que muchas personas lo describian como una joya. Lo compre por curiosidad y despues de leerlo realmente puedo asegurar que si lo es.
B00003CXMG|5.0|I love how Cameron Crowe related his experiences as a journalist through William and all of the other characters.  It is tasteful and true to point
B003IDMUWC|5.0|This is John Grisham at his best.<br />It was his first novel and certianly the diamond!<br /><br />It is spell bounding
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|While at times it seemed very predictable, it would throw you for a loop to wrangle you back in.  Nicely done
B00AA7O6QC|4.0|Overall the movie is corney but good. The actors make the movie. Fun to watch. Glad I didn't purchase the movie on DVD Ok to rent..
B00AE2LJVS|4.0|Very good on the historical aspects, you can just tell that they were from a HollyWood stand point.  All of the actors and actresses were amazing
B004I744AS|5.0|I love how this app has very good sized font and is so easy to use. especially on a kindle fire! the best part is that its free!!!!! i would reccomend this app to anyone looking for an easy to use dictionary. ;)
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|It is a great version of Angry Birds, just a bit harder it seems to me.  I like it and my kids love the different seasons.  Just hard for them to get all the pigs.
B009WJ44KC|5.0|I saw John Williams conduct the San Diego Symphony last night, I was so impressed with his selection from this score that I went and saw the movie today. As soon as I got home I downloaded the entire album. I have been a lifelong fan of Mr. Williams' brillant work. Seeing him conduct some of his greatest hits was a dream come true!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This is a fantastic clock and radio for the kindle fire!  I recommend it if you need an alarm clock on the road.
B00A2IUDO8|5.0|This movie makes me laugh everytime I watch it.  Seth MacFarlane is hilarious.  Anyone who watches and likes Family Guy will love Ted.
B007Z9QWVK|4.0|I only heard derisive comments about this movie - but just watched it and it is lovely.  Beautifully shot and- incredible scene s and costumes, very very good acting, charismatic performances.  Give it a go, especially if you enjoy the royal family sub genre.
B00A12VW86|3.0|No major hits off this one...a few good songs. Nothing will wow you on here like their past albums but if you're a huge fan like myself it's worth a listen.
B008Y7Y0AM|4.0|MDB is one of my favorite bands and &#34;A Map of All Our Failures&#34; does not disappoint. It has all the elements that fans have come to expect from a MBD album. Better than &#34;For the Lies I Sire&#34; but not as good as &#34;A Line of Deathless Kings&#34;. Well at least in my eyes, or should I say ears.<br /><br />The guitar tones and riffs on some of the songs come across as almost &#34;grungish&#34;. Sort of Sound Garden/ Alice In Chains like. A bit odd to hear at times, but they still make it work. In fact I like to think of grunge as domm's slightly less depressed, more pissy little brother.<br /><br />Over all, a good album. Not their best. It strays into the areas of cliche a few times, but doesn't stay long. But still a solid effort.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I just couldn't wait until this app came to Kindle Fire. This is my FAVORITE game in FaceBook and now I can take it with me wherever I go!!
B005R32L66|5.0|My family and I use Skype daily. Very easy to download and use. Highly recommended you give it a try.
B0096DFBZQ|1.0|Too hard to work on the Kindle. Kept running into the walls and over the grass. Not as fun as I had hoped.
B0045TYDNC|5.0|I picked this up to replace the junky soft plastic cap that came with the kit lens.  This bolts right up to my Nikon lenses and has a nice snug fit.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Not much character development in the first book.  Read it because of all the hype; shocked that my book club ladies read this - think I'm glad to have missed that debrief.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|I felt tired after forcing myself to follow the hard to follow storyline.  it is almost like the director and editors think that everyone is a Batman freak fan and memorized all the plots from the past.  The introduction of new characters is not thorough and assumes that all the viewers did online research ahead of time.<br /><br />seems the story was patched together by an amateur.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I really debated reading the second book after being disappointed with the first, but decided to go forward.  This third book was about par with the second book, so better than the first.  I've spent time more mentally and emotionally stimulated, but I was curious to see how things would progress/end in this book.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I LOVE this workout!  This is my first Jillian workout and definitely won't be my last.  I love her no-nonsense style and she is great at showing proper form and explaining how to do the exercises.  I love that she makes you do enough to really work you hard and I love the 3-2-1 system with the weights, cardio, abs!  This is one of the few workouts I have done that is less than 30 minutes, but feels like a 60 minute workout!  If you want a quick workout that gets results, this is it.  As the workouts got easier, I started doing two of the workouts in one day - one in the morning and one at night - levels 2 and 3 are my favorite as level 1 seems too easy now.  I broke a plateau and lost 10 pounds with 30 day shred and also her banish fat boost metabolism dvd.  THANK YOU JILLIAN!!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|More substance than the first book; more character development which I appreciated.  The sex in the book actually gets old.  I read through, but some friends reported just skipping over those parts.
B009329Y30|5.0|Wonderfully touching movie! Very romantic, makes a wonderful night with your one and only. I loved it! Definitely recommend it!
B007KOMTUI|5.0|I couldn't wait for Season 5 to come out for free on Netflix.  I had to buy.  Now I can't wait for Season 6.  The purchase was easy and instant. I love AMAZON...
B002W5UVSM|5.0|The story behind this novel is intriguing. [...] This novel won the Pulitzer Price for Fiction in 1981, and is now being made into a movie (Fall of 2012) with Zack Galafianakis reputed to play the lead character, Ignatius.<br /><br />Published 11 years after the author's suicide, it is considered a major Southern novel for the time period.  If you think you know New Orleans from visits to the French Quarter during Mardi Gras, please read this novel.<br /><br />As this is about to become a major motion picture, now is a great time to read this timeless novel.  At a minimum it makes for an interesting and fun novel.  At its best it is a colorful and many say accurate depiction of New Orleans and many of the the unique personalities living there in the 1960's.
0385474547|5.0|This is the book for anybody that loves good story. I have lived some of the life in the book and it makes it even more real reading it again after 30 years.
0887431453|4.0|Good size, bright colors, lots of fun things for my preschooler to do to make her feel like a big girl while her big brothers do their school work too.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|excellent movie, amazing animation, beautiful colors and  what a story it relates beautifuly the relationship of mother-child, very emotional, it made  me  cry, beautiful movie, a piece of art, !!!
B009UKUGXC|5.0|Reading this book for the third time - great piece of entertainment,and all from the world of numbers, amazing stuff
B009LREA1S|2.0|I am rating poorly based on the quality of the HD delivery of this instant video. It may be my connection although I am on a high speed cable connection getting an average of 21.99 Mbps download speeds. The amazon instant video app on my xbox 360 stopped playback twice while watching. The picture was very dark to the point where it was unwatchable at times. I am sorry I purchased this in favor of the blu-ray just for the convenience of having it instantly. I knew the quality wouldn't be blu-ray quality, but it should be better and be distinguishably different than the SD version.<br /><br />The movie itself is very well done. I didn't find it as action packed as The Dark Knight but I was happy with the way they chose to end this last chapter in the Christopher Nolan series.<br /><br />Now that I own it, maybe playback will be improved. I bet it will look better on the Kindle Fire or my iPad with the smaller screen. I had the same issue when purchasing Dexter Season Six. Ended up watching that on the kindle fire which was more enjoyable than on a 46\\" 1080p television. But I should have just purchased the SD versions of both.
B005KDWUFA|4.0|These guys have fantastic voices, look great and give popular songs the Pop-Opera treatment, and sound incredible in an arena/stadium. Nothing new here. Same extremely high standard. Simon Cowell's greatest success.(One Direction is for the tweenies, not us adults).
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Although im i fan of zombie stories, they mostly revolve around individuals. This idea of examining the disaster as a post end analysis  for many different points of view, gives a view of survival of both the individual and all of the earth.
B008RZF1UO|5.0|LOVE this album! And the special edition is a fan's dream grab-bag. Very high quality on every piece of this set, but the music is still the best part. Didn't leave my player for several weeks. Tommy is a PERFECT fit for vocals, both studio and live! He dominates this album, as well as the stage.
B0050ZPAPA|5.0|Loved this book.  I'm a Jim Butcher fan, but there are a few niggly problems that always stop me giving his books that final 5th star.  Not so with Kevin Hearne; he has the balance of believable action and character interaction just perfect.  There is more world-building than character development in this book, but that is usually the way in the first book in a series, I'm looking forward to seeing the development in the rest of the series.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great selection of translations, and works across multiple platforms!  Very easy to use, and has excellent daily reading plans.  Highly recommended.
B0071DJZZA|4.0|A well paced novel with interesting characters. Though much of the story seems a little too convenient; perhaps a bit over-contrived, though most YA readers won't mind that.
B00926J3K6|3.0|KING CRIMSON IS ONE OF MY FAVOURITE BANDS, BUT THIS BOX HAS 7-8 CDS OF \\"HISTORICAL\\" MATERIAL \\"CASSETTE BOOTLEG\\" QUALITY ONLY FOR FANS, AND THE PRIZE IS TOO HIGH FOR THIS KIND OF STUFF (EVEN IF AMAZON USA HAD THE LOWEST). THE REST IS REALLY GREAT, WITHOUT ANY DOUBT.
B005EGXTHG|3.0|I was a little dissappointed with this book.  It felt more like another version of the 1st book, and didn't really take the series anywhere it hadn't been before.  Though well written and well paced it just seems like an unneccessary addition to the series.
B007FZ7R7W|5.0|I really love this album. I've bought 4-5 albums since I bought this one and it's still the CD I listen to when I'm in the car. I never get sick of it. I think it's a good blend of hip hop and r&b songs. I was going to do a  1-5 star rating on each song but it would just be quicker to say that they are all 5/5 except maybe Don't Wake Me Up. At first the auto tune on that song drove me crazy. He has such a great voice, I wish he wouldn't use auto tune. But the song is growing on me.<br /><br />My favorite songs are Bassline, Don't Judge Me, 2012, Biggest Fan, Sweet Love, Strip, Stuck on Stupid, 4 Years Old, Trumpet Lights, Tell Somebody, Free Run.<br /><br />And on a side note... I can't even tell you how much it drives me crazy that people rate Chris Brown's music on his past or him as a person. Grow up.
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|I am a huge fan of the first album and the follow up did not dissapoint.  Great band, great album.
B008NABUU8|4.0|Pretty fun puzzle game that works well. I passed off all of the levels quickly and wouldn't mind more. If it had more levels it would be a five star.
B000YHG72E|5.0|loved the movie. great movie to watch with<br />children this holiday season. will ferrell did a great job, very sincere.
B005CA4SQK|5.0|This is one of my favorite TV series ever. Great story that is entertaining, suspenseful, and makes you want more. The Blue-Ray is top notch and looks great on my HDTV. The special features are interesting but nothing special but they still add to the package.
B001O9BB3G|3.0|This is a wonderful story with beautiful character development and back stories but just as the story gets to where you want it, it ends! I want more!
0345803485|5.0|I see a lot of bad reviews on this book. But what can you say? The only time people want to take a moment out of their day to write a review...is when it's a bad one. Anyways, I fell in love with this book. I didn't find any parts annoying like most people have. And to be honest, I have been in the same sort of situation (without the BDSM) and found my prince, who is now my husband. This book is probably one of the best love stories that I've read and I can't wait for the movie. I heard so much about this book and all the good things about it and I must say that it lived up to its reputation. Bravo E.L. James! Keep them coming!

B009LDD54K|4.0|I decided to adapt the tag line for this season of Boardwalk Empire as the title of my review because I felt it was so appropriate for what was right and wrong with season 3 of Boardwalk Empire.  The show is at its best (and it is a riveting best) when it focuses on what the show is supposed to be about...gangsters and corrupt politicians jockeying for power, money, turf, and prestige in Prohibition-era America.  The show falters --significantly-- when it tries to be other things, namely...<br /><br />&lt;spoilers><br /><br />An exploration about how hard it was to get proper prenatal care for women in that era.  I know that the struggle to get proper education about birth control and how to manage a pregnancy may have been happening in the Prohibition era, and I salute the women and men who led the fight to get that education out there.  But it TOTALLY did not belong as a significant story in Boardwalk Empire.  I found myself fast-forwarding my Tivo whenever Margaret's character was visiting the hospital or giving classes.  It was totally disconnected from what the other characters were all doing in the series.<br /><br />I'm actually starting to dislike Margaret's character overall and I found myself sort of wishing Nucky had killed her or discarded her when he found out she had been playing around with Owen Sleater.  I liked her fine in season one and some in season 2.  But she's getting a bit tiresome with her holier than thou attitude.  Besides, did the character seriously think she was going to be trading up by going with Sleater?  The man was a former terrorist, a gangster, and someone capable of strangling someone with piano wire.  Oh, and while he was canoodling with Margaret, he was also bedding one of the Thompson household maids ... which is something Margaret knew about.  Given that the show made a point of emphasizing how \\"shrewd\\" and self-taught she was, she comes across as a bit of an idiot.<br /><br />I hope in season 4, Margaret either reconciles with Nucky and comes back to him and perhaps even becomes an active participant (consigliere of sorts) or the character gets written out...one way or another.<br /><br />There are some other flaws with season 3 besides the \\"Margaret Problem.\\"  I liked the actor who played Gyp Rosetti and I thought he was a pretty good villain. But they overplayed his uncontrollable violence.  I find it hard to believe a criminal who had so little control over his impulses to violence would rise very high as a gangster.  I could see him as a hitman or enforcer, but never as a boss.<br /><br />I also have to gig Boardwalk Empire for leaving a couple of things rather unexplained (at least at the close of season 3):<br /><br />1.  Nelson Van Alden's character and his \\"nanny\\" somehow seems to have gotten an upgrade where suddenly she's his wife.  It would have been nice if there had been a bit of back story to that.  I actually rather like the character of the wife, and I hope we see more of VanAlden as well as the Dion O'Bannion character who might become his boss.<br /><br />2.  Another thing that I would have liked explained was why Capone came riding to the rescue of Nucky Thompson (which was done in a fantastic way).  Eli supposedly made a \\"deal\\" with Capone to do this, but couldn't they have given a line of dialogue explaining why Capone would have come all the way from Chicago to do this?<br /><br />Now as for the good parts:<br /><br />1.  I thought they did a good job tying Chalky White's character and criminal operation into the main story arcs.<br /><br />2.  Arnold Rothstein and Masseria both come across serious potential opponents/sparring partners/partners for Nucky Thompson.  I hope we see more of Masseria next season in particular.<br /><br />3.  The last three episodes were great when the series pretty much focused on the power struggle between Nucky and Rosetti.<br /><br />4.  Gillian Darmody's character continues to develop as an unbelievably twisted and evil but also pathetic character.  I was truly taken by surprise by the ultimate fate of the young man who had a passing resemblance to her murdered son she had taken as a lover.<br /><br />5.  I thought the rehabilitation of Eli Thompson as a major partner of Nucky was done well and was believable.  And the episode that focused mostly on the home life of the principal characters had some good scenes with Nucky and his brother.<br /><br />It'll be interesting to see what season 4 brings us.  I really hope the Margaret character is either brought more into the storyline (like Chalky) or she's gone ... one way or another.  We'll see.  I just hope they keep the story focused on what's made Boardwalk Empire so compelling these past three years...murder, corruption, bootlegging, etc and not soap opera elements and women's health issues.etic character.

030796664X|3.0|I would say this book is about 90% anecdotes and 10% theory. The anecdotes are very interesting and illustrate the theories well, but it does feel like the author was stretching things out. As mentioned by others, there is also little in the way in how to apply the theories to one's own life. In all, a very interesting topic but you won't find all the answers you wanted in here.<br />I listened to the audio version, which was a laugh. The reader felt he had to do voices when characters were talking during the anecdotes. Most of the males sounded like Goofy, and all the women sounded like timid little mice. Ha ha!
B007OWRBJK|5.0|you don't need to know everything about who to read this book, he explained it all, it's easy to follow and you learn a lot about his and the whole band.
1452101426|5.0|As amazing as the movie itself, The Art of Brave is a gorgeous artbook full of production notes, inside goodies on how they created the look of the film, and beautiful artwork including original sketches and designs, breathtaking backdrops, and concept designs. This Art of book does not disappoint!

B00AHSIQWE|4.0|I did enjoy this movie, but it was my least favorite of the C. Nolan trilogy. Perhaps if I'd read the comic books I'd have a better appreciation of the grimness.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|I loved the book because I've had four bouts of cancer. I think the key is my lack of self love - I can love everyone else but myself. I think that was her biggest lesson too.  I never went though all the discrimination of women like she did but had a mother who was never pleased with anything I did. Even though my high school boyfriend tells me there wasn't a guy who didn't want to date me - not just because I was beautiful but also intelligent.  I had no clue. I thought I was just another mediocre chick and had no self esteem and obviously a negative self image..... The book helped me to realize that I'm on the right track now with meditations and affirmative prayer. I'm working on becoming a chaplain in my faith to get out of the bad stuff in my head and into the good stuff in my heart. And this book confirmed what my meditations  have told me......
0316069434|4.0|I loved Harry in this book, the way the reader gets into his heart and soul. The mystery aspect of this book was only so-so. I figured out the killer right away, but Harry is such an endearing character that he carries a weak mystery like a champ. What really drew me into this one was Harry's tenacity to see to it that he did right by a murder victim who didn't receive the attention she deserved at the time of her death. Twenty years is a long time, but he still nails it.

B004J64QSI|5.0|This is an excellent rendition of Victor Hugo's novel as a musical presentation.  It captures the spirit and imagination of this beautiful story of courage and commitment.  It is a 25th anniversary celebration at London's O2 facility and all of the music is included;  performers are in costume and the sets are very well done.  Be aware that this is not the &#34;full Broadway show&#34;, but I was transported while watching the DVD;  one important advantage is that you can view the performers &#34;close-up&#34; which reveals the emotion and passion on their faces as they perform.  Alfie Boe is magnificent and is perhaps the consumate Jean Valjean among the four actors who have embraced this role.  The 25th anniversary edition also features all four after the end of the performance and includes other principals who made the Les Miserables stage production possible.  If you are a fan of Les Mis, don't miss this production!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Wonderfully written book, looking forward to the second one in the trilogy. Follett writes in exquisite detail, which at times makes the characters a little hard to follow, but one of the pluses is there aren't hoards of secondary characters which make some historical novels difficult to read.<br />this period in history was characterized by mindless brutality on the part of all the governments, (They all used Gas in the war!) and a huge chasm between the wealthy landed gentry and everyone else./ It's not surprising that socialism and communism became popular among the working classes throughout Europe.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|I've watched this movie twice in the last 24 hours. Which means I've spent 18 hours doing something else. At a near 3-hour clip, this movie is one of the lengthier ones you'll come across.<br /><br />And that's probably my only criticism. There are a couple situations where the movie drags. Some scenes could have been cut to keep the movie flowing a little faster and shorten the run time. Keep in mind Batman isn't a drama. There isn't a need to slow things down and be overly dramatic.<br /><br />Overall, The Dark Knight Rises fits into the Christopher Nolan trilogy very nicely. The plot is creative, it ties into the larger trilogy story line and there's a twist, just like the other two.<br /><br />I thought the price-to-value ratio was ok. It's much cheaper than going to the theater, but more expensive than RedBox. With a rental kiosk on every corner, the value play becomes availability and effort of acquisition. When my wife decided we should watch a movie at 11 PM, leaving the house to get something wasn't an option. Add in Amazon's good HD streaming and picture quality really isn't a trade-off.
0307730697|5.0|Eric Blehm's \\"Fearless: The Undaunted Courage and Ultimate Sacrifice of Navy SEAL Team SIX Operator Adam Brown\\" isn't your typical Navy SEAL story.  Blehm wrote this book because, on his casualty assistance form (to be used to grant his last wishes if he ever died), Adam Brown asked that his story - his whole story - be told.<br /><br />And Adam Brown's story is different.  Adam Brown was lucky to be accepted into the Navy, let alone SEAL training, because of his troubled past.  Although gifted in high school in small-town Arkansas, Adam wandered aimlessly after high school and eventually became a drug addict.  After brushes with the law and spending time in jail (his parents had to call the police) and in a rehab program, Adam's parents started attending church for the first time in their adult lives.  After his parents were saved and asked their church to pray for him and their preacher to visit him in jail, Adam too accepted Jesus Christ into his life.<br /><br />This truly changed Adam.  He met a girl with similar faith and was determined to make something of himself.  He was able to join the Navy only after getting a waiver from the USN captain who commanded the entire recruiting district - a high school friend's father who could vouch for the kid that he used to be.  Despite his past, Adam - who suffering debilitating training injuries to his eye and hand - applied for and made the SEALs and eventually SEAL Team Six.<br /><br />The book then recounts Adam's SEAL career, with deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan, his family life (with a dedicated wife and two children), the camaraderie of his fellow SEALs, and finally his last mission.  Adam's story is inspiring, uplifting, and heartbreaking - but one that everyone should know.
B009KHDT0C|2.0|This was not one of Tim Burton's best. Admittedly, I'm not a fan of recent revivals of old films and series that are basically comedic takes on the original subjects. A revived &#34;Dark Shadows&#34; could be a great series, or even a mini-series (heck, there was a good mini-series a few years back), but you simply can't squeeze anything of consequence from the hundreds of hours of the series into a sub-two-hour movie. Whole parts of the story line just don't make sense. Admittedly, there are a few well delivered lines that will make you chuckle (with Johnny Depp, how could you expect otherwise), but over all, as said in the header of the review, the best parts were in the previews. Stream it for a couple bucks if you're simply curious, but don't expect much. It won't be added to my collection.
B001OKGN2E|5.0|It is an action movie with a powerful story behind it. I know that I will watch this movie again and again in the future. I wish they would make more films this way.

0307341550|4.0|I know I'm kind of on a psychological thriller kick, with Gone Girl, The Trajectory of Dreams, and now Sharp Objects by Gillian Flynn, but I can't help myself!<br /><br />Sharp Objects by Gillian Flynn is the author's first novel.  Camille is a reporter who moved to Chicago and away from her tiny hometown.  However, after being recently released from a rehabilitation center for doing some damage to her body, she is being shuttled back home in order to investigate the murder of one and disappearance of another young girl.<br /><br />Camille is trying to get her big journalism break while still working to survive being back home with a slightly \\"off\\" mother, a 13 year old sister that she doesn't even know (and who has some \\"offness\\" about herself as well), and a stepdad who doesn't ever speak to her.<br /><br />Gillian Flynn leaves you guessing in another one of her psychological thrillers.<br /><br />I enjoyed Sharp Objects and the craziness that went along with both the characters and the story line.  I figured out pieces, got confused, then figured more out, then was wrong, and so on.<br /><br />But I loved Gone Girl.  I loved being lied to, all the twists and turns, and the psychotic ending.  Sharp Objects has a psychotic ending, too, but Gone Girl was just a more impactful book overall.<br /><br />Come on guys, give me another psychological thriller to add to my list!<br /><br />Thanks for reading,<br /><br />Rebecca @ Love at First Book
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I have been a Taylor Swift fan since her first album. I have all four albums of hers, and I especially love listening to them chronologically to \\"grow up\\" with her all over again as well as listen to how her sound has changed over the years. Red is by far my favorite album of the four. She has improved her lyrics and taken risks with the sounds, and it all meshes together so perfectly--rock to pop to country and pretty much every mix in between.<br /><br />My favorite songs are Treacherous, All Too Well, State of Grace, and Everything Has Changed, but I don't skip any songs when I play through this album. For those who prefer country, you'd probably enjoy Stay Stay Stay and Begin Again the most. Her pop songs, I Knew You Were Trouble, 22, and We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together, are super fun even though they are highly radio friendly. The slower songs on the album are The Last Time and Sad Beautiful Tragic. All Too Well has the richest lyrics, in my opinion. There is a song for anyone on Red.<br /><br />Taylor Swift can do whatever she wants, and I'm super pleased that she branched out from her original sound and created something amazing and refreshing. I'm sure I would have remained a fan even if she had stayed country, but I absolutely love this new direction! I highly recommend this album.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I have loved Star Wars since seeing it back in the 70's.  This game is fun to play.  I had to stop playing the first time I tried it because my Kindle Fire battery needed to be charged.  I love how the characters are integrated into the Andry Birds world.  My favorite so far is that the Luke Angry Bird has lightsaber capabilities (after passing a certain level).  My kids (who have not seen the movies yet)  also love playing the game.  They are 6 and 4 making this fun for everyone.  My husband, who is not a huge fan of the movies enjoys the game too.

B001M5UDGS|4.0|Co-worker told me about how Nathan & Joss get together for another project (Long live Firefly), only to find out there is a great cast that make this movie magic.<br /><br />The 43-minute musical/movie felt longer than it really was...in a good way. I didn't want to music to end and was in awe of the talent of the Whedon's and their friends.<br /><br />The DVD I got from Netflix said it was Not Rated. Well, if it wasn't for plenty of innuendos and direct references to a man's nether regions (not sure what Amazon may censor here), I would have liked to share this with my kids, but unfortunately have to pass.<br /><br />Yes, you could go watch this on YouTube for free. But, you'd miss so much and the special feature interviews are great.<br /><br />Best part is this project bypassed the BIG movie companies and was given to the public. Quality story telling and entertainment without relying on big-budget effects and a shallow story. Priceless!<br /><br />The end is thought provoking, but I think it was appropriate.<br />Regardless, the music will stick in your head and you'll have to get your hands on the soundtrack next!!<br /><br />Worth a watch!

1469984202|5.0|There is nothing I could say that hasn't been said by many of my fellow reviewers of Hugh Howey's \\"Wool\\", so I'll keep it brief: My mind went into the silo and the air locks closed shut behind me. I was in there, experiencing it, smelling it, tasting it. I think my legs even hurt from going all the way to the down deep and back up-top several times over. I can see why Ridley Scott wants to make a movie out of it. It already is one. Hugh Howey created a world desperate and hopeful at once, where both lie so close to each other, I found myself thinking that it was a perfect rendition of the world we live in now (I'm wondering when the iPhone screen size will become 2 by 8 inches). I loved the double twists about what's real and what's fabricated; the sheer physical depth of the silo mirroring the depth of despair and hope of its occupants. And as the silo itself, the story goes deeper and deeper with every round, every chapter. Great work, Hugh!

I see a lot of die-hards on here who are bitter that their band didn't stick to writing the same album over and over.  Don't listen to them.  If you're a fan of great progessive hard-rock (I wouldn't even really call this metal) pick this album up.  You don't be dissapointed.  There's a reason it's on most 'best-of' lists of 2012.

B00913P6G0|3.0|The new record from the latest, greatest thing in commercial hip-hop, titled good kid, m.A.A.d city, comes to us via Dr. Dre's latest prodigy, Compton emcee Kendrick Lamar. Like the last three artists who received the big mainstream plug from Dre - Snoop Dogg, Eminem and 50 Cent - Lamar arrives with a record that everyone in the music industry was talking about long before it was released. The album sold well its first week, taking the No. 2 spot on the Billboard chart, selling a stellar 242,000 copies in seven days, making it the highest earning album of 2012 from a male hip-hop artist (as well as the best-selling debut record from a male artist). Truth is, good kid - supposedly a concept album, by the way - isn't Lamar's debut record. It was a record called Section.80, released during the summer of 2011, that broke Lamar to the hip-hop world. Said album, despite being a self-released debut, featured RZA, J. Cole, Ab-Soul and quite a few then-more successful modern emcees and producers. So, needless to say, the industry believes in Kendrick Lamar, and did before the doctor came along with his wet stamp.<br /><br />So how about the record itself? The grand concept album in question? Well, it's alright. I'll say this: it's an impressive effort. It's a long, detailed, labored-over disc that feels very much like an experience. Lamar's rhyme style, while certainly hard-earned, is a little too derivative of the post-Lil' Wayne hip-hop world that this writer tends to stay as far as possible away from. That said, Lamar does jump around a bit, vocally, reminding of, say, an ATLiens-era Big Boi on \\"The Art of Peer Pressure,\\" or, naturally, Lil' Wayne on the track \\"Backstreet Freestyle.\\" One of the record's best moments, \\"Good Kid,\\" sees Lamar really rapping, writing around a beat, challenging himself to meld his vocals into the accompaniment in a way he often seems to have no interest in. It's an impressive cut that features thoughtful lyrics and the best Pharrell-produced beat in years. Lamar's vocal style here and elsewhere on the record could be described as nasally and pseudo-staccato, with no trace of the love for funk and soul music Snoop made so many of us think of when the words \\"Dre\\" and \\"protege\\" end up in the same sentence.<br /><br />The production throughout good kid, though handled by 12 different producers, adds up to a surprisingly cohesive piece of music. Lamar has selected his accompaniments wisely, picking beats that allow him to utilize his many different voices. One track, titled \\"Sing About Me, I'm Dying of Thirst,\\" is a modern hip-hop epic. Clocking in at over 12 minutes, Lamar tells a long, twisting story over two beats that - while quiet different - work well together a conceptual piece. Ending the track is one of the many dialogue samples that tie the record together and have writers and fans using the word \\"concept.\\" I'm not sold. Sure, there are some clear themes here, but what young emcee from Compton isn't writing about being a young emcee from Compton when they get in the studio?<br /><br />Some critics and deejay's will tell you that good kid paints a picture of downtrodden Los Angeles in a manner similar to how Nas so beautifully documented the poverty class of early 90s Queens - but not me. Lamar is clearly an ambitious young artist, sure, but hardly worthy of the No. 2 spot it currently holds on MetaCritics list for Best Reviewed Albums of 2012. If you go into this perfectly decent collection of hip-hop tracks expecting a classic or a landmark on par with Nas' vivid, documentary-like Illmatic, I'm afraid you'll be very much let down. So what is good kid, m.A.A.d city if not the new rap classic everyone seems to be hailing it as? Well, it's an album with a terrible title, interesting cover art and a whole lot of promising moments. I'd like to see Lamar develop his rhyme style a whole lot more, drop the exhausting filler bits (i.e. all those lengthy dialogue samples) and maybe select some more organically-produced backdrops. All that said, the kid made a pretty decent record that, considering it exists at the highest level of commercial hip-hop, is marvelously creative.<br /><br />Read more of my music and film writing at ZeCatalist.com.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|The book is a fairly decent page-turner, but kinda takes an unexpected left turn in the middle, which kinda throws off the momentum of the book.  Otherwise a decent read.
B009DQQF7Y|4.0|I was a college freshman working at the WIUX radio station in Bloomington, Indiana when I first heard Montreal-based post-rock band Godspeed You! Black Emperor. I'd been called into the station to sub for a 2-4 a.m. shift and, when I arrived, the DJ was laying on the floor in his pajamas while a 23-minute track called \\"Sleep: Murray Ostril\\" spilled from the speakers. While planning out my set in the station's vinyl library, I heard the song rise and fall, crash and hum, then eventually, finally, end. After a few moments of awkward silence the DJ came to (woke up), talking groggily over the air about how he had mapped out the song - and it's record, Life Your Skinny Fists Like Antennas to Heaven - on graphic paper, noting the various movements. I, of course, had no idea what he was talking about. And when I asked him later about his statements he assured me that he only played the song because it was 23 minutes long and he wanted to take a nap while it played. Regardless, I bought Skinny Fists the next weekend and played it daily through the fall season, never once pretending to map anything out on graphing paper. I've been a fan ever since, even buying quite a few of the band's very worthwhile side projects, including the excellent releases from band leader Efrim Manuck's \\"other\\" project, A Silver Mt. Zion (now known as Thee Silver Mt. Zion).<br /><br />If you're not familiar with Efrim, GSYBE or their legendary catalog (yeah, I said it), I'd suggest you take the time to listen to one of the band's records before making a purchase. Maybe start with 2002's Yanqui U.X.O., their most accessible record. Essentially, GSYBE is a politically-fueled collective of top shelf musicians who play drone-y instrumental rock. Long, complicated tracks that feature a lot of electric guitars, keyboards, string arrangements, vocal samples, vibraphones, dulcimers and other cute instruments that few rock bands use in today's garage rock-obsessed era. Guitars, mostly. Howling ones that sometimes sound like an army. It's music that's hard to describe unless you know a whole lot about classical composition language, scales, rhythms and all that mysterious stuff that so few critics can speak on with any expertise. While a fan of Mogwai, Do Make Say Think, Pelican or Explosions in the Sky will probably enjoy the music of GSYBE, I wouldn't really compare any of those bands to the big sound of a God's Pee record. The Montreal boys are more epic, more organic, more inspired by classical composition, politics and cinema. They're more visual, more perfect, less precious. Truthfully, their work - especially on this new record - is more similar to Sigur Ros records like ( ) and this year's great Valtari than anything else I've heard.<br /><br />'Allelujah!Don't Bend! Ascend!, the bands fourth full-length since 1998 and first LP in 10 years is, to these ears, a truly great one. Maybe the band's best and easily one of 2012's most impressive releases. I bought the LP, which separates the bulk of the album into two parts: a 12\\" LP featuring two 20-minute tracks; and a 7\\" record featuring two six-minute drone compositions. Along with the music you get some artwork in the form of a collection of artfully burned 16 mm frames. The record comes in full-color gatefold packaging - heavy and crisp, a great all around set. But it's the music we're here for, right? The 52 or so minutes of carefully crafted swells and blasts. The big guitars and careful strings. One minute \\"Mladic\\", the album opener, will be rocking - full-blown rocking; the next it's drone-y and slight. Later things get cinematic, the band sounding like the perfect accompaniment for a new David Lynch film. It's impressive stuff. Where the longer tracks on Raise Your Skinny Fists felt more like segueing collections of shorter ideas, the two epic tracks on 'Allelujah! feel very much like complete, cohesive compositions. And the two shorter drone tracks? Easily two of my favorite new pieces of music this year.They're soft and deeply detailed and eerie - just how I like 'em.<br /><br />I wonder, sometimes, what that little radio DJ dweeb with the jammies is up to these days. Maybe telling women about the many nuances of the complex design of the Burj Khalifa. Or maybe doing sleep studies in good 'ol Bloomington, Indiana. Either way, I'm forever grateful for his pretentious, sleepy spirit, as the Godspeed You! Black Emperor discography holds a special spot in my collection. And this 'Allelujah! Don't Bed! Ascend! disc? Well, I think it's their best work yet, and one of the most involving, interesting releases of the year.<br /><br />Read more of my music and film writing at ZeCatalist.com.
B0029QRA1U|1.0|About 4 months after I purchased this, I began having problems with the tone arm resetting itself every time I wanted to play a record.  I called customer service about this and after a long wait to speak to someone, I was finally told to turn the record counter-clockwise 5 times and then it should work just fine.  What they didn't tell me is that I have to do this almost every single time I remove the tone arm from the cradle.  After getting fed up with this, I called back a few weeks later wanting a more permanent fix.  They said that there is not one and sent me an email on how to contact one of their seven approved service centers in North America and said that the warranty is only 90 days so I have to cover 100% of the cost to have it sent off and repaired.  Doing some more research, I am finding this is a very common problem with these turntables and you would be wise to spend your money on a different brand.  Poorly built product and even worse customer service.
B00908DDZM|4.0|While living in Seattle I saw with my own eyes how many, if not all, of the area's successful music releases find their legs in the Emerald City. It's simple: release a great record in Seattle and your local listeners will support you. People in the Sea-Tac genuinely love the arts and, probably more than any other city in the U.S., there is a huge record collector culture. And, of course, a vibrant live music culture. So I wasn't at all surprised to see a new release from Seattle's own Ben \\"Macklemore\\" Haggerty heavily promoted in a recent Best Buy ad. The record, titled The Heist, is a neu hip-hop gem featuring Mack on vocals and Ryan Lewis on production. The record, which features a number of already-beloved Seattle hip-hop classics from the duo's past local releases, debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 chart, selling an impressive 78,000 copies during its first week of release. Not bad for an album that hasn't even yet been added to the Metacritic or Allmusic databases. And not too big of a surprise, really, when you consider that there are well over 3.5 million people currently living in Seattle metropolitan area.<br /><br />At first glance The Heist could be hastily written off as a neu rap take on the Atmosphere model. A white emcee and a white producer framed in a hipster-meets-classicist-hip-hop veneer. A thrift shop emcee. Simple beats, a simple rhyme style and a lot of big, memorable hooks. And sure, that's fair enough, but there's more going on here than phoned-in impersonation. Mack playfully emulates Slug's style in the same near-Xerox manner in which Action Bronson takes on the Ghostface vibe. Like Bronson, Macklemore is, at the moment at least, a much harder working emcee than his inspiration. He's recording a whole lot of songs and putting an incredible amount of thought into his lyrics, performances and releases. So much so that I feel safe saying that Mack is maybe already more of a songwriter than Slug has ever been - if only because he clearlyworks harder on his writing. Slug came first, and when he's on, he's superior, but Mack has much to offer on The Heist's 15 tracks, and he's lucky to have found the perfect producer for his laid-back, storytelling style.<br /><br />Ryan Lewis, whom, like most hip-hop producers, I can't find a while lot of information about, is much more musical in his approach than his Atmosphere equivalent, Ant, was for the first 10 years of his career. But unlike Mack, Lewis doesn't take a whole lot from Atmosphere. His compositions, to my ears, sort of feel like a hip-hop equivalent to Spoon or even Wire. Lewis makes big productions in a smart, minimalist way that beg me to believe that he's either (A) a clear-headed visionary, or (B) a very good self-editor. Lewis never once falls into the safety zone of break beat-riding, nor the jazz riff pit of obviousness. He's a key-based producer whose compositions seem like the perfect fit for the kind of indie rock listener who, from time to time, likes to really dig in on a hip-hop record. The sound is big when it needs to be and sweet and subtle the rest of the time. It's a great fit for Mack, whose presence is quite obviously the center of attention on The Heist.<br /><br />Lead single \\"Same Love,\\" backed by a snazzy video and a Mary Lambert-sung hook, has crossover written all over it, Macklemore talking about equality in a way you probably haven't heard in hip-hop music. The song is simple - a piano loop, a whole lot of rap-talk words, a horn lick here and there and, of course, an enormous R&B hook that's held high by a notably epic handclap/drum arrangement. A great track. That said, \\"White Walls,\\" is frustrating. There's are great things about the song, like the oddly catchy production, and some wholly tasteless moments, like the Hollis-sung hook and the guest verse from ScHoolBoy. I could pick apart everyone song on The Heist in such a fashion, but what would get boring. What you need to know is that: (1) Macklemore is an interesting emcee who, if listeners can get stomach his similarities to Slug, just might be a Next Big Thing candidate; (2) Ryan Lewis is the rare producer who makes neu-style hip-hop that doesn't feel cheep and tinny; (3) This is a good enough record that's maybe a little too long and has, ohh, about nine too many guests; (4) If you like indie music, you'll probably have a good time picking apart and getting to know Lewis' oft-brilliant backdrops. We suggest you get the record, rip it to your computer, cut the stinkers and spin this fun, solid national debut from Seattle hip-hop heroes Macklemore and Ryan Lewis.<br /><br />Read more of my music and film writing at ZeCatalist.com.
B000BKHL1K|5.0|Gorgeous, lovely, sturdy and chic! I highly recommend for any style of decor, not just modern. I have a very French Country/Boho vibe in my apartment and this manages to fit in quite nicely.<br /><br />It's very easy to install and remove- but note to the wise- save the little screwdriver very carefully and clearly label it. Because if you don't have that, then removing the apparatus would be super difficult.
B008XNZMOU|4.0|Working full-time gigs at record stores for nine years meant hearing a lot of music I wouldn't have otherwise spent any time with. I've kept up with indie music (or college rock, or whatever you want to call it) pretty well since the late mid- to late-90s, so I never needed much help there. Typically, it was pop, soul and pop rock music that my always diverse batch of co-workers often exposed me to. Everything from U2's All That You Can't Leave Behind, which I heard about fourteen thousand times in late months of 2000, to Avril Lavigne's Under My Skin, a record I even ended up buying at some point. Nowadays, it's the lonely late hours of the night that usually prompt me to look into artists I wouldn't other check out. I screen the new releases on iTunes, listening to as many samples as I can. Most of what I hear, of course, is very much not for me. But, from time to time, I'll be really surprised by how good a Miley Cyrus or P!nk or Katy Perry song is. My most recent surprise find just happens to be, as I type this sentence, the by-far most popular record on the planet - Taylor Swift's fourth proper studio album, Red. I'd heard the record's lead single, \\"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,\\" a number of times, here and there, floating around in popular society's dying common spaces. A good pop song, I thought, not realizing that it was the work of that goofy, skinny, super young country singer who serial dates celebrities and acts super phony every time a camera is pointed at her. It never occurred to me that it could be Swift - an artist I knew to be a bland product of the modern pop-country machine. This was a pop song. A cheesy one, but a good one, with great production, an incredible hook and brilliant production.<br /><br />The samples I eventually heard on iTunes were at-times interesting, but it took hearing the album's most recent single, \\"I Knew You Were Trouble,\\" to convince me to really look into Swift and her new record. What I found was a pretty solid pop disc that had few traces of any sounds I relate to the country genre (through further investigation I learned that Red is a departure from Swift's past records, which are full of generic mod-pop-country). So yes, finally, I bought a copy of Red. Of the album's 16 tracks I genuinely enjoy six - quite a bit, even. The by-far best offering remains, I think, the above mentioned \\"Trouble,\\"  a synth-heavy production that feels, to me at least, oddly hip. It's an indie synth pop track that could be played alongside Fun or even Gorillaz, the difference being that Swift songs - I hate to admit - really do have notably stellar vocals. Other great cuts include opener \\"State of Grace\\" (which, oddly enough, sounds like Swift singing over an early naughts U2 composition), \\"Stay Stay Stay\\" (a cutesy indie pop song that will absolutely be in a television commercial soon enough), the aforementioned \\"We Are Never\\" (another big snyth-pop production with a massive hook), \\"The Last Time\\" (a singer/songwriter collaboration with Snow Patrol's Gary Lightbody that, no jokin', could've easily been on the Once soundtrack) and \\"The Lucky One,\\" an epic swell of a production that borders on being too cheesy.<br /><br />But here's the thing about this review: I'm unusually picky about pop music. Chances are, if you like Taylor Swift - or commercial pop music, or pretty much any of the songs I've discussed in this review - there's a very good chance you'll like most of Red. I recognize that the title track is a big winner, as are second single \\"Begin Again,\\" pop-fest \\"22\\" and Ed Sheeran collaboration \\"Everything Has Changed.\\" I just don't personally happen to like these songs a whole lot ... yet. What I'm saying is this: Taylor Swift, against all odds, has made a pretty damn impressive pop record. Working with producers like Butch Walker (Avril Lavigne, Weezer, Katy Perry, Pete Yorn), Dan Wilson (Mike Doughty, Adele), Jackknife Lee (U2, R.E.M., Weezer, Bloc Party), and Kanye West's secret weapon, Jeff Bhasker (Bruno Mars, Alicia Keys, Fun, Drake, Beyonce, Jay-Z, Lana Del Rey, etc.) doesn't hurt. Nor does being able to sing as well as Swift surely can. Yeah, the record's themes - a 20-something girl growing up, trying new things, falling in and out of relationships - isn't relatable to me, but that's what all the massive hooks and interesting production is for. I never thought I'd say this but, sure, I like some Taylor Swift songs. A whole lot, even. That said, when I listen through the Swift back catalog I dislike just about everything I hear; Red, though ... well, for what it is, it's pretty damn impressive.<br /><br />Read more of my music and film writing at ZeCatalist.com.
B0031ES8P6|3.0|The Hello kitty toy was a lot smaller than described in the details! The shipping was great but when I opened it up I honestly thought they had sent me a pink one instead of the purple it looks like! Turns out its just washed out coloring, not at all what i thought but its for a kid so who cares!! just wish they would present it as is and not exaggerate on the photo and description
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|I don't normally write reviews but I had to make an exception for this album. This album is amazing! When I heard Carol of Bells on the radio I had to have the song. When I found out it was Pentatonix, I had to have the album. I downloaded the album at work (another first) because I couldn't wait to get home. It is my new favorite Christmas album.  Their voices are beautiful and their harmonies are amazing! This is more than beautiful singing, it is art.
1603427244|4.0|I still consider myself a beginner knitter, so I was surprised by all the difference cast on/bind offs there are - and how they are used for different kinds of projects. I've already refered to it on almost every project numerous times. The only thing I think would be nice to have is a short reference section in the back of basic knitting/crochet terms. I will also say that if you find it hard to learn via pictures (I tend to learn better by DOING or by watching a live demonstration), some of the instructions will take extra concentration and numerous tries to get it right or be just as confusing as any other photo instruction manual/book.<br /><br />I expect this book to be a great reference for me in years of knitting to come!
B0015GDR44|1.0|I made it almost half-way through \\"Laura\\", week one. What a drama queen, with a garbage mouth at drama's best. For those reviewers saying, \\"a real world/real life look into psychotherapy,\\" I can't help but wonder about what broad-based experience they may have with therapy, therapists, or those \\"in treatment.\\"<br /><br />Having much experience in work-related relationships with mental health professionals, having much experience personally in therapy working on my own issues, and relating to quite a few people in therapy with regular life difficulties and/or mental illnesses of different kinds, this Laura episode is very disappointing to me. It is simply cheap and disgusting, and takes away from what could be a truly great program. There've been good lawyer programs, and horrible ones. Good medical ones, and horrible ones. This theme of psychotherapy could be so great and interesting, as well as truly informative, instead it is trashy, so much cheap-garbage language and even bathroom sex in a TV show... it insults the whole idea, and that's too bad. The story line too was shallow and sappy, lacking in any genuine, intelligent creativity. I was really disappointed.<br /><br />Disgusted, I bailed out somewhere around 12-13 minutes. I won't be wasting 1 more minute on this pathetic waste of time and energy -- maybe those responsible for this thing can get some good therapy and do better next time around. Being \\"in treatment\\" might be helpful!

B000I55YU8|5.0|One of my favorite movies for the actors, soundtrack and action.  Got this to back up an original VHS version.  A comfortable movie to take off the shelf when I want to relax and enjoy a movie I know I'll like.  The Japanese actor Ken Takakura was an excellent addition to the cast, playing a significant role with sublety and power.
1932735410|5.0|This is a very easy to read guide for learning and passing the PMP Exam. I highly recommend this book!
B005LAIGYQ|3.0|This movie is hard to review. I opted for middling 3 stars which does not do movie full justice.<br /><br />Action Scenes - 5 stars. Perhaps the best I have ever seen of modern, small arms warfare. All those scenes had air of authenticity and were gripping. The overall pace of the movie was clearly made for those scenes where things are visual and move quickly.<br /><br />Plot - 1 star. Plot was between a joke and very bad. Also plot is where movies starts diverging from reality. SEALs do not decide who to whack, SEALs do not have their own intelligence, etc. Movie has neither emotion nor drama - that is how real soldiers go about their business. However a great movie has to have a personal drama. It is a must of the genre. \\"Threat to America\\" is not personal enough. The terrorist character is not developed at all.<br /><br />Acting - 1 star. Dialogs were a joke. All dialogs appear to be abbreviated to the point of making no sense.

Great flick.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Love the show;had to catch up so bought four episodes.<br />Viewing quality was excellent! Episodes were readily available and payment was fast and easy.
B005LAII62|2.0|I love this movie the only problem is the widescreen. Its horrible, there is more black bars then movie and I have a 52\\" tv and the movie was still to small to see. The should have released it in either fullscreen or normal widerscreen.
1595828753|3.0|The books came all together as I ordered, a couple days late than what Amazon said, but they still made it nonetheless! The only issue I had with the book (as seen in all three of them) was some sort of ink smudge, where it looked like some ink transferred over to the other pages. There were a lot of pages in each of the looks that made it look like it had dirt on the paper, but I could still read and enjoy it just fine!

B000MD9UJC|3.0|The reason it gets 3 is because while the led upgrade was nice and bright, the switch does not work properly.
B00A8ECU24|2.0|Th is is a great game, it is very balanced. The music and voice acting is great. However there is one major problem with it. To complete the game you need to buy some of the mane six with what the game calls gems. The problem is that you can only get 3 gems per week. Some of the mane six cost as much as 100 gems. This means that to play the game it would take years to complete it. This fact alone makes the game a pain to play. Also the game will bomb you with ads ever five seconds. This is a great game and it is worth it if you do not mind paying over $100 just so you can finish this game with in a year. For everyone else you may want to avoid this game until Gameloft gets their heads out of there butts. I really wanted a game like this but over $100 is too much to pay for this game.
B000YHG72E|4.0|We watched this as a family.  Some of the comments were a little &#34;edgie&#34; so I would not completely rate this as 100% family friendly.

B00008XFAF|1.0|I am very unhappy about this product.  Always is one of my favorite movies, but when I tried to watch the DVD, it wouldn't play because it was for a different location.  I have never heard of that before, but because of that, I have wasted my money and the product is useless to me.  At the very least, I would like my money refunded.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Let me start out by saying I was a latecomer to this show. My wife and I watched it earlier this year from a streaming service. I must admit, I am now one of the many people who are angered by the moronic decision to cancel this series. Joss Whedon and Nathan Fillion are brilliant, the chemistry between the actors in this show is amazing, the characters are believable, the concept is sound, and the stories are extremely entertaining. The CGI is actually quite good, you don't feel like you are watching a cheap made for cable movie.<br />I say buy it, watch it, love it, and tell Fox that they are stupid for cancelling it, and need to bring it back.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This was an awesome read!!  Could not put it down.  Best book of 2012.  Comparable to Water for Elephants or anything by Barbara Kingsolver

B0083GQ2A0|2.0|Loved the concept, the scene setter, the way it was written. However, I can only take a certain amount of vulgar language that is absolutely unnecessary. It seemed to me that the director was adding F#$% to every line on purpose. That in of itself really brought the movie down.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. It gave me information I was looking for, helping me to cope with the sadness of losing a great friend!
B000002TLX|5.0|Can't go wrong with this CD if you are a Richard Marx fan.  Reminds me of being a young woman and listening to the radio as I drove up and down the coast of California.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|What more can I say?  This is an adorable movie, well-made with a great comedic cast.  Funny plus teaches some good life lessons.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I actually watched this on a flight to London and loved it enough to watch it again on my return flight.  Therefore, it had to join my collection.  It is a bit of a chick flick, but very well written with amazing characters.  I found that at the end of the movie I really wished I could see more.  I also wanted to move into the hotel and become friends with all the amazing inhabitants.

0385535147|5.0|This book is not what I was expecting.<br /><br />This wasn't the straight ahead legal thriller (i.e. The Litigators, The Confession, and The Associate) that I've enjoyed the past couple of Falls.<br /><br />Instead, I got a book with a plot so full of twists and turns that it would make Jeffery Deaver blush.<br /><br />That's not a bad thing in this case as this story was riveting. While there were times in the books that I felt like a few pages were stuck together or that there were a few chapters I had accidentally skipped over, things begin to make sense as the book goes on.<br /><br />The protagonist is a Lawyer who has fallen on hard times (where have we seen books like that before), however, this book is more about deception and revenge in comparison to Grisham's earlier books. And while the protagonist may have under estimated the odds of the events unfolding the way they did (a thousand to one), the story was enjoyable nonetheless.

B006IYG5HE|4.0|I am a great fan of Jo Nesbo's Harry Hole series but since this particular book moved back and forth in time and so often I had trouble keeping the characters straight. Basically because of their Norwegian names. I have now read 5 of the series (not in order which is something I would recommend if possible) and found the previous 4 to be more about Harry (we do get to know all about Harry and what a dark interesting character he is) and less now and then history bringing us to the final thrilling conclusion. I should have made a list of characters and who they were as I was introduced to them. Hmmmmm ... yes retrospect. Jo Nesbo is extremely talented and I do recommend the series. The 4 previously read books (&#34;The Devil's Star&#34; &#34;The Leopard&#34; &#34;Nemesis&#34; and &#34;The Snowman&#34;) would have all gotten a 5 star ratings. This one just seemed a little harder to read but it was still really good.

B007KQI1NA|5.0|I wanted to use this for the Raspberry Pi as a on board GPS in my truck, but the Pi does not seem to support every aspect of this chip-set yet. The Pi recognizes that it is attached, and it even knows that it is a GPS, but getting it to work has been unsuccessful as of yet. This GPS unit does work on my laptop and netbook computers very well. The only problem is that it does not refresh very fast, but I think there should be a way to fix that problem through the software that I am using, just have not figured it out yet. Also, the magnetic bottom is great for sticking to the roof you your vehicle, and the rubber ring keeps the unit from scratching your paint. Try using it with Navit and openstreetmaps. Good buy!

It has room for all the lenses and accessories we have, as well as room for the backup D40 body!  It's almost as if this pack was designed specifically for our needs!  There are enough cubes for three lens (except for super zooms), dedicated flash, battery chargers and more.  It's comfortable on your back as well, even though the straps aren't cushioned that well.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Inexpensive<br />Lots of storage cubes<br />Well-made<br /><br />Cons:<br />None
B004YW4L5K|3.0|From all that I'd heard about this book over the last few years, I'd been very excited to read it, and looked forward to tearing through the story. Instead I found that... well... I'm just not that into this book. I like the concept, and I like the attention to detail, but I suspect that Neil Gaiman - for all I like him as a person and respect his skill as a writer - just doesn't quite do it for me. I found myself not enjoying the reading experience and occasionally even getting bored. I've found this somewhat typical of his writing style for me, and simply can't seem to get into a lot of his novels, though, again, I acknowledge he's a good writer, just not for my tastes.<br />Gaiman is definitely skilled and he always has interesting ideas, but most of the time I just find the delivery too harsh and grey. I realize that's sort of the point, especially with this story as I've discovered it to be, but this book just wasn't what I had hoped for.<br /><br />If you're a Gaiman fan, you'll probably enjoy it more than I did, so base it on how much you enjoyed some of his other work.

0979019710|5.0|Especially in times like these when the economy is in the gutter and SO many people are unsatisfied with their financial well being, their jobs, their happiness and other parts of their lives, self-help books and programs become a way for motivated people to try to improve their situation.  These books are filled with great concepts and ideas to make your life better and are especially good at short-term motivation, but rarely does a person completely turn their lives aroung after reading a few pages.  Why is this?  Because most self-help books lack direct, easy, simple steps for change.  And if they do, they are only applicable to small percentage of readers.  And even then, the change is so minimal that people find it tough to keep it up.  THE MIRACLE MORNING IS DIFFERENT!<br /><br />If you want the most SIMPLE way to improve EVERY part of your life - your physical health, your energy levels, your happiness, your focus, your drive, etc., then spend the $10 and get ready to become the BEST VERSION OF YOURSELF. Get ready for every morning to feel like christmas day.<br /><br />Things that make THE MIRACLE MORNING the greatest self-help book of all time:<br /> - It is applicable to EVERYONE. Anyone can do it, and anyone can change it to make it their own.<br /> - It can be immediately implemented. The book is short, sweet, and to the point. Hal doesn't waste time. It can be read in one day and YOU can begin changing your life TOMMORROW!<br /> - It's cheap! After the ridiculous $10 book price, there's not another expense, ever, to implement what Hal teaches you. To be completely honest, if this book were $100, i STILL wouldn't hesitate to buy it.<br /> - It's contagious. You can do the MIRACLE MORNING with the people you love!<br /> - It ALL makes sense. There's not a single part of the MIRACLE MORNING that doesn't have a long history of being beneficial to human beings.<br /> - Don't have time? Hal explains how you spend the first 6 MINUTES OF YOUR DAY can change howthe rest of your day goes. If you can invest 6 minutes of your morning to developing yourself towards the best person you can possibly be, then get this book.<br /><br />I am a HUGE fan of Tony Robbins, Jim Rohn, Steven Covey, Dale Carnegie and many others. But for the reasons above, Hal Elrod has an edge on all of them, and he's giving this gift to the world for 10 bucks. Ok, enough rambling for me, i'm off to bed after a satisfyingly productive day, and I can't wait to wake up and begin another tremendous day with my own MIRACLE MORNING!  :)  :)  :)
B00AGOGOLE|1.0|I would be more interested in a camera function that allowed me to point the camera at other objects.  As is this camera only allows you to take pictures of whoever is holding the kindle.  I personally have no interest in taking pictures of myself.  I actually am very disappointed, the main reason I purchased the Kindle Fire HD was because of the camera app which in my opinion has proven to be quite useless.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|This book has something for everyone.  Lots of information.<br /><br />Like his other books, this one gets you thinking about the concepts that he introduces.  You might not agree with everything, but it will get you thinking and get you coming up with your own ideas.
B004PR71JC|5.0|Rio is the best CD for kids and adults. The songs are fun, upbeat, happy! Adults and kids will enjoy together.
B0091QS88K|5.0|The kids love it.  Simple enough that the 3 year old can do it, interesting enough to keep him busy for an hour.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|Rio is the best movie for kids and adults enjoy together. The songs and pictures are fun, upbeat, happy! Adults and kids will have a bless.
1419701533|5.0|Good series. My kids loved it. Arrived in good box set.<br />Good for kids age 6 and over. Highly recommended.
0739321005|5.0|This is especially good since it is read by the author-makes it so much more authentic.  Especially since he is our president, it's amazing to hear about his &#34;formulative years&#34;.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|I ordered the print version and the kindle version (due to travel). The author promised the print version would be beautiful. I was so pleasantly surprised when I received it. It was way more than I expected. And so overflowing with interesting information. I love to cook (amateur) and I am very interested in Meta Learning. Always searching for books on ways to learn better, etc. This is a learning book that speaks to my interests in languages, learning AND cooking. Just cannot beat it.  The format is also awesome. From the break down of parts and chapters down to even recipes. Totally unique.  Most books of this type are a bit fluffy.  This one was packed tight.  I will be re-reading it as well as referencing it for a very long time. Keep up the great work.
B000LC55F2|5.0|I LOVE this movie. I always tend to dislike Scarlett Johansson in pretty much everything, but Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are so excellent that I can overlook her underly-dramatic performance. Great movie!
B005PTYOTE|4.0|These are great movies, and I got them at a great price! they came earlier than I expected! I am happy with it!
B005WUHAX8|1.0|The idea is a good one for this case. Unfortunetly this case cause the microphone to cut out. My friends and family and the contact at the Apple Desk said I sounded like I was in an echo chamber. The voice quality was really bad. I would send it back if I could
B00A6N7BS0|4.0|Absolutely!!! Good writing and better acting.  With this powerhouse line up and great story line, this movie will &#34;Take you away Calgon&#34; for those old enough to remember the jingle.  I like movies to give my mind something to do besides think about all the other things I should be doing. Great escape entertainment along the lines of Boon Dock Saints, but not that harsh.<br />skooch1007
B003EY7IRC|5.0|I thought the ending was great. I am happy that Mac and Barrons ended up together. I love that they accepted and loved each other no matter their flaws. True acceptance. . .
B005CGI4EG|5.0|A classic never dies and they surely don't make them like they use to. This show is case in point. I got this set for a friend, as a Christmas gift. He mentioned he watches some episodes on YouTube, and i thought he would deal better with having the physical DVDs rather then streaming it online. I am a fan of the show and found the price of all eleven seasons in one box set to be unbeatable. Each individual season usually sells for the same price of this entire box set, so there is no need to even do the math. Unfortunately, I got each box set as they were individually released. Anyways, i thought it would be a nice gesture to give him this box set as a Christmas gift. I think he was truly touched and i think someone like him can really appreciate this show for what it is and the sentiment behind the gift. Most people want expensive and lavish gifts. I think this will do just fine. I just love giving the gift of entertainment.<br /><br />On another note, this show really defined a generation. The cast is amazing, their one-liners and quick witted comebacks are a blast to enjoy no matter what decade one is in. This is a true classic not to be missed. Every family has a bit of dysfunction, but the Bundy's really exemplified their thoughts and let them be personified out LOUD. I do have to admit that since i am a HUGE fan of the show that I personally noticed that season seven is where the `magic' really disappears. Each episode dealt less with fun family issues like excessive phone bills, paying taxes, dealing with a leak in the ceiling, anniversary gifts, or Peggy running to Vegas after selling Al's TV. The family issues in the latter seasons were lacking and i think that contributed to its loss of magic. However, I'd still recommend this show and urge one to pick it up for good, fond memories, or a slice of the eighties.
B0017I1IZA|4.0|Janet is such a great writer, wish she'd knock off the &#34;f&#34; words, though.  She's so talented, and that doesn't add anything.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|All the other reviews tell the same problem...Will only load first ten stories, then freezes. Going back to the mobile site until this is fixed. Ridiculous!
B0092S4WLY|4.0|good game and i found it is interesting and to open for have to found clues bt so less stage looking forward to see more stage like these.
B000T433CO|5.0|This is not only a great holiday classic, but one of the best romantic comedies of all time. The acting is wonderful and the story lines will warm your heart!  I'm picking up an extra copy to have for a very long time!
0684824906|5.0|What can anyone say about this magisterial history and analysis that hasn't been said already, in quintuplicate? Only that it is seldom recognized that Doris Kearns Goodwin was first a trained political scientist and only later a historian by topical interest - biographies of the great and powerful, one Ozymandias after another (with time out for...baseball!...bless her). Consequently, the science of politics is the primary prism through which she peers in on the great men (and the occasional great woman) at the center of this narrative, a closely observed - or as closely as could be from solely the study of documentary records rather than, as was the case with LBJ, documents plus personal observation and interviews with \\"witnesses\\" - study of small group dynamics with the greatest of stakes in the offing.<br /><br />For me, two narrative threads will linger in mind long after most of the details have fallen away. Lincoln's profound and unswerving dedication to principle - and hence to his principled goals - led him to acts that made others profoundly question his judgment and political balance, beginning in the 1854 Illinois Senate election (by vote of the state legislature) with his instruction to backers to shift their preponderant numbers to Lyman Trumbull, an abolitionist Democrat who had only a fraction of the support Lincoln enjoyed but was able reach, as Lincoln could not, the necessary majority (Trumbull's own principle would not permit him, as a recently reelected Democrat, to consign his own 5 votes to the Whig Lincoln). Lincoln's principles led him to select the eponymous \\"team of rivals\\" as the strongest multi-partisan cabinet he could assemble, his choices immediately placing him under fire from both left and right flanks. He kept the politically delusional, boorishly ambitious Salmon Chase as Treasury secretary for Chase's many successes in managing wartime finances, even as Chase lay design after design against his Chief is a quest for the 1864 presidential nomination. Lincoln retained the insecure, insufficiently courageous McClellan as Commander of the Army of the Potomac despite the Young Napoleon's insults, condescension, operational sluggishness, delusional misappraisals of forces arrayed against him, and failures of nerve...until his indisposition to fight after Antietam forced Lincoln's hand. The list goes on and on, with Lincoln's boundless magnanimity overriding the foibles of men he believed he needed with him at the helm.<br /><br />The other point driven home repeatedly by Goodwin is Lincoln's canny feeling for the public mood, together with his sense of political timing and the need to \\"prepare public opinion\\" (the only other place I've seen that phrase used repeatedly is in Chinese propaganda of the 1970s and 1980s, although Lincoln may have learned from the phrase from the French revolutionaries of the 1790s) before making momentous decisions. \\"Public sentiment is everything,\\" he said. In this telling, it comes up most importantly in the debate of the Emancipation Proclamation and, of course, the 13th Amendment that finally abolished slavery throughout the United States. Goodwin cites an essay by Lincoln contemporary James Russell Lowell, America's \\"foremost man of letters,\\" which saw as the President's strongest suit \\"the rough and ready understanding of the people\\" as \\"sure at last to be the controlling power, a profound common-sense...the best genius for statesmanship.\\" (Lincoln himself loved the piece and commended it to his \\"Neptune,\\" Navy secretary Gideon Welles.)<br /><br />This book is bottomless and succeeds at so many levels - character studies of the great in the cauldron of harrowing times and events, simple historical narrative, political analysis of small-group dynamics in the face of gigantic stakes (and not simply something along the line of a town-council decision of whether to raise parking meter rates), political back-story to a war Lincoln, Seward, and others on his team recognized would shape the country and its people for generations (and still does), and, neither last nor least, a parable of politics and political leadership with contemporary resonances Goodwin is tactful to avoid pointing out but, for readers with eyes to see, cannot and should not be missed. As Goodwin has observed in interviews, during the primaries for the 2008 Democratic nomination, she received a phone call on her cell: \\" \\"Hello, Doris? This is Barack Obama. I've read your book. We've got to talk.\\"<br /><br />You should read it toonized would shape the country and its people for generations (and still does), and, neither last nor least, a parable of politics and political leadership with contemporary resonances Goodwin is tactful to avoid pointing out but, for readers with eyes to see, cannot and should not be missed.

B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Great story, but his always are, filled with joy, sorrow but always in the end wonderful.  Read it and enjoy
B000NH7SZ0|5.0|Works perfectly with the Brother HL-6180DW series printers.<br /><br />1. Turn printer off, unplug power & network cables.<br />2. Pull off plastic access door on left side of printer facing from the front.<br />3. Remove metal inner access panel.<br />4. Evenly place SO-DIMM into slot with the notch carefully lined up correctly.<br />5. Push inwards until the side latches snap in place.<br />6. Replace access panels & cables.<br />7. Turn printer on and wait for memory to initialize.<br /><br />That's it, simple, cheap and effective... especially is high volume printing operations. You can't go wrong with this memory!
B00A23MYCC|1.0|Sucked.  Did not like at all.  Really did not like.  Want my money back, that's how bad it was.  Sucked.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I bought this not to long ago. I wasn't so happy with the demo but boy the really version is epic! It's exactly like mine craft! It's being updated! That's a dream come true! BYE IT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!
B009NQKPUW|4.0|Movie was worth the purchase and ties into the Alien movies nicely towards the very end.<br />Looking forward to this movie's sequel.
B00AHSINKO|2.0|I did manage to get through it, but it was two unlikable characters, poor acting from two of the best, and weak story.
B0087YYHZU|5.0|Great music and Great Talent ....sadly never to be seen again...thanks for making this movies available, nothing will ever compare to real talent such as these stars had...a feel good movie...not weirdness and violence such as offered today....
B00899DR40|5.0|My daughter loves this artist and the album was no disappointment to her, and the price was right,  thank you
B005MMJ84K|5.0|I really can`t tell you just how much I love this book. It has this perfect blend of action, suspense and incredible romance. I`ve always been a little cautious with series, because oftentimes the 2nd and 3rd books pale  in comparison. But this deserves a standing ovation,no dissapointments in any way. I finished the book in a day! The only thing that I`m upset about is that Requiem comes out in March! Definitely one of my favourite books.
034580404X|5.0|I loved this trilogy. I read them all one after the other. At first the books had kind of a child like writting style but by the middle of the book she got her stride and they were amazing. I highly recommend these books to women and men because lets face it some men could use the direction lol
B005HSL626|4.0|I think this is a fun game. I would have given it five stars but sometimes the game spazzes out a bit. It's totally normal for the game to do this I think, but it still takes the satisfaction down a bit. I still love it though. I just can't seem to beat my sister's high score. I would totally recommend this game to any of my friends :)
B00540G3G6|5.0|Great movie! Love it, can't wait to see it in 3d! My baby girl will surely love growing up with this!
B000UZNSWM|5.0|excellent read about a war pretty much forgotten--lots of good stuff about the intrigue going on with the american generals and especially macarthur-highly recommened
B007MDB548|5.0|Great movie! Love it, can't wait to see it in 3d! My baby girl will surely love growing up with this!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Not only does my 3 1/2 yr old love the game I have had fun too, especially when we play together.<br /><br />The game is so similar to the cartoon characters she really enjoys it too.
B004WE01YA|5.0|Great movie! Love it, can't wait to see it in 3d! My baby girl will surely love growing up with this!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I have been playing this game all day and I cant put it down and I only am taking this brake because u need to know how good it is! (&deg;O&deg;) its amazing
B007SGLZP8|4.0|If you like John Grisham, you will enjoy the book.  It has a lot of twists and turns.  Was not expected the final twist.
6304117752|5.0|I use this video in school, since we don't yet have any DVD players.  My previous Sound of Music video stopped working, and I needed a replacement.  My students love watching this, even the boys!
B0063IH60K|3.0|Just about what I expected. It is fun when I'm bored or waiting for an appointment or something.  The price was right.
B001HBYHFA|5.0|a perfect finale to the much loved series firefly. no spoilers here just lettin you know this is a great movie. i would suggest watching the series first and mayhaps getting the 4 comics that bridge the gap (not neccesary but suggested) the movie takes place one year after the show ended in story timeline and the comics bridge the gap. ifyou're new to the 'verse prepare to be blown away, it will be your favorite new addiction!
B009VB7QQA|2.0|Went in with low expectations and came away with - &#34;eh, it could have been worse.&#34;<br /><br />Just a meh movie.
B006P0WMBO|4.0|I little slow loading each level, but graphics are smooth once it starts.  Could use more levels; otherwise, it's great.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Terrific show. Pace, characters, plot and dialogue are top notch. It's a smart and entertaining show. It's tough avoiding all the talk about the current season while waiting for season 2 to get on Amazon!
B009MF5BXK|4.0|held my interest but boy are these guys getting old hopefully they come out with another film soon could use some more action packed films
B008KMHFJY|4.0|This book was interesting. The description seemed kinda of provocative and different, so I downloaded it. The fighting thing was kinda of weird, as was the 'pigeon' nickname and the way they just kinda became close in an hour. I have to say though there was no groan of frustration waiting for the main characters to get together, but at the same time it was kind of rushed and unrealistic. As for the crazy over protectiveness, since when do you punch guy who looks at the girl you like? Over the top in my opinion. Travis wasnt really my problem here, Abby was just floating around with every guy and I'm just like oh hey whats going on?!. Also, the random fire? Me no understand.The ending though was absolutely and totally ridiculous lol. Despite these flaws I will most likely read the sequel :)
B0099KJFJ4|2.0|very disappointed with this movie I guess Van Damn is getting too old to act for more then a few minutes
0785163174|4.0|At $50 this is an excellent collection with a ton of content and very little filler. New copy includes code for a digital copy, which by  itself usually costs $70. Defies logic but there you go.
B004GE15MI|5.0|You like her or you don't.  This one was one of the movies I saw when I first met my wife and it has stuck with us.  It's sappy and you'll need a guidebook to track the plots, but it's one of our favorites.
B009X011UQ|3.0|I don't feel this case is worth the $50 price tag.  It is not as thick and durable as other cases I have purchased.
B00AE2J93I|4.0|Exactly the movie we were looking for to watch, not recommended for young children would be too intense and scary.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Edge of seat, white knuckle ride....as usual, Mr. Flynn has delivered a knock out.  Already looking forward to the next book.
B005LFQRTC|4.0|\\"The Six Million Dollar Man\\" is without a doubt one of THE BEST TV show series of all time! This show was the precurosr of all the other shows that turned out to be crap on TV (\\"Shazam\\", \\"Isis\\", \\"Spiderman\\", etc). Lee Majors was my favorite actor when I was growing up watching this series. I wanted to be him! I collected the action figure, the magazines, everything! He was the best! It took a while for this series to come out on DVD and now that it has, I will get them! The boxed set was way too much when it was on sale at first ($295.00). I have seen it cost more now ($350.00). I'm glad they are now sold as individual seasons. I have Season 1, 2 and soon 3. I am glad the \\"Six Million Dollar Man\\" is finally BACK!
B007M45PMU|5.0|It took me weeks to get to the other albums I bought along with this.  It was too good to stop listening to!
B003CSV7TK|5.0|Miracle on 34th street<br /><br />great classic family movie that inspires without an agenda. Remakes can't compare and don't do it justice.  love maureen o'hara and little natalie wood.
B004G600A4|5.0|this was really fun....very well done!  i can't imagine not enjoying this movie, so be sure to buy this one and enjoy!
B00992CF6W|5.0|my son wants it but it costs too much.Please lower the cost of this minecraft game he really really wants.
B009A87Z6U|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  I particularly like the fact that Jeffrey Wright was, again, a member of the cast (I am a big fan of his).
B004Z2TUGE|3.0|I read the book I am Number Four and loved it so when I found out there was a movie about it I was excited. In the beginning I was amazed at the detail but as the movie went on events were skipped, things were rushed, even key things in the book were absent in the movie. The movie itself was okay if not a bit confusing. However, the book to movie transition was terrible. I was very disappointed with the movie but recommend picking the I am Number Four book up and reading it so you can really appreciate the story line.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Worth the money.  This game is by far one of the better games on the market. Good job Dev's. Downloaded fine and never had any issues during gameplay.  We need a sequal.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Good book. Not as action packed as some Grisham books, but still kept me turning the pages quickly.<br />Couldn't have guessed the ending.
B0012TWRAO|5.0|I love these little mounts.  This one came next day air and I used to for my dual sport ride on the handle bars I have.  Has a couple U bolts for multiple sizes.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|So many great ways to compile, use, &amp; track data! I use it for everything from to-do lists to sorting sermon illustrations.
1455502626|5.0|I really like DeMille books, and John Corey seems to be the friend I wish I would have. He is clever, sarcastic  and funny. This book as others Demille's is very good.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|close to a non-stop action movie as well as being a thinking man's movie. Excellently done. Downey's reprise of the original Sherlock Holmes is superb a quick thinking master of deduction and action.be sure to press pause if you leave the room.
B000HWZ4A2|5.0|I watched this movie years ago, and I am sorry to say that I, also, was misdefining the meaning and intent Ms Ayn Rand had in the motivational efforts of this book/Movie. I realized years later, she was trying to warn us, but alas, it is too late. Had we all taken her intent seriously, we possibly could have changed the socialistic direction and governmental control over everything in this great United States. Gary Cooper did one of his most superb acting skills in this movie.
B0070Y46UY|2.0|I haven't even finished reading the book.  The beginning is so very boring I just had to put it down.  I will finish it some day.  Still not finished.  I am up to pages 600 and it is totally boring.  I was told that the movie's first half hour is boring, but then finally gets interesting.  And,great!  It has disappeared from my ipad.
B008XCPO2Q|1.0|I kept expecting the storyline to pick up and to be going somewhere but it was just a very bad plot with good actors from Rescue Me, True Blood and more. Disappointing and a waste of £15.00.
B0097L29KM|4.0|Neil Young and Crazy Horse are back in top form on this one.<br />But shame on Warner Bros for charging $70-80 dollars for the vinyl.<br />In 2012, there is no reason a 3xLP should cost a dollar over $40.<br />Way to gouge your fans, Neil and WB.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love most everything about the game. its annoying that you cant always see your GL friends...and it shuts itself down on the kindle fire. Otherwise it's really fun.  Even my kids enjoy playing it
B00AHSMDQY|1.0|I could only give it one star, if i could i would have given it NEGATIVE stars! After the watching, i immediately regretted it and would like the 3 hours of my life back that i wasted. And im a batman fan.
B008CJ0KBU|5.0|One of the biggest reasons I loved this series was firstly the character development. We weren't given all of the information in mudslide of needless information in the first three episodes and we are STILL learning about them as the series continues. Secondly, the portrayal of sexual orientation. It isn't mentioned, it just is. And because it just is, everyone around the main characters also just accept that reality. That sort of mind set is something I feel should be in all walks of life. People are either gay or straight or bisexual, and that's it. I also love the folklore and creativity in the fantasy world and how each existing or new fantasy creature is displayed, we get some history about that creature. The show as a whole is just well done with amazing chemistry amongst the entire cast, which is a rarity on a show.
B001NKI60W|5.0|I have forgotten how many times  I have watched this movie. I love and respect Meryl Streep so much. The music, the story, everything is beautiful. I listen to the soundtrack and just want to be with the actors dancing.
1592402038|5.0|[[ASIN:B005YPVV9A Grammar Nazi button 1.5\\" Pin-back Button]]<br />I learned about this book at my Texas church.  I bought it and loved it.  Very interesting and I can start to understand my Mother and nieces who are true Grammar Nazi.
B0047WJ12K|5.0|One needs to watch it at least twice to fully grasp the plot I think.  Quite a mindbender. Intense, not for kids under 14.
B008B3H4VQ|5.0|The band has come along way! During the time music and lyrics have been progressing, along with there lives. Understandable!
B002WY65VU|5.0|I named my dog Buck because of this movie.  It's on my top 5 list, and I've seen A LOT of funny movies.  You can't go wrong with this one.
B00756GRUE|5.0|This is a great watch for the money. The blue segment on the bezel gives it just enough colour & also doesn't make it look quite so \\"Rolex-y\\" imho. Like I alluded to in the title it's a very big watch on the wrist, it even makes my Casio G shock look quite small. This doesn't put me off but it's something to be aware of, I suspect it's more than the listed 43mm. The weight is a very substantial 16oz which certainly adds to the general feeling of solidity but came as a surprise at first. I've read quite a few negative comments about the band but I think it looks good and works just fine. The wet-suit extension is a bit flimsy but I'm unlikely to ever use this so it's not a big deal. After wearing the watch for a few days I'm very happy. Just be careful at first until you get used to the case height.<br /><br />Just a quick update on the accuracy. I'm very impressed, after a month it shows the same time as my wave-ceptor (atomic clock updated) Casio.<br /><br />Quick Update: If,(like me),you're getting fed up with the polished center links showing scratches, you can polish them with Brasso. Don't do it too often as the polish is abrasive. However,after 2 years, it totally transformed the band on my watch.<br /><br />Cheers!
B0017DJ3UW|1.0|MC can't sing: she's just another Whitney Houston imitator whose only entertainment value is showing off her body!<br />The traditional Christmas Carol &#34;Joy to the World &#34; track is positively contaminated, no.. blasphemed, by mixing in parts of the 3 Dog Nite song of the same title.<br />In summary, this album SUCKS!!!
B000FA5SMK|3.0|TOOO much repetition on material.  Seemed to be trying hard to be &#34;blue&#34; and failed .  It was more like a middle schooler trying to learn to use sexual inuendo.<br /><br />He seemed to repeat and repeat the details.<br />Both women were written as if thy only had a brain in their heads if they agreed with him,otherwise his character was olny interested in what his glands told him.<br /><br />He also does not have very skilled grammer editor./
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I t was awesome Percy and Annenberg get back happens in the end. You must READ THIS amazing book awesomeness.
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|I teach in the public school system, and the success of students is a huge issue.  We are saddled with blanket fixes that have nothing to do with the individual students or unique microcultures in which we teach, but are bankrupting our districts and frustrating all involved.  Mr. Tough takes a thorough look at what really makes or breaks a child academically, and then offers and evaluates fixes that have been tried.  I really appreciated the bald  view he took on successes and frustrations.  Nobody was exempt; we all simply need to do better.  Students are complex creatures and they must be taken as they are without whining about how they got that way.  Eliminating poverty and addressing all of the social issues that are undermining our society is not going to happen.  Understanding, though, the complex make-up of what comes through our doors is crucial.  Having the resources to do what works remains an impossibility at this point.  Mr. Tough offered insights on how to use all sorts of 'littles' to enhance what we do.  I particularly appreciated the idea of 'grit' that he presented- I can see how it contributes to success and am finding ways to encourage and celebrate it in my students.
B00AHSMDQY|2.0|The Batman series is done.  The fake accent on Christian Bale was very annoying and the move was WAY too long.
B00936A0RU|4.0|Lawless is a gritty, bloody, and powerful gangster tale that takes place in Prohibition-era Virginia. Shia LaBeouf gives his best performance, perhaps of his career, as Jack, the youngest of the Bondurant brothers, who took part in the American dream as back-woods moonshiners. You'll find traces of LaBeouf's typical charm here, but he brings an intensity to the screen I haven't seen from him before. Another fantastic performance is given my Tom Hardy, who plays Jack's older and burlier brother Forrest, who will go to any lengths to uphold his principles. Guy Pearce plays Charley Rakes, the menacing deputy that is trying to put a stop to the Bondurant brother's business, and a character you will instantly hate.<br /><br />The cinematography in the movie is absolutely gorgeous. John Hillcoat does a terrific job using the Virginian landscape to his advantage, as well as using lighting and colors to their full advantage. I found myself in awe of some of the scenes.<br /><br />An issue I had with the film is that there were a couple of storylines that could have been developed further, particularly Gary Oldman's and Jessica Chastain's. They both give good performances but I would have liked to see some more screen time from both of them.<br /><br />Other than that, the movie flows fairly well and comes to a satisfying close. Be warned, there are some gruesome parts that may make your stomach turn. Hillcoat is no stranger to dark and brutal violence, and he doesn't stray away from that with Lawless.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I really like the game.  It is addictive and fun to play. Unfortunately this game has too many technical problems.  I made it to Level 50 then it lost all my progress, so I had to start over.  Now I'm on Level 41, and every time I try to purchase something in the store it crashes.  When I try to complete the tasks it crashes.  Tech support seems very slow to fix the bugs.
0545265355|5.0|These books are amazing..alot of people dont like it beacuse its about kids killng other kids...Well then dont read it!! Its something different brought to us and we enjoy it..its not all gory and all..very lovely!

B0098VYCCE|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie.  The graphics and action were awesome.  Well worth watching.  Highly recommended movie.  Kristen Stewart does a great Snow White
B007SGLZP8|3.0|The book starts out in good form, like a good classic Grisham, but mid-way through the book it gets tedious and the story line seems rushed.  Frankly it just got boring at about the 80% point which is where you expect some real suspense.  I almost yawn when I think back to the 90% point.  Not nearly enough suspense or surprise, and the last 10% is all explanation of some nebulous points that occurred early on.  I give it 3 stars and say \\"Mr. Grisham, you should stay focused when you complete a book\\", but I'm sure he doesn't need someone reminding him.
0307276902|5.0|This book was very entertaining and inspirational. I started reading this book after the whole memoir scandal that Frey pulled. I still wanted to read the book because I still kept hearing that the book was really good, I was hooked from the beginning when he wakes up on the plane covered in blood, mucus and vomit. Most people would cringe at the thought after reading the intro but the descriptiveness of the situation is what I liked most; the feeling as if you are siting right along side of him witnessing the horror. I would definitely recommend the book for people that have someone with an addiction in their family so they can get a better understanding of what that is like.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great reading and for some reason I could not put it down. Highly addictive and very suggestive. A great read.
0307450570|5.0|Martha's book gives an array of crafts ..... many you'd want to make.  I recommend this book.  Many craft books are the cutsie mentality and nothing you'd care to make.  This is more up-to-date.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Highly addictive book and not for the faint of heart. Could not put it down just had to find out what happens next.
B005SO6TLM|5.0|I ended up at a live performance having no knowledge of Charles' music and what to expect- what I experienced was miraculous and is now easily in the top 5 musical performances i've ever seen. Religious experience is a better description than music performance actually- Charles is an incredible human being to be within close proximity of. Beyond that, musically he is somewhere between the soul of Otis Redding and the funk of James Brown.
B009VB7QQA|5.0|I loved the story, the action and the special effects. I never dreamed such a story line would be so good.
0547884591|5.0|This is a great book. It's much different than any other cookbook you will likely ever read. Ferris teaches you simple recipes based upon simple techniques. He also makes it a learning experience. You learn all sorts of skills that are not cooking per se but skills related to cooking. Ferris also teaches you how to learn new skills.<br /><br />He also provides you with information and recommendations on tools and equipment and useful tips to save time and get better results.<br /><br />The recipes in the book are compatible with his 4 hour body diet too!<br /><br />Well worth the price!!!

B001GKJ2F2|5.0|I liked this movie very very much. Great action sequences and excellent humor. I think this movie was a hell of a lot better than \\"Salt\\". I would most definately buy Wanted for my movie collection. Salt i would not. And Amazon always has the best prices on used DVDs!! I know i can get lots of used DVDs at pawn shops for like $1. But the selection is not great and you have to do too much hunting around. I get great awesome movies from Amazon for $3-$4 delivered directly to my door. Thats a plenty good enough bargain for me. (Sorry, i know that i went off topic there, but i just write what i feel as it comes to me lol).

B005DJGMQE|4.0|Round- up everybody in sight, storm into houses without search warrants grabbing everything in sight, make the rules of evidence and procedure as you go along (as opposed to some vaunted \\"rule of law\\" that is the norm), trial by military commission rather than civilian trial by a jury of peers when such courts are open, suspension of the writ of habeas corpus (bring forth the body-to some court for adjudication of a wrong), no right of appeal, torture, and execution. All episodes from today's \\"war of terror\\" as the American government (and others as well) round up the bad guys, or whoever they suspect of being the bad guys.<br /><br />Well, yes.  But also, according to this Robert Redford -directed first film in the American Film Company production line, the prevailing atmosphere on the Union side, political, legal and military around those who conspired to kill Abraham Lincoln (and Vice-President Johnson and Secretary Of State Seward) along with John Wilkes Booth. The film centers on the pre-trial and trial events of the only woman brought to trial in the conspiracy (it was at her boarding house where conspiracy was advanced), Mary E. Surratt who was tried before a Union Army military commission, and eventually the first woman hanged by the federal government, for her part in the conspiracy.<br /><br />We all, those of us who revere the historic memory of Abraham Lincoln, are glad, glad as hell that the south and slavery were defeated. We are nevertheless as supporters of democratic rights now (and hopefully back then, as well) concerned about the modern day issues that this film brings out whether we are sympathetic to Mary Surratt's plight (or those of today's political  prisoners). Watch this thought-provoking film which is a well-done production highlighting these issues without being maudlin about it.
B005HSL626|4.0|My wife loves this little game, I think she relieves a little stress by playing it. Me i think its decent with nice graphics.

B00AC8ZJPQ|5.0|Awesome movie based on the Halo games. Looking forward to the sequels. For me it is about time they started making a movies series from Halo.
0547564651|5.0|How Children Succeed shares a lot of different ways we have tried to improve our educational system over the years, but particularly in the last couple of decades.  The author takes on the idea of nature vs. nurture head on and uncovers problems and successes in both.  The reader as an educator, parent, or mentor will certainly see areas they can improve in and areas where there student/child may be slipping through the cracks.<br /><br />The author has many illustrations both on personal levels and clinical levels.  Through the many case studies he makes it so you can relate with the struggles between teachers and students.  The biggest drawback to the book, if there is one, may be that the author uses too many illustrations with too much detail.  As a text book it is very folksy; as a compilation of individual life stories it is clinical.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to teachers that want to find new ideas to get the most out of their students.  It would not be a bad idea for an entire school or district to have this as required or at least suggested reading for their teachers.  I would not say that Paul Tough's conclusions are absolute by any means but certainly he strikes on ideas that would be beneficial to many, especially in certain circumstances with struggling students.  Mr. Tough writes this book with unique eyes that give him a special ability to recognize the struggles so many students and teachers face.  It will give you a fresh look at many of these problems.
1467934925|1.0|Very bad.<br />Bad qualitty. My advice: do not buy this book.<br />Bad print, errors into the book.<br />I don't like.

THE SETTINGS ARE NOT DONE WELL - THE BOOK GOES ON AND ON ABOUT THE MAN'S DEATH. WHAT ON EARTH DID MOST OF THE STICK CHARACTERS SEE IN THIS MAN? WE KNOW NOT MUCH ABOUT HIM.

B007VUCAVO|5.0|the title says it all.  I like apps that perform the expected task simply, quickly and completely.  This is one such app.  I used the free version for 3 hours before updating to the paid version.  Believe me when I say that it was money well spent.  I tried several other battery apps, and while some were pretty good, this one was a clear winner.  The app controls are easy to master and very intuitive.<br /><br />Also bought their flashlight app. - which by the way loads not only from my desktop but also right from the batter app.  Someone actually thought their development efforts through and tied programs together.
B00AE2I4WK|2.0|What's to say? Too much booty shakin, etc. for my family's taste. Felt the story line could have been stronger.
B0013F1D02|5.0|I love this movie so, so much. It has action, comedy, romance! And Robert DeNiro is BRILLIANT in it! I also can't get over how GORGEOUS Michelle Pheifer is! Can't say enough good things.
B0009K9PGG|2.0|It’s no wonder this CD is used by many audio gear retailers who want to sell you a good pair of speakers. The sound quality of this CD is quite impressive and I have to admit, I was really impressed for the 2 or 3 minutes I spent listening to it while auditioning some speakers. But in that context, I was paying more attention to sonic details and soundstage than actually listening to the music.<br />Although the tunes aren’t bad, the musicianship is certainly not stellar and the effects of great audio engineering quickly wears off. So much so that this CD is now collecting dust on the shelf.
B001DSNELA|4.0|To start off the movie is a full 4 stars. Skyfall is even better, best Bond film yet!<br /><br />Daniel Craig was born for this role.

B008220C38|2.0|After seeing the preview, and having loved the book, I rushed out to see Anna Karenina. Unfortunately, the movie disappointed me from the opening.<br /><br />I tried to get into the ever-changing settings, tried to get into the paper-thin characters, but the movie put me to sleep. Literally. The second half kept me awake, although Anna came across like a spoiled teenager. Frankly, I felt relieved when she finally jumped under the train.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor, and read the book instead. I gave this movie two stars for trying. The cinematography is beautiful and the sets and costumes are decorative.
B009NPKTN6|3.0|This is a musical, in case you didn't know.  It's not as good as you probably thought it was going to be and that comes from the top-to-bottom demograohic they are trying to appeal to in the casting.  The very weak part, depending on your age, I guess, is the two younger male and female leads.  They are nice people, but just too bland to push anything at you from the screen. I really doubt 12 year olds were flocking to see this movie, so I doubt they made any extra money by placing these two so centrally.  And it certainly did bring down the movie's critical ratings. Tom Cruise is the one you are going to be waiting for between lapses in his screen time. He leaves nothing left ungiven as usual. The one other detail that detracts from the fillm is the lipsync singing which sometimes works and sometimes flops. Zeta-Jones is good with the dance moves.

I'll keep it, but, won't be playing it much.

B001J3U22S|4.0|This book ends the prequel trilogy for Dune.<br /><br />I like the book and enjoy all the puzzles regarding how things evolved before Dune. But the book has a weak ending. When you read about the last big fight against the thinking machines your realize the story doesn't hold up. Humankind could have easily have defeated the machines without bloodshed long before the last battle.<br />Also in the last chapters a lot of characters alters their persona and you do get the feeling that it is a little rushed just to get to the ending.<br /><br />But disregarding that, this was a good book to get the background on the houses and organizations that is part of the Dune Universe. If you like Dune and are a fan of this Universe, then this is a must read.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love the versatility of repeating multiple days of the week of your own choosing. helps when you have an unusual work schedule. love setting it to use music on the kindle as my wake up alarm. great app!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This contemporary romance is an interesting take on the Vegas classic faux pax, drunk and stupid chapel wedding.  This is two smart successful people who have not been lucky in relationships because of family history.  Working out their issues is the real story and draws the reader in with good backstory and sympathy.  Most people, even with normal families, can relate to the need to get past the old childhood mind-tapes that affect our lives. These two had bad childhood trauma to work past.  This story line keeps it real and the author does a good job of expressing the emotions without resorting to melodrama.  I will look for more from Mira Lyn Kelly.  Well-done.
B003VDY7XE|4.0|I enjoyed learning of the first season.  The quality of the presentation was good although the streaming did have a momentary glitch or two.

B000VXLHWG|5.0|I purchased this blu ray box from \\"amazon.fr\\".(Kind understaning for my poor English would be highly appreciated.)<br /><br />\\"Dreams come true!\\" By having this RCO Mahler blu ray box, we can enjoy full-scope of Gustav Mahler's universe of sound even in home-audio system. Frankly speaking, conventional CD format can't afford to reproduce Mahler's extraordinary wide range of dynamics. SACD(e.g. Chailly's RCO M3 by Decca, or Ivan Fischer's BFO M6 by Channel)could provide better presentation of Mahler's symphonies. And advance of blu ray technology can make Mahler's music presented as realistic as possible.(Abbado's Lucerne Festival & Chailly's Leipzig Mahler Festival)<br />RCO Mahler box is especially notable for its 24 bits/96 khz PCM & 96 khz DTS-HD MA audio format.<br /><br />It is a little difficult to define \\"what is standard format of blu ray audio?\\" At this stage, average specification of up to now released classical music blu ray discs would be summarized as 24 bits/48 khz PCM & 48 khz DTS-HD MA. Then, what's difference between 24 bits & 16 bits? I'd say diffence of dynamics, density & power.<br />What about 48 khz & 96 khz? I'd say diffent aspects of depths, delicacy or micro-dynamics.<br /><br />1)Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra<br />Recently, RCO is regarded as the best concert orchestra(excluding opera house performance)in the world. Person by person, members of Berlinerphilharmoniker(BPO)are more virtuosic. But from the viewpoint of orchestral sound as a whole, RCO is more attractive to me. Section by section, I prefer RCO's string & woodwind to BPO. Of course, in terms of brass (specially french horn) & percussions, BPO is more reliable.<br />Additional value for this RCO Mahler blu ray box would be found with the concert hall - recording venue! Amsterdam Concertgebouw is famous for its fantastic acoustics.<br />Let me borrow some words from Lorin Maazel's blog. \\"There are no finer acoustics anywhere and there is no orchestra in the world more suited to the Mahlerian sweep and breadth requisite to a performance that should launch listeners into orbit\\"<br /><br />2)Conductors & each performance<br />Chief conductor Mariss Jansons conducted No.2(December 2009), No.3(February 2010) and No.8(March 2011). NO.3 & 8 are very satifactory, but No.2 is too mellow. After cancellation of Abbado's Lucerne M8 in 2012, and considering troubled high notes from tenor Steven Gould in Chailly's May 2011 M8, Jansons's RCO M8 performance is very outstanding & valuable recording. Janson's M3 is also excellent and RCO shows well-acquaitance with the piece.<br /><br />Among the guest conductors, Ivan Fischer(No.4 in April 2010), Lorin Maazel(No.6 in October 2010), and Eliahu Inbal(No.10 in June 2011) are impressive. Fischer successfully presented chamber music like characteristics of No.4. Maazel's No.6 reminds me of Celibidache's Bruckner performance with over 90 minutes expanded tempi. Inbal's No.10 showed how great Cook's performing version is and both conductor & orchestra showed full involvement with the piece.<br />Daniel Harding(No.1 in September 2009), Daniele Gatti(No.5 in June 2010), and Fabio Luisi(Das lied von der Erde in May 2011) showed ordinary music making, not so impressive.<br />Bernard Haitink's NO.9(May 2011)stayed within expectation.<br />No.7 with Pierre Boulez(January 2011)is a little disappointing. Playing of brass section(trumpet & french horn) is not stable and harmony between strings & winds is abnormally in trouble during outer movements(1 & 5).<br /><br />3)Technical aspects<br />Overall video quality is not impressive. What's wrong with No.7 & 9? (old film fashion?)<br />No booklets, no supplements, no traslations(alas! in No.8 very severe drawback).<br />But superb sound quality alone can justify the value of this blu ray box.<br />We can realize how fabulous RCO's playing & sound of concert hall could be.<br />Sometimes we consider Mahler's music too loud and distracting.<br />But through this blu ray box, wecan feel how beautiful Mahler's sound could be.<br /><br />4)Conclusions<br />To buy hi-fi blu ray player is reasonable action? So far, numbers of excellent software are not sufficient.<br />By this RCO Mahler blu ray release, it would be worthy to invest in expensive blu ray player.<br />I'd like to express my warmest gratitude for modest price of this box.<br /><br />But it would be very difficult for us to avoid significant side effect of this blu ray discs. After enjoying this, your ears would feel uncomfortable when listening to conventional CDs, or DVDs.

B00A3DZ61W|4.0|It was with a bit of hesitation that I picked up Angry Birds Star Wars.  The previous version (Space) was a complete disappointment to me.  There was very little serious \\"planning\\", and things like \\"zero gravity\\", and other supposed \\"space effects\\" just made it a much more random hit-or-miss game.  I've been through Angry Birds, Angry Birds Rio, Angry Birds Seasons (2011 and 2012), and Angry Birds Space.  And it has always seemed like the previous version was \\"better\\".<br /><br />Angry Birds Star Wars does a better job of returning to the earlier versions of Angry Birds.  That is, in being able to plan out an attack, and have things \\"work\\" like they're supposed to.  I do still have two issues with AB Star Wars though.  The first is a common thread through all of the AB series -- and that is the \\"scoring\\".  In virtually every other similar game that I have played (e.g., Cut The Rope, Where's My Water, Bad Piggies, Critter Rescue, etc.) -- all of which are \\"three stars for each level\\" types of games -- you always know *exactly* what you have to do to get your three stars.  Those other games clearly identify the goals necessary to achieve three stars.  (And in some, like Cut The Rope, the three stars themselves *ARE* part of the level.)  In Angry Birds, that has never been the case.<br /><br />I can play a good level, get rid of all of the piggies, destroy virtually everything...  and still get a 1-star rating for the level!!!  And points are not related to stars at all, apparently; because I've received three stars on a level with only 45,000 points, while on another level I score 100,000 points...  and get 1 star!!  It's frustrating, not knowing *how* to achieve the three-star rating, other than trial-and-error.<br /><br />The second problem I'm having (which is specific to ABSW) is game crashes.  Sometimes it's a \\"freeze\\" -- i.e., the game stops in-motion, and just freezes on the screen.  When this happens, *sometimes* I can switch to another app, or get to my desktop, and kill ABSW.  Sometimes, I'm locked into the game; NOTHING gets me out but a complete hardware reboot.  (I'm running on a Motorola Xoom with 64GB of storage, a dual-core processor, and plenty of \\"hardware\\".  It's a high-end machine.)  What's so odd is that the freezes don't even seem to be related to any interaction on my part -- such as a tap, or other touchscreen interaction.  I may have flung a bird, and while it's in flight -- it'll just stop in mid-air.  The screen will be frozen, and inaccessible.<br /><br />Of these two problems, I actually am bothered more by the first.  I can live with app crashes; \\"stuff\\" happens.  Games have glitches, and over time they'll improve.  But the first one really gets to me.  And in ABSW, for the first time, there are actually birds that I *still* do not understand how to use, or what their \\"superpowers\\" are good for.  There is only the normal 2-second \\"video\\" each time a new bird is introduced; and sometimes that's just not enough.  Words on the screen would help at that point.<br /><br />All in all, Angry Birds Star Wars is enjoyable (and much better than AB Space).  But it is getting \\"long in the tooth\\".  I'm glad that Rovio has come out with other games (particularly Bad Piggies -- a *completely* different kind of game, and a really great one).op, and kill ABSW.

B003DZX3SA|5.0|It's just as I remembered it. Great movie. Got it for my daughters, ages 10 and 5, who knew nothing about the disney classics-Pixar is all they knew.
B008K8VDPU|4.0|There are a lot of nice features in Pianist HD, not the least of which is the polytonal capabilities.  (I.e.,  you can play chords, not just single notes.  Changing the instrument voices is a plus, though I'd like to see more than just the handful of instruments that are there now.<br /><br />I'm a professional pianist, so I'm a bit jaded by apps that want to provide some measure of &#34;piano playing&#34;.  No matter how good they are, the experience is never going to be the same as sitting down at a keyboard, with keys that move, have tactile feedback to the user, etc.  (Nor will I ever choose to play anything seriously on a two-octave piece of glass.)  But for what it does, I like Pianist better than most of the other similar apps.
B00632HWOG|4.0|As above it works on my android tablet. And to have to put morr unnessary words in here just for a rateing SUCKS!no wonder things don't get rated!
B005USZML4|5.0|I read all of his books & will continue to do so.  John Grisham is interesting & that gives me enjoyment in reading.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|This is a well written book that gives a definite feel of what it would be like to hike across the country alone as a woman with only what one could carry on one's back.  Though I found myself thinking by mid-book that the story could well have been told in its entirety by then, I finished the book and was glad I did.
0425263916|5.0|The lives and turmoils of Eva and Gideon keep you wanting more.  Full fantasy for sure.  I can't wait for the 3rd book.
B009H442DG|5.0|I Love listening to Christmas music and Oliva and John made it so exciting... They are my favorite since grease...
B007Q0OUNA|4.0|This set has some great pieces - a spiral staircase, 4 mini statues, many arches, and the new brick textured bricks in tan - that will go great with any Lego castle.  Also the Nazgul with their red eyed horses are awesome figures.  Not worth the $60 retail price in my opinion but if you can find it on sale get it.
B007FQDPL8|5.0|The season that started it all.  It's perfect to start and it immediately  hooks you into the plots and the amazing vampires and other supes in the show.  I would recommended this to all my friends and family
B001USHRCK|5.0|This set is a great addition to any Medieval realm.  It is a bargain with 1600 pieces for $100, and there are so many cool detail pieces to spice up any MOC.  It is retiring soon according to Lego so get it soon if you have any interest in castle themed Lego creations.
B009LREA1S|5.0|Solid end to the series just wish it really wasn't ending.......or is it????? Have to watch it twice to catch everything.
B007Q0OUKS|4.0|I bought several of these sets to add to the Battle of Helm's Deep set.  It has some good castle building pieces, but the main plus of this set is the high amount of figures for the price.  Anyone making Lord of the Rings MOCs will find nice uses for the stuff in this set.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The first part starts out deceptively slow, then immediately ramps up to breakneck speed and never slows down! This is one of the best books I've ever read, hands down.
B009HELT3C|3.0|This movie is slow and they did not show the bad guy enough. The plot was not really that great either
B008MG1E4A|5.0|just started this one and have heard him interviewed.  need to read when it has my full concentration as this event changed all for us
B006LSZECO|5.0|Not great literature but a really good read, Exciting, gripping and I was always eager to get back to it.  Loved the way the author wrote a chapter on her perspective and then a chapter on his perspective.
B0018QOIXU|5.0|A real mood setter.  Love Adele and her unique sound  Solid voice and each song a joy to listen to
B007IXWL2C|2.0|First 2 kept my interest, somewhat, 3rd was completely boring and redundant.  Repetitiion and redundancy, how many times do we have to hear how beautiful he thinks she is and how great their sex is together.
038533348X|5.0|The book was to replace a school library book that my son lost.  It was in great condition and the school accepted it.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book peaked my interest because everyone was reading it.  It was porn to a degree and the bondage parts made me want to smack both of them but the love story was fun to read.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|If your a fan of seeing the bad guys get whats coming to them (seems to be a common trend lately) ya gotta watch both Expendables. Unlike years past, todays action flicks seem to have the same agenda, annihilate the enemy! So many movies today jumping on the bandwagon, which I think is awesome. Taken comes to mind. Couldnt stand watching some movies in the past &#34;Black Hawk Down&#34; comes to mind, where the good guys are getting destroyed......yes I understand it was based on true events, but the point is there are so many movies where the bad guys wreak havoc.
B0076DEJMO|5.0|A big fan of his writing.  This book picks up right where the others leave off.  Great job Joe look forward to more!
B008CJ0JTI|5.0|Can't beat Criterion for quality. Vast majority of places selling this blu-ray charge $40 so I was happy to secure it for $25.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|I am incredibly impressed with the fact seiko can make this very nice looking, automatic movement watch for only around $70. The fit and finish look like a watch costing much much more. I already want to buy the other colors. I've only had it a few days so can't speak to its accuracy yet, but so far it's only a few seconds ahead per day. I did find the band a little uncomfortable and replaced it with a leather one that looks great. I'm very pleased with this purchase.
B0076DEJMO|5.0|having read all six of the books in this series i think that this is the best of the three stand alone books
B000IDEORY|5.0|I remember watching this movie a long time ago and the movie is still an awesome classic plus the quality is great.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|It was a mind bending experience. Anyone who likes a challenge should read this. Totally had me wondering what truly was going on.
0345803485|5.0|Book was shipped very quickly. Great read for any adult. A must read trilogy. Very happy in making this purchase.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Great for food lovers and those who love to learn.  I love the meta learning section of the book. This section is a must read.
B001NOQI3U|5.0|I enjoyed Yentl very much. It is an eye opener onto the private lives of strict judiasm. It should be required by all to watch.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|It is very helpful to view .pdf from the Kindle.  I like the application.  Thanks for adding this to the selection of apps
B009RI4FRU|4.0|A great collection of fine actors.  The two young people were outstanding.  Good flick.  Like a Cohen brothers movie.  Makes you think.
B009HQ9UHC|2.0|It is difficult to determine the rules of the game.  I loved angry birds but this didn't meet my expectations.
B002WCLG48|5.0|my kids love this movie they keep playing it over and over the kids and games these days how they love them
B007HACDLK|5.0|Another triumpth for Vince Flynn!<br /><br />The Last Man<br /><br />I have really enjoyed every book I have read by Vince Flynn, and this one is no exception. He has a superior knowledge of our clandestine services, and uses this knowledge to add tremendous value to his novels. This particular book shows us the real danger of the fight against terrorism; knowledge unfortunately many in our country just don't understand. During the \\"Cold War\\" with the Soviet Union, we and they understood and respected Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD). Out war against radical Islam doesn't have that elemtent, since they not only don't mind dying for Jihad, but actually want to (at the lower levels - the upper levels want the young and impressionable to do the dying.) All I can say is that I truly hope there are such men as Mitch Rapp in our covert services. Our military has no equal, but they are restricted by so many rules of engagement that their effectiveness is limited. The covert services, like our CIA, et al, operate on a level that may offend some, but they are indespensible if we are to win this war. Flynn makes it very clear in his novels, and this one is one of his best yet.
B008NW67E0|5.0|I've listened to this album more than I care to admit. Mumford has definitely delivered a fine piece of work. If you haven't already picked it up, I sincerely suggest you do.
B004U7MQXS|5.0|Fantastic movie by a fantastic band! The Beatles will be remembered always, no matter what happens to this world in the future.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|Before reading this book I thought I knew it. After reading the first 5-pages I then realised I didn't have a clue. This has without a doubt changed the way I look at food and what I consume!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I really appreciated Dr. Alexander's clinical approach to the subject.<br />It's certainly a view of what comes next that many people can comprehend.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|I really enjoyed this well-written, honest memoir. I enjoyed Strayed's writing and recommend her next book, &#34;Tiny Beautiful Things&#34; after you read this to see how she's grown as a writer and person.
B00785P2QC|3.0|This is a very addicting game! I find myself constantly checking it during the day. I would definitely recommend it.
B001KDQ4KQ|2.0|I have read almost every Jodi Picoulet book and this was the first one that I didn't enjoy.  Without spoiling the story for others, I'll just say that to me the whole thing just seemed unbelievable.  Very disappointing!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|boring at first ...but I like it now. takes a little while to get the actual game started.  I just wish there were more options to get acorns without having to buy them.
B005KJZDXK|2.0|I have to admit I was disappointed when I listened to it for the 1st time.  Don't get me wrong.  I love Zooey but this CD just didn't do it for me.  The songs that are normally sang fast...she sang them slow.  The songs that are normally sang slow....she sang them fast.  The one song that I was really disappointed in was Baby It's Cold Outside.  It's supposed to be a slow sexy song and they sang it way too fast.  I still love Zooey but this CD I don't love.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|This 1st book is a very good foundation for the 3 series collection.  Well written and easy to absorb.  Multiple characters and a lot of fast action and changes.  I immediately purchased the second in the series because of book 1.
B007NU54H4|5.0|I watched this yesterday with my 8 year old granddaughter and my almost 2 year old twin boy great-grandsons whose Mom had suggested they might enjoy this because every time the promo for this was shown on tv, they kept saying quite loudly &#34;Wings, wings, wings peas! (2 year old speak for &#34;Please&#34;)&#34;  I watched with them for a while and I have to say it was both delightful and charming, while also being very entertaining.  A definite winner.
B008IYSMLY|5.0|Every season of Dexter continues to amaze me. I absolutely love this show! The quality of viewing is also excellent!
B000NYT1M6|5.0|Great product! My boys love to play outside and dig, and these trucks do the job.  They are durable and well built!
B001UV4XI8|5.0|When I opened the carton, I saw that the cover came a little cracked along the joints of the two leaves. The Bluray and dvd inside were perfect, though. Delivery was also prompt.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|After all the hype surrounding this movie, we were expecting to be completely blown away. The movie wasn't bad, per say, it just wasn't great either. It felt incredibly long and several parts seemed to drag on forever. I absolutely loved the first two movies in the trilogy, but I don't think this one measures up.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|The blu ray and dvd were both perfect and this completes my entire Harry Potter movies collection! I am so excited!
B0000266T2|5.0|This was a reunion of this fabulous duo which blended the poetic, rhymic words of Paul Simon w/ the soft ethereal plaintif voice of Art Garfunkle - and they were playing in NYC, where they both were products of the boroughs & they came together to help<br />lift NYC out of bankrupcy, and they celebrated & brought the people together for a magical night. This may be my favorite CD.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I expected so much more from JK Rowlings first book outside of her Harry Potters.  The writing was good...the characters were really hard to like and there were so many of them I needed a map and a geneololy chart.  Perhaps the tone and cadence of the book was a bit \\"british\\" and sent me off to the confusion Parrish. There was a vacancy there just for me... JK. I love you...I have MS and I like your mother am so proud of your work. This one....well....it was just too busy for an adult and too dark for a kid. In my humble opinion.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I am sooo happy I found this app. Its very cute and very fun. You don't even have to be a huge fan of the show to love this game. Many users have complained that you need to spend too much real-world money to advance very far in the game, but i disagree. I've come extremely far and only splurged a dollar! This game is great for all ages!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I wasn't sure what to think of this movie at first, but by its completion I had decided it was among my favorites. It's surprisingly touching!
B007TNS6JI|1.0|I found the game play to be fair but the game used so much memory that i could not<br />do anything else. For a game that was supposed to be made specifically for kindle i found<br />It frustrating as well as aggravating to be in the middle of gameplay and have to reset the<br />Kindle so that the memory was reset.
B004LWZWGA|3.0|Gaping plot holes, that immediately become noticeable after viewing it, Bane is not nearly as intriguing as The Joker, Too much focus on Bruce and not enough time on Batman and an extremely anti climatic ending that made no sense whatsoever. This film had excellent acting,visuals, and action but when you look past that it had a pretty poor story for the most part. Still worth a rental but this is an average film at best that doesn't live up to it's predocessor.
B007PVHMCG|2.0|It is not right that I have to explain to an eight year old why Santa can't bring Lego Minecraft.  How a toy that was once 35 dollars is now 135 dollars. I told him that bad Scrooge like Grinch people bought up all of the Lego Minecraft and were trying to make money off Christmas.  So to solve the problem we decided to make our own Lego Minecraft set by buying lego bricks in all the Minecraft colors.  Yeah, and we got them used off eBay for cheap.  Don't participate in the hype, think out side the Lego, and have a great holiday.
B00000JY1X|5.0|Wonderful set of songs.  Funny, touching, melancholy.  A lot of variety of styles, but somehow all uniquely Magnetic Fields.  This set has something for anyone who's ever been in love.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love to play bingo and I've been playing Bingo Blitz on FaceBook for several months. I really enjoy being able to play without having to pull out my laptop. I can just hook-up to Wi Fi  and play bingo.
B00AHSMDQY|1.0|I had to crank my sound way up to hear any dialog in the movie and I have a really good Harmon Kardon system.
B0075FLTV2|4.0|I had always listened to George Michael (even when he was with Wham!) and believe it or not, my daughter finally listened to him and surprise! - she wanted me to download his greatest hits. I downloaded this album for her, and she loved it! It is nice to know that a younger generation thinks that my music is not garbage! Good deal!
B00005JN2Z|5.0|I'm not a big fan of Tom C. But I love him as a bad guy in this movie. :)
B003TJR2HS|4.0|I am not an electronics expert however this stands so tall that when it is in my doc it seems like it might be damaging the port.<br /><br />That being said... It works great with my XM skydock which can lock in the phone.
B001GKJ2E8|5.0|If you love action packed movies you'll love this one. Disc was in great shape for it been used. :)
0307888908|4.0|a very quick read and a business-oriented approach combine to make this book worth the time spent reading it.  as with most books of its genre, the writing itself isn't brilliant, but the ideas are close enough to make up for it.
B000641D2Y|5.0|It's one of my favorite movies from my child hood. I watch it every year on tv since I own it now I will be watching it a lot more.
0385512058|5.0|an easy read and an important message.  everyone starting a professional career should read this book and take it to heart.  not all of the suggestions are right for everyone at all times, there's a lot of good information in these pages.  reading the whole thing gets the ideas to sink in that you can't make your own career all by yourself.  this is important information I wish I had thought about earlier in my career.  an especially important message for women who tend to think they can do it all on their own.  guess what?  we can't.
B000V63AVY|4.0|Great compilation of Supertramp's hits. My personal favorite is School, but classics such as The Logical Song and Take The Long Way Home are irresistible. There are a few filler songs that aren't as memorable as the hits, but all the favorites are there.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|A very interesting movie with great special effects and a SPECTACULAR twist of events after the credits came up. 3D quality was OK
B009SQRL4U|5.0|I love it, great movie to watch with the kids.  Mine all fell asleep and I enjoyed watching it by myself.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book was great.  Mad you feel like you were there.  The descriptions were good, could picture the people in my head
B000S56R1I|5.0|Sufjan Stevens has created a diverse, thoughtful, creative album that you will want to listen to again and again. Well done, Sufjan, well done.
007174889X|4.0|This is a great book to refer to almost any disease process. I really like Current Medical Diagnosis and Treatment better than Harrison's because I like the condensed material. However, this is a great book to gain a ton of knowledge. My professors sure do love it!
B004LWZWGA|2.0|Okay, my brother bought it and i was ready to watch it. He got home at like 8 and we watched the whole thing. It was a very long movie. Okay, if you love the fighting scenes in batman, than this movie isn't for you. I saw the first dark knight and it was probably one of the best movies i have seen and i have seen plenty. This movie sucked. Their was barely any fighting scenes, Anne Stathoway  or whatever was a big biotch the whole movie until the end, and i didn't like the story line either. This is probably one of the worst movies i have ever seen. Don't waist you money or time buying this, if you are gonna watch it, rent it instead or burrow it from someone. It was also very slow in the beginning.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|This is an entertaining movie. After reading the books, I know they had lots of room to improve. The costumes were in no way what I expected, and the people did not really seem like the characters you read about. Overall, I liked it, but for any avid reader with a good imagination-- the movies just can't cut it.
B008J9EYFG|5.0|I am a fan, so I will buy anything she puts out. For me \\"Call me the Breeze\\" is great, I can listen to that, and I am grateful she shared some of her wonder. And sets a nice backdrop for a winter day.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|Very entertaining!! However, it got so cheesy sometimes that I did not like it. I thought that it was great that they were able to keep the cast for each character. The first time I watched this, I had not seen all of the movies (like Captain America or Thor). Watching those and then watching this movie made it much more enjoyable!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This is an amazing application. I cannot express how helpful it is to have this. You will not regret buying it.
B005LAIGP0|5.0|Love this movie I watched it 5 times very nice story watch it at night<br />DVD picture is excellent high resolution blue ray is very good quality and this movie in cloud with Vudo<br />I don't have to even watch it with DVD it's in cloud.
B00992CF6W|5.0|great game recommend for everyone who like building and survival and co op games fun to play with friends hi
B004I744AS|5.0|u can us it for Spanish and other things all I have to say is I love it so much even the whole world will understand what it feels like
B009G7ZYPY|4.0|Standing Ovation is the album fans expected right after Susan Boyle almost won Britain's Got talent.  The crux of her work is just this: her voice somehow goes straight to the heart. Now that she has made the album she describes as the one she was destined to make, one can only wonder where her development as a singer will lead her next.
B008O9V4C2|4.0|Several of the tunes sound quite good and as if no attempt at perfection was spared. His lyrics make it sound like he is still having trouble tempering his ego with age.  At this point, it is not unlikely that Mr. Fagen will be reincarnated as a metronome.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I did like this series, don't get me wrong. It was my first series for reading any erotica. I have had suggestions to check the Claiming of Sleeping Beauty series, which I am. I liked this series better so far. I liked that fact that there was story fill with erotic moments. It wasn't all just a bunch of sex. It was a really easy read, so I was through it quickly. The characters were easy to attach to. I would consider more by this author and more erotica like this series.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Friends had recommended this show, and I hesitated... Didn't know if I would like English TV or Masterpiece Theatre... What a surprise!  I was drawn in from the moment I started watching and had to pry myself away... I fell in love with the characters and hated some, and was always curious to know what would happen  next!  So much so that I watched two seasons in TWO days!!
B005F3XV62|5.0|We love this movie.  Family friendly, great message about people and relationships but not so deep the kids won't like it.
B000002J0N|4.0|great service got what i wanted in quality. it came in the mail a little later than what i expected but with hurricane sandy i understand.

B006S039YU|5.0|The story line was real good. My daughter loved this movie. I would recommend this movie to young viewers. Excellent!

0345803485|4.0|Actually I loved all three (3) book, but don't want E.L. James to get a big head.  Just Kidding.  I actually felt I got to know the subjects and liked them, but felt sorry for them at the same time.  Glad they worked things out.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|This is a Christmas present for one of my family member and they love watching movies with their familys A
0345803493|4.0|Review is the same for Fifty Shades Freed.  Well written for what is being written about.  I liked the plot.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Excellent first person account.  The Author starts as a sympathetic character, and ends up an inspiration to anyone struggling in their own life.
0061537969|5.0|I picked up this book because a close friend recommended it. I love dogs, so I expected to enjoy it. I did indeed enjoy it very much, but it's far more than a book about a dog. It's a story about a family who suffers a terrible loss of more than one kind and ultimately triumphs. The story is  tender, heartwarming, heartbreaking, and very appealing, especially when presented through the every loyal and devoted perspective of Enzo--the family's beloved Golden retriever. Highly recommeded.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is a great read.  From the first few sentences, it gets your attention.  Part science fiction, part mystery, but all with a good thread linking it.  The story takes you where it wants you to go, not where you were expecting, and it keeps you reading.  In short, it is what you want a fun-read book to be.
B0088O11NU|1.0|force close and uninstall, why did it force close and uninstall, force close and uninstall, force close and uninstall, force close and uninstall!!
B0056JJ1M8|5.0|This is a movie that my husband can watch over and over again, as for me i watched this film for the first time and i really enjoyed it. For any women thinking that this is a guy film your very wrong! Just sit and give this film a try you wont want to miss a single minute of it.
B000058983|5.0|I did not know of Love during the 60's being pretty obsessed with Dylan, The Beatles and The Stones at that time. Picked up a copy of Forever Changes on the advice of a close friend in the 90's and bought this expanded version just recently. It is all that people say it is-a brilliant tour de force and a genuine classic. Wonderful music and amazing lyrics from Lee and Maclean, two of Rock's most underrated writers. Just buy it!
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is very gun and addicting. I'm surprised and happy that its free. this is one of my favorite games to play.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I loved the charactersand the historical references.  Just enough fantasy elements to entertain but not overwhelm.  I hope there's a sequel.
B000YHE4AG|4.0|I can't help myself. This movie is really great. It's charming and warm. The saccharine ending was a little over the top for me, but I can live with it. It really is a masterpiece.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Arrived on time. This is going to be a Christmas gift to my boyfriend and i know hell love it!
B000HAB4KS|5.0|Being, apparently, one of the last people on Earth not to have seen \\"The Matrix\\", I finally caught up with my fellow man the other day and watched it for the first time.  I now understand firsthand what all the fuss was about at the time, and why there were several sequels, and why the movie has remained a favorite sci-fi film of many aficionados of the genre.  I can also see why a few people dislike it.  I think it is worthy of the adjective \\"classic\\", but it also has a few flaws.<br /><br />The plot's central element comes from a classic question posed in Philosophy 101 class (at least it was posed in mine), the \\"brain in a vat\\" problem:  if the brain is the center of all consciousness, and gets all its impressions of the outside world from bodily sensors attached to the brain via nerves, how can one prove that the outside world actually exists and that your brain is not actually just sitting in a vat bathed in fluid, with an evil genius stimulating your nerves to give the appearance of the outside world?  To this decades-old philosophical question some modern-day cyberworld twists are added, including the rise of machines with artificial intelligence and the preference that some people (many people?) have these days to spend more time in cyberspace than its physical world counterpart (meatspace).  The result is a compelling plot line for \\"The Matrix\\", but one that requires more than a little suspension of disbelief.<br /><br />This is one of the flaws of \\"The Matrix\\": to make a compelling movie, it needs to be possible for characters to re-enter the artificial world and for events in the artificial world to have a correspondence to events in the physical world.  Yet I don't think this would be the case if an  artificial world were to be created.  It also is a bit hard to believe that human bodies are good generators of energy, the explanation given for why the evil geniuses are keeping so many humans alive with their brains trapped in the artificial world.  By contrast \\"Blade Runner\\", my favorite sci-fi film, has an entirely plausible scenario and plot that needs only technology that hasn't yet been invented in order for the story to ring true.<br /><br />The other flaw of \\"The Matrix\\" is Keanu Reeves.  Reeves is a polarizing actor that rubs some people the wrong way.  Given his persona, the way he carries himself and his manner of speaking, he would seem best cast as a laid-back California slacker, yet he is often (as is the case in The Matrix) given heroic roles.  I can accept this for this film, but I can see why others can't.<br /><br />The best performance in The Matrix by far is Laurence Fishburne in the role of Morpheus.  Admittedly this is an even more heroic role than Reeves' character of Neo, but Fishburne does an outstanding job with it.  He truly commands the screen with his presence, actions and voice; it is a remarkable performance.  Many of the supporting roles are also well-acted, especially Morpheus' band of renegades (with the exception of the character of Mouse, whom I didn't care for).<br /><br />All in all \\"The Matrix\\" is definitely worth seeing if you happen to have been living in a cave for the past 13 years and haven't yet seen it.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Great kickoff to Season 3. If you're a fan of zombie flicks then this is the show for you. Excellent!
B004I744AS|5.0|Great descriptions and as an added bonus gives the word's historical and gramatic roots.  Having the device speak the word is good too.
B004GVUPFE|2.0|I didn't like it,  the &quot;hint&quot; feature sucked. I played for about five mintues and removed the app from my device.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I dare say, after a few bumps, Mr. Grisham is back in the saddle and riding hell for leather.  He can develop an idea with the best of them and this book brings us back to some of the earlier writings that held our interest from the first to last page.
B006ZWLXZ8|4.0|As the Leonard Cohen album, but I very much like Blue Jeans, one of the cuts on the CD.  I'm looking to listen to the rest.
B0084U0IEG|4.0|I have never read this author before, but I was glad to have done so in this instance.  I was well done and captured my interest on the second page and held it from that point forward.  The idea was a good one and the development was engaging.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|Can only speak from my own experience as a gamer but the programmability of the G13 allows for whatever configuration you want.  I use mine to simulate the ICP on a virtual F-16.  Didn't take long at all to program the software to have it do exactly what I wanted it to do.
0761169253|5.0|I have enjoyed reading this book and others on developing creativity. We are a knowledge based society and the arts or creativity is what will allow us to be set apart in the global market place. Austin has given us the okay to go ahead and develop or steal our ideas from others around us. I have now gone and developed a creative room on where I will develop my creative mind, and I stole it from this book!
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|The cable worked fine.  The one this was replacing, however, appeared to be some sort of manufacturing defect as the insulation just started crumbling and exposing bare wires.  I was not charged for the cable, but I was charged for the shipping, which was supposed to be credited to my account--which was not done.
B009GESJH2|5.0|I love this man and his new Rebal Soul CD.  It did not get damaged in the mail.  It was wrapped and secured.
B009SJ46EA|5.0|I enjoyed Season 1, but felt it was way to drawn out and really could have ended sooner.  After a while, it really got boring. However Season 2 seems to get better with every episode. I could do without the alien abduction bit, but I really do like the serial killer and religious/demonic aspects of this season.  I've always had a \\"thing\\" for asylums and exorcisims in my horror stories, so this season really takes the cake for me.
B009SPWWCM|5.0|I'll be the first to admit I don't like every album Neurosis puts out. Some of their stuff is so experimental I just can't get into it. The last album of theirs I really wore out was A Sun That Never Sets. Not that I didn't enjoy some of their songs since then, but the two albums I bought after that I never really listened to very much. The song \\"The Eye of Every Storm\\" was phenomenal, but the album as a whole I couldn't get into. With only 7 songs I was a little apprehensive about buying Honor Found in Decay but those fears were immediately laid to rest. From the very start I could tell this was going to be well worth it. I used to listen to Neurosis for hours at a time when I was younger. Instead of turning on the TV or playing video games, I would crank up the stereo and spin album after album of Neurosis music. It has always been such a trip to really let myself become immersed in their music. This album is the first one since Times of Grace that I could play from start to finish and just let it take me away to a place that no other music has ever taken me. I missed that. Thanks Neurosis. Tour more.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|VERY CLICHE BUT FUN TO WATCH.<br />ALL MY FAVORITE ACTION STARS WERE IN IT.<br />WELL PUT TOGETHER ACTION MOVIE.<br />I ENJOYED IT.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Susan Boyle has another million seller. She is  fantastic, I enjoyed each and every track. My young grandchildren also like this very much.<br />They have an appreciation for good music. We play the Three Tenors all the time.
B000IZ21BS|5.0|Funny and suspenseful  silly also frightening good movie over all I hope to see the rest of the sires pease
B009O2XY12|5.0|fun and keeps me busy<br />i like the bright colors which makes it easier to see<br />easy game to stay focused on
B0038LB4TE|5.0|Simple beginnings always lead to an intriging story with lots of action.The author must keep these books coming at regular intervals.
B004EKCNMA|5.0|A wonderful retelling of the classic Christmas tale. Though it has a dark theme there were several funny moments to go along with the ones that make you jump!
B0084FBD86|5.0|Polar Shift . This is an excellent story,fast moving and plausible.  Likeable characters that one can relate to. A  good buy.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|Cant wait to open this gift, three movies we love and a great price!  Got it on sale, and a refund from pre order to!  Thanks Amazon, I will put my slippers on and watch all three after Christmas with the family!
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|This movie was perfect, Tommy was \\"that guy \\"and Meryl was so heartful in her character. I want to watch it again already with my boyfriend and will be recommending it to others. I felt for them and with them as they went though their journey,  And bravo to Steve for being so different then we are use to seeing him, and doing a great job. We all need a little help now and then and this movie is that. We can all relate in one way or the other.
B00845POUO|5.0|Very good movie, I have watched three times already.  Not what I expected at all, very hard edged, very graphic, and very powerful!  Lots of real life in this, no sugar coating and happy ending church stuff here.  They pulled no punches, and in the end  its about justice. Be careful with kids, or your church group, it has a lot of bad language and graphic content, sex, and drugs, but its real, and well acted.  Great job Gerard, and thanks for a real look into ministry and trying to make a difference!  Buy it.
B004P91ARE|5.0|It's a classic and beautiful jazz album. If you love jazz, you should have this one as part of your collection.
B00A7CI82I|5.0|This was the best Bourne since the first one, back before Dammon went off the deep end into propaganda and political opinion movies.  The story was good, and Renner was spot on in his emotional performance.  He played the character in changing states of ability and IQ, very well, and managed to be a hero again even after the guns and motorcycle chases!  I hope we get another one soon!
B008XOXGCO|5.0|I am really enjoying the latest album by The Script.  Personally I like this one better than the first and second but I know others may disagree.  I hope they keep making such great albums.
B008458O3S|5.0|Plays smoothly and the tracks are not easy. Takes a few sittings to beat it all. Fun on the kindle fire.
141694737X|1.0|My baby loves flap books, however, here the flaps are too small and the items are uninteresting. He doesn't care at all about this book compared to other flap books we have.
B004RE29PO|5.0|To me, this is the best of the 4 movies. I have always liked this film & enjoy watching it time & time again. The Blu-Ray is pretty good, with some minor grain throughout. The picture quality is much better than the Dvd. For me it is definitely worth having. The audio sounded real good to me, although I listen through external speakers hooked up to my old fashioned stereo system. There are also {2} versions of the movie on this disc. I prefer the extended version myself. As far as special features go there is a Commentary, Deleted Scenes & {2} Musical scores. Overall I would say if you don't want all {4} movies but maybe just this one like me, than I say go ahead & get it. I'm sure you will like it. One last thing. I wish they would have made this in 2:40:1 aspect ratio rather than the 1:85:1. I would have liked to have seen more of the movie & think it would have looked better. This is my opinion though.
0689835604|4.0|My 8 months old absolutely loves this book. He laughs every time he uncovers the flap. The only negative, the flaps are pretty weak for a baby grip. We already had to reattach several pages. But he loves the book so much!
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I read 50 shades before I read these... What a difference in writing! The Crossfire novels are well written, unlike the constant word and phrase repeating in the 50 shades series. I defnitely recommend these :) Can't wait til May !
1401207138|4.0|This is a really cool and gritty series to add to your collection. Unfortunately mine came with a bent in corner on the case from shipping. I realize now i should have complained and asked for a new one, but at the time i was more excited to read it and didn't want to wait any longer.
0425263908|4.0|I read 50 shades before I read these... What a difference in writing! The Crossfire novels are well written, unlike the constant word and phrase repeating in the 50 shades series. I defnitely recommend these :) Can't wait til May !
B00116GHMM|5.0|These guys are very talented and provide great listening. This whole record is great and easily one of my favorites.
B003SI7OQ4|5.0|My 5 year old son loves this movie so much we have rented it over 5 times. By this time, we should have just purchased it.<br />The story is quirky and at the same time relatable. The humor is made for small children, but grown ups will also enjoy the meaning behind the story: a broken father-son relationship that is restored through quite an adventure.
B002GU45YO|5.0|This is a great record. I am from Michigan and have seen Mayer Hawthorne several time live now in his hometown. Every song on this record is great.
B001IYCMNA|4.0|Have same one in office, purchased this for home use after older WAP died.  No problems, easy to use.  Expect it will work as well as the one in the office.  Reasonable price vs performance for a unit.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Very good read.The  Worst part about this book is that you can't wait to read the next one :). A must read.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|The adobe reader opens up all of my PDF files just as it would on my home computer or laptop.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Once again another awesome book from Tim. some much information in nice sections and easily followed. Much like the 4 Hour Body. he allows you to jump around or read straight through.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|I really enjoyed watching this movie. Since I raised both of my daughters to be strong, independent young ladies, I saw our relationships unfold throughout this Disney animated story.
B002CGLX3S|5.0|I love the song.  My 9 year old granddaughter insisted that I get it for her.  It is a good quality recording.
B001EC0OMM|5.0|I loved old, classic movies.  Since this was a movie I have enjoyed from my youth what a bonus to add it to my Kindle library.
0590535986|5.0|This was a super cute book.  I think it was simply too simple for my daughter.  She liked it at first but grew tired of it fast.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|if i didn't already have an alarm clock it would work quite well so it will be perfect when i travel
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I love this game! i couldn't be a more pleased customer! I have played it with friends for the past couple weeks and everybody i introduce this game to, they all love it and ask where i got it from! Such a fun game to play and is a very different game. i love how the game board can change at anytime. the different resources can change places and the number dots. It's like you play a different game every time because the board is always changing. and as the board changes so does the strategy. i don't see one person dominate in this game. it seems like everybody wins equally.<br />Great christmas present!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I have read the trilogy three times already! I can't seem to put the books down.. This last one took me longer to read then the first two but still a great read!
B004SBX112|4.0|My Grandson loved this game and he plays it with such passion, besides it keeps him entertain  and the love he has for the game lead me to believe that the game has to be an awesome game, therefore I gave it four stars!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I have read the trilogy three times already, I Can't stop!! Love love love the books! It's not all that well written but the story does capture you and I found it difficult to put down!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Probably plays even better on the larger screen, but my 7&#34; Fire HD was enough to pass the time enjoyably.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|A wonderful production of this amazing musical. Anyone who appreciates the music of Les Miserables will love this DVD. I'll watch it over and over.
1848378963|5.0|What a great story. I can't believe I heard about it totally by accident, and I am an avid reader. Written in 1860, it has never been out of print!  Suspense, mystery, deception, love...it's got it all.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|This book keeps you trying to figure out what is going on with this guy. In the end its not what you think.....
B000JML90Y|5.0|Much of this work is now common knowledge, but the details of the refined argumentation are still very interesting.<br />It is easy for a non-biologist (or naturalist as Darwin calls them) to follow the reasoning.<br />Overall, it is a very enjoyable read.
B008OOYALE|4.0|Dragon Story is a great fun game.  However it locked up and keeps telling me that I have a network connection problem.  There is no network connection problem as I don't have that same problem with Restaurant and Bakery Story.  Does anyone have a solution to this problem???
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Fricken love this series.  Can't wait for season two to come out in February.  Would recommend to anyone who like this type of shows.
1469984202|5.0|Being a big fan of futurist stories of all kinds, I was delighted when I discovered this collection of stories in the Kindle section while looking for something new to read. The characters were compelling and I could relate to them all; the desire to keep things in stasis because disruption is so messy, the deep need for change in spite of the disruption, change in order to have a future we can pretend we create or control, the need to protect those we love and value, pride in a job well done and our tendency to pin so much of our identity to the work we do, a struggle to find ourselves important somehow in the Big Picture of existence.<br />In many dystopian themes the weather, a dictator, or a delusional conspiracy of narrow minds, brings about the resulting state of collapse, destruction and the crisis of finding ways to survive it all. I always enjoy seeing how an author presents the creative innovations made by the characters in order to survive and make progress toward something better.<br />This series of stories was richly rewarding in all the themes and found the humanity among the wastelands of this particular scenario.<br />Well done! I am so looking forward to the next installment and in exploring this authors other work.
B003QWRA3Y|5.0|Julianne Moore was really good in this movie.  The film has a surprise ending that keeps you guessing to the very end.  Wonderful movie.
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|I am not a big Batman fan, but I do like Christian Bale, so for me watching is movie is not a big thrill.  There were parts of the movie that I could not understand a word of what they were saying, especially with the villain Bane's lines.  I would say that it is worse than previous Batmans I watched.
B000OVPTAG|5.0|for once i got to actually enjoy a great book at that time period but from the women's perspective. not only was it written with great grammar to that time, but i was easy reading. truly captivating from start to finish. a wonderful book to add to anyone's collection!! go-go buy it!!<br />[[ASIN:0345350499 The Mists of Avalon]]
1587613379|4.0|I recommend this book to anyone who is not brainwashed by their society or religion. It's a great book for open minded people. Not perfect but still interesting to read. Fast shipping from Amazon too.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|It was a little hard to get into at first, but after the first chapter or so I started enjoying it. The thing I like most is that it is written differently from the average book.
B008B11R1Q|3.0|I got it shipped very fast, in perfect condition (new). It's just not that great of an album compared to the XX's first album.
B0035LJZ1Q|5.0|I am not a fan of scary movies, but this was just the right amount of suspense and thrill. I recommend watching it.
B00000634L|4.0|The CD is great. The plastic cover and the paper inside shows minimal signs of use. No other problems, happy to have it
B001OGWY1W|5.0|Well done all-round.  Only sorry that Harvey and Rachel didn't have opposite roles.  Primary actors played their roles very convincingly.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|This album is great. I listen to it all the time. Didn't watch American idol, but heard him on an interview and so glad that I did.
B00AHSINKO|3.0|While Meryl Streep can do no wrong (and hasn't done wrong in this film), this film overall was lacking depth.  The first 20 minutes or so of the film are very depressing, followed by a slightly less depressing middle part of the film, and more depression towards the end, with one bright moment in the last 5 minutes of the film (part of which plays during the credits).  Steve Carrell plays his part solidly, and Tommy Lee Jones nails his character- but unfortunately his character was written as more of a drasticly exaggerated charicature of a grumpy old male spouse, rather than  realistic one.  If you're 50 years old or older, you may get some mindless enjoyment out of this film for what it is (and this is the demographic it was really written for), but it lacks in many areas and isn't very enjoyable for anyone younger than that.
B0095J0AL6|5.0|I love one direction !! Not obsessed, I'm dedicated ! 4 Brits and 1 Irish making music is AMAZAYN !!
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|Mumford & Sons is on high rotation on my ipod. I love the folksy music, and the emotionally-charged sultry voices. Babel is a great album.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Really liked this movie, great story & lots of action. I would recommend to everyone. Great for kids to watch.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|Mumford & Sons plays often on my ipod. I love the instruments, and the emotionally-charged lyrics. This band will keep you listening for hours, finding deeper meaning in the lyrics.
B00447L4JG|5.0|A movie that embodies tim burtons finest. Very cute, even though its off in the strange side of things and imagination
B003QTSMXE|5.0|Love this movie. This is one of my three yr olds favorites!  So glad it was a 99¢ rental for 48 hours!
B0094BB4TW|2.0|It works for the most part, but there are some bugs. When I like something, it shows I liked it for about two seconds and then changes from unlike to like again.  Also, the news feed turns into a different distorted format when I scroll to the bottom of the page.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|This app works great!  I use it to entertain my three yr old.  He loves it!  He has even figured out how to make videos with it.
B002K0WBXW|5.0|I love this movie with Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds, but didn't like the performance of the actor who played Ryan's father.  He was &#34;Coach&#34; on that TV show.  Sweet guy.  But not in this movie.  Not good for his image as an actor.  We all loved him on &#34;Coach&#34;,but not in The Proposal.  Glad that it had a happy ending..
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Facebook app works great.  App is very responsive and loads very quickly. Glad this app was already installed on my kindle fire hd.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|The package arrive early. It was a wonderful movie. Well packed also. Curse the required amount of words. Two more.
B005OCFGTO|3.0|It may be on DVD but the quality of this sucks. Would not have bought it if I had known how poor the picture quality was. Like watching it on youtube where it jumps between 480 and 720 and back.
B0043D2L9S|5.0|I own this harness as well as the &#34;swat vest&#34; offered by Lowepro. I use the harness for outdoors events due to breathability or when I feel like working light. I have nothing but good things to say about this product and would give the S&F series my highest recommendations.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|It is good movie with different theme. Screen play and cinematography  was amazing i liked the movie.<br />I can recommend it.
B002PQ7JQK|4.0|I also jumped at the chance to get the blue ray set when the price was temporarily lowered to just over $100.  I haven't checked everything yet, but what I've sampled so far has worked as advertised.  The only thing I find a bit annoying is the little icon that pops up in the upper corner when they show the enhanced scenes.  I don't know if that's caused by the disk or my player and I haven't figured out how to suppress it.  It also took a little bit to figure out how to navigate to the different episodes.  If I find any serious flaws as others have mentioned, I'll try to pass it along.
B00004YRQA|5.0|I got the product earlier than expected, and it works perfectly. However there was a bit of writing on the label part, but that could be easily covered and it did not bother me.
B007DIQC90|5.0|This was purchased as a Christmas gift - I've no idea whether she'll enjoy it or not. I'm not familiar with Of Monsters and Men.
B005CRQ4GU|2.0|This diaryof wimpy kid wasn't the BEST diary of a wimpy kidof all the series, but It was still a little good
B001DJLCRC|5.0|This is a tv series that I think airs on amc on cable. I had never heard of this series before and watched on a recommendation from a friend. From the very first scene of the first episode I was hooked on the series. The first episode is full of action and a very intriguing introduction to the series. The main character is diagnosed with cancer and begins an unusual path as a result. The show has endless possibilities where they can take the story line I can't wait to see! Be warned though it has some pretty graphic subject matter and violence at times. I'm pretty sure there is content in the complete season release that would not have made it to cable, although cable is pretty liberal lately. Anyway, this is defiantly a guilty pleasure that is addicting as it is controversial and I have already ordered the next season in anticipation of what will happen next.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|So boring and predictable.  More of the same old stuff.  I wanted to throw them all in the fireplace.  This author got a lot more credit and publicity than these books deserved.  The first one was tolerable but don't bother with the second two.
B002QCAXOS|2.0|Amusing, weird a  good watch if you cant' sleep at night.  I would say it should be in the comedy section not thriller!
B007IXWKUK|2.0|This book is just more of the same inane arguing and make up sex as the original book.  It's barely tolerable.  By book three I wanted to throw them all in the fireplace.
B00AHSIQWE|1.0|Other than Anne Hathaway's performance, this movie is a complete waste of time. The plot is ridiculous, even for a comic book movie. The art direction and cinematography is dreary gloomy and boring. This is a movie searching for a point, yet attempting to be profound or even sensical. It fails. The film single-handedly makes one wonder whether Nolan's prior success was a fluke or whether he has had a brain transplant since the first movie. Bale's Batman is a weak and feckless. Fusion of the Dark Knight Returns and Bane storylines was ill-conceived and poorly executed. What you end up with is a three hour movie that should've been one and a half hours long with a tight story and a point. You can almost see Nolan attempting to be relevant or profound. His film is neither. It is a colossal piece of garbage.
1400069289|4.0|This is a worthy read.  Lots of information and very readable.  I recommend it for anyone who wonders &#34;why did I 9or they) do that?&#34;
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Really helps you keep track of your current charge level, but in detailed fashion, helps track for you how much battery life is left. Simple easy, straight forward to use.
B005HSL626|5.0|I love this game it is a awesome game to play I love playing it when I just want to be alone
0439023491|5.0|I bought this to complete the series for a sick friend of mine.  I had already read the entire trilogy, so I knew that it was good.  That's about all I can say about the book.
B0091V6TF4|4.0|This is a fantastic product and I would recommend it to anyone interested in great music. I would have, however, liked to have seen Adele's &#34;Skyfall&#34; included.
0761169431|5.0|My 10 year old grandson loved it and he is not easily entertained.  Great for a young Star Wars fan.
B0098JJYZQ|5.0|I cannot wait for the 3rd book. love the characters. I know that bow ties suit professors, but dont like this on Gabriel, this makes him sound old
0385535147|1.0|Ridiculous plot. Too many unecessary characters and ridiculous plot changes.  WAY too long.  10 hours of my life I'll never get back.  John Grisham used to be a great, suspenseful writer.  Now he's just phoning it in.
B008KMHFJY|5.0|Just loved it. Was sad when I finished reading it. Cannot wait for the next book to be on the shelves
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|i love minecraft  but cant get it on my kindle without paying for it so i thought i would get this but its kind of a rip-off evrn thougb u dont haf to pay for it. i guess its fun but u only get 15 min to play and i think thats stupid u cant even build a house so i would make it atleast an hour. oh and pig atack u what the heck?
0679314784|5.0|But I have to with this one.  This reminds me of Graham Greene's \\"The Human Factor\\".  Not a crackling, action packed spy thriller but one that keeps one transfixed nonetheless.  The secret is in the author's attention to detail, yet it's not overly wordy.  The characters are multi-dimensional yet not overly exposed; there's still room for the reader to to read into the character what one chooses.<br /><br />A good dose of historical information keeps one learning something about how WWII spies operated as one goes along. The unusual relationship between a mother and daughter also give a freshness to the tale.  There are a couple of threads which I was not sure were integral to the story...one involving an Iranian.  But the main story kept me turning the pages and I finished it in only a few sittings.  I love Boyd's style and will look up more of his books.
B008Y1YJ90|5.0|One movie you will watch with your children every Christmas!  It's about believing in who you are and loving those who are different then you!
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I found myself flipping through all the sex parts after the first chapter. It all was the same in each setting. I did enjoy the actual story.
B005IQZB14|5.0|This was an inspired book about a girl who has lost her way in her life and needs the reality of  traveling the often tough and unforgiving Pacific Crest Trail to regain her focus. The trail is not always obvious and snow, ice and hurdles stand in the way but moving forward is a must to accomplish the goal. Meeting people along the way is a good thing but Cheryl is determined to pursue this quest on her own without the need or desire of people hiking with her. Being alone on the trail is the story and her growth from it. Well written and never a lull in the story
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I absolutely love this author.Couldn't put the book down until it was finished. I look forward to more books by her.
B004A8ZX28|3.0|If you like fast-paced action flicks and don't expect too much in the way of plot, you will enjoy this movie. The amnesia plot got pretty dumb by the end.

075669812X|5.0|This is one of the latest DK LEGO books that show all the minifigures and vehicles of a particular LEGO building set series, this time Ninjago.  It seems to be complete up to the 2012 sets and does a nice job of storytelling of sets and the adventures from the TV series on Cartoon Network.  Add in an exclusive Green Ninja minifigure in the cover, and its a winner.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|When I first got my kindle fire HD I had a little trouble telling if it was charging and thankfully saw this by suggestion. It was free so I thought, hey? What the heck?<br /><br />Ever since then I have not one regretted getting this.<br /><br />Highly recommended. Definitely worth it.<br /><br />Get it get it get it! It's free so if you don't like it, don't know why you wouldn't, you don't loose anything.
B0043A0PXU|5.0|My wife loves this CD by Lennox with her unique musical style performing christmas songs.  There are mostly well known tunes with a few oddball thrown in to spice it up.
B003XSSR4W|5.0|The story of Badfinger is a cautionary tale for the ages. These guys did everything wrong.Trusted the wrong people,hired the wrong manager,signed the wrong contracts,etc. But when it came to making music there were few acts in the 70's that could touch them. If you only have one Badfinger album in your collection it needs to be this one...Straight Up. You can certainly hear The Beatles influence ( George Harrison produced some tracks and even played slide guitar on Day After Day ) but this was the album where Badfinger really started to come into their own. This is one of those rare albums that you can put on and just let it play all the way through. Not a weak track on the thing. After purchasing this I would recommend their final album with the original line-up and also the final album for Warner Bros....the album Wish You Were Here. Yeah I know but skip the Pink Floyd album of the same name and spend the money on Badfinger's release. These guys knew how to make power pop. They just didn't know how to run their own career.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|The animation is done very well. The story is nice too. Amazon streaming (HD on Cable Internet) was seamless. We just bought a Samsung 65&#34; 3DTV. I wish I had tried the 2D-&#62;3D up convert and watch it. I am not sure if it would have worked with the streaming movie. Overall, enjoyed the movie, probably more so on a great TV.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|I love it!!! I couldn't keep my eyes away from the book! I know that it's a sad book, but I think it's awesome!!! ;) I can't wait until I get the next book in the series...
B0051T46XM|5.0|This is a movie that I think some people will really be into, but others won't at all.  When I first saw the trailer, I thought that is was pretty lame and cheesy, but the more I watched it, the more I knew I had to see it.<br /><br />Personally, I think it's about as legitimate as someone can make a movie about trolls actually existing.  This is not a slight at all and I personally really love this movie.  So much so I bought it on Bluray even though it's on Netflix.<br /><br />As for the specifics, the story is pretty good, for a mockumentary, it seemed pretty real for a group of students hunting trolls.  I also thought that the special effects were really good.  I wasn't really expecting the quality of it and I thought it was a really real way to show what trolls &#34;actually&#34; are.  Also, unlike movies like cloverfield, the recording is much less shaky than other movies shot in this manner.  They do run around a lot, but they use a high quality camera with night vision and such to great effect.<br /><br />This movie was actually pretty tense at some points and definitely sucked me in.  Overall, I would really recommend this movie for anyone who is into sci fi or just looking for an interesting movie.  Look past the initial cheesy-ness and watch it.<br />**Note, this movie is subtitled, but there isn't a lot of conversation, so you really don't notice much.
B007SUW24W|5.0|I fell in love with &#34;The A Team&#34; and decided to purchase this album.  I love it, it's now on my list of favorite albums.  Love his voice, the words, the music.  I like all the songs, but favorites besides the A Team are &#34;Drunk&#34;, &#34;Small Bump&#34;, &#34; Give Me Love&#34; and probably replacing &#34;A Team&#34; as my favorite is track 11, &#34;Kiss Me&#34;.  Certain songs are reminiscent of Jason Mraz, one reminds me a lot of James Blunt, but he's his own artist and I'm looking forward to his next album.
B0044CBMVG|5.0|I love amazon instant video!  When I miss an episode of a show I'd rather pay a few bucks than have to hunt it down and worry about viruses!
B00AHSINKO|5.0|A very effective movie to use over & over as a marriage<br />Therapy tool. So many (too many) couple's are bogged down<br />In their marriage.
B001DDBCUA|5.0|This was a fantastic price, it shipped really quickly and it was really well packaged!  I purchased it along with the 2nd movie!
B001AII4RM|1.0|If you've read and loved Beowulf, don't watch this.  It's not true to the original at all - not even close.  Beowulf's character was sold out for enhanced palatability to the masses.  The whole movie was done in CG which was distracting and downright laughable in places - a very poor choice from my point of view.  Just another Hollywood murder of a classic to contribute to the dumbing down of the masses.
B0089AD8IO|5.0|Starting our Who collection, this was a really fantastic lightening deal price!  This will be one of those 'gift for us' Christmas presents! :)
0061992860|5.0|Lots of good info, tiny stores every where.  Read 10 pages every nite before bed.  Then store with survival gear for quick reference
B0011UBDTK|5.0|I caught this in the best deals category and was stoked to find this at such a great price.  I finally caved and bought myself an awesome Christmas 'me' gift!
B008AK8FHM|1.0|I think what I found most unbelievable was when the girl on the butterfly wing said it doesnt matter what we do here on earth. We are loved anyway. While I believe we are loved everything we do is nott okay. If there is no right or wrong what is the point.We can do whatever we want without consiquences.I will be sure to tell my kids that while I am raising them.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|Draw Something FREE! I like the price ;)<br />It is fun and has lots of cool colors. Challenging and interesting.But beware....very addicting. . .
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Our grandsons just love to play this game. They play it on our kindles. It keeps them busy for hours.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|A fitting end to The Dark Knight... certainly worth watching, especially if you enjoyed the first two movies in this trilogy.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Our grandsons just love to play this game. They play it on our kindles. It keeps them busy for hours.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I loved the idea of the book.  The sheer fact that a neurologist survives a bizarre near death experience and then correlates his experience the science of the brain appealed to my own scientific mind.  The indescrible events would be difficult for even the best writer to tackle and I give the author credit for his attempt.  His story is powerful, amazing and demands to be told. The problem with the book is that it is obvious that he is not a writer by training.  I give the book five stars based on the content, but it is difficult to read at times.  It's short and worth your time based on the incredible message, but just remember that he is a doctor and not an author by training.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|What a marvelous story. It certainly gives a person hope for life after death. I can hardly wait to see for myself.
0439023513|5.0|awesome series! it held my interest the whole time, could not wait to turn the page to see what would happen next.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Our grandsons just love this version. They would play it 24/7 if we would let them. I highly recommend it.

B001VIMCW4|2.0|Some of the low lights:<br /><br />-Too much bouncing between countries.<br />-Too hard to understand what they're saying (we finally ended up turning on the closed captioning)<br />-Poorly defined villain (wow; he wants to dam up the water and create a scarcity.  Not exactly the hard nose cliff hanger type of &#34;No, Mr. Bond. I expect you to die&#34; villain of years past).<br />-No one really to route for/against - everyone could have been blown up and it wouldn't have mattered.
0439023521|5.0|awesome series! it held my interest the whole time, could not wait to turn the page to see what would happen next.
0767827902|5.0|A movie by a great director its fun to see actors and actresses before they became famous! again great movie!
B009O2XY12|4.0|its awesome but when you run out of bubbles it will tell you you need to either pay gems or quit but other than that its amazing
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love my Pinterest and the inspiration it provides. Since joining, I've learned how to make skirts, alter tees, make chalkboards, address cards, redecorate my home office, and plan all my favorite holidays. Did I mention cooking? The list of inspiring ideas goes on. It really should be called Pinspiration!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Upon completing this book (which was a struggle to say the least), my immediate response was to wonder if I could get my money back.  Not only is this book poorly written, but its premise of providing some sort of foray into a seldom discussed world is completely false.  I did read other's reviews of this book and am disappointed in myself that I did not take them to heart, believing that a best seller couldn't possibly be that bad.<br /><br />Oh, fellow readers, it IS that bad.  Please do not succumb to the hype this book has garnered (how, I have no idea).  In an attempt to create something that, I'm assuming, is supposed to empower women on some level, the author manages to do the complete opposite.  I invite her to return to the 40s along with her simpering Ana.<br /><br />Although I could go into detail on how bad this book is, at this point I just want to move on with my life and try and forget the time I spent on this book that I will never get back.
B003FM1MNO|5.0|Great movie, nice video quality.  I never get bored wathcing this trilogy--would love to watch it again.  Thanks to Amazon.
B000002PCS|5.0|I have loved this movie from the first time I saw it in 1984.  It is one of my favorite all time love stories.  I can watch this movie over and over again.
B000GCFG7E|4.0|Just another interesting read.  Hard to put down. Lee Child's tells a great story that is well researched. Great airplane book.
B0009P5YXO|4.0|This is a pretty good product. I think it is well made enough to last long time and give my son a lot of enjoyment.
B009K0P10K|5.0|I never know what is going to happen next! Great show! Really like Nolan and the Graysons are pure unadulterated evil.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|Good movie for the little ones. My kid is 5 yrs old and she loved it. Very good story and well picturized.
B009GEBBNQ|3.0|This film kept me wishing for a little something above the 12 year-old level.<br />As a &#34;big person&#34; I have to say it was not especially satisfying.
B007UQ5Z1G|3.0|After A Thousand Suns, which I think is brilliant, I was looking for something big from LP. However, I was a bit let down with Living Things. LP seems to have left the artistic, free, nonconformist musical height they reached with ATS, and drifted back down to the play-it-safe, slaves-to-radio &#34;please the masses&#34; musical level of corporate muzak and artistic mediocrity.<br /><br />The album is not bad and has memorable moments, but it pales in comparison to its immediate predecessor. I understand the line &#34;Once you've got a theory 'bout how the thing works, everyone expects the next thing to be just like the first;&#34; however, I think the next thing, being Living Things, was much more of a return to &#34;the first&#34; as opposed to an evolution of the band.<br /><br />I did see LP live in support of Living Things, and the guys put on an amazing show. I just hope the artistry that lay behind A Thousand Suns was not a one-time vein of inspiration that LP never again taps into.
B001706I5I|5.0|What can I say? I am a HUGE Grinch fan!  Love this movie. My 2 yr old even sat and watched it!!
078401213X|4.0|Pi is the film that kicked off Darren Aronofsky's filmmaking career, and for good reason. It's unique, artistic, well written, intelligent, edgy, and engaging. I understand Pi's not a film for everybody, but if you are into films that fit the above criteria, I think you will enjoy it. If you prefer films that simply amuse and allow you to turn off your brain, you probably won't appreciate this film.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|This is one of the simplest yet most beautiful children's videos I have ever seen.  The music is so lovely, and the animation is simple, elegant, and conveys much emotion.  I highly recommend this as a gift for any young child.  With all the gimmicky toys, this is truly a gift that will appeal to a child's imagination!
B0041KKYEW|5.0|Aronofsky did again: he told a beautiful, dark tale that twists around in your head and has you intrigued from the start. I was on edge and locked into the mystery early in the film. The cinematography is perfect for the story being told, and the imagery and symbolism are brilliant. I rank Black Swan as a cinematic masterpiece and highly recommend it.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|it's fun for about 10 minutes not downing it by no means for what i paid for it. worth that just for a conversation piece
B008OHV5HS|2.0|The music on this album is pretty good in some places and so-so in others. The one thing, however, that is consistently bad, in my opinion, are the vocals. The vocalist's voice is stuck in that 80s operatic prog-rock style, and it was really hard to stomach for me. That said, if you like that singing style, you might really like this album.
B00908DDZM|5.0|I downloaded this album after countless people told me to watch the &#34;Thrift Shop&#34; video.  I watched it, laughed my butt off, and was committed to hearing more.<br /><br />While &#34;Thrift Shop&#34; was the funniest song on the album, most of the songs were well-above par for the industry.  That Macklemore and Ryan Lewis wrote and produced this on their own is uncanny and refreshing, especially in this oversaturated world of auto tuning and production special effects.<br /><br />The lyrics are thought-provoking, heart-wrenching, and emotionally satisfying.  I wish I picked this up earlier in the year.  Then I would have made plans to see them in concert.  :)
B009HELT3C|3.0|In my opinion the beginning was slow and the ending was disappointing but the rest was pretty good. It's Will Smith at his best.
B00881VLCE|1.0|while the puzzles are pretty and the options for differed sizes is nice the constant nagging for ratings and freezing and forceclose issues really make this one a bust.  not recommended at all :(
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Wonderful show with a stellar cast and gripping drama. It's not just about Blue Bloods living the high-life it's about personal journeys, joyous and sad, and helping one another putting aside prejudices,  realizing at the end of the day we are all human despite social status. I can't wait for Season 3! My friend in the UK says its quite a hit there!
0151008116|5.0|Absolutely loved this book. I wanted to read it before I saw the movie, and was extremely glad I did! As a zoology major in college, I can tell Yann Martel really did his research for this book. I highly recommend this to anyone with an adventurous heart.
B000059GEI|5.0|I remember going to see this in the movies as a little boy. The Theater Marquee read: \\"MARILYN MONROE (In Huge Letters) in (Second Line) There's no business like Show Business with (Third Line) Ethel Merman, Donald O'Connor, Dan Dailey, Mitzi Gaynor and Johnny Rae. That's how big a movie star Monroe was at the time. I've never seen anyone draw crowds like MM in the 1950's.<br /><br />Monroe's musical numbers were \\"After you get what you want you don't want it\\" in which she entered wearing a tight evening gown which had a flesh colored undergarment and starburst spangles covering the strategic areas. Marilyn apeared to be nude under the starbursts, even though she wasn't.<br /><br />A little later, she sang \\"Tropical Heat Wave\\" dressed in a sort of bikini with a little belt covering her navel. This was jaw-droppping to a nine-year-old kid in 1955!<br /><br />Marylin's musical performances were considered lewd and vulgar in 1955. Actually, she wouldn't have been powerful enough to choose her own songs and costumes but she sure did know how to sell sex! Seen recently on TCM, it's all rather tame and yet, what I remember most were her scenes with Donald O'Connor in the quieter moments. You couldn't help but like her. There was a genuine sweetness about the girl. You knew she coulnd't be the cruel seductress she's been made out to be.<br /><br />Recently, I revisited this film on TCM figuring I'd leave it on until I grew tired of it. I watched it all the way through and loved every minute of it.<br /><br />Ethel Merman was the undisputed Queen of Broadway but had never made a big splash in movies. Ethel is wonderful here, never sounding or looking better. I think it's her best film. It's a shame she did not get to immortalize Mama Rose in Gypsy.<br /><br />The underated Dan Dailey was a good choice for her husband.<br /><br />Gorgeous Mitzi Gaynor is their daughter and although Fox was really promoting MM, Mitzi takes no prisoners in the looks and talent department. Canyou belive that Mitzi still looks much as she did way back when.<br /><br />Donald O'Connor is Ethel and Dan's youngest son, in love with Monroe. Unfortunately there would be fewer and fewer screen musicals as the years went on thereby shortening the screen careers of O'Connor and Gaynor (And, no, I haven't forgotten South Pacific with Mitzi).<br /><br />Johnny Ray is the only bore in this movie, but, at the time, pre-Elvis, Johnny was the nation's hottest new recording artist. When he sings, take a bathroom break or get a snack.<br /><br />There is so much color and music, the picture seems to spill out of the screen. It will engulf you in song and dance from an earlier era.<br /><br />It's a classic.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I thought this game was great for passing time. I've played it before on the ipod touch and it was good and now that I have it on my Kindle Fire it's just as good if not better because of its larger screen. I'd recommend this game for anyone.
B003ZHR6RK|5.0|The Blu Ray arrived quickly and in good condition. This is a great movie to have in your collection--especially recorded in such high quality
B00008ADPF|3.0|This CD does not measure up to some of their other CDs but it is a step better than their earliest CDs.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|May be hard to watch with your significant other... so you may want to watch it alone first..have tissues ready.. writer nailed it.
006197806X|5.0|** spoiler alert **<br /><br />First thought: Where's the third one and why is it not out yet? *sigh* I am a very impatient person and I want it now! (I feel like Veruca Salt) I am bordering between 4 and 5 stars, so we'll go with a 4.5 but it's not an option. I just finished it like not even 10 minutes ago, so we'll see.<br /><br />I loved that Lena isn't the strongest person in the world; she also isn't the weakest. But she's a fighter. She fights to stay alive, to live, for her, for Alex. After she thinks he's dead, after she's lost it all, she still wants to fight back. She finds comfort and family with Raven and the others. Even though Raven doesn't fully disclose all the plans and throws Lena to the wolves with Julian, they are still together, still on the same side. I felt that Lena took forever to realize that the umbrella Tack gave her was more than an umbrella... how many days did it take her to figure that out? But it did sort of fit her character... she's just learning to read into things. Being on the outside looking in gives us, as readers, some advantage over her.<br /><br />Alex. Not since &#34;There is no district 12&#34; (Catching Fire, last line) has the last line of a book left me hanging so tensely and dying to know what happens next. I truly did not believe Alex was dead and I figured she would eventually run across him - either he had been 'cured' for real and was now fighting for the other side, or something similar to what really happened. So that came as no shock to me. However, I feel so bad for Lena now that she has not only the resistance to contend with but with Alex and Julian as well. What did they do to him while he was locked in the Crypts? Does he hate her? Does he blame her? What will come of it all?<br /><br />I have so much swirling through my head right now.
B009WO7NQO|3.0|no instructons on how to play the game ?  Can you send  some to William M Hawkes, hawkes.william@gmail.com asap, thanks
B007IXWKUK|2.0|Plot didn't get much better and I wasn't impressed with the writing. It wasn't exactly the greatest book I've ever read and I wouldn't recommend it to most anyone I know. I realize I'm the opposite of the general consensus here. Oh well. :)
B009FOBZL0|5.0|I love the new CD, great new upbeat sound, but still the same Wallflowers. It's a great CD from start to finish.
B003O86FMW|5.0|** spoiler alert **<br /><br />A shocking follow-up to The Hunger Games, I was thoroughly impressed by Suzanne Collins ability to keep the suspense of the story as well as the darkness it entails going while allowing the reader to believe every word she writes. It seemed Katniss took a long while to connect any dots, but she never feels she is as important as she really is, so that actually makes sense that she has to have things explained to her. I felt sad and desolate when I came to the end and Peeta is taken by the capitol while she is left to figure things out in her own way. I am excited to start Mockingjay now and see how it all ends, although I am not looking forward to it all ending!<br /><br />*Update - read Sept 2010 and Apr 2012. Still loved it just as much as I did then. It's a completely different experience knowing the outcome, but not in a bad way
1452111014|5.0|Not only was it an awesome movie, its a great movie that has a great art book to be paired with.  There are lots of sketches and lost of writing about the movie and art.  Its a lot like other disney art books.  Highly recommended.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|I only read this one so I could finish the trilogy and see if the story or writing got any better. Not so much, at least in my opinion (which is all I have, let's be honest). Again, wouldn't recommend it to anyone I know.
B007N8RULO|5.0|This is a game that I live to play, I have a hard time leaving this game when I am playing it
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Finished reading for the second time. Wanted to go back and start all over. I found myself not wanting it to end again so I would re-read a couple pages when I picked it back up just to make it last longer. I had forgotten so many details since I read it a year and a half ago. The way in which everything culminates is shockingly real; it's not all tied up with a pretty little bow on top. I love that about the entire series.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I enjoyed so many things about this book.  The situation where Pi, born a Hindu, becomes a Christian, and then a Muslim is interesting.  In his home he honors the three.  Felt the explanation of his Father that Zoo life was not a bad thing for animals if all of their needs/traits/tendencies were addressed was worth thinking about.  The instruction manual about surviving a shipwreck would help any of us under similar circumstances. Wasn't sure I liked the ending until I thought about it several days.  I vote for the Bengal Tiger...after all, there were all of those little bones in the boat.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The world created by Suzanne Collins in this book is horrifying yet captivating. It's shocking, violent, & full of turmoil. Putting the book down once I got into it was not an option I wanted to consider. She made an unbelievable idea believable, characters likable, and despite being disgusted at the concept of the Hunger Games, I found myself wanting them to win. I am looking forward to reading Catching Fire next!<br />*Update: (read first time in 2010, read again just before the movie came out and once again after I saw the movie).
0375703764|5.0|I'm not going to use this space to pen a lengthy book review (I prefer Goodreads for that), but I did want to say that I found this book absolutely worth the unexpectedly complex chore of reading.  Months (and many books) later, I'm still puzzling over this one — which is a good thing.  Beware that it will leave you wanting more, which appetite &#34;The 50 Year Sword&#34; will patently *not* absolve :-(
B005RUUUAI|5.0|If you are even reading this, then you already know it will be worth watching. It was so fun to watch all of the episodes back to back.

B004SIP6LS|5.0|This movie is a CLASSIC. Truly a must own. It gets funnier the more I watch it. I would have loved the original ending but then there wouldn't have been the ability for a second one. Kevin Smith is a genious.
B005OCFGTO|2.0|The movies are fine; but, the case they came in was broken at the swivel point.If the packing had been better, I would have been completely satisfied
B006OE7XM4|5.0|I just happened to be listening to the local jazz station and I heard Porter sing Work Song. It was only version of the song I have ever heard with words so I had to get the CD. This is one of those CD's that I am able to listen to without skipping a song. Absolutely a quality singer and CD. Worth the money.

B0012GMVLM|4.0|I guess you got to be in a special kind of mood to appreciate this tastily comestible prog-pop fruit but only if you take into account APP’s strongest assets: pristine production and expert musicianship as well as a sprinkling of exemplary tracks. Problem is there are always a few sucky songs that prevent their albums to be spectacularly revered by the prog community. This album has the difficult chore of following what was arguably a career high with the sublime “I Robot” and in many ways the expectations are unachievable. That being clearly stated, Pyramid has a few gems, a slew of enjoyable pop hits and the odd clunker.<br /><br />The Killer tracks: “Voyager” is, as often the case with APP, a lovely overture, full of inspiration and mood. The sensational “In the Lap of Gods” is among the best instrumentals Parsons and Project have come up with, flush with abundant Andrew Powell orchestrations that defy the notion of brilliance. “Hyper-Gamma-Spaces” is a classic trance-dance-ambulance that has a riveting red-light beat and cool mood effects from the lush e-piano. The finale “Shadow of a Lonely Man” has Supertramp-like tendencies with some ELO style orchestrations and works well within those accepted confines.<br /><br />The Pop tracks: “What Goes Up” is a typical time period musical anecdote, breezy rhythm and sultry lilt. T’was a minor radio hit. “The Eagle Will Rise Again” is an utterly ravishing melody, a lively chorus and deep emotion oozing from Colin Blunstone‘s expressive voice “Can’t Take It with You” is enjoyable, with a hook chorus and some decent pop tendencies. “Pyramania” sounds like the Sparks, squeaky voice and quirky rhythms but it’s brief and funny.<br /><br />Clunker? “One More River”, a totally uninspiring piece of formulaic nothing. A sax by numbers helps little to medicate the pain.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is very well done.  It captivates you from the first program of the first season and you want to watch more.  The twists and turns are exceptional.  In this series no one is safe.
B00729Z782|5.0|I am glad my sights finally landed on this sophomore release amid a few initial bumble bee buzzes that produced no honey, then taking the leap to pursue and purchase this lovely disc after listening to the live “Memo” clip on their website. This clicker was the presence of Henry Rogers, a stupendous drummer who first caught my attention with fellow British band Touchstone. This guy plays meaty, beefy fills that hint at past greats like Bonham and Taylor, propelling the harder-edged music with great aplomb, a very manly approach to the drums in a style that immediately grabs one’s attention.<br /><br />“Me and My Downfall” kicks this one right into immediate overdrive, no quarter asked or given. Stubborn, swift and solid like some of the recent PTree material where sweeping keys and menacing guitar snarls, booming bass and the Rogers steamroller elevate the tune to glorious heights, with dejected RPWL’s Yogi Lang-like vocals providing the brisk doom and gloom. The dead simple mid-section has the burnt smell of oily turbo charged riffs that can only induce a smile from the most jaded listener. This rocks and rocks well. What an opening salvo!<br /><br />“Maybe September” is dripping in opaque synth and cello-driven melancholia, intensely autumnal and desolately beautiful. Upon repeated listens, this piece really exudes an incredible emotional intensity, a trembling Tony Wright vocal full of pain and delicate agony with Marillion’s Mark Kelly providing that special classic touch. Take notice of the synth work here, a pure ivory blitzkrieg that is only overtaken by a thrilling axe solo from Ditchfield. Rogers batters this whole into a massive orgasmic oblivion. Phew!<br /><br />Jude Kelly (Mark’s little daughter?) introduces this monster highlight, with initial techno-like keys evolving into a crunch-guitar riff that explodes into this unreal main melody. Some kind of instrumental multi-tasking on the sensational “Marty and the Magic Goose” from the supremely talented Andy Ditchfield who supplies all the swirling guitar, sinuous bass and whopping keys while Rogers keeps the rock steady. The atmosphere is chaotically controlled within a tight sonic context and its just plain superb.<br /><br />The bulk of this stupendous album relies on the multi-part epic suite that gives us the title, a colossal adventure that scans the entire spectrum of modern prog, littered with achingly beautiful melodies, deadly choruses, scintillating solos and tremendous vocal work from Tony and Steve Wright, together with Ditchfield all give the arrangements a profound sense of accomplishment. Needless to say once again, Rogers pummels with unabashed gusto, confirming his obvious sense of propulsion.<br /><br />The classic “Memo” finishes this one off with utter gusto, a brilliant and memorable tune that sticks in your mind long after consumption. Rogers ripples intensely, the bass burping along, content while the melody just dredges intensely into the psyche. A perfect example of why Henry Rogers is such a kick-ass drummer, just check out and contemplate in awe his work, a shivering experience to say the least! Real drumming! Moving impeccably from hard-driving to even more majestic propulsion , maintaining that solid foundation of sound is a voice to be heard on your speakers. Play it loud….<br />  Astonishingly, the once famed pop singer Nik Kershaw handles the vocal (the man always had a definite prog tendency) and this majestic and memorable track puts an end to an entirely satisfying sonic adventure.<br />Fans of melodic and concussive prog such as Porcupine Tree, Haken, Galahad, RPWL, Sylvan, Silhouette, Mystery, Nine Stones Close  etc…will lap this stuff up with utter glee.<br /><br />A do-not-miss 2012 release.the supremely talented Andy Ditchfield who supplies all the swirling guitar, sinuous bass and whopping keys while Rogers keeps the rock steady.

B0041D843M|5.0|There's a lot of information in this book, and while I haven't finished reading it yet it has already made me re-think many of the assumptions I have made about the foods we eat and what kind of an impact that they have on our health and wellbeing. Highly recommended.
B000J4QWMC|5.0|except for the mis-casting of gong li as colin's love interest, this movie was rich,<br />dark, mesmerizing and the soundtrack is FABULOUS and moody.

B004VMUS9G|5.0|I set alarms for everything. I love that I can set up so many with this app. From wake up to medication reminders to picking up my daughter from school and more, each alarm can have its own tone. The selection of tones are great too. I love that I can wake up to soothing chimes and have something a little more urgent when it's time to get out the door for school. I also have a tendency to over use the snooze button. There's a feature that forces you to do a math problem before you can snooze again. Simply brilliant! As I said before, I love it.
034580404X|5.0|Had been looking for this set for months. Glad to finally find it so that I can see what everyone has been talking about
B0087ZFH94|2.0|Like many reviewers here - I am a long time fan and have all of the recordings included in this compilation and am very familiar with them. Also, I read the other reviews several times before making the purchase and was fairly warned. So here's my take for those of you who are still not convinced. Being somewhat of an audiophile but not totally overboard I was hoping that the recordings themselves had also been upgraded to reflect a quality of at least say Songs From Distant Earth which was okay but not great sonically (shouldn't be too much of a stretch to ask for at least 1994 level music quality should it?). Bottom line - I love a lot of the music from the time frame that this compilation covers but frankly find it unlistenable on any equipment with more than basic AM radio capability. This means that if you have any of these recordings you will not have any reason to purchase them again. As far as the acutal compilation itself and having read that Mike put this together himself - my only comment is that if he considers these his best efforts I sure as heck don't - seriously, all of Amarok and only the first part of Ommadawn? (yeah I know it took him three decades to write the first side and 20 minutes for the second but I still think the second side [of the LP] is by far the best). I am pretty sure I could have put together a better compilation for him - for example how do you manage to leave Far Above the Clouds off? or Dark Island from Voyager? If you are looking for something new or better sound don't expect it here.
B000641D2Y|5.0|Was the best deal that I found out there. Can't wait to reveal it at Christmas time. This is an all time favorite
B000IZ0KRK|3.0|After just watching this film, I have to say I am a bit disappointed. To start with a good note, the actors were brilliant, it was well filmed for the time, and it was an enjoyable fictional film. However, my excitement at coming across this film was due to my long study of English history, the period and the monarchy. This film was a complete disappointment as a hisorically accurate piece. The facts were entirely muddled, and the relationship between Jane and Guilford was utter nonsense. There is no evidence whatsoever that he was even kind to her much less in love with her. Jane had very little happiness in her upbringing from what we can find in history, and even less in her later years. Long story short, if you want to enjoy a good drama, it's a great film. If you want to know the history of Jane, please pick up a good history book and completely disregard 75% of this film.
B0052AKALM|4.0|This is a great movie for fans of the popular video game of the same name.  Provides some great background into Jin and is overall a fun movie!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|This app will only let me see no more than 4 or 5 news feeds.  Very frustrating.  Please, please fix this.  Mobile app on the hd 8.9 is also frustrating.
B002ZG97M4|4.0|When I found out they were re-making this movie, I (1) felt really old, and (2) shuttered at the thought of Hollywood desecrating and disrespecting this classic. (I saw it 6 Fridays in a row in the theaters) Also, who of us in the 80's didn't have a little Ren McCormick in us? So, needless to say, I thought that if I ever got around to watching this, I was probably not going to make it through the first 20 minutes. Boy was I wrong. Julianne Hough, is a perfect P.K. (preacher's kid) and..uh...what's his name is really likable against my every wishes of this project ever being  sought out. Over half of the movie is shot for shot, word for word re-make of the original. So you ask yourself, \\"why re-make it then?\\" To introduce it to a new audience. I'd like to call this \\"Footloose 2.0\\". Not a re-make, but an update. The charm, the music, the passion...it's all there. SPOILER ALERT: I even liked the change in the script that Ren's mom has died. It make you more sympathetic to him cause and I'm glad they did it. Looking back on the original, she was a dead, useless character. Thank you Hollywood for restoring a bit of faith in you.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|This, is a great super hero film.<br /><br />It show cases various super hero favorites, including a few obscure ones.  This is a must see and it's full of non-stop action.
076115678X|5.0|Very good book. Easy to read, pictures to understand better, it has more info than what I was expecting to find. Good quality.
B0092MKFIY|3.0|I heard a song on XM radio, Radioactive.  Loved it.<br /><br />Checked out the rest of the album.  Most of it is commerical ( no offense), but there are a few good note worthy songs.<br /><br />it's worth checking out.
B0038P59A0|5.0|What fun for anyone who is a Robert Downey Jr./Jude Law fan. I love the authentic way they display the way life was in the days of Sherlock but the commarderie of Sherlock and Watson is what makes the show. If you like this one, the second one is just as much fun. I highly recommend this film for anyone.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|My kids love. Keeps them busy when I need it. Very happy I chose this app. Recommend for young children who like music.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|Julie Andrews, beautiful scenery, wonderful music, a great story, a great supporting cast, and you have a great movie for all ages.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I chose this book because Jaycee was telling her story.  She needs people to understand what she went through and my hope is that it helps her heal. God bless her and her family.
B0091LRZZW|4.0|Let's get a couple of things out of the way first:  If you're the kind of music fan who would prefer Paul McCartney to just keep belting out Get Back and Band on the Run for the rest of his life, then keep walking - there's nothing for you here.  Likewise, if you don't think it ever got better than Bing Crosby or Frank Sinatra, then you're going to find little to love in this show.  If your tastes allow for some exploration, then read on.<br /><br />Doing and album and/or show of old standards has become almost as much a rock cliché as stint in rehab.  Over the years, the quality of such albums has ranged from the sublime (Harry Nilsson's [[ASIN:B000EQ47WM A Little Touch of Schmilsson in the Night]]) to the ridiculous (Robbie Williams' [[ASIN:B00005RFVL Swing When You're Winning]]).  The fact is that any idiot can buy a hat, hire a decent arranger and sing into a microphone once used by Sinatra.  So why should we follow Macca down this well-worn path?<br /><br />Well, there are a few good reasons.  Firstly, McCartney is old enough to remember some of these songs when they were current, and to have sung them around the family Johanna so his fondness for these tunes has not been confected from a lot of received wisdom.  He has also revealed an ongoing fondness for the style since the early days of the Beatles, from covers of 'Til There Was You and A Taste of Honey, through When I'm Sixty Four and Honey Pie to [[ASIN:B003PK265E Warm and Beautiful]] and [[ASIN:B00A46IRKA Baby's Request]] with Wings, he's already done plenty of dabbling in the genre.  Thirdly, as one of the people who made Abbey Road \\"da place,\\" he has no need for the reflected glory of working at Capitol Studios in Hollywood.<br /><br />He's also well aware of how many artists have done this before and has taken pains to set this collection apart from them by choosing lesser known songs and going for quiet, subtle versions of the songs where many before him - including some of the originals - preferredto go for bombast.  It's this approach that makes [[ASIN:B0076OW9DE Kisses On The Bottom]] and this companion DVD more than just the obligatory standards album.<br /><br />The film intersperses the songs with interviews discussing the making of the album and the show.  On a regular concert film this would be a pain but on this one it works fine.  This is mainly because Live Kisses isn't so much a concert as a live run through of some songs.  As always with a McCartney show, he shares a great camaraderie with the band, led by Diana Krall and featuring Joe Walsh sitting in on Eric Clapton's parts.  This is another departure from similar albums, where there could be a bit of a master/servant relationship between singer and players.<br /><br />What really makes this a unique McCartney performance is that for once, it's entirely about Paul the singer.  Although everyone knows he has one of the greatest voices of the last half-century, that fact has always been parallel to his talents as songwriter, composer, multi-instrumentalist and producer.  And with every song, you can tell he's chosen it because part of it speaks to him.  This is not a case of the singer putting on an act.  He does present his own interpretations of the songs but never do they deviate from the song's original meaning.  It's been said that Paul's voice is not what it used to be.  Two points on that topic: Firstly, duh!  The man is 70 years old.  You should sound as good at that age.  Secondly, while his voice is considerably weaker than it was in 1967, it does lend itself very well to his intention of bringing out the vulnerability in the songs.  This is not an album he could have made when he was 30.<br /><br />The arrangements occasionally veer a little too close to hotel lobby music but for the most part, they are tasteful and understated, neither being too reverential to the originals, nor interpreting them within an inch of their lives.  The one place it doesn't quite work is on Bye Bye Blackbird which almost becomes a dirge.  They do, however, almost manage to redeem The Glory of Love for me after Beaches pretty well ruined it.<br /><br />Most of the film is presented in black and white with a slightly harsh contrast that is less 1940s film and more like early 1960s television.  It suits the music very well though.  One rather annoying aspect is lots of jump cuts early in the piece.  In a show like this, a shot should last for at least one bar of music.<br /><br />There's no denying this DVD has a pretty limited market.  You couldn't even call it a fans-only release because there will be thousands of fans who will hate him for not making a proper rock album, whatever that means.  There will be others who laud it purely for being McCartney with no other reason.  This show can only be judged for what it is and McCartney, Diana Krall and producer Tommy LiPuma have managed to create a set that strikes the right balance of familiarity and originality, authenticity and playfulness.  If you don't like it, then you don't like it, but it's better than you think.
B004HX4RT6|4.0|My son and I love this app. It is great on both the tablet and the phone.  The options are kind of funny, and there is really only one great theme, but the game play is great and I love the option to show valid moves for teaching my son.
B00AE2I4WK|3.0|Movie had a slow and predictable story line. Dance routines were great, but I could've just watched youtube clips of each dance scene and be satisfied. I found the movie in whole to be boring and not as good as the hype would have led it to be. The music and choreography were AWESOME though.
B005DC68NI|5.0|Let's Get Digital is a must read for all authors who are writing today regardless of whether they have a legacy publishing contract or not. Although it is primarily a guide to self publishing the book also looks back at the origins of the publishing industry and how it has arrived at the place that it is today.  The book also takes you on the author's own journey into self publishing and documents the highs and lows, the mistakes and the wins that he encountered along the way. The author is not afraid to give away his secret sauce and I think this is what makes this book so important. If you are interested in self publishing then this book is a must read.
B009OYTAL8|5.0|So we missed an episode on our DVR.. The streaming was just like we where watching it live well worth it.

044655667X|4.0|Once again lawyer, Mickey Haller, has found himself defending a murder suspect, even though he has sworn off all cases but his money making defense of foreclosures.<br /><br />The Harper Lee Award winning mystery focuses on the present<br />day foreclosures in the housing market.  Everything is these cases seemingly depends on the game playing of the lawyers and finding golden loop holes in the law.  For the mortgage lenders, there is much money to be made too.  Some of the householders are innocents and some are just playing the system.<br /><br />Lisa Trammel, an extremist for the cause,  is one of these homeowners on the verge of loosing her house.  When her mortgage lender is murdered, she becomes the prime suspect in his murder.  Shady deals, greed, movie and book deals, and mob involvements apparently drive all the action.  Despite the odds, Mickie begins to believe that his client may very well be innocent, and was probably set up for this crime.<br /><br />Connelly keeps this readers interest on the fast tract, with the modern additions of texting during the trial, Facebook evidence, and even the addition of the consideration of Matthew McConaughey to play Mickey in a movie about the case.<br /><br />I was thoroughly engrossed and would give this book five stars except for two loose ends that really needed answering for me.  But, would I recommend this book, definitely!!!  Especially for a book group where these loose ends could be discussed!!
B0098VYCCE|5.0|interesting point of view, like seeing it made from the dark side. Very different from the &#34; Fairy Tale&#34; Disney version. Great acting also. Would definitely recommend it.
B002PZC8BM|5.0|I JUST FINISHED READING A NEW BOOK OF POETRY CALLED THE PURIRY OF DESIRE BY DANIEL LADINSKY. THE BOOK MADE ME SEE THAT PATRICK JANE'S DESIRE, BUT ONLY HIS DESIRE FOR REVENGE IS TRULY PURE. I THINK PATRICK JANE'S DESIRE FOR REVENGE IS THE THING THAT IS MAKING HIM INTO A MORE DEVELOPED HUMAN BEING. HE IS SO COMPLICATED AS A CHARACTER THAT HE ATTRACTS PEOPLE FROM EVERY KIND OF BACKGROUND AND WITH ALL KINDS OF INNER DEMONS.  WHO RED JOHN IS COMPARES TO WHO JANE IS.  THEY ARE DEFINITELY BECOMING.  THE WRITERS AND ACTORS ARE FANTASTIC. I LOVE THE SHOW.  KEEP UP THE FANTASTIC WORK.

B009YP9L7U|5.0|this book was a great read .  I recommend it for anyone who likes the accidental meeting / too hurt to love type of romance.  The characters are well rounded and believable, not hollow idiots that you want to yell at to get over themselves.  I would like to read more from this author.
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|Nice closure to the Trilogy, but it's a little slower and the action is not as good as the 2nd film.
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|Cloud Atlas is nearly three hours long.  During my viewing, I never regretted the length.  Not once did I get impatient for the movie to end.  This movie is actually many stories woven into a single film.  The film held my attention for its' full length.  I even stayed around for the credits to listen to the movies beautiful (and relevant) theme music.  For me to be engrossed in anything for three hours straight is amazing.  But Cloud Atlas is an extraordinary film.  Hollywood enough to keep your adrenalin pumping but European\cosmopolitan enough to cause you to think about the movies content and wonder at the story's moral.  I think Cloud Atlas is a popular film masterpiece.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This is a lightweight, inexpensive sharpener. If you want a sharpener to carry with you, leave in the glovebox of the car or truck. pick this one
B008VBYN80|2.0|I hate games with &quot;energy&quot; limits. I feel the second I start enjoying the game, I have to wait to play.
B000ICLRIE|5.0|This is a well made albeit blood-spattered drama. During our tour of Jerusalem this past October our guide was asked if there are any movies available that portray the crusades and battles for Jerusalem accurately. He said that while this one has some historical flaws, it is about as accurate as you are going to find.
B004GVUPFE|4.0|The 3D Graphic effects are excellent with many VIBRANT BACKGROUNDS to choose from to suite your taste.  Sound Effects are nice and Music is Pleasantly Soothing.  It gets to be a very challenging Slider Puzzle game after a short while but is still Fun to play.  I haven't seen any MAJOR problems on my Xoom Tablet.  It is a little BUGGY (as others have said) but the only glitch on my device so far is the Main Square Block that you need to move towards the target area actually DISAPPEARS sometimes.  I found a FIX for that though... Just press the arrow for next level and then press that back arrow.  This brings you back to your level with the Main Square Block RESTORED.  The Instructions are OK and the Menu and Settings features work fine.  I like that it only has 1 Permission for SD Card access. The only complaint I have is that when you EXIT THE APP through the MENU or pressing your BACK BUTTON 3 times, the app stays RUNNING IN BACKGROUND.  This uses Battery power needlessly and you have to use a Task Killer every time after you play to SHUT IT DOWN COMPLETELY.  Minus 1 Star for that annoyance and the Buggy features.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|The relationship between Castle and Becket (which has been dealt with so very well all along) is handled very well in Season 5. These are the best episodes in the whole season, episode 1 and 4. I have recently discovered this show and bought the dvds of the previous seasons as well.<br /><br />The stories are great (the plot always has a twist.) There is humor, there are emotions, there is drama. What I find very, very appealing is the healthy family relationships. What a pleasure it is to see such a strong bond in the Castle family! They have family traditions in their daily lives which are important to them, despite the generation gaps.<br /><br />All the characters have been developed with attention to detail. Nathan Fillion is outstanding as Castle. My favorites are Castle, Martha, and Alexis.

B000TENE6Y|5.0|One of my top 10 favorites of all time. I had it on CD but it was so old and scratched I couldn't even rip it. Bought it through Amazon MP3 for $4. Would have paid twice that.
B0027ZAWG8|5.0|This movie is an astute commentary on one possible future for our civilization. Both the quality of the acting and the detailed set design make this a classic work of fiction.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Excellent film!  The acting and story are very good for a comic re make!  The intesity of the movie kept me on the edge of my seat!  Rent or Buy it!
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I just took a training in writing books for the kindle and purchased a program that automatically formats, but I like to know what is going on \\"behind the scenes.\\"  This was very helpful in that regard. Thanks!
B005LAIGNC|4.0|Delivery was fast and without any problems. This movie is pretty good.  Its based on a black fighter squadron in world war two. It would make a good addition to any dvd collection.
030758836X|5.0|This review needs to be short and sweet because I want to give absolutely no spoilers!  Just know that as you read this book, you're bound to be surprised.  As the story begins, it seems like it's practically word for word `taken from the headlines' of a case a few years ago.  As it progresses, I was thinking - he's innocent!  He's guilty!  He's - - wait a minute - - what just happened?!!  Some great twists and turns and suspense right up to the subtly shocking ending!  I can see why this book has been on the best seller lists for many weeks.
B006GECE9Y|1.0|This app was recommended when I found that the Silk browser on my Kindle Fire wasn't working so well. I downloaded it, and it never worked or came up as a browser option, even though the icon showed as having been downloaded successfully.
1588167461|2.0|Pros: Tips on garment care, buying tips<br />Cons: No color photos, Not very engaging, Lacks any depth within the scope of men's fashion.
B004UID2LC|1.0|No features that are better than regular Youtube, thought this app was supposed to run faster on the Kindle Fire than the regular Youtube app.  Nope.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|The idea is that there is an island where the seasons change at your whim, with a little magic. Work to put the island back to rights and make your way home.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I thought this was a great read! I wasn't interested in reading it at first because I'm not into the sappy love stories of Nicholas Sparks' typical novels.  A friend suggested I read it, and described it to be very different from his others.  I was presented surprised and impressed.  Love the flow of the writing and clear descriptions of the characters!
B0038M2AZA|5.0|This movie taught me not to sell people short, this story is truly amazing and shows what good parenting and determination is all about.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Love it…! Sometime on my Kindle Fire I may download something and don't know where to find it or how.  With this program I and see EVERYTHING on the device. SUPER!
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|The information in this book, really improved communication in our marriage.  I would recommend this reading to all who are getting married or are already in a relationship.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Let's just say I was not disappointed at all. Beautiful Diaster is a GREAT book! The story was truly intense and really pulled you into the story and relationship of Abby and Travis. I love how broken Travis was on the outside, but on the inside he was so loving. I loved the humor and cockiness to this book. I loved the beautiful disaster of a relationship they had from the beginning. I felt the writing was pretty great and I loved the story from beginning and mostly the end. =)<br /><br />To be honest, I wanted to kill Abby at times..she mad me so mad!! But then I had to remember she is just so young 18 - 19 years of age and new to the mature level you need in a relationship. Do not get me wrong I wanted to kill Travis a few times too.<br /><br />I kind-of felt bad for Parker--but there was no hope for him at all with Abby, because from the beginning she belonged to Travis.<br /><br />Abby and Travis' relationship is much like many real life couples--kind of reminds me of mine at times. The love-hate type of relationship. I think that is why I loved this book so much. It just goes to show sometimes you do not know what you have right in front of you intil it smacks you in the face.<br /><br />I CANNOT WAIT til book #2--Walking Disaster! Nothing is more sexier to me than to read a book from the POV of a male! =) So excited! I am sure I will not be able to sleep until I finish this book as well
B0051XJ9YE|5.0|Great addition to cars set for my grandchildren to play with.  Cars movies has been a hugh hit in the family and playing cars just makes it that much better.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I downloaded this book for free, and gave it a shot. I'm not usually a romance reader, but I really enjoyed it! The sexual tension was great, and the turns were somewhat expected but still good. Took less than 48 hoursfor me to read start to finish
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|I have tried downloading this game three times every time I do it takes a really long time to load and most of the time it crashes before it even loads. it looks extremely fun please update and fix
B000YHG72E|5.0|I love this movie and I don't really know why.  It's a modern day Christmas classic and Will Ferrell at his best.
B000HT3JNY|5.0|This movie is a must watch for every family! It's really sends out a strong message. Me and my husband loves it!!!
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|The movie explained a great deal. If you watched the previous movies.  You will notice characters such as the insane pyschiatrist as judge, the mayor, etc.<br /><br />My only complaint was that it was too long.  I could not watch it one sitting.  Also the sound effects are so loud and dialogue so low it was tiresome continually adjusting the volume for home use.
B00371XIJE|5.0|Oh my goodness, I had been looking for this movie forever!!  It was a such a great film and definitely a tearjerker!
B000MKD9P6|5.0|Never got to see it at the movie theatre but I've been wanting to rent it for a while now. I was not disappointed!
B009JBWOU0|5.0|It was exactly what I wanted, if not better! The pictures Definitely don't do it justice! The front of the set is holographic too
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|The plot was thin, choppy and poorly constructed.  The storyline broke off into tangents and was hard to follow.  Little to no character development (save Joe Levitt &#34;Robin&#34; who was BY FAR the most interesting character).  Anne Hathaway was a passive little princess of a Catwoman and left me missing Michelle Pfeiffer who even in her 50's would have played a still better seductress!  What's Bane's story?  Surely deeper than the puddle of a storyline they presented for him which ended up being the films most interesting twist thus only raising more questions to his character in general.  Lastly, the fight choreography was weak.  For the trilogy having started on a solid formal combat training basis I found the hand to hand fighting scenes lacking, staged and as cheesey as 1960's Batman minus Adam West and onomatopoeia graphics.  2 hrs and 45 mins for what?
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I loved the story, the dog and Richard Gere in this movie.<br />The love and dedication between dog and owner is so touching.<br />I would recommend this to all animal lovers.
B001RHPJBU|5.0|Compilations are about the artist's body of work. If you like Phil's hits you will like this collection. A must for fans.
0060557818|3.0|This was undoubtedly a very imaginative idea for a story and I did like parts of it.  However, it lacked one rather big thing that keeps me from giving it a higher rating than 3 stars - excitement.  I just couldn't get excited about \\"Neverwhere\\" at all, though I desperately wanted to.  It's okay, but overall, the story is very forgettable.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|This was a good watch. Light hearted and fun but still with that classic Wes Anderson feel that you know and love.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I love solitaire.  I am still learning my new kindle since my old one was the first and I could not get solitaire on it.  I like to play with one card and I can;'t figure out how to do this.  that's why I did not give it 5 stars.  gretchen taylor
B0051OJG4Q|5.0|Mostly sultry 50's jazz singing that is really great listening. Unfortunately, it was missing one album. I sent it back and never heard from the company again.
B000YHG72E|2.0|'elf' is a decent Christmas comedy about a man who was raised by a elves at the North Pole.  Much of the movie is spent with Buddy, the human elf, attempting to connect with his real father, a seemingly hopeless crank on Santa's naughty list who had no idea he even had a son.  The story and special effects are, all in all, so-so.  My seven-year-old son indicated that the movie was boring while my nine-year-old daughter indicated that it was \\"all right.\\"  \\"Home Alone\\" ([[ASIN:B003CSX6HQ Home Alone]]) is much funnier.
B005PK553C|4.0|Good show but a tad bit creepy for me. I would rather watch Homeland or Good wife. Not much of a horror gal. But if you are, I'm sure you will like this show just fine.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|John Grisham is a great writer and this is no exception, how ever it does drag a bit in the middle. But is most exciting reading I've done this year
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Love GOT!! It is an addiction for me. I love this show. I watched every episode and plan to watch all the rest.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I'd give it a 4.5 if I could but not quit a 5.  I realy like the whole series.  Can't wait for the next book.<br /><br />Abby
