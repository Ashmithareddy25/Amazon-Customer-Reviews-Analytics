B008D36INE|5.0|It touched me, which to me is all important in a movie.  Empathy for each of the characters was deeply felt.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 is the successor to Temple Run, one of the \\"endless runner\\" genera defining games.  the controls are extremely simple making the game easy to play for all ages.  You play one of four characters who has stolen an idol and is running away from the monster that guarded it.  There are various obstacles you must avoid and you get various power-ups and coins that you can pickup as you run.<br /><br />Temple Run 2 has added some nice achievements to give you goals to shoot for as well as a nice array of added abilities to spend your coins on (you can buy coins and gems in the game as well though they do a good job of making this an option and not pushing these options too prominently).  There are no ads in the game which is also nice.  Given the fast gameplay and short game time, the game can become very addicting (I've spend a fair amount of time trying to \\"just get that next goal\\").<br /><br />the game is lots of fun with enough goals to keep a player engaged for weeks (as well as weekly challenges with additional goals).  Eventually the goals get far too few (by the end you need to get goals like \\"run 10 million meters which equates to many hours of gameplay) and thus the game can hit the end of its useful life (though all games hit that point at some time, this just seems odd that they set this last goal much further down the gameplay timeline than any other goal in the game).<br /><br />In all, this is a fun 3rd person perspective endless runner that has helped define the general and certainly worth picking up as a free to play (F2P) game.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|I love this game. Is really fun game .You needed to try it lets fun you will love it Thanks again. I love Amazon too. I love my new Kindle Fire HD l love it.<br /><br />  Patty Thilman
B002UXRGM0|1.0|I bought this over the weekend when I saw it at $33.99 because I really love BBC Earth documentaries, but the price was too good to be true. The version I received was a UK import that won't play on my PS3 and many other US Blu-ray players. This is clearly a known issue as others have posted reviews, frustrated as I am. Because it was only fulfilled by Amazon, but not sold by them, I can't get a replacement. So now if I want a version that actually functions I have to pay more. I'm returning it for a refund, but am disappointed that Amazon couldn't create a separate listing for this version which is a clearly different package, that has it's own distinct UPC code.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|this game is so fun you can play games with the pony's and you try to win stuff like new pony's. gems elements. and coins GET IT ITS FUN
B005S9EKCW|4.0|I love this musical, as well as the original movie, but I saw, this one was in the form of an opera and I thought I would hate it because I wanted some really good acting as well in my favorite book and movie of all time.. I gave it a chance and it turned out I JUST loved it.<br />PROS.......<br />Great make-up....fabulous set.....wonderful costumes.....wonderful direction and fast paced editing.<br /><br />Cons.....Russel Crowe is almost awful in this film and can't sing, nor even act well in this movie and I'm a big fan of his. He was remarkable in \\"Gladiator\\". I think he's mis-cast it seems and fails to deliver anything of note. This is a film where it looks like he took the money can ran because he didn't even seem to show interest in his part.<br />Way too many songs with too many missed notes all through this production. Why you wouldn't want good singers in an opera style film that is \\"ALL\\" singing........ is beyond belief to me.<br /><br />I think just listening to Ann Hathaway doing the one song, \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" is so moving, it's worth the entire viewing of the film just for that alone. The other actors left Mr. Crowe in the dust here I'm sorry to say but the film is a solid winner to me and shows again that stars don't always make the film good.<br />If you want to see acting as it's finest in this role...look at Geoffrey Rush performance with Liam Neeson in the 1998 version of this film.<br />They're vastly different, but I loved both of these films.
B0065GC0PG|5.0|This book has such a unique twist that you will enjoy reading it! You will see the correlation between the fairy tale, Cinderella, and enjoy the main character's spunk and kindness.
B00CATSONE|4.0|The book was good. Not what I thought it was going to be but still good. It was inspirational. I would recommend this to manager and business people.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|~<br />All this app stuff is new &amp; confusing to me, this was the first app I got that was easy to use.<br />I don't understand why most apps are more confusing than they need to be.
B004G606K8|4.0|Another great novel by RA Salvatore. This word requirement to leave feed back is gay and I hate it. Snarf Snarf!!!
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|This is a great movie and I would definitely recommend it. The movie itself was received exactly as expected with no issues.
B00B2166BS|4.0|Having the freed the USB port I have opened to possibility to expand the memory of my Nexus 10. The look and feel of the cable is excellent and it's firmly attached without efforts. It will disconnect if subject to forces such as tripping on the cable or tangling somewhere else (i.e.: a cabinet handler). The cable could be a bit longer but other than that, I recommend the product to every Nexus 10 owner.
0789723107|5.0|Explains the basics of how to make your website usable to customers, and how to think from the perspective of someone who is browsing the net.  Great book in simple terms and illustrations.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The book trilogy was one of a kind and not what I expected. I highly recommend for young adults and older.
B00C1XZ2LQ|5.0|The music  beautiful it so fit the movie, especially the last song sung by Suzanne I still singing it a week later(so you know that song has legs) I would recommend you buy it.
B009GJBEF6|4.0|Another good 007 movie that I recommend.<br />He's willing to take on a new gun even...<br />go see the movie.
0307476073|4.0|I tend to stay away from non-fiction reads, but this one was awesome! I love how it wasn't just about the trail by also her life experience that got her to where she was.
B004N0I3U2|4.0|He does a good job acting but the movies was so so.<br />If your bored with nothing to do, this is a good movie to shake off the boredom.
B001F6TXME|5.0|When I bought my NIKON D3200, I assumed the same cable release that I used for my D80, would work in the D3200.<br /><br />WRONG!<br /><br />Went to Amazon, where I know I can find good quality mdse at a good price. Found it, ordered it, had it in my hands within days.<br /><br />Although I have only used it once, it does what I expect it to do. And that makes me a happy camper.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|It was easy to figure out and I love that it shows lots of features like the weather and the temperature outside.<br />I also love how on the full version you can choose from your own music to wake you up.There are lots of other alarm clock apps but this one is the best one yet!!!!!<br />I would reccomend this alarm to everyone.I love this app and will continue to use it I think you will too!!!!!!!!
B000VNMMPM|5.0|A Luc Besson project is always entertaining, though some more than others, Angel-A is his love postcard to Paris, Every shot in this fantasy of a down-and-out hood and his unlikely savior is beautifully framed in glorious black and white lending a more surreal flavor to the settings.  The story is charming,very funny and both leads are terrific, but the real star in this visual opus is Paris itself.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I'm so sorry it didn't get picked up. Makes no sense. Everyone I known who's seen it has loved it.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Count me as late to the party but now a fully invested fan of all things Joss Whedon.  This brilliant series was so badly fumbled by Fox during its original broadcast that it never had a chance. What a shame because these 14 episodes are a treasure and a wonderful compliment to the film version &#34;Serenity.&#34;
B0063IH60K|5.0|. . . but wish they would get rid of a lot of the little advertising bits! I mean if I want to buy more stuff I'll do it without all the advertising. Oh, yeah, the game, I do love it! It's streamline as far as games go.
0740748475|5.0|First, thank you Amazon for carrying this and making it available for such a good price. I have seen this retail for upwards of $100, so just keep that in mind if you're considering this.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+ Exceptionally well bound hard cover books<br />+ Well constructed case<br />+ High quality paper and prints<br />+ Brings back fond memories of my favorite comic<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Price (for some people)<br /><br />Calvin and Hobbes is brilliant. Although I loved this comic as a kid growing up in the 80s and 90s, I enjoy it more as an adult. Bill Watterson does an amazing job of injecting his sarcastic and satirical humor into everyday situations. I especially enjoy the strips where Calvin and Hobbes have adventures and ponder on life.<br /><br />When I was a kid, I didn't find Calvin's dad to be funny. As an adult, I definitely see the humor!<br /><br />Overall: HIGHLY recommended for the Calvin and Hobbes fan. This is a high quality product. The hardcover, print quality, and case are exceptionally well done.<br /><br />This is also a good gift for anyone who hasn't yet had the joy of reading Calvin and Hobbes.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Beautifully shot, great story and love the two different stories of upstairs/downstairs.  Can't wait to visit the castle it was filmed in.

B00BB8RKH6|4.0|I am glad I ordered this movie however, it did have some technical issues while viewing it.  Denzel is one of the best actors alive.
B00007AJGH|5.0|Another DVD I had to purchase to replace our first copy that my 3 year old wore out. Price was right.

B001QKSWOE|4.0|I love Janet Evanovich. Her characters are so interesting and she always brings an interesting mix of mystery and humor.
B009UNGYHG|4.0|I was having trouble with the Voyager Legend suddenly not working and also continue with the computer not recognizing the device and this has made it so I don't worry about those issues as much anymore.  I am a frequent traveler and I need my Legend for work.  With this case I can charge and overnights, on flights, or in on appointment with customers.  Also, the case is great for protecting my Legend when I need to stow it in my bag.  I'm glad I bought it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My Horse is very entertaining. You get to care for your very own horse in the comfort of your own home without the inconvenience of bad weather and cost for food.
B003HV0TN2|5.0|This book was the best I have read in many years. The second time was even better because I discovered what I had missed in the first 'rush' of excitement. It also answered questions that I had, for the same reason. My grandson recommended this series and we have lots of fun discussing and arguing about why things happened and 'what ifs'. We also try to pre-empt the eagerly awaited third book - and create scenarios that I am sure Patrick will totally blow away. The Denna enigma: I need to know some answers. She is like an angel sent to help others help themselves. Or is this a guise? Can't wait to read the third book.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I just finished my first book on createspace and can't wait until I can publish on Kindle.  Thanks for your help!
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|I was very excited to receive this item.  I really enjoy this show!!  Lt. Columbo is brilliant!!  I was thrilled to see that there are 3 episodes of the spin-off MRS. COLUMBO included.
B000WTDUQK|5.0|The book exceeded our expectations.  At the time we ordered it we didn't realize it was a hard bound book and were very pleased when it arrived.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|like the challenges this is a good game for all ages.  my 4 year old does better than me I hate to admit
B000NI8F5G|3.0|With marginally connected song and dance numbers and a rather convoluted plot.  Debbie Reynolds and Donald O'Connor give subtle and refined performances.  Everyone else is \\"turned up to 11\\" and desperately needed a pregnant pause here or there.  The technicolor starts beautifully but by the last large dance routine became garish.  There is a dark undercurrent of Hollywood narcissism in it's energy.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|like the different levels this is a good game for all ages  my 4 year old can play it too
B008220D5K|5.0|It may be a white suburban yuppie 40 but there are universal frustrations and fears.  Leslie Mann steals every scene this time as a feisty but warm hearted Lucille Ball type.  I hope she does many more comedies.  The script isn't 5 stars but the snap crackle pop randomness of each line's delivery kicks it up a few notches in ways you never anticipate.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a very fun and addictive game! I was a fan of the first game and have been happy with the changes in this version, try it you'll like it!
B005LAIHY0|5.0|This one hooks you and never lets go.  The visual design and characters alone merit 5 stars.  You still feel anything could happen an hour into it.  My only gripe is that the first 4 minutes promise deeper alien communication than \\"Chronicles of Riddick\\" or \\"Predator\\" and despite it's thought provoking last \\"ship's log entry\\" it sidesteps that promise just a bit.  It still may be the most sophisticated monster movie yet.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|This is an excellent case for the best Bluetooth device on the market. Keeps me charged throughout the day. I highly recommend!
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Sandberg kept me on my toes, and steered me in the right direction. Its easy to get lost in the everyday, Sandberg makes it easy to refocus on a more fulfilling career path.
B00BEZTMWW|2.0|Not my type of movie. I am not into fantasy. I never did watch the whole film. It was painfully boring.
0375869026|4.0|Wonder<br />(2012)<br />Recommended Age 8-12<br /><br />August was born with a deformed face (really his whole head).  Whatever you imagine it was like, it was probably worse.<br />This book is told from a variety of first person, point of view.  When Augie was ready for fifth grade his parents decide that it is time for him to start a regular school at Beecher Prep.  This novel covers that first full year at  Beecher Prep.<br />If this book doesn't teach empathy I don't know what will.<br />I recommend this for fourth or fifth grade students who are curious about what middle school will be like and to those who might need to learn something about empathy.<br /><br />Gunner  April, 2013
B005S9EKCW|2.0|I like the music but I fell asleep half way through.  When watching with a friend we both became bored and eventually turned it off.
B004N4IHU4|5.0|If you like Black Sabbath, with Ozzy or Dio, you'll love this. The singer in this band is a cross between the two and he is superb. These guys take classic Sabbath riffs and turn them into their own songs. Every song is well crafted. Can't wait to see what these guys do next. The Amazon samples don't do this justice.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|an ok app just sad the update made me lose all my ponies at least I didn't spend real money and wouldn't suggest anyone else to either if updates make you lose everything
B0059M7ZVG|5.0|Another great Metal act no one has ever heard of.  One of the best albums of 2012.  Storytelling and pageantry in the King Diamond fashion with catchy riffs, solos and sing along choruses.  Combine this with one of the best metal vocalist going today and you have a great listening experience with songs that get stuck in your head. In a field that has become unfortunately crowded with growly, cookie monster vocalist, Attilla Dom proves you can have great metal and a talented singer with range.  Blood of the Saints is their best effort yet.  Wish they were getting more attention, they deserve it.<br /><br />-mike-
0374531269|3.0|Upon reading this book, I was shocked that I've never heard about what's going on in Sierra Leone before. I've heard of other child armies from Invisible children, but never of anything in Sierra Leone. I started the book expecting amateurish writing, and a more somber tone, but Ishmael does a good job incorporating some lightheartedness in his writing. It portrays human nature at it's fullest. It shows how humans can recover from such a downfall. I wish he filled some holes, and added more of his own bias in there. It seemed like there was some room for judgement on the child army.<br /><br />This story shows the impacts of globalization. Sierra Leone's children and workers are exploited for rare materials which are then sold elsewhere in the world. I would recommend this book for globalization studies because it shows someone who has lived through hell in child armies in Africa to now being well-educated person in New York. But it also shows the negativity of globalization because of the thirst of consumerism and a free trade throughout the world.
B002SR2PKG|5.0|I have seen &#34;It&#34; the movie multiple times but had never read the book until now. It was (as is usual) far more involved and interesting than the movie and I absolutely loved it!  Gruesome and crazy!
B007FEZQF8|5.0|This comic book is amazing. Not only does it have zombies, but it demonstrates the stress and the way the human mind would react to it. In every zombie movie it is usually just hacking and slashing. Now, while I do love that, it is just the same old thing. This goes into depth and you actually like or dislike the characters. That is what I have to say.
0316056871|5.0|Tina Fey always finds a way to entertain us. Love her stories! A  glimpse into how this great comedian came to be.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Twists I wasn't expecting. A good read that I didn't want to put down. Well written and I look forward to reading more of Colleen Hoover's books!
1439152802|5.0|We read this in our book club and everyone liked it.  We were totally surprised at the ending.  It's the type of book you can't put down.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Works great, charges quick. Must have for Kindle, as other charger that are sold in stores do not charge well.
068987149X|5.0|This book has a great message. Great things can come in small packages. Small things can make a big difference
B000LC55F2|5.0|Hugh Jackman is one of my favorite actors.  Bought this for a friend, and will definitely want to see it.  Haven't had a chance yet, but fast, prompt service, and would recommend to anyone.
B005GFPZYK|3.0|The book was well written from the soldiers point of view.  Be prepared for violence and foul language.  Also hr prepared to feel like you have run some of the battles with the team.
B001LM1456|5.0|older film but loved it, lots of action, well made<br />great special effects, lots of fun. I highly recommend must see
B005K17RU0|5.0|It's great!  When the satellite TV is out, I still know what is going on.  It is an easily accessible weather forecast.
B00004TDTO|5.0|It's Jaws!!! Does there really need to be any more said? I think not. Just watch it. You won't regret it.
B009RH973I|3.0|Thought this one was okay. It was not a sturdy as the duck tape one. Wish I had bought anothe color of ducktape for me.
B00BUCW54Q|4.0|I'm truly surprised with the negative reviews on this movie.  This is a far cry from Mission Impossible (and billed quite differently) yet a well-played Cruise portrays a retired MP who seeks the truth - no matter the cost.  \\"Yes\\" it is somewhat predictable, and \\"yes\\" it is not reality, but for a movie -this was pretty good.  Little language, and no sex... Give it a try.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|Great movie! It was very entertaining from beginning to end.  I saw The Return of the King, The Two Towers and The Return of the King.  The Hobbit movie just made it all a complete set.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|This is another great film by Quentin Tarantino. It's bloody and raw and doesn't apologize for anything. A must see for a Tarantino fan and a must see for any film lover.
B004EPZ07U|4.0|While I found the movie tolerable, but not great.. my wife loved it. I have a feeling it was due to the lead actor.
B007NVIB5U|4.0|I am unclear if this was the complete series, as the actor bios indicate more episodes than prime presented for viewing. Many of the storylines were used later in the remake for television in the US . Take a look at this import, it is worth your time.
B007KAJG3K|4.0|It's not as good as the first one, but it was still a pretty fun movie. My wife loves Sherlock holmes, the BBC show, the CBS one, and the movies.. all different, but all fun in their own right.
B0007MWZEK|4.0|This is my second sweeper...I really love it but am very disappointed the the technology  that developed this machine hasn't been able to come up with a better battery.  The quality control on the batteries is very much below par.  Even my brand new ones frequently do not work well.  The replacement batteries are not much better and cost almost as much as the sweeper.  Swivel Sweeper needs to get on the ball with this otherwise my next sweeper  my come from someplace else.
B00164GDD2|5.0|It's ghostbusters.. in HD.. Do I need to say more? Great movie that now looks great on my hd tv.
B007ZSBQYE|2.0|The idea for the game is good, but I agree with the other reviewers that said the controls are difficult. Frustrating is not fun, so I have already uninstalled this app.
B0014D6PCO|4.0|I purchased this on bluray and got the digital for free.. It's a good movie.. I enjoyed it and wish they would make one or two more with the same crew, but I understand why the staff wanted to move on. If you liked the other two you will enjoy this one.
B00AEUPOVQ|5.0|I love Jane Austen's story and appreciate a film that sticks as much as possible to the story and time period.
B008RC72G8|5.0|I know many panned it.. but I really enjoyed the movie. I thought it was funny at moments, and quirky.
B007HPO3CC|4.0|Had meant to read the books before watching the show, but couldn't hold out so picked it up and really enjoy it.  Lots of action and intrigue with great characters and storytelling.  All set in the land of 'fantasy', but I think it reaches beyond fans of fantasy and would be enjoyable to others if they simply give it a try.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|We have this one and the one for matt smith and they are fun little toys to sit on the shelf next to other Dr. who stuff.
B00364K6YW|5.0|I loved this version of Pride and Prejudice!! I have the two-hour version starring Kiera Knightly that I also love and had watched many times before even reading the book. After reading the book I realized there was so much more to the story than could be told in two hours. So, I searched for a longer version and, after reading many reviews, decided on this one. It does an excellent job of telling the entire story. I highly recommend it.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Great game, very creative and still fun to play. I have beat the game and it took a long time to do so, but there are so many mini games that you can still play it for hours and hours after you beat it. It really is a good game.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Was a great movie, was able to watch with the kids and they both (boy & girl) liked it so much we had to buy the soundtrack as well.  The soundtrack is not as good as the movie because the singers are different.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|Bought this for my son's 44th Birthday and he loved it, although I have to say  it's not exactly my taste in music!
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|We have watched this movie at least ten times since I purchased it.  My youngest grandson who is going  to be four, really loves it. Funny, and full of action.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is awesome it has so much to do. my cousin built a mansion and to get there you have to travel through woods and I have it and play it every day you should see my create world it is full of houses buildings statues and more if you don't like it I think you should
B00BJS7104|5.0|It is not for the weak hearted, but it is really a great movie. I highly recommend for any action lovers!
B000AOEMXM|5.0|Even though it goes off the beaten path of the original series, it still makes for an interesting take on the &#34;pioneering&#34; of the Star Trek series. You just have to be willing to see outside the box.
B00006ZXSK|5.0|I enjoyed this movie. It throws a light on how vulnerable like is, and the position our love ones are left in when the ineffable occurs. But it also teaches that we can rise above bad situations.  Great story.
B009YN2M7S|4.0|Great story! Nicolas Sparks has done once again. I enjoyed the twists and the feelings of being by Katie 's side as he told the story.
B003F3FJQO|4.0|A great leisure read. Much faster-paced and readable than The Maze Runner. I enjoyed it very much. I recommend it.
B00A0HQ7H8|5.0|Lana Del Rey's love of the Hollywood American Dream Girl story removes the mask of her last album BORN TO DIE and sings a moody soul. The cover it self implies every change to expect in the music this time out with her hair down more free and no buttons about her with a more wild and raw world behind her. This is the second chance album I hoped would follow. Her voice shines in a dark room where I sit sipping Whiskey Straight in a leather chair as I light up a clove and stare upon a poster of the ASPHALT JUNGLE staring more Norma Jean then Marlyn Monroe. The Explicit aspect of the album are sung demands to have you perk your ears and hear what she is singing, some times its tongue in cheek and and others seem like a tongue sticking out but one thing is for sure, I will never drink Pepsi the same again.
1250012570|3.0|I really wanted to like this book. The premise seemed interesting, and I liked the concept of the chracters, but something kept me from really enjoying it. This book wasn't bad per say, but I found myself unable to connect with it in the way I wished I had been able to.<br /><br />The characters felt a bit flat to me. They were quirky on the surface, but other than their interest in comics, and edgier bands they felt shallow as people. I was especially disappointed by Eleanor. I understand why she acts the way she does, but I can't help but feel let down by the way she seems content to leave her sister and brothers to fend for themselves in their volatile home while she runs away to Park's house. She does nothing, and I mean nothing, to help any of them, and that frustrates me. She doesn't tell her guidance councilor, she doesn't call DHHS or the police, and she doesn't even confide in Park of his parents. She knows she has options, but she consciously chooses to do nothing. I know she's afraid of making things worse, but every time she complains about her sister, or worries about her mother's boyfriend, I can't help but think that maybe the reason her sister acts the way she does is the violent atmosphere they live in. I dislike her weak empathy, and victim complex. I understand she is a child, and it isn't her responsibility to raise or care for her siblings, but to do nothing, and pretty much leave them to deal with it made me dislike her.<br /><br />Park was hard for me to get a grip on. He seemed like he could have been interesting, but in some ways he was a bit too good perfect, and<br />too understanding of Eleanor. He says he likes her, but I just wasn't able to get a good grasp of why. He went from disliking her to loving her too quickly. I think their relationship was another sticking point. It felt awkward, and forced. Things moved too quickly for me, even for teenage love, and it made it difficult for me to buy into the rest of the book. They went from dislike to love, and I got lost somewhere in between. With Eleanor holding so much back how could they really be in love?<br /><br />The secondary characters were interesting.

The challenges are great to work for.Especially the daily challenge.You could spend days and days without food and play subway surfers instead of eating or drinking fluids.meeting your goal to beat the entire game will be a success. You can have the best time ever if you buy this app. Besides it's free. So get Subway Suffers today ,and don't forget it is free<br /><br />  Blah blah blah
0515149489|2.0|I only picked this book up because of the search and rescue and dog training but it's just WAY too long! Would have been a better book at around 350 pages instead of 450. Cut, cut, cut, Nora! I started skimming half-way through the book and it was the only way I could finish. I enjoyed the dog training but.....just toooooo much! I have to wonder who wrote all these rave reviews.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|It's simply classic and great! It keeps me busy because I do really enjoy playing  this wonderful interesting game! The a lot Amazon......You are really amazing!!!
1400069807|4.0|This is an odd book to review. If you're like me, a cook and a foodie, not much of the information in SALT, SUGAR, FAT will be new or surprising. The take home message of the book is something that I've known for years: processed food is bad, avoid it whenever possible. But, really, even the most devoted consumers of junk food probably already know that salt, sugar, and fat are both dangerously delicious and also unhealthy, when consumed in excess.<br /><br />So, hey, lets start out with: a book that tells you things you already know.<br /><br />And then there's the fact that while SALT, SUGAR, FAT presents itself as a sort of whistle-blowing expos&eacute;, drawing back the curtain on the processed food industry and sounding the alarm, it reads an awful lot like a business book. The passages where Michael Moss describes the invention of Tang and instant pudding could be cut and pasted into a different book, titled \\"Processed Food: Genius Secrets of Huge Money-Making Success\\" without much modification. He interviews a lot of food scientists and lets them tell their side of the story, what happened behind the scenes to make this or that junk food possible, and it's easy to imagine a budding MBA taking notes.<br /><br />So the tone is occasionally odd.<br /><br />In fact, in retrospect I'm not sure what makes this book so great, or why I found it riveting. But I did, and the first time I went to the grocery store after I started reading -- and every time since -- was a revelation. The grocery store looked different to me. I was alert, wary, mistrustful. The food all looked hostile.<br /><br />I'm a cook and a foodie -- I said that, right? -- but I can get lazy. And it's easy for laziness to become a habit, and then they have you. And I can be outright duped -- the section on dairy came as a total surprise to me. Whole milk is only 3% fat? 2% milk is a marketing trick? What?!<br /><br />In the end, I'd call SALT, SUGAR, FAT a corrective. A useful reminder, with all the information necessary to make its points stick. I'd recommend it to anyone.ation necessary to make its points stick. I'd recommend it to anyone.
B000TU16GS|5.0|It's an awesome series starter which makes me want me read the rest of the mysterious series of alex rider.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Love it but noticed after three random draws it always drawls a winning hand. I know I'm going to lose the first two but I always win on the third. Not complaining, who can when it's free. Good enjoyment!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|In love with all the fifty shades books. Super interesting and keeps your attention the whole way through. Definitely recommend it. It's like a love story but sexy at the same time. Not your everyday love story but so much better.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Great read. Only wish you got to see more insight into the &#34;after&#34;. Wonderful twists and turns. I hope the movie does it justice.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I love a good legal drama. The stories are believable and its done tastefully, not too much violence or nudity. If the writers keep you entranced without that...that's good drama!
B00873GRU4|5.0|Although the premise is a familiar one (a post-apocalyptic world) Wool is refreshingly different in it's take on things.<br />The characters are deep and engaging, and Hugh paints a startling world where society is almost indistinct from the architecture that contains it, it is so defining. You are left wanting to know so much more about this world, and what happens to these characters.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|I certainly not disappointed after season one. The suspense, and cleverness keeps coming. I definitely have my characters I love to love.
B007KZY1YY|5.0|I wastold the book was good so i bought it and it is very good I want to read the others book from E J James
B00755MHV8|5.0|I never thought this book is going to have such a profound effect in my life. While it takes the tone of a self-help book, what makes it stand out, are it's great relevant and contemporary examples. Taking leaves out of his personal network made the arguments even stronger. Last but not least, his ABZ planning theory is so apt in today's world. Work on a plan A, plan for an alternate plan (plan B) and when every thing fails, plan Z is the ultimate fall back option. It is pointless to have any other plan. Through and through easy reading, compelling narrative and a masterpiece worthy of sharing the space with other great masters.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Fast paced fun that makes it hard to put down. More exciting than the other 3 match games.  Great game!
B00AZKCU7G|4.0|Great edition for a great film.<br />Classic but informative bonuses on the film.<br />Just one minor complaint: the international introduction to the film explaining the historical context of the story is not included in the edition.
B008RV5K5E|5.0|This was exactly what I wanted. Item was perfectly described and I would happily purchase again. Great quality and price
0670019933|5.0|This my favorite of kerouac's thus far... I definitely recommend it. It was a gift for my gf. I have a paperback but the hardcover looks nice. Seemed to be a neat little intro letter I failed to read but I'm sure it was good... Anyway... Eastern religion, bohemian lifestyle, and Jack's alcoholism are all found in this romantic novel about zen and hiking.... There's a lot of wisdom in wine he says
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|This was exactly what I wanted. Item was perfectly described and I would happily purchase again. Great quality and price
B004UXUUDA|3.0|I am trying to write this without including spoilers...<br /><br />I would recommend the movie because it is a good story and because I am always a fan of Kristin Scott Thomas!  However, I watched the movie right after finishing the book and was disappointed in some of the decisions made to convert the story into a movie. Understanding that not every character will be included and new characters might inexplicably pop up, I feel that some of the decisions obscured important and complex themes raised in the book and resulted in melodrama.  For example, I feel that the character of Julia's husband Bertrand was miscast.  What defines her husband's character and, importantly, drives some of Julia's later decisions gets totally lost.<br /><br />Less importantly I don't understand why her daughter Zoe became pretty much a non-entity in the movie while she was actually a strong supporter of Julia in the book.  They might have just as well cut her character since she does nothing for the story line.<br />One of the issues that Sarah grappled with is that she felt inadequately prepared by her parents for the possibility of such a horrific event.  Had she been less protected she might have acted differently in the beginning (not leaving her brother behind).  Zoe, close in age to Sarah during the round-up, is a similarly strong character who wants to understand what is happening and why things are going on (especially in regards to her family).<br /><br />I believe the story lines where tied up too neatly, characters and issues were watered down and simplified, and in the middle of the movie, an important change in the story takes away entirely what was Julia's motivation in the first place (in the book) of trying to find Sarah - explaining that her in-law's were a good and caring family after all.  So, while I would encourage anyone to watch the movie, I would really recommend reading the book first.<br /><br />I had not known about the events associated with the Vel d'Hiv and the movie very successfully depicts the horrors of the round-up, the camps and the sense of helplessness and despair.  The scenes are powerful and will stay with me.  I believe the movie succeeded less in the second half where I didn't feel a strong connection with the characters anymore. Don't really want to harp on it but if I hadn't read the book before, I would have not understood many of Julia's actions (as well as the depiction of the older Sarah) or thought them overly melodramatic.
B004EPYZUS|5.0|This movie is great! Tom Cruise never fails when making movies. It's always a success. One of my favorite actor of all time.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|It's been so many years since I read the book I can't recall how well the movie followed the original story.  Maybe just as well - as it is I did enjoy the movie very much.  The only problem I had is with my old and whistling ears I was able to understand very little of what Golum had to say (hope I got it's name right).  I watched the Blu-Ray version, and the sound and picture quality were outstanding.  Oh, one other problem - it being a &#34;cliffhanger&#34;!  Am looking forward to part two to complete the story (I do remember the story was completed in one book).
1401233384|5.0|I started collecting comic books not long ago and one of the things that motivated me to start doing it was the fact that DC comics was &#34;reeboting&#34; their books. But the new 52's precursor was this book, Flashpoint. I really loved the story and the art is amazing. This must be part of your DC comics book collection.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|I rarely bother seeing movies in the theater any more.  Too expensive, and I can just wait for the DVD. However, I went to see Quartet three times in a row in the theater!!!  Each time with a different friend...each of whom loved it.  The reason it's great in the theater is because Director Dustin Hoffman OBVIOUSLY wants the audience to participate in the climax. Which, uniquely, takes place during the credits.  It was a little disappointing to see -- on two occasions -- how few people \\"got\\" this, and how many did not stay on for the credits (which takes place during the Quartet that the entire movie is building up to).    The one time the audience did understand, there was a great ovation, which is obviously what the Director is \\"asking\\" -- for the audience to participate.  But Hoffman has a special surprise for those patient enough for the credits.  Brilliant end. Kudos to Hoffman....or whoever thought of that idea with the credits.    Still...even without a theater audience to participate, this is a feel good movie which I will be buying to add to my list of 4 movies I can watch over and over, and still love.  And I will be ordering it as gifts for several friends and family, as it wasn't widely distributed at the \\"big chain\\" theaters.    Great Cast! Billy Connolly steals (and makes) the show, playing a classy and exceptionally charming version of himself -- with a hair cut.  Dame Maggie's character, Jean Horton, is a beautifully crafted opposite of the very endearing-with occasional bouts of dementia -- Pauline Collins' character Cissy. The late-in-life healing of a love gone bad reminds us all of many lessons in life.  And the entire movie is a great illustration of both the tragedy of aging, but the salvation of a supportive community, as well as paying homage to aging talent....which may live on for many, many years after the \\"glory days\\" are over.    Sheridon Smith's character of Dr. Lucy Cogan is an inspiration for all of us. This character's tenderness andappreciation for and genuine love of those who have dedicated their lives to the classical performing arts is a beautiful metaphor for how all those who have given so much in their prime would be treated in old age, were it a perfect world. She is a beauty inside and out. As Connolly's character says, she's the craic.    I'm not even an opera fan, but I truly loved the music. It keeps on playing in my head. And the comparison between Opera and rap in the movie -- during an educational class with very modern teenagers -- is brilliant and fun.  Enjoy this movie with friends and family....of all ages and musical persuasions. [...]
0143122916|4.0|I lived as an American in South Korea for a little over a year. The tension between the two Koreas has never dissipated. This book does a great job of making the world aware of what goes on \\"behind the closed doors\\" of North Korea. You will undoubtably feel sorry for the author. A very good story that is well told.
030758836X|2.0|I had to stop and start this book several times due to things going on in my life. When I was finally able to have time to read this book I started over again so I could keep everything straight. I was really upset when I finished that I had spent so much time trying to read it. The characters were unlikeable. The end wasn't an end. I simply disliked this book on every level.
B00BCZU8WM|4.0|It's just Justin.....not my favorite CD of his music; I guess it's worth 4 stars. I'll continue buying his music.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|OMG! This book is just too much.  It takes you on an emotional ride and doesn't let you go until it end...and then it still holds your heart!  There are so many emotions that you go through while reading this book that you aren't sure if you are going to ever get off the roller-coaster anytime soon.  It is a MUST READ!!!!
B00AFEY354|3.0|That being said, it's not HORRIBLE either. Other than Charlie, the main character, I couldn't really fall in love with the supporting cast. Emma Watson is adorable but not lovable. that seems to be the story for the whole film in fact. It hovers on the edge of something special but never really achieves it. If I had ever seen this movie on some cable network, I wouldn't have bought it. It was cute but it wasn't something I'm going to long to watch over and over again.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|I have to say I have fallen in LOVE with Macklemore and Ryan Lewis! LOVE his album can listen on repeat!
0810996596|5.0|If you, or a loved one, LOVES movie monsters and collects them, you really should get this book. Kirk Hammett has a top notch monster memorbilia collection second to none. Props, lunch boxes, dolls...you name it! It's clear that he has a passion for monster movies and has taken a great deal of care in collecting everything that he  can. The pictures in the book are very well done and you can really see all the details in the items he owns. Truthfully, the book is just a lot of fun.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|The item arrive in excellent conditions and I love Indiana Jones and more now in blu-ray. The audio and the resolution is perfect.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|reading the Hobbit is not the same as watching the movie. Peter Jackson takes all manner of creative detours and just randomly adds things that never existed in the book at all. The weird little bit about the elves standing on the hill watching a dragon destroy the dwarves home...yeah... where did that come from? While I like the movie, I can't help but wonder WHY Peter Jackson felt as though these things needed to be added. The Hobbit was such a great book that it seems really odd. Then again, if he can make three movies instead of just two, he makes more money. Sooo...there you go.
B005LCYR7Y|5.0|Stephen King did not fail to come up with the goods in this story. Very interesting theory and well put together. Made you think really hard about what you might want to change yourself if you ever could go back in time. The characters were well developed and some good plot changes that really kept you wondering what was going to happen next.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone, not just hard core dyed in the wool Stephen King fans.
0062011847|5.0|SOme people hav expressed their lack of enthusiasm for Snuff, but I don't agree with them at all. It shows Sam Vimes in a close-up that is consistant with earlier Vimesology, and blends humor with humanitarianism. Good on Sir Terry. I enjoyed it completely. And I've been reading T.P. since that young man first appeared on this side of the pond.
1401238580|5.0|Hey, this was really swell. It included everything I asked for, including a spiffy mask. So yeah, I was thrilled!!!

0823003035|3.0|A beautiful book with beautiful figure drawings.  As a beginner, I found it tedious to follow for learning purposes. I have improved my drawing skills since I received this book and I may give it a try again as the drawings are quite inspiring.
B000FA5SMK|4.0|Good story line.  Script was conversational and humorous. I enjoyed the character John Corey. Some of the details about Kidd's treasure could have been less detailed
B002SAUCBC|2.0|I was quite enthralled in this book. So many unanswered questions, I was excited to get to the end .So I read almost non-stop. Then the end was such a huge let down that I was downright mad. Waste of my time. Total waste of my time.
B004UPALT6|5.0|I have seen this movie several times and it's always entertaining. The effects and Bruce Campbell's humor makes this one of my all time favorites. If you like this genre you HAVE to see this movie and the other two in the series as well!
B00B2G4O2G|5.0|this is one of the best new TV shows!! Kevin Bacon is great as Ryan Hardy.  It is a must see, watch from the beginning you won't stop.  Great show!! SO glad it got renewed for a second season!! HIGHLY recommend! it is a definite must see..

0812993845|4.0|Nobody is going to try to argue this book deserves a Pulitzer Prize. But then, if you know Sophie Kinsella, that's not why you're reading this. I enjoyed it for what is was worth and pretty much exactly what I was expecting. Really, I fell in love with Kinsella during her Shopaholic days, but I admit those books got old for me (and so, so predictable), so I was excited when she branched out more. I actually loved I've Got Your Number, her last book. Wedding Night I didn't love quite as much, but it was still a refreshing break from the Shopaholics. And I'll still read every single book Kinsella comes out with!<br /><br />Of course, this book has the quirky \\"always getting into trouble\\" main character and, of course, most of it is predictable, too. And some parts really not believable. But it is entertaining and you will fall in love with Kinsella's characters. I recommend this one for a beach vacation or even better... a honeymoon!

B007J4T2G8|5.0|As a new mom, sometimes reading something that transports you is much needed. Though this book is a little redundant using repeated phrases, it didn't bother me. I relate this book to a good movie that you become addicted to and want to keep watching over and over. The characters are well developed enough and it's a fun read. I am actually re-reading the series and am still loving it.

The solo material wound up becoming his debut album \\"A Strange Arrangement\\". The recording was more steeped in the sounds of Blue Magic, Curtis Mayfield and The Stylistics than the Motown era- which at the time was the go-to sound for soul music revivalists. Released in 2009, it was critically acclaimed and garnered him fans such Snoop Dogg and hip hop producer Nottz- both of whom invited Mayer to appear on their albums. Not surprisingly, the major labels came calling and he inked a recording contract with Universal Republic, where he would release his sophomore effort \\"How Do You Do\\".<br /><br />As always, all of the songs were written, produced, performed and played by Mayer Hawthorne himself. Only this time around, he makes a concentrated effort to pull in a wider audience. On the song \\"Can't Stop\\", he duets with Snoop- who decides to sing instead of rap on his guest appearance. On the song \\"The Walk\\", he sings of his desire to walk away from a woman who mistreated him. The songs \\"Stick Around\\" and \\"You're Not Ready\\" have guitar played by legendary Motown session musician Dennis Coffey. He sings of wanting to end a relationship on the brief \\"The News\\", while being happy in love despite having a bad day on \\"You Called Me\\". Fitz & The Tantrums singer Noelle Scaggs contributes background vocals on the upbeat \\"A Long Time\\". He proceeds a serious relationship with caution on the ballad \\"You're Not Ready\\", while ending the album with the song about casual sex \\"No Strings\\". Mayer Hawthorne's \\"How Do You Do\\" is a listenable recording, but suffers from a rather monotonous sound. Despite the overall sameness tone, it's still an album worth checking out.worth checking out.
B0001I561E|5.0|I just love the rhythmic flow and quirky humor.<br />So glad that I was able to purchase a new copy.<br />I only had it on VHS until now.

B00BAYLRNO|4.0|This is a hard movie to watch just because it's a downer for the entire runtime. Not many moments of happiness. Overall though, it's a well made, superbly acted film. I thought the pacing was nice. Many people complain about it becoming slow, but after that first 45 minutes, slow is what was needed to give the audience some time to breath. This isnt a Michael Bay action film.<br /><br />About it being \\"racist\\", I disagree. Why was the movie not about a Thai family and their struggles? Because the studio needs to sell it to the \\"Western Market\\" so that means making the target audience relate to the cast. Also, making the family foreigners adds more to their struggle because of the language barrier and not knowing the area. If the movie was made for the Eastern Market, then Thai/Asian's would be cast. Im sure a movie with native people of Thai would have been just as heart wrenching, if not more so. But movies with subtitles dont sell as well in the western market. The studio wants to make a profit when they invest tens of millions into a production. Put skin color aside and just realize this is a movie about \\"a family\\". Race had nothing to do with anything in the movie. If you thought it was racist, check yourself in the mirror.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|An artfully crafted mosaic of details making a rousing, though often horrifying, picture. The characters and their many back stories are very individual, and very human.  Their competing desires and interests keep you reading to see what happens next, with smaller reveals that make the story much more rich than a simple fantasy tale. The food, geography, clothing, seasons, and of course the heraldry, are colorful pieces that make up the image, not just for the mind's eye, but for its ears, nose, skin, and mouth as well.<br /><br /> This second book has more comic relief than the first, but also more grisly scenes. GoT is definitely not for kids or sensitive readers. As implied above, there are many characters, plus many locales and sub stories to keep track of.  It was helpful to use the search function of the Kindle edition, which also has separate lists of characters, places, and organizations *without* spoilers (unlike Wikipedia), and a switch to add spoilers to the list information (but only if wanted).  One small quibble was, though the text of the book is searchable, the lists aren't.
B006CHML4I|5.0|Just buy it.<br />You would be happy. Solid construction and looks pretty good.<br />I always like a bit smaller and thinner watches. It is a great fit for my wrist. You may change it to a black leather strap to convert it for a formal look as well.<br />Worth for every penny.
B00C1XZ2LQ|4.0|Like the film, the soundtrack to Oblivion by M83 borrows here and there from other sources, but remains an experience worth the cost of purchase. The film itself relies on the experience of the atmosphere, the acting, the direction, and the soundtrack in order to propel itself beyond the paper-thin storytelling and premise, and the soundtrack by no means is a small piece in the success of the film. Multiple tracks borrow from Hans Zimmer and Daft Punk's soundtracks from Batman and Tron, respectively, but at the same time carry the heft of a true, original score deep beneath the layers of cinematic aptitude. Indeed, this is full-on M83, sweeping and emotional, majestic and down-to-earth, capturing human emotion in a world where humans no longer can live. It's an excellent ride, one I highly recommend, and if you find yourself thinking you've heard parts of this somewhere else, well, that's because you have. But it does the familiar well, and crafts uniquity out of that familiarity, and while not always grasping, it certainly reaches, and leaves the listener with an experience like none other.

B00AYB1TP0|4.0|What We Liked:<br /><br />Alphabet Aquarium is a charmingly interactive alphabet puzzle book.  It includes so many different alphabet-based puzzles, 26 letters x 4 puzzles each = 104 alphabet oriented puzzles in all, it's great for puzzle loving children who go through puzzle apps in a hurry!<br /><br />Because it includes so much repetition of letter names, simple words that start with the letters of the alphabet, and bright, clear illustrations, this app also makes a great puzzle-driven alphabet storybook.  It can be used as a first words vocabulary book.<br /><br />I tried this app out with both my 2 and 4-year-old.  My 2-year-old really enjoyed it; she's our biggest puzzle builder on the iPads and the navigation was very simple for her to run independently.  Her favorite part was building the animal puzzles and playing with the cute baby animals once they were finished - this is also the most challenging puzzle for little ones since it goes piece by piece (triggering more visual matching skills) instead of allowing free choice.<br /><br />My 4-year-old (almost 5) was less excited about it, since the entire app was puzzle based, it was a bit repetitive for her, and she's ready for more advanced apps that include tracing instead of just puzzle placements.  I think this level of difficulty is best for toddlers and early preschool.<br /><br />That being said, I always like options that let parents select which activities are included in the app's rounds. If there is an activity that's too hard or too easy for your child, you can remove it from the rotation.<br /><br />What We Didn't Like:<br /><br />Like many alphabet books, this app doesn't include explicit phonics and some of the puzzles include objects with both short and long letter sounds (like aquarium and airplane in the same puzzle).  The letters never say their sounds, only their names, and the app is also upper case only.<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />Alphabet Aquarium is a bright and colorful puzzle-based alphabet app that contains a HUGE number of alphabet puzzles.  With 4 different puzzle types there are 104 educational puzzles in all!  With lots of alphabet words and sentences included, the app also makes a nice first-words alphabet storybook that's driven by puzzle completion.d alphabet app that contains a HUGE number of alphabet puzzles.

B0083ZRAJS|5.0|The Wonderful Wizard of Oz is written in an unsophisticated style, a throw back to when times were simpler.  For children, it is a tale of Dorothy's adventure into the fantasy world of the Land of Oz.  For adults, the book offers an interesting counterpoint to the Wizard of Oz movie.  It's fascinating to see what details were added and what details were omitted in the screenplay adaptation.
B00A861QMM|1.0|Graphics just do not grab my interest, not much plot and puzzles are pretty generic. Do I really have to say more?

B002BPRZU0|5.0|As it was with Beth Hart Joe Bonamassa is yet another stellar performer that I have just recently discovered.  This guy can really play the guitar!!!  At the tender age of eight Joe's father brought home a viceo tape of Clapton playing the Royal Albert Hall.  Upon viewing the tape Joe thought he could do that.  At the age of twelve he opened  for B.B. King.  Fast forward many years and it is Joe on the stage of Albert Hall.  This album is the real deal.<br /><br />Also recommended is Joe and Beth Hart in collaboration  on &#34;Don't Explain&#34;.

B00C7L2QCA|1.0|The primary flaw with this adaptation is the portrayal of Hannibal. The actor plays him overtly creepy, yet none of the other characters seem to notice. Hannibal would need a great deal of charm to pull off the things he does, but this guy is as appealing as a cockroach. And he's one of the oddest, ugliest characters you've ever seen. For some reason, the autistic genius profiler can figure out everything but the fact that Lechter is a killer. And Lawrence Fishburn is sleeping-walking through this thing. It's too bad. The main character is kind of interesting. But no one actor can save this mess.

B009IEXKXI|5.0|Note added 2/6/15: The link to the book no longer works because there is a new publisher. Search for The Martian: A Novel, by Andy Weir.<br /><br />For those who aren't sure, and some reviews suggest the reviewers didn't realize what they were getting into, this is genuine 'hard' science fiction. It's an astronaut trapped on Mars using all his technical know-how to survive until the next team of explorers are due to return. This is a hostile environment like none of us on Earth can imagine. And we get to look over his shoulder as he finds new uses for the equipment that his own team left behind when they had to leave unexpectedly in the middle of a sandstorm, believing him dead. He has a lot to overcome--for instance, making his food last so that he won't starve, and finding a way to travel huge distances to reach the site where the next team is expected to land. I am not a scientist, and wouldn't know what is and isn't possible, but the book sure reads as if the author did an enormous amount of research. I, personally, did not find any of the science boring. On the contrary, it's awesome, and absolutely integral to a story of survival. It's not entirely dry, though. There's a lot of humor in the astronaut's irreverent attitude. Considering his predicament, his attitude is entirely justified. I thoroughly enjoyed this book all the way through to the end.
B004OBQDHK|5.0|It is a great movie for the action seeker! It also has some of the best surf cinematography a movie could have for it's time.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I broke my arm and had to stay in bed for a few days so I bought Season 1-3 and loved it!<br /><br />The characters were lovable and hateable at the same time! However I am quite disappointed at how season 3 ended.... Booooo<br /><br />I enjoyed learning about the life of that era and from the view of the servants. Very interesting!! Makes me wish we taught all children these days about etiquette, manners and proper socialites. I appreciated the modest behaviors of the women as well.<br /><br />I would recommend this to all girls age 15+ and all women. I think men would like it too but not in my household! Haha<br />The only reason I say 15+ is because of occasional swearing and some episodes have inappropriate sexual relations.
B00BGZ8TVA|5.0|The movie moves a bit slow at first, using a lot of details to set up the theme.  The acting is good.  It becomes quite exciting as the move continues. While the scenes flow together well, you can't really anticipate what will happen next.  At the end you are left with two views of the tail and must decide which is the &#34;truth.&#34;
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|Great movie, great package. Even if you don't like video games this is a lot of fun. If you do then all the better! Lots of references to old skool characters.<br /><br />Having a downloadable copy as well just ices the cake.
076115678X|4.0|This has a lot of tips and good information for anyone wanting to go all the way to curly. Some of it is elementary and self-explanatory but there are a lot of things in this book that are very helpful and that one may not know or pick up on their own. Even though I am short and straight (my hair) now, and my curls are cut off and gone, I still use some of the advice and tips like making one's own spray mist to refresh curls, or in my case, to smooth down the crazy cowlicks I wake up with. A spray bottle, water and pure lavender oil to your preference level, and you have the homemade version of the spray Deva Curl sells for a stupid high price. It's worth reading for sure.

1936608898|5.0|I've been an athlete all my life and always in good shape but the older I got the harder it got to maintain. I often found myself in a blind rage if I went more than a few hours without a meal.  My energy levels were not consistent and I never knew from one hour to the next how I would feel. I got by on energy drinks and by eating constantly ( Im 6'2 and 225) but if I forgot to pack enough food or got called into an unscheduled meeting and missed a meal I was literally a monster. This book has helped me back on the right path. I'm not going to say its easy regardless of the things the authors compare it to that are unquestionably harder. I will say its worth it. I look and feel exponentially better and my energy levels now stay at a point I was only able to achieve for a short time with supplements before.<br /><br />I've read other paleo, primal books but this one is the best for people who just want to feel better with a little bit of the how mixed in ( or not if you skip those chapters).

B00APJLFEG|4.0|Overall, my kids and I enjoyed this movie.  We laughed a lot, and I didn't spend most of the time cringing at questionable material.  There are some rather random parts in the plot, which is yet another variation on the &#34;Parents-do-stupid-things-to-protect-their-kids&#34; theme.  Still, one of the better family shows I've seen.  Best of all, it has MONSTERS!
B005LAIHZY|5.0|The adults like it (hey, the princess doesn't get married off in the end for once!), the little kid likes it (hence everyone having seen it a dozen times or more by now), and the teen even loves it (because the princess is pretty kick-butt).

1481130331|5.0|In THE LUCK OF THE WEISSENSTEINERS, Christoph Fischer offers a new and unusual look at World War II from Bratislava, the capital of Czechoslovakia and subsequently of Slovakia. A delicate balance of relationships, business endeavors and cultures permeated the area in the days leading up to Hitler's conquest.  Love and betrayal, avarice and poverty, struggle and survival are themes found in masterful writing by Fischer.<br />The complexity of the many plot threads requires diligent reading as the lives of characters become entwined only to often unravel. At first, the book appears to be a love story but romance blooms and quickly dies, setting the stage for ongoing struggles of the Jewish family, the Weissensteiners (Greta,) and the Catholic German family of the Winkelmeiers (Wilhelm.) In several characters, the author draws a strong developmental picture, as with mentally ill Wilma Weissensteiner or with cold and brutish Johanna Winkelmeier who belatedly develops compassion. Other studies include the Contessa whose benevolence deserts her in the end and her friends, a lesbian couple.<br />The real gift of the novel lies in Fischer's exploration of the history and peoples of Bratislava with its multi-cultural roots and centuries of invasion and dominance by outsiders. He opened new doors for this reader in seeing the war from a different perspective, that of central Europe as opposed to the more familiar Atlantic rim. As other reviewers have noted, the narrative voice and the plethora of characters can overwhelm the reader. Despite these criticisms, THE LUCK OF THE WEISSENSTEINERS is a powerful, engaging and informative read.

I hope there are more books very soon.
0199536228|5.0|Atty. Mr. Utterson is worried, as the keeper of Dr Henry Jekyll's will. The will gives everything to Edward Hyde incase of Henry's death or disappearance.  Mr. Utterson met the hideous Hyde once and does not trust him. Well it looks like Henry's will will have to be executed as the housekeeper; Mr. Pool thinks Hyde hid Henry's body.<br /><br />Once again, I saw Spencer Tracy before I read the book, so I was anticipating a different type of story. I read \\"Treasure Island\\" so I am familiar with Stevenson's writing style but I did not realize that this story was more of a mystery that draws the conclusion and revelation in the end. The explanation of man and his duel personality is excellent and I suspect he draws on personal experience.<br /><br />I also read the kindle version. It was sparse and strait forward; there was not a lot of fluff and speculation from other personalities. I made sure that the text-to speech was activated before purchasing. This helped but I had to keep reminding myself that the names were mispronounced.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0000EYUD4 Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde Double Feature (1932/1941)]]

B000Y5JFNE|5.0|I am very satisfied with the quality of this blu-ray. The transfer quality is exceptional, and the extras are quite good. This classic film has never looked and sounded so good. The studio did a very good job with this release. Paradoxically though, the new found level of visual clarity may actually hurt a few of the effect shots, particularly the green screen effect shots involving the tiny brownie duo. This is a common issue with blu-rays of older films that make particularly heavy use of special effects. Luckily though, this issue is seldom noticeable with a few definite exceptions. The extra content includes a few very nice deleted scenes, an older 'making of' documentary, a very nice look at the matte paintings, Warwick Davis' home movies from the production set - narrated by none other than Mr. Davis himself. All in all, this is an excellent film, blu-ray, and a good value for the money.
B0027MJU00|4.0|A very different and gripping novel. Broken people- strange people - emotional people - three dimensional people mixed with an excellent plot and surprise ending . Same there and now structure as her Gone Girl novel but far more intense. I recommend the novel as well worth the time
0140120416|5.0|I wanted to try and cram in as much Russian in a short period of time so Id have enough to build on when I go home to my Russian girlfriend. I must say this book is excellent and breaks the grammar down perfectly. I learned more in 3 days of this book than 2 months of Rosetta Stone and what Ive learned are foundations which I can build on from here on out. If your trying to learn Russian look no further than here.

B00BB8RKH6|3.0|The whole first scene has nudity not needed for the storyline and could have been done differently without effecting the greatness of the movie. Denzel and the story would have been 5 stars except for this scene.
B0015DROBO|5.0|The story is very provocative and kept me wanting to ready more pages<br />even when I was tired.  I would recommend it to people who like suspense.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|This book is difficult for me to read because of the unhealthy<br />sex vocabulary and descriptions.  This is not a book I would recommend.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|I did not even finish the movie and I rarely do that.<br />Would not call this a comedy at all.
0988178532|5.0|You will love Outview! From the second I picked up this book, I had trouble putting it down and couldn't wait to get back to it. It's a great escape from the everyday to a world of mystery and intrigue. Nate and his friends, Kyle and Linh embark on a journey to help Nate confront his fears. Was it all in his head or were the Outviews real? Brandt Legg's thriller is chock full suspense and it takes you on a wild ride! It's a real page-turner and I can't wait to see what happens on book two!
B007JRU2UK|2.0|I expected more from this movie and from George Clooney. I found it boring and it was hard to keep watching.
B009AMANH4|5.0|I have alway loved Lincoln history---this is a great movie that puts of few of the things I have read to the screne.
1568363931|4.0|The food is great regardless if you have the &#34;bento box&#34; to use with it. Meals are well balanced with clever presentation.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I use this every night...sounds are great, very realistic and soothing! Love the timer option! Plus, how can it get any better than FREE?! :)
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|Wonder zoo is a like many games. You create a zoo, collect coins and complete quests. It does however give you a story you play in. A poacher stole the animals<br /> and now you must return or help hurt animal in the wild.
0374531269|4.0|A Long Way Gone was a heartbreaking and incredible story told by Ishmael Beah about his survival during the Sierra Leone war. He told his story like it was just yesterday with such vivid details and examples. When he would explain what was going on throughout his day I felt like I was there with him and seeing it all happen through a screen without being able to help. He lets us feel all the emotion and frustration he is going through. Since we travel with Ishmael throughout the book we see his character transform without him realizing. From a globalized and feminist view I really am upset about how corrupt and destructive our world has become to allow young boys to become murderers. The United States itself has become questionable because it seems weird that we claim to go into other countries to \\"help\\" them out though we never see positive outcomes from this. I have heard of other stories like Ishmael's were United States came to \\"assist\\" but made everything worse such as from my grandparents when they lived in El Salvador. The positive results of Ishmael's publication of his story is that many other people in the world are able to be eye-opened and educated about what kind of world we are living in. I hope more and more people read this book and learn more about what is going on because I bet a lot of people do not even know about this war. I personally enjoyed reading this book it was really easy going and went by pretty quickly. I got really caught up in his story and was able to read it in 4 days. It is a very inspiring and hopeful story that I would recommend to everyone.
0307346609|3.0|I got this book for my brother, never read it but the remake movie comes out this summer and I wanted my brother to see that not all book that are turn in to a movie is not all that diffrant.
1401223176|5.0|This was an awesome must read if you are a fan of Batman in any way. I think if you love Batman you will LOVE this epic graphic novel. It really gives you the feel of all the constant battles that Batman goes through with himself and others.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Won't accept my password. It's easier to just go to Facebook.<br /><br />Hate it. I deleted it from my I phone
B005HJWWW8|3.0|Either I am not using the amp correctly, or I loss the remote capability of my headphones for answering calls and controlling music.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Absolutely love this series of books and i watch the movie on HBO as well.  Definately worth your time and money
B0091CWYQ6|4.0|Works fine, and easy to use. The clamp is a little impractical because the tension isn't tight enough, and would be great if there was a choice of cable length. A shorter cable option would eliminate the need for the clip.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|The movie was great in the theaters on opening day, and was great at home two days after it was released!
0316286850|4.0|I tought the book was going to be a hard cover, but it is not. Other than that it is a very good book with a lot of tips and great pictures.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|this alarm clock is a must! works really well. Im thinking about buying it.. so I can use my own music for the alarm. when I use it I keep it plugged in so it don't drain the battery. one feature I love is the dimming option! it works best when the kindles brightness is all the way off.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|So many books, movies, tapes on Lincoln. This movie was a good addition, the acting was good. Good addition to school library.
B00AKKS278|2.0|A rehash of well-documented time management strategies right out of Anthony Robbins’ playbook. Inspirational, but not motivational. Were you doing the strategies? If so, then nothing gained. If it motivates you to start doing what matters most to you, early in the morning before you exhaust your willpower, then, it worked.<br /><br />However, the author already was an achiever prior to implementing his plan. Yes, he writes that were days when it was difficult to get early, etc, but it still reads like the author made a determination to get up early in the morning, to implement Covey’s emotional, spiritual, physical, and mental actions, and he did.<br /><br />Therefore, if you are someone that is struggling on how to get yourself to delineate and implement a &#34;power hour&#34; before sunrise, then this is likely not the book that will get you there.<br /><br />Daniel S. Cruz, Attorney in SW Florida.
B00AO7HQ06|5.0|Great product from great musician.<br />Absolutely fantastic!<br />I have it always on... in my car, on my ipod, on my comp. Duane is God!
B0091REZMW|4.0|I am really enjoying this game and I can't wait to get further.  I have had enough patients and haven't spent any money.
B009YQJ322|3.0|Well...............it is action packed.  There's tons of violence/carnage.  The `Slo-Mo' drug effect was dazzling to behold.  The overall look of the film was dark, grimy, and oddly beautiful.  The story was basic to say the least, and it said the least: Dredd and his psychic sidekick are trapped in a building and must fight off scores of Ma-Ma's henchmen.  It's obvious they want sequels and they will probably churn them out.  I, however, won't be wasting my money or time watching them.<br />I admit, I don't know a thing about the British comic book this movie was based on (apparently, its 35 years of satire aimed squarely at America.  None of it is meant to be flattering.)  So, I had to judge this movie purely on what it delivered, which was a mindless set of incredible action sequences.  Unfortunately, action in and of itself is not particularly interesting unless it's attached to something or someone we can care about.  Dredd is a robotic guy in a uniform that doesn't exude any personality whatsoever.  At one point in this movie, he's fighting 3 fellow judges dressed exactly as he is.  I couldn't tell them apart.  It didn't make any difference, proving that anyone wearing the suitable outfit could play this character.  An automaton persona was all that was required to play any of the characters in this movie, no one stood out.  The star of this movie was obviously meant to be the action sequences.  Making this a fabulous looking offering not unlike Iron Pyrite (pretty, but useless).<br /><br />For me, DREDD lacked the basic elements that I look for which guarantees multiple viewing pleasure.  The missing ingredient here is the human factor.  Dreed was this drab and dreary guy who could just as easily have been a CGI creation.  In fact, they really didn't need any characters at all, just gunfire, explosions, and all that lovely Slo-Mo.<br /><br />Didn't mind watching it once, won't be watching it again.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun game but it is a little slow to go through. Nice game for horse lovers. Hard to get diamonds.
B00026WU82|5.0|In spite of the imperfect quality of his tone, he is masterful as a composer and a performer.  He has influenced so many others to pursue their style of music in spite of what critics tell them.  Dylan puts little faith in his &#34;critics,&#34; and still continues to do what pleases him.  He has also written many songs for others as well.  One of my favorites in &#34;Forever Young&#34; that Joan Baez recorded.  Since Baez has written songs and recorded, I didn't know that Dylan was the one who wrote the song rather than Baez.
0345803507|5.0|Wild, vivatious, sensuous, sexy, can not put any of the books down. Beware, ADULTS only please Moms, Dads, but great adult reading.
B008M4MB8K|5.0|Anyone familiar with Mr, Scott's musings need this evaluation go no further. Those who have a casual relationship with Ridley might recall: Alien, Prometheus, Gladiator, Robin Hood, American Gangster, White Squall, G.I. Jane and many more. If you've no recollection of these films...power down your device; it's time for juice and cookies. Having said this, I already own the 5 disk &#34;Collectors Edition&#34; Blade Runner, as many of you might and there is a lot of redundancy...couldn't care less.
0345803493|5.0|Awesome book. You are made to feel that you just want to help her make the most difficult decision of her existance!  Again, ADULT reading for the folloow up of the other 2!  But can't put the book down. Awesome
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|It is just what I expected.  Some are Christmas songs but some of them are not.  I can play it year round and just skip the Christmas songs. Very soothing.
B003L77GH4|5.0|Are we kidding, what is there not to like, except that now, that Gorgeous Damon & Elana are not as close as we would like, but hey, it is not a love story, it is our fantacy brought to screen!  Love all the Vampire Diaries, & have hooked my girlfriends!  We all have copies of each season!  & waiting for them to come out with the new one on dvd!  Oh, by the way, the discs I received were shipped well, packaged sturdy, & on time. Amazon does a great job, love Amazon.com!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Brought the sixties back alive for me. Very well researched. Gas prices! Cost of a good meal! And the politics and weird goings on surrounding the Kennedy assassination. The atmosphere of this book was just right! Stephen King has done it again.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|This game is super fun. A bit hard from time to time but the more you play the easier it gets.
B007ZXK08C|2.0|I try to avoid reading bestsellers because I get disappointed most of the times. I give the author some credit for the way she decided to narrate the story, showing us Nick's and Amy's point of views throughout the story.<br />However, I think the there were so many things in the book that sounded as copies to me. The case of Amy's parents writing a series of books about their daughter and becoming famous, for example, is just like the case of Brenda's parents in the series Six Feet Under. Moreover, Nick's sister is just like Debra Morgan, Dexter Morgan's sister, these two characters are very similar.<br />I also didn't like Nick, I thought he is too plain, pathetic and hen-pecked. He is apathetic, doesn't have any attitude towards the things that happen during the book. What really got me was the lack of punishment in the story, it seems the police didn't really care, didn't really investigate the crimes in the story.<br />And to finish, I just hated the end. The book started well, it had a good climax torwards the end, but then it seems the author lost the train of thought at the end of story. The end of the book is really frustating, disappointing and nonsense.
B009VIZDLI|4.0|Imagine and Australian Sheldon... An enjoyable rread that is not very demanding and genuinely amusing. A rom-com in a book.
B00B7PIRIE|3.0|The packaging was terrible, it was a box that wasn't completely enclosed and the DVDs could have easily broken. I'm hoping they didn't, I'll find out when I open them on Mother's Day.
B0019LY5IM|5.0|Lost is amazing. This was a favorite season. Definitely one to be seen. Don't let the title discourage! It's a cliffhanger ever episode. And you do have to watch all the seasons. Just to clear that up.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|It's a fun game but to finish your collection is terrible you can have one left and play over and over again and you still dont  get it. And some t ok Mrs it's pain to go through and not get a bingo . Doesn't give you enough time to hit the number or the bingo key to get a bingo
B0036EH3XE|5.0|I loved Lost. Receiving this last season was definitely saddening, but it was such an awesome show. I recommend to anyone with a love for mystery. JJ Abrams definitely gives it out in this!
B003XVYLDU|5.0|Deserves it place in both ,great literary works, and great anti war pieces. Vonneguts blending of his unique fiction and real world events is riveting.
B000WBOV1G|5.0|Great to have this on instant amazon...looking forward to seeing zeason 2 some time soon sill u be offering it?
B004I744AS|5.0|I love this app. It's easy to use. I also love the home page with the word games. I can play and learn the definition of the word if I don't know it. I'm considering paying for the ad-free upgrade.
1451695195|5.0|Very good reading . Recomended to friends. Very well Writen. Finished reading in one day, Normaly takes 2 or 3 days to finish a book that size.
B00001QEE5|5.0|My granddaughter, who has autism, was visiting during her spring break....10 days.  Her teacher mentioned, she always requested Peter Pan when she watched a DVD.  I ordered it immediately and received it several days later.  She was able to enjoy it every morning, actually asked for it.  We also used it when she was somewhat agitated.....a wonderful pacifer.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|It's a fun game with great graphics and a really inventive story and setting.  Steampunk enthusiasts will love it. It takes a few hours to solve, longer without hints. Great game for the price!
B00005JMJG|4.0|A very original idea for a movie, but one anybody with heartbreak has thought of before. Excellent perspective that can make you appreciate all the crappy moments you suffered through in relationships.
B0018LMKIK|4.0|Unmistakably Creedence but:<br />1-Don't expect the long versions of Susie Q or Heard It Through The Grapevine on this CD.<br />2-Tracks are not in same chronology as the albums from which they came.<br />3-The edges of some of the liner notes are faded out and illegible.<br />4-'Someday Never Comes' was not included.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Dan Brown has extensively researched the content of this book. He has shed light on misguided meanings and confusion towards many aspects of religion, masons and hunanity.
B008OW1S3O|4.0|Alt-J is great. Buy the album, unless your music taste is crud. Breezeblocks, Fitzpleasure, Taro and Bloodflood are my personal faves.
B00AFROVQC|1.0|Unless you are truly bored or rich. I've read four of these now and they aren't getting better.  The four books finished so far would comprise a single book by a real author.  You can read other reviews about the horde of shortcomings.  I'll add one.  This author has apparently done no research on war.  100 men is an army, 1000 men is an army, 100,000 men is an army.  Less than 10 boys defeat 100 of the toughest warriors around.
B00A4FOWYQ|4.0|Not as strong as The Con, imo, but I like the new sound. Tegan and Sara be some talented ladies.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I chose this rating because things began to tie up and come to a conclusion.  I started getting accustomed to the F word which kind of shocked me in the beginning.  I would recommend this to mature audiences who would not be shocked by the language and the rough scenes!  The story is good, and I had become fond of the main characters by this time! I am a great-grandmother of 83 so not too much shocks me anymore!
B0090X4GJE|5.0|Great album. I've listened to is so many times. Much better than Lights, and worth the wait. Ellie deserves more love.
0312330863|5.0|Wonderful book. Shipped quickly and in very good condition. A great read for anyone who loves animals and this is the second time I have read the book, it is indeed fantastic.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Decided I would read book before watching movie. This author captures your attention and then your heart. Read entire book in a few hours. GREAT book!
B004TI5N38|4.0|Very good book. I hated (how can I say this with out ruining the ending) the ending. But still a very good book. Good story. Easy to keep up with if you are a night to night reader. But hard to put down every night - have to admit, I lost a little sleep wanting to know what was going to happen next.<br />Thanks David
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is a great series that I enjoy watching.  Good, old fashioned interesting story lines.  I would recommend it for anyone.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Please see above subject line, and we were using a brand new system and HDMI connection. Please address this, Amazon.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|Fun game but did not finish it yet like the star wars birds better then some of the other birds
0525478817|1.0|Everyone said this was amazing, and it wasn't. It was boring and dragged on. Unoriginal. Not realistic at all. Thanks.
1409136612|5.0|I LOVE MAEVE BINCHY!  This book did not disappoint, just too short!  A good story and well written, as usual
B00947N6D8|5.0|excellent movie, loved the characters spins and twist. My son and I watched it on repeat for awhile, it was great!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I really loved the game and it was well worth the money spent. No issues with any game functionality, very easy to use and challenging but not to the point of frustrating
B000KIPT30|5.0|I had never even heard of an Amp for a headphone until recently, when I was inquiring about  volume controls on a headphone. An Amazon customer sent me an e-mail and gave me the information about the amp. I checked it out, it seemed like a good price, so I ordered it and I am glad I did. I wake up early, &#34;around 3am&#34; almost every day, and I love to listen to music. So now I can listen without disturbing  the household. The sound is great and you can adjust the volume so easy. You only have to turn the volume control just as little and it's perfect. It won't blow out your ears. And there's no cracking or popping sounds coming through. I am totally happy with this item and I would highly recommend it, even if you don't have the need for quiet in the home in the early hours. To the person who steered me to this item, I give a great big thank you.
B000LTAY1U|3.0|I love the look of the watch and the face alone is enough to buy it. Mine ran a bit slow, losing about a minute a week but this is no big issue. My biggest qualm is the strap. It has an annoying habit of popping off and losing the pins. I noticed that any diagonal tug on the  band near the pins will pop them out, even after my second new set of pins. This happened with simple tasks like lifting a box, reaching into a small space or playing pickup basketball. Luckily i noticed right away and retrieved the watch but on the fifth time I lost the watch!! Bummer, I can't decide if it's worth buying a new one.
B003SNKBXW|3.0|Wow. Kept me thinking and guessing until the final page.  If you're a fan of Perez-Reverte read this.  5 stars for the book.<br /><br />1 star for the kindle edition. Punctuation and misspellings everywhere. OCR failed here and it wasn't proof read rain= ram and similar throughout the book. Sloppy.
B0064O927I|4.0|Swatch always it´s okay<br /><br />My son love it, i purchase it for him, and it´s 100% fits for him<br /><br />He use dayli
B0064MGU98|5.0|There hasn't been a great legal show in a while, so I was thrilled to finally catch this one. And Juliana Marguiles shines!
B005H9B44A|3.0|I love superhero movies but I guess I was expecting more from this one (in term of plot).  I didn't believe the story like I did when I watched Iron Man, Superman, or Batman.  And they could have least picked a cute guy to play Thor (full disclosure - I am a female).  I get that he doesn't eat any carbs - good for him, and likes to take his shirt off, but I guess he looks too much like a mountain man for my taste.
B0053TMP24|5.0|This was the best book ever since the  travel team. I love this book I'm going to read Mark  of Athena and more by this author
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I liked this series from the very first episode...had to keep from watching the whole first season straight through...great acting...good scripts...nice production values...that's hard to beat on tv these days...I'm looking forward to the next two seasons, then hopefully I can pick it up in-season on CBS (if it doesn't get canceled)...
B00190N4E4|4.0|I saw this movie years ago...nice to watch it again with so much happening in that part of the world. This is one of those timeless tales that should motivate us to find better solutions to differences that too often lead to violent confrontations.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I have read all of John Grisham's books and find they are the best. Once I start them I have to read it through the end. The fact that Grisham had a lot of experience being a lawyer, I also trust every story he writes. And his styly is unique, you just want to read it to the end in one shot!<br />I am a big fan if not the biggest.<br />Thanks for all the entertainment you provide every time one of your novels comes out.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Looking forward to the other 2 books and hopefully a movie although I'm sure a movie will do the books no justice.
1400069807|5.0|I'm very interested in eating well and avoiding the &#34;bad&#34; stuff. Moss' book is full of factual information about the lengths the food industry goes to fool us consumers.<br />I highly recommend this book to everyone concerned about the food products we<br />purchase every day, including those that are purported to be healthy choices.
B003DCPGNS|5.0|If you enjoy Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn, then you will love this classic. It is so funny with nonstop laughter!
B006VFLIYK|4.0|A little far fetched. Characters are interesting and the story moves along. But this is a good read. Easy to put down.
B0002XMKYE|5.0|Great movie. Just Like I remembered it to be. Every WWII movie buff should have this one in their collection.
B00CATSONE|4.0|This book was not only interesting but informative and fun as well.  I had heard from other sources that Edison was a difficult person to deal with and in fact employed shady characters to enforce his world view.  That Tesla could survive his encounters with the powerful forces of his day and continue to create shows just how brilliant he really was.<br /><br />Thanks Sean for a well written book.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|The flawed system of foster care and the children trapped , sometimes in an unending trap like; powerful possibilities with honest adults coming to the rescue of those unable to defend themselves, mixed with plenty of twists and action.  Conrad

0439023491|5.0|I hate reading, but I read this book in about 4 days.  This is definitely the best book of the series in my opinion(although all three of them are great books)
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This is a fun game to play. I would recomend it to my friends. I also plan to pay it everyday.
0439023521|5.0|I really like all the books in the series and this is a great book that sets up the rest of the series.
B000000WFZ|3.0|Not one of those CD's that I really liked after hearing it for the first time.  It's okay, but having heard it if I were considering to buy it for the first time I wouldn't.
0439023513|4.0|I would say this was probably my least favorite of the 3, but it is still a good book.  I read it in about 5 days which is extremely fast for me.
B00B9366VO|5.0|If you like computer-generated, computer-enhanced, manufactured, corporate, talentless pop stars who don't write their own songs or have their own band then this might not be for you.<br /><br />If you like real music played by humans, rock and roll, history, talent, and good stories, put this flick on, kick back, and enjoy.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Another wonderful story starring wizards, hobbits, elves and characters seen in Lord of the Rings; enjoyable movie for children in 3rd grade up and adults who want to return to the land of fantasyl
0553382152|5.0|This book is as much about how to live life on this earth  as it is about the dying experience. It has taught me about living as a spiritual being. I would recommend it to anyone who is dealing with the death of a loved one and wondering what life holds for those left behind.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book changed the way I thought about parenting and unconditional love. Well, maybe it didn't change it, exactly, but it made me think about it differently and pushed my ideals and values in directions I had never considered.<br /><br />Great protagonist voice. Really likeable guy -- but imperfect and contradictory. Nice mix of genres as well, flipping back and forth from 1st person narrative to court transcript.  It was done in a way that supported the story and character development and wasn't distracting or gimmicky.<br /><br />Read it for sure... but don't expect a straight forward legal drama.
B000MCIBB6|5.0|I love The Doors and am so glad you have so much classic rock music. Great cd sounds awesome.Will purchase more music in the future. CDs are getting harder to find in stores. THANK YOU AMAZON!!!!!!! You are fab.

B009IEXKXI|5.0|An excellent book with a great plot and characters.  It kept me wanting to find out what was going to happen next and care what happened to the main character.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|I've seen some of Tarantino's previous movies, and found them just ok. But I LOVE this movie. It swings wildly from drama/comedy/action, and Tarantino makes it work, and work well. It's extremely well cast, and I was sorry to see it end. Yes, the violence is extreme at times, which I'm usually not a fan of, but I was so engrossed in the story itself that I didn't care. A must watch!
B004YM6JP0|5.0|I love is series, and having it on Blu-ray is great. No commercials. I also really like having some of special features that you don't get to see on tv.
B005KMX866|5.0|Chris Isaak has a great sound. These CD's brought back memories from the 50's. If this is the music you like you need to purchase this CD.
B00B2DSK06|5.0|I think we have had to watch this like 10 times since we got it.  Th kids love it.  Plus I love the amazon movie and tv buys..  My kids area always destroying our DVDs and when you buy on amazon you can just stream it whenever you want.
B004XZR63M|5.0|I wish I had read this when I was younger. Very simple ideas and would be a lot easier to action if I hadn't already entered a bad debt situation. Read it before you buy anything!!
B007REV4YI|5.0|this was another great Bond movie.  this was my kid's first Bond movie and they are now hooked.  very interesting ending.
B004EWEX9Y|2.0|not mirroring in iphone 4s, in full screen works ok. the description don't say's nothing of that,  everything else was good.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think it is good as I do really well and I have completed 123 missions I think I do really well and I recommend this
B0030IIZ56|5.0|Love the movie and my 2 year old is obsessed with Buzz Lightyear.  Too bad, cuz I'm more of a Sheriff Woody fan myself.  The movie is super cute and totally appropriate for kids

B0030IIYWA|5.0|We have seen the movie a hundred times - just needed to own it for my son.  He loves Buzz (and &#34;likes&#34; Woody).  I can't say enough about the funny lines, entertaining story and SAFE entertainment to plop the kiddo in front of when I'm stuck in the middle of dinner prep!  No worries about what he's picking up here!

B004XNGKBS|4.0|The app allows you to write freehand on the screen or to type using a built-in keyboard.<br /><br />Freehand strokes are saved as images, an image being created after a certain pause in detected action. One can extend this pause infinitely if one uses the \\"drag gesture\\" as then the app waits for one to indicate one is done.<br /><br />Pros: Easy to use once one gets into the designer's mode of thinking. Great range of options to change look of desktop, paper, ink etc.<br /><br />Cons: Finished images can become too small to make out when they render. This is more of a problem for large images as the rendered images are all the same size in a note. For example; stretching the image of my signature, which will not fit on the Kindle screen when written using a finger, by means of the drag gesture will result in my signature being tiny. Write a whole sentence this way and you are in for a disappointment. Writing one word at a time means waiting for the pause time to elapse which can be frustrating or learning to find the \\"accept\\" icon quickly to preempt it, which is fatiguing.<br /><br />The alternative is to use the keyboard, which I find easiest in landscape orientation on my Kindle, but then one cannot see much of the finished document and I find the keyboard will not retract unless I reorient to portrait mode.<br /><br />[EDIT 10/18/13 In fact the keyboard on this used to be a terrible experience, with whatever I typed taking so long to appear it was ridiculous. I type with all the speed of a snail with gout and the accuracy of a blindfolded man wearing boxing gloves, and I could finish a line only to see it slowly catching up full of typos (all my fault) which meant retyping, but I'd have to wait until the darn text was finished displaying.<br /><br />This has all been very nicely fixed in the latest update, honestly the first update for this product that has done something I saw needed fixing (past \\"fixes\\" have changed UI behavior so that I had to re-learn how to use the product, which I found annoying).<br /><br />The new update seems to have the key/text response up to expected performance levels compared to other apps on the Kindle. [/EDIT]<br /><br />[EDIT 6/26/14] The slow keyboard effect is still alive and well, but only on documents already inside \\"notebooks\\" (folders). If you create and edit them at the top level of the Handrite internal document tree things work well. [/EDIT]<br /><br />That said, I've found a good deal of use for the app since I don't have an alternative note-taking tool on my kindle (haven't found one that is better than Handrite) and sometimes the Kindle is all I have to hand when I need to make a note.<br /><br />Four stars.use the product, which I found annoying).<br /><br />The new update seems to have the key/text response up to expected performance levels compared to other apps on the Kindle.

B00CHI5F5S|5.0|I'm a really big Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone fan and I have to say it was a great movie!
B0064NTZQ2|5.0|If you like Michael Mann movies (Heat, The Insider) you'll love this. Incredibly good from start to finish. Soundtrack totally fits and the dialogue is less-equals-more.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|This is a good app and I have shared it with all my family.  It does a great job telling you the song you are listening to on the 1st try.  It also allows you to look up the youtube videos, lyrics, and other information about the song.  You can purchase the tagged song as well but I have not done that within this program yet so I am not sure how it works.
B004HO6HWA|2.0|I try to go into movies like this without bringing reality with me but c'mon man, this was ridiculous! Assassins climbing skyscrapers in daytime dressed in black? Cars driven inside buses and exploding? Ben Foster as a hired gun? That hipster can barely wrap a scarf around his neck, nevermind pick up an automatic weapon. They should have made it a comedy and put Michael Cera as the apprentice.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|This is 1 of the best parts of my printer!  This app allows me to print for anywhere!  I LOVE IT!<br /><br />It is not difficult or hard to setup and use.  It is very user friendly!
B003Y5H54W|2.0|The target audience is the Twilight fans and if I'd known that, I would have passed on this silly mess of teen angst mixed with werewolf (yawn) violence. The village dance is just horrific, considering they are in the middle ages but the teens are freak dancing (so THAT'S where they got it from). The dialogue was indeed meant for teens. So sad that Gary Oldman got sucked into this.
B0074VA2T2|2.0|I thought this would be a blast for my daughter.  We LOVE the book and the app had to be cute and fun.<br /><br />This app does not move at a pace that is fun and exciting for younger children.  She gets frustrated and the slowness of app movements.<br /><br />To clarify:  It is not the software of the app it is the actual select settings within the app that you cannot speed up and become tedious after the first page.
B0051CSI0G|5.0|A well written and and directed zombie/vampire movie in a post-apocalyptic world. The movie never saw the light of day because there were no big names in it. Don't let that fool you. These actors were excellent, as was the cinematography and story.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The story line with its proverbial twists is new and different for Grisham.  Not a lot if courtroom drama, but interesting never the less.
B007C3TVNA|3.0|The whole cast is Oscar worthy. My problem was the flashback style. Directors, please stop this. It's not smart or insightful or unique. It's overdone and distracting. The ending is disappointing because it's too far from logic but overall, good film.
B009RH9HDS|5.0|The fit is perfect, as is the color (I got the orange). The swivel works great and is very easy to use. It stays in place when you stand it up landscape or portrait. It also sits on your lap well due to the soft inside material which grabs and holds fabric. The handstrap works well and gives you stability when moving around, which I always end up doing while I'm trying to read. All in all, I'm very pleased and would buy it again in a heartbeat.
B003Q6D1YW|2.0|There are a few hipsters in a marketing department somewhere smoking clove cigarettes and drinking Pabst, chuckling over how they fooled people into thinking this would be an interesting movie. Its not a movie or documentary. Muckumentary is even too good of a title. Its just a few skinny losers spending too much time on Facebook and not enough time enjoying life. Who produces this garbage? There are so many better films and ideas out there. I swear all you need to be a movie exec is a pulse, a good suit, and the ability to lie very well.
B00APJLY0Q|4.0|Good movie for kids and adults. Kind of reminds me of Dark Shadows for kids. Fun for the whole family
B004UA8D2S|2.0|Excellent cinematography but lousy story and dialogue. If this is a true story, they (writers Wight and Garvin) truly destroyed it.
B005ZMUXDC|4.0|My daughter loves this movie. I have it on my kindle downloaded so we can watch it on the go.
B004EPYZT4|2.0|What a shame this film is. The effects are neat but that's all it has going for it. Remember the original and how good the acting was (yes, even Arnold)? Grace Jones, James Earl Jones, Mako Iwamatsu-these are what made the original Conan so good, not effects. Nobody stands out in this re-make. McGowan is by far the worst of them all. Weak and bony, she is indeed no villain. She can barely pick up a sword in one scene. Give that girl a sandwich!
B00AU15HPC|5.0|I purchased these for a friend.  She just loved hers and was going to give the other 2 away to family members.  I was very pleased with the packing and the timelyness of receiving the CDs.
B0034G4OVS|2.0|Anyone that has been in the military will scream at the TV the second they see the chair lift! In basic training, the ropes course is simple and even if you aren't Army, it won't take long to learn it. Just loop one leg over and the other on top. Hang upside down and pull yourself along. This movie would have been over in 10 minutes if they quit whining and did this.
B001DTPZNY|1.0|It makes me sad to think that Harrison reviewed this script and was OK with it. Then again, most of the stuff I loathed was CGI and he had no idea it would come off so bad.
B004EPZ07K|2.0|Predictable, thick with cheese (Swiss), and just plain silly. Clearly aimed at teens (young teens) and even they would be disappointed.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This is a great adaptation.  The acting is great and is the directing.  This story is the classic \\" Pride and Prejudice\\" story as told by Jane Austen once you've cut out all the exasperating and inconsequential details.  This movie gets right to the point without diminishing the theme or plot of the story.<br />It is the classic tale of Elizabeth.  Elizabeth is smart, but loyal to her sisters.  Jane, Elizabeth's older sister, falls in love with Mr. Bingley.  Mr. Darcy is Mr. Bingley's best friend and insults Elizabeth, but is unaware that she can hear him.  Elizabeth is enchanted by Mr. Wickham.  Elizabeth meets Mr. Darcy and through a series of misunderstandings on both their parts they end up misjudging both each and others.  Elizabeth finds out that Mr. Darcy encouraged Mr. Bingley not marry Jane because he believed that Jane didn't love Mr. Bingley.  Mr. Darcy tells Elizabeth that he loves despite himself.  Elizabeth clears up the misunderstanding that Mr. Darcy had about Jane and she also tells him off.  Mr. Darcy writes a letter and explains the truth about Mr. Wickham and what a leech he is.  Elizabeth's feelings towards Mr. Darcy start to change.  Then Elzabeth's youngest and most foolish sister, Lydia runs off with Mr. Wickham.  Mr. Darcy uses his vast fortune to make certain that Mr. Wickham marries Lydia.  He also gets Mr. Bingley and Jane back together.  Elizabeth finds out about both of these things.  Both she and Mr. Darcy start telling each the truth about how they really feel about one another.  It is not hard to deduce what happens next.<br />All in all this is a great romantic film.  Jane Austen, tends to beat around the bush too much.  This film takes out all unneccessary running around and it gets right to the point without changing the plot.  However if films where the primary focus is romance are not your thing I would advise against you watching this film.  If a person loves a good romance then I would highly recommend this film.
B004UXUX4Q|3.0|I'm a bit fatigued with movies dealing with the elite and their first world problems. The protagonist' kids are spoiled brats and the dying wife was a bored harlot. This is all happening under a beautiful Hawaiian sky, under the roof' of very large homes, where everything costs far more than what the average American can afford. Yeah, I was a little bored but it was OK.
B0097C8XL0|5.0|This app is similar to Temple run, but this app is so much more fun. You have to guide the penguin through the different obstacles with out crashing, It is so much fun. You can collect fish to buy different penguins and upgrades to help you. My family and I play this app everyday to see who will get the best score. If you don't get this app you are missing out.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|This title is really moving.  I don't know of another way to describe it.  I was going to give it 4 stars but [SPOILER?] the ending was so beautiful I had to give it 5.  It's a work of art as well as a celebration and enjoyment of art.  The music is enchanting.  I really like classical music but don't listen to it very often.  Intouchables (poor translation, not reflective of the excellent subtitles) weaves classical music into the storyline perfectly.  Very immersive and engaging.
B0086700CM|4.0|I like the running and jumping and I would reccomend this game. It takes skills and attention to play. My grandaughter loves it.
B0095P29EG|5.0|My son and I watch this movie over and over again! My daughter actually likes this one too. We are big fans of the super hero movies. this one is one of the best!
B00BSBU4EC|3.0|Visually this was pretty stunning, and it wanted to be a good movie. Ultimately there was no conflict, no real threat, and the villain really had very weak motivation, so it was difficult to stay engaged. On a more subjective note I didnt' feel that the character designs were very cohesive, which was a little off-putting. Sandman and Toothfairy designs were great, just didnt' feel like they were part of the same world as the rest of the crew.
B004J64QSI|5.0|I've seen the show at least four times. This is the best sung production.  See the movie for production values.  Watch this DVD for it's musical values.
B0090SI4LU|4.0|I am not a huge Twi-hard fan. I do like the movies (even though i thought Eclipse was WEAK), i read Twilight and thought some of it was boring and tried to read the rest of the Twilight books but they just didn't hold any interest for me. Out of all of the Twilight movies the last two movies (Breaking Dawn part 1 and 2) of the series are my favorites.<br /><br />Now onto Stephanie Meyers's The Host. I didn't read the book, i thought about reading it before i saw the movie, but i just said forget it and decided to watch the movie instead. I don't know how the book is, but personally i really don't care because i REALLY LIKED this movie. I thought it was such an interesting story, and no offense to the Twilight fans, but i think this book/movie is a little bit more realistic (alien's taking over our bodies) rather than believing vampires and werewolves are real.<br /><br />If there was an alien race like this, than i would hope that we as humans can still fight them, even when they have taken over our bodies. And that's what Melanie does, even though Wanderer/Wanda has taken over Melanie's body, she is still in there.<br /><br />If you really liked the book, then there might be a chance you might not like the movie. When i was a teenager i loved the book \\"Blood and Chocolate\\" and when they finally made a movie out of it, i was excited. I watched the movie and absolutely HATED IT. I was angry that they didn't even TRY to get as close to the book as possible.<br /><br />Whenever they transfer a book into a movie, they never get as good as the book, they try (most of the time), but they never quite get it perfect. That's because books have a lot more detail than movies, and if you wanted everything perfect like the book, the movie would probably be 3 or 4 hours long. This movie was two hours and ten minutes.<br /><br />I would love it if Stephanie Meyers did a sequal to this book so they could make a sequal to the movie, because i feel that there can definitely be more to this story. If you are an alien/sci-fi fan then you might like it. I would say watch it first and then decide. Don't look at the three stars or what other people are ragging about with this movie, make up your own mind on it.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Very fun and awesome. Love that you have to do it under a certain amount of time. Make&acute;s you want to be better than the previous score.

1442337966|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed listening to this audio on &#34;The Power&#34; which is about the power of love in our personal lives.  The creative process of three steps of imagining, feeling and receiving that which we love is a great tool to positive, joyfilled living.  Listening to our heart's desires and our true feelings are keys to living a life full of enthusiasm and joy.
0812992792|4.0|This came pretty quickly and the book definitely provided insight into North Korea. Even though this is if fiction there are enough real live day to day insight into this very secret and sad society. Well written.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|The book language is alive and entertaining. There are too many technical scenes and details. Nora Roberts also uses a lot of similar scenes in her books to spice them up, but at least her books have actions and a plot. Here we don't see too much of a plot. 500 pages to reveal what did happen to Christian in his childhood, and you have to go to the next book to find it out. It's a very nice marketing trick to sell more volumes. But it works: I'm going to buy and read the next one.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|I read this before I saw the movie.  It is OK, but rather &#34;fluffy&#34; reading.  Sometimes you are in the mood for something lighter and this is it.  I thought the former husband received too much attention in the end when he was trying to kill her.  It became &#34;too much.&#34;
B00479SVBU|5.0|I am absolutely in love with this thing. Really wanted to be able to play music on my phone in my car without having to buy a whole new CD deck with an AUX port. However, have had some bad experience with cheap fm transmitters in the past. Regardless, decided to give this a try based on the positive word of mouth. So far, this thing is fantastic. I have had zero issue with interference anywhere in the city and overall the sound quality is very good. I initially bought this to hook my phone too, but have found that I appreciate (and use more often) the ability to play from an SD card or USB stick. If I had to pick one gripe, it would be that it is sometimes difficult to navigate using the buttons on the device itself. You will most likely just have to use the remote for most control features. Obviously you can only display so much with such a small unit. That being said, it isn't enough to knock off a star. Kuddos to Soundfly for making a solid product. Would definitely recommend.
B005LAIHRC|1.0|Writing a review for this movie poses an interesting challenge---I normally would not even think too much about a movie like this but oh man---Tom Cruise. Tom freakin'Cruise.<br /><br />(Short version of review: just watch the Tom Cruise parts and skip EVERYTHING else)<br /><br />Long version:<br />1. Rock of Ages--the \\"Film\\"<br />2. The Awfulness of the 2 Leads<br />3. Tom Cruise Pours Some Sugar on Me<br />4. Everyone Else in 5 bullet points<br />5. Final Thoughts<br /><br />1. Rock of Ages--the \\"Film\\"<br />As a film, Rock of Ages is pretty terrible. With the exception of Stacee Jaxx, the other characters are flat, one-dimensional and while a few of them are given a moment (Baldwin, Brand, Blige--even Giamatti), these are more cardboard cutouts than fully realized characters.<br /><br />Which is absolutely fine in a musical sometimes. The fun of musicals is watching people perform and bring a dimension to their characters through the music that may not necessarily be in the script. However, don't take that to mean that actors can slack off in musicals---because to really be able to convey emotion, that actor better be able not only to sing, but also act out emotions through face and body---without looking ridiculous. Even in a movie with a crappy script, truly talented actors can bring dimension to it through charisma and acting ability. Think Singin in the Rain---3 stock characters (lover/clown/ingenue) and a whole world of emotion was expressed in that movie, along with real critical commentary on Hollywood. No wonder everyone loves it.<br /><br />This movie did not succeed in that regard. At all. Terrible pacing, inconsistent character moments thrown in more for shock value than coherency, and poor story structure.<br /><br />2. The Awfulness of the 2 Leads<br />OK--I hated these 2 characters. I hated the actors' performances. And I actually saw the musical and really loved them in the musical! I think part of it is that the script takes a lot of the characterdevelopment out by favoring whitewashing original plot elements. If you have seen the musical, you know what I mean. Specifically, Sherrie's \\"indiscretion\\" and how that really was the driving force for Drew's decisions and viewers understand why he diverged from his rock path. In the movie, he's just a mistrustful jerk.<br /><br />Hough and Boneta can't elevate these characters either---they are just so...bland. Their voices are not special in anyway (like 2 chirping chipmunks is how I kept thinking about it). They have 0 chemistry. And I hate to say---there is nothing attractive physically about either of them. So everytime they are onscreen, I just zoned out and felt no investment in their storyline which is supposed to be the heart of the story.<br /><br />Also, Hough is a good dancer---but she does no dancing in this movie! She just hangs off a stripper pole for a few seconds.<br /><br />And was it kind of sad that when Constantine Maroulis gets to belt a couple of lines that I wished that he was cast as Drew instead? Say what you will about him, he truly was fantastic as Drew.<br /><br />The problem with Boneta is that he looks like he belongs in a boyband---so when he puts on the duds, he is supposed to look really out of character. It's a problem when I thought he looked right at home in pastels and shoulderpads.<br /><br />3. Tom Cruise Pours Some Sugar On Me<br />OK---I am no innocent---I am sure Cruise had a huge amount of influence on the Stacee Jaxx character. And make no mistake---this is NOT the same Stacee Jaxx from the musical. In the musical, Stacee is absolutely the villain. He does awful things--shockingly awful things.<br /><br />But in this instance of character adaptation, it WORKS. Unlike our 2 boring and bland leads, Stacee Jaxx is a real character with real motivations and struggles---and Cruise does SO much with the character and looks like he's having a great time.<br /><br />His duet with Malin Akerman was probably the sexiest thing I have ever seen Tom Cruise do. I loved the two of them together. Despite all his years of film, I have never once thought of Tom Cruise as sexy. Ever. But wow---the 2 of them singing I Want to Know What Love Is on top of that pool table was pretty off the charts. It made me forget Tom Cruise the nut---and think ooh..maybe I can throw a bra at my screen and he'll catch it!<br /><br />But the centerpiece of the movie is without a doubt Pour Some Sugar on Me. I could not believe how AWESOME that scene was. Tom Cruise is always at his best when he goes balls-to-the-wall against his Tom Cruise bag of tricks and he is great in these smaller roles. Can he sing? Sure--he can carry a tune. But his physicality is on full display here. The body has aged (he sure is standing up straight) but he looks good. His age is perfect for the character. And his charisma leaps off the screen and you really do believe Stacee is an aging rock legend who once was great, got lost along the way and yearns to be great again. Urgh...now I have to find another bra to throw at my screen.<br /><br />The Tom Cruise scenes all seem like they come from a completely different movie. Look how well the shots are composed, the lighting, the editing. All the effort seems to have gone into making these scenes work and even though they amount to just about 20% of the movie, it is without a doubt the only time this movie ever comes alive.<br /><br />See the movie---but come back for Tom Cruise. Definitely one of my favorite performances from him. Ever.<br /><br />4. Everyone Else in 5 Bullet Points<br />- Mary J. Blige is a LEGEND. And I have a real problem with modern musicals needing a sassy street-smart black woman (Hairspray, Chicago, Dreamgirls, etc). Mary is too good for this and is utterly wasted.<br />- Alec Baldwin and Russell Brand were cute. Nothing memorable but they seemed like they were having a great time and that shows.<br />- Bryan Cranston. Oh Walter White. Are mortgages and tuitions that expensive that you have to do this? Is meth no longer the path to financial freedom? You are SO MUCH BETTER THAN THIS!<br />- Paul Giammatti needs to work more too. Just not in a musical. Ever again. But he's great as the slimeball agent<br />- Catherine Zeta Jones tried very hard but her character is so unlikeable and the dance sequences are staged so badly that it just doesn't help her cause<br /><br />5. Final Thoughts<br />This is a pretty terrible movie that may annoy you. But get it on blu ray so you can just skip to the Tom Cruise chapters. Oh--and this movie is not for kiddies---there is no nudity but a lot of extremely sexually suggestive material. I'm no prude but even I was a little surprised this was a PG-13.

B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Having grown up in Ireland in the 40's and 50's, I found this very painful reading.  There was no understanding or reaching out to &#34;fallen&#34; women.  The Irish government handed over control of the schools and much else to the Catholic church.  With the world coming out of World War II, there was a lot of poverty, and it was a hard life for farmers trying to eke out a living from their small properties.<br /><br />However, the priests led a very different life  -  even in a small village, the parish priest had a big house and the curate had his own house  -  each with a housekeeper to take care of him.  I remember the Parish Priest coming down from the alter during Sunday mass, hitting on the shoulder the farmers who used to gather at the back of the church, and telling them to get up to the front of the church.  These were men who had gotten up very early on a cold wet Irish morning  - milked cows, taken care of livestock, and then walked/cycled/rode a horse (or donkey) and cart into the village, fasting if going to communion.<br /><br />It grieves me that nobody stood up to these tyrants.  They were treated like little gods.  Every mother wanted her son to be a priest.  And why not  -  a guaranteed cushy life once you got into Maynooth.  Ireland then had an abundance of priests to send to the far corners of the world.<br /><br />And so we have the ruined lives of the children and the women who were committed to the homes described in this book.  Shameful, shameful, shameful.

B00555X8OA|5.0|Relative to many of these academic-type books written for normal people, this book is not only very readable but it also maintains a feeling of being smart and not dumbed down like many others in this genre.<br /><br />The book did take me awhile to read, though after every chapter I found myself thinking, \\"Wow, this is really insightful and interesting stuff\\".  I think it took so long because I knew that heading into each chapter, I needed to be alert and focused in order to get the most out of the book, so I didn't just whiz through it.  Also, the book was pleasantly interactive in the sense that many of the questions and experiments described throughout were actually presented to the reader to test with themselves as subject.  It was engaging, entertaining, and powerful.<br /><br />I recommend this book for anyone interested in seeing themselves and the world a little differently.  As the author points out, though we often feel like we know our motivations for our actions and that we generally make rational decisions, the truth of the matter isn't always what our minds so quickly want to believe.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|It's a fun game just a little too quick to finish.  Worth a couple dollars<br />I will probably play it again
1400069289|4.0|This is a fun and easy read.  While it has scientific research throughout with mentions of plenty of neuroscience, it is apparent that the writer is in fact a journalist and not a scientist by trade.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but the material somehow feels less authoritative both in tone and in the manner in which the material is presented.  The anecdotes used to tell the story of habits, be it Starbucks, Michael Phelps, Febreeze, etc. are all interesting and enjoyable to read about, but this approach is overall not as convincing as a book more grounded in theory rather than examples.<br /><br />The downside is I finished the book feeling like I had been given a whole bunch of interesting ideas relating to habits (and what motivates humans to do anything), but it was just a bunch of ideas held together by pretty loose and simplistic theory.  The basic idea, shown through simple diagrams throughout the book, is that there is a cue, a routine, and a reward.  Identify these things and just about any habit can be changed, formed, etc.  While I don't necessarily disagree with this, the book's theoretical grounding seems weak.<br /><br />I'm being critical because in the end, while I love the author's general stance on habits and their malleability, and I really like the writing style and stories, I ultimately wanted a more convincing underlying theory I could hang my hat on.  Overall, it's a fun book to read.  The Kindle price of $16+ was a little steep relative to other books out there, but I still enjoyed it and recommend it.
B009TO99TG|5.0|This is a fantastic value. Although I prefer Coldplay's earlier work, it is interesting to listen to the differences in the band's music.
B004GJXQ20|5.0|I haven't read fantasy fiction for over 25 years - perfect choice to come back into the fold with! Meanwhile I'm learning so much old English... Brilliant.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|LOVE THIS GAME! ITS COLORFUL AND ENJOYABLE. WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE THAT WANTS A CHALLENGE. IVE DOWNLOADED SIMILAR GAMES BUT LIKE THIS ONE THE BEST
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|The book was awesome. It was definitively worth 8 dollars. It's such a good book I<br />'M buying another one .
B000005HDT|5.0|Glad to get this in CD format especially since Donald Byrd has passed. This recording is a favorite of mine and I am thoroughly enjoying it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I like this game people that like horses I highly recommend this game that can't actually get a horse I like everything about it

B0063GORYU|5.0|Whether it's the pc, the tablet, or the phone...this a really great game when you need to kill time. I like that you can replay the hand.
B00BYOEZTI|5.0|They've done it again, brought a beloved book from my childhood to life in a brilliant way.  There may be some that are upset that he added to the story to stretch it out and make more money.  But if that was the only way he could get the studio to buy off on it, so be it.  Better to do that than not to make the move at all, and I think he did a fantastic job of it.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Worth every cent and more! Will enjoy this time after time. My grandson, age 7, and I are captivated by this series.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|Got the info from my brother who is a nut about this stuff and called me on it immediately. Jumped on it to open my programs and have been using it ever since. Great job
B0064MGU98|5.0|My wife got me hooked on this one. Really enjoyed the first season. looking forward to the rest on Prime.
B006X5L6VS|2.0|didnt translate the sky as id hope tit would even with the additional down load was looking for an easier type to use just point and observe
B004GJYR7I|5.0|Great movie with Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn, tow of the greatest actors of all time. Fun story to watch unfold.
B0079HLDCQ|4.0|well worth the read ,as usual with this author, he has the ability ,to keep the reader<br />s interest througt the book<br />i would recommend this to all readers
B0074MZSWW|4.0|We love this album and bought it to replace a lost album. Arrived in time for us to listen to during our road trip to see the Alabama shakes live in Denver. Still the same great album but this time in a soft case. Not a terrible thing but I like my hard cases
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love it, I like to study the bible and this seems to be a good study bible with a lot of extras to help do that.
B000GWE44U|1.0|Sup Sup ya'll? How is everyone doing this lovely Sunday??? Well earlier today I got really irritated watching the NBA playoffs *Bucks should be the Finals winners by the way!* so I decided to check Amazon for a good scary movie like... Scary Movie V... WHICH IS an all-time classic by the way.. and I stumbled across the \\"Shining\\".  The cover looked kinda cool but that's about it. I literally fell asleep within 5 minutes! How is this movie considered horrifying or scary? The only horrifying and scary thing is the hype behind this movie!  The only good thing about this movie was that it was free because amazon gave me free video credits!<br /><br />For good scary movies check out... Scary Movie, I know what you did last summer, Scream, and anything with Barbara Streisand.  Leave this \\"Shining\\" movie in the clearance bin!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Sparks has done it again!  Truly exciting and romantic page turner that will not let you down.  Keep them coming.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Very enjoyable read.  Compelling story, well told and begging for a sequel as it leaves the reader hanging for more.
1608871517|5.0|I agree with all of the positive reviews here. My favorite aspect however, is the special look into Michael's personality. I feel I know him more than ever. The more one knows about him, the more they love him.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|It help pass the time. I just wish we can trade cards with other players. Just be careful other players who are stronger in life points and have more cards then you at first. But when you give it time you care beat them easy.
B009X2CRMK|5.0|Another great Kate Morton book. I love the way she jumps between centuries, telling the stories that tie everything together!
B0087IT8FK|5.0|Amazing film, did not take long to arrive, packaged well, couldn't complain about anything!  Would definitely purchase again, this film is a definite must-see!
B007EECSFA|5.0|Loved this book - Great story beautifully written.  Couldn't put it down.  Highly recommend.  Incredible to learn about England pre WWII and the blitz.
B00AIUUXHC|1.0|as soon as I bought the great white shark, it froze my kindle and when it finally rebooted, it erased all my progress. fun game but, what's the point of playing a game for an extended amount of time if it's going to erase all my work?
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Get a kleenex.  Or two.  It was really a good read.  I liked it a lot even though I knew where it was going all along.
B008ROH07W|5.0|I bought this after watching a very well done youtube exposition in which Alison Balsom speaks to us, looking directly into the camera and is filmed thinking, imagining her playing, reacting to the orchestra, in conference as well as practicing alone and with ensemble. She has an extremely lovely smile which is on film again and again and her playing is sublime.  I would recommend to anyone who is interested that you watch the youtube specifically titled Sound of the Trumpet by Alison Balsom.  You will appreciate the person who is playing even more and your anticipation at the prospect of hearing entire pieces with her playing will be heightened.  A head up:  When I received the CD I was a bit disappointed that the first piece doesn't highlight her trumpet playing. It's a perfectly acceptable baroque piece but, were it not for the remainder of the CD, one would ask, &#34;Why is this CD titled, &#34;Sound of the Trumpet?&#34;  I don't know what they were thinking when they did that, first impressions and all.  But throughout the remainder of the CD her playing is predominant and wonderfully sublime.  Once she begins to play even the fidelity of the CD becomes top notch.  In spite of my disappointment with the first piece I'm giving &#34;Sound of the Trumpet&#34; and especially Alison Balsom five stars. I'd go a long way to hear her play in person.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|This is a good book, frustrating at times but overall I enjoyed it.  The idea behind the flower meanings and dictionary were very interesting.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|I learned so much from this book.  I could not put it down.  One of the best books I've ever read!
B009FZFONO|5.0|I like &#34;Walking Dead&#34; much better than &#34;Lost&#34;. The idea of human struggle to survive is very similar between the two shows, but the journey and plot are much better in “Walking Dead”. If you liked “Lost” you will love “Walking Dead”!
B0002VFXFE|5.0|I have used product frequently. A bit overpriced but is worth the cost. Go buy for n00bs or pros. Ohhh yeah
B008M87GJK|4.0|I like hearing news from all over the world.  BBC keeps me informed about the important things that are happening in Europe.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Always watch this show and wanted to watxh the first season. I wasn't disappointed at all. This a terrific show.
B00C4QVQV0|1.0|I love the series, but I have to give this product 1 star simply because the video streaming no longer works on my main computer. Ever since a recent update on Amazon's side, I get an error saying I don't have a compliant video cable or another unauthorized device plugged in and I haven't changed my computer setup in over a year! Now that I can't play it on my big screen TV even though I do have a HDMI cable, I feel like I wasted my money. Not only that but when the product did work, it was never in HD quality. So beware that you might not be able to play the series on desktop with an external monitor. Luckily, I had seen all the videos except the last one which I had to watch on my iMac. Still, without being able to play videos on my big screen system I doubt I will purchase anymore video streams through Amazon.
B005HI4LMS|5.0|I absolutely loved it. We had tears coming from our eyes as we watched it, it was so funny. I'm kind of a gore fan and this movie doesn't let you down. The gore/special effects were good and really make the story better. The story is hilarious anyway, but I have to say that having good gore vs. cheesy gore made this one a five star. Buy it, watch it, if you don't laugh? Something is wrong with you.
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|I love strategy games. This being said, I think Gameloft should adjust their strategy so as to make their money grubbing tendencies less transparent. It's like having a teen aged daughter, or something!
B0035G5IOE|5.0|This film is nothing short of amazing, but watching it in Blu-Ray was a new experience.  The details that you can see on these characters is amazing.  The bonus features and making of is especially enjoyable.
B00AJLHUA8|5.0|I'm all about giving current horror movies the benefit of the doubt because I think they typically get a bad rap.<br />I went to see this in theatres without even seeing a preview for it. Having no preconcieved options towards it, I can say that I actually enjoyed this movie.<br />I bought in on DVD I liked it so much. It flows quickly, throws a few scares in there, and even has a pretty decent ending. It's not all about over used gore or tacky tricks, and the overall story is actually pretty decent, and even chill worthy as you're watching it.<br />At the very least, go rent it and give it a shot
B006LSZECO|3.0|it's ok.  it rambled for a long time in the beginning.  neither nick or amy were very likeable.  you wanted to slap both of them and say wake up.  the ending was open ended.  did not live up to the hype.
B00A0MJA1I|5.0|Love it
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I noticed that choosing the targets was more realistic that what I read in some of the thrillers that I like. It was hard to put the book down.
B00A6J9SM6|5.0|This book is easy and fun to read. The first half of the book is easy to understand. The second is harder but also fun tread and simple in language. Overall a very good beginning in my trip to Dax and powerpivot.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I know the common complaint about this book is that it introduces too many new characters, and that it's more of a chore to read. Yes, there are a number of new characters, and the narrative does slow a bit. However, having since read A Dance with Dragons, I must say this 4th book was very necessary. The first 3 books focused mainly on the war in Westeros, but A Feast for Crows sets the stage for a world at war. I'm very excited about how the series will continue when Martin's 6th installment Winds of Winter is released. Can't wait... but I must.
B00881PTRC|5.0|Animations are amazing and funny. Sad part is see him go down when you lose. but the best hangman I have ever seen. I would recommend this game to anyone.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Loved this book<br /><br />Reading this book history came alive to me.  In school I learned history by rote memorizing dates, battles, names and events so that I could pass an exam, but I didn't actually understand anything. By reading winter of the world and the way the author tells the story through the eyes of American, German, Russian and British families; I<br />Understand history in a way I never had before.<br /><br />History came alive to me!  And I loved it!!!!
0789204096|5.0|Rockwell era uno splendido illustratore, per chi è un appassionato di disegno non gli può mancare un opera simile!!!peccato che il formato è piccolo si perdono i dettagli!!
0739365681|5.0|Love the continuing saga of Jack Reacher, alwasy fasinating read. Mysterious, exciting, keeps you on the edge of your feet. Can hardly stop listening it is so capitivating.<br />Delivery was also on time.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|As a family we are always trying to best one another.  Even the two and a half year old twins are able to play many games.  Excellent for the whole family.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|not that easy to follow. its a bit boring for kids although it does give a good sense of Lincoln's character.
B00C90T4QK|5.0|Michael Buble did not disappoint with this new album!  I really enjoyed it and if you liked his other releases, then this one will be a hit for you too!
B00028HBKM|4.0|Very moving and believable (the brutality is painful to watch).<br />The constant narration takes some getting used to, but it's<br />necessary since all the dialog is in the native language of<br />that period.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|This is a fun game with beautiful graphics. There are times that I feel some of the  puzzles go on and on. But all in all I do like the game.
B0019NB9A2|5.0|This one of my favorite films since seeing it as a kid originally on TV in b&W and pan&scan. Seeing it in color years later and finally in widescreen in a theatrical revival only increased my viewing pleasure. My DVD copy is good but showed a lot of grain when upscaled to 1080P, a problem I notice with older films. Newer or remastered/restored films don't have this problem or at least the graininess is not as noticable. I decided to purchase the Blu-ray version. Considering the age of the film, let me state I am very pleased to say the visual quality is a BIG improvement as some reviewers have noted here. There is some grain present but that's to be expected for an old film as another reviewer commented but it's not as obtrusive as before.<br /><br />I highly recommend this upgrade at such a good price. The many extras alone make this edition worth owning. Too bad a film historian couldn't have added a commentary. I never get tired of watching this film.
B000K7VHJQ|4.0|Gibson could've taken even more off of the beatings and the cross walk to give a few more minutes to the resurrection.  Good Friday was an incredible sacrifice for mankind, and it is good for us to understand the suffering that went on.  But, we don't want to forget the point was the gift he left us, a chance to have relationship through him with the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.  Also, when Jesus was in the Garden of Gethsemane there were Angels there with him, not Satan.  I would rather have seen it illustrated that God supports us and is there even in the midst of our sufferings. (Luke 22:42-43)
B004ZNARH4|5.0|This was a gift for my fiance who loves it...variations of never-before-heard songs, video's he's never seen, and nice memorabilia...awesome!~
B007FEZQF8|3.0|As a fan of TWD on AMC, I was excited to see how it all started.  The graphics and story did not disappoint however the price was a bit steep for the few pages received.
B003G4W49C|2.0|interesting premise, different. But too depressing to think we might use children this way. And come on.. sympathy for the bug race!! Don't care what their intentions were, NUKE EM for crying out loud!
B001XV3LSS|5.0|One my favorite jodie Foster movies. Streaming was great. Excellent quality. I love Amazon Prime. I would definitely recommend this movie. It's Awesome!!
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Great kindle game, I love it.<br /><br />If only all other kindle games were this good. Dunno what else to say....
B000JMKTLO|5.0|This book was just as good at Gone Girl! I Can't wait to read more by Gillian Flynn. I highly recommend!
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Thank you for all of the wonderful information in this book! It was very helpful and extremely easy to understand.
B0064QNS62|2.0|I really don't like it. This game is like a really bad version of Mario. I'm stuck at level 2 because the game doesn't give you instruction or stuff if you are stuck.
B001TODCII|5.0|Suspense, drama, action, and eye catching. Full of I can't leave the tv scenes because you are scared of missing something
B0081FO2Q4|5.0|I began listening at the radio some of the songs in this CD, but know that I heard it all, I love it even more. I love the fact that now I can purchased my music and in an instant is downloaded to my kindle or computer!!!
B0011ZNAIC|5.0|Great movie for children, the animation story line, and characters are great.  It will keep the children attention and keep them quiet
B00BD2DRHW|3.0|It's a game for people who like to think and make constructions. So I like it and definitely would recommend it!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Ppl say that when they play it it crashes on the kindle but it doesn't every one has it on their kindle and it doesn't crash  there's something wrong with there kindle if it messed up;) get it
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Its very intuitive.  Verse of the day is nice.  I like being able to switch from New King James to NIV to NASB.  It also has many other versions you can look at.  It's stable and gets routine updates addressing bugs that exist but I haven't seen.<br /><br />The coolest feature is being able to pick book, then chapter, then verse when listening to a sermon, you get there very quick.  Or during a Bible Study, I'm at the new location right away and can change versions if the teacher wants to hear it in a differen version<br /><br />The only downside is that it looks like I'm texting in church.
B007REV4T8|2.0|I've always been a fan of Bond films, although I've never found the more recent actors to live up to Sean Connery or Roger Moore as the character. Skyfall, like several of the other more recent Bond movies has become more of a bland action film than a classic Bond movie. I will admit that I enjoyed Casino Royale, but that was an exception. Skyfall begins with a rather formulaic car chase scene (yawn) and then transitions to an ultra-cheesy computer hacking plot (has anyone in Hollywood ever touched a real computer?) complete with absurd dialog made up of a random jumble of technical buzzwords. All of this wraps around a ridiculous plot twist and some rather bland drama and finishes up with a bunch of explosions. There was a distinct lack of cool spy gadgets, always a Bond staple, the sole exception being a silly smart-gun that Bond ends up throwing to a baddy instead of ever actually firing it. If you love a mindless action flick, you could certainly do worse, but this is definitely not in my list of favorite Bond films.
B009AHWLHE|5.0|If yo are a fav of Resident Evil then you should take the time to watch Damnation. It is fun and bring back some old friends
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I am really unhappy with this game. I lost everything.All my hoverboards-coins-characters-bluekeys-power points etc. have tried in vain to regain them. have been informed by Amazon that this is the developers fault. I really enjoyed this game -NOT SO MUCH NOW&hellip; I hope that you correct this so in the future new players won't have this problem. Respectfully a74 year old grandmother
B001U7FW1O|3.0|I was maybe expecting a bit more clarity on the DVD. The music brings me back to that era though. Not bad if you like this style of music.
0374531269|5.0|A Long Way Gone was actually a very difficult book to read. Not because the language was hard to understand but more so because the content was absolutely terrifying. Children are being forced into becoming soldiers, killing others, seeing murders and rapes, drug use, stealing, and so on at such a young age. The fact that it was written in first person and the author was the young soldier, it makes it hard to grasp the things he had to face. I could never come close to imagining the things he had to experience at the age that I was still attending school and playing with dolls. The reality of this Sierra Leone story is such a crucial issue that some countries are still facing today and it's completely heartbreaking comparing our own lives to theirs. Ishmael Beah's perspective and writing is raw and so true, it makes your stomach turn at some points. I always wondered to myself, what would I do if I was put into such a horrific situation? I don't think I'd be able to survive through all the things that Beah did. As agonizing as the book may be, I highly recommend this book for future globalization classes or anyone who's willing to read a non-fictional book about events that are still occurring in different parts of the world. It's pure and honest and raw and definitely a book you can get caught up with.
B007KLEHUQ|5.0|Love the show and band withe crowd interaction. The picture is clear and sound great. I would recommend to all PC lovers to buy this one.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|I have loved everything that this writer has written and this is no exception. wonderful world building in such a small number of pages
B003VB5E2E|5.0|Cool blue-ray and a quality line up of musical genius. It is great to see Clapton with these other artiats still being &#34;Slow Hands&#34;<br />Great sound but the show is slow. Be patient when watching this and you will be rewarded.
B0091REZMW|4.0|you can play this game for free. just play one time per day. other similiar games only lasted a couple days before solved.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|I like this product because it is watchable. and I  do like this dvd. and I recommend for other viewer too.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|So much more than the part most people talk about. I am so very glad the story doesn't end here!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I couldn't put it down! Right away I was interested in the characters and the plot, very fast paced and a major twist.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I liked this book, the story line seemed so simple, I keep thinking about what the rest of the book was going to be about, then the author sets the hook and the story goes off into another direction.  I liked the writing style, didn't care much for the ending, but i would recommend this as an interesting read.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I work in the Wildland Fire Suppression/Management profession. Working in a male dominated profession for over a decade has taught me a few things but this book confirmed them and also added to my perspective. I think this is really good book for any woman that is a professional role in any profession. I don't agree with all of the advise in the book, however most of it is very good advise and I plan to apply some of it to my work life. Great read!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|One of the best series I have seen in along time.Truly shows how the world changed with WW1 even though the series is fictional
B009NG1Q96|4.0|This book was great I made you think it was captivating kiera cass great great job love your books amazing job
B000FFJYB6|5.0|Mandatory - have a lot of kleenex nearby when watching this film!  The ending tore me up.  There are so many things to recommend about this film.  It takes place in 1942 and the sets, houses, and town look authentic.  It has a Jack Russell Terrier (I own one myself,  or I should say he owns me).  It deals with many themes, war, death, bullying, first loves, dogs, hunting and more.  Its emotions are all over the place.  A heartwarming story for the whole family, although it leaves you in tears.
B006YTTVHO|3.0|Most of this is just good common sense, though there were some helpful suggestions.  Maybe extreme introvets would find it more helpful.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|Great book. This book gives a good overview of how to marry IT Operations with Development in an engaging story. It gives a good introduction and has challenged me to look into this topic further.
B00947N6UG|5.0|Rise of the Guardians is a beautiful movie for all ages.  The story line is terrific, it makes the children who are questioning who really are Santa, Tooth Fairy and the Easter Bunny believe all over again.  A lovely family movie, highly recommend
B007BFSYMS|4.0|Loving this app. I like the customzition. Puts me to sleep! Especially with my own mix of a crackling fire and crickets.
B000F8O2OM|5.0|Have loved this show since it first came on TV.  Lost my previous copy of all seasons in a house fire, so now am replacing.
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|Another slide and switch to make three or more icons  line-up vertically or horizontally.  It's more challenging than the earlier puzzles and the graphics are entertaining.  I can play solo or I can let my grand kids play along. They love it too.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|One of the most absorbing television shows in a long time.  Acting is phenomenal and the characters are very thoroughly drawn.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|This episode is so great and it make you want to continue with the next one. Picture quality was perfect. Thank you
B005HSL626|3.0|It seems kind of boring, your are swinging a knife cutting fruit. It would be better if there was a person doing something that he had to keep the fruit from getting him.
B00499NHLC|5.0|The story was good, the quality was good, and that's all the reasons I need as far as I'm concerned.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Looking forward to the final book.. the writing makes you feel like you are invested and in the middle of the story... great writer.
B002W5GPVE|5.0|I like that it was offered as an e-book version.  I liked how quickly it was downloaded to my device.
B005HSL626|5.0|Lots of entertainment! Fun to play and keeps the grandchildren occupied with the IPONE or Kindle.  Wish I had it on my cell phone, too.
B005898CFI|5.0|For a movie made with very little script and prop full of average acting throughout, this is great family fun and some of the action scenes filmed aboard trucks when the gang are capturing animals are fantastic, even by 2013 standards. And this is a movie made over fifty years ago! Beautifully filmed, take care - it is easy to crave a trip on safari shortly afterward! John Wayne, in a comic foil to the excellent Red Buttons, clearly enjoys his African adventure and it is impressive to see he and the actors actually in some of the dangerous scenes such as when they capture that uber violent rhino. Well worth doing what we did... sitting back, ordering pizza, a chilled six pack of beer and to lose yourself in some harmless fun.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Entertaining! Best historical fiction ever. Fifteen words required nine ten eleven twelve thirten fourteen fifteen, and five more words required. Damn I hate that requirement...
B00B99KJR0|4.0|Thanks for making this a free app.  When time starts running low during play a pop up message appears saying &quot;harry up time is running out&quot;  Harry is a person's name.  It should read &quot;Hurry up time is running out&quot;  :-)
B009NQXXZ6|5.0|I love this movie. I've had it for a few years on VHS, but wanted it on DVD Blu-ray.If you like older movies and Streisand, you'll love this one.
B00004TJKI|5.0|I always wanted a copy of this movie as I was there during one scene that was being filmed. I grew up in one of the towns where it was filmed and this movie brings back memories of my hometown. Remember seeing the author of the book this movie was based on and went by his home often.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Bought based on a lot of recommendations from preppers and/or bushcrafters, it's a beast of a knife and will do anything you ask it to.  Best knife for the price out there, as far as I'm concerned.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|After falling in love with all the characters in the first season, I really began to root for them in the second season.  Such great story lines.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This book was really good. Kind of predictable throughout,<br />however, the ending was unexpected. If you like romance and suspense, this one if for you.
0756407915|4.0|There are so many things I like about this book.  Rothfuss is a very good writer and the world he has created is interesting.<br /><br />However, there are also glaring negatives.  The first is the length of the book.  The first few hundred pages, especially, didn't do much for the story.  I think it might have been better to write smaller volumes and develop the various plotlines a bit deeper.  On the brightside, I guess Rothfuss saved me money by putting it all in one 1,000 page book.<br /><br />The second negative is Denna and her relationship with Kvothe.  We're now over 1,600 pages and a couple years into their relationship and literally NOTHING has happened.  They flirt.  They giggle.  She curtsies.  He goes out of his way to be a gentleman.  For goodness sake, DO SOMETHING!!  It's like one of the many TV series where the two main characters happen to be a (very attractive) man and a (very attractive) woman.  The sexual tension lasts for years and hundreds of episodes.  Everytime it looks like they will finally express their love for each other, something happens to interrupt them and the suspense grows.  With Denna and Kvothe, it's beyond boring.<br /><br />Lastly, I was frustrated by the plotline with the Adem.  They are skilled warriors whose entire lives are devoted to learning what we would call a martial art, yet Rothfuss does not allow the reader to see the Adem in action.  All they do in the book is train Kvothe.  I kept waiting for their village to be invaded or for them to be called into action somewhere in the world, but Kvothe just went on his way after his training.  Maybe we'll see it in the 3rd book?<br /><br />All in all, this is a good book that I enjoyed...but it could have been so much more.
B002QE3CTY|1.0|After downloading this book I tried to read it and when I opened the book it was blank all the way through.<br /><br />Very disappointed!
B00BSBY38A|3.0|Visually stunning to watch, I felt the story was sweet, but the writing/acting was a bit on the cheesy side.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|While I am thoroughly enjoying this album, it does not include Little Fall of Rain, the song between Fontine and Val Jean just before she dies or the song with Val Jean and the Innkeepers - like the Broadway album has!
B00AECGQF2|5.0|It is so much fun to play with I mean you can cut the hair the way you like it and color it, shave it,straten it, and lots more!!
B001P06GX4|5.0|This has become our go-to game when we just want something short and thought provoking!  Even our 8 year old daughter likes it!
B00BG08FKK|5.0|Love the double CD.  I always play it full blast.  I can close my eyes and see the entire film in my mind as I listen.  It's great!
B005S9EKCW|5.0|It was amazing in the theatre and now I can watch it whenever the mood strikes!  And, I can share the &#34;safe&#34; parts with my daughters by fast forwarding through the more adult stuff.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I enjoyed this. The graphics were good and the puzzles were engaging. It was definitely worth the price to download the rest of the game.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Although I knew how it was going to end, Daniel Day-Lewis's portrayal of Abe makes him so real!  I cry at the end every time.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I found the book disturbing and comforting. You can't &#34;enjoy&#34; a book about dying and the holocaust, however the story was one of love and friendship in unexpected ways. This was very well-written.
B000OIZUW6|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, if fact, I couldn't put it down.  Jackdaws is based on a true event during World War II.
B0031QUTBA|5.0|My childhood is back! Great Product! Cheaper than other sellers while gives the same enjoyment. I recommend every fan of friends buy this!
B0061PEAUY|5.0|Interesting reading. I always enjoy story's with smart independent yet vulnerable women as the main character.  I will be reading more of Kathy Reich's  books.
B0070Y46UY|1.0|This was probably the worst book I have ever read I had to listen to it because I didn't want to read it if there was a zero ratings on this I would give it a negative 55 do not get this book a waste of money
B009VA1FN6|5.0|Like other Kate Morton books I have read, I can't put it down.  Only complaint is that the format is also like her other book I read, going back and forward over the generations.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|I saw many previews for this movie before I actually watched it with my family. Based on the trailers, it seemed to be a movie about aviation. Actually, the core theme is how alcoholism destroys lives, families, relationships, etc. Over the years a great many movies about the nightmares of drugs and alcohol have been produced. This is one of the better ones. Denzel Washington does a great job as an alcoholic pilot whose life is destroyed by the bottle. The supporting cast was impressive as well.<br /><br />Part of the charm of this movie is the absence of racial and political cant. The principal characters are of several races and sexes. However, they are Americans first and foremost, troubled Americans to be sure, but regular folks nonetheless. Sadly, too many movies turn every character into some sort of racial stereotype. Not this one.<br /><br />Captain Whitaker's attacks on the Pilots union were a bit off. However, his character is an alcoholic recovering from a devastating crash. The actual union officials in the movie are depicted as serious and supportive individuals (too supportive of Captain Whitaker actually).<br /><br />The only serious negative is the PC treatment of Christian fundamentalists who are (predictably) portrayed as crazies.<br /><br />Well worth watching.
B000ICXQGK|4.0|very great movie. I recommend children watch too!  I love Robin Williams. This movie and Patch Adams go hand in hand.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This book echoed much of my own experience in life.<br /><br />This book taught me to no longer live in fear, to no longer underestimate myself, to ask for options, to picture myself in a position where I like to be.<br /><br />This book taught me to like myself, to justify my past boldness that had cost me, to understand that I had been right most of the time.<br /><br />This book taught me that it's not too late, it's all right to move on, it's possible to find a support base.<br /><br />This book taught me to find the best way that would work for me... And that it does exist.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|u should read the book.it's one of the best books I've ever read.Though u might want to wait until u are 12 or 13 years old to read it.There's a lot of girlfriend/boyfriend stuff
B0045HCJKS|5.0|This is supposed to be a suspense movie and it is very good. But also very funny it was made in the 70's and it's a little on the corny side I remember seeing this in the drive-in when I was young.  It was great!  I love Yul Brynner!  Though he does not have many lines.  He was perfect for the story
B0031569HE|5.0|This book covers a lot of material and really will prepare you for the test.  It is GMAT specific and written by the pros.  I would buy it again!
1451695195|2.0|This was a quick and interesting read, but the descriptions of him in 'heaven' were very short and the 'proof' was thin at best. Riding on a butterfly wing was more 'real' than reality? It sounds more like a bacteria-induced hallucination and, in fact, he also writes about long, drawn-out dream sequences that were also described as very 'real,' but then he says they were not quite as real as the heaven experiences.<br /><br />The closest proof or evidence: He recognized his long-deceased sister (whom he never saw in person since he was adopted) from a photo and then realized it was the person on the butterfly wing. This was persuasive, but not convincing. There just wasn't enough 'there' there.<br /><br />I expected more from a scientist.
B00C1BV9Z6|5.0|It was The fine Acting that made this Movie what it is, Even the Special effects were not as good as the Actors that really gave this movie what it needed to be a block buster.
B000ION23A|5.0|KIDS LOVED IT.  FUN FOR THE ADULTS TOO. GOOD EXAMPLE AND FUN.  KIDS WATCH IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN. KEEPS THEM OCCUPIED AND THEY LEARN TOO.
1609611543|5.0|I learned a lot of what I had already expected from this book and even more that I did not have a clue about. A very informative book and a quick read. The book gets very deep into the physiology of how gluten affects the human body and blood chemistry so at certain points in the book you feel like you are reading a medical journal but overall it is a very good book.
B001SN78JO|5.0|LOVE JIM CAREY.  FUN FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY.  GREAT FUN. WILL ORDER ALL JIM CAREY MOVIES. GREAT ACTOR TOO. THANK YOU.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|it was good. I was disappointed that it was the end. it wasn't as good as catching fire. I look forward to the movies that come out. later. I am sure they wont be as good as the books tho.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Good all around movie about healing of relationships, forgiveness and remaining true to those you love. And it doesn't hurt there was baseball involved!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I didn't want to put it down. when I did I thought about the book and what could happen next etc.
B00BUCW54Q|1.0|This is NOT what was envisioned. Tom Cruise alone is the polar opposite of what the character is. The studio could have gotten a ton of other well qualified actors for the part. If you haven't read a single book in the series, this is probably alright. But if you've read any of them, and especially if you're a fan, this movie is garbage. When it comes to film adaptations, this is so bad that Battlefield Earth looks like one of the best films ever.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|I love this show.  Great characters, strong women, it's hbo so there is a lot of gore and violence but it fits into the time frame and tough characters of the show.  They are not shy either so expect nudity.  I downloaded the first 2 seasons and watched both in days and now I have to wait for each Sunday night to watch which is not as fun.
B0063M22QO|5.0|i NEVER play computer games,  saw this Kindle app and decided to try.  its very fun, easy or as hard as you want it to be.  not complex, just have to keep moving....<br />the light is a bit hard on my eyes, that is my only 'con' ....
B00C2VIA52|4.0|If it was a little easier to get runes(need them to get rares &amp; uncommons) short of paying cash, I'd give it 5 stars.  Still a very enjoyable card game.
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|Very well made, exciting and intense!!  This movie will send chills up and down your spine.  Good cinematography and music.
0618918248|5.0|See the other reviews-simply wanted to make sure there was another five star review for this book.  Fantastic, easy read.
B0089LOG02|5.0|A solid piece of historical fiction, this story captured me from beginning to end.  The ending was perfect, leaving me with a good feeling.  The past and the present are beautifully woven together through Vivian and Molly, while spinning a tale of twisting emotions.<br /><br />Seventeen year old Molly, a foster child who is about to be too old for foster care, is given fifty hours of community service for trying to steal a book.  In the past nine years, Molly has been in over a dozen foster homes, some for as little as a week. She's become very defiant.  The one thing Molly hates most about the foster care system is the dependence on people you barely know, your vulnerability to their whims.  She has learned not to live a life of expectations.  She's not too keen on devoting fifty hours of her life to Vivian in a drafty attic, going through endless boxes of stuff.<br /><br />Ninety one year old Vivian Daly, lives in a fourteen room victorian mansion and wants to have her attic cleaned out with the help of Molly. There are many boxes to be opened and Vivian's past is soon revealed.  Vivian's family left Ireland for America in 1929 in hopes of a brighter future, thinking they were on their way to a land of plenty.  But, they failed miserably, ill suited for the rigors of emigration.  The family meets with tragedy and Vivian is soon on her way to the mid-west on the orphan train - headed for the unknown.<br /><br />I was not at all familiar with this strange and little known episode in our nation's history.  The  orphan trains existed from 1854 - 1929. Each child has a sad tale; they wouldn't be on the train otherwise.  They are told that they are lucky to be on this orphan train.  They are leaving an evil place, full of ignorance, poverty and vice, for the nobility of country life.  They had simple rules to adhere to and if they didn't obey these rules, they would be sent back to where they came from and discharged on the street, left to fend for themselves.<br /><br />Adoptive parents gathered at the train stations looking for a child to adopt.  A child is selected for free on a ninety-day trial, at which point, they had the right to send the child back.  But, too many times the children were abused.  Babies and healthy older boys were typically chosen first.  Older girls were chosen last.  If a child wasn't chosen, they'd get back on the train and try again at the next town.<br /><br />The author brings richness and life to this compelling story - completely absorbing and wonderfully written.  I highly recommend./>Adoptive parents gathered at the train stations looking for a child to adopt.

B008YWY0HK|5.0|See above comment.  A little violent for the kiddos, but I was absolutely blown away.<br />Came quickly, great condition.<br />As an American, I thought it was absolutely fantastic to see the almost-nudity at the end, as well as the flirty interactions between the parents-maybe we are realizing there is nothing wrong with the body!!<br />LOVE this movie.
B000HWZ4A2|5.0|Gary Cooper was the perfect choice of an actor to convey the role of the enduring hero... He always was! Patricia Neal is extremely convincing as the sophisticated representative of an era... Ayn Rand (he author of the novel upon which the film was based) is said to have been personally involved in the creation of the script. Whether or not the viewer is convinced by Rand's ideas and their applicability to today's world, the film offers an interesting view of corporate life and its engines!
B009AMANH4|5.0|So well done! I have watched it three times since I received it. With the combo pack I was able to let a friend watch without effecting my viewing.
0307352153|5.0|This book was well-researched, clearly and engagingly written, and exceeded my expectations in helping me to understand the ramifications of being an introvert in a very loud world.
0345803507|5.0|If you weren't already a huige fan of the Fifty Shades Trilogy... then I feel bad for you. But this is by far the best book in the Trilogy, and this seller was soo awesome and getting the book to me in a timely fashion.
0199571120|5.0|Our office needed an unabridged dictionary updated with technology terms. We are very satisfied with the Oxford and it was at a reasonable price.
1401938906|4.0|I can't say every single experiment worked for me, but the fun is in the &#34;trying&#34; and just being open to the idea of these concepts. Definitely a fun, easy read. (And re-read!) If you are at all open and interested in these kinds of ideas--go for it! (And I will admit that more than half of the experiments did work for me!)
0736420959|5.0|This is a great book. This book teaches children about the animals that you would see in a zoo. It also teaches responsibility and sadly to say about death. This book also teaches children about what animals are like in the wild. This book has a great story line and it will keep children interested the whole way through the book.
B000XR4OC0|5.0|I thought these might not be comfortable right away, but I loved them right out of the box.  They feel narrow at first while slipping them on, but quickly fit your foot. The foot bed is comfortable and has some arch support although I didn't work in them or walk around all day in them.  I just did some errands and went to a cookout for a bit.  The navy is a good dark navy color.  I love my shoes and I love that somewhere someone else has a pair because I bought them.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|When I think Scholastic, I think of young reader who are still developing their language skills and because of that it is important to be thorough with the editing.  It is improper to end a sentence with a preposition and things like that should be caught in the proofreading process.  The formatting of this book is also terrible with font size changes scattered randomly throughout.
B0081336FO|5.0|If you liked season one you will like season two!!  Now I'm stuck waiting for a new season.  This happened to me with Weeds too.
B00AQM8H9I|4.0|This game is fun and easy to understand.  The acheivements could be expanded.  Playing against players online would be nice.  It is extremely cute and tests your logic.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I this book is amazing I don't even know how to describe it ! I was left we constant suspense in every single page I can't wait for the next book !!!
B0061PEAUY|5.0|I have read a number of Kathy Reichs books, and usually I have a better sense of the out come than I did for this one.  While the ending was not a &#34;surprise ending,&#34; I did see my early conclusions peeled away and various villains became part of the murder scenario, but not part of &#34;the&#34; murder story.  Once in the northern territory, the issue of diamonds was constantly cast before the reader, but for some reason I just didn't place it at center stage.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A must read for all who crave sci-fi.  I can't wait to start the next book ans see the next film in the series.
B0031Y9DCS|5.0|I've read many Vietnam accounts and this is one of the best, it's also completely different to stories from those on the ground. I can't recommend this highly enough.<br /><br />The technical info on how helicopters work and tricks you can use to get out of trouble is fascinating too.
B0078ZTWP4|5.0|Other reviews helped me decide what was best for my needs.  It is just as advertised and maybe even better.
B006LSZECO|5.0|It's interesting that the reviews on \\"Gone Girl\\" are so \\"split,\\" mostly focusing on the ending, which I thought was well done.  If you're looking for everything tied up in a neat little bow, you may want to pass.  Part of what makes this book so provocative -- one I'm still thinking about some days later -- is that the author doesn't \\"check all the boxes.\\"<br /><br />The author does a great job of character depiction -- truly we know Amy way too well.  I don't think she writes as well in the male voice (Nick), but she is still quite effective.<br /><br />I recommend this book.  I could not put it down!  Enjoy!
B008K9SG9K|5.0|I've listened to their album probably twenty times through now. A mix of folk, pop, and rock, I can't think of anyone who wouldn't like their style of music!
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I haven't reviewed the competition, and I don't understand all of the permissions.<br />That being said, I've not found any problems or faults with this app.  The file management system allows any configuration I've tried, and I've had no problem with attachments.  No complaints.
1616550414|5.0|If you love the games this is a great keepsake. My son was thrilled... he played the games &#34;back in the day&#34; and is now 22
B000GOWNPU|5.0|Although it is a sad reminder of how cruel people can be, it seems necessary to remind everyone. I really liked this movie. Well acted and love the reference to The Count of Monte Cristo.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Nice graphics., intriguing story.  Hidden objects clear and not dark or fuzzy like some other games. There is only one warning- Free trial game but then you will need to purchase to continue.
B000U1ZV44|3.0|Hi. This item is okay and I would be willing to buy more in the future if needed. Thumbs Up!
B00BHU9DUK|1.0|If not for my wife, never would have watch this movie. Fell asleep during and glad I miss a bunch of it.

B008JFUTT0|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie; so much so, three viewings were necessary!  He's a humble man and his three daughters are sweet, supportive, and overwhelmed by his massive popularity in post-apartheid South Africa.  His fans, \\"musicologist detectives,\\" were persistent, thank goodness!<br /><br />His songs dispelled some of the isolation felt by the people of South Africa, where the government withheld outside news and riots were routinely bloody.  Rodriguez earned early exposure from music producers in his bar venues, but his albums seemingly bombed in the US. His producers were allegedly at loss over this occurrence; the film hypothesizes that little to no interest could have been due to prejudices regarding his Hispanic name. Thereupon, Rodriguez was quickly dropped from the Sussex label, \\"two weeks before Christmas.\\" If three South African labels were sending royalty payments to the US, he didn't receive any of this.<br /><br />When asked later for his opinion about the quality of Cold Fact, his first album, he finally concedes he had thought it was a good album.  He seemingly, nonplussed, went about construction work and taking odd jobs to support himself and his family.  He tried running for mayor but with a loaded ballot and misspelling of his name, did not succeed.<br /><br />Perhaps the \\"extras,\\" which I haven't accessed yet (misplaced the remote) discuss who \\"Jesus Rodriguez\\" and the \\"Sixth Prince\\" are---I'm guessing other names for, or alter egos of, Rodriguez?<br /><br />For awhile, I thought his rediscovery was only to see him filmed in his everyday life, adopted after his unsuccessful music career, and I found myself despairing for his unfulfilled life.<br /><br />Then, to see him, no longer sitting with his back to the crowd out of fear, and actually facing and interacting with a wildly supportive, loving audience, was even more tear-inducing! The crowd shots are wonderful. Thanks to those who searched for him and brought him to the forefront, belatedly,but deservedly and to the CBC's Jian Ghomeshi for his interview and piquing of my interest. Here's hoping this great movie gets picked up for Best Documentary!
B004SRPXWQ|3.0|It's ok for free.  After a couple days it started closing randomly right after opening it. (using nexus 7 16gb)
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|If you're a child of the 80's with a heart for all things Sci-Fi, Nerd-Fi, and Period Pop, you will not want to put this book down! Ernest Cline gives us nostalgia as adventure, filled with humor, whimsy, and savvy suspense.
B008HK3XYK|5.0|ist's perfect. Exactly what I was looking for. Perfect size, cool color, easy assembly, ideal protection, best way to make it stand on its own.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I thought this was a good sqeuel to the first book, which I loved.  I was fully engaged and entertained by both the first and second books.  I gave this one only 4 stars because the abrupt ending of this one was somewhat of a let down, even though the final book was available immediately.
B00466HM28|3.0|I've never bought a keyboard specifically for interfacing with software synths, though I've been working with hardware and software synths for years.  Though this is not just a plug and play keyboard, and you will likely have to seek out additional drivers.  In that respect its annoying and difficult to use.  It is great for the price and very portable (it fits in my laptop bag with my laptop).  Keep in mind this is not a typical MIDI keyboard as it only has USB output and is intended for a computer.
B00BUCW54Q|4.0|The bad guys were nasty, the action was fun, with good plot twists, and Tom Cruise did his job well. When it came out, the reviews were generally negative, and it didn't do well at the box office. I figured I'd catch it on video. Then I had a free night, and caught it at the discount theater. I was very pleasantly surprised. Jack is a powerful man trying to do the right thing, and he doesn't care about the rules. There's a basic flaw in that philosophy which the movie doesn't address, and that's probably part of why the reviews weren't great. In addition, the supporting characters, with the exception of the female lead, were pretty straightforward, and the relationships not very complex, either.<br />Here's my Achilles heel: I like to win easy. My favorite games are ones in which my team wins in a blowout, and I hate losing like poison. I like Ocean's 11 and 13 because they portray a bunch of guys who never lose even the little battles, and win in straight sets. This movie is pretty much the same way: Jack never gets in too deep, always has the situation under control. But I like watching the good guy win.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|DVD arrived on the release date as promised by Amazon.  Of course I could not wait to open it up.<br />I popped it into the dvd player and enjoyed it for the next 2 hours and 54 minutes.<br />If your not a fan you might give The Hobbit 4 stars.<br />Hey I'm a fan and 5 stars it is.
B00CE6E6B2|5.0|u can build and build there's more than building you can play games u can replace old stuff with new stuff.

B007FTZDN8|5.0|I enjoy the talks and have so much to learn about the world around me. This app is on my kindle, iphone 5 and computer..
B0030DHPGQ|5.0|I actually loved reading this book, based as it is in the reality of the need for all organizations to change, not for the mere sake of change but for the need to address certain areas of structure, growth and development within an organizational to have it meet the needs of today and tomorrow rather than yesterday..  This is a common need but it is often unseen.  An example is the need to suddenly train a certain amount of people who are quite unused to traditional education. Moreover, their jobs are out of date and they must be retrained in entirely new lines of work. How do we do it?  The issues are many and varied.<br />Churches, schools and business and industry can benefit from reading this book.<br />However, as the need for deep change is often not seen, some readers will struggle with this book. It is best used in a small group.

1594484805|5.0|Extremelly shocking and easy to understand. You´ll surely be thinking about improving everything you do after reading these shocking ideas and studies. One of the best books I´ve read
B00AR3WD8W|5.0|Love the new packaging, with more photos and write-ups. The sound it great. KU-U-I-PO and Hawaiian Wedding song are edited versions, The Alternate Aloha included some nice banter with Elvis.
B000I9X668|5.0|Look out. This film is a mover and a shaker. Although masquerading as a silly parody of everyday office life at the end of the millennium, it packs a punch of the heavy-hitting questions we should all be asking ourselves.
B009RH9FR6|4.0|The Marware revolve has meet my expectations and is a nice case for the Kindle Fire HD. I would recommend it anyone considering the purchase of a case.
1400069289|5.0|Very easy to follow and understand.  Step by step instructions on how to understand the habits you have and change the habits you want to change.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is such a great show!  Never thought I'd like something with zombies and so much killing but I got addicted. Can't wait till next Season!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I like this app it is easy to use and read. I also like the way that I it let's you know how much time you have left to do certain things. Very helpful
B005K17RU0|4.0|Detailed forecast, map-in-motion that can't be matched.<br />impressive on a Kindle Fire!<br /><br />Would definitely say THIS is a must have App!  without a doubt!
B000W91RUG|5.0|Any rainy day is a good day to break out &#34;The Big Bang Theory&#34; on DVD and hang out with Sheldon and the gang.
B00BR4QNJ0|2.0|After I installed and opened it, I played it for about 5 minutes and uninstalled the game.  There is no point to it.  I like a game with challenges and this had none. don't waste your time with it.
B00A14SQBU|5.0|&#34;Lotus&#34; is an experience from front to back. There is not single track on this album that is not worthy of airplay. Christina Aguilera once again proves why she is an artist to be reckoned with and an artist who will never truly garner the credit and praise she truly deserves.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Can't put it down after I installed it.  Graphics, power upgrades,  and challenges are much better than the first version.  I would recommend this game AFTER you have played Temple Run (1).
B009YX02T8|3.0|When compared to the soundtracks for the first three films (&#34;Twilight,&#34; &#34;New Moon,&#34; and &#34;Eclipse&#34;) the soundtracks for &#34;Breaking Dawn&#34; Parts I and II were progressively disappointing. Just like the films.
B004LOMB2Q|1.0|Something serious seems to have  happened to Evernote. My app on my iPad is still working fine. But before you buy look at the very current reviews on the Apple Store. Although EN is still getting four and five stars from some users, take a look at the most recent one stars and you may shudder.  The only way that I know how to get there is on my iPad, click on your Apple Store icon, get to the Evernote app (you will probably  have to use the search function to get to it), click on reviews, then set the reviews to show the most recent one stars.  DO NOT change your password until it appears that these serious problems and losses of data are corrected.  I'm looking for an app to use to replace Evernote.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|This was the first Stephen King novel I have ever read. It slows in some spaces and it others, you just cannot bear to part with your Kindle. Toying with Kennedy in a whole new way, King shows the reader the past we want paints a future we are not willing to pay for.
B00BRUYQFC|4.0|I think most of the songs have a great beat. There are some songs that you can dance to and some you can relax and let your mind wander to. It's a pretty good album considering what has been coming out lately from most artists. Overall I'd give it a B+/A- for a grade.
B00B2QG3K2|4.0|Paramore seems to be heading into some new territory and it might take some getting used to for me... &#34;Brand New Eyes&#34; had me spoiled, I think, and while bands should always be seeking to set the bar ever higher and create fresh new sounds, I'm not sure if that's what this self-titled LP is... YET. The most addictive track I find, is probably the most experimental for Paramore, &#34;Ain't It Fun.&#34; Sounds like something MJ would have done in his prime. It will be interesting to see what singles will be released and what singles garner airplay.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Simply the best in the art of animation and story telling. I don't mind watching it again and again because there is always something extra to capture...what a treat!
B0099G6Q5E|5.0|This film was a music geek's dream and so is its soundtrack. If you are a fan of the film, the soundtrack is an absolute must. Some of the tracks are produced and a few are taken directly from the film itself. Fat Amy Forever!
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|While I understand that Tom Cruise does not fit the description of the Jack Reacher character from the books, I cannot think of a capable actor who does fit that character's description. The film lives or dies on this character and I believe Tom Cruise was a perfect choice. He's amiable, smart, and tough...exactly what Jack Reacher is supposed to be. I mean lets face it, the story is nothing new apart from the character of Reacher, and you need an accomplished actor to portray him.<br /><br />That aside, this is a fantastic action flick. Reminded me much of the mystery/thrillers from the 60s & 70s like McQueen's Bullitt. I would say that this is arguably the closest we'll get to another film like Bullitt (which is one of my favorite films), with a great leading character/actor, a tight and tense script, and an amazing car chase. While not the classic Bullitt is, it's still a very fun and entertaining film.<br /><br />The directing, the acting, the writing is all pretty top-notch stuff. Tom Cruise is fantastic in the role of Jack Reacher, and I really hope we get to see him again.
B005Z271Y6|5.0|Excellent concert. Adele has a great voice and she's so funny! If you like Adele, you have to have this DVD
B0076DCT2G|3.0|Notwithstanding the wry comments from our key player I found the book to be a bit plodding or pedantic.  The dialogue was basic and the plot path meandering.  It was ok, just not that great.
B003BA4CAU|5.0|Wonderful movie, a real classic, laugh and cry at the same time.  Everyone should see this and not just once, over and over.
B0058SNI9O|5.0|These shoes fit perfectly and are so comfortable.  Love them!  I will be buying another pair in the very near future.
B003F9E5D6|4.0|Invictus is one of the most important movies that I have seen during my lifetime.  You will not be disappointed if you are a lover of history.
B00457WZEI|4.0|This is a good animal and horse lover story. The main interest is from the horse's point of view. The book gives a lot of detail of the credulity of war on both the humans and the animals that played such an important role.
B004LROUNG|3.0|The novel starts out with a different twist and grabs your attention.  Unfortunately not all that far into it the story starts to take on the direction of The King of Torts with a subplot in the background leaning to The Rainmaker. The Litigators is at best an OK, strictly entertainment read.  Much of the time you find yourself despising the majority of characters, thank goodness there's a couple of lawyers with a conscience thrown in to keep you from becoming totally cynical on the legal profession.  This will never rate of there with some of John Grisham's top works, it does not get you thinking and anticipating the outcome like A Time to Kill,  The Chamber or The Confession.  If you're a John Grisham fan you'll find it to be an OK read, if you're not a John Grisham fan you might find yourself thinking it was a waste of your time.
B003UBTX6S|2.0|It was ok.  I find myself still trying to get into the story.  There is so much to remember; between characters and their powers.
B001TM14VC|5.0|The sounds of the Jets and the Carrier Deck Scenes give the sense of being there. Worth Cranking up the Sound.
006224454X|4.0|I picked up this book knowing nothing about it, and started to read.  I'm glad I hadn't read any of the negative reviews on this site.<br /><br />I LOVED this book.  The writing was simple, but I didn't find the premise (woman wakes up every morning with no memories)to be tedious at all.  This is a book where you want to jump on every little clue, any little scrap of new information.<br /><br />I was riveted and lost in this book.  I thought the construction of the narrative was brilliant: first person past and present tense, much of it re-reading the journal of the amnesiac.<br /><br />This book *almost* reminded me of Gorky Park in that I was expecting a mass-market thriller/mystery, and came away with a much richer reading experience ... not to mention much to think about in my own life and relationships.<br /><br />I cried at the end.  (I cry at movies sometimes, almost never while reading.)  Then I had to go back and re-read the last 50 pages.<br /><br />For me, this book was a surprising gem and I highly recommend it.
B004EPZ034|5.0|enjoyed this movie the whole family and would reconmend this movie for all families-product was in good condiotn when we recieved it on time
B001U0HBQ0|5.0|Its a very good movie..i was afraid that i wouldnt be able to watch the nearly 3 hr movie but it definately gripped me and made me watch it all. These ppl giving it 1 and 2 stars are idiots..they are complaining that the CGI kills it..it doesnt! It's CGI what do u expect? We arent at the point where it looks 100% yet. Its a very great movie. Good acting and has a good look to it....i think they nailed it. Im honored to own this awesome masterpiece. Buy it!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I didn't think I'd like the series.  Boy was I wrong!  I'm addicted!  It is so convenient watching on my iPad.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|This book is just like a werewolf romance but even better.<br />I say it's better than twilight. It is amazing.
B00AFYZDL2|5.0|As a huge Saxon fan, I'm never dis-apponted with a new offering by my all time favorite metal band. The new LP is no exception. The still rock as hard as they ever did.<br /><br />I got this on both CD and Picture Disc Vinyl. The CD sounds excellent but Im dis-appointed in the vinyl version. All I can hope is that in the future,Saxon doesn't put out any more picture discs. The sound quality is aweful.That was my reason for buying the CD.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game.  The kids love it.  I like it too, although I can't play it all that well.  Its still alot of fun.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Daniel Day-Lewis becomes the living breathing Lincoln in this true to the period vision of Lincoln's push to pass the 13th amendment to legally demonstrate that all men are created equal. You will be pulled into the political gamesmanship of this group of rivals as they work for and against eachother to win or defeat passage. Each member of the cast embodies their character to the point where you are submerged in the story, caught up in the drama. The fact that over 1000 people have written reviews will tell you that this DVD is well worth an addition to you viewing library.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|One of those silly little relaxing things you can do while waiting in the dr's office to waste some time if you are tired of reading for awhile. Not anything to challenge you, but, something different to do for awhile. You might want to keep the sound down not to irritate others if in an office!
0374531269|3.0|This book is truly remarkable for it describes detailed events from a young boy's perspective. To be forced into a world that is filled with guns, drugs, and violence is truly horrific. Blessed with an opportunity, the young boy was able to change his life and get a second chance only one can dream of. Sierra Leone is not a place many people know of or even imagine all the injustice that occurs in that country. Beah's story helps to show the world all that occurs and to open our eyes to reality. This book brings inspiration and hope for all those who read it because it gives an extraordinary example of how you can be at your lowest point and with just a helping hand your life can be changed. Also for those who help others; you can make a huge impact on someone's life. I would definitely recommend this book for it is a great example of globalization, feminism, and hope for the future.
B009VSW15Y|4.0|It's pretty good however, I do wish that there was someway they could improve the camera so you could see what you are shooting. Taking pictures blind is a pain in the neck! So far, I have had to delete all the videos I have done, however, it is not the camera's fault, it is the taker's fault!! (mine), however, practice will help that! The timer camera does help with getting to see what you are going to take a picture of but, there still needs to be some improvement to use this for picture taking, so, I continue to take my camera along with me too!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love this game. Love the way the horse is like it's real. Love grooming and giving it treats and playing champions.
B0053FANS6|5.0|i only bought the trilogy because it was cheaper than buying the first two separately. The third movie is a total loss as far as I can tell, but the first is still my favorite movie of all time. Irony!
B008393Q2O|4.0|great for note taking use it for things to do list and comments worth noting.also use it to establish priorities
B00CATSONE|3.0|An earlier version of this review was based on the assumption that the book cost 2,36 (about $3). This is the price I see in the Spanish Kindle store.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.es/Nikola-Tesla-Imagination-Invented-ebook/dp/B00CATSONE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1367398463&sr=8-1&keywords=tesla+imagination<br /><br />Given that the book is apparently free for US customers, I suppose there must have been a pricing mistake, so I take my previous review back. I just write this to let the author know about this issue, I'll delete the review in short order.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a very fun app. a family game we pass around. I'd totally recommend it, very fun for the little ones.
0375869026|5.0|My son 8.5 years read this book and though some points are intense and a little sad, it really opened up conversations on different topics, bullying, compassion, caring and friendships.<br /><br />When my son started asking questions and discussing the book, I picked it up and read it also.....<br /><br />I love the way the author told the story from the main character's (August) point of view, then the sister (Via) and August's friends (Summer and Jack).  Very well written and kept his interest.  Such a nice story.
1607066017|5.0|I've been wanting to read through this series for awhile, it came in excellent condition, no complaints. thanks so much!
B003DS3GC0|5.0|The cast as always was great! I would like to just write fourteen more words so that I can submit this.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|G5 never seems to disappoint with their games. The graphics and storyline always deliver. Look forward to more games as i play them all.
B0010SKUYM|3.0|I really wanted to love this book with how much people hyped it up for me but it fell short on entertainment.  There were parts I really liked but most of the story seemed to drag on.  My biggest complaint is there were way to many unanswered questions and not enough world building to fully emerse me in the book.
0307749347|5.0|Everyday in the life of a General Manager there are so many negative things that I can focus on. Shawn's book is teaching me to entertain positive thoughts! Right now as a group we are texting three things that we are thankful for. I like seeing the responses. Life changing!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|So fun!!!!Love it.the best game ever,tried many other bingo games. Nothing tops this one,!!!!! Play now you won't be sorry!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is awesome it is so addicting and I only did this for points yep so download if your looking for something to do while bored
B0061PEAUY|5.0|I have several of Kathy's books and like them all I was happy to get this on my Kindle I have book cases full of authors I collect (to much clutter):-) It's a page turner. Enjoy
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|Awesome album by a great band. It was nice being able to download the tracks instantly while waiting for the physical cd to arrive.
0374531269|4.0|The novel, Long Way Gone gave me a vivid image of how the lives of children in war-ravaged communities in Africa must live. The concept of child soldiers should be intolerable to any nation. Period. It is unfortunate that Beah had to suffer through that ordeal. It's common for many young people to accept the livelihood as a soldier. They may not have a place to go to, they many not have a family. Unfortunately, the story of Beah resonates with many young children in America as well who join gangs. The story in my opinion affirms the ideology that family is important for anyone growing up.<br /><br />In the novel, the idea that vengeance should be the objective of all soldiers did nothing but create a vicious cycle in which Beah was virtually brainwashed to be a part of. The story was disheartening in many ways, however to learn that children to part in drug use as well as soldier behavior helped me understand the lengths that the leaders of the soldiers will go to achieve their goal.<br />In sum, I was aware of the suffering that these children such as Beah were living through while growing up. Movies such as Hotel Rwanda and Blood Diamond did a great job in depicting the lives of these people, as well as Beah's story. I am glad that Beah was able to be rescued from the situation as well as other children. However, going forward, our nations and other nations should do whatever it takes to rescue these children and citizens from the hell that they are living in.
B006JP11HQ|5.0|This book shuld be required reading by every high school student. I'm 72 years old, they will never never find out about capitalism in our public schools.
0470913029|5.0|excellent guidelines for a new life style change.  It explained all the medical benefits to change you life. Very complete and informative
1878424114|5.0|Simply put this is an excellent book. The author does a masterful job of identifying the issues that prevent individuals from achieving success and providing effective solutions. You won't be disappointed
B0079R8KO0|5.0|We tried to other less expensive cases before this one.  We were disappointed in them.  This case works beautifully.  It protects the Kindle well without adding a lot of bulk.  It is extremely easy to set up on a table at an angle to type, surf or just read.  Other similar cases would not hold the device securely.
B000UZQI0Q|5.0|Some people are great writers but in this case I'd say that Sanderson is a great story teller. This book wasn't fantastic, but it was a very good sequel and was probably necessary to bring the conclusion about in the third book. The first book was better and I anticipate the third being better still. This book kept my attention even though it started pretty slow. Will read the trilogy again I'm sure sometime in the future.
B001AQQR2S|4.0|Both of my children enjoyed this film of the Roald Dahl book by the same name.  The movie followed the book closely.  The actors were well cast, which is important in a children's movie if adults are going to enjoy the film as well.
B006YB9VJU|5.0|You can really streamline your mobile phone experience with these unique NFC tags. They are easy, fast and responsive. Perfect for any tech junkie.
B00B69UQJY|5.0|Loved the album. The GF and I cannot wait to seem them in LA this September!!! Can't wait to see what they come up with for this tour!
B005LAIISU|5.0|Awesome movie, my granddaughter loved it even more. :)<br />Thanks for the movie. It was one of the best CGI I've ever seen.
B00BQHA06A|3.0|I was so psyched for this album but sadly this doesn't have the energy or ability to pull you in like other HIM albums. Don't get me wrong there are moments but unfortunately only brief flashes...I can't even say that there is even one song that really grabs me. After just listening to Tears on Tape, I found the need to listen to some 'real' HIM and am now about halfway through Venus Doom as I write this.<br /><br />If you are a HIM fan, go ahead and buy the CD. Support them! If you are just checking out HIM for the first time, please do yourself a favor and pick a different CD...like Dark Light or Venus Doom.<br /><br />UPDATE: After my 4th listen through entire CD...I need to upgrade my review to 3 stars though I still find this to be my least favorite HIM CD.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This was a beautifully written, lovely and sad book. The characters are so real and flawed, yet wonderful and lovable.
B0091REZMW|4.0|This is a fun game...patience is a virtue! you will need to keep this free only if you want it free!
B009IA9OLE|5.0|I love this app.  It is a great strategy game that is tons of fun.  I literally could not put it down.
B00BD07SGU|5.0|Upon first hearing the single Hopeless Days, I was leery about the new album.  However, after listening to this album in its entirety I will proclaim it to be a success.  My only question is why didnt Amorphis include all of the great bonus tracks.  They would have worked great on the record.  I did order the vinyl edition and it comes with two of them.<br /><br />I suggest anyone interested in Amorphis to seek out these tracks from the Circle sessions.<br /><br />Dead Mans Dream<br />New Song<br />Illusions<br />His Story<br />My Future<br /><br />All are of high caliber.
078322611X|5.0|Awesome movie. Inspired me to go visit the actual Field of Dreams and I wasn't disappointed. Tip: visit in late August or September when the corn has come in more. I showed up in June the first time and didn't see any corn. Found out from coworkers that there's a farmers saying: Knee high by the fourth of July.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I feel like it should be in everyone's library. Its easy to read, and filled with topics that can help any relationship
1476734941|5.0|I caught the PBS show where Michael Mosley went round and spoke with vaious doctors and professors regarding various forms of fasting (used in a very broad sense) and it was so appealing I went online to see if I could find out more and I found this book. It has been very easy to do the two day fasting and the authors offer some easy ideas for super low calorie meals.  If you can catch the program (sorry, you'll have to do a search) the book will make even more sense. Good luck.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Excellent game with very nice graphics!. It is challenging and addictive. All my family including my 5 year old kid love it.
B00AIJP9BS|5.0|Good game, at first it is hard to get once you figure out how to move around it gets better. The game works great on my Huawei m886.

B008RJ6TTC|5.0|Purchased for my grandmother, the price is great and she loves it.  My only gripe is, the description does not indicate all tv movies are included in this box set, I ended up purchasing two dvds for the mystery movie collection, but was able to return them because of amazon's great return policy!  So, DO NOT purchase the mystery movie collection dvds in addition, they ARE INCLUDED.
B00BZODDYU|4.0|What caught my attention about Mama was Del Toro's name. I find that anything he touches is dripping with atmosphere and style, and Mama is no exception. While Del Toro did not direct, he produced and evidently had a hand in creating Mama's atmosphere and characters. The film is dripping with his whimsically dark style and spooky but never ultra-violent imagery. It does carry a PG-13 rating which may turn away some horror movie regulars, and I am more than guilty of dismissing many potentially good horror movies simply because they're not rated R. But because I have been pleased with all of Del Toro's productions, in particular \\"Don't Be Afraid of the Dark\\", and \\"Pan's Labyrinth\\", I decided to give Mama's teen-friendly proposal a chance. Overall, I thought Mama was fantastic! Sometimes blood and guts get old and I'm rather tired of all the slop that's been released lately. What Mama does so well is it frightens and tells its story without needing hardcore gore and mature themes. Most importantly though, it doesn't make you wish it had those things because it engages you in the likable characters and interesting story first and foremost. There are some genuinely creepy moments in the film. Mama also does something remarkable for a modern horror movie: it doesn't assume you will settle for stupid jump scares or ghost in the mirror crap or brain-dead characters. When Mama scares, it lets you know it's coming, and then allows you to enjoy what it has to offer, rather than force you to cling to your chair until something jumps out and makes you scream, only to have you curse it for its predictability. The only thing I have to complain about is the use of CGI. I am old-school in that I find make-up and mechanical effects much more believable because they fit into a film and don't stick out like they're not supposed to be there. Mama has CGI, and while it is not overdone, and certainly is not bad, it sticks out against the non-CGI scenery and characters at times, taking from the otherwise wonderfully creepy atmosphere. Overall, Mama is a great film for those of you horror fans willing to take the PG-13 plunge.om the otherwise wonderfully creepy atmosphere. Overall, Mama is a great film for those of you horror fans willing to take the PG-13 plunge.

B004ZN9W5M|5.0|Pink Floyd's 1979 magnum opus, The Wall is the aural equivalent of one man's descent into sheer madness. Another Brick In The Wall is probably their most well known song (Yep, I remember when i was a kid and radio was eclectic and still relevant in correlation to music as 'art' versus music as 'hype' and 'commerce', which unfortunately is the sad state of affairs in today's entertainment and mainstream media). \\"Another Brick\\" is not by far the only great song, in fact, it's great cover to cover, all killer and no filler.

B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I enjoyed this game, it's the first one likes this that I've played. I thought the graphics were impressive, I just wish it lasted longer! I recommend it and will be looking for more like it!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I love the game but wish I could either get more daily credits or that it could be easier to get the puzzle pieces required to complete a room.
B0088X7YMS|4.0|This is a CG movie with a lot of action and no human interface. I have to admit this is one of the better I have viewed.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|This game is fun there's no doubt. for me it only takes like one round for me to get bored.
B000TQ0EIS|5.0|I am very happy with purchase. I have the CD put wanted it on my Kindle fire. I would recommend
B008G8SFGO|5.0|First off, let me say that I love this album. It is truly deserving of the 5-star rating I've given it, despite it's one (some might say major) flaw... There isn't a single track that could be classified as an instant classic, KISS or otherwise. Dressed to Kill had Rock and Roll All Nite, Destroyer had Beth & Detroit Rock City, while Animalize had Heaven's on Fire. Monster, although being an absolutely superb album, has nothing akin to any of these tracks. In that sense, one could say that Monster is an album made up entirely of filler. The thing is, in saying that, one would be dead wrong. While there may not be a new Lick It Up, an I Love it Loud, a Modern Day Delilah, or even an I was Made for Lovin' You, there is an entire album of the type of songs that Kiss fans treasure. What Monster has, is a track listing entirely filled with numbers equal in caliber to ones like Cold Gin, Calling Dr. Love, Nothin' to Lose and I Stole Your Love. In fact, every track is so good, I would go so far as to say that Monster just may very well be KISS' best overall album, ever. I've been a die-hard fan since 1975, and every studio album has always had at least one track that I routinely skip over. That is until now. Despite lacking any new KISS classics, there is not one skip-able song on this album. I listen to Monster in full, every time I play it... And that is where this album's true beauty lies.<br /><br />Monster probably doesn't have any tracks that will convert the non KISS fan, but it does have an arsenal of songs aimed squarely at those who long for KISS at their non-mainstream best.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|I bought this  ($2.99 + ,26 tax) for my Kindle after seeing it on my daughter's. Love the way its physics is true. It's basically eat or be eaten. You need to figure out the best way to move to win. It lets you know when you are far enough ahead and can't lose by announcing  you've won but lets you continue to wipe out everything if you want. It gets harder quickly forcing you to come up with new strategies to win.
0374533571|5.0|This book definitely kept my attention.  It was rather difficult to put it down.  If you haven't seen the movie yet, it's a great read before you watch (or even if you have already).  Really good read!
B00991TCOG|5.0|I discovered this artist by accident- she came up on one of my Pandora stations. Her music is simply excellent. A lot of epic feel, with a decidedly techno voice and of course it is all violin. It may sound weird but it's actually really cool and I love to listen to it while I write.
B00364K6YW|5.0|Colin Firth played Darcy exactly how I read him in the book.  He was prideful and conceited, & terribly arrogant early on.  It is why Liizzy so easily believed Wickham's lies.  Other versions of this great book downplay this aspect of Darcy and concentrate on Lizzy.  It is the interaction, how both felt and believed about the other that makes this version so outstanding.  I loved the small details, such as how Darcy and Mr. Bennet care for their coat tails but the newer monied Mr. Bingley sits on them.  In the final scene, the difference in their incomes show up.  Darcy with a nicer carriage and 4 horses; Bingley slightly smaller and 2 horses.  My only complaint, a very small one, was seeing the credits after every segment.  I also wished that in the 2nd proposal scene I could have seen both faces on the screen at once.  This version gave a very clear picture of Every character and I loved that.  It was restored beautiully.  I would recommend this to anyone who loves the book.  Best version ever.
B004DLPXAO|2.0|I downloaded 4 different books and can't find them anywhere on my tablet. I received emails from Amazon verifying that the books has been downloaded, but they have yet to be found. It's frustrating.
B008JFUO4U|4.0|Not a Tom Cruise fan but took a chance as trailers appeared interesting enough for perhaps some popcorn and big screen. WELL, much better than I expected in all dimensions: special effects great and all through the movie and not just in spots here and there; plot was decent with enough clues to make you wonder what was going on under the surface; acting was ok, even Cruise. Overall I liked it. Do wish there had been a 3D version of this. Date movie? Yes. Spousal unit movie? Yes, because limited graphic violence and language. Even some love story for the ladies BUT not enough to kill the action for the men. Wide screen required?? I think this is one of those movies best enjoyed on a movie theater screen. I will rent it for home viewing when it comes out just for the action. Recommend.
B000URDCC6|5.0|My 12 year old loves this movie. It's a classic.  It has a great story and no foul language or nudity.  This movie encourages her love of music and acting.
B001KX50BK|5.0|Wonderful movie, beautiful in blu ray.  Great digital restoration.  Julia Roberts and Gere are a class act.  Great buy, excellent purchase!
0385349947|2.0|I am on page 17 of Lean In and already I want to vomit. I will be returning this book to the library and not finishing it. I am 54 and remember the bra-burning Women's Liberation Movement of the 1970s. In her book, Sandberg is pushing the same message that burned out an entire generation of women. That is, women can have it all.<br /><br />Her book begins by talking about the number of younger women who achieve a high level of education and then drop out to raise children as if they have been condemned. The fact is, we are not all equal, but instead of pressuring women to achieve just like me, Sandberg should acknowledge that not every woman can handle running Google and Facebook and being a mom. I honestly think that the Mormons have a better picture of what is good for women. They at least exalt the role of women as mothers and take on the responsibility of providing for their families. It is a tough job to be a mom, no one can replace her, and it isn't fair of Sandberg to suggest that women should be or be treated equally in terms of their career just because she is able to juggle both.<br /><br />Please quit acting like the role of motherhood isn't enough. Mothers have shaped the world.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Plot quickly reels you in and become emersed in what lies ahead for Katniss Everdeen.  Recommend to anyone seeking a read in the dystopia realm.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This app is awesome pick different lands and a lot of items<br /><br />It is awesome pick a world and a lot of items it's worth money get it now.<br /><br />Also play online with other players around you
B006M4RN3U|5.0|CD was factory sealed never opened. Case was in great condition. CD was in good condition played great. No problems.
B004LWZWC4|4.0|I loved everyone in this.  Jack Black makes me wish I was his friend.  I'm not really into birding by any stretch but this film makes me appreciate it.  I'm sure hardcore birders have their gripes but I watched this for entertainment's sake with the bonus hope of learning a little something new and I walked away very happy - to the point I bought the film, which I don't do normally.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I like that it is easy to use both with the adaptor or linking to my computer and makes recharging my Kindle easy.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|This is my first match 3 game; I haven't finished it yet, but I'm already hooked on it. It's not difficult but offers some challenges. IT IS WORTH THE MONEY, no doubts about it.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Very fun. I find that the touch feature is easier than tilt. Great stress reliever. Easy to play. I love this game.
B00C83QYIE|2.0|This is just another excuse for her fans to run out with money to burn, to get a copy of a cd just for 2 other songs, which can be downloaded on the net, from places with ease. You just have to look.<br /><br />The worst is that the booklet remains the same throughout all the versions, and the photoshop artist did a really good job on her flawless skin.<br />Thanks to botox and the highest quality photo-retouching software on the market today.<br /><br />If the item were to at least be packaged in a really lush box or something, i could understand, but the only change is the damned \\"TARGET\\" sticker on the front........just so  that people can flash their copy on the net and to their friends.<br />This is getting so f-ing old and tired and I wish it would stop.<br />At least if it were good music, I could understand, but this is a less than mediocre album and the 2 bonus tracks are less than mediocre TOO!<br /><br />I think they're releasing all these versions just so that people will go out and buy it and show off their huge collection of the Dreamchaser and Dreamchaser-related music, sadly to say it's an f-ing waste of money!<br />So many versions of something really cheap, boring and just not good enough to even gain an overall 4-star review average on amazon.<br /><br />Whenever sarah says jump, they all jump, ready to hand out money to her, for her records. It's just damned ridiculous!!!
B002ZG994U|5.0|Wow! Thats all i have to say! Just wow! This movie was fabulous! I love it! Ive seen it at least ten times and didnt leave my house for a week because all i was doing was watching this amazing movie! I dont know why everyone doesnt own this show! It just tickles me every time i watch it! it is such a great movie that i would go as far as to say it is the best show i have ever seen! This needs more than three thumbs up, it needs at least ten! Wow, just amazing! Wow!
B004MC8CA2|1.0|Can't access a certain chapter and verse. Need to go to the index and turn page to desired section. Really wish you had a bible  where I can type in book, chapter, and verse and it would take me there.
B008C20TDG|5.0|This book explains cravings in a way that makes so much sense, I cannot believe that it isn't being taught in schools!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. I play it all the time with my cousins and we compete to get the highest score. I would highly recommend this game to someone hlwho is looking for fun games.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This product really delivers. Other battery apps say they're the best? I don't think so. This really tells you your battery levels, average usage, and you could set it up to give you a voice indicator on how much battery you have left, or what level your battery is on when charging. I really enjoy this app. No joke.
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|the game is awesome but not enough time<br />please add more time so I can at least build the biggest<br />mansion
B0074MTTEK|5.0|Excellent explanation of this expanding area. Enough detail to be illuminating, but not overwhelming. A book that I will read again.
B001I45UFC|5.0|I really liked it! This book is really awesome. I tell you this book is very inspiring and I love it.
1419705849|5.0|I wish I had a series like this when I was a kid, helps them read and have fun. Great product.
B00B69UQEO|3.0|Depeche Mode returns to his dark sound of ultra, with some guitars like sounds of faith and devotion... the fact is that this cd is in the bottom of their complete musical history
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I feel so fortunate to have this as part of my collection.  I grew up with Star Wars and most kids now a days have and I just never seem to tire of the films.  They never get old to me. Priceless on Bluray and some nice additional bonus stuff. Great Value, Great Price, A true five star.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|Great movie! Love being able to watch it in 3D at home. We saw this movie at the theater in 3D and I think it's even better at home. The 3D is better quality than the theater 3D. My son loves and never gets board watching it. He watches it all the time. I think I know the movie by heart...lol Great! A+ all the way!
B001CEE1YE|5.0|How could this not be awesome and if the Matrix is not your type of film then keep it moving.  However, if you love the films as much as I do there is no reason not to buy this set.  Very pleased.
B009AMAGQM|1.0|I rarely hate a movie, but this was one of the worst movies i've seen in a long time!  It was unwatchable and had no point...don't waste your time!
B0007X9TLQ|5.0|What is not to love Mariah Carey, not only that but this album is awesome and is on vinyl, come on!
B001FES0IE|5.0|Bought for my Husband. It was of good Quality and came as stated. In the plastic- Very cool. Loved it.
0756686970|5.0|My son loves Lego Star Wars and this book is one he can't put down.  Just being able to see the different characters and their descriptions keeps him busy.  Great book!
B002E2M3KM|5.0|Bought for my Husband. It was of good Quality and came as stated. In the plastic- Very cool. Loved it.
B007THA4FI|4.0|The story kept my interest. The characters were interesting people. It's not exactly a blockbuster storyline, but it was ok.
0345803485|5.0|I read this series earlier, and now that I've started on it again, I've become a convert...this is one I will keep to re-read.
B005ZO6NRA|4.0|This was a good movie with decent action. I liked the original with Arnold better, but this one was decent entertainment
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I love this game it is so fun it isn't hard and it is the best game ever so so cute
B005H9B44A|4.0|This movie was good, not the best I have ever seen. It is another shot to bring the comics to the big screen.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I watch every episode twice.  I just finished season 3 and feel that the entire cast is family.  I will miss all of them and can't wait for season 4.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think that this game is for both children and adults. whether or not you are young or old you can enjoy this game.
B0041OOJNU|4.0|I like some of Shakira music, not all.  Latin music is one of favorite selection to play at home especially when I clean house, or excerse.  The beat makes you want to dance the whole day away.
B002VWNIEA|3.0|I like a lot of Denzel Washington's movies. This is not one of his better &#34;tough guy&#34; roles. I was a little disappointed...
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|looks good maybe I will balance  my check book now. thank you for this free app. I even know how to use it.___
B001AITGWE|4.0|Anybody that has seen a lot of Michael Douglas movies should realize in this movie, that he can really play just about any role...
B00C1BV9Z6|5.0|A Classic in HD and 5.1 surround.  I probably saw this movie a dozen times before the age of 13, it was great to see it again in HD audio and video.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|Good read, but this certainly was not the \\"Bones\\" I was expecting. Guess the tv show wasn't 100 percent to the book. But still a good story.
B00A7CF1QY|5.0|One of the best Bournes, maybe the best one of the bunch.  I'm looking forward to the next Bourne with Jeremy Renner.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|This episode was great! I am reading the books now, so I will wait to watch the rest of them. Pretty close to the book, of course the book is always better as there is more detail. I will get these once I am done reading the series.
B007G5K066|5.0|A thrilling Cold War story written by one of the great cold way spy thriller writers of all time.  The move does the book justice, excellent cast.  Thrilling to the very end.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved it she was so strong and very very  extremely brave  I really love this series it really touched my heart
B00BF123WG|2.0|O dark 30 was a real snooze fest, loooong, slow, and boring with a few exciting moments, especially the raid at the end.  I have read alot of the articles and books out there about the hunt for OBL and the raid and many aspects of the story are extremely accurate.  SPOILER ALERT:  Bin Laden dies at the end.
B004SGWYW4|5.0|Ok, so this show is really good (not as good as Soul Eater, but it's still really good).  Not much to say is it's about a zombie outbreak, and some high school students and a faculty member trying to survive, find their loved ones, and most importantly: survive.  There's also some funny moments in the show (gotta have some comic relief).  The only problem is the constant gratuitous tits n' ass shots, which, to be honest, are pretty good, but it gets so tiresome, and they often do it for no reason (episode six is the best example of both of my thoughts).  I do recommend this show, though.  Check it out.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|The entire first season is awesome except the last episode.  The second to last episode of the season provides the plot resolution, but not entirely.  The last episode is supposed to provide closure, but instead sets up the second season by taking a strange disappointing turn.  I can see this series withering away the like the shoe LOST on ABC did.
B008PWUTJC|5.0|Perfect fit for Kindle Paperwhite. Protects from damage to Kindle either naked or with a skin on. I didn't want a bulky case for travel because I like how lightweight the Paperwhite feels without a fancy case. Paired this black sleeve with a carbon fiber skin by Armorshield. I think it looks as tough and masculine as an e-reader can look.
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|Thought this was going to be a kids movie, but in fact it was probably more for adults than children.
B001NHZ2KW|5.0|Its great to see the restored version of the Rockumentary. I had the VHS and purchased this to replace my failing copy. With the bonuses without a doubt a great addition to a collection of Who in their prime.
B003UBTX72|5.0|Keef is a surprisingly great writer, incredibly candid.  Great read from beginning to end, Keef has led a fascinating life.  He provides alot of insight in to the Stones throughout the 60's 70's and 80's.  I can't believe he is still alive.
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|If there was a way to give this game less than 1 star I would.<br />At first I really enjoyed playing this game, it was awesome, agreed with all the great comments.<br />Then disaster struck -- on two separate devices.<br />On my Android at first I could not purchase Gems. Then it would not load.<br />When I tried updating, it told me the game was not installed through Amazon AppStore. Amazon is the only appstore I use.  Had to uninstall and reinstall losing all of my progress and in-app purchases.  I blamed it on the device.  Now disaster has struck on my Kindle fire.  The game does does not load. It starts then goes to the home screen.  Conclusion -- it is the game itself.  Interestingly enough, in each case I was/am at the point where I have almost all of the dragons, at least 4 parks, breeding island, etc.  And when I researched it online -- it seems others are also having problems with glitches in this game after playing for awhile. So player beware -- be prepared to lose everything.  If you still want to play, because it is fun until you lose it all, at least save your money and do not buy any gems!
B002WNC5BU|5.0|If you are a fan of real rock music and it' history you will love this book too.  Fascinating insight into three of the most important musicians in rock history.
B005DJREJS|5.0|very enjoyable, great cast.. i was able to watch both seasons 1 and 2 before season 3 started and have enjoyed watching season 3 in real time!!
B008CP92ZO|4.0|Paul Rudd and Jeniffer Aniston are great in this movie.  Funny story, funny acting, was a movie my wife and I could agree on ;)
B009PK9SB8|4.0|This makes using your hero 3 so much easier.  You can change camera settings or functions with a gui touchscreen menu vs. using the two buttons on the camera.  Watch video and check out pictures without uploading to a computer.  Only problem it drains the battery fast
0151009554|4.0|I'm still not sure if a good portion of the first half of the book was entirely necessary, but this novel is wonderfully written, genuinely haunting and contains one of the heartbreaking sequences ever written. My brother's life changed after reading this book, and while I can't say it's done the same for me, it surely has been something worth experiencing.
0375842209|2.0|The writing was riddled with pretentious affectations. The author was straining self-consciously to cram in as much transcendent, awe-inspiring Meaning -with a capital M - as possible in way which seemed cynical and forced. Did tell a decent story, and I did finish the book, so I can't say it lacked any redeeming qualities at all. Enjoyed parts of it. Just doesn't justify the hype though.
B002VWNIAY|5.0|Received quickly and as described.  Very happy with this dvd.  It is such an incredible classic and way before its time.  I would highly recommend for those Saturday night movie nights with a big bowl of popcorn!
B004EBT5CU|4.0|Although I have trouble connecting or feeling excited about some of the pieces, Adele's incredible voice and passion keep me coming back again and again. Very, very good music that showcases one of the best vocalists I've heard in a long time.
B000HWZ4A2|4.0|Much better than the mess they've made of Atlas Shrugged lately. The obvious issues are clear to any liberty minded person but this isn't a bad way to introduce some ideas to the statist sheep.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|All my friends insisted that I watch this. Because we were still on dialup, I was delighted to find it for sale online in DVD form. If you're a sci-fi or comic book fan and you haven't seen this, I may have to ask you to hand over your geek card. A must-watch.
B00CATSONE|3.0|I think the book does not gives what the title promises. It's a very short and non deep enough biography, more focused on letting you know that you can be a genius, with no real examples or actions to do it. It tries to use Tesla's biography to justify his theories but to be honest the review if Tesla's life is far away from really studied or known.<br />For a little information on Tesla, to maybe get you curious and go buy a real biography, for the rest, non worthy.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|It came a day before the schedule shipment and  the movies worked. I love planet earth it's a well made movie, the time lapse were my fav. Part of the movie...I  recommend this movie and the kids loved them
B004G5ZY7E|4.0|As expected, if you have read Nesbo before he will give you a great police book, with all the components of mystery, murder, personal drama and achievement.<br />If you know Nesbo go read it, you will love it, if you haven't I will recommend to start in one of his first Harry Hole novels so you don't feel too lost.
0553106635|5.0|Book was in Great Condition!  I ordered it because I had worn my initial set out<br />by loaning my books to friends.  :-)
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|This book is typical Dan Brown, it will not disappoint you. If you are his fan you will love it, if you are just approaching it you will enjoy its reading.<br />Dan Brown books are extremely enjoyable, very well articulated and definitely fun to read.
0553108034|5.0|The &#34;quality&#34; of this used hard-back book is excellent. I have already read all<br />available books for this series, just needed a few *new or better Quality hardcovers<br />due to damage from loaning them out.
B000FA675C|5.0|OMG BEST BOOK EVER. But if you liked this than it is a piece of junk compared to Angels and Demons. But still this book is sooooo AMAZING it is just mind blowing I LOVE it.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|What can I say .. it's George R.R. Martin!! They're doing a Great job with this Series. If you don't have a Blu-Ray<br />Player, check to see if your computer will accommodate it, as they have Extras (I'm told) that the DVDs do not. Push<br />come to shove, watch the Extras on YouTube. :-)
B008N1V11U|5.0|This is the best game in the world I wish games could be more like this but unfortunately that doesn't happen but this game is 2 thumbs waaaaaaaayyyyyyyy up.
0553103547|5.0|I purchased this used hardback as replacement for a Set that I keep loaning out that is getting worn. Excellent condition as the seller advertised. I'm pleased. :-)
B0094BB4TW|3.0|It works really well for about 3 weeks, and then it stops letting me &#34;like&#34; things and tag friends. I have to delete it and reinstall in order for it to work again. Very frustrating. Please fix.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|My wife and I  love this program and can't wait for season four. It is very well done, and the characters are great!!!
B0051CSI0G|4.0|The secret of any good apocalyptic film is about making a global event feel like a personal one.  In the case of \\"Stake Land,\\" it's about what each character has to lose.<br /><br />At stake for Mister (Nick Damici) is the survival of his young ward, Martin (Connor Paolo). At stake for Belle (Danielle Harris) is the birth of her child in a hostile world.  At stake for Jebedia Loven (Michael Cerveris) is his fanatical faith, a position diametrically posed to the kind-hearted nun Sister (Kelly McGillis).  Everyone has something to lose in a world roiled by a vampire plague, where rapists, murderers, and human apathy are as much a threat as the blood-sucking hordes.<br /><br />And so Mister and Martin make their way, collecting vampire fangs as currency, with Mister teaching his apprentice how to effectively kill the monsters.  They work best as a pair, but Mister has his own personal code that causes him to immediately murder two rapists -- which will have serious repercussions later.<br /><br />What \\"Stake Land\\" does best is not focus on the vampires (basically, sun-fearing zombies), but on the ragtag family that forms around Mister and Martin.  As each survivor slowly succumbs to the cruel world, Mister begins to consider what his goals really are.  New Eden, a place that may or may not exist, comes to represent that future.  In a world chock full of vampires, when can a vampire hunter truly be at peace?<br /><br />Mister's evolution: as protector, as guardian, and finally as parent, leaves him with only one answer.  To \\"Stake Land's\\" credit, it doesn't give us neatly wrapped endings but instead leaves us with hope.  In the end, all Mister can trust in is that the next generation will learn from the mistakes of the past -- the hope of every weary adult that ever looks upon our current state of affairs in despair.
B007REV4T8|5.0|this is a great movie not your typical techie bond more old school ir retro look. a bit drawn out but very entertaining
B007I1Q4W2|3.0|In a world stuffed to the eyeballs with zombie films, the horror genre continues to explore new ideas with zombies merely a backdrop for good storytelling.  In \\"Exit Humanity,\\" an atmospheric meditation on being a parent in post-Civil War America, the zombies are just another hazard in a dangerous world.<br /><br />Narrator Brian Cox shares the story of Edward Young (Mark Gibson), a soldier of the South who loses his wife and son to the zombie outbreak.  Distraught, he plays with his life in a game of Russian roulette, only to decide on a new course of action: Young will spread his son's ashes at a scenic waterfall he promised to take him to.<br /><br />With this singular goal in mind, Young sets out across a blasted countryside, facing down zombies and looters before he meets a fellow survivor Isaac (Adam Seybold), who has a nobler cause in mind.  Isaac's sister Emma (Jordan Hayes) has been kidnapped by the mad general Williams (Bill Moseley), who is hell bent on finding a cure to the zombie plague. Williams is convinced he can find someone who is immune to the zombie plague and thereby create a cure.<br /><br />There's a bit of a logic leap in this plot twist: it's never made clear why Williams would think a cure is feasible and why such a cure would be found in a person instead of say, a flower or a medicine man's poultice.  But once the basic nature of the plot is set up we know that any hope of a cure is most assuredly tied up in Isaac's quest to rescue his sister.<br /><br />The movie is told in chapter format, as written down by Young in his journal.  The beginning narrative implies that a zombie plague has returned but never addresses what's happening in the present -- it's besides the point.  Instead, we're treated to beautiful sketches that bridge each scene, skipping ahead to propel the narrative.  Unfortunately this doesn't happen nearly enough, and there are interminable sequences where not much happens.  Youngs spends a lot of time roaring into the wind.<br /><br />There's not a lot of twists in the ending.  The beauty of a well-crafted zombie film is that it's about people first, zombie second, and \\"Exit Humanity\\" is no different.  But it's a little too plodding, a little too meandering a little too self-absorbed with its heavy themes of forgiveness and rebirth, to be really be entertaining.  \\"Exit Humanity\\" is a bit of a snooze at times and that's a shame, because it's cinematography is beautiful enough to take time to drink in.  I just wish it was a little shorter.d.<br /><br />There's not a lot of twists in the ending.  The beauty of a well-crafted zombie film is that it's about people first, zombie second, and \\"Exit Humanity\\" is no different.  But it's a little too plodding, a little too meandering a little too self-absorbed with its heavy themes of forgiveness and rebirth, to be really be entertaining.  \\"Exit Humanity\\" is a bit of a snooze at times and that's a shame, because it's cinematography is beautiful enough to take time to drink in.  I just wish it was a little shorter.
B001DJ7PR8|5.0|A light-hearted romp which has wonderful acting and includes the beginning of a real-life romance between Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz!
B008JFUO4U|4.0|\\"Oblivion\\" is a sweeping sci-fi epic that, because it stars Tom Cruise, elevates its deeply personal material to a level of expectations few films can realistically achieve.  With a title like \\"Oblivion\\" it's challenging to ignore the baggage Cruise brings to the role.  The film seems to ask: What does it take to obliterate Tom Cruise?<br /><br />The setting is, like \\"Star Wars,\\" entirely subservient to the characters - nothing happens in the world that isn't connected to the relationships on screen, which means there's little back story provided if it doesn't serve the plot. But whereas \\"Star Wars\\" could stretch some logical elements with it's sci-fi/fantasy setting, \\"Oblivion\\" has all the trappings of hard sci-fi, which invites stronger scrutiny.  Unfortunately the setting doesn't hold up under closer examination.<br /><br />The year is 2077, and Cruise plays yet another Jack, Jack Harper, Tech 49.  He and his lover and coworker Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) are the only two humans left on Tower 49 in what used to be New York City on what used to be Earth, destroyed 60 years before in a war with the alien Scavs.  With Victoria at the Tower and Jack in the field, they work to repair the spherical drones, ED209-inspired robots that move lightning fast and are armed to the teeth.  The drones keep the Hydrorigs safe, giant upside down pyramids that suck up the ocean and eventually send the water to the mother ship called the Tet.  Victoria looks forward to finishing their mission in two weeks and returning to the relocated home of humanity on Titan. Jack isn't so sure, and as his back story is revealed it turns out he's a lot more like Cruise himself.<br /><br />But as the trailers blatantly give away, the Scavs aren't whom they appear to be.  Most incongruous is the fact that Jack and Victoria have their minds wiped \\"for security reasons.\\" Being in the New York sector triggers memories for Jack, and he is haunted by dreams of Julia (Olga Kurylenko) whom he met at the Empire State Building.  When he finds out Julia's real, everything changes.<br /><br />\\"Oblivion\\" drips with symbolism.  It's easy to get wrapped up in the highly stylized visuals of the drones, or the dragonfly like ship Jack flies, or the perpetual dawn that suffuses every frame. But the crux of the story revolves around the Tet - a relationship between three points. The Tet is a physical object - a tetrahedron or four-sided die as gamers know it - and that design is also part of the Hydrorigs.  Point upward the tetrahedron is a pyramid that inspires, builds and ascends.  Facing downwards, it's threatening, ominous, dagger-like.  Visually, we know something is wrong with the Tet just by its appearance.<br /><br />There's more symbolic Tets too.  The delicate balance between Jack - distant, distracted, pining for former Earth - and Julia - clingy, needy, her eyes perpetually dilated in adoration of her man - is turned into a three-point tetrahedron with the arrival of Julia, who has a much more substantial connection to Jack. The Tet becomes a wedge between them, driving them apart with the past even as it connects them together by a shared tragedy in the present.<br /><br />The Tet is also short for \\"teth,\\" the ninth letter in gematria that spells the name of God in the Tetragrammaton. It is the building block of man's comprehension of the divine, and Jack's relationship with the rest of humanity and the alien invaders pivots on unmasking false gods.<br /><br />This is not a film that will advance women's rights.  Every female character is subservient to Jack, and he is undoubtedly the top of the tetrahedron.  But both women act as his foundation (if only in a deeply-gendered role of lover) and when they are removed he falls with them.<br /><br />\\"Oblivion\\" has enough twists to play with viewers' expectations, but each twist begs more questions with few answers.  This doesn't necessarily detract from the enjoyment of the film's central tenets, but it can distractanyone expecting sci-fi world-building instead of a three-act play.<br /><br />Despite Cruise' involvement, the film is a thought-provoking if occasionally frustrating tale about what it means to obliterate oneself. What does it take to obliterate a towering presence like Cruise? \\"Oblivion's\\" answer is more of him.anyone expecting sci-fi world-building instead of a three-act play.<br /><br />Despite Cruise' involvement, the film is a thought-provoking if occasionally frustrating tale about what it means to obliterate oneself.

B003VKW14Y|5.0|One of the great cellists of the past and present centuries has died. Janos Starker was born in Budapest on July 5, 1924  and died April 27, 2013. As a young man he was the principal cellist of the Budapest Opera and the Budapest Philharmonic. The Starkers were Jews. Near the end of World War II, Starker and his parents were sent to an internment camp on an island in the Danube outside Budapest. All three survived the war. After the war, Starker worked as an electrician and a sulfur miner before making his way to Paris. There, in 1947, he recorded the Kodaly sonata; that recording won the Grand Prix du Disque, France's most prestigious award for recorded music, bringing him international fame. In 1948, Janos Starker was brought to the United States as the principal cellist of the Dallas Symphony by its music director, Antal Dorati. Afterward, he was principal cellist of the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra in New York and was later principal cellist of the Chicago Symphony. The rest is history: for many both in audiences and among critics he was one of the triumvirate that included Gregor Piatigorsky (1903-76) and Mstislav Rostropovich (1927-2007). Unlike many world-renowned musicians, Starker made teaching a major facet of his career. In 1958 he joined the faculty of what is now the Jacobs School of Music at Indiana University, where he taught until shortly before his death.<br /><br />The consensus as far as his musicality was that the chief hallmark of his playing was a conspicuous lack of schmaltz. Effusive sentiment is an inherent risk of the cello, with its thundering sonorities and timbre so like the human voice. He also shunned the dramatic head tossing and body swaying to which many cellists incline. Unlike many acclaimed string players, Starker used a lean, judicious vibrato -- the minute, rapid variations in pitch by the left hand that can enrich a note's sound but can also border on the histrionic. Excessive vibrato, he said, was like \\"a woman smearing her whole face with lipstick.\\"<br /><br />While the musical style that resulted was too dispassionate for some critics' taste, others praised Mr. Starker's faultless technique; purity of tone; clean, polished phrasing; and acute concern with the composer's intent. \\"The technical aspects of Mr. Starker's playing are so wholly merged in the solution to problems of interpretation and style that the listener tends to forget how much technical mastery the cellist has achieved,\\" Raymond Ericson wrote in The New York Times in 1962, reviewing a recital at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. \\"The pitch is unerringly right, the tone is mellow without being mushy, difficult leaps and runs are manipulated with the easy unobtrusiveness of a magician.\\"<br /><br />This recording of the Bach Cello Suites is as fine a testimony to his particular gifts and his approach to musical scores.  It is a treasure and one that will be referenced by many in years to come. Janos Starker was supremely musical.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|Great read!  I firmly believe that God allowed this doctor to experience and reveal his findings to others.  I loved how he discovered how science and faith go hand in hand!  There is no conflict betweent the two.  Very encouraging and enjoyable read.
0439023513|5.0|I could not put this book down as was true of the Hunger Games and Catching Fire.<br />the author writes a book which holds you spellbound
B00BSBXZDY|2.0|tried to stream this in HD and hit bandwidth issues, had to watch the majority in Loser Definition...<br />good movie, loved the clarity of the HD when It was HD. two stars for charging me for HD but delivering in LD.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Great game. Fun to play even if you don't spend money. I like that it is a never-ending game. I'm a big fan of hidden object games and so far this is the best one yet.
B00A18KCSQ|5.0|got it for my new much younger girlfriend for her bday and wheeeeoooo did she like it, and after having to listen to it incessantly for days, I liked it too.
B000FBJFSC|5.0|[[ASIN:B000FBJFSC Angela's Ashes: A Memoir]]  I have to agree with most everything other reviewers have written, the good and the bad ... the 1-stars through the 5-stars.  It took a few chapters for me to become accustomed to the writing style ... lack of quotation marks, mostly missing commas, and run-on sentences. A few chapters seemed to run a bit long, but overall, this story had me captivated from beginning to end. It can easily evoke tears of poignancy as well as tears of laughter. I would definitely recommend this book, and have given it five stars.
B008E374PO|5.0|I am a fan of Owl City and have the two previous albums. This is different but I love it. The songs do not disappoint,
B0060MYM7O|5.0|If you are a GoT fan, you don't need my review. If you haven't seen this series yet, what are you waiting for?
B001XCWPAM|5.0|Loved the VHS!  Will continue to enjoy the DVDS for years to come!  The Blu-ray is so clear & is easy on the eyes.
B0000AM6IY|5.0|There is none greater than Natalie Wood and Rita Moreno in the amazing movie.  The music is unforgettable and truly classic.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a good game to play with family and friends on a regular little get together for great fun and competition.
B0001CNRBG|5.0|I saw this movie when it originally appeared in the theaters and enjoyed it so much.  What a special movie about growing old with good friends and all the &#34;messy bits&#34; in the middle.
B003R0LBVW|5.0|fine, insightful, cold-blooded, hilarious examination of the power and complexity of family and closest friend relationships.  Stress on the hilarious.  Wonderful sense of the absurd but not totally fanciful.  Not as mind-bending as John Irving, deliberately closer to the edge of plausibility.  Characters are often memorable and sympathetic even when going to their dark sides.
B002HK9IDQ|4.0|A movie I saw as a child - a bit longer than I remembered, but every bit as entertaining.  The music I've heard all my life and can now sing along with.  A must see movie to help one appreciate the person you are inside, not just for the stuff you have.
B00BN3DPQ4|4.0|Arnold Schwarzenegger is back. \\"The Last Stand\\" is the 65-year-old former California governor's first starring vehicle in ten years since \\"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,\\" but the film is also notable as the Korean director Jee-woon Kim's first Hollywood production. This is an unexpected collaboration - a veteran action star meets a cult filmmaker of \\"The Good, the Bad, the Weird\\" and \\"I Saw the Devil\\" - but it works.<br /><br />The story revolves around Ray Owens (Arnold Schwarzenegger), a sheriff of a quiet town of Sommerton, Arizona, and Gabriel Cortez (Eduardo Noriega), an escaped federal prisoner and Mexican drug kingpin. The sheriff (who has \\"seen enough blood and death\\") and a handful of townspeople stand up against the smart and ruthless criminal trying to cross the border, and a group of heavily armed mercenaries.<br /><br />\\"The Last Stand\\" is a modern-day western, with such character actors as Luis Guzmán, Peter Stormare, Johnny Knoxville and Harry Dean Stanton (in an uncredited role) doing what they are supposed to do, and they do it very well. Arnold Schwarzenegger looks old, but he still holds his own.<br /><br />The film has a few shortcomings. It takes some time for the story to get moving, and Forest Whitaker's role as FBI agent doesn't fit well in the story, but once action starts, which is bloody, violent and even darkly funny, the film gets entertaining.<br /><br />Like \\"The Expendables\\" and its sequel, where Arnold Schwarzenegger was briefly seen, \\"The Last Stand\\" is an old-school action movie with a large amount of shootouts and physical fights. And that's pretty enjoyable.
0670451495|5.0|I received this book when my daughter was born (in the70's). I bought this book for my granddaughter with plans to take her to the Boston Public Gardens to bring her on the swan boats and see the bronze statues of &#34;Mother and the Ducklings&#34;.

B004FGMDOQ|5.0|The whole premise of this book was very different and I found it to be very enjoyable. I would recommend it.
B004SRPXWQ|2.0|same as talking james the squirrel...just could not get all of it<br />to work...iam not sure if its me or the game...lol<br />bored and over it
B0081JPTCQ|2.0|I couldn't really understand the purpose of it so just took it off.  I wouldn't recommend this, can't see the need for it.
B005NJU8PA|4.0|Although the title doesn't really speak to what's in the book it is a good read. It does go into cooking but it also adds in learning techniques and survival techniques.
B00632HWOG|3.0|I haven't used it yet so can't really tell you much about it.  In fact I don't remember installing it.
B007HACDLK|4.0|In the Last Man, we see Mitch doing what he does best, chasing bad guys and settling scores. This latest novel feels very current and depicts the complicated situations that can arise after years of war and under the table dealings with bad actors.<br /><br />Good stuff!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|If you've watched and fallen in love with seasons 1 and 2 of Downton, you won't be disappointed with season 3!  All our favorite characters are back with more exciting story lines.  And what an ending!  I highly recommend this series to anyone and can't wait for season 4 to come out.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Very good book very cool<br />A little bit funny and overall very good book<br />Very easy to read so buy it
B000JQU1VS|5.0|great book, from a great writer. Sir Arthur gave life to one of the best inspectors in history. loved this book.
B0007TKNII|5.0|The filming is spectacular as well as the staging.  I would recommend this to anyone and everyone to watch.  It is a terribly poignant story that is very real.  My grandson asked me to buy this for him ... he is seven years old.  I was not at all concerned about a 7 year old watching this film.  It is family friendly and extremely well produced.  I loved the acting and the voices...such talent.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|I have not seen the movie so no comparison here. It was a good Summer Read but nothing spectacular. The female protagonist is like able courageous and sweet. The male protagonist is almost too good to be true. The danger of her husband finding her is real and many women live it everyday.  I think what was missing for me was I like more sex in my love stories. And it was nonexistent in this book.
B0073XORCY|4.0|I've been a Tull fan from the beginning. There are some really good moments on this CD. Ian's voice sounds pretty good compared to what I've heard live. The music and lyrics remind me of  old Tull.
B00A0HQ7H8|5.0|Nice sounding voice and good fun base. Dubstepish but not quite. Being the boyfriend I enjoy as well so if you want to treat your girl to a new artist give her a whirl.
B008CLI3TE|3.0|Having heard a lot about this series I was poised to purchase the first season on blu ray and enjoy it. Yet, in looking at the price of 51.00 for the blu ray only version and the cost of 47.00 for the blu ray/ dvd/ hd download combination... dont think I will be getting it.
B001FB5634|4.0|I really enjoyed the book and I had to see the movie.  I watched the movie with a friend and he was really impressed.  I must say nothing really impress him, thumbs up for me.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is great.  Very entertaining.  Could play it for hours if I had the credits...lol. I would recommend this game to my friends.
B00B2DSK06|3.0|OK, I got into the whole video game nostalgia thing while I was watching it. The first half of the movie was good.  Then after that, to me I just lost interest.  The movie got too &#34;kiddie-fied&#34; the further it went.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Entertaining, fun, and realistic. Really keeps me un-bored. Its enjoyable to feel like you have a horse to fake care of. Especially if you cant afford one or just cant.
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|I bought this because I got hooked watching this show on T.V. Since it is a British show it is hard to find in the States. They don't always have it on T.V. on BBC and like I said it is hard to find.  Now I can watch it whenever I want.
B00004T9VY|5.0|A trip down memory lane every time I listen to it.  If you are a &#34;Cat&#34; fan, this album MUST be in your collection.
B001TH16DI|5.0|Not waiting any longer,for this set,im glad i didnt wait any longer for these babies.Cant wait to get the next set of movies...TNG
B005DJREJS|5.0|As an adult, I sometimes enjoy watching teen comedy...nothing too deep. Awkward took me by surprise, both with it's sharp wit and it's language (ugh). The main character, Jenna, is an easy-to-love geek who is just trying to fit in at her high school. However, when she receives a mysterious letter from &#34;a friend&#34; Jenna redoubles her efforts to fit in, while staying true to herself.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|I love this movie!  The story is cute.  The animation is great.  I was lucky enough to see it in the theater aboard the Disney wonder in 3D!!!  It was awesome!<br />The bonus features on the film are good too.  Cute stuff.<br />I know our future children will enjoy this movie, so I'm glad we have it now!  I love Disney movies!!
B00AIBZJLG|5.0|The imagination of the movie and the colors are amazing, I would of loved to see it on the big screen. I would highly recommend seeing this movie.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I have read a few other near-death-experience books which I found to be totally cheesy and disappointing. This book is very different! It is intelligent, well written, and riveting. It is a page turner and a fascinating account of this doctor's journey into the afterlife while in a week-long coma. It was easy to read, very credible, and I finished it in no time.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I really enjoyed this game and like that it is quick and easy to make money. Most games take forever to build up money.  It would be nice if you could make it so we can buy acorns with the money we made... just a thought.
1609611543|5.0|While I haven't lost any weight to speak of, I fully endorse this book. I have had some changes in bowel habit and general health that seemingly had no particular cause. It was not celiac disease.  I was wrong; it was the wheat that was causing problems. I eliminated the wheat and it eliminated the problem! When you read the why and wherefores of what the real story of wheat is, you will change your shopping habits. I have tried a few of the recipes in the back of the book and they are good. If you are gluten sensitive, this is a good book for you as well. There is also a cookbook that you can purchase  with more recipes.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|You can never go wrong with a Jack Reacher novel and this is no exception. Will he ever get to Virgnia?
B005H29GSI|5.0|My boys have the original Knock on Wood Angry Birds game, so when we saw they had another version, we had to get it. It's the same premise, but has some different features including the ice blocks and pigs with helmets.<br /><br />This set comes with 2 Angry Birds, 3 green pigs, 1 slingshot-style catapult launcher, structure pieces and mission cards. My boys are 8 and 6 and they love this game. You pick a card, set up the blocks and pigs as directed, place your Angry Bird in the launcher and try to knock the structure down. The premise is so simple, yet it's so much fun. The \\"wood\\" beams and snappable \\"ice\\" girders are easy to set up and even though it is tough to launch the birds, it's very addictive.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|This game freezes a lot and parents need to be aware that the game pushes really hard to draw in in-app purchases. Not even worth the space not your kindle in my opinion.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I love all the Vince Flynn novels.  I have a collection.  Sometimes I loan them to my friends. Definitely would recommend his books to everyone.  Just wish our government would stand up to the bad guys like Rapp does
0307594009|5.0|I love the story and I though my granddaughter would like it also.GREAT BOOK FOR ANY TEEN OR ADULT TO READ.
B00BQ1DATU|4.0|Upon the first listening I really liked this album.  Its moving and catchy but not trendy or pop.  RIYL My Morning Jacket, Cocteau Twins,
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|I liked it a lot. A little too long out good. I think there needs to be a fourth. Ironman
B005S9EKCW|5.0|We love this movie and the blu-ray/dvd/digital copy options are great. Extras on the blu-ray you don't get on the DVD too.
B001ECQ4AS|5.0|I have been watching since the 1st episode premiered and I am so glad they released these in Blu-ray! Sending my wife through the series now and she loves it. It's a great escape from shows like american idol and vampire diaries that are all drama. It's a great show that anyone can enjoy because it's got manly things in it as well as the emotional characters and plotlines.<br /><br />You can't go wrong with Supernatural!
B005HSL626|5.0|This is a very good version and runs smoothly without any problems.  This is a safe purchase for your android phone.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|I love this game but it would be better if I could get the same version as the one you get on Facebook. It seems to be a partial app.
B00BW5K5DO|5.0|This is a great game. Very challenging and great graphics. Trying to get gold stars on every level difficult but very fun.
B002M5E2DW|5.0|I had read this book and saw the movie some time ago, then didn't follow through. I am making a concerted effort to follow the teachings in this book and others that I am currently reading and am all ready beginning to see results!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I enjoy using this solidarity app.  It is easy to see without my reading glasses.  It is definitely addicting and lots of fun!
B00CDTSFF8|5.0|WOW - Once I started watching this series, I really got into it.  It starts off a little slow, but that's okay, as this give time for the viewers to really get to know each person in the clan.  The cast is great, the settings are surberp!  The acting is outstanding.  It really does feel like you have been transported back to the time of the Vickings are living with the clan.  The 2nd to last episode really is intense when the clan makes a pilgramage to THOR, their god.  The final episode, well, I am just hoping that season 2 comes out soon.
B003WUYOQ6|3.0|This book could be written in half the pages. It has interesting main points, but the author's use of belaboring a point over and over again, makes his good arguments a bit pedantic.  Poor people are obese not because they are lazy, but because they are largely insulin resistant.  Got it.  Carbs and sugar make you insulin resistant.  Got it.  Obesity can run in generations, making it a nearly impossible cycle to break in poor communities.  Got it.  I eventually got bored and put the book down 3/4 of the way through.
0545265355|5.0|These books are amazing. I recommend them to anyone over 12 (even for adults) who is looking for a good romance book to read and doesn't mind violence. I have read a lot of books in my lifetime but these are the best books that I have read in my whole life. There are three books in this series: The Hunger Games, Catching Fire and Mockingjay. I was hysterically crying for 20 minutes after I finished reading Mockingjay because it was so good. You really should read these books!
B007KUFDBY|5.0|Kind of a cult favorite (not that commercially successful for a Disney film). Based (of course) on Treasure Island, this is an alternative universe and a delightful one. The music is cool, the characters are fun and interesting, and the artwork is beautiful. This blu ray edition is absolutely stunning! One of my favorite scenes starts by looking out a window at the crescent moon, then slowly zooms in. As you get closer, you realize that it's not our moon as it resolves into a crescent space station, and the zoom continues until you get to the ship. An awesome sequence, indicative of the quality of this underrated animated film.
B00AW8UK0K|5.0|This is such an exciting concept and for anyone who has struggled with their weight it could be the answer to their prayers. Offering a new way to approach weight loss that doesn't involve the relentless and monotonous counting of points and calories, this is a life style I could work with long term.
B004FOA84A|5.0|Fire Maple games-the other is Lost City are outstanding adventure games. Just hard enough to be challenging.<br />When will we get another game Fire Maple? Keep up the good work.
B008JFUTUY|5.0|I spent part of my childhood in Detroit, so I can relate. Given the sparse details of the last 36 years in the life of Rodriguez, the film makers did an amazing job of filling in. It made me want to go out and buy both CD's, and I did. This man is a first class poet and his music still makes sense today. I wonder how many more great musical artists in this world remain undiscovered.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|One of the best movies ever made period.if you like action and super heros this is a movie for you
B003ODIZL6|3.0|I discovered a lot about different words. Most of the book I had no clue how to say a lot of words
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Well written, but too fatalistic, too nihilistic. Third book looses some of the strengths found in the first two, feel like it was wriiten too fast to meet a deadline ( i.e., not enough re-reads to work out the plot and action more fully, to soak the movement through it in the sauce that comes from laying it down & looking at it with fresh eyes).  And I saw no logic in Prim being at the Capitol, and only a slight reason for killing her (to cut ties with Gale).
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love this game ive been looking for this game for so long and the grafics and it is so awesome on the ipad.
B007Q4Y9I2|5.0|What can I say about this recording that hasn't already been said. Not sure. Just listening to it for the thousandth time and realized that this is an absolute perfect album and a perfect example of a band at the height of their powers. If you don't own this album, you don't know Emerson Lake and Palmer. Everything is perfect here. Keith is amazing. Palmer is amazing and even though Lake is accused of writing sappy lyrics now and again, he is clearly writing some of the best work of his career here. And the drum solo on Tank.. well, you just have to hear for yourself. If you love music, buy this CD.
B009AMANBA|5.0|I chose it, because the film was well planned and produced, the acting superb, and I was inspired by the film.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|Some incredible songs - Mirrors, Tunnel Vision and others like Don't Hold The Wall.... simply stellar.  Justin T delivers again!

B00B2PO148|5.0|I love Dead Space, and when I saw this I had to get it. And I wasn't in the least disappointed. The art is amazing, and the book/case it came in protects it nicely as well as looks amazing. I can't wait to show this off.

B00127RAJY|5.0|Jillian Micheal's doesn't play around with this workout. I can already tell I am slimming down after doing this workout for the last 2 weeks. The interval workout is PERFECT with those with limited time and maximum will power to workout.
B006ZNRD06|1.0|Very disappointed this is a 7-day free trial. I will accept some of the responsibility and admit I did not read the entire description. After I installed the app, I realized the app was not a fully functional free app. I will say that Amazon, should require vendors to disclose free trials as such, and post the announcement in the \\"price\\" area. Vendors should not be permited to list trials as applications. While I downloaded the app, I removed it immediately after launching.<br /><br />What is telling, is that ABitNo has just as many one-star reviews of the app/trial as all of the other stars combined. As I stated, I should have taken the time to read the description and reviews.<br /><br />Sorry, ABitNo. But you will not get another chance to make a good first impression.

B004W2UBYW|3.0|Interesting read.  I like the 10 dollar price though.  I would recommend downloading this over the real book, it is toooo awkward.
030758836X|1.0|I can't fathom why this book could get such rave reviews. The plot and characters were so dysfunctional that I was literally angry when I finished it. Whenever I see that it is still on the best seller list, I cringe.
B0081336FO|5.0|Excellent show, well streamed. Good acting brings characters to life.  Stories based on original Conan Doyle, but original and interesting.
B0060AY85C|4.0|Leaving Everything Most Loved is another enjoyable book in the Maisie Dobbs series.  I love the character and the style of writing.  I am interested to learn more about Maisie's next phase in her life.<br /><br />Home by Morrison shows depth in the characters and is very thought-provoking.  All of her books are good reads.  Our book club took this one on
B004LWZWGA|5.0|It is a fitting end (if this the end) of a magnificent series. High voltage action. A sometimes poignant story and even a possibly telling back story (Officer Robin). I'm a fan of Hans Zimmer too. And his music fits perfectly, and even can be listened to by itself viz a viz the sound track.
0446556750|5.0|I haven't started it yet but I trust that Michael Connelly will not disappoint me. I'm currently reading his book, &#34;The Drop.&#34;
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Love playing the game and I'm 25. Wish it would update with more content more often. And having to have friends to join you that you already know is quite annoying. You can't finish a couple quests because there's no way to get hearts other then to have friends. I've been playing for 5months now and still haven't finished. Easy way to watch your spending is to wait for a sale on gems.
B0072KZ0Z6|5.0|The writers are hilarious. Each character on this show has a very eccentric personality and traits that bounce off their costars perfectly.

B005LAIH4A|5.0|I bought several copies of this to give as gifts, Kids love this movie and the bright colors work to keep even the youngest's attention. It's a great movie and a great price with lightening speed shipping. You can't go wrong!
B00B2TTVNU|5.0|To start with full disclosure -- I am a rabid fan of Rachmaninoff's compositions for piano and orchestra. I bought Lisitsa's recording after listening to some of her &#34;Rachmaninoff Project&#34; YouTube postings, and I am not disappointed with the finished product. Her Rhapsody rendition is a sheer pleasure, as are the respective second and third movements of Rach II and III. Although her opening movement tempo in both of these works is slightly slower than my comfort level, that is merely a small detail of  taste or opinion which does not significantly diminish the whole. I enjoy having access to a wide variety of recordings of the music I love, and hers rank among my favorites. The best news is that new generations of young artists continue to embrace these works, giving them the long lifespan they so richly deserve.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|Silver Linings Playbook was brilliant. All the cinematic pieces fit together perfectly: the script, the casting, the directing, the acting and so on! I haven't watched a romantic comedy-drama in a while that I enjoyed this much! I will be buying a hard copy to add to my movie collection for sure!

0451197879|4.0|'Roadwork' is an interesting character study by Stephen King (aka Richard Bachman).  The main character is a middle aged suburban husband who simply cannot deal with the notion that a highway is being built right where his house is and where he works (a large scale laundry).  He feels as if his soul is being barreled through by this roadwork.  He starts to disintegrate and gets angry.  VERY angry.  It doesn't end happily.<br /><br />There really isn't anything to smile about in this story.  However I think the author does a superb job in getting the reader into the head of this poor chap.  'Roadwork' is certainly one of the better and most measured (controlled, disciplined) efforts by Stephen King.<br /><br />Bottom line: an unhappy yet unexpectedly rewarding read.  Recommended.
B00BL5EQLC|4.0|I wish there was more levels and more running modes. But it is fun for the most part, if not too simple.

B007VUA7VO|1.0|I had this app for the kindle fire for a long time on my last kindle. like the other 1 stars said, it eats up the battery life. another thing for me is the fact that it messed up my last kindle so bad with all the overheating and the necessary rebooting, that my kindle died completely. the kindle wouldn't turn on,  and when it did, I'd have to charge it for over 12 hours to get it just over 50% battery charge. so I had to get a new kindle. if you don't want this to happen to your kindle fire, DO NOT GET THIS APP! Although, I must say that it actually does tell the exact battery life correctly. Not that that matters if you don't HAVE a kindle after this app destroys it!

B00BQHA06A|5.0|I've been a fan of HIM for going on thirteen years now. The one thing you can count on with this band, is that they don't become over-obsessive with changing their sound or writing recipe. Sure, there are variations in \\"heavyness\\" and production in their albums, but the arrangments are usually the same, as is their songwriting formula. Instead of trying to always sound different, they concentrate their efforts into writing good, solid songs. This is why their albums have staying power. This is why you can go back and listen to any of their albums over and over and usually hear something new that you didn't hear before. Their songs are instantly identifiable and catchy. They have mastered combining heavy guitar rock, romance, pop, and old school into a complex wonderful combination that shouldn't work, but always does.<br /><br />With Tears on Tape, you can hear evidence of their past work and their influences. All member performances are top notch. In time, this album will be considered a classic, much like the others.<br /><br />Best tracks: All Lips Go Blue, Love Without Tears, Into The Night, Hearts At War, Drawn & Quartered.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I was intrigued when I discovered a book narrated by death. The writing is brilliant and unlike anything else that I have ever read.<br />If you are anything like me, you are going to cry. I finished late at night sobbing. What else could you expect from a World War 2 book?<br />But it's worth the tears. This book is beautiful and needs to be read.

0141329998|5.0|Rick Riordan has produced something so exceptional and astonishingly outstanding, that it completely blew me away by its originality and flair. Like nothing I have encountered before I simply love how the author cleverly combines Greek mythology with modern-day, for a truly inspired outcome. The current, contemporary `feel' to this story not only makes history seem cool but which also makes the past feel relevant and very much a part of the present. If you are a teen who is not a particularly alert person in the history classroom, then I urge you to seek out Percy Jackson and discover how exciting it really is!<br /><br />\\"Look I didn't want to be a half-blood. I never asked to be the son of a Greek God...\\"<br /><br />Percy Jackson believes that he is a typical teenager, who also suffers from ADHD and Dyslexia. What Percy doesn't know is that he is actually a Demigod ~ with a human mother and his father is a Greek God (Poseidon). After coming to terms with this new revelation and his abilities (like reading ancient Greek or having quick reactions when fighting off a Minotaur), Percy is taken to a sanctuary for his kind ~ CAMP HALF-BLOOD.<br />Zeus has lost a lightning bolt which he believes that Percy has stolen and which Hades of the Underworld is also anxious to get hold of. With Percy's mother held captive by Hades, he boldly begins on an epic journey with his friends ~ Grover and Annabeth. Percy is tested when he encounters Medusa in her garden of stone statues, when he encounters Hydra's many heads and when he is lured into a trap by the Lotus. With a lot of courage Percy is able to stand-up to evil and shows that true heroism is not without flaws.<br /><br />Exciting and action-packed this thrilling tale is filled with magic, mystery and a lot of death defying danger. This vastly entertaining read was so intensely gripping I was unable to put the book down for even a moment, as I was sucked into this story like I had plunged into a magical portal ~ transported into the fascinating world of Percy Jackson. This inspired creation of pure genius I predict becoming a timeless classic amongst teenagers and school kids. It is unique for Percy Jackson appeals to both boys and girls equally, as it is an impressive adventure/ action story that is well-written and clever.<br />Totally unputdownable and addictive this is a book for readers with vivid imaginations, who are looking for something that is fueled by electric tension, scintillating suspense and memorable, fantastic characters.<br /><br />I simply LOVED it!!<br /><br />*Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief is now a major film*into the fascinating world of Percy Jackson.

B00BSIOOM8|3.0|Bought the 2013 Remaster from Rock Candy because I've always loved this album.  The presence of an extra track sealed the deal and I preordered.  Received the disc today and although the back cover confirms that there is an extra track (#5 - &#34;Cold Harbor&#34;) in actuality, the track IS NOT ON THE CD.<br /><br />Considering this is an import, I would not have paid nearly $20 for this if it had not been advertised as having the extra track.  The remaster is also considerably compressed.<br /><br />Because of these short comings I am docking 2 stars and urging people NOT to buy this based on the them.  Find a used copy - it'll sound better and cost a quarter of the price.  I'll be getting my money back from Amazon if I don't receive a reply to my email to Rock Candy customer service.

B002SSUQFG|5.0|For the price this is a great watch. While the band is a bit petite, it is comfortable. The movement claims Japan, but is actually Malaysian. At this price, who's counting?<br /><br />The dial has great detail, I enjoy the red tipped second hand. The crown has a nice audible chick, but I have serious doubts about it's water resistance; I wouldn't venture beyond splashes. There is a nice weight to it and the display caseback was a nice surprise.<br /><br />Would make a good gift and I would buy again.
006114665X|3.0|This convoluted epic has a premise of interest, but the author is so excited by his wordmanship, it is a difficult read.  I have a Master's degree in History and am well read in WWI history besides touring the American battle sites in France.<br />I found this not worth the time it took to read it.

B00B19GKI0|1.0|this movie is horrible.  luckily, i had the sense to stop half way and not waste more of my time.
B002BU4HWE|1.0|I'm reluctant to write this considering I've only seen the first half-hour of the movie.<br /><br />I was as curious as anyone about this movie which supposedly tanked an entire studio and brought the curtain down on the era of director-driven blockbusters.  I'd heard about it for years, but it was completely unavailable anywhere.  I'd had bad luck before with obscure unrentable movies (see Logan's Run(tm)), so I wasn't about to buy it and risk adding another dud to my DVD collection.  But when the director's cut surfaced last year--and Amazon Instant Video dropped the Prime membership requirement--I was excited to give it a try.<br /><br />That excitement was short-lived.  Within the first two scenes of the movie, a pattern emerged.  I understood instantly why the film's original test audiences hated it.  The first several scenes all focus on Jim Averill's graduation from Harvard in 1870...and each is far too long.  I'm talking orders of magnitude too long.<br /><br />The opening scene has the new graduates march across the campus to \\"The Battle Hymn of the Republic.\\"  The audience only needs a few seconds of this to understand the location, occasion, time period, and important characters, yet we are forced to watch them march across the ENTIRE campus and hear the ENTIRE song.  When the graduates and professors file into the auditorium for the keynote address, we are forced to watch the entire process beginning with an empty room and ending...  Frankly, I don't even know.  We had to sit through the room filling up, the benediction, the opening speaker, and the class orator with no jump cuts.  If Cimino was going for realism, he hit the nail squarely on the head.  It felt like being at a real graduation, all of which are insufferably boring.<br /><br />As if to overcompensate for sitting through all that, Cimino then jump cuts 20 YEARS into Jim Averill's future.  A few scenes into this act, we watch him conversing with various people in the frontier town of Caspar,Wyoming.  I say we \\"watch him converse\\" because we certainly aren't listening to his conversation.  The sound editing is just horrible.  We can hear the train cars being loaded, the horses snorting, wagon wheels creaking, people fighting and shrieking in the streets.  All of the background noise is front and center, while the voices are imperceptible.  Again, if Cimino's goal was to provide the audience with some kind of immersive \\"Old-West\\" experience, he succeeded.  However, since most people who watch movies expect a story to be told, his efforts were a dismal failure.<br /><br />I fought my way through a half-hour's worth of this garbage dialog.  First, I would listen intently, fail, then rewind.  Next, I would strain my ears to make sense of the mumbling, fail, then rewind.  Next, I would ask my girlfriend--whose hearing is better than mine--to explain what was said.  When she explained that she was just as lost as me, I'd rewind.  Finally, I found myself just trying to decipher what was going on from visual context.  At this point I gave up.<br /><br />I really enjoy period Westerns told from a modern perspective.  They don't make a lot of these anymore, so I was excited to find one I hadn't seen.  However, I'm just not destined to ever finish this movie.  I don't like admitting defeat on any front, much less leaving a story untold and mysterious.  However, there comes a time when you just have to admit that your storyteller is no good at storytelling.<br /><br />Take heed, Christopher Nolan.<br /><br />ME.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Enjoyed this Pendergast novel about the mystery of Pendergast's wife.  Can't wait for the next one.  Preston and Child's books are real page turners.
B0042VJ1PI|4.0|I love the Castle series on TV so thought I would buy the book.  It is pretty good.  I read a lot of mystery books and this kept me guessing for a while.  I do get very tired of the PC that is interjected in so many books today.  Just write me a story don't push your political agenda please.

0812982622|5.0|I liked the point(s) of view.  I could experience life from some different perspectives.  The book grabbed me from page one.  At first I thought it must be hyperbole.  No country can do that! Or that!  I put down the book several times because it was so in humane.  Then I read again because I felt I needed to be witness to this.  This book is profoundly moving.  That said, it is not a casual read, a fun read.
B00AESN8XY|3.0|I think that the game give you what you deserve but I think they need some improvements. like more points to grow your desese.
141694737X|3.0|Children learn from predictable fun.  They enjoy knowing which animal will show up next.  They master their environment.  This book is good for young children, ages eight months to two years.  My grandson is two and he also enjoyed it.  However, for his age, it lacked that extra something that would have moved the story to another level of learning.

I found a way to turn on fog to do that you go to options and you will see the word fog click it and you have fog in you game try to find all 8 pages before he kills you<br />  When I was on hard I got 7/8 pages if you can beat that then you are boss at this game he will try to kill you at all times so stay alert<br /><br />Oh and get this game
0525478817|5.0|It's a rare thing to finish reading a book and to feel like you should thank the author. I've felt this several times with Terry Pratchett, on a few occasions with Neil Gaiman, and once or twice with others. I got to feel that and other emotions today, upon finishing John Green's The Fault In Our Stars.<br />Now, let me be perfectly clear: this is a sad book. It is about two kids with cancer who fall in love, and as they are teenagers and as they have cancer, it is unlikely to resolve with a miracle cure and everyone hugging at the end with bones unriddled with a disease made up of them.<br />Death is ever present in the book, but it avoids nihilism. The sadness can only come from people not giving in, because of course there can be no real sadness if one just lays down and dies. Forfeiting life is forfeiting emotion, and this too is a huge part of the book.<br />Hazel Grace, our protagonist with her cannula O2 tank at the ready, is possessed by a burden whose weight does not drag down, but shoves forward. The descent of her life towards its inevitable end is, though somehow not hastened, given momentum by the press of all persons who have come before her. By her own assertion, to be dead is to no longer have the option of life and all the experiences, good and bad, that living entails. As such, Hazel Grace knows she must continue to live for as long as she can, and live as much as she can, as a sign of respect to the billions of dead who cannot.<br />If should feel a power outside yourself compelling you, to have it shove you in one direction or another, it is always best to choose a power that pushes forward rather than back or down or sideways. Hazel Grace finds living overwhelming, but does so anyway because the alternative is not only undesirable to the individual, but disrespectful to all those who don't have the free choice to go back and forth between the states of living and nonliving.<br />In short, amazing book, short but perfect in its shortness because- like Portal - it gets its point across and then leaves you to do your thinking thing. If you can take the sadness - I point that out because the romance is amazingly not retch inducing in the slightest - read this. And if you can't take the sadness, then maybe you should read it anyway, because that is sort of the point, isn't it?
B001NHNG64|5.0|Had to make my self put the book down to go sleep could not wait  to pick it back up the next day and start all over again lost some sleep but finished a great book time to buy the next one

B00B3HJLX6|5.0|I know, every band does covers, but these guys are all masterful musicians with ability to spare.  High Wire by Badlands?  I've never heard a singer that could hit those notes like Ray Gillen.  Just plain awesome!  All the tunes sound great and they do them all justice (and then some).<br />For those that complain that this band is not Prog, get overt it and just listen to the music, these guys sound great together.
B009KHBDUU|1.0|I seriously have no recollection of buying this Blu-ray.  C'mon, seriously?  This is on a shelf in my house?  Um, I'm guessing NO!  I find it hard to believe and frankly I'd like someone to look into this.  If you have the NERVE to say I bought this, than YOU better be able to prove.<br /><br />Oh hey.  Here it is.  Guess I did buy it.  Go figure.  Never watched it, but there it is.
B0092SPYQG|3.0|I expect much more from PR.  It seems like they are really working hard to be commercial (pop) and seem to be losing the edge that made me a fan.  I hope they will wake up at some point and start playing hard again, leaving out that &#34;power-pop&#34; stuff.<br />Not bad, not good, but there are a few songs worth listening to on it.
0553801473|1.0|Oh, you don't know who Robert Jordan is? He's the author who started off a promising fantasy series, but kept milking his fans with endless boring sequels until he literally died without finishing the story. He wrote the Wheel of Time fantasy series, which got off to a great start. But then something curious happened. After the 3rd or 4th books, the series kept getting longer (3 books, 6 books, 9 books, ultimately 14! books). And even more curious, nothing ever happened in the subsequent books other than characters getting moved around to different places on the map.<br /><br />Sound familiar? Well, it seems GRRM has suffered the same malady. Success has given him a sweet taste of social and financial high life and the quality of his books are now second priorities. Feast for Cross and Dance with Dragons are boring and unimportant to story. Unnecessary. This from once a die hard fan.<br /><br />For those interested in the book series, I would suggest just reading up to Storms of Swords, and waiting for the next book that actually advances the story, whichever one that turns out to be. In hindsight, I sure wish I had not wasted so much time going through some 3000 pages in the last two books that did nothing for the story.
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|A British family vacation in Thailand but the Tsunami of 2004 interrupts all that. The impossible provided a realistic look at one families fight for survival in probably the largest natural disaster in modern human history. Naomi Watts does a believable acting job in her role in the movie. This movie is brutally realistic and the makeup and effects are well done. The story itself was a little slow at times and the children's acting could have been a bit better but overall this was a compelling watch. I do wish they had included more stories of people's plights include the Thai people as I thought the movie dragged a bit too much at times and could have had a broader approach to the story. This movie is definitely not one to watch with young children as it could give nightmares and the injuries in the movie are realistically displayed. A worthwhile rent.
B00004XQ83|5.0|Bought it for my husband, who loved the show and got the DVD for Christmas. He plays the CD all the time.
B009AMANBA|5.0|well written and keeps your attention the whole way through the book.  I would recommend this book to those who like Lincoln
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|Cassia journeys to find ky so they could be together.  They make friends and lose them as the try to find the rising.  A group who are against the society, a rebellion that has the view of choice instead of security.
B00B89WXYS|5.0|The songs and the sound on this album are what I love about 1 republic! Songs that make you feel good!
B00BR0SEAK|5.0|What can you say here, Deep Purple after 8 years release a top flight recording again!  Band members Ian Gillan  (67) vocals, sounds as good as ever, Don Airey (64) keyboards, organ, sounds crisp and fresh, Roger Glover (67) bass, keeps slapping those strings, Ian Paice (64), drums, sounding as good as ever and Steve Morse (58) the young pup, keeps playing those great riffs.  This album was produced by Alice Cooper famed producer Bob Ezrin.  Deep Purple has been going for over 45 years and continue their magic carpet ride.  Tunes i really enjoyed here were, \\"Hell To Pay\\", a classic, great sound, the magical \\"All The Time In The World\\", the uncanny \\"Vincent Price\\",  \\"A Simple Song\\" and \\"Blood From A Stone\\".  Go Out and get this Deep Purple fans you won't be disappointed!  After several weeks this is a solid five star release.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|We love this movie and the making of it was a lot of fun to watch.  Seeing the dwarfs out of costume was great and all the beautiful countryside.

B0059XTUVI|5.0|This was well done, as all of Merl Streep's interpretations are well done.  Would recommend this DVD highly.  It deserved the Academy Award that it received.

B000935TV8|5.0|I think this is a terrific disc.  Its central idea is that Rameau never wrote a substantial piece for orchestra alone, so Mark Minkowski has chosen some of his best orchestral movements from ballets, operas and so on and arranged them to form an orchestral \\"symphony.\\"  It's a really good idea which Minkowski and his musicians pull off brilliantly.<br /><br />Rameau's music is varied and colourful and we get the full range of it here, from stately overtures and rich marches to delicate airs and Rameau's amusing musical depiction of a chicken.  It's great stuff throughout, and Minkowski has skilfully arranged it into a very enjoyable programme.  I wasn't sure about the idea when I first came across this disc, but it works very well indeed.<br /><br />Part of what makes it so good is the playing, of course.  Minkowski and his Musiciens du Louvre are among the very best there are in this repertoire.  They have a fine understanding of the feel and texture of the music, they plainly love playing it and they give it immense character.  I cannot find anything to criticise in these performances - they are simply terrific, they are excellently judged and they do Rameau proud<br /><br />This is a hugely enjoyable disc.  The recorded sound is excellent - warm, clear and well balanced - and the presentation attractive, and I recommend it very warmly.  It's a gem.
