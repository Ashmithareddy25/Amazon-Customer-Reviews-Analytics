B00005YW4H|4.0|Norah Jones has a peculiar brand of smoky jazz and soulful lyricism that puts just about everyone in a good mood...which makes her work a prime target for stores looking to put their shoppers in the mood to spend money.  I hear it everywhere - in the malls, on hold lines, in the elevator...and now I'm a bit tired of it. I was much happier when her music was unknown, when her sultry voice was heard from my CD player alone. That way, I could almost imagine her as indie, and myself as an insider. Now, however, with the rest of the world imagining the same thing, I find her appeal somewhat lacking. I suppose it's the pretentious snob in me, but her music sounds, well, over played. It's gorgeous music, don't get me wrong, but unfortunately now just anther CD to push to the back burner and wait until the fervor finishes.
B0001ZX0PG|5.0|Rarely will you see acting this excellent.  Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, Kevin Bacon, and Laurence Fishburne are all simply amazing in Mystic River.<br />The film itself is quite good. The screen play was well done and the actors made the drama captivating and engaging.  The solution to the mystery in the film is rather obvious when you look back on it.  However, there was enough distraction to carry the climax to it's fruition.  <br />A dramatic film such as this could have easily been a throw-away.  Clint Eastwood does a fine job keeping Mystic River from being a formula-driven film.
B00006BTCA|4.0|Turn on the Bright Lights is an album loaded with songs that I would give three stars, since the songs tend to be derivative but consistantly enjoyable. Yet the inclusion of gems like Obstacle 1, Stella, PDA, and Roland give the album as a whole enough oomph to rise above the average. <BR>Obstacle 1's depressing lyrics (&quot;It's different now that I'm poor and aging/ I'll never see this place again&quot;) along with the lead singer's deep voice and robotic cadence cannot help but put one in mind of Joy Division, but don't pass Interpol off as a clone. The New York band's music is far more dependent on guitar atmospheres and is thus much less stark than JD. <BR>For examples of the fine guitarwork on this album, turn up the sound for the delicate intro to The New or the simple but powerful licks on Roland. If only the latter song's lyrics weren't so idiotic and calculated to sound like improvisation, I would consider it a classic. <BR>As long as you aren't expecting to be blown away by the next &quot;totally original rock saviors&quot; or something along those lines, Bright Lights is a sound and worthwhile purchase. It runs from pleasant to near-perfect the whole way through.

As for fans critical of maiden's use of synthesizers,get over it;rock music IS ELECTRONIC ANYWAY.And they know how to integrate synths perfectly with their usual fare.Anyone who loves 80's metal(and maybe progressive rock fans)would love this work!

0553275569|5.0|My boss lent me this book in about 1982.  He also had just invited me to become a member of the Southern California Soaring Club (gliders).  For me, it was the most important and inspiring book of its decade.  As a kid, the astronauts were, to me, mythic figures who risked their lives to prove what we were worth as Americans.  Several of them died in the process.  The space race was not some society social.  These guys embodied what President Kennedy said, that &quot;...We do not do these things because they are easy.  We do them because they are hard.&quot;  That, to me, epitomizes the meaning of the term, The Right Stuff.  Kennedy's statement resonated with me at the age of nine.  Tom Wolfe's book brought me down from the clouds right to ground zero.  All the faults and foibles of the astronauts, and the process of becoming one, grabbed me as incredibly real and authentic.  It also convinced me that heroes often don't have names like Smith and Jones.  And they all don't look like Gregory Peck.  And that their wives sacrificed so much, and kept their best face forward, where others would have collapsed under the weight.  It is also an incredibly funny book (the red boots, and other anecdoetes).<br />This is inspiring nonfiction of the highest order.  It was the near prospect of imminent death that brought it all together.  They were modern samurai.  It was a huge gamble, and we all went for it.  Other reviewers have commented elequently on Tom Wofle's prodigious writing talent, so I will leave it there.  Bottom line, you can count on one hand novels that captured the full depth and breadth of intense emotion that surrounded the space race of the 1960s.  Particularly in the late 70s and early 80s. Jim Lovell's Lost Moon is a good example.<br />Those were heady years, and I wish to God we could have them again, today. Compared with today, the years of the space race were the best years of our lives.  And Wolfe captured all those emotions brilliantly.  For me, it wasAmerica's finest hour.  When we sat around the kitchen table and watched Neil Armstrong set foot on the Moon, it was, for me at least, the crowning achievement of the human race.  I am thankful to have witnessed it, live.  I will treasure that memory forever.

B00005QW5X|5.0|There are people on here that do not think that Hedwig is very good, and that is okay.  The next time somebody mentions that they do not think the \\"story is good!!1!!\\" or that \\"all of these transies are weird, omgggg!!!!1\\", I might vomit.<br />If you think that the metaphors John Cameron Mitchell employs are silly or trite- news flash, he didn't make them up.  If you want to disagree with Plato, however, be my guest (it'll just validate your stupidity).  Since Hedwig and the Angry Inch was based upon The Speech of Aristophranes from Plato's Symposium (a foundational text which deals with greek mythology and is really just another version of Genesis which includes room for people of all sexual orientation) you might want to think twice about what you call silly.<br />People know Plato's name for a reason.  Mitchell is a genius.<br />Bravo.
B000002MNL|5.0|Smiths - Morrissey: let me give you the conclusion that took me 18 years to arrive at.  Besides the song Meat is Murder, Morrissey doesn't have a bad song is his catalog.  I used to think &quot;Kill Uncle&quot; (by Morrissey) was a lame album and that &quot;Maladjusted&quot; was worse.  I traded in both cd's only to buy them back years later.

0679777547|5.0|This is my second Perez-Reverte novel, and I enjoyed it equally as well as my first (which was *The Seville Communion*.)  It would seem, from my Perez-Reverte experience to date, that he has a gift for immersing memorable, well-rounded characters in an absorbing, unusual mystery.<br />The mystery of *The Club Dumas* surrounds a rare book--well, actually, three slightly different copies of the same book-which, when used together, are reputed to enable one to summon Satan.  Lucas Corso, a rare book \\"detective\\", is hired by the owner of one of the books to authenticate his copy and to track down the other two.  As he travels throughout Europe on the case, he's hunted by a mysterious stranger with a scar on his face, and he keeps running into a mysterious (and, of course, beautiful) young student who \\"coincidentally\\" turns up in many of the places Corso does.<br />Throughout it all, Perez-Reverte weaves in multiple literary references to Sherlock Holmes and The Three Musketeers and keeps the reader wondering just how all of the plot strands can possibly tie together.  Well, they do, quite brilliantly.  There is definitely more Perez-Reverte in my future.<br />(A side note: As has been mentioned, the Polanski film, *The Ninth Gate*, was based on this book.  I thought the film did a terrific job of bringing the book's thrilling atmosphere to life, with hints of evil throughout and Johnny Depp made a fine Corso--until the absolutely preposterous and greatly changed ending.  A great film, until its last twenty minutes or so.)

0451457994|5.0|This book is subject to many interpretations, and that alone makes it a great story while it also tends to send people off arguing their own points.  I'll try to stick to just one in this review, the one I believe is central to enjoying this book.  2001 (book) reveals more of the details of the story than the movie and that there are some differences (going to Saturn in the book, Jupiter in the film, as an example).  This doesn't effect the overall read, but I thought it important to point out that the two (book/film) are different enough to be confusing. Many people have seen the film, or parts of it, and that can bring some to seek out the book and others to wonder why they would bother.  The story is of Biblical proportions not only in the sense of the widest timeline in a movie (over 3 million years) but that it covers mankind's history without resorting to a long narrative, but by book ending history or in essence - their is no middle story. Man's destiny is outlined in rather 'dry' terms with little detail.  Our ancestral relatives are mysteriously guided by the first monolith and we assume this leads us to our intellectual evolution as the 'bone weapon' becomes a space ship (that's from the movie). No time is wasted explaining the change, you just have to accept it. The second monolith, buried on the moon as a marker for us to discover, assuming we did evolve, sets off the two major parts of the story - Mankinds' curiousity vs. his need for secrecy, which is portrayed by the ignorance of the astronauts to their 'real' mission and the hidden knowledge of the on-board computer entity the HAL 9000. The characters are very flat, as is HAL, and that partly distracts the reader from realizing that technology itself is the central theme. This story is a warning about the inhuman direction that mankind is making with technology.  Why wouldn't the actors be dull? We are diluting the individualism of mankind even now.  I'll dare say that Kubrick intended to expand on the dryness of Clarke's stories (The Sentinel, for one) so as to remind us of mankinds' foolish dependence on the technology we surround ourselves with. I mention the movie here as it reveals how the collaberation with Clarke had influenced the book. Clarke wrote this novel in tandem with his input on the movie screenplay and besides, Clarke is well known for taking on big issues instead of filling out characters. Back to the story. The malfunctioning of HAL leads to the final shedding of any human element in the story by simply discarding all but one of them.  From here on, you experience the story through David Bowman.  Victorious over HAL, Bowman has no one to share his final life experience with. The huge monolith, orbiting Saturn, leaves Bowman with a final mission - before he dies, find out what he can. Curiousity wiining out over survival, which seems impossible. This leads to a trip through 'unknown space', a place so 'alien' that Bowman cannot interpret what is going around him.  Being nearly driven mad, he is left to viewing some last remnants of his race before he is transformed.  Here the book better explains, without revealing any reason or purpose. Bowman is left, in a form he can get his mind around - an infant in space - to contemplate mankind's future.  A not so subtle reference is made to the elimination of nuclear weapons.  So, the end of the book, which in itself can be interpreted many ways, shows that a superior presence may yet guide us to a better future.  <br />This is only one, of many, interpretations I have had of this book/movie since I first read/viewed it, back in '68.  The title is, or course, very dated, but it still harks of a future yet untraveled.  I found the trip through this book even more 'mind-expanding' than the visual ride through the Jupiter monolith in the movie.  So, it is because this story has so open an interpretation that it excels and also tends to baffle some readers and disgust others. It is in the 'not answering'the questions that I give this book 5 Stars.  If Clarke had succumbed to giving the reader his own interpretation it would have poisoned the very 'mystery' the book had built. After all, how can you describe something that could be God or a future human species, or anything else in between? Much less give a reason for their actions that would make sense to us mere humans.  <br />2001 is a great read that will leave you thinking the ultimate thought - your very existence.  The fun is in the trip, not the destination.

This is the last of a four book set, preceded by 2010 &amp; 2061, books that shouldn't have been written.  Over four books you finally reach a pinnacle, that does nothing more than disappoint.  The ending is similar to Independence Day (the movie). Computer virus wins over are ancestral guides? Ughhh! <BR>It earns one star because it set up a great premise, but could not deliver.

Luckily for him he is returned to his nest by a friendly Snort (dump truck) before his mother gets back.<br />The spirit of the little bird who goes looking for his mother is wonderfully expressed through the illustrations.

B00005JMFI|4.0|I thought Will Ferrel was a genius casting call, first of all for this chareccter.  It had an original story idea, and I'm going to get it first thing when it comes out on DVD.  And I really hope it has bloopers in it....
B000002HH2|5.0|How did I miss this in the 1990s? Why did it take me almost ten years to hear this great album? Which excuse can I use? Surely not stupid youth - I was old enough to know good music when it smacked me in the face. So why didn't this smack me in the face in 1995? After soaking in the marvelous &quot;Debut&quot; (a crony forced me to listen to it, and my gratitude pours out for him) the expectations were admittedly pretty low for the follow up. Beginners luck, I thought, the next one will smell like putrid seepage. After all, second albums always reek, don't they? Ok, so I'm an idiot. &quot;Post&quot; in many ways surpasses its predecessor. Intimidating electronic industrial thumps provide fodder for both dancing and fear. Bj&ouml;rk sounds outright scary and disturbing on some of these tracks (particularly &quot;Army of Me&quot; and &quot;Enjoy&quot; - two of the album's best songs). Then, just before you can stop cowering, she turns fear and rage into heartbreaking beauty on such songs as &quot;Hyperballad&quot;, &quot;You've been Flirting Again&quot;, and &quot;Isobel&quot;. One of the album's biggest surprises is &quot;It's Oh So Quiet&quot; - a big band show-tooney type song in which Bj&ouml;rk stretches her vocal cords to their absolute limit. Her screams penetrate the cochlea in unimaginable ways. Be prepared oh reposed and complacent headphone wearers. What a great song, and what a great demonstration of Bj&ouml;rk's versatility and vocal prowess. Overall the album has a more electronic and industrial feel than &quot;Debut&quot; (which may account for its freshness even today). Bj&ouml;rk explores many of the same themes here as on her first outing: Obsessive love, escape, heartbreak, being &quot;naughty&quot;, and escape. An astounding follow-up album, and more amazing still considering what comes next.
B0001IN0DA|5.0|Speaking as someone who was there is show was amazing &amp; you wouldn't be disapointed in buying the DVD set as aside from the standard extras you will also get two brilliant documentaries.  One of which was the much hyped 'film' made around wrestlemania 19.  While the Goldberg, Lesner (Stoned Cold ref) match was let down by outside circumstances (it is still worth seeing just to see how the reality of a poorly booked match can be let down by the reality of politics).  With the return of the Deadman getting the biggest pop of the night (simply breathtaking to witness - even if the match was fairly standard - who cares), and possibly the second best ever wrestlemania match of all time occuring in the form of the mainevent what more could you ask for?

B00005JLR8|5.0|It will be difficult for me to say enough good words about this film.  It pulls the heartstrings, but not in a heavy, forced, sentimental way.  I too, question reviews that seem overtly overly praise-filled.  But maybe this movie struck a chord with me being a parent and going through some difficult times with babies that you care the world for but struggle with health issues.<br />The actors and actresses (not sure which one the coffeehouse across the way from the Hell's Kitchen tenement slum transvestite group truly falls into) in the film all perform brilliantly.  It is a testament to director/writer Jim Sheridan that he solicits such honest seamless performances out of each of the main players that act out the events of a battered and beleaguered family that comes across the Canadian border illegally into New York City.  New York City comes to represent America as a place of challenge difficult to work through poverty, difficult to cope with the cost of medical care, difficult to catch a break, but fraught with freedom and opportunity none the less.<br />The film brilliantly turns into less of a movie about New York City slums and more about the powerful grace of the human experience, more about a family going through the grieving process and sticking together through difficult times.<br />&quot;In America,&quot; goes directly on my top ten movie list of all times (dang it now I'm going to have to go figure how to update Listmania lists on this web site...go figure).  It truly is that good.<br />--MMW

B0000VAFO0|5.0|This is definately one of the best actiton movies to come out in a LONG time.  The special effects are amazing, and the acting is great.  The little details are so perfect, and the story is Awesome.  You actually get background for the characters in this movie, not all of it, but enough to tantalize you and make the second installment a must see!  This is not your typical vampire/werewolf movie, it totally raises the bar.  To give you a quick rundown of the story line, vampires and werewolves have been fighting for centuries.  Only now, they use modern day equipment and modern weapons, like guns to fight eachother.  One werewolf decides that he wants to create a sort of hybrid half vampire half werewolf, but stronger than both.  I won't say any more, but sufice to say, it is an action packed thriller of a movie, with an ending that leaves you begging for the next movie to get here!  I have watched this movie a dozen times over, and I am still not tired of it.  Every time I watch it, I pick up something new, something that I did not see before, or a connection that I did not make.  Anyway, this movie rocks, and you should check it out!

Unfortunately, no one writes songs like these any more, at least, they don't sing them with the same conviction that fleetwood mac does.  Every song on this album is absolutely amazing and truly timeless.  If you have never heard this album, I encourage you to listen to it.  It is a beautiful collection, and you will not be disappointed.
0385512104|5.0|What a strange, yet utterly enjoyable book.  Certainly like nothing I have ever read before.  A quick read, The Curious Incident is intermittently funny, twisted, poignant and touching.  <br />I read most of this book on an airplane, and couldn't avoid chuckling out loud.  My friend who was sitting across the aisle would always ask what I was laughing at, and he was consistently shocked when I would read the passages out of context.<br />This one shouldn't be missed.

Amazingly they even have Middle Eastern terrorists as the bad guys...who would have ever thought of that?  Most movies these days stay so far away from that subject they can get downright comical in their efforts to find a bad guy.  <br />This is just a plain fun movie.  Bad guys, stuff blowing up, hero dad saves the day.  Great for a Saturday evening to get a few laughs and relax.
B0001L3LUE|2.0|I rented this movie because i had heard from many people that it was a fascinating insight into the life of a very important person of the last century.  The movie, however, is mostly just McNamara justifying the horrendous things he and Curtis Lemae did in Japan and the things he did in Vietnam.  This movie was billed as a movie that would make people think twice about war but Morris doesn't challenge McNamara at all the entire interview.  McNamara even admits that he answered the question he wished he had been asked during press conferences instead of the one that had been asked and he certainly uses that tactic in the movie.  I do not recommend this movie unless you want to hear someone justify firebombing Japan and carpetbombing Vietnam.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|WOW. I went out and brought this c.d. today and I can say that I DEFINATLEY DO NOT REGRET spending 20-some dollars on it. I got it on the strength of two singles: If I Ain't Got You and Diary. The first made me sit up and thank god that rnb is back. This song is amazing. I like the way her voice almost breaks in the chorus thru the anguish she endures &quot;Some people want it all/But i dont want nothing at all/If I ain't got you&quot;. The second song, Diary, just blew me away when i first heard it. Its one of those songs that give u goosebumps when you first hear it, like &quot;U Make Me Wanna&quot; by Usher or &quot;Never Let me Down&quot; form Kanye West. The Song is PHENOMINAL! I hope it gets all the success it deserves. And with Tony!Toni!Tone! guesting on it, it makes the second half of the song even better. <br />The real major difference from Songs In A Minor is that it sounds more fluid. There is far less stop/start piano work than in songs like &quot;Fallin'&quot;, and heavy 'duhhhhhh da da duhhh' like in &quot;A Woman's Worth&quot;. It has way greater production and her voice, oh, itz unbeliveable. Way richer, way more emotive, it sounds like shes expressing the words rather than jus saying them.<br />Unlike other rnb c.d.'s that have come out of late, (Beyonce, Ashanti, and whatnot) this is one of those c.d.'s that u have to LISTEN to, not jus HEAR. Go out and buy it, money unregretably spent.
1573921394|5.0|First,let's write down the core of the classical and/or neoclassical theory Keynes criticized in the General Theory.Let  p equal the price level,w equal the money wage,MPL equal the marginal product of labor,mpc equal the marginal propensity to spend on consumption goods,mpi equal the marginal propensity to spend on investment goods(capital or producer goods like machinery,equipment or factories)and mps equal the marginal propensity to save .For the classical- neoclassical theory,the economy is at an optimal state on the boundary of both the static and dynamic production possibilities frontiers if the following equilibrium condition holds for the aggregate labor market:w/p=MPL.For Keynes the condition is w/p=MPL/(mpc+mpi).neoclassical theory is a special case where mpc+mpi=1.Keynes's GT is mpc+mpi<or=1[mpc+mpi is <or= to mpc+mps=1].neoclassical theory is the special case of an econony always operating on the boundaries of both PPF's under resource scarcity so that there is an inverse relationship between consumption goods and investment goods.Only in this special case will classical/neoclassical theory be operational.In a statistical sense,classical/neo. theory assumes that on average the economy is on its boundary.The business cycle would consist of minor inflationary/deflationary gaps which would be self correcting through business inventory adjustment alone.None of this is operational if the economy is operating in the interior of either PPF's.Given the stability of the consumption function, Keynes came to the conclusion that the problem was insufficient long run investment due to a highly volatile and unstable mpi in the private sector.The result is an investment gap.Keynes's solution is not deficit finance but having the public sector borrow the inactive private financial funds at existing very low rates of interest to spend as a special capital account on a continuing series of infrastructure projects which will more than pay for themselves over time.If this policy is opposed then Keynes would be willing to copy the wasteful policy of the Egyptian pharaohs and build a series of pyramids over time.Although wasteful,such a policy would close the investment gap and lead back to the boundary of the static and/or dynamic production possibilities frontier.classical/neo. theory would then be operational as long as the mpi's unstable behavior was continually offset by increased public sector/public goods/infrastructure spending.                Keynes presented a generalization of neoclassical theory.Keynes starts the GT in chapter 2 where he analyzes the neoclassical theory of the labor market.He notes that the most advanced technical treatmant was presented by Pigou in his 1933 book,The Theory of Unemployment.Keynes demonstrates in the appendix to chapter 19 that Pigou's model of his theory is a special case of Keynes's general model developed in chapters 20 and 21.The primary result of neoclassical theory is that an optimum result (full employment)is obtained in the aggregate labor market if the aggregated real wage(w/p) equals the marginal product of labor(mpl) derived from an aggregated production function(O= phi(N)).This is expressed as w/p=mpl,where w is the money wage,p is the price level,and mpl is the aggregated marginal product of labor.In chapters 20 and 21 Keynes presented his mathematical analysis.This leads to his generalization of the quantity theory's equation of exchange,MV=PO,to incorporate uncertainty and the speculative demand for money besides risk and the transactions demand for money.There are two such generalizations.Chapter 20 analyzes the labor market and the commodity market.Mathematically,there are two ways of expressing Keynes's first generalization in chapter 20-w/p=mpl/ep or the more convenient w/p=mpl/(mpc+mpi).Unless the elasticity ep=1(ep can range from 0 to 1) or the mpc + mpi=<1,the RHS of both equations will rise .This requires that the money wage also rise.Neoclassical theory requires that the money wage fall.The condition that the elasticity ep equal 1 means the economy is operating on the boundary of the aggregate production possibilities function curve because the labor market clearing condition,w/p=mpl, is an economically efficient outcome.It is thus allocatively efficient and productively efficient.             In chapter 21,Keynes presents his generalization of the neoclassical equation of exchange with the money market added to the labor and commodity markets.The mathematical generalization now becomes w/p=mpl/e,where e is the elasticity that\\"... measures the response of money prices to the quantity of money in an aggregated economy\\"(GT,p.305-306).Unless e=1,where e can range between 0 and 1 ,as implicitly assumed by neoclassical economists,the RHS of the above equation will rise and it will be impossible for labor,in the aggregate, to cut its money wage as claimed by neoclassical theory in order to reduce unemployment.Again,the money wage will have to rise.         The final point that needs to be cleared up is that Keynes's aggregate supply function is correctly specified and analyzed mathematically in chapter 20 on p.283 and in a footnote on pp.55-56 of the GT.The reader must be able to apply simple integration to Keynes's derivatives.I give the steps below:         Go to footnote 1 on p.283 of the GT.Keynes defined P to be expected economic profit.The second line from the bottom of this footnote reads as \\" = delta P \\", which is the same as\\" = dP\\".That should actually be \\" = delta P w subscript\\" due to either (a) a typographical error made by the printer in the GT or (b) because Keynes felt that it was obvious,since he divided D=Z through by w,to get Dw subscript = Zw subscript,which means that you must divide P by w.P is AUTOMATICALLY DEFINED IN TERMS OF WAGE UNITS.Pw subscript is equal to Dw subscript-N.Thus dP(or dPw subscript)=d(Dw subscript - N) =dDw subscript -dN.Simple integration gives the following result- Pw subscript=Dw subscript-N.Divide through by w and you obtain P=D-wN.Add wN to both sides.You get P+wN=D=pO or Z =D.Z=P+wN.w is the money wage.N is aggregate employment.p is the expected price level.O is real output,which is a function of N.D,the expected aggregate demand function,is thus equal to expected total revenue.Z,the expected aggregate supply function,is equal to total variable cost plus expected economic profit.     The same analysis and result is contained in footnote 2 on pp.55-56 of the GT.Keynes defines the derivative dZw subscript/dN=dphi(N)/dN =phi'(N)=1,where you use \\"d\\" instead of \\" delta \\" notation used by Keynes.Integrate to obtain Z=wN + C,where C is a constant of integration,after you divide through by w.We know that D=Z by definition and that D=pO from chapter 20.We get wN +C=pO or C=pO-wN once we subtract wN from both sides.By definition,C must be equal to actual profit if p is an actual price and expected profit if p is an expected price.Of course,if P=0,then you get Z=wN = total variable cost.(This is the case of constant returns to labor.Note that Keynes covered this case explicitly at the top of p.284, as well as on p.306 of the GT ,in chapter 21.)This,of course is the mistake that Don Patinkin made continuously from 1976-1989 in 3 books and 5 articles-failing to consider that Z is linear in both the diminishing returns and constant returns to labor cases.Of course,in the case of constant returns to labor,you would get a linear 45 degree cross representing the aggregate supply curve.The same mistake is made by all Post Keynesian economists like Sydney Weintraub, Paul Davidson,Douglas Vickers,Jan Kregel, Victoria Chick,Nevile,Skott and Dutt,etc.They fail to consider that Keynes worked with both cases, diminishing returns to labor as well as constant returns to labor,in his microeconomic analysis contained in chapters 20 and 21 of the GT.It is not surprising that the Post Keynesians can not deal with the technical analysis contained in chapters 20 and 21 of the GTand expressed by Keynes in the form of elasticities.Instead,they build their analysis on the claims of a mathematically illiterate economist named Dennis Robertson.It was Robertson who claimed that Keynes's theory of effective demand(D-Z analysis)was contained in chapter 3 of the GT.All Post Keynesians base their work on the assumption that Robertson was correct.Post Keynesians also confuse the D=Z locus,the aggregate supply curve,with Z,the aggregate supply function.All of these errors can be traced back to the original errors made by Dennis Robertson in correspondence with Keynes in Feb.-Mar.,1935 about the first 17 chapters of the GT.Keynes told Robertson very clearly that the analysis of his D-Z model was in a chapter called the Employment Function.Chapter 20 of the GT is titled,\\" The Employment Function \\".After seventy years it is time for economists to read this chapter upon which KEYNES SAID EVERYTHING DEPENDS.   The reason why ed <1 ep <1,e <1, and mpc+mpi<=1 is that the decision to invest in long lived durable capital goods ,within an economic environment of technological and financial change,advance,and innovation,thus creating the problem of technological obsolescence,is made under conditions of Keynesian uncertainty or Ellsbergian ambiguity.Neoclassical theory postulates that there is no uncertainty or ambiguity,only risk ,which is universally represented as the standard deviation of a normal probability distribution.This means that aggregate investment expenditure will not be erratic,unstable,and insufficient over time.Involuntary unemployment can't result   Keynes argues,as does Daniel Ellsberg implicitly,that the assumption of normality is a special case.Hence ,Keynes's generalization that covers ambiguity and/or uncertainty.This means that aggregate investment will be erratic,unstable,unpredictable,and insufficient over time.Involuntary unemployment will result.
0064407667|1.0|I don't mind dark and depressing children's books. Plenty of them have depressing beginnings (_James and the Giant Peach_) and sad events (_Bridge to Terabithia_). Children can handle this in the context of the story.<br />So the dark aspects of this story didn't bother me, especially with the over-the-top way in which it's presented (all of the \\"oh reader, turn back now, so awful\\" asides). What irritated me was that the author didn't seem to try very hard to go beyond the predictable genre aspects (They're orphans! Sent to live with a nasty relative! In a filthy house! ... gosh, I've _never_ seen a story like this before) or to even make the \\"bad\\" things very bad or creative at all (They have to ... make dinner! And then ... the Count wanted something else! And later ... the boy is slapped!).<br />I also found the constant definition-asides for words quite cloying and condescending. Occasionally they were attempts at humor, which was fine, but for the most part they were actual definitions which wrecked the flow of the story (and in a patronizing tone, not like other children's books asides, e.g. all of the addressing of \\"Best Beloved\\" in _Just So Stories_). _The Wind in the Willows_ had a much more complex vocabulary and needed no pauses to explain the words. This book could have succeeded without them.<br />To be honest, the tone and plot of this book gave me the impression of having been originally written as some kind of kindergoth Edward Gorey-esque spoof for sale at Hot Topic, but then was dumbed down several notches to reach a larger audience.<br />I did like how the older sister Violet is an inventive young engineer, though. That was a fresh note in this book.<br />I recommend skipping this book and going directly to the source for depressing-yet-fun-to-read children's books - Roald Dahl. Try _James and the Giant Peach_ or _George's Marvellous Medicine_ for much more imaginative stories of young children forced to stay with nasty relatives.
B00006IUL7|3.0|I expected this to be really good, but the potentially excellent film by Christopher Nolan was really hurt by the attitude of Al Pacino as a cop in Alaska. In his past few movies, he tries too hard to be young and savvy when he just needs to accept that he is aging. He tries to be cool in this and he is just retarded. Hilary Swank didn't do anything at all to make this movie any better. Robin Williams is the only bright spot in this movie. He is the reason for me giving this three stars. He can play a pretty good villain.
B000096FUD|5.0|OH! The pieces of film the documentary shows is alone worth the price. The clips of Gilliam's film look gorgeous. Watching the making and unmaking of this creation is compelling viewing.
B0000DJZA5|1.0|This was unnecessary, it is uninteresting, and not that different from the original on most songs.  As for the songs that were amateurly re-produced, they are worse, not better.
B0000029LG|3.0|Michael Jackson set himself up for criticism when he assembled this 2-CD set.  He put his legendary classics like &quot;Billie Jean&quot;, &quot;Bad&quot;, and &quot;Rock With You&quot; on one CD, and put on the second CD songs that indicate a severe style change. Gone are the colorful songs by Quincy Jones and the infectious pop beats by Teddy Riley.  Instead, the listener hears an angry, media-bashing, and sometimes paranoid Jackson.  <br />I think Michael should have released the second CD by itself, and waited to release a greatest hits collection instead of the flop &quot;Invinsible&quot; album in 2001.  Putting them together leaves too much room for negative comparison.<br />Though a few songs should have been left off of the album (This Time Around, Money, Childhood, HIStory, Little Suzie), there are several highlights:<br />SCREAM-Michael's duet with Janet is both funky and meaningful.<BR>THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT US-Though accused of Anti-Sematic lyrics, Michael made this song work using a memorable rhythm and chorus.<BR>STRANGER IN MOSCOW-Probably the best song on the CD. Beautiful Ballad<BR>EARTH SONG-Another powerful MJ anthem.  The power rock ballad ending is very haunting.<BR>D.S.-This song gained notoriety as a direct attack on Tom Sneddon, Santa Barbara County District Attorney, who is reported to have a personal vendetta against Michael from the 1993 allegations.<BR>COME TOGETHER-Great remake of Beatles classic. Michael works it well.<BR>YOU ARE NOT ALONE-#1 hit for Michael in 1995. Beautiful love song.<BR>TABLOID JUNKIE-I just like this song because of its &quot;Janet-esque&quot; beat (Think of songs from &quot;Rhythm Nation&quot; or &quot;Control&quot;)<BR>2BAD-Big Beat Hip-Hop track. However, if you can get your hands on it, the version from &quot;Ghosts&quot; is better.<BR>SMILE-Second best song on the album.  I don't know why people dislike this song.  It's uplifting. I always smile when I hear it. <br />Like I said, the second CD may be hit and miss, but I think it would be a lot more popular if it had been released separately.
B000002UDB|1.0|Yeah, the flute on &quot;The Fool on the Hill&quot;, the instrumental &quot;Flying&quot;, and the feel of &quot;Your Mother Should Know&quot; really remind me of psychedelic rock music.
0792843584|1.0|I was one of the people who went to see this movie when it first came out in New York City - if you blinked, you missed it because it was pulled after one week! That's an indication of how bad this movie really is.<br />While I was watching the movie, I started trying to read lips because the sound was just so horrendous, you could barely hear or understand what was being said - I'm not kidding. I could hear wagon wheels turn and horses trot better than I could the actor's voices. By the end of the movie my glutimus maximus was numb - along with the expressions on the audience's faces. You could hear a pin drop in the place - then the avalanche of boos and scathing reviews started pouring down. I've never experienced anything like it before or since.<br />The scenery and music is fantastic, everything else is truly horrendous. Cimino had over 200 hours of film which needed to be cut down to between 2 and 3 hours - it's impossible to make a cohesive, intelligent movie from such a huge amount of film - storylines get trimmed or cut completely leaving you to wonder what the heck is going on or why certain things seemed disjointed and/or untold.<br />You're left wondering how someone who created a spectacular movie like The Deer Hunter could have become so self-absorbed that he created a disaster of enormous proportions. $40 million  might not seem like much nowawdays, but in 1980, it was a heckuva lot of money. (It's equivalent to $100,000,000 today!)<br />Such a shame that Cimino threw his career down the toilet with this movie.
B00028HBKM|5.0|This movie is very very cool.  I for one will be honest and say I dont like to go to church, and im really not into anything spirtual, but I HAD to see this movie.  This movie is one of the few movies that I was about ready to cry watching it.  Mel Gibson did a very fine job showing what Jesus did for his people.  This movie actuly scared me in some scenes which added to its value.  This is one of the few films also that when I got up to leave the theater, I look around and half the audience is still sitting in there seats, looking blankly at the screen.  Props to James Caviezel for his outstanding portral as Jesus.  He did an unbeleavable job for that kind of demanding role.  Well worth the price of admition and dvd.
1587990717|1.0|This book has little substance on the central theme of people having a poor understanding of the cause and effect of events, and that people with poor math literacy are often misled by numbers.<br />A far better book on this topic is &quot;Innumeracy: Mathematical Illiteracy and its Consequences by John Allen Paulos.  <br />More than the lack of substance the tone of this book makes one think that the author doesn't respect the intelligence of others.  Yet he doesn't any new value to this subject as you'll see if you read other authors on this topic.  Perhaps the author was fooled by the fact that someone would publish his book, but that doesn't make him a mavin on this topic, especially since his examples are retreads.
B0002DB0FO|4.0|Excellent ensemble cast led by Treat Williams.  Mr. Williams has received some award nominations/consideration for his work in this show.  It is deserved.  He's found a wonderful mix of comedy and drama portraying an interesting character about whom we really care.  <br />Great work by the other cast members as well.  Some quirky residents of a small town call to mind Northern Exposure.  A storyline involving the happenings of a group of high school students provides the teen angst.  I believe some of the folks involved with Dawsons Creek are involved with this show.  Those people have improved the quality of their work.  Unlike DC (which had characters and dialogue that made one want to jab a fork in one's eye), the teen angst in this show has heart and warmth.
B0001ZX0OW|2.0|While this film was very well received by critics and the general public, I found it to be quite boring. Don't get me wrong, the cinematography was outstanding and the actors all turned out bravura performances. The problem is it's plot, or rather the lack thereof. I could discern no consistent theme throughout the movie. It seemed as if the writters had made up a wish list of overly dramatic scenes and then pieced together a story to provide some logical connection betwixt them. The movie is not presented as a suspense film, in which the purpose is solely to keep you guessing and intriqued until the end when the truth (usually a twist)is finally revealed, but rather as a drama, where some fundamental mystery about the human condition is supposedly explored. Because it's a drama, the twist at the end (which I think EVERYONE saw coming 30 minutes in) isn't the point of the film and so your left looking for some meaning beyond it. Because of it's paper thin plot though,your search is in vain. For this reason, Mystic River fails as an artistic expression.

1592400876|5.0|Well I can see why this is a deserved best-seller. She did her work, shows \\"how.\\"<br />1. First, be complete, comprehensive-and credible. Thus, she did sedulously research all the classic books on punctuation (and scrupulously cited same in the bibliography).<br />2. Then, be comprehensive: and she did cover all the bases or issues. Apostrophe, comma, colon, semicolon, ellipses, dash, exclamation point, italic, hyphen, brackets, quotation marks-even the solidus or virgule (slash) and the interrobang?! She treats complexities exhaustively. (Like, eight uses for the apostrophe! Plus exceptions and fine points, as in \\"Connors' forehand\\" vs. \\"Connors's forehand\\"!! Even, eleven uses for the hyphen, who knew!!!]<br />3. But then be clear; and she slimmed down the ponderous punctuation profundities into trim crisp clean writing. Who's  core is a classic manual (hers is that's whose...)<br />4. Plus be subversively moral-normative,--but rhetorically. So she slips in here and there a modest defense of \\"pedantic sticklers,\\" a covert plea for good grammar, to woo those readers seducible into such valuation. But always lightly never overbearingly. <br />5. And do be tuneful-tuneful, do be do be do! So, she spiced things, with humor, throughout. Including her acrobatic analogies. Of which I must quote the Comma as Sheepdog: The comma \\"tears about on the hillside of language, endlessly organizing words into sensible groups and making them stay put: sorting and dividing; circling and herding; and of course darting off with a peremptory `woof' to round up any wayward subordinate clause that makes a futile bolt for semantic freedom. Commas, if you don't whistle them down, are unstoppably enthusiastic at this job... good old Comma the Sheepdog.\\" (Or also as Special Policeman.)<br />So see I know how good she is. Because see, I myself, as an English teacher (and indeed a writing specialist), in an early article, made essentially the same points (about punctuation's two key functions:for clarity of message; and for tone-and-mood). [That article-not in her bibliography-would be \\"Punctuation: Phase Two, With Feeling... (Confessions of an Apostate),\\" AEB, May 1983, pp. 102-07.]<br />But being mature I'm not jealous of her book oh no not me?! Only very admiring of her scrupulous effort-her sanguine achievement.  My excellent analysis of her excellence, shows that I know how to identify good writing (my awareness is high). Now if only I (and many others) could actually write as well as she did (her actual ability and achievement is even higher)...     ;&gt;)
0780020685|5.0|Where have I been for the last 50 years.  This movie is a must have.  It's smart, funny, action packed, and timeless (meaning that everything Kurosawa did, people are still biting today).  The final fight scenes are incredible.  It's funny, people watch Kurosawa's &quot;Hidden Fortress&quot; due to Lucas saying it inspired him to do &quot;Star Wars&quot; but every Kurosawa movie I see has a piece of Star Wars in it.

B00005QW5X|5.0|To say the least i am a fag hag, thus, i love musicals and anything remotely gay.  albeit i am neither a boy nor a gay boy but rather a female whose only form of male friends are queer, gay, fagets etc. and i have to say this is one of my favorite movies of all times when i first viewed this movie i couldn't believe it i thought \\"yes, i'm not a freak someone took two of my favorite things Rock and Roll and Transexuals and rolled it into one great movie\\" and not only did i completely fall in love with the movie the directer, writer and star of the movie but also the soundtrack which by the way you the soon to be viewer should definetly get because its the best.  Hedwig or Hansel as that was his name before his transformation or rather confusion, he and his mother lived in a cramped apartment in Communist Berlin, before the wall came down that is, They were left by his American GI father and it was just his mother and him.  THe apartment was so small that the only place for Hedwig slash Hansel could find refuse to listen to his American Rock and Roll music was in the oven.  The two lived together sleeping in the same bed until around Hedwig slash Hansel was into his late twenties and was discovered sunbathing on ruins by his semi perverted prince charming, an American military black man the two decides to get married and get the hell out of berlin.  the only thing that stands in their way is Hedwig slash Hansel's little bishop between his slash her's legs but Hansels mother whose name by the way is Hedwig convinces him that its just a simple cut and paste job and she'll be on her way to america.  but little did they know what they were into unfortunately for Hansel Berlin did not have the best plastic surgens around and instead of a female genitalia or even male genitalia he was left with a inch of skin where something was supposed to be there.  thus the title angry inch.  But to cut a good story short He took on his mothers name Hedwig and was then known throughout the movie as hedwig and referred to as her or she.  and after a few months of wedding bliss she was left by her GI husband for a younger more tight boy. left by her husband and with an inch to work with she took all her anger and fustraion into making a remarkable band with beautiful songs in which she meets tommy gnosis or rather makes tommy gnosis this psuedo rockstar whom was created and shaped into a rockstar by none other Ms Hedwig herself and then like her father and husband left her in the dumps.  but this time she wasn't going to let anyone take what she worked so hard at, her music and her heart.  you see first Hedwig meet tommy while babysitting for his family tommy was just a christian rock nerd before ever meeting Hedwig and the two hit it off they were more in love than ever the problem tommy was sadly not into the whole inch thing and couldn't work it out so like the dish and the spoon he ran away with her heart and the songs in which she wrote and made him famous rather than herself.  the underlining of this movie is all about find yourself and accepting who you are once you've found yourself and its about love and how sometimes you just have to let that one person who feel you can't live without, go.  but enough about the film i command you to watch it listen to the soundtrack and be in love.
6305320802|1.0|I have never seen anything more boring and tedious than this film. I was forced to watch this one summer Sunday night when nothing else was on T.V., and had finished the book I was reading. I wasn't particulary looking forward to seeing it, because I didn't like &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, &quot;South Pacific&quot;, or &quot;Carosuel&quot;, but I like old movies, and thought I'd give it a chance. Also it had gotten such great reviews and all and I believe it won Best Picture at the Academy Awards back in '56. After what felt like 48 hours of bordem, I came to the conclusion that this was offically the most over-rated film I have EVER seen! The promblem wasn't even that it was a musical. I like musicals, but this was just awful! The (lyrical) music and dancing was just STUPID. The story was over-used, and the charectors ANNOYING! The only reason I give this a star and 1/2 is because it was tecnically well made, even tho the music and dancing was atrocious! I can't really reccomend this movie or not, becuase I think it really depends on a persons taste. If you like &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, and &quot;Carosuel&quot;, you'll probably like this...
B0001NBMBC|5.0|So everyone is making a big deal about how Slipknot has gone soft.  Soft I say!! Not soft, just more defined.  The guitars are still heavy, the drumming still kicks a$$, and Corey still brings his unique delivery to the mic.  They are getting older, gaining some maturity as musicians, and wanting to take the band past the masks'.  If you want an album that is well crafted and shows the talents of its band members, pick it up...but don't expect &quot;Iowa&quot; or &quot;ST&quot; cause your not gonna get it. \m/
B00000G3Q4|2.0|I watched this movie tonight not expecting to like it. Why did I watch it in the first place then? Becasue I thought maybe I would end up liking it. Well, I did and I didn't. I love slasher flicks, but im not really into zombie movies.  The two other zombie movies I have seen were &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; and &quot;Day of the Dead&quot;, which I didn't like, and thought were WAY over-rated. This one was to, and certainly is NOT worth all the hye, but is still okay. The thing I liked about was that is was simple, sort of in the way &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot; was, but it's hard to explain HOW it was simple. It mostly takes place in the living room and cellar of a cabin, not in a big gothic mansion, so it's some-what realistic, and, like &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot;, it's hard to explain HOW it's realistic. There were also a few cool scenes worth the rental alone. What I didn't like about it was it was some-what boring. It was also just felt a *bit* too short. So I wouldi't reccomend fully, unless you really like zombie flicks, or you just feel like you have to see every popular horror flick as I do...
B00003CXCT|5.0|I am a huge Star Wars fan:  I saw the original trilogy in the theaters countless times when I was little and when they were re-released as an adult, dressed up as the characters many times over for many Halloweens, and I bought almost every version of Star Wars when it was released (VHS and Laserdisc).  I was there at the midnight showings of the last 2 prequels and am planning on being there once more for Episode III.  The reason why I mention all of this is because I genuinely love all Star Wars films (yes even the prequels, even though they do not compare to the original trilogy).  The bottom line for all fellow Star Wars fan like myself is that no matter what version is issued, all Star Wars fans should purchase the original trilogy DVD boxset for the sole reason that IT'S STAR WARS (PERIOD). If they come out with the original films at a later time, great...I will most likely purchase those as well, but to wait until they (maybe) release the original versions or not buy it at all shouldn't be an option for any Star Wars fan.
B00009UW0N|4.0|Although it's probably the simplest and least elaborate of all the Halloween movies, it is, in my and many others opinions, the best of the series. It's also the most well made of all the films, Halloween 4 being the second. The only neative thing about it is that it gets kind of boring only after a second or third viewing, tho it's definelty scary the first couple times.
0345457684|2.0|I bought this based on reviews on this page, and after reading it I have to say that it has been way overhyped.  To give you some background, I've read a lot of William Gibson, i.e. &lt;i&gt;Neuromancer&lt;/i&gt; etc.  Reading Altered Carbon after reading Neuromancer is like eating cheap hot dogs after feasting on filet mignon.  The characters feel flat, there is absolutely no subtlety or rich description.  It feels like a film treatment for a Vin Diesel movie, with multiple shootouts and burnt stumps.<br />Take everything that is submerged in Gibson, or hinted at: the decrepitude of the super-wealthy, the off-page violence--and then describe it in unimaginative, wooden detail.  That's what this book is.<br />It's a page turner, but when you're done you feel like someone just picked your pocket.  There's a sense of loss, and it's not the sense of loss that comes from missing the characters, it's the loss of hours of your life.<br />Take this review for what its worth.  I like Gibson's style, and I was turned off by the violence (it wasn't well done) and thought the main character was pretty dull, actually.  As an action/thriller without a lot of depth, it probably would deserve a slightly higher rating.<br />Oh, and there was one throwaway line about whales/mars that was kinda cool.
B00000J7JO|5.0|OK. So John left the band for One Hot Minute which has some great songs such as Aeroplane and My Friends. This is the cd where he came back. It has great singles (Californication, Otherside, Scar Tissue, Road Trippin', and Parallel Universe) but that isn't all. The other tracks on this cd are very good as well. Porcelain brings the slow melodic stuff they can have. Other songs have a funky style to them. Well I'll try not to bore you anymore. It's a great cd you should buy it no matter what. Flea rocks. God Bless.
B00004ZD69|5.0|Okay, this past January I was coming home carpool style from National Conference on Organized Resistence (NCOR for short) - and this guy in the front seat popped this in...  I was blown away from beginning to end... These guys are absolutely genius... I finally picked it up... I played it for a political comix artist friend and he enjoyed it as well...  i would love to see them live and hopefully soon i will - godspeed in anarchy - Savannah Skye...
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Yes, almost all of the songs on this CD are sexual and talk about sex... but it's still great!!!  The beats and mixes are absolutely awesome!! Whoever put together all the background vocals and instrumentals did an outstanding job.  Now, I'm not giving this 5 stars because I think Britney has an outstanding voice... she definitely does not, but her vocals fit in just well with her topic (sex) and they fit right into the beats.  I enjoy listening to this CD over and over again (although I must admit I like her \\"britney\\" CD a little better).  I don't really enjoy the few slower songs on this CD like Everytime, but basically every song rocks... I really like the remix of Brit and Madonna's Get In The Zone.  SUPER!!! YOU ARE GREAT BRIT!!
B00005JLWN|5.0|Equilibrium was a really good movie.  Loosely based on Ayn Rand's novel &quot;anthem&quot; and Ray Bradbury's &quot;Farenheit 451&quot; which is one of my fave books.  The post World War III movie was brilliant.  Acting was good, plot was awesome, and the fight scenes were nothing like ive seen before.  It was even better then the Matrix fight scenes.  I strongly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys their own individuality.
B00005JLK1|1.0|What do you get when you combine good production values, good special effects, but forget the story? This movie. Perhaps if you are a special effects addict or just have to see every bad movie that comes along, then you might enjoy this. This movie left me with nothing except a waste of my time. Just look at the number of used copies available and the low price they are asking. This should give you an indication that this is a movie you will never want to see again. If you want a much better movie, then check out 'Deep Rising'. And somebody had to be cruel by recommending 'Event Horizon' in addition to 'Ghost Ship'. Maybe they meant that it was to be avoided just like this one. -Bob

B00009TB5G|1.0|If you like wasting like an entire half day on a movie that is insipidly boring, this will be your cup of tea. What a bloated and pretentious projcet this whole thing has been. I'd rather be drowned in a dirty toilet bowl than have to watch an EXTENDED version of an already insanely long snooze fest. Howie Long's &quot;Firestorm&quot; is better than this, because at least it ends within 24 hours of pushing &quot;PLAY&quot; on your machine.  <br />Everytime they cut back to the guys in the woods with the talking trees, I thought I was going to have to poke my eyes out. <br />I know you will all hate me. I don't care. Actutlly, it amuses me, so hate me...!
0553260111|5.0|The Matt Damon film was one of my favourite films until I read this book. <br />Simply put, it's awsome, it wrecks a great film by being better than a movie can ever be. I have lent this to my dad, my sister and my 2 best friends and they all rate it as the best book of all time!<br />It develops the plot in such a way as you never want to put it down, from the moment the unnamed man is washed up on a shore to Jason Bourne............. read it and you'll appreciate it, but do read it. A great Movie is a shadow of an amazing book!
B0001BKAEY|5.0|The first Matrix film was overpraised and this last film, The Matrix Revolutions, has been unfairly panned. Now that we're used to the novelty of the special effects, we can put them aside and look at the underlying story. Certainly one of the trilogy's most striking features is its racially mixed cast. Some might say that the racial aspect of Zion is not really the point of the film; but Zion's marginalized population, doomed to exist and rebel in perpetuity certainly reflects a global reality. America and Western Europe have their own internal Zions; the marginalized underclasses whose cultural identities have been forced to go underground and whose needs erupt into violence.<br /><br />There are some interesting mythic forces at work in the film. The Christ-like Neo sacrifices himself to save the diversity of Zion from the white, male hegemony of the Machine. Neo is helped (and even brought into being) by the Oracle, a black woman who is an archetypal figure of female power. The Oracle is reminiscent of the Black Madonna in Christianity and the earth goddess Kali in Hinduism. She could also represent the Ethiopian Queen of Sheba who guards the Ark of the Covenant. Her energy is amplified by being  underground; she represents something missing and not acknowledged in the larger culture.<br /><br />The rise of the Oracle and her power is inevitable; she balances out the sterility and dysfunction that the Architect and Smith represent. Because her power has been forced underground, it's all the more potent; she's become shrewd and wily in a way the men aren't. This makes her the only person who can summon up the supernatural energy to rescue Zion. The Oracle does her work and in the end, she and Sati (a little Oracle-in-training) turn the Machine City into the City on the Hill. It's a feminized, tolerant city. But it's also a city with an uncertain future.
0156421178|5.0|In the essay that prefaces this publication of *Homage to Catalonia*, Lionel Trilling declares that George Orwell was \\"not a genius [...] but a figure,\\" in other words, an individual who presided over certain historical ideas and attitudes and was able to express these conceptions in a simplistic, general way, seeking and finding the truth of the matter and subsequently scribing it without undue embellishment, overt bias or brain-taxing philosophical meta-quandary - making difficult issues palpable for mass comprehension.  I cannot say I fully agree with this hypotheses, though it certainly does make for an interesting read after completing Orwell's account of the Spanish Civil War - introductions, it seems, should always be read _last_ in order to avoid spoiling the interior text - for in my definition, `genius' is one who is able to perceive, in some fasion, the patterns and cycles generally unseen by the common multitudes, even (especially) if focused on a particular path; more importantly, genius is how this perception is then channeled and reflected to the world at large, and in that regard, Orwell's ability to penetrate the pompous falsehoods and intentional ambiguities of political discourse, via hard truths and internalized experiences, especially given the chaotic era in which *Homage to Catalonia* was written: to pierce through and then pen a novel such as this, simple but oh so telling, `easy' but incredibly effective - this certainly takes a particular type of genius. All of Orwell's novels share this sort of rolled-up-sleeves ethic.  Trilling may find *Animal Farm* to be over-rated (as do I, with reservations), but as a metaphor it is one of the greatest of the first half of the 20th century - easily the most influential and public-schooled - and certainly the product of a genius perception internalized and painstakingly realized.  <br />Of course, I have the hindsight benefit of half a century, whereas Trilling wrote his essay a mere two years after Orwell's death... such is the advantage of time! Orwell makes note of this as well, concluding that his theories would either stand or fall when re-examined from afar.  Time has tested his experiences, indeed, and the breadth of clarity and caustic recognition is just as pertinent now, at the beginning of the 21st century, as it was in the late 1930's.   <br />When the Spanish Revolution broke out in 1936, the country was torn between the utopia-seeking leftist radicals/anarchists and the old-form power structure still fighting for control, allied with the notorious Generalissimo Franco and his Fascist-funded army.  Although Orwell initially traveled to Barcelona as a journalist, he was so impressed with the fact that the Spanish were fighting Fascism - something incredibly rare in that pre-WW period of European history - that he hung up his press-cap and picked up a rifle, impelled by what he called \\"common decency\\" to naïvely join one of the many leftist factions without a hard inquiry into the political realities of the conflict.  Luckily he did not put down his journalist's pen: after the fallout, Orwell scribed his experiences in concise, articulate form, remarkably free of the prevalent propaganda shrouding the fiasco...and that is why this book has lasted, while the forked tongues and tabulations of that period have all `withered on the vine,' so to speak.<br />*Homage to Catalonia* describes two experiences of violence: the outer violence, being Orwell's wry, almost nostalgic reflections of serving in the trenches for some five months in 1937 - coping with starvation, winter cold, boredom and the occasional pot-shot from the opposing side; and the inner violence, being his eventual disillusionment of Communism as a political ideology.  The first violence is, naturally, the most entertaining to read, with its adventures and unexpected conflicts, its hardships and absurdities all lovingly infused with Orwell's dry wit, set in stone via his very-English style, full of humility, human awareness and healthy skepticism.  The second violence is more complicated, convoluted (due to the political particulars), and both harrowing and illuminating in detail. Already a committed Socialist, Orwell was stunned and gratified to discover how, under extreme duress and remarkable isolation, his militia-sect of revolutionaries achieved, for a short time, a truly \\"utopian\\" society, Marx's theory made true: and how this was betrayed and irrevocably shattered by opposing forces, namely, the rest of the world.  Revolution was not in the interests of anyone outside of Spain, as it threatened vested interests and stability; even Stalinist Russia, so-called bastion of the left, sabotaged its red brethren with shoddy munitions and double-dealing.  After defending Spain from Fascism for month after bloody month, Orwell returned to Barcelona to find he and his fellows demonized by journalists, called \\"traitors\\" and \\"pro-Fascists,\\"  transformed in the public eye from men fighting for `common decency' to pawns maneuvered by power-brokers, via their propagandist lap-dogs, into a stalemate position.  This internal fracas climaxed with pitch battle in the streets of Barcelona; after the smoke cleared (physically, at least), all members of the radical sect, be they native or foreign, were rounded up and jailed as insurgents. Forced to flee the country in disguise, Orwell left behind the ruins of a once-potential anarchistic prosperity, but his memories of that brief, classless equality among men, amidst the bullets and bombs of confused carnage, linger tellingly in the text.<br />*Homage to Catalonia* warns us to take all information with a grain of salt, to look behind the curtain and view the puppeteer jerking the strings of those talking-head mouths - a message most important in this complex, (mis)information-glutted era.  The book also serves as a vital element in Orwell's oeuvre: *Homage* can be seen as a continuation of the Socialist ideals espoused in *Down and Out in Paris and London*, and the framework experience that inspired the allegory of *Animal Farm*.    <br />Highly recommended for enthusiasts of both history and literature.

B0000TB01Y|5.0|I just bought the CD on a recommendation from a friend and seeing the preformance on the Tony's about a week ago.  It has been playing non stop.  Idina Menzel is superb, and Kristin Chenoweth I have adored since she was Lili St. Regis in the remake of Annie.  This show is just an all around pleasure to listen to.  I hope it hits the road soon or I hit the road soon so I can see it.
0784010218|5.0|As other reviewers have said, this movie is timeless. It was made when I was about 5 years old but when I first saw it at the age of 16 I fell in love! And no, not over Patrick Swayze's six pack and pecks (although they are added bonuses!) but over the heart and humanity of the story. The story takes place in the summer of 1963 \\"Before President Kennedy was shot, before the Beatles came\\" as Baby, the heroine, says. She and her Mom, Dad and sister are on their way to a family vacation spot. Baby is sort of a wallflower, she has her own ideas and ambitions but no spark to her life. Then, she sees Johnny Castle, a tall, rebellious dance instructor. When Penny, Johnny's dance partner, finds out she's pregnant and decides to get an illegal abortion, Baby becomes involved in the struggles of the teens and twenty-somethings barely making a living among the \\"elite\\".<br />Baby then makes a deal to learn how to dance so that both Johnny and Penny can keep their jobs. I love these scenes when she and Johnny are arguing over the dance steps. The scene with \\"Hungry Eyes\\" is one of my favorites! In the course of this, we see Baby's evolution from dowdy clothing to great clothes and makeup! And once she shows some spirit, the story really begins. Johnny learns to respect her and she sees the true person hidden behind the tough exterior.<br />Of course, there has to be conflict. When Penny's abortion threatens her life, Baby again saves the day by bringing her doctor father in to save her. Johnny takes the wrap for the pregnancy and at the same time, Baby makes a bold move!<br />Penny's pregnancy and Baby's automatic assumption that the child is Johnny's is typical of the wealthy's view of people considered \\"low\\" class. The fact that it is Robbie's, the med. student waiter, shows the truth of life. Appearances are deceiving. This movie is a lesson for anyone willing to automatically lean on stereotypes. Baby's Dad was sure Johnny was the bad guy and was all ready for Lisa (his other daughter) to marry Robbie!<br />If I say any more, I will give away the whole plot. But believe me, it only gets better and better! Dirty Dancing is all about having fun, giving people a chance, not falling in to stereotypes and not being afraid to fall in love! This rings true for any generation. This movie is a MUST WATCH for anyone!r daughter) to marry Robbie!<br />If I say any more, I will give away the whole plot.

B00008S2VG|2.0|I got a violent stomach ache from this record. It's terrible. Why does Madonna call herself a singer. More like the terminator, best describes her.
B0000AQVCL|1.0|Save your money on this one, folks, 'cause it's crappy.
B0001ZX0PG|5.0|Clint Eastwood's latest dalliance with the camera (and the composing pen--he wrote the original score) lives up to its hype. While Marcia Gay Harden seems to overact in places, and Sean Penn's powerful acting can sometimes feel overwhelming, the outstanding ensemble holds up its end of the bargain. What makes the movie work, though, is a clever screenplay that forces the viewer to again and again reconsider the motives of the characters. <br />This is the story of a murder, that of Sean Penn's daughter. It is the story of secrets between friends, and of how one terrible event can haunt the lives of everyone involved, whether participant or bystander. And, while there are holes, and a few red herrings (particularly one involving Bacon's estrangement from his wife, whose face isn't fully shown through most of the movie), it is a story that resonates. <br />Robbins is outstanding; the initial off-putting nature of his character is part of the remarkability of his performance. And Linney works magic in her limited screen time; her final scenes drive an icy dagger through the heart of the film and, more than anything else, give the ending its murky character. Bacon and Fishburne make a strong team, particularly in a scene with Robbins that offers a brief bit of comic relief to the deadly serious proceedings. <br />The Oscars were no fluke--this is a great film, well worth seeing.
B0000C9ZLD|1.0|Another crappy Pixies rip-off--get the real thing instead.
B00005JMFQ|4.0|If you enjoy romantic comedies, it's hard to imagine that you won't enjoy this one. If you're an Anglophile, it's even harder: Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman, Colin Firth, and Liam Neeson take turns on screen throughout the movie. So if you're just looking for a pick-me-up, or a romantic movie night, search no more. Here it is.<br />With that said, Richard Curtis goes a bit overboard here--and the DVD extras reveal that he wanted to go even further. The movie juggles at least eight subplots; is it any wonder Curtis had a hard time cutting it down to two hours and 15 minutes? A few subplots are clearly meant as comic relief of a sort; I particularly liked the couple that met while working as body doubles for a movie, an occupation that required them to spend long periods of time simulating all manner of sex acts with one another; when they finally fall for one another (this gives away nothing in this movie, by the way--the plots are pretty much telegraphed to the audience in the first ten minutes) they experience awkwardness just kissing. It's a sly commentary on culture and a funny moment at the same time.<br />Other subplots are sadder; Liam Neeson's wife dies at the start of the film, and he deals with his own grief and that of his stepson mostly on his own. And while it's clear that Alan Rickman will eventually succumb to the temptation of his secretary--even Emma Thompson, who plays his wife, warns him about her--it isn't clear until the end that he'll do so in a way that raises and then devastates his wife.<br />Which brings us to the primary fault with the film: the ending. There are a great many happy moments, including the wrap of the Colin Firth subplot (another one that starts out sadly), but there are also many loose ends left untied. After witnessing the devastation of Emma Thompson, we get a 15-second outro from her subplot that tells us nothing about how she and Alan Rickman dealt with his infidelity. A subplot involving Keira Knightley wrapsclumsily, with Curtis asking us to accept that one kiss from a married woman can quell an obsession and make everything right. The whole thing races to close within the allotted time, as if Curtis is fearful his audience will have to leave for the bathroom if he lingers any longer.<br />This should have been a high-profile mini-series. Really. There's nothing about it that demands the movie theatre screen, and Curtis clearly had enough plot to fill six or seven hours if he tried. The footage he left out and shows on the DVD would have made for a better movie, and the loose ends he leaves could have been wrapped up more effectively given more time.<br />Alas, that's not what happened. Don't get me wrong: you'll enjoy this movie. The airport scenes at the start and end of the movie, showing ordinary people embracing their loved ones as they arrive at the gate, will make you smile at the beginning and probably prolong your happy tears at the end. But when you stop to think about it afterward, you'll wish you could have stayed with these characters longer and known more about them. Curtis could have given you that, too.
B000267JQK|5.0|The remastered songs of disclaimer sound 100% better, especially Driven Under. The 8 new songs are awesome, but Got It Made stands out by far. Even if you own Disclaimer, this cd is worth picking up for the DVD and new tracks.
B00004W50Z|5.0|The Band's third album is just as good as the first 2.  It does have a different feel than the first two.<br />I believe Richard Manuel sings &quot;The Shape I'm In&quot; - or at least it claims that on The Band's website, as well as he sings it in The Last Waltz. I could see how people can mistaken the two voices since they sound so similar.<br />And to another reviewer - Up On Cripple Creek is on THE BAND's self titled second album...not Stagefright (it never did).
B00004SGNM|3.0|Cyndi Lauper was indeed a poster child of the early 80's, and was indeed one of the women who changed the face of music. Her voice, while lacking in soul and sultriness, is of incredible range, and no one could ever sing &quot;Girls Just Wanna Have Fun&quot; like the Cyndi did with her thin, annoying, peachy voice. I do like her very much. <br />But I must say that Ms. Lauper has never been able to transcend her original comedy, and has never been able to reinvent, like another female icon of the early 80's, Madonna. While it is true that Cyndi possessed a vocal range Madonna could never reach, it is not completely fair to accuse Mrs. Ritchie of never being a good singer. Her voice was indeed at one time powerful and rich and dark, filled with African American influence, but lacking in octave capability (which came about later in the Ray of Light Era). Please do not compare Cyndi and Madonna, each has given their share in their own way. <br />Other than that, even though Cyndi has not been able to become an enduring Icon, she was still one once. And even though the spotlight has dimmed, Ms. Lauper has indeed retained her original punkiness and comedy.
B0001BKAEY|1.0|*sigh*  Why did the Watchowski Bros. have to go and ruin a wonderful movie by making it a trilogy?<br />If you've read any of the other reviews or seen the trilogy, you know that the last 2 installments were about special effects more than the plot or the acting.  Okay, that's a little bit of an understatement.<br />What really bothers me is that there could have been a pretty great sequel if the brothers had just combined the &quot;plots&quot; of Reloaded and Revelations and tried to make just one sequel, instead of dragging out a thin plot, measly dialogue, and repetetive fight scenes for two whole movies.<br />The original Matrix was the real Revolution, as far as moviemaking goes.  It's too bad the Watchowskis' greed for money lead them to ruin it all.   I agree with another review I read; that we should just pretend like Revolutions and Reloaded were never made.
B00000I8UF|5.0|This album has the hard grooves of Art Blakey's classic powerful, forcefull, hard drive playing, and the arrangements of The Modern Jazz Quartet. This album is a Blue Note Classic. One thing I like about Art Balkey's albums are his arrangements and ways to feature his drumming. Although, it was usually the horn man who created all the arrangements, and all the breaks. But, Blakey always delivered a fantastic contribution with his forceful solos and backing behind his soloists. This album starts off with the swinging classic, Moanin', written by pianist Bobby Timmons, who plays here. If jazz made the charts, this one would be on the top of it, for the year it was made. Blues March is another song, that would make number one if there was a jazz Billboard Charts. The real gem here, is Drum Thunder. This is what I mean as the great arrangements Blakey had on his albums. Every movement is differen't, and every movement is great! If you love classic 1950's hard bop and Blue Note, you'll love this album, and especially drummers will too. You can't go wrong with this album.
B000002BFZ|5.0|After the dark raging anger of 'Vitalogy', &amp; the aggressive alternative-metal attitude of 'Vs', the last thing music fans across the world who made Pearl Jam the biggest band in the world immeditately in 1992 were expecting was this...<br />Released on August 27th, 1996 - Exactly 5 years after the pop culture icon known as 'Ten' was released (August 27th 1991) the first single, 'Who You Are' caused many people to blankly stare at their car radios thinking, &quot;Ummm.... this isnt, Pearl Jam, really, is it? must be Eddie singing with some african drum beat band or something&quot; - To everyones amazement, it was Pearl Jam<br />This album went to number 1 on the billboard charts, yet, quite possibly, is the least commercially successful album to ever be a no.1 album - the album sales today peak at about a million and a half copies sold... funny to think only 5 years before, they released an album that would go on to sell 12 million copies<br />However... This album is in my top 3 most favorite albums ever made - this, is when Pearl Jam truly broke any strings they felt they had... all creativity &amp; variety in Pearl Jam &amp; Eddie Vedder was released in one big 13 song wave on this album - The variety on this album is unmatched by any other album of the 90s &amp; possibly ever...<br />When the Velvet Underground released 'Underground &amp; Nico' in 1967, it was very commercially unsuccessful...<br />Today the album is held in legendary status - <BR>&amp; I believe the same will be in store for 'No Code' many years from now, outside hardcore Pearl Jam culture<br />This album is a perfect introduction to Pearl Jams ability to perform many styles<BR>This album is the album that hardcore Pearl Jam fans hold as one of PJs top true gems<br />This, is exactly what a 5 star album is.... personal, creative, diverse, powerful, artistic<br />One of the best albums of all time, &amp; don't expect to be taken seriously as a Pearl Jam fan until you get it
B000005HCQ|5.0|This album is much ahead of its time. After listening to it, it much reminded me of McCoy Tyner's The Real McCoy. It had a real Avant Garde sound to it, in the fact that the solos were fancy, and one can really loose the beat of it! Blakey sounds a lot like Elvin Jones here, but he hasn't copied his style in the recording of this album. The others are fabulous too!
B000056VJ7|5.0|This guy and Jim Steinman are without a doubt in my mind, the best collaboration in musical history. Jim Steinman comes up with unbelievable melodies, and thoughtful lyrics. Great guitar, piano, and everything else. This CD is even better now that it has been remastered and it sounds better. The songs are very long, with a hard rock-opera feel to them. Buy this CD, and the second Bat out of Hell which in my mind is even better.
B000001ZS4|4.0|Although Oxygene wasn't Jarre's first album (he had a few albums and singles released prior, such as Deserted Palace in 1972), it was Oxygene that made him a household name, much like Kraftwerk's Autobahn making them a household name after three obscure albums previous in the early '70s. Equinoxe follows in the footsteps of Oxygene, meaninging if you like Oxygene, you'll like this, and vice versa. Jarre took the style of such electronic greats as Tangerine Dream and Klaus Schulze, and made them more accessible. And while that might turn a few away, what he did was actually quite effective. It was Jarre that got me in to '70s electronic in the first place, as it was my parents who owned this album (as well as Oxygene and Magnetic Fields), meaning I was exposed to Jarre most of my life. Like Oxyene before, the songs on Equinoxe are all divided in parts, this time around, 8 parts. &quot;Part 2&quot;, &quot;Part 3&quot; and &quot;Part 4&quot; had always been my favorite, &quot;Part 2&quot; reminds me most of &quot;Oxygene Part 1&quot;. &quot;Part 5&quot; was the more &quot;pop-oriented&quot; number of the album much like &quot;Oxygene Part IV&quot; was to his previous album. The final piece, &quot;Part 8&quot; was basically another version of &quot;Part 5&quot;, only without any rhythms, and just the main theme. The music here tends to be more elaborate than Oxygene, as he added more keyboards. On top of the ARP 2600, Eminent, EMS synths, Mellotron, Rhythm computer, RMI Harmonic Synthesizer, he started including newer polyphonic synths as well, such an Oberheim Polyphonic, Yamaha Polyphonic (I presume a CS-80) and Korg Polyphonic Ensemble. Also new to his set was an EMS Vocoder (which you can hear on &quot;Part 5&quot;) and Elka 707. To me, I prefer Oxygene, but Equinoxe is still worth having for those who enjoy electronic music.
B00006F83Y|5.0|In spite of the nu metal revolution in the late 1990's, still a lot of kids listened to old-school metal like Black Sabbath and Judas Priest. this is an album for the kids who hate the face of modern metal, but don't want to seem outdated. QOTSA takes slightly modern sounds and mixes them with trippy, yet roaringly heavy metal that sounds straight out of, say 1974. Also, ex-Nirvana drummer Dave Ghrol plays on this album. Everybody sounds in tune, and in perfect harmony. This is THE metal album for the '00's.
B000002KAT|5.0|Next to Miles Davis's &quot;Kind of Blue,&quot; this is the most beautiful album ever made.

( alot more than 'a music fan' or 'you can't ban me' can say for themselves )<br />pink floyd is and awesome, balanced band. &quot;the wall&quot; is a cd fit together in the perfect balance of slow and fast beats spreaded beautifully through-out this album. it's a must buy for open-minded music lover

0684800713|5.0|I'm 16 and my English teacher seemed really suprised that I was reading Hemingway for fun.  I really enjoyed \\"The Sun Also Rises.\\"  I'm on my second time reading it now, I like to read books twice, you usually get more out of them the second time around.  I really enjoy Hemingway's plain, simple, to the point writing style.  He gets the story across without distracting from the main idea of it with too much flowery language.  \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" is the story of Jake Barnes, an American newspaper man who lives in post WWI Paris.  Jake was wounded in the war, and is now sexually impotent.  He's in love with the promiscuous Lady Brett Ashley, she loves him, and tells him so, often.  But Brett is engaged to Michael, a bankrupt Englishman, and has affairs with Robert Cohn, a Jewish boxer from Princeton, and a young bullfighter.  The bullfights seem to serve as sort of a metaphor for Jakes life.  He's searching for happiness, for glory, but he's doomed forever to server as a \\"steer,\\" whose only purpose in the bullfights is to keep the bulls (Brett's lovers) from killing one another. This book is really quite tragic, the characters roam around Europe, out drinking every night in an effort to fill a void in their lives.  I reccomend reading this book to almost anyone, because even though it was written in 1926 it is still relevant today.  Though we are not part of Hemingway's generation, many people today are still \\"Lost.\\"
B0001UL7RY|4.0|Alright, this CD isn't as bad as everybody's been saying it is. This is what you'd get if you combined Greenday, All-American rejects,MxPx, Simple Plan and Alanis Morsette. <br />Take me away -- a darker version of Losing Grip<br />Together -- at first listen, a bit creepy with such high vocals during the chorus but after a few listens its a good song<br />Don't tell me-- ok who hasn't heard this one?<br />He Wasn't -- another version of BAsket Case [greenday]<br />How does it feel -- slow song on the cd talking about her insecurities not my favorite song on the cd<br />My Happy Ending -- a good song has an MxPx feel to it<br />Nobody's Home -- the best song on the cd nice lyrics starts off slow but is pretty good by the bridge <br />Forgotten -- the &quot;ahh...ahhh's&quot; in the beginning kinda don't fit in. again slow start. simple lyrics with awkward spacing to make it rhyme<br />Who knows -- a poppy-all american rejects feel to it, the first few guitar chords sound like Kelly Clarkson's &quot;a moment like this&quot; but after that its ok<br />fall to pieces -- good chord progression and a catchy chorus, but it makes it sound like there should be another part (a soprano part) she seems to be singing an alto part alone<br />freak out -- love the guitar but the lyrics aren't my favorite but again, a catchy chorus<br />slipped away -- a song dedicated to her grandpa its slow and thoughtful lyrics until you reach the bridge and it repeats twice &quot;now you're gone/ now you're gone/there you go/there you go/ etc..&quot;<br />all in all, its a good cd if you subtract the songs who knows, how does it feel and forgotten. the best song is by far nobody's home. peace out
0671027344|5.0|This is  quite possibly my favorite book of all time!  It tells the story of Charlie, a very real and believable character.  He's a social misfit, with a history of depression.  Through his letters to an anonymous friend we learn of how Charlie finally finds a group of friends where he belongs.  He finally finds that moment where he feels \\"infinite\\" and ultimately discovers the real reason for his depression.  Some people have said that Charlie is not a believable character, but I'm the same age he is and i find him to be very believable.  I can relate to his friends, his life, and his taste in books and music. I would recommend this book to anyone! I just finished reading it for the fifth time and it just keeps getting better.
1563899426|5.0|I was a bit hesitant to pick this up -- it seemed like too much an adult version of Roger Rabbit or Shrek.  However, the murder mystery in an expatriate community of fairy-tale characters quickly drew me in.<br />Each character blends our preconceptions from stories we've heard (almost invariably a watered-down version of their original tale) with an edge they must've evolved after being forced from their homes.  And none of them are one-sided, even those who appear such at first -- the one-dimensional ones grow and change as the series continues.  Pick this up and be prepared to pick up the subsequent volumes!
B00005JMEW|3.0|Big fan of all of Quentins films, this is my 2nd least favourite, with volume 2 being my least. Still his worst films are still much much better than most of the tripe out there. Maybe because I could see where he stole so mucg of the stuff from, or maybe I just prefer real world settings for films. I loved parts of it and I loved the soundtrack. I think there could've been more blood. I'd read so much, I was really expecting them to go to town.
B000056NX5|2.0|Jesus Christ Superstar is somewhat of a period piece. The style of the music reflects the time period in which it was written. To try to revive it in the 21st Century, it just does not work.  1973 was the perfect time to make JCS into a movie. The style of rock mixed with opera was a fad during the 1970's. Although the music stands the test of time and is still AMAZING, this movie trys to throw a contemporary twist on Superstar and it ends up blowing up in everyone's face.  Herod is portrayed as a Frank Sinatra look-alike in a tuxedo, while the Jewish mob is portrayed as a LA street gang. Through this Broadway version, the original setting of &quot;Isreal in 4 BC&quot; is lost. There is no sign of Jesus' real homeland. Glenn Carter is a mediocre Jesus and does not show the turmoil and emotion of the character as Ted Neeley did in the 1973 movie version. Plus Ted Neeley could sing circles around Glenn Carter. Wow Ted Neeley was phenominal. Skip this version and buy the old version instead. Some musicals should be not be revived and Jesus Christ Superstar is one of them.
B00005JMUA|2.0|very long drawn out lifeless film with SOME good parts. The worst thing is they tease you with this great possible ending by mentioning this showdown on the beach under the moonlight, but they don't deliver. The actual ending sucks. Carradine may be old but I'm sure they could've got around it and had him in some good action sequences. Overall I left the film dissapointed.
B000063DFN|5.0|I'm most partial to this album since it was the album that really got me to absolutely love Iron Maiden. Powerslave was released at the hight of their career (they would soon embark on the World Slavery Tour, which of course gave us the famous \\"Live After Death\\" album). What can be said. The guitarwork, the vocals, the lyrics, everything is incredible. I won't go on about how great it is, because I wouldn't do the album justice. If you have heard it, you know what I'm talking about. If you haven't, check it out immediately.
0380977788|5.0|I'm amazed by all the mixed reviews over Neil Gaiman's young adult novel, \\"Coraline\\".  When I read this book about a year ago, I wondered how much enjoyment a horror story for children would appeal to someone who was about to turn 23.  Now, I crave such stories.<br />Coraline is perhaps what Disney's \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" would have been, had Alice stumbled upon a world of demons and fiends where there's no guaranteed happily ever after for the unfortunate heroines who had stumbled there before.  <br />Coraline, a precocious and intuitive young girl finds a portal into a mirror world of the new house she and her family recently moved into.  There, the setting is a treacherous and dark (almost gothic?) world, that is populated by chanting mice, a talking cat, villainous monsters in place of the normal world's inhabitants and other oddities with the density of the cliched haunted house and the theatrics of a brilliant and original horror writer.  To replace Lewis Carrol's infamous Jabberwocky, Coraline encounters the Bedlam, an evil spirit posing as Coraline's \\"other mother\\", who imprisons the souls of other children.  <br />What makes this story most appealing, to both a young audience and an older one, is Coraline embodies the true spirit of a heroine.  She is an ordinary little girl and at the same time extraordinary due to her bravery and determination to save her parents and free the previous victims of the Bedlam.  She challenges the creature in her own game and braves through each corridor of alternative universe, with plenty of suspense and action that will have the proudest reader honestly concerned for the narrator.  <br />This book is brilliant, creepy and inspiring.  If you're a parent who is trying to convince your child that reading is fun ... this is an excellent book to begin with as it will keep a child in suspense without provoking severe nightmares or including any vulgarities and gore.  Though I hate to say this, but after seeing the Harry Potter and Lord of Rings adaptations, I honestly hope that Hollywood will invest in Coraline as their next successful film project.
B00003CXAE|1.0|As an Australian I find this movie extremely offensive. Why should Sandie have to change and become a greasy fat rude American. She should haved stay the way she was I reckon.<br />There's a line in this movie about eating sh*t...I agree.
0441003257|1.0|Calling Neil Gaiman... Calling Neil Gaiman.... Where is Neil Gaiman? After reading much of Neil Gaiman's work, I seem to have stumbled upon what has to have been one of the worst novels I have ever had the displeasure of reading. Neil Gaiman, Clive Barker and many others have a knack for writing that makes you want to take the day off work just to keep reading. However, this novel was predictable, dull, and devoid of all characteristics that would make most of us want to keep reading.<br />It has been some time since I have been compelled to write a review of a book, but I hope that this review can save even just one more person from wasting their time and money. Do yourself a favour and pick up ANY of Neil Gaiman's other work (WHICH IS FABULOUS I MUST SAY!), but leave this on the bookseller's shelf to collect dust rather than your own. They should give these away free!
B00021R7CG|4.0|&quot;By Dawn's Early Light,&quot; an HBO film based on the novel &quot;Trinity's Child&quot; by William Prochnau, holds the honorable distinction of being the final cold war nuclear armageddon thriller. Released in 1990 a mere year before the collapse of the Soviet Union, the film clearly harkens back to such memorable thrillers as &quot;Fail Safe,&quot; &quot;Dr. Strangelove,&quot; &quot;The Day After,&quot; and &quot;Testament.&quot; Remember those halcyon days when we all lived under the threat of nuclear annihilation? When the Looking Glass plane flew over your house every twenty minutes or so? Well, I do. Nuclear doomsday thrillers really turn my stomach into knots because I lived, and still live, in Omaha, Nebraska. As you will see in the movie, the Strategic Air Command (SAC) sat in Bellevue, Nebraska, mere miles from my home. Those planes roaring overhead while I played in the yard were the aircraft responsible for keeping the national chain of command viable in the event of a Soviet missile attack. We always wondered what we would see first: the vapor trails of the incoming missiles or the flash. Either way it would have been the last thing we would see. Watching these movies now is sort of a trip down memory lane, albeit a horrific one. Films like &quot;By Dawn's Early Light&quot; still tie my stomach up in knots.<br />The nightmare here begins when the Soviet Union, wracked by internal dissolution, suddenly comes under attack by a group of rogue military officers hoping to force the high command to respond to internal threats. A nuclear missile wipes out a city near the Turkish border, and the Russian computer system orders up a limited launch on the United States before the leadership can stop it. Several missiles rain down on American military bases, including Andrews outside of Washington, D.C., SAC in Nebraska (See? I told you so), and a few other places around the country. The generals urge the president (Martin Landau) to reply with a full retaliatory response, but the chief executive hesitates. Then he receives a message from the Soviet premier expressing horror at the mistake and offering three options. The first is to simply ignore the attack. The second is to launch an assault on Russia similar to the one made on the United States. The third is to reply with overwhelming force, which will require the Soviets to do the same. Trusting the Russians is a tough decision, but the president wishes to avoid all out destruction. Perhaps global destruction will not occur when the president decides to follow the second option. Then, disaster strikes.<br />The president's chopper goes down somewhere over Maryland in the flash of a nuclear bomb. Our government, which cannot find the vice-president or many cabinet members, finally locates the Secretary of the Interior (Darrin McGavin) in Louisiana and declares him president as they load him on the E-4 plane. Known by the code name Condor, the new president is an unapologetic hawk that won't hesitate to escalate the war. Despite the advice of &quot;Harpoon&quot; (Jeffrey DeMunn), an admiral who always preaches restraint but who must ultimately give the president nuclear authorization codes if ordered, Condor falls in with Colonel Fargo's (Rip Torn) line of thinking. This guy advocates a &quot;grand tour&quot; of the Soviet Union, a plan that will use American bombers to vaporize Soviet leadership installations. Of course, this course of action will result in a massive strike on American cities. Also in the mix is the Looking Glass plane-helmed by &quot;Alice&quot; (James Earl Jones)-another back up command aircraft that must carry out the president's orders. Too, we follow the crew of a bomber as it prepares to sweep into the Soviet Union. Flown by Major Cassidy (Powers Boothe) and Captain Moreau (Rebecca DeMornay), the crew of this bomber undergoes several crises both physical and mental as they prepare to nuke their targets. &quot;By Dawn's Early Light&quot; exclusively focuses on the military and the national chain of command and how the two would work together to respond to a nuclear attack.<br />I first saw the film on cable when it originally aired. I thought it wonderful at the time, a taut, dramatic thriller that had me on the edge of my seat. A recent viewing allowed me to step back and analyze the finer points of the film. I still think it works, especially the hair raising conclusion, but there are numerous problems to contend with. I took exception with a map that showed SAC south of Plattsmouth, Nebraska when the base actually sits due north of that town. I also had difficulty believing the bomber crews sat on the ground for as long as they did. Harpoon even mentions later that most of the bombers were caught on the ground. Why? The head of SAC even says in the film that the nuke aimed at the base won't hit the ground for twenty some minutes. If we can't get our bombers in the air within half an hour, we are in big trouble. Too, other problems plague the film. Continuity errors, poor acting on the part of DeMornay, and mediocre editing brings the movie down a bit in my estimation. Still, the positives outweigh the negatives. The inclusion of James Earl Jones in the cast is probably a sly wink to &quot;Dr. Strangelove,&quot; and Darren McGavin and Rip Torn do a great job as the dynamic duo willing to turn the world into a charcoal briquette.<br />The DVD is unfortunately a disappointment. The picture quality is flawed, there are no extras-not even a trailer-anywhere to be found, and the transfer is fullscreen. HBO discs, at least the ones I have seen, usually don't have much in the way of extras. Fortunately, the movie is good enough to overcome a dearth of goodies.

B0002F6BRE|5.0|I thought it would be hard for Will Ferrell to top his hilarious performance in Old School.  I thought wrong.  Ever since I first saw this movie in the theaters last year, I have been waiting for this DVD to come out.  This is proof that Mr. Ferrel can carry a whole movie on his charisma alone.  My friends and I went into the movie not expecting much (not unlike Old School), but we walked out in tears, holding our sides from laughter.  <BR>Not gonna say no more 'cause I don't want to inflate anyone's expectations, but I did love this movie.  I'm not surprised that they waited till the holiday months to release it, but I did wish they would have done it sooner.  <BR>Prepare for a full 95 minutes of lunacy (that is, if you can stand Will Ferrell for that long, which I can).  Enjoy!  : )
B00005OWEG|5.0|We have all heard about the difficulties Francis Ford Coppola experienced during the creation of what will be the movie he is most remembered for, 1979's \\"Apocalypse Now\\": A typhoon wiped out his sets in Asia. Star Martin Sheen suffered a minor heart attack during filming. Marlon Brando was Marlon Brando. The film's portrayal of war as madness often mirrored the problems involved in filming an epic about America's involvement in the Vietnam conflict. Until \\"Apocalypse Now Redux\\" arrived on the scene a year or two ago, we never saw the full cut of the film. Well, \\"Redux\\" still doesn't contain everything since Coppola supposedly lensed miles of film stock, but this version contains several brand new sequences as well as extensions of existing scenes not seen in the original. Coppola supposedly stated that his film, \\"Isn't about the Vietnam War; It IS the Vietnam War.\\" As far as I know, the director never fought in that conflict, so this claim is spurious at best. What you will get from the film, though, is an immersion in the blackest of nightmares through the performances of some of the finest actors in Hollywood. \\"Apocalypse Now\\" in any form is a must see picture.<br />Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) is probably not the best person suited for a top-secret mission. When we first see the man, he is in a hotel room in Saigon slowly going mad, the stresses of war having taken a terrible toll on his mental and physical being. His mission, if he chooses to accept it, is to track down a military officer named Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) and terminate him \\"with extreme prejudice.\\" It seems the good colonel went insane up in the jungle, built up a mercenary army, began transmitting bizarre rants about snails crawling on the edge of a razor, and thus threatens the American war effort. The high command cannot have an officer carrying out his own warped whims in the bush, so Willard is to go up the Mekong River in a patrol boat and track Kurtz down. The captain accepts the order, obviously, and thus begins a journey into the darkest corners of Vietnam. During the lengthy trip, Willard reads extensively from Kurtz's military files, learning that his target once represented one of America's best and brightest soldiers, a man educated at top universities whose career track was paved with gold. How could such a brilliant man go completely over the edge? Willard tries to figure it all out.<br />Captain Willard has plenty of time to ponder the enigmatic Kurtz during the trip. The boat sails into one bizarre scene after another, some fraught with peril while others are just plain strange. Willard and the crew briefly spend time with the hyper macho Colonel Kilgore (Robert Duvall), an officer in the Air Cavalry who likes to blare Wagner's \\"Ride of the Valkyries\\" over his helicopter gunship's speakers while reducing a Vietcong stronghold to rubble. It is Duvall's character that utters the immortal line \\"I love the smell of napalm in the morning\\" as he urges his men to surf the ocean waves in a combat zone. The weirdness doesn't stop here, as Willard and his crew witness a show put on by Playboy Playmates at a riverside supply depot, visit a plantation proudly maintained by a French family, and stumble over an isolated river bridge under constant enemy bombardment defended by American soldiers with no idea who is in charge. The final showdown between Kurtz and Willard is not only the most powerful sequence in the film; it is one of the most intriguing parts of any film ever made.<br />It is no secret \\"Apocalypse Now\\" closely mirrors Joseph Conrad's novella \\"Heart of Darkness.\\" Too, Coppola's film is so obviously an attempt to show how the war permanently altered America's self-perception that I don't need to spend time discussing that theme. What has always drawn me so deeply into this movie is the acting, of course, but also the \\"madness\\" of Colonel Kurtz. Is the rogue officer really insane? By what standards? According to what we saw on the journey up the river, can we call what Kurtz is doing insane? I don't think so. As much as we might cringe at the colonel's \\"horror and moral terror\\" speech, anyone with an ounce of sense should realize that that is exactly how a nation should fight a war. Rules and laws developed in civilization must automatically fly out the window when the soldiers march off to battle. Kurtz recognizes America will lose the war because his country burdens its soldiers with pointless rules-like not allowing pilots to paint an offensive word on the side of aircraft, for example. You see the same thing in Oliver Stone's \\"Platoon\\" when an officer rambles on about an \\"illegal killing,\\" as though you can place an arbitrary value hierarchy on what goes on in a war zone and still think about winning. War is screaming, mind-shattering insanity, not a game with strictly defined parameters that any one side should follow. Kurtz is \\"mad\\" because his training prevents him from embracing the Vietnamese conception of the \\"moral\\" soldier.<br />If you haven't seen this movie, what are you waiting for? \\"Redux\\" adds nearly an hour to the film's original runtime, the picture quality looks great, and Coppola's beast contains the best dialogue in cinematic history. My favorite line in the film? Anything Kurtz utters, but especially the \\"moral terror\\" speech and his response to Willard's adamant claims about being a soldier instead of an assassin: \\"You're neither. You're an errand boy sent by grocery clerks to collect a bill.\\" Moreover, you get to see plenty of actors show off their stuff, including Harrison Ford, G.D. Spradlin, Dennis Hopper, Laurence Fishburne, and Frederic Forrest. You need to move this one up to the top of your list immediately.rney up the river, can we call what Kurtz is doing insane?

0385335482|4.0|Of the most reviewed books that I've read in the chick-lit genre, this is my favorite so far. The heroine is undoubtedly shallow and somewhat unscrupulous, but if I'd liked her any better I'd have had heart seizure every time she walked into another embarrassing situation. The best feature about this book, in my opinion, was that it was neatly structured. The increasing tension was well orchestrated, and the characters (other than the Hooray-Henries) were likeable and (other than Rebecca) believable. Unlike with some of the American chick-lit writers I've read, I felt I was in the hands of a pro.
B00003CXCT|1.0|Jazzman, here's a novel idea...<BR>Why not put both the originals and the special editions on DVD? That way, the originals can also be in a \\"format that will not deteriorate\\" and will provide for \\"better picture\\" and \\"better audio\\" viewing. Everyone will be happy. Original and expanded (special edition) versions are now available for the Alien movies and I don't see why the same can't be done to the Star Wars trilogy. Would you pay for leather bound books of re-worded and re-characteriezed Shakespearean plays that are being passed off as collector editions? I hope not.
1400034779|4.0|When Precious Ramotswe's father dies and leaves her an inheritance, she uses it to buy a house and to start a detective agency.  Business is slow at first, but as her reputation for solving difficult cases continues to spread, Precious begins to have more cases.  The author depicts his heroine as a wise woman whose intuition leads her to creative solutions to the puzzles posed to her by clients.  Whether it's tracking down a cheating husband or pursuing a witch doctor to rescue a kidnapped boy, Precious uses creative, yet straight-forward methods to solve her cases.  This is a charming series which entertains and also informs the reader about a culture which is unfamiliar to many Americans.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Those who have the Trilogy on VHS and have thus watched them to the point of meltdown obviously understand the need for a reliable medium such as DVD. Not to mention superior sound environment, bonus features, commentary, etc. This is too good to pass up, despite all of us knowing the excessive marketing ploys excercised by Lucas and Gang.<br />I'm not gonna get bent out of shape expecting potentially radical changes to cinematography and the exploitation of the resources he now has in his hands as compared to some odd twenty-five to thirty years ago. Anyone who is buying this *knows* how the films went and what he or she enjoyed about them. These DVDs will give me the chance to watch something \\"new\\" from the original releases. It's no secret George embraces film technology so much he often will neglect the drama and/or story in favor of pushing the visual envelope.<br />I would rather see what he can do to improve an already classic and familiar Trilogy than resort to watching Episodes 1 and 2.
B000056H7W|5.0|Blackwater Park is an album of amalgamation and perfection, not just for Opeth but for metal as a whole. Until this point, Opeth had been carving out a niche of their own in the world of heavy music, with releases like the stunning 'My arms, Your hearse' or 'Still Life'. But Blackwater Park truly is a 'monumetal mark' to quote the title track, not just in terms of a vision fully realised, bit in terms of finally eliminating any barriers that might be left to the band to take their music onto a new level.<br /> What is immediately apparent upon listening to the opener 'The Leper Affinity' is not just the seamlessness, the perfected ebb and flow of the music, but the incredible comfort with which this supremely talented band approaches music of extreme complexity. Much of this crystal clear, coherent sound can be laid, I believe, at the door of genius producer Steven Wilson, of Porcupine Tree fame. The vocal harmonies have certainly bear his influence, and by God, this record sees some of the best vocal parts they've yet laid down on tape, from the hypnotic mid section of 'Bleak' to the heartbreaking chorus of 'Harvest'. 'Blackwater park' sees the band stretching its creative muscles like never before. Each song has its own distinctive stamp, and each is filled with reams of immaculate ideas and intelligent execution. 'Bleak' has a unique, middle Eatern tinged riff, 'Harvest' evokes sepia coloured autumn days perfectly, while 'The Drapery Falls' rides in on a lilting, melancholy melody that returns in its conclusion and draws tears to my eyes. But the culmination of the record comes in the practically transcendent title track, which surely merits a high water mark for what can be done with the metal genre. It is unrelenting, brutal but hopelessly delicate, the middle section representing acoustic perfection. The cataclysmic conclusion has to be heard to be believed.<br />  One aspect of the record which I've rarely seen commented on is the quality of Akerfeldt's lyrics. His grasp of imagery and his ability to match the words to the mood of the music are particularly immpressive. Worthy of note is the recurring theme of disease and purity, not the most original theme for a metal band, but tackled with real taste. Grotesque images like 'Lepers coiled beneath the trees' and 'perversions bloom(ing) round the bend' are effective in highlighting the dense, intertwined, ghastly nature of the music, while his smart use of natural imagery to paint his evil portraits around, (trees and flowers feature in the above lines) lead one into considering deeper themes of dangerous conempt for natural power, and our task to safeguard the natural world. A brief and obtuse reading of his poetry, perhaps, but a necessary one.<br /> A lanmark release, 'Blackwater park' is utterly obligatory for fans of this type of thing, but newcomers are highly recommnded to start here, with Opeth at least, as this record is very cleverly constructed to reveal layers of complexity beneath initial accessiblity. In fact it's the kind of record people will come back to in 20 years and say: 'That was the most important CD of its time'. The word for this kind of album is, of course, 'masterpiece'.His grasp of imagery and his ability to match the words to the mood of the music are particularly immpressive. Worthy of note is the recurring theme of disease and purity, not the most original theme for a metal band, but tackled with real taste. Grotesque images like 'Lepers coiled beneath the trees' and 'perversions bloom(ing) round the bend' are effective in highlighting the dense, intertwined, ghastly nature of the music, while his smart use of natural imagery to paint his evil portraits around, (trees and flowers feature in the above lines) lead one into considering deeper themes of dangerous conempt for natural power, and our task to safeguard the natural world. A brief and obtuse reading of his poetry, perhaps, but a necessary one.<BR> A lanmark release, 'Blackwater park' is utterly obligatory for fans of this type of thing, but newcomers are highly recommnded to start here, with Opeth at least, as this record is very cleverly constructed to reveal layers of complexity beneath initial accessiblity. In fact it's the kind of record people will come back to in 20 years and say: 'That was the most important CD of its time'. The word for this kind of album is, of course, 'masterpiece'.
B0001ZX0OW|5.0|This movie is absolutely riveting. There is really no other word to describe it. Sean Penn delivers the performance of a lifetime and Tim Robbins also is very good. This movie outlines a friendship that is pulled apart by a horrible abduction and then brought back together by a horrible murder. This movie, although it seems predictable, takes you to an ending that no one on this planet would foresee... I highly recommend this movie...PLEASE watch it!
B00005JMJ4|1.0|The most offensive movie I've seen in a long time--a film about a couple vapid, unsympathetic people surrounded by pathetic caricatures of vapid and unsympathetic people.  Maybe the movie was one big ironic joke...but it doesn't read that way.  I consider liking this movie a character flaw.
B00003CXA6|5.0|Everyone involved in the making of GETTYSBURG has absolutely every right to be proud of what they have contributed to our understanding of those three terrible days of fierce fighting during the Civil War. Under director Ronald Maxwell's unflinching yet sympathetic command, GETTYSBURG more than recreates the military strategies and errors that took place that summer in 1863. He puts a human face on the thinking and feeling of all those who took part in that conflagration.<br />All the performances are brilliant. In no particular order, Martin Sheen was perfect as the brooding, somber Robert E. Lee. Tom Berenger and Stephen Lang were compelling as Lt. General Longstreet and Maj. General Pickett, respectively. In what I believe was his final performance, Richard Jordan capped a terrific career as Brig. General Armistead. Even the extras were incredibly convincing!<br />But what is at the heart of this film is the truism that &quot;Heroes don't make history; history makes heroes&quot;--and nowhere is that belief more accurately expressed than in the plight of Colonel Joshua Chamberlain, as intensely portrayed by Jeff Daniels. Sorely outnumbered, actually absurdly outnumbered, Col. Chamberlain and his unit was given the daunting task of defending the Union's flank. A former schoolteacher, Chamberlain drew upon his training AND his knowledge of military history to outmanuever and outpsyche the enemy while, more importantly, keeping the morale of his own men in check. The result was a devestating blow to the Confederacy which marked a truning point in the battle and the war. Daniels was nothing less than flawless as Col. Chamberlain. And like I said before, just about everything else was remarkable, too.

0060090383|5.0|We all know that Marian Keyes writes wonderful, frothy, hilarious and somehow at the same time meaningful Brit Lit novels about Irish girls gone astray and getting it all together in the end. She is something of a genius of the genre.<br />&quot;Rachel's Holiday&quot; is not one of those books. Yes, it is written in the same style. Yes, some of the wording, the turns of phrase, the bon mots are side-splitting. Yes, Rachel is one of the loveable Brit Lit Irish girls--in this case, a Dubliner living in New York with her lifelong friend Brigit and an entire cast of memorable and hilarious characters. In fact, Rachel is a sister of Claire, the wonderful heroine of &quot;Watermelon&quot;--and those of us who read that gem know what a truly baroque family of five sisters Rachel and Claire belong to.<br />Here the similarity ends. For this is a serious and heart-wrenching story of addiction and its horrible aftermath. For loveable, sweet, funny and huggble Rachel, who thinks of herself as a typical recreational drug user on the New York social scene, is in fact an addict--slipping away from reality, slipping away from her friends' and her boyfriends' grasp--swirling deeper and deeper out of control.<br />As we follow the excrutiating progress of Rachel's descent from fun party girl to whacked-out user, we hear it all from her own point of view. I think this is the first time I have truly understood the powerful denial that rules the truly hooked. It is very frightening. And, like Brigit, Luke (the boyfriend) and others who love her, we cannot help but only watch in despair.<br />Most of the book takes place in The Cloisters, a rehab facility back in Dublin, which Rachel agrees to try only because she has a fantasy that it is loaded with rock stars and is something like an upscale spa (hence, her &quot;holiday&quot;). Instead, she is met with other addicts, from alcohol to drugs to gambling to food--and as she vigorously asserts that she is in the wrong place and &quot;nothing like them,&quot; in fact, as the reader can plainly see, she very much is.<br />Can Rachel accept the help and support of the counselors and fellow patients in rehab? Will she save her own life? We truly want her to do so, because from page one to the very end, she is a person about whom we care intensely, even during the times when we want to conk her over the head with a frying pan at her self-delusion.<br />I cannot recommend this book highly enough. My admiration for Keyes has tripled, and at this point, I consider her a serious author.ing like them,&quot; in fact, as the reader can plainly see, she very much is.<br />Can Rachel accept the help and support of the counselors and fellow patients in rehab?

B0000CFW87|5.0|I have never heard of Josh Groban until his song came on the radio one day while I was reading. His voice was profound, stunning and overall gorgeous. 'You Raise Me Up' instantly became one of my most favorite songs, and as I listened to his full CD, I became enthralled with all the different, beautiful languages he sung in. Many complain that it wasn't all sung in English- so? I find it very lovely to hear him sing in a different language than English. That's the whole point, to hear a different language and realize how captivating it is. I love the CD and am anticipating more of Josh's outstanding songs.
B00003CXE7|5.0|This is the most amazing sounding dvd I have ever in my life, that also includes the movies theaters. I have an 8.2 surround sound system with a yamaha rx-v3000 and a 10' dlp infocus projector. I literally felt like I was in the battle scenes. 5.1 dolby digital is ok and thx is a little better then dolby, but nothing compares to 6.1 dts es. I wish all dvd's sounded as good as this one. Then I would never have to spend another $12 at the movies again.
B00001ZT6Z|4.0|This is the deal. If you are a Black Sabbath purist and lean toward the Ozzy sound of the 70's or maybe even the Dio sound of the early 80's then this album is probably not for you. If you don't know much about Black Sabbath, and you have no preconceptions about what this album is, then buy this album. This came out in 1989. It does have some haunting lyrics and music that is chilling. The music is good and it is heavy. The dark references pile up as the album moves onward -- satan, Lucifer, prince of darkness, etc. I think the lyrics were a gimmick but you can't fault the music and the overrall production and feel of the album. This is one of the best Sabbath albums of the Tony Martin era, in my opinion. Their next effort, Tyr, is like a movie sequal and you really don't need to own one without the other because they flow together so well. After Tyr, the band brought Dio back for Dehumanizer which killed the momentum of the Tony Martin movement. Dehumanizer was heavier and was a geat album in its own right. Tony Martin came back after that for Cross Purposes and Forbidden.
0765310015|4.0|To say this 5 books series by Erikson is complicated is an understatement.  Finally release in the US, I picked up this book several years ago when I was travelling in Europe. And I proceded to purchase (at much cost) and read the other 3 books in the series.[i'm waiting for number 5 to be mailed out]<br /><br />Erikson creates a very complex world with unique races, gods, magic, and characters.  Picture this book as the first chapter in a (forecasted) 10 book series.  Unlike many current authors, the four books in the series have concurrent storylines, while confusing, adds meat to the overall story.  So while you might think Erikson glosses over plot lines in book one, they get explained in part in each succesive book.  A unique approach to writing a series.<br /><br />This is a brutal world that Erikson creates, where problems are not resolved in nice packages.<br /><br />The characters are all unique.  A good mixture of those coming of age, others developing powers they discover, and veterans doing everything they can to just survive.<br /><br />One of my favorite authors.<br /><br />Addednum: July 14,2005<br /><br />The new US cover art for his series does a terrible injustice to the phenomenal art work of the UK books.  Why they did not keep the original art must be political.<br /><br />Reading some of the other negative reviews, I wanted to re-iterate that this is not an easy book to read and you need to make the cognitive leap to figure out the magic warrens and plot lines but for those sick of the young boy farmer gaining great power to become the king and save the world storylines, this is the perfect antidote.
051788710X|1.0|First of all, if you're serious about out-of-body or lucid dreaming check out &quot;Astral Dynamics&quot; by Robert Bruce. That's the bible. Now, &quot;Conscious Dreaming&quot; consists of personal stories and some shamanic rituals, but lacks power techniques for advanced dreamers. Anyway it's ok for beginners, who seek motivation for out-of-body exploration. It's also recommended by Marc VanDeKeere in his excellent &quot;The Ultimate Lucid Dreamer's Manual: From Basics to Beyond&quot;.
B00009V7RF|5.0|I would HIGHLY reccomend the new elephunk album! I love it, theres not one song that i dont like on it! My all time favorite songs would have to be- The Boogie That Be, Shut-Up, Hey Mama and Latin Girls! So if you love the beps as much as i do, Go out and buy their new album!

B000002B7U|5.0|Thoughts about this 4th studio effort by Ozzy from 1986 have varied over time. This came out when i was 17 and was highly thought of at the time. I don't remember anyone thinking this album was glam or anything short of another strong edition to Ozzy's already solid library. This album had a theme built around the nuclear scare that people felt back in the Ronald Reagan era. Accept also had an album around that time called Russion Roulette which had the same message. In retrospect, it is wild to look back now and see that you had musicians from different countries (Accept being from Germany) who had the same concerns and sang about it. &quot;The Ultimate Sin,&quot; according to Ozzy was pushing the button to start nuclear war. The songs Killer of Giants, Thank God for the Bomb, and the title track are just a few that address this. I think this album is relatively heavy, the music is energetic, and it has substance. It makes you think and may leave you with a feeling of impending doom. It is not your basic Ratt and Motley Crue (though i love that too) stuff from that era that only talks about women and partying. Jake E. Lee is excellent on guitar and Randy Castillo makes his debut w/ Oz on drums. Maybe over the course of time and due to the rebirth that Ozzy had with No More Tears, this album has fallen in the Ozzy ratings but not on my list. This would be in my top ten 80's hard rock/metal albums. Don't miss this one. Also, wasn't this the coolest cover artwork?
B0000BXGCN|5.0|And I mean truly live, not as in &quot;live recording&quot;&gt;I got the marvelous opportunity to see Lara live at a small music house a couple of months ago, and it was one of, if not the most splendid,moving, involving live concerts I've ever been to.Even more surprising if you consider that I've never owned a single album from Fabian, and that the only guide I had were a couple of songs which I dubbed &quot;well-sung&quot;. Well, I gotta say, that Lara is a one in a million type of gal-and she blows those way past their prime divas mariah,whitney,celine,etc way out of the water.Because the moment she stepped out onto the stage,dressed in a modestly simple black dress,barefoot, with nothing but a grand piano, and a couple of excellent violinists accompanying her, when she stepped out onto the stage and opened her mouth to sing, it was obvious that here was a singer of the highest caliber-a real and true musician who had nothing more on her agenda but to sing her heart out and share her strong,beautiful voice through her expertise,emotive delivery.And I'll never,ever,ever forget the moment when her band walked off the stage,Lara dropped the microphone,dropped to the ground, clutching her heart, and simply SANG.I HAD tears in my eyes, my stomach hurt-I was simply wrenched.Well, I'll stop now, since I know how bad I'm making you all who have never had the chance to see Lara live feel(right), but after the concert was over, I bought this live disc.It's excellent, but it still dims when I think back to how INCREDIBLE she sounded in concert.But I guess if you never see her perform in actual concert then the impact of this live disc will be greater.Not to say that this disc isn't good-its wonderful, and she sounds spectacular(but nowhere near how INCREDIBLE how she sounded live...ok, I'll shut up now).<br />If you love music which falls under a genre called simply beautiful music then you simply cannot fall in love with this subtley beautiful disc.Every number is sublime-Lara's delivery is wondrous-she has the voice that every diva can dream of, but unlike many other singers who shout for all its worth, Lara knows that subtlety can pay off big time; she never milks her vocals for all their worth and focuses more on trnascending emotion and meaning and feeling than showing off how many notes she can sing per minute-and believe me that she has every right to do that, with her range and prowess and whatnot.<br />This whole CD is in French, and I don't speak a word, but,(and this is a true testament to Lara's power as a singer) I feel every word coming from her mouth-I genuinely feel lifted by her,I repeat beautiful singing, and deeply felt deliverance.And if you like fast,brash and loud music which is the equivalent of the modern American blockbuster, well, you definately will not find it here.Every song is a slow ballad with nothing more than piano, and the occational swelling string accompanying it.And even if you're not like me, and you prefer more upbeat music, I believe that you will nonetheless be able to fall in love with En Toute Entime because the music is as stunning,melodicaly lyrical and richly emotive as they come.And if you associate the word ballad with Mariah and Whitney, think again, because Lara has a much quieter,much more subtle approach.Not a single number is overblown, or melodramatic-and the accompaniment is a wonderful melodic counterpart and helps reveal the music's beauty even more.If you're familiar with Charles Aznavour or French chanson, then that should give you a clue as to how the music sounds.And even though every song is a slow tempo one, don't be fooled.Every song is different from the last; there are quite a few remakes, and even an opera number which Lara pulls of with breathtaking ease.<br />I won't blab anymore.If you like good music, then get this album and drown in its simpleness,its beauty,it sweet sublimity and soulfulness; and Lara's awe-inspiring vocal talent/And(and I don't care if you'venever heard of her in your life), if you have to sell your soul, you HAVE to see this woman live.I can't express how incredible that experience will be.Lara is so good-she serves as more proof that, just as with film nowadays, whilst some tripe gets played out,awarded, and talked about, the truly inspiring,breathtaking, and unforgettable talent that real artistic lovers are searching for are to be found far away from the mainstream world.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|What can i say this is so much better than let go, it has amzin songs which are soo much more mature.<BR>My fave songs are together, fall to pieces and my happy ending.<BR>Even if your not a fan of Avrils i reccomend you buy this cd.<BR>I LOVE YA AVS!

0671027387|3.0|This book sucks the reader in and doesn't let go.  Plausibility defines CAN it happen, not is it LIKELY to happen...which means that this plot is possible.  Obviously this book is not rich with literary merit, however it is perfect for the pleasure reader that likes to become mesmerized by action and suspense, and enjoys the mystery of details being unraveled a little at a time.  The author did as he intended...entertained.
0140177396|3.0|Of Mice and Men is a story about a man named George and his mentally disabled friend Lennie. Lennie gets into trouble because he loves to pet soft things, but he doesn't know his own strength, and George has to bail him out all the time. Lennie causes harm but he honestly and truly doesn't mean to harm anything, but in the end it costs him a lot.<br />I can relate to George in a way. I have had to resume responsibility for a family member. She was younger than me, and we were close, so I felt like I had a responsibility to act in her best interest. This is the same way George feels about Lennie. He feels responsible for Lennie's actions.<br />What I like most about this book is how there are different types of conflicts. For instance, Crooks had conflicts with the other men because he was black; meanwhile, George has conflicts with himself; he was faced with different problems that only he can solve. For instance, he has to decide for himself how to deal with Lennie. No one can help George with Lennie because they don't know how to handle Lennie. They don't understand him like George.  If I could change something about this book I would add more details when major things are happening. For example, I would add more details to the incident that happened with Curley's wife. The author says \\"she struggled violently under his hands. I would have used a metaphor like, \\"she struggled like a mouse trying to escape the grasp of a lion\\" to make the piece more colorful and exciting. I would have used more similes and metaphors to make it more visual and powerful.<br />I recommend people read this book. It has a lot of good conflicts, foreshadowing, and morals. If you are a person who likes stories about friendships, dilemmas, and morals, you will like Of Mice and Men.
0765310015|5.0|This review is partly written in the direction of the person that gave this book 1 star.  He states that portions of the book leave us 'in the dark'.  And that point is EXACTLY why this book, and the rest of the series, is so original.  You shouldn't have to have every slice of a story explained to you.<br />To completely flesh out and explain every type of magic or every god that appears would remove the mystery and wonder that makes up this book.  Did Houdini explain all his tricks as he was performing them?  Did we even want to know?  In fantasies I take magic for what it is, a wonderous powerful event that you should either hide from, or wield against your enemies.<br />And so what if there are magicians that can wipe out a host of soldiers, the ecosystem of a war needs more than just magicians throwing their bolts of lightning, it needs armies to hold the lands, to provide defense for the magicians and to help keep in power the rulers that command said magicians.  If this were true, in World War II we would have ditched the ground campaign and just rained bombs on the Germans day and night.<br />Novels that, so far,  has 5 books in its series(and more to come) must have some sort of fan following and deserves much more than 1 sad little star.<br />I've read GOTM, thoroughly enjoyed it and am reading it again.  I give it 5 stars and would highly recommend it to anyone that truly enjoys fantasy of the highest caliber (Tolkien, Martin).<br />Oh, and start ordering this book and show Tor, who originally did not want to release this book in the US (because they thought it was too 'complex' for the american reader), that the american reader is intelligent and has a wide range of tastes, and is very able to handle a work fantasy of the highest order(like our british counterparts).
0380973634|4.0|I'm a fan of Gaiman's work on Sandman, but held back from reading his novels. Often, good comic writers can't translate into prose form .... but Gaiman is certainly an exception to that rule. This novel has excellent plotting, dialogue, and characterization. Which  I expected - what I didn't expect was the detail in the descriptions, and just the plain great prose.<br />This is a very good fantasy novel which contains a world and characters that have some true depth. I highly recommend it.
B000002BHE|5.0|I admit I got burned on a couple of Celine's earliest albums--where only one song was really good.  But this has to be Celine's best album--every single song is great! Put it on, chill out and enjoy! <br />What's also interesting is that the 3rd most popular song in France of the last 15 years (Pour que tu m'aimes encore) is on this album as &quot;Whatever it Takes&quot; (It's got a slightly different slant, but it's just as good in French! If you'd like to hear the French version, it's on the &quot;French Album&quot; here at Amazon.com--USA, and it's on the original album, called &quot;D'eux&quot; at Amazon.com.fr.)<br />Bottom line: Whether she sings in English or French, whether the listener is American, Canadian, French, Swiss, Belgian, or whatever, Celine has universal appeal!
B00020HEG6|5.0|I was personally getting a bit tired of the same old Harry Potter theme, and was relieved that the familiar melody didn't play until about halfway through the new film.<br />This is an awesome soundtrack, without a doubt, the best one yet. It's edgier, it works beautifully with the film, and is just plain awesome. I especially like the addition of the &quot;Double Double Toil and Trouble&quot; song, even if it's not in the book. It makes for a fantastic addition to the soundtrack and the film as well.<br />Highly recommended for fans of musical scores, the movie, the book, or whatever. Wonderful!
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Im a 16yr old lisiner of Avril.  And let me say this cd is far better then her first.  The songs on this cd are more meaningful then her first.  The best songs on here are &quot;nobodys home&quot; and &quot;my happy ending&quot; and &quot;fall to pieces&quot;
0684800713|1.0|I must say that I am a fan of books of all types, and very rarely do I find one that I just can't follow.  I actually checked this one out of the library on book on tape.  This is my favorite way to get through commute times and excersize times, and I go through books on tape like they were candy.  Rarely have I found a book I couldn't even follow on tape.  However, this was one.<br />There doesn't seem to be a real plot to this book.  It rambles on and on about people wandering all over Europe, mostly drunk or trying to get drunk, but nothing ever really seems to happen.  I will not judge Hemmingway on this one work, as it is supposed to be about the \\"lost generation\\", but listening to it made me feel like I was \\"lost\\".  I also just couldn't tolerate the bigotry prevalant in the writing.  While I can step away from a classic piece of literature and say \\"hey, that was then, this is now...\\" when it comes to cultural attitudes, this book, with its lack of plot, made the speach about the \\"nigger\\" fighter stand out as the only section I remembered.<br />I will not be recommending this book to anyone.  I think it will be a while before I can attempt another Hemmingway novel.
0316921173|4.0|&quot;Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio: a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy...&quot;<br />-from Hamlet, by William Shakespeare<br />In this gargantuan novel, Infinite Jest is the title of a movie so enthralling it leaves viewers mesmerized, unwilling to wrest their gaze from the screen. Audiences don't care about anything else, and literally die of pleasure (the descendant of Monty Python's Killing Joke, perhaps?).<br />Infinite Jest (the novel) is set approximately two decades in the future, and deals with a society obsessed with entertainment and amusement. The former NAFTA states have been reorganized as the Organization of North American Nations, or ONAN. The President of the United States, the titular leader of ONAN, is a somnambulant ex-crooner named Johnny Gentle, who's most original idea is to offer large corporations sponsorship opportunities-thus, each year is now named for a commercial product, resulting in the Year of the Whopper, the Year of the Trial Size Dove Bar, and the Year of the Depend Adult Undergarment, during which most of the novel is set.<br />ONAN is under siege from wheelchair bound Quebecois terrorists, who are pissed that their province is now used as a toxic waste dump (the waste is hurled there from Massachusetts by giant catapults). Their master plan: obtain a copy of the lethal movie (code named &quot;the Entertainment&quot;), and make it available for the mass consumption of the largely lethargic American populace.<br />Searching for the master copy of the film, the terrorists focus on the sons of the film's deceased autuer, J. O. Incandenza, Jr. (who committed suicide by sticking his head in a specially rigged microwave oven shortly after completing the film). Icandenza's progeny are Orin, a skirt chasing professional football player, Mario, mentally deficient and physically deformed, and Hal, a brainy tennis star at the Enfield Tennis Academy, an institution his father founded before embarking on his film career.<br />The majority of the action in the novel takes place at the Enfield Academy and at Ennet House, a rehab center located just down the block from the tennis school. These institutions yield dozens of humorous asides and a plethora of quirky, memorable characters. Enfield provides opportunities to comment on celebrity and obsession, while Ennet House gives Wallace a chance to hold forth on addiction, self control, and Alcoholics Anonymous.<br />Wallace's primary theme is that America is slowly amusing itself to death. Obsessed with entertainment and self gratification, America is sliding into the abyss. Are there answers to this dilemma? Wallace seems to think so, constantly emphasizing the need to balance freedom with authority (his admiration for AA is obvious). Yet, he demonstrates that no answer is perfect: witness Lenz, in rehab to kick a drug habit, responding to the rigid structure of AA by killing domestic animals (you'll never hear the word &quot;There&quot; again without thinking of him).<br />Reading Infinite Jest is an ambitious undertaking. Don't be intimidated by its size (the hardcover weighed in at 3.3 pounds)-just be sure to set aside a few weeks to get through the thing. An unabridged dictionary and Physician's Desk Reference will also come in handy, as five dollar vocabulary words and pharmacological references abound. (And I haven't even mentioned the footnotes.) The original manuscript was reportedly some 300-500 pages longer and in need of severe editing, which may explain why the narrative just seems to end. The abrupt ending need not discourage you, however, as obsessive readers have reported that the novel is recursive, appropriate in light of its title.<br />Witty and deep, Infinite Jest is science fiction in the vein of John Barth's Giles Goat Boy or Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse Five, a massive showcase for Wallace's writing talent, intelligence, and oddball sense of humor. Is it the great American Novel? Beats me. Some critics compare it to Thomas Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow, but they say that about any book over 600 pages that you actually have to think about (I find it ironic that critics cite a book few have read to explain a book that even fewer will have the patience to read). Is it funny, erudite? Yes. Is it worthy of your attention? Most definitely. But be warned, Wallace's writing is as addictive as the movie Infinite Jest-- you may experience withdrawal pains upon finishing.pare it to Thomas Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow, but they say that about any book over 600 pages that you actually have to think about (I find it ironic that critics cite a book few have read to explain a book that even fewer will have the patience to read).

B0000DD7LB|5.0|This album is truly fantastic.  There isn't 1 song that you need to skip over, with the possible exception of the remix at the end.  Britney really impressed me with such a good album, I never expected it from her.  It's a really fun pop album, but it also has some really beautiful mellow tracks.  Touch of my hand sounds like something off of Madonna's &quot;Ray of Light,&quot; but better.  It's truly brilliant and the best song on the album.  Other great tracks include Breathe on Me, Toxic, Everytime, and Outrageous.  Pick up a copy, I'm sure you'll really enjoy this album as much as I do.
B0000CC5CS|3.0|The movie was going great (worth watching) but just don't get the ending, that's all. Part II and III is MORE worthy. <BR> Anyway the movie is about a robot wanting to stop a evil robot from killing humans, while some couple of the people (humans) has to try prevent Judgement Day to happened.
0515123447|5.0|I must agree with some of the other reviews that the book contains minor quirks, excessive shrugging, and continual short, choppy sentences.  However, the plot was one of the best that I have read in years.  I only wish I had picked this up when it was originally published, because I now have some catching up to do with the Reacher series.
0805028846|4.0|This book is simply amazing. Using only a sheet of paper, a hobby knife, and this book, you can create some very beautiful work.<br />The Pauls who wrote the book give clear directions for making a wide variety of different popups, using a variety of different folding techniques. They start simple, just single cuts and simple folds. They work up to some mind-boggling creations; those require significant precision and care.<br />Directions are in the form of patterns, ready to transfer from the book to your own paper. That could be a problem for some people. The patterns are shown reduced in size, and in somewhat schematic form. When multiple pieces of paper are involved, it takes a bit mechanical insight to figure out just how each piece fits each other - the directions aren't always explicit.<br />The directions are clear enough, though. With a little work, you should be able to put most of these patterns together, then start improvising on your own. Of course, you can add whatever illustration or decoration you want - the structure is just the beginning of your finished piece.<br />You'll find clear directions for projects of graded complexity. There's probably something here for everyone. Go ahead, have fun with them!

B00004Z400|5.0|Deftones- &quot; White Pony&quot;<BR>  <BR>  I remember it was in 2000 that I was on my way home from working construction and the radio was on. The DJ gave a little intro and then played Change. I remember being floored and getting goose bumps . I didn't want the song to end it was so addicting. <BR>  I bought the cd a little later . Then I saw them in Pheonix Az at The Celibrity Theater. THE BEST CONCERT I'VE EVER SEEN. Chino was all over the place. When we got there all the good places were taken so I was like this sucks, but then Chino came up the railing and sang 2 or 3 songs right infront of us and. He was right there giving everyone high 5's and connecting with the crowd. Life Changing for sure. My buddy Matt was patting him on the back and kick'n it right next to Him. When I say close, I mean like right in front of our faces. It was crazy.<BR>  Well sorry for giving a huge story there. On to the review:<BR> <BR>     Back to school  5/5   :awesome song, they purpose went for the whole high school thing as a poke fun at those kind of bands that try to stratigically sell to the nerds and &quot; picked on Kids&quot;.<BR>    <br />   Just buy the CD.
B00005I44H|5.0|At full price this set of Mozart Concertos was arguably the top choice available (penguin guide giving the set its highest rating) This current re-issue at mid-price is an absolute steal. Some may have reservations regarding the removal of program notes, but in truth these are rarely if ever read and are therefore unncessary anyway. Besides, one can access a vast amount of information about these concertos in books or off the Internet if required.<br />In my oppinion this is the most credible set of Mozart piano concertos available and should form a firm place in every classical music lovers collection.
B00005BJ9W|5.0|I give this album top rating mainly for Hungry Like The Wolf and the original studio version of Save A Prayer.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|There are soooo many great songs on this album, I can't believe it! I bought it because I loved Toxic and I didn't really expect to like much else.  Boy was I proven wrong!  I don't think there is 1 song on the entire album that I dislike.  &quot;Breathe on Me&quot; is an absolutely amazing track, along with &quot;Touch of My Hand.&quot;  There's also some really great upbeat urban pop songs like &quot;Outrageous&quot; and &quot;(I Got That) Boom Boom&quot; and a beautiful ballad, &quot;Everytime.&quot;  There is so much to like on &quot;In the Zone,&quot; I guarantee it will surprise you!
0553260111|4.0|Setting the standard for international spy thrillers, Robert Ludlum succeeds again at packing more thrills into several hundred pages than one would conceive possible. With a neo-gothic setting that adds just the right ambiance for a shadowy spy tale, the book has every detail that could be wished for in a novel of this genre. A page-turner all the way through, the action, in this book, picks up almost immediately and doesn't let off until nearly the last page. The characters are also, by Ludlum's standards, remarkably well developed. Jason Bourne, the protagonist, suffers from none of the usual invulnerability that plagues most of most of Ludlum's protagonists. Bourne is an exceptional agent whose exploits will entertain you, but his failures and faults keep him human. Bourne, and his female companion's emotions add a further touch of humanity that is often missing from many spy novels and most of Ludlum's other work. My only criticism of the book's characters would be of the unlikely love connection between Bourne and his girlfriend. However, besides for the initial stretch of why the girl would fall for Bourne, the rest of the relationship is the most realistic to be found in Ludlum's works.<br />Readers of Ludlum's other works who have noticed the consistent pattern in nearly all of Ludlum's plots will be pleasantly surprised to find that this story bears little resemblance to the usual redundant theme. Where most off Ludlum's works feature a nearly all powerful military-industrial conspiracy for world domination as the antagonist, this book differs significantly with a much more realistic tale of two spies pitted against each other. The journey of self-discovery undertaken by the main character is nearly as important as the main adventure, adding further to the books realism. Unfortunately the book's more down to earth tone detracts from the climax. Instead the usual explosive Ludlum finish, I was left feeling slightly unsatisfied. Nevertheless, the book's overall novelty left me feeling more fulfilled than I did after completing many of Ludlum's stories.<br />Those who have seen the movie need have no worries that they already know the book's plot. This story has nothing to do with the far inferior tale shown on the silver screen. Those who enjoyed the movie should definitely pick up the book and, even those who have not seen the movie will probably enjoy this book if they have any fondness for the spy thriller genre. If you enjoyed this book, you should certainly read The Janson Directive, which is, in my opinion, Ludlum's best work.<br />I hope this review was helpful to you. If you have any comment, please email me at generic0@msn.com
B000001ESF|5.0|As a new Rush fan, I had to decide which album I would buy first.  So naturally I chose 2112.  If a song is 22 minutes long, it's gotta be good.  The opener, which is broken into sub-songs is a true masterpice.  The best part of the album is when &quot;Temple's of the Synix&quot; kicks in about 4 minutes into 2112.  The gutiars scream and Geddy's voice howls out in a pitch that no other human can reach &quot;we've taken care of everything, the words you read, the songs you sing&quot;, my personal favorite line in any Rush song.  The next 5 songs on the album are no 2112, but they're still pretty damn good.  This is a must have for any classic rock fan.
B000002O5L|5.0|Tom Petty is among the best rock stars around.I have almost all of his albums.This LP is a must for Tom Petty fans.
B000099T2L|1.0|This is the most overrated piece of crap to come along in a really long time.  This is basically an album full of fillers! There's nothing even remotely appealing about it.  Believe me when I say, you'll be wasting your money if you buy this crappy excuse for an album!
0393307050|5.0|This review is for those who watched the &quot;master and Commander&quot; movie and are now contemplating reading the series.<br />The caveats are that it is a long series of books (20) and that the pace is much slower than Hollywood's.  That said, if you have any interest in the times (The Napoleonic Wars) and the topic (sailing, naval warfare), you will certainly want to set sail with Patrick O'Brien.  In &quot;master and Commander,&quot; you will find almost no overlap with the eponymous film, except that the principal characters are Captain Aubrey and Dr. Maturin, and much revolves around their relationship.<br />Indeed, personalities and relationships are one of the strong suits of these books, which have rich and evolving character development.  Start here, read through a few, and by the time you are several books in, half the Royal Navy will be old friends, or adversaries.  Likewise, don't be put off by the details of sailing; the topgallants, the weather gauge, and the bo'sun will all be well-understood in time.<br />O'Brien lets plot, character development, and technical explanation unfold over time.  Be patient.  After all, you wil be reading a ripping sailing yarn with exciting battles and exotic places in the interim.<br />O'Brien opens a lost world to us, with wonderful research into history, natural phenomena, speech patterns, and more.  Set sail with him now and you will never regret having joined the crew.
B00005JMEW|5.0|This movie rocked! I have no idea how any person could dislike it in the least! From the opening scene forward, this movie is intense and amazing! Anybody who likes action films at all should buy this movie...unless you're squeamish.
B00009L1OB|5.0|This band really takes me back to my teenage years.Fun and exciting times they were.My favourite song on this album would probably be New Moon On Monday.My classmates and I used to have fun playing New Moon On Monday,Union Of The Snake,The Reflex and dozens of thier other hits during our spare time.We were Duran Duran-aholics!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I'm in love with this album!  I've been listening to it for months and I'm still not tired of it.  There's some amazing songs on it, even better than the singles that have been released.  If you like what you've heard on the radio, there's even better unreleased stuff on the album, like breathe on me, touch of my hand, the hook up, and (i got that) boom boom.  Don't be fooled by the name on the CD, this is definitely a quality album!!
B000003TA4|1.0|Thanks Kurt, for doing yourself in and sparing us from enduring album after album of this drivel. I guess all it takes to be a groundbreaking revolutionary band these days is to sing comotose behind a microphone, going off on rants about teen angst, rape and suicide. I guess you weren't completely worthless, if there was anybody who could take moaning, groaning and screaming to a new level, it was you.<br />Somehow you managed to fool legion after legion of critics into thinking Nirvana was a sublime and trancendent experience, but I wasn't fooled in the least. Thank God the early 90s are over, the faster you fade away, the better.
B00028HBKM|4.0|I was very moved by this movie.  Yes I cried for what Jesus had to bear for us.  But Mel didn't show all the suffering that Jesus had to withstand for us.  Just a small thing, but it kinda upset my family that it was not depicted in the film, the ripping out of Jesus's beard.  OUCH!!!  No I'm not a Bible scholar, and I definitely don't know the Bible cover to cover (shame on me) but I would have really apprieciated a more accurate depiction of the suffering that Jesus beared for us for love's sake.  To know that someone loved me enough to 'take it for me' in that manner is most heart wrenching.<BR> <BR>My daughter and I told each other, if the salvation of the world depended on us, and we had to go through what Jesus did, for us, then the world would be going to Hell in a hand basket.

B000002I25|5.0|This work was done during a period in which The Doors were experimental, lean, hungry and pushing on musical convention. Their sound, the lyrics, Morrison's on the edge vocals, all blended into a band beyond 1967 convention. That culminated in &quot;Strange Days&quot; and to a lesser extent, &quot;Waiting For the Sun&quot;.<br />  Unfortunately, Morrison's self-indulgence and the band's drifting indifference saw a decline that was only partially resurrected with &quot;L.A. Woman&quot;. Too bad the hungry years didn't remain....

B00002MZ2C|5.0|First off I have to say that I love this CD and I love RATM. What I dont love is how people have to go and (...) about how their political message is wrong and how they are lazy and really don't do a thing about what they say is wrong. Maybe they didn't notice that on the cd (or the ratm website) that all they money they make on tour is given to charities like Amnesty International among others. This is when I ask all the people who seem to have many politics but no views on them and say that RATM are lazy WHAT THE (...) DO YOU DO FOR WORLD? I doubt you give hundreds of thousands of dollars to charity. So stop pretending your important enough that anybody cares what you think. I just wish RATM had stayed together long enough to take a crack at George W.
B000002ULO|5.0|I give this LP five stars for the song Beautiful night.
0790733226|5.0|I thought that &quot;Contact&quot; was a bit boring at first when I saw it back when it came out in 1997 but I was much younger then and now that I'm older, I later have found this movie to be really amazing and powerful.<br /> The moivie is the tale of a woman who when searching the skies through a radio telescope picks up a mysterious signal that is not from a human made radio device and this causes a frenzy across the U.S. and her goal is to find out what it is by menas of special machines the size of large apartment buildings to make 'contact' with the sender of this mysterious signal.<br /> This movie is just amazing. I at first didn't like it a whole lot back then but now I think it's one of the smartest sci-fi movies made in the 1990s and I strongly recommend this movie. It may be a bit slow in parts but overall, this is a highly rewarding movie and is one of Jodie Foster's best movies of her career to date.
0156027321|4.0|I can't get the story or the characters from &quot;The Life of Pi&quot; out of my mind.  Jill, you seem to have a bad attitude and if you want anyone to actually value your reviews, then may I suggest you learn how to spell, girlfriend.  It is a beautiful book, through and through.  Although I have finished it, I keep it on my coffee table and read random bits from it everyday.
B0002858YS|5.0|Oh my god...<br />These guys are going to be around for 20 years. Absolutely ridiculously over the top genius-<br />I remember the first time I heard them...it was magic. I was up late watching MTV2 and Somebody Told Me's video came on, and I was immediatly struck by the amazing new sound of the band, their incredible visual charisma and the wicked, hipness of the video.<br />I next heard Mr. Brightside, and that was it. I RAN to get the album, and man is it fan-fricking-tastic!!<br />Simply put-This is the most bitchin' band I have seen in a long time. Unreal.<br />Hot Fuss? Completely deserved!
B000002UAI|5.0|They were on top of the world, but Beatlemania was taking its toll, as you can see on the cover, detect in the slightly cynical title, and hear in the songs...but you probably know that already. What's most amazing about this album is not the Beatles' decline (producer George Martin felt it was weak, as did some of the group) but their growth. This is a growing-up album if there every was one, and it's the closest the Beatles ever came to a breakup album too (well, maybe Abbey Road for obvious reasons). After the uncertain, depressed Lennon triumvirate of No Reply, I'm a Loser, and Baby's in Black (all great songs) the bouncy pep of Rock and Roll Music sounds less like the covers on their other LPs and more like nostalgia. And indeed, the overall mood here is bittersweet, a mixture of weariness, uncertainty, nostalgia, and romance, not the gleeful love or even the idealized angst of past Beatles songs, but a deeply romanticized, and also painful, yearning. Yesterday appeared on their next release, but it wouldn't have been so out of place here (though this time it's John not Paul who expresses loss). But when they're happy, they're happy, and Eight Days a Week is as joyful as any early Beatles song, but more sophisticated and stylized (dig the fade-in). And I'll Follow the Sun is the perfect song about yearning and dreaming, no less because it was written by a teenage Paul before he became famous; it may be the best song on the album. Beatles for Sale is melancholy but not bleak, musically sophisticated, with lots and lots of underrated songs. Listening to Mr. Moonlight again, I was surprised at the soul John pours into his singing; the song might be dismissed as filler, but there's something there. And the final trio of songs (before the closer, a Perkins cover) expresses more self-doubt and ambivalence, Every Little Thing tender its its recognition of love's delicacy, I Don't Want to Spoil the Party an revelation of painful insecurity, while What You're Doing is suspicious and doubtful. The moptops get serious? You decide; pick up this album right away.<BR>5/6
6304493681|5.0|Ghost in the Shell is simply my favorite science fiction film second only to Blade Runner- Director's Cut.  Which, not surprisingly, influenced this movie a great deal.  I remember back in 1996.....already a full blown anime aficionado, I had followed the production of this film since the first Japanese press release and was eagerly awaiting its indefinate arrival on American shores.  Having read Masamune Shirow's graphic novel that inspired the film, this became the first anime title that I ever pre-ordered and counted the days upon its release.  <br />But the movie wasn't what I had expected.  The entense action was toned down a bit.  The humor in the graphic novel was entirely non-existent in the film.  What was left were the deep philosophical ovetones.  And I commend Mamoru Oshii for making the risky decision to focus mainly on this aspect of the story.  The movie, in fact, was BETTER than I could have ever hoped.  <br />The story seems simple even typical when described, but it's the underlining philosophical themes that make this film such a treasure.<br />Our protagonist is Motoko Kusanagi, an officer of a military division known as Section 9.  On the trail of a Notorious hacker dubbed The Puppet Master, Kusunagi begins to question her own consciousness or &quot;ghost&quot; as she unravels the case.<br />Deep in 'noir' territory, Ghost in the Shell is definately not for the viewer who likes to check their brain at the door.  You will be challenged to discover the existential nature of the characters as they discover it themselves.  This is not bad filmaking rather than a forced empathy with Kusunagi that will hopefully get you contemplating some of the philosophical issues presented here.
B00004U2G4|5.0|Jeff Beck never attained the success of other hard rock/proto-metal artists like Led Zeppelin, but he was just as important and influential.  On his debut album &quot;Truth&quot;, Beck lays down the law for hard rock guitar playing, and his fantastic band showed everyone how to do the rest.<br />Beck's days with the Yardbirds don't go untold - the opening track is an interesting and inspired cover of the old 'birdie's hit &quot;Shapes of Things&quot;.  Some people don't like it as much as the original, and maybe it's not as psychedelic or as bouncy, but I think it is a fine performance.  Beck and his band really shine on other tracks, though.  &quot;Let Me Love You&quot;, &quot;You Shook Me&quot; and &quot;I Ain't Superstitious&quot; are all highlights and some of the hardest rocking tunes in the set.  The fine crew of musicians supporting Jeff includes Ron Wood's incredible bass (which at times rivals Jack Bruce), Mick Waller's thundering drums, and Nicky Hopkins' awesome piano and organ work.  John Paul Jones of (later) Led Zeppelin fame even contributes some organ work on &quot;Ol' Man River&quot;, the latter of which is also a showcase for Rod Stewart's fantastic vocals.<br />&quot;Truth&quot; is often described as the blueprint for Led Zeppelin's first album.  There is no doubt that &quot;Truth&quot; was a huge influence on the Zep (Jimmy Page's guitar work echoes Jeff's leads on &quot;Let Me Love You&quot; very clearly).  There are very direct similarities between the two: &quot;Shapes of Things&quot; is Beck's &quot;Good Times Bad Times&quot;, &quot;Let Me Love You&quot; and &quot;I Ain't Superstitious&quot; are &quot;I Can't Quit You&quot;, &quot;You Shook Me&quot; was done by BOTH groups (I like Beck's version the best - rawer and more dynamic, although too short), and &quot;Morning Dew&quot; and &quot;Ol' Man River&quot; = &quot;Babe I'm Gonna Leave You&quot;.  Rod Stewart's vocals must have influenced Robert Plant hugely.<br />Let's see, of the tracks I haven't mentioned yet, let's start with &quot;Greensleeves&quot; (&quot;Aye, that's a lovely toon&quot;).  Although this track is often described as a weak point, it's one of my favorites.  As noted in the liner notes, it *is* a lovely &quot;toon&quot;.  Fantastic guitar playing (as usual from old Jeff).  Okay, &quot;Rock My Plimsoul&quot;: basically a slightly altered cover of B.B. King's old standard &quot;Rock Me Baby&quot;.  Not really a highlight of the album, as it offers nothing really new, but it's still a good track with great playing.  And, &quot;Beck's Bolero&quot; seems to be the &quot;big&quot; track, according to everybody.  Seeing as it features Jimmy Page on second guitar and Keith Moon of the Who on drums, it is one hell of a performance and one hell of a track.  It's awesome.  I also have to mention &quot;Ol' Man River&quot; as being one of my favorites.  No, it doesn't feature devastating guitar-work, but it's a great song with *amazing* singing by Mr. Stewart.<br />&quot;Truth&quot; is a good one, a *really* good one.  It's just as good as Zeppelin's first effort, and definitely more varied.  Kudos goes to the remastering as well - great sound, not &quot;harsh&quot; and not too much noise reduction.  Overall, &quot;Truth&quot; stands the test of time as one of classic rock's great recordings.
B00000I07P|5.0|I've only just started to like these guys. All my life I have heard &quot;Livin' on a prayer&quot; and when I got to this age I just had to get the album. Good choice. It's brilliant! They're my best band of the 80s.<br />Let it rock: It's a nice opener for you. It just shows you that better songs are coming. It takes about the first minute of the song to hear the first vocal. 5/5<br />You give love a bad name: I love this one! The guitar playing is amazing andf I love the vocals. Unbeatable chorus. 5/5<br />Livin' on a prayer: Arguably my favourite, but I can't decide between this and &quot;You give love...&quot;. Extremely catchy. Everyone I know loves this. 5/5<br />Social desease: It starts off very well, but it has a bad chorus. Probably my weakest song. 4/5<br />Wanted dead or alive: One of their most famous songs. It sounds scary at the start, but it gets lighter. Nice acoustic playing to a slow-paced song. 4/5<br />Raise your hands: A great song which has been forgotten. The chorus has great shouting. 5/5<br />Without love: I like Jon's singing on this one. A nice slow calm song, but it can be fun to sing. Great chorus. 5/5<br />I'd die for you: You think this is goanna be a fast, fun song, but it's quite touching. Nice keyboard playing and great lyrics. I love the backing voclas. It contains a chorus you need to sing. 5/5<br />Never say goodbye: Probably the slowest song on the album. Calm guitar playing, but it can be a bit boring. 4/5<br />Wild in the streets: It sounds a bit different, but it's a good song to end the album. It's fun and fast. Good backing vocals and a shouting chorus. 5/5<br />I only own three Bon Jovi albums, and if I get anymore this would probably still be my favourite.

B000050FEN|5.0|............who actually despise unhappy endings.  They expect every story wrought with villiany should end with rainbows and kittens.  Because we all know that's how the world works, right?  <br />Most people that have seen this movie view it for what it tries to be.  Mainly a twisted spiral of darkness and violence increasing in its disturbing imagry until the explosive finale.  Then there are those that liked it up until the end.  Huh?....the ending is what made it stand out from all the rest of Silence of the Lambs clones.  This movie showed real cajones by submitting us to a disturbing and 'un-Hollywood' type ending.  People should at least have respect for that.  As one reviewer put it, \\"..this movie sucks you deeper and deeper into an abyss then leaves you there.\\"  Yeah, I know....great, huh?  Then there are those that think the movie was pretty good...it just went too far.  Look, it's rated R for a reason.  Besides, some of the most memorable classics like 'The Exorcist' was proclaimed as, \\"..gone too far.\\"<br />In case you don't know:<br />The plot:  Mysterious serial killer murders victims based on the seven deadly sins.<BR>-greed, lust, pride, gluttony, sloth, vanity, and wrath.<br />The characters: Hot-headed rookie detective played by Pitt  +   Refined, calm, and intelligent veteren detective played by Morgan Freeman.<br />The killer:  Well, it's supposed to be a surprise since his name wasn't even in the opening credits.<br />Conclusion:  I wasn't kidding about the ending.  It's not cupcakes and roses.  I remember seeing this on the opening night in the theater.  As the credits rolled, there was no talking as people exited the theater.  Actually most people didn't move for a couple of minuets.  Only pale terrified faces across the masses.  This is great filmaking BECAUSE it leaves you with such feelings.<br />Seven is already a classic amongst suspense thrillers and it will always be so.  So do yourself a favor and check it out.
B0000CFW87|5.0|Awesome CD.  I have never heard a more beautiful voice.
1881273156|4.0|I lucked up on this book. I didn't read it page by page. I thumbed through the book and got the basis of the book which is simple. I do believe that many times people are thinking they are being loving but not actually giving what their partner needs. I personally believe that every couple needs all of the 5 love languages in their relationship, but some may be more important than others. It was a reminder to me to try to make a choice to give the type of love I know my partner desires. I believe that if your mate is happy and their love tank is full, they will be less likely to stray in the relationship. It is a pretty good book. It is not the bible, where every word can be held to truth, but it is good and practical. I just checked out The Five Languages of Children today. I think we should all take time to read books that will strenghthen our minds to make us better mates and better parents.
B00003CXCT|2.0|I am so sick and tired of people claiming the Star Wars sagas are so great.  Yeah, they were great when I was 6 years old in 1977, but now I feel like it was the begining of new era in movies.  The era of a two hour toy commericals featuring the muppets for laughs. George Lucas has been riding this pony way to long, time to move on.  Star Wars has become stale like a flat coke and boring with time.  If you want great movies, and trills, try Pulp Fiction, Seven, Fight Club, JFK, and Sixth Sense!
B00000255F|5.0|Up until about 9 months ago I didn't know much of Bruce Springsteen outside of Born in the USA which is a great album but then I had his greatest hits album for about two years the only tracks I listened to were Born in the USA and dancing in the dark but then one day I decided to listen to the whole album I was amazed. I now own almost every album he's released. This one here stands above the rest. It has the power to get you through the hard times in life it's grabs you and never let's go some call this an overated album but their probaly jealous of the power this album has. I wished people now days would listen to something of this nature.In the past few years music has turned into an endless pursuit of sex and money. With Britney, Chrisina and Justin out their using sex to sell albums makes me wonder where is the heart that music once had. On tour the Boss makes a lot more than all of them because he's a descent human being who sings about the important things in life. A great example of a real American hero.
B00003CXXM|5.0|Thankfully it's NOT the book... the book was awful, and Ludlum is a spectacularly mediocre writer.  This movie, on the other hand, takes all of Ludlum's good ideas and executes them properly.  This action tale ranks among the very best.<br />Matt Damon as an action hero?  Before this movie, maybe not.  You catch a glipse of his true acting talent in &quot;Talented Mr. Ripley&quot;, but the talented Matt Damon is wholly believable as a top-flight assassin with amnesia (there's a challenge!)  The action choreographer is a genius, putting together very dynamic, kinetic fight scenes but also putting together a car chase that ranks among the best in film (before the &quot;Italian Job&quot; made small car chases vogue again).<br />Also effective is the set design and photography... possibly one of the more beautiful and aesthetically pleasing action films you'll ever see.  Widescreen DVD would likely bring the movie experience home to you (if you have the gear).<br />I was going to withhold a star, but there's no reason to do so.  This is one of the top ten action flicks of the past 20 years, and it cements Matt Damon as an actor with incredible range and talent.  Thoroughly enjoyable, beginning to end.<br />Fred
0385507755|5.0|Once you read this book, it will immediatly change your perspective on life. It opens your eyes to what really happens out there and brings you out of the bubble that you are living in. This is a difficult book to put down, you just want to read untill it's over. I think this is the best money that I have ever spent on a bbok.
B00025ETIW|4.0|Well, it's no \\"I Brought You My Bullets...\\". The songs on this album are less intense and less personal.<br />Regardless, MCR does not deliver a failure. These guys just can't write bad music. Though not as good as their debut, this album is still great -- awesome lyrics, good vocals (though I miss some of the screaming), and hard-hitting choruses. They don't fall victim to the sophomore curse, even if \\"Three Cheers...\\" is not quite as good as their first album.<br />For me, standout tracks are \\"You Know What They Do To Guys Like Us In Prison\\", \\"The Jetset Life Is Gonna Kill You\\", and \\"I Never Told You What I Do For A Living\\". Definitely recommended... but if you want to hear them at their very best, pick up their debut.
B00006L7XQ|4.0|While I mourned the passing of Cash along with so many others, there were a few discordant notes in his American IV, most notably the cover of Sting's &quot;I Hung My Head&quot;.  On &quot;The Man Comes Around&quot; and &quot;Sam Hall&quot; the fight and energy from his early days at Sun Records comes through, but tinged wonderfully with the experience of time.  On &quot;Hurt&quot; and &quot;We'll Meet Again&quot; the poignancy of his voice and the emotion comes through so clearly that it's palpable.  \\"Danny Boy\\" and \\"In My Life\\" are truly heartfelt, but I think the best track, the song that exemplifies the true maturation of Cash while still retaining the ever persistent theme of love, regret, and death that always followed his work through his entire career would be \\"Give My Love to Rose\\".  If not for the oddly discordant note of \\"I Hung My Head\\" the album is an amazingly strong voice of one of the best and most respected American artists.  The man has indeed come around and taken Cash home, but we have a truly amazing body of work though which Cash shared his life, emotions, and thoughts with us.  Surely we'll meet again.
B00003CWTI|3.0|The fact that I saw this movie when I was 12 didnt at all change my future perspective on life, no, not at all.  To sum up the movie rather briefly:<BR>- Tom Cruise's little goat-tee (thats no where near right)(hehehe....goat)and somewhat limited vocabulary make for a hellova lotta fun and side conversation later, more so becuase I was 12<BR>- It rained frogs.
0141439807|5.0|After having read (and loved) Jane Austen's more famous novels EMMA and PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, I found MANSFIELD PARK a true delight.  Fanny Price is taken in by her wealthy aunt and uncle as charity to her more lowly-married mother, and is raised with her cousins with the idea she needs refinement and education to become as good a woman as her lesser social standing will allow.  Fanny is nervous and self-effacing, struggling with her new situation until her cousin Edmund makes her feel more at home.  Gradually, she feels like a part of the family, although the nagging sense of unworthiness always asserts itself.  As cousins marry and suitors appear, as scandals arise and emotions become known, Fanny finds herself in the equivalent of a Victorian soap opera.<br /><br />Fanny is undoubtedly one of Austen's less assertive characters, although she does mature into a woman who knows what she wants and will accept no less.  I loved Fanny and her honesty, the little girl who fears the stars in her eyes and still manages to grow up into a respectable - and respected - woman.  Her complexities are subtle and understated, making the reader work at times to understand her motivation, although anyone who has felt like an outcast even once, or anyone who respects honesty, will identify with her.  In true Austen fashion, the observations are witty, with pointed social analysis and cynicism dressed up in sly humor.  Fanny's aunts in particular are skewered, but no one, not even Fanny, is spared.<br /><br />Readers picking up this novel for the sheer delight of it will find it difficult to put down, as its language is accessible and free-flowing.  Students and book club members who must pay closer attention to themes and other literary issues may want to consider the role social standing and money play; the evolution of Fanny's character (and whether she is sympathetic); the techniques Austen uses to evoke humor; and the courtship protocol for Victorian England and how the characters both work within, and violate, the social rules.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for teenagers and adults alike, especially those whose literary tastes run toward the classics.s both work within, and violate, the social rules.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for teenagers and adults alike, especially those whose literary tastes run toward the classics.
6305535264|4.0|This is a classic sci-fi film that is largely overlooked.  But it has been looked upon enough to make the decision of putting it on DVD and this is wonderful!  Now this treasure will be preserved longer.<br />The plot is about a planet called Saturn 3 where two scientists live to conduct research.  Their research is a little behind schedule so another scientist gets sent down to help out a little with some new technology.  Unfortunatley, the scientist that is supposed to go down gets ambushed and replaced by a crazy guy with some devious plans in mind.  He takes down a robot that learns by a wireless link between itself and an actual human brain.  Since it is hooked up to and is learning from the mad scientist it goes a little haywire.  It gains the obsession of the female scientist that it's teacher has as well.  See the robot go crazy and watch the scientists run for their lives and try and escape from the desolate Saturn 3!<br />I love this movie! I give it 4 star because it loses one star for going at a slow pace.  Yes, this movie does move slow; but it is fun to watch and has a totally cool story.  B-Movie Classic!!
0783225881|5.0|On DVD, the movie is loaded with extra features including commentary, interviews, trailer, etc. This was on Channel 7 last week. Kevin Costner stars as a suburban family man who is hearing voices. &quot;If you built it they will come&quot;. The voices keep changing their messages and lead him in pursuit of the gathering of baseball legends who have passed away. The goal is to establish a &quot;field of dreams&quot; a baseball park with old pros playing and a magic working on its audience. And it did for many people when this movie was released in 1989. Too many, it was a movie about hope, following your dreams and persistence. Kevin Costner is doing a terrific performance and is perhaps doing his greatest role. He was merely a romantic lead in the early 90's &quot;The Bodyguard&quot; with Whitney Houston and he was not as committed in &quot;Dances With Wolves&quot; which though the right kind of movie for him was not as interesting enough a character as he is in this movie. Other than this movie, his only fine role was in J.F.K. In this film, he plays a dedicated and persistent dreamer who discovers that indeed dreams come true if you hold fast. A great job by all the actors, including James Earl Jones (the voice of Darth Vader in Star Wars) as the hermit and elusive author Terrence Mann, who wrote books in the 60's advocating love and peace. He is supposedly modeled after J.D. Salinger. The chemistry between James Earl Jones and Kevin Costner, especially in the scene in which Costner attempts to pursuade him to join him to a baseball game is exceptional. Magical and unexpected things start to happen as the voices carry him onward through his mission, including a trip back in time to 1972.  Bring the magic home in this remarkable DVD. It's as much an adult's movie as it is for the whole family. It's almost a Disney film. Five stars.
B00028HBKM|5.0|I have never seen a movie so powerful that the moment it starts playing, no one in the theater dares to move.  From the spine-chilling start in Gethsemani, all eyes were magnetized to the screen; even the sounds of breaths were kept at a minimum.  It's like the entire room is transported back to Jerusalem, experiencing what was known to have happened 2000 years ago.  The flashbacks and the synthesis of the scenes, e.g., the washing of Pilate's hands before submitting Jesus to be crucified to Jesus washing his hands before offering up the bread for the last supper, were intrinsically done and cleverly executed.  The precise fusion of the passages to the scene being shown is nothing but inspired.  The graphic details of the movie are helpful into reminding the viewers of the \\"passion\\" of the Christ.  The end product is an experience of what I consider a \\"wake up call\\" to the rest of humanity.  <br />All in all, the cast and crew had done a great-great job in delivering to us this story; it is a religious event that will always be remembered.  <br />This is an AWESOME movie, and I can't wait to own it on DVD.
B00005B36H|5.0|Now anybody can write a review, so i will. I mean, this CD is so incredible. If your into this type of music, which is a blend of just about everything, then you should buy this cd. I dont think this CD is for people who are seriously into the death metal and people screaming their lungs out. This is a much cooler CD from their last ones. Once again the drummer gives an excellent performance, leaving me wondering how he played the bass notes so fast on the end of Schism. The guitars and bass are some of the best i have heard in a while, and the vocals make me want to cringe they are so good. I wont even go into the songs as they are all first rate. Songs that stand out on this album are Schism of course, a truly unforgetable guitar part, Parabol and Parabola, really one long song in two parts, and The Grudge. I was totally blown away by this cd. You will like every song. If you havent bought this yet put it in your shopping cart and buy it. Possibly one of the best CD's (or bands?) of all time. If you are a beginner drummer then try all of Tool's songs on drums and you will seriously rock.
B000002A3T|5.0|&quot;&quot;The Division Bell&quot; is the final album from Pink Floyd, a band that soon imploded as their fan base grew indifferent over the last ten years. This pretentious album enjoyed lukewarm sales before disappearing from the charts completely. Stacks upon stacks of &quot;The Division Bell&quot; can be found in cut-out bins in record shops everywhere. Gilmour won't admit it, but Pink Floyd are done. They went out not with a bang but with a faint whimper.&quot;<br /> The Division Bell is not PF's last album. Once again the user going by &quot;You can't ban me&quot; this time is at it again. This worthless B!tch stacks her votes against all of PF's albums to lower their star value. You can't buy a word she is saying, but you can by the album; do so, it is excellent. Nobody seems to like this poor attention starved TRL  fan, and that includes the people on Amazon. No, we can't ban you, but we sure as hell can flame your ass.
B000002NBY|5.0|Most Americans over the age of 30 recognize Paul Simon's quiet, melodic tenor within seconds of hearing it.  We've never gotten tired of it, exactly, but some freshning up is always good.  Simon's collaboration with the South African artists featured on this disc creates a surprisingly compatible blending of the new and the familiar.  The lush roils of the South African singers alongside Simon's light, sweet musings creates a delectable feast for the careful listener.  I've played this album hundreds of times by now and never tire of it.  Each time, I hear something new. Each time, a different song, previously only casually heard, becomes, suddenly, a masterwork.
B0001HLVS2|1.0|Wow! Am I ever happy I did not spend 10 bucks to see this in the theater. It is possibly the most boring movie I have ever seen. Granted, I am not particularly interested in this genre, but even my boyfriend, who was all hyped up to see this, was bored senseless.
1558908382|5.0|This is, for me anyway, the best film Cusack has done. It's filled with a certain realism that you don't find in many films. This is odd because the film is primarily a comedy. Black comedy, mind you, but comedy nonetheless.<br />Background - Martin Blank (Cusack) is a contract hit-man ten years after his high school graduation. He's lost his taste for 'the business' and wants out. He received an invite to his high school reunion but doesn't initially want to attend. Almost simultaneously, he gets a contract to take out someone in his home town. He decides to kill two birds with one stone and do both. Little does he know that a contract has been put out on him as well.<br />Story - Blank freaked out at the end of high school and joined the army where he learned to kill. He was loaned out to the CIA where he served as a hit-man before going solo. After ten years of the stuff, he's had his fill and wants out. A fellow hit-man (Dan Aykroyd) Grosser, wants to form a 'Hit-man union' of sorts. Blank declines, so Grosser puts a contract out on him. The film follows Blank as he seeks out his high school sweetheart, avoids assassination attempts, and tries to complete his last hit, which has an interesting twist.<br />Why I like this film - The conversations Cusack has with the other characters, as well as with himself, are priceless. The dialog is disjointed, much like a real conversation you might have. <br />Another thing that I liked was the realism of the fight scenes. I'm tired of watching movie fights where the hero and villains trade punches to the face, and neither of them have any blood on them. In one scene in particular, the fight lasts all of a minute (pretty real for a streetfight) and both characters as bloodies and sweating profusely. Very realistic, indeed.<br />This film is not for people who don't like action, as it's filled with it. Younger children probably shouldn't watch it either because of the excessive violence. Fans of Cusack should like it, as it's filled with intelligent humor.
B000267JQK|5.0|wow its already been 2 years and they release another disclaimer it reminds me of linkin park when they did reanimation.  i just hope seether doesnt take to long to release there sophomore album.  ive been a fan of seether ever since i saw them at ozzfest 2002 and they were really great.  when i bought the cd i was expecting the songs to be alot different and they were by just a little bit.  they sound 10x better remastered then the original and that is why i gave this cd 5 stars.  another reason i gave it 5 stars is the 8 \\"new\\" tracks on the cd and the fact that they put hang on on here which by the way is my favorite song by them.  im guessing there sophomore album will come out near the end of august to match the date of there debut but who knows i just hope its sometime soon.
B0001W8Q9Y|3.0|Marillion's intention with &quot;Marbles&quot; is to try to sell around 250,000 copies (250% more than Anoraknophobia).  To that end, &quot;Marbles&quot; has two difficult and conflicting objectives to meet: to satisfy the hardcore Marillion fans and at the same time draw in a considerable number of casual purchasers.  Needless to say the end result is something of a compromise and ultimately neither camp will end up completely satisfied.  Perhaps the band should take note that two of their better received and better selling albums were concept albums (Misplaced Childhood and Brave). <br />What about the music?  Well, if Marillion are hoping to appeal to the uncommitted, starting the album off with the 14 minutes or so of &quot;The Invisible Man&quot; is either a very brave or a very stupid move.  For the Marillion fan in me, this is a superb track, one of their best.  To the non Marillion fan this must sound like tedious prog rock waffle.  Perhaps a more upbeat, shorter song would have made a better opening number.<br />The &quot;Marbles&quot; pieces themselves seem pointless, like half finished ideas for songs.<br />The rest of the single album follows the tried and tested formula of recent albums, mixing shorter, more commercial pieces, with the longer proggier type songs.  &quot;You're Gone&quot;, the single, is quite catchy in a mid 80's Simple Minds/Genesis sort of a way.  &quot;Don't Hurt Yourself&quot; comes across like a zillion mid 90's indie bands' attempts at a country rock song.  &quot;Angelina&quot; sounds like a Chris De Burgh song, rescued only by Steve's guitar work.  &quot;Digging Holes&quot; - a poor attempt at the Beatles meet Blur to cover a Bowie song.<br />&quot;Neverland&quot; is another highlight (think &quot;Maybe I'm Amazed&quot; or a track off the last Oasis album), although the song's bid for greatness is spoilt by a lack of editing.<br />Plus points: less of the jamming needlessly style as on Anoraknophobia; great instrumental work fromSteve R, Pete and Mark.<br />Minus points:  drums so far down the mix, it sounds almost as if the album was recorded without Ian being present (contrast the drum sound on this album with say Misplaced Childhood) - too many loops, not enough real drums; the overall sound is very mid - 80's, like &quot;Tin Drum&quot; by Japan, or &quot;Invisible Touch&quot; or any mid 80's Simple Minds album.<br />Will it sell 250,000?  No.  Will it be hailed as the greatest marillion album of all time by the Marillion Taliban (those for whom any criticism of the band is considered a greater blasphemy than The Satanic Verses is to the most hardcore Muslim fundamentalist) Yes.<br />Good try, but not quite there.
B00006RINF|5.0|Amazing, I bought the cd without knowing what they sounded like. My jaw dropped. I quickly then went and bought everyone of there other releases. it is a must have in everyones collection
B0001NBMBC|4.0|First off I am not a &quot;Slipknot Maggot&quot; so I do not have a biased view. In reading the other reviews its seems like people either love the album or hate it. With that said, here is my take on it. This is defiantly a different album from their other two in how it's compiled. Personally, I REALLY liked their self-titled album because it was really heavy and intense. This album is defiantly softer and by no means does that make it a bad album. If bands never changed they would be ripped on for &quot;trying to resell what they already did&quot;. There are some awesome songs like &quot;Pulse of the Maggots&quot;, Welcome &amp; Three Nil&quot; but in my opinion nothing comes close to &quot;SIC&quot;, &quot;Wait &amp; Bleed&quot; or Spit It Out&quot;.<br />Bottom Line: If you like it heavy it: buy it used or avoid, if you like it a little softer you'll probably love it.
B00005JMUA|5.0|Quentin Tarantino has once again outdone himself with Vol. 2 of the delightfully fun Kill Bill saga. While there are no big surprises in store, the film is nonetheless extremely engrossing and fun, full of kinetic energy, amazing stunts, and a great cast to boot.<br />Uma Thurman is terrific once more, and it was good to see more of Michael Madsen, David Carradine, and of course, the irresistible Darryl Hannah. While the second half (Volume) is a bit more talky than the first, the plot manages to grab the viewer and refuses to let go until the very satisfying ending. The slower moving film allows for some brilliantly campy Tarantino dialogue.and for the actors to shine in the dramatic story.<br />This is an entirely different experience than the first film, but that's not a bad thing. While the first was one delicious action sequence after another, the conclusion concentrates more on unfolding the story, with all the tension, but much less of the gore and violence. Some people were disappointed in this installment, but pure Tarantino fans will rejoice at the wonderful simplicity of it all. I was actually pleasantly surprised because the two films are so different.<br />The crisp cinematography is fantastic and the black and white scenes work very well. One of the best Tarantino sequences captured on film is when The Bride, whose real name we finally get to learn by the way, visits Pai Mei, to train and learn how to kill Bill. He is truly one of the funniest characters on film and definitely adds to the already rich story. Neither better or worse than its predecessor, take this for what it is, a wonderful Tarantino film, and enjoy. This gets a solid A.
B00009UW0N|3.0|I'd been told lots about this movie, and I was anticipating something more. I can see how it must have been great when it came out, but I was constantly rolling my eyes at the predictability of it.<br />Also, the sound track. Why the same music, over and over?<br />Jamie Lee Curtis was excellent , but all the other characters seemed very scripted and monotonous.<br />It also seemed to me that the movie ended to soon and I wanted to know more, but didn't get enough out of the first movie to rent the second.<br />I enjoyed the movie and some parts made me close my eyes, but I wouldn't say it was my favourite. I guess I'm a special effects kind of a person.
B00028HBKM|2.0|If you want to make a movie about Christ, and if you want it to be about how good Jesus was, why focus on his brutal and horrid death?    Why would you want to make a 2 hour movie just depicting a man being whipped and beaten and hung on the cross and left to die? I have no clue. Ask Mel Gibson. Why not focus on the great things Jesus did? Like heal the lepers, and teach people wonderful and beautiful things, not the way he died. Sure, he died to save us, but didn't he do better things while he was alive? This movie was sad, and it really makes you think, but it was meant to be that way. All I think is that this movie was about how poor Mel Gibson wants to tell all us Americans about how those \\"dirty Jews\\" killed his poor sweet lord Jesus. This film was extremely anti-Semetic and disturbing, as well as violent. Why don't you read the Bible, and look at how wonderful Jesus was, and not sit through 2 hours of this movie, it was well made, I must say that, but not a good family film.
B000084T18|1.0|there is no more to say than 50 cent is terrible. i liked him, yeah i did, when up to the point where the battle with ja rule started to end. that was when the freestyle with eminem and busta rhymes came out over the old 2pac classic &quot;hail mary&quot; came out. after that song i lost all respect for him. he does not have his own line in that song, not ONE. every lines he uses is either from &quot;hail mary&quot; or &quot;against all odds,&quot; and he skews those lines to aim them at ja rule. who does he think he is taking every line from 2pac, and then calling ja rule a 2pac wanna be? at least rule rolls with hussein fatal, one of the outlawz, who rolled with 2pac. dont get me wrong ja rule sucks too, but 50 needs to rethink who he is. what happened to those classic battles, dr. dre vs. eazy-e, the crazy feud between LL and canibus, and even jay-z and nas? hip-hop battling has come down to this, and its garbage. he got shot 9 times and he has so much money, and his shoes match his cars, who cares. write something creative and true to hip-hop, rather than the trash you're spittin. 50 cent is nothin, and i hope he does not go down as one of the greatest of all time.
B000000WJZ|5.0|this is the best album i own, i played it so much it is wearing out. today, hummer, and mayonaise are the best songs
B0000X2EOW|5.0|David Bowie as the Goblin King was truley magical, expessially because of how gorgeous he is and because of his charming wit. the music in the film is fantastic, i highly reccomend buying the soundtrack to this film as well. Jennifer Connoly plays Sara beautifully, and this edition is absolutley wonderful. it is the ultimate item to own for any fan. It also provides a MUCH clearer picture, compared to the original. The picture is much more sharp and looks like the film was made recently and not in the 80s. i would buy this in a second. 100% viewer satisfaction.
B000002LGA|4.0|To all those too young during 1981-1989, too rich during that period to have a fair assessment, and those who during the Reagan funeral ceremony that lasted a week, look back with nostalgia to that &quot;GREAT&quot; period in American history, this is the WAKE UP call you NEED TO HEAR!  Lou Reed reminds us of all the hell this country (New York specifically) was going through during the Reagan years.  Ghetto life, drug addiction, psychos seeking fame, AIDS torn communities, starving children here and abroad and all we can think about in this country is another &quot;million dollar rocket, another million dollar [movie] star&quot;..  This album RAILS and takes no prisoners, but it tends to be as somber and mournful at times than necessarily angry, although there is still plenty of anger as well.  Although the last few songs (&quot;Good Evening&quot;, &quot;Dime Store Mystery&quot;) don't quite hold up to the unbelievable standard set at the beginning, this is still a classic that should be missed by no one, especially those of you with fond thoughts of that DARK period in U.S. history: 1981-1989.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I bought this DVD because I knew that it would contain episodes that FOX didn't show. I found the overall DVD production, w/interviews etc., to be more than I had expected.  FOX should be ashamed of itself! This was a truly interesting concept w/believable and developed/developing characters that I quickly came to care about. P.S. I'm 57 years old -- not the 14-26 male age  group they seem to cater to -- but I've got the money to buy stuff!
B000089RVX|5.0|damn, this is a bad ass cd. i heard the my immortal on the radio and then i saw the video. thats when i started liking this band. i like hip hop and r&amp;b, but this cd is off the hook. all youu people who say that this cd is unoriginal and corporate, yall are stupid. i read this review where some lame ass said that the lead singer can't even sing. are you crazy dude. she can sing high notes that none else can. can't wait til' their next one.

B000268QB2|5.0|Keane is a great band. They are young fresh faces from public school. They are very musical and the lead singer is really good. The lead singer sounds a little like the lead singer of Manic Street Preachers. They have anthems. They wear their hearts on their sleeves. Every song is solid. I saw them play recently and people were going crazy. They are easily the best new band in the UK. They can fight it out with Franz Ferdinand. Not sure if this is any indication that the UK scene is better than the US. The Killers, Devendra Banhart, The Von Bondies, The Rapture are cool bands that have recent records. Maybe there is more melody and songwriting in UK music and that's a good sign. Hopefully Keane will get noticed.
0671027344|5.0|The annoyingly crappy review has been up at the top of this for a little too long so I have to put in my two cents.  First of all, I would like to clarify something...the reviewer that gave it a bad review claims that Charlie's music tastes are out of date...WELL THAT'S KIND OF WHAT CHARLIE IS! He's an old soul isn't he?  I mean sure it wasn't the popular music, but I am certain it wasn't popular with most kids to read so much as he did and the books that he did.  This book is amazing and has changed my life.  I used to be a wallflower like Charlie, and this book single-handedly made me get up \\"on the dance floor\\" and participate in life.  Some of the most poignant moments are when Chbosky is explaining through Charlie the feeling of being \\"infinite.\\"  Even if you don't understand what I'm saying, if you read it you would immediately feel connected from the feeling.  I am just about to start my freshmen year, and I have read this book two times.  Both times left me speechless with tears.  (And I get teary-eyed at the song \\"Landslide\\" now reminds me of it because it fits the book perfectly)  If I had not read this book, I never would have made as many friends as I did, and I am sure I will make many more and have life experiences that I would have never had before.  You have to believe me when I say this book is NOT overrated it is UNDERRATED...I think it should be more broadly distributed, because its powerful lessons are for people of all ages.  This book reminds me to live...simple as Charlie may be, his lessons are the most touching I have ever read...moreso than even a classic book with themes and parallel meanings...They are easy to spot in this one, very straightforward, but are the most important of all...
B0001MDPV8|5.0|Hands down, Illmatic is the greatest rap album to come from east-cost, from the intro to the last second of the classic &quot;IT AINT HARD TO TELL&quot; this album is flawless throughout, and thank Nas for birthing alot of MCs with this album, and this remastered version proves that after 10 years in the game, this album is still an undeniable piece of art.
B00000IQC8|4.0|I really hate giving anything a 4 out of 5 but this movie wasn't incredible like mallrats or dogma. This movie has some really funny lines and if you don't listen closly you wont like the movie at all.
0060926317|5.0|This is a fantastic book, it is one of the books that lets you reconsider all the superficial things one tends to worry about.<br />I wanna share some of the quotes I particulary liked in the book.<br />How would one put a coin in a telephone, dial a number and call someone?? We use mental telepathy...<br />According to the Aborigines, there are no misfits, or accidents, just mysteries not yet revealed by man.<br />Everything exists for a certain purpose.<br />We don't celebrate getting older, we celebrate getting wiser and better.<br />All in all this book helps you to learn so much more about the culture of this indigenous people than you could ever do through any other book.....<br />I recommend it highly and hope everyone enjoys it as much as I did!!
B000002JOF|4.0|A friend recommended this album.  I bought it and spent a lot of time wondering if I got a bad copy.  Tracks 1 &amp; 5 waste a lot of your time with some sort of &quot;ethereal&quot; silence.  Great album, but these blank spaces are a little too artsy-fartsy for me.

As for Human Nature is the most express feelings for her to sing and her video of Human Nature kick butt! Very good job, Madonna! Keep up the hard work!
B000002J1S|5.0|What a great album its by far the best album with peter gabriel.  The album takes you on a rollercoster of emotions from start too finish.  Every song on this album is superb what a great bunch of musicians these guys were and phil on drums is awsome.  Well I give it 10 stars if I could.  Way better than any of the other Gabriel genesis albums.
0312263120|4.0|I really enjoyed it, it is not quite at the level of Angels and Demons or DaVinci Code, but still a good read.  I am fairly computer literate, perhaps a true techie might find fault with some of the plot points, but I didn't.  I don't understand how someone could give it only 1 star.  If you want &quot;literature&quot;, fine, go read Dickens or something, but this is a great vacation book that I would highly recommend.
B0002858YS|5.0|THis album is awesome!!!!!!<BR>i got this cd for an amazing price of 6.99 at Best Buys. <BR>Go get yours now. <BR>Every song on it is great and very catchy<BR>If u like the singles \\"somebody told me\\" or \\"mr.brightside\\",<BR>get this album. The rest of the songs are just as good.<BR>You won't be dissapointed
B00006RINF|4.0|I only have one fault with it though, on some tracks the guitar, bass and drums drown out the vocals, which is dissapointing because Christina's voice is excellent. I think the best song on the album is 'swamped' due to the fact that both the vocals and the music is great. I could listen to this album every day. Lacuna coil has enspired me to start my own band so hopefully someone will be writing a review on my music one day in the near future.
0778320448|5.0|This is the first book I've ever read by Debbie MacOmber but won't be the last!  I first picked it up because I'm a knitter and pretty obsessed right now with the craft. I thought the premise was interesting. The character's are all in need of friendship however, they have little in common other then the desire to knit.  Isn't that how some of the best and most varied relationships begin. I loved the growth of characters through the book and the time the author took to honor each of the characters. The women in this book are all daring, brave and in for a lot of personal growth which MacOmber harvest throughout the book. I was sad to see it end! Thanks!
B000001IQH|5.0|now this is real punk. blink 182 and nfg and other bands like that r pretty good but when u want real punk u gotta get this cd
B00003CXCT|3.0|So much time waiting... so much money invested... and they only give us a spanish dub version??? And just the NEW version? That sucks. Spanish subtitles are a MUST!
B00003CX5P|5.0|This was a nice way to begin the Star Wars Saga. Immediatly, we are introduced to Jedi master Qui-Gon Jinn and of course our main hero, Obi-Wan Kenobi. The film takes off from the Federation Control ship to the awesome Pod Race and then on to the final battle on the planet Naboo. This film is action packed and worthy of being called a Star Wars movie. The characters are well set up for Attack of the Clones and gives us a whole new look on Star Wars. Best Scene: The Three Way duel between Darth Maul, Jinn, and Kenobi is a Star Wars fans dream!<br />&quot;We'll watch your future with great interest!&quot;<br />- Chancellor Palpatine to Anakin Skywalker
6301763041|5.0|I really loved this movie. The songs and the very odd yet interesting characters really draw you in. This movie is what first made me become a Johnny Depp fan ( I mean he looks really really good in this film). The movie is awesome the whole way through but the ending is the best and the song is unforgettable.<BR>HEY MR. JAILER!!!!!!! man, i love that part! So I would love everyone to go and see this movie and I definetly would recommend it.
B0000TB01Y|4.0|I must admit I bought &quot;Wicked&quot; with a bit of trepidation. After hearing Mr. Schwarz's &quot;Children of Eden&quot; I was disappointed with his musical productions as of late. Unlike his earlier musicals, his later ones seemed cutesy and more set for a child, unlike the sophisticated lyrics and melodies of such earlier shows as &quot;The Baker's Wife&quot; and &quot;Godspell.&quot; Thankfully, Mr.c Schwarz has abandoned his typically flimsy latter music style to write up an excellent show. <BR>    Idina Menzel's voice although powerful and brazen at times, is also very flexible giving the Witch the sometimes fragile murmuring quality that works well with the show. I am glad to see that she does not overdo her vocal capabilities and blends her voices into something that meshes with the other characters. <BR>    Ms. Chenowith has a pure lyrical soprano that is a wonderful instrument as Galinda/Glinda the Good. She probably has the most expressive voice on broadway to date. <BR>    Joel Grey as the Wizard needed something to be desired and his songs felt like they were thrust into the mix after the other music was already complete as a somewhat *homage* to his greatness or great name at least. His songs stick out as not meshing with the rest of the music and true variety may be a very great thing but when it comes down to his songs I feel they were written for him personally and the song styles belong in a totally different musical than Wicked. <BR>    Overall an excellent cd, yet I have my reservations about the plt. When &quot;Wicked&quot; as a novel came out, I loved it and read it over and over again. Even a day or two before I bought this cd I had just finished reading it for about the 20th time and the book and musical are so different it is quite a shame to have butchered an excellent excellent piece of literary work to the mere threads it was based on. I would have liked to see most of the real plot. Although a fan of the book would be flabbergasted atthe butchery of such a fine piece of work i feel the plot does well even though it is a mere shadow of the original. A few smaller points of interest have me saddened that Mr. McGuire had put in the book. examples: Fiyero was an a prince of the Arjiki tribe with blue diamonds on his face and chest and in the book the last person in the world Glinda would have married was him. Where are Tibbet and Crope the fun-loving ne'er-do'wells that had me in stitched in the book. Avaric of the book seemed to have morphed into a snobby Fiyero-when Fiyero was never a snob in the book. Madame Morrible seems to be almost a *good* person in the musical, much differing from the book. What about Liir, Melena, Frexspar the Godly, Nanny, Pfannee, Milla, Shenshen, Sarima and her sisters and those terrible children she had? <BR>    Please, if you have listened to this musical and loved it, go out and buy the book. I warn you that it is almost totally different but an excellent read and while the music is outstanding, the book and the meanings behind it are much better reading than the flimsier plot of &quot;Wicked&quot; the musical.
B0001L3LUE|4.0|This 2003 documentary explores the difficulties of leadership.  Robert S. McNamara, now 85 years old, talks about his life and his view of some of the milestones of our time.  He was Secretary of Defense during the Kennedy and Johnson era and had to make some hard choices regarding war.  He's learned a lot, and this film is a lesson to the world regarding the difficulty of decision-making at the very top levels.  He's honest about his mistakes and feels sorrow about the suffering.<br />There's a lot of archival footage going back to World War II and he raises the questions about the war in Japan and the firebombing which killed 100,000 people in Tokyo in a single night.  Every word out of his mouth is food for thought.<br /><br />It's all done in a relaxed atmosphere and Mr. McNamara comes across like a wise grandfather who wants to impart wisdom to future generations.  There's a lot of wisdom here.  I just wish people would listen. I applaud his honesty and feel this is a fine film.  However, it was very slow and I kept dosing off.  That's the only criticism I have.  Otherwise, the film has a lot to say. .
B00007KQA3|3.0|I agree with the review of this DVD concerning the lack of the Eurythmics soundtrack.  This really makes the film a much different experience than the one I enjoyed and coveted all these years on VHS.  Director Radford has made a huge miscalculation in judgment, if he's the one responsible.  I would like to point out that the UK release of the DVD had the original electronic soundtrack, if you want to track that down.  The grinding drone of string instruments on this DVD version overdoes the depression.
B00005JM0B|2.0|I for one found &quot;The Terminator&quot; to be very overrated; a cheesy, messy action flick. &quot;T2&quot; pretty much saved the trilogy; I consider it a masterpiece of special effects and storytelling.<BR>&quot;Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines&quot; nearly destroys James Cameron's original visions. Everything that worked in &quot;T2&quot; didn't work in this movie. I'll admit that I did like Arnold Schwarzenegger's performance. But the story was almost identical to &quot;T2,&quot; even if the action scenes (which were good) were slightly alterted. The plot: two Terminators travel back in time. One (Arnold) must protect John Connor (Nick Stahl); the other (Kristanna Loken) is trying to kill him. Of course, the new TX is a female terminator--an idea that completely failed.<BR>Yes, the visual effects are astounding, much like with the second film. But with the exception of Arnold, the acting was terrible. Loken wasn't menacing at all, and Stahl and Claire Danes were laughable. And as for the ending . . . I don't know what the writers were thinking, but they made a huge mistake. Actually, this entire movie was a mistake. &quot;T2&quot; ended perfectly, but somehow I always knew this film was coming. If you must see it, then only see it because of Arnold.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|I liked this film very much.<BR>I got the enui and sadness and loneliness of Bill Murry, living through an unhappy marriage.  He is always wry and charming in a very distinct and memorable way.<br />I got Scarlett Johansen's similar situation.  Her presence is very powerful and her eyes that burn holes through the screen. She has a poise and wisdom and beauty that will surely make her an enormous star.  Without the two of them the film probably would not have succeeded.<br />I get the strangeness of the environment, a sort of sterility and isolation inside the crowd that is all too common but that is rarely portrayed in movies.<br />I was impressed that..Sophia Coppola was brave enough to make a movie.. that isn't really about anything. They have no physical relationship.  It would have been an easier, more saleable film if the two of them had consumated the affair.  The restraint here allows the emotions to come to the surface, showing a maturity and depth that is very beautiful and which touches the spirit.   <br />The minimalist style of the work is sometimes overplayed but this is certainly a worthwhile film that will be greatly enjoyed by those in the target audience.
B00005JKCH|4.0|An enormous sucess at the box office, &quot;Spider-Man&quot; is pure entertainment. With great action scenes and surprisingly good performances, one wonders why it's not perfect.<BR>It's not a perfect movie, to be sure, but it approaches greatness when it comes to Tobey Maguire's portrayal of Peter Parker, who ultimately becomes Spider-Man. Willem Dafoe is superb as the villain; Rosemary Harris and Cliff Robertson offer great support as Peter's aunt and uncle.<BR>The special effects work, even if they seem a bit cartoonish in some parts. But for simple, flat out fun, you can't beat this movie. Usually, I'm pregidous towards blockbusters like these, but &quot;Spider-Man&quot; really deserves all its popularity.
B00006V9A0|5.0|so combine such classics as \\"smells like teen spirit\\" \\"heart shaped box\\" \\"rape me\\" and \\"litium\\" along with an awesome previously unreleased track, \\"you know you're right\\" and waht do you have?  this cd.  if the first track doesnt explain why he died nothing will.  from beginning to end you wont be bored.<br />rip kurt cobain, she will always have to live with what she did to you
B0000AGQ6P|5.0|Why has this film been criticized? There's nothing to complain about Steven Spielberg's &quot;Hook.&quot; It should be a classic; most people don't remember that it was nominated for a whole slew of Oscars.<BR>First off, I'll cover the visuals. They're wonderful. The depiction of Neverland was incredible to behold. The effects and flying scenes nearly took my breath away, and the score by John Williams is truly magical.<BR>And the performances worked. Robin Williams was a great choice for Peter Pan, and Dustin Hoffman hammed it up to perfection as Captain Hook. The story was pretty interesting, too. Peter Pan has lived his worst nightmare: he grew up, and has become a corporate &quot;pirate.&quot; One night, while visiting Wendy (Maggie Smith) in London with his family, Captain Hook infiltrates the real world and kidnaps Peter's children. Even though he can't remember who he once was, Peter is aided by Tinker Bell (Julia Roberts), and journeys to Neverland to rescue his kids. The Lost Boys were hilarious, and Bob Hoskins stole the show as Hook's crooked assistant, Smee.<BR>&quot;Hook&quot; is a film that people of all ages can enjoy. A rare combination of acting, storytelling, and visuals, we should add another movie to Spielberg's list of classics. This is magical, old-school entertainment at its best.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|I gave it 4 stars because i dont believe that this album is as good as there self-titled album. I love the acoustic, i was hoping there would be some. There self=titled album was one of the best true metal albums of all time, it revolutionized the way metal has and will evolve. I was not in the least bit dissapointed in Vol.3, it was just as expected.  Slipknot is the next step on the evolutionary staircase. Anyway, i love them and i love there new cd, its not really like iowa(excessive double bass, which does essentially define metal but can be overdone)in the sense that it is next level and they are obviously exploring how far there genre can go, and that for the most part iowa was just regular old metal. anyway buy this cd, its must in my collection.
0790731002|3.0|When director Tim Burton abandoned the &quot;Batman&quot; series, Joel Schumacher took over. His take on the Dark Knight was more light-hearted and campy, much like the 1960's television series. The result? A visually astounding, but ultimately inferior, sequel.<BR>If nothing else, &quot;Batman Forever&quot; is one of the most visually impressive films of the 90's. Blessed with eye-popping cinematography and sets, the eye candy far overshadows the performances. Val Kilmer's take on Batman is somewhat convincing; I also thought Tommy Lee Jones made a great Two-Face, even if his character's story was destroyed. But the Riddler (Jim Carrey) didn't impress me at all, and Nicole Kidman was wasted in her throwaway role. I'm not even going to touch on the plot--the movie pretty much consists of (more than) a few dazzling action setpieces, with some of Bruce Wayne's brooding thrown in for good measure.<BR>Is &quot;Batman Forever&quot; a worthy entry into the Batman Legacy? No. Is it an entertaining, technically-impressive action movie? Absolutely. If special effects and bright colors are your thing, check this one out.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|This is rock and roll. If you are looking for a polished, packaged sound like Journey this is not a disc for you. If you are looking for the darkness and despair that came out of the grundge movement (not that it was all bad), this disc is not for you. Get Born is three cords and a lot of attitude. This disc rings of old Stones or Black Crows. Great guiters and a little sloppy sound that just calls you to jump off that couch and dance. Some reviewers knock this disc because it draws on a style of music that is located more in the past than in the present. However were the Stones knocked for drawing on Howling Wolf? Was Clapton knocked for drawing on Muddy Waters? If you want a fun disc to pop in the dash and cruise down the highway to, this is it!
0767827902|5.0|This film captures life in small town Texas vividly.  It was shot in black and white but color film would not have changed the appearance one bit.  <br />Some of the scenes were shot where I delivered newspapers as a kid. I thought I had been transported back in time when I first saw the film.  The characters and dialog are magnificent and the situations reminiscent of life as it was then.<br />It is a beautiful and touching film, one to watch over and over.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Hey I know a lot of you guys think Slipknot sucks now that theyve changed. In the past albums I couldent understand them half the time. It was hard to find the hidden meaning in their albums. This album is easy to see what they mean and why they made this the way it was
0679879269|1.0|(...)That's better.  Sorry about that.  Just taking out the theological shovel the Reverend Pullman had jabbed into my mouth.<br />Let me begin by saying that I don't have an axe to grind.  I do have a handle and lots of metal flakes at my feet, but no longer have any axe to speak of.<br />Like many of the reviewers here, I thoroughly enjoyed the first two books of the 'His Dark Materials' trilogy.  I now feel utterly cheated.  I think someone must have stolen his golden compass because he appears to have totally blundered off the plot lines.  What in Hades was the Mary and Mulefa section about? By the way did you know they had a diamond shape to their body structure?  Did you know that?  Did he tell you?  Did he tell you enough times?<br />Oh how I was cheering on the lone assassin.  By the time I got to the last 150 pages, and the subtlety had turned to a lecture, I just wanted those puerile characters dead with the underworld sealed-up.  Oh they were the most beautiful ever; oh Mary had never seen such a sight of pure love; oh how I wanted to chunder into the book spine.<br />I think that - although I may be wrong here - there was an ever so slight undertone of anti-Christianity.  As a replacement we have a vision of dust, other worlds, the wholeness of the universe and similar opinions dressed up with such clumsiness and inconsistency as to sound like the ravings of a yoghurt weaving hippie. Bah! Nonsense on stilts with skates on.  Bah! Lazy lack-lustre underdeveloped philosophy.<br />As for those who are harking on about how this is an instant classic, please remember that 'classic' is defined as standing the test of time, such superlatives are as ludicrous and loose as a Pullman plot line.<br />Oh the venom.
B0001ZMWQO|4.0|franz ferdinand are like this year's britney spears of &quot;indie&quot; rock. last year was yeah yeah yeahs, and the year before was the strokes. i love all these bands and own all the music they have put out, but these bands are far too derivative to be &quot;saving&quot; rock n roll, or making any real mark in music other than the fact that they are all pretty ok and are somewhat popular (shock! decent music selling records?!?)and they are being hailed as rock messiahs in a britney-ruled music world. which i guess is a bit of a feat. hmmmmm. ok im rambling. this album is pretty great, they sound like stripped-down, less distorted vocals strokes. its good stuff. &quot;michael&quot; is f***ing great. so i guess buy it. these guys deserve your money more than britney or sum 41. and hey, they get indie cred by being great friends with belle and sebastian. and one last thing... how come &quot;take me out&quot; starts out AWESOME, then gets really lame?
B000002LLC|4.0|Any pop album that includes music by the divine Sondheim deserves four stars just for the effort, even though it also includes such &quot;songs&quot; as Vogue...
B00006690G|4.0|A Phenominal piece of work by a rapper who has offically put himself in the ranks of Hip Hops ellite. Not saying he's the greatest rapper alive he'd have to fight Jay-z and Nas for that title. But on &quot;The Eminem Show&quot; Slim Shady is rarely seen, you  see more of Marshall Mathers rather than his two alter egos. If you want smart ass sarcasm sorry you only have &quot;Without Me&quot; and &quot;My Dads Gone Crazy&quot; to choose from. &quot;Superman&quot; explores mysogony and &quot;Buisness&quot; has a banging Dre back drop. But Eminem seems like he has actually found something to fight for on this album and not just swinging at pop stars and people who have backed him in a corner. &quot;Square Dance&quot; &quot;White America&quot; and &quot;Say Goodbye to Hollywood&quot; are great pieces of work that fight for himself and others. Cop this disc it's money well spent, &quot;Cleaning out My Closet&quot; and &quot;Sing For the Moment&quot; with an Areosmith sample are tear jerkers and hearing Dre &amp; Em toss rhymes back and forth like hot potatoe on &quot;Say What You Say&quot; is entertaining to listen to. &quot;Drips&quot; and &quot;When the Music Stops&quot; are the only songs that blow fat ones but two songs out of a 20 track LP doesn't leave this album tainted. Eminem is pushing thirty and he can't be rapping about what he used to, so it's good to see that has matured to an adult even though Slim Shady peeks his little head out a few times.
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|Franz Ferdinand. Franz Ferdinand. How do I love thee? I shall count the ways...<br />First of all, I love the name. Not only is it oratorically and phonetically sound, the meaning behind it seems almost anarchical. Indeed, the actual person Franz Ferdinand caused the first World War by his death. Maybe not anarchic, but the name is just perfect for a rock band.<br />I also love the music. Sometimes, you just need fun music, and Franz Ferdinand definitely delivers. My ultimate favorite, 'Take Me Out,' has this great, intoxicating rhythm that changes halfway through the song. You can scream to it, sing to it, tap your foot to it, whatever. Either way, after hearing this song a few times, you'll find yourself humming it, rather out of tunely, anytime there is silence.<BR>Another great song on the disc is 'Dark of the Matinee.' Although not engulfing all of the greatness of its predecessor, 'Take Me Out,' it still has a great sound, and in some senses, is more singable.<BR>Finally, 'This Fire,' is also a noteable song. I find myself repeating this one almost as often as 'Take Me Out.' This song has the beat, sound, rhythm, lyrics.<br />I also like the fact that for some reason, it feels like summer when I play the CD in my car. It's danceable, head banging, sing-along music that is priceless!<br />Let's face it; Franz Ferdinand is quite excellent. Really!
B00005K3OT|2.0|This movie was OK, but less than I expected, especially from the character as it was written, not as it was played by Johnny Depp - he was superb.  If you enjoyed this movie, definitely see THE MAN WHO CRIED with Depp and Christina Ricci.  I liked it better.
B0001LJCPC|5.0|What is the title of the music playing when Uma and Daryl Hannah face off in Budd's trailer (both with samurai swords)?<br />Thanks to anyone who can help me. Not sure if it's on the soundtrack.
0553573403|1.0|(...)I would read a book from the romance or erotica sections.  I'm not trying to be prudish, but I would like to see a little more sword-play and less sexual chess being played.<br />If you are a D&D playing, wargaming fanatic looking for some good fantasy battles, look elsewhere.
B000003TA4|5.0|These guys were obviously ahead of their times and even today i still listen to this cd in my truck and it still doesn't get old unlike anything rare these days...so if you still don't have this cd get it and if you already have it then get it again because maybe yours is scratched up from listening too damn much!!!
B00005Y7L4|5.0|I bought this DVD based on Amazon reviews, and it didn't disappoint. Unlike Series 7, which had nothing more than a concept, Battle Royale is an excellent movie on all fronts - plot, acting, script, cinematography, music-score. My only gripe was that some characters took a LOT of bullets before they finally died, can't help feeling this was a trifle unrealistic.<br />This movie is well worth buying, you can watch it over and over.<br />BUT I think the version I got had some scenes cut out! What is the basketball scene that you are all talking about? The only time I saw a basketball player was when Mimura's &quot;Za Saado Man&quot; program is released. And as for Kitano's obsession with Noriko, I only saw the ice-cream eating dream sequence and the rain-visit scene - was there more?
B000002H33|5.0|First of all, if you don't like heavy metal with screaming and growling, you may still love this CD.  I got into metallica after listening to crud like linkin park, and if it weren't for this CD, I probably would still be listening to Nu-Metal.  It really helped me as a stepping-stone into hardcore bands that I listen too more regularly (Killswitch Engage, Lamb of God, and Shadows Fall.<br />Now onto the review:<br />This is Metallica's best album.  The guitar riffs and drumming are both better than in Kill em' all and Ride The Lightning, and this CD best showcases their musical maturity before selling out, with ...And Justice for All (which by the way is a good CD, but after that their music stinks.)<br />I won't give each song a rating, because each one would end up getting five stars, instead I'll go through each song, explaining what it's like.  By the way, every song has some link to the CD topic, which is insanity.<br />The CD starts of with a beautiful acoustic guitar solo, but don't let that fool you, this is the second heaviest song on the CD.  Kirk's guitar playing really stands out in the awesome chorus of BA-TE-RY.  Next is the CD-named Master of Puppets, a song about the control drug dealers have over their &quot;puppets.&quot;  What is sort of ironic is that James Hetfield, the metallica singer, got into drugs a few years after this release.<BR>Next is The Thing That Shouldn't Be.  At first I really hated this song, but after a while I got used to it.  Kirk plays possibly the most awesome electric guitar solo in the history of all rock in this song.  Now comes Welcome Home, which is about being locked up in a insane asylum, It starts of quiet, and the verses get more desperate and desperate, until releasing an awesome chorus that will have jumping up and down.<BR>The CD then slows down with Disposable Heroes, which is about young soldiers having to go too war.  Hopefully, this song will make metalheads, rally against Bush in order to end this pointlesswar in Iraq.  The next song, Leper Messiah highlights some killer bass playing by the late Cliff Burton (you will be missed, metallica essentially died with you.)<BR>Next is my favorite track on the disc, Orion, an instrumental.  This song is probably my favorite out of all CD's I own, (over 200.)  What makes this song so amazing is that it is an instrumental! (No singing.)  It's indescribable.  The CD is worth buying just for this one song.  On this CD metallica certainly finishes up with a bang with Damage.Inc, which starts off with a killer bass intro by Cliff. This is the most fierce, and fast-paced song on the CD.<br />In summery- EVERY TRACK IS AWESOME.  A must get not just for metal fans but rock fans as well (yes, beatles fans too!)
B00001SIES|5.0|It's a modern day classic. I felt abit sad when i read the Amazon review of Showbiz, where is credit where credit is due? They've drawn their influences from Radiohead and Nirvana sure, but like any decent band they've diversified and come up with a completely differant sound, and what i love more, is a completely incomparable feel. Id have to say that after hearing all three albums to date, that i do like Showbiz the best, it's so original!! Its a deffinate must have, even if its not always on high rotation.
B000002H2H|5.0|Ride the Lightning is the best album metallica has ever done.  I liked this much better than kill em all because it is not mindless rampaging at all.  It is very well put together metal. <br />The best track, in my opinion is fight fire with fire because it has nice guitar and i heavy without being mindless.  The second best track is fade to black because it has nice guitar and is a slower song.  Other good ones are escape and call of ktulu.  <br />The worst song on here, i think is trapped under ice.  it doesnt flow well and gets on my nerves.  all the others are very good.  I highly recommend anyone who was even a little turned off by kill em all to try this album because it is not as heavy as people say.  <br />have a nice day
B00000IFP6|2.0|This is definitely not my favorite interpretation of the Beethoven symphonies. The orchestra is hurrying along without much depth. The worst thing for me is that the Beethoven spirit got lost. Compared to interpretations by Masur, Wand, Gardiner, Karajan etc. these warm and passionate works remain cold under Zinman's baton. As background music it's OK but if you are a serious listener who is looking for emotional depth these interpretations are not for you. There are other &quot;bargain&quot; editions of these works. For example, I recently purchased the Masur/Leipzig Gewandhaus edition for 32 Dollars. A far better choice.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|Ok, I didn't listen to the whole album. I didn't even buy it. Why? Cause I knew if I did, it would be a waste of my money. I heard &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; a million times on MTV cause thats what MTV does: they replay everything till you go insane. I thought it sucked. Then when the album came out I heard it was harder music than first album. So, I downloaded &quot;He Wasn't&quot;. Bad idea. Avril's vocals are horrible. Her voice is annoying. She's also a horrible writer...thats if she even WRITES her own music. <br />I hate it. I knew that if I heard only one song from the album and I hated it...I would hate the rest of the album too.
0767817486|5.0|This is an absorbing and arresting film. Since the first minute of the opening sequence , the dramatic mood will live in our heart .<br />The inner tension in the airport is perfectly made , the fear , the insane atmosphere in the turkish jails , the language obstacle , the hopeless , the dramatic sense when the Turkish Court gives the veredict in the middle of a bitter political conflict are a true landmark in its style.<br />John Hurt (Max) plays an unforgettable role as the addict friend of Billy Hayes (Brad Davis) and his performance is only overcome for The elephant man two years after this film.<br />Magnificent script and extraordinary performances.<br />A winner.
B00009V7P8|5.0|The sounds on this album delight the ear as a mixed-media collage delights the eye. If you're a sucker for a cello counterpart (think Kris Delmhorst plaing with Lori McKenna), you are particularly in luck. My favorites are Eskimo Friends, Amie, Cold Water, and Cannonball. Granted this album is &quot;uneven&quot; in production; some of the songs sound like they were recorded in someone's dining room, others are lushly produced with orchestral accompaniments. Never mind, you'll like all of it.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Wow, i was amazed when i got this cd. There are definately some big changes from their previous cd's. They wanted a more melodic sound and thats what they did and made it great. There are many highlight songs duality, Circle, and The Virus Of Life are just some of them. This cd is sooooo good definatley buy even of u dont like Slipknot and are into metal, i cant get unhooked from this cd, it is still the only cd i am listeing to ever since i got it a week ago.
B000267JQK|4.0|I think this is way better than the first Disclaimer.The songs are so much better ,they almost sound different altogether,i was very skeptical at first but i decided ah what the hell , i wanted to see what the DVD was all about anyway.Just about every song is good except for a few,same ones i didn't like on the first Disclamer ,Needles,Fxxx it, ,take me away ! ugh , thats just wrong , in my opinion, to repiticious for me , and i will have to agree with most reviewers Amy Lee totaly drowns Shaun out ! , but over all the Remastering is incredible, and i can't wait until the NEW album comes out !<BR>    ROCK ON !
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Look  i dont care what some people may say but this album is probly one of their best albums they ever made.  This album proves that they know how to make music.

0671027387|4.0|If you thought &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; and &quot;Angels and Demons&quot; were hard to believe, just wait till you get your hands on &quot;Deception Point.&quot;  There is no way this plot could ever happen.  But my guess is if you're picking up a Dan Brown book, you've already thrown reality out the window and are just looking for a fast-paced, smart thriller.  In this case, &quot;Deception Point&quot; will not let you down.  I read this book as a distraction, and it succeeded.  As with every other Dan Brown book, I couldn't put it down.  Cliffhanger after cliffhanger!  This book doesn't quite get as 'smart' as his others, but it's still way ahead of the competition.  I'm looking forward to reading the last of his that I haven't read, &quot;Digital Fortress.&quot;  This guy is my new summer reading.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|This is such a great CD...full of great rock 'n roll and also nice ballads. This CD never gets old. I even listen to it at work to keep me awake! It's obvious they had great influences like The Beatles and The Rolling Stones. If you like &quot;Are You Gonna Be My Girl&quot; then you'll definetly love the whole CD!!!!
B0000D96NW|5.0|First released in the UK back in Oct. '03. When I found out that it was finally gonna be released in the US with a brand new song, I immediately sold my import and waited for this one to come out, and I'm glad I did. The new track \\"Seasons Wither\\" fits in perfectly with the rest of the music. This hasn't left my CD carrier since April 20th (the release date). If you were disappointed with The Burning Red and Supercharger, but are willing to hear what they have this time, then do not hesitate to get Through The Ashes Of Empires now.
B000002J1M|5.0|For most bands thier forth album is thier Leftoverture and it was true with Genesis. 1972s Foxtrot is in every way a classic. Besides his usual flute, tamborine and bass drum Peter Gabriel played the oboe. Phil Collins did some fine drumming (note the bells on Suppers Ready). Suppers Ready itself is a masterpiece, at 23 minutes its the longest song Genesis ever made in any of its lineups but all the other tracks on the album are great too.
B0001AP12G|5.0|Wow. That's all I can say about Kanye. Delivering beats filled with some human feeling (unlike Timbaland's raw machine-like beats and the Neptunes's route of instrumental production) and lyrics that make you either think, laugh, or just chill to, Kanye delivers it all. His lyrics aren't the greatest, nor his flow, but the fact that he tries to balance both as well as the beats makes this a very exceptional album. There is no real bad track, just tracks that people like more than others (yes there is a difference).  The College Dropout is a very delicate balancing act, and Kanye has succeding in blurring the line between mainstream and underground rap, bringing in Mos Def with Ludacris, Jay-Z and Talib Kweli. Whether rapping about a tongue-in-cheek workout plan for women or giving Mos the mic to talk about serious issues using only two word lines, Kanye delivers a very complete album.
B000002J1L|4.0|Nursery Cryme was the third Genesis album of their early period (1967-1975) and even better then Trespass though thats a four star album too. Phil Collins and Steve Hackett were good additions to the band and the playing all around is quite good. The only drawback is the short throwaway songs For Absent Friends and Harlequin in the absence of a good long song. The 3 long songs on the album are very good as are the fun Harold The Barrel and the more dramatic Seven Stones.
B000268QB2|4.0|This band is more with the likes of Travis...once i heard the first few chords of their single, i thought to myself, ok a travis prodigy...which is not a bad thing, as more people should check that band out as well....However, I think that this band has the potential to make it in the mainstream, althgouh, i hope that they havent completely missed that streak of Alternative Brit light pop that was makiung more waves back in 2002 through '03....
B000002NZO|4.0|Genesis were at their best during their early period (1967-1975). Thats when they were at thier most creative and multitalented and Trespass thier second album perfectly shows this on all its long songs which are most of the album. The band play instruments here like the dulcimer and the cello. Tony adds his first synth, The Mellotron (a synth that makes multiple woodwind and string orchestra sounds) to his piano and organ on this album. Peter Gabrial who simply sang on the songs on the first album plays the accordian as well as the flute, tamborine and bass drum!! The band combine hard rock and beutifull baledry on all the songs save The Knife which is pretty much all hard rock. The only drawbacks are the shorter songs Dusk and Visions Of Angels which are simpler and less fleshed out then the other 4 songs but this album is a big improvement over From Genesis To Revelation (the band play more and show off thier talents nicely this time around) and the beggining of the band as a powerfull Prog Rock force.
B00006690G|5.0|Eminem has really matured and this album shows it the most. His debut album, The Slim Shady LP, had no real emotion or meaning in it and was mainly a joke album. His follow-up was The Marshall Mathers LP, an emotional, hateful attack on critics. In this new album, Eminem addresses current issues such as terrorism, but he still has some comedy in a couple of his songs. This CD also exposes Em's troubled past, talking about his negligent mother, coniving wife, and growing up in a poor neighborhood. This CD has the sound of a rap album with the spirit, emotion, and song writing talent of a classic.
B000002J1S|5.0|The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway is the longest album Genesis ever made, only double studio album and final album with Peter Gabrial. It was a wonderfull way to end his 7 album career with the group and thier early period. Altough Peter only plays flute on 5 songs on the album Cookoo Cocoon, In The Cage, The Lamia, Silent Sorrow In Empty Boots and The Light Lies Down On Broadway his presence is very strong on this album. Gabriel wrote the intro in the booklet, most of the songs and he naturally sang most of the songs while the rest of the group performed strongly as well especially Phil Collins who did some fine vibe playing. An elaborate concept album this is clearly the groups best album in any of thier configurations.
B000002J1O|5.0|Genesis made thier 2nd best album with Selling England By The Pound thier fifth album realeased in june 1973 in britain and November 1973 in the U.S. Genesis had used The Mellotron since Trespass and suposedly a clavinet on Genesis Live but the addition of other synthesizers into the group gave the band a more sophisticated edge and greatly enhanced and expanded their Prog Rock sound. Peter reprises his oboe playing and most the usual elements of Genesises early period are here, Peters fine flute, Tonys dynamic keyboards, Steves strong guitar work, Mikes steady bass and Phils intence drumming and this album features the bands second ever longest song the 12 minute Battle Of Epping Forest. The only drawback is the sappy More Fool Me but thats more then made up for by the other songs on the album.
B000084T18|1.0|Everytime i see or read things about 50 cent i just have to laugh...Why? Because people actually think he's saying something that's never been said before...Another example of mainstream audiences (mtv/vh1 generations) being taken by the &quot;thug&quot; image that 50 cent TRIES SO HARD TO FAKE..THIS ALBUM ISN'T FOR THE STREETS,HOODS,OR THE GHETTOS..THIS IS FOR THE LISTENER WHO STAYS IN A UPPER CLASS NEIBORHOOD,KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT STREET LIFE AND WANTS TO FEEL LIKE &quot;A THUG&quot; SO THEY LISTEN TO IT TO FEEL LIKE THEY DISPLAY AND &quot;HARD&quot; PERSON..DON'T BUY THIS...A FALSE REPRESENTATION....AND I WANT EVEN GET INTO HOW HE TRIES TO SOUND LIKE TUPAC...-5 STARS
0553801546|5.0|This is absolutely the best fantasy series out there, hands down. I have never been so emotionally wrapped up with a character in a book as I have been with Fitzchivalry. Martin and Jordan who? Give me a break. Not even close, trust me. Accolades to Robin Hobb. Excellent series as a whole, and this book was a great conclusion to it. I couldn't even pick up another book for a week after I finished this one, I knew I wouldn't find anything nearly as good to read!<BR>Keep up the good work, Mrs. Hobb!!!
B00008977N|5.0|Peter Gabrial: Vocals, piano, harmonica, tamborine and paddle Tony Levin: Bass, piano, tamborine and vocals David Rhodes: Guitar and vocals Shankar: Violin, tamborine and vocals Paula Cole: Vocals Levon Minassen: Doudouk Jean Claude Naimo: Synthesizers, piano, organ and vocals Manu Catche: Drums, tamborine and vocals <BR>Whilst I dont have the DVD I have the video which has a fine transfer and no dubbing so this review is based mainly on that. This is very good. The band play well and Peter shows his abilities as a dancer and actor (the visuals in themselves are amazing). Peters vocals are as strong as ever and the compositions (all as always written or cowritten by Gabriel are all great. Forget Phil Collins Live, for the ultimate live music expieriance watch a Peter Gabriel concert.
0385720920|5.0|This book rules, as do all of Palahniuk's books.
B000065VB9|5.0|On Peter Gabriel 3 Gabriel fully abandoned his Prog Rock past but came up with a dissonant and disturbing masterpiece which also featured world music suiting his soulfull voice. Gabriel writes all the lyrics without a single cowritter for the first time and he also plays instruments on all but one of the songs which add to the albums appeal. Gabriels songwritings incredible particularly on the scairy Intruder, No Self Control, the menacing (ballad!) Family Snapshot and the haunting Biko. This album also earns kudos for featuring Gabriels only studio album instrumental, Start.
0805062971|5.0|This book rules, as do all of Palahniuk's books.
B000065VA1|4.0|So is the closest to a pop album Peter Gabriel ever came but for all its commercialness Peter Gabriel was always an artist who focused more on quality then quantity and it shows on So. The album still manages to be challenging even with the hits and indeed with the hits. Once again Gabriel shows off his amazing dramatic range and big voice to great effect. The only weak track here is This Is The Picture which is kind of silly.
B0002858YS|3.0|After listening to this cd, the first thing I thought was, that was pretty good. The synth tones are a little casio, and the fake british accent is kind of lame. There are some great gems on this album, though. It is definitely worth a listen. I hope that they have the opportunity to make another album, because there is definite potential here. The 80's were fine and dandy, but recycling the sound only goes so far. All in all, it's a good album...not a great one.
B000002J29|2.0|Seconds Out is not the worst Genesis Live album but its close. Its tied with Three Sides Live as the second worst Live Genesis album. The absence of pictures of Peter Gabriel in fancy costumes and his stories is understandable but Collins sings the songs that he made famous very poorly and they are better suited for early Genesis live especially Suppers Ready (better both on the Gabriel archives and Foxtrot). On top of this only the mundane sacherine commercial ballad Afterglow is featured from Wind and Wuthering and not quality material which would have been good live like Eleventh Earl Of Mar and Wot Gorrila. Even worse though Steve Hackett plays very little on the album (possibly another reason he left the band) when it should have been a perfect conclusion to his career with the group. This is not an album thats worth collecting for any Genesis fans.
B000003TA4|1.0|In my original review I wrote that for any guitarist to be good he has to atleast be able to solo or shred, which is very true.  Then some dumba$$ replied soon after that there are many guitarists that are good that do not solo and shred.  I laugh!!!  I want a list of these so called guitarists.  So in retrospect then you are saying that kurt cobain was just as good as let's say Stevie Ray Vaughn, Jimi Hendrix, Joe Satriani, or Jimmy Page?  I think not.  Some other replies that have given them 5 stars have admitted that his music was extremely simple, but he made it sound good therefore he is good.  My friends $hit that smells good is still $hit.  Think about it!!!!!!
B000065V9Y|5.0|After the hugely successfull and commercial So Peter Gabriel decided to make an album which gave him less success but was better. Of cource Gabriels always been an artist who has rarly missed and mostly hit unlike say Phil Collins. US is an album which combines the best attributes of Peters career, often longish instrumentally and lyrically strong compositions and a fine voice.
B0000024JN|5.0|This is without question the best debut rap album.  no other debut compares to this and thats probably why its the best selling debut rap album ever.  if this never came out a lot of people (like kid rock or limp bizkit) would of never thought of mixing rap and rock the way the beasties did.  this has to be one of the most important albums in the history of music for 3 reasons.  1. it was the first rap album to top the charts 2. it was the the first rap album to go multi-platinum 3. it influenced more bands and artists than any of us will ever know<BR>those 3 reasons are reason enough to buy this album.  its great and even though some of it is kind of dated it doesn't matter cause the beasties and rick rubin thought of something that was never done before with commericial success by mixing rap and rock and making it work. the chili peppers are another band that did this too in the early days but they didn't have the commericial success they deserved until years later but thats another story.   the beasties are probably the most influential rap group of all time and i think it shows since their new album will most likely top the charts just like the 2 before it did.  now, come on what other rap group continually puts out albums nearly 20 yrs after they first blew up and still has success.  ok, thats what i thought.  then why don't u have this cd, go get it.  now!!!
B0001UL7RY|4.0|I haven't bought this record; I'm 45 years old and well, a bit to old for this stuff. But this young lady is miles ahead of  Britney and Christina.I think I might get the first one though-damn 15 years old at the time-incredible!!<BR> Hold this record for ten years and play it against the other crap of the time and this one will shine threw.
B000002LQR|5.0|this is definetely the best album of the 90's along with nirvana nevermind and pearl jam ten and green day dookie and a bunch of others i can't think of off the top of my head.  why? cause most of the music heard on the radio today (i.e. linkin park, 311, limp bizkit) owe something to this album.  it is the best album of all time and it sounds just as fresh today as it did in 1991.  unfortunetly this is probably the peppers artistic peak even though their music now is awesome too but this album captures them at the top of their game and creating an album that spawned countless imitators.  nothing compares to this album and its like the dark side of the moon or led zeppelin IV of back in black in the sense that its songs will be on the radio 20 yrs from now and they will never age and this album will always sell because of the impact it had.  its timeless, truely timeless.  anyway these reaaons should certainly be enough for you the reader to buy this album so i think you should press the add to cart button right now because you'll be kicking yourself if you don't get into this album and this band any later than now.
B000002UV1|5.0|Man, if only I could find the words to describe what it was like to be me in 1989...seventeen years old, living in a little hick town, and finding this album. What a liberating blast of funk-punk-sex-rap-rock in a world where Bocephus ruled.<BR>\\"Good Time Boys\\" kicked the door open and showed off new guitarist John Frusciante, a rock song in the truest sense (note the sample of \\"Bonin' in the Boneyard\\" by Fishbone and \\"White Girl\\" by X). The catchy, uptempo remake of \\"Higher Ground\\" slowly grew into a rock radio hit for the Peppers. The funky \\"Subway to Venus\\" is a refreshing little slap on the face that almost dares you to sit still while listening (favorite line: \\"...if I can't make ya dance, I guess I'll just have to make ya piss ya pants...\\"). \\"Magic Johnson\\" is a funky, drum n' bass-driven ode to their favorite player of their beloved LA Lakers (although you have to wonder if the song might have been different if he had come out about his HIV beforehand). \\"Nobody Weird Like Me\\" is the Peppers doing what they did best...showing off the explosive, hyper-energy freakshow that they were in the late 80s: \\"the freakiest show I know is the show of my own...livin' my life in and out the twilight zone...\\"<BR>The only hint of the cynicism that began surfacing on BloodSugarSexMagik comes in \\"Punk Rock Classic,\\" when Anthony Keidis snipes at the music industry: \\"...just put us in a category, yes it's a must...\\" and the song ends with John Frusciante playing a dying few seconds of the opening to \\"Sweet Child o' Mine.\\"<BR>BloodSugarSexMagik was an amazing follow up to this, but the differences between the two albums almost make you think it's two different bands. The whole album is a hyper, energizing experience, and is probably my favorite early RHCP album.<BR>For the folks who think \\"Under the Bridge\\" was how they got their start, pick up Mother's Milk and edify yourself.<BR>Buy it!
B00008H2LB|5.0|Linkin park is awesome and all the people that think otherwise should shut up and listen to they're talentless bands that nobody gives a rats behind about.  Ok, linkin park sux, ok then whats good?  What, death metal where the singer sounds like the cookie monster or chingy or the cure or the other whiny british (or whereever the're from) bands (i.e. cold play, radiohead). coldplays descent but the other bands suck and they have nothing but the hardcore fan base who likes any crap they put out.  i'm not saying sales are really important, they're not, i'm just saying not to judge music by its sales and say &quot;oh thats on mtv, thats on the radio, that sells, oh it must be bad&quot; just cause it sells doesn't mean its bad. oh thats means the beatles must be the worst band ever cause they're the biggest selling band.  wrong. the beatles are brilliant. so are linkin park (to a much lesser extent).  so are the mars volta who probably not many people know about.  so are chili peppers (who linkin park owe their sound to). anyway, meteora is awesome, even though its not as good as the first album, its definitely a worthy followup and puts to rest any chance of a sophmore slump. with the new (and 5th) single, breaking the habit just hitting the airwaves, we're sure the see the album climb back up the charts and pass the 5 million mark.  i also think easier to run would have been a better choice as a single than any of the other ones they put out so far.  thats the in the end of meteora and it that was released it would do for meteora what in the end did for hybrid theory.  anyway every song on here is awesome (except for number 12, which isn't nearly as good as cure for the itch).  thats usually the only track i skip. but anyway this is probably one of the best albums of 2003 and the fans have proved that with it's massive first week sales and its continuing success.  now lets all cram the lp haters in a car and push them off a cliff and yell &quot;hooray!!&quot;
B0000AOV85|4.0|The &quot;Classic Albums&quot; series, which began as a program on VH-1, takes one popular rock record and - using demo tapes, separated recorded tracks, archival footage and interviews with artists, producers and engineers - tells the story of its creation by dissecting it, song by song. The series previously took engaging looks into The Grateful Dead's &quot;American Beauty&quot; and Steely Dan's &quot;Aja,&quot; among others, but &quot;Classic Albums: Dark Side of the Moon&quot; may be its best volume yet.<BR>  <BR>Pink Floyd's &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; LP is the 1973 &quot;space rock&quot; aural masterpiece that catapulted the group into the big leagues; the record spent a mind-boggling 741 weeks within the Billboard Top 100 and still remains a cultural and musical touchstone.<BR>  <BR>Through conversations with band members Roger Waters, David Gilmour, Rick Wright, Nick Mason, engineer Alan Parsons and various critics and artists, the documentary reveals how the group did it, how they created such a unique and innovative soundscape in an era before personal computers, sampling and modern synthesizers (short answer: with talent, hard work and lots and lots of tape machines). <br />After years of the bickering and legal brawling between Waters and Gilmour, it's nice to see them happily chatting in agreement on at least one thing: that, together, they made one of the greatest rock albums ever.<br />The documentary also gives a face to the lesser-known voices on the album, including the amazing singer Clare Torry, as well as the random people who supplied the album's strange, background conversations (one of whom was a doorman at Abbey Road Studios).<BR>  <BR>But the most interesting revelation the film provides is that, behind all its sound effects and echo chambers and searing guitars and concept-album subtexts, &quot;Dark Side&quot; is really just an album about singing the blues.
B000000W5B|4.0|Goats Head Soup isn't as good as Exile on Main St., but really.. what IS?  I personally think it's a fitting follow up to the power that Exile held.  Goats Head Soup is definitely more low-key, but the songs still have a strong groove to them.  The songwriting is just as strong as Exile, just not quite as daring.  The album is packed with more straight-up rock songs and less dabbling in the blues and country.  Also, who can deny that &quot;ANGIE&quot; is one of the best songs ever?  The only thing that kept me away from this album for sometime was the cover art.  It's gotta be one of the worst in rock history.  And the name.. what the hell?  I know the band has a dark sense of humor, but Goats Head Soup is an ugly name for such a good album.  But leave those reservations aside and get this album for some of the Stones' best music.
0064407667|5.0|I have to say, childrens books these days are just amazing.  I'm almost 20, and read constantly, and yet every once in a while I pick up books like Harry Potter, or in this case, A Series of Unfortunate Events.  I have to say, these books are more inventive, more intelligent, and more fun to read than most books coming out intended for adults.  These books don't care about being silly, and creating a world that isn't linked to the real one, because the audience for these books wouldn't really care.  They allow themselves to be totally pulled in to these wonderful, and in this case dark, worlds.  Adults on the other hand... not so much.  They get caught up in the \\"that can't happen\\" or the \\"that's not right.\\"  Oh well.<br />As this book goes, it's a winner.  Not only is the story amazing, but it also tends to be written at a very high reading level, and yet takes time to explain words to it's young readers, helping expand their vocabularies.  That, in and of itself, should make any parent pick up these books.  Your kids will be learning like crazy! It even helped my vocabulary, which is funny, since I haven't learned so many amazing words, and I'm in college, and studying english!  Plus, the characters are amazing, and very good role models.  Pick up this book soon.  Recomended for both adults and children.
B00000DGXN|5.0|This is a refreshingly listenable Jazz cd.  In short, love it, love it, love it.<br />Mr. Burton on the vibes, Mr. Metheny on the guitar, Mr. Corea on the keys, and Mr.Hanes on the drums.  People who understand Jazz does not have to reflect Pop music, but Jazz can stand on it's own.
B00005K3NR|5.0|This movie is a horror film yes. But it's not as scary as films now a days. This film is about a girl named Carrie White. She is picked on everyday and has no friends. Soon she figures out she has telekenetic powers. She reseaches it and learns that other people have it. Her mother sees that she has that power and is upset. Her mother thinks that everything is a sin. If you ask me the mother is the scariest thing about this movie. Then  the classic prom scene. Almost everyone is dead. Carrie goes home and kills her mother and the house collapses. No more Carrie.
B000089CJI|5.0|I first heard &quot;Brand New Colony&quot; on my friend's iPod in English class. We both started crying.<br />I bought the CD after previewing just a few of the other songs, and as kind of an impulse buy it was an excellent decision. The vocals are wonderful, the music is catchy and the lyrics are awesome. All the songs are good, although &quot;This Place is a Prison&quot; is the weakest lyrically. &quot;The District Sleeps Alone Tonight&quot;  stands out, as does &quot;Nothing Better,&quot; which is kind of a duet, &quot;Brand New Colony&quot; and &quot;Clark Gable,&quot; especially the chorus. &quot;I want so badly to believe, that 'there is truth, that love is real'...&quot; I'm not sure what to compare The Postal Service to, as they are so different from everything else I've heard. They're amazing. Just amazing.
B0000009XP|5.0|The original French issue title, the Blues Giant, more accurately reflects the greatness of this recording, which I would have to rank as  one of  my favorite blues recordings. All of the six tracks are superb, though over  the years my favorite came to be the concluding slow blues, When I Left Home, which is startling in its passionate ferocity. I Smell a Rat  is actually Damn Right I've Got the Blues, in another guise, by the way. Apparently blues purists often dislike  this recording, but if you love electric blues guitar, don't listen to them. When Buddy is at his best (and he is pretty near so on this recording), only Hendrix can compare. Lovers of this recording might also want to pick up Pleading the Blues, an excellent Junior Wells recording featuring the very same band and recorded on the very same day. Two classic albums recorded in one day, no less.
B000000OSE|5.0|okay this is one of the best bands there ever was and this is a great cd with such classics at &quot;november rain&quot; and &quot;dont cry&quot; i really dont think that they were looking to make one of the best rock cds of all time by adding the use your illusions together they did the smart thing and released them as 2 seperate cds and made more money because both of them went platinum oh ya axl rose wrote november rain not izzy stradlin why do you think axl is singing it axl was guns n roses but in away he is not they just could get back together axl should apologize to slash and them and be like yo slash im sorry for being a hooligan i love you man lets go sell millions of records.
B000003TA4|5.0|The actual track legnth for #12 (Something In The Way) is about 20 minutes. Wait about 9 minutes after the song (about 13 min into the track) and you'll hear a 7 minute instrumental jam that I like to call &quot;Mosquito Bite.&quot; That, to me, cements Kurt Cobain's position as one of the greatest guitarists ever.<br />Everything else on here is awesome too.
0671027387|4.0|This book proves the value of story over credibility. Take a labored premise, adolescent dialog, and &quot;Wile E. Coyote&quot; action sequences tied together with a series of deus ex machinae that would embarrass a high school freshman writing his first short story, and you have an inkling of what &quot;Deception Point&quot; is like. Literature it ain't, but it is one heck of a read. This potboiler of Washington politics, popular science, fears overcome, and love reawakened will have you leaping from page to page.
B00006879E|4.0|This album does exactly what it sets out to do, make us have a great time while listening. With a very innovative sound, and a exceedingly charismatic lead vocalist, Maroon 5 is just a purely enjoyable band. The irresistabe &quot;This Love&quot;, and catchy &quot;Harder To Breathe&quot; make this one killer record. Other worthy tracks like &quot;Tangled&quot;, &quot;Secret&quot;, &quot;Sweetest Goodbye&quot;,  and &quot;She Will Be Loved&quot; vastly increase the albums likeability . The best cut in my opinion is the charming &quot;Sunday Morning&quot;, which has an alluringly sweet sound that you would love to play on a...well Sunday Morning. This is a fun record to add to your collection, and I highly recommend it.
B000001FI7|5.0|There are few albums in this world that I have ever regretted selling, one of them is Portishead's amazing debut album &quot;Dummy&quot;. I sold my copy a couple of years ago because I was short on cash but since then I had come to regret selling my copy of this stellar masterpiece in downtempo music. I was fortunate to find a used copy at my favorite record store today so I bought it. Along with Massive Attack, Portishead has helped to forge a new sub-genre of music in the dance genre most people know as 'trip hop' music. &quot;Dummy&quot; personifies the laid back grooves that fuses hip hop beats, jazz melodies, and sensual female vocals that helped influenced later trip hop acts like  Olive, Zero 7, and Supreme Beings of Leisure. &quot;Dummy&quot; definitely was ahead of its time when it came out ten years ago.  Beth Gibbons' plaintive wail and the laid back grooves was nothing that I heard of at the time. It was the break through single &quot;Sour Times&quot; that attracted me to Portishead. I could imagine hearing it play in the background in a James Bond film. It had that sensuous, mysterious sound that would have been ideal for a James Bond film. One of my favorite songs on the album is the ballad &quot;Roads&quot;. It is one of the most beautiful songs that Portishead had ever created. I also love the opening track &quot;Mysterons&quot;. I am so glad that I bought &quot;Dummy&quot; again. Next time I will know better than to sell it. It is one of those albums that should not be sold. One more thing, contrary to what a reviewer wrote, Beth Gibbons has only released one solo album as herself. The artist known as &quot;Poe&quot; is a completely different artist and is not Beth Gibbons herself. Poe is an American artist while Beth is from England.
B00009V7P8|5.0|I am so in love with this album, from start to finish it grabs you and never lets go. This is a album that I use to enter full and utter musical bliss, it is so calming and moving. When I listen to the music, that mesmerizing and enchanting music, I just cry from the beauty it. Everything works, from the lyrics, to the singing, to the production it is a masterpiece of music. Damien Rice has forever placed a spot for his music in my heart.
B0000026SF|4.0|Europes first and least &quot;produced&quot; album.  No that doesn't mean the sound quality is bad (this was 1983 what do you want?) but it means that they were a young band free to write as they pleased.  No big power ballads, no party songs, just some chugging metal with great leads and vocals.  It isn't the most solid album of their career but it does have some of their better moments with In The Future To Come, Seven Doors Hotel (Their best song Ever IMO), Memories, and The King Will Return.  Still a great album that showed where these guys could have gone had the hair wave not snapped them up and eventually ruined them.
B00003W8NM|5.0|This is a great movie based off of an equally great novel.  Chuck P. always writes off the wall story lines, and this one is no exception.  The movie's cast put on great preformances about the unmasculization (if thats a word) of modern men.  Many people complain about the violence, but without it the point wouldn't come accross so well.  I'd reccommend this movie to most, especially those who are young white, and possibly angry, young males.  Then read the book.  And the authors other books too.
B00005AWMF|5.0|If I were restricted to review Sade's music in just five words they would be sensual, passionate, feminine, melodious and soulful. Removing one word from the list would not do full justice to her style of music making.<br />The first time I heard Sade was in the early 90's and the song was Smooth Operator. I guess I was late in discovering her music but I knew this was one singer I should not disregard. Over the years and after so many songs one of my personal favourite remains \\"Cherish the day\\". I was floored when I heard this song for the first time and could not really make out what was so magical about this that makes me want to listen to it again and again. Later it dawned on me that the lyrics and the bass line were perfectly synchronised at 1:36 into the song when she sings \\"Show me how deep love can be\\" and at this very instant the bass guitar kicks in producing very low and deep bass. It is not powerful as on some other tracks notably \\"No Ordinary Love\\", but to me it is deep enough having the capability to penetrate the marrow. Another surprise was the voice of Sade suddenly envelops you from all sides instead of the dead centre when again the lyrics are repeated at 3:48 into the song. The other favourite of mine is \\"No ordinary Love\\" which I already mentioned earlier. This song has a very good beat throughout, deep and powerful bass, soulful lyrics, and a melody to match the package.<br />I would say the overall quality of the album is first class. In fact better than some of the complete albums, let alone compilations. I consider it to be one of the best compilations that I have had the pleasure of laying my hands on. I personally detest compilations, as they never do justice to the sound quality. Why? Basically the engineer has to ensure that all the songs more or less have similar output, meaning, the volume remains same all the way from first to the last track. This actually disturbs the sanctity of the original album's dynamic range. Since this CD isnot a complete album but a compilation; I must evaluate it accordingly. The mastering engineer has done a commendable job of making this CD sound like a complete album, surely no sign of compression. I would rate this album very highly as I found the sound quality in general to be exceptionally good. Bass aficionados would certainly not be disappointed. <br />You come across two types of compilations, one being greatest hits, comprising of songs mainly doing well in the charts, the other being best of, songs that are critically acclaimed but not necessarily the hits. This CD is not just a very good sounding collection of Sade's greatest hits but also happens to be superbly compiled with just the best of what Sade has to offer- A String of Pearls!
6305531374|2.0|It seems that the only reason people say that this is the best Halloween sequel, and that it matches the style of the original, yadda, yadda, yadda, is because Jaime Lee Curtis revives her role as Laurie Strode. It is WAY overrated, and it truly boggels me why so many people give it *** stars and up. It's not scary AT ALL, and it doesn't even LOOK like it's taking place on Halloween. And it's just BORING. But I really can't give it under two stars. It's just not THAT bad. I wouldint reccomend it unless you feel you must watch every Halloween movie.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|when someone says nothing of their image and just wants to make music, they probably just want to make music. anyway, despite the fact avril NEVER said she was punk nor any specific type of music, her 2nd release is much edgier with a better sound and better vocals. most would agree that the best song is &quot;how does it feel&quot;. it is an absolutely amazing slow-ish song with great violin parts and a climactic end with beautiful, natural high notes from avril. an edge proves the right direction for avril. i was hoping for 5 or 6 good songs....i got a surprise...EVERY song on the disc is amazing. i recomend this for any music lover who listens to sound and doesnt spend their time criticizing an image.
6305971099|2.0|Halloween 5 is, in my opinion, the most underrated of all the Halloween sequels. People immediately bash it becuase of the Meyers house turning into a big, gothic mansion, the bad mask, the silly music that plays when the &quot;comic relief&quot; cops are shown, the annoying charectors, and the overrall cheesiness of it. So, the problems are pletntiful...and I agree that those are all defintely bad things, but it still managaes to entertain and scare (me, atleast)...Daniel Harris, tho she doesn't have much to say in this installment, does what she can good. Donald Pleasence again plays his role as Dr. Loomis very well. Really, the only things that irratate me (besides those listed before) include the murder of Rachael; this would have been alot better if she had stayed alive for the whole film and fought beside Jaime., and the way that Michael stalks Tina and Sammy for no reason. Then again, why did he stalk Jaime, Lynda, and Annie in the first? The box for Halloween also lies. It says something like &quot;He's back, and this time they're ready&quot;; well, no, they're not. And it also boast that Michael will be unmasked; we barely get a glimpse of his face in poor light. And besides, we saw his face in the first one almost perfectly already! Overall, I DO reccomend the fifth installment despite its many problems.
B0001Z53CY|4.0|Well this cd in my opnion was good but Devils Night was better.How u ask with songs that have no sense to be made like 40 oz,My Band,D12 World,Every Skit,That old,old song Keep Talkin' and another old,old song 6 In The Morning (these songs were featured on The Invasion Part 2 &amp; 3 Hosted by DJ Green Lantern).Without these tracks which i think were not good excpet Keep Talkin',6 In The Morning but the fact of these songs being old makes some of this CD a bunch of fillers.My band was probably the worst single this year released the only thing that was good was the video was funny and Bizarres verse was funny.Besides that the single sucked.Thats the bad part of D12 World.The good part is there are allot of good other tracks like (Loyalty,Git Up,Just Like U,Good Die Young,American Physco 2,Get My Gun).These were some good songs but Eminem switched up his style and its all weird in this CD.But listen to *Welcome 2 D-Block* on *Kiss of Death* he is back to his old self or *Warrior Part 2* on *The Hunger For More*.Anyway this CD was about 4 they didnt live up to the Hype or to Devils Night.They said they were gonna be more mature and make serious songs ala (My Band,40 ox,D12 World,Every Skit) they didnt become higher on a mature level they fell down a natch.But overall the CD wasnt that bad.But it could've been better if they took out those tracks and added new tracks and new skits.

B00006879E|5.0|Any pop rock fan who doesn't like Maroon 5 is CRAZY! They are so talented and have the best songs! It's not like other CDs where only a few a songs are good- every single song on this CD is amazing! There aren't enough words that can truly describe Maroon 5. They are so mesmerizing and addicting. The voice, the beat, takes you to a blissful place. You just have to listen all day and all night long.

B000053VAF|3.0|I should probably start this review by saying that Dogma was forced on me by my best friend, an avowed Kevin Smith fanatic.  Having only seen Chasing Amy before (and enjoying it a great deal), I was quite ready to dip into a movie by the same writer.  It stirred up a fair bit of controversy at the time, although having watched it I can say it's not actually that controversial.  Indeed, it's embracement of all 'ideas' comes almost perilously close to schmaltz.  Saying that, this is exactly the kind of screwball humour I love.  See, there are two disgraced angels (Damon and Affleck) who find a dogmatic loophole through which they can re-enter Heaven, thus ending the world by proving God to be fallible.  So it falls upon Linda Fiorentino's lapsed Catholic, as recruited by The Voice of God (Alan Rickman), to put a stop to their dastardly plans.  Along the way she's aided by prophets (Jay and Silent Bob), the forgotten 13th apostle (Chris Rock) and a muse (Salma Hayek).  All against Jason Lee's horn-headed baddie.<br />The humour comes thick and fast, with some absolutely classic scenes involving Damon's Loki exacting vengeance on a board meeting, Alanis Morissette's God doing handstands after defeating the apocalypse and some very very brilliant pop culture references.  The acting is also crucial, with particular stand-outs including Damon's most freewheeling role yet, Fiorentino treading a fine line between the serious and the comical and Affleck proving that with the right script and a role that doesn't reek of self-satisfaction (Pearl Harbour anyone?) he can be a very likeable, good, performer.  It of course goes without saying that the supporting cast is uniformally excellent.<br />Still, the script does pander to vulgarity several times, which you'll either lap up or resent given the nuance, interesting humour of the rest of the movie.  Smith also has a slight tendency to over-talk his script, as if to constantly to remind us that this is a satire and not somethingto be taken seriously.  Whilst he points out in an ironic foreword that this should be evident ten minutes in, he still feels the need to hammer it in a little too much.  Saying that though, the serious elements of the story are mostly done very well, thanks in no part to Fiorentino.  Destined to become some kind of cult classic among Smith fans, this is a much smarter and funnier comedy than any of the one I've seen this year yet.  So, whilst not brilliant perhaps, at the very least Dogma is witty, vibrant and original.
B000000WF0|5.0|This is one of those timeless albums that you can listen to now (six years after its initial release) and still enjoy it.  Each of the songs still sound as fresh as today as they did back in 1997.  With this album, the Verve hit a homerun.<br />I remember I was browsing through a CD store when I first heard &quot;Bittersweet Symphony.&quot;  It immediately caught my attention, and I stood rooted on the spot just listening.  Very few times has an album jolted me like that, but this was one of those times.  I asked the clerk who this was and he said that it was from the new album by The Verve.  After &quot;Bittersweet&quot; was over, he told me to hold on and listen to  &quot;Lucky Man.&quot;  It was after that I was sold -- I had to buy the album.<br />On this album, you get 13 little masterpieces -- there's not a filler track in the bunch.  Besides the excellent songwriting, the production is outstanding.  I haven't heard such a good mix of strings since Tony Visconti's work with T. Rex -- just listen to &quot;Lucky Man,&quot; &quot;Bittersweet Symphony,&quot; or &quot;Sonnet&quot; for proof.<br />The only downside is that the group broke up after this -- their finest moment!  Of all the dumb luck.  While Richard Ashcroft has gone on to do a couple of solo albums, they don't seem to capitalize on what The Verve had done on this album.  Yes, he's the voice, the did much of the writing, but as the old saying goes: the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.<br />Best album of the 1990's?  This one, no question about it.  After the Britney's, the Justin's, and all the other drivel from that era fades, this will be one of the albums people look back upon fondly.  Rating: A+
0312995423|1.0|After enjoying Da Vinci Code I was excited to see this one on the shelf. The excitement didn't last 10 pages. If you know nothing about software this might be a good read. However if you know even a tiny amount the errors are so glaring that the most strenuous attempt to &quot;suspend disbelief&quot; fails. I expected better from Dan Brown. Add that to the weak and silly plot contrivances and flat characterizations I finally put the book down half read, something I never do. This is an adventure/thriller and my standards are not high there but this book fails to meet even that minimum.
6304698623|5.0|After all the times I have viewed this movie, it still makes me laugh and cry!  Parts of this movie have some of the best and most beautiful filming techniques I have ever seen  and the colors and richness of the sets are magnificent. The weaving together of the Indian, shall I say, myth/tale and English boardinghouse storyline is wonderful. When I think of our battered world, I wish it was really so, that all girls are princesses (and all boys, princes). Worth seeing over and over again!!! Liesel Matthews is great!
B0002234LS|5.0|I loved the movie.  Johnny Depp once again turns in an amazing performance.  If you like thrillers and you like Johnny Depp, this movie is for you.  I guarantee you won't be disappointed.
078681859X|5.0|Some of the most entertaining, original, and exciting books being published today are not by the John Grishams and the Tom Clanceys of the literary world but instead a new crop under the mantle of, \\"Young Adult Books\\". Authors like Cornelia Funke and Christopher Paolini are writing original and magical worlds that are being devoured by as many adults as young people who are looking for more beyond Harry Potter.<br />English writer Jonathan Stroud adds what I feel is one of the very best, including the Potter canon, with the first of a planned trilogy, 'The Amulet of Samarkand'.<br />Young apprentice Nathanial is frustrated by the meager teachings from his C level magician guardian. His own studies have, in his mind, already surpassed what his master knows. After a humiliating experience at the hands of a pompous colleague of his master, Nathanial plans revenge with the help of Bartimaeus, a five thousand year old djinni. Telling the story from both their perspectives as the situation careens wildly out of control, Stroud creates a wonderfully original page turner. Bartimeaus is a fanatstic character who illustrates many finer points with the help of hilarious footnotes. It's too bad the series is only a trilogy for this is a franchise I'd love to see go beyond three books.
B00009V7P8|5.0|I cannot believe that anyone could review this album and give it less than 5 stars. It is simply stunning. <br />This is without doubt the best cd I have heard in the past 5 years.  It bears comparison with Buckley's Grace but in essence O is a superior album.  It boasts more emotion than Grace and is somehow more fragile. <br />A truly excellent work from Damien Rice.  The only criticism I have of this cd is that it will be impossible to follow it up.
B00004Y87O|5.0|There's always something bizarre, in a very cool way, about watching a futuristic movie set in a year we've already passed. It's very eerie. Released in 1981, \\"Escape From New York\\" opens to explain that in 1988, Manhattan Island was transformed into a Maximum Security Prison surrounded by a massive wall from every angle, guarded by police, with landmines at every exit route. The film is set in 1997, when terrorists bring down Air Force One, president and all, right into the heart of the forbidden island. Luckily, the president has survived thanks to his escape pod, and a rescue team is immediately dispatched in an effort to retrieve him and his special cargo. The president carries with him a cassette tape (very futuristic, eh?) of recorded information that could bring peace to the currently warring nations, but the time left with which to use it in is short. The rescue team finds the escape pod empty, and is soon approached by a loony prisoner with a grim message. The president has been taken captive by the A-Number One inmate of Manhattan Island, The Duke of New York. This is a job for... SNAKE PLISSKEN!    Yes, Snake Plissken: war hero; the youngest man ever to be decorated by the president; and recently, bank robber. Before being condemned to join the other inmates of Manhattan Island, Snake is made an offer. Go in, come back with the president and the tape before the clock runs out, and get a full pardon. But to sweeten the deal, another card is played. Snake is injected with two tiny capsules into his bloodstream. If he doesn't make it back in time to have the capsules neutralized, they will explode and rupture his arteries, killing him immediately. The only thing Snake really cares about anymore is himself, so now he has no choice. He must fly a glider into the heart of the city, locate the president and his tape, and together, they must escape from New York!    John Carpenter creates another masterpiece with \\"Escape From New York.\\" The city is turned into atruly intimidating, downright frightening environment, with every kind of crazy one could think of. Kurt Russel as Snake Plissken, creates one more of those wonderful iconic anti-heroes the likes of Bruce Campbell's Ash and Rowdy Roddy Piper's Nada; self-serving, gruff, and full of great one-liners, but always doing the right thing when it comes down to it. The always fun Ernest Borgnine is great as Cabbie, Harry Dean Stanton is perfect as Brain, and Donald Pleasance and Isaac Hayes are also well cast, as was the entire film. Carpenter's usually haunting music runs throughout, and the adventure and action is non-stop. A must have for all fans of the sci-fi anti-hero genre and apocalyptic future films. Sorry I can't comment on the Special Edition DVD, but I currently only have the bare bones edition. It sounds great though, and I definitely want to get it. Mine does include the theatrical trailer though, and it's very cool. Love those creepy theatrical trailers for sci-fi films of the late 70s and early 80s. \\"Escape From New York\\" was followed by a sequel in 1996, \\"Escape From L.A.\\" Some (maybe most) may find the sequel overly campy, with too many special effects and too much comedy. I have to confess that I slightly prefer L.A., probably for those very reasons. I'm not huge on camp, but it seemed to work well with the material. The plot was fairly similar though, and both movies have GREAT twist endings.

0060977493|5.0|&quot;They all crossed into forbidden territory. They all tampered with the laws that lay down who should be loved and how. And how much.&quot; - God of Small Things<br />This is such an amazing book, that I hardly know where to begin with my praize. First of all, Roy´s language and imagery is like a silk garment that just rolls of the mind in ripples upon ripples upon ripples. It is absolutely beautiful and breathtaking. She has such a way with words that you just sit back in awe of her brilliance, and marvel at how she does it. <br />The story itself is a rather universal one, meaning it deals with love and loss, but the execution of it is what makes it so extraordinary. Roy take great steps in showing what fear and resentment, in one way or another, does to a person. How small, vindictive and narrow-minded it makes them. And how that vindictiviness can destroy another human being. It deals with the gentle nature of love and those who want to destroy it in the most brutal of ways.<br />The book is told from the perspective of the two twins, Estha and Rahel and while it jumps from the past to the present there is no problem at all with keeping the two seperated. Maybe because it all comes together so magnificently in the end. Roy is particularly gifted in relaying the story told from the eyes of an innocent child. She carries the vulnerability of the events in Estha and Rahel´s past on their sleeves. <br />Secondly, the love story that crosses the line that is not to be crossed, is somewhat the center of the theme, intertwining past events with the book´s title. It shows in the most remarkable of ways that even though their love may not have been allowed, it was still worth challenging the laws that made it so.<br />This book is a masterpiece. A+
B000089RVX|5.0|Evanescence is awesome. I love Bring me to Life, Going Under, Hello, Everybody's Fool, and Tourniquet. I really love this band, and for the people who call it simple- who cares? Its really good. one of the best cds ive bought buy it.
0446677450|5.0|Have you noticed how everytime a positive, accurate and honest 5 star review get's posted here, it is immediately followed by a swarm of negative, false, 1 star reviews? Hmmmmm. Interesting!<br />The other thing that I find interesting is how these people know what is going on on so m any other websites. No wonder they are broke and frustrtaed...they are too busy checking out web sites to really do anything positive to create wealth! Meanwhile, Kiyosaki students are out there making money by doing the deals.<br />I guess that explains their bitterness.
B000002H97|1.0|I am appalled. How did this sell so unbelievably well? Ah yes. It's because they abandoned anything resembling a heavy metal 'edge', and embraced generic 4/4 rhythms, combined with putrid mainstream-yearning lyrics, spewed upon by a wah-wah pedal that the 'lead guitarist' doesn't know how to turn off, set against a steady rhythm that...hello....what's this? Ah! The drummer is hitting cymbals on irregular beats! How crazy! He must be the best drummer in the world!!!<br />Oh yeah, and the bass sucks. It's...Yeah. Basically, pick up a bass, grab a pick, and pluck the top (4th) string open, as follows:<br />--0---<br />And that, my friend, is the TAB for this entire album.<br />Yucky. Best listened to whilst attempting to swat flies, for it encapsulates the essence of the inability to feel comforted at the fact that all things annoying are resting and out of your way.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|After putting out her hit laden CD Letting Go, many critics thought that Avril Lavigne's next CD would perhaps be a flop, as many new artists experience the &quot;sophomore jinx&quot;. This CD proves all those critics wrong. The CD Under my Skin, is a &quot;hit&quot; laden CD, that shows what an extreme talent Avril Lavigne is. <br />I recommend buying this CD. If you like this CD, I recommend buying Avril's first CD Letting GO.
B00005JMEW|5.0|In keeping with Tarantino tradition, the body count is high, the profanity flies, and the soundtrack kicks. &quot;Kill Bill&quot; is a tour de force, with the familiar Tarantino storytelling devices, such as chapters and a non-linear storyline. I found the amount of blood in this film surprising, even with having had full knowledge as to the nature of the film prior to heading to the theater. Where other movies would have pulled away after the slash of a sword, Tarantino delights in showing the audience the aftermath of each hack and slice. The result is a mixture of elicited emotions - from revulsion to slack-jawed amazement.<br />It's obvious that Mr. Tarantino has a certain degree of reverence for Asian cinema, and an affinity for all things Samurai. The fight scenes are a marvel; both horrific and beautiful at the same time.<br />The cinematography was exciting and inventive, and the acting sufficiently overdone - which meant that it was just right for the type of movie &quot;Kill Bill&quot; is trying to be.<br />I suppose what it all boils down to is this: Kill Bill Vol 1 is a movie I will watch again, and again, and again.
B000148KK2|4.0|I'm a jazz fan.  I like Evans, Jarrett, Mehldau, Van Halen, and especially Petrucci.  I also like long legs and girls hiding from Bessie in the other room.  Hence, this album was a natural for the Hopperoo.  I bought this Krall cd on a lark (curly blonde, long, stringy, hair, and a piano make a good impulse buy) and wasn't disappointed.  The songs are moody and this is real jazz, not jazzpop (Norah Lips for example).  I think the influence of Elvis MacManus most helpful here.  Oh, and the long, curly hair.  Delightful!
B00005JMFI|4.0|A great cast makes what could be at best an average holiday film into a modern classic. Ed Asner (Santa,) Bob Newhart (Papa Elf,) Zooey Deschanel (Jovie,) Mary Steenburgen (Emily,) and James Cann (Walter) form an amazing supporting cast, while Will Ferrell's energy comes bursting off the screen.<br />Ferrell plays Buddy, a human who, one Christmas eve, thirty years ago, crawled out of his crib at the orphanage and into Santa's sack. Somehow Santa missed seeing Buddy in his sack until he got back to his workshop in the North Pole.<br />Papa Elf adopts Buddy, and raises him as his own. Thirty years pass, and it becomes painfully obvious that Buddy is not the elf everyone has been pretending he is. Papa Elf explains to Buddy that he is actually human, and that his father, played by James \\"Sonny Coreleone\\" Cann, lives in Manhattan.<br />The rest of the movie deals with Buddy finding his dad, falling in love, and of course, saving Christmas.<br />\\"Elf\\" is an absolutely charming film, and one for the whole family to enjoy
B000267JQK|5.0|I love the remixes of the original songs, especially Sympathetic and Your Bore. I always liked the soundtrack songs anywayz so now I have them on one tidy disc. I am getting tired of this Broken battle going back and forth. I love both versions but listen to one you like and leave the other one alone. And the new songs are a nice hold over until next year when their sophmore album comes out and kicks. Gotta be patient for something that we all know if going to be awesome!
B0001BKAEY|3.0|The Matrix Revolutions is a great movie, not at all the travesty the critics have been telling us it is. Granted it's not Citizen Kane, but it's a lot better than Titanic! In fact, I'd go so far as to say that it's the best final chapter of a popular film trilogy since Indiana Jones &amp; The Last Crusade.<br />The film picks up immediately where Reloaded left off; Keanu Reeves' Neo finding himself caught between the Matrix and the real world. The only way out is to get the permission of the Merovingian, who after the events of Reloaded, has put a bounty out on Neo and friends, and is therefore not in any rush to let Neo go.<br />Trinity (Carrie Anne Moss) and Morpheus (Lawrence Fishburne)discover Neo's prediciment, and take matters into their own hands. They first visit the Oracle, now played by veteran actress Mary Alice, filling in admirably for the recently deceased Gloria Foster. The Oracle confirms their fears, and offers Seraph (Collin Chou) in assistance in freeing Neo.<br />Meanwhile, Zion is in seige mode as the machines dig closer and closer to breaching the walls of the city.<br />Adding to the mayhem is Agent Smith, who is gaining power exponentially, and is determined to destroy the Matrix.<br />It's up to our heroes to save the day, and to do so, they must split up. Trinity accompanies Neo to the machine city, 01, in an attempt to barter a peace, while Morpheus, Niobe and the rest rush back to Zion to assist with its' defense.<br />Niobe and Morpheus's flight back to Zion reminded me of the flight of the Millenium Falcon through the incomplete Death Star in Return of the Jedi. It's a nice touch, and completely appropriate here.<br />I won't tell anymore, as I don't want to play the part of spoiler. My intent is to set the scene, not give away the movie.<br />Suffice it to say, there is a final showdown between Neo and Agent Smith in the Matrix, as well as a huge battle for Zion, both are breathtaking - awesome in scope and scale.<br />A thoroughly satisifing conclusion to a great sci-fi trilogy. While it may disappoint those who had pinned some impossibly high expectations, I believe that it is exactly what the Wachowski brothers were trying to accomplish, a not-your-average-action movie trilogy. In doing so, the brothers have succeeded in changing the face of action films forever.isifing conclusion to a great sci-fi trilogy.

B00005JMUA|4.0|The second and final chapter of Quentin Tarantino's revenge epic, \\"Kill Bill: Volume 2\\" is not the tour-de-force that \\"Kill Bill: Volume 1\\" is. It is instead the re-affirmation that Tarantino is one of the best directors we have today.<br />Where \\"Volume 1\\" is a non-stop, leave-you-breathless pursuit of vengence, \\"Volume 2\\" is more pensive. In \\"Volume 2,\\" we learn more about the relationship between The Bride (Uma Thurman) and Bill (David Carridine.) On display is more of the wondeful Tarantino dialogue, first made famous in \\"Pulp Fiction.\\"<br />Uma Thurman's commanding screen presence from \\"Volume 1\\" is continued in \\"Volume 2.\\" These movies are her's, and she is fantastic.<br />We get to see much more of Bill this time around, and David Carridine brings just the right touches to the character. Bill is a man who knows full well the horrors he has inflicted on the Bride, and Carridine effuses his portrayal with the right amounts of pain, forlorn, venom and self-rightousness.<br />Daryl Hannah reprises her role as Elle Driver from \\"Volume 1.\\" Elle is so sublimely evil a character, you can see the joy it was for Hannah to play.<br />The Bride and Elle have an incredible fight in cramped quarters, and the reveals that take place during the encounter are both shocking and completely satisfying.<br />As Kung Fu master Pai Mei, Gordon Liu is another actor who is clearly having fun with his role. Costumed with giant, fluffy white eyebrows, and an extremely long beard, Liu uses both for comic effect with terrific results. Pai Mei is not your typical martial arts master, full of solemnity. Rather, he is quick tempered, as both the audience and the Bride discover quite quickly.<br />\\"Kill Bill: Volume 2\\" does stand on it's own as a film, but when combined with it's predecessor, it will stand as a monument to film making, paying homage to all of it's influences, from Japanese \\"grindhouse\\" films of the 70s, to the westerns of John Ford. Tarantino is the ultimate film student who never went to film school, and now he's showing us just how much he's learned.ho never went to film school, and now he's showing us just how much he's learned.
B0001ZX0OW|3.0|One of the most critically received films of 2003, MYSTIC RIVER came across to me like a fairly diverting murder mystery dressed up as a \\"prestige\\" film, the latter fact more thanks in large part to the pedigree of the cast and the film's director than the assumption that it's a great movie(it,in fact,is not).  The central plot revolves around the murder of Sean Penn's daughter in the film, which ultimately reunites him with two childhood friends, played as adults by Tim Robbins and Kevin Bacon. There are flaws throughout the film, not the least being that it's very slow going throughout.  The other major misstep for me was the use of Laura Linney's character, seen very little thoughout the movie, but then brought on at the end like something out of a Greek tragedy to convince Penn that he should take his rightful place as a \\"king\\"--I'm sorry, what?  I'm going to make a very big assumption that there is more to the Linney character in the book(which I have not read) and leave it at that.  Still, the acting is fairly seamless across the board--Penn is excellent, though frankly was better in 21 GRAMS, but fellow Oscar winner Robbins' performance didn't move me whatsoever.  The two best performances for me were from Marcia Gay Harden(as Robbins' conflicted wife) and Bacon(who makes understatement a perfected art here).  In the end, I found the whole film highly overrated, and find it still even harder to believe that many would take this over the previously mentioned 21 GRAMS or the magnificently devastating HOUSE OF SAND AND FOG.
B00001SIES|5.0|this is like the best cd ever made and i listen to it all the time.  First I dont know hoe people can compare them to Radiohead because they are totally different-Radiohead is whiny and Muse rox.  By the way Joseph Josephes (the guy who wrote the Amazon review) u make me mad- I mena what do you mean by Muse not having the &quot;crackling aura &quot; of Radiohead and Nirvana I mean come on. Muse is way better and they just arent nearly as popular because not many people in the US even know of them.  If they did some more tours in the US and their cds were easier to find thye could be just as if not more succesful than radiohead.  so there. :p
0060090367|5.0|I am not a person to see a movie or read a book more than once.  I love this book.  LOVE IT.  Will read it at least three times, and for me, that's pretty drastic.
B00008J4P5|4.0|\\"Seven Nation Army\\" describes the sound of this critics' darling as well as its first song. How can two people, with no technology to help them, make a sound this big, this good? The album plays to strength after strength. Jack White sounds like Robert Plant on the Zeppelin-esque songs and like some classic crooner on the pitch-perfect \\"I Want to Be the Boy To Warm Your Mother's Heart.\\" There are a few lulls among the fourteen tracks, but the album starts and finishes strongly enough to find its way back into the player over and over, a feat few 2003 releases achieved.
B0001ZX0OW|3.0|\\"Mystic River\\" is based upon Dennis Lehane's fine novel of the same name.  Eastwood does a good job with what it is basically a faithful retelling of the book.  Unfortunately, probably out of necessity, the novel's depths are often given a shorthand treatment that relies a great deal on its actors.  And for the most part this works.  Penn as Jimmy is terrific.  Anguished and angry, his intensity simply jumps off the screen.  He deserved the Oscar.  But just as good is Tim Robbins, as the damaged Davey.  To some extent his role is the more difficult one.  Sexually abused as a child, a middle aged failure who has nevertheless succeeded at being a good father and husband despite the psychological black hole he carries around with him.  Bacon, less so as Sean.  But his character in the novel is similarly hard to grasp, probably because he is not so locked into fate.  To some extent he has escaped, but he has his own problems even if he has moved on to a better life (if being a detective so qualifies).  On film this plays strangely, and Sean's estranged relationship with his wife, explained in the book, can only draw a \\"What?\\" from the viewer who has not read the novel.  All the supporting cast give superb efforts, contributing to the movie's long bass note of sadness and tragedy.  Still, this is a three star effort, mainly because the stakes are higher.  Lehane's novel is essentially Greek Tragedy with a Boston setting.  Perhaps Eastwood's chief error is not spending an extra ten minutes or so developing the three \\"friends\\" personalities when they were children.  Lehane provides considerable layering at the start of his novel, showing the tensions that exist between the boys (and their families), and how these tensions are fueled by the economic and social status each is born in to.  In many ways, the neighborhood, as Lehane portrays it,  is an oppressive hell hard to escape. Like the sins of our fathers, it is a millstone that is inherited.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|What a film. I think this was the first time I've cared about the characters in a movie, and felt empathy with them, in a while. Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson give amazing performances. And the feel of the film drags you into the characters and their experience of Japan--you're just as lost as they are. In a word, this is a wry film. And that's a good thing.
B000268QB2|2.0|Don't miss &quot;Everybody's Changing&quot;, &quot;Somewhere only we know&quot; and &quot;this is the last time&quot;. The rest is pretty forgetable. All the midtempo tracks (almost the entire album) follow the same pattern, with a chorus made solely to use the frontman's really good voice. It is highly improbable you'll feel the songs actually illustrate the message of the lyrics; and that's a major let down: an emotional record with absence of soul?!?!<br />The slow numbers aren't convincing either. <br />Maybe someone could say: &quot;You should rate this cd as to what KEANE wants to be, not as what YOU want them to be. They write nice, melodic pop songs and that's it&quot;. <br />Although this focus would surely make me appreciate them a little bit more, it is imperative to say that, even from this perspective, the cd gets boring and repetitive. Only 12 tracks and 45 minutes later I really didn't want to listen to the album as a whole again (rather skip some tracks and listen to a few gems).<br />The comparisons to Radiohead are laughable, the comparisons to Coldplay or Travis are not COMPLETELY out of place, but they still don't hit the mark. There is certainly potential here, but this is no debut to go crazy for. <br />(For someone looking for a good 2004 debut album I reccomend The Secret Machines &quot;Now here is Nowhere&quot;).
B0002858YS|5.0|I know these guys are gonna burst into the spotlight pretty soon, so I thought I'd take a quick chance to review it. It's an awesome debut, with plenty of influences to be noticed. Some critics will slam it for sounding \\"too much like the strokes\\" But hold on there big guy The Killers got some serius style. Songs with hooks that will stick in your head until it hits your pillow. Just listen to \\"Somebody Told Me\\" the chorus is sing-along perfection. So back to the album as a whole it does have its faults, its not as strong as it could have if they kept the pace going with the first 4 songs, they could have an album that would be a testament to its genre. All in all its a great debut album that is sure to hit the mainstream radio waves soon if not already.
B000002KCF|5.0|I first  heard this album at the restaurant where I work. The owner was playing the CD over our PA system. I was impressed but apprehensive to say that I liked it. To me it sounded like a young guy doing a 70's retro album today because the way this album is recorded sounds so fresh. When I learned the background of this album, I let myself fall in love with it. It's an amazing album with amazing lyrics and even better music. It's a great listen from start to finish and should be in every album collection.
B00005UKKF|1.0|well, i really dont like brittany. she has an aaawwwwful computerized voice, and dances dirrty. she sings about baaaad things. there r so many better things to buy than this peice of junk. her songs r wierd and so is her dancing! i think u should go buy somethin else. some good cd's like stacie orrico, racheal lampa, jessica simpson -sweet kisses-, and jump5.
B00005JMEW|1.0|I just saw the 4 star rating and renting this DVD. The only thing that's good about this movie is music. I felt the movie is tooooo voilent and worthless and is made by the director just to look different! Everything looks too artificial and you get a feel director concentrated more on trying to be different rather than trying to make a good movie. <br />Fountains of Blood would be a more appropriate name for this movie!
B00000DQSV|1.0|please dont make the horrible mistake of buying this cheesy overrated synth new wave pop music cd which should be left alone in the eighties.nobody listens to these has beens anymore and the reason they continued making albums was because they were in it for the money.i heard some terrible news that these awful guys are reforming again to make an album.good heavens they should be strapped up and not allowed to make music again.avoid this aural disaster.not recommended.get relics from pink floyd instead.
6305205620|5.0|Thank you all for reviewing this DVD. I really appreciate the love the fans have givin us over the years. Hopefully we will have another DVD out soon. Once again I thank you all. To end this in a good note, I have this 5 stars. Yea!

1592400876|5.0|Tis a rare thing for someone to be able to educated us AND make us laugh at the same time--my favorite type of education, by the way.  Hence my glee at finding this stellar little book that does just exactly that. When I first saw this book advertised, I thought, &quot;Groan. Here's another academic and boring book on punctuation or the lack thereof.&quot; I ran screaming from the room each time an advertisement popped up or someone recommended the thing. And what's this title about? Some guy that eats something, shoots a basketball, and leaves? I was totally in the dark. Then I took the time to read the description---this after seeing the incredible ranking that the good people of Amazon have bestowed upon this literary creation---and my eyes were opened. This is one funny book! Not at all what I expected. And in the process, you actually learn something. Hopefully this will help those of us out there who are punctuation deficient, and be funny to those who aren't. Would also recommend to really great reads (and from what I could tell, both of these were punctuation savvy and up to snuff)---one is a book titled &quot;The Birth of Venus&quot; and the other is one called &quot;The Bark of the Dogwood.&quot; Both seem to have all their &quot;i's&quot; crossed and &quot;t's&quot; dotted . . . or, whatever . . . Listen, I'm still working on it.  Okay?
B00000DC10|4.0|This records was on my wishlist for about 2 years...finally I got it. It is exactly what I expected from it; intrepid musical rage that gets you to the point of just send it all to hell. The world is wrong, mega commercial music sucks and there´s nothing we can do about it but scream. This is the message I got from the album when listening to Protest Song '68 and New noise. It is simply great fast harcore music that very few can dig. <br />Must listen at your car while driving very, very fast...the sensation is awesome.

B00005JMCN|5.0|Gary Ross' SEABISCUIT is more than just a tale of a horse.  The movie is the story of three men who have lost much and gain much more through this determined horse.<br />Tobey Maguire, excellent as Red Pollard, has lost his family, eyesight in one eye, and eventually he is nearly crippled in a tragic accident.  His indomitable spirit, however, is recaptured by riding and loving Seabiscuit.<br />Jeff Bridges, outstanding as Howard, lost his son to a tragic auto accident, eventually his wife, and a lot of money during the great crash.  He marries a lovely girl (played quite well by Elizabeth Banks) and through Red and Seabiscuit, he too regains a life.<br />The excellent Chris Cooper is a cowboy who has lost his land....we see him touching a barbwired fence which imprisons what was once a cowboy's land.  His gentleness and his knowledge of horses catapults him into the spotlight, and he too regains his dignity.<br />The whole cast and the expert direction of Gary Ross gives SEABISCUIT a dramatic and entertaining lift; William H. Macy as Ticktock, the radio deejay, is fabulous and adds a lot of humor to his role.
B000062YAZ|5.0|As everyone else has said, Reign In Blood is an essential thrash Masterpiece. What can I possibly say about Reign in Blood that hasn't already been said? Clocking in at 34.7 minutes (including the 2 bonus tracks) we are treated to solo after solo and drum solo. For most people this will always be Slayer's greatest album and most people also feel that after Dave Lombardo left that Slayer has never been the same. Well Dave Lombardo has returned and Slayer is once again back to the original classic lineup. Back to the Album. For most people the classic songs Angel of Death and Raining Blood would be their favorites. This is true for me as well. But I really feel that the whole album is simply brutal. It's like a beast that won't let go. Like Angels are being executed right in front of you :). The only Songs that I don't care much for but are still good are Epidemic and Postmortem. The Remix of Criminally Insane actually outdoes the original. But it's not a real remix in the sense of a remix, more of a redone version. Aggressive Perfector is another remix of the version found on the Haunting the Chapel EP and once again, it outdoes the original. The only problem I have with this version of Reign in Blood is that they slapped a Parental Advisory in the lower left corner and this ruins the artwork. If they wanted one on it, they should have just used a sticker. Alter of Sacrifice is another of my favorite songs, but it bleeds into Jesus Saves so well, that if I drift off, I don't notice the change until about a minute into the song. All in all Reign in Blood is an Album that no Metal fan should be without.       Additional Info and # of guitar solos/leads.       Angel of Death-10/10 CLASSIC!!! 5 Guitar Solos   Piece by Piece- 10/10 Fast and brutal, no guitar solos but still packs a punch.    Necrophobic- 8/10 one guitar solo, 1 Minute and 40 seconds. Wow.    Alter of Sacrifice- 10/10 &quot;Enter to the Realm of Satan!&quot; 4 Solos   Jesus Saves- 8/10 great song. 3 SolosCriminally Insane- 10/10 Love this Song, 1 guitar solo   Reborn- 9/10 Merciless. 2 Solos   Epidemic- 7/10 before the Aids outbreak, a prophecy? 2 Solos.    Postmortem- 7/10 No Solos but it still holds your attention.    Raining Blood- 10/10 Hell finally overpowers heaven. At the end there is noise, no solos.    Aggressive Perfector- 9/10 better than the original. 6 solos.    Criminally Insane (Remix)- 10/10 This version sounds like an alternate version of raining blood what with the beginning effect and all. 3 Solos.
B00005B36H|5.0|Where I'm at, Tool receive very little, if any, airplay. Their albums are hardly advertised when released. Yet they sell millions upon millions of CD's, let alone the amount of times that S.O.B's illegally download their music.<br />I have listened to thousands of CD's in my time and I have not often come across an album that I can listen to over and over and over again, all day, every day, like this album (except maybe Aenima, Tool's previous release). The music they produce is enchanting. Each song, having an average of approximately 8 minutes, takes you on a long and engrossing journey that fulfills you with ultimate satisfaction. <br />I think it's the diversity of each song that is so captivating. They create an entirely different brand of music as there is no standard verse/chorus/verse/chorus layout of each song. Each song just follows a mysterious path and F#*k me do they do it well.<br />Trying to describe their music is a very challenging task. They are, of course, metal, but unlike most metal bands, their music is harmonious and soothing, while also being mighty heavy and intense. Tool combine all the finest elements available in metal music to create a dynamic sound that will leave you feeling inspired.<br />Buy this album. If there is one thing in life where you are guaranteed to have no regrets, it is undoubtedly the purchase of this album. Unless of course you dont like rock/metal/alternative/grunge type music, in which case I suggest you give it a shot anyway because it will provide you with a serious wake-up call.<br />I have requested that my family bury my body with this album, along with Aenima, when my time has come. I am going to take it to heaven with me because that's where this music belongs.

B000002JNN|5.0|After the magnificent peak of &quot;Back In Black&quot;, it seemed that AC/DC had spent their muse. Their creative slump through the 80s came to an end, though, as they delivered this superb gem in September 1990.      &quot;The Razors Edge&quot; was a sizable hit, although not as big as it deserved, and it is filled with the kind of memorable, catchy and unapologetically silly rock n' roll that made &quot;Black In Black&quot; such a tremendous album.      From the menacing title song through the melodious (and surprisingly big) hit singles &quot;Thunderstruck&quot;, &quot;Are You Ready&quot; and &quot;Moneytalks&quot;, to the silly &quot;Mistress For Christmas&quot;, this record doesn't have a single weak track. Even the lesser-known album tracks, such as &quot;Shot Of Love&quot;, &quot;If You Dare&quot; and &quot;Let's Make It&quot; are more than worth a listen, and rarely has any rock band put together such a great collection of songs...tune for tune, riff for riff, this is better than most hard rock bands' greatest hits-collections.      The title, by the way, is a quote from a 1988 interview with Keith Richards.   Nice.
B000009CEM|5.0|I never liked &quot;extreme&quot; metal enough to buy a CD. Most of the time, i like subtility. The thing with most modern metal bands is that the shock value is there, but past that you have little to listen to; great for headbanging, yet then the novelity fades quickly. Music gets repetitive, and repetitive gets boring.<br />  My, was i in for a surprise with this band. &quot;Digimortal&quot;, an album most people overlook as commercial had the songs and the production values, &quot;Demanufacture&quot; had the raw power. This one has it all. The songs are great, for starters, and range from death-metal, to industrial to &quot;a-la-Pink Floyd&quot; harmony parts (try &quot;Resurrection&quot; or &quot;Timeless&quot; for a taste of that). The production is very very good, the story is well carried and even the booklet is one of the best i've come arround in a while. Excellent.<br /> If this is not your kind of music, but have and open mind, it's well worth a shot. I can't think of a much better start into modern metal. If you like headbanging, you owe it to yourself.
B000089RVX|5.0|I bought this CD after hearing the song &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot; as WWE No Way Out 2003's theme song, and the album was advertised, so I bought it, and WOW! I loved this song. A lot of people whine because all of its songs are not &quot;hard&quot; enough. But I enjoy a few mellow songs too. Amy Lee has a great voice and amazing talent. Also, to the person that said that their lyrics don't match their &quot;psuedo-goth&quot; look, how so?<br />Going Under-I love this song a lot. It is a good first song. Little did I know that the rest of the CD had plenty of great songs.<BR>Bring Me To Life-I don't listen to the radio a lot, so I love this song, as I don't wear it out like they do. It's a great song complete with rapping from Paul McCoy of the awesome band 12 Stones. Great vocals and a cool tune.<BR>Everybody's Fool-My least favorite on the CD. I just didn't really like how it sounded. It's still a pretty good song, though.<BR>My Immortal-My second favorite song on this CD. The vocals are absolutely amazing. And on the Radio version, it has a little guitar riff at the end for the last chorus. It is just an amazing song, and the lyrics are quite touching as well.<BR>Haunted-Next to least favorite song. But it is still a really good song. It just isn't one of my favorites.<BR>Tourniquet-A really awesome song with good lyrics.<BR>Imaginary-Another really great song with Amy Lee's awesome vocals.<BR>Taking Over Me-Really good.<BR>Hello-My third favorite. I love this song a lot, because it is just her voice for the most part with a little music. Her voice is just so good.<BR>My Last Breath-A great song.<BR>Whisper-My favorite song on the entire CD. A good song, nice lyrics, an operatic singer in the background, and chanting at the end make it a great way for the CD to end.<br />Hey, don't take my word for it! Just go buy it!
B000002LTU|1.0|this is a fairly bad record.  <br />miles was supercool back in the 70s and he knew that Sly Stone and Hendrix rocked.  he was hip to the groove.  he had his ear to the street.  or something.  anyway by the start of the 90s he clearly didn't have any ears anywhere and wasn't hip to anything.   ok, he might have heard Big Daddy Kane and hired Easy Moe Bee based off of that.  fair enough.  doesn't excuse the fact that the end product here was very subpar and about five years out of date (i know that perhaps it would have stayed in the vaults if Miles hadn't tragically died, but nevertheless).  <br />the beats laid down by Easy Moe Bee are completely unmemorable.  surely if you were working with miles davis you'd step up your game a bit.  but no.  next to the stuff people like Ultramagnetic MCs and A Tribe Called Quest and EPMD were doing at the time, these &quot;bangin' beats&quot; look incredibly stale and unimaginative and don't really &quot;bang&quot; at all actually, now I come to think of it.  <br />his lumbering, sub-hammer rapping is atrocious.  i don't think he ever did it again.  as mentioned earlier, he would still have looked wack 5 years previously.  and just like the beats, this looks really bad compared to the giant steps in rap lyricism made by people like Rakim, Q-Tip, Big Daddy Kane, Slick Rick etc.  Miles certainly did not have his ear to the street.  Or his finger on the pulse.  Or whatever.  <br />As for Miles himself, well he just sort of solos over everything, man.  He seems to be more &quot;on&quot; than on Amandla but doesn't really seem at all comfortable with the idea of a loop, and the fact that he doesn't have a band to support him in the directions he takes his solos in particular.  He seems to miss the point that hip hop is mostly rhythmic, not melodic.  Perhaps an idea might have been to emulate the phrasing and rhythms of rappers or turntablists, as many notable hip hop-fusing horn players have done since.  <br />not recommended.
0060589272|2.0|\\"Eleven minutes\\" for people who read \\"The Alchemist, is almost the same thing except Maria (the prostitute) is not Santiago (the shepherd) from \\"The Alchemist\\".<BR>For \\"healthy\\" adults who like underaged girls - this book is perfect. Coelho, writes about a 11 years old girl's sex life as if he were a girl himself! Then when this Maria is only 15, she discovers what Masturbation means and the way she does it and the way she feels when she masturbates, is vivibly described by Coelho - the writer I admired a lot. <BR>It's not a child pornography novel - that's what I like to think about it - but it surely must be when the sex life of an 11 and 15 yrs old girl is so vividly described. <br />I definitely quit reading \\"Eleven minutes\\" for the reasons above and I was so grateful I have borrowed this book from the library and not spend my hard-earned money in a rude novel like this.
B000003TAR|5.0|Okay theres this thing thats been bugging me about the album jacket so I must get it out.Okay here goes, it actually tells you how to listen to it.What the hell is that about?The thing that bugs me is that good treble and bass settings depend on the type of speakers you have.For me I got to turn the treble and bass both up to 10 or else it sounds thin and some stereos you should keep the bass and treble only at 5 depending on the type of speakers you have.Anyway this is a great album.Loved every second of it especially Heart Shaped Box,Rape Me and Radio Friendly Unit Shifter.
0393317552|4.0|The book itself is presented as a broad overview of history, as it would be impossible to paint an accurate portrayal of civilization in a book this size. I'm not well enough versed in history, or biology to make an authoritative judgement as to the validity of the material presented.  However if you are looking for something to make you think about the rise of western civilization, this may be it.  I read this a couple of years ago now and find that the ideas presented in the book still influence my thoughts.  Definitely a worthwhile read.  I'm only rating it 4 stars because I feel that some of the arguments aren't sufficiently fleshed out.
0618526412|1.0|I wish I would have read these reviews before I picked up the book at the local booksellers. I kept waiting for something good to happen, but alas... it never got to the level I expected. :(

B000002GZ1|5.0|Although the real roots lie with the black artists who inspired these guys, the PBBB is where the hippy generation,(this is a couple years pre-San Francisco, and before the Stones and Beatles began stretching their arrangements out on record),learned to JUST PLAY. Their next record was more representative of what they were actually doing live at time time, and is the single greatest influence on what became the San Francisco sound of the late 60's and early 70's, (REALLY long and experimental jamming), so this is in fact the &quot;roots of the roots of the roots&quot; of todays jam bands and guitar-heavy blues bands, mixed-race bands, and, for all practical purposes, the white-blues-man in todays' world.
B000002HPV|5.0|Few artists manage to constantly expand and experiment with each new release, particularly in the pop genre (although labelling this record as such is pretty meaningless), so to hear Bjork radically change her sound and outlook again with 'Homogenic' is nothing short of stunning. There was always a central dichotomy to her music: the Icelandic pixy with a huge voice certainly could entice us with her fairytale songs and quirky lyrics, but since 'Post', possibly even 'Debut', there was always a dark underbelly to her music that threatened her confusing demeanour, adding tension and life to a pair of remarkable albums. Where 'Debut' was a dance pop experiment with obvious reams of talent, and 'Post' was an eclectic, to say the least, collection of songs that tested each edge of her music, 'Homogenic' sees Bjork strip away the tasteful wacky woman of pop inage and craft an incredible record that deals with a darker side to her psyche in a gritty, unrelenting way.<br />  Perhaps it was a failed relationship, or the stress of a very public life that catalysed this shift, but whatever the cause, 'Homogenic' is a very personal, dark album. Opener 'Hunter' is a good indication of the albums sound, with chilly strings and carefully looped beats never intruding on Bjorks powerful, emotionally charged vocals. Songs like 'Bachelorette' and '5 years' run more as extended mood pieces than short pop songs, with dense orchestration and memorable lyrics. The albums final track, 'All is full of Love', is particularly uplifting, and serves as a gorgeous, sweeping, evocative way to close the album on a note of hope and redemption that reminds us that for Bjork, the making of the album has been cathartic and more than a futile exercise in self pity. Bjork offers a route to happiness and contentment through her music which , I feel, it is hard not to admire.<br />  Very nearly a masterwork, the album suffers only from 'Alarm call' sounding out of place and, I suppose, being too short. Overall though this is cerytainly the most unique of her albums, and that makes it a rewarding, emotionally engaging, singualr experience. I dont think that I could ask for anything more, or want to.<br />[Note: also get a hold of her 2001 release 'Vespertine' which, yes, further updates and expands her sound. I think it'll be kind of hard to review though so I wont try, you'll just have to trust me....]rall though this is cerytainly the most unique of her albums, and that makes it a rewarding, emotionally engaging, singualr experience.

B00004BZ0N|5.0|London calling is the best Clash, its an awsome album that should be bought. Every song on here is one of a kind. The clash are classic.
B00005JKC3|4.0|Few superhero films are done seriously, Unbreakable was, parts <BR>(the better parts) of the first X Men film was. But mostly we are served up garbage like Spiderman and Daredevil (shudders). The Hulk of course is a full blown classic comic book hero, done very seriously in a real world setting (like they tried to do with X Men with mixed results). It really works here too. Of cuorse its quite a slow movie but I dont have A.D.D so I can sit through and enjoy the beautiful cinematography as the story slowly unfolds. Needless to say there is a huge payoff at the end with the most amazing CG character I have seen since the first Jurassic Park (and I hate CGI usually) battling it out with the United States Army. I was however a little dissapointed with Eric Bana who has been great in some other movies, but I felt he was a little wooden in this film. Also the final confrontation between Bana and Nolte turned intoa SFX nightmare. The rest of the films look, music and atmosphere were amazing.
B00005JMX6|5.0|I'm not sure why it suffered from critics because this was a great movie.  It was funny and made a good point.
1577311523|5.0|The Power of NOW is a deeply profound book, one the few that has greatly impacted my life. Eckhart Tolle brings us the depth of wisdom from his own spiritual awakening, and serves to provide us all with the tools to move beyond pain and suffering, into personal freedom. <BR>I HIGHLY recommend this book as one of the few out there that will genuinely help you to transform your life. This book clearly helped me do just that. It is an astonishing read, and will surely bring you much in the way of enlightenment and understanding.
0316286850|5.0|I absolutely adore this book. I have his other book, Face Forward and I love them. This man knows how to do the best makeup in the biz! I even copied a look in this book on a friend. In this book, there are before and after pictures of everyday people that really show how you can make a huge difference, with just some strategically placed cosmetics. This book is also good for anyone who would perform on a stage. Check it out, you won't regret it.
B000005HLV|4.0|Shows how much you know. Burzum is just as well known as Mayhem, after the murder. If Varg didn't get jelouse and murder euronymous then attention wouldnt have come to the scene, and the world(as you stated) wouldn't know of either of these bands. Maybe people like you who obviously have no idea what you're speaking about wouldn't know either.  <br />Varg technically isn't on this CD - Hellhammer re-did the tracks. Whether Euronymous deserved to die or not is beside the point.  This is a great CD.
B0002858YS|5.0|I saw this band at KROQs weenie Roast. They sound Great live.  I picked up the album and can't stop listening to it. Trust me this band has more than just one good song
B00005UW7G|5.0|There are countless recordings and videos of Mozart's masterpiece but this one surpasses each and every one of them! First of all there is the PERFECT cast: Ruggero Raimondi spoiled me for all other Don Giovannis, including Brownlee, Siepi, Hampson, Allen etc. etc. His seductive bass-baritone not only can sound as smooth as silk (E.G. in the sexy \\"La ci darem la mano\\") but also sound furious, excited, noble and incredibly HOT. No wonder Elvira is wax in his hands as he acts as if he were in love with her again. And being very tall and extremely good looking (Not in the boyish way but MASCULINE and SEXY) he fits the bill. At times he looks like a handsome demon. His acting is absolutely incredible, for his facial expressions alone were Oscar-worthy! Two thumbs up! Then there is Edda Moser, the best Donna Anna ever! Not a dumb, neurotic canary but a strikingly passionate and vivid woman who is obviously aroused by the Don (Hey, who wouldn't be?). She acts this conflict to perfection, her voice has the hotness of lava! Glorious, fiery coloratura and a WONDERFUL actress. Kiri te Kanawa gives her best performance as the loving Elvira who's torn between revenge and the love for her treasure. (She calls him that!) Her meltingly beautiful soprano fits Elvira to a T, her noble and heartbreaking acting are even more +++++++++++ for her. Teresa Berganza spoiled me for all those stupid lyric coloratura Zerlinas. Her lyric mezzo is seductive and beautiful, her chemistry with Raimondi is astonishing. The only weak point was the Don Ottavio who lacked a full middle. The Massetto and Commendatore were fabulous. Losey's direction is brilliant, the costumes lavish and gorgeous. Maazel conducts the score to perfection. This is the best DG ever!
B000007T1M|5.0|Some people think this band sucks and that it's not metal. I don't think that it's real metal either, but just because it's not metal doesn't mean it sucks. This is a good CD and you should buy it. Toxicity is a better album. Buy both of these while you're at it. Below are the songs in order of how they appear on the CD and how I rated them from 1- 10(10 being the highest).<br />1.)SUITE-PEE: 7/10- It has an awesome beginning. The middle's pretty good. Overall it's pretty good, sort of.<BR>2.)KNOW: 8/10- I like the way it starts. It is a cool song. It is one of my favorites on this CD(pretty much all of the songs on here are anyway).<BR>3.)SUGAR: 10/10- This song kicks ass. It is awesome. Although I really don't understand it...How does \\"sugar\\" have anything to do with the song? Other than the reason that it says it throughout the song. Who are the Kombucha mushroom people? Well anyways I am an idiot and no one really cares what I think. Now do they? This song is awesome.<br />4.)SUGGESTIONS: 8/10- I like this song a little better than Know. It sounds cool. I laughed a little when I heard the end where what's-his-face talks in a high-pitched voice. Pretty good song, overall.<BR>5.)SPIDERS: 10/10- This is my second favorite SOAD song(Chop Suey! being the first). It is sort of quiet most of the time. For some reason it reminds me of ATWA. This song is the best one on this CD, in my opinion.<BR>6.)DDEVIL: 7/10- It sounds cool. The part where it says \\"shake your spear at Shakespeare\\" and \\"stupid people do stupid things, smart people outsmart each other, then themselves\\"...Well I don't get it... Shakespeare's dead...Oh...Nevermind... The devil is not lovely at all... How do you say the name? Is it just the same as devil? Oh, who cares?<BR>7.)SOIL: 7/10- This song is pretty good. It sounds pretty cool. And don't you just realize that evil lives in the skin??? Ghaaa!!! Who knows? I thought it lived in the mind...<BR>8.)WAR?: 8/10- This is a pretty cool song. It sounds cool. Bes cool. Shut your cool. Cool??? KOOL... Who are the heathens? Oh, yeah... ME!!! It gets better when it gets to \\"We don't speak anymore of war\\"... Until it is time...Man shut my face!<BR>9.)MIND: 8/10- This song sounds cool and then gets cool, and turns cool again. It is a pretty good song. Look at each other.<BR>10.)PEEPHOLE: 9/10- This song is very good, but not as good as Sugar...Yeah...well...It sounds cool once it starts playing the cool dunka...SHAA...no sense?<BR>11.)CUBErt: 8/10- This song is cool. I like it a lot. It is actually an eight and a half of ten...but oh, well...<BR>12.)DARTS: 7/10- This song sounds sort of cool. Yeah. Screachy...<BR>13.)P.L.U.C.K.: 10/10- This song is awesome! It is the second best song on this CD, pretty much. It sounds very cool when it says Never want to see you around over and over and over...three times only... then another three or four...whatever... Good song.(Politically Lying, Unholy, Cowardly Killers)<BR>Sorry about not giving you any musical information about the songs. Oh, well...you know? Who gives a s***? BUY THIS OR DIE!!!(politically die)
B000002UDB|5.0|Recently,a poll was taken as to which 500 songs are the greatest ever,and several songs from magical mystery tour scored very high on the list.Little wonder this album,along with all the beatle albums is still regarded so highly.
B000003TA4|2.0|This album is OVERRATED.  Almost every song has the same chords, just played at a different speed or octave.  &quot;Come As You Are&quot; is by far the most overrated song ever.  The lyrics are incoherent, but I will admit they are cool.  &quot;It's okay to eat the fish/ they don't have feelings.&quot;(Something in the Way)  This album did ruin rock, inspiring Nu-Metal and all that garbage we hear on the radio and MTV today.  But, Nirvana did pave the way for the other &quot;grunge&quot;(I hate that word) bands that actually had some talent to get big, Alice in Chains, Soundgarden, Pearl Jam(Kind of).  If you have to get a Nirvana album, get Bleach.  Also, to the reviewer AFI K James, stop reviewing this album, you've reviewed it 12 times, we get it, you don't like it, once is enough.
B0000CABK8|2.0|I have always enjoyed the Star Trek movies since I was a kid, and I have now completed my collection of all the Star Trek movies.  I at first started to get them individually, I first bought the S.E. of ST VI, then I moved onto getting ST II, but Best Buy didn't have any, but did have the box set with 1-10, 1-5 being in special edition, then 6-10 being the original releases.<BR>Because I already own the sixth one in S.E. I wasn't as fazed, but it's ridiculus for them to release such a set like this, espeically when it's all the movies as they were released, just in a cardboard box.<BR>Box sets like these make me sick, the best box set that was ever created was the Nightmare on Elm Street box set, and that's cause the movies all look the same and blend in with the box itself.  This one unfortunely is not like this at all, in fact this is the third box set I've seen for the Star Trek movies: A Box set for the original cast, an incomplete collection of the new cast, and this; the complete, varied edition, box set.  Frankly there is nothing special about the box set, you get no extra DVD with special features, no identical DVD cases for the movies, NOTHING.  Your just paying for 5 of the special editions and 5 of the original DVD releases, plus the box itself.  <br />So do yourself a favor, buy them individually(it's cheaper) or wait till they release a FINAL box set that is much in the respect to the Nightmare on Elm Street box set or the Alien Quadrilogy Set.
B00014NE62|4.0|Sandwiched in between the two better-known Merchant-Ivory adaptations of E.M. Forster classics ('A Room With A View' and 'Howard's End') this wonderful film may have been lost in the popular shuffle. However, it has remained a cult classic since its release in 1987, and has merited this fine DVD adaptation, long awaited by fans of the film, and a great place to start for those who are just discovering the film.<br />It still remains an amazing feat that this beautiful, lyrical film was made on such a relatively small budget. Although critically lauded and, of course, with a large following of loyal fans, its subject matter (and the subject matter of the original book) are still cause for alarm, and lack of box office. Although things may have changed since the turn of the last century, it is clear that they haven't changed as much as it would seem.<br />While the film on the first disc remains the same as the original release, the disc of extras is worth the cost of the DVD. There are some very intriguing deleted scenes, which contain a completely different take on the basic story in the film. There are interesting interviews with director James Ivory and sceenwriter Kit Hesketh-Harvey. But, the best part of the extras are the present-day interviews with the principal actors, James Wilby, Hugh Grant, and Rupert Graves. They give a very good insight into the making of the film, and their interpretation of their characters. Of course, the inevitable explanation of \\"I am not gay but I play one in the movie\\" comes up with the three actors, it seems that Hugh Grant is the most respectful and unbothered in his answer. This may be a result of his ensuing fame, or his infamous status as a heterosexual, but it's nice to hear an actor not being defensive about playing a gay character for a change.<br />I highly recommend this DVD, even for people who already have the video, because the extras are well worth owning the DVD.
B0001UL7RY|4.0|First of all Iam not an Avril fan, but i liked her debut album, and i was looking forward this album.<BR>Before listening this new cd, i was wondering that in what way will her lyrics as well as the music change.<BR>Well, after many listening i can say, it's a good album... not the best i've ever heard, but a real good one. The melodies in most of the cases are sticking in your head at the first time, and there are some real good songs on this album.<BR>I think the best of all is the last song(#12), called &quot;Slipped away&quot;, both the lyrics and the music are great. Beside of this track, i think &quot;Fall to pieces&quot;, &quot;My happy ending&quot;, &quot;Take me away&quot; and &quot;Freak out&quot; are also awesome tracks, one of them could be the next hit...<BR>What i didn't like was some lyrics, for exaple: &quot;<BR>I am small and the world is big<BR>All around me is fast moving<BR>Surrounded by so many things...&quot; in &quot;How does it feel&quot;. I think it's not a matured lyrics - it's like a child's words<BR>Another: &quot;...I'm giving up on everything<BR>Because you messed me up<BR>Don't know how much you<BR>Screwed it up<BR>You never listened...&quot; - Giving up, messing up, screwing up... for me these expressions are not for a lyrics of a song they are too simple, nothing special, i think these are (more or less) the weak point's of the album.<BR>The music was a great job, i saw many people was working on that, i liked the most Evan's scores i think he should have more works on the next album, very talented...<BR>So after all i can say it is a 4/5, but it worths buying it...
B0000AQVCL|2.0|I got to hear some clips of a few of these songs at my local music store.  I thought I might have found what I've been looking for for a long time:  a rock band that will revive music made great by Aerosmith, AC/DC, Zeppelin, and others.  When I bought the CD, I found it to be a severe disappointment.  There is absolutely nothing special whatsoever.<br />This band and their music is neither creative, inspiring, epic, clever, or anything that I've grown to love in classic rock.  I found the lyrics to be unimaginative and frankly stupid in a lot of cases, like they were written by untalented 16 year old boys.  They simply try and pull out all the tricks that worked for older bands, like handclapping and things of that sort.  It just sounds like a joke to me.  Great songs have to go beyond the scope of verse, chorus, verse, chorus, repeat chorus forms.  They need great, burning solos that last longer than 5 beats or just exist for fillers.  Theres nothing great about this band; just a mockery of great musicians before them.<br />The only reason that I give it 2 starts instead of 0 is the potential I see.  Some of their riffs arent half bad, and the singers voice has pretty good range and ability.  The musicians can obviously play, they just need to learn what it takes to make great, individualized songs.
B00018D44U|4.0|Although Ms. Jones does not have a naturally great voice, she does have an intimate quality and superb phrasing coupled with charming emotion and personality. The songs here are well-chosen and the musicianship is first rate. The only down side to this CD is that I did not want to hear too much of her voice, which got tiresome after a short while. I am wondering if some orchestration might not be a plus for her next album... perhaps to give the songs some distinction?  I am also struck how similar Diana Kralls new album &quot;Girl in the Other Room&quot; is to the style of this album..... but the quality of song and style is far better here by any measure.
0440238609|5.0|Philip Pullman has written a number of accesible and satisfying books for pre-teens and other young people.  As a writer he is a skilled craftsman. <br />This series, however, is something else.  It is not targeted for young audiences nor, I suspect, for older ones.  Age is not determinent.  These are novels for those who are eager to think, to stretch their imagination in ways that makes the world which is present before us more real.  Pullman has written an integrated series which, when taken as a whole, is a remarkable evocation of a universe which seems wildly strange, but just beyond our sight.  <br />The series achieves a fresh conception of the deity, a conception which is wholly intriguing.  We all are creations of this god, but through a series of circumstances and incidents, our relationship with the deity, and its relationship with its creation, is dramatically changed.<br />This is a complex and richly realized story of humanity's struggle to rise above its own limitations, and the importance of each individual's struggle to achieve responsibility for her or his own life.<br />As an adventure story this series is gripping, well-paced and multi-faceted.  But it is in the higher level of meaning that Pullman has achieved a transcendent work.  <br />I highly recommend this series for those of all ages who seek intriguing, thought-provoking reading in an exciting format.

B0001ZX0OW|2.0|Based on all of the positive reviews and Oscar wins by Penn and<BR>Robbins, I was anxious to see this highly regarded film.  What a letdown!  From start to finish, it was over acted, overwrought and overlong!  Never have so many actors toiled so mightily to let the audience and/or viewers know they could act.  If you have a tendency towards depression... stay away from this movie.<BR>Special note must be paid to Sean Penn's embarassing facial grimaces throughout this motion picture!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This show is awesome. I have been watching it and wondering how they could cancel a show like this. It is great TV. But they cancelled Angel, so I understand how stupid executives can be. I love it, and would really like to give it 20 stars.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I would give this movie a negative number of stars if possible. I lived in the Tokyo area for six years.  My home videos of the city are more interesting than this.  I was willing to admit that maybe I didn't get the &quot;humor&quot; because it was commonplace to me.  Maybe what might be seen as funny to someone else was so much a part of everyday life to me that I didn't see any humor in it.  But, to say that this movie is &quot;flat out hilarious&quot; as the DVD case states is false advertising.<BR>My main complaint about the movie is the seemingly meaningless  scenes.  What is the point of all the scenes with the lead female character sitting around the hotel room in her underwear?  What is the point of the scene of her walking around Kyoto, getting on the train, and coming back to Tokyo? The scene with Bill Murray and the woman demanding he &quot;lip&quot; her hose was silly and demeaning.  I was embarrassed.  <BR>The scene with Bill Murray doing the commercial was hideous. My children did quite a bit of modeling and tv work in Japan.  I have NEVER seen a Japanese director act so rudely in front of a performer.  It was very un-Japanese.  The Japanese pride themselves on their manners.  In fact, they rarely say &quot;no&quot;.  If you ask them to do something and they cannot for some reason, they take great pains to answer in a way that is inoffensive such as, &quot;that would be difficult&quot;.  If the person who wrote this screenplay ever lived in Japan, it must have been in a different part of the country than I did.  I bought this movie hoping it would remind me of happy times in Japan.  Instead, I want my money back.  The fact that it was so popular at the Academy Awards just proves that Hollywood has no taste.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Cool new second record. A review of the 12 new songs, its just my opnion. I listen to many kinds and types of music from country to rock...less punk i hate that, thats not music man! Under my Skin is a more mature album and i lke becasue avril writes all the song of this record well as she did on Let Go. OK my review.....lol all the song are cool go and buy it....also buy Britneys In the zone
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I love this album to death and I can't stop listening to it.  You wouldn't believe how many amazing songs there are on it!  My favorites are: (I got that) boom boom, Outrageous, Showdown, Breathe on me, Everytime, Me Against the Music, The hook up, Touch of my hand, and Toxic.  This is basically the entire album, that's how great it is!!  you should pick this up immediately and forego crap by Jessica simpson or Beyonce!
B000000993|3.0|There is no doubt that Tool's debut \\"Undertow\\" is a much better musical experience than most of what is out there today.  Infact, when I heard \\"Sober\\" on the radio, it gave me hope for a dying generation of music (that was several years ago, but music was still pretty bad in the mid-late 90's).  It wasn't until a few months ago that I got Tool's first CD, already having the other three, and hearing how awesome this one was in comparison.  EVERYONE -- friends, critics, reviewers of this site, etc. said that Undertow was a God of a CD.  Now, I'm not one to worship any one band, let alone a CD, but I absolutely loved Aenima, and Lateralus was pretty good.  So, to say the very least, I was very hyped to go back in time and enjoy Tool's supposed best.  Now, I will not deny that this CD deserves at the very least, three stars.  However, after hearing \\"Undertow\\" in its entirety a full four times (not consecutively, I might add), I wanted to unleash a bottle of rage and unfairly give this disk one star.  Now that I've cooled down, I'll continue.<br />  I do wish to reiterate that I am not some ignorant reivewer that hasn't heard this and thinks it totally sucks.  Not the case with me.  However, I disagree with just about everyone on this planet with regards to this being Tool's best work.  It's a debut that is better than most, but it does not compare to Aenima for several reasons.  First, while on \\"Undertow\\" there are some variations in guitar riffs and melodic flow, it was practically a foundation in \\"Aenima\\"  Think about the title song from \\"Aenima\\".  The end was quite different from the beginning.  Think how different the uptight rage in that song was from the haunting aura in \\"H\\" and how different both were from the mellow, yet upbeat flow of \\"Forty-Six and 2\\".  Also, with \\"Hooker with a *****\\", think about how the beginning and the end accomplish rage and anger at being called a sellout (which Tool is anything but) in two different musical styles.  In \\"Undertow\\", there's hardley any of the aforementioned variety that made \\"Aenima\\" so intriguing.  Even in \\"Lateralus\\", the first song on that CD, \\"The Grudge\\", contains at least three or four different riffs, complete with Danny Carrey going nuts on drums at the end.  Now, I will say that I am still impressed with Carrey's end of \\"Undertow\\"; he is among the best drummers I've ever heard, and, as a percussionist myself, if anyone wants to refute that, then by all means, go ahead.  However, many of the song here on \\"Undertow\\" are tough to distinguish from one another.  Even though there are no fillers here......correction........what the hell is up with that last song \\"Disgustipated\\".......disgustipated indeed.......what a waste of 16 minutes (life feeds on life; this is necessary! over and over again), the similarity of many of the songs (with Sober and Undertow being standouts) to each other makes \\"Undertow\\" not nearly as satisfying as \\"Aenima\\".  <br />  Lyrically, this CD is fairly strong, but again, Aenima is a thousand times better in that department as well.  Think about the controversy that Maynard wanted to stir up in songs like \\"Eulogy\\", claiming that Jesus Christ himself was a fake, \\"Aenima\\", where he prays for the end of the world, and \\"Hooker with a *****\\", where he states his well-founded disgust with the music industry's current state, as well as his band's obvious refusal to sell-out.  Now, there is a small amount of controversy contained in \\"Undertow\\", but not enough for me to be convinced that, based on \\"Undertow\\" alone, Tool is a daring band.  I will reiterate a final time that this is still a good CD, but not as powerful or moving as Aenima.  Tool is a progressive rock band, so I'd like to think that, as they release CD's, they would progress; it only makes sense that \\"Aenima\\" and \\"Lateralus\\" be better than \\"Undertow\\".  Like I said, this is one of the most hyped-up CD's I've ever seen, so to say I had high expectations is an understatement.  However, this isn't Tool's best effort; \\"Sober\\" and \\"Undertow\\" are the only clear standouts on this CD.  Still, it is worth it to check out this mostly solid, yet slightly repetitive, disk.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|'In The Zone' is a great album when you consider its genre.  The songs are fun, pop dance songs mixed in with some techno and a bit of trance.  The production is stellar, the vocals are good, and the overall package is excellent.  I haven't found another pop album out right now that compares to it.  It's a full-length listen and great for dancing, long drives, working out, whatever.  Whatever your feelings are toward Britney, there is no denying the quality of this album!
B000002UDB|4.0|This album is one of the funnest and most enjoyable listens that you will likely ever find.  It is chocked full of fun lighthearted energy.  The Beatles did an extremely effective job of making the feel of this album fit the title perfectly.  The joyous hard rocking title track gets things off to a wonderful start.  'The fool on the hill' is an excellent ballad with a really dreamy otherwordly musical feel to go along with the very touching story.  'Flying' is a great instrumental track that sounds like a break beat.  Break beats are the foundation for what later became hip hop so The Beatles were far ahead of their time!  They show similarly amazing foresight on the sixth track too.  The next song, 'Blue jay way' just kind of slowly and redundantly plods along going absolutely nowhere and is the only real clunker on this album.  'Your mother should know' is a really well produced old English style dance song.  'I am the Walrus' is one of the best and zanyiest songs I have ever heard.  I don't know why this song works as well as it does, but it really does.  The part when John Lennon says \\"Goo goo gachoo\\" sounds like he is either scratching or beatboxing.  The end of the song sounds like someone is continuously scratching and transforming, so you could almost give The Beatles credit for incorporating elements of hip hop into their music at least ten years before the first hip hop record was even released.  'Hello Goodbye' starts off as an excellent classic Beatles sounding single but in the very end, it breaks down into a foot-stompin, hand-clappin' sing-a-long.  'Strawberry Fields Forever' has an airy feel that goes along perfectly with Lennon's clever word play and contemplative lyrics.  'Penny Lane' finds Paul taking us on a warm nastolgic trip through his childhood. 'Baby your a rich man' sounds like they should have a whole stadium full of people clappin their hands, stomping their feet, and singing along.  The ultra-anthemic 'All you need is love' is a perfectway to end an album that is filled with so much magic and adventure.  It is true that in many ways, this album sounds more like a collection of singles than a conceptually whole album, but it terms of listening pleasure, it is definitely one of the most enjoyable albums by The Beatles.  I would strongly recommend.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|this album is just overhyped and overall pretty crappy.  none of the songs stand out, they all blend together.  the vocals are pretty weak and the lyrics are laughable at times.  if you want a better album, buy &quot;Let go.&quot;
6302787297|5.0|This movie is incredible! The score by Vangelis is<BR>breathtaking. I can't believe this has not been<BR>released on dvd. One of Ridley's best!!!!
B000089RVX|5.0|Plain and simple, if you love every Metal arena, this will blow you away. A highly powerful, and highly infectious release. \\"Masterpiece\\" best describes this IMO...    I took a shot on Evanescence without ever even hearing them, and I'm totally satisfied. In fact, beyond satisfcation. At first, I wasn't sure what I was going to be hearing...     Was it going to be another Lacuna Coil??? Was it going to be another one of those horrible Nu Metal bands??? It was neither...    It was original, and totally incredible. Amy Lee has the voice of an angel, and she can make it roar too. This is ear candy all the way, and each song has some very creative hooks. A handful of real hard rockers, and a few very emotional ballads, and you've got the masterpiece that is \\"Fallen\\"...    I love Lacuna Coil, and after just one listen to Evanescence's \\"Fallen\\", I'm now torn between who I like more. One thing is for certain, Evanescence will blow you away!!!!    If you like this, and want to check out something similar but different, I highly recommend Lacuna Coil's \\"Comalies\\". I'd have to say \\"Fallen\\" and \\"Comalies\\" are the best two releases I've purchanced this year...
006092988X|5.0|I was first introduced to this book by my mother at the tender age of 10. Since then, I have read it countless times, and find myself picking it up and reading sections of it from time to time. The Nolans became like family to me, and I find myself thinking about the characters--particularly Sissy and Katie--at inopportune times. These extremely well-written characters don't just get in your head, they immerse themselves in your soul, and if you read this book once you will read it 1,000 times. Betty Smith is not the best writer of the 20th century, but she writes stories like no one else and managed to create timeless characters, both in this novel and in Joy In the Morning. No one should miss reading this book at least three or four times. Trust me, if you read it it will become one of your favorites, and the characters will work their way into your heart.<BR>Sissy is my favorite character in the novel. Her lust for life, coupled with the unusual scenarios in the book, makes her unforgettable. I love Francie, of course, and who could help but love the good-for-nothing &quot;sweet singer of sweet songs&quot; himself, Johnny Nolan? <BR>This movie desperately needs to be re-made as a major Hollywood film. The 1940s version was good in its own right, but it was not entirely faithful to the novel. Think of all the charming actors who could play Johnny. Matthew McConaughey, Christian Bale, Chris O'Donnell...the list goes on and on. <BR>Anyway, do yourself a favor and read this book!!!!
B0000DD7LC|4.0|Wow! I just saw Alicia Keys live in concert yesterday performing songs off of this album and she was amazing. She blew the crowd away. She has a mass of talent (unlike Britney Spears who lipsyncs) when it comes to singing and playing the piano. Her voice isn't fake. It really does have an amazing vocal range and power. Her performance with her dancers was also extremely cool. Overall, since the concert I am persuaded to purchase this CD, and I think you should, too. She is one of the few authentic, talented musicians today in the industry.
B0001YRVN4|3.0|If you weren't anywhere near the summer of 1977 it would be hard to really explain the excitement that the first STAR WARS film caused.  I was 14, perhaps the best age to see it, and I completely fell in love with it.  Of course, so did everyone else.<br />(By December, I was also completely sick of it and ready for the next great sci-fi film released that Christmas: CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND).<br />I still think the first is the best, no matter how much tinkering George Lucas does with the special effects.<br />THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK was good until it stopped.  It did not end.  It stopped.  I remember being infuriated walking out of the movie in 1980.  My sci-fi nerd buddies were ecstactic and I was asking, \\"How long do we have to wait now to find out what happens?\\"<br />Three years later came RETURN OF THE JEDI and I hated it.  Harrison Ford's Han Solo, the most interesting character, took a backseat to adorable little furballs.  I'll always remember watching JEDI in a theatre filled with little kids making the laser sounds and then walking out to see the toy store across the mall with piles of Ewoks and crap from the movie.  A 2-and-a-half hour toy commercial that ends with the signature \\"yearbook photo\\" shot of everyone standing together, all smiles (even the bad guys return as happy ghosts to wave from the sidelines).<br />So I was pretty disillusioned with the FIRST three films by the early 1980's.<br />(I saw THE PHANTOM MENACE in theatres.  Snooze-fest.  Caught part of ATTACK OF THE CLONES on HBO.  Like the online newspaper parody, The Onion, said, it was \\"like C-SPAN from another planet.\\"  But I'll probably see the last one when it comes out, out of loyalty for the first film that entertained me in a lifetime far, far away....)
0393057658|5.0|Billy Beane took Bill James' theory on baseball and applied it to the real world to build a winner. All of this on a low budget. What is very intersting about the book is that Beane rejects ballplayers who are &quot;can't misses&quot;: tall, well built high school kids who can run and throw( basically the same type of player that Beane was when he was drafted in the first round by the Mets). Instead he opts for the fat, dumpy non-athletic looking guys who have high on-base percentages and who walk alot ( thereby tiring the pitchers). He'd rather play someone who can hit over someone who could field, he hates bunting, he hates sacrifices, he hates the hit and run, he dislikes stealing bases and he hates it when his pitchers walk batters.However, this type of baseball is not new. Earl Weaver used to manage the Baltimore Orioles this way for years.
B000002U9P|5.0|Break Every Rule was the follow up the hugely successful Private Dancer album.  Break Every Rule peaked at #6 and sold over a million copies in America.  This also launched her first &quot;farewell&quot; tour in 1987.  The tour played to over 5 million people, and did over 250 concerts worldwide.<br />The first track, Typical Male, was the biggest hit of of the album peaking at #2 for 3 weeks.  Its a great piece of bubble gum pop, with its catchy chorus.  What You Get Is What You See was also a hit peaking at #13.  It's a pop/country tune.  Two People is a soft ballad that hit the charts at #26.  <br />One of my personal favorites is Afterglow.  Its got a great back back, &amp; the song has a good message I think.  Back Where You Started is Tina at her most rock.  Its a get back, revenge type of song that fits great with her life.  She won the Best Rock Performance Female Grammy for this underlooked classic.  The title track of the album has always been one of my favorites.  It was released as a single but fizzled at #76.<br />The album ends with a great combination of Paradise Is Here, &amp; I&quot;ll Be Thunder.  Great songs that will leave you remebering this album.  In the eighties Tina released 3 LP's.  Private Dancer, Break Every Rule, &amp; Foriegn Affiar.  Each one better than the one before, and unfortunatly, least successful.  I perosnally think everyone should have these 3 albums, as they are great, underated rock classic albums.
6305897786|4.0|The absolutely creepy yet sublime direction of this Polanski endeavour makes it a worthwhile watch. Almost Kubrick-like, wide angle shots and lax-paced screenplay and all.<br />I was riveted. Riveted, that is, right until the somewhat confusing fire and cobblestone ending, which admittedly leaves you with very little to chew on and instead of appearing clever and ambiguous, as it perhaps wanted to, mostly comes off as complacent.<br />Yet, the point of a mystery noirish film is to keep you intrigued through out, and the movie manages to do that quite successfully. The sleuthing process is almost done in tandem with the audience, which is fun. Johnny Depp is immaculate in his potrayal of a detached book detective and all others contribute richly. The music is tacky in bits, but not too distracting.<br />Recommended rental for haunting cinematography of Portugal and France, and a fabulously captivating atmosphere in general.
B000002UB3|5.0|this album is definetely the Beatles most solid effort. People complain about how 'Octopus's Garden' is a child's song, or how John Lennon wasn't participating, but that's all garbage. He wrote twice as much as George and Ringo combines. 'Come Together'(lennon), 'Something' and 'Here Comes the Sun' (harrison) and 'Octopus's Garden' (Starr) are the strongest songs on the album.<br />Paul McCartney has the most songs, but none are very memorable. His work is surprisingly unsatisfying as opposed to his efforts on the previous aand next albums : White album and Let it be. But Lennon's efforts maintain the prestige of Lennon/McCartney. George and Ringo have nothing but great songs.<br />The album is no doubt a 5 star. It's not surprising that the album is the Beatles' best-selling one.
B00003CWTI|2.0|Aimee Mann's gorgeous score and Tom Cruise's momentary brilliance are the only two feeble reasons to trudge through this self-indulgent rigmarole of a movie. Which is barely enough to make it worthwhile.<br />All the characters in the movie fumble through their tragic, unfulfilled existence and the theme couches a fairly depressing message -- that we always end up hurting the ones we really love. Whenever something unusual or magical happens, it is ineffective or downright silly (e.g., a rain of frogs -- don't ask!)<br />Worse, all this out-of-focus saga runs for a sprawling 3 hours. The music is so loud in most sequences that it drowns out the dialogue, what kind of a creative cinematic device was this if beyond me. The language is often of a streetside variety.<br />Oddly, one of the less important characters, Donnie (played by William Macy) says something interesting:  &quot;I really do have love to give...I just don't know where to put it.&quot; Which perfectly summarizes my sentiments for this farcical excuse for a film.
B000002UAU|5.0|Sgt. Pepper's has been renown as being a 'concept album'. Nobody's really sure what that means, but my guess is that it has several musical themes that coneptually blend into each other. Even if my definition is wrong, Sgt. Pepper's does do just that.<br />Sgt. Pepper's, Little Help, 'Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds', and 'a day in the life' are the best songs. Somehow, the BBC came up with drug meanings of the last three and banned them, but the songs are still great. <BR>McCartney is the main contributor, (since Lennon and Harrison were getting too high to write songs). This is quite odd since on 'a hard day's night', Lennon wrote 10 of the 13 songs. McCartney wrote 7 of the 13 songs. Sgt. Pepper's and 'Lovely Rita' are his best.<BR>Lennon is still great. He wrote 4 songs, 'a day in the life' and 'lucy in the sky' are his best. 'Mr. Kite' is vital to the feeling of the album.<BR>Harrison only contributed his Indian song: Within u without u. The lyrics are horrible, but the instruments are very interesting.<BR>'Little Help' was co-written by Lennon and McCartney and sung by Ringo.<br />This album is fantastic, but it would have been their best if they included 'Strawberry Fields' and 'Penny Lane' (they were chosen as a double-A side single). Nonetheless, brilliant album.
B000002JSN|5.0|First of all, I;'m only fourteen and im already into all of the 60's, 70's bands.  My dad gave me Phsycial Graffiti so I could hear what Jimmy Page sounded like and so I could learn so new riffs on my new guitar.  As it turns out, I learned a couple new songs (The Rover, Custerd Pie, a little of In My Time of Dying) but i also ended up discovering one my favorite bands.<BR>    This CD is one of their best, but not their best.  IV or How The West Was Won was their best (at least I think...).  <BR>    Some of the great songs on this album are The Rover (which has one of the catchiest riffs Ive ever heard), In My Time of Dying (LONG yet very great song... my second favorite song by Zep behind Stairway) and Kashmir (very melodic and very great).  I didnt think the second disc was all that great but it was still good.<BR>     Definitly buy this CD!
0385720920|1.0|Have you read any of Palahniuk's other books?<br />Great.  You don't need to read this one.  <br />If you've read more than two or three, you know already that the fundamental plot elements remain the same, and the situations the characters get into become more drastic as he struggles to wrap new plot lines around the same broad plot as Fight Club (you have to hit bottom, subvert society, say a bunch of &quot;shocking&quot; stuff, etc. etc.).<br />This is a really bad book.  If you've read one Palahniuk book, you've read them all- at least stay away from the later ones, which are just sort of pathetic.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|While might be alittle complex it is definately an amazing film. Buy this film, pay attention but let the movie flow, and flow with it while you watch it instead of trying to figure it out like most other movies. Almost approach the film as you would a play by shakespeare.<br />If you don't get it the first time watching it a second time with the commentary and subtitles will allow you to get a better feel for what the director is trying to say with the movie while not missing parts of what the actors are saying cause theres subtitles.<br />The film really makes you think about time travel, space-time, devine intervention, god, alternate dimensions, dreams, and tons of other stuff. Really a great film, and its suprising well done even though it was low budget (4 million for the entire film). Give it a try if you haven't already, and again if you have and didn't like it its definately worth a second look, the commentary is very helpful in understanding it.
B00006879E|5.0|This is one of my favorite CDs out right now, along with mr.deviant's &quot;Techno Obsession&quot; which is a slammin' hard dance CD with a rock influence. Both of these CDs are highly recommended.<BR>I bought &quot;Songs About Jane&quot; after hearing &quot;This Love&quot;. I thought it would be a one hit album because I had never heard of the band, man was I wrong! When I play this CD, I play it from start to finish. It's THAT good. Get it now, it's the ultimate summer CD!
B000089RVX|5.0|While I highly enjoyed the Evanescence cd I have found something I enjoy more. Reading the reviews for it. It appears that the newest code of conduct in the verbal How-To-Be-A-Goth handbook is to mock any bands that don't fall under your catagory of &quot;Hard Core&quot; of course that rule goes slong with ranting about shows that you really did not watch as a kid. You claim that they miss labeled the bands genre then is that hard to go find another band to listen too. The vocalist Amy Lee is talented and though some of you are able to admit it others feel the need to incoherently express your opinions like &quot;Lyke Ammy Le sux!! Gc is soz much better&quot; The songs are to a persons taste and my parting words are right now you are probably blasting Slipknot or GC across your room and in twenty years you will be doing the same thing except that you will be thinking &quot;Wow, I had no personality&quot; instead of &quot;They rocK&quot;
B000003TA4|1.0|Look how stupid and out-of-touch with reality Nirvana fans are. I'm not even a fan and I know the unlisted song is called &quot;Endless Nameless&quot;. It's no secret, either. The song was accidentally left of the final inserts due to a printing error. The song plays on the same track as Something in the Way because of a pressing error at the disc plant. But I suppose you can leave it up to a bunch of stoned f*ck-ups who love a band as corporate as Nirvana to be so off their rockers that they randomly name things &quot;Mosquito Bite&quot;. I recently heard an unlisted track of Pink Floyd's and dubbed it &quot;I am a pretentious f*ck up who likes to name things because I have no reason to find staples in my Chinese food&quot;!
B00005JMUA|3.0|When we finished volume 2 of Kill Bill it left us at a stage were we were dying to see the concluding chapter. This is pretty much what we expected for the volume 2, except... it is hardly anything like the first chapter. In the second we don't get as much martial arts, actually we hardly get any, we only get a tiny bit which takes place in a trailer. Also, Uma Thurman doesn't really do much action in this, although she plays the part well. What I liked was the beginning when it shows you a flashback of the chapel massacre. I also liked it when Uma was burried alive, it made it look quite scary. But, a lot of the dialogue in this can be quite boring and un-interesting as Quentin usually gives us good dialogue, which can educate and entertain us. The last half-an-hour of the film is set in Bill's house, and it's just a lot of talking really, with a tiny bit of flashbacks and her comeback against Bill is nothing cool. Also, when she goes to get revenge on the other two killers, she doesn't wven kill them. The woman with the eye-patch just gets stabbed in the eye and we think she's goanna get cjopped up. The other killer, Bud, doesn't even get killed by the bride, the woman with the eye-patch betrayes him. It is exciting to see the concluding chapter, but don't expect what you saw in the first part. The only scene I really enjoy is when she gets berrayed alive. Scary.
B000003TA4|1.0|There has been such great music after Nirvana that &quot;Alternative&quot; albums that everyone owns (like Nevermind) are obsolete. They just don't matter anymore. I don't see why Kurt did himself in because of his fans and the way music was headed. He ended his life for no reason. He had it so good, but now he isn't even here to defend the fact that he wasn't the Rock God everyone here says he was. Nevermind was good, but it wasn't special. You can thank Rolling Stone (corporate finks) for all this constant overpraise of Nirvana, but it's even worse that most here believe it. Here's a novel idea: Try thinking for yourselves insted of thinking what Rolling Stone tells you Kurt supposedly said to think.
B000002U9W|4.0|...of course, EVERY Pink Floyd album is experimental in its own way, this album plays around with longer compositions, the A-side (or 1st track) being a classical-type suite, Atom Heart Mother (a predecessor of the more rock-oriented suite Echoes from the album Meddle). The rest of the album is pretty standard, being mostly just a collection of regular songs. Each member has a song here (with the exception of drummer Nick Mason), most of them being pretty mellow and nothing that really sticks out. The closing track, Alan's Psychidelic Breakfast, is an interesting (but somewhat dull) medley of tunes played over random noises of a man eating his breakfast. Some of the spaces in between the music are a little too long, however.<br />This album cannot really be described as a whole... because the first track is an album within itself, and the rest of the songs are basically excess. However, these songs are not BAD. The first track is by far the best one on here, as it is meant to be so, and it is a very interesting musical journey. The rest of the songs are really just there if you want to hear a little bit more.
B000003TA4|1.0|Breed is the best Nirvana have done. And it's pathetic.

B000002G7E|4.0|I really love this CD because I am personally a fan of the distorted noisy alternative/rock/blues stuff of the VU's first 2 albums. This album is for people like myself. If you like the distorted sonic chaos from parts of the first album, you will probably like this. <br />The beauty of this album is that, although there are only 6 songs, most of them you will find have great replay value. This attribute however is spoiled by 2 tracks in particular. One is the Gift, although clever in that it is a story put to music, it is only really entertaining once, and then every once in awhile afterwards. If it would have perhaps been put on the end of the album, it would eliminate the need for skipping over it all the time. If you have a stereo that can fade left and right, however, you can fade out the words and listen only to the entertaining blues jam that takes place on your right speaker. Otherwise, its not a great song. The other spoiler is I Heard Her Call My Name, which is, to most people (including myself), a noisy out-of-tune guitar solo. Although it's easy to tell that Lou was probably influenced by many jazz artists in this solo, it really just doesnt work on guitar.<br />The good songs on this album, however, are really fantastic. White Light/White Heat is an excellent 50's-style rocker with the distortion really cranked up. The best way I can think of describing this song is somewhere between Chuck Berry and early-day Nirvana. <BR>Lady Godiva's Operation is a haunting story of a woman who dies during a sex-change operation. The guitar/viola in this song is really great, but it gets crazy once the \\"operation\\" takes place, and a slew of effects (mostly done just by vocals) come in creating the nightmarish impression of a hospital room.<BR>Here She Comes Now is the only song that is free of distortion, and its a very beautiful. Drummer Mo Tucker does a really good job of creating subtle percussion for this one.<BR>The absolute best song of this album, however, is without a doubt Sister Ray. This song is a 17 1/2 minute jam that blows me away whenever I listen to it. The song itself is about 2 or 3 chords, but it's a really nice upbeat tune. Although the lyrics are dark and include murder and some ding-dong sucking, the 15 minutes of jam time really make it uplifting. It is as if every member of the band (other than Mo, who, thank God, remains the steady backbone who holds the song together) is trying to play louder than everyone else. This song is a chaotic masterpiece.<br />All in all, White Light/White Heat more than makes up for the few stinkers it has in some really remarkable noisy masterpieces.<br />If you don't like this style of VU, I suggest the cleaner \\"Velvet Underground\\" album.
B000003TA4|1.0|Ever heard the progressive rock stylings of Buffalo Tom? Now THERE'S some music you can groove to. Nirvana wasn't even half as good. When I was first getting into music and becoming my own person, I saw My So-Called Life and heard about them. I bought their debut, and was so happy that I didn't waste it on Kurt Cobain's cries for pity backed to squealing guitars. Nirvana was a horrible live band, so I personally think they were horrible period. Their pricey studio trickery they used to cover up their imperfections on Nevermind proves how cold and calculating \\"Kurdt\\" was. \\"Artist\\" my ass. If he really wanted an honest album, he could've re-recorded the songs for the album in his basement, and then sent THAT to Geffen. After all, Kurt had total creative control over everything Geffen got, so he could've changed it if he honestly wanted to. But, of course he didn't. He was lazy, left Nevermind the glossy way it was, and then watched as Sam Goodys everywhere stocked it for way much more than it was worth. Sure, he loved cassettes and vinyl, but when he saw fans having to spend over 15 bucks per CD, he didn't give a sh*t about his fans. After all, at least it wasn't HIM having to scrounge up that money. He was a famous heroin rock star now. Want a real taste of what Nirvana was? Then go out to Sam Goody's and plunk down nearly 20 bucks for Muddy Banks, and then have a good cry. I guarantee you WILL shed tears after having wasted that much money on such a disaster of a set of live performances. <BR> <BR>Rest In Peace, Ray Charles  <br />Rest In Hell, Kurt Cobain
B000002ACR|5.0|1967 was a vintage year for pop music and this album, one of the finest Byrds albums, reinforces my belief about just how much great music was released in that year, although all the tracks were actually recorded in 1966.. It was not especially successful at the time of its release, failing to make the top twenty of the American album charts, but it has aged well and may be better appreciated now than in 1967.<br />The album is notable for the emergence of Chris Hillman as a songwriter as well as great songs written or co-written by Roger McGuinn and David Crosby. The other notable feature is that this was the last album before the group went through a period of high staff turnover. Four of the original five were together for this album, the only absentee being Gene Clark. David Crosby was to depart during the recording of the next album after this and others followed later.<br />The album opens with So you want to be a rock'n'roll star (about the Monkees, whose music has stood the test of time, confounding their critics) - this song was a top thirty hit in America. It was the only hit although another single (Have you seen her) was released, which is probably why the album was not originally very successful.<br />Bob Dylan only contributed one song (My back pages) although two versions of it are included here. The other songs were all written or co-written by members of the Byrds. Of the remaining songs, I particularly like Everybody's been burned, Renaissance fair, Time between and Lady friend, but this is a great album from start to finish.<br />If you enjoy their music enough to want more than just a hits collection, this is a good place to start  collecting their original albums.
B000003TA4|1.0|Nevermind is pretty good. Not great. There are some hum dingers of a song like Lithium and Teen Spirit that are just amazing. As for the ones I don't like: There are a lot. In Bloom was a very bad choice for a single, and Drain You always got on my nerves. Why wasn't Breed chosen as a single instead?! It's guitar crunch at its best, I tells ya. On a Plain was a single, but was only released limitedly, which is a shame because it blew In Bloom away. Anyway, there are four knock-'em-dead songs on here, but the rest are duds.
B00005NKKY|5.0|The first half of this mainly mellow album (originally one side of a vinyl album) is based around life experiences from childhood to old age. Beginning and ending with the bookends theme, the outstanding song in this half is the reflective America.  Save the life of my child, Overs and Old friends are all great songs though I'm not too keen on Voices of old people.<br />The second half of the album has no obvious theme but is stronger overall, containing Mrs Robinson (the biggest hit here), Hazy shade of winter (revived in the eighties to good effect by the Bangles), Faking it (a minor American hit), Punky's dilemma (an excellent philosophical song) and At the zoo (a great song with which to close the original album). Some say that Mrs Robinson (which originally appeared in the soundtrack of The Graduate) doesn't really blend in with the rest of the album. Maybe not, but I'm glad it's here.<br />Two bonus tracks are nothing to get excited about, but the re-mastering gives a far superior sound quality. There are also some informative liner notes.<br />If you only want the famous songs, you can find them on any number of hits compilations - some double CD's, some single CD's. However, if you wish to explore further, this album should be a high priority.

1400031354|5.0|I am so happy she finally decided to get married and chose a well known person for his integrity and kindness. She made it clear though that she accepted his proposal not because she is a woman who needs a man to protect her nor to be his servant NO she was satisfied with her life and her job and hurt from her experience with one failed marriage that was still so fresh in her memory..<br />I love the series because of Mma's character. She wants to change and wants to learn about the modern world and life in the new century but doesn't shun her past .. on the contrary she is proud of her heritage and of her country and what makes it special. Through her investigations, Smith tackles various issues, he states Mma's point of view as the opinion of the learned people and leaders of her country and shows how a foreigner would percieve it... true and simple. He uses simple language, affirms the traditions of the country, draws the difference in behavior between past and present... Africa and the west.<br />It's a funny sad book, clash of culture and modernization. Enjoy reading as Mma unfolds the mysteries of life!

B0001FR3IQ|3.0|Let's see...Halle has down a political satire (&quot;Bullworth&quot;), a biopic (&quot;Introducing Dorothy Dandridge&quot;), a ghetto comedy (B.A.P.S.), a Spike Lee film (&quot;Jungle Fever&quot;), a sci-fi adventure (&quot;The X-Men&quot; duo), a Bond film (&quot;Die Another Day&quot;) and an Oscar winner (&quot;Monster's Ball&quot;).  So, it was about time that she tackled a psychological thriller.<br />Well, at least, she can say she tried.<br />This misguided attempt into &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; and &quot;The Others&quot; territory just doesn't hold up.  There are few thrills or suspense; the dialog is stilted; and it's too short for much development.  As valiant as the actress attempts to bring something out of the limp script, the viewer keeps longing for more.<br />Her supporting cast fares none the better, with parts assayed by Penelope Cruz, Charles S. Dutton, Robert Downey, Jr., and Bernard Hill not very filling.  Only does John Carroll Lynch as the town sheriff get to flex his muscle, literally and figuratively.<br />To add further insult to injury is the commentary supplied by director Kassovitz and director of photography Labitique. The pair talks as if they have made the next, great thriller, a la Hitchcock.<br />Gentlemen, I know Hitchcock...and ya'll ain't Hitchcock.
B00005OM4N|5.0|1. I'm A Slave 4 U-The BEST song on the cd...Has an awesome beat and it's a great song to get up and dance to:10/10<br />2. Overprotected-Another great song...I was surprised it wasn't a success in the US..remix is better though:10/10<br />3. Loney-An awesome song..not as good as Slave but it has a great beat and kinda shows a wild britney:10/10<br />4. I'm Not A Girl Not Yet A Woman-Not one of my favorite songs on the cd but it's pratically the only true ballad on the cd:9/10<br />5. Boys-I think this song is kinda ok but it dosent really go with the album..the remix should've replaced the original!:9/10<br />6. Anticipating-Really cute and kinda a disco song:10/10<br />7. I Love Rock &amp; Roll-Not as good as the original...I personally don't think it has a really rockish beat:8/10<br />8. Cinderella-A great dance tune..it's kinda techno a little bit too:10/10<br />9. Let Me Be-A well done song:9/10<br />10. Bombastic Love-Kinda a futuristic techno/r&amp;b song:9.5/10<br />11. That's Where You'll take Me-Sounds like a futuristic techno/ballad song:9/10<br />12.

B00008CLOA|5.0|Hey ! I must be one of those old fogies that someone was talking about. DSOTM is my favorite album of all time. THATS RIGHT. I like a lot of new music, but just because a recording is 30 years old does not make it, how you say, &quot;CRAP&quot;. That means its timeless. Indeed my young and immature listeners, you to shall grow old as well as the music you listen to. No household is complete without at least 2 copies of &quot;DARK SIDE OF THE MOON&quot; and to all of you out there, just remember. GOD created the Heavens and Earth for a place for The Beatles and Pink Floyd to make records...........Rock on!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00000I0XW|4.0|This is a very good compilation of ALW songs. Sarah Brightman is a very good vocalist. Her voice can be shrill sometimes, but the good dominates the bad. The songs are very good choice for a CD. What ALW album would be complete without songs from &quot;Phantom&quot;? Some of the songs are featured on every tribute and compilation album, but there are some hard to find ones. ALW is a very good composer of Popular songs, but they dont seem to work well in his shows. This is the ultimate way to experience him at his best.
B00009NHC5|5.0|Based on Frederick Knott's Broadway hit, Wait Until Dark is a chilling film, even by today's standards. This is a masterfully crafted thriller about three deranged crooks who manipulate a blind woman to recover their lost smuggled goods. <br />Audrey Hepburn is fantastic as Suzy, in her Oscar nominated role, showing us a fairly realistic portrait of a fragile woman coping with her dark new world. She manages to garner our sympathy, especially with Efrem Zimbalist Jr's demanding husband watching her every move.<br />Alan Arkin is equally terrific, making a terrifying villain. <br />Wait Until Dark manages to create a paranoid environment devoid of any human life. The apartment building Suzy lives in is perpetually empty; Suzy's husband, Sam, leaves her on her own for most of the day, and the dorky young girl upstairs is apparently motherless most of the time. The cave-like arches of the apartment has an unsettling effect of positioning Hepburn in a nondescript underground (the windows only look out on the feet of passersby, emphasizing Suzy's disconnect from her neighborhood). It all creeps up on the audience, making for a suspenseful, claustrophobic and effective shocker. I literally could not breathe during the film's final ten minutes. <br />Definitely wait until dark and watch it with someone who likes to scream. This is a true nail-biter if there ever was one.
0553269631|5.0|this was the greatist yet saddest book i have ever read. i am almost in eighth grade and was assigned this book to read and i am very glad i was assigned this book. the heart is a lonley hunter is about four very different yet very alike people strugling through life. this is definentley a life changing book. this book i recomend to teens and adults only because young  childeren between the ages of 1-11 may not be able to understand the true meaning of the story. if i could give this book ten stars i would.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Avril Lavigne came on the scene with her punky but sill radio friendly hit, &quot;Complicated.&quot;  Her debut album was good but did not add anything too new to the music industry.  Still the catchy tunes made her album &quot;Let Go&quot; a smash and showed the potential of a new name that we would be talking about for a long time.<br />She's back with a much better album hat does exactly what the title says.  &quot;Under My Skin&quot; is a more in depth look on Avril's thoughts and is better musically.  The first single, &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; sounds a lot like &quot;Complicated&quot; but is more fierce and mature.  The highlights include &quot;My Happy Ending&quot;, &quot;Nobody's Home&quot;, and &quot;Slipped Away.&quot;  The one and only track that isn't worth listening to too much is &quot;How Does It Feel&quot;.  It comes with good intentions but the slow song fails to entertain in the same way that &quot;Slipped Away' does.  Overall Avril brings us an amazing album that only a fool would sleep on.  So buy it!
B00006C7G9|5.0|First and foremost: If you're a fan of World War II films, whether of the epic-in-scope variety or the up-close-and-personal type, go ahead and purchase this VHS set right now. You won't regret it for a moment, and without question you'll watch all ten hours multiple times. Offering a bit of everything, fans of almost any style of war film should enjoy this.<br />Band of Brothers is a well-crafted, well-produced ten-hour epic following the exploits of one World War II Company (Easy Company of the 101st Airborne) from their pre-combat training, through D-Day, the Battle of the Bulge, into the concentration camps and through the end of the war. While it focuses on this one company, the series is unquestionably epic in scope, featuring hundreds of actors, a huge cast, and tremendous, fantastic sets that truly capture WWII Europe and magnificent combat scenes.<br />As noted, the series moves deftly between the personal and the epic; the stories of huge conflicts and of personal turmoil.<br />On the personal side, Band of Brothers allows the viewer to get to know a rotating cast of core characters, and to know them very well. Most of camera time focuses on a solid six to eight soldiers in Easy Company, but over the course of the ten hours more than double that number have moments to shine, some small and some entire subplots. The performances throughout are excellent. You'll get a good understanding of and sympathy for the men portrayed on screen. Lovers of war film camaraderie will love large portions of this series thanks to that chemistry.<br />On the epic side, Band of Brothers shines, mixing equal parts Saving Private Ryan and A Bridge Too Far. We constantly get a sense of both the hectic, frightening nature of small-scale combat, as well as the grand scale within which this small band is fighting. The vistas are stunning, the action powerful, and fighting brutal. From the huge air drop the night before D-Day to sieges of French towns to the shelling at Bastogne andmore, this series thrills with its exciting, often gruesome combat footage. Effects, techniques and styles are often lifted right from Saving Private Ryan - and that's not a bad thing, since that film has been hailed as having some of the most realistic combat footage ever.<br />While some have levied criticism against Band of Brothers for being a gung ho Americans won it all series, the fact is, that criticism is unfounded. (I'd wager some of those critics did not watch this whole series). The soldiers here are routinely portrayed in both a positive and negative light; their actions good and bad and all of the gray in between. So, too, with the Germans, who are shown as fierce fighters, but who at several points throughout the series are shown to be what they were - people just like the Americans, fighting for their country.<br />The events shown in the series (with the exception of a few small inventions) are drawn from historian Stephen Ambrose's book of the same name, a book compiled through the firsthand accounts of the men portrayed on screen. It's rather difficult to take \\"rewriting history to make America look good\\" critics seriously when the `characters' in this series are real soldiers, still living, who have said, \\"this is my story. Here is what happened.\\" These guys are having their story told for a reason: It's an amazing story.<br />Speaking of the actual soldiers: A fantastic bonus here is a full-length documentary featuring the living members of Easy Company. Seeing the actual men who went through what is shown in this series, hearing them tell their stories, is a truly moving and powerful experience.<br />No, the price tag on this hefty set isn't small, but it's undoubtedly worth it, as you'll want to watch your favorite installments over and over again. Even if this set featured only the very best episodes (2, 3, 5, 7, and the very moving 9) it would be worth every penny. Buy this now.
B00003W8NM|5.0|To sum up a long review, this movie is briliant, my personal favorite, and worth viewing many many times, dont miss it, it's a classic(in my opinion at least).
B00028HBKM|5.0|Based on all the hoopla, positive and negative, I went to this movie thinking I would be bored from knowing the story and disgusted by the violence.  I was wrong!  Not only does the Aramaic work well and convincing but also the story was \\"fresh\\" and exciting.  Gibson does a super job of directing putting in some very scary scenes such as a snake that appears to come from a demon and having some children turn demonic and attack Judas.<br />As Jesus is beaten by sadistic and unfeeling Romans, the populace look on including his mother.  You feel her pain as the torturers flay him to a point that you wonder if he has any skin left.  Throughout the beatings there are some very nice flashbacks, showing Jesus in happy times with his mother, making a table for her.<br />The only drawback to the movie is the part when Jesus is made to drag his cross to the crucifixion site.  Gibson seemed to drag that part out almost 30 minutes.  It is quite interesting that a man is forced to help Jesus carry his cross and the man seems to have more difficulty than Jesus even though Jesus is a bloody mess all over his body.<br />The movie seems to place the main blame on the Jewish priest Kyfus who seems to be obsessed with seeing Jesus die for going against Kyfus's teachings.  Kyfus spurs the Jewish crowd to demand that Jesus be crucified.<br />Like anything Biblical, we will never know what is the truth and what is someone's interpretation.  And yes, with things like The Da Vinci Code, many people question if any of this story is true.  That is up to your own personal beliefs.  However, whether your believe or not, Gibson has made a powerful film and by far the best rendition of the story that I have seen and this movie can be enjoyed both by believer and non-believer alike!
B0000DJZA5|1.0|The best version of the song &quot;Let It Be&quot; is on the original 1970 album release.  The three most recognized versions include the original album cut, a spectacularly produced version by Phil Spector including a great distorted guitar solo by George Harrison; the 1970 single, which edited out the guitar solo to fit the song for radio play; and the reproduced version on this album which has a thin, tinny-sounding guitar solo.  On the original album, Phil Spector saved an average song by adding the background, which is very obvious by listening to the two versions side by side.  &quot;Across the Universe&quot; is also much better on the original 1970 album, as Spector's production again adds to an average composition, and overlays the nasally singing by the Beatles.  As bad as this is, I'm surprised that Rolling Stone and VH1 don't rank this more highly like the other albums.
B0002858YS|5.0|I first heard \\"Mr. Brightside\\" on a benefit CD for the Brendan Borek surf contest/fundraiser in southern NJ - loved the throwback to *good* 80's music (somewhat rare), with the essential post-80's elements.  So, I preordered this CD and downloaded some of there other web-released singles - love them all.  Listening to the full album, it's a solid work.  If you like any of their influences/similar artists (Interpol, Psychedelic Furs, etc.) you'll probably enjoy The Killers.  Hope these guys hit up some East Coast venues soon.  Good luck to the band.
B000000W5L|5.0|This album being my favorite Stones album ever and probably my favorite of all time is a true classic. Despite two weak songs at the start &quot;Shake Your Hips&quot; and &quot;Casino Boogie&quot; the album comes right back with bluesy rocker &quot;Tumbling Dice&quot;. It just speeds up from there never looking back.<br />I can't really put into words what is so great about this album. Everytime I put it on I begin to like it even more. The standout tracks are &quot;Rocks Off&quot;, &quot;Tumbling Dice&quot;, &quot;Sweet Virginia&quot;, &quot;Let it Loose&quot;, &quot;All Down the Line&quot;, &quot;Shine a Light&quot;, &quot;Soul Survivor&quot;. I would have kept it shorter but it is virtually impossible with an album of this magnitude. Excellent Buy. IF YOU LIKE ROCK AND ROLL THEN THIS IS &quot;THE&quot; ALBUM.
B000089RVX|4.0|Well I liked this album and Amy Lee's vocals but it's true that Evenescence = Amy Lee. There is very little room for two in this band. The only thing outstanding on this album was her vocals which have been done a thousand times over in Europe. However, this doesn't make this album any less enjoyable. The songs are a mixture of rock and ballads. All the songs are enjoyable but in the middle of the album, they start to sound the same. The start and end are great though. Their ballads are by far worse than anything else and My Immortal was the worst song on this album. In songs like 'My Immortal', you can hear the pop elements come through. But, My Immortal is only one out of eleven songs on this album so you should really but it. Besides, Evenescence will never do another album this good again. It's all pop after this.
B00008972S|5.0|This is by far my favorite musical. This is truly a great film. No wonder it won best picture at the 1961 academy awards. It is about Tony(Richard Breymer) and Maria(Natalie Wood, trying to put on a Purto Rican accent) They meet at a dance, but their two familes( Tony is American, Maria is Purto Rican) dont approve of their relationship. Marias brother is killed, and so is Tonys friend. Then Tony gets killed, and Maria's brothers girlfriend Anita almost gets rapped. There are some great songs such as Tonight, Cool, I Feel Pretty, and America which only adds to the films greatness. Rita Moreno as Anita, is an excellent dancer.<BR>    In case you didnt know, almost all the main roles are dubbed for singing except for the guy who plays Bernardo. The voice overs are very well kept secret, so you think the characters are actually singing their own songs. The film is sort of a Romeo and Juliet in the city type thing. It is about love and predjudice. Truly a movie for those of a mature audience. I have found that when I was a youngster, I hated the film, but now I love it. The goof-offs and immature audience in my class hate the film, but those who are more applied seem to enjoy it. Anyways, Natalie Wood is great, along with the rest of the wondeful cast.

B0001N5IHG|5.0|This film begins as a young Irish couple drive their station wagon past the Canadian border patrol with their two kids in the back seat.  After a brief tour of Times Square, the family settles in a shabby tenement.  Johnny, the father, for the first half of the film, steals the acting spotlight as he attempts to find work as an actor, as he attempts to attend to fatherly roles such as beating the heat by carrying upstairs a huge air conditioner for the humid New York summer, buying a new plug with beer bottle returns money, only to find out it doesn't work; as he attempts to win an E.T. doll for his daughters at a local carnival, coming dangerously closely to losing his family nest egg; but most importantly, perhaps, by constantly hamming it up in a fatherly way around his daughters.  Eventually his daughters, over Halloween, meet a downstairs tenant Mateo who turns out to be surprisingly nice &amp; kind family friend.  <BR>     In the film's second half, Sarah assumes a more important dramatic role as she becomes pregnant and has a difficult premature delivery.  This set of circumstances reminds everyone of the two girls' deceased brother Frankie, who died at a young age of a brain tumor.  The film is filled with atmospherics from the New York tenement where the family lives; fortunately the story has a happy ending as the baby survives after a blood transfusion and someone has paid the $30,000 hospital bill.  The film is a very touching story of a young Irish family in impoverished circumstances.
B00004TJKI|5.0|Otto Preminger was one of the most creative and brave directors of the american cinema in the fifties and sixties.<br />His works were loaded with a ravishing realism , they were very expilict , challenging and disturbing .<br />Imagine what it means the plot around the adultery commited by the wife of an officer in that age . You can reply me with From here to the eternity but this film is more shocking , and overcomes in dramatic punch to From here ...The other examples you may think is Baby doll and Dial M for murder in the fifties, but this one wins the match.<br />The powerful sequence in the Court has only a serious match in The Nuremberg judgement . Never before there was not a previous film so disturbing like this that film  who explicitly turned around the bitter and awful consequences about the adultery .<br />The plot is overwhelming , magnificient built , without any hole . The cast is incredible . Consider these giants actors as Ben Gazzara , George C. Scott , Arthur O'Donell, James Stewart and Lee Remick in her screen debut .<br />This film was nominated as the best film but was unlucky , because Ben Hur literally won all the prizes and somehow that fact stroke the undeniable virtues of that superb work.<br />However the time seems to set in the right place this picture.<br />Acquire this one.<br />One of the most remarkable films in the american cinema story.<br />If I could give this film ten thousand stars , I 'd do it .
B0001N5IHG|5.0|This film begins as a young Irish couple drive their station wagon past the Canadian-U.S. border patrol with their two kids in the back seat. After a brief tour of Times Square, the family settles into a shabby tenement. Johnny, the father, steals the spotlight for the first half of the film as he attempts unsuccessfully to find work as an actor, to attend to fatherly roles like beating the heat & humidity of New York's summers by carrying a huge air conditioner up three flights of stairs, buying a new plug with his last pennies (which come from beer bottle returns money)--only to find out it doesn't work; to win an E.T. doll for his daughters at a local carnival, coming dangerously close to losing his family rent money; but most importantly, perhaps, by constantly hamming it up in a fatherly way around his daughters, both of whom are exceptionally bright. Eventually his daughters, over Halloween, meet the downstairs tenant Mateo who turns out to be surprisingly nice & kind family friend. Striken with AIDS, he is a Nigerian artist. Like the reclusive writer in &quot;Finding Forrester&quot; Mateo is a hostile recluse who only opens up after being charmed by the Irish kids' antics.R&gt;    In the film's second half, Sarah assumes a more important dramatic role as she becomes pregnant and has a difficult premature delivery. This set of circumstances reminds everyone of the two girls' deceased brother Frankie, who died at a young age of a brain tumor. At this point, Frankie becomes an absent extra lead in the film, similar to the deceased Diana in the film &quot;Moonlight Mile&quot;,a film I would also like to recommend. Due to this family's closeness, Frankie, who is seen only in camcorder shots, exerts a strong influence over his family, and this is particularly evident in the second half of the film. The film is filled with atmospherics from the New York tenement where the family lives; fortunately the story has a tenuously happy ending as the baby survives and thrives after a blood transfusion which one of his sisters graciously donates, and someone (apparently Mateo) has paid the $30,000 hospital bill. The film is a very touching story of a young Irish family in impoverished circumstances. All five leads, including the two children, are played with great enthusiasm. Moreover, one of the sisters sings &quot;Desperado&quot; at a school talent contest, one of the first times (and I hope not the last) I have seen the Eagles' music so honored in a major film.   One definite caveat: the movie sacrifices the realities of poverty for the powerful emotionalism, romanticism, and bathos of this story. We are made to believe everything will turn out alright, when in fact we have an unemployed husband & wife with three young children. Candidates for welfare, it would appear.
0062502182|3.0|Although written with creativity and warmth, this work will not be theologically sound to conservative Christian readers. The tale's premise is that the universe seeks to aid us in achieving our dreams and goals, and that our heart is always right. These are incompatable with even basic Christian theology regarding sin's devastation of the world of man and nature.<br />A much more realistic representation of achieving success through fundamental principles that are theologically sound would be &quot;Mizraim Principles&quot;, which follows Joseph the Hebrew from the pit to the pinnacle.<br />A nice inspiring read if one leaves it at that.
B0000DD7LB|3.0|Finally Britney owned up to the devirgination that Justin performed on her as she ownes her womanhood in this CD. After a gimmicky tounge slip on the VMA's Britney trys to capatilize off a wanna be lesbian kiss on her first single \\"Me Against the Music\\" with Madonna.The song is a cool dance cut but there is no chemistry there as if letting the kiss try to sell the song really leaving it to fend for itself. <BR>  Britney makes a dance oriented album laced with mundane ballads (with exception of \\"Everytime\\") and lackluster dance cuts. \\"Toxic\\" will get clubs going with a euro laced sound, and she takes a page out of her ex's book by recruiting some Hip Hop hitters like R.Kelly on \\"Outrageous\\" and the Ying Yang Twins for the redundant dance cut \\"I Got That (Boom Boom)\\". \\"Touch of My Hand\\" has a form of eroticism that will cause her to be in young mens (and older mens) wet dreams for a while. Britney wrote seven of the thirteen tracks but we arent listening to Britney for lyrical content, She knows it's sex appeal that sells her records, with lines like \\"I'm flirting on the verge of obscene\\", and how the hell did she pull Moby to produce a track for her?<BR>  Whatever the case it's working for her, and at least she hasn't totally sluted herself out like a certain other pop princess.Britney has been called our generations Madonna but at times she comes across trying to sound like Janet, but she doesnt have the same charisma that they possess , but her counter parts Beyonce and Christina do. Is there sex appeal check, controversy check, Britney gets in the zone, but what zone is she in? Is she Hip Hop, Pop, Lesbian, she seems confused to me.

B00003CXHJ|1.0|Leaving aside the MASSIVE AND GROSS historical inaccuracies which yet again fail to acknowlegde the fact that it was the UK not the US who got the first enigma machine - this is still a TERRIBLE film<br />Wooden acting, submarine film cliche after sumbarine film cliche, complete lack of suspense, obvious plot, boring direction and I have to say some rather weak special effects make this a truly painful experience to sit through. <br />What was Matthew Machonahy thinking off i ask you? If he wanted to make a war movie then surely there must have been a better script floating around hollywood than this? It feels as if the story was written committee style by a load of second rate writers who had no clear idea what they were trying to say!<br />Please I beg you don't waste your time or money on this film - it will leave you reaching for the bottle of jack daniels in a vain attempt to try and wipe your memory clean of this most excruciateingly dull film

B000002AGN|3.0|More than 40 years after its first appearance, Time Out still retains its popularity. But along with this it has acquired a set of myths and misconceptions: for example, that it represents the Brubeck Quartet at its best; that Brubeck was a \\"cool\\" jazz musician; that his use of unusual time signatures and other time-related devices was some kind of important innovation in jazz. <br />In fact, in the context of Brubeck's work as a whole and of jazz in general, the quartet's experiments with time are less significant than is often supposed. The claim that these experiments would have an important influence on other jazz musicians has not been justified, and it's not difficult to see why. What matters in a jazz musician's use of time is not time signature - the number of beats in the bar - but rhythm - how phrases are placed and accents distributed in relation to the beat. In other words, what matters is how the music \\"swings\\". All four members of the Quartet knew how to swing (saxophonist Paul Desmond more subtly and flexibly than Brubeck or drummer Joe Morello). But the jazz musician swings most effectively and employs a greater range of rhythmic and poly-rhythmic resources when playing in a conventional time signature, one which, in the development of jazz, has been internalised to the point of being its \\"natural\\" rhythmic medium. The problem for jazz musicians when they try to improvise in time signatures more complex than \\"common time\\" (4 beats to the bar) or \\"triple time\\" (3 or 6 beats to the bar) is that the need to consciously \\"count\\" the beats in the bar inhibits the usual flexibility with which they can play in, against and around the beat (as well as inhibiting their melodic and harmonic invention). You can hear the effect of this inhibition on Time Out when the playing becomes overly self-conscious and the rhythms laboured and mechanical: for example, when Brubeck, on \\"Kathy's Waltz\\", hammers out his repetitive 4/4 phrases against the rhythm section's 3/4 time, or when Joe Morello, in his solo on \\"Take Five\\", tries to find rhythmic patterns to play \\"against\\" the 5/4 measure and sounds in danger of being cut adrift from any coherent time signature (on the other hand, his light, bouncing swing behind Desmond's playing on this famous track is one of the best things on the album). <br />Once the novelty value of these experiments with time has worn off, a listener might justifiably ask the question: why? Why play 4/4 against the rhythm section's 3/4, other than to show that it can be done? (And didn't we already know this from centuries of folk, ethnic and European classical musics?) In a piece like \\"Three to Get Ready\\", why bother to alternate throughout between two different time signatures if the musicians can play more freely and naturally in one? What would \\"Take Five\\" lose, apart from its novelty value, and its rhythmically inhibiting effect, if it were \\"Take Six\\"? (It would presumably not need Brubeck's repetitious \\"comping\\" to mark the time signature so obviously.) One of the most original compositions on the album is \\"Blue Rondo a la Turk\\". But it's not really a jazz composition as such, and it's significant that for its improvised solos it shifts from the \\"Turkish\\" theme in a complex 9/8 time signature into a conventional 12-bar \\"walking\\" blues in 4/4 time - which seems to concede that the unusual time signature is of limited value, and too tricky to negotiate, for an improvising jazz musician. <br />The other effect of this \\"time\\" material was to shift the focus of interest within the quartet's music to the compositions themselves, and away from their function as vehicles for jazz improvisation. This would matter less if they were more interesting as compositions, if the melodic and harmonic material were less simplistic (&quot;Strange Meadow Lark&quot;, \\"Three to Get Ready\\" and \\"Kathy's Waltz\\" sound like themes which didn't make it into The Sound of Music or Mary Poppins). Perhaps this simplicity is a reason for the album's appeal to listeners from a background of pop/rock - that it makes the often-complex nature of jazz more easily assimilable. A spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down. <br />I'm a long-time fan of the Brubeck quartet, and still find things to enjoy on this and the other \\"time\\" albums. But the problem when part of an artist's work is overvalued is that other works can be unfairly undervalued and the artist's true strengths neglected or misunderstood. The Brubeck quartet's strength was always in its spontaneous, creative improvisation - particularly in the ability of Brubeck and Desmond to improvise genuinely tuneful lines on fairly conventional standards. You can hear that gift for melodic invention on Time Out, but it is stronger on other sessions without the use of tricky time signatures to needlessly complicate the process; and both musicians were more rhythmically inventive when improvising within a conventional time signature. So I suggest that we should take with a pinch of salt some of the extravagant claims made for Time Out, see it for what it is - a lightweight, enjoyable but overrated album - and look elsewhere for the best of the quartet's music, not least to the early-50's concert recordings: Jazz at Oberlin, Jazz at Pacific College and Jazz Goes to College.
B000148KK2|2.0|I was a devoted fan of Diana's.  I have all her earlier albums. But recently, I have become very disappointed with her current albums. I'am a jazz devotee.  When I counted over 90 reviewers who share my disappontment with this latest album. I decided to look for an up and coming jazz vocalist who sings, plays, composes jazz and was lucky to find such a singer at the jazz festivals, I attended.  Let me introduce you to Dena Derose, who I think is everything that Diana is not. &quot;Love's Holiday&quot; is an extremely satisfying, refreshing CD. Her signature sound is vocalizing her piano solos or scatting with her swinging piano solos. Her voice is crystalline in sound, with impeccable jazz phrasing where she can easily change keys or slide through the bars with horn-like pacing.  She has an outstanding backup DeRose has arrived. I guarantee there won't be one disapointed jazz fan of Dena Derose.  Win me back Diana..
B0001HAHXW|5.0|Anyone who has given this Cd anything less than 5 stars is a complete idiot and knows nothing about great music. These are all songs that everyone should know and love. They come from a man who was way ahead of his time. And Clapton does a great job of putting a Now-A-Days spin to it. If you love the blues this is a must have for your collection. You might even want to pick up the complete recording of Robert Johnson too. Actually you should just to hear what the songs sounded like back then. Don't be fooled by Jackasses!!!! THIS IS A GREAT CD!!!

B00020HEG6|5.0|You will love this soundtrack for it's originality in comparison to the first 2 Harry Potter soundtracks. It is also, in my opinion, reminiscient of Williams' older works - the style is very much like the scores for the original 'Star Wars' movies - they are in no way the same tunes, they are different - but remind you of various subtle elements from those film scores. If you've listened to them before, you will know exactly what I am talking about.
B0001HAISG|4.0|Neverland has never looked so lush and treacherous, nor has the subtext of incipient sexual longing ever been so prominent as in P. J. Hogan's Freudian take on the J. M. Barrie childhood classic. Hogan skillfully revives Barrie's original concept of the story as a coming-of-age tale about a girl facing the terror and allure of womanhood -and the fantasy boy who temporarily seduces her back to the world of make-believe. <br />Hogan dares to cast authentic boy Jeremy Sumpter as Peter. Androgynous and feral, with his tousled hair and unsettling coquette's smile, this Peter combines irritating boyish bravado with hormonal confusion; he doesn't know what he really wants when he brings Wendy to Neverland as a surrogate mother. Rachel Hurd-Wood is a ripe and trembling Wendy, who fears the grown-up world, yet expects something more than childhood games from Peter. When Peter can't or won't comply, Wendy dallies with an even more ambivalent and unstable romantic object-Captain Hook (Jason Isaacs). Wendy is \\"not afraid, but entranced\\" by \\"the dark figure that had haunted her dreams.\\" <br />Isaacs' superb Hook is no comic buffoon. Psychopathic enough to gut his own crewmen with his hook, he's also a raging wit, vain of his own erudition, amusing himself with jokes no one else can grasp. (\\"Split my infinitives,\\" he exclaims, mid-battle.) Isaacs revitalizes Hook with dark comedy and menacing brio. Yet there's a poignant underpinning: the poison he concocts from his own tear is a toxic brew of \\"malice, jealousy, and disappointment.\\" Isaacs' textured performance invites us to ponder the tragedy of a grown-up Hook trapped forever in Peter's eternal childhood.

B00009V8Z9|5.0|I have owned this album now for almost 6 or 7 months now Id say, and I STILL cant stop listening to it.  It honestly is one of the few CDs I own that does not contain a bad song at all.  It has lots of emotion and is inspiring in every way.  The piano in songs like Chariot and Belief are so Beautiful.  If you are a fan of mellow music with a great beat this is a must own!!
B0001Z53AQ|2.0|eminem is very good - but none of that shines on this album! There are four very good songs though, and the rest are very bad. They are: &quot;Just Like U&quot; &quot;I'll Be Damned&quot; &quot;U R The One&quot; and &quot;How Come&quot;. Kanye West, Nas, Lauryn Hill and others are much better rap!
B0001NBMBC|5.0|This is MADNESS. The best Slipknot cd of em' all. This definately surpasssed the greatness of the last three albums. Acoustic songs,GREAT. I love the awsome melodic sound of the songs Vermilion Pt. 2, and Circle, and I'm digging the skull crushing sound of the songs Three Nil, and Before I Forget. My favorite songs on Vol. 3 are Befor I Forget, The Nameless, Opium of the people and Before I Forget. But dont get me wrong, the other songs are SWEET also. You must check this one out if you plan on considering yourself a true maggot, or metal fan.<br />Peace

They blend indie with short riffs, an original singer, simple music, yet it sounds so good because they're the only ones that sound like the strokes.<BR>And for the moron who thinks these guys ripped off the pixies, wth? Seriously thats like saying Shania Twain ripped off of MC Hammer. ROFL, think before u type.<br />For those of you that liked their first cd, the only reason why you wouldnt like them this time around is because you never liked them in the first place (Just thought you did possibly).<br />All the songs on the cd are very strong, and stick out as originals. My favorite though would be &quot;the end has no end&quot;. Please get this cd!

B000002OX7|5.0|Many Who fans name 1971's &quot;Who's Next&quot; as the Who's masterpiece, and why not---*every single track* on it is an FM-radio staple. My personal favorite Who album remains &quot;Tommy,&quot; but &quot;Who's Next&quot; easily gets the runner-up slot. It's a classic Who album AND a classic rock album in general, no doubt about it. &quot;Who's Next&quot; began life as the Who's follow-up rock opera to &quot;Tommy,&quot; which was to be called &quot;Lifehouse.&quot; But, to make a long story short, &quot;Lifehouse&quot; turned out to be too complicated a project for guitarist Pete Townshend &amp; company to put together, despite all of their efforts. So, the &quot;Lifehouse&quot; project was abandoned altogether, but Townshend made the wise decision to save some of the songs written for &quot;Lifehouse&quot; for the next Who album, which would NOT be a rock opera, but would just be a &quot;regular&quot; Who album. And &quot;Who's Next&quot; was born. (As for &quot;Lifehouse,&quot; it would remain shelved until 1999, when Townshend finally presented it as a BBC radio play.)ALL nine tracks on &quot;Who's Next&quot; are signature Who songs: &quot;Baba O'Riley,&quot; &quot;Bargain,&quot; &quot;Love Ain't For Keeping,&quot; &quot;My Wife,&quot; &quot;The Song Is Over,&quot; &quot;Getting In Tune,&quot; &quot;Going Mobile,&quot; &quot;Behind Blue Eyes,&quot; and &quot;Won't Get Fooled Again.&quot; All of them brilliantly written by Townshend except for &quot;My Wife,&quot; which was brilliantly penned by bassist John Entwistle (some fans name &quot;My Wife&quot; as the album's best song---I'm sure that makes Townshend feel really good!). Besides the outstanding songwriting, the Who totally ROCK on this sucker. Roger Daltrey's singing voice is a force of nature all on it's own (and Daltrey also gets one of THE greatest rock screams ever recorded on &quot;Won't Get Fooled Again&quot;), Townshend's guitar &amp; keyboard work is both ferocious and beautiful, and his occasional singing compliments Daltrey's very strongly. John Entwistle's bass is a monster, and his vocal on &quot;My Wife&quot; is excellent (his horn-playing on the song is also pretty cool). And Keith Moon is simply an electrifying powerhouse on the drumkit.This remastered edition of &quot;Who's Next&quot; not only sounds great, but it also comes with seven classic bonus tracks, including an alternate version of &quot;Behind Blue Eyes,&quot; and other Who greats like &quot;Baby Don't You Do It,&quot; &quot;Naked Eye,&quot; &quot;Pure And Easy,&quot; &quot;Water,&quot; &quot;Too Much Of Anything&quot; and &quot;I Don't Even Know Myself.&quot; From beginning to end, this Who CD is a complete package. As it's been said so many times before, The Who's &quot;Who's Next&quot; is a definitive, all-time rock classic, and one of the group's very best works. NO rock fan's music collection is complete without it.
B000068PQ0|5.0|The Flaming Lips; the low punk band that originally started in 1983 that grew up to write epics. In Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots, the Lips tell you that life is alright and it is O.K. to love. If you never heard the lips before, you probably heard the song &quot;Do You Realize&quot; on a comercial. A low-key punk band that has entered the new world and stepped into the future is what i think about the lips. I think that this is the best album they have done yet and one of my favorites to have bought. You will be driven into liking these softly-spoken songs.
B00009NHC5|5.0|...and then the knife whistling past her ear. . . &quot;<br />At the ripe old age of 38, Audrey Hepburn proved that she had aged like fine wine in Terrence Young's \\"Wait Until Dark\\", for which she earned her fifth, and last, Oscar nomination.  Despite obviously being based on the long-running Broadway play; as the majority of the story takes place in an apartment and there are few characters; it translates surprisingly well onto screen and is remarkably intriguing and suspenseful.  Alan Arkin, who plays one of the vilest villains of 60's cinema, Richard Crenna, and Efrem Zimbalist Jr. make up the stellar supporting cast and all turn in excellent performances.<br />The sheer terror \\"Wait Until Dark\\" inflicts upon its audience comes from the filmmakers ability to place us in Suzy's shoes.  The very idea of being blind and trapped in an apartment and horribly alone even though you are in one of the most densely populated areas of the world, just plains scares me.  The nail-biting climax has some truly classic moments in it (who knew Alan Arkin was such a gymnast?) and will stick with you long after the film is over.<br />As always, Audrey is simply perfection.  Charming and beautiful even in the most unflattering situations, she yet again proves her star power.  The constant distress and anguish Audrey portrays onscreen is achingly real, and unfortunately, not very far from the truth.  She was suffering from anorexia and marriage troubles with the producer of the film, Mel Ferrer, throughout the entire shoot.  One can only imagine how draining it must have been for her to be required to be screaming and crying the whole shoot while dealing with these problems.  Her Oscar nomination was most certainly deserved!
038073186X|1.0|This was the first book I have read from Lehane and I was sorely disappointed.  The story itself was borrowed from William Peter Blatty's book &quot;The Ninth Configuration&quot; (also a movie).  The similarities of the story line are so striking that it makes Shutter Island a poor replication of Blatty's ideas.  Completely unoriginal and, for those who have read Blatty's book, predictable about a third of the way through it.
1400032717|5.0|What a terrific book. The unique narrator gives us a look into the mind of an autistic person and a new way to look at our own reality.<br />Well worth the short time it takes to read.
078322608X|3.0|Well, this is one of those movies that keeps you hoping, keeps you wrapped up in its potential only to be let down at the very end with an unsatisfying and disheartening ending. It was good, interestingly edited, decent acting, and kept you guessing- at least between 2 or 3 possibilities. Brad Pitt turns in a surprisingly good performance... makes me wonder if Johnny Depp watched this before that gem Pirates of Caribbean...<br />All in all, an interesting watch, and a decent flick.
B0001GF2DS|5.0|This is a wonderful movie. I would recommend everybody who enjoys action, especially with the six-shooters, to go out and buy this movie, or atleast rent it out. <br />The story is set in the Civil War days. However none of the tree major characters are affiliated with one or the other side. Clint Eastwood and the Villain, both are mercenaries and 'Tuco', a retarded man is a bandit. Tuco and Eastwood come across a piece of knowledge that huge amounts of gold has been dug up in a grave in a cemetry. Persuing this gold is the Villain and Eastwood and Tuco join in the pursuit. <br />The three way duel in the end of the movie is quiet fantastic. It is very original and novel, not to mention different, from standard two way duels of regular western's. <br />Fans of Western and Action genre will definitely love this movie. There is a lot of shooting and Eastwood is at his best. The movie itself is set right in the middle of the Civil War so there are some war scences which add to the action of the movie. The color is magnificient and acting is decent. <br />I would definitely recommend adding this movie to your collection.
B000063UR2|3.0|(Please note that my review mentions a few scenes and plot elements which you may not wish to know beforehand if you have never seen the movie; however, I would definitely not consider them spoilers.)<br /><br />Legend is one of &#34;those&#34; movies for me. Like many of the movies I saw when I was young, it helped define my childhood.  I first saw Legend during its first televised airing in Canada at about the age of 8. My mother taped it off television for me, and over my unicorn obsessed childhood it became etched into my memory.  Strangely, I have never been able to find in stores the version I saw then.<br /><br />When the taped-from-tv version finally gave out on me, my mother bought for me an official VHS release for Christmas. I watched the movie with a sense of horror as I found that scenes that I felt were pivotal or pleasurably memorable were not present. The two notable scenes which were missing were the scene in which Gump riddles Jack about moonbells, and the one in which Jack faces the witch on his way to Darkness. The lack of these scenes brought the movie's greatness down a few notches for me. Perhaps if I'd never seen it with those scenes I wouldn't have noticed, but knowing just what was missing, and what the movie was without them, ruined something for me. So, when I found Legend: Ultimate Edition, I decided to buy it to see if the Director's Cut was the better version. However, I was aware when I bought it that my childhood version of Legend featured the Tangerine Dream score, and not the original. So I wasn't really sure of what I was getting with the Director's Cut. As this two-disc set includes both the US theatrical release (which I already had on VHS) and the Director's Cut, I also kind of hoped maybe something might be different with the U.S. version because this was the Director's Cut release. (Nope.)<br /><br />Imagine my annoyance to find that the Director's Cut is no better. In fact, I think it's worse. I will pick out three specifics that bother me:<br /><br />Lily: In the U.S. Theatrical release, I like Lily. She is sweet, and innocent, and a little foolish, but endearingly so. In the Director's Cut, Lily's dialogue makes her out to be much less likeable - she seems immature and spoiled, a brat. There were points where I wanted to slap her for being so irritating. She also sings. Ungh.<br /><br />The Score: The Tangerine Dream score has an atmospheric and often shadowy feel to it; the original score is much too over-the-top and takes away from the atmosphere of the film. Really, it doesn't feel much as though Jerry Goldsmith was watching the same movie everyone else was. Legend's dreamlike fantasy world grows into a dark nightmare, and this is served quite well by Tangerine Dream's interpretation; the original score is comical and clumsy in comparison.<br /><br />Added Scenes: The scenes left in the Director's Cut were cut from the U.S. theatrical release, with the exception of the scenes I mentioned previously as needing to be there, for a good reason; in addition to Lily becoming an irritating brat, most of the uncut scenes serve only to make parts of the film drag, or disturb the sense of flow. Some of them seem pointless or silly, as when Jack does a sudden flip in the air for no apparent reason. Perhaps if the score was more suited to the movie, certain scenes (such as the flip) wouldn't seem so comical or out of place, but when his flip is accompanied by a wild clashing of instruments, one has the urge to laugh at the clumsiness of the scene.<br /><br />Now, back to those two scenes missing from the U.S. release. Why am I griping about two little scenes?  Without the riddle scene, there seems a rather uncomfortable transition between Gump's rage at Jack for taking Lily to see and touch the unicorns and deciding to help him find her and make everything right. Not to mention it's a great scene! Also, Gump's riddling Jack is important to the story - Jack can't simply claim that love is thereason he did something stupid and then not have to answer for it. The riddle is a moment in which Jack can prove himself worthy of Gump and company's assistance in righting Jack's wrongs, and worthy of the quest itself.<br /><br />The scene where Jack confronts and kill the witch is just plain cool. And, yes, Jack again proves himself when he defeats her, even if it wasn't a particularly long or thrilling battle. Jack's youthful inexperience needs to be tested a few times before he reaches Darkness. The U.S. theatrical release leaves these out and Jack reaches Darkness untried. It goes against the whole idea of the quest. Silliness. In most fantasy stories (the good ones, anyway), the hero is always tested a few times in order to learn about his abilities before he reaches the final confrontation with evil. The removal of those scenes removes this important element and leaves the story feeling hollow.<br /><br />To be perfectly honest, I would not buy Legend: Ultimate Edition again if I had known the Director's Cut would annoy me so much. I would dearly love to find out why (and how) I saw a version that came somewhere in between the U.S. theatrical release and the Director's Cut, and even get my hands on an official copy, but that will likely never be. Needless to say, Legend *is* a beautiful movie, and if you must have it, stick with the U.S. theatrical release, cut scenes not-withstanding. I think my viewing of it is simply sullied by my strong childhood memory, and from knowing that my first viewings were of a superior version to the versions now available.riddle is a moment in which Jack can prove himself worthy of Gump and company's assistance in righting Jack's wrongs, and worthy of the quest itself.

The way the cd is mixed (country, house, hip-hop, eclectic) is amazing. This is truly by far the best cd Ive ever bougth. I just hope we could get more &quot;out of trend&quot; music, you know, not everything shown on MTV is art.
0790729628|3.0|Of course, in the DVD format, there is no reason there should not be a director's cut release. But there are legitimate reasons that people might prefer the theatrical version. I  found the director's cut to be flat without Ford's ironic noir-style narration. A lot of the classic lines from the film are from the voiceover narration, which does not appear in the director's cut. <br />And personally, I don't feel the original ending was a &quot;Hollywood happy ending&quot; either. They are driving off into the wild blue. Whether Rachel lives 100 years or 4 years, it is not going to be a bowl of cherries. That's just the point. Deckard didn't know how long she would live, or how long he would live. That's life. And now they are fugitives. This is a happy ending? <br />For me, Deckard was not an android and never will be. He was a crotchety, burned-out human blade runner who fell in love with an android. <br />So I will add my voice to the chorus of people begging for a proper DVD release of the theatrical version. There is no excuse for its unavailability. The public should have its choice, just as it did in VHS. I personally own the laserdisc release of the theatrical version, and visually the mastering is not that great. We need the DVD. But hear me now, Mr. Ridley Scott, you cannot make me buy your director's cut.

In their quest to prevent this from happening, the reader is transported from the Abhorsen's House all the way across the Wall to Ancelstierre. The path Lirael and her friends take is filled with many dangers, and this book is filled with action and suspense that will leave you on the edge of your seat and always begging for more. However, the end of the book is a little bit disappointing. Even though Mogget and the Disreputable Dog's identities are finally revealed, I kept hoping Garth Nix would introduce a bit of romance between Nicholas and Lirael, and many of my questions are still left unanswered. I also found that Sabriel and Touchstone were not present enough. Apart from these almost insignificant disappointements though, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It is impossible to put down and makes me hope that there will be some sort of continuation to this story. Abhorsen is a must read!
B0001NBMBC|5.0|This is a great CD. It's not like their s/t or Iowa...but it's still great. It's just like good old thrash/speed metal of the 80's. In my opinion, &quot;Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat.&quot; has been their greatest CD so far...but this is definately giving MFKR a run for its money. My favorite tracks would have to be &quot;Before I Forget&quot; and &quot;Opium of the People.&quot;
B000002C4J|5.0|Celine Dion has produced fine recordings since her debut in 1990 with &quot;Unison&quot;. Recently, her new albums &quot;A New Day Has Come&quot; and &quot;One Heart&quot; haven't matched her previous works, by far. And they don't come anywhere near this album. <br />Released in 1997, this album was a little underestimated until the release of the number one hit &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot;. <br />After the song became overplayed and overhyped, I bought this album. I found the unreleased singles were much better. By far, the best track is Immortailty. It shows the softer side to Celine, not the Celine that just explodes with high notes. Songs like Why oh Why do travel down the hip hop side. It seems that she has combined many genres, from classical, to hip hop, to pop, to altertative, nothing is out of boundaries for this incredilbe artist, whom I was lucky to see in concert. <br />As far as the strong tracks, there are few weak tracks. Miles to Go Before I Sleep shouldn't have made the cut on this album. Just A Little Bit of Love became quite annoying. <br />Overall, the great tracks make up for this. She takes her inspirations from Barbara Streisand, and great vocals from Carole King and Michael Jackson as well as Mariah Carey. <br />This is the best album she has released!<br />Buy It, you won't regret it. <br />As a matter of fact, I loved it so much, i have two copies, well I lost the first one.
B0001906O0|5.0|If you are a lover of The Cure you need this!  It has some songs you might not have heard before, and some remixes of familiar favorites like A Forest, Just Like Heaven, etc.  This will keep me occupied until their new CD comes out this month  :)<br />It comes in a lovely hard cover book format.  It has 2 CD's in front, 2 in back, and 76 pages of various photos, as well as notes and stories on the songs included.

B0000508U6|4.0|This is the most chill CD I have ever heard. Don't Panic has put me to sleep so many times I want to kiss the guy who wrote it. When I hear the words, &quot;We live in a beautiful world&quot; I feel like everything is wonderful and happy in my life even when it isn't sometimes. This song and album gives makes me look at things differently. We do live in a beautiful world.

B00020HEL6|5.0|This is THE VOICE! Whether she's the new Patty Page, Patsy Cline or Norah Jones, I could care less. All I hear is perfect singing that makes my days and evenings a whole lot more enjoyable. Right now I'm listening to A Love That Will Last and I just know there's no other singer alive with that much beauty in her tone. I really hope I'm around in the years ahead when she reaches her full stride.
B0001L3LUE|1.0|I have yet to read anything in which this man has ever said he was sorry or he made a mistake. Instead it's one excuse after anouther. This a man that history needs to forget, and the sooner he leaves this earth the better. Think of all the lives and distruction this man has caused.<br />Paul Posey
0140386335|5.0|ok I admit i didn't think its was gonna be verry good. I mean I loved he movie but i wasn't in to books or that kind of thing when i got but once i started reading it I couldn't stop. It filled my heart with every thing a book should. Now i can barly watch the movie cause all i think of is thats not how it was in the book. But I loved the book and i think if you like a good story or you love the Lord Of The Rings books you should pic this one up.<br />  (...)
B000268QB2|5.0|For pseudointellectuals who favor abstract soundscapes along the Kid A vein, this album probably isn't for you. You probably find anything with a verse-chorus-verse structure beneath you, as you would color in your wardrobe, your own natural hair color (my guess is that you dye yours black), or daily hygiene. <br />A recent review said this album is a far cry from Radiohead, which is true, but in a very good way. While Thom and the boys are great for your dour moments with your art-damaged indie scenester boyfriend, they're not for the everyday set of ears. The thing I love about Keane is that they're unabashedly pop, with catchy choruses, literal &amp; linear lyrics, and armfuls of talent. With just drums, keyboards, and a stirring tenor, these lads give just about everyone from Muse to Coldplay a run for their accumulative money. They're the younger brother to Travis, threatening to surpass their Scottish predecessors with these 12 modern classics.<br />As for the previous review that claims this album lacks soul, I have to wonder what constitutes as soul. These songs are impassioned, earnest, and contemplative--if these don't add up to soul, then you're a robot. To dismiss something that touches on universal themes with simple language is little more than abject music snobbery. Keane's my favorite band of the year, and they may just claim the throne to Favorite Band, Period. <br />p.s. Check them out live--they're incredible, not to mention heartbreakingly approachable.
0688163173|4.0|Teddy and Chuck, two US Marshalls are assigned on a case involving a missing mental patient/inmate from a mental institution on Shutter Island. On their way to the island, Teddy gets seasick, and the reader is already sensing that something is wrong with Teddy. And true enough. While searching for the missing patient, we learn that Teddy has some almost disabling migraines and that he is trying to deal with the horrors of World Was 2, where he was involved as a code-breaker. Teddy and Chuck suspects that there is more going on at Shutter Island than what just meets the eye, and this novel is masterly written. The ending is very surprising, and the author has managed to give the whole story and overall dark feeling, which just makes the story more intense. There are many things and happenings to think about in this book, and my guess is, that this is one of those books that will be better second time you read it.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|In my lifetime (and keep in mind, I'm only 18 years old, so it hasn't been a long lifetime), I have never seen anything like the kind of reaction Sofia Coppola's LOST IN TRANSLATION has received on its home video release. I saw this movie in the theater, and I liked it a lot, and plenty of professional film critics did too. But apparently the majority opinion of the public after this movie was released on home video has been the total opposite. Thus you have reviews like the one in the Spotlight Reviews section written by gregy55902, which, while admittedly well-written, is so disagreeable that I would be surprised if his favorite movies weren't the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy---movies about wizards and elves and dwarves that, while certainly well-made, hardly have anything to do with &quot;real life,&quot; and thus would find favor with this viewer who seemingly demands pure shallow escapism from his entertainment and can't (or is simply unwilling to) at the very least appreciate movies that try to be much more meaningful for us. If he wasn't moved by these two lonely characters and touched by their bittersweet separation at the end, then he probably just didn't want to be (since real life apparently doesn't belong to the movies, in his humble opinion---it doesn't make for exciting, mindblowing entertainment).<br />I'm sure he is not the only fellow who thinks this way, though, so I'll just leave it at that and call it his loss. But boy, is he wrong about the acting! What was this man expecting, Bill Murray to be consistently howling and sobbing with despair? The beauty of his performance as Bob Harris here is precisely that he refuses to overdo the feelings of despair his character must feel about his marriage, about the path his own life has taken, etc. It would certainly be the wrong acting choice, blatantly overacting in a movie that is meant to be realistic and with a character that is meant to be introspective. The great thing about Bill Murray's performance isthat we always respond to Bob Harris the character, not Bill Murray the actor. (If he's improvising certain lines, he is always improvising as his character, and not injecting artificial flashes of his usual comic personality.) gregy55902, if you think it is so easy to be &quot;real&quot; in front of a camera with full knowledge that there is a camera recording your every move, then perhaps you should try film acting yourself. It is certainly NOT as easy as it looks.<br />I would concede that maybe the film errs in perhaps not going far enough with the Bob Harris-Charlotte relationship. There is one scene, set in a restaurant, in which Charlotte's anger at Harris after he had accidentally slept with a woman the night before is palpable, and they both say hurtful things to each other. But that gets resolved a little too quickly for my taste---although their quick making-up perhaps shows how much they truly need each other. And the shots at Japanese culture are indeed cheap and facile (I should know; I'm half-Japanese myself). Despite all that, most of what is in LOST IN TRANSLATION in its final form is so real, and touches so deeply that I am sure I could watch it again and feel the same way.<br />Apparently, though, this movie is not for all tastes. I would still urge any adventurous moviegoer out there to at least give this movie a shot. Try to take it for what it is---a quiet yet  uplifting comedy-drama about two lost souls in a foreign land who don't necessarily do anything extraordinarily significant together and yet separate from each other feeling a little better about themselves anyway---and maybe you'll find it as moving (if not wholly perfect) as I did. Recommended.
0679428895|3.0|I liked Robert Harris' Pompeii. I read it in a few days, enjoyed it, and found the story to be well written. But - there is a but - it could be boring at times. It was definitely not the 5* nocel I had expected it to be. Anyway, I loved the ancient setting in the Roman city of Pompeii with all it's hustlers, decadent senators, prostitutes, slaves and gladiators. The main character is the young engineer Marcus, who has travelled from Rome to take over the job as water-engineer in the area around Pompeii. He soon discovers that something is wrong, and the story takes place on this the last days of Pompeii. Will Marcus get out of the city before the volcano erupts? Will he be able to save the girl he can't stop thinking about? Will he find out what happened to the missing water-engineer of Pompeii? The novel is full of interesting questions plus a good deal of 'lessons' about volcanoes, earthquakes and so on. A fairly good read, entertaing.
B0000508U6|5.0|I must admit, after hearing some of the great songs from A RUSH OF BLOOD TO THE HEAD, I didn't totally warm up to PARACHUTES. The first time I listened to it, it seemed like a good freshman effort, but nothing more. RUSH seemed more ambitious and more memorable overall. And yet, after a while, PARACHUTES started to grow on me. Sure, all its songs are, in a way, love songs, but they are all done in a style that is totally and unmistakably Coldplay---certainly the yearning vocals of Chris Martin is not something you'll hear in other love songs. That, and the lyrics make an admirable attempt to be something much more than the usual &quot;love song,&quot; to touch on things more universal than a man's unrequited love. From the line &quot;We live in a beautiful world&quot; in the opening song &quot;Don't Panic&quot; to the repeated impassioned cries of &quot;Everything's Not Lost,&quot; this is music that touches the heart and soul in a way more pop-packaged, audience-friendly music hardly attempt to do. <br />Despite the fact that I gave 4 stars to A RUSH OF BLOOD TO THE HEAD, I still believe it to be a better album that PARACHUTES, simply because its great songs---its first six tracks, especially---trump almost anything on this first effort of theirs. But PARACHUTES is admittedly more consistent in quality, and has some memorable songs of its own (my personal favorites are &quot;Trouble&quot; and &quot;Everything's Not Lost,&quot; and of course almost everyone knows &quot;Yellow&quot;). As such, I believe it deserves the highest rating. May Coldplay continue to rock on with its unique musical style! Recommended.
B00005NP04|5.0|Thank God for Martina McBride. She has been giving great service to country music and to country music radio for well over a decade now. She is a vocalist of immense talent whose range in voice and music is unending. Martina has proven herself to be an artist that is out of the norm for today's country music and can sometimes be hard to put in a single category. With today's fill of soft, generic, country/pop tunes that clutter the airwaves, it is nice to know that Martina is someone who makes music that rises above the others and doesn't get trapped. With the type of music that is out there being sung by other women who have capable voices, it doesn't go anywhere because they don't have the character or passion that Martina does. She sings with such fierce certainty and poignance, that she makes everything she does seem much more important. And a lot of it is. With such light pieces of fluff like 1999's &quot;I Love You&quot;, Martina manages to imbue much more charm and irresistability to the song and makes it much more better than if someone else had done it. Same goes with her two earlier hits, the toe tapping country rockers &quot;My Baby Loves Me&quot; and &quot;Life #9&quot;, both are the first two songs on the CD, and both from the &quot;The Way I Am&quot; CD. Also from that CD is the non-single cut, &quot;Strangers&quot;, a song that Martina says is the best non-single of hers. Martina also became known as an &quot;Issue&quot; singer. And her songs and interpretation of the strong stories in each are some of the best in the biz. The first one, and what is her trademark song, is &quot;Independence Day&quot;, a fiercely written triumph that tells the tale of an abused wife getting her revenge. It is a great song and Martina gives it one heck of a performance. One of the 4 new songs on the disc is another great issue song called &quot;Concrete Angel&quot;. This one is so delicately written and so beautifully performed, it ranks with one of Martina's best. Hands down. The rest of the CD has everything that has come in between. Her smash hit with pianist Jim Brickman called &quot;Valentine&quot;, which has become a hallmark song every year when the holidays rolls around, is here. One of her best hits is &quot;Wrong Again&quot;. A great catchy delivery that gets points for having a different chorus every time. &quot;Whatever You Say&quot; is one of those classic Martina performances that blows out the speakers. &quot;There You Are&quot;, which is a beautiful song, should of been a bigger hit. &quot;Love's The Only House&quot; is a top notch song wonderfully written with a Bruce Springsteen-like harmonica part. &quot;A Broken Wing&quot; is one of her best triumphs. Great sound and a great delivery. The other 3 new songs(new at the time anyway)were Martina classics. The funky and jammin' &quot;When God Gearing Women Get The Blues&quot;, the powerful &quot;Where Would You Be&quot;, and the song that Martina says seems written just for her, &quot;Blessed&quot;. Martina has gotten the due and respect she deserves. It pains me to see reviews from critics who praise a hardcore honkytonkin' female performer who they say isn't a cookie cutter of people like Faith and Martina. This brings me to believe that people, including some critics, don't quite get or understand Martina. She sings pop-ish country tunes and has a big, big voice. I guess that means it's all the same to them, when in reality it means that they don't know the music and they don't pay good enough attention. With songs missing from her debut album, a few choice cuts and hits that were excluded here, and already a few new hits with her latest release &quot;Martina&quot;, it shouldn't be long before this little powerhouse with the most beautiful eyes there is has a second volume.
B000069AUI|4.0|This was my first exposure to the wonderful music and sound of Coldplay, and it has hooked me to this band ever since. Their lyrics may be either be truly poetic or trying-too-hard-to-be, but it's their wild and wonderful sounds that really gripped me: the emphatic repeating chords of &quot;Politik,&quot; the halo effect of &quot;Clocks,&quot; not to mention that touching yearning quality in Chris Martin's voice. No, this album is not as consistent in quality as PARACHUTES was. The first six songs on A RUSH OF BLOOD TO THE HEAD have always seemed much more memorable to me than the remaining five. I don't mean to take anything away from very good songs like &quot;Warning Sign&quot; and the title track, but songs like &quot;Politik,&quot; &quot;God Put a Smile Upon Your Face,&quot; &quot;The Scientist&quot; (especially), and the Grammy Award-winning &quot;Clocks&quot; are simply so wonderful that the rest inevitably suffers by comparison, good though they are. Besides, RUSH is clearly a more ambitious effort than PARACHUTES, and it fulfills its ambitions much more often than it fails.<br />To sum it up: Coldplay's A RUSH OF BLOOD TO THE HEAD is a near-great album that may not be as consistent as PARACHUTES but is arguably the more substantial effort. On a whole, it is not to be missed!
B00009XITP|2.0|This movie is definetly not for people who seek any kind of realism in films. I only watched the movie because I love Colin Firth and I think Amanda Bynes is cute but the movie is gag out loud sweet. It contain three things I hated<BR> 1.) The uninspiring dance scene. I hate Hate HATE when movies deem it neccesary to have every one dance the SAME move at a party. (other that the electric slide or something like that.) I've been to many parties and that has never happened.<BR>2.) So strange young girls can just pop up on your doorstep and claim to be your daughter and no blood test. <BR>3.) A girl 17 years old, I repeat 17 years old can fly all the way to London ALONE and find her father within like two days of leaving.<BR>I found this movie to be too cheesy for words. I can't relate to movies if they don't even try to treat me like I have a brain.
0312995423|1.0|If you know anything at all about computer systems, or even worse cryptography, you'll find this book somewhere between moronic and offensive.  I'm startled that David Pogue, who knows a great deal here, liked it ... guess he's better than I at suspending his disbelief!<br />If you can't understand why this book gets panned by those who know even a smattering about this topic, yet think you liked Brown's others ... maybe that's because you don't know much about those other topics, either?
B00004W4UB|5.0|I don't really understand what everyone is talking about when referring to Ms. Robert's performance.  I thought it was exceptional.  It was nice to see her stretch.  Anyway Malkovich was fantastic!  This story was great and I thought it was well executed on film.  Close had an interesting role also and I loved hearing her accent.  See this one.
B00005RRG9|1.0|As with most of Disney's DVD releases, they seem to have some quality control issues. I purchased this movie (which IS a wonderful movie) as part of the Vault Disney 4-movie collection.<br />I had to return my first set, because the case was broken on &quot;Old Yeller&quot;. No big deal. But then...the secondary disc on &quot;The Parent Trap&quot; skipped and stalled, and &quot;Swiss Family Robinson&quot; wouldn't even load.<br />Having had terrible experience with Disney DVD's previously (&quot;The Great Locomotive Chase&quot;), I opted for a refund instead of dealing with the frustrations of another set that was defective.<br />Frankly, Disney's products seem to have so many problems, I doubt I will ever buy another one. Many of their movies are in the wrong ratio, some are terrible transfers (&quot;Old Yeller&quot; in particular, and also the Chinatown scene in &quot;The Love Bug&quot; comes to mind), and now I've had this set and &quot;The Great Locomotive Chase&quot; which have had &quot;playability&quot; issues.<br />For a company with such a great library of old movies, it is really sad that they put out such an inferior product. As I would love to include them in my DVD library. But one shouldn't have to concern themself with worrying whether a DVD is going to play or not when they purchase it.
B00005Q4CS|4.0|I don't usually review movies, but this one got under my skin. Basically it's the story of what drugs can do to people, the dark side of it. The acting is excellent, and Ellen Burstyn was amazing to the point of being scary. The other actors did a fine job too, and the photography really complemented everything. As I watched, I became more emotionally involved with the characters than I usually do in movies, and I really started to feel depressed, and even sick by the end of it all. Probably the worst thing is knowing that there really are people out there in these situations, going through hell for just those few moments of pleasure. It's quite a moving film, and might be powerful enough to make some people clean.
B00003CXBK|5.0|I just watched this one again, not for the first and not for the last time. There's just so much to like here that I hardly know where to begin.<br />Others have already pointed out, at length, that the founder of Irontown is hardly the Evil Queen she first appears. The Princess has flaws of her own, as well. Each, however, has a moral stand that holds together in its own way. In fact, the real problem comes from a character that first looks minor - his amorality turns out to be the most destructive force in the movie.<br />What keeps me coming back to this film is the setting in which all of the movie's action occurs. It is clear to my Western sense that I'm watching a very Eastern movie. The forests and factories could be anywhere, mostly. They are set in a world with its own history and mythical beings, though, and they aren't any history or myth that I know. Somehow, Miyazaki creates a meaningful story out of pieces with meanings I don't understand. It makes me want to learn about the tradition and lore that he draws on for his imagery.<br />This is not just great by the standards of animation, it's a good movie by any standard. It really is worth enjoying again and again.
0312319517|1.0|Like the previous reviewer, I had my doubts that Forsyth actually wrote this. It reads like an amateur attempting to write in Forsyth's style. It's clumsy and convoluted, the characters are entirely two-dimensional, and what's more it's simply dull.<br />I've loved every other Forsyth novel, but this is a real stinker.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|This score was beautifully, and masterfully crafted. I love the &quot;Into the West&quot; Theme that occurs so often... The song Grey Havens nearly brought me to tears the first time I heard it and continues to be one of the most beatiful pieces of music I have ever heard written for an orchestra. Every time I hear it, I get chills. This score takes you places as only excelent music can do. Howard Shore is a gifted and brilliant composer and director... This score and its two companion scores (LOTR 1 and 2) are incredibly moving and well-crafted!
B000002J1U|5.0|If there were one word to describe this album, that would be it.  Only because I cant think of a word that is better.  This is definitly my favorite Led Zeppelin album of all time. I personally, prefer the type of songs that are softer, but also lengthier, such as Stairway to Heaven, Babe I'm Gonna Leave You and on this album: Since I've been Loving You.  I would buy this album just for that one song, and would have recieved the others as bonus gifts.  But since each and every song is in my opinion, perfect, I couldnt be happier every time I pop this CD in to my stereo.  If you are a Led Zepp fan of any kind, you probobly already have this CD, but if you are new to the band, I would reccomend working your way of the &quot;Stairway of Heaven&quot; in which you would buy or obtain in some manner, each album 1 by 1, in order or release. Encore, encore.
B000002UB3|5.0|Abbey Road is yet another Beatles masterpiece,and their last album made,but not the last LP to be released(somehow Let It Be wasn't released until just after the group disbanded).I love the way they combined the album's last couple of songs,meaning how Sun King,Mean Mr.Mustard,Polythene Pam and She Came In Through The Bathroom Window are connected together as a four part song,while Golden Slumbers,Carry That Weight and The End are joined together as a three part song.
B00006690G|1.0|put the idea of buying this trendy,idiotic album out of your mind.Rap is horrible and always will be when people are inventing new slang words just so they can rhyme and talking like yo dawg yyeeeah just to get street cred then its no longer music its a fad and it needs to be stopped.rap is horrible music(if you want to call it that)go pick up a metal cd and cleanse your mind of this crap.
B000002UAO|5.0|Rubber Soul is many a listener's favorite Beatles album. I consider it slightly overrated (I don't think it's quite in the same class as Revolver or the White Album) but it's head and shoulders above anything the Beatles had released so far (only A Hard Day's Night comes close for tightness and originality). And it definitely belongs in the pantheon of great Beatles albums for two reasons: 1) the songwriting and the music has has developed at an astonishing rate, and 2) at least three or four of the songs deserve a spot on any top 30 list of Beatles songs. There may be more bona fide masterpieces on this single Beatles disc than any other. The numbers are, in order: Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown), John's slightly surreal ode to an affair with touches of George's sitar; Nowhere Man, with it's transcendent score, breathtaking harmonies, and memorable lyrics (the first that did not involve love in any fashion); Girl has some of the best lyrics on the album, plus great playing and unforgettable vocal flourishes (the &quot;tit-tit-tit&quot; backing, and the sharp breathes before &quot;Girl&quot;); and In My Life is one of the most beloved songs every written, with its moving lyrics and sped-up piano playing. Interestingly, the four best songs on the album are largely thanks to John. Paul has the next-best song, another one that can be considered great (though some find it cloying): Michelle, partially in French. I'm Looking Through You is also a classic, You Won't See Me is fun, and Drive My Car further showcases the Beatles' lyrical growth with clever lines that are a long way from &quot;Love love me do. You know I love you. I'll always be true. So please, love me do...&quot; Finally, George is growing by leaps and bounds as a songwriter. Think for Yourself is his first &quot;prophet&quot; piece, and If I Needed Someone is one of the best songs on this album. Another cool number is The Word, which has been described as proto-hippie. At any rate, this album has tons of excellent songs and is well worth your money. Yet, believe it or not, better things were to grow from the seeds of Rubber Soul...and not just material by the Beatles. Brian Wilson pushed the Beach Boys to record Pet Sounds as a direct response to the innovation and tight songwriting of his competitors, and he wasn't the only one impressed. By the way, this has a memorable cover and the best title of any Beatles album.

0761536434|3.0|I've always been fascinated with video gaming history. Although I was born in the mid 80's, consoles such as the Atari 2600 have always captured my interest even though they were &quot;outdated&quot; by the time I got into video games. The neat thing about gaming history is that you can tell the story from so many different angles - different companies, different time periods, etc. Although I've read many books (and articles) on video games prior to this one, there is still plenty to learn - and there was certainly information in here new to me.<br />There were many things to enjoy in this book, but there were a few shortcomings. I loved how the book went in-depth on the history of the classic gaming era, but it seemed to go a bit soft when it came to the 8-bit and 16-bit systems. Arcade games are discussed thoroughly in the beginning of the book, but are ignored near the end. Nintendo and Atari have chapters upon chapters of history, but lesser selling systems (such as the Neo*Geo) are restricted to the footnotes. The book also tended to waste too much time discussing court cases. Now, although many of those cases were turning-points for the gaming industry, a few seemed irrelevant (e.g., Donkey Kong vs. King Kong) and were confusing and hard to follow for someone like me without a background in law.<br />Make no mistake, the first half of this book is excellent. And in the closing paragraph the author says he intended to publish this book in 1995 or 1996. I think, given the little coverage he makes of anything past the mid-90's, his book would have fared better if released earlier. A few chapters (mainly the ones concerning the legal disputes) I could do without. The book also had a bad habit of jumping around in time. It documents the rise and fall of Atari's coin-op division, but then starts over to talk about the rise and fall of the Atari VCS.<br />Bottom Line: If classic gaming history is your thing, there are better books to be read than this one. But if youwant a broader look on video games that encompasses all generations - you may just enjoy this!
1401300901|3.0|I got through this book fairly quickly. It wasn't really an enjoyable read.  While there were funny parts, most of it was depressing and none of it was exciting or surprising.  Don't waste your time..
B0001LJC2K|1.0|Muse loves Radiohead.  A lot.  <br />To they point they would rather shamelessly imitate them down to the tiniest chaotic production trick (all skillfully photocopied from OK Computer except for some really horrible Italian restaurant-style piano parts).  <br />Too bad, in the course of their imitation,  they missed the most important aspect of Radiohead's music--subtlety.  The brilliant thing about Radiohead is they don't tell us the world is ending or liken love to a &quot;spell,&quot; a tired cliche Muse deftly uses.  Radiohead paints imagery with their lyrics to the point they don't have to TELL the listener the world is ending; they make them FEEL it.  <br />In contrast, Muse lays it out there for the dogs to eat it, black and white, red as day (other cliches they may want to use in their songs).  <br />Like many bands today, Muse has realized they don't have to create anything new or original.  They just recycle what's already been done (and done well, I should add), give the lyrics a doomsday feel, and play the listeners like dogs. . . all the way to the bank.  <br />They get one star for being able to imitate Radiohead, that must of been kinda hard for em.  I can't wait to hear their attempt to remake Kid A!!!
B00000DGUG|5.0|Alanis's Jagged Little Pill was better, but Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie is a close second. It has a variety of different beats, like the dance in &quot;So Pure&quot; and the soft &quot;That I Would Be Good&quot;. <br />Many of the songs share an Indian influence, like the angry &quot;Baba&quot; and the haunting &quot;The Couch&quot;.<br />Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie begins with &quot;Front Row&quot; (9/10). It's a catchy, poppy song with a strange intro. The second track is &quot;Baba&quot; (10/10). Baba is an angry track about non-belief. I love the &quot;Ah Vay Maria&quot; part at the ending.<br />Everybody knows the lead single &quot;Thank U&quot; (10/10). It's incredibly catchy ballad. Alanis's voice shines at the chorus. The next song is &quot;Are You Still Mad?&quot; (9/10) which is an acoustic song to tell her lover to stop moaning. Overall, a solid song. One of the three weak songs is &quot;Sympathetic Character&quot; (4/10) which seems very out-of-sync. Very weak.<br />&quot;That I Would Be Good&quot; (10/10) is the second best track. I love the flutes used in it. A true gem of the album. The best track is the following track, called &quot;The Couch&quot; (11/10) which is a haunting ballad with strange lyrics about her father. The Couch is THE gem of the album.<br />The follow-up to the wonderful The Couch is &quot;Can't Not&quot; (7/10) which has a strange beat. I love the bridge at the end. &quot;UR&quot; (10/10) is a strong track. Not much to say, but you should give it a listen.<br />&quot;I Was Hoping&quot; (10/10) is a very dark song. The lyrics are similar to &quot;The Couch&quot; and the beat is similar to &quot;Joining You&quot; two of the strongest tracks on the album, which proves the same for &quot;I Was Hoping&quot;.<br />&quot;One&quot; (10/10) is another strong song. It has a weird beat and somewhat dark lyrics. Three strong song prepare you for the worst song, &quot;Would Not Come&quot; (2/10). The wicked laugh at the beginningcreeps me out. The whole track is dark and creepy. Don't listen to it.<br />&quot;Unsent&quot; (9/10) was the second single to be released in the USA. It's about 5 letters to her boyfriends (Matthew, Jonathan, Terrence, Marcus, Lou) that were never sent. &quot;So Pure&quot; (10/10) was the third single if you don't count &quot;Joining You&quot; (10/10) which was never released in the USA. So Pure is a fun, catchy dance song. Joining You is depressing and has a strong intro.<br />&quot;Heart Of The House&quot; (4/10) is the third of three weak songs. Alanis sings with a high-pitched voice. The closer is &quot;Your Congratulations&quot; (9/10) which reminds me of Evanescence's &quot;Hello&quot;. I can't stand the operatic ending of Your Congratulations, but the rest is OK.<br />I really wish people didn't overlook this album so much. You should give this a listen. Go out and buy your copy today.
B00015HVI8|3.0|The weakness of season 6 is not the loss of the Daniel Jackson character, but the negative &amp; dark shadowing of the story lines.  The stories &amp; plots tend towards the hopeless and destitute, with very few positive or upbeat endings.  Much too much emphasis is put on the &quot;ascension&quot; aspect, to the point of wondering of the show has developed a religious agenda. There are a few good episodes in the group, but the only people who would really need this set are the hard core SG-1 fans, or those who just want the complete set.
B000089RVX|5.0|Evanescence is a rather shady group.  I heard they have 3 other albums out, but you can't find them in most music stores (I'm still asking around). The debut (which means the first one you can find easily) came out in early 2003.  Don't stop yourself from buying the CD from the cover.  Yes, the songs are dark and a bit depressing, but there are no other scary pictures in the album.  Amy Lee's voice is haunting, and the songs always have an interesting twist.<br />1. Going Under-  I think this was  a single.  This song has a cool part in the beginning (about 24 seconds into the song).  There is a nice piano in the backround.  This is a very good opener, it's fresh and jsut all around good. <br />2. Bring Me To Life-  This is the track that most people, if they hate it at all, hate it for a very foolsih reason.  That would be the rapper in the middle of the song (and, contrary to popular belief, that is not Ben Moody, it's Paul McCoy from 12 Stones).  It's a pretty trivial reaosn to hate the song, he's not in the song too much.  It's a very good song, but I'm rather bored from all the radio play.<br />3. Everybody's Fool- This is a song so true about America.  It is about all the people like Britney and Jessica.  Well in general I guess it's just about people in disguise.  Her vocals seem to really shine on this one.<br />4. My Immortal- I like this song, it's just that now I'm so sick of it.  I loved this song.  But if you like this song, don't listen to mainstream radio for a while, they are always playing this.<br />5. Haunted- The beginning of this song is creepy, it reminds me of being in a cemetary.  It's a very good song.  I love how, in Amy Lee's vocals, there is a higher pitched voice and then Amy's regular singing voiced, meshed together. It happenws in lots of the songs, but in this song it came to my attention more.<br />6. Tourniquet-  This song is the one that makes me cry. There is a sound of hopelessness in Amy's voice, she is almost like, 'I should cry for help, but I know that nobody will come to my aid'. <br />7. Imaginary-  This song is so good.  This song is definately an anthem for dperessed people.  I know lots of these songs have the sounds to be depresed people songs, but this has the lyrics &quot;I lie inside myself for hours, and watch my purple sky fly over me.&quot;<br />8. Taking Over Me-  This song is interesting.  You think the song will be a slow one, as there is a piano solo at first.  But then guitars kick in and this song turns into a rock song, that is, in a way, a bit &quot;mellower&quot; then the other ones.<br />9. Hello- This is the only other slow song on 'Fallen' (the other one being My Immortal).  If you ask me this song is a lot better then My Immortal.  It's a lot slower, never really changes pace, and it's just a sad s9ong all over, maybe something you'd play if a friend died.<br />10. My Last Breath- You knew the album would pick up the pace again, right? This song reminds me a bit of ' Taking Over Me' although it has a completely different sound.  Very good, but again, it sounds like the song was dulled.<br />11. Whisper-  An astonishing close, and rather lengthy (5:27) but it's well worth a listen.  The words at the end of the song are weird, but they can be found  at A-Z lyrics.com.  I think that they did a good job on this one.<br />All in all, I think that evanescence will probably not top this album with this next release. Of course, I said it about Avril Laivgne, and looked what happened!  I say that Amy Lee has a great voice, and I absolutely love the lyrics and the guitar and the vocal arrangement.  I also love how they got a chorus to perform!  My only grudge is that Ben Moody left.  I know, I know.  But he and Amy Lee were the main founders of the band! I guess we'll survive.  Anyway, if you like rock or gothic sounding music I would suggest listening to thid album.  And if you didn't like the singles from the radio, then maybe you shouldn't buy this album, as most of the songs on the ablum, although not sounding alike, have the same feel.

B000004286|5.0|Listening to the soundtrack of 'Braveheart' regularly has made me realize just how powerful music can make a film. I firmly believe that Braveheart would not have been as great a movie were it not for James Horner's music.<br />This is a very moving soundtrack. While there is a common musical theme/or sound that runs through the entire soundtrack (which is typical of movie soundtracks), Horner's imagination gives each song a new twist, added verse, or slightly different melody that keeps the listener's attention. Moreover, I love the sound of bagpipes (despite the fact that I come from a Welsh background) ; )<br />The tracks themselves have many various textures from smooth melodious flowing music to gruff, fully orchestrated pieces that rattle your player until there is an abrupt stop in the music and you are left wanting more. The feeling of the movie definitely comes out in the music.<br />Having been an avid soundtrack collector for over 20 years now, I can safely say that this is one of the best sountracks out there. I highly recommend it.
B00006CXXU|1.0|This is by far a waste of money, i cant believe i bought this crap, she might have a great voice but she doesent know how to use it, i dont recomend this album to anyone, Shes as Dirty as her Album's title, It should be called &quot;Stripper&quot; not &quot;Stripped&quot;
B000002J0N|4.0|This album had to shock more than a few people when it came out in June of 1977, eight years after their debut LP.  Perhaps one of those people was Neil Young, who decided during the 1974 Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young tour that the trio was &quot;finished&quot;.  Certainly the quality of the albums released by Crosby and Nash, and Stills since that tour produced little to dispel that notion.  Then along came CSN...<br />While the album for the most part lacks the political rhetoric and social import of 1969's 'Crosby, Stills and Nash', much that was always special about the trio resurfaced.  The first three songs, in particular, re-established the presence of their impeccable three-part harmonies.  'Shadow Captain' itself is a David Crosby composition that may have been chosen to open the album as a harkening back to the lush harmonies of 'Crosby, Stills and Nash'.  It's even a bit reminiscent of 'Wooden Ships', which opened side two on their debut album.<br />Perhaps even more shocking however is the fact that all three artists put on display compositions that rival their best work.  For Crosby and Nash, the contributions are more hit and miss.  Crosby offers nothing as compelling as 'Long Time Comin', or as beautiful and delicate as 'Guinnevere', but 'Shadow Captain' and 'In My Dreams' are solid, buoyant numbers.  Less appealing is his 'Anything At All', which feels self-absorbed and self-serving.  Graham Nash offers the only Top 10 song from the disc, the sentimental 'Just a Song Before I Go'.  'Carried Away', the second song offered, is also a fine composition, featuring more wonderous CSN harmonies.  'Cold Rain', however, is as dark and dismal as it sounds, without deliverance, and the widely acclaimed 'Cathedral', while musically compelling, carries a message that distorts who Jesus Christ is by confusing him with what His false 'followers' have sometimes purported to be doing on His behalf.  Nash must have some interesting discussions with Stills, who wrote'Jesus Gave Love Away For Free', and in his 'Singin' Call' cries out, &quot;Help me sweet Jesus I'm weary from the journey...&quot;.<br />Speaking of Stills, here comes the biggest shocker of them all.  CSN announces the return to form of Stephen.  He writes the three best rocking songs on the disc, the widely acclaimed 'Dark Star', and the hardly recognized 'Run From Tears'.  The latter is one of Stills' finest anthems.  I love the asides accompanying the first two verses, too spontaneous to make it into the printed lyrics.  &quot;I don't run from tears that's my weakness&quot; is followed by what is almost a second person thought: &quot;what rules me&quot;, and the second verse, &quot;But I know you still love me, though you don't believe it&quot; is followed by a subtle &quot;that's your choosing&quot;.  Oddly enough, neither song made it onto the national charts, while a lesser Latin-tinged Stills composition, 'Fair Game', ascended to number 43 several months after the album's release.  The closer on the album is another winner from Stills, 'I Give You Give Blind'.  It's a hard-charging performance driving home the reality that love is everything to live for in life. &quot;You gotta believe in something&quot;, goes the chorus, &quot;if you don't you will be lost, you gotta believe in someone, no matter the cost&quot;.<br />'CSN', along with 'Daylight Again' are the crunchy dark chocolate wafers that sandwich the white filling of 'Crosby, Stills and Nash' in a musical Oreo cookie that took thirteen years to complete.  You'll want to dunk all three in your CD player to experience the full flavor of their delightful work.
B000002KIK|4.0|Jun 19, 2004.<br />  First, let me tell you that I'm not a diehard fan. I really like Heavy metal rock, so I always try to make an analisis of group albums in terms of what they really offer to our society, to the Rock music and to the musicians (because a good musician will always has a technical deeper understanding of what really happen in the substance of all music). ?How trascendent to the evolution of music is this or that recording?<br />  So ?What is for me the Never Say Die album of Black Sabbath? This recording is the beginning of a new era, the transition between the classic Sabbath and a classier band, and the end of a series of experiments and musical adaptations with keyboards (more with synthesizers), that began with the Sabbath Bloody Sabbath album and finished with Technical Ecstasy.<br /><br />  And Because the struggling improvement for a  more mature musical style, the band were in a long period of search (Bill Ward, Geezer Butler and Tony Iommy) trying to evolute their Hard rock music...to take it to another level, due the new emerging music styles of the english scene and the changing taste of the consumers (Punk, New Wave, New Romantics...and Heavy Metal!). Ozzy Osbourne was really occupied with his personal problems and wasn't part of this new sound (listen the sound of Blizzard of Ozz and Diary of a Madman recordings).<br />  So if you could understand this, then you'll hear that the sound of the Never Say Die album is more relative to the Heaven and Hell recording than to the Technical Ecstasy album. Never Say Die is a more sofisticated recording with a fine essence: listen all the guitar textures (more jazzy &amp; blue based songs without loosing the heavy classic english sound), the powerfull rhythm section with a more technical mature style of Geezer Butler who was already enabled to enrich the estructured harmonies of the guitar as well as the Don Airey's keyboards (really supportive to the group's new sound).<br />  Top spotlights for this album are Shock Wave, Air Dance, Junior's Eyes, Over to you (typical Sabbath songs in the Ronnie James Dio period) and Johnny Blade. The Never Say Die song reminds us the same musical estructured hook of Paranoid, and Swinging the Chain presents similar tone voices, used as well in the first Black Sabbath album (The Wizard and sleeping Village). A Very Interesting Album! But still better: the return of the emotional ingredient lost in their past experimental records. Sabbotage, Technical Ecstasy, Sabbra Cadabra or Sabbath Bloody Sabbath have a few isolated good songs (sorry!). Never Say Die could be a underrated past recording but it will never be forgotten. It's not a record for the masses but for the connoisseur. When I first listen the Never Say Die album, I really thought that I had found the missing link in the Black Sabbath history and I hope you so...Good Luck!for this album are Shock Wave, Air Dance, Junior's Eyes, Over to you (typical Sabbath songs in the Ronnie James Dio period) and Johnny Blade.

B0001GF2DS|5.0|The Good, the Bad and the Ugly seems to be about the most popular western in the world. One can't help but wonder how that happened, considering how unusual and seemingly uncommerical it is. It is a film about style and mood, which means it is not a strictly staged and constructed production designed to funnel us through all the plot points and mandatory gunfights with a maximum of speed and a minimum of effort from either the producers or the viewers. It has a central plot, for sure, but nothing to demand the 3 hour running time. Not even half of that really. Instead of letting the plot create and then rule the world, Leone created a world and allowed the plot to creep its way through it.  This is something which is disappointingly rare in film, and Leone has made a film which is exceptionally good at performing this rare trick. This style can be a good or a bad thing, depending on who you are, but it's usually a good thing for me, and this film is pretty damn great film, no two ways about it.<br />The basic plot synopsis goes that the 3 titular characters are searching for a hidden treasure of Civil War gold, and though they don't trust or like each other, they need to work together to some degree because no one of them has all the information necessary to find the gold. That however, doesn't tell you a fifth of what actually occurs during the film, and nothing that really matters as far as watching or enjoying the film is concerned.  This is a genuinely epic tale, which is set in a dark, filthy and corrupt world.  This provides a strong contradiction, as there is no epic hero, and no fantastic setting, but instead we have a trio of outlaws, and the backdrop is a long, highly destructive war.(which the characters are not concerned with.) Thus the characters tranverse many miles and do many unlikely deeds, but they do not change the world, and do not care to.  And although they are all outlaws and killers, the sort of destruction they reap pales in comparison to what is occuring around them.  So as this and the other westerns of the era de-mythologized the old west, this film de-mythologizes the rest of the world as well, reminding us that violence, death and corruption were hardly unique to the old west.  Yet this is not all the film is about, and it isn't as dark and cynical as that may make it sound. It still has humor, still has excitement and intrigue and countless other things.(much like the real world) Wisely, no one theme or motif is allowed to dominate for too long. The tone shifts from the comedic to the hyper-dramatic to everything in between at various points in the film, and Leone does them all with ease.<br />Contrary to my expectations it's Wallach's Tuco Ramirez that dominates the film, not Eastwood's Blondy.  Tuco stands in strong contrast to the other 2 leads, as he is a nervous, tittering character who is often played for laughs yet is still violent and deadly and occasionaly truly brutish and sadistic.  Lee Van Cleef is great as Angel Eyes. He manages to portray an utterly heartless and irredeemible character without turning him into a ridiculous caricature.  These two characters illustrate what makes this film so good.  They stand very close to the edge, nearly becoming overblown and ridiculous, but never going so far as to actually become so.  In many ways Eastwood's Blondy is the least interesting of these 3 characters, but is largely redeemed by the fact that he is, well, cool.  His cool demeanor and sardonic dialogue stand in opposition to the more extreme, polarized characters, and he thus provides a sort of base for the highly-dramatic and stylized film.<br />Good characters aside, the real strength of this film is in the visual and audio presenation. Cinematography and sets are fantastic.  Not so gritty as to be unpleasant to look at but not overdone and overly picturesque either.  Lots of great wide angle shots, particularly during the bridge scenes.  Morricone's famed score is great too. The maintheme is overused a bit, but the rest of it is strong, particularly the brilliant Ectasy of Gold and The Trio in the closing scene of the film.  The gunfights are just great.  On one level, they are a sort of anti-action scene, as they are all build-up with little action.  The final shootout in the graveyard naturally stands out, and is one of the great scenes in all film.  It is a clinic in the Leone style, contrasting the beautifully conceived long shots with countless close-ups  of the 3 characters doing essentially nothing. 5 minutes pass between when the last word of dialogue is spoken and the first round is fired in what proves to be a very brief exchange, yet it does not disappoint.  The blaring score and the frantic editing just before the first blast are the true climax, and it is as effective as one could hope.  It is, as many have pointed out, dramatized and extended far more than is reasonable, but it holds up emotionally and visually and thus works beautifully.  The early scene between Angel Eyes and his first target is similarly effecting, and is another standout.  It's got darker more horrific scenes as well, such as Tuco's torturing of Blondy and his later torture at the hands of Wallace.  And many of the scenes with the armies have great sorrow and desolation. In fact, it pretty much all works, so while not every scene may be utterly necessary to move the plot along, they all manage to entertain in varying ways.  Most movies have difficulty entertaining on one level, so this is quite an accomplishment.<br />This is a fine DVD. It looks great, even the restored scenes.  Too bad they don't have old dialogue for them, and you'll definitely notice the new dubbing, but this should only be a mild annoyance at worst.  The extras seem pretty interesting, though I haven't watched them all.  All in all, a good version of a classic.

In fact, it pretty much all works, so while not every scene may be utterly necessary to move the plot along, they all manage to entertain in varying ways.  Most movies have difficulty entertaining on one level, so this is quite an accomplishment.<br />This is a fine DVD. It looks great, even the restored scenes.  Too bad they don't have old dialogue for them, and you'll definitely notice the new dubbing, but this should only be a mild annoyance at worst.  The extras seem pretty interesting, though I haven't watched them all.  All in all, a good version of a classic. Get it.
B0001NBMBC|2.0|I have alot of respect for Corey, and other members of Slipknot. However, I think that this album should not have been made at all. I think that Corey should have called it quits with Slipknot and just stuck with the stone sour thing. I really like older Slipknot, but this isn't them, this is like stone sour and slipknot thrown in a blender with a pinch of John Mayer maybe. I don't understand why they would do this to the Slipknot name, they already get enough crap for being &quot;numetal&quot; (whatever). I think that Corey and the boys wrote some great melodies but they are too catchy for Slpipknot, and they didn't even try with the more heavy parts. It's almost like just a bland filler until the ultra-catchy chorus. I recommend the new killswitch engage if you want a good CD.....Goodbye forever slipknot
B000000OTY|4.0|Secret World Live has more interesting elements then Plays Live musically. Rather then just keyboards, bass, stick, guitar, drums and percussion theres violin, doudouk, harmonica and a strong female vocalist. The playing and singing are great on many along with the song selection (Red Rain substitutes for San Jacinto). The only drawback is that some of the tracks work better visually and musically then just musically.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|Okay, it's true, MUSE souds like Radiohead, but it's not like everything they do is stolen from Thom Yorke and the boys. They would sound exactly like Radiohead if Radiohead was a little less passive aggressive and actually got angry these days. Radiohead hasn't sounded this raw since the bends and were never as operatic. the piano sets MUSE apart, and while the falsetto souns like Thom, the other singing parts are much less whiny, and have a little bit more back bone to them than Radiohead's tunes. They actually remind me more of Queen than Radiohead, but perhaps too many of today's music fans hear an english man singing falsetto and write him off as wanting to be Thom Yorke. There is much more Freddie Mercury in MUSE. I am a fan of Radiohead, but i could never mistake one band for the other. go get this CD, and play it with the volume all the way up, the pounding piano and hard hitting guitar provide a good loud sound that Radiohead left behind with &quot;creep&quot;. in this MUSE rises to make it's own sound, full of modern pomp 'n' rock. it is an alternative rock masterpeice.
0805066691|5.0|This book recounts the trials and tribulations that the indigenous people have gone through, and continues to go through to this day.  Being of Native descent, I found it hard with the history lessons taught in schools.  A little too one-sided?  I think not.  Remember, history is HIS story -- the Europeans' version of what truly happened centuries ago.  It has taken too long for us to have our story told.  The indigenous people were keepers of the land, and never claimed to own the land.  We never had any concept of the value of gold.  We lived with the land and were one with it.  Was it right to drive them from their homes?  To have hundreds of men, women and children die during their walk of the Trail of Tears?  I clearly do not remember any of this being taught in history class.  Do yourself a favor and buy this book.  Read it with an open mind and heart and understand history as it truly was!  It is not one-sided in any sense of the phrase.  Being one-sided is not telling the whole truth!
055357342X|5.0|I read tons of fantasy.  This one's ... different.  Finishing the third book, I actually didn't think that highly of it initially.  But truth be told, it was because I was a bit at a loss for whom to cheer for.  Normally the lines between good guys and bad guys do not get blurred so much! (You'll understand if you read it!)<br />But... re-reading even from the first book, everything ties together. I'm eagerly anticipating the fourth book and I only hope he keeps surprising me!
B000024KNJ|5.0|one of the best albums vagelis has produced in my opinion, the title really fits the vivid vocals used in the tract, every single piece is worth replaying on and on again... your heart starts to pump loadly and finally you find yourself submersed in the mist of this fantastic CD.
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|Just as good as the first album, Room On Fire simply confirms how good the strokes are. Julian Cablancas is not only extremely talented (he writes all the songs, everything from the lyrics to the guitar solos) he is also very hot... ;) To all those who can't find anything better to do than say they ripped off the pixies or any other band, please don't waste your time. The Strokes have influences, they are not rip offs. Please stop comparing every new band to an older one and saying they all copy each other, it isn't true, you must accept that young new bands are really able invent their own quality stuff today.
B00000J7SS|5.0|Still to this day the most groundbreaking recording ever...period!!!!!This one absolutely changed my listening habits in music forever. Don't believe me?...Turn out the lights and listen uninterupted, start-to-finish. I gaurntee it will make you a believer.
0060392886|5.0|First of all, I need to say this: I don't like to read. I didn't even think I'd read this book all the way through. Well, I've read it twice. I've been a Crue fan for about 15 years. I was/am totally hooked on this book. If they're serious, I can't wait for the Dirt part 2.
B0001WTUH6|2.0|When Underworld was first marketed before it hit theaters, it marketed as a Romeo &amp; Juliet-esque love story involving werewolves and vampires.  Instead, from the first frame on, we are thrown head first into a derivative hyrbid of Blade, The Matrix, The Crow, and every goth kid's comic book fantasy (which isn't a bad thing, but it doesn't work here).  A war between the vamps and werewolves and raged on for over a thousand years, and it comes to a head when a skin tight leather clad &quot;death dealing&quot; vampire (Kate Beckinsale) finds herself in the middle of a conspiracy involving a young doctor (Scott Speedman), and plot twists and turns are about.  Where Underworld could have succeeded, it fails almost miserably.  The action scenes are overdone yet unimpressive, the cast is bland and there is overacting aplenty, and where the story could have been something really special (the aforementioned Romeo &amp; Juliet-esque love story) is what is most disappointing of all.  The film is now one of the newest &quot;bonus filled&quot; overpriced DVD's to be released of late (check out the Texas Chainsaw Massacre Platinum Series DVD and the Mystic River 3 disc DVD set), but the new material adds nothing to the film.  It's worth checking out for some, but better left on the shelf.
B0000YEEHG|5.0|This is Ingmar Bergman's greatest achievement as a film director (most of us have not seen his stupendous stage productions and only a few of his &quot;made-for-TV&quot; films).  <br />It is, quite simply, the greatest film of the 20th century by its greatest film director. All films should be judged against it---and found worthy or wanting.
B00008H2LB|2.0|I'm not going to waste my time going on about how bad they suck like other people, but I will say there are much much better bands out there that are capable of more musically and lyrically. The first problem I have with LP is all their lyrics sound too similar. Its all about inner conflicts that are caused by relationships falling apart, could they find some other topics to write about possibly? I mean it all sounds the same &quot;giving up a part of me I've let myself become you&quot; &quot;the very worst part of me is you&quot;, come on. By the time I got to track 8 I started laughing at the lyrics, seriously. How about singing about something thats going on in the world today or something? My next problem is that LP are very limited music-wise. Their so formula based its not even funny. Start off with an electronic sample, then bring in the power chords which leads into the soft verse. From the soft verse comes the loud chorus, then repeat, add a bridge maybe and then ending. Not that difficult folks. Theres no acoustic songs or anything, its all pretty straightforward. LP's guitarists are really really really bad. 95% of the guitar playing on this album is power chords, thats it. When there is a riff, its extremely simple (Breaking The Habit). The only impressive riff on here is the extremely overused one in Faint. Its obvious their not capable of having more than one basic riff per song, either. Solos? FORGET IT! They don't even come close to pulling off a decent solo. Bass- this is pretty bad too. You can barely hear it, and even when you can nothing special. Drums- well their drummer is okay, but he is very predictable and plays too simple. How about using the cymbals every once in a while eh? They have a DJ, but he's really not that great, theres lots of better DJ's out there. Music wise, I think the only thing LP have going for them is Chester and Mike Shinoda's vocals, which go hand in hand perfectly together. If Chester wasn't in Linkin Park, he'd probably be an American Idol winner by now, no joke, and Mike is a pretty good rapper and he's got a distinguishable voice. That and the fact that some of their songs are melodic are the only things LP have going for them right now. I think LP fans need to open their eyes a little bit. LP fans at my school are mostly jocks and popular kids, and they diss bands such as Good Charlotte. I think to myself &quot;why&quot;? Good Charlotte is much better than LP music wise and lyric wise. Their guitarists can play 2 to 3 different riffs per song, and they have a couple solos on their first CD. Their bass player can be heard, and their drummer is much much better than LP's. Plus they cover more topics in their songs. So just keep searching for better music out there, if you want a start, try out Blink-182's new CD.
B00006879E|5.0|this CD was one of the best CD's I'd ever heard. When I bought this CD, I had very little interest in it. I heard all the songs one time and didn't really like it until I listened to it more and more and realized how much I liked it. With the exception of &quot;secret&quot; the rest of the songs were really good.
0393316041|5.0|The book is just great. It has a great humorous and adventurous side and shows the reader what an interesting character Richard Feynman was, totally different from the awkward sterotype by which people relate to scientists. Feynman is very candid and speaks his mind, and the book is a very colorful account of his adventures and experiments with different circumstances. I'll recommend the book to everyone, not just those who are interested in science. The book really shows how much a person can do in one life. Even if one bit of Feynman's personality rubs off on you, this book would be twice worth itself.<br />Comparing this book to 'A beautiful mind' about John F. Nash, I can see a big difference in the fact that I didn't keep this book down for even a second, while 'a beautiful mind' (a boring description of the boring life of a generally boring person) is lying somewhere gathering dust ever since I read the first chapter.

B00005JLEX|5.0|I like Seinfeld a lot, but since everyone's humor taste can be different, it doesn't matter what i think.  some people like Friends and some like Mad About You, and it is all different taste of humor.    I believe though, Seinfeld is a bit \\"dark comedy\\"... people who like the cooperative, friendly, and polite atmosphere usually like Friends and find Seinfeld too intense for them.    I suggest you watch a few Seinfeld on TV and see for yourself.  Rent it at blockbuster when it is out.  Later Seinfeld are better than the earlier ones to me, so you may want to watch some season 3 and later ones.  See for yourself.  If you like it, great.  If you don't, great too.  After all, it is just a show about \\"nothing\\".

B00005K3NY|3.0|The Scanners are a group of beings who have a power that they can bend,twist,mutilate,and explode other human beings,using the powers of their minds. There are two groups of scanners good and bad.One of the scanners Revok wants the scanners to band together for his evil purposes, he spends his time trying to locate his brother, a good scanner, Cameron and finds him for the ultimate showdown between the good and evil scanners. In between all this we get to see a couple heads explode.Not really among Cronenberg's best, but it's ok.
B00006RU5B|4.0|So far, out of every &quot;supergroup&quot; to emerge - Audioslave is the only one, in my opinion, worth paying attention to - This album is much more interesting &amp; has much more substance than that pathetic Velvet Revolver album 'Contraband' - <br />So now that we got the question out of who's the best supergroup out of the way - Here's a new one....<br />Will 'Audioslave' only get better? I definitely think they will - Chris Cornell has a much different style all together than Zack De la Rocha, so RATM is going to have to warm up to Chris's vocals &amp; style... which they obviously didn't completely do on this album<br />But the effort to work as a group is there &amp; there's no big egos - despite the over the top video for 'Cochise' which was cheesey, this band otherwise has shown great potential to be together... not as long as RATM or Soundgarden was, but to be together quite a while longer &amp; hopefully we'll milk 3-4 more albums out of them, but I doubt we'll get more than that...<br />Either way<br />They WILL only get better, so if you haven't picked up this album, you should - The music is very good, maybe It didnt live up to the hype, but it's still good music all the same... &amp; since they're gonna most likely release a few more albums, no reason to pass this up now &amp; then decide you want to pick it up 2-3 years later after Audioslave is more established - Just pick it up now so you can have the songs, you're gonna wanna get it sooner or later anyway<br />My grade, on a scale from 1-10.... would be a 7<br />Great energy, great guitar playing... styles need to blend better is all
B00005V3Z4|4.0|This is a film that provides a modern look at the philosophy of self-sacrifice, the kind that is almost of the magnitude of Jesus's sacrifice.  Unfortunately, as the director discusses in the commentary, he had to cut a lot of critical footage that made the film more difficult to understand than it needs to be.  That's why I'm glad there's a new Director's Cut, and if I were you, I'd wait for that to come out on DVD.  This subject was previously tackled by Andrei Tarkovsky in his 1986 masterpiece, The Sacrifice.  That film's message is as clear as a bell, and stunningly similar in concept to this film.  Tarkovsky was a master of philosophical science fiction, and The Sacrifice was his last film, so if you compare the two, and I hope you will, you are comparing a novice filmaker's work (Donnie Darko) to a master's work.  In that regard, Donnie Darko is a really good effort on the part of the film maker, as I believe it's his first film.  Wait for his new cut, and also see the Tarkovsky film, as well as Tarkovsky's The Stalker and Solaris.
0679720200|4.0|The intellectual emptiness of the French spirit, a existential excuse to totally avoid self-preservation or any positive action, is adroitly depicted in this brief book of moral emptiness.<br /> The priority of normal life, from amoeba to kittens to citizens to complex societies, is to live and have control of one's life.  The French have lost this innate sense of survival, and this story is an eloquent description of a young man who was once disappointed and thus forever insouciant.<br /> The focus of this novel is a character who is a stark contrast to the typical Anglo attitude of resisting state, religious and most other authority;  instead, he presents a person devoid of values who simply goes limp even when facing the state authority of the guillotine.<br /> Such values nicely describe France and Camus.  The French collapse in 1940 is described by the Germans as one of their &quot;weekend wars.&quot;  In 1942, Camus spent a year in 'Le Panelier,' an old granite house in the village of Le Chambon, leisurely writing 'The Plague.' Like this book, it is an examination of man's willingness to allow killing without resisting it.<br /> It's the attitude of a totally defeated and demoralized people, an anthem of, by and for spineless wimps.  The Napoleonic era taught the French that hundreds of millions of Europeans rejected &quot;liberation&quot; when imposed by Franch cannons and bayonets.  Since then, France has only survived as an independent state because of the hated &quot;les anglais&quot; who came to their rescue in  1914 and 1944.<br /> Utterly devoid of any effort to control his own fate, Camus adroitly portrays a character who  --  like France itself  --  is a doormat for anyone and everyone.  It's a shocking book by American standards, but it inadvertently sums up the current French attitude that it's pointless to even attempt anything that resembles affirmative effort.<br /> Read it.  Think of it as a contrast between the domineering aggressive attitudes of Americans and the surrender monkeys of France.  It's an interesting insight into the mind and spirit of one of America's traditional allies; is timely, relevant and cogent.s of Americans and the surrender monkeys of France.

B00008H2LB|5.0|I'm into alot of music but I have to say, Linkin Park has blown my mind. Most of the time, I play it because they're good just lstening to it. And whenever I'm angry and need to blow off steam, Meteora and Hybrid Theory definitely work. Hybrid Theory was good hands down. In fact, when I listened to Meteora, something seemed a little empty but I grew to like Meteora in an offbeat, different way from Hybrid Theory. <br />Intro: no grade, only less then a minute long, leading to...<br />...Don't Stay: 5/5 i liked this song right from the start. i like how it was written and i can relate to it. the beat is pretty cool. <br />Somewhere I Belong: 4/5 these were one of the songs i was like, &quot;whatever&quot; but then I grew to like it. the chorus is kinda weak but they tried [they had about 30+ kinds of choruses so i guess i should give them a break]<br />Lying From You: 4/5 love the riffs and the style. sometimes i like it, other times, i get kinda annoyed by it. but i never skip this song<br />Hit the Floor: 5/5 this is a really cool song! I love it! Chester screaming the chorus really fits and the beat is really contagious.<br />Easier to Run: 4.5/5 this is where they sing quite nicely, a soft song compared to the others but i like that. variety, you know? and the lyrics are so true. <br />Faint: 5/5 love this song too! this is a really high-paced, feet-jangling song, hand-tapping song. the beat is excellent. the drums, forget it, it's the best. <br />Figure.09: 3.5/5 this is where i like the title better then the song itself. The chorus is nice, along with the bridge but the rapping gets a little too much and the beat gets kinda annoying. i'm picky about this song cuz some parts i like and others i don't.<br />Breaking the Habit: 5/5 i love the piano/strings on the background music; this song can actually make you dance or if u put it as a remix [not that i heard any but this is a danceable song, all i'm trying to say] the lyrics are metaphoric and it can relate topeople, including me. <br />From the Inside: 4/5 pretty decent song. the different time measure is pretty unique with the 6/8. sometimes i feel this way with other people in school and the verses hit a chord.<br />Nobody's Listening: 5/5 this is a song i loved right when i listened to it. the Japanese flute was a good idea to put and the chorus is beautiful. love the beat<br />Session: 3/5 weaker tracks of the album... cure for the itch was a lot  better. Session is good if u feel like break-dancing. i skip it sometimes but otherwise, it's an ok listen<br />Numb: 4/5 i thought this was a weak ending at first but when i started hearing it on the radio, i grew to like it. Now I think it's a good song to listen and sing. <br />If I had to choose favorites it'd be Don't Stay, Somewhere I Belong, Hit the Floor, Faint, Breaking the Habit, and Nobody's Listening. The rest are still good, too, however. They are worth listening to. the whole album is excellent and all of them relate to how I feel. The lyrics are meaningful and whenever I feel melancholy or angry, or just wanna listen to something good, Linkin Park helps.
B000001ED1|5.0|This is by far one of my favorite albums. Joan Osborne has one of the most soulful and haunting voices of any female artist. If you're looking for the album to be just like the thoughtful but pop &quot;One Of Us&quot;, you're looking in the wrong place. Most of the songs on the album are nothing like &quot;One Of Us&quot; but I think if you give it a chance you'll realize that other songs on the album like &quot;Pensacola&quot; and &quot;Crazy Baby&quot; are much better. Even if you're not a hardcore blues fan you could appreciate this album when you just feel like chillin' out and enjoying something real.
B00005JMFQ|4.0|This movie could have been unbearably sappy, but it has just the right combination of warmth and wit.  For those who love the British sense of humor this movie is a bull's eye
B000002IJA|5.0|At first glance at the track list, it would appear that this disc is a small best-of/greatest hits package, but obviously that's not the purpose of this album due to the absence of obligatory tracks like 'Highway To Hell,' 'Back in Black,' 'Dirty Deeds,' the list goes on. Actually, &quot;Who Made Who&quot; is the official soundtrack (minus Roger Miller's 'King of the Road') to Stephen King's 80s horror movie &quot;Maximum Overdrive,&quot; a film that has since become a minor cult classic about a day machines and other electronic devices begin to take over the world and kill their human inventors.<br />The fact that someone like Stephen King chose AC/DC to supply the music to his deliciously tongue-in-cheek movie seems ironic, but it actually fits, and once you watch the film you'll get it (he would do it again by using punk pioneers The Ramones for 'Pet Sematary').<br />As for the music, the album contains only three then-unreleased songs, but the others are a neat sampler for those interested in material from the first few AC/DC albums with Brian Johnson, with one song from the Bon Scott era ('Ride On'), which is a great song--one of the few, if not the only, sympathetic ballads in AC/DC's catalog--but it's not exactly the best song to use when introducing someone to Bon Scott's contributions to the group, one of the many factors that dispell the &quot;best of&quot; label some put on the album.<br />As for the three songs written for the film, the track 'Who Made Who' is surprisingly sincere, and slightly more restrained in its approach when compared to AC/DC's signature sound. It's hard to say what the lyrics are about; there are a few references to machines like video games and satellites, so they may relate to the film's theme, but the rest is hard to figure out, but the song is a great one anyway, making it the best AC/DC song that's not about women and/or booze (other good examples being 'Spellbound,' 'Night of the Long Knives,' 'Let There Be Rock,' 'Back in Black,' the rarity 'Cold Hearted Man,' and many others). The two instrumentals meanwhile, 'D.T' and 'Chase the Ace' both display infectious guitar hooks, and probably would have become two more AC/DC classics if lyrics and had been given to them.<br />Apparently, some different versions and/or mixes were used in the film for some of the songs, and there were even a few brief guitar pieces used that are not present on the album, which would be great to have, but even so &quot;Who Made Who&quot; is a delightful album to own.

B00005JMJ4|5.0|This is a brave film by Sophia Coppala.  A movie of emotions and connections set in a sterile, confusing and sometimes hostile environment.  The tone of this movie is set by a &quot;platonic&quot; relationship where two people grow to care more deeply about each other than if they had become lovers. This relationship  causes these characters to evaluate and come to important realizations about their primary relationships and themselves. More importantly  this movie spurred me to evaluate relationships in my life and myself. Bill Murray is brilliant.

B0001HAHXW|4.0|To the &quot;fan&quot; from Australia who trashed this effort: your opinion is your own and thus valid on that level.  But, at least get Eric's nickname correct- its &quot;Slowhand&quot;, not &quot;Slowtrain&quot;.  Now then, clearly this is not the same incendiary guitar work evidenced on &quot;Wheels of Fire&quot; or &quot;Goodbye&quot;.  Cream was a brilliant disaster, perpetrated by three disparate musical geniuses who were often as not completely miserable on stage.  The Clapton that survived that debacle as well the the drug and alcohol fueled &quot;Layla&quot; has his place securely cemented in the annals of Western music.  This new disc is a carefully considered , reverential tribute to one of Clapton's great, if not most important personal influences.  Is it the best thing he has ever recorded?  Clearly not, but it is an essential addition to his musical lexicon.  Take it or leave it.

The Longest run is also a great album. I wish they had in DVD Audio.<BR>And by the way, I'm a Metal Head as well (Black Sabbath, Oozy, Metalica) but I have learned to appreciate most forms of music. The guitar work on this album is superb.
0156029065|5.0|Baudolino, Umberto Eco's most playful novel, combines history with fantasy, Arthurian romance with a locked room mystery, while pondering the unanswerable question: what is truth?<br />The structure follows the medieval convention: it's presented as a series of tall, taller, and tallest tales of all told by the title character to listeners while waiting out a crisis: this time the sack of Constantinople by Crusaders in the early 13th century.<br />Witty and profound at the same time, you'll probably find yourself checking reference books and websites. And that's hardly a bad thing.
0765310015|4.0|I'm really enjoying everyone's reaction to this book, both good and bad. I'm from London and read books one and two about five years ago. I then came to the US and have been astonished that the series was not released over here. I should say that I totally understand why some people may be frustrated with the first book-while it has some great moments, it is very difficult to follow and doesn't seem to live up to the hype. Having said that, book two was simply the most outstanding fantasy book I have ever read and I'm really looking forward to the rest of the series. For those of us who are sick of hobbits prancing around and as an earlier reviewer mentioned, young boys saving the universe, we don't have a lot of options. Jordan has lost the plot and Martin, the best of them all, has writer's block(book 4 due next year)-give this series a chance and you won't regret it.
B00005JLWN|4.0|I am not a huge Sci-Fi fan but I must admit I enjoyed the message this movie contained.<br />Christian Bale does an excellent job in this film as the one intelligent person in a dead society who is willing to question an authoritarian system. His acting is found within his eyes, the only bright spot on a face tightened by a society that kills emotion. Some of the fight scenes are a bit &quot;Matrixey&quot; without all the over-priced special effects. Bale's scenes with the puppy will grab at your heart!<br />The concept of this film stays along the lines of the &quot;Matrix,&quot; &quot;Metropolis,&quot; &quot;1984,&quot; and &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; exposing the horrors of controlled societies. The government controls people in this film by a drug that removes all emotion from their lives, no anger, no fear, no sadness, no laughter and no love. Great art is burned and hidden by the underground who would rather die than live without beauty and emotion. Everything is mechanical, clothing is uniform and dull, relationships are for the growth of the species and crime is punished by a horrible cremating death. The story is facinating but don't fall into line with the robots instead fight for passion, like Christian Bale, without the guns of course!
B000089CJI|4.0|This is an aquired taste cd. Imagine coldplay with an inlaid mellow techno background, and maybe a bit, just a notch of Dashboard Confessional (mainly refering to the voice in some songs and the theme lyrics). &quot;Give Up&quot; is a unique cd with each song contributing to the shaping of the unique and indivdual melodic sound that the cd portrays.
B0000C1733|4.0|Since I bought their 2002 album \\"By The Way,\\" the Red Hot Chili Peppers have gone on to become one of my all-time favourite bands. Since then I have bought \\"Californication,\\" \\"One Hot Minute,\\" \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magik,\\" \\"Mother's Milk\\" and this latest release, \\"Greatest Hits.\\" At some point I plan on buying their entire back catalogue of albums, because to me they are so much more than just your typical rock band. Music is their lives and you can definitely tell on the songs they put out - the sheer funk, the brash and out-there vocals and the odd lyrics make them stand out from the crowd. They're also one of the biggest selling groups in history and fame doesn't seem to have affected them. Anthony Kiedis is pretty much a rock icon and deservedly so. He isn't the only talent on show though.<br /><br />You have the fantastic Flea, John Frusciante and Chad Smith. These four men are all different in their ways and possess beautiful musical qualities. Flea says that their backgrounds are from four completely different corners of the globe, and when they come together and make this music, it just click and feels right. Now some fans might say that the Chilis messed up in releasing this greatest hits album in the fall of 2003, but I think it was a wise move to allow newcomers to their music to round up on the past decade. True, the album focuses mainly on material from albums such as Californication and BSSM, but this is no bad thing.<br /><br />The album opens with two really fantastic songs, both from the same album. The first is \\"Under The Bridge,\\" and is definitely the song that made the Chilis real stars, allowing them to appeal to a mass worldwide audience. The second is \\"Give It Away,\\" the funk-laden rocker that became a true anthem. We're then brought up to the relative present with two cuts from 1999 - \\"Californication\\" is one of the band's greatest songs ever and has a stunning video to accompany it. The guitars and the vocals along with the lyrics just click and they completely nail it. Classic song. The second is \\"Scar Tissue\\" which is a much more laid-back, chilled out song. The guitar on this song is most memorable because it's just so beautiful. You really could listen to this song for many decades to come, and I'm sure I will be. \\"Soul To Squeeze\\" is another fantastic song, but I'm not sure which album it was taken from as it's not on any of the studio albums that I own by the group. The guitar is very evocative on this song and the chorus is very melancholy. Just relax and chill.<br /><br />\\"Otherside\\" is a heartbreaking song taken from the Californication album and another highlight from their career. I wish \\"Get On Top\\" was on this album, even thought it wasn't released as a single because sometimes I feel that it's a song that everyone in the world should hear. It's just too good to pass by! \\"Suck My Kiss\\" is taken from the BSSM album and became a big funky classic. With its brash guitars and drums, along with Kiedis' suggestive lyrical content, it's a true anthem from the Chili camp. \\"By The Way\\" follows up and was the lead single from the 2002 album of the same name. The song was a massive hit all over the world, and rightly so. It saw the band mellowing a little bit, but with some rocking sections inbetween the choruses. \\"Parallel Universe\\" is an almost sneaky song that gradually creeps in on you, like as if you're sleeping. The guitar is very fast-paced and it instantly became one of my favourites from the Californication album when I first heard it.<br /><br />\\"Breaking The Girl\\" from the BSSM album is a very outrageous song with loud-vocal verses and a very harmonised chorus that really stands out as a Chili Peppers classic. \\"My Friends\\" is another really brilliant song and the only cut to feature here from the underrated 1995 album One Hot Minute. \\"Higher Ground\\" is taken from 1989's Mother's Milk and the only song here to feature so. It's an average song, and shows the band in early development stages. Thepromise and spark is there, but it would take following albums to tune their craft well enough. \\"Universally Speaking\\" from the By The Way album is the only song I feel shouldn't be on this album, because it's just too poppy. It's a good song, but \\"The Zephyr Song\\" or \\"Can't Stop\\" would have been more appropriate. \\"Road Trippin'\\" closed the Californication album in fine style with its ambiguous and ominous style and works well here, before the two new songs play...<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 8/10<br /><br />The first of the new songs is the beautiful \\"Fortune Faded\\" which sounds a bit like it should have been on the By The Way album. The guitar stands out here very well as does the chorus. This is followed by \\"Save The Population,\\" the latest song from the band which isn't as good as its predecessor, but still worthy on a compilation by perhaps the most consistent rock band of the past 20 years. What you have on offer here is just a brief selection of some of the Chili Peppers greatest - and definitely most popular - music recorded. To compile all the greatest music from the band would take something like a double disc or perhaps even a triple box set. Since that isn't going to happen any time soon, you'll have to settle for this.

0783222955|5.0|I read this book when it first came out and I loved it so when the movie came out I wanted to see it. The scrip writers did not change anything. It was as if they just wrote the movie scrip right from the book. This is a first. Nothing was changed. A wonderful book &amp; a wonderful movie. Do see it.
0792846443|5.0|By now pretty much everybody knows the rule that the best movies made from Stephen King novels do not put his name above the title and do not trumpet the fact in the trailer.  This would be film's like &quot;Stand By Me,&quot; &quot;The Shawshank Redemption,&quot; &quot;The Green Mile,&quot; and, of course, &quot;Misery.&quot;  Director Rob Reiner did the first and last films on that list, so he would know.  The idea in this 1990 film is fairly simple and one that obviously would send shivers up and down King's own spine: what if an author became the captive of his &quot;number one fan,&quot; who, needless to say, is a psychotic maniac?<br />Paul Sheldon (James Caan) is a famous writer, who has been turning out historical bodice rippers about a heroine named Misery Chastain.  As was the case with Arthur Conan Doyle, who killed off Sherlock Holmes at one point, and Edgar Rice Burroughs, who tried to kill off Tarzan's Jane, Sheldon has enough of his fictional creation and has killed her off in a book about to hit the stands.  Meanwhile he has just finished a new novel about the slums in which he grew up that he hopes will establish his reputation as a serious writer.  However, after he leaves the secluded Colorado Hotel where he goes to write his books his car crashes during a snowstorm and he is horribly hurt.  But before he dies he is taken from his car and when he awakes he finds himself in a bed, both of his legs broken, and in the care of Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates), a nurse who gleefully informs Paul that she is his &quot;number one fan.&quot;<br />Grateful to be alive and believing Annie's story that they are snowed in and that the phone lines are down because of the storm, Paul recuperates.  He even lets Annie read his new manuscript, a privilege reserved for his editor, agent, and anybody who saves his life.  But Annie does not like Paul's new novel and when she discovers he has killed off Misery she goes off the deep end.  It becomes clear to Paul that if he has any hope of getting out of there alive, he is going to have to bow to dictates of his &quot;number one fan&quot; and bring Misery Chastain back from the grave.<br />Meanwhile, Paul's agent (Lauren Bacall) has called up the local sheriff (Richard Farnsworth) and alerted him to the fact that the writer, on his way to New York with a new manuscript, has disappeared.  With the help of his plucky wife (Frances Sternhagen), the sheriff starts to search for Paul, who is trying to find some way of getting away from Annie, even in his hobbled condition.  Unfortunately, the more he learns about Annie, the less he likes his prospects and the more desperate his condition becomes.<br />The original novel had a great irony in that under Annie's stern editorial guidance Paul is rather mortified to find the new Misery novel he is writing is the best thing he has ever done.  But with William Goldman's script the novel he is writing is but a small part of the game of cat and mouse between Annie and Paul.  Once it becomes clear Annie is insane Paul faces the daunting task of keeping on the slippery slope of her good side.  Besides, Goldman knows that the whole bit that King did in the novel with Paul's typewriter, which keeps losing keys as his work goes along, would not translate to the film, so he did not even try.<br />This film represented the second time King created a female character who would be nominated for a Best Actress Oscar, the difference being that Kathy Bates won for &quot;Misery&quot; whereas Sissy Spacek did not for &quot;Carrie.&quot;  While Caan turns in a solid performance as a character bound to a bed or wheelchair for most of the film, ultimately it is Bates who makes this film work with the way that she goes from sweet to sour on the drop of a pin.  Annie's is a many faceted lunacy and part of the terror is that Paul never knows which one will come walking through the door or back out of it again.  &quot;Misery&quot; struck me as being a flip on &quot;TheExorcist&quot; in that instead of being afraid of what we would find when we walked through the door, this time we were afraid of what was going to open the door and walk through.<br />&quot;Misery&quot; is a relatively simple and rather intimate horror film.  This time King's monster is a human being and that makes Annie Wilkes one of the scariest, especially as she is played by Bates.  When you think of all the fine cinematic performances Bates has turned in since then, especially in &quot;Dolores Claiborne&quot; and &quot;Primary Colors,&quot; you have to be glad that Bette Midler turned down the role of Annie when it was offered to her.e Exorcist&quot; in that instead of being afraid of what we would find when we walked through the door, this time we were afraid of what was going to open the door and walk through.<br />&quot;Misery&quot; is a relatively simple and rather intimate horror film.

B000089CKH|5.0|I was never really a fan of Nada Surf before.  I found their hit song &quot;Popular&quot; from the HIGH/LOW album to be, well...unpopular.  A friend of mine asked me to listen to LET GO and after a few spins I really got it.  This is an important recording.  It injects new life into the pop/rock genre by keeping things simple.  I've set the track &quot;Neither Heaven Nor Space&quot; on repeat many, many times.  &quot;Hi-Speed Soul,&quot; &quot;Fruit Fly,&quot; &quot;Inside Of Love&quot; and &quot;Happy Kid&quot; are infectous little gems as well.  Don't waste any time.  This is a must-have!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This show was a very unique sci-fi show mostly because it didn't use all of this futuristic technology that can do a million things at once.  In fact the only real thing that's futuristic about the show is the ship itself.  Everything else seems like it was from the old west.<br />The characters are all well thought out and their dialogue is typical Whedon style, which is extremely witty.  <br />The special effects are better than most movies.  When you see the ship flying in space it looks like there's a camera actually there, following it.  The camera is moving around like an old family reunion tape shot by your uncle.  But the most atmouspheric thing about it is, is that there's no sound.  They decided to take a realistic look at space:  no air = no sound.  Unlike Star Trek and Star Wars.<br />I would recomend this DVD set to anyone that wants to have a good time watching a great show.
B00005YXZH|5.0|Everyone knows the drama behind this record. Their label refused it because they did not hear a &quot;hit single&quot; on it. So Wilco buys their record from their label and circulate it underground via internet and important record reviewers. &quot;Yankee Foxtrot Hotel&quot; gains such a buzz. That Warner Music Group the same label that rejected this album offers more money to put the album out of Nonesuch which is the avant-garde label of Warners. It was a triumph of art over style and superficality. A middle finger to MTV, Clear Channel and Fred Durst. Without Yankee Foxtrot Hotel, the successes of Modest Mouse and Franz Ferdinand could not happen. That is why this album is important!
0805062971|5.0|From the amazing beginning all the way to the tragic end, Palahniuk keeps up the pace at mind blazing speeds.  I read this entire 208 page book in 1 day alone, and I still wanted more.  When compared to the movie, the book totally blows it out of the water !  You really get inside the heads of the characters, and you get to see a side of them that the movie just couldn't portray.  From the creation of Project Mayhem to 50 floors above the street in a Metropolian highrise, it really takes you on a ride for one of the biggest mind games ever written.  I look forward to reading all of Palahniuk's other works, because although he writes differently than other authors, he sure does know how to tell an awesome story !
B000002UAU|5.0|mere words cannot describe the greatness of this album which was described as the best album ever by rolling stone magazine.very highly recommended.

0156027321|4.0|A book to love.<br />I loved the way he gets the readers attention by making them grasp the concept in immense details. He is one of those rare authors whose books are, as people say, &quot;un-putdownable&quot;.<br />The only con to this book is the part where Pi is stranded with the tiger, stretching the book and making it so long that I had a moment there where I felt a tad tedious.<br />All in all, I would strongly reccomend this book.
B0001WTUH6|5.0|Underworld - you either love it or you hate it.  No one seems to be on the fence.  I am a die hard Joss Whedon - Angel and Buffy the Vampire Slayer fan.  But I have to admit, I loved this movie.  I loved the dark world setting, the powerful music, the movie's pacing, and the plot twists at the end.  Having said that, I did have to adjust to this new vampire and werewolf universe that the director and his team had created.  Werewolves running along the walls and being easily killed by vampires - not too believable.  The bullets of silver nitrate and sunlight were.  I thought Seline as the conflicted werewolf hunter was very believable.  However, our doctor hero seemed a wimpy hostage until he went through the transformation at the end.  If you love the commentary on the original DVD, then stay with that one.  If you are a DVD collector and want to have the entire series (Underworld: Evolution is due out January 2006), then get the unrated new version, too.  The funny outtakes, featurettes and comic book are worth adding to your collection.
B00005JKCH|5.0|While many critics complained that the CGI effects made the movie seem more like a video game, I found the effects jawdropping, awesome and quite fun.  Sam Raimi's fast-paced, lively direction perfectly propels the comic book hero onto the big screen.  Tobey Maguire is perfect as Peter Parker, showing his immense range (see &quot;Seabiscuit,&quot; &quot;Pleasantville&quot;), and Kirsten Dunst radiates not only a beautiful physical presence, but the quite seductive beauty of a girl becoming a woman.  Willem Dafoe is the perfect archvillain, although it seems at times he gets too much the best of our hero, but in the end, spidey prevails.  Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris do nicely as Parker's aunt and uncle, and James Franco gives a moody James Dean turn (he played him in a TV movie) as Harry, Dafoe's neglected son.<br />The whole production works mainly because of the heart the cast puts in, and the amazing effects.  Looking forward to catching the sequel.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|Avril is a poser! She is so ugly and can't sing or write music. Have you noticed that in almost ALL of her songs she goes I E I E I? That is sooo stupid! Don't buy this trash if you want to hear good music listen to:<br />*Yellowcard*<BR>*JoJo*<BR>*Christina Agularia*<BR>*Jessica Simpson*<BR>*Usher*<BR>and even Paris Hilton, her new album, I can't wait till that comes out! It's gonna rock!<br />Don't waste your time listing to this! It's crap!
B00005RHGK|5.0|This movie is certainly not ground-breaking (though it could have been).  Like many others have commented, it loses steam mid-way through (after the kids leave the church).  HOWEVER, if you can look past some of the lame 2nd half moments...the last 2-3 minutes of the movie is pure cinematic glory.<br />Ignore all the negative reviews.  Must be by folks requiring the obligatory &quot;happy&quot; ending.
B000023VR6|5.0|There is simply no word to describe this CD, it is the best ever made.  I have spent easily over 500 hrs listening to it, Every song is a hit with the exception of the last one and some of the skits. Forgot about Dre and Next Episode are just the tip of the Ice berg when you really get into the CD you'll see it too.. If u like or have ever owned a rap CD and dont own this one, you are out of your mind
B000002H33|5.0|In a world plagued by nu metal, r&amp;b, rap, pop, and hip hop it's very hard to find good music still. I have 2 choices, search for some decent music or go back to the greatest. Well, this is the greatest. Metallica's master of puppets has received a myriad number of listens and is the epitome of metal and music. Stop searching, and just go back.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|i just wanted to say that this albun rocks and Avril is an awesome singer!
B000003TAR|1.0|In Utero is not challenging in the sense that it's art (because it ain't), it's challenging in the sense that it's hard to fathom how something so calculated &amp; corporate could've gotten past the public's sensibilities to tell whether or not something is genuine. In Utero isn't bold, interesting, or inventive. It's just music that should've been done better. It's so bland and lifeless, but I suppose it wass Cobain's style to bore listeners to death. He's so repetitive! After each &quot;solo&quot; or bridge in every song, you might as well change the track, because something from a previous part is the song is repeated thirty times. All Apologies has &quot;All in all is all we all are&quot; repeated 27 times! Oh, and what's all this supposed controversy I still hear about Rape Me? The song isn't explicit, but then again, it's not enlightening either. Tell me, how is saying &quot;Rape me again and a gain&quot; a &quot;bold anti-rape statement&quot;? From all looks, the song appears to be encouraging it, no matter what &quot;Kurdt&quot; says. But overall, Rape Me is so lyrically and musically tame that Cobain could've called it Rate Me instead, and it wouldn't have made a difference. The only song on In Utero that most people will automatically love is Heart-Shaped Box. They might like All Apologies, that is, if they can stand three straight minutes of Kurt droning &quot;All in all...&quot;. The rest of the songs are throwaways, but worst song has got to be Scentless Apprentice. You can't even make out any of the words, and yet there are so many lyrics to the song!
B0000AQVCL|5.0|this is a great band.but of course at the beginning of every great band's career,they are compared to several bands before them.aerosmith was compared to the stones.van halen was compared to aerosmith.and so on and so on.this doesn't mean they completely jack every riff and lyric off of their influences!now come on,its clear in the midst of pop-punkers and angry nu-metal screamers,these guys have got that rough rock and roll sound that true rock and roll fans wanna hear.sure some songs may have similarities to others we have heard in the past,but it is all their own and they deserve one hell of a pad on the back for this rockin' effort.
0446677450|5.0|Rich Dad Poor Dad offers a shift in attitude. For me, it taught me to take responsibility for myself. It made me realize that no one would take care of my financial future as well as I would.<br />It made me realize that I was my own best boss. I realized that the idea of job security was a farce. So I created my own job.<br />It also made me realize that no one would watch my investments as well as I would. I fired those discount brokers that I used to rely on for financial help and went to a full service broker and it is safing me money.<br />I highly recommend Rich Dad Poor Dad. I also recommend Super Self by Charles Givens a book that teaches you super strategies to  become 10 feet tall and bullet proof. How to maximize effectiveness.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|This cd is packed with some great songs from Avril. All of her songs are from personal experinces. You should really go out and get it. The songs on here are so good you are blown away. This is another great album!
B0000C9ZLD|4.0|I am getting so tired of the endless negative comparisions to the Strokes and the ridicule of their new album. I LOVE Room On Fire. I think Julian Casabancas in amazing and the band as a whole is fantastic. Of course it's not going to be as good as 'Is This It' but I think the album is excellent. 'Repitilia' is completley worth buying the CD for, but 'What Ever Happened?', 'Between Love and Hate', and 'Under Control' are awesome. So what if the guys wear cool clothes and now may be bigheaded, I buy the CDs for the music, thank you very much. And I have no regrets about the purchase of the album whatsoever.
B00004X0Q0|5.0|At The Drive-In is genius.  They're the best there ever was, will be, and seemingly can be.  I still can listen to the same ATDI cd for hours a day and not be tired of it.  It's amazing.  it's a must, no matter what or who you are.  ATDI is a must.
B0001L3LUE|4.0|At 85, McNamara has lost little of his ability to speak articulately and to remember details from conversations that took place more than 40 years ago.  He is a little weaker in drawing meaningful conclusions except for a relatively lame list of &quot;lessons&quot; that he wants to impart to us.  Boiled down to essentials, these lessons (such as &quot;get the data&quot;) are simply warning us to make sure we know what we're doing before we fight a war.  The lessons fail to give any real insight into what actually went wrong in Vietnam and how we might have prevented it.<br />In reading past articles about McNamara, I thought he had become contrite about his role in the Vietnam conflict and would bare his soul to all who would listen.  I'm not saying he SHOULD be contrite, I'm just saying that I thought he was.  But this movie offers no real mea culpa on McNamara's part.  By the end of the film, I had the impression that he was clearly blaming Lyndon Johnson for the escalation of the war.  And, after blaming Johnson, Mc Namara grudgingly takes personal responsibility in that maddening 90's style that says &quot;I'm not responsible, but will accept responsibility.&quot;  Sort of like, &quot;If you want to blame me, go ahead.&quot;<br />The movie is weak only where McNamara is weak: it offers few insights that most of us didn't already have intuitively.  But the movie does reveal riveting aspects of McNamara the man.  It dwells on tight close ups of the face so familiar to those of us old enough to remember when it displayed infinitely more arrogance than it does today.  That ancient face gives away little, though, except for the eyes, which betray the uncertainty and guilt of the man.  Those eyes are fogged with the effects of war and with the self-preserving instincts of the public servant.  But the pain eventually cuts through the fog and envelops both Mcnamara and ourselves.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|I don't see too many movies more than once but in this case it was well worth it. The story keeps moving along at a great pace and I was on the edge of my seat the whole movie wanting to see what would happen next.<br />A couple of people gave this movie an average review, but I just can't see where they're coming from at all! Stop analyzing the movie and enjoy it!<br />This is a must have for my DVD collection and I can't say that very often!
B00005A46T|5.0|This album is purely amazing. Slipknot has dropped the rap numetal-ish sound and become heavier and darker. For some (like me) people will enjoy change, for others (pussy numetal fans who only listen to Linkin Park and Limp Bisket) this will be hell. This whole album is extrememly heavy from start to finish and people who called Slipknot rap metal should really give this new album a listen
B000000OU0|2.0|have the DVD of this show, great show but the CD doesnt have Joe Walsh`s song, too bad or this would have been a better write up.... Eagles were great in there hey day but its over now, pack it in guys..... should have done alot more of the oldies.... new stuff aint cutting the mustard......
B00008WT5C|5.0|Personally, I feel this release and &quot;Powerage&quot; are Angus's finest moments in the Bon Scott era of the band.  Some might argue &quot;Highway To Hell&quot; deserves the honors, but for the sheer sonic ferocity of Angus's fretwork, the buck stops here.  The amps are cranked up to 11 and Angus just doesn't let up.  No power ballads, no acoustic guitar or &quot;keyboards&quot;, just flat out, pedal to the metal, rock 'n' roll. Arguably, AC/DC's rawest &amp; purest &quot;guitar&quot; album.  All killer, no filler.   A must have for any rock fan.<BR>Oh, &amp; by the way...anyone who reviews this album &amp; a George Michael album is no AC/DC fan.  I ain't sellin' my soul just to crack the top 100.
B000024D4R|2.0|One of the great pleasures of all classic Pink Floyd albums is that they all contain an element of humor. &quot;Ummagummma&quot;, &quot;Atom Heart Mother&quot;, &quot;Meddle&quot; and even &quot;Dark Side&quot; and &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; share this quality. No surprise, each is a classic in its own right (although I'm not always so sure about&quot;Wish...).<br />After the success of &quot;Dark Side&quot;, the band seemed to think that they had to get profound, and that just made them dreary. &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; gets away with it, its a Requiem, but &quot;Animals&quot; goes off the deep end and there's no turning back. After that, its terminal dreariness for Pink Floyd. Or so it would seem.<br />FYI - The main songs from both &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; and &quot;Animals&quot; were first performed on Pink Floyd '74 &quot;Dark Side&quot; tour. The tunes &quot;Raving and Drooling&quot; and &quot;You Gotta Be Crazy&quot; became &quot;Animals&quot;. Both were better than the later versions that appeared on the album.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|The Butterfly Effect had an amazing affect on me.  The subject of the movie, the Chaos Theory, is something that a lot of people wonder about without being able to express their thoughts clearly.  This movie clearly expresses the effect of the Chaos Theory with an intense plot.  After leaving this movie everyone I know left the theater in a state of shock.  I cried for hours on end, just because that is how emotional this move made me feel.  It took my sense of reality and question what I thought I knew was real.  All of the actors deliver strong performances through the different situations.  This is a MUST SEE.

B00004Y6O9|5.0|Way back in 1978, a senoir in high school, I was cruising down 87th street in my mom's Mercury station wagon heading to Pot O' Gold to pick up some cold ones.  I switched on the FM to WXRT and a minute later, BAM!!!!  When I first heard &quot;Eruption&quot; and Eddie's intro chords to &quot;You Really Got Me&quot;, I almost had to pull over.  Ted, Ace, Angus, they had nothin' on this guy!  I had never heard anything like it.   The rest is history.  That's a moment in time I will never forget.  Now fast forward over 25 years, &quot;Van Halen&quot;  is still one of the greatest hard rock albums ever; and arguably Van Halen's best.  Along with &quot;Never Mine The Bollocks&quot;, &quot;Cat Scratch Fever&quot; and &quot;Alive II&quot;, this album ruled my turntable 25 years ago and it deserves a place in your cd collection today.  No rock fan can and should be without it.
B0000AMRJC|5.0|This movie is the stepping stone for all other mafia, and drug movies. Al Pacino's performace was excellent, and the storyline was just as interesting. And when you put all the other characters together, you have a film that is complete, and can withstand the test of time.
B00025ETIW|4.0|I must say that after I listened to this CD, I sighed in relief. I was so afraid they were going to end up being turned into a manufactured post-screamo-core-whatever band like Story Of The Year or Finch by their new major label. Luckily, I was wrong. This album, while not quite as edgy or heavy as their debut, is still very filled with catchy hooks, emotional (not emo) and often sadistic lyrics, and overall greatness. While it may be true that they were only seeked out by a major to feed off of bands like Thursday's success, they have managed to stay themselves and hopefully will become popular in their own right, which I feel they are very capable of doing. Great tracks include You Know What They Do To Guys Like Us In Prison, I'm Not Okay, Thank You For The Venom, and Hang 'em High. Also pick up their debut for more MCR greatness.
B00005JMCW|5.0|This is a good, modern twist to the tale of Freaky Friday.  Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan do an excellent job.  Definitely worth watching.

B000062YB1|5.0|After slowing down for South of Heaven, Slayer came back and ripped the world a new A$$ with the excellent album. The Lyrics are Dark, the guitars hit you like a sledgehammer and Dave Lombardo's Drums..man you just gotta here them for yourself. Buy this album, before you buy Divine Intervention.
B000002J1S|5.0|This is probably one of the greatest albums ever made to the music enthusiast and musician, certainly right at the top of all the Genesis/Pete Gabriel efforts.
B0000TB05A|4.0|Camera shots, songs, and sound are amazing.  Is  DTS  Really worth 4 stars
B000002UJQ|5.0|1st off, if you don't own this record, buy it now.  This is simply one of the greatest albums ever created.  Radiohead continues its growth, and creates a masterpiece.  The songs flow into each other, creating a collective work of art.  There is no skipping tracks on this album.  You must listen from start to finish in order to get what the band is trying to accomplish.  I love pretty much everything Radiohead has done, but this album stands far above the others.
B000002JR8|4.0|Great Riffs and Animal Drumming. This is worth the money for the riffs alone.
B0000046KM|5.0|I first bought this when it came out, 12 years ago, and was basically neutral about it.  What a mistake.  What can I say:  I was a callow lad back then, a mere 40-years-old, coming out of a midlife crisis or something.<br />This album is truly special.  From &quot;Here's to Life&quot; to &quot;Estate&quot;, the whole album captures the mood of a late Indian summer day, with full autumn foliage and early evening sun, reflecting off of a pond while two lovers float by in a rowboat.  Whatever your image is of quiet perfection, and in the moment life celebration, that's what this album is all about.<br />A big reason for that is Johnny Mandel, that great songwriter-arranger-producer.  This album is as much his as it is Ms. Horn's, and the balance between the orchestra, Mr. horn's voice and Ms. Horn's piano is just perfect throughout.<br />But give Ms. Horn her due, and then some.  She sings this whole album in a whisper.  Normally, when singers do that, it's because they've lost their pipes to some extent.  Not here.  Ms. Horn sings these songs that way because the songs' musicality demands that type of performance.  Listen to her breath control on &quot;A Time for Love&quot;, for example, and you'll immediately realize she's far from being some &quot;has-been&quot; who is slumming through.<br />I remember years ago Don van Vliet (a.k.a. Captain Beefheart) explaining to a critic, who didn't get his latest effort, just to put the album on his record player and vacuum his living room, over and over again, until he got it.  In a way, that's what I'd recommend you do to this one, too (with your c.d. player!).  Once you realize that this isn't &quot;101 Strings&quot;, you will be swept away by its quiet beauty.  Very highly recommended.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|All I got to say to the jerk off named Pearl Jam's Lion, or some sort of gay fixation like that;  Pearl Jam SUCKS, Rage Against The Machine BLOWS, now you talk about cry babies and whining and bitching about nothing, Pearl Jam is your band.... BUT perhaps I just made your day Mr. Purveyor of musical tasste and self righteous fool.  Ha you seem as if you know good music as if you know just what the hell you are talking about. Slipknot kicks major ass and anyone and everyone who doesn't like that fact should just go jump off a clif, yeah especially you.  <BR>This Album Kicks ass and is far better than anything Pearl Jam, R.A.T.M., or any other band without musical talent, combined could do.
B00003CXCT|5.0|It's interesting what time has done to the SW trilogy.  27 years ago, it was the greatest thing ever. 10 years after that, it was kinda cool, Empire was better than the original, and what was up with the muppets in the 3rd one. 10 years after that we couldn't wait for the prequels, while seeing the originals again on the big screen.  Then, when the former kids, now grown ups, didn't get the exact same goose bumps as 1977, they panned the new ones as junk.  Now, finally, coming to DVD, some don't like the new special effects, some don't like the story of Anakin being connected from the beginning, and some just forgot that they ever liked the original in the first place.  I find all of this interesting as it will become the greatest selling DVD ever, and millions will flock to see the new one next year.  <BR>The SW trilogy, is quite simply the greatest trilogy ever.  Yes, I am biased.   Just my opinion.
B000002H97|3.0|Ok, if your a yuppie and want to buy this album for Enter Sandman and Nothing Else Matters, then go ahead, make MetallicA Richer. But Those two hits aside, this album is solid, if not average, there are some good songs, two or three excellent songs, and A Couple of Fillers. MetallicA made a radio freindly album, it sold a quizillion copies, and they went on to release the worst pile of tripe ever. This is the last time metallica would play reasonable metal..Blah, By Master of Puppets instead.
B0001NBMBC|1.0|Ok I normally like Slipknot, but when I heard this new CD it made me hate them. This has to be their worst CD. Almost all of the songs on the CD sound almost exactly the same and plus they changed their style a bit and they changed it for the worse. I recommened buying their earlier CDs, not this one.
B00003CXCT|3.0|I care if Greedo shoots first. They better have changed it back to the way it supposed to be!!!
0393316041|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. It really gave dimension to a man I've heard so many stories about from my father in law. My husband got a kick out of seeing me read the book too. He had read it a few years ago and after I would finish a chapter he'd want to chit-chat about what I had just read.
B000099T2L|1.0|Even with Ashanti's not so tuned voice, it would be more worth while to buy her cd than to buy this Crap that Beyonce won a million awards for. (So Unfair to the singers who are actually Saying something with their music.) She seems to have no inspiration and is going along with the low of the degrading industry. She is merely another puppet of the industry and her talent shown more through Destiny's Child! That's Real! No Gimmicks! Peace. One.
B00008EY65|5.0|Sixty years ago Hitler's Thule Society performs a dark ceremony intended to summon a terrible demon into this world in order to usher in the apocalypse.  Thwarted by the allies, the dark magicians fail...but not before a child slips through from the demon realm.  An infant demon in which through the care and guidance from those who oppose the evil forces, would become Hellboy, the greatest weapon the forces of darkness ever had to face.<br />It seems Ron Perlman's performance as Hellboy is the closest thing ever to the second coming of Ash.  You know, the guy from the Evil Dead trilogy that just ruled over every single person lucky enough to see him on screen.  No one BUT Ron Perlman could've brought this character to life in such a glorious manner.  However, it is very clear that without Ron Perlman and his clever dialogue, this movie could have been nowhere near as awesome as it turned out to be.  But enough about Ron Perlman, on to Guillermo del Toro.  Superb action director of Mimic and Blade II, del Toro also is known for his moody aptmospheres and gothic style (check out Cronos or The Devil's Backbone).  Hellboy is the ultimate combination of both the intense dramatic action sequences of Blade II and the stylish cinematography of Cronos.  Though not my favorite del Toro film (that would The Devil's Backbone), Hellboy is a lot more than dumb comic book fun if you give it a chance.
B000148KK2|3.0|The first time our group of jazz friends heard Diana live, we all shared the same question: &quot;I wonder what she will sound like in 20 years.&quot; Why?  because her earlier CDs and performances clearly showed what a good student she was of great artists now past -- Ella, Dinah, Sarah, etc.  We wondered what her OWN voice and vision would sound like.  Well kids, here's the first draft.<br />Unlike previous CDs, this one is mostly written and performed by Diana and co-written in parts by her new husband, Elvis Costello. Major themes are her sadness at the recent loss of her mom, and wonder at the new place in life that love has brought her.<br />But this is early, and while it is promising and interesting to hear those previous influences coalesce into a unique voice of her own, she is a work in progress, and this album is not at the pinnacle of composition today.  But it's interesting, sincere, and hers.
B0001WTUH6|4.0|It's obvious that if it wasn't for Blade, this movie would not exist.  It's also obvious that if it wasn't for Blade, I'd have a real problem with vampires and werewolves using guns.  I surprisingly didn't think it was a big deal seeing gunbattles between mythological creatures.  Hell, why not.<br />So, it's vampires versus werewolves in an ultra-gothic cityscape were a petite Kate Bekinsale plays a 'Death Dealer'; essentially a werewolf hunter.  Uncovering a nefarious werewolf plot centered around an oblivious Scott Speedman and an apparent vampire traitor, the Death Dealer attempts to uncover the truth behind her tragic past and the fate of the two species.<br />The Werewolves:  What can I say?  The werewolves were the best part of this film.  Not only do they live underground (...), but they also have the ability to change into their wolf form at will.  No freakin' out at the full moon, here.  They also came across like true warriors fighting for their own personal honor.  I also liked the twist surrounding the Lycan leader that sort of balanced both sides.<br />The Vampires:  You know, I kind of laugh when I think about the motives behind the filmakers regarding how they handled the vampires.  In MY opinion, this movies actually TRIES to make fun of vampires and the whole neo-gothic subculture in general.  Think about it.  What did you see everytime Beckinsale's character stormed into Vampire HQ?  A bunch of guys just lounging around drinking wine and trying to 'out-attitude' everyone else.  In fact, most of the vampires came off as total wankers.  This theory was further confirmed when Viktor was 'awakened'.  This ancient vampire king was a total bad(...).  And he just looks around at his descendents like they're the biggest lot of sissies he's ever seen.  He didn't seem too happy with the current state of modern vampirism.  One of my favorite scenes was when he took on a Lycan bare-handed showing the sissie-vamps how a werewolf is to be dealt with.<br />Underworld makes a strong attempt at neo-noir but falls short in its reliance on pointless action and an even more pointless love interest.  However, there are many redeeming points that beg another viewing.  Check it out.
0385510438|5.0|Enjoyed reading this book.  The best book I've read in awhile and the best Grisham book I'v read in a LONG while. Very interesting with the political and cultural views of the 60's and 70's.
B00028HBKM|4.0|This movie is actually very, very good.  But what kinda disturbs me is how people keep running back to see it.  This is a two hour torture sequence.  How can someone see this five times in the movie theater and proclaim that it, \\"..gets better with each viewing..\\"?  <br />Why the four stars?  Well it IS a very powerful film.  One of the most dramatic I've ever seen.  Mel Gibson should at least be seen as a consummate filmaker for his ability to stir up so many emotions and cause people to look away and cry for thirty minutes after the movie.  This movie pulled all of that off and much more, causing religious, philosophical, and historical debates amongst thousands of moviegoers.  It definately DOES stay with you after the viewing.  The acting is superb all around and the musical score is outstanding.<br />I thought it was unfortuante, however, that there was very little representation of Jesus' actual teachings in the movie.  We are never really shown why we should all care about Jesus getting tortured.  Gibson apparently assumes too much of the audience.  Either that or he didn't want any preaching to get in the way of his visions of gore.  I'm not even a Christian, but Jesus had some pretty noble things to say.  It's a shame that this movie does little to bring those words to the movie-going masses.<br />Oh yeah, the plot:  Jesus dies........That's it.  Two hours of Jesus getting tried and murdered.  Oh, well.
B00005JN0A|4.0|This was very good flick. After watching you could just skip to the nude parts. The nude male beach was disgusting except for the sister in the bikini.
B000063UR2|5.0|The villains in this movie are what steal the show. From the goblin, to the orc, to the swamp troll, and to the unforgettable devil they are what make this movie what it is.<br />Just seeing Tim Curry in that oh so cool satan get up is worth the price of admission for this dvd.
B000063DI8|3.0|As the 80s closed and Grunge loomed in the horizon, many Metal bands were quickly losing the mainstream attention they had been recieving throughout the decade. However, since Maiden never aligned themselves with either the Hair Metal camp or the Thrash Metal camp, they weren't particularly affected by the changing musical climates. However, they decided (for whatever reason, we'll never know) to strip down their progressive Metal approach and go back to the more straight ahead thrashy punk of their early career. Don't get me wrong, this album is certainly not simplistic at all, and guitar-wise it's one of the most dominant of the bunch, but it did sacrifice the very complementing keyboards of their past albums.<br />Regardless of the &quot;black sheep&quot; status of the album, it is clear this is a guitar-oriented Rock N Roll album, and when so it should be listened and reviewed as such. Taking this into acount, No Prayer for the Dying is a strong album. It features plenty of great harmonies and memorable choruses and it should definately please the average Rock/Metal fan that's not expecting a huge magnum opus.. <br />Opener &quot;Tailgunner&quot; is an appropriate track, but it's not very memorable as far as Maiden goes, and is not on the same level as Aces High, Caught Somewhere in Time and the like. &quot;Holy Smoke&quot; is a humorous tune, followed by the intense power-ballad-styled Title Track, one of the finer cuts. Public Enema Number One and Fates Warning are simple, average songs. &quot;The Assassin&quot; you could say is the stinker of the album, the song goes nowhere and simply adds nothing to the album. However, after its lowest point, the closing 4 tracks are all very strong and are on par with the previous Maiden. &quot;Running Silent, Running Deep&quot; is an underrated gem, while &quot;Hooks In You&quot; keeps the high quality of the &quot;Charlotte the Harlot&quot; saga, being the 3rd in the series. Maiden's biggest hit single &quot;Bring Your Daughter... To The Slaughter&quot; is probably the best of the bunch, a classic. Closing epic &quot;Mother Russia&quot; is also a great song and an underrated cut.<br />All in all, No Prayer's downfall is the fact that it's a Maiden album, and it has much too many average tracks and not enough of the Maiden &quot;epic&quot; sound of the previous albums. As a &quot;Return to Roots&quot; album, however, it fares much better than most of its peers and at the end of the day, while it's not increadibly impressive, it will not dissappint the ardent fan.<br />Tailgunner- 8/10<BR>Holy Smoke- 8/10<BR>No Prayer For the Dying- 9/10<BR>Public Enema- 7/10<BR>Fates Warning- 7/10<BR>The Assassin- 5/10<BR>Running Silent, Running Deep- 9.5/10<BR>Hooks in You- 9/10<BR>Bring Your Daughter... To The Slaughter- 10/10<BR>Mother Russia- 9/10
B00003CXI1|5.0|I can remember back when the 1st installment of the Harry Potter series entitled HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERERS STONE, came out in theaters back in November 2001.It still to this very day remains the best installment. I think its because back then everybody wanted to see it. It was just very magical the way it was released because no one really knew the real deal of the h.p. films. This is a great movie if you like h.p.. This is my favorite of the 3. Rent the Sorcerers Stone, and The Chamber Of Secrets, and then go see The Prizoner Of AZkaban.The point of this movie was a wizard whos parents got killed, that lives with his abusive aunt and uncle it a brilliant wizard but he doesnt know that. And then he enrolls in a magical place called hogwarts, a school for witches and wizards. After that things start looking up for him, He makes friends, gets away from his stupid fat uncle, and wrinkly old mean aunt, and joins a place where he is protected and cared for. I strongly reccomend this wonderful film.
0792151712|5.0|I first saw it when I was thirteen and was touched beyond anything I could describe. I'm almost twenty now, and my opinion's unchanged. Nothing could top this movie. The acting's incredible, the music's the very essence of love, and the story is not only haunting, but strong and hopeful despite the tragedy.The magic doesn't fade with the age of the viewer or the size of the screen.
B00005JMFQ|4.0|One word that comes to my mind upon describing Richard Curtis' movie is charming.  His works are always understated but seemed to evoke emotions that other Hollywood movies won't do.  As viewers might have guessed already, this movie is about love; love in all sorts of shapes and forms; love that transcends language, culture, & border; unspoken love, love that is to be confused with lust; puppy love; endearing love, the kind of love that would last a lifetime and beyond; love of the same sex. et cetera.  Richard Curtis attempted to cover as much love as possible in this movie but as he said in the additional features in DVD, the movie length came to a staggering 3 hours 20 minutes.  Naturally, some scenes needed to be edited to much his disappointment as some scenes were his personal favourites & which I personally think should be included in the original movie itself.  Anyway, this is a very subjective view.  There were talks about how the soundtrack came about in the movie and the complexity of matching them with the length of the scenes which almost never worked out as planned.  I needn't say more.  Should you enjoy his previous writings such as Notting Hill, Four Weddings & A Funeral, you would love this movie actually!  All actors and actresses in this movie are brilliant.  Highly recommended.  It encompasses what's truly essential and what's sorely lacking in this world today, LOVE in a very big way.  As John Lennon & Yoko Ono sang, all we need is love.  DVD is definitely a better way to go to appreciate this movie in its full glory.
B00003CXDV|4.0|If you have seen the earlier episodes of &quot;Futurama&quot;, you'll know how effective a cleverly done sci-fi satire can be.<br />Galaxy Quest mines a shuttle-full of sci-fi cliches for its banter, and while I don't remember anything laugh-out-loud rip-roarious, there is a good deal of congenial charm that permeates throughout. Which makes it a perfect family flick to watch on a lazy Sunday afternoon.<br />Apart from the spoof gags, what took me by surprise were the superb special effects, as octopodal aliens morph effortlessly into humans and back again in articulately designed space (the interior of the spaceship itself borrowed its staid cardboard looks from Star Trek of yore, perhaps as an intentional sardonic effect)<br />Overall, the film's affection for its audience (especially those weaned on Lost in Space, or The Next Generation, etc) and for the characters it parodies covers up for the gaping blackholes in its highly implausible and goofy plotline.<br />Great rental, and even a good buy because it lends itself easily to repeat viewing.
B0001GOH6Q|4.0|Nowadays, it's rather common for companies to produce movies about misunderstood children and the plutonic relationships with their parents.  This movie turned it the other way around, of the son refusing to take his father as he was &amp; subconsciously disowned him as none of them shared the same identity.  In the end, as the father was facing his inevitable death from terminal illness, the son finally came to term and reconciled with the demon that haunted him for years.  As viewers sat through the movie, in the end, we would understand the significance of the title, &quot;The Big Fish&quot;.  The bottom line is things are as they are.  As simple as that.  I could emphatise with this movie as I am having the same kind of relationship with my dad.  It's difficult to come to term with the fact that we are so different from one another but in the end, we simply have to learn to let go, clinging for the impossibility that perhaps, my dad happens to pretend to be someone that he's not.  I have always been a fan of Tim Burton's movies as his vision is second to none and distinctly his.  Other than his disappointment in Planet of the Apes, Tim Burton is arguably one of the most creative Director I truly appreciate.  By looking at the additional features in DVD, I could sense that this project is a very personal one for him.  One could also say that this movie is not as dark &amp; as bleak as his previous offerings and perhaps, it has something to do with his new life with Helen Bonham Carter who played different characters in this movie.  One could also catch a glimpse of the writer of &quot;The Big Fish&quot; as an Economics lecturer as a cameo appearance!  Overall, a very heart moving movie with strong performances by Albert Finney, Danny de Vito, Jessica Lange, Ewan McGregor.  Then, there are also three Oscar winners in the production crew such as costume designer, director of cinematography, special effects designer Stan Winston.  Definitely bang for your buck.  Timeless and appealing to all ages.  Highly recommended.
B00007AJGH|5.0|When Roger Rabbitt came out, I was probably too young to ever know what it was. I am sure I saw it many times as a kid, but never saw it as the genius piece of filmmaking that it is. This movie is brilliant in every way, and with the release of the Vista Series DVD I have been reacquainted with it. I am 20 years old now and this is one of my top 5 favorite movies. That is the great thing about this movie, that all ages can enjoy something that this has to offer whether it be the animation sequences or just the fun storyline. I love both.<br />Here is the story. Someone has killed Marvin Acme, owner of ToonTown and Roger takes the heat for it. Of course he was framed but by who and why? Roger seeks the help of Eddie Valiant, a once prominant detective that fell into hard times after his brother was killed by a toon. Thus was his reluctance to help Roger since he was a toon. But he does help Roger, and he must get to the bottom of the mystery before Judge Doom finds and kills Roger by &quot;dipping him&quot;. Eddie feels sorry for the rabbit so he investigates before it is too late, and along the way he discovers more and more about why Acme was killed and that ToonTown itself is in danger. Oh yeah, and Roger was the perfect one to frame because his wife Jessica Rabbit had been seen meeting with Acme before he died. So most people probably know the plot already, but if not it is highly original and entertaining.<br />This masterpiece couldn't get any better treatment than this, a fully loaded 2 disc set sporting both a family-friendly version on disc 1 and enthusiast version on disc 2. There are so many extras that it will take you a long time to see everything. I admittedly have just begun to see the treasures contained within. But it is obvious that the utmost care was taken to give this the fair dvd treatment it deserved--mission accomplished. This is probably my third favorite movie of all-time, and is without a doubt the best mix of live action and animation. Somany great characters appear in this movie such as Bugs and Daffy in the scene where Eddie is falling  and they hand him an anvil instead of a 'chute. It is sheer movie magic, and something I could watch all the time and never get tired of seeing it. Director Zimeckis has done a remarkable job with this film, and we also great great performances from Bob Hoskins (Eddie Valiant), Christopher Lloyd (Judge doom) and pretty much everyone else appearing in the film with the addition of the voices of Roger and Jessica who were terrific. To me this is a perfect movie so if you havent seen it before rent it, and if you like it then buy it. If you are a fan then you must own this dvd. It is truly a great thing and this dvd set presents it in all of its glory, the way it should be done.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Yes, I am a slipknot fan. I enjoy the music they make. I am honestly tired of &quot;true metal fans&quot; grouping one bands fan base into a bunch if idiots, even though most act like a bunch of imbecilic fools. I love all metal, If I want to listen to nu-metal I will listen to korn, slipknot,tool,mudvayne or motograter. If i want some good ole heavy metal then i'd choose 80's metallica, pantera or iron maiden. For death metal i'd choose deicide, cannibal corpse, six feet under, or morbid angel. Black metal (my personal favorite genre) I'd pick, cradle of filth, dimmu borgir, gorgoroth,emperor,mayhem, and old mans child. Melodic death metal I think would be in flames and arch enemy and some great new heavy metal bands are avenged sevenfold, chimaira,killswitch engage,and lamb of god. So really do not judge somebody for one band they like. Now onto the album.<br />  Personally, this is my favorite slipknot album. There are points it doesn't even feel like nu-metal. They have matured and grown. Yet, it seems like most of the angry pre-teens are pissed for the lack of anger and parental advisory sticker. Pitiful.<br /> Prelude 4.0 - 4/5 Really shows emotion Love corey's vocals here<br /> The blister exists - 6/5 One of my favorites on the album percussion in this song is great<br />  Three nil - 5/5 Another favorite of mine I believe this song discusses about the thrashing slipknot takes from &quot;true metal fans&quot;<br /> duality - 4.5/5 1st single from the album, represents this album very well<br /> opium of the people - 4/5 Not great but the guitar work saves it.<br /> circles - 4.5/5 Yes an acoustic song and a good one at that<br /> welcome - 4/5 Definetly a good song but not a great song<br /> vermillion pt 1 - 5/5 beautiful lyrics one of the best<br /> pulse of the maggots - 4/5 good solo, good lyrics could be a single<br /> Before i forget - 10/5 Could be my favorite off of this album. Great chorus<br /> vermilion pt 2 - 5/5 Another acoustic, and A brilliant one at that.<br /> The nameless 4.5/5 Goes from heavy to melodic within seconds original<br /> The virus of life - 10/5 Another one that could be my favorite musically it is a great song and also lyrically it reminds me of prosthetics<br /> danger - keep away 4.5/5 A good closing song.<br />  So, in conclusion you don't have to like a band but I mean christ. Give slipknot a joke it seems almost the cool thing in metal to hate them. Enjoy this album if your open minded enough to buy it you will be rewarded.t one at that.<br /> The nameless 4.5/5 Goes from heavy to melodic within seconds original<br /> The virus of life - 10/5 Another one that could be my favorite musically it is a great song and also lyrically it reminds me of prosthetics<br /> danger - keep away 4.5/5 A good closing song.<br />  So, in conclusion you don't have to like a band but I mean christ.

B0002858YS|5.0|I first heard of The Killers from the single Somebody Told Me. I downloaded it from Itunes months before the release of theri debut album, and hearing that song only made me want to hear more from this band. My anticipation grew until I bought this Tuesday morning, and even before I opened it, I knew it was going to be great. I was neither surprised nor diappointed at what I heard. The Killers present a truly inspired album that rocks and at the same time has a melodic side to it. There is even a song where a choir sings in the background that I think is genius. It sounds really good, as do all the rest of the songs on the album. I have been able to play it on repeat without skipping any tracks, a sign of a great album. Hot Fuss is a great, original sounding album at a time when the great music is getting harder and harder to find. The price of this album is under $10 pretty much everywhere around me, a great price for sure. That is about the price a cd should cost. Think about it this way, you could buy some of the other crap being released at about $15, or you could make what is going to be a great investment of under $10 for one of the year's best albums. It is just that good. Honestly, it is the 2nd best cd I have bought(a close second behind the Beasties' new album) this year and I think this band will make it big very soon. I just hope they continue to make great rock music because they certainly have a lot of talent. Well I have said enough. If you are undecided on this one, listen to it online, and then you know what to do when you are amazed at what you hear.
B00005JMUA|5.0|I was walking through the local Blockbuster one night and as usual nothing new was on the shelf.. So there it was Kill Bill Vol. 1, and to make a long story short i rented it, loved it, and this brings us to this movie, Kill Bill Vol.2. So if you're one of those who think you won't like this movie or Vol. 1, you're probably WRONG. The action and gore was definetly more intense in vol.1 but there was still plenty of action and brilliant dialogue in this conclusion. In particular, the fight scene with darryl hannah was excellent, the training with the karate instructor was to say the least, entertaining, & the close quarters that michael madsen puts Uma in, is something to see. I really enjoyed this movie more than any other Quentin Film, and recommend it to any action, Quentin, karate, swordfighting or just plain asskicking movie fans......
B00000IQC8|4.0|Clerks was a low-budget movie, lacks any special effects and was shot in black and white. That all works perfectly in this case though. Clever dialogue between the main characters and the wide variety of customers they encounter while at work make this movie very worthwhile seeing. No, there is no real plot but it surrounds Dante and Randall at work one day. Dante runs the convenience store on a day when he is supposed to be off, since his boss left town. Randall runs the crappy video store next door, but rarely stays there. He is usually in the store offending customers and it is just hilarious. For anyone who has ever had a job dealing with customers like that, you know how tempting it is to say what you want to the customers. Many humorous things go on in the store such as Randall selling cigarettes to a 5 year old, Dante and Randall attending a funeral only to knock over the casket within 5 minutes, and Dante closing the store to play hockey on the roof. There are so many classic lines in the movie such as the one we all know, \\"I'm not even supposed to be here today.\\" When the two have a conversation about Star Wars with a customer, more like a serious discussion I was cracked up. So you have an everyday situation with believable things that happen between the workers and the customers, witty dialogue with many memorable lines (\\"This job would be great if it weren't for the f****** customers\\"), and to top it off a few great scenes with Jay and Silent Bob. This movie is not centered on those two, but Dante and Randall and the everyday battle with customers that will crack you up for sure. This is just an ordinary low-budget movie made great by the dialogue, but at the same time it is what a movie should be---entertaining. Kevin Smith has made some great movies, but this one is my favorite. It is an amazing movie considering Smith worked with so little money to make this great film. So you should watch this no matter what at least once. If you work in a store likeDante or a video store like Randall, I'm sure you will appreciate the humor in their way with saying what they want to customers even if it is offensive. It is a normal and believable situation that doesn't fail to entertain, and has everything you want to say to a customer but can't.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Don't listen to the dumbass haters, this is actually a really great album!  If you listen to it, you'll realize how many great songs there are.  Form your own opinion, don't pay attention to losers who haven't even listened to it, but simply have hatred for the artist.
B00006879E|3.0|You know how you can hear the making of a good band, but know they arnt quite there yet? Thats what Maroon 5 gave me. This album SOUNDED like a freshman effort. Not to say that it wasnt good, but if in 10 years, they re-recorded it, I bet it would sound a lot fuller. They need time to season.<br />The soul isnt there yet. Give them a couple more albums. They are getting there. Once they get off the pop band wagon that got them where they are, (as with many other bands) and focus not on catchy tunes but on the art of their craft, then man watch out!<br />These guys are gonna make me so happy one day.
B000021Y7X|5.0|First I saw the video on MTV. I bought the record, then the CD. Finally I found the VHS and I thought I had everything. Then they released the anniversary edition CD and finally I bought the DVD. If only I would have been able to actually attend. <br />Need I say more. The music is fantastic, and the presentation is entertaining. This is by far, the best concert video I've ever seen, and if your not already a Talking Heads fan, you will be after you watch and listen.
B00003003R|5.0|While this double cd set may be a said memory of a band that imploded under pressure, it is also a thrill ride, hightlighting a band that dominated their time.  While it was recorded across the world, geffen did a great job of making it feel like one big show.<br />Disc 1 kicks off with Nightrain, a fast, adrenaline rush thatwill get you jumping around the house. Next comes a AFD classic, Mr. Brownstone. Its an average version of the song, but the highlight is the 2 minute soundclip of Axl trying to get the crowd to back up  after the song. Next comes another AFD classic, Its so Easy, which is a thumping reminder of the bands past. Next comes the <BR>GnR trademark song, Welcome to the Jungle, featuring a heart pounding intro by Axl. Next comes a underrated song sung by Izzy, Dust n Bones, which is by far better than the recording. Next comes the song My Michelle which on record was a dark song, but live seemed not quite so intimidating.  Then you get You're Crazy which features a monotone sounding Axl.  After that you get one of Gnr's most controversial songs, Used to Love Her, with a funny yet disturbing intro. Then comes the only Lies hit, Patience, with a very excited crowd that sings along louder than Axl. Next is It's Alright as an okay intro to the monster hit, November Rain, which ends CD 1 on a nice note.<br />Disc 2 starts with a boring version of Out Ta Get Me, then a better than recording version of the ever ironic song, Pretty Tied Up. Next is the happy song, Yesterdays.  Then you get the low point of the set, Move to the City, which includes a 5 minute solo section by the unecessary horn section. After that the rest of the cd is amazing, which is the reason of my rating. You get You Could Be Mine, Rocket Queen, Sweet Child O' Mine, Knockin on Heavens Door, Dont Cry, Estranged and Paradise City.<br />While disc 1 is aimed for the hardcore fan that knows the songs that werent hits, disc 2 is aimed for everyone with a run of monster hits. Any Gnr fan, hardcore or casual should definetely pick up this set, which hightlights the last great rock band, Guns N' Roses.
B000000WJK|2.0|This album could have been a good one if it weren't for two things. Number one, the sound quality of A Storm In Heaven is just plain horrible. Ashcroft's vocals are just about nonexistant, as McCabe's guitars steal all of the glory throughout nearly the entire recording. Even some of the guitar work in this album is atrocious. As one reviewer said, parts of this album sound like a 'bad bootleg'. Another reason why ASIH gets two stars is because of the poor songwriting by Ashcroft. Before I bought this album I was expecting to hear thought-provoking, heartfelt lyrics and some decent guitar work. Well, the guitars deliver somewhat, but there were no lyrics that brought out any emotions whatsoever. &quot;I must be feeling alone...I talked to God in a phonebox on my way home. I told you my answer...I left you my dreams on your answering machine.&quot; These are the kind of lyrics that you'll find on Urban Hymns(check out A Northern Soul too). Giving this album two stars is very generous.
B00006AG5N|5.0|A wonderful cd with some of the greatest songs ever recorded.Elvis had an incredible talent that deserves more recognition. Long live ELVIS!!!
B00005ASHM|4.0|&quot;Pet Sounds&quot; is regularly considered to be one of a handful of truly great rock albums.  Almost always making the top 10 of such lists, and often the top five, it is frequently placed with &quot;Revolver&quot; and &quot;Sergeant Pepper.&quot;  As such it has a place in the critical pantheon that patently above such works as &quot;Synchronicity,&quot; &quot;Hounds of Love,&quot; &quot;Peter Gabriel (Melted Face),&quot; &quot;The Unforgettable Fire,&quot;  &quot;Purple Rain,&quot; &quot;Under the Pink,&quot; and &quot;The Wall&quot;.  Whatever the virtues of these albums they cannot enter the charmed circle &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; inhabits.  Paul McCartney has generously praised the album and said that &quot;God Only Knows,&quot; is his favorite song.  When I first heard the album in the mid-nineties my thought was that this was an album that had only truly great song (&quot;God Only Knows,&quot;), two very good songs (&quot;Wouldn't it be Nice&quot; &quot;Sloop John B&quot;) and ten songs that were indistinguishable from each other.  Having relistened to the album I have modified my opinion.  There is now one great song, three very good songs (including &quot;I'm Waiting for the Day&quot;) and nine songs that are indistinguishable from each other.<br />In my honest opinion, &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; shares with &quot;Nevermind&quot; the distinction of being the most overrated album in the pop canon.  In many ways it is no doubt a considerable technical achievement, well deserving of McCartney and George Martin's praise.  Yet it also shows the same vices that have made McCartney's post Beatles career so disappointing:  sentimentality and a lack of intelligence.  Comparing it to Revolver points out its weaknesses very quickly.  Obviously on one hand you have the Beatles, who are after all the Beatles, and on the other hand you have Brian Wilson and his band of complacent twits.  The Beach Boys are vocally much less interesting than the Beatles, and they simply cannot register the same range of emotion or concern.   They have almost no sense of humor.  Their songs simply do not have the same kind of range (&quot;Pet Sounds&quot; discusses love, growing up, alienation and sailing.  &quot;Revolver&quot; discusses love, dying, happiness, sailing underwater, drug addiction, madness, the British Taxation system, and the Tibetan Book of the Dead.)  The Beatles, and the artists mentioned above have a real sense of detail, and a real sign that they live in a particular time and place.  &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;, by contrast, is timeless only in the sense that it is a product of California suburbia, where the political, economic and racial heterogenity of the United States has been literally bleached out and denied.  <br />The virtue of &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; does not really lies in its technical sheen.  What makes &quot;God Only Knows,&quot; &quot;Wouldn't it be Nice&quot; and &quot;I'm Waiting for the Day,&quot; effective is the contrast, or the dialectic, between their technical sheen, their apparently simple lyrics, their innocence (aided by their somewhat high voices) and the deep feelings that lie underneath the song's surface, whether it is loss (&quot;God Only Knows&quot;), desire (&quot;Wouldn't it be Nice,&quot;) and jealously (&quot;I'm Waiting for the Day.&quot;)  There is nothing particuarly original about the subjects themselves.  The problem for the Beach Boys was not that they could not maintain this tension, but that they did not want to maintain it.  Their success fundamentally come from their picture of privileged hedonism, and they certainly did not want to go any further.  And the problem with &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; is that in the other songs the technical sheen and ostentatious innocence swamps the feelings they might have.  To say that &quot;That's not me,&quot; &quot;I Know there's an answer,&quot; &quot;I just wasn't made for these times,&quot; and &quot;Caroline No,&quot; deal with maturity isn't that much of acompliment.  There are a whole host of popular musicians (one thinks of Ray Charles) who were grown up to begin with.  And there is the element of repetition.  The instrumentals &quot;Let's go away for a while,&quot; and &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; need something more to shake off their resemblance to elevator music.  Any song that reminds you of an agonizingly pointless sunny Sunday afternoon has to lose marks.  And while other albums have echoes it is striking how similar the songs on &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; resemble each other.  Nobody confuses any of the songs on &quot;Sergeant Pepper&quot; with any of the others.  But there is the narcoleptic dirge on &quot;You Still Believe in Me,&quot; &quot;Don't Talk (put your head on my shoulder),&quot; and &quot;I just wasn't made for these times&quot; (before it returns for an encore with &quot;Caroline No&quot;).   Likewise, there are the similarities between &quot;That's not me,&quot; &quot;I Know there's an answer,&quot; and &quot;Here Today.&quot;   There is a kind of blandness, a lack of energy, a simplicity that collapses into banality.
B0000A02TZ|1.0|I refuse to sit through advertising which can not be skipped on a DVD. And while I love this movie, I guess I will have to stick to my VHS tape. Too bad that Universal thinks they can force us to watch advertising. The worst part is, if I get a phone call half way through the movie and leave, and want to start the movie later, I have to watch the same annoying advertising again. Anytime the DVD player is turned off, it forces the advertising to be watched again. How about having those ad's as a special feature for those who want to watch them? Why force everyone to watch them?? I will boycott anything from Universal because of this.
B000008JUM|4.0|Cole Porter (1891-1964) was among the closeted gay artists of his era--and the idea of collecting modern versions of his work for release as an AIDS fundraiser was truly inspired.  But the hard truth is that few singers have the vocal skills that a Porter song demands, and the resulting RED HOT + BLUE is an extremely inconsistent mix of the truly sublime and the truly dire.<br /><br />On the sublime side, the Neville Brothers offer a truly elegant reworking of the seldom performed but incredibly beautiful \\"In The Still of the Night,\\" infusing the delicate melody with their own unique multicultural sound to tremendous effect.  Fine Young Cannibals also do a remarkable version--and one that would have been sure to bring a wicked grin to Porter's face--of the often censored \\"Love for Sale.\\"<br /><br />Many other selections are equally effective.  Although U2's version of \\"Night and Day\\" takes some getting used to, it is worth the effort and becomes unexpectedly haunting.  Sinead O'Connor and K.D. Lang score memorably with \\"You Do Something To Me\\" and \\"So In Love;\\" and Annie Lennox offers the single finest version of \\"Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye\\" I have ever heard.<br /><br />But the rest of the thing ranges from the merely \\"interesting\\" to the flat out awful.  Neneh Cherry is one of the few rap artist I actually like--but she would have done better to take fewer liberties with \\"I've Got You Under My Skin,\\" and frankly both Tom Waits and Salif Keita should have stayed in bed on the days they were scheduled to record their versions of \\"It's Alright With Me\\" and \\"Begin the Beguine.\\"  Indeed, Keita's \\"Begin the Beguine\\" is easily the single most awful version of any Porter song by any artist that I've ever heard.<br /><br />The rest of the selections are in the \\"also ran\\" range, which is to say not memorably bad but not memorably good either.  At times this is a major disappointment--when you consider that Andy Bell of Erasure has a remarkable voice it seems a pity to have reduce him a dance-track-ish \\"Too Darn Hot.\\"  Perhaps the single greatest disappointment in the collection is Debbie Harry, who one would expect to work wonders with a classic Porter tune... but who finds herself paired with Iggy Pop in a throw-away version of \\"Well, Did You Evah,\\" which can only be described as a humiliating miscalculation and a true waste of talent.<br /><br />Still, in spite of a host of misfires and just flat out bad ideas, when it's good RED HOT + BLUE is exceptionally good--and enough so to make up for the duds and bring the whole thing in at a solid four stars.  Just bear in mind that you'll probably want to make your own edits!<br /><br />GFT, Amazon ReviewerDarn Hot.\\"  Perhaps the single greatest disappointment in the collection is Debbie Harry, who one would expect to work wonders with a classic Porter tune... but who finds herself paired with Iggy Pop in a throw-away version of \\"Well, Did You Evah,\\" which can only be described as a humiliating miscalculation and a true waste of talent.

0887307280|5.0|For over a decade now I've been recommending this book (and its earlier edition) to wannabe entrepreneurs that post to the four business newsgroups I co-moderate.  Those being misc.entrepreneurs.moderated, misc.business.moderated, misc.business.marketing.moderated, and misc.business.consulting.<br />This book's most important contribution is talking about what it takes to start and run a successful business AND who should do so.  I keep telling newsgroup posters to be real honest with themselves on whether they're a &quot;Technician&quot;, &quot;Manager&quot;, or &quot;Entrepreneur&quot; so they can save themselves a lot of grief.  The rest of the book helps develop the right mindset for starting up and running a business.  Have a goal.  Aim for that goal.  Systematize your business.  Delegate.  Have an exit plan.<br />The only thing that could have made this book better was if it had recommended wannabe entrepreneurs to go and talk to business people that are currently running a business they'd like to run.  Naturally, not talking to one's future competition, but going out beyond your sales territory and where it overlaps your competition and talking to the business people there.  Anyway...<br />This is a great book and I highly recommend it.
B0000072KY|5.0|It is a much harsher album compared to the last two albums. This one does contain the better lyrics in it, but I just think &quot;Nevermind&quot; is slightly better. The songs are:<br />Serve the servents: This is a good opener. There are some good verses, but a not-so-good chorus. All about his dad. 4/5<br />Scentless apprentice: Weird lyrics. It's one of the heavier tracks on the album. Massive shouting in it. 4/5<br />Heart-shaped box: Probably the best track on the album. Great lyrics and an unbeatable chorus. San very emotionally. 5/5<br />Rape me: Another good track. The intro sounds a bit like the intro to &quot;Smells like teen spirit&quot;. You think this is goanna be a soft song, but it gets louder. 5/5<br />Frances farmer will have her revenge on Seattle: This is a very catchy song. It's just a bit too long. 4.5/5<br />Dumb: Very relaxing. 5/5<br />Very ape: Quite a fast-paces song, and it's too short (1:55). The guitars sound amazing. They make a sort of crunchy sound. 3.5/5<br />Milk it: This a favourite. A very underrated song. It's one of those songs that's haunting and soft in the verses but gets louder in the chorus, with Kurt screaming. 5/5<br />Pennyroyal tea: This is another good track. I think this chorus is very catchy. 5/5<br />Radio friendly unit shifter: The chorus is good, one of the more faster songs. 3/5 <br />Tourettes: Very short and very fast. It can be quite hard. Contains really long shouts. 4/5<br />All apologies: This is quite good when it starts off, but it does get worse. It's another relaxing track. 4/5<br />Gallons of rubbing alcahol through a strip (extra track): Very silent on the first verse, but the singing gets louder. This song is very long (7:33). Once this song reaches the end it gets slightly better, but it's still quite a boring song. 2/5<br />So, that's basically Nirvana's last album, and probably their best acomplished. I just think &quot;Nevermind&quot; is a tiny bit better.
B0000D96NW|5.0|I came onboard the MH boat by &quot;The Burning Red&quot;, although it was a good album, I never really &quot;latched&quot; on.  Then came this.  This album is by far one of the best metal (not NU-metal) albums to bless my ears with its beautiful sounds.  This album has made MH my favorite band, hands down.  Pure, raw, and addictive, this album will live in metal infamy.  To all those claiming this is &quot;Nu-metal&quot;, you have no appreciation for REAL music.  This is a masterpiece, and I must admit that this album has graced my life with its presence.  Because of this album, I now have a much higher appreciation for all of the other MH albums.  This band is the Beethoven of metal.  So, please, do youself a favor and buy it, you will not regret it.
0385336810|5.0|This was a great book! If you like silly, funny stories, this one is for you! Sophia Kinsella continues her creative writing in this new book.  Great characters, a story that we could only hope would never happen to us.  If you liked the shopaholic series, then this is a must read.  A great summer book to enjoy!
B0000634EV|3.0|Having fallin in love with NOLA, I was extremely excited about another DOWN album.  But, this album just didn't live up to par.  Although the album is a good album, it is nowhere hear the caliber of NOLA.  If you were hoping for another NOLA, just keep hoping, cuz this aint it.  BUT...this album is still a good ablum.  If I had never known about NOLA, I would say taht this album is extremely entertaning and sound worthy, but no comparison to the last.  Buy this CD becuase it is good, but not because it is DOWN.
B0000630YA|4.0|This is Alice's first solo album without his backing band. While it not be as heavy as his albums with the band, it's still weird and wacky. Some songs still bang their heads just as hard as his previous stuff. A lot of the stuff is really good and weird. Like those three songs, Steven, Years Ago, and The Awakening. They are about some little boy who goes insane or something. This is a really good album, but not as good as the albums with his band.
B0001Z363W|5.0|This CD is named perfectley. After a long night of partying &amp; jamming you can sit back &amp; chill on the tunes so you can do it all over agian . I have read alot of negative stuff about this album but I personaly love it ,I feel that variety is the spice of life .Dont get me wrong I love the hard stuff too . I find it mind blowing the way Zakk shifts gears , very few pepole can do this . I feel he is a true musician heart &amp; soul . Many pepole compare this to book of shadows the music is very diffrent . This is not book of shadows but same caliber of greatness .
B0001ZX0PG|4.0|MOVIE: This was a favorite come the time of the Oscars and really showed some talented actors doing their thing. Personally I felt that this movie was a well made film but I think it got more praise than it deserved.  I'm really glad that it only won its Oscars for its acting because when it came down to the story it was just an above average crime drama.  What makes the movie above average is that it doesn't just deal with the \\"whodunnit\\" factor, it really incorporates the characters into the story. There is so much character development that it really shows the audience the true darkness of human nature.  Everybody was praising Clint Eastwood for this movie when all the credit should go to the actors and actresses in the picture.  Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, and Marcia Gay Harden (I still can't figure out how someone can get a name like that) all gave stellar performances. I really feel that it was overrated.  It is one of the greatest crime dramas out there its just that so is Se7en, and so is Life of David Gale.  A great movie that had so much support from the critics that it ended up being loved by everybody.<br />VIDEO: Very nice transfer from warner that really handles the dark scenes very well.<br />AUDIO: The 5.1 mix is a little soft in places but overall decent.<br />PACKAGING / EXTRAS: This review is pertaining to the 3 disc edition.  The Digipak comes in a slip sleeve and folds out into three segment. In the center you have the feature disc, and on the right you have the other two discs overlapping each other in a design that was done with the Pink Panther Film Collection. The left flap is just printed cardboard.  Disc 1 just has a commentary. Disc 2 has a platter of really \\"movie buff\\" extras.  First up is the standard making of, a 23 minute featurette called Mystic River- Beneath the Surface.  Next is an 11 minute segment titled Mystic River- From Page to Screen, mainly dealing with the actors.  Then there are The Charlie Rose Show Interviews. Eastwood's interview is 42 minutes, Robbins' is 50 minutes, and Bacon's is 19 minutes. These are not bull interviews but real good conversations about the movie. Disc 3 is the soundtrack to the film, which I was not a fan of. I really think Eastwood shouldn't have composed the soundtrack because I felt that it was too unemotional.  Maybe he wanted it that way so that all the emotion could come from the fine acting, but I just felt that it didn't support the tone of the movie as well as it could have. Overall it's a 2-disc version with the soundtrack attached. Definately worth buying versus the single disc edition. Plus you don't want another pesky WB snapper case would you?<br />MOVIE SCORE: (* * * *)<br />DVD SCORE: (9 / 10)nterview is 42 minutes, Robbins' is 50 minutes, and Bacon's is 19 minutes.

B0001LJC2K|5.0|I love this album, the pianowork is beautiful and the vocals are just really really cool.  This music is so epic, it is like being carried away into one great big giant rock opera fantasy!  But please everyone, quit comparing them to everyone, just let them be muse...I absolutely hate when people compare bands like you freaks...
1400032717|5.0|This book is such a wonder that it's hard to refrain from making some postivie comments about it.  Your friends might even get a few extra hugs after you've read it -- it's just a rare, loving, and even fun, life-giving experience.<br />I decided to add a big YES to the other comments posted here after reading a goodly number of them.  Obviously recommended on \\"the pleasure principle\\", I see many readers also offer insights to various elements in \\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time\\".<br />I'm guessing these \\"reviews\\" are assuming one of the riveting facts about the work -- it is unique, unlike anything you are liable to come across elsewhere.  The subject matter may appear elsewhere, but the soul of the writing is extraordinary and wondrous.<br />I wrote a review at a opinions site called MouthShut.com -- perhaps you will see my review there.  For a comprehensive introduction to \\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time\\" see the comments (...) I came here to read what others had to say about the book.  I couldn't refrain from recommending it after I got so far with reading their comments.

6301607929|5.0|I saw PICNIC during its release in 1956 in India when I was in<BR>school. I was crazy about English films and never missed a good<BR>film.one of my class mates saw the film before me and remarked<BR>about the energetic dancing of Holden as spellbinding.I was not<BR>that keen in the beginning to see the film due to its title which meant lightweight and fun. But when I saw the film the experience was tremendous, I had just seen a masterpiece. William Holden and Kim Novak were just outstanding. Holden<br />brought a breath of fresh air as soon as he appeared, and Kim<BR>Novak was not just a small town beauty queen, she oozed raw sex<BR>and hidden desires exposed to the full by carefree but passionate William Holden. Although, without doubt the highlight of the film was the picnic and the dancing where all the principal players of the film are envolved emotionally and the finale to the story builds up, there other memorable scenes notably the swing scene where Holden gets hold of the swing where Novak is sitting, he begins playing with it unintentionally and realises for the first time that he has fallen for the fiancee of his best friend. Then there is that passionate scene beside the waterfall where both Holden and Novak admit their love for each other and kiss intensly, Holden with torn shirt. After this Holden runs and catches the running train and finally Novak follows him, her true love in the Greyhound. The execution of all these scenes and the whole story is nothing less than perfect. James Wong Hoe's technicolor photography is outstanding. Needless to say I have seen this film many times since and found it always charming.
B0002858YS|5.0|this album is simply awesome. it's the best debut i've heard since the shins' \\"oh inverted world\\", and just like that album, i can't stop listening to it. sure, they sound like a thousand other bands, but the important thing is they've got incredible songs that are truly their own. just about every track kills, from the all-important suck-you-in opener \\"jenny was a friend of mine\\", to the monumental \\"all these things that i've done\\" (one of the most thrilling songs i've heard since pulps' \\"common people\\"), this album is bursting at the seams. yes, it does drop off a bit in the second half, but only in comparison to the flawless first half. <br />one thing that has me most excited about the killers is that they're very prolific already, and they've got just about the strongest b-sides since pavement's glory years, a good sign that these guys are the real deal. hunt down those non-album tracks (there's 9 of them!) if you can.<br />so yeah... a genuinely exciting album from the first rock revival band to live up to the hype since the white stripes. and they're only going to get better.
0312995423|3.0|Dan Brown is a great writer with a knack for suspense, and puts together great stories. With that in mind, I don't understand the uproar over the lack of research in this book. All three of his latest works, which I have enjoyed very much as works of fiction, have been assembled in such a way to create the appearance of truth, but in reality they are just stories. Clever, yes. Fun, yes. Are there mistruths and mistakes? Yes. But they are fiction, as Dan Brown himself claims, and so is &quot;Digital Fortress&quot;. Anyone who has studied world history or the Catholic Church knows that &quot;Angels and Demons&quot; or &quot;The DaVinci Code&quot; has just as many holes. It's fiction. &quot;Digital Fortress&quot; is no exception. Enjoy this book. It's worth it.
B000089RVX|5.0|Evanescance is awesome. I have so many nice things to say about Evanescance. It is the best Cd I ever purchased. every song is awesome. Amy Lee deserves a lot of credit having written lots of the vocals and lyrics to a lot of the album, and Ben Moody, although no longer a member of the band, having written lyrics and played guitar, and David Hodges on the piano. Track 9, HEllo, was a good example of his skills and the string arrangements and Amy's vocals. It was all amazing.The choir added a nice touch to nost of the album as well. The string parts (yes there are string parts in this album) are amazing too.<BR>          <BR>  Evanescance is worth every penny i will ever spend on them. Money well spent. THanks guys.
B00008CLOA|5.0|i really love this album which i have had in cd format since 10 years and since sounds great as it was 30 years back this should be the first album should possess before starting his music collction.
0440237688|5.0|Jonas lives in a totally safe and predictable world. The Elders make all the community's decisions, and every aspect of life is governed by detailed rules. One of those rules says that when an Eleven becomes a Twelve, childhood ends. That's about to happen to Jonas. He is nervous, even apprehensive, but he is also eager because at the transition ceremony he will receive his lifetime assignment. More years of schooling lie ahead, and for now he'll continue to live with his family; but the day after the ceremony he will also begin training for his new role as a contributing adult member of the community. Will he become a Nurturer like his father? Will he be an attendant at the House of the Old? An instructor for Threes, who need to learn the precise use of language? He can't guess. But no one could have guessed the assignment that he actually gets.<br />Jonas will become the community's Receiver of Memories. He will carry what everyone else has forgotten long ago - the knowledge of what life was like before climate control, medicine to repress desire, and all the rest of the present world's safeguards were introduced. He alone will know what it's like to feel unrestrained emotions, and he alone will be capable of making genuine choices. He will have great honor, but he will bear a burden the rest of the community can't even imagine.<br />What is safety, and what does it really cost? This is a surprisingly original take on a familiar speculative fiction device, that of the future community in which every aspect of an individual's life is rigidly controlled. Lowry's young hero discovers his world's secrets gradually and believably, taking the reader with him on a journey that forces the boy raised without choices to make decisions almost beyond imagining.<br />--(...)
B000089RVX|5.0|I was initially intrigued by the cover of this CD (the face popping out of the silver-blue lighting), but held off purchasing until I'd heard more about this new group. Then, a friend let me listen to a couple of tracks, and I was hooked. The music is excellent, and done with passion and skill. The combination of heavy guitar and soaring vocals works. I wish half the CDs I owned held my interest this well.
B0000039PW|5.0|All of the songs on this cd are perfect!!!!!!!
0060920084|1.0|Bryson continually bemoans the obesity of Americans.  Continually.  It gets rather tiresome.  While I wouldn't label Bryson as obese, I certainly wouldn't say that he was all that fit.<br />The book gave me the impression that he spent little more than an hour in each of the towns he visited which is hardly enough time to form an impression of any value.  Gas station here, fat woman there.<br />This isn't traveling, Bryson.  It is simply driving and stopping for gas.
B0000C9JFO|5.0|The film gives an overview of what makes the Eramus project (or any exchange program) so special. It's not about the partying but its about having the possibility of discovering yourself far from your natural environment/country. It`s also tolerance and how cultures can actually melt. The movie is probably more for an European audience, but the underlying meaning is UNIVERSAL.
B0001UL7RY|3.0|her sophmore albumn isnt as mature as it was said to be, she's 19 and her lyrics and still rather simplistic, her singing range is mediocre and though her songs are less pop, they still maintain the pop edge that i found to become annoying after a while. nobodys home and forgotten would likely be the best songs. the real plus to the cd were the pictures, sad to say, on a plus they had an edge and though the songs are still immature, its a step up from her last albumn, but be warned, you might hate it after an hour of listening to it. with lyrics such as-&quot;this is when i bite my nails and clean my room when all else fails-i think its time for me to bail.&quot; not the most depth...
0380778556|5.0|On the surface, with its feminine title & book cover, Rebecca may appear to be a romance novel that begs the question: Is this really a classic? Well, upon further review after reading every page(and enjoying every one no less), I can irrefutably promulgate that Rebecca is, indeed, a classic which should doubtless be read -- and enjoyed -- by both sexes.<br />Rebecca is nothing short of an archetype of the mystery/suspense genre.  Written in 1938, it quickly became an instant bestseller -- and for good reason.  In the paradoxical world of Manderley, where you feel a certain awe due to the fictional mansion's opulence and wonder coupled with a peculiar eerie malaise, Du Maurier has created a most bizarre character in the house itself.<br />Her masterful imagery, deft characterization of the new Mrs. de Winter, the enigmatic maxim, the creepy but ingeniously crafted Mrs. Danvers, the decadent Jack Favell, the incorrigibly pompous Mrs. Van Hopper, the tacitly loyal Frith, and, of course, the character that, although deceased from the beginning, eerily pervades the already cryptic landscape of Manderley, as well as the book itself, from page one - Rebecca.  Rebecca exists as an inscrutable mystery that begs us to press on and uncover the hidden truth as we enjoy superb prose all the while -- truly a most captivating read.
B000148KK2|1.0|Diana  stinks. In fact she looks like she is smelling something stinky when she sings ! Check it out ... Seriously , Diana is a lucky woman.<BR>She's sings ok but her little piano playing is pitiful. She has about 3 licks that she uses over and over. Her compositions are mediocre, without any substance or form. They sound like tunes written by a  bad musician in high school. Her piano was actually better when she just stayed within her tinky tinky limitations, but now, she seems to want to be a player.... too late Diana, you should have practiced when you were young. Why don't you hire a real piano player ?
6305075492|5.0|The cabinet was  one of the most remarkable films of the german expressionism.<br />The bitter gaze about a hollow-eyed sleepwalker (Cesare) who commits murders underthe influence of Dr. Caligary was a clear methapor about what's going on in that dark times. After watching this film , please get the famous Edward Munch's painting titled The scream and establish the underground roads.<br />The hopeless and the horror are depicted in this movie with a clear message behind the score. Beware about the hidden demons in your mind .<br />Twelve years before the rise of Hitler, Caligari means obviously the word hypnotist who changes to Cesare in a murder; the anlogy is more than obvious. Don't you?<br />The world evidently was in another mood , but this warning call from a bizarre film concerned to a few people. Today we are capable after eighty five years , of feel the message.<br />Robert Wiene established a real pattern around the new possibilities of expression for the movies. He made The hands of Orlac also with Conrad Viet a legendary actor , and won too with that.<br />But Caligari shocked the destiny of a whole generation of directors (Howard Hawks in Scarface , for instance , Freaks of Tod Browning , Edgar Ullmer, Andre de Toth , James Whale's Frankenstein , and more recently Werner Herzog , Roger Corman or Lars von Triers ) to name just a few , but specially to a young english film maker called Alfred Hitchcock and another giant Orson Welles . If you remember the chase sequence in The third man under the streets of Vienna , or countless sequences employed as dramatic visuals resources and narrative devices of the English master , remember that Caligari was the sparking light.<br />A cul movie and one of the pioneers jewels of the  german expressionism!
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Although Avril Lavigne has lost some of her &quot;punk&quot; image, I like her music off of &quot;Under My Skin&quot; better than &quot;Let Go&quot;.  She's lyrically grown, yet, her lyrics still apply to teenage girls wheather they're about keeping your virginity, (Don't Tell Me) relationships,(Fall to Peices) breakups, (My Happy Ending)or just about how to live life (Freak Out, Who Knows?).  There's something for everyone her lyrically.  Songs like &quot;My World&quot;, &quot;Things I'll Never Say&quot;, and &quot;Anything but Ordinary&quot; captured most of the sound on &quot;Let Go&quot;.  But on Avril's sophmore attempt, songs that posses the sounds of &quot;Losing Grip&quot; and &quot;Unwanted&quot; take over.  &quot;Forgotten&quot; is perhaps the darkest song on the album, obviously written about a break-up.  The highlights of &quot;Under My Skin&quot; are &quot;He Wasn't&quot;, with a sound similar to &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot;, &quot;Nobody's Home&quot;, which has shown Avril's growth lyrically, &quot;Forgotten&quot;, which has an awsome yet eerie sound, and &quot;Who Knows?&quot; and &quot;Freak Out&quot;, which both have a Carpe Diem attitude.  All the songs are an improvment since Avril Lavigne's last disk.  If you saw her as a poser before, give her a second chance by trying &quot;Under My Skin&quot;.  It's worth every penny. :)
B000003CMB|5.0|The Allman Brothers were one of the best southern rock/blues bands of all time. Many people were *Dead Heads*...my friends used to call me an *Allman Head*.<br /><br /> If you buy only one Allman Brothers album in your entire lifetime, this is the one. It is a live album that was recorded at the Fillmore...what more can one say? It is classic Allman with the band's legendary and lengthy instrument solos. It is an album that you will carry around with you wherever you go. I always say that I have a list of albums that I'd have to have with me if I were ever stranded on a desert island. This one is at the top of the list. You will continually play it.<br /><br /> It will remind you of those great accoustic days where people literally danced on tables and GOT DOWN!!! What a great reminder of days gone past. Do yourself a favor and add it to your collection. You will never tire of it.
B00013RC9I|1.0|I bought this CD from Amazon and I think the music is<BR>pretty good, that is, if you can play it!<br />This CD is copy protected.  It didn't play on my computer<BR>and I had to the use paper clip to manually force the<BR>CD out of the computer drive.  I didn't play on my boom<BR>box either.<br />I listen to almost all my CD's on my MP3 player.  I'm<BR>not a pirate, I pay for everything I listen to but I<BR>refuse to let the record companies dictate how I will<BR>listen to my music<br />Don't support copy protection by buying this CD!
B000003CMC|5.0|What can I say?  This is a great album.  It was back then, and it still is.  I decided 20 years ago that I want &quot;Blue Sky&quot; played at my funeral.  Personally, I feel that Les Brers in A minor is one of their best.  I am an aging person who is fortunate enough to have learned to enjoy the All Bros. through a &quot;passing it down&quot;.  I was born in '62 and unfortunately missed them in their prime.  Recently, I played this album for a man who is 54 and really part of the generation.  It had been a long time since he heard it and it was &quot;part of his past&quot; so to speak.  I can't tell you the joyous hour that was spent listening to this album...for him and for me.  It definitely is a good one.  I never grow tired of it.
B0000029GA|3.0|But it's still boring. I equate this to Tribe Called Quest. Everyone praises them for being good lyricists but there are no good hard beats to their songs. Same here, the lyrics might be second to none, but I can't listen to it just to hear the words. Maybe I'm not a &quot;true&quot; fan but when i listen to Hip-Hop I listen for good beats first and lyrics second. I wanna hear albums made a little later like Outkast, Aquemini. Almost all the beats on that album are hard and catchy and never get boring. Maybe it's because i don't like the early 90's stuff, or that I'm not a true fan but i thought it was really boring.<br />On a side note, if you wanna hear good beats from the early 90's look for Mobb Deep's first album. Those are some hard street beats.
B000002H6C|4.0|This is a great album for anyone who likes Metallica or metal.  I recommend it.  By the way, i would give this 4.5 out of 5 stars, not 4.<br />Blackened: 10/10 This is an IN-CREDIBLE track. My favorite on the album, which ties with &quot;One&quot;. Lyrics are good, exept maybe &quot;To begin whipping dance of the dead&quot; which is still not terrible.<br />...And Justice for All: 9/10 Wow! What a long, song! I really like it though, it portrays the greed and coruption of our gouvernment.<br />Eye of the Beholder: 9/10 Another good song on this album, not much to say.<br />One: 10/10 This is my favorite on the album which ties with &quot;Blackened&quot;.  I love the anti-war prospect about how a man gets all his limbs blown off, and how he wishes for death.  Kirk Hammet has one of the best solos I have ever heard in this song.<br />Shortest Straw: 6/10 This is not a terrible song, but its to repetitive.<br />Harvester of Sorrow: 9/10 I didn't like this song much when I first purchused the album, but now I like the guitar melody which playes throughout the song alot.<br />The Frayed Ends of Sanity: 7/10 Not much to say about this song, it just doesn't click with me as much as other Metallica songs do.  The beginning is cool though.<br />To Live is to Die: 9/10 I like the all the different guitar riffs throughout the song, I like the lyrics in this too.<br />Dyers Eve: 7/10 This song is okey, again I like the sound, but not the singing so much.  The topic is ok, just not how James sings it.<br />So go out to the nearest store with 15 smackaroos and buy it.
B0000214F2|3.0|This movie emphasizes a known fact that humor is better than any medicine.  Personally, I had my own Shaman named Jeff Rollins who played a big part in my recovery from elbow surgery four years ago as he kept me laughing and gave friendly encouragement.  We all need someone like Jeff Rollins or Patch Adams.<br />Robin Williams was at his peak when he made this film; he was brilliant as a therapist with cancer patients and other terminally ill adults and children.<br />A couple years ago in downtown Knoxville, I quite by chance encountered a person out on the street (actually coming out of a coffee shop) dressed as a clown with a big, red nose.   I asked, &quot;Are you Patch Adams?&quot;  and was given a business card with a sketch of 'Poppy' on which he was quoted in 2000, &quot;A smile from the heart is the essence of the universal language and shows our love of people.&quot;<br />It turns out his name is Wes Flener, a respiratory therapist from LaGrange, KY, here to entertain at a seminar at a local hospital.  When I suggested that he visit the patients over at Children's Hospital across the street from his local destination, he presented me with a card &quot;Good for One Laugh.&quot;<br />This movie follows the daily interaction between Patch, his associates, and the patients who need his help.  Allowing the mentally challenged and disturbed Larry to join the mountain retreat as a resident was a monumental mistake.<br />PATCH ADAMS is an unforgettable story based on truth.
B00004XOWM|4.0|I know that Fred Durst is a dick and their music is dying down but this is a really cool album. Whether it's the hard 'rollin' or the catchy 'the one' this really is the best album that the bizkit have realeased. Forget about the new RESULTS MAY VARY, this is the album that showed the world that they could rock.
B0001AVZA8|3.0|This wasn't the comedy I expected.  Well, the first half was.  The second half was OK, just not my type of movie, I guess.  It seemed to drag on until I wondered if it would end.  I'm only 23 so maybe I just don't appreciate the whole point of the movie.  It got way too mushy for me.  I guess stories about people who mess up their lives like this don't grab my sympathy.<BR>The humor was hilarious, and the plot was meaningful and all that, and the actors were great, which is why it gets 3 stars from me.
B000099T2L|1.0|Just another conceited airhead with no intelligence and looks that blind people into thinking that she's the biggest thing to happen to music spewing out the same old crap, just oversinging her words and saying nothing. Most of this album has everyone and their grandma guesting on it. If she truly is what she and everyone else says she is, can't she do ANYthing by herself??? Alicia Keys can. Tori Amos can. Lauryn Hill (where ARE you when we need you?) could. India.Arie and Ashanti are the only girls in R&amp;B that I care to listen to because they keep it positive and are real females and have talent. Otherwise, females in R&amp;B have just gone down the drain, and that's why I don't even bother to listen to women too much (or R&amp;B), cause they seem to have nothing to say besides doing that played-out booty dance. Listen to rock music, listen to jazz (Diana Krall and Norah Jones especially), listen to ANYTHING but this overrated garbage. Remember when R&amp;B used to mean something? Marvin Gaye, Aretha, Gladys Knight, Stevie Wonder, all those people not only were truly soulful but were deep as well. I don't see how that girl won all those awards for this...oh well, I guess style will trump substance every time. And as long as it does, R&amp;B music will continue its downward spiral with people like her representing it and I'll continue to listen to people from other genres or older music, because that's when artists were truly artists and music was really music.
B00003CXXM|4.0|I haven't read the book, I have only read the third part. But the whole ludlum-idea behind Jason Bourne, Delta one from Medusa, trained to take out Carlos, isn't in the movie. The same for Carlos himself, no Carlos in the movie. And that very essential part is something I really missed and certainly devalues the movie as a whole. For those who didn't read the book(s) a great movie. But when you did read the book(s), it's disappointing.
B000035Z3K|5.0|While I fully understand the urge to swap this older release for one of the new Universal Legacy sets (Dracula or the deluxe Monster Legacy box), I implore you not to do it. Not only is the sound much better on this earlier release, but the new set contains the censored print that was originally released in 1931 in which Dracula's \\"death groans\\" are highly abbreviated (although it contains a few seconds of music that this release lacks). The contents of the two disks seem to be identical but the quality isn't. If you can put up with the very real possibility of having to repeatedly return sets in order to obtain one that performs perfectly, the Monster Legacy box is a good deal (especially at Amazon's price) and its transfers of the other films in the Universal series are very good, but this film is the exception. THIS ONE'S A KEEPER!
B00013PHGS|5.0|This is Air's best CD and is the best example of electronic music moving off the dancefloor and into the emotional down tempo world of chillin' or lounge music. Believe the hype on this one. If you saw &quot;Lost in Translation&quot;, then you've heard music from this CD. Don't purchase for the DVD, it's pretty much worthless due to poor content, buy it for the music.<BR>This is one of my favorite CDs out right now, along with mr.deviant's &quot;Techno Obsession&quot; which is a killer mix of power rock and hard dance music.
B000003S0P|5.0|This is it folks, the Holy Grail of Prog.  On this one perfect record, Robert Fripp simultaneously paid homage to the genre he had helped create and drove that fading style kicking and screaming toward a possible future.  Then he blew the whole thing up, ending the band for the rest of the 70's before Red was even released.<br />Aided and abetted by John Wetton on bass and vocals and the incredible Bill Bruford on percussion, the mid-70's Crim created a loud, powerful, improvisational form of progressive rock unlike anything that had come before, and so far ahead of it's time that it's time still hasn't come.  King Crimson had been moving towards this melding of traditional symphonic prog with improvisation and new technology on Larks Tongues in Aspic and Starless and Bible Black, but Red was the last and best.<br />&quot;Fallen Angel&quot; and &quot;One More Red Nightmare&quot; find a slight return to the Greg Lake-era of song based material, with the band, now a trio, augmented by various horns from past associates Mel Collins, Mark Charig and Robin Miller.<br />&quot;Providence&quot; is a dark improvisation featuring the recently departed David Cross on violin.  The presence of all these former members and guests on this album is part of it's classic status.  It was the end of a band (at least until Fripp reformed the Crim in 81) and the end of an era, and this album truly feels like a valedictory summation.  And the best is yet to come.<br />&quot;Starless&quot; is quite simply my all-time favorite prog song ever, by anyone.  The level of emotion and power in this epic piece is unsurpassed, from the majestic sweep of the opening mellotron and Fripp's weeping guitar figures (which had been played live on violin by Cross,) to the taut, tense middle section, to the whirlwind release of the solos and the wonderful moment when the band crashes back into the main theme.  This is the stuff prog-heads dream of, plain and simple.  Original Crimsonite Ian MacDonald returns to play sax, completing the circle of guest spots.  Oh, and &quot;Starless&quot; features John Wetton's best vocal ever, for good measure.<br />&quot;Starless&quot; alone is worth the price of admission, but the fact that the rest of Red is so great is what puts it at the top of my heap.  I listen to it more then The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway, more than Close to the Edge, more than any other prog CD I own.<br />And then there's the title track, where Fripp and Co. matter-of -factly invent math rock.  One can go on and on with this classic recording.....s to play sax, completing the circle of guest spots.  Oh, and &quot;Starless&quot; features John Wetton's best vocal ever, for good measure.<br />&quot;Starless&quot; alone is worth the price of admission, but the fact that the rest of Red is so great is what puts it at the top of my heap.

0393317552|3.0|Those of us not expert in history or the sciences are at the mercy of the writer of books of this sort. Much of it sounds very convincing, but when I read on page 19 that assumptions of racial superiority (when held by westerners) are loathsome and then the author goes on at some length to explain why he feels New Guineans are more intelligent than westerners, even providing a genetic explaination, I have to wonder if some politically-correct assumptions aren't at work. He winds up this section on page 22 with &quot;Why did New Guineans wind up technologically primitive, despite what I believe to be their superior intelligence?&quot;<BR>Though there is undoubtably much truth in this book, the less-than-objective admission and puzzling double standard at the beginning don't lead me to fully trust the author.

One of the best   10/10<BR>We Got The Right:  Good song, but fails to inspire   7.5/10<BR>Save Us:  Great chorus! 'please savvvvvvvvvvvve us!'   9/10<BR>March of Time:  Simply rockin'! From start to finish!   10/10<BR>I Want Out:  Very pop-like, but since when is that a problem?   9/10<BR>Keeper of the Seven Keys:  13-minute melodic trip that should be the best song here but falls short of a couple. Still great.   9/10<br />As you can see this album has tons of great songs. Is should also note that vocals are truly amazing and the solos are very impressive (esp. on Eagle Fly Free). This is a great album. Up there with the best of Iron Maiden...
B0000062GE|1.0|Darkest Days is pretty bad.  I've spent a couple minutes here staring blankly at this pulsating screen trying to come up with an opening statement a little smarter sounding than that, but alas, it'll serve it's purpose.  The only thing more discouraging than this band's total lack of originality is the apparently bloated following it's recieved.  Bloated, in fact, can be applied to this album in a number of different ways.  First, the lyrics, which I would consider bloated with hot air.  Like a balloon.  A big, angsty, self-absorbed balloon.  Honestly, nothing here transcends the level of drama you'll see on an episode of Dawson's Creek.  There's no symbolism (at least none worth mentioning), no creativity, and, here's the kicker, no sincerity.  Quite a few popular rock bands manage to complain about failed relationships and the amount of suckage involved with life (suckage usually brought on by said relationships) over the same number of tracks Stabbing Westward do.  It's not deep, it's not moving, it's not romantic.  It's dumb and trite.  Not unlike the music, which plays out like really lame sounding, cookie-cutter industrial.  Or really bad sounding Nine Inch Nails.  Which, essentially, is what this band is, a poor man's Nine Inch Nails. Take away the talent, the lyrical integrity, the complex song arrangements, and the diversity, and you might get something akin to Stabbing Westward.  And I'm not the type of person who thinks every modern electro-rock act is an NIN ripoff - I think Orgy are far from it, and extremely talented - but the boys in Westward are just too obvious to get away with it.  Spare yourself the mediocrity and look someplace else.
B0001UL7RY|4.0|avrils new album, under my skin is a lot deeper than let go. her music is more down to earth but there still is some edge to it. she shows her depth in this album more. i rate this a 4 because it is a really good album. i reccomend you to buy this album.<BR>thx

0671027387|5.0|I have read a number of other reviews of this book and it seems folks either love it or hate it. Put me in the former group.<br />Too many people say it is a formula of Dan Brown's other books. If so, so what. The object of any book is to either inform or entertain. The best written books do both. This is a book like that. It informs in that it gives you some behind the scenes looks at Washington and our Federal agencies. Not all of what it says is true, since after all, it is a work of fiction. Yes, Dan doesn't spend hundreds of pages &quot;developing&quot; the characters, but then again in an adventure novel who wants an autobiography of each character? Not me, for sure. I want the book to get down to the action. And this book has more action than most. Hard to believe that humans can take this much physical abuse and be able to stand up at the end of the story! That is why I enjoy Dan Brown's writing, as well as Clive Cussler, Tom Clancey, et al. Those who complain about Dan's writing sure must not like Tom Clancey's then. He spends 950 pages bulding a plot and resolves it all in the last 50 pages. But I still enjoy his writing.<br />Anyway, since many before me have written about the plot of this particular book, I only want to say, forget what Dan wrote in The Davinci Code or any other book, kick back and enjoy this book as if you have never read a Dan Brown book before in your life. If you do, you will enjoy it as much as I did. If you want character development, read someone's autobiography. If you want more facts, read a textbook. If you want to be entertained, read this book.
B00009Z576|4.0|For most fans, Yes without lead singer Jon Anderson is a horror thought. But as history has shown, Anderson did leave the band after the tour for the &quot;Tormato&quot; album, with keyboard wiz Rick Wakeman in tow, and they were replaced by the duo known as The Buggles---vocalist Trevor Horn, and keyboardist Geoff Downes. Their only album with Yes, 1980's &quot;Drama,&quot; is a surprisingly good album. While no one on God's given Earth can sing like Jon Anderson, Trevor Horn sings close enough (albeit in a *slightly* lower register), and he takes Anderson's place at the mic just fine. These days, Trevor Horn may be to Yes what George Lazenby is to the James Bond movies (i.e. he only made one, *and* he was filling a very large pair of shoes), but give the guy some credit: he was good! Geoff Downes, meanwhile, is a more than capable keyboardist for this classic English rock outfit, and he &amp; Horn slot in alongside Chris Squire, Steve Howe, &amp; Alan White very well.&quot;Drama&quot; is a very short album---just 35 minutes---but in those 35 minutes is some great Yes music, the highlights for me being &quot;Does It Really Happen?,&quot; &quot;Into The Lens,&quot; and &quot;Tempus Fugit,&quot; all top-notch, first-rate Yes rockers. Seriously, with all due respect to the great Jon Anderson, I would've been quite happy if the &quot;Drama&quot; line-up of Yes had decided to continue. And they might have---by all accounts, they were received quite well by U.S. audiences on the tour for the album. Unfortunately, British &amp; European audiences were not so kind, and, subsequently, Trevor Horn got cold feet about continuing on as the group's frontman. Well, I can't really blame him. Yes broke up after the &quot;Drama&quot; tour was finished, with everyone splitting up to work on other projects---Horn becoming a producer, Howe &amp; Downes forming the supergroup Asia, and Squire &amp; White teaming up with Trevor Rabin for a project (hint hint), and it looked like Yes were finished for good. But come 1983, Yes roared back to life, with Jon Anderson back in the fold, for the smash album, &quot;90125.&quot; But in the process, &quot;Drama&quot; has been sorely overlooked. I hope more Yes fans will check out this unfairly underrated album, and find out for themselves just how really good it actually is. Even without Jon Anderson, it's still Yes to my ears.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Too bad they took this show off the air, it had a ton of potential. Great viewing.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I don't watch a lot of TV because the majority of the stuff out there is horrible, but after hearing some great reviews about the series from some friends at work I decided to give it a try. I wasn't disappointed, this is the best series I've seen in a long time. I was heartbroken that I wouldn't be able to find out the conclusions to all the plots in progress. <br />The series was so well written that my wife and parents also really enjoyed it and they aren't fans of Sci-fi. <br />I'll definately be at the movie opening day and I'll have my whole family with me.
B000003S5H|5.0|This is my first ambient/techno music cd.  I'd heard 'All I Need' on satellite several years ago and was hooked right away, but never bothered to look up the cd until now.  I love the instrumental - especially the first track.  Wish I could find more of the same - I'm not into the trip-hop side of this genre I'm finding so any recommendations greatly appreciated.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Avril Lavigne, after a period of leaving fans in suspense, is back with another album. &quot;Under my skin&quot; combines teenage love ballads, with deep, heartfelt, thoughts.<br />Avril's voiuce is beautiful...eerie in places. With every song you can almost visualize what she's thinking when she writes her songs.<br />The new album is great. Avril crushes the image of a pop star, shakes it up and glues it back together in a whole new way. Thats what makes this album so great.
0312263120|4.0|I've read some of the other reviews on this board, and they seem to be coming from a bunch of whiners.  Not to surprising considering this is Amazon.  People are quick to point out it is technically inaccurate, but are not smart enough to tell you what those inaccuracise are.  Not to mention they are assuming most of the world are software engineers.  Anyway, I thought this was a great read, and a real page turner.  Dan Brown does seem to use a formula, but doesn't every successful author?  This book is worth reading unless you are one of the reviewers on this board whose life revolves around Star Trek and Japanese amime.  If you have enjoyed his other work you won't be disappointed by this.
B00029LNHS|5.0|Even though there is a stupid song called &quot; Let's Get Retarted&quot; the album is still very good with the hit songs &quot; Where is the Love&quot; and &quot; Hey Mama&quot;.

B0001CCXZW|5.0|\\"The Show That Almost Wasn't.\\"<br />That's the most surprising lesson learned about the nature of television production -- as told by the show's creator Amy Sherman-Palladino -- in the WB's stellar GILMORE GIRLS release: Ms. S-P had pitched a variety of programs for WB executives, and, when they asked for more, she made up an idea on the spot -- with no preparation or background detail -- which the executives took!  Then, Ms. S-P had to go and create it.<br />GILMORE GIRLS arguably stands as a benchmark in television history.  In some ways, the program is like SEINFELD: if you don't get it, you won't get it.  In other ways, it's a high quality Hallmark Channel movie-of-the-week, currently stretching out beyond its fourth season and soon to be entering its fifth.  Still, in more ways, there's absolutely nothing else like it on television.<br />GG is far more than just the story of Lorelai Gilmore and her daughter, Lorelai \\"Rory\\" Gilmore: it's the story of the fictional town known as Star's Hollow -- the dreamland for bed-n-breakfast businesses -- and the odd assortment of characters who happen to live, work, and breathe there.  While the centerpiece is clearly the Gilmore family -- a contemporization of the BRADY BUNCH, if there could ever be such a thing -- the spin of the show is, to its benefit, the plethora of wonderfully imagined and uniquely quirky townsfolk who populate the secondary storylines.<br />And, yes, the acting is top notch.  The direction is absolutely superb.  The writing is, by far, some of the most deserving work being put up on the boob tube today.<br />Still, GG is on the WB, meaning that it will, more than likely, never find the kind of ratings the show deserves.  Like STAR TREK, GILMORE will find its true financial potential in syndication and DVD releases ... much like this current release of the 21 1st season episodes.<br />To my delight, I'm just discovered these television characters.  My wife has watched the show since the beginning, but I always dismissed it as a \\"chick flick,\\" tuning it out to spend my time on other shows.  However, she convinced me to give it a chance this past season (its fourth), and now -- here am I -- writing a review for Season 1 that we watched together virtually non-stop.  Others here have raved about the quality of the writing -- the true lifeblood of the program -- and I wouldn't even attempt to do GILMORE a disservice in discussing it other than to add \\"every good thing that's been said here is absolutely not enough to sanctify how well, apparently, every episode is written.\\"<br />Honestly, GILMORE is really that good.<br />Truth be told, the extras are surprisingly thin -- but of good quality -- on this 1st season release, especially considering the fact that the show is currently in production for the WB.  Disc 6 includes a handful of deleted scenes; a mini-doc with some revealing insights from the show's creator, cast, and crew; and some scenes from various episodes edited together in a piece that tries to capture the 'essence' of what makes GILMORE GIRLS as remarkable a television achievement as it is.  One would think that Warner Brothers would've offered more -- in-depth interviews with the series cast OR, minimally, an audio commentary or two -- but, sadly, that isn't the case.  As a result, one could argue that the studio -- as Amy Sherman-Palladino points out in the scant 30 minute documentary -- has underestimated the intelligence of its audience, focusing only on the commercialism of the program and not feeding the fanbase brain.<br />The 6-disc set is presented in full screen format.  The video quality is excellent.  The sound quality is excellent (there are a handful of scenes that are hard to hear b/c of verbal pacing, not production issues).  Overall, this is one great package only lessened by what they chose not to provide: audio commentaries.I always dismissed it as a \\"chick flick,\\" tuning it out to spend my time on other shows.

B00005JMEW|5.0|Quentin Tarrantino is finally back with a bang and a splatter.  Showing his roots finally with a two part homage to Asian cinema.  Little bit of history about the director, when he dropped out of high school, he spent a lot of his free time watching asian cinema at a theater near his home.  This movie is broken into compartments, this movie has the samurai japanese style, the animae segment, and a piece that is similar to 70's style low budget action flicks.  It is gorier than any more he has done, and any movie that was mainstream for that year, but still a lot of fun.<br />The action sequences were superbly filmed and shown with not only in a style similar to old asian style cinema but a great deal of respect.  The characters were well acted and had a three dimensional feel to them.  Tarrantino's obsession with the 70's shows all around, look at the cereal that Vivica A Fox's character is holding.  It also contains the patented Tarrantino humor, offbeat, twisted, and just a little nerdy.<br />Uma Thurman shows her fans that she isn't just a wilting flower, she is a powerful figure in this movie.  A former bride that is out for revenge.  She is driven to avenge the deaths of her child and husband.  It shows in the limited interactions she has with her prey.  She respects them for their abilites, and nothing else.  Nothing will stop her from her goals, even when one of her prey has reformed, it doesn't matter, she is going to die.  Fans will love her in this, she is tough, smart, and deadly, playing the anti hero role perfectly.<br />Kung fu and samurai fans will be pleased with this movie.  From the bloody and well choreographed fight sequence/knife fight, to the samurai showdown at the end of the movie.  They even do the blood and dismemberment similar to japanese samurai movies.  Though this isn't a Jacki Chan movie, half the budget was probably spent on blood and dismembered body parts.<br />The villians are an interesting lot.  All of them have their quirks, but they are still villians.  There is the bloodthirsty Elle Driver, fabulously played by Daryl Hannah.  Vernita Green, the former killer trying to reform.  Budd, the haunted former assasin played well by Michael Madsen.  The icy O-Ren Ishii, a sociopath written practically for Lucy Liu.  As well as the enigmatic Bill, voiced by David Carradine. <br />The only real bad part of this movie was is the plot was a bit simplistic.  But if you look at it how it was intended, it wasn't a bad thing. This was a visual film, intended to showing you what was going on rather than telling you.  Too many plot elements would have slowed down the pace, and made it seem like a longer movie.  Make no mistake, this is an action movie, flat out.  You are supposed to buckle in and enjoy the ride.<br />Five stars for a polished and quality action flick.  Hopefully Tarrantino's next movie will show this same sort of progression.
B000268QB2|2.0|Rodolfo, from San Francisco.<br />Maybe you got the feeling that me, like others, want everyone to hate Keane. This is not so; as I said before, there is potential here and 3 amazing tracks. However, to respond to your question &quot;what constitutes soul?&quot; there is not way to define that with words (there is, but it'd be too long).<br />Instead, I beg you to download The Shins' &quot;Chutes Too Narrow&quot; or Flaming Lips' &quot;Yoshimi Battles...&quot;. Here you will find pop's immediacy, hooks, universal lyrics, and great singing. All the components Keane supposedly has. There I hope you find &quot;soul&quot;; not in order to never listen to Keane again, but just so that you can get my point.<br />PD. The attacks to people who didn't like this cd were unnecessary. Some may be snobs, but some others (like myself) didn't like Hopes and Fears, plain and simple. The idea of this is for possible buyers to read both sides of a coin.
0743243315|2.0|Do yourself a favor and pass on this book. Could not care about the characters, story just seemed to go on and on. It was way too long which just increased the pain.
B00005U122|4.0|Roger Waters is definentley one of my favorite song writers of all time. I am almost definently sure he wrote everything that he performs on this dvd with the excpetion of Comfortably Numb (David Gilmour.) He wrote all of the good Floyd songs. And he knows just how to perform them. If you are a Pink Floyd fan you must own this dvd. There are way more performances than Live at Pompeii, but it lacks the rest of Pink Floyd. I give it 4 stars, because some of these songs were written with the intention of Gilmour and Wright singing them. The guy who sings them isn't bad at all, but it just isnt the same. The guitarist is really good and plays Gilmour's solos perfectly. None the less, watching Roger Waters sing some of the songs that he sings on the albums is bad @ss. Roger Waters is the $hit. He even plays bass and acoustic guitar the whole time. Unlike in The Wall Live at Berlin where he hardly even touches one. The band in this concert is unbelievable and this would have been me favorite Floyd DVD if it werent for Pompeii. Definently buy Pompeii if you like seeing the original Floyd all together, but if you like the songs on this DVD get this. It's defineently better than David Gilmour's because it has more Pink Floyd songs. Unless they come out with an old Floyd DVD of one of their old concerts this will remain the best Floyd all concert DVD (because Pompeii is more of a hanging out with the band movie.)Basically if you like Pink Floyd, buy this DVD.
B00000JGOJ|5.0|Not many people have heard of this movie, much less seen it, which is odd condsidering the number of well-known actors it stars.  A few famous faces are Sean Connery, Dennis Quaid, Angelina Jolie, Gillian Anderson, and Madeline Stowe.  The movie centers around several romantic relationships that you know are interconneted, but don't find out how until the end.  If you're looking for romance, drama, and don't mind some tears, I would highly recommend this movie.  It's become one of my all-time favorites!
6305897786|5.0|I'm currently watching the TRIO channel's disgusting butchery of this film as apart of their &quot;month of flops&quot; promotion.  The only FLOP I see is their editing of essential footage.  They have condensed the movie to under 2 hours...and have subsequently made certain scenes appear as &quot;stupid&quot; (for lack of a better word).<br />This movie grew on me.  I was not intially impressed, but after viewing it with friends and family, I have become a big fan of its haunting yet calming persona.  The subject matter deals with Satanic idolatry, but the movie is in no way &quot;goth&quot;.  It's the kind of film you could watch with your children and not worry about them being scarred for life.<br />As far as comedy, Johnny Depp's bad luck with women is hilarious.  His facial expressions (even while killing &quot;the albino&quot;) are a hoot.<br />As for the ending, after many viewings I believe Depp went to hell where he was praised for being the human father of the anti-Christ.  All along, the lady in the sneakers was Satan.
B00008S2VG|5.0|It's rare that a star can still sell 100,000 tickets per city, have the highest grossing tour of the year, and be relevant for over 20 years. THough Madonna's latest tour is the biggest money making and critically acclaimed tour of the year, not everything she does is a success. Take the American Life album, which was released in April of 2003. Like all celebrities who spoke out against the war, she was pretty much blacklisted. Radio stations, ran by Clear Channel (Bush's business buddy), refused to play the songs from the album. Even though it only sold 1 million copies in the US, it still sold 5 million worldwide. Still, this is disappointing for Madonna.<BR>     American Life contains some of the best songs of her career: the heartwarming &quot;Nothing Fails,&quot; the disco era &quot;Mother and Father,&quot; and the rockin' &quot;Intervention.&quot; These songs show Madonna at the height of her singing and songwriting capabilities. It's unfortunate that the so-so &quot;American Life&quot; was chosen as the first single off this album cause it certainly doesn't represent the rest of the album. <BR>     Just like 1992's &quot;Erotica,&quot; this album will be seen as a classic in years to come.
B000003TA4|1.0|You gotta love the media. I was watching VH1 the other day, specifically Maxim's Hot 100. Well, apparently, Michelle Branch is in the top 20s. Now that must mean that every plain looking girl in my school is the &quot;20th most beautiful woman in the world.&quot; What does this have to do with Nirvana, you ask? Well, the media tends to look at things very subjectively, whether it be VH1 or music critics. Something's influence and it's aesthetic value are separate identities and should be kept separate. So what if Michelle Branch has a promising career and is making lots of money, that doesn't make her beautiful. Along the same lines, so what if Nirvana opened the doors for grunge (and other types of hard rock music)and had a big cultural impact? They weren't revolutionary and aren't a good band.<BR>Nevermind, itself, is a very mediocre CD. Smells Like Teen Spirit was a very catchy song, but the video itself is what sold the band and paved the door for other Seattle bands. It is sad how image sells CDs these days, and this is a prime example of that. Was grunge a musical movement, or a social one, selling the teenage outcast look? <BR>For all the people that'll read this and say, &quot;Oh, he's just another Nirvana basher,&quot; let me just say that I've actually listened to this CD. I listened to it for a month, on the bus ride home and to school. That's about 2 hours a day. Great albums grow on you. This one started off horrible, like alot of other great albums, but unlike those albums, I only grew to like it enough to stand listening to it for a month. What makes this CD not great? Well, first off, Kobain's lyrics/vocals. Songs like Lithium and Come As You Are have such stupid lyrics/vocals that I'm suprised people like them. How can you have a chorus with the lyrics &quot;yeah&quot;? People who think Cobain's lyrics are &quot;deep&quot; or &quot;genius&quot; are really idiots; he's just being lazy. How do I know? Because when I get lazy I write noncoherent stupidlyrics, too. Some bands are good despite mediocre lyrics, but not this one. The guitar work and song structures, simple and quite predictable, don't exactly help the band. There is no subtlety. You don't hear new things everytime you listen to the CD, there aren't layers to it, which all the great CDs have. I really do believe that you need to know how to play guitar well in order to write good rock songs, and Cobain was no virtuoso. Ironically enough, the other Seattle bands (Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, AIC, etc.) were much better than this band, but they couldn't write good enough pop songs to be popular. Yet, they actually had something to say, some substance. I suggest getting some Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, Iron Maiden, or newer stuff like old Metallica or Tool.
B0001Z53AQ|1.0|Eminem is a great rapper, but that doesn't necessarily mean D12 is a great rap group..To be honest with you, the only track I like in the whole album was &quot;How Come&quot;..Overall,as an album the beats were nothing special, and other than Eminem and maybe Proof, the other members werent on Em's level...Then again, I really didn't like &quot;My Band&quot; either...Take it how u want, but this was a BAD CD....
B000002H97|3.0|As the title suggests, this was my first Metallica album. I liked this album for like a month, then it got really old, which brings me to my first point. This album has VERY little replay value. Songs that sound good at first, like Wherever I May Roam, get old fast. If you've ever listened to any album by Linkin Park, you know what I mean. Like the review says, the songs are simpler and more straight-forward (which really is never a good thing when it comes to metal). The lyrics/vocals for these songs are quite poor, particularly on Sad But True. Hetfield's desire to write from a different point of view is commendable, but, the problem is that his vocals were never Metallica's forte. Hetfield is no singer, and when he tries to sing, it is neither convincing nor pleasing to the ear. The annoying vocals of Sad But True make me cringe everytime I hear them, that's how bad they are. It's the mediocre vocals and simplistic, predictable song structure (i.e. not epic), that makes this album worse than their previous releases. On a positive note, songs like Don't Tread on Me and My Friend of Misery (?) have longer appeal, and are the best tracks on the CD. If you really love this CD, then you should get Hybrid Theory from Linkin Park. The catchiness is still their, but the lyrics are more personal and repetitive, like the music :) If you're looking to listen to metal, start with Black Sabbath's Paranoid or Iron Maiden's Number of the <BR>Beast. Then you might want to listen to some older Metallica, e.g. Master and Justice, and get into some music with great replayability, like Tool.

The actual show is not perfect, there were definetly a few better WM's, but hearing the crowd intensity even for the more dissapointing matches was still fun.  The Goldberg Vs. Lesnar match may very well be worth watching for the crowd critisizing their like of quickness to perform well.  The actual show got off to a pretty good start as well, when it was The big Show Vs. John Cena for the U.S. Title, in which the Big Show gave a great effort.  The Jericho Vs. Christian mact was entertaing with kind of a funny ending, fun to watch.  The two four way tag matches for both brands were kind of fun, but it's just that they had no big spark going for them. I personally enjoyed the Raw Brand on Better.  The Cruiserweight elimination match was just too rushed, although I really did not have a problem with Chavo Guerrero retaining his title.  The playboy evening gown match, was just for the men to have fun, plain and simple.  The last three matches were just great.  Angle Vs. Eddie G was very entertaining as those two put on a great show of athletisism.  Undertaker Vs. Kane is more memorable for the entrance of the Undertaker back to his deadman form, as the crowd just love it.  I did not mind Taker wearing his old uniform with, since he had a black leather trenchcoat with a black hat to match, being in plain black was just fine.  The match though should have and could have been longer.  The main event was a classic, great way to close out WM XX at MSG, as all three men gave a great effort, and Chris Benoit sarted hs well deserved reign as Heavy Weight Champion.  As for the DVD, it was just great.  The 3-disc DVD set included a great folding packing, with an attractive front cover and inside and even the back.  The set includes all matches, post and pre match interviews.  WM's ten greatest matches of all time, hosted by the Nature by Ric Flair, A look back at the behind The scenes moments of the previous Wrestlemania (XIX), hosted very well by Jessse the body ventura.  The set also includes, results, photo galleries, facts of the first 19 Wrestlemania'a.  Also, sevral sets of Wrestlemania Trivia Questions, a few entertaing deleted scenes and a few easter eggs.  Certainly worth the price at about 25 bucks, unlike a few WWE DVD's which cost just as much but are really not worth it. Overall I give WM XX as a show 3.5/5, but the DVD as a whole gets a 4.5.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is the first series to have me waiting each week for the next episode since Babylon 5. It is very well written and the cast are some of the best ever. I watched the series when it was aired and the DVD's many times. Each time I find something I missed or look at it from a different view.I definatly wish the series had been left to continue but cant wait until the new movie Serenity is released. It has the best of both worlds space with a little bit of the old west thrown in.

B00003CXE7|5.0|I approached viewing this film in the theaters as a typical summer &quot;guy film&quot; full of action and not much thought.  But my love of world history overcame my trepidation that I would see another &quot;toga&quot; film like those of 30 years ago.  So I went to see it--and was brought up short by the very first shot:  Maximus' hand skimming through the wheat.  That's when I knew it WOULD NOT be a typical toga action film.  Someone had actually put some thought behind character and plot and visually defining them.  So though Maximus' trajectory from great to fallen to great is nothing new--it's told better than the norm.  And I also liked the nods to actual historical figures (if not the exact same time period) in the names &quot;Maximus&quot; and &quot;Gracchus&quot;.<br />RE: Acting:  The character arc of Maximus would attract any actor, but I loved watching Russell Crowe.  Charlize Thereon (sp?) says she acts &quot;with her forehead&quot; and in many ways, so does RC, but he is also one of the few actors who could remain perfectly still yet still convey worlds of thoughts/emotions from the neck up. It was also nice to see Joachin Phoenix grow as an actor and hopefully reach a fuller potential than his late brother did. Richard Harris has played a number of kings very well and his Marcus Aurelius reminded me a lot of his Arthur over thirty years ago.  And of course, once again he is in a film with David Hemmings.  Derek Jacobi I don't worry about--after &quot;I Claudius&quot;, why should I?  And how wonderful was it to finally see Oliver Reed in a worthwhile film after waiting so long?  (Though of his many roles--and I've seen a lot--I still like Athos)  It was sad to lose him, and a few years later Harris and Hemmings.<br />All the dvd extras were nice, and for once,intellectually informative not just 'fan fare'.  I wish the final script was available however--not just the excerpts in the accompanying &quot;Making Of...&quot; book.  And what about a still of that first shot--or the matching last FS of Maximus striding though the wheat towards home and family?hat first shot--or the matching last FS of Maximus striding though the wheat towards home and family?
B00005JM0B|3.0|This film will not disappoint Terminator fans.  It took a long time to get from 2 to 3, but the spcial effects more than make up for it---even Arnie looks pretty good.<br />The action was beyond awesome, and the movie was actually pretty funny, with plenty of Terminator gags and jokes.  I was transported back to 1991, back to T2, which i thought was far better than T1.  This is more of T2, without the irritating Hamilton.  My biggest gripe is that the ending line of T2, which was so powerful, was in effect obliterated.  THen again, that obliteration of choosing your own fate made this fun romp possible.  This movie is one fast ride, no fat, all action, all arnie...no bad feelings here, it's all good!

B00005ABX0|4.0|Here we have two Beach Boys albums from 1967.  Many people already know the history of Smiley Smile, but I will go over it briefly.  Brian Wilson was working on Smile, an album that was being hyped as a masterpiece before it was even finished.  For whatever reason, Brian abandoned Smile before it was completed.  Instead, Smiley Smile was released in it's place.  Most of the songs on Smiley Smile were originally meant for Smile, but they were rerecorded in much less intricate versions.  The songs on Smiley Smile are all right for what they are, but they fall pretty flat compared to the Smile versions.  Still, they are not bad judged on their own merits.  &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;, which is the same version that would have been on Smile, is my personal favorite Beach Boys song.  Now, as for Wild Honey, it has often been called the Beach Boys &quot;soul&quot; album.  It does have more of an &quot;r&amp;b&quot; feel to it than other Beach Boys albums.  It's an enjoyable album, with the highlights being &quot;Wild Honey&quot;, &quot;Darlin'&quot; and &quot;Let the Wind Blow&quot;.  The CD also includes six bonus tracks.  &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot; is an interesting alternate take.  There are several minutes of fascinating instrumental session outtakes from the &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; recording sessions, plus a complete early take with different lyrics.  &quot;You're Welcome&quot; is the b-side of &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot;.  &quot;Their Hearts Were Full of Spring&quot; is, of all things, a song from a rehearsal for a Hawaiian concert.  &quot;Can't Wait Too Long&quot; is an incredible piece of music made up of several different takes of the same song.  While not everything on this CD is good, it still has some great moments.  Recommended to Beach Boys fans.
0141439475|4.0|Shelley's novel is so much more than a story about a monster. The whole mood of her novel is electrifying and startling. The sensation is similar to arriving at the very edge of a mountain precipice, gazing down, and feeling the enormity of life rush over you. This sense of vertigo is one of Shelley's gifts. She has the wild writer's mind and she can deliver the chills. One could argue her shocking sense of life was very similar to the later wildly popular french philosopher Jean Paul Sarte, and the theme of his sudden realization of the horror of existence. Shelley's gothic novel written in the age of romance has elements of both styles. But, it's her wild mind that makes this novel eerie, extraordinary and amazing. (Read intently and thoughtfully for best results.)
0393057658|5.0|Awesome!  The Oakland A's GM defies tradition and wins baseball games based on a different view of baseball stats and facts.  This book has made me look at other sports, business, and life in general a little differently.  I read the whole book over a weekend. . .something I almost never do.  Fascinating!  Read it. (I wish my home town ball club would wake up and read this book too.)
B0000CABBW|5.0|Beautifully blending mystical Maori tribe beliefs with modern day 21st century, \\"Whale Rider\\" will have even the most hard-hearted cynics wiping their tear-stained eyes.<br />According to a long-standing Maori legend, of which \\"Whale Rider\\" is much hinged upon,  the tribe's male warrior and leader, Paikea rode to New Zealand on the back of a whale thousands of years ago. Since that time, the first-born male heir to the Maori chief has always assumed the title of whale rider at adolescence. At the opening of \\"Whale Rider\\" however, the designated male heir dies in infancy. His twin sister, although is spared and thus is born the strong, little precocious girl-cum-warrior \\"Pai\\", played by a luminous and stunningly beautiful, Keisha Castle-Hughes.<br />Old chief, grandfather Koru, steeped in the \\"old Maori ways and traditions\\" however, refuses to accept Pai as the true \\"one\\".<br />What is most extraordinary about this book and film is instead of a \\"coming of age\\" tale being solely about a child's first love, the loss of a young girl's virginity or total child-like innocence lost, \\"Whale Rider\\" takes a sort of moral highground.  This story is a \\"coming of age\\" rarity for the plain and simple fact that it shows a young girl asserting herself in a traditionally male role, much like \\"Bend It Like Beckham\\", \\"Mulan\\" or even \\"National Velvet\\".<br />\\"My name is Paikea Apirana, and I come from a long line of chiefs...\\"<br />Highly Recommended & Happy Watching!
B000002UAR|5.0|This is often called the greatest album of all time and deservedly so. In three and a half years, the progress the Beatles made as musicians and artists is truly mind-boggling. Revolver stands with Sgt. Pepper and Abbey Road as their most cohesive album, and yet the songs and styles are so diverse. The Beatles leave romance far behind as a theme (only 2 songs deal directly with love, both Paul songs, and they're a far-cry from simple puppy love ballads), and embrace everything from taxation to loneliness to drugs to Buddhist transcendentalism to well, yellow submarines. And the music is as eclectic a mix as the White Album...jangling rock, classical orchestration, backwards guitars, Indian raga, sound effects combined with a brass band, and an explosion of tape loops, drumming, and vocal distortion. So how does this wildly diverse album hold together? For one thing, this is definitely the Beatles playing as a group; though each song clearly belongs to one of the writers, they are collaborating on the musical performance to reach their full potential.<br />There is a thematic thread running throughout: in its diversity, the album is a reflection of existence itself, from the confusions and pleasures of the material world, to the lures of a druggy escape from reality, and finally the transcendence of meditation, LSD, or death, take your pick according to what you think Tomorrow Never Knows is about. Taxman opens things up very much in the material world with its cynical, sardonic rant, and it's followed by Eleanor Rigby, which explores the social world and the way people are isolated from one another. John's answer to life's problems is to sleep, while George offers the first glimpse of wisdom and an answer with the first full-blown sitar number on a Beatles album (and probably in any Western pop song). Paul shows us the more romantic side of life with Here, There, and Everywhere, takes us on a comical fantasy trip into a children's tale of yellow submarines, and thenJohn takes us on a more real, more frightening voyage with his She Said She Said, based on a bad acid trip. Side 2 kicks off with our last look at life's simple pleasures (Good Day Sunshine) before weaving a mix of songs about drugs (speed in Doctor Robert, pot in Got to Get You Into My Life), frustrated miscommunication (And Your Bird Can Sing, I Want to Tell You) and disappointment in love (For No One). And then finally, the track that tries to guide us through all the confusion, the spellbinding and unforgettable Tomorrow Never Knows, which advises us to &quot;play the game existence to the end.&quot;<br />From the album's cover (designed by Klaus Voorman, it may beat Sgt. Pepper as the coolest and it's certainly the trippiest) to the musical content, this is the Beatles at their most mind-blowing. With John eating acid for breakfast and Paul encouraged by his forays into the art world, Lennon-McCartney had never been bolder or better. But George is outstanding too, and for the first and only time, he has three songs on a single disc, including the album opener. With its cough and mumbled &quot;1, 2, 3, 4...&quot;, Taxman is I Saw Her Standing There's evil twin; and just as that was the perfect kickoff for the Beatles' debut this is the best way to start their first truly adult album. All the Beatles are in top form, including Ringo with his forceful drumming on some of these tracks and yes, Yellow Submarine (don't tell me it sucks, I grew up with that song). If you don't own this album, stand up now, walk out the door, go to your nearest music store, and pay up. To paraphrase Mr. McCartney, you've got to get it into your life.<BR>6/6
1570629706|4.0|I was a little disappointed with Demian. It was recommended to me by someone who's literary taste has never been wrong before, but it left me wanting. Hesse is obviously a brilliant thinking but the book came across as a dry academic essay thinly veiled in a novel, the life of Emil Siclair never taking root as a fine piece of fiction about a solid person.<br />Siddartha has addressed those areas I felt lacking, and is a more engaging spiritual conversation as well. I won't retread the story here, but the chracter of Siddartha is at once so removed from humanity to act as a mirror and yet so human himself. It is perhaps as perfect a blend of philosophical treatise and narrative I've come across.<br />Those interested in existentialism, eastern religious or most important personal journeys of enlightenment and discovery would do well to pick this book up.<br />I read it all today and I'm still turning it over in my mind to see what my final impression is, but one thing is certain. It hasn't left me as soon as I put down the book, as most books do.
B00000JCB2|1.0|This &quot;band&quot; doesn't even attempt to make a good album or any good songs.  If you like this kind of music, look into better guys like Rage Against the Machine, Korn or Hillary Duff (ha ha).
0380789035|5.0|I absolutely loved American Gods. Despite what some other reviewers have said, I think Neil Gaiman, a brit, was the perfect person to tell this tale. Who else would be better suited to telling the story of a clash between the gods of the old world and those created in American than a man born and raised in England who's relocated to middle America and has made a career of writing about dreams?<br />Old world versus new, old beliefs versus new vices. The character drama with issues of loss that won't fade away are gripping, and hold equal time with the not even slightly subtext of what we put faith in. And it works, never seeming scattered or spread thin.
B000000OSG|5.0|I bought this weeks ago along with UYI I for only $22 CDN combined. Both are great albums but this one is much stronger. Locomotive is one of the most underrated songs. I love it's chug and then it's somber piano outro. That song has never gotten the credit it deserves. It kicks ass. Estranged really is one of the finest GN'R works ever. Excellent guitar work by Slash on this one and great songwriting. So Fine has a great bridge and features Axl's &quot;Mike Patton Real Thing-era&quot; vocals. I would call those my favourites. <br />Some would call Get In The Ring and My World embarrassing, but I like them for that exact reason. It showcases how much of a madman Axl Rose truly is. Other moments highlighting his craziness would be the very end of You Could Be Mine, when he yells &quot;yeah&quot; and the way he lets the vocals linger during the end of Don't Cry.<br />Anyways, an amazing album.
B00003OO3O|5.0|In the mid 1970's UFO had a string of 4 brilliant studio albums... those being &quot;Force It&quot; (1975), &quot;No Heavy Petting&quot; (1976), &quot;Lights Out&quot; (1977) and &quot;Obsession&quot; (1978). Not to mention the incredible live album (&quot;Strangers In The Night&quot;) released just after &quot;Obsession&quot; in the same year. Five first-rate albums in four years... amazing! All are now considered classic, some more so than others. I personally pick &quot;Lights Out&quot; as my favorite because it's solid all the way through and my all-time 2 favorite UFO songs come from the album (&quot;Love To Love&quot; and the ripping title track). &quot;Force It&quot; is a close 2nd place though... this album is just as solid. &quot;Strangers In The Night&quot; (live) featured 5 of its 15 tracks from &quot;Force It&quot; (&quot;Shoot Shoot&quot;, &quot;Mother Mary&quot;, &quot;This Kids&quot;, &quot;Let It Roll&quot;, and &quot;Out In The Street&quot;). The other two tracks from &quot;Force It&quot; that can not go without mention are &quot;Too Much Of Nothing&quot; (a great rocker), and the ballad &quot;High Flyer&quot; (with a great Schenker solo). Mogg, Schenker, and drummer Parker all continue to shine on &quot;Force It&quot;. Great album from a very underrated band.
B000003TA4|1.0|Kurt Cobain's music was so safe and sanitary. Sure, the delivery was sometimes lo-fi (as on Bleach), but look at Nevermind, and you'll se what I mean. No band that constantly says they're for their fans is an honest band, especially a major label one like Nirvana. All bands have one main goal: To survive and make money. Everything else is an afterthought. When then-millionaire Kurt Cobain told teens in early 90's interviews that he felt alienated just like they did, it was the same thing as a Backstreet Boy singing to his fans in a huge arena that they were his \\"one and only true love\\" in 1997. Fans just wish they were that special \\"one\\" that the singer is talking about in their song, and they identify with that. Kurt found a way to cash in on that, and so he played into what teens wanted to hear. The problem with Nirvana is that they were never as musically-competent as Nevermind would have you believe. At best, Nevermind is simple, mediocre guitar rock. There's so much better music out there than Nirvana, and yet all of the band's hype blinds the easily-lead. By the way, Kurt Cobain was voted one of the most \\"sexiest rock stars\\", according to VH-1. What a hardcore Grunger!
B00008CLOA|5.0|I'd love to hear about what &quot;cranky viewer&quot; has been listening to these days(hopefully he wasn't too serious about the backstreet boys I should hope!).<br />actually,this isn't my favorite floyd cd.it is trippy as hell through and through,but I wish for a hybrid cd of the &quot;meddle&quot;album  or the &quot;more&quot; soundtrack more than dark side.for one thing,just because an album is immensly popular that doesn't mean it's the greatest thing on earth(all though dark side is better than most the music that was popular then and now).it's like how everyone says led zeppelin was the all time greatest band on earth-popularitywise that may be true,but there is so much that your average joe doesn't get a chance to hear on the radio.that is totally the case with floyd's big albums(dark side,the wall,wish you were here)and their just-as-good-if-not-better albums(more,piper @ the gates of dawn,obsured by clouds,ummagumma).<br />so by all means,get dark side of the moon,but also delve into the &quot;unpopular&quot; albums too.
6305327041|3.0|With 4 directors and a cast of over 20 actors {all talented}, this movie was bound to flop. Antonio Banderez makes a great appearance and Madonna and Quentin Terentino {and} Bruce Willis were good too. The script seems confusing, the directors all have completely different views and styles, so it's confusing. But it is still funny, the bellhopper was excellent, really funny guy. Madonna, who was only in the first fifteen minutes, was blamed for the badness of the movie, stop hating just because she's one of the only people in this movie who don't cuss up a storm and stay fresh and to the point! And as for Quentin, it was a nice cameo, but you're a lot better behind the camera...
B000002J09|4.0|Led Zeppelin IV can be described as a powerful force involved in the beginning of rock.

B0000A1RJI|4.0|Clearly Hans Zimmer was heavily influenced by the Planet compositions of Gustav Holst, but his Pirates of the Caribbean soundtrack was also heavily influenced by another composition.  One of his own.  And I do not mean Gladiator.  While you can tell that Gladiator is a Zimmer project, it doesn't that closely resemble POTC.  At least not as much as Crimson Tide.  If Zimmer was self-derivative it was of his score for the 1995 submarine movie.  In fact, you don't have to listen too closely to a side by side comparison of the two to hear HUGE similarities.  The entire main theme of the score for POTC and Tide are almost identitical.  I am sure I am not the only one to notice this.  I do not mean to take anything away from his most recent creation, but Zimmer (or his seeming nom du plume, Badelt) is getting quite repetitious.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|This is the only documentary film to make it on to my list of 470+ non-fiction books relevant to national security &amp; global issues.  It is superb, and below I summarize the 11 lessons with the intent of documenting how every military person, and ideally every citizen, should view this film.<br />As the U.S. military goes through the motions of &quot;transformation&quot; while beset by the intense demands of being engaged in a 100-year war on six-fronts around the world, all of them against asymmetric threats that we do not understand and are not trained, equipped, nor organized to deal with, this film is startlingly relevant and cautionary.<br />LESSON 1:  EMPHATHIZE WITH YOUR ENEMY.  We must see ourselves as they see us, we must see their circumstances as they see them, before we can be effective.<br />LESSON 2:  RATIONALITY WILL NOT SAVE US.  Human fallibility combined with weapons of mass destruction will destroy nations.  Castro has 162 nuclear warheads already on the island, and was willing to accept annihilation of Cuba as the cost of upholding his independence and honor.<br />LESSON 3:  THERE'S SOMETHING BEYOND ONESELF.  History, philosophy, values, responsibility--think beyond your niche.<br />LESSON 4:  MAXIMIZE EFFICIENCY.  Although this was McNamara's hallmark, and the fog of war demands redundancy, he has a point: we are not maximizing how we spend $500B a year toward world peace, and are instead spending it toward the enrichment of select corporations, building things that don't work in the real world.<br />LESSON 5:  PROPORTIONALITY SHOULD BE A GUIDELINE IN WAR.  McNamara is clearly still grieving over the fact that we firebombed 67 Japanese cities before we ever considered using the atomic bomb, destroying 50% to 90% of those cities.<br />LESSON 6:  GET THE DATA.  It is truly appalling to realize that the U.S. Government is operating on 2% of the relevant information, in part because it relies heavily on foreign allies for what they want to tell us, in part because the U.S. Government has turned its back on open sources of information.  Marc Sageman, in &quot;Understanding Networks of Terror&quot;, knows more about terrorism today than do the CIA or FBI, because he went after the open source data and found the patterns.  There is a quote from a Senator in the 1960's that is also compelling, talking about &quot;an instability of ideas&quot; that are not understood, leading to erroneous decisions in Washington.  For want of action, we forsook thought.<br />LESSON 7:  BELIEF &amp; SEEING ARE BOTH OFTEN WRONG.  With specific reference to the Gulf of Tonkin, as well as the failure of America to understand that the Vietnamese were fighting for independence from China, not just the French or the corrupt Catholic regime of Ngo Dinh Diem, McNamara blows a big whole in the way the neo-cons &quot;believed&quot; themselves into the Iraq war, and took America's blood, treasure, and spirit with them.<br />LESSON 8:  BE PREPARED TO RE-EXAMINE YOUR REASONING.  McNamara is blunt here: if your allies are not willing to go along with you, consider the possibility that your reasoning is flawed.<br />LESSON 9:  IN ORDER TO DO GOOD, YOU MAY HAVE TO ENGAGE IN EVIL.  Having said that, he recommends that we try to maximize ethics and minimize evil.  He is specifically concerned with what constitutes a war crime under changing circumstances.<br />LESSON 10:  NEVER SAY NEVER.  Reality and the future are not predictable.  There are no absolutes.  We should spend more time thinking back over what might have been, be more flexible about taking alternative courses of action in the future.<br />LESSON 11:  YOU CAN'T CHANGE HUMAN NATURE.  There will always be war, and disaster.  We can try to understand it, and deal with it, while seeking to calm our own human nature that wants to strike back in ways that are counter-productive.<br />For those who dismiss this movie because McNamara does not apologize, I say &quot;pay attention.&quot;  Theentire movie is an apology, both direct from McNamara, and indirect in the manner that the producer and director have peeled away his outer defenses and shown his remorse at key points in the film.  I strongly recommend the book by McNamara and James Blight, &quot;WILSON's GHOST.&quot;  In my humble opinion, in the context of the 470+ non-fiction books I have reviewed here, McNamara and Bill Colby are the two Viet-Nam era officials that have grown the most since leaving office.  He has acquired wisdom since leaving defense, and we ignore this wisdom at our peril.&quot;  The entire movie is an apology, both direct from McNamara, and indirect in the manner that the producer and director have peeled away his outer defenses and shown his remorse at key points in the film.

B0001DI0FI|5.0|This is a great movie as many of the other reviewers have stated. Id like to comment on the sound quality. The quality is astounding, making you feel a part of the ship and in the middle of the battles. One negative is that the intimate dialogue can be too quiet at times and the contrast between loud and quiet is too much. All in all a great movie. Ive found that some people who found it boring were in the wrong frame of mind for this type of adventure.
B000089CJI|5.0|If there's anything to the clever adage that, &quot;Talking about music is like dancing about architecture,&quot; then trying to describe The Postal Service's &quot;Give Up&quot; would be more along the lines of pantomiming Stonehenge: to do so would be incomprehensible, over-ambitious, and ultimately unsuccessful.  However, to not review this disc would be the greater crime, so here goes.<br />To begin with, the new listener must dispense with all the tired comparisons to other artists we've seen in the 200 previous reviews of this CD.  Those reviewers, well-meaning as they all are, have only managed to parallel one flavor of genius with another (Radiohead, for example).  Searching for traces of Radiohead, U2, or even Beck in &quot;Give Up&quot; will be about as fruitful as looking for the Seattle sound in a Blondie record.  The Postal Service sound represents that unique, unmatchable byproduct that can only come from a beautiful mistake (the Gibbard and Tamborello hybrid).  Forgive my arrogance here, but I think this album will do for the ever-widening and accessible world of electronica what the Beatles did for rock and roll.  That is, &quot;Give Up&quot; will save electronica from itself, bringing a much needed sense of vision to a brand of music which, as of late, has aspired to no greater purpose than that of moving bodies and disengaging minds (a disappointing trend being followed by a lot of the new Trance produced lately).<br />&quot;Give Up&quot; is the impossibly optimistic answer to all the question marks left in the wake of the last thirty years, a confusing, sometimes hopeless smattering of everything from the revolutionary, but tiring Kraftwerk, and the dead-on New Order to the vapid one-trick ponies like Ace of Base.  At a time during electronic music's short history when some may already be tempted to assume we've seen it all (and certainly the Vengaboys were proof enough of that), now come the likes of The Postal Service...which, by the way, should not be considered a strictly &quot;electronic&quot; duo.  To the contrary, these two have simply used the digital medium as a tool in their grander endeavor: good music.<br />Ben's words fit Jimmy's sounds like a glove, though never predictable and frequently addictive.  Songs like the masterful &quot;Brand New Colony&quot; redefine the love song the way Brian Wilson helped reinvent the pop song; it's a tale of devotion and adoration--minus the pomp--rivalled by nothing else out there today.  The first single, &quot;Such Great Heights&quot; and it's commercial follow-up, &quot;The District Sleeps Alone Tonight,&quot; show off the Gibbard-Tamborello craft in all of its glimmering majesty, neither of them running a single second longer than they should.<br />&quot;Sleeping In&quot; and &quot;Recycled Air&quot; are equally devastating in their atmospheric melodies, while still painting emotive portraits using Gibbard's economy of words.<br />The Postal Service, as evidenced in this their uncanny debut, is a sonic miracle, equally comprised of unfettered art and deft science.  If this is any indication of things to come, electronica--and the broader spectrum of pop, for that matter--may still have a fighting chance at life.not be considered a strictly &quot;electronic&quot; duo.  To the contrary, these two have simply used the digital medium as a tool in their grander endeavor: good music.<br />Ben's words fit Jimmy's sounds like a glove, though never predictable and frequently addictive.  Songs like the masterful &quot;Brand New Colony&quot; redefine the love song the way Brian Wilson helped reinvent the pop song; it's a tale of devotion and adoration--minus the pomp--rivalled by nothing else out there today.  The first single, &quot;Such Great Heights&quot; and it's commercial follow-up, &quot;The District Sleeps Alone Tonight,&quot; show off the Gibbard-Tamborello craft in all of its glimmering majesty, neither of them running a single second longer than they should.<br />&quot;Sleeping In&quot; and &quot;Recycled Air&quot; are equally devastating in their atmospheric melodies, while still painting emotive portraits using Gibbard's economy of words.<br />The Postal Service, as evidenced in this their uncanny debut, is a sonic miracle, equally comprised of unfettered art and deft science.  If this is any indication of things to come, electronica--and the broader spectrum of pop, for that matter--may still have a fighting chance at life.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|Finally! I have wanted to own this show on DVD from the very first time I watched the show.  I am a devoted fan of this fantastic WB show.  This is absolutely the best show on television and I never miss it on Tues. nights!  Now I'm fortunate enough to be able to see and revisit the first season anytime I want.  I'm so glad it has finally been released.  The only think that will make it better is when the other seasons come out for purchase!  HURRY PLEASE!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Plus points of the album  - <BR>1. Great pop/ hiphop/ rnb selection of songs.<BR>2. Biggest variety of styles.<BR>3. Great new sounds and dancy beats.<BR>4. A vast improvement from Britney's previous CDs.<BR>5. Better improved lyrics.<BR>6. Only one or two fillers.<br />Minus points of the album - <BR>1. I cannot think of anyone with a worse voice.<BR>2. I wouldn't say singing about sex is maturity. Though not all songs are about sex (Toxic, Shadow, everytime, brave new girl stay away from it. And all the other songs are not like dirty sex songs. They're implied in a better way and the beats almost take your mind away from the lyrics)<BR>3. a couple of songs get boring after a while.<br />This is coming from a music fan who listens to a bunch of diffent people including avril, beyonce, eminem and even bands like Linkin Park and Puddle of mud. So trust me, this is good music. I would give it a 4.25/5 and that's saying something coz i'm very selctive about the kind of music i hear. Whether the good music should be credited to her producers or her, this album is a good pop album and is recommended for all pop fans.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I love this cd! It is very inspiring and deff enpowering.  There is not a single song on the albumn I can honestly say I do not enjoy.  Whenever I have a bad day I put this on my radio and just blast it and sing with it, and when the cd is over I honestly feel better.  For people who doubt this cd and say it is trash perhaps you do not get the theme of the songs she is singing.  She has changed from this young pop icon that people expected because of the Britney Spears fanaticism.  Britney Spears has drastically changed her image through her albumns and with Stripped Christina has done that as well.  She has done music that represents everything she stands for, even if it is at times a little &quot;trashy&quot; as one critic said.  However, Christina is at a phase in her career where she is putting it all out on the line to be herself and that is why I think this cd is so wonderful.  I would strongly recommend it to any person, women especially, who like to be empowered and just feel great after singing along to a wonderful cd.
0375713751|4.0|I was expecting Bridget Jones with kids, but this book turned out to be much more than that. It's the first novel I've read that deals honestly with the impossibility of being completely satisfied at both work and home. With career and parenting both demanding nearly all your time, how do you prioritize?<br />Other reviewers seemed annoyed that Kate has a prestigious, high-paying job, a saintly husband, and adorable kids, but doesn't seem grateful for any of it -- especially when THEY didn't have all that and were managing just fine. If you're expecting Kate to illustrate the plight of the typical working woman, you will be disappointed. Her situation is much better than most and she is not perfect. She relies on her husband to help with the kids and then resents him for it. She admits to spoiling her kids because she feels so guilty about not being around. At times she even avoids her family to get time on her own. Look elsewhere if you want a virtuous heroine who you can identify with completely.<br />The real strength of this book is the questions it brings up about parenting, work, and family relationships. From the hundreds of reviews here, it has obviously struck a chord with quite a few people. It's a great book to read with friends and discuss.

B0001LJCPC|5.0|When I first saw Vol. 1, the first thing I did was go out and buy the soundtrack. While many filmakers tend to use the same tired oldies or the latest chart toppers, Tarantino will bring out the more obscure and musically fascinating material. He definitely has an ear for the music that will best tie into his visuals.<br />     So upon hearing the first soundtrack I wondered how he could top both the film and the soundtrack. Though I feel the films are true equals, it's the Volume 2 soundtrack I can listen to the most without skipping tracks. I remember hearing &quot;Goodnight Moon&quot; by Shivaree on the radio a few years back and loved it, but then it disappeared from the airwaves, so I'm glad to finally have it here. I first heard &quot;Can't Hardly Stand It&quot; on a Cramps albums and never heard the Charlie Feathers version until now. Great stuff. Another favorite is &quot;L'Arena&quot; by Ennio Morricone, a song which I think should be played at graduations, weddings and funerals, listen and you'll see what I mean. And you can't forget Johnny Cash, rest in peace.<br />    There are other great songs too, but these are the  stand-out cuts. And another thing that I appreciated on this soundtrack that I didn't like about the first was the lame RZA rap. It seemed too misplaced on the Vol. 1 soundtrack and it was always something I had to skip over. On Vol. 2 RZA is back but is buried in the back of the CD as a hidden track. It's good that I can listen to the whole album without the interruption of that garbage. <br />    There are some songs from the movies that didn't make either of the CDs, but all the ones that stick in your head are here. And I assume somewhere down the line a more comprehensive soundtrack will come down the pike. But don't let that keep you from getting this. There's too much great music, and variety at that, to miss out on.
B0000VD04M|5.0|I have watched this movie probably 100 times and can never get enough.  I cannot believe it hasn't been released on DVD yet.<br />The portrayal of Ed Wood is of a guy that never gives up even though he is terrible.  Ever the optimist and the king of spin.  He gives his pre-released version of 'Glen or Glenda' to a producer.  When ED is told it's the worst movie the producer has ever seen---Ed's answer, \\"My next one will be better!\\"<br />When Ed is told that Bela will be kicked out of re-hab due to lack of insurance---Ed goes to Bela and tells him, \\"The tests all came back great---you can go home now.\\"  <br />Ed is a testament that it is more important to be positive and tenacious----rather than good.<br />Martin Landau REALLY deserved this Oscar.  Like another reviewer said, he becomes Lugosi.  I really feel Martin's portrayal of Bela more than I have ever felt any on-screen performance---ever.  He brings me to tears almost every time.  It's heartbreaking, funny and perfect in every single way.  <br />From getting the whole crew baptized to finance a movie----to parading around the set in a wig and a dress.  It's a great movie.<br />Enjoy!
0316666343|5.0|Novels are supposed to make you feel things. The Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold makes you feel lots of things...wonderful and horrible...The sign of a successful novel.<BR>Taking a disturbing theme, the rape and murder and dismemberment of a fourteen year old girl is horrible...allowing her a view from heaven where she can oversee the lives of her loved ones and friends and even her perpetrator is wonderful for readers to witness...hope in the face of horror...isn't that what any of us ever want when having to deal with tragedy and hopelessness...<BR>Outstanding!
B0000004V2|3.0|Let me put my very life on the line and be one of the few to pose my confusion at the generally high (sometimes top, as in Observer Music Monthy's latest top 100 list) ranking of this record. It should be said first that the Brits consider this their all-time best, without Fool's Gold on it (an American release inclusion). I love that track, as well as I Wanna Be Adored, but everything in between sounds rather mediocre to my ears, and I consider myself a pretty serious music lover. when I back up and listen to it in its entirety, I just cannot put it up against any of the other nine records on OMM's list. Even Metal Box (number 10) with it's stunning fidelity tops the comparatively muddied recording of this debut. Time will put it in its place eventually, but that's not to slam it. It just doesn't stand out to my ears. I mean, Bye Bye Bad Man doesn't stand up to anything on, say, Astral Weeks (rated number 4 on the list). I'd put Tomorrow Never Knows, that singular track from the second place record against the entire Stone Roses' record.
6305648522|5.0|I have not seen the \\"new Director's cut\\" version, and based on what the other reviewers have been saying, I'm so very glad. This movie has always had a special place in my film heart. <br />The theme of love has never really been so subtly and wonderfully dramatized. And the love is on so many levels: love for the opposite sex, love for filmmaking, love for family, love for one's hometown, etc. The plot is deceivingly simple and traditional but there are elements that are very unique. What particularly appeals to me isn't just the developing relationships among the main characters, but the relationships going on among the townsfolk. The extras are not anonymous here: all the patrons of the Cinema Paradiso have a slim storyline that are quite amusing. (In one sequence, a young couple are kissing. Next time we see them they're doing something more than just kissing. By the end of the film, they have a family in tow.)<br />Anyway, the story aside, CINEMA PARADISO is so gorgeously filmed, it's so pleasing to the eye that it's almost unbearable. This is a film for lovers of film and filmmaking.

B00005JKCH|5.0|Spider-Man is a great action movie based on the comic book that has an excellent story to back up the action.  Peter Parker is your average high school student until one day on a field trip to a museum, he is bit by a genetically enhanced spider.  After being bitten, he begins to notice things have changed since he is now toned and does not need to wear glasses anymore.  Peter then discovers that he can shoot webs from his wrist.  Soon enough, Peter has morphed into Spider-Man as he begins to battle crime in New York City.  Along the way, he must battle Green Goblin who begins terrorizing the city.  At the same time, he must try and live his life while also concealing his identity.  This was a great superhero action movie with great fight scenes, especially the showdown between Spidey and the Green Goblin.  What makes this movie better than your average action movie is the story.  You get to know the characters rather than just seeing them as comic book stereotypes.  Highly recommended viewing.<br />  Spider-Man has an excellent cast whom all give excellent performances.  Tobey Maguire stars in the title role as Spiderman/Peter Parker.  The transformation he makes on screen from high school student to superhero is fully believable.  Willem Dafoe is great as Green Goblin/Norman Osborn, who is torn between himself and his evil alter-ego.  Kirsten Dunst is perfect as all-American girl, Mary Jane Watson, Peter's secret crush.  In a very good supporting role, James Franco plays Peter's friend Harry.  The movie also stars Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris as Peter's Uncle Ben and Aunt May.  Also look out for Spider-Man creator Stan Lee in a scene where the Green Goblin attacks the city.  Rather than go through all of the extras on the 2-Disc DVD, I'll just say that if you enjoyed the movie you will love the huge range of extras offered on the DVD.  For a great superhero movie with a great story, impressive action scenes, and an even better cast, check out Spider-Man!
B000002IP1|2.0|With colours Collins turns out a quality piece of music making this album better then what came before and theres some big talents on the songs but thats still not saying much as theres a weak cover of The Temptations I Wish It Would Rain Down as well as weak matearial elsewhere.
B000077VR3|5.0|I would say you'll either love this movie or hate it. But I think it's quite good! I think I fell in love with the music first! The music is AWESOME! There's just the right amount of humour and a sad but beautiful love story in this movie. Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman are wonderful (with the acting AND the singing!)! I would recommend getting this movie from the library or borrowing it from a friend before buying it though.
B000002I8D|1.0|Phils reliance on the drum mashine after the Genesis album And Then There Were Three weakened his ability as a drummer thereafter. Here he plays very simplistically. Phil found himself in his career linked with Peter Gabriel successfully but Gabriel wins hands down as a good artist with his expressive voice and as a top notch multitalented musician and diverse songwriter. Phil struggles with his words when he sings, plays little besides drums and not particularly well and writes simple compositions making his music passable.
B000063DFS|5.0|One of Ozzy's best albums ever.  You can really hear Zack finding his style on this record, especially on tracks like S.I.N., Hellraiser, and I don't want to change the world.  Ozzy seems more focused on the record, and delivers a career performance on this record.  The album has a good flow of heavy riff rockers, and smooth ballads filled with catchy melodies and screaming solos.  If you are a new fan of Ozzy and haven't had a chance to hear this record, you should buy it today.
B000002IG4|1.0|Very few artists have made abums this bad. The thing about Phil is he included covers on many of his albums as if he could not be inspired enough to write all his own songs and even did the covers poorly and focused on quantity or more then quality. If you want to hear a good artist focussing on the opposite get Security by Peter Gabriel released the same year as this absolute rubbish.
B00000K19E|5.0|this movie has it all  kung - fu , shoot outs , hacking , a plot , and a mind  melting thrill ride .

B00004RJ74|5.0|From Dusk Till Dawn is one of my all time favorite films.<BR>The story which I won't tell because I don't want to spoil it for people who haven't seen it stars George Cloony and the Brilliant writer and director of Pulp Fiction, Quinten Tarantino.<br />The story is quite amusing and very WELL ACTED I might add.<BR>This was my favorite Cloony film.  It's a very odd Vampire flick too.  The gecko brothers are f-d up.  Especially Tarantino's character.  <br />This is an awesome film for people who want to see something f-d up.<br />A word of a warning.  This movie is incredibly and I mean incredibly graphicly violent in so much ways.  You see Limbs and heads being cut off and sliced off, and some times disturbing.<BR>It's also high on language.  You'll probably here cloony say the F word probably atleast 70 times.<br />Over all it's not a film for little ones.<BR>check it out.<br />Later
1592400876|5.0|I read the British version of this book first, and I have to say, it's funnier in its &quot;original language.&quot; I never thought a book on punctuation would be funny, but after reading an excerpt in a British newspaper, I made a special trip out to buy it. I was laughing out loud the whole way home while reading it on the plane.<br />I suppose the book is not funny if you don't think there's anything wrong with misplaced punctuation, but if you do, this book is a treat!
B00005OAIE|5.0|I'm surprise at how negatively (almost bitter) the Editorial Review was written. Although John Mayer may sound a bit like Dave Matthews I think that's where it ends. His music is distinctly his own. Some of the lyrics (in this CD and also in Heavier Things) are absolutely beautiful and not cryptic. His music is easy to listen to - the kind of music you'd want to chill out with on a lazy Sunday morning. Also he has an uncanny ability to iterate my own feelings and thoughts about things... and not just me - several people I've spoken to say the same thing. I think he's fabulous! If you want a complete library of good music this is a &quot;must have.&quot;
B0001ZX0OM|4.0|I just finished watching the DVD version of this movie and I must say that although I do not like the message of this movie it left me feeling empty and heartbroken meaning it was compelling and a darn great movie.<BR>I thought the acting was superb and the ending was very unexpected for me. You will start out having feeelings for certain people in this movie and by the end all your feelings will change.<BR>I did not however like the vicious, cold, callus speech given by Sean Penn's wife at the end of the movie. I found it out of place and over the top evil.<BR>It is definately a tradegy and not for people prone to depression. It will make you question your faith in humans basically.<BR>This movie will depress and break your heart. If you can handle the fact that there is not always justice in life then you should be able to handle this gloomy ending.<BR>Despite it all I have to say that the fact that it affected me so must mean it has struck a chord, though one I didn't need struck...
B0000CDLA7|5.0|OK, folks... As a new DT fan, I don't have the history of following the band through all of their ups and downs, micro-analyzing every note, kick-drum and power chord. In fact, I just, in the past 2 weeks have become keenly aware of DT and I really like what I hear! However, these are musicians, not gods. And, as musicans, it's their job to tell it like it is for us, their audience. On ToT, DT does that, in spades. I own IAW and SFAM and now ToT, and very MUCH like the musical maturity that DT is displaying here. Let's be honest... IAW, while a very laudable first &quot;major&quot; release, was basically Queensryche and Slaughter done VERY well! It rocked! SFAM was absolutely BRILLIANT!! Prog metal at it's finest! Now, ToT explores a leaner, meaner sound. I, too, wondered where the keys went to, but, they're there, adding just the right touch to temper the buzz-saw of the guitars. Drums... well, I think are a tad over-played, but not to distraction. Bass, John keeps the low end just right, holding it all together. Now, that's the music. Here's the message: pain, loss, grief, disappointment, addiction. Anybody get that, but me? This is a very angry and hurt album. Typical prog doesn't work with this message. I think that the &quot;uber-heaviness&quot; is appropriate for dealing with these topics. Look below the surface, folks. This isn't a nice tidy concept album. This is, as I agree that one reviewer posted, what Metallica's &quot;St. Anger&quot; should have been but WAY wasn't. I'm not going to nit-pick the songs. It's been done here.But, suffice it to say, that DT has grown up, are now facing their own demons and letting us in on the process. That's what we pay them for. If you want to hear IAW or SFAM, get out those discs and play them. But, this is a terrific album.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|There is no doubt that Avril's voice is still as beautiful as she is. Avril's new album reflects a more mature character, while maintaining the wild charm that one should expect from her. Do not hesitate to listen in on some amazing instrumentals and her unmistakable vocals.

0142004235|4.0|First, a large disclaimer.  I have become a Steinbeck zealot over this past year and have found all of his work fascinating.  I have always gotten to the end of one of his books and wished for more.  And the same holds true for this tome, despite its great length, and as in all of his other books, I feel as if I personally know many of the characters and think of them as acquaintances.<br />Plot review:  As has been mentioned in other reviews, this is supposed to be a metaphor for Cain and Abel, but it is much more than that.  Steinbeck weaves in the philosophy of choosing your own destiny as opposed to accepting your fate, as told in the book of Genesis.  To do this, he weaves together many stories of families and does a masterful job of describing the good and evil found in people.<br />Why I liked this book so much:  The characters!  I wish that I was as powerful with the pen as Steinbeck is so I could properly gush over them.  For example --<br />Kate: is the most vile, evil woman I have ever encountered in literature.  And not because she is hateful, but because she is totally devoid of any scruples or feeling and only seeks her own gain.  She is manipulative and cold and puts on the appropriate facade for whatever it is she is trying to accomplish.  She also recognizes the intelligence in her adversary, and strongly dislikes those who see through her facade.<br />Samuel:  One of the jolliest, wisest, and most inventive characters you could ever hope to meet.  He recognizes his strengths and weaknesses, and he has a thirst for knowledge that is enviable.<br />Lee:  The servant who is actually the cornerstone of the main character's family.  A wise and learned man who can pretty much do anything he puts his mind to and keeps the family afloat when Adam dulls his senses to the world.<br />These characters all play second fiddle in the Cain/Abel story to Adam, Cal, and Aron, but they are the stars of the show in my eyes.<br />The book does lose its way for a little while, in my mind, when Steinbeck spends alot of time describing the Hamilton family.  This part did not add much to the story to me, but I understand he was trying to describe people from his own family in this part.  This part is the only reason I rated the book 4 *s instead of 5, and is but a small detractor.<br />This book will cause you to philosophize about choices in your own life, and the characters will possibly cause you to become as much of a Steinbeck addict as I have become.tle while, in my mind, when Steinbeck spends alot of time describing the Hamilton family.

0394716787|5.0|I bought a copy of this Vintage edition, with exactly the same cover art, new in 1975 - folks that's 29 years ago. It's a massive compendium of virtually all, if not all, of anything that Poe wrote of literary consequence, including short stories (a/k/a the &quot;tales&quot;), poetry, and his only novel (*The Narrative of A. Gordon Pym*).  Although Poe's work in this edition is not organized in exactly the most scholarly order, and, yes, is a tad short on literary criticism -- who cares?  If you're looking for criticism, biography or interpretation, there are dozens of books about Poe to satisfy that need.  But if you're looking for a comprehensive &quot;one-stop&quot; source of Poe's works at a great price, this is it.<br />I have acquired and tossed hundreds of books in the past 29 years, but I have hung onto this volume.  The inclusion of the complete *Narrative of A. Gordon Pym* alone is worth the price of the book.  In addition to the more commonly anthologized stories like &quot;The Murders in the Rue Morgue,&quot; &quot;The Pit and the Pendulum,&quot; &quot;The Black Cat,&quot; &quot;The Tell-tale Heart,&quot; and &quot;The Cask of Amontillado,&quot; you'll find lesser known gems like the nightmarish &quot;William Wilson,&quot; one of the best &quot;doppelganger&quot; stories ever written.  If you've never read Poe before, his style is distinctly 19th century and may pose an impediment to some readers.  Old fashioned or not, he remains the master of this genre. This particular edition offers all the proof you'll ever need and many hours of reading pleasure.
B00005JLYW|2.0|I do think this movie is bad, but not just because of its minimal plot and shameless fanservice. A dumb movie can be good, if it knows its crowd and doesn't take it itself too seriously, but this movie has an element of extreme _strangeness_ which makes it impossible to enjoy. The pacing and the dialogue are all wrong. It doesn't seem to know what effect it wants to have, and jokes are delivered in a bizzare deadpan fashion which forbids laughter. Also it clips along at a fairly breakneak speed, giving no pause for laughter; one joke (which isn't really funny anyway) is piled on top of another, as though to compensate for quality with volume. Then there's the plot, which tries too hard to actually exist and keeps distracting from the action. Information is always being introduced by way of some clumsy exposition, in a way that makes you feel you should be paying attention, even though you know the plot doesn't matter. Then there's the tone. That indecision is really what characterizes Full Throttle. You don't know what you're supposed to take seriously. It just can't strike the right balance between comedy and drama. There are moments near the end which are really grotesque or depressing, and they just take all of the force out of the jokes, but then the jokes make it impossible to take the drama seriously.<br />Still, the overall production is impressive, and it does have a few nice moments (the menacing Irish gangster, about as out-of-place in this movie as a classy villain like Hannibal Lechter would be), and John Cleese as Lucy Liu's father in a typically good performance. It might just be worth seeing, if only to see the unique way in which they managed to botch it.
0689859368|4.0|What better place to begin a children's fantasy series than a mysterious, run-down old Victorian? Anyone that knows anything about Victorians knows that they have enormous storytelling potential, as many of the larger, older ones have attics and crawl spaces galore. A perfect place for faeries, good or bad, to be hiding out, and for children to go exploring.<br />For a twin, poor Jared Grace seems oddly the quintessential loner - the typical setup character who sees and believes in the elements of fantasy first, but whom nobody believes. Nevertheless, it's impossible, through both the writing and the deft illustrations throughout, not to have empathy for him. I \\"fell in love with\\" Jared in the first two pages, and maintained that throughout the story, which, while short, was still lively and well paced. Jared, who characterizes himself through the narrator as aimless and not the smart one (the smart one is Simon, his twin), is the character who is determined to solve the clues he is faced with, and upon realization that their families disruption of a faerie creatures habitat is the cause of all of their weird troubles, sets the situation right all by himself.<br />While comparisons to Lemony Snicket are inevitable, I found more similarities to L. Frank Baum, particularly in chapter titles, such as \\"In Which Two Walls are Explored by Vastly Different Methods\\". I particuarly enjoyed the drawing of the boggart in the final scene, as it was reminiscent of Jon O'Neil's wonderful and still (in my opinion) unparalleled artistry in children's books from the Wizard of Oz series. And kids - if you haven't read all of Baum's Oz books, rush to the library or beg your parents to buy them for you here on Amazon (*grin*) for they are amazing and wonderful, and in this most delightful rennaisance of children's fantasy, should not be forgotten. More than one hundred years ago, L. Frank Baum started it all.

It's as though he is the catalyst, melding jazzy riffs and structures with his lyrics that conjure up images of what was, what should have been, what could have been.<br />Even the instrumental tracks evoke a longing, a need for completion, a yin-yang that does not quite fit.<br />How anyone could quibble about the significance of this session escapes me: pairing Nick Drake with peers such as Thompson, Dave Pegg and Dave Mattacks from Fairport Convention; John Cale; and Chris McGregor who contributes some excellent piano on Poor Boy is like a folk-rock dream team.<br />Mr. Drake's delicate vocals and the deft arrangements are the gossamer that binds this session, and \\"Bryter Layter\\" should ultimately be remembered for its myriad strengths instead of a foil for the rest of Mr. Drake's work or as a prescient-laden testimony to Mr. Drake's subsequent depression and death.
078681859X|5.0|It's tricky for an author of any genre to write from multiple view points, for the author runs the risk of one of the view points being unappealing to the reader. Here, both viewpoints were equally appealing (although if my arm were twisted I'd say that I enjoyed Bartimaeus's segments a little better, if only because he was the only one capable of explaining the universe and system of magic best). Stroud is indeed a gifted writer, for not did he succeed as stated above, but he also created characters that we care about (in my opinion, that's the most important job an author has), the plot never stalled, and we are left with a most satisfying conclusion, along with a deep thirst for more.
B0002DKCMQ|2.0|Mathew Carl<br />Well, the movie started off by being totally amazing.  It slowly drifts in to a story about a German girl named Mieke and Scott a beautiful love story.  The movie ends up becoming a story about a robot, some drunken British people, some weird Spanish guy, naked men, insest, and last but not least Hitler.  Although the movie takes some crazy [caraaaazzzzyyyyyy]twists and turns it all turns out to be a terrefic movie with a great ending.  My original review gave this movie a negative 2 out of 10 but Hitler boosted it up to a 4.  So thank you Hitler.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|When I got this cd when it first came out I was pleasently surprised with how good it was.  I have always been a Brit fan and I felt a little disappointed with the single, &quot;Me Against The Music.&quot;  Though that and &quot;Early Mornin'&quot; aren't bright spots on the cd their are songs that make you feel good and want to dance like &quot;Toxic&quot;, &quot;Outrageous&quot;, and &quot;Brave New Girl.&quot;  The best songs on the album by far though are &quot;Everytime&quot; and my personal favorite &quot;Shadow.&quot;  Those two songs prove why Britney Spears is still here six years after releasing her first album.
B0001LJC2K|4.0|When I first heard this album I was immediately turned off by it because the lead singer, Matthew Bellamy, sounds eerily similar to Thom Yorke from Radiohead.  And I'm a huge Radiohead fan.  I thought, here's another band lacking in originality, but hold on.  I was wrong.  Aside from the vocal similarity on some of their tunes, the music stands on its own.  This album is grand in scale, bigger than any Radiohead album. Not to take away from Radiohead's genius.  Absolution is in your face and it dares you to eject the CD once it's been inserted.  Muse can bring the thunder on tracks like &quot;Hysteria&quot;, &quot;Stockholm Syndrome&quot;, &quot;Time is Running Out&quot; and then flip the album on it's back and serenade you with &quot;Endlessly&quot; and &quot;Falling Away With You&quot;.  These guys will be like Tool someday.  No one will pay any mind until they drop a record that becomes an instant classic.  OR, maybe they already have.  Don't be like most Radiohead fans and jump on their fan wagon three albums late (OK COMPUTER).  Join Muse and sing for absolution, NOW.  Trust me, you won't be able to fight the urge.

B0001ZX0PG|5.0|This movie is well deserving of all the attention, accolades, and positive reviews that it received.  Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, and Kevin Bacon, were excellent in this movie.  I even enjoyed Marsha Gay-Harden, Laurence Fishburn, and Laura Tinney.  Sean Penn's performance was deserving of the academy award for Best Lead Male Actor and Tim Robbins for Best Supporting Male Actor.  Sean Penn was especially wonderful in the scene where he screams for his daughter when they discover her body.  Tim Robbins performance was great when he cried for his life and to make things right with his wife.  Marsha Gay Harden was wonderful in her performance.  The acting was exceptional.  How could anyone not like this movie?  Look at the acting.  The story was good also; yet look at the character and the acting.  That made the story.
B0001XAOLQ|5.0|Like another reviewer, I had taped the miniseries when it played on US TV (Bravo?) some years ago in a dubbed version.  It is such a pleasure to have all 5 hours of greatness on DVD.  The added time adds to the richness of the portrait and what a portrait it is.  Although I was a surface skimmer in the Navy (what my submainer friends called a &quot;target&quot;), I can think of no movie that so well captures the danger and the stress that these men faced.  One cannot say enough about the performances, especially the Captain.  No American film has truly captured what naval wartime is about and what it does to the men put in harms way. Only a couple of British films come close.  If you want to see the surface skimmer side take a look at &quot;In Which We Serve&quot; (1942).  A marvelous British film directed by Noel Coward and David Lean.
0140288503|5.0|Black Hawk Down is about the battle on October 3rd, 1993 in Somalia. I won't reveal anything, because I think you should read this wonderful book for yourself. However, if I do say so myself, the message of this book is irreperable, and that is that regular people can do extraordinary things, if they are in a desperate situations. The writing is overall very well done. It is truly a quality book. The book gives you great insight into the battle, but don't take it all from me, read the book.
B0001ZX0PG|5.0|I can understand why many people may feel that Mystic River is overrated, but I disgress.  Everything about the film, from the performances from the entire cast, to Clint Eastwood's super slick direction, is flawless.  Taking place in working class Boston and revolving around three childhood friends in Jimmy (Sean Penn), Dave (Tim Robbins), and Sean (Kevin Bacon); all three of whom are seperated after a tragedy involving Dave, and the murder of Jimmy's teenage daughter years later re-unites them as the clues point to Dave being the perpetraitor while Sean, now a cop, scrambles to stop former thug Jimmy from taking the law into his own hands.  The performances are nothing short of superb, with Penn and Robbins both earning their Oscars, and Marcia Gay Harden (as Dave's wife) earning her Oscar nod.  Eastwood's moody score and Oscar winning screenwriter Brian Helgeland keep the film twisting, the only problem being Helgeland's script doesn't go as in depth as Dennis Lehane's novel, but he did a more than commendable job nonetheless.  This overpriced Special 3-disc edition is scant on the extras, and while Eastwood's score is included, you'd think that he would have done a commentary at least.  That aside though, this is still a fabulous film, and more than worth seeing.
B0000004V2|2.0|Strangely flat and hollow-sounding, as if the band were an Disneyesque animatronic display created by semi-reptilian archaeologists from a planet 700 light years away who aren't quite sure what music is to demonstrate what they think what pop music might have sounded like on 20th-century Earth.
B00008YJH5|4.0|This is the album to buy if you want to start getting into the Pixies.  <br />I wasn't sure what to think about the album on my first listen.  Then as I listened more, I realized the genius in the simplicity of this album.  The one thing I did notice was the production of the drums.  They sound HUGE.  Steve Albini was at his best with that.<br />Highlights are &quot;Where is My Mind?&quot; &quot;Cactus&quot; and &quot;Bone Machine.&quot;
B00028HBKM|5.0|I took the 9th Grade Sunday School class to see \\"The Passion of the Christ \\" on February 29th and I must say that it was a very intense movie. If you have ever wanted to be there when Christ walked the earth to see for yourself what happened, this movie definitely achieves the objective. The movie starts in the Garden of Gethsemane when Christ is praying and all the apostles fall asleep on him, but you feel like you are there, just as you do throughout the entire movie.<br />This movie also fills a void in the lineup of Christian movies that I have seen since it is the only one which truly makes us appreciate the suffering that Christ underwent for our sake. All other movies I have seen on Christ's Passion tend to sterilize the experience and protect us from the torture that Christ willingly endured for us. I'm glad I saw it. The Stations of the Cross will never again be the same for me; I will never again take them for granted as I have in the past. This is a good thing, and for this reason alone I am recommending the movie to all my friends and family.<br />The scenes involving Christ's torture are very realistically done and very historically accurate. The \\"cat of nine tails\\" that he is scourged with at the pillar is a true reproduction of the device used not only by the Romans, but by seafaring captains in the days of sailing ships as well. In my opinion, a teenager should be able to watch and appreciate Christ's suffering in this movie, but pre-teens should wait. It's simply too much for them.<br />The reports we all heard of the films' anti-Semitism are very baffling. Not once during the entire film did it ever occur to me that I was watching any anti-Jewish bigotry. On the contrary, the real bad guys - who seemed to enjoy everything they were doing to Jesus - were the Romans. These are the guys I wanted to kick in the groin. Too bad none of them are left.<br />The bottom line is that this is not a movie you will enjoy, but it is a movie you will appreciate, and I feel that it will move you closer to Christ by making you able to appreciate his suffering more than you ever have in the past.e, and I feel that it will move you closer to Christ by making you able to appreciate his suffering more than you ever have in the past.

1594200106|1.0|I was thrilled when I first bought this book--it sounded as though it had everything. However, as I proceeded through it, I was bored by far, far too many details, not nearly enough suspense or interest, and a plot that used virtually every literary cliche imaginable.  I finished it only because it galls me not to finish a book and at least give it a fair try.  Overall, it could have been a  much better book if the unnecessary details were eliminated and the plot were stronger and less superficial.
0385336810|5.0|this was a great, fun, breezy read...i couldn't put it down!  if you liked sophie kinsella's other books, this is written in a very similar manner and is just as entertaining.  i like how sophie kinsella writes &quot;chick lit&quot; in a very entertaining manner where there actually is a plot--something that is lacking in other recent &quot;chick lit&quot; that i have read.  definitely go pick this up, it is worth it!!
037571457X|5.0|Cultural relativists as far back as Sextus Empiricus or Michel Montaigne, or as recent as William Graham Sumner or Gilbert Harman, often make compelling arguments that there are no objective standards for judging other societies/beliefs. Yet Marjane Satrapi's Persepolis achieves in 153 pages what cultural relativists deny as possible and what most political pundits can never fully articulate: an informed and justifiable criticism of an existing cultural paradigm. Satrapi's method is deceptively simple: by using her own life stories as the premise, Satrapi builds an argument for criticizing culture.<br />Satrapi's autobiographicalized[1] self and society act both with wisdom and foolishness both before and after the revolution. The Iranian revolution meant to replace an unpopular government with one more responsive to the people's will. Until reading this book, I was unaware of any particular details of Iran during their revolution - mostly because I am a Westerner and generally not privy to accounts of day-to-day life in the Mid-East. On that basis, the cultural relativists may be right that I have no foundation on which to critically analyze the current state of Iran. Thankfully, however, Satrapi can criticize - using both an insider's and outsider's perspective. Satrapi undermines the denial of standards posited by cultural relativists by showing the reader that standards of comparison do indeed exist: standards related to varying degrees of freedom of expression, of decision, and from coercion. Satrapi's criticism is much more subtle than \\"old way good, new way bad.\\" Instead, she draws for the reader situation after situation where real people are swept along with the flash flood of a revolution. Satrapi, having come of age in the midst of such a flood, is able to compare her pre- and post-revolution home and draw for the reader how the people she knew dealt with that change and what they thought of it.<br />Satrapi's art maintains a consistent, iconic style throughout the book. This allows the reader to identify more fully with the story's characters and makes for a gripping narrative flow. This iconic style is also important in reaching an audience unaccustomed to graphic novels and the myriad ways in which their authors approach narrative (Art Spiegelman's Maus is a prime example of an iconic style's appeal). What really makes Persepolis an artistic tour-de-force, however, are the more experimental panels that Satrapi intersperses into the basic narrative frame she establishes. These larger, and more visually stunning, panels interrupt the narrative, slowing (in some instances stopping) the reader in his or her tracks, drawing him or her into the intricacies of the panel. This interspersion is a type of reader manipulation especially featured in comix. There are an abundance of examples of this technique in Persepolis - panels 15.2, 29.4, 42, 102.1, and 116 are but a few. Panels 10.5, 11.1, and 11.2, in particular, defy, yet wholly contain, prosaic description, poetic symbolism, dramatic interaction, and cinematic imagery. <br />Satrapi seems to suggest in this work that the way to bring peoples together is to allow an exchange of their cultural ideas. At times, it may appear that the unrestrained steamroller of Western culture threatens anything in its path. But is that really the case? Satrapi seems to hint that a people left free to first experience, then to choose, whether to accept or reject another culture's offerings are always better off than a people punished for experiencing other cultures. She presents with compassion her life in that earlier Iran and draws it for the reader through the filter of her current life in Western culture. She doesn't champion one culture while condemning another. She shows, through autobiography, what works and doesn't work when it comes to governing groups of human beings.<br />[1]-  This phrase refers to the separation of the author as an entity from the literary self they createfor a reader through autobiography.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|I was told to go rent this movie out by a friend and I'm soooo glad I did, okay the first time I watched it I got abit lost but the second time round it makes sense and see how wonderfully touching it is.<br />Its good to see a movie that aint like anything else! And with the star studded cast its definately worth a watch. Always been a big fan of Ewan Mcgregor and I gotta say this is one of the best films Ive seen him do.Albert Finney is just wonderful.Billy Crudup, Jessica Lange, Robert Guillaume, Danny De Vito, Helena Bonham Carter, and Alison Lohman all make this film simply beautiful...<br />This Tim Burton Movie has his magic to make it work. Its a heart warming film with some great morals behind it. <br />Big thumbs up from me.
B00005MP58|4.0|after watching this a second time (a yr later), i have a slightly different opinion. i still think it's wonderfully entertaining, but i think the characterisation is a little too modern. the women, especially, are too forward: they lack the manners and decorum that one would expect in the gentry of that time. in this sense, the bbc production comes closer to the mark. but it's still a very good show.
B00024I31C|4.0|I Love the Music  on this CD, but the booklet only has lyrics four out of the 13 songs. Those four songs are: &quot;One Step,&quot; &quot;Stone River.&quot; &quot;The Problem,&quot; and Homeless.&quot;  I may have to search for a website to find the rest of the lyrics.
B00008CLOA|5.0|First of all, where is all that crap about Brittney coming from? She has nothing to do with this. Anyways, this is a really great cd in my opinion, which is just that my opinion.You should understand, Even though Pink floyd is considered classic rock, in my opinion it is more &quot;Prog&quot; or progressive rock. Dont buy this expecting Led Zepplin or Jimi hendrix sounding guitar driven songs with a mad solo every song. Here are the songs and a short reveiw of Each<BR>1. Speak to Me/Breathe- After the minute of sound effects, it launchs in to a good song with pretty meaningful lyrics if you actully listen to them. In my opinion, the music feels like the perfect music to get stoned to.<BR>2, On the Run - an instrumental song with real ahead of it time technology &quot;old scholl techno as i call it&quot;. My least favorite on the cd. IMpressive for its time, but not much value now.<BR>3. Time - The best song on the album if you ask me. It requires patience to get through (something hard to come by). Im warning you, there are no words for almost 3 minutes(some people do not have an attention span of that long). One the more Rockin songs on the record, it also features a mega cool guitar solo from Mr. Gilmour. <BR>4. The great Gig in the Sky - an instrumental with a woman singing (not in words) in the background. Featues some nice piano work by Wright. Once again, very far away from Zepp.<BR>5. Money - The most Classic Rockish song on the album, with the advanced(for time) sound effects, catchy bass line, and of course, ultimatly cool solos from Gilmour and a saxaphone dude.<BR>6. Us and Them - An anti war song with subtle lyrics that do have meaning. The music is very jazzy, so obviously if you dont like jazz and smooth sax solos, you probably wont like this song. <BR>7. Any Colour You Like - Another instrumental. Very Pshycodielic (spelt wrong, i know) sounding. Feature a keybord and guitar(with underwater effect) solo.<BR>8. Brain Damage - a song about an insane person. I like the chorus, it seems to have a lot of power. All in all a good song.<BR>9. Eclipse - A short song that sums up the theme of the album. It also brings back all the musical elements that weve heard through out. A more rocking song than most. <br />Also, understand that when I say &quot;Rockin&quot; i dont mean AC/DC style. Gilmour really didnt use much distortion on most of these songs, and the guitar sometimes cant be heard. <BR>Biggest Warning: These songs are mainly slow and complex, they take patience and a long attention span, if you lack either of these, I dont recomend this album. By the way, it isnt just for stoners.
B00008BRB5|5.0|wow!i am unable to get enough words to shower praise on this great album featuring my best songs every breath you take and wrapped around your finger.highly recommended
B000003TA4|5.0|I observed a ton of negative reviews prior to buying this album.  And BEFORE ever buying the album.  What can I say... the album is awesome. &quot;Lounge Act&quot; is my personal favorite.  &quot;Something in the Way&quot; accounts the life of a homeless man in a big city and it's quite fitting.  There are classics that EVERYONE had heard a few million times.  But I can't quite grasp the negative reviews.  This album introduced me to the emotional complexities of Nirvana.  It made me find &quot;Unplugged&quot; which is one of the BEST albums of the last 25 years.  Dispute if you may, but Nirvana is an INCREDIBLE band.
B0000541AM|4.0|It is difficult to take Walter Hill's 1979 classic &quot;The Warriors&quot; seriously today. Ostensibly a picture about various street gangs in New York City, the movie paints a rather quaint, almost cartoonish portrait of crime in the Big Apple. I knew from the start the movie wasn't going to give us a gritty interpretation of the thug lifestyle. Why? A gang traveling to a big summit in the Bronx takes time out of their busy schedule to purchase and then feed subway tokens into the turnstile so all the members can board the train. How's that for a big, bad group of street goons? I imagine now that a gang doing this would be marked for extermination just on the principle of the thing. Still, that doesn't mean &quot;The Warriors&quot; isn't entertaining; it is, massively so. It's so entertaining, and made such a big splash at the time, that Italian filmmakers began ripping it off in their low budget films. &quot;The Bronx Warriors,&quot; for example, contains several scenes obviously lifted from this movie. The only difference is that Hill's movie manages to work despite its flaws while the Italian effort looks unconvincingly cheesy. Whatever your take on this movie, we must admit it has been influential.<br />The plot is simplicity itself. A gang from Coney Island called the Warriors gets an invite to attend a massive rally twenty-seven miles away. All the big gangs in the city will be there, including the Riffs, the most powerful band of street thugs in New York. The leader of the Riffs, Cyrus, plans to consolidate the various crews of street criminals under his benevolent rule. Through a mix of charisma and charged oratory-lots of &quot;can you dig it&quot; thrown around for the benefit of the goons-Cyrus brings the crowd to its feet. Unfortunately for him and for the Warriors, Luther (David Patrick Kelly), with his gang called the Rogues, assassinates Cyrus in the middle of his speech. In the resulting chaos the Warriors take the blame for the murder. Even worse, the leader of the Warriors, Cleon (Dorsey Wright) falls in the resulting melee. The rest of the Warriors make a run for it, now with Swan (Michael Beck) leading the gang. Every street thug in the city wants a piece of the Warriors, especially the Riffs. Swan and his crew must make it back to Coney Island before falling prey to the Turnbull AC's, the Lizzies, the Orphans, the Baseball Furies, the Boppers, the Rogues, and a hundred other gangs big and small. Too, the men in blue wish to ask the Warriors a few questions about Cyrus's sudden demise.<br />The rest of the film recounts the Warriors' journey home. Their efforts center on the subway, but everyone else knows this is the method the hunted crew will take. Every time the Warriors finally get on a train, some incident arises that stops them cold. A fire on the track forces the crew to make their way to the next train on foot, opening them up to the murderous retribution of the other gangs. In one neighborhood, our heroes run up against a &quot;minor league&quot; gang called the Orphans and a mouthy harridan named Mercy (Deborah Van Valkenburgh), and must battle their way free. An encounter with the cops at the subway forces the Warriors to split up. Eventually, a few of the members fall prey to other gangs, to the police, or narrowly escape doom at the hands of knife and gun wielding women. As if things couldn't get worse, a radio disc jockey (Lynne Thigpen) sends out artfully coded messages about the location of the Warriors, thereby urging other thugs to join in the free for all. Will the surviving members of the Warriors get home in the end? And will it really matter if they do?<br />Xenophon's &quot;Anabasis,&quot; the tale of a band of Greeks caught behind Persian lines that had to battle their way back home, forms the basis of Hill's &quot;The Warriors.&quot; Everything from naming the king of the gangs Cyrus to the final showdown on the beach comes right out of this ancient Greek text. Most viewers won'tknow this of course (I didn't at first; I read it somewhere), but would be content to merely sit back and watch the antics unfold. You've got gang members dressed like baseball players with painted faces swinging bats in a park, the leader of the Orphans looks like Eric Bogosian with a hangover, and plot holes run through this movie like subway tunnels. The flaws in &quot;The Warriors&quot; are epic in scope. Why, for instance, doesn't the gang simply take a cab or steal a car and get home in a hurry? Are we to assume that a street gang has no money to hire a driver or the ability to hotwire an automobile? Some hoods these guys are! Too, I always thought New York City is the town that never sleeps. Well, the denizens of the Big Apple snoozed the night away when this film was made. No one appears on the streets, no cars drive by, and no one comes out of their apartment buildings to see what's going on. And if the police are so interested in stopping the Warriors, why not just stop the trains from running? It's to the film's credit that despite myriad plot problems, &quot;The Warriors&quot; still works.<br />The DVD's picture transfer looks great. Unfortunately, it is a Paramount release with only a trailer as an extra. That's right; no commentary, interviews, behind the scenes fun, or anything else diehard fans would like to see. While I can't say this is my favorite movie, many people swear by it. It's another example of the larger problem with Paramount's DVD department. &quot;The Warriors,&quot; despite Paramount's lack of attention, is a must have for fans of cult classics.know this of course (I didn't at first; I read it somewhere), but would be content to merely sit back and watch the antics unfold.

B00000K19E|4.0|This movie had to be one of the most over-rated movies of all time.  Let me sum this whole movie up for ya.  \\"You're the ONE\\" That's it.

B0001LJC2K|5.0|This amazing album actually introduced me to Muse. The lyrics are overpowering and poetic and I don't know about anyone else but when a piece of music is that powerful it creates a feeling in your chest, close to breathlessness, as though your heart is not just skipping one but a million beats. This whole album does this for me. 'Time is running out' and 'Hyteria' are both played often our local rock club at University (The Dome aka Route 66 in Portsmouth), resulting in a mad frenzy of moshing! I have been plenty bruised and blooded to this song!Fond memories! 'Stockholm syndrome' is another one of my favourites with an incredible guitar solo at the beginning which sets you up for the even better one later on in the song. The chords are almost magical as they wash over you and take you to another place. 'Falling Away With You' starts off as an acoustic piece giving you a false sense of what the song's style is as it becomes thicker in texture and becomes more desperate, melodic and so more beautiful.Another one of my favourites, 'Butterflies and Hurricanes' displays moving lyrics, desperate and pleading with an interesting piano solo in the middle, breaking rules, seeming to end the song but only interluding it, with a lingering chord leading into almost silence before the lyics begin again. Breathtaking! The musical talent is clear and developed, especially the guitar solos and Thom Yorke's individual and powerfully lingering voice, laced with angst and despair.The lyrics in all the songs reflect the artists' obvious deep thinking in the composition of the songs, voicing issues that are obvoiusly close to heart and personal, which is why this album is so exceptional.

B000268QB2|5.0|I'm amazed at the number of comparisons with other bands based on geography!! 'Hopes and Fears' merits purchase based on its quality.  It's well produced, with Tom Chaplin's amazing voice working with the instruments - not against them (more noticeable on the ballads than the up-tempo stuff).  This is the best debut album of the last five years.

1558908498|5.0|Scream 2 is a million times better than the first Scream, which was teribble. The killer is no longer a wimpy teen like in the last film. This film is aimd to an older audiance( the first was aimed to the teens) which I think was good and it really worked for this one. This plot is about someone who saw a movie called Stab, a film based on what happened in the first Scream, and the film drives him mad and makes him turn into a killer. Okay, I know that sounds like a bad plot on papr, but it's much better on screen. They don't make fun of the old movies as much as they did in the first one( the( the orignal was trying to be serios, not like Scary Movie). If you enjoyed movies like Halloween, then you should like this. Much better than the first movie.

It was a very compelling story, and the two main characters were developed extraordinarily well.<br />But I found it ultimately unsatisfying.  There was a major issue that was unresolved, and I felt that it needed to be explored in greater depth - especially Melanie's understanding of this issue.<br />I also felt that the relationship between Gus and Michael could have been explored in greater detail.<br />It was almost as if the author was under time pressure to get this finished, and did not have the time to fully wrap up some key details that had been introduced.<br />Still, it was a good read and I would recommend it without hesitation.
B00004VVND|4.0|If WESTWORLD was made today, the guests would more than likely be taking virtual reality trips into their fantasy worlds.  Given that this film is over thirty years old, however, one must credit author-director Michael Crichton with his imaginative premise.  WESTWORLD is still an entertaining film, but seems a little dated in its concepts.  However, it entertains and Yul Brynner as the gunslinger is icily effective.  I would have liked to know a little more about James Brolin and Richard Benjamin's characters, so that more empathy could have been invoked for them.  Some glaring plot holes, though:  why would the park give the gunslinger a gun that could actually kill?  Why would they trap their technicians in a room without emergency power or exits?  And what happened to Dick Van Patten's sheriff character?<br />A tidy little thriller, that over the years has amassed too much of a classic status.  But it's fun while you're watching and I guess that's what matters most, right?
B00005QK3W|4.0|Only four because that special mysterious something is missing, maybe youth, I don't know. Nonetheless, Paul remains the master of original melodies and chord progressions that he's been for over forty years. Any up and coming songwriter will do himself the most good by learning McCartney's works note for note, and searching for the sense underlying all of it.
B00003CWNR|1.0|Sorry, I couldn't get past Michael Caine the kindly orphanage director who converts unborn babies into hamburger in his spare time. We're all grown ups here, so let's cut the euphemisms and follow the logic. If unborn children are better off dead than being orphans, why doesn't the orphanage director kill off the orphans? Would they be better off dead or not?<br />Of course, the image of a kindly abortionist is off-putting and dissonance-inducing for anyone with half a brain. I'm very active in the pro-life movement, have done volunteer work with a crisis pregnancy center, and have talked to former abortionists. They're not nice people, at least they weren't before their conversions. How could they be?<br />If you're not appalled by the fact that doctors who are supposed to preserve human life accept money to cut children into pieces and reassemble their bodies to make sure that no body parts are left inside, then you might be appalled by the fact that abortionists have little regard for their clients' health, and that they often perform abortions on non-existent babies, just to collect $300 in cash. <br />Such loveable rogues.<br />The rest of the movie isn't much better, and very disappointing considering Hallstom's earlier effort, &quot;My Life as a Dog,&quot; a very humane and uplifting movie. My personal favorite.<br />Homer is vacant, and neither sympathetic nor believable. His girlfriend is believable as a human being, but not a person to be admired. <br />The most engaging part of the movie is its rendering of an orphanage in 1940s Maine. Sadly, Planned Parenthood has put these institutions out of business.<br />What John Irving and Planned Parenthood fail to realize is that where evil exists grace abounds even more. If God can take the greatest crime in the history of the world, Christ's crucifixion (deicide), and bring about the the greatest good, the redemption of mankind, then we must trust Him when we suffer. &quot;Take up your cross and follow me&quot;or the abortionists knife. Take your pick.
B0001NBMBC|1.0|The first time I heard Slipknot's first album, I was amazed.  Slipknot had so much talent.  While they lacked creativity, their playing ability surpassed almost everybody.  Slipknot's first album is something to be impressed with.  Iowa came out, and I was pretty disappointed.  Nothing unique, the playing not as tight or complicated, and the lyrics were just immature, but overall still a talented band.  When Volume 3 came out, I was hopeful for something of a higher quality because I heard Rick Rubin produced it (Slayer, Black Crowes, Beastie Boys), but not that hopeful because I've been let down by almost every band that ever existed.     Sure enough, Volume 3 is a total waste of my time.  There is nothing unique or different or interesting in any of the songs.  While the playing is a slice above alot of bands (that isn't saying squat nowadays) the whole package is designed for people who haven't a clue about punk or heavy metal.  Slipknot's Volume 3 is a total wash.  Shame on you Rick Rubin.  I can't say shame on you Slipknot because I just don't think you idiots know any better.
B00000ADG2|5.0|This CD is one of the best CD's I have in my collection. It's like a good poem. No matter how much you hear it, it's always fresh.  I encourage anyone who is even the least bit interested in R&B/Hip Hop to get this album.  Enjoy!
B00009W0U4|5.0|Irreversible is a film that displaces the viewer in such a significant way that to watch it is more akin to dreaming about a real-life experience. The film, through dialogue, actions, and character archetypes, suggests that only way to make sense of and live through the horrific and reversed melodramatic anti-revenge storyline is to view the film through a near existential psychological perspective.  Yipe.  In easier language, the film demands your own removal of pre-conditioned emotional responses to rape, murder, revenge, humor, sexual excitement, intimacy, sadness, rage, and especially blame.  The very beginning of the film features the man from the feature I STAND ALONE telling another man how he messed his own life up...that time destroys all things.  His companion ultimately nay-says this, indicating that any crimes or tragedies are just what they are, nothing more...a series of events.  Noe challenges the viewers to attempt to view Irreversible in that very detached state, not for or against what you see. (nutty camera moves...)  By doing so you will be able to live through the incredibly sad and horrific storyline.  By Noe telling the story in reverse, he rescues the film from melodrama, vengence, or \\"true crime\\" genre BS.  Together, almost in a 50/50 contract deal, Noe and the viewer can attain the meaning of this story about Alex, Marcus, Pierre, the Tenia, ramifications and origins of any and all the events you see in Irreversible.  The result will vary, I believe, from person to person...as it should.  I can only echo other reviews in warning you of the intensity and violence, but the sadness and (yes) beauty of the film's meaning that I derived was phenomenal.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Anyone expecting anything similair to 'Let Go' may be dissapointed. Whereas 'Let Go' was technically a pop record, 'Under My Skin' leans more toward the rockier side of our Canadian queen. Stand-out songs are My Happy Ending (Forthcoming second single), How Does It Feel (Im With You Part 2), He Wasn't (Sk8er Boi Part 2) and Slipped Away (written to Avril's recently deceased grandfather). This is a very good album which in my opinion, surpasses 'Let Go' for overall quality. If this is what Avril has for us in the future then bring on album number 3 !
1400031362|4.0|If you've read the first two of the series (No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency and Tears of the Giraffe), then you will want to read this one...it's a continuation of the stories in the lives of the main characters. I got so involved in the stories of these people and the descriptions of African landscape, that I didn't want it to end. I'm glad there's a fourth book to look forward to.
B000031XCR|5.0|In 1999, Celine had learned that her husband and manager, Renee Angelil, had become diagnosed with throat cancer. Celine was already considering a two-year break, so she and her husband can start a family of their own and so she can see her own family more often, but after learning of Renee's diagnosis, she decided it was time to stop for two years. In doing so, she released her tenth album, All The Way... A Decade Of Song. This is a 16-track album, where the first nine songs are her English-language greatests hits from 1990 to 1998, while the last seven are new songs. It's an amazing album and only Celine Dion has the voice to sing these songs.<br />THE POWER OF LOVE<BR>  From the album The Colour Of My Love (1993). This was originally recorded by Laura Brannigan back in 1988, but Celine Dion gave us the definitive version. I know that what I am about to say is something that I've said a million times, but I have to say it again: This is another song for my late grandfather, only this time, this song was dedicated to him by my grandmother. The lyrics are perfect for the the two of them because they most definitely had The Power Of Love.<br />IF YOU ASKED ME TO<BR>  From the album Celine Dion (1992). This one has always been one of my favorite Celine songs. It's a classic hit all the way.<br />BEAUTY AND THE BEAST (with Peabo Bryson)<BR>  From the original motion picture &amp; soundtrack Beauty And The Beast (1991). From the album Celine Dion (1992). Definitely one of the most romantic Disney songs I've ever heard. Celine and Peabo sing it beautifully.<br />BECAUSE YOU LOVED ME<BR>  From the original motion picture Up, Close, &amp; Personal (1996). From the album Falling Into You (1996). Another beautiful song. This is my mother's dedication to my grandfather and it's the perfect song for her.<br />IT'S ALL COMING BACK TO ME NOW (Single Version)<BR>  Original version from the album Falling Into You (1996). The album version ran to 7 minutes and 37 seconds, while this version runs to 5 and a half minutes and it is known as a power ballad. Both versions are incredibly beautiful and it's the song that made me a fan.<br />LOVE CAN MOVE MOUNTAINS<BR>  From the album Celine Dion (1992). A great song and among the many songs that was written by Diane Warren.<br />TO LOVE YOU MORE<BR>  From the album Let's Talk About Love (1997). I used to love this song, but now I think I wore it out for myself because I don't like it like I used to, but it's still a great song.<br />MY HEART WILL GO ON<BR>  From the original motion picture &amp; soundtrack Titanic (1997). From the album Let's Talk About Love (1997). The Titanic may have sank, but this is a song that cannot sink, no matter how hard you tried to sink it. Her voice has always been known to be one of the most beautiful of voices, but her voice on this one gives Beautiful a whole new meaning.<br />I'M YOUR ANGEL (with R. Kelly)<BR>  From the album These Are Special Times (1998). A beautiful song and another one of my dedications.<br />THAT'S THE WAY IT IS<BR>  New song. Celine has said that she was getting sick and tired of having people write her ballads. She said that she does like ballads and she does enjoy singing them, but she does like up-tempo songs too. Max Martin had written this song with Celine in mind, so when he came to Celine with this song, Celine, excited about it, accepted the offer. It is, indeed, an up-tempo song and a great one.<br />IF WALLS COULD TALK<BR>  New song. Not bad.<br />THE FIRST TIME EVER I SAW YOUR FACE<BR>  New song. Although this is a beautiful song, nobody can do it like Roberta Flack. Roberta's version is the definitive classic.<br />ALL THE WAY (virtual duet with Frank Sinatra)<BR>  New song. This song was originally recorded by Frank Sinatra. Celine had planned to re-record this whole song by herself, but she decided to make it a duet. Being that Frank had already passed on, Celine made this a virtual duet by recording over half of the song he sangand leaving in the other half. She remade this one because it is her and her husband's &quot;song&quot;.<br />THEN YOU LOOK AT ME<BR>  New song. Okay.<br />I WANT YOU TO NEED ME<BR>  New song. Diane Warren has written many great songs for Celine, including, Love Can Move Mountains, If You Asked Me To, I Love You Good-Bye, Nothing But My Broken Heart, Real Emotion, Next Plane Out, The Colour Of My Love, &amp; Because You Loved Me. She has written yet another beautiful song for Celine and it's right here. <br />LIVE<BR>  New song. Not bad.<br />    Celine has given us an incredible greatest hits album and all of you should own it. If not, then buy it, you'll enjoy it.
B000148KK2|1.0|I have been a fan of Diana's since day one and this release is such a disappointment.  She has gone a new direction and it does not work.  The songs seem to have no melody and just seem ponderous.  I have tried to embrace it....it just does not work.
B00005221M|5.0|This is a wonderful movie, and I can't say enough about it.<br />I first seen this movie when I was in high school. I remember my boyfriend forcing me to see this film. I complained during the whole ride to the theater. But, after the first ten minutes I was hooked like a fish.<br />The haunting, visual landscapes are breathtaking, Daniel Day-Lewis is wonderful, and the secondary characters are very good. Essentially, this is a story of change. The Last Mohican represents a changing of lives and cultures. Additionally, the story of the French-Indian war is moving.<br />I cannot list a full synopsis of the movie because there are so many different back stories and themes. There is love, intrigue, deciet, family values, war, and death...and all of it is rolled into one.<br />Everything about this movie is fantastic and very moving. You need to see it for yourself to see what I am talking about. Or, you can listen to the some of the reviewer's recommendations that say this movie is boring and long.<br />I won't kid you there is some slow points, but this isn't an all out action flick.<br />Ultimately, this movie is for people who love real, moving movies.

B00008S2VG|1.0|this has to be one of the most overrated album releases of recent times from the princess of sleaze who is known more for her dirty gimmicks than singing and changing names.the fact that this album tanked worldwide proves that she is slowly becoming irrelavant thankfully.i am looking for the day she retires.anyway this cd is awful.dont buy or listen to it.
B0002858YS|5.0|I first saw the killers when they opened for stellastarr* back in April. I can still remember the concert as people would turn to their friends and just say \\"damn this is good.\\" The Killers put on an awesome show for that reason i counted the days down till the cd came out. This cd is AWESOME! With Jenny was a friend opening the cd hits the ground running, Mr. Brightide, Smile like you Mean it (a song that really grew on me).... There isnt a weak song in there. If you like the Killers look into Stellastarr and Elefant for great and unique rock just as the Killers have accomplished with Hot Fuss.
B00007BH5C|5.0|There are probably over a thousand reviews for the movies, but let's talk about the music of the movies.<br />I have to say that of all the movies, this soundtrack is the best of all three. The haunting string melodies, powerful trumpet melodies, and moving context of the music as a whole is wonderful.<br />I don't normally buy soundtrack scores. But, this is one of the few in my collection.<br />This is a wonderful collection of music.
0553212737|5.0|Emma Woodhouse, \\"handsome, clever, and rich,\\" is the 21-year-old daughter of the elderly owner of Hartfield, the largest estate in Highbury.  Though only a couple of hours away from London by carriage, Highbury regards itself as an isolated and virtually self-contained community, with the Woodhouse family the center of social life and at the top of its social ladder.  Emma, doting on her hypochondriac father, whom she represents to the outside world, has grown up without a mother's softening influence, and at twenty-one, she is bright, willful, and not a little spoiled.  Having too little to do to keep out of trouble, Emma's hobby is matchmaking, \\"the greatest amusement in the world,.\\"  Unfortunately, her sophistication in the social graces does not extend to much insight into human beings.<br /><br />Taking Harriet Smith, a young woman of \\"questionable birth\\" under her wing, Emma makes Harriet her \\"project,\\" educating her in the social graces, convincing Harriet not to marry farmer Robert Martin, who has courted her, and ultimately persuading Harriet, wrongly, that the vicar, Mr. Elton, is falling in love with her.  Bored and without a large circle of \\"suitable\\" friends, Emma is an incorrigible meddler, playing with the lives of those around her, snubbing those she considers inferior, gossiping about others in an attempt to divert attention to herself, and misreading intentions.  Only Mr. Knightly, sixteen years older than Emma and a friend of her father, stands up to Emma and tells her what he thinks of her behavior, and it is through him that she eventually begins to grow.<br /><br />Love and the formal protocol of marriage are a major focus here, with marriage more often a merger of \\"appropriate\\" families than the result of romance or passion.  Class distinctions, acknowledged by all levels of society, limit both personal friendships and romantic possibilities, and as Emma's matchmaking fails again and again, causing grief to many of her victims, Emma begins to recognize that her pride, willfulness, and love of power over others have made her oblivious to her own faults.  Austen shines in her depiction of Emma and her upperclass friends, gently satirizing their weaknesses but leaving room for them to learn from their mistakes-if only they can learn to recognize the ironies in their lives.  Though Emma may be, in some ways, Austen's least charming heroine, she is certainly vibrant and, with her annoying faults, a most realistic one.

0060926317|1.0|\\"Mutant Message Down Under\\" describes the secuestration of a medical worker, who apparently bears an uncanny resemblance to Ms. Morgan, by a tribe of Australian aborigines that are unknown to, and whose existence is apparently unsuspected by, the Australian government.  They train her in tribal lore, advise her of a message for the rest of us on the outside, and send her back to twentieth century reality.  Ms. Morgan states that this is a work of fiction, but makes it clear that she is casting it in a fictional format to protect the identity of the aboriginal tribe that chose her to transmit this sublime message, and that in fact this is a true story.  In creating a book of this sort Ms. Morgan has managed to satisfy several audiences.<br />One audience she pleased is lunatic fringe New Agers who prefer this sort of airy fairy, feel good way of getting in touch with ourselves and Mother Earth, and which unfortunately poses as a serious form of spirituality.  An important subgroup within this species is comprised of those individuals that like stories about UFO abductions; Ms. Morgan should be congratulated on coming up with a new and interesting variation on this rather well-worn theme.  <br />Other readers no doubt found satisfaction that her main character was a middle-aged woman, which is a rare species to find as a protagonist on a mission from God in most extant literature.  It was no doubt this factor that gave the book appeal to Oprah Winfrey, who included it on her list of recommended reads - that and the fact that although it is a whole 224 pages long, the print is large and there aren't too many long words.<br />Unfortunately for Ms. Morgan, it also attracted attention from Aboriginal groups in Australia, along with a number of anthropologists that have worked with Native Australians, and it was clear that whatever Ms. Morgan thought she was describing, she had no idea whatsoever what Aboriginal life was like; in fact, the book is a rehash of derivative literature on Aboriginal life, leavened with some Native American spirituality where the details weren't too clear, maybe spiced with a piquant touch of Bushman lore from Southern Africa, and heavily interlarded with a healthy dose of Ms. Morgan's imagination.<br />That Ms. Morgan should attempt something like this is not too surprising; Carlos Castaneda managed to do the same thing, only he did it much better; in fact, he fooled an entire generation.  James Redfield also did something similar with the \\"Celestine Prophecy\\".<br />The difference between Ms. Morgan on the one hand, and Mr. Castaneda and his Yaquis or Mr. Redfield and his Incas on the other, is that these others were dealing with ethnic groups that largely didn't read English and didn't pay much attention to what is said about them; among Australian Aborigines, however, there is an organized, articulate group that are committed to maintaining their property rights and are very concerned with the image projected about them to the rest of the world.  <br />Ms. Morgan has apparently gone on record for \\"apologizing\\" the the Aborigines, although her apology has not kept her from writing a second book on this same idiocy.  If she really feels apologetic she should consider funding some of her considerable profits for this book to support Aboriginal rights in Australia.  It's the least she owes them for exploiting their culture and folkways to pander to the audience for half-baked spirituality.<br />As is so often the case with this sort of thing, the devil is in the details, and if you're interested in pursuing those details that make this story come apart at the seams you can search for \\"Dumbartung\\" on your computer to be taken to an Aboriginal website that has a great amount of detail on the subject.  <br />As for Aboriginal spirituality, if you're really interested in the subject you're better off reading James Cowan's books.  As arguably the oldest continuous culture in the world, I believe that the Aborigines have a lot to teach us about spiritual matters.  It's a shame that the most readily available way it is being served up these days is in a sideshow caricature like this.
B0001ZMWQO|4.0|Here I am a major new wave fan who loves The Church, Simple Minds, Human League, Psychedelic Furs, Flock of Seagulls, etc. And here is a new album with an intriguing sound. Both singles are very catchy and ear candy: Take Me Out and Darts of Pleasure, especially when the first changes into uptempo, and the latter hits the german sung ending. The Dark of the Matinee and the fire song whic title isnt coming to mind sorry, are also very good. But I personally love &quot;Tell Her Tonight&quot; and in my mind the awesome &quot;Auf Asche&quot; There are other good ones and some fair also here, and overrall it is an excellent album. With all the new bands coming in I need to mention I am trying to start a new wave band, synthesizer laden labyrinths, enchnating vocals, etc. The problem is I'm only singer (think Steve Kilbey of The Church meets Phil Oakley of Human League) and a songwriter. I have written several lyrics, and all of which are very intelligent and meaningful. I am not a braggart at all, and actually am quite the opposite. I am a dreamer though trying to make it with ambition, and hoping to find a break somewhere. If you would like to view some of my lrics or are interested at all in what I've said please respond. If not I understand, for my attempt here is somewhat unique. Thank you. Here's a small sample of some of lyricism:<br />from the song &quot;Stained Glass&quot;<BR>&quot;Sunshine runs through her touch/like the golden age in her hands/opening up the whole world/but what if it unravels in strands?&quot;
0441003257|5.0|In this satirical novel, the end of the world draws near and one demon and one angel are out to change the prophesied outcome. They've become quite comfortable with how things are. They've even grown quite fond of each other. However, their quest is a \\"tall order\\" even for angelic beings.<br />In this hilarious novelization of the end times, the anti-christ is a twelve year old boy (who is more concerned with environmental issues instead of ending the world), the four horsemen of the Apocalypse actually ride motorcycles (not horses), and the most accurate book of prophecy available was written by an insane witch named Agnes Nutter.<br />Authors Gaiman (Sandman) and Pratchett (Discworld) have created one of the funniest novels I've ever read in Good Omens. Even with the \\"touchy\\" subject matter, you can't help but laugh out loud at the crazy experiences each character in the book must overcome.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Slipknot is awesome! Theirnew cd is very good. They have a new sound...So?! They're still very good. They have matured since IOWA. They have guitar solos which is cool. They have acoustic songs on here too! Slipknot is back and better than ever with new masks and a new sound!
B00007ELEL|1.0|How can people like a movie in which every other word is the &quot;F&quot; word? If simple minded people get a kick out of watching a guy named the Dude smoke a &quot;J&quot;, I'm worried about this country. Spend your time elsewhere, because this is not a thinking man's flick.
B000002H97|3.0|Metallica Sell Out would have been a better album name. But here is the review.<br />Enter Sandman: 5 minutes of similar guitar riffs would be boring if any other band did it. But Kirk Hammett saves the day with awesome background guitar and one of the best guitar solos ever.<br />Rating: 4/5<br />Sad But True: This is the best song on the album. Great intro, cool lyrics complete with echo effect, and a minor key lead during the chorus.<br />Rating: 5/5<br />Holier than Thou: This song attempts to imitate their older songs, and is the heaviest song on the album, but the lyrics suck, so it is not 5 out of 5.<br />Rating: 4/5<br />The Unforgiven: A slow song about child abuse; this song is better than it seems because of Kirk's guitar.<br />Rating: 4/5<br />Wherever I May Roam: A good song, it has good lyrics.<br />Rating: 4/5<br />Don't Tread on Me: One of the worst Metallica songs there is in my opinion. It is bad not only because it is hypocritical, after the And Justice for All album, but there is nothing good in it besides the drumming, where Lars Ulrich performs well.<br />Rating: 2/5<br />Through the Never: A better sci-fi style song is the multi-part 2112 by Rush.<br />Rating: 2/5<br />Nothing Else Matters: This song is Metallica's Stairway to Heaven. It just isn't as good. Nice orchestra.<br />Rating: 3/5<br />Of Wolf and Man: A very visual song. The chorus is cool.<br />Rating: 4/5<br />The God that Failed: Skip this song if you are evangelical. Otherwise, a very good song on Christian science.<br />Rating: 4/5<br />My Friend of Misery/ The Struggle within: These songs are just copies of the other songs on the album and are not worth listening to.<br />Rating: 3/10<br />Summary: Kirk Hammett saves this album from sucking. Stop listening after track 10.
B00008S2VG|4.0|Just because it's a different sound from Madonna does not make it bad. I think lots of us were stunned by Madonna's new sound. But after repeated listenings to her album, and letting the album just be and speak for itself, it has served to grow on many listeners. It isn't the clunker its made out to be. It's actually quite poetic with a consistent musical mosaic. The melody and lyrics are raw and simple, self-revealing. It isn't a great dance album, but a great introspective album. Regardless of its difference, it still is one of the better entries of 2003.<br />With the re-invention tour going on, I think lots more people will decide to reacquaint themselves with AL. <br />Cheers to Madonna!
0783225849|3.0|Psycho is an over-rated film which has won critical acclaim because of its shower scene. That scene was particularly daring back in the 1960's when the film was made.  A nearly nude janet leigh was the reason! Interesting trivia is that this scene comprised over 100 different camera angles.<br />Like many of Hitchcock's films, Psycho suffers from having a very 'dated' feel about it.  The characters seems stiff too.  Anthony Perkins is creepy however, and his performance is worth seeing for the film alone.
B000002NHN|1.0|Book of Secrets is a delicate, beautiful album with songs both fragile and powerful all at once. McKennitt's voice is so delicate that it could shatter and fall to pieces, yet it never does, and I think that's what makes the album so captivating and powerful. I think a good word to describe everything would be &quot;sweeping&quot;. I swear, it's like an orgasm for the ears. It's just that beautiful. If anything, get it for Mummer's Dance. I prefer the single version of the song because of the added ambience and more-defined drums, but the album version works amazingly well too.

B0000C8AW7|5.0|It's hard to believe the powers that be saw fit to remaster this album and not Time Out Of Mind, considering that this was only two years old when it got the super audio treatment. Nevertheless, the album does see improvement on the SACD layer. Listen to the old and new versions of &quot;Sugar Baby&quot; and you'll know that you're now in the presence of a superior recording, one that captures more fully the grit in Bob's voice and the tone of instruments that, in places, can't even be heard on the original pressing. The producers make another interesting choice here: rather than pulling the vocals out of the mix and running them through the center channel, as some of the other 5.1 mixes in the remastered series do, they remain on the front speakers, buried in the band as befits this, the most band-reliant Dylan album in a while.<br />As for the actual music, it didn't get all that critical acclaim for nothing. The passage of time may have dulled the &quot;This could be his best ever&quot; rhetoric, but Love and Theft is still a high point in the Dylan catalog, among his most consistent and listenable records. Despite being released on, of all days, 9/11, this isn't a socially-important record like his earliest work, but it's easier to put in the player and enjoy without so frequently pondering injustice; it isn't a stunning heartbreak record like Blood on the Tracks, but you can tap your feet and sing along to &quot;Summer Days&quot; and &quot;Honest With Me.&quot; There's room for all of those sides of Bob Dylan in his catalog, and hearing him explore this side, and mine the history of American music for sonic gold, is well worth the price of admission.
0440219078|5.0|This book was so good! i loved it and couldn't put it down. It is different from other books. I am so glad that everyone is differnt(youl get me when you have read the book) <BR>Set in a future in which communities are entirely regulated, all life patterns ordered for maximum security, uniformity, painless existence, and pleasant, if uneventful family life, this novel unfolds the story of Jonas, a promising boy who, with all his age peers, will receive his adult assignment from the elders on the yearly day of advancement celebrated for all children going through carefully calibrated developmental stages. Jonas's assignment, however, sets him apart from his peers, and ultimately from the whole community.<br />He is selected as the next Receiver of Memories, a post that allows him access to knowledge of the past carefully guarded from all but one Receiver in each generation. His lot will be to bear the pain of bearing, not only in his mind and imagination, but in his body, feelings and sensations suppressed in others by lifelong administration of biochemical regulators.<br />Besides the old Receiver of Memories, whom Jonas calls The Giver, he becomes the only one able to see colors, feel pain, desire, loss, hunger, and to remember a world in which people felt something deeper than superficial stirrings. Among other things, he discovers what it is to feel love. Horrified at the blankness in which his people live, he chooses, with the Giver's blessing, and at great risk, to escape the community, and thus to release into it the memories he will not keep to himself.<br />Rescuing a child destined for \\"release\\" for nonstandard development, Jonas embarks on a journey that leads him to a faraway place where the old life survives, leaving behind him a community that will emerge from their anaesthetized condition into the costly terms on which the gifts of ecstasy, joy, awareness, grief, and pain give life its value.
B000002I57|5.0|There's no special arrangements on this album, like there are on MJQ albums that Milt Jackson is associated with, but it has some good grooves on it. One highlight is Bags' original blues, &quot;Late Late Blues.&quot; It's a got a good drum beat and a perfect 12 bar blues format. One other highlight here is Connie Kay's drum solo, a real rarity. I only heard Kay solo on three albums, Blues On Bach, MJQ Last Concert, and this one! A real treat! Milt Jackson shines here, but Trane's mic. was a little too close during the session. When he comes up to solo, I get a &quot;dizzy&quot; feeling, because the sound of his sax is all over the place, in volume and sound. This album is good for any hard bop jazz fan!
0800177177|3.0|Making a good vampire film seems like a rarity nowadays, perhaps because people are confused on what a vampire should be, apparantly the trend is to be oversexed and rich. You don't really see one that captures that haunting mood, and what people fail to realize is that you can be scary and erotic without having a bunch of blood and guts and constant nudity everywhere.<br />That being said, \\"Bram Stoker's\\" Dracula is essentially a love story with, yes, lots of blood and sex. One scene in particular is pretty sick (when Dracula gives the baby to the concubines), but the movie isn't particularly graphic if you don't mind seeing some boobies and syrup. I guess why it's forgivable for me is for the love between Dracula and Mina, of course Dracula a.k.a. \\"Vlad the Impaler\\" being portrayed as a romantic figure seems rather silly, but it's played very nicely by Gary Oldman. He showed the desperation and the joy he felt for her, which made the whole experience a lot more enjoyable versus if they didn't have him. Winona Ryder does a pretty good job as Mina, but I think they could have gotten somebody with a stronger presence to play her. Anthony Hopkins as Van Helsing was cool, but they should have included a little bit more about his character, he was more of a secondary person. And as for Keanu Reeves, well, enough cr_p has already been said about him so I'm just going to say he adds a nice comic touch, luckily, you don't seem him TOO often. <br />I can't really tell you if it stays true to Bram Stoker's tale because I never read it, but since movies rarely ever do stay true to the book, I wouldn't doubt if it's different. But I must say it's not a bad vampire movie, better than most, and if you're a vampire lover who's looking for some romance I would definately recommend it. Peace.

B0001BKAEY|4.0|A spectacular finale to the Matrix trilogy.  The humans in Zion mount their final defense against the machines while Neo (Keanu Reeves) and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) travel to the city of the machines to broker peace and deal with the increasing menace of Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving).  The power of this movie lies in its incredible visuals.  The story and mythology of the Matrix has become quite convoluted and I never really was clear about the ultimate nature of Neo, the Matrix, or the final brief conversation between the Oracle (Mary Alice) and the Architect (Helmut Bakaitis).  Oh well, that leaves something for the next time I see these films.  If you're watching these movies to glean some sort of coherent philosophy about the nature of reality, as many of the films' detractors seem to have been doing, then I suppose you may be setting yourself up for disappointment.  If you're content to be treated to eye-popping effects and non-stop energy, you should have a good time.
6305127638|3.0|The Next Generation movies in the Star Trek series, generally speaking, stink.  Which is unfortunate, since in some ways the TNG series was better than the original Trek.  However, the movies generally vary from pure cheese to holier-than-thou piffle.<br />First Contact is a good, fun movie overall, with pretty good effects shots and plenty of generally well-executed action.  However, it also has some defects that can really get on your nerves.<br />-The plot is dumb.  Time travel has been done to death in Trek, and is a real groaner when you realize that it is being done yet again.  <BR>-The movie beats into the ground the Star Trek plot gimmick of \\"we've found a mysterious energy field, let's duplicate it/follow it/etc.\\"  We've gone from the first Star Trek movie (crappy in other ways), which at least gave a nod to real science, to the end of TNG, where they just make up fake scientific-sounding B.S. AT WILL as a plot fix.<BR>-Picard acting like Ahab from \\"Moby Dick\\" is way overdone, the worst acting by Stewart EVER.  Pure scene-chewing cheese, and the PC bit of having the skinny black chick talk reason into him is just dumb and annoying, since she was a throw-away moron of a character.  If you are going to be PC for no reason, at least have Geordi do it, we've established that LeVar Burton's character has a brain, and he can actually ACT, unlike what's-her-face.  <BR>-Making the Cochrane character such a total jerk was a BIG mistake.  Yes, it was intentional, but it was a bad decision... it makes you hope he gets shot in the head instead of fulfill history, and makes the whole middle section of the movie drag.<br />Overall, however, it is a fun movie and the only TNG movie worth watching.
B0000UJL96|4.0|Three cheers for Leonard Nimoy and Nicholas Meyer. After Star Trek was MUGged by the absurd ego of William Shatner with his disastrous Star Trek 5,Nimoy came up with the idea of Star Trek 6 with the fall of Communism in the Soviet Union and the Berlin wall coming down.<BR>Nick Meyer chipped in with his ideas and brilliant direction to save Star Trek,as he did with his writing and direction in ST2 and his writing of the San Francisco scenes in ST4.<BR>Nimoy,who had previously done so well with his directing in Star Trek 4,this time produced Star Trek 6:The Voyage Home.<BR>Highlights of this film are - the explosion of the Klingon moon(based on Chernobyl),the assassination,the Klingon trial of Kirk and McCoy,the prison camp,the escape and the finale.<BR>It is amazing what they did with a Star Trek 6 budget that was similar to the cheap looking Star Trek 5.<BR>And they had the good sense to bring the brilliant ILM back to do the effects. ILM's brilliant effects make a huge difference.<BR>Rick Berman followed Shatner's mistake of ditching ILM for the last two Trek films,will they ever learn?<BR>ILM made a huge difference in six Star Trek films and the Peter Pan line at the end &quot;second star to the right and on till morning&quot; is a delight.
B00005JLWN|4.0|i'm surprised this movie didn't have a big theatrical release. the action, while completly implaussible, was very cool. the scenery was very good looking. it has logic holes, but all action movies do.
0684800713|5.0|I read this book for required summer reading, and after a somewhat difficult-to-follow book, this novel was a breath of fresh air. It said this novel was famous because of Hemingway's prose, and I agree. He does not dress up this story with unfathomable metaphors and whatnot. He tells it like it is, which is what I like. This is the &quot;Lost Generation&quot; - the people right after World War I, and everyone's pretty much...lost. Our characters capture that theme very well, with their decadence (heavy drinking) and meandering. The characters Lady Brett Ashley and Jake Barnes are memorable. They both love each other very much, but Jake is impotent due to a war injury, and this prevents Brett from committing to him. This is a poignant novel, and sometimes, I could relate to their issues (minus the heavy drinking!) very well.
B000002H2H|5.0|When asked whats my favorite Metallica cd of all time its too hard to choose a specific one kind of like apples and oranges really but this would be my most played Metallica album.Even more so than Master Of Puppets.If I really had to choose what my favorite Metallica album is Id have to say its really a tie between this and Master Of Puppets.For me they are both too similar and too different to say which one I like more.Id say that their best guitar work is on this one but their best vocal work is on Puppets.Puppets had the best instrumental(Orion) but Ride The Lightning had the best actual song(Fade To Black).I think Fight Fire With Fire is a great opener and its a lot like Battery.The title track is to me real similar to Master Of Puppets but it doesnt quiet down on the beginning of the middle it starts out loud and stays there.For Whom The Bell Tolls is a slower one sort of like The Thing That Should Not Be only with better rhythm guitar and equally good lead.Fade To Black sounds a bit like Welcome Home Sanitarium but the subject matter is different(Fade To Black looks at Suicide and Welcome Home Sanitarium is about a plan to escape from an asylum),Trapped Under Ice is not as strong a 5th track as Disposable Heroes on Master but I have to admit the chorus is awesome,Escape to me is very different than Leper Messiah musically and lyrically,the 7th track is an actual song and a classic thrasher at that wheras Orion from Master Of Puppets is an instrumental,The Call Of Ktulu is an instrumental where Damage Inc is the classic thrasher from Master Of Puppets.Thanks for the time.
B0001WTUH6|2.0|The nicest thing I can say about UW is, &quot;Hey, this would look great as a Goth/Industrial club!&quot; Unfortunately there's not much else positive. Maybe the problem lies with the fact that the premise is so promising... a centuries old blood-feud between lycanthropes and vampires. Had the underlying concept been weaker maybe it wouldn't be so disapointing. But alas, when you make big promises you have to follow through with a big delivery... something this film just could not do.<br />The fact that these unique, legendary creatures would have to resort to a non-stop gun battle is a trite cop-out and it just never lets up. UW never fully takes advantage of the inherent abilities of the monsters themselves and makes them just glorified mortal humans. The plot twists provide nothing to get excited about. Like a few others I had to try for several weeks before I actually made it all the way through. Just boring really and unoriginal while it could have been so much more.
B0000BWVCM|4.0|this movie had much better action than the first one, but the plot was very bad. the dvd features were very good.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I have been a fan of Britney Spears since I first heard &quot;...Baby One More Time&quot; on the radio.  Since that albums release, similar tracks and albums have followed.  &quot;In The Zone&quot; breaks the mold of everything that you ever thought about Britney Spears.  Often times racey, always interesting, Britney's &quot;In The Zone&quot; brings pop music to a new level.  From her hit &quot;Me Against the Music&quot; with the legendary Madonna to her beautiful ballad &quot;Everytime&quot;, Britney Spears has shown that she can re-invent herself and push the envelope.  This is without a doubt her best album and one of the best album's of 2004.
B00009L1TA|2.0|One's enjoyment of this movie probably will be determined by one's tolerance for being somewhat &quot;cheated&quot; by the screenwriter and director.  If you don't mind a certain degree of dishonesty in the service of plot and surprise (and don't mind John Travolta), you'll probably rate this higher than I did.  On the other hand, if you believe that a well done thriller by definition has to play fair with its audience, you'll likely feel manipulated and, yes, cheated.<br />This is one of those films that are difficult to discuss without spoiling the plot.  Suffice it to say that I found the production values first rate, and the sound and action sequences generally well done.  I don't mind Travolta, like Connie Nielsen, and wasn't too put off by a fairly cliched performance by Samuel Jackson as the (usual) hard-bitten Sergeant.<br />However, the movie cannot stand up to close analysis of the plot and its various devices.  Sins against the viewer are committed by the screenwiter and director--the principle one being that characters who are shown to have certain knowledge at the end do not act consistently with that knowledge throughout.<br />That's all I'm going to say except that having the DVD will enable you to replay some of the scenes sufficiently to see the extent to which the viewer has been manipulated.  There is honest and clever manipulation that always takes place in good thrillers, but this movie, while clever in spots, isn't very honest.
B000002L7J|5.0|Not widely considered to be the band's best but it does contain their biggest hit, &quot;How Soon Is Now?&quot;. MIM contains the perfect mix of Smiths' style songs including both fast and slow, fun and political. I remember back in the 80's when 'Spin Magazine' had &quot;How Soon Is Now?&quot; ranked as the best single of all time. I also remember thinking, &quot;You know, that isn't even one of my favorite Smiths' songs.&quot; Actually not even my fave from this album. To me HSIN had great lyrics and a cool sound but was generally not very Smiths-like. The song lacked the rawness and edge of their other material due to its high-gloss production... precisely NOT the point of the band. Still it's a wonderful song with a catchy, highly original melody and Mozz' sharp wit.<br />I've always been partial to the underappreciated songs from this album. The haunting &quot;Well I Wonder&quot; is dreamy and melancholy declaring &quot;This is the fierce last stand of all I am.&quot;  &quot;That Joke Isn't Funny Anymore&quot; is simply brilliant as we watch the knife of past words turn sharply against the protagonist. &quot;What She Said&quot; speeds up the pace but remains downbeat lyrically with its angst and sarcastic humor; Marr delivers an understated but excellent performance. On &quot;I Want the One I Can't Have&quot; the singer laments his inability to hide his emotions or capture the subject of his desire. And in &quot;Nowhere Fast&quot; Morrissey questions whether he has the capacity to experience life or emotionally progress at all (hence the name).<br />The title track is often clasified as over-the-top and may be many people's least favorite from this collection of songs. I beg to differ. Morrissey is entitled to his opinion on us meateaters and I have no issue with that. He states his case in a dark, poetic manner backed by the cries of cattle and sounding of the screaming knife. Missed in the criticism of this track is MArr's ability to craft an otherwordly guitar melody that is both sad and majestic in a way I've rarely heard. Quite simply, this is the vegetarians' anthem. Actually there was a t-shirt in the 80's with every single lyric printed on it. &quot;The Headmaster Ritual&quot; speaks of systematic cruelty embedded in British schools while &quot;Barbarism Begins at Home&quot; echoes that abusive cruelty in the home.<br />All in all, this is not the band's best but still merits every bit of 5 stars. In other words, an average Smiths' release.
B0000AXE8I|2.0|the characters were stupid and the action was mediocre. the agent smith fight was stupid. the car chase was probubly the best scene in the movie and there are a thousand movies that do those scenes better. this movie also has the worst sex scene ever.
0446310786|5.0|TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD explores the injustice of racism in the small, sleepy town of Maycomb, Alabama.  Lee's novel is narrated through the eyes of 8 year-old wise-beyond-her-years Scout Finch, a keen and extraordinarily observant child.<br />The horizons of TO KILL... don't end at the explorations and explanations of racism in the South.  Other themes include growing up and emotions involved, how people avoid what they do not understand, and friendships - how they evolve and blossom.  One of Scout's close friends is dimunitive Dill, a \\"Beautiful Child\\" contest winner (a.k.a. Charles Baker Harris) who visits Maycomb to stay with his aunt over the summers.  Compelled by mere curiosity, together, he and Scout plot to lure hermit and town bogeyman Boo Radley out into the open.  Peculiar myths and legends surround his very existence, courtesy of the gossip mongers of Maycomb.<br />Lee demonstrates the true ugliness of racism. Racism, we see, is what causes a small Southern town to do a complete turn around.  Scout, with the innocent heart of a child, balances out the misunderstandings.  Atticus Finch, Scout's father, who is always known as \\"Atticus,\\" is chosen to represent a black man who supposedly raped Mayella Ewell, a white farmer's daughter.  This is truly what opens the reader's eyes to the evils of the town.  Despite this, Scout Finch still adamantly believes that people are essentially good overall, \\"once you get to see them.\\"  Obviously, this isn't all true - Scout is mind-blowingly bright yet still exhibits realistic childlike qualities, her naivete being one of them.<br />Atticus can truly be regarded for his extreme heroism.  Despite a cruel and uncaring town, he stood up for what he believed in, what he knew in his heart was right.  He's possesses great wisdom, a heart of gold, great understanding, and considerable kindness.  He treats his children, Jem and Scout, like they are mature adults.  This is probably one of the main reasons why Scout is so keenly and constantly aware of her surroundings, as well as a reason for her innate intellect.  <br />One of the best plot twists in TO KILL... involves a newfound hero that neither Jem and Scout, nor the reader, could have ever predicted would be so brazen and courageous.  Boo Radley is one of the novel's pivotal characters, yet he doesn't appear all that much in the story.  When Scout and company first discuss him and his myths, they speak of him as if he's some kind of hideous monster.  In reality, he is as kind and caring as Atticus and has just as much hero potential, which finally rises to the surface towards the end of the novel for the reader (and Harper's characters) to see.<br />TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is laced with humor, yet it finds a comfortable balance between being both comedic and serious in the subject matter Harper chose to tackle.  It also manages to be sentimental and heartbreaking, yet never even comes close to being borderline mushy and overly sappy.  It's an inspirational tale regarded by generation after generation as a classic - a tale of respect for all human life in a society in which incessant misunderstandings are present within its people.  Look at the world we live in today.  Consider the mindset of various individuals and groups.  I ask you, what person can't relate to this enlightening, eye-opening book?
B00009V7P8|5.0|It's just amazing how many fans of his got introduce to his music from mouth to mouth instead of outside exposures in the beginning.  Like most of them I heard it through a friend of mine.  And it took me only two of his musics(volcano,cheers to you darling) to get me hooked.  <BR>Some of reviewers noted his or her dislike to this cd b/c of most of songs sounding too melancholic.  But this is the reason this album is so famous, the album explores and expresses this certain human emotions in such a poetic ways.  Also lisa hannigan helping Damien Rice on the vocal helps bring such expressions as well as Vyvienne Long on cello.  <BR>I recommend this album to whoever wants to explore alternative music scene and keep in mind this is NOT a cheery album.  It's kind of music helps you to be sad when you want to be.  And for people who didn't enjoy melancholy side of this album, try his other songs suck as &quot;I'm so childish&quot; or &quot;Grooving&quot;, which is somewhat lighter compared to this album.  For people who've enjoyed this album be sure to check out his live shows, which are just hypnotic.
B00005JMEW|4.0|In my opinion, a lot of anime (Japanese animation) is way better than a lot of the crap we see in the theatres these days. The cuts, the storyline, the graphic imagery is so much more compelling to me. With that said, it's really fun to see a movie that blends a lot of anime-inspired ideas into live-action. I can't recall any other movie that has tried to do such a feat and do it so well.   Yes, there are showers of blood as enemies get cut into many pieces, but the movie isn't really gorey. Tarantino's movie turns blood and violence into some dark ballet of death and it's frighteningly entertaining. At time's your apt to laugh at the fight scenes - not so much because of their absurd nature, but because it reminds you of some martial arts movie or some anime that you've seen before. And that's not to say that Tarantino &quot;ripped&quot; off other movies, but that he has chosen to use some of their spirit and ideas into this one. I would have given this movie a higher score, but it seems that the character development is somewhat shallow. I didnt really feel a need to care about the main character (Uma's character). And it seemed more like watching a train wreck (an entertaing train wreck). Still, Kill Bill is a fun movie, but don't expect a tear-jerking experience. It's action, done with Tarantino's keen eye for cool and inspired work.
B00005JM0B|5.0|this has some of the best action in any movie i have ever scene. the cast is pretty forgettable. neither of the humans' actors really seem like they have any business in an action movie. arnold is getting old and was best as a bad guy. the female terminator seemed sadistic, not cold and emotionless. the dvd features were good. The cast wasn't very good, but the action was unforgettable.
B0000013GT|5.0|If you have the first album then you can really see the growth of Andre and Big Bio as artist and musicians. Everything is stepped up on this album from the production, lyrics, flow, and originality!! You can tell from this album that they are no one hit wonders, but made to last true stars especially Andre 3000. <br />P.S. Listen to 13th floor/Growing Old and E.T. then you'll get this album right off the back.
B00004X01U|4.0|I just want to comment on reviewers claiming that this was just an &quot;OK&quot; album, when in my opinion, this is a great album, although not better than the critically acclaimed Ray of Light.<br />In the 90s we recieved albums from Madonna that didn't have too much focus on dance music . . .so I consider this album Madonna getting back to her dance-floor roots after the critically aclaimed &quot;ethereal&quot; portion of her career, in which it brought about Madonna's only perfect album, and only album that recieved a Grammy nod for Album of the year after 18 years in the music industry. Unfortuanately, Grammy voters thought Lauryn Hill's first solo effort was better than an album that took the most famous female musician in the world 18 years to conjure. By all means, she was robbed single-handedly by a good solo artist who would later cease to make it in the music industry, suffering from the plague of non-longevity, in which Madonna has defeated so many times. Even in 2003, where she would suffer her lowest blow, she'll prove that one &quot;bad&quot; year wont kill her when she's had 21 &quot;good&quot; years.<br />Music is, in my opinion, ranks right up their, but slim with Ray of Light, because of the fact that you could probably listen to the whole album without skipping a whole bunch of songs. Ray of Light was a perfect album, but had very few dance songs than Music, where Music was an album that had several dance songs . . .but lost it's flare by the time that we got to the end of the album. I'm literally speaking of the fact that the songs on the Music album were dance then calm, making it a redundant album that seemed kind of 50, 50. It would have worked better if it was arranged where the song's baseed on their genre were scattered out through the album so that by the time we got to the end we wouldn't be sleeping from all the calm melodic, and sometimes artsy songs that made up the quirky ballads for this album.<br />The biggest issue I had when Madonna released this particular album was the decision of choosing singles. Impressive Instant, Amazing, and maybe (my favorite) Nobody's Perfect were just hell-bent on being released as singles. Also after seeing the beautiful video that was for the song Paradise (Not For Me) it kind of made me long for it to be a single release too. Although Madonna redeemed the average What it Feels Like For A Girl single with the video release suiting a remixed version, I don't think the single was good enough to be released over the ones I listed above, but all in all, it did bring us one of her best and most controversial videos ever, which would later be diminished by the American Life video.<br />There are so may good songs on the album that I would only list the songs that are average in it's own right, and that are &quot;skipable.&quot; <br />1. Runaway Lover - Thank God she didn't release this as a single. It's the worst song on the album, and I hardly listen to it. <br />2. I Deserve It - Although it'a an average song, it is boring and gets redundant very early.<br />All in all, this is Madonna saying, &quot;I can still have fun after having a baby!&quot; This is a great album, although it's not better than Ray of Light, you could consider me biased because I started buying Madonna records after Ray of Light, and Ray of Light was the first cd. I've ever owned. It's still a good album . . .not better than the previous, but it will prove to have status compared to what Madonna will release after this one.

B00008S2VG|3.0|Firstly, I would like to congradulate poofdaddy on making a point that most reviwers on here seem to forget. You stated that American Life will be viewed as a classic years to come just like the, once critically panned album Erotica. That is so very true. I clearly remember the 92-93 era of Madonna's career where Erotica took a backseat to critics and caused her a lot of fans, but now all we hear is how good that album was. Athough I beg to differ, the point is that most critics and fans are saying how bad American Life is but in years to come they will be giving it the praises it deserves as an album that is personal, professional, and average in it's own right. <br />I think that Erotica wasn't a good album, because their were a lot of songs I skipped, but so did everyone else, and now, based on most reviwers, it seems as though the album could rank up their with Madonna's behemoth albums, &quot;Ray of Light,&quot; &quot;Like A Prayer,&quot; or &quot;True Blue,&quot; in which is her best album of the 80s in my opinion, that was overshadowed by the very overated &quot;Like A Prayer.&quot; Let's be honest people, we skipped a couple of songs of that album. <br />Anyway I thought the album was a little above average because I was expecting much more, but if you know Madonna like I do, you would know that with every critically panned album she comes out with, comes another album worthy of the most praises. All I know is that her next album after this one is going to make us feel dumb for criticizing an album, and not understanding that every artist has a bad record, but in this case, most think it's bad, while I think it's worthy of more than just being called a flat-out bad album. Her next one will be huge, if it's not true what I heard about her doing an album for her next starring movie that is the soundtrack, and her album.<br />The single choices were obviously what killed this album. Madonna was indeed blacklisted, causing all of her released singles for this album to get no airplay or television time. I don't think that would have stopped her fans from buying a new Madonna cd though. I think all in all, the choice that she made to not release the original American Life video caused her fans to go in a frenzy, feeling as if Madonna was being hypocritical to what was once her companion. I mean c'mon even Erotica sold well in the US and it was an average or below average album, except for some singles off of it. Basically Madonna lost fans for this effort because the decision she made to not release the original American Life video, in which was a beautiful, as well as controversial one. She was blacklisted though, but look what happened months later after she decided not to release the video, it seems as if everyone is jumping on her bandwagon and criticizing Bush now. If she released that video she could have said later, &quot;I hate to say I told you so,&quot; giving herself a most deserved pat on the back, and deeming her still the queen.<br />I wish Intervention could have been a single. That's the best song off of the album. The songs are listenalble, but most are very redundant, even more so than some songs off of the Music album, but still the album is a must-buy, for a few of the singles alone. I thought Love Profusion would have been the album's saving grace, but it seems not likely. It was supposedly the strongest cut off of the album based on most opinions. Madonna needs to reanalyze her choice in choosing singles to release. I was upset when she didn't release Amazing, Nobody's Perfect, and especially Impressive Instant as singles from the Music album (I'm sure fans would agree), but with this album I would have released Interventon, instead of Nothing Fails, and Mother &amp; Father probably should have seen the light of day. Besides Madonna's videos for this album wasn't really worth watching them numerous times for, except for the original American Life video. <br />Unfortunately, with the way things are goingnow Madonna's crown, little by little, is almost up for grabs. Let's hope she redeems herself with her next effort . . . but honestly, even the critics that hate her still admits that she makes the best female pop records. She literally owns this genre of music and her teen-queen wannabees can't even come close. Buy this album, I promise you that you would like atleast 4 of the songs on it.
B0001ENYKS|5.0|I had heard a number of my friends refer to Franz Ferdinand, and actually listened to the samples right here on Amazon.com.  In actuality, the music didn't appeal to me at all through the samples, but after seeing a delightful live performance of &quot;Take Me Out&quot; on Late Night with Conan O'Brien, I decided to buy it on a whim, figuring I could pass it along to a rock-loving friend if I hated it.  Since I've put it in my CD player, however, the disc has been on constant rotation.<br />As a somewhat discriminating music listener, especially in terms of rock, the fact I absolutely LOVE this CD says quite a bit.  True, the lyrics aren't life-changing, incredibly moving lyrical bits of poetry, but the music is a pure delight.  The progressive build to the hook on &quot;Take Me Out&quot; completely changes the energy of the song, and sounds unique and original to the ear.  Other favorite songs on the disc are &quot;Dark of the Matineé&quot; and &quot;Michael,&quot; both of which sound very retro-inspired, especially taking cues from Bowie in &quot;Michael.&quot; <br /> Another feature I appreciate is a lead singer who can actually sing! In a day filled with rock bands with strained or off-key vocals, the lead singer actually manages to not only complement the music, but sound pleasing in the meantime.<br />Bottom Line: &quot;Franz Ferdinand&quot; is an electic mix of different rock styles, which result in a style that is simultaneously innovative and electic, as well as borrowed and retro.

076790592X|1.0|Morrie was a kindly, slightly eccentric old man with cute quips about love, family and materialism. But was he deeply insightful? Were his comments so mind-blowing you ever put down the book and uttered: &quot;My God. He's right.&quot; ? Hardly. As tragic as his illness was, Morrie gives us nothing new to think about on the above topics. Love your family. Compromise. Money isn't everything. Such are the words of wisdom handed down through the ages to us; words we often choose to ignore in our personal selfish quests. Morrie hands them down to Mitch, and while they all ring true, how different are they to, say, what my own grandfather told me? What a book of proverbs can tell you? What your local preacher might say Sunday morning? Added to this is an opportunistic biographer who dispensed with his old teacher for 16 years until he popped up on Nightline one night. &quot;Here's my chance,&quot; he thought. Strapping a microphone to the old man's lapel, Mitch even manages to tie up the book deal before Morrie finally moves on to the Great Quip Factory in the Sky. I don't want to sound too down on Morrie, who I am sure was a wonderful soul, but he is one of a million wonderful souls. It's a pity Mitch didn't find a GREAT wonderful soul with stories and anecdotes to make us really think. Even if he had, I doubt his writing would have improved too much. Mitch writes like a sports journalist; a rich gateau of cliches leaving us with nothing to ponder for ourselves. As for the great lie that Mitch has rediscovered himself after his meetings with Morrie, all I can say is that the opportunity Morrie gave him only served to enhance his self-confessed materialistic, career-driven lifestyle. Finally, what is the &quot;great life lesson&quot; we are promised on the cover? Seriously. What is it? Love? Didn't we know that already? The greatest lesson I learnt is that when a book comes as cheap as this one, you get what you pay for.
B00008J2DQ|2.0|This band never changes it just keep makeing the same album over and over.Keeps sounding more like Alice In Chains but with out skill. Do some thing else you F^cking sell outs. If you own the first Godsmack album then dont buy any of the other ones Its a waste of time and money to buy any other Godsmack album. Buy Alice In Chains the band Godsmack took their sound from only with out the nu-metal bull sh^t.
B000000OQF|5.0|I bought this CD in 1988 when I was in middle school and I don't think it left my CD player for over 3 years. Simply put, one of the greatest and most influential albums of all time. I am currently on my second CD and I listened to as loud as I did back when I was a teenager.<br />How many people started playing the guitar after hearing Slash's intro to 'Sweet Child O' Mine'?<br />IMHO, this is the greatest CD ever recorded.
B00003CXCT|4.0|I love the idea of watching never before seen material and I can't wait, but I'd rather the original trilogy were released, without the modifications. As for the costumer big whoop, I just want to say: get a life!!! If you're not interested in these films there's no need to spoil other people's pleasure by writing senseless, highly cynical and sarcastic things.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|Wow, I hadn't heard of these guys until just recently, but I don't know how I missed them.  They have talent that goes absolutely unparalleled by anyone in the hardcore scene.  Very similar to Atreyu or From Autumn to Ashes (but with less annoying melody parts than FATA).  The guitar parts are fast and driven without resorting to low tuned string banging and there is some furious drumming and bass going on beneath the prominent guitar parts.  It seems like the the vocals and bass could have been brought out a little more in the final mixing of the album, but it's only a minor bug.  The strongest songs are &quot;Unholy confessions&quot; and &quot;Desecrate through reverence&quot;.  Check these guys out if you haven't heard of them as I can almost guarantee that you won't be disappointed.
B0001ENYKS|5.0|Franz Ferdinand has given a new edge to rock.  They're retro enough to be familiar, but revolutionary enough to be completely new and interesting.  This is one of the few albums I can listen to, start to finish, without getting bored...every single day.  The songs are provocative without being obnoxious, and danceable without sacrificing thier rock edge.  &quot;Take Me Out&quot; is one of my favorites; it starts off very pop-y, but then it suddenly shifts to a really awesome, straight-up rock song.  &quot;Matinee&quot; is great too...speed changes, cool lyrics, and driving guitars make it fun to listen to over and over.  &quot;Michael&quot; is perhaps the best dance song on the album; it's just hot, sweaty speed bursting out of a tangle of instruments and electricity.  Every single song is unexpected, from the Jeckyll-and-Hyde first track, &quot;Jacqueline,&quot; to the slow-yet-compelling final track, &quot;40'.&quot;  Give this band a chance; even if you don't like them right away (unlikely), they'll grow on you faster than you can say &quot;superfantastische!&quot;
B0001NBMBC|5.0|alrighty, where to begin here? I love slipknot.  I'm sure that makes me a &quot;poser&quot; or whatever the ignorant tards are calling it now, but I do.  I think they are one of the best (if not THE best) bands in today's scene.  Just cuz they're popular doesn't mean it's &quot;uncool&quot; to like them.  now, on to the album.  This is an awesome CD, despite what the closed minded reviewers seem to spouting.  Slipknot has changed musically, so if you're only into hour long screamfests with no diversity, then no, this isn't for you.  For those of you with mature music tastes, read on.  They have turned a little lighter (ok, a LOT lighter) for several of the songs (&quot;vermillion pt.2&quot;, &quot;circle&quot;, and &quot;Danger: keep away&quot;) but the melodies are eerie with very creative percussion backgrounds that let you know that, yes, this is still slipknot.  The heavy songs, however, are just as heavy as the self titled album or Iowa.  &quot;The blister exists&quot;, &quot;the opium of the people&quot; and &quot;before I forget&quot; are all deafeningly heavy.  I listened to nothing else for weeks after I got this album.  In summation through the ranting, this album is awesome, not as good as Iowa, but better than the self titled album.  If you don't mind lighter music as well, you'll love this, but if you prefer your metal unadulterated and have a very closed mind, then don't bother.
0451169514|5.0|Stephen King chilled everyone's hearts with books such as The Shining and Pet Sematary.  I know that those ones chilled my heart.  But, when I read It, it instantly scared the living daylights out of me.  It is so wonderfully written and the characters are so unforgettable that I read it three times!!<BR>     There are some parts in the middle that bored me to no end, but that doesnt affect my review whatsoever, because the rest of the book was so good..<BR>     I reccomend this book to any Stephen King fan (unless you are extremely afraid of clowns.  There are a few people i know that are terrified of clowns and this book).   <BR>     Also, if you want to, you can watch the movie, which isn't nearly as good as the book

B0001ZX0PG|5.0|I'm stunned by the cluelessness of some of these reviews.  MYSTIC RIVER is an under-the-skin tragedy made devastating by the very casualness not only of its technique, but of its &quot;genre.&quot;  It's extremely calculated, to miraculous effect.  Who expects such feeling in a &quot;police procedural&quot; -- the very use of the genre becomes subversive, therefore, catching us off-guard while SLOWLY (and that's calculated as well) delivering its emotional payloads.  Nothing in this gorgeous film is an accident, including Laura Linney's chilling &quot;transformation&quot; into Lady MacBeth; watch the film again and you'll see . . . it's no transformation at all.  In a way, to be somewhat flippant, MYSTIC RIVER is all smoke and mirrors.  But god, what a trick . . .

0451169514|2.0|Most online reviews tend to be biased.  On amazon, most people who write reviews have enjoyed the book they are reviewing.  If you're looking for apartments, on the other hand, and check out online reviews, you'll only see grouchy, dastardly opinions.<br />Anyway.<br />You start reading &quot;It,&quot; and you'll quickly realize that King has a way with words.  He's adept at creating whatever atmosphere he wishes to in the reader's mind.  The sleepy, small town and the group of friends are brought to life with great vividness.  The book draws you in.  King has obviously given great thought to the set-up, the background and to character development, and has executed these beautifully.  A wonderful job as far as all this is concerned.<br />And then you read on some more, step back a little, and you realize that King's imagination is surprisingly shallow.  There is no logic, or coherence, or credibility to his plot.  Oh, I'm not talking about the real-world plausibility of the events described.  It's a supernatural horror novel.  But even if you accept the basic premises, there's obviously been no effort to come up with an interesting plot.  King simply made up the story as he went along, and the story doesn't go anywhere.  The conclusion is one of the biggest (and incidentally, most revolting) disappointments you'll encounter in your literary wanderings.<br />If you really want to find out what the fuss is all about, borrow it from your library... not worth buying.
B000066NW0|2.0|Avril Lavigne may be a poser but she has reached something in American teenagers. I bought this album when I was a poor, misguided radio addicted baby and I loved it. Avril has mastered the G chord and the contrived lyric. Not to mention the whole girls wearing ties thing she started. If you are a fan of pop music, buy this CD, I'm sure you'll love it but if you like good music avoid it.
B0001GF2DS|5.0|Clint Eastwood is The Good, Lee Van Cleef is the Bad, and Eli Wallach is the Ugly in the epic final chapter in Sergio Leone's &quot;Man with No Name&quot; trilogy. More than just the average spaghetti western, this cinematic mastepiece has been regarded by everyone from Quentin Tarantino to Robert Rodriguez as one of the greatest films ever made. With this new double-disc special edition, this film has been fully restored in an extended three-hour version that features over eighteen minutes of new scenes that have been dubbed in English for the first time for this release.<br />Our three title characters are all after one thing: a large helping of Confederate gold hidden in an unmarked grave. They all go back and forth in forging false alliances with one another in an attempt to get what they need. Wallach knows the name of the graveyard where it's hidden and Eastwood has the name of the grave while Van Cleef is ready to kill at will to find the treasure. This all makes for an intruiging adventure as the three travel on their own respective paths through the burning desert, the war-ravaged towns, and the vast mountains. The only common ground they share is their journey for the prize and their willingness to shoot and kill anyone including each other who stands in their way.<br />This DVD edition of &quot;The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly&quot; is about as good as it gets for longtime fans of the movie. While some might be able to notice the difference between the newly-dubbed scenes and the original U.S. version, it's well worth it to finally see the movie the way Sergio Leone wanted it to be viewed. In additioned to finally getting the fully-restored extended cut of the film, there is another disc of added bonus features. There is a featurette explaining all of the hard work that MGM had put into reconstructing the new version of the film. There is also a featurre and accompaning commentary on the spectactular Moricone score. There are two &quot;deleted scenes&quot;, a longer and more violent cut of Van Cleef's brutal interrogation of Wallach, and a detailed video outline of the incomplete Socorro sequence. You're also getting three documentaries, one on the making of the film, one about Sergio's film style, and another one titled &quot;The Man Who Lost The Civil War&quot;, which has nothing to do with the film itself but is more of a historical reminder of where the movie came from.<br />Having grown up in the 80's, I was never a huge fan of Westerns and in fact, I had never seen this film prior to purchasing it but after seeing it, it joins the ranks of such films as &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; and &quot;Scarface&quot; in becoming an instant favorite after just one viewing. It has clearly influenced so many of the films that followed it with its groundbreaking visual style. Eastwood's quiet but cool stranger was obviously used as the blueprint for many action heroes that followed. Even if you've never seen or heard of this movie, you will recognize Ennino Moricone's infamous musical score. If you are the type who has never cared enough to pick up a Western film, I encourage you to drop all preconceived notions about the genre and pick up this DVD. &quot;The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly&quot; isn't just some cliche-driven cowboys and robbers movie, it is a stylish and well-photographed action adventure.

B00008H2LB|1.0|Released in March 25th, 2003, Meteora is Linkin Park's 3rd album.<br />After borrowing this album, I can safely assume that my eardrums are still intact, but after having to listen to this dreadful mish-mash of rap and rock, I can't assume if I even believe my ears. So what is Stinkin Park exactly? Well, they are officially a &quot;Nu-Metal&quot; band, but in fact, they are a rap/pop band with one guitar. And the guitar? Mindless riffs that are so repetitive they border on the complexity to the beat of Eminem's &quot;Cleaning Out My Closet&quot;. So what Stinkin Park really is, unlike the mindless fan of these wannabe Vanilla Ice rappers will tell you, is a glorified rap band with lyrics that rival Lil Kim for their originality, and beats like on &quot;Lying From You&quot; that take us back to the good old days of Britney Spear's &quot;Baby One More Time&quot;. Plus, Stinkin Park's singers are unabashedly terrible and girly, with the MC's vocals sounding like a mixture of Vin Diesel and Marylin Manson, and the official lead singer, most notably on little quips from &quot;Lying From You&quot; sounding like he's squeezing out a crap and whining in the line &quot;I'm Lying to Bend The Truth&quot;. In the next few words, I'm going to make a statement about Linkin Park, which also ties in with the Beastie Boys(I will give this to LP fans, LP is infinity times better than the Beastie Boys). In my opinion, between N'Sync and those two bands, I prefer N'Sync. Would you like to know why? First off, I hate N'Sync and any kind of Pop, but N'Sync, unlike Stinkin Park and the Beastie Boys, are HONEST about the kind of music they play. N'Sync says they play Pop, AND THEY DO! Linkin Park, on the other hand, portrays themselves as a &quot;Hardcore Metal&quot; band with &quot;rap influences&quot;! WTF! Hardcore Metal? Are you implying you're even half the band that Metallica and Pantera were you greasy preppy white boy rappers? I'll tell Stinkin Park and their fans right now, Linkin Park is rap with a guitar! Even other terrible Nu-Metal bands, such as Slipknot and Limp Bizkit, aren't half as bad as this pile of human waste! It figures, with all the gullible young 9 Year olds who watch MTV pick up on junk and other crap MTV promotes like Good Charlotte, The Beastie Boys, Avril Lavigne, Limp Bizkit, and the thousands of mindless rap bands out there. I will admit, I was once a Linkin Park fan, EVEN LESS THAN a YEAR AGO! But you know what? I went out and starting getting into bands like Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains, Metallica, Pantera, Rush, and Ozzy Osbourne, and in comparison, Linkin Park looked like the lowest form of scum on the face of the earth. Just listening to Meteora, as many other people who've had to suffer through these songs on the radio, &quot;Lying From You&quot; and &quot;Numb&quot; are more disjointed than an amputee! Just listen to the songs for god's sake! THEY NEVER CHANGE, THEY'RE JUST THE SAME GUITAR RIFF, BEAT, AND VOCALS OVER AND OVER AND OVER, BROKEN UP BY A CHORUS EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE! If you're a Linkin Park fan, and I'm sure you're already reaching for the Not Helpful button, listen to what I'm about to say. All the ranting I've done about Linkin Park is ABSOLUTELY TRUE, and if you don't agree, listen to the songs a little closer. Below you'll find other bands that might fit your tastes but are billions times better than Linkin Park-<br />Modern Rock Fans-<br />Velvet Revolver, Fuel, Metallica(Not St. Anger), Tool, A Perfect Circle, 3 Doors Down(Not Away From The Sun), Audioslave, Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, Stone Temple Pilots, Aerosmith, and a few others.<br />Rap/Rock Fans(I don't really like any of these bands a whole lot, but they're okay)-<br />Rage Against the Machine, Anthrax, Faith No More, (In A way...)

From the Shopaholic series which were great (the first 2 anyway) to this. A big slide downhill. This book would be fine if this was your first look into chick lit/romance fiction.
B000002TYX|1.0|Don't get suckered into buying this. If these recordings had been previously rejected, it was for a good reason (yes, even if they are by the Fab Four!). Free As A Bird is a weak song and doesn't make purchasing an entire double album worthwhile. At the end of the day, it's just a way of squeezing money from unsuspecting beatlemaniacs.
0786867973|5.0|this book is fantastic! one of my favorite baking books and cookbooks in general. some recipes might not work out right (for example, i think the last reviewer coincidentally tried out all of the recipes that previous reviewers didn't enjoy..) but i know a lot of them are delicious!! it's sort of a shame that they happened to try the some of the only ones out of the book that happen to be bad. all books are bound to have a couple that aren't great or anything.. i've tried many recipes already and they are great. nigella provides delicious recipes and a soothing voice telling you how to execute the recipe. with her directions, the recipe no longer seems hard. for example.. cheese danishes are usually intimidating to make, but she makes it sounds so simple and helps you through the process with confidence. they turned out lovely, especially for the first time making them! the dense chocolate loaf cake is reallly good, even worth the price of the book alone. i also loved the molten chocolate babycakes and her banana bread, which is my favorite banana bread recipe since it is so simple to make yet absolutely delicious.  and how about those schnecken, eh?  just as the title states, this is comfort cooking and everything in here seems to scream out comfort. beautiful pictures, can't wait to try more. hope this helps! by the way, you really DO feel like a domestic goddess. :) highly recommended.

B00000JG41|5.0|at this point in their career, bungle have become masters of pulling the rug out from under everyone. this is a glowing example. the strange thing is, I've owned this cd for a good 3 years, and I always enjoyed it, but it wasnt until a few nights ago that I devoted the proper attention to its genius. listening at night through headphones proved a revelatory experience.<br />In the great tradition of frank zappa, bungle has proved itself as master of parody, in the best way. this album perfectly distills the california landscape. it's a brilliantly dark and sinister parody of both western and eastern music, achieving a level of unparalleled terror through bizarre and often comical soundscapes. dark lyrical content mixed with earnest and sometimes wacked out  takes on differnt genres create a sense of maniacal forboding.<br />the album tackles all sorts of out-of character styles, ranging from doowop, surf, klezmer, polka, rat-pack swing, lounge and tons of others. the arrangements are remarkably mature and involved. but the unique thing about California is not only the superb songcraft, but the way the songs are attacked. <br />the thing that struck me most was how western and eastern music were mixed. both styles of music are fused expertly in songs like the air-conditioned nightmare, playing a middle eastern melody over a surf rock beat, and ars moriendi, blending european klezmer with middle eastern sound. its mind boggling.<br />the general parody of surf rock pops up on the first track and also on the air conditioned nightmare, fitting all manner of surf, from dick dale to beach boys to the surfaris, all in one song. howver, it transforms into a paranoid portrait of insanity, surrounded by pop culture, a mind going insane with the tv on.<br />but what sets this apart from other zappa-esque pop parody albums is the level of conviction prevalent in these songs. it draws you in so you can no longer stand back and laugh at it from a distance, it forces you to take it seriously, at which point you are at the mercy of patton's disturbing vision. pink cigarette, my favorie and I think the most compelling song, illustrates the scuzzy, deceptive world of patton, in what appears to be a love song, winds up a suicide note. the burt bacharach crooning is executed so flawlessy, I commend patton for his bravery.<br />the album creates a general sense of an all-too-real misery. even in the softer tunes, the lyrical/musical imagery invokes the same sense of dread and sickeningly dirtiness one experiences in clean surroundings. the feeling of uncleanliness in a sterile environment, a hospital bed or a hotel bathroom, where the silken veneer imbues you with a sickly, crawling fear that something lurks beneath. the unsettling harmonies suggest something is seriously wrong, askew in this picture. a true homage to california.<br />although it attacks many different subjects, it plays like a concept album. I think in general, there is a theme, that of deception, evil, and general craziness. from the psychotic meanderings to the grandiose, orchestrated numbers, California is a true work of fractured genius. the scary thing is, at some point, not only do you begin to doubt the sanity of bungle, you begin to doubt your own.

0064407667|5.0|(well - something slightly more than a ditty)<br />The Bad Beginning, the first in the Series of Unfortunate Events, by Lemony Snicket (Daniel Handler) with illustrations by Bret Helquist (magnificent) is a most fantastic book to be enjoyed by all ages (though, perhaps, mostly teens to adults).  Children below 12 or 13 might find this book more enjoyable read aloud.<br />The book is filled with dead-pan dark comedy that claims no happy ending, but, in reality, follows the archetypal story pattern as well as any other children's book.  There is the thrust of the Baudelaire children into the care of a distant relative (distant by blood, not proximity), Count Olaf, a dastardly man of the world.  The orphans pine after the freedom, comfort, protection, and library of home, finding a replacement in a Judge next door.  Count Olaf schemes to take the orphans' wealth (which they cannot touch until Violet, the eldest, comes of age).  The plan in thwarted by the orphans' intelligence and pluck, but their hopes of living with the Judge are also thwarted by the well-meaning, but impossibly stupid Mr. Poe - the family solicitor.  The orphans find themselves on their way to another relative's home - that of Montgomery Montgomery.<br />The Bad Beginning, like the other books in the series, are filled with large words and complex situations designed to teach younger people.  Mr. Snicket purposely uses big words, so he can define them in a non-teaching sort of way.  It seems only natural that he explain what words and ideas used by the adults in the book really mean - like nuptial law or puttanesca.  It is not dumbed-down or trite or like very other children's story.  It was a delight to read for this 22-year old English major, and I've got many of my friends now reading them, too.  <br />I did, however, wonder to myself what the children I bring into this world might think of the stories.  My conclusion was that I would most probably hold off telling these stories until they were around 8 or 9, because some of the concepts and ideas are much too broad-reaching.  An explanation of one situation might well lead into a discussion over any number of requisite ideas necessary for understanding such a thing as, say nuptial law.  I do not believe in sheltering children from many things, especially in literature, but even I must say that it might be a more enjoyable book for older readers.  Enjoyment, is after all, the primary reason for reading.
B000148KK2|5.0|If you are looking for Diana to continue her trend of recording jazz standards (which have always been most excellent), then this probably is not the album for you.  BUT!  If you want to see her stretch into some original or rarely heard music, jump on this puppy.  She has a talent that could only be the result of reincarnation, sounding soulful and stylistically up there with Ella and Sarah, but now we get to hear her own stuff as well as some of her hubby's influence (and I admit, I love Elvis too!) and even some Joni Mitchell thrown in for good measure.  If you can accept that people can change and grow, then give this a try.  If not, stick with her old stuff.
B00025ETIW|5.0|At first, I'll have to admit, I was very disappointed by the new album. I thought it was too poppy and that it didnt have the edge of the old album, it definatley didnt have the great drumming as it did in the first album. But then I just kept listening to it, and after it now being a month, Ive simply fallen in love with it. Yes it is poppy, but so is the old album. The old album just had a bad recording job and more anger, the new one is better recorded and Gerard was alot happier while writing the songs for this album. I highly recommend this album, youll love it! And I highly recommend their old album aswell.
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|After hearing this CD from start to finish, The Strokes have now become my favourite band. Every single song on the CD is catchy, and the style of the music is unique, from the pop-stylings of &quot;What Ever Happened&quot;, to the more rock n' roll of &quot;The Way It Is&quot; to the keyboardisque bass of &quot;12:51&quot; to the excellent guitar of &quot;Automatic Stop&quot;, every track is a whole new song, a whole new musical journey, The Strokes are definitely one of my musical influences, with me playing the drums, and now that I can play the whole CD, im very happy, Julian Casablancas' low-toned singing is very cool, with Fab Moretti's symbol-snare based drumming that I learned how to do, The Strokes also have 1 of the best style of clothing ever, I am starting to dress like them now, with there tight jeans, old t-shirts, jean jackets, messy hair, its just such a cool style. I highly reccomend this CD to any rock fans who are looking for something new. You Will Not Be Dissapointed!!!!
B0000AGWJ7|4.0|I find it sort of funny that the only people who have given this CD a bad review are people who don't even listen to heavy music, or who people have a problem with they way these guys dress (Hot Topic clothes, black finger nail polish, etc). Don't let the way they look dissuade you. <BR>Everything I think about this CD has pretty much been said already. The only reason I didn't give this CD 5 stars is because I own hundreds of albums it's hard to give anything five stars. Still a very good album, good lyrics (they're not pathetic childish high school lyrics). Listen to song samples or go to their website for MP3s and see for yourself.
B00006JL1Z|5.0|I've always been happy with my Fleetwood Mac Box Set (4 discs; 72 songs) and the 1990 Greatest Hits.  But this double CD collection has sixteen more songs than the one from fourteen years prior.  These include such unforgettable classics like, &quot;Monday Morning&quot;, &quot;Silver Springs&quot;, &quot;Landslide&quot;, &quot;Think About Me' and &quot;Gold Dust Woman&quot;.  &quot;Family Man&quot; and &quot;Big Love (live)&quot; are some clever Buckingham numbers, but not great.  The videos on this Double CD are nice to watch, but one viewing will be all you'll probably need.  Still, with the complete and exhaustive Box Set hard to find  (and expensive), this surpasses the 1990 Greatest Hits collection by far.  This is much more for the average interested fan, but also required for the collector - so it works for everyone.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Everyone who rated this less than 4 stars was too dumb to figure out what was going on, so this movie requires at least a certain amount of intelligence.  <br />The masterfull editing is what makes this film really shine.  As most have already guessed, it's done so that the film is backwards.  Why?  So the viewer has the same short term memmory problem the main character does.  He doesn't know why he's in a strange looking motel, and neither does the view.  See?  It makes sense.  Fantastic film, the ending is the best too.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I have never seen Buffy nor Angel, nor have I ever wanted to, vampires not being my thing, but I read the other comments on Amazon and thought I'd take the chance and buy something I'd had no idea about...and...I am SO GLAD!    This show is wonderful, well-written, top of the notch acting, smart, coherent stories, and on top of that it's got this glorious touch of humor which can leave you just giggling for a long time after the episode is done.  In an amazingly short number of episodes, the writing takes you in, you get to learn about these characters and care for them all, each with their pros and cons, some have more flaws than others -- all are human (not superperfect superhuman) and it's very real on that level.    The only downside, and it's a serious one, is that it's been cancelled by imbeciles in charge at Fox...my goodness, what is this world coming to when such a superb show can be cancelled so wrongfully early.  I miss it enormously, I wish, wish there would be more!  Well, there is going to be a movie, at least that.    Give it a chance, support Firefly, you won't be sorry because it's tv at it's best, and that's pretty rare.      Addendum added 2005: I know I started out not interested in Buffy/Angel, but after seeing this show, it struck me that Whedon was a genius, so I gave those shows a shot, (not a small financial investment, either, a total of 12 DVD sets) and guess what? Whedon IS a genius, and I am now an avid \\"Bangel\\" this is not a review of Buffy/Angel so I won't get into it here, but thank you Firefly for opening up an entire new universe to me!!!
B00005JMFQ|2.0|Too many stories crammed into one movie.  And the result is none of them are developed very well.  Too bad.  Because some of them were worth embelishment and some could have been dropped altogether.  Can't recommend this as a purchase.
B00005JLXE|1.0|This movie was terrible in my opinion.  Affleck did a horrible job, and contrary to what most other people seem to think, I think that Collin Farell did a terrible job as well.  His character was so incredibly annoying that I turned off the TV at least 3 times before finishing the movie...I just couldn't take it.  There are about as many plot twists and turns as a hardy boys story.  The movie is not dark in a Gothic sense at all in my opinion, like an Underworld or something of the sort, the romance was too cheesy and pathetic to give a dark undertone to the movie.  The costumes and martial arts moves were laughable (oh my goodness let me just do a few backflips which will somehow make me avoid dozens of glass shards being thrown at me).  The plot seemed so underdeveloped that the movie seemed incomplete.  The connections between his &quot;day job&quot; and &quot;night job&quot; were explained little to none, making his lawyer &quot;day job&quot; seem pointless.  The fact that he can jump on buildings and swing on things isnt too fully explained, nor the fact that his love interest can do crouching tiger style leaps.  there are some other bad parts but I dont want to give the entire movie away...<BR>Granted, this isnt my type of movie, but spider man and X-men were probably 10 times better than this trash.
B00004RFFI|4.0|From the minds of Michael Crichton and Steven Spielberg, Twister has a tornado instead of a T-Rex.  The score even reminds you of Jurassic Park.  But despite this, Twister is a real nail-biter.  I started out watching it sitting on the couch, and ended up on the floor closer to the screen at the end.  The weather effects are amazing - and scary.  The tornados are real-looking, but so are the sky, the clouds, the wind, and the mood - which hooks you in.<br />The romance between tornado-chaser Jo (Helen Hunt) and Bill (Bill Paxton), is predictable, but it is still interesting to see how it unfolds.  CSI's Jamie Gertz plays the third-wheel fiancee, trailing along in hot pursuit of the storms because Jo is still sitting on the divorce papers.  Her refined, Southern character is funny in contrast to Hunt's boot-stomping, full-throttle lifestyle.<br />Helen Hunts leads a huge pack of nerds who compromise her tornado-chasing team.  It is interesting to note that Hunt is the only attractive woman in the film.  It was like the casting agent deliberately surrounded her with unattractive women.  Even her mother as a little girl is a big, beefy, homely farm woman, and her father is a typical redneck.  How such a pretty girl could come from them, I don't know.  One of my favorite characters is Jo's aunt.  She is very unique.
B00009V7T2|5.0|Before I bought this CD, I had never heard of Mars Volta, At the Drive In or myriad other bands mentioned by reviewers of this recording I take to be much younger than myself. But though there is more good music being made than one could possibly hear in a lifetime, I listen to my share of it and more.<BR>De-Loused In the Comatorium is a CD I encountered quite by accident and so I bought it on a whim. I am always on the lookout for new and interesting music and there was something about the packaging that told me I was in for a great musical ride. And so I was!<BR>Several reviewers mentioned Led Zeppelin as a point of reference for use when describing this music. Yes, indeed, but it is also much more than that. The music and the lyrics are arresting, demanding the listener's attention from start to finish. These guys are top-flight musicians.<BR>I like the entire CD, but to me the highlights are Inertiatic Esp, Roulette Dares, Eriatarka, and Cicatriz Esp. The enigmatic liner notes in the accompanying booklet add a jolt to the tension generated by the music.<BR>My musical interests run wide and deep. This CD is one of the most unusual and compelling I've heard this year. If a streak of musical adventure runs through you, I highly recommend that you get this nightmarish yet wonderful recording. You won't be disappointed.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|When my parents first suggested I watch this with them on VHS when they purchesd it many years ago, I was about seven. I wasn't sure what to expect but I remember loving all the colors in the film and the romance.<br />I purchased it for Father's day on DVD for my father because our VHS copy went bad, and I'm glad I did. The color is even richer and the music sounds incredible. Even better then when I first saw it!<br />I highly suggest you buy it!
B00009V7OL|4.0|I always had The Abyss on my to-see list and now I finally have. I was not dissapointed for it feels a little like an underwater 'Close Encounters'. The effects are great, the water space aliens are wonderful and the first time view of the underwater city is breathtaking.<br />The morale of the movie is bad. Americans and Russians are screwing up the world so the aliens try to prevent it. 'Can't we all just get along!?' is what they want for us, then things will turn to better. <br />Industrial Light and magic did a great job again in this 1989 movie, it's worth seeing for SF fans.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I was Very Very pleased with this ablum. the sound on this album is alot harder then her frist album but still pop. Avril's lyrics are always and stays the best part of the album but every song has its own sound only insult about this album is not long enough for me to fully love :( but still i give it a 5. Its to bad that avril holds her self back *_*...
B00000IB40|5.0|A mile stone album<BR>Reviewer: Rodney Gavin Bullock from Winchester, Hampshire United Kingdom<BR>This is a key album in the output of this great chanteuse. Her early songs were straightforward in meaning, though emotionally often very powerful. 'Message Personnel' (1973) represents a big advance in sophistication and the words have become more ambiguous and more subtle. Even if you have the words on paper, school boy French and a large dictionary will often not get you very far. Never mind, more than any other singer I know, she conveys the emotions purely with her uniquely beautiful voice, a voice laden with tenderness, humanity and intelligence. <BR>The songs on this disc are all of the highest quality, with a mixture of the lyrical and more rhythmic. 'Premiere recontre' is by Michel Berger and his collaboration on this album seems to suit Franoise' style down to the ground. The orchestration is inventive and adds considerably to the impact of the songs. I will mention two songs in a little more detail. 'Beuceuse' (Cradle Song) is about a woman watching her sleeping lover - his breathing, sighs and stillness. She imagines his dreams. But at the end she recognises that things will be the same tomorrow, implying things are not too good when he is awake. This is set to music of touching tenderness and simplicity. The masterpiece on the disc is the last, 'Message Personnel'(Hardy, Berger). In my view it is one of the greatest love songs of all time, with an almost overwhelming emotional impact. It starts with her talking to her lover, apparently on the telephone but is she? Is it in her head? She wants to say loving things to him but she cannot. Why? What has happened? We do not know. The talking ends and she sings gently, building to an impassioned climax. I would buy the CD for this alone.
0061015725|4.0|The book makes one shudder at the thought of Nano Technology. Even though this is a cool technology that will make our lives far more eventful... rather like living in Star Trek era....<br />Mr. Chichton used his suspense to the ultimate limit in this book and makes it quite difficult to put the book down. He has a knack to discuss and explain high end technologies in simple and easy terms that are easily comprehensible by an average joe ...<br />I cannot wait for his next title to come out ....
B00006EXDM|5.0|I first got this record about the time it first came out, in foot-wide flying-saucer vinyl, in 1972.  (You know what I miss about vinyl?  The huge, vivid jackets!) It was the first rock record I ever purchased; at the time I'd heard like three Stones cuts (\\"Ruby Tuesday\\"; \\"Satisfaction\\"; \\"The Last Time\\"...and maybe \\"I Wanna Be Your Man\\"...or was that the Beatles' version...?), had heard tons of Beatles music, and was more of a Beatles than a Stones fan.  Hot Rocks changed that very, very quickly.  It's still, and always will be, the best available introduction to the Rolling Stones.<br /><br />I've heard a number of reviewers grouse, with cause, about the two-disc format.  (In vinyl, necessary, plus it generated more cover art!  But if you can get \\"Exile on Main Street\\" on one CD, you can do it here too.)  I've heard others argue for a merger of \\"Hot Rocks\\" and \\"More Hot Rocks.\\"  A two-CD set of the two records?  A blow for music fans everywhere.  (Make the CD case bigger!  Load up on that cover art!)<br /><br />But please don't talk about merging these in the name of \\"dropping filler.\\"  For one thing, both of these records had incredible, well, cover art.  None of it should be lost.  More importantly:  each of these holds together better not only than anyone else's Greatest Hits, but also better than most made-to-be-together studio collections.  The sequencing is impeccable; and the records really do represent the band's best work.  Most of it, anyway.<br /><br />You will know whether or not you are a Stones Fan after a few good listens to \\"Hot Rocks\\" and \\"More Hot Rocks\\".  I went on to buy pretty much every studio record they did between 1965 and 1990.  But I didn't need and haven't bought any more hits collections.  Thse two will do you.  The Stones' post-\\"Exile\\" work really doesn't support any collections.  (An occasional gem -- \\"Goats Head Soup,\\" \\"Steel Wheels,\\" one or two others -- surfaces from the murk.  But the album must be bought.  The best of post-\\"Exile\\" Stones can't be had on any collection.) I heard it suggested by an \\"Exile\\" reviewer that for the rock fan who just wants the best of the Stones, \\"Hot Rocks\\" and \\"Exile\\" would be sufficient.  It would be hard to argue, if one insists on being casual.  But beware.  You are more likely to become hooked.  And this is a good -- a very good -- thing.<br /><br />I rarely listen to the hits collections now; I have the studio albums.  But when I put them on, boy does it take me back, and make me feel good.  It's like they were cut by the group itself in the studio, no middleman no marketing, meant to sound that way.  On vinyl, CD, SACD, tin cans, whatever.  Long live the Rolling Stones.  And they'll always start here.on any collection.)

0060512806|5.0|This is a large, messy post-modern masterpiece. The novel's nearest comparisons are not science fiction (since this is not a SIFI novel or not much of one) but other novels that take a single intellectual point of inquiry and run a universe around that point (e.g., Dellio's Underworld or Pynchon's Mason and Dixon). The advantage Stephenson has over Dellio is that the central idea (how life is one big information system) is more interesting than the one in Underworld and the novel is just plain more fun. This is one of my favorite post-modern novels, and one that I think about often.
B0001ZX0PG|4.0|Clint Eastwood has made another powerful film that, like his brutal Western UNFORGIVEN, plunges into the murky depths of justice and evil.<br />In UNFORGIVEN, the story's impetus is a brutalized prostitute.  In MYSTIC, it's a molested child.  Gene Hackman's Oscar-winning lawman now becomes Sean Penn's Oscar-winning backroom gangster and the moment of evil revealing itself--Clint's final snarling threats as he rides out of UNFORGIVEN and Laura Linney's whispered justifications in MYSTIC--are unsettling and disorienting.<br />Exactly as Clint meant them to be.<br />Am I saying they're the same movie?  No.  Each one stands on its own and the performances are outstanding in both.<br />But both films take its viewers into dark uncharted waters where there are no white hats or black hats.<br />Like life, they're just not that easy.
B000002LK1|3.0|This is a good album but the reviews here i think are from mostly die-hard fans who can get a little carried away. I like depeche mode don't get me wrong but the casual lyrics lack a passion  and the accompanying slow systematic techno-pop arrangements just don't inspire me. Best songs i think are &quot;Halo&quot;, &quot;Clean&quot; and &quot;Policy of truth&quot;. Still I rate none of these songs over 7/10 and i have listened to the album 5-6 times. If you're new to DM buy anyone of the Singles collections or 101. I just bought this because i was curious, but really it isn't a must if you're a casual DM fan like myself.
B000148KK2|1.0|I have been a huge fan of Diana Krall especially her live in paris dvd,She simply takes my breath away every time I see her perform. Anyway I bought this C.d and the great thing I can say about it is it has got a fantastic cover but fans dont be tempted to open it. These songs should have been left  as test pieces in the studio. She has got enormous talent I just hope her next Album will blow me away.
B000002U82|5.0|At the age of maybe 5, I remember listening to Pink Foyd's &quot;Another Brick In the Wall part II&quot; this was on a 45 I am, 28.  My sister and I played the record so much that it now has no sound coming out of it.  The other side was never listened to (One of My Turns).  The day my family finally got a CD player I listened to this CD.  The beginnig of &quot;Time&quot; literally had me jumping out of my seat because I was doing my homework and I was nice and relaxed.  The second time I listened to this CD I knew it was coming and I still jumped.  When I was 18 my sister, my then best friend and my sister's then boyfriend (now husband) and I went to see them at Giant's Stadium. This was the tour they went on to promote Division Bell and they performed this whole CD in the concert.  And as far as the one negative review is concerned, DO NOT PAY ANY ATTENTION TO HIM HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT.  THIS MUST BE A VERY GOOD CD IF IT'S BEEN ON THE BILLBOARDS SINCE 1973!!!!  THIS CD CAME OUT TWO YEARS BEFORE I WAS EVEN BORN SO  I MUST HAVE BEEN BORN TWICE? ONCE IN 1973 AND AGAIN IN  1975
0385474547|4.0|I picked this book off a list in a course in college etitled 'diversity and minority groups'. It's funny how often I have haphazardly came across books that end up being truly incredible to me. <BR>This book takes place in Africa... a land and people that I know very little about. This book gave me a good deal of insight and was very interesting. At some points it was a bit hard for me to keep up as the timeline in the story is not a straight line. What I enjoyed most about this book is a fascinating look at some African beliefs and cultural practices regarding spirituality. <BR>This book does not contain any fairy-tale ending however it does contain some strong messages. The main character deals with all sorts of issues both external and internal. The latter half of this book describes the invasion by christian missionaries and how they essentially destroyed a once vibrant and unique culture. A good read for anyone who wants to explore other cultures/beliefs.
B00005JMUA|4.0|Tarantino is really a great director who manages, in his movies, to extract the best from the actors! In Kill Bill 2, he gets great performances from the pair David Carradine and Uman Thurman.<br />The premise of these movies seemed very simple in the first one: \\"Tarantino decides to make an action movie!\\". The guy mixed and homaged most of the best things in old martial arts movies, like Indiana Jones in the 80's - 90's revisited some of the best parts of old adventure movies from the 40's - 50's, just adding new modern elements, and a new look at those things.<br />What's great in these movies is the fact that Tarantino really does a homage! In this second movie, when he gives those zooms in the \\"Pai-Mei's touching his beard look\\" it's impossible not to laugh, and, at the same time, try to understand why in Kill Bill this is so cool, while in those old B-movies these scenes were just... well... not so great!<br />Other point about these two movies is the balance and contrast between them. The first is pure action and hints for some reflection. The second is a bit more reflection and less action, which makes it very interesting to watch them together.<br />In this second one we finally see some of the motivations (or over-motivations, or better over-reactions that caused the events in the first movie). There's also a nice trick about the bride's name and her relationship with Bill. We can see that some details have been given already in the first movie, we just have missed them in a first glance!<br />The ending of this movie is that made me feel a bit disappointed though! As I put in the title, this is all great! Kill Bill is pure-over-the-top-movie-technique, and there's no way I could give less than 99 stars of 100 to it. Maybe, it's just a matter of taste, by my part, by I didn't like the death of Bill...<br />I'm sure this is no spoiler,  this is the movie title, and in the trailers they already told us that \\"the Bride will Kill Bill\\". This is a vengeance movie and he is supposed to die, because he makes bad things.<br />However, in my humble opinion, the trouble is that we get to know him more than we should! I mean, we find out about his story with the Bride, we know what he has done and felt for her, we figure out that he isn't an one-dimensional bad guy, etc. That is, he could even be a main anti-hero character in other movie (called just Bill Kills), and people would love him!<br />The way things are shown, kill him becomes something not so easy, and, unfortunately, not very satisfactory either!<br />When I saw an interview with Uma Thurman, and she said the movie was about a lot of things, including redemption, I couldn't disagree more! This is not a movie about redemption at all.<BR>In no moment the bride considers the hypothesis of forgiving any of the guys that messed with her! Or, otherwise, consider that it might not be wise to kill one or other of them! That she could just punish them somehow, but not necessarily kill them! <br />In the end, she becomes just a one-dimensional character. When everything is said and done, we see that there wasn't any moment when the movie could change its route. Kill Bill doesn't transcend those old vengeance martial arts that inspired it! It gives a new look at them, but it is still one of them, maybe one of the best of them, but I wouldn't say superior, in no way! <br />Well, there's hope... Who knows we won't see a third movie, and we just find out that Pai Mei didn't really teached the Bride the fatal technique that kills Bill in the end. Who knows, we won't see something like Pai Mei, in spirit, waking up Bill...
B00005B36H|5.0|this is a really great album.peroid.its hard for me to put into words how much i love this album it has to be one of my favorites. all of the songs are put together nicely and the instruments just come together great. you may sit and listen to the vocals and then drift to the guitars or the bass or even drums b/c everything has its own individual uniqueness on the album. Go buy it and other tool cds also. if you play bass tool is great stuff to play
B000002JSN|5.0|Led Zeppelin, arguably the greatest rock n'roll band of all time (I actually rate the Stones #1 and Zep 1A whatever that means), released their masterpiece in February 1975 (and a double album to boot). 'Physical Graffiti' is a must have for any hard rock fan of any age. This landmark double LP has it all: Metal, World Music, Blues, Folk, Funk, Country and even Rockabilly. Of the first these are some of the heaviest and best tracks Zep ever recorded, \\"The Rover\\" (one of Page's most awesome riffs), \\"Sick Again\\" (sleazy underage groupie sex at its finest), \\"Custard Pie\\" (sex and desserts), \\"In My Time of Dying\\" (simply amazing, the loudest drums ever!!!), \\"Houses of the Holy\\" (obviously left off the previous album) and \\"The Wanton Song\\" (more sleaze) can headbang with the best of 70's metal. \\"Kashmir\\", the album's magnum opus, is a sprawling, atmospheric gem of Middle Eastern mystery featuring both Jones and Bonham at their greatest powers. \\"Trampled Underfoot\\" is incredibly funky and heavy with awesome lyrics as Plant compares his woman to a suped-up automobile. Country blues with \\"Black Country Woman\\" (hilarious 'gotta get this airplane outta here' intro) and rockabilly with \\"Boogie with Stu\\". There are many other highlights to choose from, everybody probably has their own favorite (my personal faves would be \\"Rover\\", \\"Sick\\" and \\"Trampled\\"). I love this album above all Zep's masterworks and also consider it Jimmy Page's ultimate triumph as a guitarist, songwriter and producer....flawless. 'Graffiti' is THE 1970's hard rock record. By the way, why would someone who doesn't know anything about rock music bother to rate acknowledged masterpieces with one star?? Please stick to your Britany and Justin CD's before you make more of a fool out of yourself.

B000002U9L|5.0|This CD is great! As a matter of fact, it is why I like the Movie so much. The Movie is a little weird, but it has a magical edge to it that makes it a one in a million kind of movie. It is one of my all time favorite movies because of the creativity that it has. I like the movie a lot.  David Bowie does a great job in the Movie as the Goblin King and also singing and doing his music. The best songs on the soundtrack are &quot;Magic Dance&quot;, &quot;Chilly Down&quot;, &quot;Under Ground&quot;, and &quot;Into the Labyrinth&quot;. As a matter of fact in all seriousness, &quot;Magic Dance&quot; is one of David's best songs ever. It is not his best, but it has a fun feel to it that will make you listen to the CD over and over again. So buy this CD, you'll love it and listen to it over and over again!
B000003CMB|5.0|To many music lovers, Duane Allman's guitar playing was the heart and soul of The Allman Brothers Band, and after his death in 1972 the band would never be the same. Citing the Miles Davis album Kind of Blue as his biggest influence, Duane's bluesy guitar playing revolutioned rock and roll and helped establish The Allman Brothers as the leaders of southern rock. Although their few studio albums were landmarks, they were known for their live performances. The live material captured on Live at the Fillmore East is from some of the most famous and highly regarded concerts in all of rock and roll not only by critics but by musicians as well. These recordings are one of a kind and they are an essential part of music from the 20th century.
0743455967|1.0|Amazing how money and success can blind so many people to the truth as shown in these sparkling reviews.  In this book, King goes on about his childhood, early victories in writing and on and on.  He then gives some advice on writing which I found to be completely false.  He writes that unless you are a &quot;born writer&quot; you can become a good one with a lot of hard work, but forget about being a great one.  Complete and utter garbage.  Its falling for lies like this that many people think that great writing is something akin to witchcraft.  It is not.  Common sense tells you that if writers are working as hard as they claim, they should be getting better all the time.  They are not because their claim to hard work is false.  Then of course you have writers like King who imply that you have to be touched by the &quot;muse&quot; to be successful. This leaves the would be writer confused on what is going on.  If he takes his eye off of the star of success and lays it on the truth, it will all become clear.  I am not impressed by Kings fiction and even less by this book.  He is not a master and far from a genius.  He had the gall to imply that Brams Stoker's masterwork Dracula is the work of a hack!  That should tell you something about his own works.  If you want to learn to write learn from the true masters like Stoker, Wells, Faulkner and Jones.  Read and study their books carefully and write a lot and one day you will be among the best.  As for Kings books... forget it.
B00008973A|5.0|I can't believe all the negative reviews I am reading for this film, but then again, I haven't seen the stage version, so I can't compare. The film adaptation of &quot;A Chorus Line&quot; is the quintessential backstage musical, a celebration of the lives and tribulations of the dancers who turn up by the hundreds to audition for a handful of jobs on Broadway. <br />The simple story goes like this: A choreographer is casting eight dancers for a new musical, and during one long and truthful day he auditions hundreds of dancers before he makes his final selection. The remaining dozen pour out their hearts and souls through song and dance, all desperate for a part, and all deserving of one. We learn about their lives, loves, fears, and sacrifices through the brilliant lyrics.<br />From what I understand, Richard Attenborough's film treatment of the story sticks to the outlines of the stage version, although he takes the liberty to fill in the details of the choreographer's old romance, and he leaves out some of the original songs to make room for new ones. I think it's a wonderful idea, and hey, for me, it works.<br />The result may not please purists who want a film record of what they saw on stage, but this is one of the most intelligent and compelling movie musicals in a long time. Everybody, at one time or another, has been on a line similar to this one--anxious to be accepted and terrified of being rejected by someone judging his or her worth. <br />Attenborough (Gandhi) makes the most of this dramatic tension, along with the hopefulness of all those in the audition. Best of all, he captures the vibrancy of modern dance from the free-form confusion of the opening scenes to the high-stepping kicks of the finale. <br />This is truly one of the most underrated films EVER, an emotional, powerful, and anxious musical definitely worth seeing. Give it a chance, it won't hurt!
B0002234LS|4.0|Secret Window is an entertaining film.  David Koepp (Stir of Echoes) directs the movie beautifully with a well written script.  Johnny Depp does another wonderfull job acting.  As a whole, the movie holds up well.  The only problem i have with judging this film is that i made the mistake of reading the short story (in Twelve Past Midnight by Stephen King).  I came into the theater with preconceptions, and the film was really different than the story.  Koepp changed the ending, which i was dissaponted with just because it was different, but the one he replaces it with holds up.  But after the movie was over, i thought that the movie was decent, and deserves more people to watch it.  It didnt do so well box-office wise back in March which suprised me.  But a word to the wise, rent this movie, you will be pleased
0618526412|5.0|This luminously beautiful book shows a collection of misfits trying to make sense of the complications of their lives.  How anyone with a brain and a heart could possibly find it boring is beyond me.
B000050FEN|2.0|I really, really didn't like this movie. Really. It really is an affront to human dignity. Oh of course, it's super-clever, and superbly realised and quite intelligently put together and well-acted and packs a hard punch. I am not denying any of that. What I find so offensive is that this film deliberately co-opts and manipulates the viewer into identifying with and sympathising with darkness. I would almost say that the making of this film verges on being a criminal act against human decency. I am not an old, grey-haired prudish conservative. I'm young, I'm handsome, I'm pretty, I'm intelligent and as cool as they come and I have to say that this is one of the very few films I have watched that has left me feeling morally contaminated. Another reviewer who expressed similar views has received 11 unhelpful votes. I take these to mean - 'shut up and don't spoil the party for the rest of us'. You folks are at one party I don't want no piece of. Good luck to you !
B000062YAZ|4.0|While other bands went through a sort of commercialization of sound in the 80s, Slayer, along with thrash peers Metallica, Exodus, and Megadeth all stayed true to metal. This, for Slayer, is not more evident than their 1986 album, Reign in Blood. What some consider the most brutal metal album of all time, is a cacophony of ultra aggressive, extremely fast paced music. More than half the album's songs do not even pass the 3:00 minute mark. The album opens with the legendary &quot;Angel of Death&quot; which sets the pace for the rest of the album. While most of the songs are aimlessly about death, satanism, and purgatory, Slayer seems unmatched in precision. The rapid fire guitar riffs of the duo Hannemann and King are among the tightest they've ever played while Tom Araya screams to the top of his lungs. The drumming, while quite fast, terribly lacks in variation but is neccessary for the album's goal: tearing your head off. This is the most aggressive Slayer album of the 80s and deserves the recognition it gets when people talk about its influence on metal.
0142004235|4.0|I found this a difficult read, but ultimately rewarding, and it wouldn't be fair to give such a well-written book anything less than 4 stars just because it wasn't written in my preferred style. \\"East of Eden\\" is a sort of repeat of the Biblical Abel and Cain story in modern times, in modern terms. A masterpiece of American literature. I'm usually not a big Steinbeck fan, I prefer Hemingway and F. Scott Fitsgerald. But even I felt the power of this book and I couldn't stop reading. You'll never forget the Trusks. <br />David Rehak<BR>(...)

I'm going to have to buy my own copy so I'll have it at my fingertips whenever I need a laugh.

B00000255F|5.0|I don't really have much to add on to what has already been said about this album.  I'm just gonna re-confirm it.  Yes, it's one of the greatest albums of all-tim.  Yes, the poetry is unreal.  Bruce Springsteen's skills to tell stories is also unreal.  The drumming and keyboarding is less showboaty here than in the previous albums.  More evident in this album than the other previous ones, Springsteen also really flexes his romantic poetry muscles.  This album rules.  The album cover rules (except Clarence Clemons on the sax is cut out).  I have it as my desktop wallpaper.
B00008PX8P|5.0|What can i say? How long have zep fans been waiting for this? Years! And was it worth it? Course it was! Worth every single penny i spent on it and more. <BR>Previously all us zepheads have had was the song remains the same, great concert by anyone,s standards but falling short by Zep,s mighty high standard,s. Dont get me wrong of course I love the song remains the same, but in places you can tell they were at the end of a long tour and just a bit worn out. They have as much admitted it themselves.<BR>Anyhow on with the matter in hand, this is fantastic stuff, you can see how good they really were. It,s great to see it in chronological order from 1970 to 1979. In the first concert i was quite surprised to see how raw they were in their early days, almost like a club band notihng like the larger than life phenomenon we all know and love them for. In an era where bands can seem very unanimated and half hearted on stage it,s great to see four top class musicans playing as if their lives were at stake. This can particurlarly be seen in the Knebworth footage where there is almost a sense of desperation in Pagey,s and bonzo,s playing. So much for being dinosours! Also the clarity of the Earl,s Court footage is amazing` you wouldnt believe it was such a big venue. <BR>Check of particular interest the difference of 'whole lotta love ' the first is really raw and the second version practically goes hip hop in the middle.<BR> Thank you Mr Page it was well worth the wait.
B000001ESF|5.0|I really wouldn't say this is Rush's most accesible album or anything, but it is definately one of their best (not saying it's their best either).  The epic title track is of course the heart of this album.  The amazing story (by Neil Peart with inspiration from Ann Rynd) has got to be one of the most spacey prog stories written for rock.  But the thing that really sticks out the most for me is the guitaring of Alex Lifeson in this album.  ESPECIALLY in the title track.  Amazing tone, amazing speed, amazing feel for the song.  As the guy that often gets the least attention out of the trio (Neil Peart being the best drummer in the world and Geddy Lee being the best at bass), he really stands out here with his amazing guitaring.
0517122707|1.0|I was really looking forward to this book but then found myself force reading to finish it.  Part of the problem is that I really took a dislike to the main character - a completely worthless individual who all you learn from is how not to be.  If you like to be inspired by stories this is not for you.  <br />(I didn't even find it amusing - are fart jokes really worth a Pulitzer?)
B00006CXXU|5.0|I'm so impressed by how Christina decided to change her style and by how she uses her vocals on each song on this album with the strength of the voice she has as she belts out the songs with passion! The song, &quot;Fighter&quot;, says it all as she sings her heart out as loudly as she can and you can just hear the strenght in her voice like never before on her first album, &quot;Christina Aguilera&quot;. This is something that not all artists can accomplish, and it's just simply amazing to a hear a voice so beautiful on this type of record! The intro is just simply marvelous and breath-taking as she sings about finally being able to be who she is now rather than who she was in the first place! This album gets 5 stars! It's worth your money and it's worth the listen for those who are Christina Aguilera fans!
B00006CXSS|5.0|Hey GI Joe,people like you are ruining this country. show a little more respect for this country and for these men. They saved the world and put their life on the line so that you could have freedoms. Steven spielberg and tom hanks did an amazing job portrating WWII, and anyone who read the book and liked it will love the show. It is one of the most accurate war movies ever created. No detail is left out. Ir is both historically accurate and entertainin, which is rare. If you are interested in this dvd, don't listen to G.I. Joe. Buy it and i garuntee that you will love it.
B00005QHPQ|5.0|Gosh! I love this album! The BEST CD I have ever listen to. Very good music. If you ask what's my favorite song would be and I would pick &quot;Love To See You Cry&quot; because it is very touchful feeling and very beautiful background of music and good beats and very heavy bass. Perfect words in it. Your the BEST Enrique. I vote you a 5 stars! - Tyson Love from Robesonia, PA USA
B00006CXSS|3.0|Like many of those who purchased the DVD set, I had seen the original on HBO, and later on the History Channel.  I consider it one of the best looks at those who took part in combat in WWII, and looked forward to getting the DVD set for my collection.<br />But (and I consider this to be a big but) when I popped in the the DVD and went to set up the subtitles, there was no option for English subtitiles (I could have changed to Spanish subtitles if I was fluent in Spanish.  But I digress)! No problem, I thought, I'll just switch to Closed Captioning on my TV; after all, when I saw it on TV it was Closed Captioned.  Imagine my shock and surprise when the Closed Captioning that was included in the broadcast version was missing from the DVD.  Ironically, as I finished watching an episode on the DVD, there was another episode airing on the History Channel - with the Close Captioning!<br />While Closed Captioning is a luxury for me - I can hear well enough, but enjoy the Closed Captioning to catch nuances in the dialog - I can't help but think that this would be a big deal for older viewers - say, those who actually lived through the war.<br />I give this DVD 3 stars - not for the content, which is superb, but for the lack of foresight that saw the release of this DVD with neither English subtitles or Closed Captioning - which had already been done for the broadcast!
B000099T2L|5.0|I'm so adicted to Beyonc. I'm her number 1 fan! Beyonc has to be my favorite performer. She is a very talented actress, writer, dancer, and this cd proves that she is also a very talented singer. Dangerously In Love has all the positive aspects that people look for in a cd. From the pop vibe of Crazy In Love to the sexy, danchall flow of Baby Boy to the more slow, vocal balads such as Speechless and Dangerously In Love 2.

6305364648|5.0|True Lies is an action romp with several story lines that flow into each other for the big climax.  Harry (Arnold) and Helen (Jamie Lee) are in a stereotypical middle-class marriage where the husband is totally career focused and because he is \\"successful\\" he thinks all is well at home.  Helen is bored and miserable because she feels invisible to her husband.  Their daughter Dana (Eliza Dushku - Faith from Buffy) is alienated from them both and headed down a very bad path.<br />Harry has a secret life as a spy for a super secret government organization.  His partner is Albert (Tom Arnold in his best role / performance anywhere) and they are closer to each other than to anyone else in their lives as they travel the world saving us all from the bad guys.<br />The terrorism they are battling could have been ripped from today's headlines.  However, I doubt such a film could be made today because of political sensitivities.  I was surprised how much of it held up.<br />But this film is about fun more than drama.  The action is exciting, but preposterous and the scale of the action crescendos toward the final ridiculous aspect of Harry flying a Harrier jet while saving his daughter, fighting the big bad guy and fending off an attacking helicopter all at the same time.  Another problem, a small one for this kind of action film, is the endless weapons fire focused at the heroes to no effect, while Helen can simply drop a machine pistol down the stairs and wipe out a platoon.  It is a delightful seen, however.  If you can suspend disbelief for this, the movie can be a lot of fun.<br />Many have called the film misogynistic, and I suppose you can see some of that in the film.  But Bill Paxton's wonderful performance as the sleazebag Simon is easily the most despised person in the film and he is a male.<br />There are other find performances in the film.  Faisal, played wonderfully by Grant Heslov (we should see more of him), is a terrific character who holds a lot of the story line together even though his role isn't that large.  And Tia Carrere as the mercenary art dealer Juno is simply one of the best things in the movie.  Art Malik is great as the villain Salim Abu Aziz.  Mr. Malik provides the right kind of energy for such an over the top film.  He provides the kind of passionate megalomania that makes all the fighting seem appropriate.<br />With all the sub-plots weaving in and out, the humor, and the fine performances, I think this is one of Arnold Schwartzenegger's best films.  And I thought his pairing with Tom Arnold was great.  Too bad we never saw them together again.tory line together even though his role isn't that large.

B0000C1733|4.0|rhcp have been around for a very long time, in fact they debuded the same year as metallic.  so obviously if you want an intire greatest hits collection for a band as great as chili peppers you would need at least 2 cds.  the cd covers most of the recent hits (mothers milk to present) pretty good but it is missing can't stop, around the world, and it wouldn't hurt to have a few more songs from mothers milk and one hot minute.  so people stop giving this cd such a hard time about not having all their greatest hits ever, duh, you can't fit that many songs on one disc.  but it's still an easier and more affordable way to get your favorite rhcp songs.  the cd is obviously incomplite but overall is worth buying for someone who doesnt have all the studio albums.  by the way if you want to get into the more 80s funk/punk style of the chili peppers i suggest buying what hits along with this cd (you would have use 2 discs to fit all their hits on anyway).
B0001DI0FI|5.0|There are some reviewers here who have called \\"Master And Commander-The Far Side of the World\\" a boring movie.  Well, if you are looking for Hollywood formulaic fare, then maybe this would be true.<br /><br />But this one is different.  I did not see it in the theatres.  I bought the extended 2-dvd set based on the reputation of the movie, and the good experience I had when I bought the extended set of \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\".<br /><br />The movie is great.  Like some reviewers previously mentioned, at first, I thought there wasn't much going on, but on second and third viewings, I started to catch more of the nuances of the film and became a fan.  Russell Crowe is the new Richard Burton.  They both have what it takes to play the part of this Captain; Crowe is excellent in the part.  I have been a \\"noticer\\"(i.e. \\"One who notices\\") of Paul Bettany ever since I saw him in \\"A Knights Tale\\".  Other cast members are placed equally well.  When you watch this movie, the story will grow on you as you notice more and more of the details.<br /><br />That said, now to the issue of the 2-DVD set.  Save your money.  Buy the cheaper single DVD.<br /><br />I have not been impressed with the features on the second DVD, a lot of the commentary is self-aggrandizement on the part of the Director (Weir) and he doesn't talk about what I want to hear.  He stands in a room surrounded by wonderful antiques, and then says nothing about them. But, he gives the store where he bought them a plug!  I bet they paid him for that.  There is a model of a ship on the desk like one shown in the movie.  Is it the same one?  Who knows? He doesn't say.  There are two ships in the movie, the Surprise and the Acheron.  We are told a small snippet about the Surprise having been the Rose that was purchased for the movie, but are told nothing about the Acheron.  Was it a real ship or just computer graphics?<br /><br />And, this galls me the most, they re-use footage of commentary in different parts of the features.  You see the same thing over and over.  The little bits of techno junk we're given don't, in my mind, make up for glaring omissions and mental insults.<br /><br />In \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\" The Ted and Terry film commentary make the extra $$ for the Extended DVD very much worth it.<br /><br />Not so here.<br /><br />P.S.  Since I wrote this, I have discovered the book series.  If you like to read, and like the movie, please get the books.  They are addicting.  I'm so glad they made the movie; if they had not, I would never have found the books!ing over and over.

B00008CLOA|5.0|I recently built a new audio system (heading towards theater) and had heard wonderful things about DVD-Audio and SACD's.  With all my new components, I decided I would give these new formats a try.  At first, I didn't see what all the hoopla was about.  However, I found a white paper at the Denon site to help tune my two components and OMG did that change things.  This has got to be the best test of a 5.1 system that is available.  Pink Floyd is very effect and sound heavy and they did a great job of spreading the sounds around the different channels.  If you get this and it isn't amazing, it is possible that your system isn't quite tuned right.  Other titles I tested were Emerson Lake and Palmer, Metallica, and Dave Sanborn (sp); all of which did pretty good, but none like this SACD.  This album is a must have for Pink Floyd fans and those who want to get a good idea how their 5.1 surround is doing.
B000002UYZ|5.0|Most people know how great The Beatles are.  Therefore, I should only have to say, &quot;it's The Beatles; need I say more?&quot;.  Since I'm a nice guy, I'll detail it anyway...<br />&quot;1962-1966&quot; is a great compilation two-disc album for any Beatles fan.  This is the set that shows how this musical phenomenon started.  It was released three years after their break-up, a time that society still awaited anxiously for their reunion.  Fans had never seen a greatest hits compilation from them before this.  Still devoted to them, many rushed for this album.  These songs continue to inspire a generation of musicians that have come after them, including The Bangles, Sheryl Crow, Def Leppard, and many more.  Therefore, it was more than just their good looks and their bopping heads that made them a wonderful band.  <br />This set explores John, Paul, George, and Ringo through their first two years of fame in the US.  When the British Invasion began in 1964, a new musical revolution began.  Their long-lasting impact was the least expected.  The Beatles were the first of many British acts (The Rolling Stones, The Kinks, Dusty Springfield, etc.) to conquer the US during this time with their first smash it single &quot;I Want To Hold Your Hand&quot;.  Then, their performance on &quot;The Ed Sullavin Show&quot; that year made music history again.  Over 70 million people watched them perform five songs that night.  All five of those became smash hits.  Their impact, aside the screaming fans, proved that they came to stay.  <br />Before their debut, only doo-wop and rock &amp; roll captured the airways, namely by Elvis Presley.  It seemed like society was looking for something new.  No other act performed in that style of rock before 1964, including the more accented guitar and the absense of a piano/ keyboard.  This gave new meaning to rock music.  Their great vocal harmonies gave an added spice for listening pleasure.  The lyrics gave these love songs the extra catchiness.  Most of these songs were written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney.  They later became one of the greatest songwriting duos.  Through the years, The Beatles's style wonderfully evolved while continuing to make music history.<br />Those wanting to observe more of their evolution should also buy &quot;1967-1970&quot;, which explores lyrics about peace, love, drugs, and anti-war.  &quot;1962-1966&quot; is a great album for any Beatles fan to own as it'll continue pleasing listeners for a long time.
B00005MP58|5.0|I watched this 2 set DVD for the third time yesterday and loved it all over again. The characters are so rich, even the most annoying of them has something to offer, like the irritating Mr.Collins who fits so pertfectly into the theme of how society sought patronage then. <BR>One never gets tired of the Darcy and Miss Lizzy Bennet affair that the movie is based on. Firth and Ehle execute their parts so meticulously that I for one am always left in a quandry for I don't know if it is Firth or Darcy that makes me like the movie so much. Ehle does a wonderful job of playing the witty Ms Bennet. The sets are so well made, you are taken to an age when women did nothing but gossip, make hats and wait to be betrothed. A must read book and and a must see movie.
B0000DYJM6|5.0|I've been a fan of Pearl Jam's since Ten and will probably keep buying what they put out--even though the band's style has changed somewhat.  Lost Dogs is a great double disc set, and what makes it work is that each disc has it's own &quot;feel.&quot;  There seems to be some thought put into arranging the songs (although I think Yellow Ledbetter should have been on the second disc).<br />The first disc is a little louder and more up-tempo.  Best songs are All Night, Alone, Education, You, Leavin' Here, Gremmie Out of Control and Yellow Ledbetter.  Some of these I heard before as B-sides to singles, others I didn't know about.  The second disc is the better of the two and has songs that are a little slower and laid back.  Best ones are Fatal, Other Side, Hard to Imagine, Footsteps, Drifting and Last Kiss.<br />There are some filler songs on the discs and you can hear why some songs didn't make it.  Still, Lost Dogs helped me realize why I liked Pearl Jam so much in the first place and gives the listener a good snapshot of band's work.

But sadly, I am a bit dissapointed with Deliverance. <br />For one thing, Opeth gets a little heavier... not a bad thing, but they had to get a bit on the mediocre side as well. <BR>Agh, Marty (drummer) relies too much on the double bass. <BR>And the riffs, although still with Opeth flare, are closer to<BR>just the plain metal riffs than ever before. And what the heck happened? Did Mikael put the guitar down for this album? Where are all the beautiful harmonizing dual guitars? Also, where is the emotion in this? All of Opeth's previous are pack jammed with emotion and a distinct feel to the music. And even if this band still feels like Opeth, it runs weak. And how about technicality? There is some prententious parts on here... like in Master's Apprentice with the broken chords... bad attempt there.<br />I loved Opeth for their feel and originality. And while this album still has it. It's incredibly deluted. But, if you're an Opeth fan. I'd buy this album for the collection! :)
014028009X|4.0|While the book did not live up to my expectations, it did have me laughing outloud at certain points.  This is quite rare, so this book is a valuable find.<br />Here we have the diary of Bridget Jones, a 30 year old who is still single, not happy with her job or her weight.  She's someone a lot of us can relate to- and that's what makes this book so compelling and likable.  We watch her try to quit smoking, cut down on drinking, try to stop obsessing over a crush and lose weight. But whether she's winning or losing the battle, she keeps on (even with a sense of humor), giving us something to admire her for.<br />I actually enjoyed the movie a bit more than the book.  But if you liked the movie, I think the book is worth reading.  It won't blow you away, but you'll enjoy it.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|This is a great cd, I especially like &quot;follow through&quot; and &quot;I dont wanna be&quot; His voice reminds me of the lead singer of maroon five, his passion remind me of John Mayer and his lyrics remind me of Jason Mraz. SO if you like all these people, great piano and guitar, this cd is definatly for you!

015603008X|5.0|Flowers for Algernon had me welling up by the fiftieth page.  Charlie is one of the kindest people one could ever cross paths with, yet people still took advantage of him and laughed at him because he was retarded.  What was even more sad was that he thought they were all great friends.  It doesn't get better after his operation, because all he does is alienate everyone who he used to know, and he finds out people aren't as kind as he thought. His memories of his childhood are chilling and sad, and I was on the verge of tears throughout the whole book.  When he finds out he's deteriorating, I cried almost as much as Alice.  Algernon's deteriation is also incredibly sad.  I read it in three days because I couldn't stop turning the pages.  The ending isn't the one you want, but it fits perfectly.  I will never forget this stirring diary, and I assure you won't either.
B0000959N0|5.0|Daredevil has always been my favorite comic book hero, but all the bad reviews made fear for the worst. Roger Ebert thought it was good so that had me wondering just how Daredevil the movie would really be. Fearing the worst I rented it. Have no fear!I've been a Daredevil fan for years and I'm very pleased with Daredevil the DVD. A lot of the negative reviews attack things that can be found in the classic Daredevil comics. The movie is silly at times like those great comic books of the past. I actually think that was a good move. The gymnastics are often not realistic, but that's how Daredevil comics were. There's no character named Stick in the movie, but there wasn't any character called Stick in the classic Daredevil comics. Daredevil trained himself. Stick appeared decades later and if they have him appear later in the movies that'll be perfect. Elektra mentions how she recieved her training, but I guess a lot of people missed it from the reviews on here. It's in my copy of the DVD. Daredevil the DVD worked for me!
0743454529|3.0|The story was incredible most of the time, but there were a few parts i mostly skipped over because they read like daytime television.  The relationship between the sisters was good, but i felt that the parents were too 2-D.  i didnt mind the flashbacks, but i felt that the older brother's little drama could have mostly been left out of the story.  Same with the lawyers.  I felt that they should have just filled their roles and allowed the sisters to take the center stage the rest of the time because their drama had, really, nothing to do with the important issues of the story.

B000059XUI|4.0|&quot;Superman II&quot; is more a continuation than a sequel of Richard Donner's 1978 &quot;Superman the Movie.&quot; If you liked the first firlm, there's no real argument: you must see the second.<br />Unfortunately, no discussion of the film is possible without also reviewing its checkered production history. The project was originally conceived as one long story in two films, which Donner shot at the same time, much as Peter Jackson would do twenty-odd years later with the Lord of the Rings films.<br />After &quot;Superman the Movie&quot; was released and proved a critical and commercial success, and &quot;Superman II&quot; was well along toward completion, the producers inexplicably fired Donner and replaced him with Richard Lester, an English director best known for his quirky Beatles comedies. Stranger still, although the then-unheard of sum of $100 million had already been spent on the project, Lester reassembled most of the cast and reshot a large portion of the second film. <br />The end product is an oil-and-water mixture of two styles. Lester's direction is light and deft, but he approached the subject with a jaded irreverence that offends purists. It matters because purism was an important part of the success of the first film.<br />On the plus side, the film finishes the story begun in the first outing. Superman's and Lois Lane's romance runs to its inevitable, heart-wrenching conclusion (&quot;I'm jealous of the whole world!&quot;) as the three Kryptonian super-villians are released from the Phantom Zone to wreak havoc on a defenseless Earth. Gene Hackman's fiendishly charismatic Lex Luthor returns, and in no time has the supposedly more powerful Kryptonians eating out of his hand. Terence Stamp and Sarah Douglas give gripping performances as the renegade Kryptonians Zod and Ursa, and Christopher Reeve again plays Superman and Clark Kent to perfection.<br />Some special effects show evidence of cost cutting, but the climactic final confrontations arestunning, when the villians bust up the Daily Planet and then square off against Superman using Manhattan's Forty-Second Street as their boxing ring. Superman's nick-of-time arrival (&quot;General...would you care to step outside?&quot;) makes you want to stand up and cheer.<br />The film is a must-see for anyone with any interest in the subject, but I take one star off the review for the featureless DVD release. If there was ever a film that demanded the full range of extras, it's this one. How about showing us some of Donner's lost scenes? How about breaking the long silence on the production history? <br />For that matter, how about releasing Richard Donner's version of the film?

B0000029DD|5.0|When I was in my freshman year of college (four years ago), I had a roommate named Quinn who was one of those free spririted type of people.  She would always put on these albums that you'd never even heard of and leave for hours at a time.  The first time I heard &quot;Grace&quot; I fell in love with it immediately.  Every song was so emotionally touching to me, not only because I think that Jeff is a musical genius, but because that was also when I fell in love for the first time.  I will never be able to listen to this album without feeling the exact same way that I felt back then.  I know that when you listen to it, it will be as if your life has paused and in that moment, you will realize that &quot;Grace&quot; will be embedded forever in your memories.  I can't say enough about how amazing this album is, especially &quot;Last Goodbye&quot;.  It is a perfectly written final goodbye for a break-up.  One of my favorite parts is &quot;Kiss me, please kiss me, but kiss me out of desire babe, and not consolation...&quot;  I also highly recommend, &quot;Sketches...&quot;.  The songs &quot;Morning Theft&quot; and &quot;Everybody Here Wants You&quot; will really blow you away.

0739313126|1.0|I found the story engrossing and it kept me awake on the drive from Portland to San Francisco. However, I would advise you not to buy the audio version. I don't know if it was the idea of the director or the narrator, but the the story is narrated in an unconvincing fake French accent (in dialogue). It gets worse when the male narrator continues to narrate the central female character in his best female French accent. The fun doesn't stop as the narrator acts out the female character as a 9 year old girl, and carries on a schizophrenic dialogue between the French woman and her French grandmother. Ridiculous!!
B0001AP12G|4.0|While Jay-Z was force-feeding Memphis Bleek, Beanie Sigel, Young Gunz and Freeway upon us as the future of Roc-a-fella Records, he should have been paying attention to producer Kanye West. This album shows West producing every track and having a variety of topics to speak on such as religion ('Jesus Walks'), materialism ('All Falls Down'), and his car accident ('Through the Wire'). But for everyone who says that this album is different from all of the guns, ice and women talk that other rappers do, listen to 'Breathe In, Breathe Out', where he DOES talk about those things. There are a few flaws on this album (inspired lyricism but subpar flow; too many silly skits) and I would have loved to see 'Breathe In, Breathe Out' and 'The New Workout Plan' replaced with 'Home' and 'The Good, The Bad, The Ugly', two songs that didn't make the album. Also, why does Kanye keep taking full credit for other people's work? On 'Two Words', he says, &quot;Blueprint, 5 mics&quot;, when in fact Kanye only produced a few tracks off that Jay-Z album. You don't hear DJ Premier walking around saying, &quot;Illmatic, 5 mics&quot;. Other than that, great album.
B0000BYM3K|3.0|This is the worst Maiden album since, well, Virtual 11. I just feel that Maiden is running out of steam, borrowing earlier motifs, riffs and melodies. A band like Ac/Dc may be able to get away with it, but the mighty Maiden?<br />The album starts out lackluster, with the Wickerman \\"style\\" single \\"Wildest Dreams\\". Its not a bad song, but seems like a mix of \\"Hooks in You\\" and the Wickerman that is too close for comfort. The solo by Adrian Smith is what saves it from total mediocrity. The album gets better on the Murray penned \\"Rainmaker\\" which features riffs that sound very Eurometal inspired, as well as some tasty guitar work from Murray himself as well. \\"No More Lies\\" is in the tradition of \\"Angel and the Gambler\\" and \\"Dream of Mirrors\\", that is a song that repeats the chorus over and over ad naseaum (and like those other two, the song is in the key of A). This songs saving grace is some great dual guitar harmonies, which do bring this up a notch. Then is the mystical \\"Montesegeur\\", which is the song which recalls Bruce Dickinson's solo work the most, but also \\"Black Rose\\" era Thin Lizzy. The title track also recalls Thin Lizzy in a way, but also epics of Maiden albums past like \\"Sign of The Cross\\". Now the album really has a large downward slide into mediocrity, boredom, and very plodding \\"xfactor\\" type riffs, with repetitive choruses (and of course most of these songs are in E minor)! THis is where the Irons should have realized the difference between \\"filler\\" and \\"great music\\" and should have filled it with better songs. The production stinks compared to Brave New World as well, I am very dissapointed with this one, though it is still Iron Maiden, the band that made me pick up a guitar. Its still a good album, and I like to listen to it, but the problem is that it isnt up to par.<br /><br />Update 3/3/2005:<br /><br />In retrospect, I still gave it three stars because there are some EXCELLENT songs on here like the title track, Montesgur, and Rainmaker. The main problem though is filler, the last half really drags down.<br />I also like Wildest Dreams more than I thought at the time.filler, the last half really drags down.

B0001UL7RY|1.0|My Uncle Curtis gave me some cash for my birthday and a ride to the mall so that I could buy a CD. He said &quot;get something I can listen to.&quot; But the only thing we ever listen to in his car are cassettes of Jefferson Airplane, the Rascals, Bob Dylan, Nazz and the Electric Prunes! I said &quot;Uncle Curtis you have to get up with the times.&quot; But you see he gets depressed. He says: I just don't understand all this new music. I said: listen to Smash Mouth! He says: No! and cranks up his Guess Who tape. And if I have to listen Funkadelic one more time I will trip! So we went to the mall and he wanted me to buy Badfinger's greatest hits! As if! Then my Uncle Curtis wanted me to buy him a new blue bath robe to replace his old frayed one... with the money he just gave ME!! On the weekends me and my sister stay with him and he cooks us breakfast at 11 o'clock in the morning. He has a sheet of tin foil covering his kitchen window. Last weekend he was blasting some CD by Lee Michaels. I was like: Dude you HAVE to listen to something modern. So with my b-day money I bought him some Avril to listen to. He hates it. He went out in the garage and smoked cigarrettes for an hour while we played it inside. It was raining the whole morning and he read the funnies out in the garage. He never got out of his bathrobe the whole day! <br />Finally he came inside and he listened to the CD and looked at the CD booklet. He just kept making all these comments when we were listening. He said: this ain't original, this is garbage!<br />1. Take Me Away  <br />My uncle Curtis was like, &quot;hmm, she just got this from the ending of &quot;Let's Go Crazy&quot; by Prince when he yells &quot;take me away!&quot;<BR> <BR>2. Together  <br />My uncle Curtis was like &quot;You know, Country Joe and the Fish made a whole album called Together.&quot; <br />3. Don't Tell Me  <br />Uncle Curtis was like, &quot;Dude, you wanna hear a good song, play &quot;Girl Don't Tell Me&quot; by the Beach Boys. Sure, Curtis, sure.<br />4. He Wasn't  <br />Then he's like &quot;Or listen to &quot;I just wasn't made for these times&quot; by the Beach Boys. He's like, the bass guitar on that song makes me weep like a child!<BR> <BR>5. How Does It Feel  <br />Uncle Curist was like, &quot;Man, does she just rip off Bob Dylan or what? While this song was playing he just starts screaming the lyrics to &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot; right over Avril. <br />6. My Happy Ending   <br />&quot;Happy Ending&quot; by Joe Jackson is 100% times better according to Curtis. <BR>     <BR>7. Nobody's Home     <br />Forgot what he said. <BR>   <BR>8. Forgotten      <br />Forgot what he said. <BR>  <BR>9. Who Knows     <br />Who's Next! That my favorite tape of Uncle Curtis because they do that Limp Bizcit song. I mean, you know, its originally on this album. My uncle curtis heard Limp doing &quot;Behind Blue Eyes&quot; and he freaked. That was the night he hit his head on that lamp that he has coming down from the ceiling that is way too low. Man, he was in agony and we had to put ice cubes in a paper towel for him. But he was so ticked that &quot;someone would make such a mess of such a good song.&quot;  <BR>   <BR>10. Fall to Pieces    <br />Can't remember. <BR>    <BR>11. Freak Out   <br />You should have seen him. He dropped the cigarrette that was dagling from his lips and he jumps out of his seat and screams &quot;rip off, rip off, she got this from Frank Zappa, rip off rip off!!&quot; His dog started barking and howling and he's just yelling &quot;rip off&quot; and then he shows me this old record he has and it says &quot;Freak Out&quot; on it. <BR>     <BR>12. Slipped Away  <br />Oh well.
B000002UAO|5.0|I really don't care what people say, Rubber Soul is a great album! Sure, it's a transition from the crowd-pleasing pop-ish songs to their more mature, complicated songs but the transition has it's own great points that CANNOT be overlooked. Rubber Soul is great because of the experimentation. This was all new stuff, a breakthrough in the music world. Several songs on the album are among the most favorite of all time. They aren't so simplistic as the earlier stuff, you can hear a change in all of their voices and in their way of thinking.<br />Drive My Car: First track, not bad, George's guitar is a great start and the song has a sexy undertone.<br />Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown): Great sitar, excellent use of it. I love the lyrics. I mean, really, there is something very lovable about the transition songs because they still had some fun in them and weren't so heavy yet. This song has a great flow that makes anyone want to listen to it many times in a row.<br />You Won't See Me: Along with \\"She's a Woman\\" this is probably one of my least favorite Beatles songs. One can really hear Paul's pop influence on this song. It's ok but it gets old really fast.<br />Nowhere Man: ABSOLUTE CLASSIC!!! Here is where you can hear the expression of John's inner feelings, Rubber Soul is really where the Beatles began to get into self-exploration and the result is FANTASTIC! Most every song on this album is peak perfection in it's own right.<br />Think for Yourself: Good, George is really starting to establish himself here, that's another landmark for Rubber Soul.<br />The Word: Definitely following with the mid-sixties vibe. All about spreading love and showing what a good thing love is. This is almost a protest song against all the uptight people in the world. John is telling you to keep love alive everywhere, The Word could be a lead-in to All You Need is Love.<br />Michelle: I've read in here that some people dislike Michelle. WHY??? This is yet another area where the Beatles were able to branch out in the types of songs they were doing. The French words are great, it's a lovely ballad to a girl who can't understand him but he desperately wants to show her how much he cares.<br />What Goes On: Personally, I really don't like this. 60's country is just not my thing, it's sort of an out-dated song for the Beatles to have been doing.<br />Girl: Ah, the pain of a cold woman, John portrays it so clearly. Again, these songs are just so different from what they had been doing before! I personally love them, they have great melody and a variety of new sounds, they all tell a story. That's what's important right? If so, Rubber Soul meets all the requirements.<br />I'm Looking Through You: Another distant woman. Great melody again, great portrayal of everything Paul is feeling. So different from previous songs!<br />IN MY LIFE: This is the big song on the album for me. Personally my ALL TIME FAVORITE!!! I first heard it at the beginning of The Beatles Anthology and have loved it ever since. It's so sweet and wistful and just full of meaning. In My Life is John's story about his life in Liverpool and Hamburg. Basically a tribute to all the wonderful people, places and things that he had known. Stuart, his Mom, old hangouts, etc. It's a song that can have meaning for everyone and shows so much depth is such simple wording. Not to say the song is simple, just that the words didn't have to be complicated to show all of that emotional depth. It's a song that makes you cry happy and sad tears, makes you long for a part of your life lived before, makes your heart leap. It's very nostalgic. And, John has such sweet, soothing vocals in it. I've also heard that In My Life was voted by a group of songwriters as the best song ever written. I MUST agree.<br />Wait: Very unselfish, honest, good melody.<br />If I Needed Someone: I can't say it's the best George-in-the-Beatles song (that might fall to a song like Something) but it's very good. Love the melody,great words, good emotion.<br />Run for Your Life: John's jealous streak, he admits to it here and in his later song Jealous Guy. I suppose a fear of rejection and the reprocussions. It's a really good song though, I love the guitar and the melody. Even in a song like this, John's voice is still soothing to me.<br />All in all, Rubber Soul is just so full of variety and new experiments. It jumps from Blues to Pop to Rock to Ballads and on and on, it was a great beginning to their later stuff. But, it really shouldn't be considered a prototype, it's not like it's a rough album that could have been fixed up. It is smooth, flowing, has a great variety. It's very finished and every song sounds like it was meant to sound just like it does. The later Beatles cannot be judged as better or improved from Rubber Soul, just different and in a different era of their musical careers. Don't overlook Rubber Soul, it's really studded in jewels!!!on.<BR>Run for Your Life: John's jealous streak, he admits to it here and in his later song Jealous Guy.

0061015725|2.0|(a few spoilers  here) This book is not a true exploration of Nano-technology and it's possibilities.  It is a science-fiction mind-number in which the villian (the ferocious little nano-bots) have no limits.  One second they are starting to recognize shapes, the next they eat a few memory-chips and start controlling human minds.  Is this believable?<br />And as if this lame plot were not enough, the story is chalk-full of flat characters acting entirely obvious.  The prose is weak, the dialog is worse.  I officially give up on Crichton, Airframe was bad, Timeline was dreadful, and Prey was nearly unreadable.  <br />So my advice in a nutshell:  if you loved Jurassic Park, you will STILL hate this.

B000002MUW|5.0|It was not until I bought Bedtime Stories a few weeks ago that I realized that this is Madonna's most consistent and pleasing album ever.  This might be because I am a rabid fan of r&amp;b music, and to date, this is Madonna's most r&amp;b album ever.  The album is entirely pleasing because Madonna employed hitmakers like Babyface and Dallas Austin, both of which are r&amp;b producing megaforces.  The latter two succeed in giving Madonna warm, sensuous grooves. Madonna's vocals shimmer on tracks like Survival, with it's new jill swing influences and lush harmonies, and Secret with hits pulsing beats and Madonna's shimmering vocals.<br />Madonna turns the ballad 'Love Tried to Welcome Me' into a confessional poem of sorts when she declares: 'Love tried to welcome me/But my soul drew back/ Covered with dust and sin...'    Every track is a winner on Bedtime Stories.  Human Nature, with its hard driving beats and Madonna's biting lyrics, add another dimension to an already superb album.  <br />Madonna closes this excellent album with 'Take a Bow,' a haunting and tender ballad fleshed with bittersweet lyrics.  This indeed is among Madonna's best work ever.  A must have for even casual listeners.

B00028HBKM|5.0|After seeing this movie , I must say that as a christian I beleive that it is more closer to the sciptures of the Bible , then any I have seen of all movies made about christ.  Yes, it was and is the passion(suffering)of christ for all mankind, but yet the plan of God. The first man(Adam) sinned, and fell from his place that \\"GOD\\", had given him, \\"dominion over all other creations of \\"God\\", .  Jesus is the word of God. A plan was formed by God after the fall of man from his place, and God's grace to redem man. Jesus became that redemer, that sacificial lamb of perfection so that man can once again be in the grace of God again.  The jewish prophets of the bible prophecied about him Isiah 54. It has served a propose that God only knows.  No man does anything with the father knowing. Does it promote antisemtis? no. we are all guilty of the blood of christ every time we give into sin that against \\"God\\",every person , no matter what color, regilion, or race .It is a movie worth seeing , order this dvd, and watch it with a open mind and heart.

The music has enthralled me to the point, that I purchased the book and am going to New York in Septmeber to see the play. <br />Idina Menzel is fabulous. Defying Gravity should be everyone's theme song. Especially in these times. Kristin Chenoweth is also very good. But I found Idina's voice much more stronger. <br />Buy this cd it won't disappoint anyone.

Her music instills no fear or hate.  She offers the most that any artist can...  Her enchanting music and serene image are the things dreams are made of.

B00008S2VG|5.0|now that I've got your attention; I can't believe I didn't buy this album when it first came out last year.  Over the past week, I've had the tremendous fortune to see Madonna perform not once, but twice at Madison Square Garden in New York. She is absolutely, undeniably phenomenal in every single way.  The kind of perfection and attention to detail, the well roundedness of her performance and song selections--she is a creative genius....and I think American Life absolutely 100% speaks to that genius.  <br />I'd never heard any of the songs on the album before the tour; After the concert there were several songs, which I'd only heard for the first time that I simply couldn't get out of my head the next day--I asked my sister, whom I went to the first concert with, why I'd never heard the song, or any of the other songs I hadn't recognized and she said it was because I succumbed to the views of the critics (many of whom I think last year were afraid of alienating conservatives, and getting Dixie Chicked) and despite my inclination, declined to the purchase the album.  <br />I've come around and am extraordinarily happy.<br />Madonna remains the consummate entertainer.  Either you like her or you don't--if you do, it is hard to believe that anyone would take issue with this album.<br />For what it's worth, MSG is in fact sold out; don't believe everything you read, especially in Rupert Murdoch's very conservative New York Post.

B0001ZXM54|4.0|Well if the \\"Best Of\\" and \\"Greatest Hits\\" weren't enough for you, here's the 2-disc \\"Very Best Of\\". 38 tracks including most everything you could want from these three Texans. Sure there's a few missing still, but this does include \\"La Grange\\", \\"Tush\\", \\"Gimme All Your Lovin'\\", and \\"Legs\\". As far as I can tell, all the big hits are present, making the casual fan happy, if not the fanatic. Actually I think this is a bit much for alot of people, and some others probably have most of this anyway. So, I guess you just have to decide what you want, the hits, or the best? Of course I'd take either one over a \\"Pearl Necklace\\".
0440224764|3.0|This is basically a plot idea which is the reverse of the ending of the firm. If the firm ends with the identity vanishing of special witnesses, new life, new identity, past replaced by new unborn future, this one is abt a guy's story who comes back to life to want a normal lifestyle after he killed himself off by faking his own death and watching his own funeral. This guy was a partner in a firm, hence the title. Its the undressing of the story as to technical aspects of how he disappeared in the first place which is the pulp of the story, for eg, whose body was actually cremated, how he planned it and how he is going to try to escape all charges and come back into public life when the FBI is sure to hang him in court as the case is so strong against. This novel is like a burger and like all Grisham novels is real fast but not as memorable as &quot;firm&quot; or &quot;king of torts&quot;. I forgot abt the book after I finished it. As always Grisham has to always tell the story of a guy who has his best intentions at heart. Why dont we get an anti hero...infact in king of torts we get an anti hero of sorts. And grisham has just put too many subplots to make it look complicated. The suits and countersuits. A is suing B,C and D while B is suing A and D and Z is suing all of them. And the book tries to make the protogonist too neat, as if he planned all along to come back to public life the way he did with a few exceptions and all ends well. Grisham was getting boring but king of torts shows he is willing to experiment as KOTis not your usual grisham. Grisham needs to move to new territory, try variation instead of rehashing the same stuff with seemingly complex plot structures. All said and done, the book is not bad, but it is a typical grisham novel...but then we all want typical grisham novels, dont we ?...cause they are bestsellers. So go read it anyway if you are are not a Grisham fan and if you are a Grisham fan, you have already read it. Do I make any sense...?
B000002HJA|4.0|I know some of their other albums are thought of as better, and I really like &quot;Blues For The Red Sun&quot;, but this disc is totally sweet. Whatever you want to call it, punk-grunge-stoner rock, this is one of the best of the genre. It's so simple, yet the distortion, riffs, and sometimes grinding pace are just what I love about it. It's almost like primal metal. The tracks &quot;One Inch Man&quot;, &quot;Jumbo Blimp Jumbo&quot;, and &quot;Size Queen&quot; are all great, and it's almost impossible not to break out the air-guitar to each one of them. Then &quot;Catamaran&quot; is cool and hypnotic, and the epic &quot;Spaceship Landing&quot; is the best of everything. If you dig stuff like &quot;Monster Magnet&quot;, &quot;The Atomic Bitchwax&quot;, or early &quot;Soundgarden&quot;, this is a must.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I was first indroduced to the &quot;Wicked&quot; saga through the book. I found it to be enterntaining and engrosing. When I learned of the fact that there was a popular musical playing on Booadway, the first thing that I did was rush to my computer and read the reviews. It was at the official websitt that I discovered the CD and researched it to find clips of the songs. I fell in love with it the first moment that I heard it. It has changed my life in so many ways! The magical storyline that it produces carries the listener to a far off place and transforms that world that we all thought was OZ. This musical will be seen in history as the one that changed it all. We grew up thinking that the Wicked Witch of the West was a woman to be feared, when in actuality, the musical leads us to believe that she was a person who loved and lost, and just needed to be loved again. To those entertaining thoughts of buying this album, please don't hesitate. The music is so fresh and compelling. This talented teram of musicians is truely and inspiration to all.
1592400876|5.0|You may be shocked to read these words describing a book on punctuation.  I would be.  I can assure you, I am not exaggerating.  Lynne Truss has an incisive sense of humor that drives home her point on this subject better than any other book I have read.  That said, there is an important underlying theme to this book - we are losing our language.  Amongst the barrage of non-punctuated e-mails, text messages, blogs, etc. we are quickly becoming a people approaching functional illiteracy.  Thank you Lynne for trying to stem this tide in your uniquely humorous fashion.

B0001611DI|3.0|I love George A. Romero's Night of the Living Dead. It wasn't scary in today's standard but I respect that he had made a standard for the movie during late 1960s. Now with the sequel to it, Dawn of the Dead: Special Edition from Anchor Bay has finally arrived. With tv spots, movie trailers and a few more others included.<br />BUT WAIT!<br />After I bought this a few months back, I have conceived a fact that I regret buying this edition - DAWN OF THE DEAD: THE ULTIMATE EDITION is releasing in September!<br />And it's a director's cut, with lots of special features that is almost 11 hours! Plus a booklet to this limited edition.<br />Now, although I have the special edition, I have to sell it in order to buy the upcoming edition, which has more additions to the movie. So beware!
1592400876|1.0|In &quot;Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves,&quot; Lynne Truss does what a writer of a book on &quot;correct&quot; usage should never do--she commits the very errors she rails against. A book like this should always be copyedited and proofread to the highest degree, and here the publishers have failed. As the &quot;New Yorker&quot; says, &quot;About half the semicolons in the...book are either unnecessary or ungrammatical, and the comma is deployed as the mood strikes.&quot; Beyond this, incorrect statements of fact are made. To top it off, a new edition wasn't prepared for the American market, which seems completely bizarre to me given the many differences between American and British styles of punctuation.<br />People who are genuinely interested in English usage can do so much better than this book. It is a shame that it has done so well when greater works have remained relatively unknown.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I LOVE AVRILS SECOND ALBUM ITS BETTER THAN THE FIRST.THE BEST TRACKS ARE:TAKE ME AWAY,HE WASNT,HOW DOES IT FEEL,MY HAPPY ENDING,NOBODYS HOME,TOGETHER&amp;DONT TELL ME  THOSE ARE MY PERSONAL FAVS.  I RECOMMEND IT 2 EVERYBODY AVRIL FANS WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.
0765310015|3.0|I can't, for the life of me, understand why anyone would give this book 4 or 5 stars.    <br />It's just not that good.  It's original, I'll give it that, and it could be great, but let's face facts here people -- it's both too shallow and too deep at the same time.  I'd give it 2.5 stars if I could.  I'll chalk the extra one half up to originality.<br />The characters are barely developed, and while they are interesting in a paper-thin way, they just never really got me to care at all what happened to them.  The same really goes for the story.  It's got some good parts but never really hooked me.  Maybe it's because it jumps around way to much and too quickly and Erikson never give you enough background to really get into it.<br />The detail in his writing is wasted on inconsequential passages.  I mean he's got non-human characters that he never explains how they differ from humans.  Why bother??  This kind of stuff is all over this book and makes it really hard to grasp.  It's almost like he expects you to be familiar with his world already.<br />Bottom line:  It's different and in that way has a tad bit of charm, but it's too hard to get into for numerous reasons.  With the help of a really good editor and a thorough re-write it could have been a damn good book.

0804106304|5.0|I read this book in my sophomore year of high school when I was sixteen. I was truly amazed by the great word usage that Amy Tan was able to achieve. Being an asian-american myself, I found it very easy to relate to the four Chinese mothers and the four american daughters. But I do believe that regardless of race, color, or creed, anyone can enjoy this book and be able to appreciate the stylized story telling. <br />Another thing I love about this book is its format. There are four different lessons that are subdivided into four stories that are all narrated by either the American daughters or the Chinese Mothers. (If you look at the book, it's make more sense than I'm making right now.)<br />One of the main themes in the book is communication between generations. All the mothers really want for their daughters is for them not to lose &quot;face&quot; and remember where they came from. And all the daughters want is for their mothers to accept them for who they really are. This book shows how great a mother's wisdom can be even when a daughter doesn't want to hear it.<br />This is my favorite book of all time and I advise everyone to read it regardless of age. It's a classic and a good one for a reason. I'll end this with my favortie quotes from The Joy Luck Club: A girl is like a young tree, you must stand tall and listen to your mother standing next to you. That is the only way to grow strong and straight. But if you bend to listen to other people, you will grow crooked and weak. You will fall to the ground with the first strong wind. And then you will be like a weed, growing wild in any direction running along the ground until someone pulls you out and throws you away.&quot;
B0001L3LUE|1.0|Well, it was only a matter of time when the history of WWII is re-written. This film manages to make the United States he bad guy in WWII for bombing Japan. I guess it will be forgotten that Japan attacked the U.S. first and Japan even after being beaten so badly refused to surrender until it was shown that they could be really be wiped fom the face of the earth. But according to this film the U.S. is the bad guy in WWII. Also, it is fascinating that Mr. McNamara is able to remember the end of WWI when he was 2 years old but he was not able to remember if he authorized agent orange spraying in Vitenam. Selective memory sure is convinient. Finanlly, I would like to congratulate Mr. McNamara for the fact that less than half of American soldiers died in Vietnam under his watch. For the record, approximately 58,000 American soldiers died in Vietnam. McNamara stated approximately 27,000 soldiers died under his watch. Technically it is less than half, but not by much. But really good point to emphasize Mr. McNamara.
B00005JKNF|3.0|No matter how many actors, including bankable stars, appear in a Robert Altman movie, it seems to be about Altman. He has an individual, if by now familiar, style of filmmaking that is always calling attention to itself. That style includes very fluid camera movement, quick-cut editing, and a good deal of dialogue that is covered by other dialogue or sounds distant. We are meant to be awed by the spontaneity and naturalism of it all. <br />Apparently many people are impressed by this mannerism and consider it a sign of artistry. On the whole, I find it pretentious and irritating. In one of the supplementary features on the DVD, Altman, his screenwriter and a handful of the actors from Gosford Park are interviewed in front of a studio audience. Altman and the writer rattle on about how every scene is shot by two cameras that are always in motion, so that the actors are never sure whether they are going to be foreground or atmosphere, or what angle they'll be seen from. Does Altman really think he invented the idea of shooting a scene from multiple angles, and choosing one during editing? And why is a camera that's gliding and panning constantly somehow more &quot;truthful&quot; than one that's framing the character or group that the director believes is most essential to telling the story at that moment?<br />It can be said in Altman's favor, though, that he never makes a merely conventional or routine film; they are all a bit eccentric (a compliment in my book) and, despite my reservations about the camera and sound-recording style, usually offer a fresh view of the theme or its environment. Gosford Park is your standard Agatha Christie-style murder mystery set among a dinner-jacketed, evening-gowned crowd in an English manor house in 1932 -- except, in this case, the doings of the upper crust are set against the army of servants below stairs who work their tails off to make everything straight, gleaming and smooth for their social betters.<br />Altman and his screenwriter Julian Fellows do a very creditable and humane job of conveying the personalities and individuality of the servants; they aren't just symbols of The Oppressed. The characters of the gentry, though, while ably portrayed (the acting talent makes sure of that), are almost universally so sour, rude and calculating that it's hard not to feel that there's a touch of old-fashioned, left-wing agit-prop involved. (The one exception is Jeremy Northam, who plays Ivor Novello -- a real singer and film star of the period -- with considerable charm.) I can believe that an assembly of English bluebloods in that era might have carried within themselves much wickedness, but they would have been far too polished to display it as openly and crudely as they do in Gosford Park.<br />Altman recruited a clutch of A-list British stage and film actors, and they don't fail him. Altman's casual attitude toward the basics of craftsmanship (as opposed to displaying his self-assumed creative genius) ensures that you will be lucky to figure out who half the characters are and their relationships with one another by the time of the denouement, but their cultivated swinishness holds the attention anyway. I think actors love playing obnoxious and unlikeable characters; these seem to be enjoying their roles, and you will, too. <br />The English have a term, &quot;curate's egg.&quot; The meaning is, &quot;parts of it are very good.&quot;
0671027387|3.0|This is the third book I read from Brown.  I totally recommend Angels and Demons, The Da Vinci Code is good, too.  However, after two books, no matter how much research Dan Brown has done, the twists and turns seem very familiar.  It's definitely another page turner, yet when you read the last couple of chapters, you could kinda guess who was the real villain.  However, if you're addicted to suspense, like to read about scientific discoveries and NASA, this is still a good book.
B000000OSG|5.0|this cd is great. it is the 2nd best GN'R cd below appetite. this cd includes great songs like civil war, 14 years, yesterdays,knockin on heavens door, you could be mine, and estranged.if u like nice soft rock this cd is for you even though there are some rough songs but if u want the best rock get appetite for destruction.
B000007S5B|5.0|The depth and insight of this music on these tracks are unprecedented. Robby Krieger's distinct sound that he has established as his own on the guitar in these songs, is like no others. When he plays his rhytmn/lead parts you can tell he is one of the greats. No wonder that in 1993 &quot;The Doors&quot; were inducted into the &quot;Rock N Roll Hall of Fame&quot;!! <BR>His phrasing and finesse'that he releases here is from the soul and heart. For him to continually come up with something new and fresh is nothing short of genius!  And for the band as a whole to create this masterpiece that is still flying off the shelves at your local record stores after more than 30 years speaks loud and clear to the critics of the past and present.
B000000OSE|5.0|this cd is so good. it is the 3rd best GN'R cd besides appetite and USE YOUR ILLUSION II. this cd includes great songs like dont cry, november rain, and the garden. if you are interested in guns n' roses and want softer songs buy this cd with USE YOUR ILLUSION I but if u like hard rock and roll buy appetite.
B00005JMJG|5.0|So far this movie stands as one of my favorite movies of the year. In it, Jim Carrey gives the best performance yet of his career. Rather than play his typical dimwitted (but entertaining) stereotypes, Carrey manages to pull off a character that is not only much more serious but also emotional. Kate Winslet is not wasted as well; her character is both sexy and mysterious while the story of her and Carreys developing relationship unfolds. The supporting cast is also executed in likeable fashion, with so much star-power thats in this movie, it's great to see actors such as Elijah Wood, and Kirstin Dunst play small but intricate roles that do not overshadow the main characters. All in all this was a beautiful love story, and although as I guy I rarely fall for such dribble, this movie was really different, and has changed my once firm opinion on all love stories.
B000000OQY|4.0|this cd is the 4th best GN'R cd...out of five...the only one that is worse then this is the spaggatie incident. this cd has 2 great songs: patience and mama kin(originally recorded by Aerosmith) but even though this cd defitally falls short of appetite it is still good.
B00024BHTC|5.0|There's probably only one rock band in the world I can compare Nightwish to these days - and that's Rush... Enough said. Yes; they're that good. With &quot;Once&quot; Nightwish have expanded their music beyond metal. I don't know what to call it - sometimes it rocks you like thunder, sometimes it can make you weep. &quot;Once&quot; is, I think, Nightwish's best album this far, and at the same time one of the best albums I have ever heard. A rock classic to be. Yet, it isn't something to reveal its full power immediately. <br />The range of musical styles and atmospheres is nothing short of amazing, very likely even disturbing to some. Don't let the first impressions fool you, though. This isn't fast-food music. Even some songs that may make you go &quot;What..?&quot; are a part of this story, and eventually fit in perfectly. Better believe it: a metal band doesn't need to do &quot;metal&quot; all the time to chill your blood... The most magical moments on this album may well be the ones most metal groups would never even consider doing.<br />I have heard some people complaining (after 1st listening) that &quot;Once&quot; is over-romantic, over-operatic, over-pompous, even ridiculous in its &quot;everything bigger than life&quot; way. In a way, I understand them, but still strongly disagree. It's true that this album is like &quot;Lord of The Rings&quot; of rock - but just like Tolkien's masterpiece isn't everyone's cup of tea, &quot;Once&quot; isn't music for cynics. It's not something to make you feel miserable, or your &quot;ordinary metal&quot;. It's, should I say, more than metal. It's Music. Music with Power and Beauty. And Spirit.<br />And this is also the connection to Rush... Although their music is different, they share the same power, beauty and spirit. Third band to mention here could be Karnataka...<br />Anyway, if your idea of great rock is something that moves more in you than just your feet or neck, I dare to say it probably doesn't get much better than this... Do the Spinal Tap thing: crank your amps to eleven, turn on the subwoofers, ignore the neighbours, ignore the policemen banging your door, just enter the world of &quot;Once&quot; - and when you wake again, your world has probably changed a little...<br />Not bad. Not bad at all...
B000000P17|3.0|i have to say this is the worst cd guns n' roses has produced but unlike other bands their worst it not that bad. aint it fun is a great song and i enjoy listening to it but besides that this cd isnt very special. but even though most of the songs sucked i always enjoy hearing axls crackily voice.
B0001ADAVK|4.0|I love this film. As one who attended a college much like Wellesley at about the same time as the story, had a professor much like Kate Watson, and had a family much like Betty's, I can tell you that's the way it was. My professor, too, urged me to go to graduate school, but I made Joan's choice. Nearly all of us did. To go to grad school was to give up all hope of marriage, which we were assured was our destiny. The purported purpose of our splendid education was to enable us to be helpful to our husbands and raise intelligent children.<br />I loved the authentic touches -- all the little hats and the clip earrings, one of which had to be removed when you talked on the phone. And the baggy jeans, because they didn't make jeans for women then -- you had to buy men's jeans, which had to be cinched in with a belt if they were to be big enough to fit over the hips. Betty's wedding surprised me, though. Aside from the crinolines under the bridesmaid's skirts, it seemed more sixtyish to me. <br />I'm no fan of Julia Roberts, but I think she did Kate very well indeed. The rest of the cast is excellent. To appreciate this film, try to put aside your 21st-century perceptions. This is the way it was. The film still has a lot to say to us today and it's entertaining too. Good job, Mike Newll!
B0000TLA9G|5.0|this cd is awesome but they dont have all of the songs i would've liked them too but that is ok because the songs they have are awesome and it would be stuiped to make 2 discs because they dont have enough hits to do that. the songs i wish were on here were its so easy, dont cry(alternate lyrics), mr.Brownstone,My Michelle,Night train, estranged, and the garden. but this is a great hit and i think anyone should buy this cd if they liked Aerosmith,Metallica,AC/DC, and Motley Cru.
B0002234LS|4.0|I admit it. I originally saw this movie because Johnny Depp was in it.  As usual, his acting was inspired. Unfortunately, his character was great, but the plot was a little thin.  There have been too many movies with the same twist in the story.  About half way through, I had guessed the ending and the only thing left to carry my interest was Johnny's superb acting. <BR>This is probably the only Stephen King story where you are left feeling sorry for the \\"bad guy\\".
B00002MZ2C|5.0|Along while nu-metal was established , the band &quot; rage against The Machine &quot; had been there before nu - metal was formed .<BR>as for rage against the machine they did not need to use any turntables , electric pianos and etc . They had sticked to their orginal sound . <br />Battle of Los Angeles is their best album yet . i had bought this record in the summer of 2003 . the first track of the record was another amazement by rage . things dont change for them  . Guerilla Radio had included inspiring lyrics . the last verses in the song had stated for the innocent &quot; Mumia Abu Jamal &quot; . Rage Against The Machine had brought back the genre that was needed for what this music industry had craved for . <BR>The guitar riffs for this record were absoulutly amazing .<br />I have been listening to Rage Against The Machine for a long time and have had bought all of their records that they had released . all for a fact that Mr.Rocha with his lyrics and Morello's capability were amazing . <br />If you are a casual fan and dont have thier greatest hits . this like thier best album to their self titled album .
B00008OWZC|5.0|A live album should not be a haphazzard greatest hits collection with some crowd noise and witty \\"stage raps.\\"  It should be a historical document.  A slice out of time that illustrates a band's musical and mental state at a certain point in their history.  Too many live albums suffer from the band's refusal to put out an actual show.  Deep Purple's woefully short Made in Japan--while excelent--plays up the bands jamming over their songs. It's bloated and often lacking in charm.  Guns N Roses' Live Era is the opposite end of the spectrum.  It capitalizes on the songs--but sometimes the wrong ones.  It tries to arrange the songs as they would have appeared during the mid to late 1992 leg of the Use Your Illusion tour, but being recorded \\"all across the universe from 1987 to 1993\\" does't help much in the continuity deprartment.  Althoug it tries to get in all the songs, you need more than two discs to do so (see their final night at the LA Forum from 1991 where they play EVERYTHING).  <BR>How the West Was Won is not a full show in the stictest sense--it takes the best moments of Zeppelin's Long Beach Arena and LA Forum shows from the summer tour on 1972--arguably the best time to have seen the band--and crafts a single performance.  There's areal sense of continuity here and energy by the truckload.  Although it's missing classics like The Song Remains the Same, Kashmir and Achilles Last Stand fans should not be dissappointed.  A show where these songs would have been performed would most likely have come from the 1977 US tour where Plant's voice was harsh and strained and Page was too stoned to play coherently.  This album succeeds so briliantly because it sums up in three hours the zeppelin live experience at the crucial turning point where the band's live show steered away from the free form improvisation we see here to shows more oriented towards individual solos and individual songs.  <BR>Furthermore, the performances are just amazing.  Although John Paul Jones'sorgan had not yet taken center stage at this point in the band's career (it would have to wait until the 1973 US tour for No Quarter) the meastro bassist and arranger can be felt here holding it all together.  John Bonham's drums ring like a barrage of gunfire--their earth-shattering power makes them easily the most impressive element of the mix.  Robert Plant's voice rings true and clear--he hits all the high notes (see later performances of Over the Hills and Far Away); he is indeed the norse god of rock and roll.  Finally, Jimmy Page, the original speed-fingered metal virtuoso is in fine form here.  Indeed, his playing is so smooth and energetic it is mind boggling to wonder how it got so sloppy and stunted during Led Zeppelin's latter days.  HTWWW has two shortcomings.  Guitar tone is the first.  If you listen to bootlegs from this era Jimmy's guitar is raunchy, crunchy, full of sustain--in all, very \\"square\\" and filled with Marshall metal ballsiness.  For some reason it has lost some of that here.  It is compressed and very \\"round\\"-sounding.  The final shortcoming is the lack of a sufficiant encore.  HTWWW only supplies Rock and Roll, The Ocean and Bring it on Home.  Anyone who has some familiarity with the bootleg version of the LA Forum show from which parts of this album were culled knows that Thank You and Communication Breakdown were also played.  A small fan's gripe--it would have been nice to see them here.  <BR>It's miniscule shortcomings notwithstanding, How the West Was Won is a landmark because it simply rocks--it prevents the greatest live band of all time in their greatest era and doesn't attempting to distort or dilute their musical message.
B0001VTPWM|5.0|I was skeptical about this when I first saw it at the store, as I already owned the fantastic Criterion edition DVD.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that the new MGM unrated version found in the Trilogy boxed set is well worth it.  So here is a review for people who already own the Criterion disc and are wondering if they should shell out their hard earned cash for this newer DVD.<br />Here are the differences I found between the new disc and the Criterion one...<br />PLUSES:<br />a.. Anamorphic widescreen.  The Criterion disc was not anamorphic.  As a result, the picture on the MGM disc is a lot less pixellated than the Criterion one.  The color is also more saturated.<br />b.. New sound mix.  The Criterion disc was mixed in Dolby surround.  The new mix is in Dolby 5.1, and they obviously had fun remixing it.  The surrounds are split and very directional.  The sound is really an improvement in every way (see (d)).<br />c.. It's the same unrated cut that was on the Criterion disc.<br />d.. They fixed some of the excrutiatingly bad sound edits that were on the Criterion disc.  Although Criterion had re-edited the violent footage back into the movie, they neglected to remix the sound for those moments, ie. they didn't remix the sound to blend the new footage.  On the new MGM disc, they FINALLY fixed this.  Now the new footage sounds like it was SUPPOSED to be there.<br />e.. As one reviewer mentioned before, the director's commentary on the MGM disc is new and completely different than the one on the Criterion disc (ie. don't throw away your Criterion disc).<br />f.. We finally have the sequels in anamorphic widescreen and Dolby 5.1.  This is a plus or a minus depending on if you enjoy them or not!  Although it would have been nice to have a longer version of Robocop 2, as Frank Miller has alluded that huge chunks of that movie were edited out of the final version.<br />g.. The new MGM version of Robocop also has some good documentaries and other curiosities for you to peruse (only on the unrated cut).  These are NOT available on the bare-bones theatrical DVD that MGM has out for individual sale.<br />------------<br />MINUSES:<br />a.. The picture is a bit darker on the MGM disc than on the Criterion disc.<br />b.. The director's commentary was recorded when they were watching the theatrical cut of the movie, so it is oddly funny (and a bit distracting) that they will be commenting, &quot;remember how we had to cut out the more violent shot of....&quot; when we at home are actually watching the footage that they are talking about.<br />c..  If you don't like the sequels, it sucks to be you, because the only way to get the unrated cut of the first movie is to buy the boxed set.<br />d..  Don't really know if this is a minus or not as I'm not 100% sure what Verhoeven's intention was.  The Criterion disc is framed at 1.66:1, and the new MGM disc is framed at 1.85:1.  As it is, Criterion tends not to mess around.  I'd wager that it's supposed to be projected at 1.66:1.  Either way, 1.85:1 still looks pleasing.<br />-----------<br />All in all, more pluses than minuses I wager.  I found that the new version has everything the Criterion one had, and it presents it in a more pleasing manner (sound, picture, extras, etc..).  If you're a fan, I think this would be right up your alley.to peruse (only on the unrated cut).

1594200106|4.0|A chilling, macabre horror story.  Like the shadowy denizens that stalk the characters of this story, the plot stalks its readers through the first half if the book.  At this point the reader is suddenly gripped by an awful realisation that just as an inescapable trap has been set for the hero of the story, a teenage boy, you yourself are gripped by fearsome jaws. In this deathgrip you are held tighter than any Agatha Christie.  From this point on there is no living, sleeping until the last page has been turned.  And keep turning, a few false endings hide the final pages.<br />The novel, the bookshop, the arts of writing, publishing and book collecting are the workbench of this work, and they are devices upon which the themes are worked.<br />The foibles of teenage eagerness played against an unsympathetic world make up the primary theme.  As lives are shaping themselves, the decisions and acts of young adults take dramatic effects.  Futures are determined by a moment.  Yet, there is hope that solace, guidance, salvation and wisdom may come to aid (even humour and good food).  To many, it does not.<br />Following closely behind, love takes its place.  Against a backdrop of misuse of power, moral corruption, and martial strife, love, loyalty and devotion are given weighty prominence.<br />Finally, the theme of integrity is borne out through the honesty of tradesmen and craftsmen who owe their dignity and satisfaction to their dedication to their profession.  In comparison rich merchants and traders who may wield great power can dissolve away.  Through war and time, through poverty and revolutions, lives are ravaged, what survives are those crafts and trades undiluted by corruption and unswayed by the ages.  An ornate pen bears witness to this theme - an object of enduring admiration on which the craft of writing may be borne.<br />The geography centres upon Barcelona.  The unreachable city of Paris is spoken of, while the magical lands of the Americas loom far off the horizon.  The era of turmoil places a terrifying edge to the story.  Read at your peril.e horizon.  The era of turmoil places a terrifying edge to the story.  Read at your peril.
B000002J09|5.0|One of the greatest albums ever recorded, Led Zeppelin IV is a complete masterpiece.<br />It starts off with the blues influenced Black Dog, a true classic. Plant's vocals are amazing and so are the guitar riffs.<br />Rock and Roll followers Black Dog, and is one of the most catchy (not in a bad way), song I've ever heard. A wonderful song and a true Zeppelin classic.<br />The Battle of Evermore follows, another Tolkien influenced song. Another classic and wonderful lyrics / guitar playing, as always.<br />Track 4 is of course, the main highlight. A true classic all the way around, Led Zeppelin at their finest hour. No greater song has ever been written, recorded, or played. It starts off slow and then drums are added and then finally Jimmy Page's solo. There are no flaws what-so-ever in this song. All 8:00 are a joy.<br />Misty Mountain Hop is another song where J.R.R. Tolkien influenced Led Zeppelin. Poppy, but still quite good. It is quite fun to dance too, and is too a classic.<br />It then leads into Four Sticks which is yet, another classic. A great rock song, the riffs and Plant's vocals are amazing.<br />Going to California is a wonderful song where Jimmy Page goes acoustic. Slow, peaceful, and nice.<br />The album ends with When the Levee Break, a true great Blues Rock song. Led Zeppelin at another peak. Absolutely amazing with Plant's vocals and the guitar riffs that Page puts out.<br />This album is a must for anyone who considers themselves to have taste in music. You can listen to it front to end without ever being bored, because every song on this album is a true classic.
B00004T9UF|4.0|With a lot of negative hype surrounding Marshall's debut album-\\"The Slim Shady LP\\", Eminem works around all of the controversy and puts out a very strong sophomore record.  This album had three major hits that put this record near the top of the charts, including the very touching \\"Stan\\" (feat. Dido), a very funny song lyrically-\\"The Real Slim Shady\\", and a hard shot at all of Em's critics-\\"The Way I Am\\".  This record is close to being great, but settles down at very good.  This CD has three amazing songs (mentioned above), Six great songs: \\"Marshall Mathers\\", \\"Criminal\\", \\"Who Knew\\", \\"I'm Back\\", \\"Drug Ballad\\", and \\"B**** Please II\\", Two Awful songs: \\"Remember Me\\" and Under the Influence\\", and two other very scary songs \\"Kill You\\", and \\"Kim\\".  In \\"Kim\\", Em raps about brutally killing his wife Kim, while still being able to  make it home in time to care for his beloved daughter Hailie.  Nonetheless, this album is still very good, and any Eminem fan should definitely have this.  I recommend picking this album up along with Eminem's debut \\"The Slim Shady LP\\", before buying the \\"Eminem Show\\".  10/10-beats, 9/10 -lyrics, 7/10-flow, 9/10-production
B000002TP7|5.0|On Ill Communication, the Beastie Boys continued the direction of their previous album Check Your Head, growing from strictly a rap group to a band that had its own distinctive sound. Once again they played their own instruments on many of the tracks and continued to expand their musical palette. While the vocal tracks are not as consistently strong as their first three albums, it's the eclecticism that makes this a great album that becomes more rewarding with repeated listens.<br /><br />There are several excellent tracks here with some of the vocal tracks such as \\"Root Down\\", \\"Sure Shot\\", \\"Get It Together\\", which features Q-Tip, and the hit single \\"Sabotage\\" being among their best rap songs. On these tracks, they continue to shine lyrically using their trademark old school references, especially on \\"Sure Shot.\\" But just as they've matured musically, one only need to listen to the lyrics on \\"Bodhisattva You\\", in which MCA speaks of his Buddhist faith, to see that the band has matured lyrically as well. The tracks \\"Heart Attack Man\\" and \\"Tough Guy\\" show the band recalling their early punk roots. However, it's the instrumentals here such as the jungle rhythms of \\"Shabala\\" and \\"Bobo On The Corner\\", the chaotic \\"Futterman's Rule\\", the warped \\"Eugene's Lament\\", and the slow jazz of \\"Ricky's Theme\\" that make the album a cohesive whole. The tracks \\"Sabrosa\\", \\"B-Boys Makin' With The Freak Freak\\", \\"Flute Loop\\", and the solemn album closer \\"Transitions\\" are also very good. Further illustrating the mood and diversity of the album is that the vocals are often distorted and dominated in the mix by the music, especially on the second half of the album. All told, this is the sound of a band evolving, a band that continues to challenge themselves with each release. Highly recommended.
0385335482|5.0|I just finished Confessions of a Shopaholic and honestly, I found myself daydreaming of when I win the lottery (as does the main character) and picking out expensive clothing to buy. It really makes you forget what you're doing and just wonder what is going to happen in this girls life!
0440234743|2.0|John Grisham has written a novel with almost no sympathetic characters.  There's a huge amount of money to be divided up by an eccentric billionaire...all of his relatives are greedy, almost worthless human beings.  Nate, the guy sent to find one last heir, is a recovering alcoholic/drug addict...I personally didn't care who got the money, but John Grisham really seems to be obsessed with large amounts of money.  Grisham's books are typically page turners, but this one was a tough one to plow through.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|All 27 songs on this album have something in common... They were all released as SINGLES,AND,they all hit the number 1 SPOT on the top 40 charts !!!
0446530891|2.0|i knew it be a matter of time before the grishman/baldacci style of writing junk for the masses would get to me.  well, it has.  I read this book in two days and like other reviewers found the story implausible and the charachter development moronic.  i guess that is why grishman/baldacci sell so well.
B000003S0R|3.0|of his remasters from the early to mid seventies, this is essentially Roxy Music without Ferry. Or at least a Manzanera and Eno project. In any case nowhere near the dynamic that infuses anything with the Fripp &amp; Eno moniker. Most of the CD sounds like Eno is still trying to establish just what his identity is. There aren't any melodies to speak of, but the experiments are courageous, and better stuff was coming. I'd recommend this for the completist only.
0802130208|5.0|this is probably the best book that i have read in the last 10 years.  the charachters are vivid.  in my humble opinion if you dont like this book then you have been corrupted by the formula driven books that are currently on the best seller lists.
B000001A3H|3.0|OK, this is a good cd.  maybe deserves 3.5, but I can't believe that people give this thing 5 stars.  The lyrics are not listenable (maybe intentionally so, but you gotta have some substance if you want a 5 star rock album).  It sounds like soundgarden early years meets ...and justice for all.  It's pretty good I'll give it that.  I heard sky valley and like it much better.
B0002234LS|5.0|Secret Window is a great film, loaded with so many well-directed scenes I wished it had been a longer movie.  The movie is based on a Stephen King novel (Four Past Midnight - Secret Window - Secret Garden), and while I haven't read that novel, this movie has convinced me to do just that.<br />Depp is a master at getting inside the role he plays, and being a writer myself, and having a lot of writer-friends, I can tell you that Depp did a great job portraying a successful writer in this movie.  But Depp fans are used to him delivering the goods, aren't they?  Yes would be the correct answer...<br />It is Johnny's little quirks and piffy comments, that one would swear had to be Depp's own toss-ins, which make this movie so easy to love.  When the young woman at the post office tells him he looks pale and he responds, \\"thanks\\", the dialogue flowed so well it seemed like a camera man had caught the two just having a daily conversation without them knowing they were being filmed; now that's acting.<br />The plot is great.  I didn't have a hard time figuring out where the movie was taking me, but it managed to make a figured-out-early-plot still ride quite nice.  There are a lot of scary parts, a lot of supenseful parts, and some really cool twists in this suspense - thriller.<br />The beginning of the movie grabs you - with Johnny Depp's character being accused of plagiarism by a very strange fellow.  What follows is a scary thriller sure to make you think.<br />Buy this film!  You won't be sorry!<br />See ya next review.<br />(...)

B00005K9LK|5.0|You have to OWN &quot;Screaming for Vengeance&quot;. This album showcases one of the greatest bands of the 70's &amp; 80's (and hopefully with the newly reunited Priest of the 2000's?!) I see other reviewers have tried to do a song by song rundown of the tracks on this disk, I won't even attempt that. The entire album is a guitar driven dream, Glenn Tipton and K.K. Downing are truly Metal Gods! And the fantastic vocals by Rob Halford make &quot;Vengeance&quot; on of the greatest rock albums of all time! This was the golden age of metal for Priest and if you have been hesitant in buying this disk because you thought that maybe the music wouldn't hold up after twenty years, think again! &quot;Vengeance&quot; is still as exciting and fresh as when it first arrived. If you are only vaguely familiar with Priest or plan on seeing them for the first time this year as Ozzfest, then start your Priest collection here!
B000000JO3|5.0|One Of the other reviewers said <br />\\"Yo people, by now everyone knows and loves punk, its hard to turn on a demo TV at any local appliance store without a jolly happy punk song selling products!! We all love punk!! Well now and then there are some bands who say their punk rawk but really are talentless posers trying to make a quick buck off a passing trend!! These Minor Threat dudes are posers trying to do just that!!!! The production is very bad, its hard to hear what the dude is saying, the guitars are outta tune and weak, the bass sounds like a bee buzzing and the drums sound like someone is hitting tin cans!! Please, for good punk, just stick with Good Charlotte, Blink 182, Green Day, Sum 41, SR 71, Limp Bizzkit and of course Linkin Park!! These guys will never be on TRL or American Idol, and if they do go on they'll be booed very loudly and I'd giggle about it!! Also if they were to be played at the Gap or Hawt Topic at the mall, the intelligent kids there wood tell the owner not so kindly to turn it off and put on something good like Puddle Of Mudd or the mighty Trapt!!! Peace out all... \\"<br />Ok, I like this CD it's awsome. But Dude, you think Greenday, Sum 41, and Blink 128 are punk They are like (Pop-punk/ panzy punk, I don't even concider them punk.)? Well they aren't. Before you start saying how bad bands are and how they are posers learn what punk actully is. Cheack out Stiff Little fingers, Sex Pistols, there are so many great punk bands. Yet all of those bands you metioned suck (except Sum 41, Blink and Greenday, bu they are not punk!). If you think that all those bands you mentioned were punk, then you are a poser, you obviosuly no nothing about punk rock. Limp Bizkit, Linkin Park, trapt, and Puddle of mudd are some of the worst bands ever. Grow up listen to real music and don't call other peopel posers when you don't even know what Punk rock is.<br />Any way, I would suggest this album, there is sometihng about it I just really love. And don't listen to reviewers that listen to Godd Charlotte, they obviously have no taste in music.<BR>Bottom line this album is good, there are better ones but I'd recommend this anyway.
B00005JMFQ|4.0|I am not normally one who likes the romantic comedy genre, but this one has changed my mine. It is definately the feel-good movie of the year. A wonderful cast, and a wonderful writer/director. The only thing I don't understand is several of the reviews comments that it had an anti-American sentiment...say huh? Did we watch the same movie?
1400034779|4.0|Mma Precious Ramotswe is not your typical  34 year old Botswanian woman.  She has her own house, her own detective agency and has no husband.  It is with pleasure that the reader is treated to her world and the beautiful descriptions of her native Africa.  Alexander McCall Smith has delivered a series of enjoyable vignettes in which the reader is witness to Mma Ramotswe's common sense and considerable intuition as she solves both large and small matters of mystery for the local community.  What makes the pages so enjoyable are the descriptions of the characters, local lands, traditions of the African people and the humor in which the mysteries are solved.  It is not often that an author can combine beautiful prose, well developed characters and humor in a simple story that touches the heart.  I look forward to reading the sequels.
B0000C2IQD|5.0|Chitty Chitty Bang Bang on DVD is now in WIDESCREEN and at last we get a bang for our buck. &quot;Why issue a classic widescreen epic on DVD if you are not going to present it in its original aspect ratio?&quot; That was my original question along with many many more fans as this Ian Fleming tale. Count Zborowski is no longer as disapointed about this DVD as he must have been when he lost the original Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang in 1922. This is an outstanding DVD presentation with pleny of extras for the young and old alike.
B000002JBG|5.0|When I first heard it, I listened to every track. I didn't skip once. Favorites for me is D'Angelo's song &quot;Smile Again&quot;, Seal's version of &quot;Fly Like An Eagle&quot;, LL Cool J, Method Man, Busta Rhymes &amp; Coolio's &quot;Hit Em High&quot; and R. Kelly's &quot;I Believe I Can Fly.&quot; They were the highlights but all of the soundtrack is good.
B000002LFZ|5.0|One thing that facsinates me about Fleetwood Mac,is how lead singers are alternated.Songs such as Rhiannon,Dreams and Gypsy are sung by Stevie Nicks.Ohters like Over My Head,You Make Loving Fun and Everywhere are sung by Christine McVie(who sounds a lot like Joni Mitchell in her song Over My Head).Songs like Don't Stop,Go Your Own Way and Big Love are sung by Lindsey Buckingham.In other words,some songs are sung by female vocalists,others by male vocalists.Sometimes you wouldn't know that it was the same group singing.My favourite band member would be Stevie Nicks.The fact that this group's history goes back to the late 60s with Peter Green is relatively new to me.Fleetwood Mac is one unique and remarkable band.
0930289234|5.0|That is the simple question that Watchmen poses and is one of the many clever conceits that Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons employ throughout the 12-issue mini-series that is collected in this fine trade paperback.<br />Moore and Gibbons present a world not unlike ours. An alternate reality where the United States won Vietnam (thanks to Dr. Manhattan--the book's only Superman) and as a result Nixon stayed President. Dirgibles instead of airplanes can be seen in the sky, there are electric powered cars and a popular fast food chain of Indian restaurants known as Gunga Diner are everywhere.<br />In this world, superheroes have been outlawed because the police felt that their jobs were threatened and so only Government sanctioned costumed heroes can legally operate. That doesn't stop Rorschach, a masked vigilante from plying his trade.<br />Why am I going into all this detail? Because Watchmen is all about the details. Moore and Gibbons vividly draw us into this world through the most minute details, often populating the backgrounds of panels so that they only become obvious upon multiple readings.<br />What is so astounding about Watchmen is that it works on so many levels. Superficially, it's a murder mystery. However, it also asks many big questions like, who makes the world? Who is responible? Is everything planned out or is it all up to chance?<br />Watchmen is also a marvel of technique. Moore and Gibbons employ all sorts of film techniques (zoom ins, close-ups, revolving &quot;the camera&quot; around somebody, lighting effects, etc) and also several techniques of rhythm. For example, look closely at the panel layout for Chapter 5: Feaful Symmetry. The panel layout on the first page is exactly the same as the last page and so on until the center pages which mirror each other perfectly. Or all of the smiley face images that pop up throughout the various chapters. This is only a taste of what is going on in this book. It really is an astounding work.<br />There is a reason why Watchmen is so highly regarded. It is an amazing accomplishment and one that takes the costumed superhero genre seriously. If you haven't ever read this book before then I strongly recommend checking it out. If you aren't a huge fan of comic books, this one will change your mind. It proves that comics aren't just for kids. Not any more.ason why Watchmen is so highly regarded. It is an amazing accomplishment and one that takes the costumed superhero genre seriously.

6304286961|5.0|I must say Oliver Stone and his company did a great job of recreating the atmosphere of the late 1960s.The film looks like a sixties movie.Val Kilmer was the perfect choice for the role of Jim Morrison.Though some of it was rather exagerrated,like the scene where the band performs on The Ed Sullivan Show.Ed had forbid Jim to say&quot;higher&quot;in the song Light My Fire,and Jim said it with an emphasized expression.I've got the actual episode of The Ed Sullivan Show taped.The real Jim did disobeye Ed by saying&quot;higher&quot;,but without the emphasized expression.Meg Ryan does a good portrayal of Pamela Courson too.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|This has to be my favourite film of all time, and I wouldn't be able to explain why, other than saying that it is truly beautiful. Every time I watch it I am astounded by the beauty of the story of love, family, life and time travel! I do not concentrate on the time travelling aspect of the film, but rather on Donnie's realisation that his mother loves him, the blossoming young love between Donnie and Gretchen and the controversial questions within the film about life and the existence of God. Some of the scenes are so perfectly shot, especially those with music played over them. One such scene is Donnie's bike ride to the 80's vibe of Echo and the Bunny Men. Every time I have watched this film I have cried at the final conclusion even though I know it is coming, because it is so heart wrenchingly beautiful. The acting by Jake Gyllenhaal in this film is mind boggling- he has the sickening devious smile working for him and the whole confused adolescent style to his acting. Also, he's not bad to look at!<BR>My friends laughed when I told them about this film, and then when they watched it they realized how stunning it was. If I could give you one piece of valuable advice, it would be to watch Donnie Darko as soon as possible!
B000002UAU|5.0|OK, it's debatable. But it remains my favorite Beatles album. Why? It's not because it has the best songs, though the songs are great. It's not the Beatles' most mature work, it doesn't have the discipline of Revolver, but what it does have, in spades, is flair, mood, and atmosphere. Every songs, from a dance hall number like When I'm 64 to a pure Indian track like Within You Without You is permeated with a psychedelic carnival vibe. One can visualize Sgt. Pepper and the boys setting up under the big tent to perform the greatest show ever, and wowing the audience with a couple of catchy numbers before launching into a mind-expanding &quot;trip&quot; through a psychedelic wonderland (Lucy), a classical paeon to freedom (She's Leaving Home), a bizarre circus show (Mr. Kite), a meditation on the state of being (Within You Without You), and then there's even time for an unconventional ode to a lovely meter maid (Rita). Every track oozes Sixties exploration and liberation, circa the Summer of Love. Sgt. Pepper is like a happier, more hippiesh sequel to Revolver. It too explores the many facets of life (love, aging, self-improvement, work, escape, friendship, the bizarre sideshow quality of society, its mundane aspects, and the possibility of understanding and awakening). However, unlike Revolver, in which the songs remains anxious, tired, and frightened much of the time (giving it that edgy quality that many critics prefer these days), Sgt. Pepper views these themes most often with bemusement, entertained bewilderment, or intrigued awe. Through drugs and the countercultural community, the worried citizen of Revolver has found bliss and escape...or has he? The band closes out with a resounding reprise and then as the show ends, and the tent's packed up, and the spectators go home, we're left to contemplate the brutal reality of a &quot;day in the life.&quot; This song is bipolar, veering from acute, morose awareness of life's tragedy and absurdity, to cheery disinterent and focus on the mundane tasks of the moment, and then back again, until the emotions escalate and end in the overpowering chord that slowly dies out, leaving nothing in its week. A Day in the Life rescues Sgt. Pepper from being complete fun, gives the album an undertone of seriousness it would lack otherwise, and reaffirms the album's importance as a coherent statement from the greatest band of all time. In this period of their careers the Beatles truly were, to borrow a phrase from the great Wind in the Willows (and the title of Pink Floyd's debut), the pipers at the gates of dawn. Enter as soon as you can.<BR>6/6
