B00AB7HESI|3.0|The game is awesome but there are barley any levels the amount 64 (I'm guessing .)But the other parts are great and get hard at times which I love because I hate easy games for a example octodad(you can only get on computer )I would rather get slender .
B001QJUX24|5.0|JOHN WAYNE.... A GREAT AMERICAN.  A great movie and it looks great after all these years and brings back memories of a simplier time
B0016JBCJW|5.0|This movie is one of Wes Anderson's best. I have watched it 4 times since renting it on Amazon Instant video a couple of days ago. It simply ticks all the boxes of why I want to see a film.  I love films that take me somewhere, either geographically or spiritually, and \\"The Darjeeling Limited\\" did both and more. The filming is beautifully done, it moves quickly and is thoroughly entertaining.<br /> It is light and heavy at the same time,  I loved it!
B004498KPU|1.0|Because I just open it and it and it has two bonus dvds  instead of disc 1. Disc two was included
B007IXWKUK|4.0|It is interesting, psychologically, to delve into the characters and it's well-written. It flows. There is too much devoted to sex scenes, however, so that the time sequence and span of the book is confusing. It has a little more plot than book one and is a little less like one big orgy, but not much.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|this game is awesome,the graphics,and the game is very realistic,love the weapons too,it's a cool game i recommend this game,especially if you like hunting
B008Y212PI|5.0|Easy to learn and addicting to play. I will definitively be getting other titles in the series. Good graphics a d challenging solutions.
B006G7Y7GY|5.0|Great book from the beginning of Heavy Medal.. Ozzy's book is entertaining and laughable at times. Easy read and goes over all the changes that happened to him from the beginning to now! A kudos to Sharon!
B005LLSNNE|5.0|This show gets you hooked and you stay hooked.. You actually feel you become part of the cast, would recommend.
B00338QENI|2.0|The story itself is fascinating but I thought the way it was told was disjointed and kept repeating the same info.
B004GTKP3S|5.0|I was suffering from lack of Downtown Abbey and found this series.  Love Judi Dench and the story is wonderfully entertaining.  Blasted through the entire series and enjoyed it a lot.  Kind of gives you a look into the earlier days when everything was centered around status and propriety.
B00EY8A6BC|1.0|TERRIBLE movie.  Obviously has talented actors, but there is really no character development and the story itself is just nonsense.  Beyond that the camera work is irritating.  May as well tie a rope to the camera and swing it over your head with all the non-stop swooping camera shots which apparently were there to disorient the viewer so they wouldn't notice the total lack of any sensible plot!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love to play the game because it helps keep your mine working to find the solution  to the game.
B00FRQ32N4|1.0|I really wanted to play this but it has been downloading for an hour and I am dissapointed. really wish it would just download for me. 1234
B005S9EJ46|5.0|I fell in love with this when I saw it in a theater and was happy to be able to buy it when it came out.  I have since re-watched it a few times (something I seldom do) and shared it with many friends, who all were also charmed by it.  Great movie that sticks with you, with very funny quotes by some very funny actors.
B00B01XDTI|3.0|As always I love the music and the visuals that go along with most entries in the Silent Hill universe but this movie really missed every other mark. Michael J. Basset was a horrible choice as director and writer of this film. My biggest gripe is how bland all of the dialogue was in this. I think the actors did what they could but there's only so much you can do with a script like this one. If you are a die hard Silent Hill fan like myself it still might be worth checking out for the atmosphere and music and some great visuals but this director really didn't understand the subject matter the way that Christophe Gans did. Had he or Roger Avary been involved this would have been so much better.
B00FHB7398|5.0|As usual Big Fish does not disappoint.  Really good hidden object/adventure game.  Good graphics.  I think their games just get better and better.  Please keep them coming.  They give me hours of joyful entertainment.
B00F0O8SZK|4.0|Loved this album. I gave it a 4 because it was too short! Would have liked a few more songs.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I read all three Hunger Game books in a fever. Since then I've re-read the first book several times, but not Catching Fire or Mockingjay. With the Catching Fire movie coming out this month I thought I'd refresh my memory. And wow, I had forgotten how great it is. Collins upped her game in the second book, not an easy thing to do. I was always Team Gale but it's Katniss and Peeta's relationship that stands out in this book, and Katniss begins to enlarge her world view. Characters like Cinna and Finnick really add to the story, allowing us to see how the rest of the districts view our heroine. I cannot wait to see how this book translates on the big screen!
B00A81NFAS|5.0|This was a really great movie, one that I saw and decided I needed to add to my library.  The actors very realistically portray real, flawed people. Mental illness is portrayed in a realistic way, but the central driver is a very dis-functional family. Highly recommended.
B00G32QIEG|4.0|Not a movie for the serious thinker, but If you want a fun men in black type of movie you could do worse than this. I really enjoyed Jeff Bridges performance but I feel like this could have been a lot better with someone other than Ryan Reynolds paired up with him. Definitely a little cheesy from time to time but I'm sure you're already expecting that. I don't know if I would say its worth buying but you should rent it if you're in the mood for this kind of thing.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|Well written, well thought out, beautiful imagery and a heroin for the ages. The call of the wild is one of the best books I have read in a very long time and as an avid reader I do not say that lightly. I will be buying a copy of this book for my collection
B003H4I4JU|5.0|Great fiction novel. Well written and a terrific continuation of Enders Game. Author is very committed to a story line that keeps you reading.
B00AAI7B7W|5.0|It had been many years since I had seen the movie.  It is still as good as the first time I saw it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I can't wait to play again, just can't put it down and it really makes you think. would recommend it to anyone
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|This is probably the most fun I've had with a movie since Limitless. I felt reluctant about watching this but now I'm really glad that I did. I won't say much about the plot since I'm sure you've already got that down. The pacing is excellent and I felt like all the performances were perfect for this kind of movie. If you're looking for a well acted, fun, and fast paced film, try this one out.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This is a great game, fun and easy to play.It's very enjoyable for anyone who likes<br />Boxing. You buy the robot you want and fight. You can also upgrade your robot to make it like Midas (the last champion until you go to underworld 2). It's awesome<br />And fun for ages 8+.
B00FJMK9VE|5.0|I would have to say, probably the best album they have every produced...  Can't wait for the follow up album.
B000FC12C8|5.0|The Intelligent Investor is a great book that will let you see the historical trends of the market and the people that invest in them.  This book will always remain relevant to modern time even though it was written years ago.
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|It does the job it took me a bit to get it but it is a very good product when you are on the go and need to know if it is to high
B00COHAUD4|3.0|Great style and atmosphere but the story itself drags this one down unfortunately. This one could serve as a background viewing while doing something else but don't expect much otherwise.
B00GINENG0|5.0|This game is so cute and adorable. Tom repeats every thing you say. But u can't leave him by himself to long because then he becomes hungry,sleepy, and has to use the bathroom. It is so fun how you get to see him grow if I could I would give it 5 1/2 stars
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This is truly a great read.  It keeps you wanting more, it was truly hard to put down.  I'm not a big reader, but this book was great, I had it read in no more than a week.  It's only a shame there wont be another.  RIP Chris Kyle.
B00FLNRN06|4.0|A movie you can just sit back and laugh at.  Be warned though, if the synopsis didn't give u enough warning, this movie is deff not for anyone under 16 do to language, theme etc.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|I have used it and it does the job and the ring will wake anyone up. it is a good product and anyone who need loud you have got it
B004FUPK6U|3.0|I wonder why Dario hasn't been able to capture the same majestic spirit he acquired while creating his supreme masterpiece &#34;Suspiria.&#34;<br /><br />It's still an interesting and classic piece of work from Argento, but it doesn't have the essence or genius of Suspiria.  Watch it only if you're an Argento fan, or if you love Italian Gore, such as myself.<br /><br />3 out of 5 stars!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|get this game it is awesome you will love I know that I do its fun and it deducting you will love it
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|It was well documented.  Easy to read.  A true eye opener.  I've already lost 3-4 pounds and feel energized with no brain fog.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|I really liked this book. It was s such an easy read that I think I will probably read it again.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Can't beat building with blocks in a virtual world and blowing up sheep with dynamite.  The intricacy of what you can do in this game is incredible.
B00000J2KR|5.0|A true artist does not submit himself to exposure of the pride.<br /><br />Stanley Kubrick molded Barry Lyndon into one of the finest films of the 20th century.  Ryan O'Neal has his Magnum opus.  Applaud the film God's for their creation of pure joy.  It certainly makes it's way into my top 3 Kubrick films, along side of &#34;A Clockwork Orange&#34; and &#34;2001.&#34;<br /><br />Great film. Great director. Great Ryan O'Neal.<br /><br />Thank you for reading my opinion.
B004S49YVU|5.0|An absolutely fantastic read. David Baldarcciwrites decisively keeping readers waiting for more. It had me on the edge of my seat and Oliver Stone is a hero who knows knows right from wrong and good from evil.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|I think that this was an interesting perspective for a book and I am looking forward to the movie.  How will they portray death, do you see him or is he always in the shadows?
030746363X|2.0|Give up on fruits and milk, then take Creatine?!<br />No our ancestors didn't have California orange at December but they didn't have Creatine 365 days in a year! Instead they dried fruits for those snowy days! They were not as rich and they stayed on a balanced moderate diet.<br /><br />All I can say is keep the motivation and the approach.<br /><br />His package may make sense for people who always buy packaged food, but not me. If you don't hesitate to take lots of supplements take it all, but I don't recommend it.<br />I don't feel well about hacking my metabolism by unknown chemicals!<br /><br />I also think he jumps around different branches, instead of focusing on around one strong line.<br /><br />I have one more line here for all the supplement market ... a 3% fat body is not a natural body, neither is the prescriptions to go there ... be cautious of what can happen to you after a decade ...<br />One example of a more academic approach to high protein low carb diet, what fitness gurus recommend as a practice of a life:<br />[...]
B00G4CXHSK|5.0|I think it's very cool it's where you fight a bunch of a alians and upgrade your gun or your health
B0045HCJKS|5.0|Everything about this film screams &#34;Technology.&#34;  I love the digital image processing and the use of props from the different eras of history.  Yul Brynner turns from his &#34;The Magnificent Seven&#34; performance into a role of OUTLAW-ROBOT with a grudge.<br /><br />It's rated PG, but has some scenes that would suggest otherwise.<br /><br />Westworld hopefully will live up to your expectation and I appreciate you taking the time to read my review.<br /><br />UPDATE: HBO is working on a TV show based upon the film.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Kindly update the game because I'm really addicted to this game...<br />I would appreciate it if you will do it...<br />Thank you so much!!!<br />For now, i will only give 3 stars<br />Keep the update coming!
B001P06GX4|5.0|This is a fun game to be played by adults and children. We play with our teenage grandchildren and we all have such fun laughing. There's really no right or wrong move, and you don't play as partners.
B00457X7XQ|5.0|This book is a must read for everyone!  The subject of cyberspace has been under the mainstream radar for years and is only now coming to the surface.  Mark Russinovich has an excellent writing style that allows the average reader to understand the high tech world we live in and the potential security problems that surround us.  It is a great book.
B00GFOIUVQ|2.0|Its just what i expected. It lets you do a few levels then you have to in app purchase to continue. Unless you can grind for several months  you have to use money to upgrade thor and buy his weapons and some of your soldiers require you to buy them something that you have to in app purchase to get unless you can grind. The reason i gave it three stars is because it has good graphics. Uninstalling.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Great graphics. Gets my heart pumping every time I play. Difficulty is perfect to keep it challenging, but not impossible. Highly recommended!
B0088O11NU|5.0|Very entertaining game when your on the road, wish it had more levels but still it's  great and keeps the kids entertained.
B007PP2J9I|5.0|Loved it!  This is the 2nd book in a series and each book just gets better.  Would make a good gift .
B00G4CXHSK|4.0|At first it seams like an easy game with over priced stuff,but them it becomes good. You only have to play for a few days to get lots of money and buy the best guns and costumes. Costumes do not only serve for aesthetic purposes but they also increase health, agility, and strength. The only problem is that it lags. Sometimes i cant even defeat the bosses before the game shuts down. So overall it is a good game but it lags(if its any help I'm using a kindle fire).
B00GHJ6BJW|5.0|Lady Gaga is an extraordinary singer and performer. Artpop has made me so happy, every time I listen I just  smile so much and sing along. Everyone should listen to Artpop. Everyone.
B005LAIHQS|3.0|Entertaining.  Some funny parts, and enjoyable, but not like the first Men In Black.  Not much else to say about it.  It was as expected, just another part to the other two movies.  I always look forward to good movies, but not much around these days sadly, just fair ones.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Hipnotic and mesmerizing, King at his best!  Great characters and seamless story, I couldn't put it down, Bravo Mr. King!
B008602KQI|4.0|The book is a 5 star.  The movie was very good, but missed much of the development of the characters in the beginning.  Seems like we were thrust into the drawing for the reaping before getting to know the storyline better.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|lots of puzzle fun. including help from facebook friends that can help you get through the levels.  a good mix of easy and challenging levels.
B00A2H9PLG|2.0|Actually I would give it 1 1/2 stars if I could.<br /><br />Story line is not remotely plausible at all (No kidding), having a bunch of right wing nuts at the very top of our government, with some more right wingers added in to almost cause a third world war just because of a son being killed in action, defense contracts coming to an end, and the Speaker of the House wanted to go after Iran, is just plain dumb, silly story line, and this movie just went down the tubes right from the start.  Mentioning start, we have a Secret Service Wannabe, who was not qualified to apply, but the writers wanted this in a well to make him the hero. Jamie Farr was not a plausible President either.  Than we have a little girl that does not call her Dad father in the movie (Because Mom and Dad are divorced) until close to the end, and I have seen this before in another movie.  Wish they would stop doing this.<br /><br />Anyway, it was not to my liking, but I paid for it....Dearly
B0014D6PCO|4.0|Awesome movie. Too bad the following movies deviated from this first one so much. I'd say its biggest problem is that they left too many loose ends.
B0084670FU|2.0|The plot of this movie was hard to follow, and when you did figure out what was going on, it just wasn't that interesting.  Don't know how this could be labeled &#34;Brad Pit's best film&#34;.
B00CH3DBNQ|4.0|I normally do not write reviews.  It was easy to tell when it was Malala's thoughts and when it was the author's.  I enjoyed having a peak into a culture I knew so little about.  What interested in me was how quickly a society could be overtook by lack of education.  When people are unable to read or write, they depend on other peoples words.
B0018QOIXU|3.0|I got this for two of the songs on the CD. I like the other songs but don't think I would have purchased if I had heard the whole CD in advance. She has a lovely voice and I love her singing style. I know more of the songs on her 21 album, I should have purchased that one. Either way though, her voice is amazing and different, a breath of fresh air to the music industry. Just wasn't too into the CD as a whole.
B0082RHRHC|5.0|Spectacular! I loved it!!! Didn't think it would be as good as I found it to be! So very good
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|It is so cool like you can do awesome stuff like to change your theme it is the best app I had ever had
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I found myself skimming only the first line of the paragraphs to get through.  The ending could have been better.  Finished it because it was the last book in the series.
B00DAPOHU6|3.0|A little bit disappointed in Jack Johnson's newest CD. I love all of his other CD's, but this one is mediocre compared to his previous works.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|This app is so fun i couldn't use a video camera on my kindle fire so that's why users great for me
B00FHAM3Q2|4.0|I haven't really paid attention to Miley's music until I started seeing her on TV shows recently & hearing her music.  I've always thought her &#34;actions&#34; have been for publicity/attention.  I've never had anything against her music-she has a great voice.  Once I heard a couple of the songs from this albums on TV shows, I like the sound & purchased the album.  It's all pretty good music-yes, I was a bit surprised about liking the whole album, but I do!
B003MYYJD0|5.0|Arrived on time.<br />Perfect watch. Beautiful and elegant.<br />The gold color is similar a jowel.<br />Recomend this Product for all custumers
B003K15IF8|5.0|This book was beautifully written, but probably not for everyone. If you need a wham-bang plot and lots of exotic locations, this probably won't satisfy.  It is a powerful masterpiece about a quiet life that I'll remember for a long time.
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|I think its a great app to clean viruses and make the device run faster. If you have not downloaded this app i highly suggest you do.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|5 stars...what else can I write. Easy to navigate.  And does not change format often.  Like links under 'more'. Not cluttered with info I am not interested in.
B005KP7EK4|4.0|Good story, Sam Sheppard is a great actor and the location was very nice!  Not fast paced, and the story was well written.
B00F35BV64|2.0|If you are a trekkie or a trekker stay away from this movie. The writers and directors never saw a Star Trek movie. Story line was a total disaster and it was so predictable.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I highly recommend this guys! This one is perfect for everybody who is seeking for another unique play you want to enjoy! This will help you enhance and improve your skills in thinking and you'll never know that you're sticking to this game. Just try, it's fun!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally the real candy crush saga is back on kindle fire! Glad y'all could bring it back! Thank you so much! By far the most addictive game I have ever played.
B001F4UHGC|4.0|This was a great movie with a great story line.  They could remake this movie and keep the story line pretty much the same.  I purchased the movie only to see Steve McQueen but I was really surprised at how good the story line really was and I can't believe that they haven't remade this movie yet.  The only reason why I didn't give this movie 5 stars is because I have been spoiled by the film quality of the newer movies.  But for the time this movie was made the film quality is very good.  I liked this movie so much that I actually purchased another copy to give as a gift.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|I just want to say a big &#34;WOW&#34; !<br />I was a bit skeptical about Gaga's ARTPOP but WOW dude ! It is REALLY crazy !<br />I just started to listen and I felt that songs that I am listening, they are growing on me...I am getting more and more addicted to songs. I have never EVER felt this feeling before. This album has a very strong/solid creative background. Honestly, Lady Gaga is like my friend/mother/relative/teacher and it is very nice to see that she is getting bigger and bigger...<br /><br />Lady Gaga is becoming a TRUE legend...She will never NEVER be forgotten...<br />BUY this album if you are fan of REAL and CREATIVE music !
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|As a 15- year old, this game for me makes me so happy to play with and I really believe that this is the sugar that is placed in the kitchen and I'm playing with it! It just make you more conservative using sugars when you play this game! It's fun, fun, fun!
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|It starts out strong, but then seems to drag out a little long towards the end.  The subject matter, however, does give one pause to think.  There are compelling arguments for certain degrees of &#34;transparency,&#34; but it is easy to see how it can get out of hand.  I think it is a compelling read overall.
B00B52FDXQ|3.0|I liked this season but this was the worst of the trilogy and I'm glad that it's over with now so I don't feel compelled to purchase another season.
B00GINENG0|5.0|I love this game so much I decided to call him Sonic I had cats but we live to close to the road we had to give them up. Now that I have Sonic I'm not lonely. This game is not lame at all I'm telling you to get this game.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|I am using kindle fire HD today and I am envy in my friend whose playing with this game on his iPad. But when I saw this one day on the app store, I immediately downloaded it and happy to find out that it's okay! Keep it coming Amazon! We love it!
1932100660|5.0|The book arrived promptly and in good condition!<br />Now, I will spend some good time reading it and<br />learning about the China Study.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Fun game at first...sucks you in.  It has made it too hard to win anything without gifting/trading.  Takes the fun out of it.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|We bought it as a birthday gift for our son and he loved it.  While it comes with a small instruction pamphlet, he quickly moved onto making other designs.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|I got this one for free and it really made me happy because I don't have to spend $1.08 for the game ($.99 + tax= $1.08). You know, the cool graphics of the game is the one I am happy the most! And overall, I'm impressed! It looks 3D to me, WOW!
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|I hate Tom Cruise, but he does get great scripts. This is a beautiful movie to watch as well as exciting.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|More addicting than Angry Birds! It has a good story line to keep you interested in playing, even though the puzzles can be very tricky!
B008JFUPK8|5.0|This movie was incredible!  Perfect writing for a new origin story and so many more possibilities for the franchise. I've already seen this movie 10+ times and it doesn't get old. It has the best action of any super hero movie to date. Get this movie if you want to see something done with intelligence rather then the effort less Marvel movies.
B00EU9VCKO|4.0|It's okay for you if you're finding a good one to edit your photos. But take note, this may disappoint you for not all of these styles are unique. If you're an ordinary person looking for a photo editor, try this! It will make your photo more valuable! :)
B00EVW0SA0|4.0|This was waaaay better than Olympus has Fallen. Great action. Ok, I had to suspend belief quite a few times, but still handled well. Jamie Foxx makes a kick ass President.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I had no idea what I was getting myself into when I started this book. I picked it up and set it down in frustration because I could not tell where it was headed. I really liked the writing style and it was easy to get involved with the book. I'm glad the Sheriff went out the way he did. I hope it was painful and lasted a long time. Now, time to start the second book!
B008LXZFH6|1.0|video wouldn't load. could not get it to download, it was extremely slow and I did not watch it, can I be reimbursed
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Plague. All we can imagine is how intelligent this game is made and is outstanding! This is the best strategy app I'm looking forward to so far! I love it, you should try this.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|So good it encouraged me to read the book for more info. Don't read the book. It is a mess. The author is an artist not a writer.
B0091LRZZW|4.0|A calm, sedate musical performance by several high caliber entertainers, including the female pianist with an international tour history.  An intimate & somewhat informal gathering of famed McCartney and background instrumentalists.
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|A fascinating and entertaining look at a transformational year for the USA. Bryson's writing is crisp, the pace is balanced and his facts (sometimes bizarre) keep you wanting more. Buy it.
B005EGXTHG|5.0|Good book. Lots of twists and turns. Can't wait to read the next one. Hopefully it is as good as the first two
B00BUCW54Q|4.0|Not a Tom Cruise fan, but this was an enjoyable thriller.  Tom plays an interesting character, a military ex-cop, who is in town to murder a man suspected of a mass killing.  Everyone thinks he is the suspect's friend,(which annoys tom's character), but he investigates the case more to catch everyone involved in the crime not clear the suspect.
B005LAIHY0|4.0|I really liked this film, even after watching it a few times.  I'm not exactly sure why, either.  I saw the plot holes, but everything else in the film combined together made the plot holes not matter as much to me as they usually would.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Great prose, good story tempo and lots of fulfilled facts.  If you are looking for an inspirational story this is it.
B007AJFSJW|5.0|For those who have had little or no formal education in economics this book is fascinating.  It is very clearly and engagingly written.  I have read it twice. There can be little question that Krugman, a Princeton professor and Nobel Laureate, is a very competent teacher.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I though it was pretty fun, but the in app purchasing is over the top. I can barely do ANYTHING with the purchasing. Also, updating or downloading the game takes a DREADFULLY long time. Besides all that, I thought it was a fun and cool game for kids, at least.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|It was an intriguing end to the story of Tris Prior and the conflict over genetic engineering. The system is reorganized, and Four spends time with the other refugees.<br /><br />The end was worth waiting for weeks after reading the first two books in a flash.
1609611543|5.0|Everyone needs to read this book and the one he wrote after it....I got off wheat and with the combination of being wheat free and keeping my body in a more alkaline state, I'm now pain free...amazing the poisons we put in our bodies
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's actually pretty realistic and very enjoyable. I've been wanting a game like this and it works perfectly! Hope you enjoy it to!
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|This is a Great Star Trek movie where the immature Captain Jim Kurt becomes the Kurt that he is in the TV Series.
B00GD9F59S|5.0|OMG, what a fantastic ending to a fantastic series.  Even after all he did, I wish Seth's fate could have followed a happier course...  The final battle was epic!
B007ELLDFO|5.0|After many years of seeing the film several times and the magnificent performance of Maggie Smith- which left me wondering what happened to Sandy and the other characters, I decided to order the book. This is a true 'slice of life'  in pre- WWII Scotland portrayed by the author, and I very much enjoyed the character development.
B00957T6X6|5.0|Great seller! I love this show and the books are way better. I highly recommend these books to anyone that like to read.
B0038AUY96|5.0|My favorite thriller / detective writer this year, with a great story and a very likable detective and wonderful twists.
0439023521|5.0|I love this book so much that I can’t stop reading it over and over. The book is called The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins. It  has every thing a book needs: it has suspense, action, romance, and betrayal. This book Is the best book in the world. I had to buy the other two books in the series, Catching Fire, and Mocking Jay. I saw the first movie and can’t wait to see the second movie, that is how much I love this series. I would recommend this book to any one who likes action books. If I had to summarize the plot of this book in three sentences, I would say that the plot is to win the games or die trying. If you win, that means fame and fortune. Losing means certain death. My opinion of the book is that if you read it  you won’t want to stop reading all 374 pages. I read the first book in 1 day and it was so good that I begged my Grandma to buy the second book the first day it came out.
B0096BIENY|5.0|This is the most beautiful CD I have ever listened to.  Close your eyes and enjoy, you will weep!!  Bellissimo!!!
B00EE3FTNM|4.0|Excellent acting, very intense human drama, nice development of story. But somewhat difficult to hear and understand, as is often the case with British drama productions; the actors mumble, in accents difficult to decode. The music added much to the quality of the production.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Really fun and exciting very pumping. The graphics are amazing and the way you move is creative in my oppinion.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I have read this beautiful story multiple times, and it never ceases to amaze. It falls in the young adult fiction genre but is really an amazing story to be appreciated by all age groups.
B005NPCUC8|5.0|What can you say about Dark Side of the Moon - one of the best albums of all time ever
0316204366|5.0|I simply don't know where to start with this review.  Malcolm Gladwell is unique: where others wish to simply reinforce a position, he is like a bomb under a bridge - his mission is to blow up our current way of looking at things, using data and interviews with people embedded in the worlds he views, so that we can experience multiple epiphanies and work with him in small ways, through the decisions we make post-reading, to make the world a better place.<br /><br />My key take-aways:<br /><br />Big classes are bad, small classes are not automatically better - in fact classes with few kids in them can be seriously damaging to your kid's growth. The middle ground is where kids do best.<br /><br />Getting great grades at an okay university will land you a better job than getting okay grades at a great university.<br /><br />Dyslexics are potentially great leaders because of the way they are forced to process information.<br /><br />Never assume that being the underdog is a bad thing.<br /><br />The &#34;three strikes&#34; law was complete overkill, California.<br /><br />Forgiving bad acts allows you to strengthen relationships that would otherwise be badly affected by getting even. Revenge has costs that can be as destructive as the original act.<br /><br />I need to tell my wife, son, and daughter that I love them, more.<br /><br />I also had another key takeway - I have even more respect for the freedom fighters of Alabama and the American South than I had before reading this.  No only were they insanely brave, they played a much better game of chess than I had ever imagined.  The stories behind the Civil Rights Movement are worth the price on the book jacket alone.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|The whole &#34;This is our film and lucas has no right to change it&#34; thing, is really ignorant. Star Wars is the only movie treated this way. The movie is fantastic and so is the Blu-Ray set. Yes Darth Vader use of the word &#34;NO&#34; (I had no problem with it when he says it low) was strange in ROTJ but its seriously I have been a fan since I was little. I still love it.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Excellent perspective of Germans during the Hitler era who were not Nazis.  How a child initially raised under the worst circumstances is able to blossom in a loving environment.
B00EW9GQR6|2.0|I just bought this a few days ago.  Eagerly anticipated, as I wear her cologne every day (you can get a good gift set for $30 at Target, BTW) and listen to \\"The Fame\\", \\"The Fame Monster\\" and \\"Born This Way\\" and their remixes _every_ time I go to the gym.<br /><br />But \\"Artpop\\"?  What a disappointment.  The lyrics are, for the most part, crap.  With a few exceptions, the music isn't catchy.  She has some foul-mouthed rappers show up to ruin a couple of songs completely.<br /><br />Just glad I got it on an mp3 and didn't pay more for a disc to be mailed to me.<br /><br />Please listen to these songs on YouTube first before committing to purchase.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|My Nieces loved this movie. I had never seen it so I have to watch it with them one day!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great way to kill time when my wife is watching her scrappy tv shows. Fun easy and worth t he download.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|This game is easy to use and fun to play. I would recommend it to friends/family...love my kindle and the free apps I have access to.
B00F880BWG|5.0|Season started off a little lame but it's gets a lot better.  I'm really enjoying this season now.  Great show.
B00EDCI5IU|5.0|A soothing CD with a beautiful voice.  The combination of her voice with the piano sections reminds me a little bit of Enya, of which I am also a big fan.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|The music,  the artwork,  the story--overall it is entertaining,  memorable,  and very pleasant.  Love it,  love it,  love it. Especially the unusual lyrics of the one vocal and the beautiful soundtrack throughout. This is a family favorite that we watch again and again.
0062073486|5.0|Ten strangers are invited to a large house on an island. They are each accused of murder by a recorded voice.  Then, one by one, they begin to be killed off in the fashion of a nursery rhyme.<br /><br />And Then There Were None is one of my favorite books ever. It is mysterious and suspenseful with a well-drawn plot. The ending also comes as a big surprise. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a good mystery.
B005OKTPKC|4.0|Great read. But took quite long to get into it and the lucrative settlement came very late in the book.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|It's a good game but: 1) They don't respond to problems encountered with software,  2) Will not u to input last couple of numbers called most times;screen locked, 3) May no recognize Bingos called in last 2-3 numbers even if screen allows input n last, heavily facebook dependent.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I first read this book before laptop computers and cell phones. I liked it then, I liked it now. Can't wait to see it in the theater, hoping they honored Orson Scott Card with a true and honest rendering of his work.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I have never read a book from this viewpoint before and it's a very unique and moving book. I will definitely see the movie
B002RTMXIY|5.0|its the nephiliam. I never believed in &#34;aliens&#34; but now...I still dont. But I believe these people. I believe in the bible. So...a man named L.A. Marzuli ...opened my mind to this..before God sent the flood there were fallen angels who wanted the beautiful women. they created a race called the nephiliam...they were giants and pure evil...well they were on the earth afterwards the bible says and...in the last days it will be as in the days of Noah...so they must play in somehow. Its them. People never say they were nice...look at that movie the fourth kind. its demons posing as aliens for the great deception coming soon..they are going to say &#34;Jesus was an alien...blah blah.&#34; you can think I'm a lunatic...take a number...but L.A. explains it all quite better...how awful to go through that. plus to not be believed. But it was an excellent movie.
B00ANY94A0|4.0|A bit small, but full of adorbs. Got it for my girfriend, who wishes we had a squirrel house in the yard. This will do for now.
B000OT8GCQ|4.0|I stopped reading Sparks after I watched the Nights in Rodanthe movie, which completely missed the entire point of the book. I had friends read/see the movie of Dear John and I went into it thinking I was going to bawl my eyes out and end up hating Savannah. Neither of those happened. While John and Savannah don't work out, they fell in love quickly and spent very little time together. I was a little sad they didn't end up together. I certainly wasn't upset with her. Life and love don't always go as planned. Part of her had loved Tim her entire life. I really did enjoy this book, mostly because it didn't affect me like it did others and my heart wasn't broken. John and Savannah are both wonderful people. I only got a little teary with John's relationship with his father. I think it's worth the read. But if you are overly emotional and want true love to always win, this isn't for you.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|this would have cost me 3 x on wusf public broadcasting and if I got to say more it's thanks
B00AEFYCDW|5.0|Beautiful film!!! Well-written and well-acted. And the soundtrack is superb!!! Of course, you can't lose with Eddie Vedder penning the tunes. Highly recommended for Human Beings.....
B007J4T2G8|3.0|The ending shocked me. I thought he would explain why he is the way he is to Ana she deserves more.
B0010SEMP0|5.0|One Foot in the Grave bk. 2 picks up right were Halfway to the Grave bk.1  ends on a cliffhanger. Cat has left Bones and its 5 years later. I must admit I didn't like the first half of the book. Cat is always fighting and killing vampire and she best them all but she is only half Vampire. That didn't make sense to me. I really don't like the way Cat is written. Their is nothing romantic or feminine about her. She is very Macho for a female even a military officer. Bones I love he and the others in the story is what makes this book a 5 star book The last half of the story more than makes up for the first half. We get to see a return of a character we fall in love with in bk1 and that just tipped the book to 5 stars for me. I also, came to believe that Cat loved Bones by the end of the book. Those two also have some very hot sexy love scenes.  WOW,HOT HOT HOT!!! I really enjoyed reading One Foot in the Grave and I know you will too. Just read bk.1 first Halfway to the Grave or it won't make a lot of sense!
B00DVZ414C|2.0|I suppose it was to be expected with the current popularity of zombies in popular culture that we would finally get a zombie musical.  At least that's what I assume this is considering how lifeless the performances on this soundtrack album are.  I loved the soundtrack of \\"O Brother\\", but with each new project since then I get the feeling that T Bone Burnett is determined to suck the life and soul out of America's music.  Yes, everything here is extremely well played and tasteful, but the end result gives me the same feeling I get when I see a well made up corpse at a wake.  Yea, every hair is in place and the make-up is exquisitely applied and the clothes are perfect, but none of that can change the fact that the spark of life is gone.  Like that corpse, this music is a comely shell with no soul.<br /><br />I grew up listening to the folk musicians of this era.  I love this music and I always look forward to a new twist, a new take on it.  I love hearing younger musicians taking the music and making it their own.  That's how the music stays alive and vital.  So I'm open to new interpretations by new people.  But this recording has nothing to say about the music. \\"A Mighty Wind\\" was a parody of this era and music and yet it's soundtrack comes much closer to catching the spirit of the real thing than anything on the \\"Inside Llewyn Davis\\" soundtrack does.<br /><br />Perhaps these performances work better in the context of the movie than they do standing on their own, but the best thing I can say for this bland soundtrack is that it will probably be quite serviceable as background muzak in your local branch of Starbucks and Whole Foods.
B00DYEN5QU|5.0|This is a fantastic film adaptation to DC's oldest Superhero. They did a super fine job putting this together. And I had no idea that Henry Cavill, who plays the leading role, is a Brit! This become evident on the DVD of Special Features. Very well-put-together package.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|KEEPS YOU BUSY AND CHALLENGES YOUR MIND.  ONLY THiNG I DO MOT LIKE IS THAT YOU HAVE TO SPEND MONEY IF YOU GET STUCK OR WAIT FOR THINGS TO REFRESH.
B00821OX98|5.0|Very entertaining.  Easy to access and very convenient for viewing from home.  Would recommend to family and friends.  Thank you.
B00DIJ49UW|5.0|Since getting this score.  I have actually lost count as to how many times it's played.  Greats ideas...  catchy theme...  and, some very exciting action scoring.  The composer has always run hot and cold with me...  PACIFIC RIM is superb.<br /><br />Might want to check out his score releases for GAMES OF THRONES...  PRISON BREAK and the remake of RED DAWN.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Hans Zimmer, Steve Jablonsky, Nick Glennie-Smith, John Powell or Harry Gregson-Williams...  you will love this score.  If not...  give it a chance.<br /><br />Definitely a highpoint for this year.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game  is so fun  my only concern is  is that it takes a while to loaded up but  it's worth it my little cousin loves this game and its free
B00FVVR2ZO|4.0|This game is a great idea. I'm a fan of all hidden object games and especially ones that have a great twist like Alice in wonderland
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This book is written from a reporter's perspective.  Alternative disease, survival, zombie adventures give the reader a multicultural thriller to ponder.
B00003CXRM|4.0|Good movie. Really funny in parts. I like that fact George was not sing the song that everyone thought he was.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Sure,the book was amazing! But did tris really have to die? Did u really have to make me Abel my eyeballs out?<br /><br />Anyways it was still a great series
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I love apocalyptic novels, just to see how people manage to survive,  There is a twist on this one that takes it to another level where the characters must live in a world they did not create and really have no idea about who or how or why!  I went ahead and read the other books in the series, Shift and Dust.  I enjoyed them just as much and it was a very satisfying series.
B00881VLCE|1.0|It does not really work on my Kindle and there is no instructions or useful &#34;help&#34; buttons. I would like it off my Kindle.
B00005JLIU|3.0|Because it was a gift for my mother. I did not watch it. I heard it was what she wanted.
0811870413|5.0|This is a clear explanation of how to create wonderful sourdough bread.  It has great pictures to explain the process.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This one of the best products in a looooonnnnnggggg time that actually lived up to the hype.  Quick and easy to install!  Absolutely the product I've been searching for the past 2 years to get off the cable rip off wagon!!  Thanks Google!!!
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|An amazing tale of hate and bonding, insecurities and confidence, growing up and getting old, life and death, and the eternal bonds between women. A story born of a society that does it's best to suppress women and their rights, this story reveals and raises the beauty of all women even in remote villages in the middle east. I experienced many joys and sorrows reading this book and loved every minute of it. I devoured the book in three days. Cannot recommend it enough.
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|Love this movie ... takes me back to when I was a kid and the love I had for giant monster movies.  And the effects ... the monsters truly look GIGANTIC!
B00FRN2QZM|5.0|AFI delivers time and time again with profound lyrics and moving instrumentals and showcases, along with, of course, Davey's phenomenal vocals.  I have yet to be disappointed with their thoughtful, creative work.  I love AFI, and this album confirms why.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Great looking graphics and easy to play at first to get the hang of it. Good variety of guns and game.
B00FHATBGW|4.0|Fun game with just the right amount of hints if you play advanced mode... the only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because to me, &quot;the room&quot; is 5 and its just not quite as good... but worth the 2.99 for sure!  Big fish hasn't disappointed me yet!
0062107313|3.0|It seems as though Amy Tan is wanting to return to her \\"roots\\" in exploring mother-daughter issues and the ways of life in a world left for a better one. This is a theme Ms. Tan has explored and at times, beautifully. But as best the intentions are in returning these themes, it's re-hashed.<br /><br />And there's a spark missing. Maybe too many books for Ms. Tan. I so enjoyed that very first novel, and I enjoyed THE BONE-SETTER'S DAUGHTER, but this is a disappointment. Can't totally diss it, but it's the spark that's missing. Some have pointed out this author's \\"dry humor\\" well, there's  some of that, but not enough. I wish authors would lighten it up more.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|Keeps getting better each season.  Wonderful acting and interesting stories.  I've been watching the episodes on my Kindle Fire, a great way to make &#34;The Good Wife&#34; portable.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Never thought it would end that way in the arena. My 10 year old son was right - I did love it!
0385523912|5.0|It validated other books and reports I have read on life in No Korea. It is hard to understand how people can live under such atrocious conditions but the Author manages to give the narrative a personal feel. The stories of life under the Kim dictatorships is so harsh the average American would think these reports are made up. Surely, this can't be true. Unfortunately it is. I also recommend reading &#34;The Orphan Master's Son&#34;.
B00CNQ7CRI|5.0|Funny and touching! Great characters. Is there going to be a movie? Bridget Jones is one great girl!Loved it a lot.
B002DEZXOE|4.0|best event, best documentary,  ahh to have been there must of been amazing!, amazing music, people, vibe. no one died and some births too
055358202X|5.0|I love this series! Book one is very much in line with the tv show and will keep you on the edge of your seat even if you know what is about to happen! I am one of those people who always plans to read the book first, but never quite get around to it before I am already into the show or movie. These books will not disappoint even if you are already watching the show.
B009NY43NY|5.0|it is refreshing to have a good happy ending, some sexual fireworks, and non-twilight vampires and werewolves. Go team Sookie.
B00DOPEGAS|5.0|This is exactly what I ordered for my niece.  It was here in no time and I know that she will love it for Christmas
B00A2DIW3C|5.0|I could not put this book down! Great read, I cant beleieve its been out for many years and i missed it......wonderful memoir of the greatest years for the Skunk Works!
034544678X|5.0|I have read and re-read this book. I was just getting into dog rescue when I bought it, and I have referenced it multiple times since. Such good info if you are a dog lover and want to get to the next level with understanding canine behavior. Explains why dogs don't appreciate human hugs and much more!
B00CGNYDIE|5.0|Didn't think I'd like this type of puzzle, but  it it surprised me. I was looking for something to waste time with that lasts longer than Zyan Drench and this is great. The puzzles are challenging but not ridiculously so, and the pictures are nice to look at. I would recommend this game over many of the other puzzle picture type games on the market.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I've read most of John Grisham's stories and love them all. my first was the firm and this story grabbed me just like that one did and I couldn't put it down. This is many years later too. Well done!
B00AZMFK3K|3.0|I give it 3 but my kids give it a 4 1/2. Thats because they did grow up with it and watch the series or the movie with the original crew.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Keeps you guessing even if you know the plot! I am already into the tv series, and have been reading other things and not keeping up with the books. This book is very much in line with the show, but you will enjoy the extra detail that only a novel can provide. Buy and enjoy!
B004VMUS9G|3.0|I haven't had the opportunity to use this app a lot, but when I have, I am always conserned that I have done it wrong.  Not as simple as I would have liked.  How hard is it to just have a button that you enter the time you want to wake up and it synchs to your phone clock.  Honestly, because I'm paranoid about being late for anything, I tend to have a back up that goes off first, and I don't recall having this one go off as I usually shut it off before it can.  I ahould test it on a few days when I don't have any pressing matters.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|I thought the movie was about a plane that was flying based on the title. However, on a deeper level Flight is about a man's life. Good movie, recommend it.
0399157573|5.0|Pete back with the police. Back to the old days. Hard to put down once you start reading the book.<br />But what is wrong with Benson, if he spoke up sooner about what he knew alot of killing would have<br />never happened. But guess thats Benson being Benson. Still waiting for Pete to get into the sceens more.<br />Fans won't be disappointed and will be waiting for more.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|free storage=5 stars, simple from amazon . com and I can only say I expect this as a service due to the cloud being there.  Any storage should be ongoing if paid for once, not yearly.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Love this app.  Direct link to my email.  No fuss, no mess, just easy to use.  I can easily brows all my folders, send email and move things around.  One of the many reasons that I have never changed my yahoo account.  They have always delivered a superior product.
B00D660M6M|5.0|I was not will to pay $17.99 for the import version. I was very willing to buy the US version. This young man is very talented. He has a great voice, plays an excellent piano and writes good music. Billy Joel and Elton John have younger company now.
B008JFUPK8|3.0|What a waste of money. Why can't they (DC Comics) just do a new movie of Superman.<br />Screwed up the story to boot for money. Maybe just maybe the movie would have<br />been better at least more people would have gone to see it in the movies if you<br />would have used the Smallville cast.  I hope Ben Affleck can do a Batman worth seeing<br />in the movies. Only part I enjoyed was were Sups broke the neck of Zod.<br />Now that was my take but I grew up reading the comics. My kids thought it was okay.
1936608898|5.0|You can do the Whole30 without buying the book, but I found it very helpful to be able to read the science behind the plan, and it had some great recipes.  I lost 9lbs the first month! And have lost a total of 26lbs since starting.  More importantly, I feel SOOO much better - more energy, no headaches, fewer allergies.  What a difference!  I have made this way of eating a way of life now.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|Honestly, this is quite possibly the brightest camera flashlight I have ever had, I don't know if it's the LED, or the app.  But it's bright as hell.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Whoever created The New Oxford American Dictionary, I say thank you. If it wasn't for you guys, I wouldn't be the great speller that I am today. No wait. I don't need a dictionary. I'm the best speller in my school. Anyway, thank you. I may not always need a dictionary for spelling, but I do on occasion. Anyway, thank you and God bless.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|the ad fools you.you need to attach more wires to this to work and I had to send it back .At the round end you have to attach wires to go to electric.I thought it was wireless as every picture I looked at had none which is why I was buying it. have too many wires now.So I cannot really tell you how it works
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun&amp; addicting. only problem I have is not being able yo use my extra moves on my kindle fire. Only online
B003JUGQ38|4.0|The tragic super hero continues his adventures with a new companion.  How the writers continue to develop compelling scripts from the simple and comical to the full si-fi experience keep you wanting more Doctor
B004U8VUUC|4.0|Because I thought the story was compelling and the acting superb; also the surprise though terribly sad ending.<br /><br />Sorry Im sick and have no more words!
B005LAIHY0|1.0|Dumb,ridiculous, AWFUL movie. I don't know WTF Ridley was thinking with this mess. Asinine plot, moronic chars. Ignore this film as it does not have any place in the Alien series. One of the worst prequels ever made and all around crap movie. Pretentious people act like it's a great film and only people who &#34;don't get it&#34; dislike it. Trust me, I get it.It's a pos film. Hearing about the numerous defective discs makes me laugh even more. The movie is so bad your players don't even want to play it. They think it sucks too.<br /><br />Ridley should have gone with his original script from years ago. This was a terrible idea all around. Save your money and avoid.<br />You'll regret it if you don't.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Followed first 2 books well.  Some suspense as to ending and Katniss relationship with her 2 beaus.  Easy to relate to characters.
B004X2M3N8|5.0|This season went into more of a modern sci-fi direction.  From my limited Doctor experience the anti sci-fi simplicity was always attractive.  The realization that this is a modern day Doctor and how it has to relate to the world today for the viewer shows the continued genius of the show.  Oh yea, and Amy is hot!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Good for kids and fun fun fun again great for kids and mom and dad I<br />Like it and so will you
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The chromcast was simple to setup and works excellent. Also was able to cast from my windows vista with a little reaseach online.
0812982622|3.0|Odd book, a very interesting storyline and captivating character. Its just a struggle to finish, definitely not a light read. Gives us a glimpse into the elusive country that is North Korea.
B003G94BZC|5.0|Character development.  He happy go lucky Doctor is a tragic hero.  The story weaves through time and space and anything is possible because time travel is possible.  Bits from past and future episodes weave their way through the story and the hook is the unanswered questions that await the next episode.
B00BXKKNFS|2.0|It works fine but I started to get issues with any apps that used Wifi so I quickly uninstalled it. If you really need Adblock I'd say just be careful with this.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I just started this game likes than a week ago and it is so much fun!! I also got v my husband hooked on it too! It keep me entertained during middle of the night feeding with my daughter :) so glad I decided to start playing
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This game keeps me entertained for hours.  I find myself losing chunks of time often.  I highly recommend it. Apparently that wasn't enough so I have to keep writing until I reach the minimum requirement.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|What's the big deal about candy crush ever played bejewled and like a hundred other games it's boring and I don't get what people find so addicting about it
B0029LCJJS|3.0|Choppy video. Good storyline.  Good effects - great for falling asleep to even if you do not have insomnia. Good storyline for the most part
B004I744AS|4.0|This dictionary is fun to read information on the front page. The dictionary itself is not the most comprehensive but is really good for free.
B00B4Z5GDQ|3.0|this was a decent watch up until he buys the neve console and starts recording music with people at the end. That part seems completely like an ego stroke session
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I HAVE LIKED THIS GAME SINCE I HAD THE HOLE THING!!!!!!!!!!!!!LOVE.LOVE.LOVE IT IS AWESOMENESS SO COOL LOVE ITS SO COOL
B003JVL7MC|5.0|The video is excellent.<br />Good sound quality.<br />I recommend it to all my friends.<br />Thanks amazon prime instant video for their service.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Clancy and Greaney carried the Jack Ryan Jr. series to new heights. Threat Vector starts out quickly and delivers action from beginning to end. The depth of characters, extreme level of details and interconnected story lines one has come to expect from Clancy were all prevalent. Eagerly anticipating the last piece of an American classic series by one of the best authors of our time.
034580404X|4.0|This trilogy was good if you want a play play storyline. It seemed a little bit too realistic to believe between Eva and Gideon. What millionaire you know doesn't have a pre-nup? I don't want to see this as a movie because it will be cut so bad that you won't get the full effect like the book. A movie in theatre will only show so much.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Great game. I've never played it on Facebook but I do like how I can play it on my kindle. I hope other Facebook games come to kindle as well

B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I have been waiting to play Zynga apps on the kindle. This game demonstrates why. Easy to start. Easy to play. Love it!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a fun and challenging game, especially for a freebie.  I like the progression of difficulty  and use it as a brain game.
B00GIZO674|5.0|By the looks of the game i thought it was going to be stupid but i was so wrong it was amazing and i love it! You need to get this game, its awesome!
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Great writing!! The storyline keeps you on the edge of your seat with anticipation. So much more than a &#34;Zombie&#34; show!
1401922732|5.0|Beautiful deck of oracle cards. Receiving great messages from Archangel Michael. One of my favorite oracle cards. You will love it too.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|I enjoyed this movie. Lots of action, and Daniel Craig played a vulnerable Bond. Good plot twists. I don't enjoy violence but I was ok with this one.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|its very addictive and fun. The game makes have to think very quickly and make fast decision its fun for the entire family.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thank you Amazon for feeding my addiction. I was going to get a tablet for Christmas just to have access to this game, now I may just up grade my Kindle!
B00C5R7B0I|4.0|Once the story gets started, it is a page turner. I am a fan of Patricia Cornwell, especially the Scarpetta series so I didn't need all the chapters of background  to know who was who and how the characters fit together. In true Cornwell fashion, once the story began to unfold, the events did not stop, and I could not put the book down.
B003GQM52Q|4.0|Wyatt Earp gave a good look at how difficult life was in our country's past.  Life was a struggle for many just trying to survive.  The movie was well done but seemed to drag on at times.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app the price is amazing it is like having a real horse. This app is for everyone. It does cost real money to buy most items from the market but it is worth it.
B00C7JGDBW|2.0|We paid new price but the DVD was clearly used.  It was scratched and froze multiple times the first time we watched it.  I will not purchase from this seller again.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I am determined to return to Italy next spring with a working knowledge of Italian.  This app makes the process really fun.  Way better than a textbook.
B004LROUNG|3.0|Book ended ok but was difficult to get into for first half. Not up to typical Grisham standards. Maybe I was expecting too much.
B000N5F6OW|4.0|Classic old school John Wayne... great footage of Africa! Long before the days where CGI did all the hard stuff...this is live and REAL in Africa...
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Read this book, then exhale.  This is a softer, more lyrical Khaled Hosseini but still with his wonderful ability to tell an excellent story.  We are taken through multiple countries and different decades, with characters that are all linked in various ways.  What a great book.
B000BVMAJ2|5.0|Lego Duplos are some of the best toys out there for kids 2-6.  My kids love these toys and play with them daily.  The zoo sets are perfect for boys and girls alike.  The big blocks are easy for little fingers and the pieces are too big to swallow.  My kids are now old enough to transition to the traditional lego sets with small pieces, but they still love playing with these Duplo sets.
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|Interesting and different, couldn't put it down. Looking forward to reading the other books by this author. Enjoyed the gift edition
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|An outstanding read! It grabs you and doesn't, let go. So I have to write ten more words. I don,t normally write reviews but this book demanded one.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|What a clever book.  This is by far the best epilogue I've ever read!!  The character's draw you in and keep you wanting to know more and more.  You are told the &#34;secret&#34; early on, but the twists and turns are definitely intriguing.  A fun read.
0394826817|5.0|Richard Scarry is one of the best children's author's of all time. This book illustrates his creativity and passion for story telling.  The thing I love about his work is the detail he puts into every page.  My children absolutely love his stories and often find new things every time we read this story.  I grew up with Richard Scarry books and my kids love them as much as I do.  His stories always have a great moral message and his illustrations will intrigue you night after night.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love  this show, Maggie Smith is great.  Can't wait for January when the next season begins. It is my favorite show
B008P1EWIM|5.0|This is a great app for my Kindle Fire!  So far I find it to be accurate for my area.
0793542049|5.0|Got this to help My Wife who is coming along nicly learning to play the Bass. A very helpful book and I can hear Her improvement.
B00ANY7V8M|5.0|My seven year old daughter loves these Lego Friends toys.  She spends hours building and rebuilding the houses for the animals.  My five year old son likes playing with them as well.  These little packs make great stocking stuffers or small rewards for chores.  As with all Legos, the small parts are easily lost and often found when you are walking in bare feet.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Super additive! I don't like waiting for tickets, waiting for a life is fine. People get annoyed asking for tickets. If we could start out with so many lives (10) and so many tickets (12) that would make it user friendly.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Very interesting and entertaining game but you must rate at level 10 to remain free. Good otherwise. If you no longer enjoy it then simply delete it...lol
B00DB2JQ7W|5.0|What can I say.... It the Mule... with Warren Haynes. Some real Kick A#$ Music no Doubt !!!!!!! Get it !!!!!

B00G32TD98|5.0|Enjoyed this one.  Have watched many of these types of movies but this one was more believable and made really well.  Great cast made it easy to watch front to back, always wanting to see more.  The story line connected to real-life experiences with the Warren's was what made me want to watch it in the first place. It kept moving and didn't stall out in the middle.  A great watch.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|could barely break away from the show,  watched it pretty much consistently until finished.  Great acting and story line, terrific
B001BKG9RQ|5.0|It's Pink Floyd !!!!!! I have to say so many words so.... This ( like everything PF does ) is FANTASTIC !!!!! If You can score the DVD, it's worth every penny......
B008Y212PI|5.0|Love this game! Really like not having to be a Facebook user. Graphics are pretty. I can play a little bit at a time or play a lot and not get bored.
0440246008|5.0|One of my favorite authors. Lee Child can really tell a tale. Jack Reacher is a very talented man, a modern-day Robin Hood, you might say; working for justice as he travels the US.
B00DMK6WN4|5.0|Our whole family loves this movie.  We saw it in the theater and have watched it 4 or 5 times since.  I think it is better than Moster's Inc.  We have a 9 year old boy, 7 year old girl, and 18 month old boy (he probably doesn't count though).  My husband and I both love it along with the kids.<br /><br />I am usually not a fan of prequels.  But, this movie hits the mark on all levels!!  I would say that you don't have to see Monster's Inc to enjoy this, but it does help to get some of the jokes and things.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|You only understand if you have been there. If you haven't you judge it as an abuse story, if you have you see it clearly.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Incredibly moving and motivating at the same time. I'd encourage all the brash Type A's out there to read this book, then stop talking and start listening to the brilliant thinkers around you. Quality of action from introverts is way better than quantity of actions from the extroverts.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|This film, while based on an incredible true story, takes many liberties that cause it to not come remotely close to a documentary-like portrayal of these historic events.  However, this is an amazing piece of film-making that is totally worth watching over and over again (I've already watched it twice since getting this DVD a week ago.)  And the film is accurate enough to get me interested in researching the whole Canadian Caper.  Whether this picture would motivate you to be studious like that or not is ultimately irrelevant.  I am recommending this DVD because the story is inspiring and the film is amazing...it totally earned that Best Picture Oscar, especially considering its stiff competition.  Enjoy.
0812968255|5.0|I bought this book as a gift and haven't read it myself yet, but just skimming through it looks as thought I will want to borrow it right back.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|An exciting Christmas movie that your children and you are sure to enjoy and make a tradition of watching it during the holidays. :)
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Felt the explanation of why folks were divergent was disappointing, although I found the ending to be realistic and not sugar coated.
B008JDAC7G|1.0|I have the free version of this app on my android phone so I wanted to try it out on my kindle. I was already a little disappointed when I saw that it wasn't free here but I decided to get it anyways. I purchased the app and tried to open it and it tells me that I don't own the content?? I pressed the button that popped up that said see more details and it took me back to the description and the option there was &quot;open&quot; not buy. Still didn't let me in. No idea what's happening but I'm very disappointed.
B00BUOOVH8|5.0|This is a copy of my UK review.<br />Amazon have put the wrong title here, &#34;Big Brother & The Holding Company&#34;, which is a single CD, even the mp3 link is to that single album.<br />What you should have here according to the track listing is &#34;Box Of Pearls&#34; which has all 4 studio albums issued by Janis Joplin, (Big Brother & The Holding Company + Pearl + Cheap Thrills + I Got Dem Ol' Kozmic Blues Again Mama! ) with a bonus CD of rarities, so 5 CD's in total and 55 tracks.<br />To make matters more complicated, there is more than one issue of this box set, some very expensive, even 5x more expensive, strange but true, but all seem identical apart from minor packaging differences and year or place of issue.<br />Anyway, getting back to what should be a 5 CD box set, it can represent excellent value for money, (Amazon do not allow prices to be mentioned in reviews) and it is an easy way to buy a huge amount of her small output, coupled with decent presentation and booklet, plus the sound is digitally remastered and cleaned up.<br />It certainly can work out cheaper than buying all 4 individual albums, plus you get the rare takes etc.<br />If you want one box set only of JJ, then this is about as good as it gets and is currently quite a bargain.<br />I own &#34;Janis&#34; by Janis Joplin, a 3 CD box set with almost as many tracks, 49 against 55, sadly as it is out of production and so it is usually very expensive, even in used condition. It has many similar tracks but more rarities.<br />I highly recommend either but if you want a single CD and cheaper alternative, buy &#34;18 Essential Songs.&#34;<br />PS Be careful reading other reviews as Amazon has the ridiculous policy of putting reviews against any similar album, so some reviews here refer to a single CD issue, not a 5 CD box set. Reviews on Amazon are often in a mess due to this policy, I have even seen reviews for the wrong artist because the album titles have been the same, eg &#34;20 Best Of&#34; etc.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|for me there are never any porn ads never any adds in general except for when I first open up the app and it gives you many options to listen to a videos audio watch it many different definitions or download it and watch it later
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Great book.  If you have seen the movie then go into this book knowing the only similarity to the movie is the title.  Really enjoyed this book and the premise behind it.  The story line about zombies and how societies dealt with them was very realistic.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is quite challenging and addictive.  I find it hard to get away from it.  When I run out of lives, I can't wait to get started again.  It's fun to track the progress of my friends.  There are too many levels, it's never ending.  Glad I chose to start playing.
B006FO3ERQ|4.0|Haunting and empty is how this book made me feel.  The main character has somewhat raised  himself up from horrific circumstances.  Though well written, it goes on and on, I wanted more uplift.  There was a lack of affect that was disturbing.
B00FQPHA0M|5.0|Action packed. Very impressed how they put this movie together. Loved everything about this movie we can't stop watching it
B007IXWKUK|5.0|OUTSTANDING I wish she had more books in the series.  She did a Fantasy job on all three books.  It is a must read.
B00E9A656K|4.0|This game is great but, wastes money. You have to race people that you are already racing. Every time you race against a person that is the same he always makes a faster time. WITH THAT THE GAME IS AMAZING.
193700788X|2.0|This book, like the others before it, failed to live up to it's wonderful beginning. I loved the original character of Sookie, who was sweet, funny and enormously interesting.  But after the fourth book (which was the best in the entire series), it kind of petered out. It felt as if Ms. Harris had a contract to fulfill and didn't have much more to offer, so she threw whatever came into her head down on paper - a lot of which didn't make sense and didn't match earlier events.<br /><br />I wish all the books in the series were as good as the first four, but unfortunately, they don't.  Dead Ever After was a huge disappointment.
B00BZAJMWG|5.0|This movie was very interesting and it makes you think about why people do and act they way they do which is very common in real life I really enjoyed this movie.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|it is the best game I ever played in my childhood life .I cant wait to play it. the characters actions are super cute.beeeeeeest game ever
B00FVVR2ZO|3.0|I have a quest to visit a friend's place but, then when I click on it it says my friend has updated and I need to but, I have no update.
B004DEW9L2|2.0|I watched it for a class in school. I didn't care for it, but it was not terrible. However, it was made with the help of the famous surrealist Salvador Dali
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|LISTEN THIS GAME IS AWESOME BUT ITS A little HARD U NEED TO UPGRADE ALL THE TIME TO BEAT OTHER ROBOTS
B0010T0OCY|1.0|Classic cult-classic terrible movie from the 90's.  Had potential, very dark, but Kiefer's voice almost solely kills the film, topped off with hammy acting and poorly executed antagonists.  It's a classic, for being so horribly, horribly wrong and terrible.  And, amazing.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|I have always enjoyed John Grisham's writing style---until this one.  Many story lines were not developed...just left hanging (no pun intended).  Many typos in this book... Unusual for a Grisham book.  Made me think this one was written and edited in a hurry to get to the printer.  Overall, very disappointed.
B00CKH9WOQ|5.0|I am very happy!My kids love to play with these toys!Correspond to its description!High-quality, bright, well done! And in the future, I plan to buy toys for their children here!
B008CJ0JTI|5.0|Please note: This review is for the Criterion Blu-ray of \\"The Game\\" and, if you are reading it under another listing, it's because Amazon has combined reviews.<br /><br />David Fincher's \\"The Game\\" takes us and the main character the cold, aloof and wealthy Nicholas Van Orten (Michael Douglas) on a Hitchcockian thrill ride. Van Orten finds his structured, well manicured life suddenly very messy and unpredictable after he is given an unusual gift by his brother Conrad (Sean Penn)for his birthday. Conrad hands him a card with a phone number that, when Van Orten calls it, pulls him into a live action game where his life is threatened and his whole life is turned upside down, inside out.<br /><br />That isn't to say that \\"The Game\\" is perfect. Watching the film for the first time, you'll get caught up in trying to put together the puzzle. Is Van Orten's life in danger? Are those around him to be trusted? On later viewings, you'll discover that there are flaws in the plot but you can at least enjoy the ride. (especially if you can suspend your disbelief)<br /><br />The Criterion edition of this well regarded thriller boasts a beautifully rendered transfer. Personally supervised by director of photography Harris Sevides and approved by director Fincher. Detail is remarkably sharp throughout and there's no noticeable visual imperfections.<br /><br />The audio presentation is quite good with two tracks--the former a Theatrical DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track and a Near Field DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track. The latter is carried over from the original laserdisc that Criterion did back in the day which was designed with a home theater sound system in mind.<br /><br />As with all Criterion editions we get some terrific special features many of them are carried over from the original laserdisc that was released over fifteen years ago. The commentary track features the director Fincher, star Michael Douglas, writers John Brancato  (recorded together)and Michael Ferris, DP Savides, production designer Jeffrey Beecroft and visual effects supervisor Kevin Haug.<br /><br />Fincher's alternate ending is also presented (and is in its complete, raw form--including the slate at the beginning of the take).<br /><br />We also get four sequences that compare storyboards to the finished film presented split screen. These four sequences are also presented again (without the split screen comparison) with optional commentary with behind-the-scenes footage. The uncut psychological visual \\"test\\" that Van Orten is given is presented in full (it is, however, presented without a commentary or any soundtrack for that matter).<br /><br />Finally the last extras include the teaser trailer, and full trailer are presented with an optional commentary track.  As with all Criterion titles we get a booklet with an essay. I found the booklet to be less extensive than many other titles and the insights fall into two categories--quite good and quite a stretch categories.<br /><br />My only complaint about this set is that we don't anything new in the way of special features. It would be nice to have a discussion with those who made the film looking at it again 16 years after the original release of the film.<br /><br />\\"The Game\\" receives a top notch high definition transfer as well as including the special features from the original laserdisc release.production designer Jeffrey Beecroft and visual effects supervisor Kevin Haug.<br /><br />Fincher's alternate ending is also presented (and is in its complete, raw form--including the slate at the beginning of the take).<br /><br />We also get four sequences that compare storyboards to the finished film presented split screen.

B000SGGUWS|5.0|Loved this book it was a great read! Really loved Sara Shepards ability to keep the readers attention (: :
B00COHAUD4|2.0|I guess I expected more.  I thought it would be more scary or more in depth or more something. I expected more the creator of Pan's Labryinth which was brilliant to me.  The movie wasn't horrible but it wasn't great either. Just wanted more.
B002FQOI0A|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much although I did get quite confused with the time travel stuff. Also I just wanted to say that you can miss someone you've never met, you can miss them very much.
B00G32OER4|3.0|My guests for our movie night wanted to watch this and at that time I could not rent it, so I was forced to buy it. Don't!  It is a typical formula horror movie that uses the element of surprise as its main scare tactic. The idea that it is based on &#34;real&#34; events is its draw, but how much of the stunts, and special effects shown were part of the original case is highly questionable. The retro shots of the original paranormal investigators who are portrayed in the film are nice, but there was a lot about them I found disturbing. Do you really want to keep a room full of cursed objects in your HOME...with a child present??? And without including any spoilers, I found the wife's behavior, in light of what happens near the end, highly questionable.
B00BSBR9N6|4.0|I did enjoy the book for the &#34;opposites attract&#34; approach to relationships, especially since I'm the beneficiary of such a relationship of 35 years.  However, I don't know enough about Asperger's or the struggles &#34;Aspees&#34; face, but I fear this book may oversimplify it.  Don really brings to mind &#34;Sheldon&#34; of Big Bang fame.  I guess the bottom line for me is that I liked it because it is positive and hopeful.  I will definitely buy the next book that continues the story.
0783240236|3.0|Disappointed with the &#34;deleted scene&#34; and &#34;alternate ending&#34;.  These appear in the DVD extras. Both are nothing more than photos of a script (as in, photos of the typewritten pages).  The &#34;alternate ending&#34; also includes a single drawing for the storyboard.  Neither scene was shot.  It is apparent this fact omitted from the advertising of the DVD, and even omitted from the menu of extras, in order to give the appearance that the DVD includes slightly more than it actually does.  This is a reflection of the producers of the DVD and not a reflection of the movie itself.
B000SFD21Q|4.0|I thought this book did a great job of giving some specific examples of how exercise impacts the brain and mental health.  I gave it 4 stars for all of the science of the brain that was discussed at the beginning of the book.  I was slightly concerned this would prevail throughout the book.  After that passed, I thought it was easy reading.  Great motivation to keep up or begin any exercise.
B007Q476KU|4.0|Gorgeous cinematography! This whole film is like a feast for the eyes. The plot is a little Disneyish, but it's so movingly played out that you won't even notice.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Defiantly a game to get caught up in and let time waste away.. Though some levels seems endless and mind boggling.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|The download leads you to believe it's free.  Fun but tiresome.  Too much waiting for lives or new levels.  Or just &quot; pay your way&quot; through.
B000AGTPUU|4.0|Can't rate it higher than than this because I have never watched it ...I purchased for a friend. It was in very good packaging and had a personal note from the seller that was very nice. it arrived before it was supposed to. I am satisfied.
B00F880BWG|5.0|It seems like our heroes have found a safe haven, for now. Unfortunately, they soon learn that in this new world, no one is ever truly safe.  The body count is getting higher, and the group faces threats from within, as well as without.  The walkers never stop coming, so if you like zombie killing, you will not be disappointed.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Very realistic very educational!!!! Kinda boring at times but can be fun also but I would recommend it for 10 year olds
B00FFL8ZMY|4.0|Another solid effort from Alter Bridge. From start to finish the album is a winner. It's more of a mix between their second album Blackbird and their third album ABIII (still my all-time favorite). But is as good an album as you will see by virtually any band these days. Not quite as good as ABIII, but Alter Bridge doesn't disappoint.
B007QA3AH2|4.0|Lots of great reviews that are much better than anything that I could add. Just wanted to be able to give this excellent movie some well deserved stars.
B006M7JCC2|4.0|This is a simply told account of a remarkable recovery following a near death experience (NDE). Moorjani is not a natural writer, but her message is sincere and her is story important. Spontaneous recovery from terminal illness, although uncommon, is not unheard of. The more we understand about the causes of illness and recovery, the more potential there is for avoidance of illness in the first place, and for the healing of illness once it has occurred. Furthermore, while accounts of NDEs are fairly numerous (if you go looking), most  people who have a brush with death like Anita do not remember well (if at all) what they experienced while &#34;on the other side&#34;. This is an easy and worthwhile read for anyone interested in healing and/or the near death experience.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is top notch with all the bells and whistles. Accurate forcasts, no pun, specific radar, local temps and weather alerts. I am sold.
B00G32OER4|5.0|Really good movie.  I have not enjoyed a scary movie as much as this one in quite some time.  If you really want to get the full effect you should look up the information about the true story behind it.  Gives me chills just thinking about it. I especially loved the quote at the end.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|My sister recommended this series and I was hooked three pages in to Divergent. I plowed right through it and loved it. Same for Insurgent. I had such high hopes for Allegiant. I jumped in to this book as quickly as a Dauntless jumps on to a train. Oh man was I disappointed. It starts off okay but it ends up being more of the same. I won't put any spoilers in here but suffice to say I just felt empty and disappointed.<br />The first two books were so good but this one felt like the author had run out of ideas and had to throw in the big shocker at the end to try to save it. I have several other people reading this series now an  I almost feel bad about it because Allegiant disappoints.
B008KNUKVI|5.0|Great album. Should be part of any collection. Pentatonix does a great job with their arrangements of a variety of songs. If you like a cappella music, you won't be disappointed.
B000002UAO|5.0|Classic album by my favorite 70's band. Happy to find a replacement for my collection. Good music never gets old!
B005ZB91KY|5.0|For an action movie it had a believable love story. Plus the continued &#34;Super Soldier&#34; plot line that each country wants.
B000VIK8D0|4.0|I like Costner, and westerns especially Wyatt Earp, but I have seen better casting and script in Hour of the Gun, and especially Tombstone is far more entertaining
B0055MBQOM|3.0|Lenovo Z580 with Intel graphics & i5 CPU, LED backlit display.<br />Computer geek and well-read on color management and calibration.<br /><br />Intel driver settings were at full default, all color calibrations done through Windows Color Management Calibration software removed from the c:\windows\system32\... directory and system reboot and verified at stock prior to installing and running this.<br /><br />Installed the driver, plugged in the ColorMunki Display, ran through the basic calibration at 6500k (matching color temp of HDTV), gamma 2.2, no auto ambient compensation. Brightness set at 2nd down from max (about 130 lux or whatever it was measuring vs. ideal of 120. 3rd down from max would have been about 102.).<br /><br />As I've seen before, the display went 'warm' - which means everything has a yellow/orange hue to it. This mis-calibration has occured before using other 'monitor calibration' hardware on other systems/monitors, so it wasn't a big surprise (but no idea as to why some hardware combos calibrate nicely; others don't). Definitely nowhere near accurate - even next to a Photodisc test target printed and viewed under high CRI lamps, not even close to matching the print.<br /><br />Took everything out. Sat the computer next to an IPS Panasonic TV (I'm trying to calibrate for video, so obviously, all modern HDTVs are calibrated to match the 6500k Rec709 standard, though most require some added calibration and tweaks for the very best accuracy). Hooked up a Hauppage WinTV950 to the laptop. Set both on the same HD TV channel. Ran through the Windows Color Calibration by hand, didn't touch gamma or brightness (at 2nd down from brightest), Adjusted the blue channel until the grays and faces matched. Yes, things were 'warmer' than default (too cold/blue), but nowhere as bad as the ColorMunki calibration.<br /><br />Videos and photos (Photodisc test target) now both look very realistic and accurate (vs. Photodisc test target especially, but matching the HDTV quite well despite the smaller color gamut of the Z580's TN screen). Far better than what the Munki achieved.<br /><br />Is this broadcast Rec709/6500k accurate? Keep in mind the problems here. The IPS panel likely displays close to or at least the full Rec709 color space - the TN panel on the Z580 is likely going to display 50-70% at best. Even after 'perfect' calibration, the TN panel will still not 'look just like' the ideal Rec709 color space monitor since many of the colors can't even be displayed on the TN panel. However, the eye is very good at distinguishing minor color differences across a wide range of video material when both are side by side, so hand-calibrating the TN panel against the IPS TV will put the Z580 at a 'decent' starting point for viewing and editing videos without spending $$$ (which would actually require one to buy at least the Y580 which has an IPS panel with larger color gamut). Additionally, the Rec709 is for most intents, same as the sRGB space, so when comparing the monitor against a printed Photodisc test target, if both match well in addition to the TV, then the eyeballed calibration is pretty 'good' for the basics of video editing.<br /><br />The Z580 is running a touch unsaturated at the default calibration done this way, so a +5 Saturation in the Intel drivers bring back a bit of the 'pop' one expects, especially when watching movies like Star Trek Into Darkness.<br /><br />Is the Colormunki good for anything? Not sure - didn't do it out of the box here, and there's no point tweaking and going through zillions of trials just to get a 'better' calibration. One simply doesn't know even with all that tweaking done is the calibration 'accurate' against what we're trying to target? Didn't match the Photodisc test target printed as accurately as eyeballing the calibration through Windows, and definitely things look at whole lot better with the latter than using the Colormunki profile. (eg. even playing a slew of videos from Star TrekInto Darkness to 24, it's easy to see which of the color calibrations is the 'best and most accurate' - A/B'ing using the Windows Color Mgmt window to switch between default, eyeball calibrated, and ColorMunki calibrations)Into Darkness to 24, it's easy to see which of the color calibrations is the 'best and most accurate' - A/B'ing using the Windows Color Mgmt window to switch between default, eyeball calibrated, and ColorMunki calibrations)
B00992CF6W|5.0|my kid played and played and was glued to it! She loved the updates and every thing. I love this too. I thing YOU  should buy this awesome awesome game!
B0032FPVKE|4.0|Nice case, decent padding, great price. Enough room to hold all of the accessories including charger, batteries, memory cards, micro tripod, etc. Its a good deal for the money.
B00GHJ77KO|5.0|This song is pretty good and has a mix of todays style and little of dance and others.  Its a great variety of styles wrapped into one.  Lady Gaga knows how to pump out the hits.  A+ from me<br /><br />How I review my music: If I don't have to find a remix of a song to like it, its a great song and will get a 5 star rating from me. but if I have to find a remix that sounds better than the original to actually like it, thats when I give the song a bad score because the original artist didn't make it sound good, instead the remixer did
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Although the ending was not the one I wanted, I still think it was a well written book. It definitely has a different feel then the other two books, but it is still a good read.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I am a big fan of this author.  Her characters all seem so real.  The plot is quite dark, but it is still a great book.
0061801313|5.0|The deal to get this book was great and cheaper than at other online shops. The series itself is beyond cool.
B0091WNK8M|5.0|A great kid's adventure movie!  Although there are a few bad words, I consider this one of those few movies with no 'adult humor'... which I try to shield my little ones from.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|this game is probably the best game I have ever played in a very long time. just like the movie.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Just when you thought that you had the plot figured out - there is a twist to the story.  Absolutely loved it.  The writer has a good sense of humor.
B00GGETKE6|1.0|It really makes me mad that you can watch Amazon videos on every device but an Android phone, including an I phone.  It's Amazon's way of trying to force people into buying their Kindle.  Not going to happen here.
B00F35BV64|3.0|I am a long time fan of Star Trek and all it's many incantations so you may want to take this review with a grain of salt.  Also, if you have not seen this movie yet you may want to skip this review as it will contain spoilers.<br /><br />While I will admit, the cinematics of this movie are awesome and the effects incredible in every way, the story was lacking.  It almost seemed as if the crew were going through the motions with little connection to the characters they were representing.  And perhaps, that's where the real problem begins.  This production would be beyond belief if it were not for the long history of these characters dating back to the 60's.  Also, a reboot has to have something more going for it than that history and cheeky monologue stolen from the past.<br /><br />Spoilers:<br />While the original Wrath of Khan was an incredible movie with ground breaking special effects for the day it also had the plot to hold its viewers interest beyond the 'wow, look at that' effect.  Into Darkness could very easily have accomplished that without stealing from its past version.  Why not say Harrison was one of Khan's commanders, loyal to his leader, 'family & crew' to the point of self destruction.  JJ's 2009 reboot took the characters to places we've never seen while taking a few parody like jabs at the iconic Red Shirt getting killed immediately upon arriving on that strange new world.<br /><br />What was good about this movie [not looking at as a 'fan'] is how JJ made a parody of the original Wrath of Khan.  In that light, it was pretty solid.  And again, the effects were really cool especially the whole 'ship falling out of space' thing.<br /><br />So, if you're a fan of the original Trek and you don't like seeing that being slaughtered all to hell, DO NOT watch this movie as it will be disappointing.  If you're new to Trek and have no connection to the original, then the three stars I've given this movie are for you.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Loved the language and the story. He's an understated and gentle author, treating characters and readers alike with extraordinary compassion.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Awesome, easy to read, efficient and user friendly!<br />I utilize this calculator at work and home. My husband,  who is app challenged also really likes it!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is one of the best post-apocalyptic novels I have read. The characters are well-developed, the idea is original and the author is hilarious. I'm hoping he writes another trilogy with these characters because I did not want the story to end. I'll be sad when everyone else discovers how good Hugh Howey is because then I'll have to pay more than $5 for his books.
B00D3NSDVO|1.0|Torturous 700 pages of absolute rubbish. Illogical, not  a thread of believability. Sounds like it was written by 16 year old who's watched all the Mission Impossible movies. Only finished it cause I paid for it. What a waste of time and money.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|Spell binding and  interesting.  Dawson was  treated  badly by his family  because he wanted to better himself.  It ended with a twist , sadly.
B00DSOG0QS|5.0|Book #1? Cannot wait for book #2! Great book especially if you like this type of genre. highly recommend. :)
B001NLKXK2|5.0|They never called my mother's disease Alzheimer's, rather senile dementia with psychosis.  Regardless of the title it robbed a loving and intelligent woman of her ability to remember herself, her family, her ability to sing.  This book caused me to relive much of what I previously lived and learn so much more.  Thank you....I
B00C5R8364|5.0|Forsyth delivers again. This was a great read with a good cast of characters and a great plot. It kept me wanting to see what was on the next page and had a good ending.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Just as fun as the original but i can get it on my Kindle. I take my Kindle everywhere  i go.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|It felt rushed to me. I love her writing, and the story line- though not what I would have chosen- is emotionally intense, but it lacked the depth that she had in the last two books.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I think this is one of Grisham's better novels.  Once I started reading it was difficult to put it down until I finished reading the entire novel.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I  love this app it is soooo awesome. It's really fun to play. I play it all the time It's so fun.
1604680547|5.0|This is just the book I was looking for.  The designs are perfect for my style of quilting, and the spiral binding makes the book easy to work with.
B00BEIYMAG|4.0|A family moves in to the new house only to find it with ghost that hurt them  I found this movie very good if you like ghost you will like this one.
B0093QHWLC|5.0|Great cast and solid story line.  Directed by Clint Eastwood which was a surprise by very well done.  I would recommend this film.
B00G4NUQYM|4.0|Update:<br />Positive:<br />- Upon posting my original review (below), the developer responded almost immediately, even on a weekend.<br />- The game itself is very enjoyable, though not quite as good as a similar game that I've played.<br /><br />The developer changed the \\"locked\\" icon that I mentioned to a \\"shopping cart\\" icon in the screenshot.  This shows that they took my comments to heart and genuinely don't want people to feel ripped off as I felt.  I don't recall if they had previously specifically stated \\"80 puzzles\\" in their description as they indicated in their response and I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt on that, but I typically pay less attention to the description than to the screenshots to get the feel for what the game is.  I certainly appreciate that they updated their screenshot and that they did so quickly.  That speaks good things for the developer.<br /><br />I have updated my review from 2 to 4 stars to now reflect my opinion of the game itself.<br /><br />To explain my review: I have seen other similar games.  On our non-fire kindle, there is a series of games exactly like this where you use word segments to build the words based clues given (incidentally, those were free).  In addition to the clues given, that version had categories where every word in the puzzle was somehow related to a general category.  There was a 1-word clue to the category as the title of the puzzle, but the category wasn't revealed until the end.<br /><br />I don't expect ever similar game to be the same, so I don't so much know a star for that as for the fact that some of the words used in this puzzle are a bit obscure.  Also, there are occasionally responses that don't match the tense or condition of the clue.  For example, a clue might be \\"calm/peaceful\\" and the response could be \\"quieter\\", for which I would have expected the clue to be \\"more calm/peaceful\\".  It is a minor issue, but can make solving some a bit more tricky than they should be because you are trying to take cues from the clue that you cannot assume.<br /><br />Overall - I really enjoyed this and would highly recommend the game itself to any word puzzle enthusiast.  However, whether 80 puzzles is worth the dollar asking price when there are cheaper options out there is something that everyone needs to decide for themselves.  I mistakenly thought there were far more and it there were (there are 280 total, but you have to pay an extra dollar per 40 after the original 80), I would easily say it was worth the price.  Perhaps we are a bit spoiled by so many cheap apps, but there is an opportunity cost of purchasing this instead of something else that needs to be considered.<br /><br />Original review:<br /><br />If the developer is reading, please respond.<br /><br />As others have indicated, this is a fun and potentially educational word game, but my review is to one specific point.<br /><br /> The game I purchased for 99 cents.  A screenshot shows 6 sections of 40 puzzles each with the first 2 unlocked and the rest locked.  When I open the game, I see the same, but instead of being locked, I see each of the other sections with a cost of an additional 99 cents.<br /><br />The screenshot implies that as I continue, I can open new levels.  Perhaps, as one might assume, by completing previous levels.  I thought I paid for all levels based on their screenshot and am discouraged.<br /><br />Perhaps the charge is just to open it early and by completing levels, I will open them without paying extra.  If so, I will update my review to 4 or  stars.  In the meantime, buyer beware.
B007JZGIMS|2.0|I'm &#34;new&#34; to it, so I'll give it time, but it's not a comfortable start so far. Not recommended, yet.
B00D2ZF24O|4.0|A journey into space a ship is destroyed and forced to land on a planet with wild and strange things Will Smith And Jaden Smith Are Great in this move a must see.
B00GH4R95C|3.0|This was a typical rehash of the Super Man story that consisted primarily of slam bang special effects.  Not my cup of tea but could be if I were 16.
B00BAXFAJC|3.0|I have not finished the book yet but I find it a little ponderous so far. It will take me a while to get through it. This is another Booker prize novel that that disappoints.<br /> Taff12
B003H4I4JU|3.0|I was curious about this book after reading Ender's Game. I read several other reviews and it seems some people loved it. Even called it their favorite book. others hated it.<br /><br />Having just finished, I am somewhere in between love and hate. Leaning towards hate.<br /><br />A word of advice to those who decided to give any of Orson Scott Card's books a try is DON'T read the introduction. He blathers on and eventually spoils what is supposed to be the big secret of the story.<br /><br />I took the overall message to be acceptance of others and their faults. I think that's pretty ironic because I recently learned Mr. Card is a huge homophobe.
B00DPUB56U|5.0|I Must tell you I love Saoirse Ronan I have all of her movies she was in lovely bones & Hanna & I could never be your woman & Gemma Arterton was in Hansel & Gretel if you like vampires you will like this one with a strange twist.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Remember to block  or you will probably end up dying in the first minute anyone reading this just block or die simple as that
B00BWWS81S|4.0|Very nice album.  The great Howie Gelb produced, and it works beautifully.<br />My complaint is that the pamphlet insert is totally unreadable- and not because of artistic expressiveness - because of terrible design.  Photos are nice, but the font is so small it can't be read. If you have an interest is seeing who the supporting musicians are, following the lyrics, or seeing her acknowledgments, forget it.  I cannot understand why Blue Note Records let this packaging out the door and I don't know how else to complain!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Love it! It's fast moving free and it actually works great Even offline! I recommend it for everyone! Definately worth downloading.
B008JFUO36|4.0|This is a good  film but I am not a big fan of Tom Cruse but I like to see the movies hat Morgan Freeman is in
B00992CF6W|5.0|This the best game ever since I don't have it for x-box or p.c.buy it for my sake. Bye everybody I hope u like it
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|I tend to be a science fiction fan, but this was a thoroughly engaging mystery. It was suspenseful and hard to put down. I did not guess the ending which was both plausible and satisfying. If I were a mystery fan, I'd probably have given it 5-stars.
B00FEN58KA|5.0|I love this doll it is very pretty and I love playing with it specially it is from the disney store first this hair quality is not really meant for children because if All the detail second the dress is sparkly and has snowflake designs on it I hate the twisty legs but the shoes are just plain sky blue flats nothing much this doll is good out of the box or in the box thank you and have a good day

B00G4PX1MO|5.0|This game is off the hook which is Freaking Awesome which has one of my favorite 8 Legged bug the Scorpion Which they are Badass at what they do and poisons other things like spiders and stuff.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Interesting story line but could have been written so much better. I felt like the story didn't quite have the cohesive flow it needed or quite the ending you would expect. Finishing this left me feeling like I'd finished an uncompleted story. I will give the author this much, at least she tried. It was decent, but nothing I'd pick up again.
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|This story was truly one of soul searching and finally honesty that saves the honor, soul also lives of many. Most of all the respect of those lost and placing of blaim on the correct person. It says that we all have to take responsibility for our actions in life.
B00FHATBGW|5.0|Great integration of adventure, hos, puzzles, and items to use. Overall a great, and long, game. It keep you invested from start to finish. Can't wait for sequel.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book is good but it was poorly written and I think it needed a little editing. Other then that it was a good read and interesting in some parts of the book.
B000HF6XV8|5.0|Truly loved this movie. This movie would be for anyone 8 yrs. and on. My recommendation is based not for bad language or anything but to understand the plot of a little orphan girl finding friendship, trust and love. I definitely recommend this movie.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is simple one of the best TV series I have even seen.<br /><br />If you are not a Downton Abby fan, that simply means you have not seen Downton Abby.<br /><br />To watch it is to love it.
B009HSPODE|5.0|I really liked Alice Munro's short stories. I read quite a bit and these stories you didn't have to plow through. They were real page turners. I recommend this for the short story lover.

B0070Y46UY|3.0|I loved the movie so I thought I would like the book. I feel like the book would have been better if written by someone else. Just didn't seem to have a great grasp on how to write such a drawn out book. But I wouldn't call this a bad book in the least, just not a favorite read
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|really enjoyed the way the story was threaded back into &#34;the shining&#34;. Easy to follow and also somewhat unpredictable. A great read!
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|My 5 y/o daughter loves it. I enjoy watching with her. It's a very witty show and I have never seen her laugh so hard. Very little to worry about negative role modeling - not quite Veggie Tales, but not close to any of the alternatives. I grew up on Bugs Bunny, Superfriends, etc. and thought it might be neat to watch with my daughter, but Wow! Seems really violent and mean now.
B004PYWRQC|2.0|This is a poor movie of an outstanding book, The Club Dumas by  Arturo Pérez-Reverte. A number of witty and original points in the book were replaced by predictable schlock in the movie. I don't usually have a lot of patience for &#34;the book was so much better&#34; people, but in this case it's true.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Wow they've done it again. This game is just as good as the others. So far I'm on level 4 and I'm enjoying myself quite a bit.
B001LRJH0K|3.0|This review will focus solely upon the actual quality of the transfer of this movie to Blu Ray and will not supply a review of the movie itself, a synopsis of the film, opinions on the acting or plot summary.  I do have the film on a Standard Def DVD but this is not a side by side comparison.  The rating I gave is based only upon the quality of the Blu Ray.<br /><br />VIDEO……<br />  This film was shot on film and not digitally which may account for the soft focus and slight smearing of fine details as noted in wide angle shots of the prairie and streets.  This loss of detail can also seen the characters hair and back ground surroundings.  Close ups and interior shots are greatly improved as opposed to the exterior shots with good details in close ups.  The lines in Ed Harris's face are well defined.  The color grading is warmly presently with much gold and yellow.  Night time shots were devoid of deep blacks and presented themselves as dark grey. I was disappointed in this especially.  However,  at no point did I notice any disturbing artifacts or uneven coloring.  This said, I do not believe that any work was done on Appaloosa to improve the imaging prior to transcoding it to Blu Ray.  Between the SD DVD and this Blu Ray, there really isn't much difference.<br /><br />AUDIO….<br />  The audio of this film defaults to a lossy Dolby Digital codec so be sure to go to audio setup to switch is to the lossless Dolby True HD 5.1 before watching.  Dialogue is clear and transparent with all audio levels very consistent throughout the film.<br />There is some very nice panning of horses and buggies across the front stage but almost no foley fx steered towards any of the surround channels.  Basically, you are getting a nice stereo mix for the front stage with the surrounds barely used even for ambience.  The LFE channel does have some moments, especially for gunfire scenes but is not called upon very often.<br /><br />EXTRAS….<br />  The extras are the exact same ones as on the Standard Definition DVD and are quite nice.  You are provided with several alternate/deleted scenes including a different opening prologue. The other extras are the typical running commentary as well as a few featurettes on the historical accuracy of the town, costuming and characters.<br /><br />This film received mixed reviews as a movie but I liked it. I do wish some effort had been made on the film prior to its being transcoded to the Blu Ray format but, that said, glad I have it in my collection.  If you already have the Standard Def version than you might want to think twice before spending more money on a diminishing return for the Blu Ray.<br /><br />I do hope this review has been of some help to you in deciding upon your purchase.  All my reviews focus solely upon the quality of the transfer.<br />Thank you for reading.as on the Standard Definition DVD and are quite nice.

B001O96JC4|5.0|Not good at reviews.  So briefly....It's a classic.  The romance, even the special effects, the visual depiction of the written storyline...it just works for me.  Modern movies are great, but there will always be a place in my heart dor those that came before and established the standard to beat.
0920668372|5.0|So, when I was in Kindergarten, my teacher read this book to us at Kindergarten Graduation.  She read the same book to us during our 6th grade graduation and it holds those very special memories for me.  I love this book and think it's a precious testament to love throughout time.  I purchased this copy for our baby and have it sitting in this nursery, awaiting arrival!

B000PDYVVG|5.0|Read the book. Check. Saw the movie. Check. Saw the movie again. Check. Ran back into the book while going through my last breakup (which is now dragging on for 22 months so I can appreciate this book even more!).<br /><br />This is very tightly and well written. What a wonderful and cathartic idea! To re-discover yourself via travel and to have a theme for the places you go to. We all would love to do that in spirit but for some reason or another, we simply don't do it. Truly this book is less about the travel and more about the journey. The honesty in the book is refreshing without being self-involved.<br /><br />I have since given this book to every single friend of mine who reads and goes through a major break up... And even to a few others &#34;just because&#34;.

B006M7JCC2|2.0|I first heard of this book and Anita's story from a newsletter written by a woman who I have long admired. In the newsletter was a link to an interview with Anita. I liked the interview and so decided to get the book. Sadly I actually only liked maybe two chapters and found much of the rest to be repetitive and not that interesting. I would have loved, for example, if the author would have discussed all the other things she tried with Eastern Medicine in more detail and how it effected her on an emotional level.<br /><br />The story itself is fascinating, but the book sadly was a disappointment as a read mostly due to how it was written, edited and I am a bit anal about things like that. If you don't care, you will love the book I am sure. I would have simply hoped Hay would have worked harder with her to better the end product.<br /><br />I commend Anita, though, for opening up to so many people and sharing her story. I know it is vulnerable and difficult to do so.
B00BAXFDLM|2.0|The story is incredibly slow. The characters all seem the same and the world felt very bland. I had to drop this book, because I could not find a way to enjoy it.

B009SJ3GUK|5.0|love this show, i was so happy that i could catch up and then start the new season of the show
B00ADQCBEY|3.0|This first season of the Shield was great when I first saw it.  Now, seeing it after all these years, it didn't hold up that well. Mostly, Vic was even more crueler than I remembered. And there were parts of it were boring. Sorry! Still love the show overall!
0452295548|5.0|Written by the person who experienced it, this book is good for those who are recovering from strokes and also good for the people who support them.  It's also good for general reading to keep the knowledge in the back of your head for when it could be needed.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game because I like these kind of games so I rate it a 5star game so you should gag this game.

B00F91RYL8|4.0|Good Zombie movie that looked very realistic and had a lot of action and moral points of view. Brad Pitt is a very good actor.
B0015DROBO|4.0|Wonderful book to read!!!  After a long time I have found such an excellent and well written book. Hats off to the writer.
B00ENNBZ68|4.0|I seen the movie and didn't know its rating, so I thought it should be PG-14 and I am shocked to see it rated R....Sure, Tetsuo Shima's mutation can offend and scare children, but it didn't do anything to me. The only flaw is the rating. I really want the movie, but my mother would flip if she heard it was rated R!
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|When this download was offered on 11/16/13 it said I would receive free coins, and I did not get any.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|This movie has been around for a long time now and there are plenty of reviews on it.  I'll just say that it is one of the best movies I have seen and recommend it with the caveat that it does get into some intense moments.  Great flick.

B009KS4XRO|5.0|Favorite out of all the Bingo Apps. Fast paced and lots of different options whether its slots or Bingo! !!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really liked this game. Not too hard or easy,but I have to admit I had to use a couple of cheats from internet on two levels. This is much better then classic mysteries where you have to keep wandering from room to room. Thumbs up!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|As a long time Stephen King fan, it was a joy to revisit a blast from the past an all grown up Danny Torrance (The Shining). The story was Stephen King at his best, I didn't want to put it down.
B00003CXRM|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie, then put it on your list. It is so funny, even our young grandchildren loved it. Our nine year old granddaughter was heard singing some of the songs from it. We loved it and have watched it several times.
B000EHSVSC|5.0|This is probably the most realistic movie made about Pearl Harbor.  It is given by both sides, which makes it more believable than the Ben Afleck and Josh Harnett version of Pearl Harbor.  You see that the enemy, speaking in my case the Japanese, is not a robotic and cold bunch of thugs, but humans doing the job their government and its propaganda machine instilled in them.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the series.  And the vendor sent it to me in two days!!  That's impressive and I will look for them in the future.
B007WEQ3K8|5.0|I really enjoy this Brain Training app. I like to exercise my brain and do something that gives a challenge. This app does that. It requires quick thinking and paying attention to what is going on.
B0052GACNM|5.0|Such a great CD.  Love Tony and like how his style changes with each singer.  The song selection is wonderful.  Queen Latifah really surprised me with her strong vocals..
B006KX3GXO|5.0|Kindle took this off the market for  a few months. Glad it's back, been doing all my photo editing off my cell &amp; it sucked!!!
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Works great every time I use it. I have it on all my devices. I don't have to worry about downloading my music on all my different devices. This makes it simple.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|Watching Christmas Vacation after the Thanksgiving meal is a holiday tradition in our family.  We never get tired of it.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|This game is super fun for solitaire, the best one I have found. The free trial gives you one set of 9 courses or games. The $0.99 expansion gives you another 12 sets, I think, either way it's well worth the purchase. Very good graphics and audio. You earn golf bucks to spend on upgrade items and additional courses. No need to spend real money in the game and you don't have to be on line to play. Which are 2 big selling points to me. If you enjoy solitaire, I highly recommend giving this one a try!
B004GJDQT8|5.0|I love shopping on Amazon. My favorite thing to buy is books. With this app, I can shop Amazon from anywhere.
B00BP4X3W2|5.0|Steven Spielberg’s “Schindler’s List” is a significant look at the true story of Oskar Schindler’s journey from greedy capitalist Nazi to a man who gave away his fortune to save the lives of Jews. When we first meet Schindler, played by the always commanding Liam Neeson, he has arrived in Poland to profit from the war by opening an enamelware factory. He enlists a Jewish official Itzhak Stern, played by the exceptional Sir Ben Kingsley, to help him in his new venture. Recognizing an opportunity to save the lives of his fellow Jews by getting them deemed essential to the German war effort, Stern convinces Schindler to hire the lower cost Jewish labor. As the factory flourishes, SS Untersturmführer Amon Goeth, chillingly played by Ralph Fiennes, successfully oversees the completion of the Płaszów concentration camp. Schindler view of the Jews begins to change as he quickly sees the twisted cruelty of Goeth as the Jewish ghetto is liquidated and the remaining Jews are transferred to Płaszów. Schindler learns to manipulate and bribe Goeth under the guise of friendship in order to continue to protect his employees. Meanwhile Goeth is intrigued and sometimes amused by Schindler’s willingness to protect his employees. As the camp conditions continue to deteriorate, Schindler grows closer to his employees who would later be referred to as “Schindlerjuden”. When informed that the camp is closing and all prisoners will be moved to Auschwitz due to Germany losing ground, Schindler makes the choice to spend his remaining fortune on bribing Goeth to let his employees come to his new munitions factory in order to ensure their safety. Schindler and Stern type up the famous document that would become known as “Schindler’s List” and from there we learn the fate of Oskar Schindler and his “Schindlerjuden”.<br /><br />“Schindler’s List” captures both the best and worst of humankind and adds a vivid testimony to the continuing impact of the Holocaust on modern Jewish and non-Jewish thinking. Many have looked at the Holocaust and questioned God’s existence. Some find it proof that there is no God or that God is dead. Others see it as a sign that God is a deity that does not care about earthly matters. Then there are those who look at everything that happened and find verification that there is a God and he is benevolent, because he gives each and every one of us free will. The destruction at the hands of the Nazis is free will in play, but the shows that the Nazis chose to ignore God’s guidance. Then there are the neighbors that hid their Jewish friends at the risk of death, the soldiers willing to lay down their lives to take down the Nazis, and people like Oskar Schindler who came to realize that his party was wrong and sacrificed everything he had to save the “Schindlerjuden” that worked for him. In those cases, something stronger was at play and that was people who used their free will to follow God’s will.
B00GH4RKYM|2.0|Two-and-a-half stars. Very dark and humorless.  The violence was necessary, but the movie was too long. I didn't think that the actress who played Lois Lane was suitable for the role. If anyone here hasn't seen the original &#34;Superman&#34; with Christopher Reeve, I thought it was a superior portrayal. I suppose I had mixed emotions about the way the plot was played out, but heck, at least there was lots of action.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|My experience was that video appeared like a slide show.... perhaps 1 frame a second.  It is a great product for non-video use such as sharing photos or listening to music.  It appears th PC, phone, or tablet has to process the video as it plays on that device, and then send it to chrome cast... not a good solution for small processors.<br /><br />I was using the chrome browser in this review.  Not Netflix or YouTube app.
B004X6PRO6|4.0|This book is amazing to listen to  on audiobook because  1) it is shocking and 2) it is narrated by North Korean so there is a realism in the accent that would be missing from the written page.  The thought patterns of the North Korean characters is completely new to me.  The characters' perspective of the world, Americans, right and wrong, animals, loyalty, the way to treat others, is almost unbelievable to me.  While listening I feel submerged in North Korean so-called morality. I am glad to be reading it because I feel as though I can get a glimpse into the life they live under the regime of the &#34;beloved leader&#34;, blinded by their loyalty and unable to leave.
B00DEE9U0K|5.0|This package does not sell in Japan. I could get the great Discs from here. I have the English version of all 1, 2, 3 season &#34;The Walking Dead.&#34;
B0084BMUFA|5.0|A masterpiece that everyone should read at least once. The spirits have lessons for us as well. A true literary blessing!
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Let me start saying that I'm a fast reader...it took me less than 48 hours to read Divergent, Allegiant a week and Insurgent took me a month. I loved Divergents Tris and Four but I wasn't feeling them in the next two books, in fact I hated Allegiants Tris most of the book, and even though Four was my favorite character I couldn't find a connection with him in this book, and we were reading him directly for the most part. The ending felt forced and defeated and not because the death of an important character but because it didn't make sense, the character didn't deserve such a stupid ending...I agree with some reviews, the story deserved more development and not this rush ending. I'd still go to the movies for Divergent and keep rec'ing this story, but not with the same urgency I felt after reading the first book.
B001FB55H6|5.0|The Watchmen is actually my favorite &#34;superhero movie&#34;. It combines the grittiness of the original comic with the fanfare of 1980s/1990s comics seamlessly and is (in my opinion) EXACTLY what a comic book movie should be. I just wish the other directors would take a look at this movie to see how it SHOULD be done.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Quite a bit more fun than the Facebook version.  The graphics are more impressive and the game loads faster than in Facebook.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Terrible. Barely works on my fire. Tried to send a birthday greeting and the writing box kept disappearing. Can't scroll the message bar for comments on my posts. I'm on the verge of deleting it from my fire. Some fixes are needed.
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|Easy and intuitive installation. It has been working for more than four month with no issues and on one set of bateries. I recommend this item.
B00EUS9JF0|4.0|Paul McCartney's best album in about 10 years.  A good album to turn up loud and sing along to.  His back up band is excellent.  Some of the songs are like classic throwback to Wings and the Beatles.
B00GH4RKYM|2.0|I really don't get all the hype and positive reviews for this movie. The special effects are great of course... But that is the entire movie! Plot...story line.... everything that makes a movie ... a &#34;movie&#34; (to me) is nonexistent here. Anyone older than 17 will see right through it. It's the 2012 movie from above. Just not my thing. Actually, 2012 was much better.
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|One of the things that makes a movie great is a 'wow' soundtrack.  The Man of Steel soundtrack by Hans Zimmer is a definate 'WOW'.  I especially like 'Earth', 'General Zod' and 'Arcade'. I was dissapointed that the music from the escape from the ship and subsequent rescue of Lois in the escape pod was not included.  I still give this 5 stars!
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|works well for netflix and youtube. didn't try Pandora.<br />You can NOT stream web from your Android phone - you can only access apps they let you download. You have to download the google cast extension from google Chrome, and it doesn't work on android phones - you'll get the message that the Chrome shop isn't supported. So that means you're pretty limited.<br />It won't work with my Archos tablet (chrome not supported) so I was stuck with trying to set up videos to play from my phone - very small, can't read descriptions, as you can't mirror the menu on your TV, just the \\"cast\\" video. Much too small to see very well. I could have brought my netbook upstairs and used it, but if I have to use a laptop, what's the point of having it on TV?<br />I'm returning it to the store.<br />Edit update - After two failed attempts with other less-than-stellar devices, thought I'd give in and try this again with my Win7 laptop. Although it showed the device added to the home network on the chromecast app, it showed the eternal circle timer and \\"searching for device\\". On the google cast extension, it showed \\"no devices found\\". I wasted an entire weekend on help forums and chromecast help. Never did get it to sync with the laptop, even though I rebooted every device - even the router - and followed all instructions. I'm sending this back.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Probably the best I've seen on the KFHD.  Solidly in the realm of '03-'05  nVidia. That's not a snarky put-down; because the gameplay is there.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Khaled Housseini impressed me again.  Wonderful story, well researched and extremely well written.  His books are awesome and this one is no exception.
1454704225|4.0|full of fun doodles to incorporate into your artwork. i like the spontaneous way they are drawn.  they are good inspiration for other designs.
B009EEWZGU|3.0|Love the movie itself- it alone gets 5 stars from me. Amazon however, does not. The loss of two stars is because Amazon does not come right out and tell you that this is forever a streaming movie only. I can download it to view 2 times, for a limited amount of hours, offline. That's it. :( Had I implicitly understood that, I would never have purchased their digital copy, since I can buy the dvd and be given a digital version 'free'. I'm very disappointed about that. I thought I could download it to my device and take it with me wherever I am.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My kids love it.  They play all the time.  Want it to be easier to earn stamina.  Would make it more fun for them.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|i wish there was an easier way to get tokens. I would be able to play more that would be great
B00BATG18K|1.0|I wanted so badly to like this book.  Amy Tan was one of my favorite authors of all time; I own all of her books and I have loved them each and every time I read them.  The Joy Luck Club, Kitchen God's Wife (my personal favorite) 100 Secret Senses and the Bonesetter's Daughter all have an honored place in my library.  Then came Saving Fish from Drowning.....which I hated.  It seemed like that book was written by  someone completely different than the person who wrote her first four novels and this is how The Valley of Amazement feels as well.  It does not have the same heart as the titles listed above. It felt hollow and hurried to me and I did not ever feel a connection to Violet at all.  I could not make myself even finish the book, I got half way through just waiting to see if it got better before I finally gave up.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Finally a great zynga game on KINDLE....and it's free with Amazon coins..I reading all the reviews and see they didn't receive their coins and crowns..I received both with no problems...it's not 110 coins it's 100 coins..and if you didn't receive it call Amazon to let them know and they will correct it....but it's a great game so I do recommend this game

B001CNFZEK|5.0|Simply put ,this album opens a door where the band found its deepest music. Following is Caravan Serai then Welcome and Borbolleta. Amigos marked a shift towards mainstream music. Undoubtedly this period was where I became enchanted with the music. My interest in jazz began with the progression of Santana in this period. I was saddened somewhat following the music back to stuff that sells.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun to do when you're bored! I really love this game! I would recommend this game for every one, no matter your age!!
B000KKPN5C|5.0|I bought this in May, 2011 and have not been disappointed. It works exactly as expected, has not failed me once, and unless I'm out of batteries, I never use the built in flash.

B007VYDFMS|3.0|I like Bob Marley the musician.  I didn't care as much for the film.  It was interesting to learn about his background and where he came from.  I just found the movie slow moving.  I was hoping for a little more.
B009LOJK1Q|5.0|This was another thrilling page turner. Stephen tells us what life might be in modern America if things were different. I feel like visiting the places he talks about in the book.<br /><br />Read The Shining first (don't really on the Kubrick film). You will enjoy this book even more.
B00F91SCXC|3.0|An attempt to follow the book but as in most cases, the book was much better. I enjoyed the movie but as I say, I enjoyed the book much more!

B00006CTC0|5.0|Great...  AC/DC are an Australian hard rock band, formed in November 1973 by brothers Malcolm and Angus Young, who have remained constant members. Commonly referred to as a hard rock or blues rock. band, they are also considered pioneers of heavy metal and are sometimes classified as such,[though they have always dubbed their music as simply &#34;rock and roll&#34;.

B00C50NV2M|4.0|Great product. Added 2 more sets for our new 3d TV so the whole family can watch. Arrived quickly. Fits what we needed.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|My toddler loves Shaun!  I have to say that I watch along too.  The characters don't talk and just use gestures and sounds.  Often, the gestures are very funny. Episodes are broken down into 7-10 minute stories.  There are three stories on each episode.  This is perfect for a toddler's attention span.  Love it!
B00D7NWTSI|4.0|Good movie. Enjoyed watching the movie in 3d on our new 3d TV. Watching the flying parts and the depth throughout the movie was great.
B000OXHRRC|5.0|Charming movie that showcases Russell Crowe's comedic timing perfectly!  Wonderful scenery and supporting cast as well. A must see for any Crowe fan.
0375842209|5.0|The Book Thief was required summer reading for rising 8th graders and as one of the team of teachers (not language arts or reading), I just try to connect with students by reading what they do.  I typically enjoy these quick reads, but did not have any expectations.  Woah!  I was I caught off guard.  I was absorbed as the storytelling was brilliant.  As I was tearing up one Saturday afternoon, completely caught into the story -- my husband walked in and said -- &#34;Good book?&#34;  Yes.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|In depth look at relationships and interactions and ripple effects. I enjoyed the action. A slow, warm, descriptive read.<br />Definitely worth reading.

B006AZZPCM|5.0|With a bit of a yes-but.... Make sure you download a file manager as well so you can find your videos afterwards!
B00571F26Y|5.0|This book shows you where the grain meets the brain.  We have been duped for years.  This book shows you how that wheat IS the cause of many diseases.  It is not just the weight and the belly; it is the over all health that is threatened.  China has many more acres than the USA, yet they do not grow Wheat, why? They know the truth, wheat causes illness, diminishes health, increases health care cost and is a learned habit.  This book is the wake up call.
B004X6PRO6|1.0|Parts of this book are well written and story flows well.  Other parts are just confusing.  I had high hopes but it became such drag.  I finally stopped and deleted it from Kindle.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Vintage Stephen King!  A very good sequel.  It was a suspenseful book that was hard to put down.  Glad to see that King is still writing spell binding books.

B0089LOG02|4.0|Very good young adult tale - nice juxtaposing of a modern young teen with that of an orphan raised in the early part of the 20th century. Highly recommend for the 12-18 year olds.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I have learned so much about the lives of people in England, Russia & Germany during the time of WWI.  The political conflicts are described by the everyday lives with their problems with  conditions of the times.  They are rousing stories of individuals that open that era to the reader.  The stories are fascinating and so absorbing that it is difficult to stop reading!  Ken Follet is a supremely good story teller and teacher!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|While there aren't any surprises, you wouldn't want any. It's a straight forward calculator app that mimics those old solar ones from public school. Looks great and works intuitively. Recommended.
B00CSSMT6A|5.0|The most Beatle-like recording Macca has produced.  This version of  Wings was an exceptionally talented group and the remastered recording  really shows what they could do. Jimmy McCulloch and Denny Laine are/were great musicians and compliments to McCartney.  The guitar, instrumental and vocal arrangements are incredible.  In addition, they employed a brass section for this tour which really adds to the sound. The material is linked together side two &#34;Abbey Road style&#34; with one song rolling right into another, at least in the beginning.  Linking the songs seems to heighten the energy in their performances.  McCartney live in his early 30s is fully of energy, joy and exuberance in playing and singing the music.  Very enjoyable.
B00GH4R95C|3.0|It was good but it had some flaws.  The casting was like a Matrix reunion and that became even more apparent when the robot tentacles appeared and the fight scenes.  The dialogue needed some work; it seemed very forced.
B00F3VOL38|5.0|Some outstanding vocal performances that the studio recordings didn't match, especially on &#34;Mr. Postman,&#34; &#34;Money&#34; and &#34;Kansas<br />City.&#34;  A must for all Beatle fans.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|This game is pretty cute. I like that it looks cartoonist.<br /><br />I got this game when it gave an incentive to try it. Amazon added coins to my total coins I already had, but the math was wrong. I was shorted 10 coins. I don't know if that's amazon or the game makers.
B004OC07F8|4.0|The theory itself is thought-provoking and definitely an eye-opener. The book offers theory and examples along with clear and easy to follow steps how to implement this approach to business development. The website offers additional readings and discussion groups.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I like fb,but I don't understand all of it. They r always changing it.i am not computer literate and when they change things,I am never sure what to do,
B00CEF014E|5.0|Solstice is deceptively mild in the beginning. Dana, the main character is introduced, and I immediately wondered what sort of bizarre salt and pepper had seasoned her past.  When her sister is introduced, I was even more curious.  Both women seem a little &#34;off&#34; and I wanted to know why.  As the story moves along, a dark cast of characters emerge and I was unsure of who could be trusted.  Before I could organize my thoughts on that matter, I was thrown into a whirlwind of suspenseful and nerve-racking activity.  The way Damian Stevenson described panic and fear made my heart pound. I felt Dana's immense anxiety as she and her sister set out to change their situation.  When I thought I needed to take a break, he expertly calms the story down... only to start my heart pounding again a few minutes later! Solstice is a quick, exciting story.  I intend to check out other work by Damian Stevenson.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I'm only saying that because it was the best book I've ever read overnight! I won't be able to sleep at night cuz it was sooooooo good! I'm tingly on the inside!
B001SGEUNI|5.0|Man this lady rocks the house. If you like rock and the added benefit of a female lead vocalist who can belt it out, look no further. Both albums rock.
0744014956|5.0|It helped me out a lot. This book has everything, guns, cars and all the secrets. I would tell people to buy this boom.
B00CS7ZIHI|4.0|This is a pretty decent album. Not as good from front to back as This is War, but certainly is the Thirty Seconds to Mars sound. Previous reviewer talked about hard guitar sounds not there like on This is War...honestly, I struggle to find that on that album. They have always mixed in different sounds and do it on this album as well.
B008N1V11U|5.0|The game has very high quality graphics but the game is fully hard. I had to delaet it because it was taking up too much space
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|Very Fun album with Ho Hey as my favorite pick me up song.  Great group! Very enjoyable listen on drive to work.
B00CB4ET0K|3.0|It is awsome and it has so much cool guns it is like call of duty black ops it is awsome
B005QBKXOQ|5.0|British cousin loves this artist so I send him an album every year.  I like Daughtry too and hope he keeps new music coming our way!
B00AGOGOLE|2.0|Not impressed with this camera.  Like simple would rather have one that is easier for me to use.  I am not into HD all that much.
B00DW5IM9Q|5.0|these unknown jewels from Dylan are from around 1971-1973.thera are many plain old &#34;folk songs&#34; ,along with alternate takes of many well known dylan classics.This is a 2 disc set. If you wish to &#34;spend&#34;your time and hard earned cash,go for thw full big box set.Along with the 2 previously mentioned discs,this version has a concert from very early seventies from the Isle of Wight in Englandhere is where  you know you've purchased rare gems(and there are so many).it was worth the extra $$ for me .the presentation is incredible,along with two books of rare photos from the long tour as well as many other great pix. Get it Now!!you will be released!:
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I have only been playing for a short time, and I am all ready hooked. It reminds me so much of the original Castleville on Facebook. And I loved playing that one. The only real complaint I have, is you have no control over adding friends. Other than this I find nothing wrong, and I look forward into leveling my castle more and more each day. Adventure on.......
B00F91SCXC|4.0|Thought this was a well put together film with a good plot, but with a real twist to how the Zombies act.  The problem for me though was that the action was way too fast. It was difficult to tell what was going on at times because the action scenes changed so much and was too fast.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is awesome it is so addictive I would really  recommend this if your a kid with nothing to do
B00992CF6W|5.0|I was thinking that u should add potions and caves or abandoned mines or revins or witches or swamps but I'll be ok I'm just anxious
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Wonderful job again it was just as helpful as the other for me. For this I will give you give stars for this keep on with your good work.
B009LGO88E|5.0|It works very well with the 3ds XL (or LL) and the extra shoulder buttons and circle pad make playing games like Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate and Metal Gear Solid 3D much more enjoyable and somewhat easier to play, especially monster hunter.
B003WUYRGI|3.0|It was very helpful for my studies. Three stars I have giving you wonderful job. Keep on with your work.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|I thought that it was very interesting!! I love the Kane chronicles and I hope that more people can read this excellent book
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|Although certain parts were predictable, I enjoyed the way it is written, reads easily, lots of pertinent details.<br />Difficult to put down especially way into the book.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|It's as advertised.  It has a clear readout and a great alarm that uses your music, or you can choose from the app's alarm sounds.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|This can be a fun game once you get the hang of it. But, it would be nice if the instructions were more than only a few words. Like how many lives do you get? How often do you get more? How do you proceed to level 36? How do you earn the powers? How are they use? JUST A FEW QUESTIONS I HAVE!!!!!!!!!
B00CF34B2I|1.0|I had to reset my kindle because it took up so much space on it. It also wouldn't let me use the internet.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Easily 5 stars, and one of the best books I've read this year (if not ever).<br /><br />This is the first book of William Landay's I've read, and I'm hooked. His writing style is descriptive, easy to relate to, and very attention grabbing.<br /><br />The premise of the book is a father who is an attorney, and his son is being accused of the murder of one of his classmates. The book features a great legal premise, mixed with relationship struggles, parenting struggles, professional struggles, and an ending that I didn't see coming.<br /><br />I read this book in two days and it was a true page turner. I'm looking forward to reading more from Mr. Landay in the future.
B00FF8OKJE|3.0|This game is a lot like stronghold kingdoms but has a longer safe build time and I don't see the scouts for getting free resources that I can see on the map.
B00FF8OKJE|5.0|So I have this app. I thought you logged in with your pc account but u don't need it to play! Anyways this is a really epic game.  Tip: Go to goodgamestudios.com to.play the pc version.
B00633PFQC|5.0|If you like Arielly, Freakonomics, Games and Strategy...et al, you will love this book. Sandel come with a simple language but loaded with principles and philosophy. Great reading.
B006LSZECO|5.0|So many twists and turns you could get dizzy but then the author grabs you, and sends you in another direction! Smart writing! Fun to be a part of!
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Very easy too use and fully featured. Installed after the battery life on my kindle fire hd seemed to go south. A proper reset and charge has revitalised the battery. This app is highly customisable ans should help new manage the battery if I get similar problems.
B0016MJ6HY|3.0|Bought this because I watch every movie that Jude and Natalie are in. They were so great together in Closer and Cold Mountain. Although I think all the actors played their parts well, something was missing that the main characters - Jude and Norah couldn't make up for.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Another great story from Grisham.  Fast paced; keeps you rooted until the very end.  Bravo, John Grisham.  Love your work.
B006BFK5DK|4.0|Good effect by EWF. Fans of the group will love it. It's a different sound and today's generation of mus lovers may not dig it because it not over produced like many songs out there today but for those who know or grew up hearing this music it's one to add to your collection.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|Action packed. Fun. Jurassic Park with people instead of dinosaurs! Some scenes were too dark to follow. The only reason I took a star away.
B00ABKGG0C|4.0|Really good.  Fun.<br /><br />Only complaint:  Story seemed to take a sudden turn in 2nd half of book.  Almost felt disjointed.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|love it very addictive.  discovered at a conference.  became addictive.  played every night.  introduced to roommate and she loves it too
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|This game has good graphics and fair realistic control.  I do suggest i could hold a gun much more steady though.  Game play is choppy, not that i want to just keep continually hacking down virtual animals but to keep going back to the main screen after every hunt is sort of lame
B000069HZP|5.0|Great very intense movie.  It arrived before the time stated.  It was in great shape and I've watched it several times.
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|I love this app because it is free and really tests how fast you react to things. The only concern that I have is that The Kindle fire doesn't let me tap 3 things at once, so I can't play the &quot;stop the blood&quot; game.
B00BOXZAJ8|5.0|This movie is just a little different but if you have an imagination you will love this movie.  Stergis is great in this movie, how they created the movie is interesting ( towns, people upside down )
B00F91SCXC|3.0|I found myself entertained by World War Z, even if it had nothing to do with the book by Max Brooks (which I thoroughly enjoyed).  At the same time I found myself comparing it heavily to &#34;28 Days Later&#34;, which it mirrors quite a bit (fast zombies, rapid onset of infection, rapid breakdown of society).  In fact with the last acts of the movie set in Cardiff, Wales, the comparison got even stronger.<br /><br />Make no mistake, this is first and foremost an action flick; there's no deep thinking involved, no &#34;oh wow!&#34; moments, nothing deep.  It starts up quickly and ends quickly and in between is a thrill ride and nothing more.  In short, an entertaining two hours.
B0013F1D02|5.0|Did not know what to expect when we picked it to watch.  We really enjoyed the movie.  Well done and delightful entertainment
B00CNQ7CRI|4.0|I was afraid to read this book.  I picked it up once read the first chapter and then put it back on the shelf.  BUT I couldn't stop thinking about it and wondering how Ms. Fielding would tell the story.  I loved the first book, liked the second and was terrified of the third.  Having finished it this morning, I can say that I enjoyed it and I'm glad to have had a chance to meet Bridget again at this stage in her life.  I can see why people might be upset by the story.  It's certainly not the life you'd wish for Bridget when you first catch up with her again, but it is a real life.  It resonates if you've experienced loss, have children, worry about being perfect and wonder if you're doing anything right at all.  Her relationships and career are inexplicably complicated but that, to me, is what makes these books fun.  The absurdity of the situations that she finds herself in time and time again coupled with the bizarre opportunities that fall into her lap is what makes Bridget Jones who she is to us all.  If you love Bridget Jones I think you will enjoy this book.  If you think you are Bridget Jones then you might find it a tougher read.
B00992CF6W|5.0|very fun love minecraft.Don't have a computer so I don't have the full version but this will do.Immortal_Iron9 is my username.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Mr. Grisham tells such good tales, I  appreciate this one as a continuance into Mr. Jake Briggance's life as a lawyer in southern Mississippi.<br /><br />I enjoyed his growth as a lawyer, as well as his commitment to uphold his client's wishes no matter the cost.<br /><br />I will definitely be re-reading this one.
B00EW9GQR6|4.0|Lady Gaga confirms she's one of today's more unique artists with each and every album that she releases.  On debut 'The Fame', Gaga had all of us enthralled with her &#34;Poker Face&#34; and playing the &#34;LoveGame&#34; among other gems.  On 'The Fame Monster', it was a &#34;Bad Romance&#34; that was such alluringly irresistible dance-pop that we couldn't ignore even if we tried.  Born This Way again was chocked full of hits like the socially-conscious title track, the unnecessary umlaut sporting &#34;Yo&uuml; and I&#34;, and the &#34;I don't speak German but I can if you like&#34; &#34;Shei&szlig;e&#34;.  2013 effort 'ARTPOP' finds Gaga continuing on her quest to both confound, please, and keep pop music interesting, entertaining, and forward-thinking. Sure, ARTPOP isn't without its flaws and may overplay its hand with the amount of sensuality Gaga touts, but it also has plenty of triumphant qualities nonetheless.<br /><br />&#34;Aura&#34; establishes an 'odd-ball' tone early on, certainly contrasting Born This Way's more accessible &#34;Marry the Night&#34;.  On &#34;Aura&#34;, Gaga plays up double meanings and metaphors, particularly on the chorus in which she asks &#34;Do you wanna see me naked, lover? / do you wanna peak underneath the cover? / do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the aura, behind the aura…” &#34;Venus&#34; follows up just as confusingly as &#34;Aura&#34;, with Gaga referencing the female and sex. It's perhaps most manic when she decides to drop the names of the other planets (even mentioning the former 'Pluto'), and can't resist the 'Uranus' joke.  While it's good - if that's even the right word - &#34;G.U.Y.&#34; (stands for &#34;Girl Under You&#34;) is better rounded, with Gaga wanting her boo to both hold her down and make passionate love.  Her affinity for the sensual continues on the obvious concept of &#34;Sexxx Dreams&#34;, which is enjoyable enough if a bit awkward and too much information.<br /><br />&#34;Jewels & Drugs&#34; changes pace, bringing in a hip-hop who's who including T.I., Too Short, and Twista.  Gaga isn't exactly the star as she only contributes the hook and one verse.  Her one verse is notable as she mentions such notable lines such as &#34;I admit that my habit is expensive / and you may find it quite offensive / but I won't die at the hands of another.&#34;  Wow.  &#34;MANiCURE&#34; is not talking about getting nails done, but rather Gaga's cure is a &#34;MAN&#34; to fix her up - typical Gaga-ness.<br /><br />She balances sensual and inspirational on the album's best track, &#34;Do What U Want&#34; which finds her and R. Kelly working together superbly.  The unexpected duet ranks among Gaga's best because it is so different from many of her past songs.  The chorus is nothing short of addicting: “You can’t have my heart and / you won’t use my mind but / do what you want with my body… you can’t stop my voice, ‘cause / you don’t own my life but / do what you want with my body.”  She doesn't back down on the exceptional title track (&#34;ARTPOP&#34;), where Gaga wants pop music and art to be either one and the same or at least work in a unified front (&#34;We could, we could, belong together, ARTPOP&#34;).<br /><br />Gaga's anger on &#34;Swine&#34; is an understatement as she sings &#34;...you're just a pig inside a human body / squealer...you're so disgusting.&#34; It's manic, but it's also very Gaga-esque, particularly given Gaga's love for being over-the-top.  &#34;Donatella&#34; is definitely a nod to the powerful female, written with Donatella Versace in mind, while &#34;Fashion&#34; piggy backs perfectly.  &#34;Mary Jane Holland&#34; is risqu&eacute; considering its title (the &#34;Mary Jane&#34; portion), but even with some interesting lines, it doesn't stand the 'tallest among the trees' of ARTPOP.  &#34;Dope&#34; atones, giving the album it's sole ballad.  Emotional, well written, and somewhat haunting, a substance-abusing protagonist proclaimsto her lover, &#34;I need you more than dope&#34;. Penultimate number &#34;Gypsy&#34; revives the quick tempo characterizing the effort, while former underwhelming single &#34;Applause&#34; feels much better contextually here bringing up the rear.  Aura is 15 tracks deep, all of 'em different from the previous.<br /><br />Ultimately, ARTPOP is another welcome offering in Lady Gaga's discography.  It is enjoyable, creative, and perhaps better than most expected after single &#34;Applause&#34; was underwhelming.  It doesn't supersede Gaga's previous efforts and perhaps save for &#34;Do What U Want&#34;, many of the tracks don't necessarily have that same 'memorability' of Gaga's best cuts of the past. That doesn't mean that ARTPOP still isn't good or worthy of multiple spins (it is), but maybe it just means we've become used to Gaga being Gaga. Regardless, ARTPOP is another fine set for the most part.  3 ½ Stars.#34;I need you more than dope&#34;.

B001HNE3NO|5.0|Historical fiction is a good way to learn about and retain information about certain periods of history.  I learned a lot about the life of the Jews in France during WW II and the period leading up to the war.
B008SOS63S|5.0|Polished yet visceral stage performance. I'd never heard or heard of Joe Bonamassa before stumbling across this performance on Palladia. I was very impressed; I bought the Bluray so I could view the entire performance and a new Bonamassa fan was born.<br /><br />The musicians were all well rehearsed and the band plays tightly together. Joe's command of his array of guitars is exceptional. If you like electric or acoustic guitar, especially Rythm and Blues, you owe it to yourself to audition some Joe Bonamassa material. He is as good as they come.<br /><br />This performance in General is well performed and produced both sonically and visually. The surround mix is representative of how it should be done, and sounds great in 5.1 or 7.1. Finally, the stereo mix is well done and sounds great.
B00AFQC4QC|5.0|This was rich history. It was very detailed, yet easy to read. What horrors!  It was hard for my heart to 'take in'. I can only imagine how difficult it would be to live in an atmosphere of total fear and isolation.
B004YXE438|3.0|It's just okay. I thought it would be jigsaw shaped pieces. I have other puzzle games I like better.  Done
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have a love / hate for this app! When I can go from stage to stage , I love it , But when i get stuck I hate it! It is very fun to play really!
B0009UC7H0|5.0|very good action movie , love it , can't say enough about this movie , it's great , watch it every day
B00EUS9JF0|4.0|Sir Paul shows us all that just because you're older, you don't need to quit rockin'!  This is definitely his best album in some time and deserves to be in the collection of every Beatle or McCartney fan.  And speaking of the Beatles, some of the tracks on &#34;New&#34; would have been right at home on any number of Beatle albums.  Four stars instead of 5 because there are a couple of duds on here, not to mention that 5 stars would indicate total and complete perfection - and there are few albums that fall into that category.  Highly recommended.
B00ECU2SGS|5.0|Great! How can you not like Matthew McConaghey?  I love the South! This has it all love, hate,  fighting,  kids getting into trouble, crazy people, and lots of snakes.
B00F031X62|5.0|The Jimi Hendrix Experience in concert at the Miami Pop festival. Very rare recordings of one of Jimi's finest live performances. Not available for years, now beautifully mastered and priceless performance.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I really liked this book. The story and characters were well developed and believable. Though I did expect some of the outcomes, I was surprised with how they actually happened in the story. It should be included with the suggested readings after Asimov 's Foundation series. Just don't confuse it the 2013 movie by the same name. The movie, though okay as a different story, does not do justice to the actual story line of this book.
B00F031XPS|5.0|The very best documentary to date covering the career of Jimi Hendrix from family, friends, and fellow musicians. Rare footage of previously unseen concert footage from the Experience at the Miami Pop Festival.
B003VIWO9I|5.0|I want my daughter (she's 3 now) to read these books. I've read them 3x now and they're all still wonderful. I'm a fan of all his books but these are my favorite.
B007MB5OCE|1.0|very poor reading. Monotonous, poorly written. Bad plot which goes on endlessly. Why did I finish it? I thought it may get better! Ha!
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|This app on kindle fire HD gets updates at least a month later than on iPod,iPad,or iPhone. I got the Halloween update a week after h as Halloween and my husband already has the newest update after that one. Why does Amazon get late updates?
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Absolutely awesome. It does drift from the book quite a bit, but it's great. The actors playing Thorin and Balin are fantastic in those roles. Of course Ian McClellan as Gandalf the Grey is absolutely awesome as usual. He was born to play that character.
B00EVW0SA0|4.0|Very entertaining<br />Like most action movies filled with a lot of special effects and a lot of shooting. Enjoy it's good.
B003L77G6A|5.0|Great! Funny! The cast is back with more laughs and spoofs. Sheldon (Jim Parsons) never ceases to amaze me. Howard (Simon Helberg) is probably one of the best comedic actors of our time.
B0036G1T78|5.0|An excellent story and good actors, esp. the Swiss assassin. He does an excellent job as do Redford and Dunaway
B009LDD1X0|3.0|This show is losing it's theme. Everyone has girlfriends/wives. It's still ok, but the show is based on four dorks that do a lot of wacky stuff. This is going to be a soap opera before long if it doesn't get back to it's roots. The actors are still great though.
B005HJ6MRO|1.0|This app used to work on my Kindle Fire. When I tried today, nothing is working and I am left on a white screen
B00F91RYL8|4.0|good movie brad pitt is great. but it's missing something and i can't put my finger on what. still worth watching
8172237480|3.0|This book is like raisin bread- nice when the raisin's around, boring the rest of the time.<br />There are some funny moments, but the rest of it is so-so.<br /><br />Tell me, what does this heroine look like again? All I recall are her thundering... no, not thighs,.. cheeks! Okay, so she has fat, hanging cheeks. What else? What, other than her cheeks, does anybody find appealing in her? She's immature, insecure, obstinate, jumps to conclusions, has big hang-ups about where she lives, how she talks, her origins, her looks, her clothes... it's like reading about a teenager.<br /><br />So yeah.. if she'd been 17, it would have been like The Princess Diaries or any of those teenage novels. However, since she's a decade older, she vacillates between being annoying or childish.<br /><br />About the rest of the book: premise is good; many of the descriptions of cricket-mania are spot on; many of the secondary characters are well-developed.<br />Pity about the heroine.
B00EVW0SA0|5.0|this is a great action movie should have a five star rate not a three star movie. it's another die hard type movie love it!!!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ken Follett is a master storyteller.  The characters from FALL OF GIANTS move into the troubling times before, during and after the second world war.  The children grow up and become the focus of the story.  I thought it would be difficult to keep all the characters straight, but they are so cleverly interconnected that it was not a problem.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|I have just started to play but it does seem be good graphics and easy to play for any skill level.
B00BSBY38A|4.0|Twists, turns, drama, English, foreign tones. Interesting, some action, makes you think about &#34;family&#34;. Action, sad, surprising, mystical. Unexpected plot. Consverstation piece. Good worth the rental. Intelligent.
006202406X|5.0|Perfection!  I'm sorry people are so disappointed that V. Roth stayed true to the characters she worked she hard to develop. I highly recommend this book and will continue to love this amazing writer! Well done, Ms. Roth!
B008JH5CVS|4.0|Must see. Action, god story, likeable characters. Sci fi, thriller, violence, well written, very much worth renting. One can do much worse. Check it out.
B008EKOIN8|5.0|My hero Michael Pollan has written another interesting and inspiring book.  For me, cooking is a necessity, not a passion.  But his book sparked inspiration in me and was a great read.
B009NQKXYK|3.0|It was OK. A little disappointing to me. Still, OK. Sci Fi, less pre story prep for the Alien franchise I have grown up on. Worth the rental. I guess I was too psyched up for it.  A little bit of action. Did not like the characters or writiing too much,
B008602KQI|3.0|More entertaining than I thought it would be but my expectations were pretty low, as it is more geared towards young adults or teens.
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|Action, drama, a portrait in time, history, violence, the lead female character is a real natual beauty. Worth the rental. Enjoy.
B003WUYRGI|4.0|It was pretty good and I don't know how I got it since I didn't not download it at all
B00846TTDG|5.0|Action, 9 of 10, realistic, I believe mostly non pro actors, but active or retired military. Good story, you will be on edge of seat, thrill, ride. Militay.  Wow. Worth not just renting, but buying too.
B00CATSONE|5.0|When you work alone, there is a void of mastermind ideas. Tesla is well worth reading for the inspiration it provides to achieve excellence. World events lock us into daily steps of mediocrity. Tesla shows us one man's life fraught with deceitful people blocking his goals and dreams. It is amazing to think how much their arrogance cost humanity, and yet they are presented as great leaders of the past -- Edison, J.P. Morgan et al.<br /><br />The length was sufficient to make the point that imagination is the key.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app seems to take over the operating system. It appears to use more battery power to get you battery usage data. I deleted tis app within 2 days of downloading it.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|Lost tokens as well.  Contacted them and have never heard from them.  I guess I don't matter because I never purchase.  . . Just play off what I earn.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|I believe Denzel Washington's acting performances are always phenomenal. Crimson Tide and The Book of Eli are my favorites. The only aspect I question in pertinence of this movie, Flight, was when the co-pilot's wife sternly exclaiming &#34;Praise Jesus!&#34; in some sort of an odd occult-like fashion. Otherwise all actors did well in this realistic movie of co-dependency & addiction. Mind you, the airline stewardess has an amazing physique, and braved to prove this fact. Well done.
B00B4FU6KE|3.0|The narrative is not well balanced.  The book is intriguing at the beginning, but loses steam underway.  And by the end... it loses the reader.  Very interesting subject though.
B00881VLCE|5.0|If you love puzzles you will love this one. Great fun that you can play for a long time and enjoy it all
B004X6PRO6|5.0|this book is a little beauty.  all considered one of the best I read recently.  do not miss it.  great work, Adam Johnson!
B000SO7OL6|5.0|Krall is -- to me -- a new, exciting, and talented performer who performs with sophisticated orchestration. She simultaneously smolders and enchants as she engages her audiences.
B00GH4R95C|5.0|We had a great evening as a family sitting down and watching this Movie! Fabulous... &#34;I wish I could be like Superman&#34;, says my son.
B001K3JF7K|5.0|Diana's fresh and unique style and sultry phrasing hang around in my memory. She adds an exciting dimension to old favorites.
B005LAJ1H2|4.0|This is certainly an exciting epic, although, as an elderly viewer, I really have trouble keeping up with all the shifting characters.  Having been through two seasons, I now recognize most of the main characters from Atlantic city but am stymied by those who come from Chicago (although I'm doing o.k. with Al Capone) and all the other cities.  Be that as it may, it is an engrossing story and certainly I will continue with it next season and the one after.
B00ELOOYZI|5.0|I had to uninstall it because I was spending too much time on it! Super fun for a nerd like me. I'm no rocket scientist, but I wish I was!
B005K17RU0|4.0|Awesome app. Very dependable &amp; accurate. I use it anytime we have ify weather. No more worries about what's going on. In fact, it's on right now because we are having really bad storms &amp;/or tornados.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I'm not sure what all the hype is about this item. I see it's potential, but I didn't buy a product for it's potential, I bought it so that it would work. This product is slow and has a severe delay when mirroring your desktop. The youtube function is great, but I have xbox 360 for that and also my samsung products already link to my Samsung TV, and much much faster over my wifi network. Also, if I want to see my movies in HD I'll attach a HDMI cable to my computer, which gives me great clarity. Chromecast quality was terrible and not &#34;HD&#34; at all. 720HD is low to begin with and the higher the resolution, the slower the video, which by the way was choppy and stuttered.<br />I'm returning mine to best buy today.<br /><br />I think if you want a full multimedia experience and connectivity to your peripherals I would suggest looking into items that were a little more expensive but give you better flexibility, speed, performance and storage.
B00915G6MG|5.0|Wonderful season.  Looking forward to owning Season Eleven!  Never get tired of seeing NCIS episodes.  It's<br />never become a soap opera.  Still comes up with great stories.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|I can get music on my kindle fire for free. Very useful. Can't download anything from VEVO, and some selected videos. Good app though.
B000I9YWDO|5.0|One of the best comedy movies ever, definitely my favorite Mike Judge movie.  Can't look at &#34;PC Load Letter&#34; the same after watching this movie.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|King strikes again, forcing you to flip through these pages faster than your brain can process the words. It was thrilling to revisit the characters of \\"The Shining\\" so many years later- yet this story is uniquely its own creepy tale!
B005IT0V8O|5.0|I've been using this book for decades.  Although the presentation reminds me of old style grammar books, there is something timeless about the style of William Strunk, Jr.  He certainly has a way with brevity.  It is still the book to brighten up your prose.
B008QE9XD2|4.0|Grate Movie love it I love the cast grate casting one of Burtin best and one Jonny Depp will be remember for
B002MFV2IK|5.0|It may be old<br /><br />Too funny and we all need a good laugh. You are only as old as you feel, and all these women are looking for a magic potion, and they get it!!!!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Dilemma resolved by passing the punishment on to the next generation. I was captivated all the way through, couldn't stop reading until I finished it.
0062059963|4.0|Source: Library<br /><br />*I copied this from my blog and it looks like some formatting was lost*<br /><br />OK-I think this is going to be a long one...fair warning but hopefully there will be some good moments :)<br /><br />This sequel to The Selection had a lot I wanted it to achieve. I wanted a lot more action coming from the rebels who threaten the precarious stability of the country. I wanted America to stop mooning over Aspen and choose Maxon (or vice versa but at least to make a decision). And I wanted a lot more tension among the few remaining girls (for most of the book, there are six still vying for Maxon's hand.)<br /><br />Unfortunately I do not feel that this book left me satisfied.  The rebels do continue to attack possibly for a reason proposed by America but which would be too spoilery to share here. Yet it serves more as a distraction from the main event than as actually furthering the plot. America continues to waver between Prince Maxon and first love Aspen in an annoying fashion (reminded me of the love triangle in The Madman's Daughter where she thought she loved whoever she was with.) On the other hand, the drama of now six girls competing to become princess was exciting (the feelings America and the other girls experience vividly reminds me of what I've read about &#34;The Bachelor/ette.&#34; Note: I do not watch that show but I do read tabloids cover to cover and it gets mentioned a lot.)<br /><br />Still the romance had its moments. Of particular interest to me was America's musing on how although Aspen gives less, it means more because he is starting at such a disadvantage compared to Maxon's life of privilege. If you have a chance, My Friend Amy actually wrote about that back when The Selection came out. I mean, I still prefer Maxon (who is blonde to add to my swooning) and I can't just forgive Aspen for pushing America away but I am more sympathetic to him.<br /><br />And I must mention some of my thoughts about the characters, in handy bullet-format:<br /><br />  America must be addressed first; she continues to exasperate me and the other characters with her impetuous, idealistic, irritating, compassionate self. I love that America cares so much but sometimes the way she expresses that just drives me bonkers! Furthermore her indecision over whether she even wants to be in the competition continues to bother me, largely because of my own personality. I'm pretty decisive and if I'm in it, then I'm in it to win it.<br />  Maxon-we really get to look at the difficulties of being a prince while also seeing how he is trying to (slowly, subtly) change the realities of his country's situation; there is a heartbreaking moment toward the end that shows how even a prince cannot escape a bad family life (oh I just wanted to hug that boy)<br />  Aspen has never been a favorite of mine but he gets a bit more of a chance to present his case and I can mentally understand how hard it is to just turn off feelings but man I kind of just want him to go away.<br />  The other girls-America realizes that her closest friend is also her toughest competitor in a difficult moment. We also see some more about how each is doing her best to get close to Maxon.<br />  King Clarkson emerges as a more immediate threat than the rebels with his intimidating bullying posture that is very unbecoming of a monarch, in my opinion<br />  Queen Amberly and Silvia really shine here-their grace and poise under trying circumstances is most inspiring. I loved both ladies so much and wish it was appropriate that they got more page time.<br />  The maids: Anne, Mary, and Lucy are responsible for many small moments of humor and companionability that balance America's angst and rash decisions.<br /><br />Overall: So many feelings and thoughts generated by this book. I wish I could unreservedly love it (as I want to do with all the books I read) but I appreciate that I am still thinking about it in the days after and I think it will linger in my head if not my heart as I count down to The One.y head if not my heart as I count down to The One.
B0055PMJMW|4.0|Great and entertaining plot development. Harry is a likeable chap with solid instincts.  The stories, however, are sometimes not realistic.
B00A757EFW|5.0|Very Nice! Brings back memories of playing this on the old time Nintendo! Just wish there was more levels instead of same 1st level!
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|What can I say, I love Pendergast ! I have read all of his stories, and this is by far the best! I love the character  Corrie. She is full of spirit and fight. Her and  Pendergast make a great team. It's gonna be a long wait till the next book.....but this one will be read again, guaranteed.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I love her energetic ,joyful style of playing-However, I'm dismayed that this is the 2nd cd which came from Amazon with a<br />cracked plastic case-Perhaps you should change your packaging for cd's-I can't give this sort of problem as a gift for xmas!!
B0027MJU00|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. Flynn keeps you on your toes the whole time. I love how you get to see into different characters mind. It's hard not to flip forward to see what happens to a character. If you love murder mysteries then this is for you
B003KRJNBW|4.0|Denzel is always watchable.  Sort of a formula movie with a little twist.  The ending of the movie is so cloying I had to look the other way.  Max Max gets religion and a renaissance is born.
B007T8BYWE|5.0|The game is extremely fun and challenging<br />There are lots of fun puzzles and it is fun for everyone especially if you like puzzles
B009CPJHY4|5.0|When Judy Dench is around, how can you have a bad movie?  Engaging characters for the most part, decent story line.  Likable.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Horses r fun , this app is fun, get this app and like have a horse cuz horses r rather fun
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|very good game. i like to play with my mom. it is very entertaining. fun. kinda a bit confusing sometimes
B00594XOZU|2.0|It would be a.five but you removed it from the app<br />store but I still like it. I would like it back in the app store because my niece deleted it
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's fun, challenging, and addicting. And to top it all off, you can beat all your friends Facebook scores! This will definitely be a good app for&nbsp;everyone to download.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love all the details. I also love all the things that I can make. It  is also so much making everything that I have.
B00177YA1K|3.0|The movie say it comes with two discs but it does not. There is only one disc and the special features is missing. Without the specsil features disc you can't watch the music vide.
0375869026|5.0|&#34;Wonder&#34; is a book about a 5th grade boy named August Pullman who has a disability in his face.  He is homeschooled because of this. His parents decide to send him to a real school to start 5th grade. He takes a tour of Beecher-Prep Middle School and meets three new people, Jack, Julian, and Charlotte. He quickly becomes friends with Jack and Charlotte. At a halloween party in his homeroom, August hears Jack talking to Julian and saying he doesn't like August. He goes and cries in the bathroom stall. Later Jack relizes and apologizes to August. Later, August's dog (Daisy) gets really sick and dies. August feels abandoned and depressed. August has to get hearing aids and later his school along with many others go on a feild trip to a nature reserve park. They need to go to the bathroom, but the line is too long so they go in the woods. They run into a group of 7th graders who make fun of August, and take one of his hearing aids. Some other boys come along and help August escape. At the end of the school year, Mr Tushman presents August with an award of accomplishing something great. They throw a party at August's house. His mother tells him, &#34;you truly are a wonder&#34;. It is a great book and I highly recomend it.

B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|A game for the entire family to play and enjoy. I play with my granddaughter . She takes over the table every chance she can and this is the game she will play.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I read it because I had heard a lot about it.<br /><br />I always wanted to know what was going to happen next. To me, that is the mark of a good book.<br /><br />I would certainly recommend the book to others.<br /><br />I give the book 4 1/2 stars
B00CT2P6VA|3.0|Great maze puzzles, but I would prefer to pay one price for a game than have to pay extra for coins and cheat tools as I go along. Also, too many glitches in being credited with purchases.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|Good Sci-Fi doesn't come along very often anymore.  This is an exceptionally well made movie with a great story and great acting.  I know it has had so so reviews, which I don't understand.  I watched it a second time to confirm what I already thought and I thought it was better than I 1st thought.  A lot of the story came together the second time around and I felt blown away, really.  I highly recommend this movie!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game! So glad they came out with it for my Kindle! The similar games DO NOT COMPARE to Candy Crush! I am addicted! You will be to!!
B0036EH40Q|5.0|The best western movie,  in my opinion.  Val Kilmer is great as Doc Holiday, I can't forget his role in this.  &#34;I'm your Huckleberry&#34; Is one of his lines he says twice.  You will have to see it to understand what he means.  I rarely watch a movie more than once but I have watched this three times on Blu-Ray.  If you like westerns, you have to see this.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Beautifully written, moving novel. The characters are richly drawn, the story is so compelling, I hated coming to the end of it, and wished it could go on and on.
B003DXSXCI|5.0|I have watched Bullitt at least 8 times and love it each time.  It never gets old and McQueen is great.
B00BAXFAJC|5.0|beautifully written; melodic; many intriguing characters in an interesting setting; fabulous read!  I highly recommend this exceptional book.  Next read will be the author's first book, &#34;The Rehearsal&#34;.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Does everything its designed to do at a fair price!  I have another cable for desk top, but this cable is for Laptop.
0307341577|5.0|A somehow intensely personal yet unselfconscious reverie of everyday tragedy in the most ordinary of settings.  Ms. Flynn here shows a Dostoevskiian talent, drawing every character as both lovable and loathsome in the most recognizable way:  from the aging stripper scrounging for handouts (&#34;the chips are really good here&#34;) to the loving mother whose perfect insight into her own profound passivity isn't enough to save her family.  Expect the author's signature surprise twists of plot (there are several) and excellent, understated prose.  Just great.
B002GQMA4A|4.0|The movie was as funny as I remembered. I gave four stars since the quality didn't seem HD. Also, $3.99 is a bit much for a 18 year old movie. I'm suprised it wasn't available on Netflix.
030758836X|4.0|I adore this author, and admired this book, but it was a little too much.  The psychological profile of the key character was too complex and ultimately muddy, and in the end you really missed having someone to root for whom you could actually like.  There was a review on the back flap that called it something like Stephen King meets Scenes from a Marriage (gave away the book so can't cite it correctly), which pretty much sums it up.
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|This was a really good Bond movie with lots of action.  I enjoyed it as I have all the Bond movies through the years.
1781162646|3.0|Very readable, as expected from this author.  Light on the horror.  I haven't read King for years, was expecting something a little more exciting.
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|This edition has the authors Newberry Award speech in it, and that is a fgreat addition to the novel.  Friends and I have debated the ending of this wonderful story many times.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is addictive and fun! The levels are challenging and even though some took many tries I was never frustrated. I only wish there wasn't a limit on lives.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Wonderful and I am sure that you should read it too.  Really enjoyable and descriptions are marvelous.  Nice visualisation.<br />Done.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|I enjoy her first 2 albums. this one is going to be a good one to get if you are fan of hers.
B00EY7MFKS|5.0|One of my favorite new tv shows.  It gets better every episode.  Clark Gregg is awesome as Agent Phil Coulson!
B00009EJC5|5.0|I enjoy his music for a long time and this one is a great one to get if you are fan of his music.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I disliked the ending a lot I cried. Why? Why did you do that? Why did you have to add such a twist?
B003ASLJS6|5.0|I enjoy his westerns. this one is a great one to get if you like later westerns and his movies.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This book was creepy and deliciously disturbing like The Shining or Salem's Lot.  It was almost impossible to put down, but be careful if you read it after dark!
B00006FDCJ|5.0|This one was a great movie to get and was great to see. this is for any fan of his.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|A strange little book with an unusual cast of characters. It is a winding story, full of twists and turns, huge failures and tiny sweet successes. I found myself moving slowly through plot,some of which did not read easily, but was incredibly curious as to the fate that would befall this batch of computer geeks, inventors, and deep thinkers. Fun, surprising, and an enjoyable read..
B005ORVMT2|5.0|I got this one for my father last year and he love it. i got it for my self and it is a great box set.
B00ESY7QXI|2.0|long and boring movie. my wife and I didn't even finish this movie. what a let down on our movie night.
B0066WJLU6|1.0|Not what I excepted from this product - therefore I have deleted it from my Kindle.  It may be good for others but not for me.
0385537131|5.0|No it's more &#34;another day in the life of&#34; book.  Well done characters indeed.  If any fault I feel it would the the great detail involved in getting to the point where an end could be seen.  At times a little slow, but the detail is actually necessary in legal terms.  And the details lead the reader to a surprise ending of sorts that is.  Enjoyed the story very much.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I use this app dozens of times a day.  We live in an ever changing weather area and this is a must to have.  I love it.
B00G9B1MEM|5.0|Wacko fun. Amazing clever concept. With such complex programing &quot;clay-mation&quot; animation - so  far there have been no program glitches when playing on KindlenFire. (Although it does take a long time to load each segment). A short tutorial would have helped - but still on first level- so am sure to figure it all out as I go. To try explain the game play &amp; concept (which is a total hoot) would ruin the fun this game offers. Just check it out and have a blast !
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|This game is fantastic. Plays a lot like pre 1.2 Terraria, and I feel like they did a really good job at capturing that feel. Unlike previous mobile versions of popular games (MC:PE), this one has all the same content as the PC version (pre 1.2). The fps seems to be smooth, I love being able to choose between 5 hotbar slots and 10 and the zoom is really great. The controls have obviously been really refined, which means it shouldn't take too much time to adjust. The character creation screen is surprisingly easy to figure out and use.<br />  The gameplay is almost exactly like Terraria PC, and if you have never played that, I recommend that you look it up. For those that don't want to look it up right now, it shares quite a lot with Minecraft, including building, mining, ores and more. But this game also has a LOT of variations. These include lots of boss fights, TONS of monsters and friendlies, lots of ores and tools/armor, awesome biomes and much more.<br />  I highly recommend getting this game, and if you enjoy it, definitely check out Terraria PC.
B00992CF6W|1.0|Installed on Kindle HDX 64GB.  Force Closing just seconds after loading a new map and trying to cut a tree with hands.  WTH???!!!!
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Great game would have got five stars if there wasn't. a couple issues.The games got good traffics. and a good story line. A good way to pass the time.
B001TH16DI|5.0|This is a Christmas gift for a Star Trek fan that never upgraded to Blu-ray.<br />Unless there is a problem with a DVD it should be perfect.
B00DWFQ2N4|5.0|This good have been conceived as a cheap shot, but, Mr. Timberlake proves why &#34;The 20/20 Experience Pts. 1 & 2&#34; are the albums of the year. Led by the compelling tip of the hat to New York City, &#34;Take Back the Night&#34;.
B009LQKHIO|3.0|this novel is a simple yet well thought story with just enough romance but still has true substance to it
B000005Z0E|5.0|The double layering of his flows and rhymes was suspect.....but, this debut signaled the arrival of a major new talent. Easily the #1 hip hop artist in pure commercial efforts, surpassing the even more prolific. L.L. Cool J. But &#34;2pacalypse Now&#34; is a rough, angry cinematic effort that keeps it real.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book although I had a sneaking suspicion as to how it would end- and I was right.  If you are looking for an easy read with good character development and love, then this is your book.  Not to say it isn't sad, but the book it worth the read.  Perhaps one gains a new understanding into the minds and hearts of the disabled, or a relationship that can develop between wto very needy people who find hope in one another.  I found myself anxious to read to the end, which is a beautiful testament to love and what &#34;it&#34; can help to conquer.
B00114RKT8|5.0|It is the most wonderful movie about the true origin of the song &#34;AMAZING GRACE&#34; which occurred in Great Britain in the early part of the 1800's.  Please rent this...it is emotional, parts are funny, parts are sad.. It is a must see!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it! Best game for a person that likes horses. You get to take care of your own horse, like brushing, feeding, cleaning the pen, etc.... I really do love this game! I always loved horses and always wanted to get one but I haven't got one yet, but I  love this game it's like talking care of a real horse just on a kindle fire HD. &lt;3 :) :D
B001AUEMFS|5.0|It's good music.  By now, however, it's classic rock, not cutting edge ;-)  My review is a bit late.  I probably bought it shortly after it was released.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|Easy to use. Love the point and shoot method. For a person who hates  being in front of a camera...this is a fun app.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun challenge. I have had to get help a couple of times. Looking forward to more levels. Will continue to play.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy Crush Saga is intriguing and interesting at the same time.  It gets my adrenalin going every time.  I also like when I score higher than my friends on Facebook.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|you only get so many lives and it always want you to connect to facebook friends to continue to new sections or to get extras.
B004TSXUWY|5.0|let me first start by saying wow! Ambition leads to lust, which in turn leads to the protagonist suffering Amnesia as a consquence of her ambitious lust. To achieve success by writing a firs novel is very good. It is however the very same success that drives the writer away from her husband, leaving him with little time for his wife and child while she prefers to overcome her writers block to her second novel by sitting it out at a cafe, and then being lured by a stranger to a lusty entanglement, the actions of which result in heronAmnesia. As the saying goes \\"Nothing in Life comes easy\\" and i must definitely asy hats off to S. J. Watson for so intuitively entangling the reader in the Protagonist Amnesia until the reader is about 3/4's of the way through the novel that the realisation dawns on the reader that the Protagonist so called Husband is Actually the Amorous Entanglement at the Coffe Shop the Protagonist decided to cut off. The best Part of it all is that the Wrter has complimentarily mirrored himself as the Protagonist. By Choosing the Title \\"Before I Go to Sleep\\" the writer is enticing the prospective buyer/reader to really read his novel which once the reader has set eyes on the book, is so engrossed and entangled in the plot, i must use the word unputdownable. S.J. Watson, the writer has really put a lot of effort into this novel, by trying very hard to induce into the reader(s) mind a sense of Anterograde Amnesia as the reader progress through the first 3/4's of the novel.
B001MVYUPC|5.0|This is a must see movie and a worthwhile addition to anyones video library.  You will want to watch this movie again and again.
B00G32OER4|5.0|I saw this movie at the theater and I loved it so much that when I saw it on Amazon I decided to watch it again. It is very scary if you watch it in the dark at night right before you fall asleep. I dare you to watch it!
B0032UYFA6|5.0|It's the best TV show i have ever seen. if you haven't seen it-get it!  I promise you won't be sorry
B0055OG2BC|5.0|How many people (and animals) played &#34;007&#34; ?  You'll find out in this hilarious treatment of our favorite spy. While in<br />production, there was a bit of a rift between Peter Sellers and Orson Wells, which made the final sequences a bit<br />rough for the editor.  Still, its fun to watch and has a cast of wonderful stars.  Just so you know, there are three Casino<br />Royals to date. The original black and white starring &#34;Jimmy Bond&#34;, this one and the newly released one with our<br />current James Bond.  They really ought to put them in a set!
B003H4I4JU|5.0|Not really similar subject matter but a better scifi story. And I didn't see the whole thing coming in advance, which is always nice.
B0018LMZOO|5.0|Used to replace an old vinyl record. Just nice clear sound.  I'm upgrading my collection from the old 33's and CD's will be around awhile.
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|An excellent app and very simple to use.  Some.&quot;complain&quot; about the app's ability to clear the browser's cache - a trivial issue considering that can be accomplished by accessing that feature with browser settings on Kindle Fire HD.  The only caveat with operation of this app is no more than those found with similar operating systems utilities - being mindful of what files you are actually modifying or deleting.
B0018LMZO4|5.0|Grew up with this in the 70's and needed to upgrade from my vinyl copy.  Good to hear the music again without the<br />his and pop of the record.
B00EDF43MY|5.0|my kids love this app it has almost everything a real airport has. except the TSA  shake down. baggage claim lost and found. keeps them entertained
B0059XTV4Y|5.0|This story is the most romantic thing I have ever heard.  Thanks to Madonna we get a tender perspective on the sacrifice that was made for the sake of true love.  If you like romance this ones a winner.
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|Fire Maple games have usually impressed me.  This one was balanced in fun, thinking, and searching.  Graphics were beautiful and story line was ok (well, it's never complex).
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|my little boy loves it. just a little better than the first.  just a great game. very good. woo hop.
0743270754|5.0|A well written, if voluminous history of a important time in America. LIncoln was truly caring, very intelligent and politically savvy.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|Only had this app 30 mins and already love it... can't believe it's free!<br />I am totally hooked at checking out other users pics.  And can see the various effects this app can do in them.  Can't wait to do my own black &amp; white pic to &quot;color splash&quot; too!
B002BWQ6H6|5.0|It took my breath away. Truly a page turner. The lives of several people in NYC intersect and blend in heart wrenching ways.
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|This is my 2nd all time favorite 3d movie!(#1 Avatar)<br />Ive  seen PR 5 times now including at the theaters. Next to the matrix which ive seen 15 times
B003H3IOLE|5.0|This book has lasting charm. A coming of age story with caring but flawed parents. Timeless topics in the human condition.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I'll be honest I was not sure if I would like this book. I did not love the first book.  Katniss rubbed me the wrong way I know there are people who dislike her in this book but she felt more human to me on this one and not  like her age.  Overall I liked the book it was not predictable not everyone makes it to the end and son  of what I would never suspect. I do think my bad attitude towards the first book  is partial due to delving into it right after reading Game of Thrones. I was to use to the extreme delving into characters the writing  style is so different. I went into this one and the last with a different attitude and it helped. So yes overall  I did enjoy this book any book that ends with me crying has some merit.
B00D6B4PUG|4.0|It's okay - could have used the one that came with the kindle.<br />I don't think it's really necessary for the kindle.
B00B0LPYXG|4.0|It was alright, not what I would consider on of Denzel Washington's best movies (plot), but as his skills as an actor were very good.
B005HEPIDS|5.0|compelling.  So many important themes and issues of the day examined in this series!  Love Janeway, Seven, Paris, Belana, the Doctor & Harry!!
B001XUPGLY|5.0|Perhaps the most enjoyable as it took us &#34;back&#34; in time and created the most humorous situations of all the Star Trek movies.
0345533666|3.0|I haven't read it as yet.  My sister gave it a high recommendation that is why I ordered it.  Looking forward to reading it.
B00CL0J99K|5.0|Excellent movie so much going on you have to watch it several times to see everything.  I have the set and it is fun to watch them all in a day
0399255370|5.0|I gave this to my grandson yesterday.  He made me read it right away.  He loves the colors and the illustrations are great!
0439023513|1.0|I enjoyed the first two books and was liking the third. That is, up until I got to the end of chapter 24.  Suddenly, everything was over!!!  I couldn't believe it. You just meet this interesting character in chapter 23 (Tigris) and you are looking forward to how Katniss is going get to Snow. Then Wham!!!  It's over. I couldn't believe it. What was the point of Katniss and her group even being there at all?  I  had been wondering how things were going to work, considering I was almost to the end of the book.  Well, I know now.  The last three chapters of the book are just a weird, dreamlike, depressing &#34;finally&#34;, with a lot left hanging that could have been developed. From chapter 24  ...could have been a whole other fourth book! ... with a much more interesting and powerful ending. Instead, it was a very pointless and disappointing end, to what could have been a great series.  It almost made me sorry that I had even started reading the Hunger Games. It is like the author just got tired of writing the series and ended everything as abruptly as possible.  I think she missed an opportunity of a lifetime. So although I was enjoying the book up until chapter 24, I am giving it only one star because of how the author brought this promising series to its end. (I haven't seen the movies, but I hope they somehow create a better ending than this.)
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This app has kept my Kindle Fire HD running at optimum levels. It even gives  you reminders to clean out junk files to boost memory. I am very happy that I downloaded it and will be getting this app for my smart phone as well.
B00A6CCF0K|2.0|I could not finish it at this time. The beginning started out fine with excitement then found it boring it just jumped around and I lost interest.  Maybe later I'll go back to it after a spell but for right now I need a fast pace moving novel.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|When I first played this game on my cousins iPad it was like love at first sight &lt;3. So I got this game on my tablet.
B00DQQSD3G|5.0|Terrific and extremely thorough...more journalistic than &#34;puff piece&#34; and the enhancements make one wish all &#34;Making of...&#34; movie books were done this way.<br />A great value, a great resource for not just SW fans, but any cinema fan who likes a good peek behind the curtain...
B000FCKRDI|3.0|I liked this book more than the previous two in the Wallflowers series, probably because the couple both have such dramatic character arcs. Sebastian is truly an ass at the start of this book, but redeems himself in a way that is entertaining if not particularly original. Evie transforms from a timid, stuttering mouse to a strong, stubborn woman. And this book introduces Cam Rohan of the Hathaways series (which I love so much more than the Wallflowers), though it pisses me off that in this book he's always described as 'the boy' though we're told he's twenty-five. That seems racist to me (given his Romany heritage), like calling black people &#34;boy&#34; even when they are fully grown men.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|When I first received the Chromecast it was great. One of the best products I have ever purchased. The price was cheap as well. Now I am guessing why. After about two months of it working stellar it started having issues. Now it won't play anything. It freezes for any video or google music. I am in the military and I am stationed in Germany. I bought this product and it had no problem shipping out here but now I am told that it is not supported out here so that is my issue. They will not replace it and no refunds. While the person who I spoke to on the help line was really nice and seemed to try to help, nothing was done. No fix actions just basic troubleshooting which I had already tried. Usually Google products are great and they back them up, but I guess not this one. Buyer Beware.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|This series is cracktastic: I like it a lot, while I'm reading, I'm transported, but when I put the book down and reflect on it rationally, I know it's just glorified Twilight-spawn. (Glorified because the author, Deborah Harkness, is a history professor rather than a hausfrau with a laptop and a dream.) Diana is a total Mary Sue, supposedly a genius scholar despite being Too Stupid To Live and a brilliant witch even though she can't do the most basic spells. Matthew is infuriatingly aloof and overbearing. They do supernatural yoga together, which is just too twee. Harkness also devotes an unforgivable amount to text to telling us about Diana's wardrobe and dining decisions, without any relevance to the plot. I can't actually explain what I like about this, but while I'm reading, it feels so good!
B0067R0APK|1.0|I loved this app until the recent version.  Nice interface, plenty of detail, worked well.  Every time I select a specific hour to see more detail I just get the infinity circle.  They also did away with the arthritis information.  Fail.  I would no longer recommend this app.
B00AKKGX4W|4.0|The first time I read this, I loved it. The second time, though, I read it on the heels of re-reading Milan's Turner trilogy, and in my opinion, The Duchess War isn't quite as strong as those books. Courtney Milan can always be counted upon to write a smart, well-plotted story with complex, compelling characters, and this book is no exception... It just didn't hit my sweet spot as hard as Milan's books usually do.<br /><br />Wilhelmina &#34;Minnie&#34; Pursling, aka Minerva Lane, is living a life of quiet desperation in Victorian Leicester. She was a chess prodigy in childhood and, at her father's urging, masqueraded as a boy so that she could compete in elite international competitions. Her life unraveled at 12, when her father was arrested for fraud and inexplicably blamed her for his misdeeds at his public trial. (This part of the backstory never really made much sense to me; one of the problems I had with the story.) Long story short, the crowd turned on Minerva, actually stoning her like a righteous mob, leaving her permanently scarred and terrified of crowds. Following this ordeal, Minnie changed her identity and now lives in obscurity with two spinster aunts who may or may not be closeted lesbians. She hides her intellectual light under a barrel and aspires only to the respectable security of marriage to a disinterested man. (There's another problem: if Minnie is so smart, I don't think she'd have believed an unhappy marriage would provide the sanctuary she craves.)<br /><br />Robert Blaisdell, Duke of Clermont, had a childhood as miserable as Minnie's: his father was a cruel and manipulative man who used his position to rape and pillage with impunity. (Robert's best friend is actually his half-brother, the product of his father's rape of a governess; the two boys met at Eton years before.) Robert's mother could not live with his father, so left him even though it meant abandoning Robert, too. Now grown, Robert is determined to right his late father's wrongs: he is in Leicester to make amends to workers at a factory his father ran into the ground decades before.<br /><br />The dialogue between the characters is sharp and funny (perhaps Courtney Milan's greatest strength), and some of the supporting characters are great fun, especially sequel-bait Sebastian and Violet. That said, the plot of this book wasn't as tight or as plausible as I would have liked: it felt contrived, as if Milan mapped out in advance the way she wanted the story to go, and then had to wrestle characters and events into submission in order to follow the plan.he is in Leicester to make amends to workers at a factory his father ran into the ground decades before.<br /><br />The dialogue between the characters is sharp and funny (perhaps Courtney Milan's greatest strength), and some of the supporting characters are great fun, especially sequel-bait Sebastian and Violet.

B00FGJNS72|2.0|No support. No confirmation that program had upgraded my previous version on my Android. Waste of money Three exchanged E-Mails and then they gave up.
B00G725UZA|5.0|Just adds to the content on the original disc.  What I really like is that I could buy this bonus material without having to rebuy the original (since I already had it).  The remixes are great, as is the new material.
0439023513|4.0|The book Mockingjay by Susan Collins is a truly astonishing book. Since it is the third and final book of The Hunger Games series it ties up all the loose ends, however some of them didn't end like people wanted it to. In the beginning of this book district 12 gets bombed by the Capitol. Very few make it out of the district alive however Gale, Katniss, Prime Rose, her Mother, and Buttercup the cat all make it out. Everybody in the district thought that Peeta was dead. They thought the capital had taken him in captivity. Those who made it out of district 12 had to move to district 13. People had thought district 13 didn't exist anymore. Everyone from 13 had just moved underground. Since 12 had to move to 13 they had to start living like the people in 13. One of the main settings in the book was 13 underground. Everyday the people had to eat, bath, and get their schedule. That was just about all they did. Another part of the plot Is when Katniss made her list of requests. ( hunting was one of the most important things on there.) One of the most important conflicts and resolutions of the story is when Katniss becomes the Mockingjay. At first she was very resistant, however she was made to become the Mockingjay. This is what she was meant to symbolize.
B00DL2W7Q4|4.0|It is full of interesting stories, told in its peculiar way, Gladwell style, where you are misled at first focusing your attention on some characteristics of subjects to be surprised later on when you discover that the outcomes are always a product of other factors usually underestimated
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Its one of the best television series that I have ever seen. Absolutely amazing! Its like watching three fantastic shows at once because of the different and complex relationships in the house.<br /><br />I wish that the seasons were longer and that there were more of them!  Waiting a year to watch it again is brutal!
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Even if you have your play lists set up on you tube, you need a data connection to watch them.  With this app the file is stored locally, so I can watch mine even on the subway. With an HDMI cable, on the big flat screen.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Fabulous book! Perhaps because I have recently lost a dog, I really connected to the story. Mr Stein has a good understanding of both dogs and racing cars - and the people around them.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I started reading the first w/some sense of misgiving. But the younguns at the office were reading it and so I downloaded book 1 on my Kindle. I bought book 2. It kept my interest and I had to buy book 3
B00F91SCXC|3.0|Acting is just okay and as good as it get's from Brad Pitt who is a horrible actor. Movie was so fast and furious but they never did capture my full attention, so it was entertaining to a degree, but not great at all. I bought it because it was $ 0.99 and worth that price. I would have been upset to pay the original $4.99 for it.
B004T32SOK|1.0|this was not what I was looking for and I have uninstalled it to my Kindle. I need a way to tap into my computer's cloud from my Kindle
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I completely enjoyed watching the entire season of Downton Abbey on my I-pad.  I was able to work on other projects while catching up on one of my favorite shows.  The show is well cast and produced with a great storyline.
B00BHWG3GU|1.0|Out dated. Was expecting more original and instrumental, not vocal. Also, the recording leaves a lot to be desired. It plays as if recorded in someones living room with equipment from Target.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|It's a fun game but waiting for extra lives means I will rarely play the game. If I didn't have to wait I'd probably get addicted, but I have no patience.

B003AYMZO2|5.0|Only on episode 5.  Can't stop watching it.  If your not hooked on this series, you should be.  You have to start with season 1.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Pretty bad follow on to what was a good series.  Story is boring and unimaginative.  Roth appears to be just going through the motions just to sell another book.

B0091REZMW|3.0|Fun game. Energy gets used up fast and the rooms get very, very repitisious. You need diamonds and unless you want to spend real money it takes a very long time to get anywhere in the game. Great if you want to kill some time but that's it.

B00DUGCLY4|5.0|Great game. Some of the clues are really tough! You need to keep your thinking cap nearby and be ready to think outside the box for this one!
145210655X|5.0|I had already bought my daughter Vader's Little Princess when I came across this one here on Amazon. She is 8 and absolutely loves the simple writing but detailed artwork in the book. Definitely a purchase I would never regret!
B004EBZX6W|4.0|I can't really say except that I have had no issues or concerns as yet.  I figure if there is something that may help me in even a small way, then it is for me.  A little more protection....
B00BD99JMW|3.0|No spoilers here; I didn't mind the plot but the book was just plain boring compared to the first two. I wanted to yell \\"get on with it\\" when I was  only halfway through.
B000UZNRS2|5.0|Very fast paced.  A story that held my attention so that I could not put it down.  Wonderful character development with personal stories  cris crossing wonderfully without bogging down the story.
B000ZG5S4M|5.0|I just love this sound track!! The use of the typewriter in some of the songs is my favorite. If you've seen the movie and liked it, you'll love the soundtrack....if you haven't seen the movie you'll still like the soundtrack.
B00F88H5K2|4.0|Totally entertaining, and the leading men are fantastic and have great chemistry together. Matt Damon is physically and emotionally gorgeous. I missed seeing Michael Douglas carry a movie, and in this he is a power house. Scott Bakula, Dan Akroyd, and Rob Lowe deliver big time as well. Rob Lowe's character is hilarious. You do feel the heart break of Scott Thurston and the frustration he must have gone through, as it seems that Liberace dispenses with his relationships like some people dispense with their outdated laptops, minus the attorney. Ouch! Crazy this was not a movie house film, as the production value is terrific. Artful direction. Kudos to HBO for doing it. For me, the added bonus was the Pretty Perky Peggy King clip of her singing &#34;When Liberace Winks At Me.&#34; Her daughter was my best friend growing up, and I remember her telling me about that song which was a big hit. Peggy King is alive and well with fabulous singing chops and performing in Philly.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I used it often for 9 months and then for some reason it stopped working. I'd like to have it again. It was a great game.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Martin continues to introduce characters that you are immediately drawn into and desire to follow.  This book diverges from the previous books by bringing the other side of his world into focus.  The final conflict is coming and learning all the players in the Game is captivating!
B00FAI2IUM|3.0|This game is decent but it's kind of like real racing 3 the only difference is that you car has less traction when you drive. But if I had to choose I would play real racing 3. Another difference is that you don't have to make repairs but you still have to wait for upgrades on your car to finish. So overall this game is alright but I would choose real racing 3 over it
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Great! Love this game. Must have. I fight with my husband over this game. The graphics are awesome. This is my first ever review.
B00B22ASUM|4.0|I love books about animals and their people. The story has to be true. The Lord has put these little animals on the,earth for us<br />To care for,but sometimes I think it gets turned around and they take care of us.<br />This is a wonderful book and I would recommend it to anyone who loves animals or a good read about people and animal behavior
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Entertaining, story moves along smoothly, characters are believable, happy ending. However, there was a lot of repetition of events and scenes.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|Now that I've read it, I can't believe it's taken me so long to do it. One of the best books I have read and even though I was some what familiar with the story it was incredibly surprising.<br />Most underrated hero's in literature.

B001NLKXK2|4.0|Very insightful into the dreaded disease, early onset dementia.  God bless any and all that get/have it and their families.  What courage someone has to have to be tested, unbelievable.  Laughed and cried for all involved, love the ending!
B00BAXFECK|5.0|The Goldfinch is not the normal genre that I tend to read... I generally go for suspense, crime fiction.... Lisa Gardner, Karin Slaughter, Tami Hoag, etc.  After reading the NY Times review as well as of the of The goldfinch, I had to pick it up.<br /><br />I absolutely loved it! I would read pages any chance that I had. Tartt's detail and beautifully wrought descriptions of everythi9ng n the book was a joy to read!
B00F91RYL8|5.0|Scary, suspenseful, quick moving movie that I will probably want to watch again. Heard it was good but this topped expectation.
B00BWLKTOS|5.0|This was as good as the first one. I do enjoy the way they put the  music together. Their work is very much appreciated.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|I find a lot of sessions on Ted to be inspirational and a source for new thinking (an oasis I often seek out when I am in need).

0792858522|5.0|West Side Story<br />Natalie Wood<br /><br />Arrived quickly and well packed. Witching it brought back old times. And just as great as watching it at the movies. I would turn doen the lights, turn the sound up,made popcorn and watched it again for the first time.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|The Avengers is Hotter than tea. Sweeter than honey. Of course it made lots of money but the main thing here is that it is a well written, well directed and produced, well acted film. Definitely a comic book and movie fan's dream come true. I can't wait to the Avengers 2. First Class stuff.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|The The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey (Blu-ray/DVD + UltraViolet Digital Copy.<br /><br /> Arrived on time and well packed. And is now a wonderful addition to my movie library. Great watching for me and my kids. Great color.

Before you look at the rest, start with the best.There will only be one Bruce Lee and there is only one Enter the Dragon. Even with the wonderful Donnie Yen and the Ip Man Movies. Bruce Lee's movies is the standard. Donnie Yen is a Bruce Lee fan and have studied Bruce since his youth. Enter the Dragon and Bruce Lee's talent has stood the test of time. Check out the Best then check out the rest. Long live Bruce Lee.

B001AQO3QA|5.0|I am a huge Alien and Predator fan. This Alien Boxset is awesome. The quality of the prints are impressive and well as the sound. These films stand up against anything you put in front of them. They have often been imitated but never duplicated. If you have seen them before, see them again. If you haven't seen them before here is your opportunity to do so. This Alien Boxset if in my top five sci-fi boxsets that I own. You can't lose if this set is what you choose. Cheers
B00BFPX132|5.0|Sodom is one of my favorite thrash metal bands. This album is very good and I like specially, because the bass guitar sound is powerful. In my personal opinion, I prefer this album compared to &#34;In War and Pieces&#34;.
B00867GJYK|5.0|Simply put. This is one Awesome movie. Definitely one of the all time greats. Doesn't get any better than this.
B003INBNXO|5.0|Ip Man is two movies in one. The first half is almost slapstick Kung Fu Theater, and the second is a more serious darker tale of the Japanese invasion of China. Both elements work very well, and Donnie Yen is fantastic. The final fight between Ip Man and the Japanese general is not to be missed by any martial arts fan. Truly fantastic movie making.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Not predictable. Just when I thought I knew what was coming next this book would take another turn. Couldn't wait to sit down and read to see what happened next. Clever and a wild insight into a truly mad mind.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|Absolutely amazing game. I just bought it for my xbox two days ago and have literally been playing it non stop. i wanted to be able to play it on the go so I was psyched when I found this version. Don't hesitate just get it now!!!
B0089LOG02|5.0|Almost too predictable, but still enjoyed every minute of it. Well-written, heartfelt, good characters, and lessons and philosophical musings. I had never heard of the orphan trains before, so I gained a bit of history. Hope you enjoy!!

B00BD99JMW|1.0|I have been looking forward to this most recent installment of the Divergent series since the release of Insurgent. I am sad to say that this is a disappointed turn for the series. Both the writing and story development were seriously lacking in comparison to Divergent. I had hoped Veronica Roth would turn out a series as captivating as the Hunger Games, but I will not be wasting my time or money on the rest of the books in this series. So poorly written I could barely force myself to finish the novel.<br /><br />Leave the series after reading Divergent and move onto greener pastures.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I will start this by repeating,\\"SPOILER ALERT!\\" That is what every review that gives away the ending should always have either in the title or early in the review itself. I am usually very careful about looking for those words before reading a review. This time I was not so lucky. So... (SPOILER ALERT!) I knew that Tris did not survive before I started reading the book. That being said, this is an example of \\"It is not the destination, but the journey that matters.\\" The journey in this case was for the most part worth it. I did have a hard time remembering some key characters from the two previous novels. Maybe I should have re- read them, but I did not have time. I think Roth should have somehow reminded the readers where characters such as Christina came in. I also felt like Four's character was not parallel to the one in the previous novels. He was too weak. It was as if he was a different person. However, this is a great example of a dystopia novel where the idea of a \\"perfect\\" society is thwarted by the reality of how humans react. The idea of separating \\"genetically perfect\\" people from those deemed \\"genetically damaged\\" is horrible, especially when the government justifies it as a necessity for human survival. This novel makes the reader really think, which is what makes a story good. I do NOT agree with the people who think this trilogy is better than the Hunger Games series, but I will recommend it to my high school students.
B00D56ACVI|3.0|Reader, in terms of Mozart's Piano Concertos, there are any number of cycles in the marketplace which are trying to woo you.<br /><br />While there is much to be said for Barenboim's first cycle with the English Chamber Orchestra (the music-making is more spontaneously, if not more precocious, than his later traversal with the Berlin Philharmonic), it dates from the late 1960s whereas the pastiche concertos were recorded in the early Seventies.  EMI /Warner have signally failed to refurbish the set. Its status, therefore, is not in doubt.<br /><br />It's a Cougar.<br /><br />This might sound strange coming from a man who espousals the supremacy of Edwin Fischer in this domain - an uber-Cougar for sure. Even so, it's a different dynamic. One makes allowances for historic recordings. Barenboim V1 demands to be judged with more recent endeavours to the marketplace. Man, it sounds so tired and two dimensional to the point where its triumph of arms is nullified.<br /><br />In select instances, EMI used its Abbey Road Technology to remaster some of these recordings ([[ASIN:B000FTCLOE Mozart: Piano Concertos 20 & 27 - Concert Rondo K.382]]). Track these down individually rather than purchase the cycle and fall into the arms of a Cougar . . . . .

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was fantastically written. I couldn't stop reading. I laughed and I cried, but mostly laughed even though the book is based on two teenagers with cancer. It is amazing how the mind works even when you know you're going to die. A must read.

Funny as hell(but still serious), and super relevant, SEE THIS MOVIE.<br /><br />The only criticism would be that he didn't use statistics as much as he could have....ie Canadians spend 10% of their GNP to cover 100% of their population with no copays, with better general outcomes, while Americans spend ~17%GNP to cover 85% of pop with copays.
B00D8CSVLW|4.0|A good holiday read but not as good as other John Grisham novels. More of the same so quite predictable
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is a great book and easy read. I bought a copy for my mother. Gives good insight to anyone seeking and asking questions.
B009BDVD2Q|5.0|The perfect mix of memoir and instruction. Unlike a lot of other books on the process of writing, King brings you into his world first. Even in his moments of strong opinion or bias on the art of writing, you never feel as though you are being instructed on 'right' and 'wrong'. He has a strong sense of what works for him and because of the personalized accounts of his own journey through the world of writing, you are inclined to stand in support of it with him. It isn't long or lengthy, nor does it dribble on for days with a self-indulgent sense of needing to be heard. It is simply an opportunity to gaze with more intimacy into the mind of a successful writer.<br /><br />For those who like memoirs, writing, or just knowledge, I found it to be very captivating. Being given tools and techniques comes more as the icing on top rather than the point of the book. By far one of the most enjoyable books I have ever read on the subject of writing itself.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|This is the Doctor. Can't be less than 5 stars- its that good. David Tennet as the doctor is awasome, funny and intense sifi.
0385351399|3.0|Predictable ending.  Casual reading only. A lot of word to get to the end, too lengthy.  Get library copy to read.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is really one of the best games I've ever played. The only annoying thing about it is that I can't do multiplayer (kindle problem only... ?) in the way that others can't come on mine. Oh well.
B00DW1WR14|5.0|Two or three very good tunes, signature song, Swallowed Whole is best number.  Very good effort.  Able to listen over and over and not get boaring.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|I got this app on my kindle fire and I absolutely love it it comes up clear doesn't have a lot of adds and u can recreate your own account
B00BHBBSZ2|2.0|It's hard to write and it is complicated to do things u want like highlight or change the color of the writing.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is awesome and i play it all  day long. I think you should download this app because you get to unlock new characters and can get hoverboards.
B00007LTIA|4.0|Tales From Topographic Oceans is an interesting piece of work.  It is all very new to me as I just discovered Yes beyond &#34;The Yes Album&#34; and &#34;90125&#34; about six months ago.  I'll not bore you with the details.  This is their first studio release after their three monster releases of &#34;The Yes Album&#34;, &#34;Fragile&#34; & &#34;Close To The Edge&#34;, which are probably considered the Golden Age of Yes.  I've read many of the reviews and will admit I have yet to try and analyze and understand the lyrics of the music on this album.  I will say that the music and lyrics flow pretty well though.  It is obviously a Yes album.  If I'd been a Yes fan back in the early 70's, I might have been disappointed when I rushed to my local record shop and purchased this new release.  But as of right now, I think it is a pretty good album, and with the bonus tracks it's probably an even better deal.  Once I've grown to know this album in the same way I know &#34;The Yes Album&#34; or &#34;Close To The Edge&#34; I may even come back and edit this review to give it 5 Stars.  I think anyone who loves the entirety of &#34;The Yes Album&#34;, &#34;Fragile&#34; & &#34;Close To The Edge&#34; will not be disappointed with &#34;Tales...&#34;, but for those looking for FM Standards, well you may not have such an enjoyable adventure with this album.  The Music is fabulous, the lyrics...I just have yet to figure out.<br /><br />Free Hugs!!<br />  &<br />Keep A Rockin' In The Free World!!<br /><br />Changin' The World One Ear At A Tyme!!
B00AJLHUA8|5.0|I love this movie. so far this movie scare the hell out of me. when I first saw the movie in theater. When this movie first came out on DVD I just had to purchase this movie. I don't know why, but this movie is by far is the one that scared the pants off me. I so happy I bought this movie because when I have a friends night out or date night. This would be the best selection for horror to get them jumping. Just love this movie I hope they make a another but even scary and I will purchase that one as well.
B00007LTIB|4.0|Relayer is a fine work and very enjoyable to listen to.  This rating of 4 Stars could increase to 5 Stars once I've gotten just a little more familiar with its inner workings and flow.  I think anyone who likes &#34;The Yes Album&#34;, &#34;Fragile&#34; or &#34;Close To The Edge&#34; albums start to finish will like this album, though it doesn't have as many recognizable tracks...it flows well and smoothly.  For those who are looking for FM radio hits, you may not be as happy with this piece of work.  Free Hugs!!      & Keep A Rockin' In The Free World!!  Changin' The World One Ear At A Tyme!!
B0064BWE8U|4.0|I really enjoyed this book - lighthearted with surprising turns in the storyline. Would recommend for a nice light read. It is written with plenty of good humour and a touch of poignancy.
B00BEF1AEK|5.0|this app is worth it, it is so much fun, it is a great time waster to have close by when you need a quick game fix!!!
B003T0G9Y4|4.0|Enjoyed this book - frivolous nature of many of the characters make for a humorous read. Easy reading and fun.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|We've all read series` where the first book is fantastic and  the  subsequent books fail us or don't quite live up to the first. I feel like  this book was just as captivating, well written, an  edge of the seat as the first! I'm hooked and can not wait to start the third. I have a feeling a fantastic ending is on the way!
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|White Fire is a terrific stand alone Pendergast novel. Nice homage to Doyle and his creation Sherlock Holmes. Carrie's story was perfect, her skill of getting herself in trouble really made the action scenes exciting. There was also one new character that I wouldn't mind seeing again.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The story pulls you in, the characters manage to be likable even when you think you're just about ready to hate them, and every word feels handpicked, intentional, and luscious. I did find that the ending was too long and repetitive enough to get me skimming through some parts, but overall the length and level of detail seemed just right.
B005PK1G76|5.0|This organizer fits the City Mini perfectly. The velcro straps are easily adjusted around the handle of the stroller and stays put even when the stroller is collapsed.
B003U6BE8I|4.0|it brings Greek Myth to modern World with a small twist. Like drinking fruit flavored water. Coke with lemon. original story is there but small twist. great Kids and teenagers movie. Even adult can sit thru it, not bad at all
B005MMYBXI|5.0|Hate to love this series which plays to the worst in us: violence and a lot of gratuitous sex.  But Spartacus' story is enlightening even after 2,000 years and the sets and costumes transport me into ancient Italy in the most wonderful way.  The is probably the most bloody set of images I have ever seen.  I also like the way the dialog attempts to give us the flavor of Latin.  My Latin is very, very poor, but it was interesting to 'hear' the cadence of their words translated into modern English.  Did Spartacus really lose when he is still a hero after 2,000 years?  I also relish the message inherent in our fascination with this story: we are the brutal Romans of this age.  Like I said: hate to love it.
B008JFUPFI|3.0|If I did not who Superman was or I never read any of the 1960s and 1970s Superman comics, I would perhaps believe this movie was....entertaining at the least. But alas, I know real Superman. This new movie perfect liberal agenda movie presented by liberal Hollywood. In this movie, Superman's Earth father is against violence, even if you face a treat. At some point in the movie he asks Superman when some kids bullied him and Superman did not hit them or even stand up to them, Father asks &#34; Would it make you feel any better if you hurt those kids?&#34; yes, it would. They were bullying and if you do not stand up to bullies, everyone losses. Pass that this Superman is weak. he does not know what he is capable of ( even at age 33!) real Superman already has discovered himself and his powers...Finally at the end, he kills general Zoyd( or whatever his name was) right after he is upset, he is in pain because he killed this guy that who pledged to kill entire human race to rebuild his home planet. it does not get more liberal than this. Folks, if you were born 1970 or before, you will hate this movie. Special effects are great but rest......Crime against DC comics hero Superman.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Awesome!  I'm fascinated for hours!  Sometimes the cards will flip on you without being touched and you can.miss a move, though.
B007REV4YI|5.0|We loved it and think it could be the best Bond movie yet, although we were sorry to see M pass.  Looking forward to seeing the new M in the next installment.
0783225970|3.0|A classic film. This version of the film is a little light on the extras. Wish it had more extras like behind the scenes, or interviews.
B007PVHMCG|4.0|This was a gift for my 9 year old son. He was THRILLED. I am happy that he was happy but this set is VERY small. Not what you typically get for $35 Lego dollars. I think Minecraft has kept a tight corner on anything bearing their trademark.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I've been waiting for them to come out with this for kindle ever since they announced it... I'm so happy it's here
0451232852|3.0|Given its length, I would have expected it to more effectively weave the plot around real characters and historical events. Some of the characters are flat and uninspiring. Follett could have done a better job of singly some characters out for special treatment.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|i found out about this through Paul Colligan and was blown away. You connect this to an HDMI port on your TV. Download an app from iTunes Store, and then you can transmit whatever is on your laptop or iPad screen to the TV. I recently attended a weekend of Internet Marketing training and can now see the programs on my 50&#34; TV.
B002BWP49C|5.0|Enjoyed this once I saw part on TV.  It was worth getting because there was so much I missed on TV and this filled in better.  Worth the buy.
B008602KQI|5.0|Overall, the movie was pretty good. You got to see what the characters looked like in real life. I really liked the movie also because the moviemakers added some parts here and there. For example, ther is no rebellion in district 11 in the book, yet the movie shows district 11 rebeling after Rue dies.<br /><br />I loved the movie, it was very vivid.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|Really good story, enjoyed it a lot. Hope they make a movie soon, I would go see that as well.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|This seems fun. My daughter was playing it. She stopped. I don't play much. Now I have to use the amount of words they want. This is crap, crap, crap, crap. I'm done!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I've found Dragonvale to be exactly what I wanted in a kindle fire game, passive to but very interesting. The mechanics are are good and the game doesn't force you to buy currency even though the option is there which is even better. Plus the graphics are cute.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|The different story lines were a little hard to follow at first-so many different characters. But it was a good read.
1451666179|5.0|What can I say? This is Allie at her best. Even though we have seen some of this material before, it's still worth a re-read. And considering some of the subject matter, it's kind of nice to be able to curl up on the sofa not plugged into anything and peruse. It will definitely be on my &#34;to give&#34; gift list for the upcoming holiday season.
B005MLOKXA|4.0|Enjoying the second season alot.  Alicia has progressed to a formidable opponent in the courtroom and a definite asset to the corporation.  Kalista is a secretive about herself as ever and a clever researcher.  The courtroom cases are about average, some more interesting than others.  Really enjoyed Michael J. Fox.
B002HSSAY6|1.0|It was horrible and pointless. Neither my husband nor me ever had a clue what it was about. I wouldn't recommend to anyone!
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|As he ages, Denzel takes on new facets of personality and can portray evil as well as good.  He is an incredibly human character in this film, which kept me on the edge of my seat.  Well done.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Yet another complex plot masterfully constructed.  Although you are told enough about Book 1 to follow the plot, reading the books in order puts you among the inner circle of these wonderful characters - and what an inner circle it is.  What I find odd, however, is how a male author can have such a strong female sensibility.  What a loss that he is no longer here to weave his wonderful tales.
B0030HOHU4|5.0|Oldman is a giant of an actor.  All other characters play around him.  This film is as realistic to the Journal of Jonathan Harker as any other film ever made of Dracula.  All others can be disregarded as Hollywood trash with the exception of Bela Lagosi's early film. That is definitely a classic in the true sense though not a true portrayal of Stoker's incredible tale.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I say stories because this is an excellent book of a person interviewing people all over the world telling their own stories of the zombie apocalypse. This is nothing like the movie and in my opinion, it's much better.<br /><br />The level of detail of each person's account will make you believe this really happened and that the author travel to each location to know the specifics of each country and culture. Makes you believe that this book took years of experience and travel to write. I highly recommend to anyone - not just zombie lovers but anyone who likes a great set of stories.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Although I've heard a lot of negative comments about the book, I absolutely loved it.  Without giving away too much, it shocked me. I have gone over the situation numerous times in my head and I can't think of it going any other way than what it did without changing the characters.  But I absolutely love it.  It's thrilling, a tear jerker, and definitely a game changer in post-apocalyptic books.
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|A journey through time with a great set of characters and compelling story. One of Clark's greatest stories. If you're a fan of his then you should definitely read this book!
B009LDD4V4|5.0|I have really enjoyed this series, and the eight season did not disappoint!  I am looking forward to the next season to see how they handle the &#34;cliff hanger&#34;
B001U0HBPG|4.0|Second copy of this movie.  Interesting story line of growing younger instead of older.  Love the southern feel of the movie.
B00CGNYDIE|5.0|I am not much of a game player as I don't have quick reflexes or good coordination.  This game has no time limit and allows all the time I need to figure out which color the various hex blocks should be.  It is nice that you can clear the solution and then solve it again.  One thing I noticed is there is a &#34;brown&#34; color that is very close to red.  I am not color blind, but had difficulty telling these apart until I figured this out.  My biggest complaint is there aren't more puzzles!
B00AHJL7BK|5.0|I love games like this! I am a big Sudoku fan, so this game gives a nice twist to the original game. I highly recommended playing this game.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|I have enjoyed this series a bunch.  I really looked forward to getting this season and was not disappointed!  I am looking forward to the next season as well, don't know how I'll wait a whole year!
B008602KQI|5.0|Was close to the book as I have evere seen. Jennifer lawrence and woodey harrelson are fabulous  You will love it.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Just started, great game so far. Wished you didn't have to use the gems to finish a collection. Has many games to play with different places to chose from
B00EKQ3YZI|5.0|This is NOT a rehash of famous Donna Summer songs done as they were done originally. Buy one of the Greatest Hits albums if you want that.  This IS a whole new look at some of Donna's famous songs, re-imagined for today's dancers and electronica lovers. Some remixes I like more than others, but in general this is a really good album. Many of the remixes KICK BUTT! Giorgio, Chris Cox,  Afrojack, Gigamesh and Frankie Knuckles are especially wonderful. AND you get a brand new song by Donna herself! (Thank you Giorgio for your special touch with that. It's beautiful!!)
0307341550|5.0|go ahead and buy her other2 books at the samw time...will save you a trip to bookstore..start with Gone Girl
B003H4I4JU|4.0|And here I thought that \\"Ender' s Game\\" was a powerful book. Card has improved on \\"Game\\" and gave us more insight into our beliefs and ways will being entertaining. Ender reflects humanity's dreams and desires. Card lays bare our faults as well.  Our need to be dominate and our need to be right no matter what. He lays these out and dares us to learn and grow past them.
B00CGNYDIE|3.0|This game isn't as engaging as I had hoped.  The colors of the images are beautiful, and there is a bit of logic involved, but it seems that it could largely be played as a guessing game.  The directions are long and complicated, and the game isn't as addictive as I had thought it would be based on other reviews. This is an okay game to play when you need something that is entertaining, but will  not consume you as it involves determining the secret color of various tiles based on the tiles around it.
B00FPGV3RS|4.0|I thought this movie had some very good slap stick comedy.  The under lining drama aspects that come with this was good and added to the movie in a way that's hard to do and still remain a good comedy but they did it very well.  The best thing I can say is that I've rewatched this several times and it's still funny.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I thought the ending was beautiful. Sad, tragic, not what I wanted, yes. But a person who is willing to lay down their life for love, rather than lay down their life because of guilt, that's truly beautiful. Well done Veronica.
B00G32OER4|5.0|I slept with the lights on. I was seriously freaked out, and I loved every moment.  It was a great ghost story!
B000VYX8PE|5.0|This book I personally  think is good for all ages. If you like mystery and ones that have new words you may have not of known before, this book is for you.
B000ICRKLM|5.0|Tell us why you chose this rating? Well, there is really only one answer I can give, only one word that sums up my feelings about this show: yes.
B00FXMGI0G|5.0|Really liked the first one, Red 2 is even better.<br />Hope they continue with a 3rd Red movie.<br />The characters are hilarious + Mary Louise Parker is perfect for this movie.<br />John Malchovich's character Marvin is the best.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|As everyone who has tried this game knows, it can be addictive.  If you want to complete each level, you must plan ahead.  It's easy in the beginning, but you soon lose your 3 lives before you've completed the higher levels.
B008FTAAG2|5.0|Probably their strongest album as a whole really no weakness. Seem to have figured out what their voice truly is.
B003WUYR6I|4.0|The main character, a defense lawyer, is hired by the prosecutor's office to try a 24-year-old murder of a 12-year-old girl.  The defendant has been in prison for this crime, but the appeals court overturned the conviction & it has to be retried.  Most of the people involved are dead or missing.  Lincoln enlists his ex-wife, a prosecutor, and his half brother to help him.  A lot of twists & turns that hold your interest.
B0084TWN9K|4.0|Lovely stories but there is a sameness of tone that keeps them from reaching my notion of outstanding.<br />Evocative use of language, and I guess that's what the best fiction is all about. Munro has already established herself with a wide following and this award winner will please them.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It's a lot of fun playing this game especially since most of my friends on Facebook are on there and it is a lot of fun beating them!
0307588343|1.0|My 1 star rating is based on my expectation that it was going to be as good as those 2 books.  It is not.  This book is not thoroughly researched and quotes are not sourced.<br /><br />More frustrating is the author's constant insistence that he and a small group of people predicted the housing crisis and tried heroically to save the company while others put their heads in the sand. Such claims need evidence,  but there is none.<br /><br />There are some interesting sections but is unreadable because the author insists on returning to this self serving theme.
B00G4A6VZS|1.0|i love stack the states and have waited so long for this to come out. i tried over 5 times to download it but it kept saying that there was an error while downloading. now i have 1.99 down the drain for this. i really need some help amazon!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book was good at first you have no idea how the different stories will connect but in the end they all connect so well.
B00EA8UEZ4|5.0|The third book by Garry, to me, gives digested essence of the teaching of ACIM. It also summarizes and kindly repeats ideas revealed in his first two books. Great book, a must read to all ACIM students.
B000NIVJGI|3.0|I love this movie. I was hoping for the extended version that I watched on tv. Should have read the discription better.
B008220DIC|5.0|Superlative acting.  The research behind this was excellent, as it captures the narcissistic personality style and the dependent persons whom are susceptible to suggestion that follow them.
B009V3KKXY|5.0|Really cool designs and great instructions for creating your own paracord bracelets and key chains. Don't settle for the same old boring bracelet.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Well, as,others have stated, it's not Apple TV.  For the most part, you are just telling the chromecast what to stream. Would be nice to have more services (Amazon Prome, etc) that you could use directly for iPad, but the workaround is not too bad.  I suspect there will be more options with time.  It's worth the money, but not much more.
B00E193TM2|3.0|It's ok, definitely no their best.  I'd recommend just getting a few songs, the whole album drags on after a while, and I don't see the point of the last 2 or 3 'alternate' versions at the end)
B00BSB2AE4|4.0|The dog sections are amazingly funny.  The depression section not so much.  Either way good and easy read when you just want to laugh.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Basically I liked the third book.....sometimes, I think the 1st book in any series is the best....I felt a little confusion with the characters in the beginning of the 3rd book...I had to remember who was who, due to having read the second book, some time ago....a little sad with the ending....I can see another book with this series....
B005CM1IMU|3.0|I bought it because I was going to see it live locally. it was OK but a little weird. It did hold my interest so I gave it 3 stars. I don't get why this is a cult movie?
B003AYMZO2|5.0|Unpredictable, acting is awesome.  Walter's character is ever changing, makes you think about your own life and what you would do.
B005UKJX4E|4.0|It only feels like an eon while watching this film.<br /><br />Believe it or not, it took me over a year to get through this movie.  I am completely serious.  I recorded it on &#34;free&#34; TV, and I've watched bits and pieces where I've been able.  One year later, I finally watched the credits role.  And while I give this film a 4, those credits were as welcome as a cooked turkey on Thanksgiving.<br /><br />This film shows the danger of making a film while smoking too much dope.  Naturally, I'm teasing a bit.  But holy cow; if you're going to make a film, is it really a smart idea to nearly require your audience to have a degree in psychology to just get through it?<br /><br />I loved the way this film started, and I loved the cinematography.  The film seems to start out with the basic theme:  &#34;You cannot control your destiny.&#34;  And that would be naturally a tautology, as &#34;destiny&#34; will be the things that will happen to you out of your control.  But then the film took an odd darker turn.<br /><br />I've read quite a bit from Freud, and I've read quite a bit about true-crime as well, particularly serial killers and their motivations.  And from what I remember -- do not shoot the messenger, as I do not necessarily hold these same opinions myself -- Freud believed that young boys became homosexuals when they became too attached to their mothers.  That perspective became quite politically incorrect, and the perspective has changed over the years.<br /><br />Supposedly now, it is believed that boys who don't spend enough time with their fathers -- and then become attached to their mothers -- later on learn to dislike their mothers as a nasty side effect.  Because of this, those boys become misogynistic, and take out their frustrations on other females later in life.  These types of males tend to become serial killers.  Once again, do not shoot the messenger.<br /><br />Why is this important to the film?  Well, there is a sequence that obviously borrowsfrom these ideas here.  One of the sons grows dark half way through, and he starts to commit some petty crimes and become &#34;mean&#34; at least.  And I thought that he might go darker than that.  While watching, I actually thought that the movie maybe should have been entitled, &#34;How Serial Killers are Born&#34; perhaps.<br /><br />This film felt like three films to me; I liked the beginning, the middle went dark, and then the ending seemed to go completely off the rails.  But did I like it?<br /><br />It depends upon what &#34;like&#34; means.  I think that, if you have an eon or so, this is worth a peek.  But you might just be scratching your head, just as I did while watching.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|First of all, I work in a call center and my job is to making all the network phone switching equipment can talk to it's component parts so I have a little experience with network stuff.  The Chromecast absolutely refused to connect to my home network.  The annoying thing about it is there is no way to manually do this stuff.  Either the software works, or it doesn't. If it doesn't, you can phone google support and they will tell you to get a chrome computer or an android phone or an apple device to connect.  (Since I was using various windows devices, they chose the other stuff.)  I borrowed my neighbor's ipad to try and set it up and it STILL wouldn't work.<br /><br />Am returning my Chromecast, not wasting anymore time trying to get a defective product to work.  Quite disappointed.
0156013924|5.0|Yo li este livro encuanto vivia en La Casa de Los Espiritos, en Manabi, Ecuador.  Neste tiempo, vivia sin electricidade, sin luz, sin internet.  Solamente tenia los sons de la natureza, una hammacka, e este livro.<br /><br />Esto es la cuenta de um viajador interplanateria que descende sobre la tierra e encontra um aviador que esta reparando um aeroplane en el desierto Sahara.<br /><br />La primera pregunta a sair de la boca del Principe es \\"desena me um cordero.\\"  De este introduction, vamos sobre una viage por varias planetas, discutindo as obras de varias personas, e luego retornamos a la tierra para caminhar un pouco por el desierto Sahara, donde se muerre el Principe.  Mas antes de morrer, el Principe deja con los leitores un sabido muy rico e saboroso e um sentido dificil a explicar, mas esse livro pode hace los seres humanos chorrar.<br /><br />Que maravilhosa es la vida!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This is truly one of the most addictive  books I've read in years. Maybe it's the political state this country's currently experiencing or maybe it's my age, but th is book strikes a chord. Suzanne Collins has a gift for revealing human nature and all of its flaws and triumphs, but most of all she reveals human strength in the face of adversity. A fantastic read!
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|Great app it is very useful and easy to access photos and videos. I just it all the time to get great quality pictures. It's all easy to share them.
B009LOJK1Q|5.0|Loved it, what a lovely continuation and conclusion to the Shining.<br />I could not put this down until I was done !
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Great sequel to The Shining! Loved it!! Stephen King did a great job - great story, interesting explanation to The Shining. A&#34;must read.
B008JFUS28|5.0|I finally got to see this movie tonight and I LOVED it! I am a huge, huge, fan of Loki, and as far as he is concerned, Loki definitely throws fans and audiences for a loop a few times throughout the movie, and gets plenty of screen time (in the post-production phase, the production team actually decided to film extra scenes featuring Loki since he has such a huge fanbase).<br /><br />Even if you're not a Loki fan, there is definitely plenty to enjoy about this movie. The balance between drama and comedy is a precarious one, but is balanced very well here, especially in the climactic scenes. There were definitely MANY hilarious moments in the movie, most of them hinging on brilliant snark and one-liners., another one featuring a very memorable cameo. The movie does get very emotional at some moments, so be sure to have tissues with you. There are two plot points in particular that the trailers for this movie did not include at all--people familiar with the Thor 2 trailers will find that this completely alters their assumptions of what the movie is about.<br /><br />DO watch this movie! You may cry, you will definitely laugh a lot, and you will most probably be hanging on the edge of your seat for a good portion of it! It's two hours very well spent.

B00AGOGOLE|5.0|This is a really good camera. But there is one flaw about it. Sometime it would say &quot;camera has stopped&quot; and I don't know how to fix it
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The media player was recommended by a representative of Netflix when I called them about replacing the xbox I was using to stream Netflix to my tv.  It was priced competitively, was as described and arrived quickly. Apart from having to purchase a pad-device to use as a remote the chromecast is a much more cost effective way to stream.  I have had no problems and am very happy with the purchase.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|As all the other reviews have already stated, this is a book to be cherished. I've read it twice and the movie is due in my city next week. Don't miss either.
B00338QENI|4.0|I had never heard of this before. We read it in book club and had a fairly interesting conversation....raises a lot of ethical questions which could also pertain to today!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is one of the best kindle games ever I can't put it down. Thiz is a game I will be playing for hours on end!!!!!<br />Buy this app or you will regret it forever.
B0044RUSZM|5.0|As a consultant I travel in and out of clients' offices each day.  When I know I'll be there all day, I bring this with to keep my posture good as I rarely know where I'll end up working from (office, conference room, cafeteria table).  Wherever I sit, I can easily pull this out of my bag, along with a travel mouse and keyboard, and be comfortable working for hours.<br /><br />Simple 3-piece design puts your laptop at the right height to keep your head looking forward, not tilted down all day.  Very happy.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|It sucks that u have to wait when u run out of lives . I don't want to have to buy more lives . To me that is not a free game . I like my other match games more .
B008M721MS|2.0|When I had first gotten this app, it would work fine. I was able to video chat, call and message perfectly. Now, I can barely send a message. I would write one, click send and it would say &quot;pending&quot; in the corner. My message wouldn't be sent. This app lags A LOT, and sometimes won't even let me sign in! From time to time some of my contacts won't show up. If I am doing something wrong, I have absolutely no idea what it is. Now I have to use my laptop on Skype instead of the easiest way. I am very disappointed and I should hope an update will fix these problems.
B00FN811SY|5.0|The format is intuitive. The new translation is easier to grasp. Having access to other translations in the same program is VERY handy to shed more light on a particular passage.
B00FLNRN06|1.0|There was not much to like.  Weak plot, stupid jokes, lots of f-bombs, and a giant testicle.  Meh.  When they turned out to love each other in the end, I had no idea why.
B00GH4RKYM|3.0|Some of the content was really excellent.  The battle scenes, however, are over done and it pushed Superman into a simple action hero without depth and personality.  This has been the 'battle' over the years...and I would say this movie allows simple action win.  Sorry to say.  I was going to buy for my collection but after the closing say 20 minutes or so...I really am not that interested in seeing it again.
1594204217|5.0|Fascinating history of the evolution of man based on the simple act of cooking.  A very good follow-up to Pollan's earlier books on the subject.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally on Amazon.  Cancel your appointments and clear your calendar.  Do not play if you have an addictive personality or are obsessive compulsive.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Entertaining fun for the children . Helps keep kids busy while I do my shopping and allows me to focus without worries.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|One of Disney's best movies I think. The story is good, the acting is good, and the cgi special effects are superb.
1455525839|5.0|Pendergast is the most interesting character that has ever graced the pages of any novel.  From the beginning(Relic), I was hooked.  Preston and Child have created an albino FBI agent with a photograhic memory who is the second &#34;man in black&#34; (you all know Johnny Cash) to capture the worlds' attention.  Pendergast is a loyal friend, an enemy to be reckoned with, and a brother not to be trifled with.  I believed him to be cold and unfeeling but White Fire showed me a side of Pendergast I thought was lacking.  Thank you Preston and Child for showing us that Pendergast is a man with genuine feelings.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I absolutely love candy crush, great concept. however, I reached level 37 and it will not let you continue playing unless you pay, have facebook friends, or complete three insanely hard quests. The developers just want money.
B000JMKTLO|3.0|Like the main character, the book was a little unstable.  Each person was crazier than the next. I wanted to feel their pain, but mostly couldn't believe they lived in our world. But I finished the book, which is a good thing.
B00ECR7KX2|5.0|Witty, charming and well-acted.  This is a great film.  Love the black and white, love the cast and the modern setting. While I love Nathan Fillion, he is not the star of this movie and doesn't come into the story until it's pretty far along.  So if you are a fan of his you may be a little disappointed. That being said, he does give a great performance as Dogberry.  This is a film I will definitely watch again.
B00FEMJF6O|1.0|Said I would get 100 or 120? Free Amazon coins if I downloaded. Never came. Just got a so so game much like a bunch of other games. Makes you wait while characters are doing things....can't even play in mean time unless you spend coins ( called crowns). Only good part is I didn't waste money on this rip off.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|One of the best movies I've seen in a while with many twists and dramatic effects.  Very unexpected plot and ending.
B004TUDMD4|5.0|definitely one of his best story telling albums......from the great myth maker of our time ..thanks Lou.....you are missed....your work will live on...peace
B007BVOEPI|4.0|Excellent dramatic plot with many references to the supernatural and witchcraft that peoples of the pre- and early middle ages would have believed in.  Graphic violence and explicit, depicted sex and nudity is excessive, but, probably true to the times and upper echelons of the societies.  In most cases the scenery is beautiful and the snow scenes will make you shiver with the actors when done out of doors.  Obviously not for children and the conservative faint of heart.
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|Works perfect and see near GB speeds.  Have quite a few all work without any problems at all.  Have not run into issues with not pulling IP Addresses like some other USB/Thunderbolt Ethernet connectors.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a very addicting game that keeps you coming back for more.  I do recommend this game lots of fun.
1455525839|5.0|I pre-ordered this book written by my favorite authors,months ago, and just received it . Today is Sunday, it is rainy and cold outside, and I am propped up in bed, my little fireplace is roaring, I am cozy, and  half way through this latest Agent Pendergast thriller. They are so well written, and such a good read. If you have never read the series start at the beginning- or if you want to start at one of the earliest, and in my mind the best of them all, read &#34;Cabinet Of Curiousities&#34; . It will give you a great introduction to Agent Pendergast, and make you a lifetime devotee.
B00FVVR2ZO|4.0|this is a good game. it can get very addictive and expensive.  the energy does not last long enough for your money.
B00FSBW2L6|5.0|Christoph Fischer<br />The Black Eagle Inn<br />The Three Nations Trilogy #3<br /><br />Before reading this trilogy, I had never put much thought into reading historical fiction but I can honestly say that since coming across this author I wouldn’t think twice about it now.  I have loved reading all three books, all for completely different reasons, and there’s no way I could choose a favourite in the trilogy.  This book went further than just covering the war era, as it carried on and showed how people were continually affected after 1945.  The author has a way of writing that completely draws you in, and the characters become real as the story unfolds.  Despite the heavy nature of the storyline, the book is easy to read and flows so smoothly that I soon found myself turning page after page.  I would highly recommend this trilogy.<br /><br />I was gifted an e-copy from the author in exchange for an honest review.
1587143879|4.0|This will help me recertify my Cisco CCNA, well written and easy to read. Also some great exam questions and labs.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Awesome reading. George R R Martin draws you right in .  I did not want to read these books. I viewed the last two shows from the last season and had no desire to read the books. My son, an avid reader as well, convinced me to start them. Long story short when I accidentally left book 3 behind while traveling, I has to log on and buy the set. I had to know what was happening . . .
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|As always, Gladwell's books are insightful and thought provoking, and DAVID & GOLIATH is especially so. Such a compelling read I found that I was finished with book in a flash.<br /><br />Michael D McCarty
B00B6QXN56|5.0|I never even heard of Joe Bonamassa until last year. A friend led me to Joe's music and I have not turned away....Not once have I heard a song of his played on the radio...What a shame! I guess it is all up to us that have discovered this genius to spread the word.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|It's not that I love to watch zombies' heads getting bashed in! Really. While being drawn into a world where a zombie apocalypse has happened, I'm most fascinated by the moral dilemmas that the remaining humans must face. Why is it that when human civilization is on the line, some humans still resort to controlling each other through violence rather than working with each other? What I really want to know is The Governor's history. What makes him tick?
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Spoiler - Loved the first two books but I've got an addition for the mentoring classes I do occasionally. In addition to not killing off the dog, I've now added...don't kill off the heroine!<br /><br />I also didn't like the two POV's. I understand why it was necessary...there's have been no book after Tris died, but I'd submit if you're going to do something like that you need to start it in the first book so people are used to it. It was also very difficult to distinguish Tris' from Tobias' POV. They sounded exactly alike and I found myself skimming a lot of Tobias' POV because his personality changed in this book to pretty whiny.<br /><br />All in all I have no idea how they're going to get people to a movie where they know the main character is going to die...unless there's another book and this was all just a dream or one of those simulations and they've figured out how to make it work on Divergents and they don't know they're in it.<br /><br />I'd think about another book Veronica...to get you out of this hot mess.
B007R11DKQ|4.0|This is the second time that I have seen this movie and I still think it is good. Anyone can win
B004V2S4SS|5.0|Medium was the greatest show.  The family dynamic, especially that of Allison and Joe as a married couple, was pretty dang great.  The seventh and final Season of Medium is a must-have for true fans.
B005N09L5C|3.0|It reminds me of where we are heading today with all the government controls. We are loosing our freedoms daily.
B003CNQPNS|5.0|i chose this rating cause i have always liked the tv show and when i found it on amazon i was so happy that i could have it to watch again.
B002MG2ATY|5.0|Oliver Stone at the top of his game. Thoroughly engrossing as well as grossly fictionalized. 53 pieces of evidence against Oswald are conveniently ignored in favor of spooky suspense.
B0084LQHN6|4.0|Azaelia Banks as an artist has a bit of that 'up and comer, i should have been recognized years ago&#34; attitude....it reflects in her music.  if she was a little less 'trying so hard' and a little more confident in her music I think she'd be better served.
1781163243|5.0|It is a nice book I guess. It has a lot of stuff in here. I personally didn't read it, but I know it has some nice illustrations and story stuff. My bro told me it was a nice book for the price, so I am giving it 5/5 because that's what my bro gives it. I recommend it.
B00BRUYQFC|4.0|Not his best album, but still goo Timberlake.<br /><br />As I understand it, he has made this album because he's contractually obligated to make it....but he's likely more worried about his other ventures (movies, producing, etc.).<br /><br />Still good though, just not his best.
B00005214X|5.0|When the Beatles broke up, George Harrison had a stockpile of unproduced material that couldn't find its way onto Beatles albums. He, with the help of an all-star cast including his good friend Eric Clapton, exploded with this large piece of work.
0316017922|5.0|quick and easy read - this will motivate you be be an 'outlier'.<br /><br />My biggest takeaway from this book is the 10,000 idea.  There are no shortcuts for just putting in the time and effort....if you want to be great (truly great), then you should take the time to read this and set your path to greatness!
B004KBSQBA|4.0|Enjoyable listening. Bought after watching a PBS doc on the making of Graceland. Quite different from his previous works. Enjoy!

B00FEJIVRQ|4.0|good movie still not the best of the franchise. More of a Tony stark movie than a iron man movie but hes a great character regardless. The final action scene was great
B00EBFRU76|5.0|this is a christmas gift for my husband. He lovedthe movie and loves to read. I do not know if it is a hit or not, but i definately hope it is

B004GJVI5C|5.0|i love this movie, its one of my favorites. be cool to see a sequel to what happens after everything was all said and done.
B00EVW04PE|2.0|It's not even close to realistic and politically motivated.  If you are a conservative, you will not like this movie.  Lines are given throughout the movie that are just unreal.  Waste of money.
B004N6369Y|5.0|Hotel Vendome:  Excellent family-friendly story!  I truly enjoyed  the total plot of family life and growing up in this atmosphere..I have all of Danielle Steel' s  older books.  Have loved reading for years and will continue to do so.  Thanks for the opportunity of reading books on my Kindle Fire!
B00G9U7NEQ|5.0|Cute and clean. This is a nice one for the family.  The college scene was not overplayed to the extent it could have been.  All around decent movie.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|it is hard and easy at the same time and fun to play and it is rilly my top game
193700788X|5.0|Love the Sookie Stackhouse books! A friend had been after me for a couple of years to read them. When I started I could not stop! Dead Ever After is as good as any of the series.  Charlaine Harris say it ain't so! The Sookie series is finished, oh no!
B0079R8KXG|5.0|Fits perfect and holds kindle at correct angle for reading without having to support with hands.  Perfect match for the kindle and also for myself.

B001UV4XIS|5.0|This was very inexpensive! I finally have the last piece to my HP movie collection :) There aren't that many additional/behind the scenes things but I wasn't looking for that anyways.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Very interesting book. Like it because it keeps you in suspense. I like this<br />author a lot. Kind of book that you want to know the ending.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I like this because it's fun It's hard for me to like a game so it's great I can't stop playing it

B00FQPHOPI|5.0|Excellent movie. Loved the bonus features because showed the thoughts of the creators and behind the scenes with Henry. However, I was expecting delete scenes or an uncut non theatrical version, but I did not get that in this stream online version, not sure if there is any. Still would buy it again, it is nice to have great movie right here in my laptop.
B00AEFY3MC|5.0|One of my favorite movies.  Funny, clever, great acting.  Love the cast!  I love star trek, but you don't have to love star trek to love this movie.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This is really fun and addicting. The graphic are good. It makes you feel like your in another place and time.
B002ZG97LK|1.0|I was surprised at my disappointment.  I didn't care for some of the changes from the original movie. However, I loved the original Footloose with Kevin Bacon.
B005HEPOKU|5.0|An excellent addition to the first season. As always, some of the episodes have a better story than others.If you enjoy The Next Generation, this season is worth watching.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|I grew up reading Marvel comics in the 70s, and I love this movie. I've watched it 3 or 4 times. The characters are witty, the dialog is fast-paced.  With this many stars, it's tough to give them all enough screen time but the directorial style of flipping from the viewpoint of one major character to another is brilliant. You get to see the same scene from multiple viewpoints, and it really is gripping.<br /><br />Yeah, there is some suspension of disbelief, and it's never clear whether the bad guys are robots or organic or some mixture of the two, but who cares. It's a visual feast.<br /><br />For me, the high point was... wait, first some back story. Whenever I watch movies with my kids, I am always &#34;getting&#34; some inside joke that they have no frame of reference for, and I have to explain to them, &#34;see, when I was a kid, there was this TV show, and there was some character who always said...&#34;. Recently I bought a Looney Tunes collection for them to watch, and among the collection are a lot of road runner cartoons. And when Tony Stark says, &#34;What Loki's got is an Acme Dynamite Kit, and it's going to blow up in his face&#34;, my kids were all, &#34;Dad! We got that reference!&#34; Which I find especially ironic because in this very same movie, there's a reference to the flying monkeys in the Wizard of Oz, and Cap America gets very excited and says, &#34;I got that! I understand that reference!&#34;.  Life imitates art. You gotta love it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was waiting for the day candy crush made it to my kindle, I appreciated the opprotunity to add this to my kindle fire
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This series is amazing. It has it all! The interaction of the characters, upstairs and downstairs, is perfect. Can't wait for the next season.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This series is my favorite series of all time. I'm rereading them right now, and they are just as exciting as the first time I read them.
B0067RQYNW|4.0|Have not used it much but it certainly appears to do what it is intended to do. I was able to review at home something I had saved to the cloud at work.
B00BL5YQKS|5.0|I really miss dramas that had this type of thought into it.  You just have to love the Anti-Hero type aspect of this story which is something that current series lack.
B001XV3LSS|4.0|For people who dont believe this story makes the point that we all believe in some things and why not accept others, really enjoyed it
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Game works great. Like it better than FB version. I have had no problems using it.<br /> I am becoming addicted to it.
B0093Q8W0C|4.0|Havent seen it in many many years, Alfred Hitchkock has a style of his own and I thought this was a good refreshing memory of an old classic.
B00942G4UA|5.0|The information is very precise and easy to understand.  The topic should be of interest to everyone concern about the food industry and how it operates.  Candid shots enabled the viewer to see the true setting and concerns.  Many opportunities were listed to get involved with the political implications discussed in this film.
B00BAXFAOW|4.0|Ugh! I loved this book. It kept me thinking. But the ending was abrupt, came out of nowhere, and did not make any sense. It seemed unfinished and out of place with the book. It left me feeling confused and wondering if I had in fact understood the message at all.
B00004WNZ3|5.0|The product is simply amazing. 180g double vinyl with separated covers (with lyrics) is great. Sound quality is immaculate. Excellent purchase!
B0000047CW|5.0|This disc is for a gift.  I still have the original record in mono.  It must be nice in stereo.  This is a fine session.  Soothing and at times ebullient.  Grab it at a good price.  Thanks Amazon.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|I never watched the series and read and heard so much about it. My room mate and i are addicted. We have watched 1, 2, 3 and are halfway thru season 4. Loved all. Amazon was so easy to use.
B00FKAA3MA|1.0|Hateful and trash. Homophobic and disrespect. Money made off disrespect and hate. NO TALENT  Don't waste your time or money on trash
B007J4T2G8|2.0|The content is there, but I honestly could only get through half of the book because I got bored due to it's &#34;juvenile fan-fiction style of writing.&#34;
B0040HO01Y|5.0|This is an excellent series. The quality of the production is superb and the storylines are touching. After a few episodes, I found myself getting to know the many interesting characters of both Lark Rise and Candleford.
B00DYOOGYK|4.0|The story line is excellent and the sandbox open word game play is divine.<br /> Although this game has few flaws, it is still an excellent game on the kindle fire.
B000M341QE|2.0|Before everybody around here condems this review, please note that I consider Martin Scorsese to be high up in the pantheon of great filmmakers. At least under three instances do I believe that he deserved to win not just for Best Picture and Director, but win big all around: Goodfellas, Raging Bull, and Hugo. And in several other instances, such as Mean Streets, King of Comedy, and After Hours. After years of being favored over by lesser calibur films like Dances with Wolves and Million Dollar Baby as well as outmatched by decent rivals like Ordinary People, Rocky, The Sting, and Out of Africa, he finally won one...and needless to say, the film isn't all that's cracked up to be.<br /><br />I do believe one may need to cover the acting first and foremost here because everybody does a wonderful job with the roles they were given--which is surprising given that Anthony Anderson (the guy from Kangaroo Jack) is in this film as well--but not as surprising given that great amounts of talent behind this film: The three leads are Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, and Jack Nicholsen, with Mark Whalberg (in an oscar nominated turn), Martin Sheen, Ray Winston, and Alec Baldwin helping to round up the star-studded cast. With a film directed by the great Martin Scorsese and starring such a powerhouse cast across the board, it pretty much goes without saying that the acting would be first rate....<br /><br />....But there is one small problem, and I'd be more than incline to blame the directing here than the acting for this, but both sides are to blame here: There is a crap ton of profanity and F-bombs in this film. And by that, I mean everybody pretty much curses their brains out save for Alec Baldwin, and every time I hear the F-word uttered on screen, it doesn't sound natural; it comes off more like the actors and director were trying so hard to secure the R-rating that they had all but forgotten that all it takes is four or more uses of the F-word, or just one use as a sexual euphenism to guarantee it (and even then, the amounts of blood and gore in this film, while not as abundant as a Tarantino film, is still enough to all but guaratee the rating on its own).<br /><br />And of course, one mustn't cover the writing without first covering the source in which the film was based on first. The Departed is a remake of a Hong Kong thriller called Infernal Affairs (which has an entire film trilogy of its own to back it up). Infernal Affairs is a surprisingly effective and believable crime thriller (I can definitely see their police force going to such great lengths in inserting a mole in a crime boss's organization just to bring them down). I cannot, under any circumstances (even knowing full well that Frank Costello planted a rat in the police force) see Martin Sheen and Mark Whalberg taking DiCaprio's character off the record and locking away his identity just to efficiently plant a mole in Costello's organization. And the ending is just plain weird; everybody just seems to kill each other in that film, leaving us only the girl, Whalberg, and Baldwin left alive by film's end.<br /><br />The main problem is that, in translating a Hong Kong crime thriller to an American setting and cast, the film loses credibility. It's comes across as way too farfetched and needlessly vulgar, and the end result just doesn't gel. Of the Best Picture nominees from 2006, three are better: The Queen should have easily won in that group, with Little Miss Sunshine and Letters from Iwo Jima as superior alternate nominees. It is also, in essence, the worst of Scorsese's major films, behind only Gangs of New York for worst film he ever directed. Even his lesser films generally have more mirth and merit than The Departed.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|This was a very disappointing conclusion to a trilogy I had really enjoyed.  I think the overall feeling the reader is left with is sadness and hopelessness.  I have listened to the author's interviews about her choices for the ending of this story, but I think she really missed the mark.  I think she wants the book to speak to the reader about self-sacrifice and maturity, but instead has crafted a story that represents futility.  If a character as brave and resourceful as Tris can't make it through all life throws at her, what hope is there for the ordinary person?  I also found the recurrent theme of suicide somewhat concerning for a young adult book.  Don't buy this book if you or the  person it is intended for suffers from depression.
B00DBO1YMK|5.0|Let me start by saying I'm buying copies of this CD to include with every family member's Christmas gift this year.  It's that good.<br /><br />I don't really listen to this kind of music anymore, but I purchased this album to give to a family member for her birthday and CANNOT BELIEVE HOW GOOD IT IS.  I used to listen to Jon Schmidt back in the day (we're talking 90s here) when I was a teenager and he was just starting out.  I purchased his very first album when it was newly released and used to go to his concerts when they were held in little tiny venues.  &#34;All of Me&#34; was my favorite song, and I spent hours at the piano perfecting it.<br /><br />Fast forward almost two decades. I hadn't listened to Jon's music in years, and I was blown away by how good this album is.  Just...WOW.  I've been listening to it nonstop all afternoon as I've been designing my Christmas cards, and it's truly inspiring.  I could listen to &#34;Where Are You Christmas?&#34; on repeat all day.  I am duly impressed.  Count me as a re-converted fan!<br /><br />P.S. As I went to purchase tickets to the Piano Guys Christmas concert to give to my parents (and saw the prices) my husband and I had a little chuckle as we remembered attending one of Jon's concerts back in the day at our university.  I think the tickets were $5 and the room where it was held (not even a theater) wasn't even full.  Jon, you've come a long way and deserve every bit of success!  I love seeing someone make it big doing what they love, and Jon's passion for music rings in every note.  Bravo!
B002HJ9PTO|3.0|The audio level for these is just *barely* enough. If this is all your budget allows, they're useable if you're willing to work on bumping the audio in post. But otherwise you're probably better off going another step up if you can.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|Let me start by saying I'm buying copies of this CD to include with every family member's Christmas gift this year.  It's that good.<br /><br />I don't really listen to this kind of music anymore, but I purchased this album to give to a family member for her birthday and CANNOT BELIEVE HOW GOOD IT IS.  I used to listen to Jon Schmidt back in the day (we're talking 90s here) when I was a teenager and he was just starting out.  I purchased his very first album when it was newly released and used to go to his concerts when they were held in little tiny venues.  &#34;All of Me&#34; was my favorite song, and I spent hours at the piano perfecting it.<br /><br />Fast forward almost two decades. I hadn't listened to Jon's music in years, and I was blown away by how good this album is.  Just...WOW.  I've been listening to it nonstop all afternoon as I've been designing my Christmas cards, and it's truly inspiring.  I could listen to &#34;Where Are You Christmas?&#34; on repeat all day.  I am duly impressed.  Count me as a re-converted fan!<br /><br />P.S.

B002VRZEYM|5.0|This is a great documentary. I loved it. It is not just for vegans and does not try to turn you into one. Just information on what is going on with out food.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Fun to play.  Kind of game where you can set several task, leave for awhile and come check on them later.

B009XIXVU6|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read.  Our book club chose it and it was a unanimous favorite!  As good as The Kiterunner which i also one of my top five books.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|When my sister bought the app I said what the Hedy and tried it out. I love that app so much. I even got the November topaz dragon and limited time dark rift dragon in the month ive had it so far.
B0071BY2OG|5.0|A must see for any motogp fan. It's great to see stoner talk garbage about rossi, lorenzo says rossi is not god and he loves to beat him, and simoncellli literally calls everyone a baby cus he races hard and they cry afterwards, good DVD extras as well
B00B5HQL50|5.0|Best Bond Ever, Film a bit dark but excellent as always.  Javier Bardem as the creepy villain was a fantastic choice.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I LOVE this game. It is so addictive. I also play on facebook. Best to play thus game while the Kindle is plugged in
B00EGMQIJ0|5.0|At times inspiring and at times concerning; wonderful. &#34;Privacy is an antiquated idea.&#34; - Randy Zuckerberg<br /><br />In themes and style true to Egger's, another wonderful and thought provoking story is shared.
B00GH4RKYM|3.0|The movie was entertaining, but it was nothing more than dialogue written around special effects.  I got tired of seeing the guy smash into concrete!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was so happy to see this available on my kindle. I immediatly downloaded it. Now I can play everywhere. Thank you. I have not had any problems with this app at all.
B00CTGVKGQ|4.0|I bought this by mistake, but I do enjoy it. I meant to buy her album Pure Heroine but I got this. It's a great compilation of music however only five tracks, as it is only an EP, goes by very quick. Good artist and I can't wait to hear more from her.
B00EVW04PE|1.0|Horrible acting. I could overlook that if the action was great...it wasn't. Jamie Foxx is a joke and that is a major statement considering Channing Tatum is usually the worst of a movie. Don't waste money on this movie. Wait until it's free and you're bored.
B00A50PDDY|4.0|Great band, love the disc, my only problem, as with most compact discs, is the overall length of the songs. I feel like it's too short. the combination of rock, rap and a dash of reggae works really well for this artist.
B00F91SCXC|4.0|Interesting movie that was fun to watch. Brad Pitt is very good in this movie. The images of the zombies are great, especially when they climb onto each other to get over a wall.
B00B0LPWU6|3.0|Didn't like the foul language.  Movie was good and exciting in parts.  Would recomend it if the language was better.
1939416205|5.0|I read all 9 in a few days and am looking forward to december when book 10 comes out. I disagree w the persons giving the books a bad review for grammar or incomplete story lines. I take each read at face value for what the author has to offer. Even a person like me who considers Robert Jordan a God among men and the WoT series the epitome of the genre thus far has a true fan in Morgan Rice. I am in my 30's and I appreciate the story and characters for what they are. As a beginner in the world of fantasy or a conniseur, truly these books have what you are looking for and have great potential to spark the minds and imaginations of the young and old alike. Definitely worth your time and money from my perspective. Enjoy!
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Very good movie, watched it a few times, I liked it so much had to buy it. will tell all my friends to do the same
B004SMD4H2|5.0|We are addicted to Haven and being able to see these over again helps to tie the entire series together.
B00C1BV9Z6|5.0|The viewing we got with this HD video rental was excellent, very clear & bright.  Of course Jurassic Park is one of our all-time favorites.
B00EGMQIJ0|5.0|This is an amazing view of what the future could be...if we aren't careful.  Great read. I love the development of the characters as well as the story.
0425263908|5.0|I think Sylvia Day is now my favorite author. I read all of her crossfire books while i was out of work sick and I loved them all. I cant wait for the 4th and 5th books to come out.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This app is GREAT!!! I played it before on my mom's phone but on kindle AMAZING!! I love this app and I think you should should rate it 5 stars!!!!
1451629192|5.0|This book was really good. I cried reading a lot of it knowing what he did to her and what he made her go through was heart breaking but knowing she had the strength to keep going was very inspirational.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I've recently become very skeptical of NY Times best sellers but this book was an amazing read. I've read plenty of books and thought I can predict this book but it turned out to be different then what I thought. I recommend this book to anyone who wants something different and mix up their current reading regime. Also, the audiobook was very good, for those who don't always have the time read.
B000KJT8IG|1.0|Ever since it came out in  the late-1980's, \\"Christmas Vacation\\" has been an annual viewing tradition for millions of people. The movie is up there with \\"Miracle On 34th Street\\", \\"It's A Wonderful Life\\", the Santa Clause Trilogy and \\"I'll Be Home For Christmas\\" (although on the language front, Vacation is nowhere as clean as those other classics).<br /><br />Unfortunately, Warner's has not done a good job with the Blu-Ray.  I also own the film on DVD, so I'm able to compare the two, and I would have to say that the DVD provides your best bang for your buck.  On my 40\\" 1080p TV the upressed DVD looks equal to the Blu-Ray (the Blu-Ray has a bit that, for the most part, is right around the 10.0 to 15.0Mbps, with the occasional section between 20.0 and 25.0Mbps).  Warner's did not put any effort into this Blu-Ray.  I've never seen this movie on VHS, but others have told me that when they compared the VHS and DVD versions, they didn't find any real difference in terms of the master used.  So it could be possible that this is a transfer that was made in the 1980's and was intended for airing on the old analog MUSE HDTV system that was in use in some parts of the world in the  1980's and 1990's.<br /><br />Audio wise, again the Blu-Ray features the DVD's same Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround track at a whopping 192kbps.  The special features are also the same: theatrical trailer and cast audio commentary.<br /><br />If you are looking for a copy of this video, just get the Standard Definition DVD version and just allow your DVD/Blu-Ray player to upconvert the video to High Definition.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|altho the earlier seasons were far better, i am still a fan.  My whole family can't wait to watch every week
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Addictive fun!  Love the different levels but not the ones with bombs.  Good combo of luck and strategy and fast paced play.
0894803123|5.0|Lots of easy neat recipes that will work perfectly in our new kitchen aid ice cream maker. Simple wholesome ingredients.
B00CH3DBNQ|4.0|Looking forward to more from this remarkable young woman.  Some parts read like a newspaper but many required reflection and highlighting :)
B00AF82WTO|4.0|The best thing about this version is Rupert Penry-Jones as Captain Wentworth. While a tad too good looking and smooth faced for a naval captain that fought in a ruthless war, for the most part he does a credible job of portraying Wentworth.<br /><br />The worst thing about this movie is that either the screenwriter or the director have taken undue liberties with the plot. I found RPJ and SH's acting to be good, but unfortunately they had the deck stacked against them by the terrible script and/or the terrible directing.<br /><br />The most egregious offense as far as I'm concerned is changing Anne from dignified, resigned and intelligent to mousy, inarticulate and ever-weeping. This new version of the heroine really makes you wonder why Captain Wentworth was ever interested in her and how can he continue to be so? All the intelligent conversations that Anne holds with Benwick and other characters in the book (and the 1995 adaptation) are cut out, giving the viewer absolutely no clue as to her personality and charms. Benwick, which is a fairly important character in the book, is given a grand total of 3 minutes screen time.<br /><br />Anne's expected bloom in the second half of the movie is simply never seen. She continues on mousy and washed out, with her mouth perpetually agape and trembling, weeping from beginning to end. I have to blame this one on the director. It is not bad acting but it is not in keeping with the Anne Elliot conceived by Austen. Meanwhile, even changing her hairstyle or giving her slighly prettier outfits would have helped create the impression that her reacquaintance with Wentworth is filling her with renewed hope and optimism, and that she is transformed by her love for him.<br /><br />The ending reeks of Harlequin, not only due to Anne's utterly inappropriate rendition of \\"Run Lola, Run\\" in 19th century Bath, but also because key parts of the plot have disappeared. When does Wentworth find the time to write her that letter since she chasesafter him right after elucidating the question of Mr. Elliot? When did he even have time to go back to Harville's and drop it off? And why didn't he just give it to her himself, since thay had just chatted?<br /><br />And the constancy conversation, the one that prompts his declaration....it was butchered. Cut down to a couple of sentences between Benwick (during the only scene he is even seen) and Anne, as opposed to Harville and Anne, and completely outside of Wentworth's earshot.<br /><br />Other oddities: Mrs. Croft and Elizabeth look way older than 38 and 29 respectively, Mary seems borderline manic, Charles Musgrove sounds foolish, Mrs. Smith is not disabled, Henrietta is barely shown and Captain Wentworth is surprised to realize he was courting Louisa. I have to dwell on this for a moment because, my reading of the book indicates that to a certain degree he did it to get back at Anne for her rejection, hence the \\"unjust I may have been, weak and resentful I have been, but never inconstant\\" part of his letter.<br /><br />If you can forget about the novel, you can classify it as a well acted romantic costume drama with great visuals and a somewhat wimpy heroine. But it is not Jane Austen's Persuasion. Not by a long shot.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|This is my 7th grade daughter's review of the book: It was kind of disappointing... Not only did the author kill off my favorite character, but she also killed some of the good qualities in some of the characters. She made Tris a bit too grown-up for me, of course she had to be, and Tori was killed way too abruptly. Tobias also became weak, of course, again, he had to become a little soft, but... I just can't describe. I was heart-broken at the end of the book. I kept thinking about what could've happened and how fast everything went. It was all just abrupt. While I see that Tris and Tobias have some of the same ways of thinking, it shouldn't be to the point where I can't tell the difference. I loved the series, I loved it all, it's just very disappointing.
B00364K6YW|3.0|There are some things I enjoyed about this version but there are others that I found to be unfortunate. Colin Firth makes a believable Mr. Darcy, perhaps a bit more emotional than Austen's character but still endearing. Jennifer Ehle as Lizzie has the playfulness described by the author but she constantly appears to be more mature than her supposed age with a perpetual knowing look that doesn't necessarily jive with her description.<br /><br />I absolutely hated Mrs. Bennett's portrayal in this version....she just screeches through the entire series. Lydia appears to be mentally impaired half the time and Mr. Collins and Lady Catherine are shown as caricatures. The Bingley sisters appear overly stuffy  without the subtle conniving needling they employ in the book.<br /><br />All in all not a bad adaptation but not a great one either.
B004UJTG6Q|3.0|I read this as a child and loved it. But the e virsion has ton's of misspelled words and errors in it making it impossible to understand. I had my nephew read it and was like thats not the right word but sure enough its was is printed needs some spell check and grammer check used on it.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|The app does all it says it will do, and has been bulletproof so far. It does tend to use battery time, but not enough to give me an issue with it unlike some other apps.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I'm a fan of John Grisham. This book seemed to be longer but was so enticing that I couldn't seem to put it down.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|It was a good book all together, most people know that, its a pretty popular book. But it isn't one of my favorites and I don't think I will be finishing the series.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love being able to gather things (recipes, how-to's, etc) in one place to try when I have time available.
