031606792X|5.0|After reading the first three books in a week, I was a bit skeptical to begin the fourth book after reading some of these one star reviews.  Now, that I've read the fourth book, I just have to laugh and shake my head at most of those one star reviews.    The writing style was similar to the first three and the story turned out just fine to me.    Those that have a problem with shape-shifters imprinting on a child - You've got to be kidding?  There is something wrong with that - but not the in-depth detail of how vampires attack and suck the life out of an animal.  Give me a break...    My only complaint of the whole series is there is too much \\"Edward breathed on me and I melted\\" kind of stuff.  But hey, I'm a guy! - and it was easy enough to skim those parts.    5 stars.
0930289234|4.0|If you are an avid comic reader I would suggest you don't read this review as it is not directed toward you (Even though I'm sure you all read this novel already)<br />\\"Watchmen\\" was not what I was expecting. It wasn't page after page of explosions, fights, scantily-clad women and big-muscled villains kidnapping the damsel-in-distress. Sure, there is some of that, but on the whole \\"Watchmen\\" by Alan Moore (illustrations by Dave Gibbons) is a smart, deceptive novel that is filled with unexpected plot-twists.<br />\\"Watchmen\\" brings us the story of masked adventurers in a world when vigilanteism is banned and Richard Nixon is still president set in year 1985. When one of these masked adventurers is killed in very suspicious circumstances it leads one of our heros to begin investigating into what he thinks is a \\"mask killer\\" trying to get these adventurers out of the way for something even bigger.<br />The illustrations in this novel are wonderfull. As a non-comic reader, I really don't care how good the illustrations are if the story can't hold up. But boy does it ever in this one. This is a story for any reader out there. Please enjoy.
B0000844M8|5.0|A friend of mine recommended me to watch this movie.  Wonderful!!!  I just love this movie.  It was very moving.  I highly recommend it.
0743496736|1.0|This was the first of Picoult's books that I have read and I am confident that it will be the last.   I am genuinely mystified by the popularity of her books. I would understand it if they were directed at teens but I am surprised that adults are captivated by her simplistic and repetitive style. Most of the characters are extremely poorly drawn and the \\"insights\\" offered seemed ill-informed, naive, banal or all three. The plot is unconvincing and the trademark twist would have been laughable had it not been so tedious. I read this book for a book club and therefore felt obliged to get to the end - as a consequence it is the worst book that I have ever read from cover to cover.
B001DDBCUU|2.0|For such a long film and such a long awaited one, it leaves so much room for improvement. One, it is very predictable, from the beginning to the eye-rolling end. It wants to be over the top, but it's missing the wonderful element that the show possessed. It has no heart. There is no passion, no romance and, surprisingly, no sex.     All the characters lead predictable boring lives. There are a few bumps, especially for Miranda, but even that plot has a predictable end. Charlotte is the perfect one, with the perfect life and perfect husband and child. Again, what happens to her in the film, everyone should have seen coming from a mile away.     Samantha is the same, spunky and over the top, but her storyline falls flat as well. Again, perhaps it is the lack of sex. Very dissapointing.    Carrie, my least favorite character in the show continues the tradition in the film to an annoying level. Honestly, I don't know how Big could ever have gotten with her. Speaking of Big; yes, predictable as well.    Like I said, it is a long movie, that really doesn't need to be. They need to cut out the boring fat and then it would have been quite decent. The sassy feel of the show is missing and no matter how many designer bags or shoes this movie flaunts, it doesn't make up for the fact that this film is not up to par with the series.
B000001FE0|5.0|The Gibb brothers were,  to many of us 60's folks, somewhat like the Moody Blues, early PFloyd and of course THE Fab Four. Odessa remains a milestone,  a true super achievement... among those recordings of that period.  Too bad ...the \\"disco\\" thing  strayed many musicians from their great writing and musicality,  including some R.Stone and S.Winwood  recordings. For us who never cared for any disco, we diehard BG fans appreciate their BG 1st, Horizontal, Idea,  and their \\"Sgt Pepper\\" or their peak of their career , the  legendary  ODESSA.  A real classic !!
B001EOQWEO|5.0|On the big screen, this looked fantastic. Pixar just gets better and better, their movies more enjoyable and truly innovative. They are pure geniuses. Wall-E is a very sweet and simple film. While both children and adults will enjoy it, there are certain elements that only older people will 'get'. It deals with something that could possibly be a reality here on Earth in the not so distant future. That said, the humans in this film are utterly hilarious and I can so picture the type of future that they live in. It's already starting to happen here, without a doubt. It really goes to show how laziness can affect someone. I really loved that aspect of this film.    Wall-E himself is just the cutest robot ever created. Again, alot of research obviously went into creating him and it shows. You can't help but fall in love with him. There is a scene towards the end that is heartbreaking and it still amazes me that you can get this emotional over something that is not flesh and blood.    The visuals are stunning. Probably the best ever for Pixar or anything not live action. The desolate earth landscape with the ever-present garbage and debris is almost hauntingly real looking.     That said, many people are calling this the greatest Pixar movie to date, but I disagree. The Incredibles by far surpasses this, storywise. It had more action and suspense and surprises. Wall-E is a far more simpler film, but still a fantastic one that deserves multiple viewings. Even if the plot is lacking somewhat, Wall-E himself sure isn't, and it's enough to watch it just to see him in action.
B001AIRUOU|4.0|I purchased this set not from amazon but from a local retailer and wanted to point out something is wrong with this version of the film. Biggest one I can tell so far is that in the first 5 minutes there are lyrics missing from the \\"This is Halloween\\" song. When Sally is combing her hair its supposed to say \\" I am the wind blowing through your hair, I am the Who when you call Who's there\\" in my set (this one) its missing. There are also some smaller things missing here and there, but I haven't had time to sit down and write a full compairison. That was the first thing I noticed. Anyone else notice things like this as well? Thats why 4 stars other than that great box, nice setup but same extras as before.
0792839749|5.0|This was my youngest son's favorite movie for the Thanksgiving holiday and he still loves it as an adult.  We all love Dick Van Dyke and he was superb in this one and especially when he and Sally Ann Howe do the puppet/doll song... It's wonderful and fun for any time you want to smile.
031606792X|3.0|I am a huge Twilight fan and, as with so many others, I could not wait for Breaking Dawn to sit on my nightstand.  I read the book as quickly as I did the others and I felt some of the same feelings as far as I couldn't put it down, etc., however, it wasn't my favorite of the series.    I won't rehash what everyone else has already said, so here are the points for me that made this book fail.    -->  I really missed Edward.  The Edward side was missing a LOT.    -->  So was the relationship between Bella and the Cullens.  The things that I loved so much about the Cullens were absent in this book.    -->  The name Renesmee (or however you spell it) was absolutely STOOPID!!!  As was the child.  Why wouldn't I love a child between Bella and Edward?  I really didn't like that I didn't like this kid.    -->  Why did Bella get EVERYTHING?  She got Edward. Jacob, a baby, immortality, a relationship STILL with her parents, the other werewolves or shifters, whatever, she got EVERYTHING.  She didn't sacrifice a thing!  And how come she still didn't have her fat baby weight when she turned into a vampire?      So those are my biggies.  It's kind of a shame because you recommend that everyone read the first three, but if you possibly can, stop there and don't read Breaking Dawn because it will spoil everything for you.
B0015FWRHS|5.0|I kept seeing the name Avishai Cohen around so I thought I'd listen. A new world opened for me. Then two days ago I saw him at the Blue Note NYC(which turned out to be not that expensive after all).  The difference between seeing him and hearing him is the difference between 6th heaven and 7th heaven. Not only has he begun to create a solid body of work but he is a consummate showman - he wins the audience over with his sincerity, modesty, and appreciation of his sidemen. His technique is awesome, the compositions (an amalgam of Bartok, mediteranean, latin, jazz and maximalism [the interesting version of minimalism]) are fresh and intriguing, and the group's cohesion is frightening. The new pianist who replaces Sam Barsh is fine, though I would have liked to see Barsh - see \\"As Is\\" the DVD for a view of this wonderful musician/entertainer. Now the drummer. The most visually exciting drummer I've ever seen AND the most musical. I can't imagine anyone being better (better is not the right word as music is not meant to be a competitive sport but language often fails).   All these words and I haven't even really mentioned the music. Well, you know what I'm gonna say!  Buy all this guy's music. You won't regret it.  There is one thing. There always is! The music is very composed, arranged and rehearsed. While there is plenty of spontaneity I don't know how much of the music is improvised. I'd like to see Cohen in a trio where the pianist (someone other than Corea) calls the tunes and see what Avishai does. Avi the side man. Maybe that will be a future CD?
0061537934|3.0|A week after finishing this book, I feel compelled to counter much of the effusive praise with an unpopular critique based on the merits of the plot.  While Enzo is a noble and wise soul whose observations and musings confirmed much of what I believe goes on in my dog's mind, I found the story itself as saccharine and implausible as a Lifetime made-for-TV movie.  Characters too flatly drawn as either too virtuous or completely vile, and a resolution as ridiculous as the last-minute confessions by the 'true killer' on an old episode of Perry Mason.  I get it, the art of racing in the rain is learning to maneuver smartly with whatever life throws at you.  But Denny seemed totally incapable of applying that skill to his own life beyond the race track, and thus unworthy of the fortune that ultimately befalls him.
B00132D808|2.0|If you get this album expecting more of the Fall-Out-Boy-esque sounds of the debut album, you will be sorely disappointed.     It appears the band was trying for something different, to break away from the style that got them popular in the first place.  The horns and the strings gave it a whimsical sound that fans of Rock and Alternative will have a hard time appreciating.    I'm glad I listened through the whole thing before purchasing it, because I would be pretty mad if I had spent the money.
0767812166|5.0|This was perhaps Jeff Bridges' best performance in a movie. He plays an alien who crashes on earth, takes on the appearance of a lady's dead husband, and makes her drive him cross country to meet up with his spaceship. Along the way he learns about what it is like to be human. This is one of my favorite movies of all time. If you can find it (Blockbuster or Netflix would be a good bet) definitely watch it. You will love it.
B000FVQM2Y|2.0|The trailer was very intriguing, so I was excited to watch this movie. I was so disappointed. The dialog was so bad, as if the writer was just trying too hard to sound witty and smart.  But what came out were words that sounded kinda like English, but I had no idea what they were saying.  The actors mumbled a lot, too.  At the 53 minute mark, I ceased to care what happened next.
0783225857|5.0|I Bought This Movei for My Grandaughter, She Loves The Book And The film    Regards!!Mr Michael Del Priore
0399246665|5.0|These books are so cute.  A real gem for any child.  My oldest is 10 and she still can't part with her Eric Carle books!
B0014I4KIK|5.0|Rockferry CD arrived immediately and in perfect condition.  I am very happy with the CD and the transaction.  Thank you very much !
B00000G3PA|2.0|the best thing about this movie is it's fast paced and therefore the pain of various scenes is short-lived.  also, there's some good one-liners on the moon.  however, this movie attacks you with a blended mash of movie standards such as: the macho hero, the love interest, patriotism, action, rising music to artificially stir your emotions, the scientific genius,  the misunderstood father, the misunderstood daughter, suspense, comedy,  the bumbling bureaucrats, the rough-edged construction workers and of course, highly improbable drama.  it's the full playbook crammed together, and because of that, it's virtually an educational guide about what not to do.  it's a total mess overall, and horrible science fiction, but grabs your attention here and there.  Unfortunately, though not even a decade old, it seems very outdated, largely b/c of the theme and the presence of the twin towers, but also because the computer effects are embarrasing in several places.  overall, highly ridiculous.
B0000073NC|5.0|Another great early Scorpions album.  This album opens with arguably the best Scorpions song ever recorded in 'Speedy's Coming' and closes with hypnotic 'Fly to the Rainbow'.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the band you probably already owned this album on record or cassette tape growing up.  It is definately worth the price to purchase on CD as the band sounds even cleaner than they already did on vinyl.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|Five years after the decent, yet sonic catastrophe that was Vapor Trails, Rush returns with this masterpiece, their first since Power Windows, back in 1985.  With repeated listenings, this album will open up to you - like a blooming rose.
B00006WKSZ|5.0|If you only buy one Scorpions album from their early years with RCA records than this would be it.  All of their early hits are on this live album along with a couple of fun covers.<br /><br />For those who have not seen the Scorpions live, they are one of the cleaner sounding bands and it definatley comes through on this live album.<br /><br />On a side note, this is Herman Rarebell's first album with the band.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Also heard it on NPR and discovered it. It's a brilliant album, cover-to-cover, one of the true ones you can listen to in order and just sit back and enjoy. It really has a theme and a progression.    Beautiful stuff.
B000001EUP|5.0|Arguably the best hard rock album of all time.  This album rocks from start to finish with hits like the title track, No One Like You, Dynamite, Arizona, China White and Can't Live Without You.<br /><br />I remember being a child in the 80's when everybody was flying high and this was one the soundtracks to everyone having a good time.  Always a great album to play to get in a good mood.  An absolute party album.<br /><br />I like this album so much that I almost got the Blackout guy tatooed on my arm (Thank God I didn't).
B000EHSVQ4|4.0|This is the film that should have been seen by everyone the theaters. The extended edition contains all of the character development that was missing in the original. In addition, there is a bit more attention to Balian's faith journey. I would still have liked to have seen more in that regard but happy for what there is now in the extended DVD.
B000ANVPPQ|5.0|Great movie! Cute story. Maureen O'Hara and John Wayne have a magnetic chemistry which makes this movie work.  Chill Wills is always fabulous in his supporting role.  Comedy, romance, love, stubborn pride, etc.  Nice romantic comedy with a western setting.
B001E5FYS8|5.0|No real words exist to explain it.  A masterpiece straight up.  Beyond belief.  Should be seen by everyone.  I am haunted by the music by Erik Satie called Gymnopedies 1.  Not to be missed!
B00003XACV|5.0|To me this music MADE American Beauty the great movie it was. Along with RUSHMORE this is my favorite sound track of the last ten years. Thomas Newman did a SUPERLATIVE job combining audio power with visual mystique and this made the movie's great plot even GREATER. I miss the fact they don't seem to make movies like this any more and it was LESS than ten years ago. Nor have I heard any soundtracks this powerful either.
B00009Y3L4|5.0|One of the better musicals and great Fosse choreography.  Joel Grey is stupendous as the MC and his musical skits are great entertainment.  Liza Minnelli is supreme as Sally Boles.
B00000DR5D|5.0|I'm not an expert on TD, but I know what I like.  Other reviews have complained that this is a live album with overdubs added, as if this is something to complain about.  Personally, I'm more concerned with the overall sound and feel of the album.  And may I say IMHO, I love this album!  Let's face it.  Many of their studio albums had overdubs and double tracking etc., and that is not necessarily a bad thing.  Those practices became very common in the '70s.  So, these guys took a live performance and added some overdubs to make a more entertaining album.  That's perfectly okay with me!  You're not going to hear this music on any other album!  This is Ricochet!  This is it, baby!  The album sounds great!  It drifts into some more discernable melodies than some of their earlier, more spacy works.  Still, it maintains the basic spacy, ethereal, exotic, gloomy maybe a bit spooky, obscure qualities that made them famous.  Synths, sequencers, maybe a quick bout with drums here and there, computerized music....a little piano and electric guitar thrown in for good measure.  TD purists may put it down for not being a 'true live album'.  That means nothing to me.  This has the spacy, spooky obscurity of TD's earlier stuff, with some melodic tendancies.   This is a pleasant TD album, and an exquisite listening experience.  And isn't that what listening to music is all about?  At least for Tangerine Dream fans?  If you're a TD fan, this is a good pick.  But if you're just a snob, well.......
031606792X|5.0|I have enjoyed all of these books in the series.  I really enjoyed this one because of the twist.  I was not expecting it and I would have never been able to guess it either.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading it and could not put it down.
B000LE0THO|5.0|I was skeptical as to whether it was worth buying this album again, as the previous CD sounded good enough to me.<br /><br />I was wrong. Right from the first side, everything is clearer and more detailed.<br /><br />The remastering becomes very apparent on \\"Across The Border\\"; the brass section break is clear and distortion-free, and the final orchestral slide is breathtaking.<br /><br />I could argue with the bass levels at a few points. \\"Sweet Talkin' Woman\\" is a little bass-heavy at one point, and \\"Standin' in the Rain\\" is a little muddy until the second chorus--but to be fair, that just means it sounds like the previous release. Lacking personal access to the master tapes I'm willing to believe that's how it should have sounded.<br /><br />Things get better again for \\"Summer and Lightning\\". \\"Mr Blue Sky\\" isn't amazingly improved, perhaps because it has always received careful attention in previous remasterings.<br /><br />Improvements in the second half of the album are less noticeable, but still welcome.<br /><br />On the down side, there are (still) a few fadeouts in the high end of the right channel of \\"Night in the City\\", but the tape dropout/fadeout at the end of \\"It's Over\\" is removed. The transient peak towards the end of \\"Standin' in the Rain\\" is still there.<br /><br />Overall, well worth the upgrade, unless you're prepared to spring $25+ for the Japanese import.
B00177Y9ZC|3.0|I'll be brief.  This movie was entertaining to watch and it was fun.<br />But it left me wondering if it came from a book.  The movie leaves the watcher with too many questions unanswered.  I will buy the book to figure out the movie.
B0015FWRHS|5.0|After seeing this trio at the Blue Note in New York, I was inspired to pick up this cd and actually ended seeing them again the next night. All I can say is that I can not stop listening to this cd!!!! All three members are incredible. Shai's subtle and deceivingly simple greatness compliments Avishai's upfront role as bandleader perfectly. Mark's drumming is awesome and original, steering clear of any sort of common drumbeat. All three sound great when soloing (which Avishai does most of), but since the band is basically just a rhythm section, they can groove really hard too!!! Honestly though, i can not say enough great things about this cd!!! Buy it!!
B000MGUZKM|1.0|Not very interesting I am a real fan of Ms. Randy Crawford and this was not a good buy.
0312330537|5.0|This book is captivating, brillantly involved. The author tells a remarkable story that brings the reader in, allows the reader intimate knowledge of exactly how it feels to be in Bombay and on the run. Fantastic page turner. Loved It!
B0014I4KIK|4.0|This CD has a 60's - Dusty Springfield - Cilla Black feel that I really like.  \\"Mercy\\" is a great song - love the percussive sound of it.
B000YDOOUK|4.0|This album is pretty good, no doubt. However, if you like Airbourne you should be thrilled with Rhino Bucket. Rhino Bucket has been around since 1990 and are without question the next best thing in lieu of AC/DC. In fact, in the early 90's Simon Wright, one of AC/DC's former drummers, joined Rhino Bucket for a short while. So, as I said, if you like AC/DC, [[ASIN:B000M8NMMS Rhino Bucket]] is the next best thing. If you like Ozzy era Black Sabbath, [[ASIN:B00006RST4 Sheavy]] is the next best thing. If you like Dio, [[ASIN:B000ENUYQI Astral Doors]] is the next best thing. If you like Led Zeppelin, [[ASIN:B0001Q5YDQ Kingdom Come]] is probably the next best thing. If you like Vanilla Ice, jamming [[ASIN:B00125NJ64 ice picks]] in your ears is the next best thing, in fact, it's the better thing. Anyway, take a little time and check out the bands I mentioned, I know you'll be glad you did. Also, FYI, instead of buying an Airbourne or Rhino Bucket album you could just wait for AC/DC's new album 'Black Ice' which is scheduled for release in a couple of months. Or hell, just buy 'em all, it's only money, you'll make more!
031606792X|4.0|Product arrived before the scheduled arrival date!! Although, the condition of the book wasn't perfect, but that is probably due to the handling of the package while in route.  Thank you so much!!!!
0201721481|5.0|Although the pace may not be easy for someone completely new to programming, this an exellent book for learning the C++ language. It now introduces the C++ standard library early in the book, before getting into object-oriented programming and C++ class design and implementation. This makes it easier to start writing useful programms sooner. Organization, clarity and style are outstanding.
B0016NF06O|2.0|This effort is not blues, jazz or country. Probably just someone's good idea to sell product.  Wynton Marsalis is a fine jazz artist and should stick to that genre. Although seem to remember he did some real nice stuff with the Grateful Dead. Willie Nelson is best known for being Willie Nelson as well as a great songwriter.  He should stick to being his iconic self and songwriting. Am I the only person who does not want to hear him sing or play guitar?  His band is usually composed of friends and family members who are not always good musicians. If you enjoy Willie's singing and like to hear his band, then, by all means buy this. Otherwise avoid it and look for just about anything else Marsalis has recorded. Or, if you are looking for blues music, suggest you buy something by a blues artist. If you are looking for a style of blues that this sort of tries to be (this is not blues), listen to Taj Mahal.
B000002H33|4.0|I'm just starting to visit some of Metallica's older work and thus far I'm impressed.  One thing that struck me when listening to this album was how much more interesting Metallica was than many of their peers from this era.  While other bands were writing sweaty paens to the female anatomy and the travails of being on the road, Metallica was tackling such heavy subject matter as substance abuse (\\"Master of Puppets\\"), mental illness (\\"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\\"), assembly line war (\\"Disposable Heroes\\"), and dangers of evangelism (\\"Leper Messiah\\"), all book-ended by two heavy shout along numbers, \\"Battery\\" and \\"Damage, Inc\\".  There's even a foray into sci-fi/horror territory with \\"The Thing That Should Not Be\\" and a complex instrumental in the form of \\"Orion\\".<br /><br />That Metallica was able to delve into these deeper themes without sacrificing the intensity of their music is impressive.  Metallica's musical chops are on full display with virtuoso work from lead guitarist Kirk Hammett, bassist Cliff Burton, and drummer Lars Ulrich, as well as hammerblow rhythm work from vocalist/guitarist James Hetfield, whose surly growl give these songs life.  The music and the lyrics are well crafted and intelligent, definitely placing Metallica atop the pack of 80's hard rock/metal groups.
B001AW9DKK|4.0|Anything by CSNY is good.     They are one of the very few groups who have kept both their musical and political integrity.      Their poetry, constantly evolving spirit, and political sensibility combine with one of the best classic rock foursomes that ever picked up instruments.     When they wail I feel it in my bones, and when they croon, my soul softens. Their intellect and musicality has just grown through the years.   If they do it, I'll buy it.    What else is there to say.
0316143472|3.0|A few years back word got around that one of Sedaris' first books (Naked) was to be made into a film. The idea seemed impossible. \\"Naked\\" is a seemingly random group of short stories. Sporadic but polished diary entrees at best. There was no real story there. Matthew Brodrick was rumored to be attacked to the project and it seemed for a short time that it was actually going to happen, then things, I guess fell apart. Since \\"Naked\\" Sedaris has written several other books, \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\", \\"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim\\" and now \\"When You Are Engulfed in Flames\\".<br /><br />The books all follow the same pattern, Sedaris takes notes and entries from his diary and/or life experience, seasons them with humor and slight exaggeration and then presents them as self-depreciating musing about his family, his world, and himself.  They are like candy to read (his stories/observations often around a dozen pages or so long) and often bring forth a chuckle or two if not a full blown guffaw. The inherent problem however is that when Sedaris wrote \\"Naked\\" (fresh from the success he had with his masterpiece \\"Santaland Diaries) he seemed to have a gold mind of material or maybe it was that his style seemed so fresh and new; but now there seems to be few surprises. Not that familiarity breeds contempt, but perhaps it breeds a slight bit of boredom. Such excerpts from \\"...Flames\\", like \\"Solutions to Saturday's Puzzle\\" and \\"Of Mice and Men\\" are very funny and biting. Others seem to tread over to familiar territory. \\"The Smoking Section\\" (a far too long story about Sedaris quitting smoking in Japan) has us back in a classroom with our hero learning Japanese. Funny, but not unlike \\"Me Talk Pretty Some Day\\" when our hero was learning French. There are also more stories about his youth, his hard smoking colorful mother, the cranky father, his boyfriend Hugh. All are enjoyable but all are very familiar.<br /><br />As I look back on this book as well as his others, the idea of a movie makes more sense now. With each book we get a little more nuance, a little more filler. As a whole the books reflect a sort of non-liner auto -biography and right now that's good enough for me; but it begs the question: Can a David Sedaris movie be made? Maybe if you mined all of his work. If Hollywood were to bite again, what's the worst that could happen? Perhaps it might give David more material for his next book.more sense now.

0316143472|5.0|Straight from the Van Gogh on the cover through an essay on the practicality of the colostomy bag. The book is filled with the sort of uncomfortably wonderful humor that we have come to expect from Sedaris. Whether you've read his previous five novels or are picking up your first, you'll love this book.
B00005JNJV|5.0|Batman Begins is a really good movie. I  enjoyed it because it wasn't like the comic book depictions I have seen in the past. It was more for an adult audience and showed how he got to be Batman and why. It didn't have all the silly, stupid things that the old movies had. It was more like a drama and my whole family really enjoyed it. Christian Bale was excellent as Batman and everyone in the movie did a terrific job.

0143038419|2.0|Against the better recommendations of several friends, I picked up this book at my local library.  It started out well enough...I was appropriately sympathetic to Ms Gilbert's relationship woes.  Who hasn't huddled on a cold bathroom floor, sobbing, at 3A?  And the Italy segment was fun, as she slowly pulled herself together with the help of pasta, pizza and gelato.  Oh, and scrumptious young Italian boys.  Her ruminations on WHY she picked this particular time to be celibate were particularly amusing.      Then it all went downhill.  Too, too much of Ms Gilbert is really not a good thing.  While she is genuinely funny at times, she obviously stretched too far for the jokes (and that's just poor editing, someone needed to tell the writer when to STOP) and the self-absorption just became annoying.  While I can certainly relate to the joys of a road romance to rekindle one's inner spark, her descriptions of the Brasilian were tedious and lacking any real fire about HIM.  The fire was all reserved for herself.    I think, ultimately, this would have been terrific as a 3-part installment in Cosmo or Oprah's magazine.

B0019MU6HU|2.0|Although 'The Heroin Diaries is marketed as a \\"unique memoir of addiction\\", this book is, at best, a collection of repetitive drug induced snap shots with absolutely no depth or insight. To sum up the book, Nikki Sixx: Does blow, sleeps with groupies, shoots heroin, hates mom and dad...does blow, sleeps with groupies, shoots heroin...then in the end he dies and comes back. Although the book tries to capture the hellish existence of addiction, it fails to bring the message home since Nikki, at times, glorifies his lifestyle. Also, the commentary provided fails to expand on Nikki's entries in an insightful manner. Instead they only confirm to us that 'yeah..great party, lots of girls.. wow Nikki is F*cked up\\". This book is about 300 pages too long and it only serves to crush curiosity instead of providing a life altering message.  Borrow it if you can.

031606792X|5.0|I felt that Ms. Meyer drew together a real ending to Bella Swan's story.  Ms. Meyer gave Bella everything she desired through marriage and gratuitous sex with her husband Edward. She carried a child, kept her family safe and was granted the inclusion of her father in her life after she had become a vampire.  I was very pleased that Ms. Meyer did not shy away from the very controversial birth of \\"Nessie\\".  It would have been preposterous to think that childbirth would have been less bloody and disturbing, especially in the case of Bella and her carriage of a half-human child.  I found the story brillant and fun. Thank you to Ms. Meyer for giving me an intelligent and caring story about love and fantasy.  It was a pleasure to discuss the novels with my 14 year old son during and after the reading of each novel.  We adored them. We look forward to Edward's story as well as anything else Ms. Meyer decides to grace us with in print.
B00127RAJY|5.0|OK girls I LOVE this video.... I just started it today. It is 20 minute workout and there are three one is Beginners then Intermediate then Advanced.  OK I just did the Beginners and it kicked my butt.  There are two girls doing the workout with Jillian and one is doing Beginner the other is Advanced this is WITHIN the Beginner workout.  I ended up starting to follow the Advanced girl and ended up barely keeping up with the Beginner. It is simple basic stuff you would learn in high school but Butt kicking. I can see it really doing some weight loss after a couple weeks even.  I can't imagine what the Intermediate and Advanced brings. It is quick and easy oh and it is the woman that personally trains the people on Biggest Loser reality show.  Anyway definitely grab a copy if you are interested!

031606792X|5.0|Man, there is not much I can say about this novel, without giving anything away. [My wife is reading this saga as well, and I have had to bite my tongue in order not to say anything to her about any part of the story ¡V it¡¦s been hard!] º    There was one part in the story where I wasn¡¦t sure exactly what was going on, and I realized it at the exact same time as the main character ¡V that is how awesome Stephenie¡¦s writing is! º    Another thing that I absolutely loved was the clarification that the ¡§werewolves¡¨ that we¡¦ve known all along are not ¡§traditional¡¨ werewolves ¡V rather they are shape-shifters (which is how I referred to them in my review of New Moon) Stephenie did hint of the true werewolves, known in her universe as the Children of the Moon [dare we hope for a future werewolf novel?!? That would be Awesome!]    Of the Entire Saga, Eclipse is probably still my favorite one, though this book had a good ending to the Saga as well.   Now, Stephenie has stated that this is the end of the Saga - from Bella¡¦s Perspective! ¡V She has not stated that she will never return to the Cullen Universe ¡V in fact, she is already working another novel ¡V Midnight Sun, I believe it¡¦s called, which is basically going to be Twilight from Edward¡¦s perspective, rather than Bella¡¦s ¡V Very Interesting Idea!! I know that I am looking forward to any future novel that Stephenie writes!!
B001AII4RM|5.0|This is a great movie, the only thing was i had to change my blu-ray players settings in order to watch the movie. I found out that the movie will not play on the 24p setting you must change it to the 60p setting in order to watch it. Other then that I would recommend this, great graphics, digitally enhanced people and good special effects made it a good buy for me.
B001DRF84W|5.0|I've always liked the Ang lee version of the Hulk even though at the time most people didn't.  After watching the 2008 summer version of the Hulk (The Incredible Hulk), I had to say that I really hated the new 2008 version.  I thought the movie had no plots, horrible action sequences, and was just plain dumb.  The 2003 version is really good, and I was really looking forward to it be released on blu-ray.  Now that it's coming out, I'm definitely buying it.
1574535811|4.0|I purchased this book after hearing about it for years from different sources. Read it in only three sittings because it was so fascinating.  I have incorporated much of the book into my daily life, especially what I eat.  Study seems to be irrefutable.  Health is largely a result of lifestyle, including dietary habits. I have changed mine.  Only negative comment is the book is a little more academic than I would have preferred.
B000068FWC|5.0|This album originally came out in 1979 when I graduated from college.  It's wonderful to hear these songs again!  Of course, \\"the Logical Song\\" was a big hit and brings back lots of memories.  Highly recommended.

B000EK76K8|3.0|I bought this product because I wanted to view my macbook in my Panasonic HDTV 1080p at 1920x1080 px , but this product don't fill the TV like PS3 does, it put the high resolution but let one inch of margin in all the sides of the TV,<br /><br />Is expensive for a adapter and if you want to put you mac on a VGA monitor need to buy another adapter, even if you want to put a movie in a old TV have to buy other adapter, its a shame that apple don't make this directly to HDMI because you need to buy a DVI-D Male to HDMI.
031606792X|5.0|I found Breaking Dawn to be a perfect ending to a perfect love story.  I read the whole series within a week. I could not put the books down even though my eyes were dry and blurry. I had to keep running back and forth to the bookstore to get the next book. I absolutely fell in love with Edward and Bella and am sad to see the story end. However, I am so glad to have a happy ending and would not change anything except...perhaps..a little more details of the honeymoon.
B001BKXUOQ|5.0|Those that mock the validity of Slipknots supremacy in all forms of rock should now bow and bang their heads to Knots awesome new release \\"All hope is gone\\".   Some say it is too much like the individual side groups most of the band members have but they are missing the beauty found in the places the listener is taken to by all of the Band members experiences coming crashing together.    Heavy, hard, vocal beauty and terror all in one awesome package!   They deserve every accolade they receive and to those that do not like the release, well, give it to someone that really appreciates great ROCK!

B00004Y6TQ|3.0|3 1/2    Interesting soundtrack for Trier's \\"Dancer in the Dark\\" finds his star Bjork weeping and wailing her unique ways as usual over more orchestrated, but still familiar territory. Everything sounds good in a darkly whimsical and kooky sort of way, with typical electronic and vocal over-indulgences robbing most tracks of being completely spot-on, though the final track certainly ranks amongst her best work.

B00005JLD4|3.0|The Aboriginal people were invaded in 1931 by white people.  They lived in Western Australia.  A special law was put into place called the \\"Aborginies Act\\", where every aspect of their life was controlled.  The children were named \\"half cast\\" because of their fathers' being white.  Mr. A.O. Neville was the legal guardian and chief protector.  He had the power to remove any \\"half cast\\" child from their family.  The story is true.  Molly Craig age 14, sister Daisy Katable age 8, and cousin Gracie Fields around age 10 or 11, all lived close to the Jingalong Storehouse Depot.  Molly's mother spoke of how the white man came in and set up a storehouse where food was rationed on a daily bases.  This is also where the Aborginal people received other supplies such as clothing.  Molly's father, a white man, worked on a fence named \\"rabbit proof fence\\".  This fence was said to be 1500 miles long and went from sea to sea.  This fence was for containment of the Aborginal people.  Molly and her mother was watching a hawk fly and Molly's mother told her that it was a spirit bird and that it would always look after her.         The Aborginal people were extremely aware of how to track for food and had sacred spiritual beliefs which will be beneficial to this story.  Mr. Neville had told his people to go and pick up Molly, Gracie and Daisy and take them to the dormitory at Moore River.  Mr. Neville spoke proudly of the fact that once the Aborginal children were bread into white family that by the third generation there would be no trace of the color of their skin.  They would be considered white.  But Mr. Neville would be the one to decide whether their skin was fair enough to be bread.  They had to be light skinned enough to start the process.  The girls were caught and brought to the dormitory in Moore River in Perth, Western Australia approximately 1200 miles south of Jingalong.  Here they were taught how to speak English, and learned the white man's religion and culture.The girls stayed only a few days before Molly decided to go back home.  A man that lived near the compound was known for his tracking ability and his name was Voodoo.  He would go and find the children that ran away and then return them back to the compound.  Once brought back they would be punished by whipping and left in a small building for days.  Even with the knowledge of the punishment they would receive if caught, she was still determined that they would go home.  Through their journey home they were able to stay alive by running into different people that would feed them.  They were even given coats by one lady.  Molly knew that in order to get home she would have to find the rabbit proof fence, using it as a guide.  During this entire time they were being tracked by Voodoo but due to their wisdom, they continually outsmarted him.  Mr. Neville spent months looking for the girls.  The middle aged girl, Gracie, split off from the other two for she was told that her mother was to be at a train station.  She was caught and taken back to the Moore River.  But with determination Molly and Daisy continued to walk.  While crossing the desert they both collapsed from the heat but when Molly came too she saw the spirit bird her mother told her about.  Her mother and others were singing sacred songs and praying for their safe return.  The girls made it back home and they were then covered with a dark paste to cover their light skin.             They hid in the desert and Molly got married.  Gracie had passed away.  The Aborginal people were forcibly removed from their home until 1970.  Many suffered from destruction of identity, family life, and culture which they call the \\"stolen generations\\".
B000B5XOYI|5.0|This review focuses on Burton's Batman (Batman89, Batman Returns), Nolan's Batman (Batman Begins, the Dark Knight), and 1992 original Batman: The Animated Series. I'm excluding Schumacher's Batman (Batman Forever, Batman and Robin), the 1960's Batman series, and \\"The Batman\\", simply because I believe they are the weakest representations.<br /><br />To be perfectly honest, I love Burton, Nolan, and BTAS equally. All three interpretations are so different, that they cannot be compared. And it is really annoying that I find people on YouTube trying to see which one is better (most opinions are biased). So here it goes with MY opinions:<br /><br />BATMAN: Michael Keaton, Kevin Conroy, and Christian Bale have given us excellent performances. Conroy (from BTAS) has the perfect voice for Batman, though the physical depiction seems a bit too much. Bale really acts well as Bruce Wayne, but his voice for Batman is too deep and goofy. To me, Keaton is the ultimate \\"Bruce\\". He has the awkwardness and the eccentricity of the character, and plus his hoarse voice for the Bat is far superior to Bale's. It's too bad that he doesn't get that much screen time in both of Burton's films.<br /><br />VILLAINS: Mr. Freeze, Riddler, Clayface, Mad Hatter, Scarface, Killer Croc, Bane, Baby Doll, Penguin, Clock King, Harley Quinn, Professor Milo, Poison Ivy, and Rupert Thorne appear only on BTAS, and they are marvelous in their own right.<br /><br />The Scarecrow was better portrayed in BTAS (voice by Henry Polic II) than he was in Begins. Cillian Murphy looked too young as Doctor Crane, and the actual villain was much underused in the film. Two-Face had the scariest appearance in TDK; Aaron Eckhardt was flawless. However, Two-Face in BTAS (Richard Moll) had a much better origin. Years of suppressing anger can do that, you know. Ra's al Ghul is much more interesting in BTAS (David Warner); Liam Neeson's performance in BB was just above average as he wasn't very believable to me. The Penguin, one of my favorite Batman villains, has been blessed with both BReturns and BTAS. Danny Devito and Paul Williams have done superb jobs with this antagonist. Same goes with Catwoman: Michelle Pfeiffer had the better dialogue and better catsuit, while Adrienne Barbeau was a better Selina Kyle, and her chemistry with Batman is deeper.<br /><br />Finally, for the Joker we have Jack Nicholson (B89), Mark Hamill (BTAS), and Heath Ledger (TDK). All three of them are perfect. Nicholson has the best dialogue, Hamill has the best laugh and look, and Ledger has the best sadism. Three different worlds, three different performances. People on YouTube should understand that.<br /><br />SUPPORTING CHARACTERS: I couldn't see Michael Caine as Alfred, so it's thumbs down from me. Efrem Zimbalist Jr. and Michael Gough are the ideal Alfred's. Aaron Eckhardt is truly a one-of-a-kind Harvey Dent. I Believe in Harvey Dent! Billy Dee Williams was great in B89, also, and he had the tough and virtuous personality, as did Richard Moll in BTAS. Gary Oldman and Bob Hastings are the definitive Commissioner Gordon's; Pat Hingle is the weakest, but certainly not at all terrible. He's just a bit too short. Morgan Freeman is the one and only Lucius Fox; Brock Peters of BTAS had the better persona, but Freeman had the better chemistry with Batman.<br /><br />GOTHAM CITY: Burton captured the dark and gothic feel of the hellish city perfectly. It looks as if \\"Hell came sprouting out of the concrete and kept right on growing. You gotta give credit to Anton Furst, the film's art director, for creating this atmospheric universe. Gotham in BTAS also has its advantages. The towering skyline, the dangerous alleys, and the red sky make it all more mesmerizing. Nolan's Gotham looks hellish, too, but it looks too much like Chicago (filming location for both BB and TDK). But other than that, it succeeds in creating a Faustian nightmare.<br /><br />EVERYTHING ELSE: The gadgets in BTAS were the most realistic, while the Batmobile for B89 was better-looking. Keaton's Batsuit is classic, while Conroy's cape and cowl is ultimately frightening. The heroines (Basinger, Holmes, and Gyllenhaal) are lovely additions, although I wish Basinger would stop screaming throughout B89. And let's not forget the music: let's give it up for Danny Elfman, Shirley Walker, James Newton Howard, and Hans Zimmer. These are the composers who gave us those catchy Batman themes. We will never forget them or their work.<br /><br />CONCLUSION: Burton's universe, Nolan's universe, and Timm's universe are near ideal. I love them equally, really. I can't wait for the next film.classic, while Conroy's cape and cowl is ultimately frightening.

B00005JPY0|5.0|and it worked! Very rarely does a film get me out to the theaters. I'm more of a wait for it to come on dvd and watch it at home type. But this was an exception. I went to see it mainly for Heath Leger's performance as the Joker. Having heard so much about it, I wanted to see what the hype was all about. I rented Batban Begins the night before so I would be ready for this sequel. And I must say, this movie blew me away. From the very beginning to the end...it kept me on the edge of my seat. You forget how long the movie is...your just that into it! IMO, Batman Begins was alright...but the sequel is sooooo much better. Yes, it does get dark...and this isn't for little children to see. but it is an awesome movie....and yes...Heath Leger as the Joker was all it was cracked up to be...and more. He is that good - all the hype was true. Words can't really describe how great his performance was or how good the movie was...but the fact that people are going back to see this movie in the theaters a third and fouth time speaks for itself.

0143036556|4.0|This book makes an good and convincing case for the importance of environmental issues as they affect the well being of all societies developed and developing.     The book is centered around the collapse of past societies, although this is only one of four sections in the book. The first section concerns the environmental problems of Montana to give the reader a personal perspective of societies interaction with its environmental problems. The second section gives the book its title and Diamond goes into the collapse of several historical societies - the Maya, Easter Island, the Greenland Norse, and numerous other societies. One of Diamond's strengths is that he tries to end on a positive note and in the second section he examines historical societies that overcame environmental problems. The third section looks at modern societies facing environmental problems - Hati, Rwanda, Australia and others. Here the author looks at how the same problems that affected past societies are still relevant because they are affecting societies around us today. He also looks to strengthen the connection that he started in the first two sections between environmental problems and political problems. Diamond goes through great lengths to stress that he does not believe that one's fate is solely determined by the environment, but he makes a good case that a society cannot properly combat their political fate without understanding their environmental problems. The forth section is meant to make all of the lessons discussed in the previous chapters relevant to the readers of the book - mainly well-off, first world citizens. He looks at the obstacles to confronting environmental problems and how to best influence companies and societies.    Throughout the book I think Diamond makes a good effort to maintain a balance view and to legitimately understand and address the complaints that many people raise to environmentalist agendas. While I do not consider this to be an overarching book onthe world's problems and how to solve them, it would be a good addition to the reading list of anyone who wants to understand the relationship of environmental and political problems and some steps that can be taken to solve them.
B000B5XOSO|5.0|Many years ago, the wife of an aristocrat has just given birth to a newborn child. This would be a most wonderful gift from life itself, but it's not. The baby is deformed, and would give the aristocratic couple a bad name. So the husband and wife have no choice but to abandon it for good. On the 24th of December, they look as if they are ordinary pedestrians in the middle of Central Park. But as soon as no one is watching, they throw the carriage that holds their son into the entrance of a sewer. This is the last time they ever see their only sacred creation. The baby is taken on a journey through the underworld. The sewers become his only environment for a time, until he finally stops at an abandoned zoo, where a group of penguins come slowly toward the little stranger. For 33 years, the baby has grown accustomed to the underground circus life, becoming friends with the wingless birds and becoming an accomplice for some tainted performers. Until now, The Penguin has now decided \\"to descend, to re-emerge,\\" with a sadistic agenda lying around in his mind.<br /><br />At the same time, a secretary named Selina Kyle sees herself as a pathetic human being. She serves her devious boss Max Shreck, who compliments her only for her coffee. She forgets to do what even she herself tells her to do. She looks as if she is incapable of communicating with other people. And to top it off, she is killed by Shreck by throwing her off a high-rise building. But as she is brought back to life strangely by a group of stray cats, she finally is fed up with what she has to go through. The Selina Kyle that we once knew trashes her apartment and turns into the mysterious and sensuous Catwoman. And as you can see, both Penguin and Catwoman are to come face-to-face with Batman, but with different circumstances and consequences.<br /><br />\\"Batman Returns\\" isn't just a film about Batman vs. Catwoman vs. The Penguin vs. Max Shreck. It's about outcasts who go against society. The Penguin has lived a life of isolation and hate. He hates his parents for what they have done to him, and he hates the entire world for how they view ugliness. Catwoman, on the other hand, can no longer handle the meaninglessness that people see in her, and she goes against the one corporation that made her what she is now. The real villain here should be Max Shrek, who becomes the one who is responsible for what has happened to/between Batman, Catwoman, and The Penguin.<br /><br />One can tell that this movie is different to the first 1989 Batman film. The tone is darker, the characters are more sophisticated, and the story is more operatic and much more disturbing. It's true that \\"Batman Returns\\" is far more Burtonesque than the original, but the gothic, grisly style still remains true to the overall darkness of the original comics. And to be honest, I really think that this is much darker than The Dark Knight. You have criminals destroying Christmas, The Penguin having a ruthless agenda that involves \\"the firstborn sons of Gotham,\\" and you have an ending that is completely far from happy. Many people will be put off by its overwhelmingly depressing story, but I can easily enjoy it for it's yet another Batman film that avoids one-liners and flashy neon lights.<br /><br />Tim Burton is one of my favorite visionary directors, and he does a stunning job with this sequel. The snow and the overall dark alleys and streets really capture the nightmares of Gotham City. Keaton, DeVito, Pheiffer, and Walken give outstanding performances, although I wish Keaton had more screening time. The music by Elfman is, as always, pure brilliance. The themes for Penguin and Catwoman are quite distinctive, and they really add to the complexities that these two characters convey. The special effects really improve this time around, but the action looks a bit sillier. I mean, did they have to have all that corny music playing while the Batmobile runs amok through the streets of Gotham?<br /><br />With all the minor flaws aside, Batman Returns is still one of my favorite Batman films. \\"Batman ('89)\\" and \\"The Dark Knight\\" are amazing and unique in their own ways, and the same should be said for \\"Batman Returns.\\"is still one of my favorite Batman films. \\"Batman ('89)\\" and \\"The Dark Knight\\" are amazing and unique in their own ways, and the same should be said for \\"Batman Returns.\\"
B000AWYOGE|4.0|My main reason for watching DARK WATER was the presence of the amazing Jennifer Connelly (Labyrinth, Phenomena, Dark City, Requiem For A Dream). She has a beauty and innocence that I find captivating. As Dahlia Williams, Ms. Connelly has this same charming quality, while going through a living hell. Dahlia is being assaulted on three separate levels. She is haunted by the terrible memories of her childhood, dogged by the insanity of her current, ugly divorce, and plagued by the ghostly happenings in her apartment building. Dahlia and her daughter, Cecelia are in the middle of a black storm of  overwhelming forces. A combination that would drive most souls to despair, most minds to break down. Watching this poor woman go through this ordeal is downright depressing, yet Connelly plays it w/ her usual grace. DARK WATER is a supernatural mystery. Beyond that, it is a story about the undying love of one mother for her daughter in the face of abandonment,  desolation, and mounting terror. I watched it twice, and liked it more the second time around...

B001CQONKY|4.0|okay, some may say, \\"4 stars for a superb season of CSI?\\" well, as a season, CSI - The Complete Eighth Season is above a five star. with a gutwrenching opening episode in \\"Dead Doll\\". two of the funniest episodes ever in \\"You Kill Me\\" and \\"Two and a Half Deaths\\", the heartbreaking departure of one of our favorite CSI's (not saying for those who haven't seen), a terrific crossover episode with Without a Trace, and the scream inducing last minutes of the season in \\"For Gedda\\" where one of the CSI's life may and probably is over. so why 4 instead of 5 stars?  The price.  Seasons 1 - 7 all had around the same price, but seasons 1 - 7 had like 23 to 25 episodes each. Season 8 has only 17 episodes, only 5 discs and pretty much the same amount of extras as previous seasons.  Okay, they do give us the Without a Trace crossover episodes in full, but $85 bucks guys? what are the discs made of? Gold?  I love CSI more than any other show, but i'm very unhappy with CBS decision to make the dvd sets the same price as previous sets (Miami and NY both have the same pricing as prvious seasons as well.) I'm aware that the strike is to blame, but price the sets more to the content.  say $65 for a short season.  I'm just saying.

B0019FOC5E|4.0|Enjoyable soundtrack of the movie.  Some of the songs like Chiquita are missing.  I absolutley ADORE Pierce Brosnan but not as a singer! The rest were great & who knew Meryl Streep could also sing!
B001AII4RM|2.0|Great visuals, but a long boring film.  Bought it based off hype, won't make that mistake again.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|I thought that this movie was cute. I didn't expect it to be anything like Anchorman or Old School since those are movies that I would never watch with my little nephew. It was light-hearted and Will Ferrell committed to the character well. I never thought this to be anything but a kid's movie which I think it did pretty well. I probably would rate it negatively too if I thought I was going to get an \\"Anchorman\\" performance, laden with sexual references and curse words. The film is just as it's supposed to be; light-hearted, fun and entertaining and I liked it (and there is nothing wrong with my state-of-mind;-)  Yea, it was cute.

B000B5XOY8|5.0|This review focuses on Burton's Batman (Batman89, Batman Returns), Nolan's Batman (Batman Begins, the Dark Knight), and 1992 original Batman: The Animated Series. I'm excluding Schumacher's Batman (Batman Forever, Batman and Robin), the 1960's Batman series, and \\"The Batman\\", simply because I believe they are the weakest representations.<br /><br />To be perfectly honest, I love Burton, Nolan, and BTAS equally. All three interpretations are so different, that they cannot be compared. And it is really annoying that I find people on YouTube trying to see which one is better (most opinions are biased). So here it goes with MY opinions:<br /><br />BATMAN: Michael Keaton, Kevin Conroy, and Christian Bale have given us excellent performances. Conroy (from BTAS) has the perfect voice for Batman, though the physical depiction seems a bit too much. Bale really acts well as Bruce Wayne, but his voice for Batman is too deep and goofy. To me, Keaton is the ultimate \\"Bruce\\". He has the awkwardness and the eccentricity of the character, and plus his hoarse voice for the Bat is far superior to Bale's. It's too bad that he doesn't get that much screen time in both of Burton's films.<br /><br />VILLAINS: Mr. Freeze, Riddler, Clayface, Mad Hatter, Scarface, Killer Croc, Bane, Baby Doll, Penguin, Clock King, Harley Quinn, Professor Milo, Poison Ivy, and Rupert Thorne appear only on BTAS, and they are marvelous in their own right.<br /><br />The Scarecrow was better portrayed in BTAS (voice by Henry Polic II) than he was in Begins. Cillian Murphy looked too young as Doctor Crane, and the actual villain was much underused in the film. Two-Face had the scariest appearance in TDK; Aaron Eckhardt was flawless. However, Two-Face in BTAS (Richard Moll) had a much better origin. Years of suppressing anger can do that, you know. Ra's al Ghul is much more interesting in BTAS (David Warner); Liam Neeson's performance in BB was just above average as he wasn't very believable to me. The Penguin, one of my favorite Batman villains, has been blessed with both BReturns and BTAS. Danny Devito and Paul Williams have done superb jobs with this antagonist. Same goes with Catwoman: Michelle Pfeiffer had the better dialogue and better catsuit, while Adrienne Barbeau was a better Selina Kyle, and her chemistry with Batman is deeper.<br /><br />Finally, for the Joker we have Jack Nicholson (B89), Mark Hamill (BTAS), and Heath Ledger (TDK). All three of them are perfect. Nicholson has the best dialogue, Hamill has the best laugh and look, and Ledger has the best sadism. Three different worlds, three different performances. People on YouTube should understand that.<br /><br />SUPPORTING CHARACTERS: I couldn't see Michael Caine as Alfred, so it's thumbs down from me.

B000002P2W|4.0|This is the last Who album.  Who Are You was a coda (albeit an alright one) and the albums with Kenney Jones were by a different band.  You can't lose an energy like Moon and go on pretending you're The Who.  You're not, you're the Who's Left.  And that's okay; go be the best darn \\"new Who\\" you can be, but recognize the difference and act accordingly no matter what anyone says, because if you build it they will come.  That's where I think The Who got it wrong post 1978, which is a shame because I really like Face Dances, it just could have been better (you bet! =P).  But I'm not here to discuss all that now am I?  No.  By Numbers...great album.  No synthesizers, no Rock Opera.  This is the return of the My Generation Who (or if you wish to acknowledge the self-referential pun of the album title, The High Numbers Who).  Guitar, bass, drums, vocals and occasional keyboard.  By Numbers is the perfect bookend to their career.  My Generation was the frustrated young man, By Numbers the frustrated man ten years on.  Since the collapse of Lifehouse Townshend seemed to become more reflective about the band and himself.  The song Long Live Rock was the start of a period of looking back, of examining, celebrating, mythologizing and ultimately popping holes in and deflating The Who and his role and place in music and in life.    The dour mood of the album could have been balanced a bit with one or two of the more perky/tongue in cheek tunes Townshend had around at this time - something like My Baby Gives It Away or Misunderstood from his later Rough Mix album with Ronnie Lane for example.  Squeeze Box fills this gap as best as its cheery little heart can though, and Entwistle's fantastic Success Story humorously encapsulates everything Townshend is going on about.  Blue Red And Gray is rather sweet as well.    The Who still had fire in them at this point and it is well represented in the playing and performances.    AND The Who By NUmbers has one of the best damn album coversEVER!  Cheers to The Ox!  The live bonus tracks are cool too.  I mean, Dreaming From The Waist?  Are you kidding?!  Cheers to The Ox again!!!  Great Who album.
0529064847|5.0|While it is disappointing that there still has to be a \\"Cathilic Version\\" of the Bible, it is encouraging that Bible scholars of all Christian denominations are increasingly working from original languages rather than only Latin or Greek (e.g. the Vulgate)translations. This edition, especially because of the expanded footnotes, gives everyone a greater understanding of the inspired Word of God.
B00000JFV9|5.0|This is my favorite Curtis Mayfield album hands down. He really layed it out on this soundtrack for the movie. He was as real as real could get about the street life and the drug dealer and just the whole infrastructure of the street life and the players within the game.  The tracks on this album is right on. A must have. That's all I have to say.

B0019X3ZZY|2.0|Salo makes one question what really is art and the purpose.Is it to inform and entertain and open our minds and arouse the senses? And then wrap it up in a neat bow and watch it for hours and years to come.Pasolini did not really think that way. You only need to see Salo once and it is scorched in your memory forever. You will have flashbacks, nightmares just feel generally unclean. Salo is a classic example of when you ban something eveyone has to see it, it becomes very hip. I could not imagine bringing up this movie in a dinner conversation. And at this level Pasolini's job is done, what people went through during war the unspeakable things they saw and were forced to do the survivors never forgot and carry that shame and guilt there whole lives,Salo allows you to experience in two hours vicariously.
0375424474|4.0|It does not take a trained eye to see that there are basic similarities between animals -- this is, after all what allows humans to \\"play\\" horses and dragons and cats with just a wee bit of makeup and costuming. Most mammals, birds, lizards, fish and even insects have a head, a body and various appendages stick out for locomotion, manipulation and catching prey. But are these similarities just apparent, or do they go deeper?<br /><br />Biologist Neil Shubin documents the fascinating truth that human beings (and birds, bees, etc.) share fundamental body patterns with each other. And that these patterns are well-nigh ubiquitous. Shubin examines the common animal limb pattern: one upper bone, connected to two lower bones, connected to blobs of wrist bones, connected to a number of elongated digits. To make a bat wing, lengthen the digits and cover them with skin. To make a horse hoof, elongate the middle finger and fused the others into a solid mass. But our similarities go much deeper, and Shubin provides a fascinating tour through the world of embryology. It's here that scientists have discovered, by painstaking trial and error, the chemical messengers that form our bodies from formless blobs of cells. He discusses the Hox gene (found in humans, mice, fruit lies and much animal life) that programs an embryo's head-to-tail features. He shows how distance from ZPA (a patch of organizing tissue) determines the length of fingers, turning some into pinkies and some into thumbs.<br /><br />The book is interesting, often exhilarating, and hard to put down. What's neat is the glimpse we get into the toilsome work of the scientists who collect, prepare and analyze fossils. It takes years of work, sharp eyes, luck and a knack for puzzle solving to piece together, say, the story of how mammals developed precise chewing - an ability that reptiles do not have. A tiny tooth found on a beach in Nova Scotia can fill in the gaps of how and when the transition from reptile-style toothedness and mammal-style dentition came about.<br /><br />I had only two criticisms. Unlike Stephen Jay Gould, who tends to write far above the heads of intelligent readers, Shubin tends to write down a bit. Unlike Gould, Shubin avoids scientific jargon, to a degree that is curious. Secondly, he leaves some rather large gaps in his tale. While it is interesting that animals tend to have the same skeletal limb structure, why did they adopt this structure? Is the one bone/two bone/blobs/digits model the only one that works out of water? And why/how did the creatures begin to move in the direction of limbedness? In the ongoing debate between evolution and creationism, such insights would have helped answer the nagging questions that even proponents of evolution have about the mechanisms behind it.<br /><br />Still, \\"Your Inner Fish\\" is an accessible and informative read about the personal process of collecting bones and the intriguing conclusions that science has made about our relationship with all (and I mean all!) animal life. The next time you listen to the radio, thank the ancient fish whose jawbones evolved into the bones of your ears.

B000BTJDGC|2.0|First, being an attorney, I was disappointed with the handling of the courtroom scenes in this movie.  Besides these being procedurally nonsensical, much could have been done that wasn't.    When you have a movie with this topic, why wouldn't you have a voir dire scene when the lawyers are trying to pick a jury?  You would, but it isn't there. Great conflict could have been created in a jury selection scene.  But it wasn't.  The exoricsm scenes were really Linda Blair Lite, and were less horrifying than a Richard Simmons exercise video--so if you are a horror fan, you will be disappointed.  Now the acting was good, but not great.  It was conventional, expected.  How much more interesting would the priest have been if he had some self doubt.  How much more interesting would the defense attorney have been if her potential alcoholism was played up a bit--her own demons, as she remarked.  How much more interesting would the prosecutor have been, if we saw some conflicts about what he was doing at his home with his family.  Much greater tension could have been created--but it wasn't.  Why?  Simple--the writers weren't that profound, that concerned, or frankly--that bright.

Somehow this music breaks down the beautiful, tender side of being human.  It makes me feel vulnerable.  I have never had music evoke such emotion.  This may be dubstep, but it is a masterpiece by any stansdard in any genre
0312360266|3.0|While the writing is a little on the weak side and the characters are a bit clich&eacute; (okay, quite a bit) this is still a book that drew me in.  It's not a 'good' book in the sense that it's great literature or the most creative thing ever, but it is a fun read.  It draws you into the story and won't let you go.  It leaves you wanting more.  Because despite some of the obvious, overly predictable traits of the characters, I liked them.  They're enjoyable to read about.<br /><br />The whole environment has to be taken with a good dose of suspended disbelief, since so far there is no explanation as to how society progressed from what it is now to what it is in the book.  Obviously, there are some fairly significant changes in the whole 'knowledge of the undead' part, but otherwise it reads like modern times.<br /><br />The ending was predictable, but surprisingly, not disappointingly so.  There's no huge twist, but at the same time it doesn't feel over.  It very much has the 'first part of a series' feeling (which, at least, it is) so the lack of too much of a climax seems forgivable (we'll see what I say a few books further on, I suppose).<br /><br />It's a complete piece of fluff, and as long as it's taken as such, I think it's a perfectly good weekend/beach kind of read.  If you're looking for something deep and meaningful (or even something dark) this probably isn't the book for you.  Several (giant) notches about the Meyer series, for what that's worth, though I've read a lot better vampire lore (though I'm not sure any of it was YA).

The dog's eye view of the world (Enzo) makes the story, even with the human (Denny) being so darn dumb off the track.  As a bonus, much of the racing stuff rings true so a superb read for a sports car racing fan (cars that can turn left AND right) or dog lovers and a great read for most everyone else.      If you have never had a dog or a pet you loved, then maybe you might not \\"get it\\"?

Yes, she does an astounding amount of naval gazing but she is self-depracating and quite humorous.  I loved, loved, loved the first section in Italy and so agreed with many of her observations, Pray was hard since she's just so determined to put herself through some tremendous mind hurtles to get to a state of enlightnement, then Love, is a beautiful ending to the book.  Is she annoying?  At times, sure but she lays herself bare and it's an interesting journey with a triumphant ending.

B000HKYN74|3.0|Seasons 1 t0 3 were very good. Quality acting special effects and good plotlines thoughout the series and I was sorry to see it come to an end.    However, Season 3 ended on a cliffhanger, which is only concluded in Season 4. It seems to me that this is somebody's way of getting us to go out and buy the DVD set, if we really want to see those episodes.    If true, it is the kind of behavior typical of people who see STAR TREK simply as a product to be marketed.
B0000251W3|1.0|All Iron Maiden albums from \\"The Number Of The Beast\\" to \\"Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son\\" are absolute classics and timeless masterpieces. I grew up listening to these records, and I know every lyric, every pause, every guitar tone and every tempo change by heart. So, more than sad, I'm really angry to have to say that all the \\"enhanced\\" 1998 releases are complete sonic disasters, \\"loudness war\\" productions with the audio dynamic range slaughtered by whoever was responsible for doing the remastering. It seems that the idea was to turn all the way up the sound of every single instrument and vocal line with no regard to the equilibrium between them within the music's context. I almost cried in anger when I heard those guitar chords at the start of the song \\"Moonchild\\", with the originally carefully distorted tone turned into a mass of just plain annoying, pointless distortion, and all the feeling lost.    Every time I get to write about a dear album destroyed by a \\"loudness war\\" remaster, I ask people to go to a search engine like Google and look up the expression (between quotes for an exact match). There are over 47,000 results for it on Google alone. The \\"loudness war\\" refers to a trend which started in the late nineties in the music industry to record CD's at increasingly higher volume levels, in an attempt to lure buyers into believing that they were getting a better product because it's a \\"remaster\\" and it sounds louder. What happens most of the time is the exact opposite - masterpieces like this album are sonically cannibalized, and often (although not the case here) the audio volume is pushed beyond the limits of the CD format's specifications, which causes parts of the sound to get \\"clipped\\" (cut off, lost) because they don't \\"fit\\" within the available range. I specially recommend that people at least read an online article called \\"The Death Of Dynamic Range\\" and watch to a very popular video available on YouTube called \\"The Loudness War\\", both of which explainin an easily understandable way what this thing is all about. Things have reached such an extreme point that you can find people on P2P networks sharing lossless files with digitized versions of the original vinyl recordings of entire discographies of seminal bands like Iron Maiden because the CD's currently available are just unbearable to listen to.    As always, it's hard to tell if the band had any say in these releases, but anyway, they are an unacceptable insult to the band's musical legacy and their fans. If you want to hear Iron Maiden closer to how the original records used to sound, look for the first \\"non-remastered-nor-enhanced\\" CD releases of their albums.
0743290119|4.0|I found Chasing Harry Winston a much more entertaining read than The Devil Wears Prada. Even though I've recently said goodbye to my thirties and am happily married, these single gals' escapades were fun to follow. It is a standard chick lit tale with a Sex in the City feel. It's easy to read so borrowing it from a friend or the libary is a good suggestion.

031606792X|2.0|i was so let down by this book. i noticed as the series progressed that none of them were as good as 'twilight' none of them had the same intensity. the same sheer brilliance in the descriptive writing. now when i think about it the writing in this book is hopeless. it is like fan fiction gone bad. there is no trace of the original stephenie meyer in here anywhere! no trace of the old Edward that we fell in love with or the young naive Bella that was so perfect for him. once i got to the last 200 hundred pages or so i really struggled. all the buildup for a fight that didnt happen.<br />god i cant even describe my frustration at how badly this book was written. i am a writer myself and i understand that sometimes it hard to pull brilliant stuff out. but surely her editors read this and the publishers and noticed that this book was no where near as good as the original stuff. surely they should have forgotten their deadline in order to be able to get stephenie to produce better matieral.<br />i absolutely fell in love with edward in this series and probably, pathetically, the thing that i missed most about this series was how he was in twilight.<br />now dont get me started on the ridiculousness of the pregnancy and renesmee  (!!!!!!!)<br />and another thing. not to sound pervy or anything. but i expected a little more from the first sex scene with bella and edward.<br />over all, im disappointed. i really thought this book would take over how much i love harry potter but alas, harry remains on top. but i do like this series. i think im just going to pretend that breaking dawn was never written.

B000H5TVJY|5.0|American Psycho is one of those few movies I wish desperately that I had seen in the theater.  This was the film that showed me what Christian Bale is capable of.  If you enjoy his performance in the Batman movies, this is where it all comes and stems from.  Bale has always been great at getting inside of the character and showing what the character is made of.      The book that the movie was based on was meant to be a commentary on the 1980's.  The arrogance, hubris, and lack of empathy that the business world felt to the smaller man.   The lead protagonist, Patrick Bateman (played by Bale), is a yuppie turned serial killer.   He causing pain and suffering in different levels (real and imagined) to those around him.  It's a brilliant dark comedy (though I'm sure my grandparents wouldn't find it the least bit funny).    American Psycho roles out and in the end you don't know what is true, what is is imagined, and what is a lie.   Did the whole film happen in his head?  Was there a cover-up?  Should he have fed the ATM the kitten?  All in all it was a fun romp.  I've owned it on VHS and DVD, and I'll probably upgrade to Blu-Ray if I ever manage to bring myself to go all next gen.      I'd write more, but I have some videos I need to return.

B00006RCNJ|4.0|I read several reviews before I purchased my copy of this concert. The mention of glare ruining the DVD was a bit exaggerated; too many other angle shots salvaged the show. The quality of shots could have been better, but then there's always a drawback to proper angles and exposures in hindsight, when a dry run isn't available in the concert hall to fine tune all the cameras. I found the lighting used more semi-gaudy hues than normally seen.     As for the musical titles, they were a mix of the seldom heard with an established repertoire. What's with \\"The Blue Danube?\\" This one is on all three of the Rieu concert DVDs I've purchased to date (this one, plus the concerts in Dublin, Ireland, and his \\"Homecoming,\\" in Maastrecht, Holland). Besides at least one waltz classic, Rieu adds songs that resonate with the local audience; it's these that are especially enjoyable to hear. His concerts also feature musician antics, which I submit Rieu encourages, and this one is no exception. It accompanied \\"The Skaters Waltz\\" and shorter tunes. I did see the first of such antics that I now see have been transferred to later concerts; nice to see the origin of such doings and how the same theme has been altered for more effective presentation.     The closing number on this concert is hard to beat! It's a South American medley that reveals the depth of musical talent that makes up his orchestra. I heartily recommend this DVD for all Rieu fans.     On a final note, I was spoiled by seeing his later concerts before seeing this one, so I was struck by the relative inactivity of the concertgoers compared to the near mass systeria of the audiences displayed in his more recent concerts. But then the British have always had a reserve about themselves.
B0017ZB8M6|4.0|I have to say I was somewhat dissappointed with this CD.  I love Katy Perry, her wonderful fresh voice, and I love her unique style, but her music was pretty \\"usual\\".  I love the Go-Go's, and I found her to fall into that same bubbly-pop category.  Not that there is anything wrong with that, but I suppose her songs \\"Ur so Gay\\" and \\"I Kissed a Girl\\" gave me the false impression that she was more \\"edgy\\" than the CD actually was.  I enjoy the frequently played songs afore-mentioned, and I enjoy her lyrics, but overall, nothing I would be playing over and over.
0061139378|5.0|This book was probably one of the scariest stories I have ever read. It was creepy in a way that made me remember why I used to be afraid of the dark and of closed doors. As for the writing style, the imagery Neil Gaiman uses in his stories gives just the right amount of flavor and atmosphere to Coraline without over burdening the reader with unnecessary details. Seeing as how frightening this book truly is, I don't recommend this book to young kids. There's no gore in it, that's not why. It's so psychological that it might be scarier to them than if there was actually gore in it. 5/5 stars for Coraline!

Truthfully everyone, it's a disappointment.  I have listened to it several times and while there are certainly songs that I like, and this is Clapton without all of the \\"maturity\\", the harmonies are usually bad (just shy of awful in some cases), the music does go on and it does, in hindsight, seem that they are in love with the new wa-wa pedal, amongst other sound enhancers.    I know, Clapton's God.  But, I'm an agnostic.  Slowhand is great, and the young years are better than most of the older years for originality, but it's not smooth, if that's what you need from a CD.

B000OVLBHG|1.0|I serioulsly don't understand how anyone, specifically a previous reviewer, can say that this is the \\"most realistic sci-fi\\" they're ever seen.  The whole permise is so stupid and unrealistic that i couldn't get past the first half without rolling my eyes many times over.  Seriously, if we had ships that could reach other worlds and far more advanced technology than we do today, we would never send in a single troop to fight these things.  All we'd do is send a few automated ships (no need for pilots) out there to drop a few massive nukes and we'd kill all traces of life on the planet within seconds.  there'd be no need for a single person to die.  dumb.

I do hope she is going to write another book with these characters.  I don't want this saga to end just yet.

006135323X|4.0|Excellent use of science and economics to explain some of the irrational decisions we make every day. Other reviews have captured the good parts adequately.<br /><br />I agree with the review below me. His science is seemingly unassailable, but many of his \\"solutions\\" to problems seem to come from a left perspective.

B00006AUIG|2.0|When a group of workman are hired to remove asbestos from an old mental hospital, one of them stumbles across a collection of old audio tapes - interviews between a psychiatrist and woman with multiple personalities, one of whom is a killer who might be back and killing again.    \\"Session 9\\" is an odd film in that virtually no one has heard of it, but almost everyone who has sings its praises. After seeing it recommended for the third time online, I finally decided that I should probably watch it. Although I agree that this film is well made, especially considering its obviously low budget, overall, I was disappointed by it. Director Brad Anderson does a good job of setting the scene for something scary to happen and this is a very creepy film, but the problem is that Anderson takes too long to get to the payoff. This is a horror film, but the horror doesn't really start until about the one hour mark, making the ending seem all too abrupt, and when it did come, I didn't think it was much of a surprise. Based on this film, I think that Brad Anderson has what it takes to make a great horror movie, but this is not that film.
0385339682|3.0|I enjoyed this book because it was a great look at a small town in a very trying time.  Grisham writes so very well and has a good sense of what it was like in those times not so very long ago.  As some of the editorial reviews said, the book tells of a time, it doesn't necessarily fill with actions.  One feels like you really got to know the characters.  A slightly above average vacation read.

031606792X|3.0|I read Twilight on a whim.  It seemed more Silhouette Romance than Vampire Fantasy, and I was okay with that.  The story piqued my curiosity, and I found myself back at the book store buying the rest of the Saga.  Each book seemed to improve, writing wise.  It was interesting to see the author develop her voice and her writing style over the course of the 4 books.  And I was interested to see the relationships between Bella, Edward, and Jacob progress as well.    I enjoyed the Saga, but found the last piece a bit of a transitional one for me.  It started out answering the \\"big\\" question... Edward or Jacob right away.  I didn't expect that... but I went with it.      Then, I was thrown a bit when the author decided to write from the perspective of Jacob, rather than Bella after a few chapters.  In fact, for the first few sentences, I was honestly confused, then angry, and then resigned.  It seemed she didn't quite know how to tell the story completely from Bella's perspective.  So, she transitioned to Jacob instead.  I am not sure if she fell in love with Jacob, as a character, and wanted him to have more of a voice, or ... well, I have no clue what she was thinking.     The first half of the book felt like a draft that needed more work.  But then it picked up and she found her groove again.  I could see the outline, the resolutions and the thought she gave to her ending.  And, I for one, was happy with her ending.  However, I just don't think she was able to put it all together as coherently as was possible.  She lost the voice of her narrator, Bella, and her own voice a few times in the book.    Overall, I was happy with this conclusion to the Saga.  It is worth reading.  Don't let the 1 star reviews dissuade you from reading it.  It has a lot of potential, and in some ways is completely satisfying.    On another note:  The 1st 12 Chapters of Midnight Sun are available online at the author's site.  I think these chapters bring into perspective Edward's thinking, and helps balance the control issues seen in his character through Bella's eyes.  I hope that the author completes the book and releases it soon.  It will be worth reading.  The author's voice is back in that book, and her writing again, is greatly improved.  She is really evolving nicely and it will be fun to follow her career.  I am glad I followed my whim and picked up Twilight.

But a grief-stricken Dean made a deal with the Crossroad Demo -- his soul for Sam's resurrection.

0312379293|4.0|Those who have read Archer's former novels will find this story does go over the same ground of a lot of them. The book is a bit far fetched in parts, relies on coincidences to pull off the storyline and the central character Danny doesn't have a consistent level of intelligence throughout the story.  The book is however fiction after all albeit not necessarily original. The story is good enough to keep you reading until the end and satisfying enough that you'd recommend it to others.<br /><br />This novel is really a couple of different stories following the timeline of the central character of Danny  Cartwright. Initially we have the pretty much uneducated, illiterate and not too bright from London's poorer suburbs, Danny celebrating his engagement to life long friend Beth, with her brother Bernie in a British upmarket pub.  Four drunk, upperclass men whose successful careers are quickly on the rise take exception to the three drinkers who don't really belong in such a place and don't hold back in bating the poorer class drinkers with their opinions of the group. One line of comments implying Beth is a hooker and they'd like a go when the two lads have finished with her particularly annoys Danny.  Beth tries to usher her group out the back door to avoid confrontation but when they find one of the men blocking the path and the others waiting outside the Danny and Bernie can't resist teaching them a lesson. Unfortunately Bernie ends up dead and with the four men and the barman all disputing Beth and Dannys version of events, Danny is charged with his best friend's murder.<br /><br />Next we have a lengthy court room drama which to be honest is a probably a bit long since obviously with the title of the book we know the outcome.  After this we have a story emulating Archer's own time behind bars revisiting the day to life of Archer's three [[ASIN:1405088516 A Prison Diaries]] books.  Smartly Archer did not include in Danny's character the more irritating actions of himself as a prisoner such as refusing to drink tap water.  In fact Danny's mentor and cell mate Sir Nicholas Moncreiff is probably based on Archer's perception of himself, (a guy jailed for a crime that seems laughable, keeps a diary and gets along and becomes a favourite with the prison staff). Danny basically decides to better himself and become like Nick, even getting the same haircut.  The implausible nature of the storyline is also added that suddenly Danny looks exactly like Nick.<br /><br />The book then takes the reader on a [[ASIN:0312997132 Not a Penny More, Not a Penny Less]] vengeance style storyline which although a lot more far fetched, predictable and unrealistic than that book was is still a good tale.<br /><br />The ending is very predictable, uneventful and a bit of a let down being that the cover blurb \\"prepare for an ending the will shock even the most ardent of Archer's fans\\". Clearly the blurb has not read this book at least not to the final pages.<br /><br />An enjoyable read, not Archer's best work but a decent length also means its not bad value for money.prisoner such as refusing to drink tap water.

B00005JPY0|2.0|How this film ever found its way in the likes of the Times Literary Supplement as a well-reviewed film, I will never know. Even someone as cynical as  I cannot find a way to explain the poverty of imagination in this film as well as in the minds of the critics who extol its virtues. I was bored instantly and never recovered. Where to begin? In the first place, the film's strength, the acting of Heath Ledger as good as it is is not remotely as exciting as has been reported. He is good but doesn't develop very much from start to finish. In the end, it is indeed an over-the-top performance worthy of note but not at all a nuanced performance worthy of comparison to the great dramatic roles awarded Academy prizes through the years. That he is even being considered a prize is driven by sentimentality and commercial hype. Bale is passable - his oddly altered tough-guy voice is inaudible and weird. There is no set; the entire film takes place in a hodgepodge collection of locations across the country. Two stand-outs are the Port Authority of New York City and the Wrigley building of Chicago. These scenes are collectively known as Gotham City. I saw nothing in the performances of the various supporting actors deserving of attention. The film is overly long, the dialog is standard comic-book, neither witty nor fun. The invincibility of the Joker is a joke in itself; just how and why the Joker is capable of defeating the entire Gotham City police department and Batman is never made clear. Is he brilliant, superhuman, gifted or what? The love interest is boring. The theme of corruption and corruptibility is old-hat and witless. The hype makes out that this is a movie worthy of our attention. I felt that I had wasted 2 1/2 hours of my precious life.

B00006D295|4.0|If you are on this page, you probably already know that when this was released in 1975, it was pretty much a complete failure. In 1976, it was rereleased, and not only was the verdict reversed, but to this day has a cult following. This is an interesting work of art in that it combines music, comedy, horror, and tragedy. The movie starts with a wedding. And then we see that Brad and Janet decide to get engaged. The movie actually starts happy, but there are some bad omens as well. (Such as them singing of their love for each other in a graveyard, and when an empty coffin is brought into the church.) They then have some car trouble, and go into the castle for help. This is when the trouble begins. To make a long story short, they are introduced to different monster type characters like Magenta, Riff Raff, and Dr. Frank N Furter. Poor Brad and Janet find themselves in a 'hell on earth.' Brad and Janet are not often seen in a favorable light. But think about it! They had some car trouble; and all they really wanted was to borrow the telephone to call for help, and they  end up corrupted and violated. The big tragedy here is that most of these characters are driven by their own pleasures and desires with no real moral brakes so to speak. (The boundaries of 'this far and no further' are most certainly crossed.) And even the innocent and sympathetic Janet becomes corrupted in this environment. One thing that makes this dvd so interesting is that we have an interesting paradox. We have  characters who fall on tragedy, but music that is lively and energetic. The movie also ends with a major bang, but there is notable tragedy in that no one really gains any insight into human nature, and even the few characters who come out alive don't go through any real growth. The movie  seems to be a hell on earth where the party eventually ends (in a very tragic  manner for some) while the survivors just want to party more.  The dvd has some interesting extras such as a commentary with Riff Raff and Magenta, and prompters if you wish to participate in the show. This is not only an interesting cult movie to follow, but it is a nice way to have a 70s night. It is also good if you want to see a tragic musical.th Riff Raff and Magenta, and prompters if you wish to participate in the show.

The entire book is comprised of letters, so it is easy to read one or two pages at a time, and not have to stop in the middle of a chapter, however, it is so interesting, you'll not stop after two pages.  The authors are able to pull the story off very well, albeit that it is all letters back and forth to different characters.  It is not at all confusing as I thought it might be.<br /><br />As I stated in the title, you will be learning about history (WWII in Guernsey, with the German Occupation) meanwhile, following the main character's love interests.  Definitely enjoyable.  (I didn't give it 5 stars as I feel that should be reserved for fantastic works of literature.)
B001AIRUPE|5.0|I own the special edition of the dvd and I'm debating big time on buying this, because where else has anyone seen the bust that comes with the set??? It even talks! I saw it today in Target and my immediate thought was I'd give an arm and leg up for it. So I guess a true lover or collector of NBC would buy this.
B0019IB26I|5.0|FANTASTIC! The acoustic set is my very favorite.  Not only does John Mayer have a great voice, but he is an extremely talented guitarist.  I think that this CD is a great example of who/what John Mayer really, truly is.   Enjoy!
B0017ZB8M6|2.0|the cd that i ordered worked but was a copy of the cd and not the real thing
B0019HQIGS|5.0|John Mayer will go down in history as one of the very best guitarists.  This gives you a wide variety of John Mayer.  Solo, unplugged, incredible blues, and the popular stuff.  It covers it all.  I really like this DVD.  I think very highly of John after this.  Well worth the purchase if you like: Blues, Accustic, and or his popular stuff.
0060174900|3.0|I purchased the 25th anniversary edition after ready an bit of the new introduction, and was really excited to read the book and didn't think that I would be left feeling disappointed.  I was wrong - the book seemed to drag, I found it rather fragmented, and just as the story started to get \\"good\\", I was at the end of the book, and found myself wanting more, when there was nothing more.      It is written well, but, I would have to say, I really don't understand what all the hype is about.
B000660UN0|5.0|I thought that Eric Claptons interpretation of Robert Johnson's blues was sensational. The DVD provided an insight to Clapton's deep interest in blues and the artists that influenced his early attraction to this form of music. The numbers demand the most inricate guitar play and the artists accompanying Clapton on guitar are from the top draw. The session filmed in the building in America where Robert Johnson originally recorded the same numbers was  particularly evocative and in some ways quite eerie.  Every generation will have its own view on the most appropriate blues interpretation but for me Clapton has somehow captured a special feeling and earthiness that exceeds even that generated in Johsons original numbers.
B000K7VHQ4|2.0|There is so much wrong with the Illusionist I have to start with the two things that are right: first, Paul Giamatti. He does a great job and frankly the only time the movie comes alive is when he's on screen. Second, the character actor playing Crown Prince Leopold's valet. He expresses anguish, shame and shock using nothing but body language and his eyes. Very good. The guy playing Leopold was fairly interesting and can look back on his role here without shame.<br /><br />Now, what's wrong? Edward Norton, sure he's a great actor but not in this flick. He spends the entire movie looking like he's got hemorrhoids. The flat voice, the stiff ooh don't make the itch and burn start up again walk, the dead eyed stare--- none of that looked like a man in love and there were times when I was laughing at him. Plus his accent weaved in and out worse than Kevin Costner as Robin Hood. Sometimes he sounded like an Austrian and sometimes he sounded like a dude from Idaho.<br /><br />Jessica Biel is a pretty girl and she really has nothing to do but look lovely in her role but she can't even do that. She seemed like an android. She walked and talked but was completely souless. Her version of Sophie wouldn't turn most men's heads for more than a night, the audience is asked to believe that this bland, stilted creature somehow held a man's heart for 15 years. Nah.<br /><br />Finally, the big reveal at the end made no darn sense. It was impossible. No good detective would've been fooled, the Romeo and Juliet potion was a cheap trick.
0061148512|5.0|I was hesitant to pick this up, but I am so glad I did.  Plath beautifully wrote her story about a woman's undefinable mental battles combined with the demands of instant perfection from others (academically, socially, career-wise, and talent-wise), her own insecurities, and her own desires to be what she wanted on her own terms (something that didn't happen in her generation.)  I could really relate to Esther in many ways, and I was swept away with the beauty in which it was written.  It was interesting to be someone on the outside looking in on someone who was on the inside looking out.  It was also interesting to get a glimpse of the struggle professional and intellectual women faced with the demands of 1950's housewife society.  This was an amazing read.
051788710X|5.0|Conscious Dreaming is really in-depth--it takes you to all the places you want to go, without making you feel insignificant because you can't (or don't want to) control your dreams.  The title is apt, since the goal of dreamwork is to be aware, not hyper-vigilant.  It touches on Shamanic themes and provides a lot of inspiration and advice for getting more deeply in-touch with personal issues:  those needs and wants that can escape everyday living.  A must-read!
B000GFLKF8|2.0|As far as Spike lee films go, it's one of his better ones, and... least racial. As far as Denzel Washington films go, it's about the same as any other.  I got tired of Denzel after Crimson Tide. It seems he always has to have some racial element in his films. Here we get white cops who can't help themselves but throw racial terms around, a Nazi Jewish \\"white\\" guy, and a condescending \\"white\\" Jodie Foster. Denzel, of course, is the untouchable, unwavering, incorruptible, follow-the-law, smarter-then-the-people-around-him, black man, told to bend the rules, or accused of bending the rules by his white bosses, and chiefs.... even the mayor. It's the role he's been in so many times before, that Training Day was actually a nice change.  The story is simple, and interesting enough to  watch all the way through, but there are no real surprises, and no exciting parts. Everything just moves along at the same pace through the film. It's more the interaction between the good actors that keeps this film flowing. Watch Ocean's 11, or the Italian Job if you want to watch something actually worth watching.
B000N4SHPS|4.0|I bought this movie because I was hoping it would compete with Rocky 1-4.  I was hoping for the best but expecting another Rocky 5.  Turns out this was a pleasant surprise.  The only dislike I had was the relationship Rocky had with Little Marie and her Son.  Rocky seems to have taken a liking to the son but yet the relationship was not explored.  The fight scenes were great the dialouge was lacking. This Rocky did not leave a segway for a 6th movie but what a way to finish an epic adventure that the Rocky's have given us all.
B0011ZNAIC|5.0|As fans of the Seinfeld TV show, we wanted to see Jerry's \\"Bee Movie\\". We were pleasantly surprised to see that this animated movie retains that Seinfeld humor, although in a more family-friendy manner. We were laughing out loud throughout, and in particular got a kick out of the Patrick Wharburton-voiced character.
031606792X|5.0|If you have read the Twilight Series, you've got to finish it with this book.  It has twists and turns and is enthralling to read.  If you haven't read the first three books in the series, make sure you read those first.
B0002UOK04|5.0|As someone who has listened to The Metal all of his life, you might think it strange that I would dare proclaim Wintersun's debut album as one of my favorites of all-time. I too tried to remain skeptical and would often immediately follow listening sessions of this album with other venerable works such as Master of Puppets, Rust in Peace, Heartwork, Beneath the Remains, and the like. I soon found that this album was, if not better than those, then at least as good in its own way.    Why, you ask? It's true that we can easily look to the past masters of the genre and clearly spot moments of inspired grace. This is not to discredit those efforts, only to say that this particular Wintersun album can, in my opinion, stand with confidence beside those others. It's especially true at this point in time when many of the once-respected bands of yore have fallen by the wayside, musical ideas have been recycled for the Nth time, entire sub-genres have come and gone seemingly overnight. Perhaps, like me, you had become disenchanted with the direction metal had gone and you were looking for something fresh, intelligent, and impressive. You need look no further.    There is just so much to love and appreciate about this release that it's difficult to summarize the various ways it is magnificent. It's as though Wintersun forged an entire universe and stuffed it inside the space of a CD. You'll find yourself quickly captivated by the stellar performances of these clearly talented musicians as they bring their material to life via intricate guitar riffs, phenomenal drumming, supportive keyboards, subtle bass lines, and tasteful vocal work. The songs range from wickedly fast fret board burners to stately and expressive paintings of melancholy. This makes for an album that rewards listeners for repeated plays, one where it is possible to be surprised by seemingly new material that you didn't catch during the previous iteration.     Not only is the music wonderfully crafted and performed, it is also nicely recorded and mixed. It somehow sounds just as great on my audiophile-grade rig as it does in my lowly car stereo. The production is exacting but full of life, and sonically never becomes fatiguing to the ear. Each of the instruments seems to occupy its own acoustic space, yet together their frequencies gel into a tasty smorgasbord of sound that puts this album into a different realm altogether.    I'll go so far as to say that you don't even have to love metal (specifically, folk-inspired technical melodic death metal) to enjoy this release. But perhaps it is best to let the music speak for itself; you won't be disappointed with this purchase. I hope it becomes your new favorite CD like it has mine.
B000GIWS7E|5.0|Dream theater will always be my favorite band of all time. Simply because all of the members are virtuosos in their own forte. John petrucci is the most creative tasteful guitarist i can think of. And it is really amazing this band has made such a huge impact on the listeners over the years by having almost zero radio play. This dvd really makes you feel like you were in the audience. If you are playing it through some good speakers and a flat-screen, you almost have to catch yourself not pulling out a lighter during \\" the spirit carries on.\\" I will never and have never regretted purchasing any of dream theater's music or dvd's. The quality is always top notch, both video and sound. Their influences are endless and so is their attention to perfection. This band is hopefully going to be the longest running bands in history. Right up there with the stones, led zeppelin, U2 etc. I think all the members have come to a conclusion after all these years that they can do nothing but keep getting better, if that is possible. I think metal fans will also like the addition of the orchestra for the octavarium songs. The only thing I do regret is that i wasn't there in person to see them live. But hopefully with some luck and hope i can see them for their 25th or 30th anniversary when they play their greatest hits. Until then i can relive DT'S amazing story so far through this monumental concert and documentary.
0143038419|2.0|Obviously, I can't write a review of the book since I haven't read it.    But this I know: the journey occurred after the book was approved...so her eating, praying, loving adventures probably wouldn't have happened without publisher funding.    And that is an important point. The book is being hyped as empowering women to do things that they've been hesitant to do. Which in general is good, but the book hypers say 'just do it!' which is not good. Believe it or not, the 'just do it!' attitude is unfortunately normal. Thus, being broke and unhappy with life is normal.    The book pushes people to live like no one else (like how you really want to live)...but it doesn't stress that to live like no one else, you first have to live like no one else...yes, that is from Dave Ramsey. Ramsey's books TRULY empower you so you can spend a few months traveling, so you can spend a couple hours every day praying, etc.    EPL seems to be victim-based, escapist drivel.    At the end of the Oprah show, the author's mother gives the author a compliment, but the author turns the compliment into an attack...so after all that spiritual growth, she is still just playing the victim, curling up on a couch...hiding from the world.    EPL does touch on some valuable concepts, but doesn't deliver in prose or as a living example. She talks about the virtue of selfishness...I would much rather you read The Virtue of Selfishness by Ayn Rand than EPL.     Concerning saying \\"Yes\\" to life, that is good, but she appears to be quite a negative person. You can just sense her immaturity, snideness, fear, and bitterness.    Concerning eating well, great...Americans can learn a lot from other cultures. But I'd prefer you learn that from nutritionist gurus (like Gary Null), than escapist, elitist EPL prose.    And again, if you truly want to be able to have the financial means to live as you want to live, read Dave Ramsey. He teaches you how to get out of debt and become wealthy in a way that increases personal relationships. Yes, he has a Christian slant, but no one is perfect.    People need to understand that life is short...and the belief systems that we play around with when we are young seriously influence us well into middle age and often beyond.    EPL is being hyped as an empowering belief system or path, but subscribing to/following it will likely lead to an empty, bitter, victim-based life...like the author's.
1416550518|5.0|The oldest  book reviewer's cliche is \\"I just coudn't put it down!\\" After finishing The House At Riverton, you can put it down, but you cannot turn it off. The story resonates.  Yes,it is derivertive, as most of the other reviews mention, but the author has done a masterful job in weaving a story of love and committment with characters that are deftly drawn. Will it be made into a movie,TV show? Who can tell; so much of the \\"action\\" is internal. Like the movie being made in the novel which launches the memories of Grace into our tale, maybe a teledrama would be unable to show more than the surface of emotions and take the sensational way out.  Just read it and don't even wait for the movie.
B0011NVC98|3.0|At least you may find it intriguing. As an English Lit geek, I've always wanted to see Beowulf as film. I knew it would be gory, but I told my husband that he could turn it off during the attack scenes. He wanted to go into it a little further before giving up and I'm glad we did. Besides having an old classic remade into a movie, the making of it was even more impressive.<br />If you didn't like the actual movie, go into the extra features and see how it was made...Impressive!
B0010HOZS0|3.0|Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978) isn't what I would call a great movie, but it is well made and much scarier than this new updated telling. Nicole Kidman is pretty good here, though her accent seemed a little off at times. Daniel \\"007\\" Craig is really wasted in this role. Why give a good actor a part that someone with the least bit of acting talent could pull off? The story does drag a bit, even though it's only 90 minutes long, but it wasn't as horrible as I read in many reviews. If you catch it for free on TV like I did over the weekend, it is worth your time.<br /><br />2 and 1/2 out of 5 stars
B0017MO10U|3.0|This story is pretty similar to some other Stargate story lines that travel through time, so it was a bit disappointing from that perspective. It IS well done and entertaining though. If you want to see some more Richard Dean Anderson, this is a good buy. One disturbing trend in Stargate movies, both this and Ark of Truth and the show in general, is that the humans never find a way of working things out with their enemies (Goa'uld, Replicators, Ori) they always end up wiping them out. I would have liked at least one of them leading to some kind of resolution that didn't include wiping out whole species.
0452289963|4.0|I am still in the process of reading the book. Almost finished though,<br />It's a good book. But I couldn't help feeling that the author doesn't really take women's hormones into account. It's not so easy for us ladies just to be non-reactive and say, \\"Is that so?\\" I felt like it would be great in a fairy tale world. And I am sure it is MUCH easier for men to place this into action than women who are on a pms overload every month. Unfortunately I feel disadvantaged to try to say \\"Is that so?\\" to every situation that pops up. \\"This to shall pass\\"
B0010YSD7M|3.0|SPOILERS. This story wraps up the Ori story line much like how they did Goa'uld one, so it isn't that clever, but it is fun and well done. Similar to Continuum and the show in general, the Stargate stories end in the destruction of all of the bad guys. It would be good to see something a bit different. I give it 3 stars because it is worth the money I think, but it could be better or have done more.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|I was very happy with this experience.  I was sent a confirmation.  I was sent a notice when it was mailed.  It arrived in perfect order.    Thank You for a wonderful job!
0930289234|4.0|I do not generally read graphic comics, I tend to stick to fiction & non-fiction novels, but I was glad I picked this up after hearing all the pre-movie hype!  It is a fantastic read with fantastic characters!  It will be interesting to see how they pull it off on the big screen!!
0061478784|5.0|I watch a lot of anime, so of course I saw the movie before I read the book. Of course I had to read the book (being a bigger lover of books than anime) As my title states is blows honorable Miyazaki's film out of the water. The world is so intricate, the characters so imperfect (in a good way) I love them. Howl, Sophie, Calicfer and Micheal all became as precious as Bella, Edward (Twilight), Kate and Marak (Hollow Kingdom) in my mind. And for those of you who don't know there are sequels!<br /><br />I would suggest this book to anyone. I work at a movie store and have turned many a movie lover into book lovers. READ HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE!!
0800141601|4.0|After the brutal first few minutes of the film, I thought it was going to be a more realistic telling of the Arthurian legend; it turned out to be quite the opposite, but I still enjoyed it.<br /><br />The Good:  The (unrequited) love between Lancelot and Guinevere is more understandable given that Arthur is depicted as being a contemporary of Guinevere's father, and easily old enough to be her father, if not her grandfather, whereas Lancelot is young and very heroic and dashing.  Even so, there is genuine affection between Arthur and Guinevere, and she never breaks her marriage vows, either during the betrothal or during the marriage.  I also like the way Lancelot is depicted.  He is more human; he is not the font of virtue he is depicted as in other versions of the legend.  His association first with Guinevere and then with Arthur has an enobling effect on him, making him a better man at the end of the film than at the beginning.  Also, the evil knight Malagant is played wonderfully by Ben Cross.<br /><br />The Bad:  Where in the world did they get those hideous royal blue uniforms?  They look like something out of a Star Trek movie (or TV series).  It is unusual that costuming makes or breaks a film, but these awful costumes almost single-handedly destroyed the film and any credibility it might have had.  I was trying to watch the film and I kept being distracted by how terrible those blue uniforms were.  The other thing was, Camelot seriously needs a new head of security.  First, they nearly let Guinvere be captured on her trip to Camelot to be married, then they let her be effortlessly kidnapped from Camelot, whisked away as if by magic, then they let Malagant's army waltz right into the city without a fight.  Hello?  King Arthur wouldn't have lived long enough to have gray hair if he was this sloppy about security.<br /><br />Still, I felt the good outweighed the bad in this interesting retelling of the Camelot legend.
B0019FOC5E|5.0|I couldn't wait until it came. Loved going over the songs with my teenage daughter - sharing the fact that when I was her age I loved Abba then !! Wish more fun musicals like this were made!
0140306013|5.0|My 12 year old brother borrowed it from the library and left it in his room one day. I wandered in, picked it up, and could not put the book down for the next five hours. It was amazing. The rabbits were so real, the description so powerful and the storyline so moving. While it may not be suitable for younger readers (my brother said he didn't really understand it, and anyway it's a bit too long for him) everyone older will definitely be able to enjoy it. And they should, too. Honestly.
031606792X|5.0|This last book in the Twilight series was just as good as the other 3 books, from beginning to end.  I read the book in about 4 days, just couldn't put it down.  Being a 41 year old mother of three is proof that it is also good reading for adults as well as teenagers.  Give the series a try, you won't be disapointed.
0140364536|5.0|Once I started I could not stop. It was amazing. The rabbits were so real, the description so vivid and so powerful, the storyline so moving. The rabbits are wonderfully complex, with human emotions and characters, yet are never unrealistic. If you ever get the chance to, you should read it.    This story is basically about the journey and adventure of a group of rabbits. Fiver is a seer who anticipated danger and told his brother Hazel. They gather a small group of rabbits and escape death by a hair. Over the course of time, Hazel becomes the leader, or Chief Rabbit, while others establish themselves as important rabbits in their own right. They go through several adventures, interspersed with sub-plots of the stories of El-ahrairah, a lengendary rabbit, along the way. Richard Adams is a master storyteller.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|This is a SUPERLATIVE film. Love everything about it!!  But, on both discs, there are BBC commercials that I cannot forward through or push the menu button to go to the film. If you pause for a break, you have to go through these commercials  again. Any ideas?
0316042994|2.0|I seldom post reviews. However this book is so tedious, that I have to say that I'm sorry I bought it, and I no idea why it is so highly rated. I didn't see the tv series, so that must have been better. Even 12 years of post high school education doesn't help me enjoy this, and although the writing is somewhat colorful and descriptive, it doesn't make me care about any of these people.  A story about an alcoholic, lots of description, where not much happens for many, many pages,  a very slow soap opera; Thankfully it's not too long.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|I cannnot do *Wall-E* justice as other reviewers have been able to do so.  What can I say?  *Wall-E* is THE best animated movie...so far.  I was just in awe of it, even to the point of tears welling up in my eyes.<br /><br />Wall-E is this little trash compactor machine.  He's all alone in this world that was once inhibited by humans, 700 years ago.  He has one faithful companion, a cockroach.  Now, whoever thought that a cockroach could be such a cute creature?!?!  Wall-E's job is to compact as much trash, left behind by humans, as much as he can.  It's a lonely job.<br /><br />Then, out of the blue, scaring Wall-E, a rocket-like ship lands and releases a probe.  The probe's job is to find a living organism, specifically a plant, and bring it back for analysis to see if Earth is inhibitable once again.<br /><br />Wall-E is excited and lovestruck!  Over a few shy days, he soons learns that the probe is named Eve.  (This proves to be difficult for Wall-E to pronounce and he ends up calling her Eva.)<br /><br />The ship returns and takes Eve suddenly.  Wall-E, fearing that he'll never see her again, catches a ride on the exterior of the ship.  The ship makes a journey to the Axiom, where the humans have been residing for the past 700 years.<br /><br />This is where the action picks up where basically the robots and machines are the ones that save humanity.  You just gotta check it out and fall in love with Wall-E!  Cute cute cute yet packed with \\"sublimal\\" messages that you just cannot miss.<br /><br />Overall, Disney and Pixar gambled big and successfully won.  Homages are a-plenty throughout: E.T., Hello Dolly, Star Wars, 2001: Space Odyssey, Silent Running, Titanic and many more.  You should watch it again just to see how many things or cultural and pop references you can identify.<br /><br />Wall-E is a must for your collection!
B0002858YS|2.0|The Killers really suck, you know that? My reaction to most of this album is \\"These guys are irritating.\\" And since I'm not really seeing any redeeming facets to Brandon Flowers' obnoxious voice or the group's style-over-substance sound, I can't go \\"These guys are irritating, but they can really play their instruments\\" or \\"These guys are irritating, but they've got a unique sound\\" or whatever. It's just \\"These guys are irritating.\\" Here's what Hot Fuss is in a nutshell: an '80s pop album for a new generation. If I liked '80s pop, then I'd probably love this album as much as the rest of the world does. But I hate '80s pop with a screaming, searing, blinding passion. So I'm not exactly privy to the idea of the dancey, stylish synthesizer blips that show up all over the record and sap all of the enjoyment out of many songs (the big hit \\"Smile Like You Mean It,\\" \\"On Top,\\" \\"Jenny Was a Friend of Mine,\\" \\"Andy, You're a Star\\"). There's clearly a market for it, since back in '04 when this came out, the Killers were the darlings of both the American and the British music press. But their routine is getting old. They can't really write lyrics, either. I know this is a common criticism, but listen to how lame this stuff is! From \\"Somebody Told Me\\" (terrible song, by the way)  - \\"Somebody told me/that you had a boyfriend/that looked like a girlfriend I had/February of last year/It's not confidential/And I've got potential.\\" Or from the hit \\"All These Things I've Done,\\" which I think actually mixes '80s synths and '00s alternative rock quite well, has a catchy refrain, and is by far the best song on this album, \\"I've got soul, but I'm not a soldier.\\" How about the \\"Last chance to find a go-go dancer, disco now\\" and  the \\"There is an old clich&eacute; under your Monet, baby\\" thing on \\"Believe Me, Natalie\\" or the \\"Hey, shut up!\\"'s of \\"Andy, You're a Star?\\" The most annoying part of these is not the lyrics themselves, but Brandon Flowers' delivery. I've already mentioned he annoys me, but I don't think I've properly expressed how much I want to kick him in the crotch every time he opens his mouth. See, he sings these lyrics as if he is the epitome of style, grace, and wit. And all of the idiotic synthesizers, which he is solely responsible for, sound so bad that it makes me happy whenever I hear a simple guitar-based track, even if said song is mediocre (\\"Change Your Mind,\\" the non-synthy parts of \\"Midnight Show\\"). I don't mind the sound of the synthesizer itself - Stevie Wonder, Prince, Bernie Worrell, and Pete Townshend are all geniuses in my opinion, and they heavily use synthesizers - but whereas they try to make honestly good, heartfelt music with them, the Killers use them as a crutch, trying to see what weird sounds they can coax out of them to cover for the fact that they don't have any talent in the important departments of songwriting and instrumental aptitude. \\"Everything Will Be All Right\\" especially suffers from this. I guess the huge single \\"Mr. Brightside\\" is kind of catchy the first time around, but lyrically speaking it's a carbon copy of David Bowie's \\"Queen Bitch.\\" Not only to they have the same theme, about a guy's misadventures with a hooker, but they also have virtually the same lyrics - the \\"She's getting in a cab\\" and \\"It could have been me\\" parts are suspiciously similar. David Bowie is much more talented than any of the Killers put together, too. That doesn't help the latter group's case. So \\"All These Things I've Done\\" is good, \\"Mr. Brightside\\" and \\"Change Your Mind\\" are decent, and I at least like parts of \\"Midnight Show.\\" Still... God, these guys are irritating.t I don't think I've properly expressed how much I want to kick him in the crotch every time he opens his mouth. See, he sings these lyrics as if he is the epitome of style, grace, and wit.

So \\"All These Things I've Done\\" is good, \\"Mr. Brightside\\" and \\"Change Your Mind\\" are decent, and I at least like parts of \\"Midnight Show.\\" Still... God, these guys are irritating.

0061562408|5.0|A truly wonderful story, written in the most intriguing way. I never cared for car racing, but I found the descriptions compelling and may reread some to better understand them. The canine narrator, Enzo, is more likeable than many humans and far more compassionate than most. He also might be one of the funniest dogs around...
0930289234|4.0|Although it's a bit dated, it's a classic.  A must read for anyone who enjoys the graphic novel medium.  Gritty, realistic, complex characters move the somewhat simplistic storyline forward. Considering it was written some 22 years ago, it's quite a classic.  By todays standards I found it a bit thin.
B001EL6EHC|1.0|How many editions of a movie do you have to buy before you get the ULTIMATE one? This is ridiculous! Greedy damn companies! Where's The African Queen and why is that not on DVD?
031606792X|4.0|Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed this series, but this book in particular really felt like a one person RPG. I've never felt that with any other book I've read before. There wasn't anything the main character could do truly wrong and it got a little ridiculous! It was still a pretty good read. I enjoyed finding out more about my favorite fictional couple and look forward to Stephenie's next book.
0385340990|5.0|The book was reminiscent of 84 Charring Cross Road, written in a series if letters peopled by characters and a love story channeling Jane Austen.  A group of Guernsey Islanders share their memories of life under German Occupation during World War II with a London columnist who becomes so charmed by the letters, she visits the Island.  The Islanders are brave and ordinary, witty and dour and, to the man and woman, people I wanted to know.  I so thoroughly enjoyed the book, I didn't want it too end.
B0017WI5VQ|4.0|Adele seemingly came out of nowhere in 2007 with comparisons to Amy Winehouse, Norah Jones, and even Feist with her soul-searching songs. After touring in a supporting role for various artists in 2007, Adele released her debut album in January, 2008.<br /><br />\\"19\\" (12 tracks, 44 min.) is a stunning debut, presenting songs all written or co-written by the 20 yr. old Adele. Starting with a sparse \\"Daydreamer\\" that immediately spellbinds you, the album shifts from moving track one after another. \\"Chasing Pavements\\" (1st UK single) is a standout, but just one among many: \\"Cold Shoulder\\" (2nd UK single), \\"Right as Rain\\", and the pensive closer \\"Hometown Closer\\" (3rd UK single) are just highlights. In all, this is a fantastic album from start to finish, with no weak tracks. The limited version of the album comes with a bonus live CD (5 tracks, 16 min.) which was recorded at a tiny venue in Los Angeles in March, 2008, and brings 4 tracks of the album and 1 Sam Cooke cover (\\"That's It, I Quit, I'm Moving On\\") in a stripped down setting, just great.<br /><br />I saw Adele in concert at Bonnaroo in June, and she put on a terrific 50 min. set, bringing most of the \\"19\\" songs. Her backup band equally was great. Adele's widely used comparison to Amy Winehouse and lately Duffy is frankly understating Adele's merits. I can't wait to see where she goes from here.

031606792X|2.0|Well I have to say that I was highly disappointed.  What a mediocre ending to a spectacular series.  I was expecting more.  I can't even explain what I was expecting just anything more that what was given.  I guess being an HP fan made me expect great things from the final book....I mean anyone who has read DH knows what an amazing end it was and I was hoping for the same in the Twilight Saga.  Overall, read the first three and come up with your own ending because anything YOU come up with is better than what was written.
0375701427|1.0|Roth is still a great prose stylist.  And the passages on Newark were brilliant.  But for a historical novel, the history is way off.  The radicalism is cartoonish or worse.

B0018AK9RA|1.0|I would never use this album to introduce Judas Priest to a new listener, unless I would want to embarrass myself.     How could the Metal Gods have done something as horrible as this? I mean, the Priest has made some of the best rock ever... Sad Wings, Sin After Sin, Stained Class, British Steel, Painkiller, etc they're all masterpieces. Sorry but Nostradamus is lame and pointless. This is not evolution, it is a 20-year step backwards in quality and sound.    I've been a huge JP fan since 1980, and I am obviously very disappointed. The music and the compositions are not what JP is capable of doing. Rob Halford is the best rock vocalist ever, but for the most part he doesn't sound quite up to par.    What killed it for me is that the drums and the guitars sound almost identical as in Ram It Down (up until now, JP's worst album ever!). Never in my wildest nightmares I would ever imagined JP would return to that godawful sound. You have been warned.    It's the end of the world as we know it...  It's over.
B0017MO10U|5.0|If you are a fan then it is a great movie. If you're not a fan then why are you watching it. One technical glitch, when Ben Browder goes back in time the gates had not been found. The one in Egypt was still buried and the one in Antarctica was under the ice.
B0017VG69U|4.0|Like many, I grew up watching Star Trek reruns on TV, but I was too young to watch the series when it originally aired in the mid-1960's.  So, I've seen all the episodes many times, but never uncut and complete.  (And unlike many, I never went out of my way to collect TOS on DVD).<br /><br />However, when I saw the new \\"remastered\\" Doomsday Machine episode on TV, I was thrilled by the prospect of not only seeing this series uncut, but with many of the effects scened redone using modern CGI.<br /><br />And yes, they're cool to watch!  I'm sure this remastering process will bring an entirely new generation to watch this series who might not otherwise.<br /><br />The problem I have is with the kooky weird packaging.  All I want to do with DVDs is: 1) quickly find the episode I want, 2) get it out of the packaging without causing damage to the DVD, 3) play it, and 4) return it to the package without damaging the DVD.<br /><br />Instead of using some mundane packaging approach, like individual slim cases in a cardboard box, we have a transparent case that you have to open a certain way, and then slippery cards that you have paw through to find the episode you want, and then leaf through each of the eight disks in what seems an all-to-easy-to-break eight-way jewel case, each with one side exposed, until you find the disk you want.  Better keep them in order, or you'll be reading the little tiny fine print on every single disk just to find the one you want.  The nature of the packaging makes finger and thumbprints all over the \\"non-media\\" sides of the disks inevitable.  I imagine I payed extra for this \\"special\\" packaging too.<br /><br />So, love the new series, hate the packaging.  There are some areas where \\"boldly going where none have gone before\\" isn't necessary.
B001E75QGG|1.0|This is not an Indiana Jones film.<br /><br />This is a FARCE of an Indiana Jones film.<br /><br />I knew this movie was in trouble the moment the Paramount logo dissolved into a gopher mound and a CGI gopher popped up it was painfully clear that this film is a joke that doesn't take itself seriously, like a Mad magazine spoof on the big screen making fun of not just every Indiana Jones film before it but also every Lucas and Spielberg production from American Grafitti to Close Encounters, only Lucas and Spielberg were having fun making fun of themselves at the audiences' expense while laughing all the way to the bank. George Lucas once again stubbornly relies on silly digital cartoon characters of the Pixar kind instead of human performances and lazy digital effects instead of spectacular, good-old-fashioned in-camera stunts and falls into the same pitfalls that reduced his epic Star Wars franchise into a heaping mound of juvenile Saturday Morning kiddie fare.<br /><br />When Indy makes his silhouetted entrance donning his trademarked fedora, Harrison is so creaky in his delivery of cringe inducing dialogue with stilted lines like \\"I like Ike,\\" and \\"Drop dead, comrade,\\" you'd think he was a relic in his own museum. When Marion Ravenwood finally makes her welcomed entrance, I could almost hear the applause track from the studio audience as if there was an electronic cue card flashing just below the screen. Karen Allen spends the last half of the film staring doe-eyed at her hero Indy like a grade-school girl with a puppy-love crush that was completely out of character with her performance as the feisty tough-as-nails Marion from Raiders of the Lost Ark. Shia LaBeouf tries in vain to imitate Marlon Brando from The Wild One but instead comes off like Fonzie-lite. Every time he pulled out his comb I was waiting for the \\"Ayyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!\\" John Hurt delivers an embarrassing performance looking like an acid-wasted Timothy Leary hippie stoned out of his mind and speaking in acerbic riddles pined from the pages of Dr. Seuss and the traitorous Judas, Mac, has no problem selling out his best friend and his country in the name of Capitalism but whenever he's in a bind has no qualms about turning to \\"Jooooooonneeessssyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!\\" for help and to which Indy willingly obliges him. The imitable Cate Blanchett chews every scene she's in with her villainous Russian dialect but takes it so far over-the-top that you'd think she was an evil-doer from a Saturday morning cartoon, specifically of the Boris and Natasha kind.<br /><br />To say that the characters were never in any kind of peril or jeopardy is an understatement. All of the action is so ridiculously contrived and exceed the threshold of suspension of disbelief into a new level of cinematic absurdity that makes the gags in Last Crusade and Temple of Doom look like Schindler's List. If you thought parachuting out of a plane on a rubber raft was implausible in Temple of Doom (and successfully busted by Mythbusters), that's nothing compared to going over three of the biggest (CGI exaggerated) waterfalls in the Amazon that make Niagara Falls look like a waterslide at Water World. Or how about Mutt Williams swinging from vines like Tarzan while being chased by digital monkeys?  Dovenchenko is not just Pat Roach-lite but the fight scenes between him and Indy are so tediously dull and predictable without any of the brilliant improvisational choreography that made the fight scenes so spectacular to watch in the first two films. Spielberg relies so much on his own cliches and once brilliant movie-magic and storytelling that he phones it in here asking us to fall for the old Close Encounters/E.T. schtick that I was waiting for Indy to pull out the Reese's Pieces from his bag and Mulder and Scully to show up.<br /><br />I'd just like to know where the real Indy 4 is hidden. Probably in a magnetic crate somewhere inside of Hangar 51 because what I saw on the big screen wasn't it. In fact, I waswaiting for Ashton Kutcher to step out from behind the screen and tell everybody they just got punk'd.  Kingdom of the Crystal (Bored Outta My) Skull is so drivelously dull that it plays like a TV reunion movie where all of the aging cast members come back for one last big brouhaha to celebrate their lifetime achievement cumuppance. I wish that this film had never been made and relegate it to the same toxic landfill of pointless sequels that should never have been made as Batman and Robin, Highlander II, Matrix Reloaded/Revolutions and Phantom Menace.<br /><br />There is something very poignant during the scene when Indy rolls out of the lead-lined fridge, comes face-to-face with a digital gopher, and stares up at the giant atomic mushroom cloud hanging over him emblematic of watching his franchise going up in a cloud of radioactive dust but I doubt that will stop dogged old George Lucas from running it into the ground further and milking it dry with Indy 5. For Harrison's sake (and ours) it's time for Indiana Jones to hang up the hat.from behind the screen and tell everybody they just got punk'd.

031606792X|3.0|The last of the Twilight series, Breaking Dawn, all in all wasn't so bad. The book for me was OK.  I did prefer the first three, much more interesting. But you do need to read the last to complete the series.
B001DDBCUU|3.0|If you were not fan of the TV series, don't watch. If you are looking for a movie which you can learn something, this is not the movie for you.    I liked the movie very much, and would buy the DVD. But I wouldn't want to get to know the people like the characters in my real life.     Well, but watching the movie was like flipping a huge VOGUE magazine. That was fun.
0451147960|4.0|Ken Follet takes us into the world of art dealing in London. Characters travel Europe on the trail of a missing Modigliani painting. We encounter art historians, art gallery owners, artists, and art forgers. This is not a thriller in the same family with The Key to Rebecca, but it is highly entertaining and somewhat suspenseful.
B000T9OP7G|3.0|I haven't decided whether I like this series or not, I've only watched a couple episodes thus far. But I'm having major issue with what they're doing sending engineer's, helpers and everyone else back through time portals to stage stuff for John and Sarah. If they could do that... why not just send the army of future soldiers back and finish the job to begin with? This is really bugging me. I thought the movie series showed that time travel was extremely difficult. But in this storyline it's easy. At the end of the first episode they even use time travel to escape. Not as difficult as we were led to believe in the movies. Cheapens the whole Terminator universe with this introduced.
B00005JPY0|5.0|I went to see this movie expecting something that was dark and entertaining. And guess what? I was completely entertained! The Joker, played by Heath Ledger, is one of my (if not) favorite villians. Here ihe is played a sick and demented being. And I liked it. I love a good psychopathic character. But, you have to give him some sympathy.    The Joker is a character that has had a harsh and brutal life. So, it is only natural that he is violent and fearless. But that is what makes the character very amusing.    I recommend this movie to anyone who loves the Joker or is a fan of Batman. The acting, special effects, and entertainment are great. So if you are looking for a great action movie, then this is the one to pick.

I'm still working up to level 2, but I get a very good workout and in only 20 minutes, which definitely appealed to me.

B000025H0Q|5.0|Aw no, not another hippy. Not another counter-culture lifestyle mullah.

The sleeve reveals he has John Cale and Richard Thompson (who is rapidly becoming one of my all time heroes) in tandem, so you instinctively know he's running from the winning blocks.<br /><br />Drake's from the Cat Stevens school of smoothy folk-pop but he's far from drone and earnestness. He's got torrential strings, ringing guitar, and more impressively, good songs in abundance.<br />A big music (in a small sense) but it compliments his sweet lyrics and melodies without swamping them.<br /><br />Thompson's influence is immeasurable. Not just here but in music generally. He's enriched works from Sandy Denny to David Thomas and his enigmatic-isms are seized on by Drake who uses them as a platform for his own successes, a building-block to his own particularly pleasing house of tricks.<br />On top, he's got the best use of flute and strings since Tull's sumptuous 'Reasons For Waiting', (which a fair block of 'BL' is very like) and a vital, vibrant album results.<br /><br />Sure, Drake looks all Woodstock, wet and wimpy but his voice has a sandpaper smoothness, and his songs very definitely have depth, insight and unity. He ticks the creative boxes much more than the (deliciously) sarcastic ones above, and therefore he emerges with kudos and no shortfall of credit.<br /><br />He's nowhere near the genius Roy Harper is, (See? That Thompson again!) but 'BL' is firmly on the right track and can fight it's corner with vim and plenty of pride.<br /><br />So, puns well and truly on the back-burner, (and isn't it cute the way that my reviews are circular?) one last condition..<br /><br />Does Nick Drake have a deserved 5-star brilliant album ? - Check.enius Roy Harper is, (See?

B001BGTWXI|2.0|I have been a fan of Slipknot since M.F.K.R. and i have seen the band's decent into mainstream sadness. by far, this is the worst album the band has put out since IOWA. The subliminal verses had its good points, but the only good point about this is the single, Psychosocial. Listening to the album, i grew more and more unenthusiastic about the potential that this band may have come back to their roots, but they couldnt have gotten further from it. every song on this track sounds like Stone Sour, which is a sad, sad thing. It's as if Corey tried to convince the rest of Slipknot that music isnt music unless its moody and boring. Slipknot is not heavy anymore, they haven't been since their self titled album. this is truely a sad day for the maggots. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY! DOWNLOAD FOR FREE THEN IMMEDIATELY DELETE.
B001BR5F4C|4.0|Harvey Weinstein has said SEVERAL times that The Whole Bloody Affair was only to be released in Japan.  It actually did fairly poor sales wise overseas, which is one of the factors why they didn't release it over here.  they were thinking about releasing it last fall in the us, but due to the train wreck of Grindhouse's theatrical and dvd releases they decided against it.  this is not me saying this, this is the Weinstein company's official response to any inquiries of The Whole Bloody Affair.  the demand is just too low right now.  however, never say never.  but as it stands right now, you will more than likely see Jackie Brown and Pulp Fiction on Blu-ray before you see The Whole Bloody Affair in any form in the united states.    On a more positive note, this is an amazing film (or films depending on how you view Kill Bill).  Every Tarantino film is special in its own way (even Death Proof, which is by far his weakest effort) and while this is not his best film (that honor belongs to Pulp Fiction) it is definately worth the purchase.  I normally don't brag on Amazon, but this really is a fantastic offer for a blu-ray set.  I look forward to this release.

B00012QM8G|4.0|I believe this movie should be mandatory viewing by all seniors in the high school system, to show them how cruel and meaningless war was and is. I enjoyed the movie when it was first released, I found it shocking, brutal and touching. I didn't really care for the character Schindler (I found him to be ruthless money grabber), but the characters revolving around him in the chaotic times of WWII was where I found the real depth of the movie.<br />If everyone of our children watch \\"Schindler's List\\" and walk away with a true feeling of how precious life is, then I think we can stand proud as parents, and feel as if we have taught them something that they can teach their own children in the future. That war is war, nothing more, nothing less. That war should be avoided at all costs, no matter what the price.<br />I have two daughters and when they are old enough, I will sit and watch this most important and insightful film with them. I suggest you all do the same.
1400049628|5.0|Ok.  even though you might not be able to practically put the skills learned in this book on a resume (unless you are applying at capcom) it is a very well written book.  From a tactical stand point, many of the described survival and evasion techniques make sense and are very well thought out.  Even if the zombies do not attack, learning the skills listed in the manual will acctually be good for you.  Though the more 'practical' skills are not described all the way through, it is still a great read for any zombie fan out there.

Now if the dad from \\"Eight is Enough\\" was cast as lead, instead of the dufus minor role he had, then I could see the humor come to life, and maybe keep me awake long enough to care till the end, but it doesn't happen that way, and boy-oh-boy, is this movie SLOW!!<br />Be warned.

0439813786|5.0|This was a very unique book and I really enjoyed it!  It did take me a few chapters to get completely absorbed, but after that I was thoroughly interested in the plot and how everything would be resolved.  The book is unique in multiple ways, but two stand out for me.  The first of which, is that it's probably one of the least predictable books I've read lately.  You can guess how the overall ending will probably turn out, but the specifics and the \\"how\\" were (at least to me) pretty unpredictable.  Also, the book uses pictures to help tell the story, instead of depicting what's already been written.  For example, The text might read something like, \\"Hugo walked into the train station,\\" followed by four or five drawings, one of Hugo walking into the station, one of him seeing a friend, one of him running to meet his friend, and one of him tripping.  The text would then say something link, \\"Hugo's friend offered him a hand up.\\"  That's probably very confusing, but I hope it helps a little.  I think it would be a great book for a young reader who isn't too keen on reading, because it is a thick book, but because of all the drawings, you can get through it fairly quickly, yet you still have a great sense of accomplishment.  So, I think it would probably be a good jump-start sort of book.  Though, let me emphasize that, even if you are an avid reader, it's still a great book!

I don't know why people are hating on this book so much... if they could write a better book themselves, then they should go get published!  Stephenie Meyer did a fantastic job with moving the plot along and making sure there was closure in the end.      Major PROPS to Stephenie Meyer for such a perfect conclusion to the Twilight Saga!
B0000AUHPG|4.0|Is this the best Western ever made?  I tend to disagree with the other reviewers.  There are an awful lot of good movies to consider, including Leone's own \\"The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly.\\"  And of course \\"The Searchers\\", \\"High Noon\\", \\"Stagecoach\\", and \\"Unforgiven\\" all must be ranked as the possible number one.      It's a pointless exercise, of course.  This movie is very, very good.  Many images are unforgettable and very moving:  the shots of the train, the shootouts at the beginning and end of the film, Fonda's expressions, the shots of Monument Valley, the scene at the end showing the unstoppable progress of the railroad and the new town.      But the movie has its flaws.  The plot is convoluted -- and not in a good way.  It's almost as if the story is secondary to the power of the images.  The movie is more myth than plot.  This can work, but here the movie would have benefitted from the tighter kind of story lines used in the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.      The acting is truly great.  Fonda is a wonderful villain.  The cold blue eyes and the friendly expressions that morph into pure sadism as he commits one outrage after another are chilling.  Bronson has the ability to play the larger than life hero with a minimum of dialogue.  Apparently, Leone originally intended Eastwood for that role.  It would have been fascinating to have seen Eastwood square off against Fonda. But Bronson plays the part very well, and the movie works fine with him in that role.     The dialogue is in some respects memorable.  Fonda and Bronson each deliver great lines.  Robards doesn't quite have the same material to work with, and sometimes his dialogue and the dialogue of Cardinale seem stilted and not quite up to snuff with the ambition of this movie to be the definitive Western.     It's a terrific movie, but one that requires patience and open-mindedness by the viewer.                                 *****    I've been watching some of the bonus material and commentary since writing the above, and I am marveling at Leone's technical mastery.  The point of the commentators is to see the movie as operatic, in which case my concerns about plot may be misplaced.  The plot in an opera is a second thought -- what matters is the emotion and message conveyed by the music and the images.  One shot that blows me away on reviewing is the arrival of Cardinale at the train station.  A tracking shot follows her into the station (seen through the window) and then a crane takes you up over the station so you can see her exit into a bustling half-built frontier town.  It is an amazing shot.      Leone is terrific.  I'm going to watch or re-watch everything he ever made.     ****    O.K., I give up.  After watching this a few more times, this movie impresses more and more.  The power of the images and music are apparent on first viewing.  The thematic complexity of the work, and its desire to make a movie about not only the end of the West, but the end of the Western, becomes more apparent with each re-viewing.  This is a great movie, and Leone belongs in the first ranks of film-makers.

0307269191|5.0|I am enthralled with Haruki.  This is the first work of his that I have read.  What a delight!  I will be reading more of his work.
B000W91RUG|4.0|I LOVE this show!  It's the most hilarious thing I've seen on TV in ages.  I've been waiting for it to come out on DVD for months, so I could get my boyfriend caught up before the new season begins.    I did run right out and get it yesterday...but I was disappointed.  There is a surprising lack of bonus features on these disks!  In the world of today's shows, it's not uncommon to find an entire disk of extra features, so I was expecting good things - outtakes and commentaries that I'm sure would have been hilarious.  However, not a single commentary appears, and while there is a behind the scenes feature, I can't help but feel that they could have done SO much more.    That being said, the show in itself is still amazing!  All of the actors, especially Jim Parsons, are absolutely perfect in their roles.  I highly recommend this series, but am giving the product only four stars because of the lack of bonus features.
B00159679S|5.0|Though hardly a Wagner fanatic, I have increasingly come to admire, if not always to love, his music dramas for their boldness, sublime pathos, and cosmic scope.  To know Wagner is to appreciate, at very least, where Bruckner, Mahler and Strauss came from (they didn't spring fully formed from the head of Zeus--or Woden as the case may be).  Wagner also has the ability to shed light--sometimes garish, sometimes healing, always searching--on some of the darkest places in the human psyche.  If you fancy modern myth--Tolkien, Lewis, Mary Stewart, et. al.--then you cannot afford to ignore Wagner, who as the pioneer of *Gesamtkunstwerk* (multi-media) may well be the greatest mythmaker of all.<br /><br />If you are perchance a Wagner neophyte with a hankering to discover what all the fuss is about when it comes to this greatest of musical megalomaniacs, then this box is tailor-made for you.  The performances contained herein all convey a unique sense of authenticity, insofar as they were taken down live at Bayreuth, the theater that Wagner designed as a sacred shrine of consecration for the Grail that was his hypertrophic ego (when you're a genius of that caliber, I suppose a wee bit of bravado is allowed).  Make no mistake: nowhere on the face of the earth is Wagner performed with greater zeal and dedication than on that Holy Hill, and nowhere will you find more prolific opportunities to be initiated into the Highest Mysteries of the music drama.<br /><br />Another advantage of this set (beyond its obvious bargain status) is that every one of the ten great operas receives a performance that at least does justice to the music, and some have rightly been accorded classic status.  First and foremost, you will be treated to the greatest *Tristan und Isolde* of the Stereo era, and a *Ring* cycle that must figure at or near the top of a very short list--all conducted by Karl B&ouml;hm (one of the most formidable, and dramatically compelling, Wagnerians on record). These B&ouml;hm-led performances feature the likes of Brigit Nilsson (as Isolde and Brunhilde) and Wolfgang Windgassen (as Tristan and Siegfried), alongside other top Wagnerian singers of their generation.  Those five operas would have constituted a plausible bargain box on their own (and indeed the B&ouml;hm Ring cycle has fairly recently been selling for about the same price as this entire collection); but we also are treated to three wonderful performances (*Der Fliegende Holl&auml;nder*, *Lohengrin* and *Tannh&auml;user*) under Wolfgang Sawallisch, another seasoned Wagnerian who can usually be counted on (as here) to provide a vivid theatrical experience.  All three of these performances are exceptionally well cast (a difficult matter in these particular works), though some listeners might be put off by certain vagaries of live recording (odd balances, audible prompters, lots of stage noises, less than spot-on choral ensemble, etc.); these minor irritations are more noticeable in the three Sawallisch outings than in some of the other performances anthologized here. Least satisfying (to these ears anyway) are Varviso's *Meistersinger* (inconsistently cast, with less than engaging portrayals of Sachs and Walther) and Levine's *Parsifal* (too slow, and minus a musically and dramatically plausible singer in the title role); yet even in these two cases, where one could cite several superior alternatives, you will probably not be disappointed--for there is something about a live occasion at Bayreuth that stirs the blood, even when the conducting or singing prove uneven.<br /><br />Perhaps the best news about this set, apart from the price, is that the recordings all date from the Stereo era, and provide a splendid sense of space and occasion, if not always ideal clarity of focus.  The documentation is what one would expect for bargain boxes these days--scanty, though detailed cast lists and recording dates are provided along with a cued plot synopsis for each work.<br /><br />In sum, then, you cannot go wrong with this compilation, whether you are a neophyte or a veteran opera collector and Wagnerian:  the performances are memorable, the sonics variable but never less than good, and the cost minimal.  Strongly recommended.whether you are a neophyte or a veteran opera collector and Wagnerian:  the performances are memorable, the sonics variable but never less than good, and the cost minimal.  Strongly recommended.os)<br /><br />NOTE:  Since the last time I checked this entry, some Amazon sellers have begun to offer this bargain box at very reasonable prices.  As of this writing, you may now purchase the complete Wagner operas in the new Solti edition for between $100.00 and $125.00 from various online classical music purveyors.  This \\"Live from Bayreuth\\" Box, however, is currently being offered for up to twenty dollars less than the Solti box.  Either one is a steal at these prices, but I would recommend considering the Bayreuth Festival collection for the following reasons: (i) multiple conductors and productions ensure a variety of interpretive approaches; (ii) there is an extra measure of vivacity in live recordings over studio productions; (iii) Böhm's Ring Cycle and *Tristan* are, to my ears, superior as interpretations to Solti's recordings of these works.
1400030293|5.0|After I read that Kathryn Harrison said Gordon was her favorite love story, I was beyond intrigued. Reading about the abusive relationship between the narrator and Gordon is a little bit like being unable to pull yourself from watching a gruesome car wreck, but I would highly, highly recommend the novel to anyone who has a stomach for it. I've read this book a few times and have gotten multiple friends to read it, and none of them could put it down, either. Edith Templeton's dark and sexy book is a must-read!
0380713802|5.0|Last fall, as a 21 year-old college student in his final year, I started pondering what to do with that ludicrous accumulation of wealth that all university students find upon graduation.  Lies, actually: I scraped together the best I could and bought a ticket for London.  A pair of \\"Let's Go\\" guides accompanied me for practical reasons, but Neither Here Nor There was my travel bible, my Psalms, as it were.  I read it that Fall of '07 and it inspired me to take the trip in ways that no other source had.  It revealed to me that even travel hardships can result in the most absurdly funny, cherished stories.<br /><br />His ascerbic wit goes gangbusters on the little quirks of the Continental, from country to hilarious country.  I partially molded my trip to make sure I checked out some of his destinations--they were that well-described.<br /><br />Interestingly enough, I found him to be dead-on in some countries/cities, and WAY off the mark in others.  One of his most memorable anecdotes comes out of backwoods Austria.  I happened to find the same people to be the kindest, most hospitable of my whole 14-country trip.  But the laughs I had over that chapter, and the inspiration to camp out under the Tyrolean night sky, paid dividends.  So what if his descriptions aren't cookie-cutter and unfailing?  No two travel experiences are the same, and God forbid they ever will be.<br /><br />Read this book.  You'll shoot (insert beverage here) through your nose laughing and develop an ache to see Europe.  Prost, Bill.
B00005JPO1|3.0|Don't get me wrong, I love Indiana Jones and Harrison Ford.  I like this movie but I don't love it.  Sean Connery was 53 the last time he played Bond and Roger Moore was 57.  They both looked too old for the part.  Ford is 65.  The last guy to punch out bad guys at a similar age was John Wayne.  There are some nice touches : bring back Karen Allen, acknowledging the passing of Denholm Elliot.  Rosewell?  Crystal Skulls? Worth having as part of an overall Indy collection.  It's better than the three turds Lucas calls his chapters I-III of STAR WARS saga.
B001BKXUOQ|5.0|ok first off to those who think this album should sound like mate feed kill   repeat or slipknot realize this if it did you would have spent 20 bucks on a album you already bought almost 10 years ago. i have been a maggot since theyre self titled album which i thought was great i bought m.f.k.r. it was ok (lil rough around the edges)i got iowa it sucked, i almost didnt get vol  3 because of it but i did get it it was ok it had some good songs on it now for my review of a.h.i.g. great album nuff said. slipknot has matured in not trying to be over the top gimmicky and really put together the greatest album of theyre career yes it has some stone sour in it but so what stone sour is a great band too. ok simply put if you've grown up since the first cd so have they and it shows the songs are crafted beautifully.
1416914293|5.0|I'm not sure what every one's problem is.  I thought the book was great, with a lot of action and suspense.

They are not brother and sister!  The novel is chock full of hints...Jace does not look anything like Clary, her mother, or Valentine.  Valentine tells Clary his blood travels through her, but tells Jace he has the blood of angels.  The fae queen tells them she knows a secret about them, then tells Jace to ask his father about his parentage.  The Inquisitor looses her son and his wife (who is seven months pregnant)yet their bodies are missing.  Hmmm...I wonder what happened to that unborn child?  Gee, I don't know?  Perhaps if I wasn't a moron I could figure it out.

0385337388|5.0|I first read this when it had just come out. I had been living in Canada and had just returned to the States and to the American Medical Business.     I was shocked, distressed, disgusted at what I read. Yet, as I knew many first year residents in hospitals at the same time I read this book, I knew how true it was.    I was thoroughly disgusted with the field that exploited its med students (and especially its residents and young physicians, at the great life-and-often-death expense of patients, just so hospitals and attending physicians can enrich themselves.    No wonder the author became a psychiatrist after writing this book.    Sad to say, much of what went on then still stands.    However, some limits on the number of hours residents can work have been placed, due to obvious patient safety.    Much as I love certain things about this country, out-of-control capitalism is not one of them.     And the medical business, like all other industries in this countries, is a prime example of out-of-control capitalism.     Great reading. And a must for patients. Patients should be as informed as possible about the medical industry and its doctors: what they do, what they don't do, what they can and cannot do, what they know and tell us they know.    I always empathize with residents who are over-worked and over-tired, and wonder how many of them survive those years.
B001DDBCUU|5.0|I am soooo excited for the release of this movie on DVD!! But, I am torn as to which one to buy. I usually like the full screen editions of movies, so I was thinking of pre-ordering that one from amazon.com. However, the special edition has other things (of course), although I think it's wide screen. So I was just wondering what people on here usually do. Which one would you buy, or have already you bought? Thanks! :)
B000AADYUI|5.0|I've been a fan for years of both Jefferson Airplane and Jefferson Starship (not so much once Kantner left and the band's name was changed to simply Starship).    Kantner was the angry, driving, creative force behind the band, especially in this CD.  Oh, to be sure Grace Slick's voice comes through like a ringing bell, especially on Let's Go Together, Hijack, and Have You Seen the Stars Tonight?      But it's Kantner's constant acoustic guitar and rebellious attitude towards the establishment in his writing that shines through in this one.    This CD, for historians, marks the change from the Airplane to the Starship, and all the songs are heading towards the concept of a bunch of Flower Children hijacking a starship and flying us all to a new world.      \\"Our children wander naked through the cities of the universe.  C'mon, free music, free dope, free people.  The day is on it's way.  The world is ours.\\"    Although Dragonfly is a competitor for artistic greatness, this is the CD that I would want with me if I had to go through another hurricane on psychelics (one of my most endearing memories).

B00104W8T6|4.0|I love these natural, ordinary, rambling, breathless, profound songs. Some of them really surprize you with their depth. Others just make you smile.
1582701709|1.0|I was hoping this book would totally WOW me since I have read great reviews about it. Most of the things you will find here are things you already know, things you could read anywhere (an inspirational quote in a bookmark).  I'm glad I didn't spend a lot on this book.  I was bored and uninspired.
1591841984|4.0|My Mother-in-law was given a ipod a while back ago.  She is not computer literate so she gave me the ipod to download some sermons and music on it.  But I have started using it for myself (I will ask for forgiveness later).  Apple seems to be on the cutting edge of technology and style.  I love the new iphones, but cannot afford one.  It seems that apple represents cool and hip these days.  This book gives an inside look into the inner workings of Apple.  Jobs seems to have multiple issues and control problems, but there is little doubt that he can be creative and run a company.  In fact, Apple was dying before he came back on board.  When he did, he turned the company around and started making a ton of money again.  The reason I read this book was to learn about the image of a company or product.  To me, the image of the church is important.  One of the major agendas that I have in Waynesboro is to create a positive image of the church in the community.  I would love to hear people's thoughts on this concept.  The book did not really help with image control, it was more for those who love Apple.  But overall it was a interesting book for people wanting to dig deeper into the Apple world.
B0019FOC5E|2.0|Original ABBA and the musical recording (Broadway) are both far superior to this corny remake.  Don't waste your money.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|Okay, I will be short and to the point. This is a different CD than the previous ones. The songs, \\"Given Up\\" and \\"Bleed it Out\\" are reminiscent of Linkin Park's traditional style.  There is much less Mike Shinoda presence (unfortunately). However, all hope is not lost. The songs \\"Leave Out All The Rest\\" and \\"Shadow of The Day\\" are a little \\"emo\\" some might say, but they are very well written and full of a lot of meaning. The song \\"Hands Held High\\" is VERY excellent Mike Shinoda creation. To the listener it is obviously a giant political message - and very well done at that. It's vague, yet at the same time everyone knows what is being discussed/attacked. The rest of the songs are also good, but I'd say they aren't as strong as the rest. Overall I'd rate this album a solid 4. But I'm giving it a 5 because fans have been too hard on the band. It's worth buying if you're into Linkin Park.
B001BGTWXI|5.0|I was taken a back when I first heard this album well the first half anyway. It does not sound like Slipknot at first. The guitars seemed to be tuned different so you don't get alot of the deranged heavy drone Slipknot is known for. Instead you get a straightfoward heavy hitting full bodied guitar sound, which is great but it was very off putting at first. I can understand the Stone Sour comparisons for the majority of the song chorus parts contain clean melodic vocal parts similar to Wait and Bleed, Left Behind, and Danger Keep Away, Circles etc. Which is not bad either actually it is quite a tasty mix it just once again does not sound like trademark Slipknot. As I began to listen more closely over and over and let the entire album play I was very pleased and you will be too if you take the time to open up and enjoy what it is that's there and that is quality, hard hitting, unrelentless, and very very good music! I know people say \\"whats the point in repeated listens in order to enjoy music, I know whats good the moment I hear it, and this ain't good\\" Well that's a weak and terrible way to judge music. Any good art takes a discriminating eye and an ability to enjoy from all angles, in order to spill variety into the mind and enjoy every bit and piece of the said art. Music that is simple and pleasing and requires no thought is called \\"Pop music\\" and fades from your mind very fast. This album is in my head to stay and I agree what Corey said about this album That the world is not ready for it and it will rip your face off! Well here I stand faceless and in total of awe of the demolition crew nine known as Slipknot!!!!    Great Tracks:  2. Gematria (the killing name)  3. Sulfur  4. Psychosocial  5. Dead Memories  6. Vendetta  7. butchers hook  8. Gehenna  12.All Hope is Gone
B000002H2H|5.0|I don't know exactly where this album would rank on some kind of official list or a huge vote for the top 10 Heavy Metal albums, but on my website I ranked this timeless masterpiece 3rd behind Reign In Blood. I did have a really hard time deciding if it should be 2nd or 3rd though. Anyway, enough about that, here is my review.    FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE - This is easily one of the greatest album openers in heavy metal history and i love how Hetfield sings the song and the lyrics are great. The solo is very solid but nothing too amazing. My favorite part is probally the end of the song where they make it sound like a nuclear bomb is falling and then exploding, you can hear a rumbling sound at the very end like an explosion. A perfect ending to a song that is about nuclear war  RIDE THE LIGHTNING - This is the perfect song to follow after Fight Fire With Fire. A song about a man being put to death by electric chair, it's easily one of Metallica's best songs and the guitar solos in the middle of the song are amazing!  FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS - This song is perfect. It has a dark and creepy sound to it and i love the sound of the bell at the beginning and end of the song. I kinda wish this song was maybe a minute longer but like I said, I still think it's perfect.  FADE TO BLACK - This is the best and most famous song on this album and for good reason. The first part of the song is slow and sad but beautiful at the same time, then the song builds up to about a 3 minute instrumental part with one of Kirk Hammett's best solos. This song is about a man who is depressed and eventually commits suicide. I would rank this song as Metallica's 3rd greatest song ever.  TRAPPED UNDER ICE - Once again another great Metallica song. Trapped Under Ice is up there with Metallica's best speed metal songs. It has 3 super fast and crazy guitar solos and the lyrics are about someone being trapped under ice in water drowning. Yea I know, another song about death.  ESCAPE - Finally a song thatis more uplifting to give you a break from all of the lyrics about death. I truly think that is why this song is on this album. It has a great chorus that i like to sing along too and even though it may be the weakest song on the album, it sure as hell isn't a weak song!  CREEPING DEATH - This song is normally a personal favorite of Metallica fans and it's one of my favorite songs as well. It has a great guitar solo, some awesome riffs and lyrics.....well what you usually get in an 80's Metallica song.  THE CALL OF KTULU - I'm not real sure what instrumental song from Metallica is better but I do know that it would probally come down to either this song or Orion from Master of Puppets. I'm sure it's hard to make a 9 minute instrumental song without it being boring in some parts but Metallica managed to make all 9 minutes enjoyable and sometimes downright great! My favorite part in the song is the big guitar solo somewhere in the middle of the song. an epic 9 minute instrumental song is a perfect way to end this masterpiece of an album.    Ride the Lightning and Master of Puppets is what Heavy Metal is all about and the main theme for Ride the Lightning is death which I think is a great theme for a heavy metal album. If you love thrash metal and somehow don't own this album yet or if you just got into listening to thrash metal then make Ride the Lightning one of the first 5 albums that you get!
B000001EXB|2.0|The Big Picture for me was as a step down from the achievements of the previous release, Made In England. The main problem is the over production by Chris Thomas who gives these songs a dense, wall of sound production that drains the melodies dry. The songs themselves however are not that bad. In fact, it's a shame that several didn't escape to surface on a future album. Opening with Long Way From Hapiness, it's a fitting opener in lieu of Elton's recent personal tragedies, the death of Princess Diana and his good friend, Gianni Versace - though the album was recorded prior to those events in the summer of 1997.    Taupin returns for another round of lyrics that are his least ambitious in recent memory. Partly based on a loose concept of writing big old time ballads that the likes of Sinatra would sing, the album never quites hits it mark. Most are too simplistic and lack his unique narrative to tell what amounts to basic love stories. Love's Got A Lot To Answer For is perhaps the best example of this: \\"love's got a lot to answer for, I just can't sleep with this feeling anymore\\".     Others like, Something About The Way You Look Tonight, which appears to be a grand attempt at a classic ballad, only succeeds due to Elton's powerful delivery. The melody and lyric however are routine at best.    And that's the problem with the rest. Live Like Horses is a powerful ballad about the death of Taupin's father but is mired by an over use of synthesizers and unnecessary effects (if you ever heard this solo, it's a great song). Meanwhile, The End Will Come and I Can't Steer My Heart Clear of You simply don't go anywhere. Most of these songs are slow to mid-tempo with the only real upbeat song being the closer Wicked Dreams. That one, while probably the most interesting lyric, simply never excels into what could have been a great rock song. It's just simmers, never boils.    But all is not lost here. If The River Can Bend is a wonderful gospel rave-up with a fantastic piano solo. January has a melody that changes and shifts dramatically along side one of Taupin's most romantic lyrics. The title track also has some nice moments, including a wonderful opening of just Elton and piano.    As you can see, I struggle with Elton's albums where I'm torn. I just can't outright not like it because there are some great songs here and Elton sings with great passion throughout.     My biggest complaint is the production. It would make a great bookend to The One, another over produced album. But this was five years since The One and Chris Thomas brought nothing new to the table for Elton and these songs. Elton and Thomas had disagreements during the recording according to a recent biography by David Buckley and Taupin complained that the album sounded cold and too technical.      The Big Picture falls squarely in the middle of pack of Elton's albums. And for me, that's frustrating.    Best Tracks: Live Like Horses, If The River Can Bend, January, The Big Picture and Something About The Way You Look Tonight.
0395645662|4.0|The Giver presents the reader to a dystopian  society that has forayed the people's right to CHOICE in an odious fashion; but nonetheless, it can at times be furtively appealing in an hypnotic way. To analyze this society initially it is quite inscrutable to identify how a people could so ardently support such an articulated \\"guidance.\\" While this book is merely fiction, it indeed sheds light on an ideology that either is intrinsically intelligent, or it is quite eloquently repugnant to the nebulous of human desire, freedom to endeavor.  Being a Constitutionalist I prefer the latter rather than the former. To have one's perspective sculpted and wrought by a fashion of governmental control by means of familial degradation and division from a biological existence, sexual drive altered by compulsory pharmaceuticals, intricate scheduling of one's day, standards and virtues that are ubiquitous, one all encompassing day of \\"birth\\", population control, genetic manipulation, and procuring children and spouses by application and approval only, is quite destitute of any CHOICE. Is this inane? Is this madness? Or, if freedom was not known in the context that of which is lain before us in the U.S. Constitution-which both Republicrats and Demopublicans are obscuring-would this dystopia be so divisive? The society in this book is something one could indeed marvel by pretext to the actual context due to the lack of tyrannical behavior. We must not be disillusioned. We must not allow the propagators' evidence and statistical datum to dissuade us from having the penchant to pursue freedom as a virtue over security. For such a society in essence, no matter success, does indeed revoke the core and foundations of an inalienable right that our predecessors have fought eons for-FREEDOM! Articulating political structure  is arduous and elicits much dissension along the way; however, do not let that make one despondent or draw forth consternation or political apathy. For if political structure, by and for the people, becomes a derelict, then for our children FREEDOM will be merely a vestige. Or, perhaps a more formidable coin, an antiquated myth.<br /><br /> Lowry has definitely deserved to be upon the list of writer's that has hit a symphonic political note. While not as fecundated as George Orwell's (Eric Blair) writing, she has a latent exhortation for us, or at least for me.

1603420398|5.0|This has to be one of the best book covers ever! Not only is this a beautifully produced book, the motifs are presented wonderfully in unexpected colors. I love the contemporary feel of the whole production and especially appreciate the easy to read charts. This is truly a dream book for any freeform fiber artist like me who will find pages of inspiration for years to come. Definitely add this reference to your library!
0596522347|5.0|Nancy Duarte is managing Duarte Design, a company that has created some high-profile presentations (Al Gore is one of the clients). They (her husband is the company's CFO) started out in the 80s when the Apple Macintosh brought desk top publishing and graphics design to the masses, and have now become one of the big brands in professional presentation design.<br /><br />This is the perfect book for those who have mastered the PowerPoint (or Apple Keynote) technical skills and need to make the final jump to master concepts usually taught in art schools (rather than software manuals):<br />- Picking pleasing color schemes<br />- Slide composition<br />- Typography<br />- Etc.<br /><br />The trained eye can extract almost everything there is to know about presentation design. However, this is not the book that will teach you magic that will turn your beginner-level PowerPoint edits into a professional presentation.<br /><br />Many subjects discussed in this books are covered in other material as well (minimal bullet points, cut words, use professional images, etc. etc.) However, there are some very specific things that I picked up in this book that were new to me:<br /><br />- Thinking about cinematic movement for animations or slide composition<br />- Creating one big map and using the PowerPoint push transition to navigate it: one presentation - one big slide<br />- A large library of chart concept sketches, there were many new ones I did not use before<br />- Stressing to adopt a \\"designer\\" mentality to presentations<br /><br />Things that I found less useful/interesting (personal preference):<br />- (Many) direct references to the services Duarte Design can offer<br />- Case examples (many of which are the same as on Duarte's site) are not always useful<br />- The section on data charts was relatively weak<br /><br />But overall, a warm recommendation to purchase this book. It is well written, nicely illustrated and brings all the presentation design essentials together in one place, including many references to further reading and almost all the big presentation \\"brands\\" in the industry.presentation \\"brands\\" in the industry.

0307265730|4.0|Jhumpa Lahiri has done it again.  What a beautiful collection of stories.  Some previous reviewers have been critical of her material, but I continue to find her characters interesting both in their very human situations and in their cultural diversity.  The fist thing you are taught in a writing class is to \\"write about what you know.\\"  Lahiri does this with amazing style and insight.  While her characters may be, for the most part, Bengali, the situations they are in are universal.  As in her previous works, you can get a sense of Lahiri's own past, and that is wonderful.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Jillian has done it again.  This is by far the best workout video I have.  I really get a great workout and feel like I am accomplishing something.  I got this to help shed the baby weight from my pregnancy and it has worked.  It is not boring and I look forward to the workout.
0141439513|5.0|I recently finished reading Pride and Prejudice for the sixth time and can honestly say it was better than it ever has been before.  The first reading, in high school, was a little rough.  Since then, this book has grown on me each time (silly to say, since it is my FAVORITE book and the only one I have re-read as often).  The humor is fantastic, the characters are both wonderful and suited so well to the time period, and Mr. Darcy is a classic \\"leading man\\".  Who doesn't want to find the modern day version of Mr. Darcy?
0930289234|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed the book, can't wait for the movie to come out.  It isn't your traditional super hero story which threw me off a bit when I started, but by the end I couldn't put it down.  I found the characters somewhat difficult to sympathize with in some parts, however there are those that really are appealing.  Definitely check it out if you plan on seeing the movie.
B00140PK6O|5.0|We loved it! This movie is long, but compares very well to a Jane Austen film. It has a few graphic scenes of medical emergencies, but otherwise is very family-friendly. Very sweet!
1401207510|1.0|Yes, the other reviewers say all that is to say about this major disapointment. Aside the absolute absence of anything that could justify the major price, there are changes from the cheaper edition to this one, like the minor \\"Sexjane\\" insert that is now inserted before \\"Faerie's Fortune Founded\\" instead of between the pages of \\"The crazy wide forever\\". In a piece of work like this one that's a change that alters everything.  I think that DC owes my money back, and I'll ask for it.

B0018LMZOE|5.0|EVERY GOOD BOY DESERVES FAVOUR, yet another great CD by the Moody Blues, is now even better, thanks to warm, thick remastering and two bonus cuts. The rocker \\"The Story In Your Eyes\\" is now clearer and more interesting, whereas \\"You Can Never Go Home\\" now inspires me even more to put looking good for pretty actresses as a higher priority than attending Thanksgiving Dinner at my old school for my 15th graduation anniversary, because the lyrics are easier to understand and the instrumentation carries them along even better than on the 1997 remastered version. This is one reissue you definitely should NOT pass up.
B001CD6FKS|1.0|Warner Bros would like you to think you are getting a great DVD set of SPEED RACER, all you get is the movie on a 25GB disc with NO that is RIGHT NO HD Lossless Audio TRACK! All you get is standard DD 5.1 track... how old right esp for an eye and ear candy film. Even the recent release of the classic Eastwood films from WB's (the Gauntlet, Every Which Way But) Loose Got LOSSLESS HD audio!    The second disc is a digital copy of the film which I feel digital copies are a waste myself. I could care less.     The Third disc is a sort of game based on the film and you can imagine how bad and useless this will be!     SO in short you are paying a lot for actually not even a Special Edition and you get not so great audio.

No one in America did. Hollywood got it wrong every damned time, whetting twisted political knives on the bones of our dead brothers.   So once, just this once: This is how it all began, what it was really like, what it meant to us, and what we meant to each other. It was no movie. When it was over the dead did not get up and dust themselves off and walk away. The wounded did not wash away the red and go on with life, unhurt. Those who were, miraculously, unscratched were by no means untouched. Not one of us left Vietnam the same young man he was when he arrived. This story, then is is our testament, ...\\"

B0015KO52S|5.0|The new Raconteurs album is incredible in its layered simplicity. This is Jack White's new band and the album breaks boundaries while still having a familiar feeling to it. The instrumentation mixes modern and traditional styles in a seamless album. I found the debut album \\"Broken Boy Soldiers\\" to be a bit weak, not bad, but not terribly memorable. Pick this album up immediately! You will not be disappointed.
1402208332|3.0|This is a worthwhile edition of \\"The Tempest\\"  in spite of its flaws, omissions, and limitations. The \\"Note from Series Editors\\" lays out clearly its unique features and gives some helpful hints on how to get the most out of them. The CD included provides at least two and sometimes three versions of ten passages taken from four productions, ranging from a 1962 recording with Donald Wolfit to a recent recording with Ian McKellan. The illustrations are numerous and include photographs taken from a score of modern productions, though a few of these are so small that it's impossible to see much detail.<br /><br />Though Derek Jacobi narrates the CD, his critically acclaimed Prospero is here represented only by a single photo in the book; he is never heard as Prospero. Richard Preiss, the text editor, in his introductory essay on the history of the play in the theatre, refers to John Gielgud as 'the greatest modern interpreter of the role', yet there is not even a single appearance of Sir John either audially or visually. And not one of the many songs in the play is on the CD.<br /><br />The layout of the book is very attractive. The text of the play is on right-hand pages, the glosses, production notes, and illustrations on the left. Different typefaces are used for stage directions (italic), character names and speech headings (all caps), and speeches (plain); along with plenty of white space, this makes the text easy on the eye. Preiss explains in a note \\"About the Text\\" that all versions of this play are ultimately based on the version in the Shakespeare Folio (1623). I noticed several misprints and some omissions of a word or two, the most serious of which is the omission of two short speeches between what in this edition are lines 70 - 71 of Act Two, Scene One:<br /><br />GONZALO<br />This Tunis, sir, was Carthage.<br />[ADRIAN<br />Carthage?<br />GONZALO<br />I assure you, Carthage.]<br />ANTONIO<br />His word is more than the miraculous harp.<br /><br />Most of the commentary is clear and helpful, but at least one note on the words 'So, you're paid' in this scene is so completely muddled that it would take up too much space in this review to unmuddle it.<br /><br />There is also a gaff in the narration on the CD. Sir Derek is made to refer to the character of Ferdinand as 'the usurping Duke of Milan's son' - he's actually listed correctly in the Dramatis Personae as 'son to the King of Naples.'<br /><br />Preiss's essay on stage history is only one of several included to supplement the commentary on the play. There is an essay on the rehearsal of the play by inmates as part of the Shakespeare Behind Bars program, supplemented by excerpts from interviews with two of the inmates who played Prospero and Miranda on the CD. There is also a survey of the play's influence on the arts and popular culture. Some pretty obscure items are included here, like an opera by Havely, and some pretty dubious ones, like 'Gilligan's Island', while, perhaps inevitably, some more interesting or relevant items are not. Also included is a brief account of Shakespeare's life and times, and a discussion on 'Speaking Shakespeare.' On the CD is a recording of a voice coach working with an actor on a soliloquy from the play.<br /><br />But whatever it's shortcomings, this edition of 'The Tempest'  is informative and even entertaining and has much to offer to anyone interested in getting to know the play or getting to know it better.the words 'So, you're paid' in this scene is so completely muddled that it would take up too much space in this review to unmuddle it.

B000WTNCQS|4.0|While I've enjoyed every U2 album (there's even redemption in at least half of their \\"Pop\\" album from the 1990s), The Joshua Tree is what got me into the band originally and is what I consider their first masterpiece. Achtung, Baby and then How To Dismantle an Atomic Bomb eventually followed as triumphs, but this box set was a delightful gift to have received. Sure, I owned the Joshua Tree already, but after 20 years it's a bit worn out and the remastered versions are crisp and clear. The packaging is nice, although I don't need such a thick box just to hold a booklet and a couple of CDs/DVDs.<br /><br />The book that is included makes for a great companion to the CD and the DVD of the Joshua Tree Tour show from Paris is actually very high quality, along the same lines of other U2 concert releases on DVD. I was a bit surprised at that, although I'm curious as to why the concert didn't open with Where the Streets Have No Name, which eventually became a concert standard. The \\"Outside, it's America\\" documentary is nearly worthless. I think I remember seeing it air originally on MTV when The Joshua Tree started becoming huge but it's really not a value-add to my collection. It's basically an hour of watching them eat and wander around. The bonus music videos are nice to have, but it's not like I'd pop in a DVD just to watch a couple of music videos. Perhaps if they had gone the extra mile of including all of The Joshua Tree-related videos, there'd be just a bit more value.<br /><br />The bonus CD contains, as other posters have noted, a good number of songs that have already been made available on B-Sides compilations. \\"Beautiful Ghost/Introduction to Songs of Experience\\" is a spooky reading of some lyrics or poem and as such, can't really be considered a song. \\"Wave of Sorrow (Birdland)\\" is another new song that's pretty good for a B-Side song and has some familiar chord progressions reminiscent of U2 of that era.<br /><br />\\"Desert of our Love\\" isn't really a complete song as it includes quite a bit of \\"bonoglese\\" or whatever Bono's placeholder lyrics language is called. You'll hear him calling out instructions such as \\"one more verse\\" or \\"bass and drums\\" which actually only seems distracting on the first listen or two but the mind learns to ignore those and appreciate what seemed like a good song and a good way to hear how the band worked in the studio. \\"Rise Up\\" is probably the best of the new songs and seems to really thrive. I wouldn't mind U2 taking a chance on reviving this as part of a future tour. The last of the new songs is \\"Drunk Chicken/America\\" which was not even worth space on my iPod. Still, a handful of new songs, a quality DVD, and a pristine version of the original Joshua Tree album make this a valuable addition to any U2 addict's collection.song as it includes quite a bit of \\"bonoglese\\" or whatever Bono's placeholder lyrics language is called.

0440236738|5.0|This is my first book by this author, and I enjoyed it very much.  It's the story of Will Klein, a social worker in Manhattan whose life changed 11 years ago when his brother was accused of killing Will's ex-girlfriend.  The story begins when Will's mother, dying of cancer, tells him that his brother (who's been missing and presumed dead for those 11 years), is alive.  Shortly afterward, Will's soulmate disappears and is implicated in a double homicide in another state.<br /><br />The story is interesting and filled with lots of plot twists and fascinating characters.  If there was any fault it was in the too goody-goody narrative voice, but that naivete was important to the story, and I would happily read another book by this author.
0312427573|5.0|Great Book.  Very enjoyable.  The writing is probably better than the story.  There are sentences in this book which I think are probably the finest ever written.  An absolute treat.
0345495004|4.0|Interesting and well written, but it helps to remember that this is a work of fiction since some of the events stretch credulity.
B0017V7GTY|5.0|Alright, to start with the Gaslight Anthem isn't a punk band. They're on a punk label (more or less) and tour with punk bands, but don't think you're getting a straight up punk cd. This is a classic rock record that falls firmly in between some of the classic songs of Springsteen and Tom Petty. Bouncy, catchy rock tunes about teen loves and '50's culture. It's good. It's real good.

B0019MLVEM|4.0|The Script is a 3 man band from Ireland largely touted in the UK as the next big thing (their CD has topped the UK album charts). Two of its members, Danny O'Donoghue and Mark Sheehan used to be producers and worked with Teddy Riley, the Neptunes, Darkchild and Dallas Austin in the past. This R&B influence is readily apparent in their Pop/Rock sound which some have compared to Maroon 5.<br /><br />Opening cut \\"We cry\\" is a catchy acoustic song with Hip hop beats and soulful vocals from Danny and haunting harmonies. Similar is the lovely \\"If you see Kay\\". The more upbeat \\"Before the worst\\" is another extremely catchy tune with a spitfire vocal delivery in the verses, while the acoustic based \\"Breakeven\\" features yearning heartfelt vocals.<br /><br />Current single (and UK #2 hit) \\"The man who can't be moved\\" a chugging Coldplay-style midtempo song about heartbreak. Also channelling Chris Martin and the lads is the chiming \\"The end is where I begin\\" with nice tempo shifts. \\"Rusty halo\\" is a Police-style rocker, the acoustic ballad \\"I'm yours\\" is more stripped than the other songs, and closing is the atmospheric ballad \\"Anybody there\\".<br /><br />Catchy, well crafted and produced songs. The next big thing? I dunno about that, but it will be interesting to see where they will go next.
015206396X|5.0|Gold Star Award Winner!<br /><br />In most of the seven kingdoms, people born with a Grace--an extreme skill that they can perform above all others--are usually feared.<br /><br />However, King Randa of the Middluns kingdom has exploited Katsa's ability to kill ever since her Grace surfaced at the tender age of eight. Katsa had even begun to think that maybe, in reality, she really was nothing but an attack dog, until one day she decided to follow her own will and let an innocent man live. Since then, she and her cousin, Prince Raffin, have put together a secret council to rescue people suffering from similar injustices.<br /><br />During a rescue mission to free the father of the Lienid king from a dungeon in Sunder, Katsa squares off with a Graced Lienid man who is almost her equal in fighting. When he shows up in Middluns, Katsa is dismayed to learn that he is one of the Lienid princes, nicknamed \\"Po,\\" in search of his missing grandfather.<br /><br />Although Katsa is at first wary of his intentions, she soon finds a kindred spirit in Po, and the two grow close as they set off on a journey to solve the mystery surrounding the kidnapping of Po's grandfather. In Monsea, a kingdom isolated by mountains, Po's aunt and young cousin may be in grave danger...<br /><br />Akin to the tales of Tamora Pierce, this story features strong female characters and an exciting medieval world full of magic and action. Definitely not one to miss!<br /><br />Reviewed by:  Allison Fraclose

B000AYEL6U|5.0|Short story: This is an awesome period drama.  If you like Pride and Prejudice it is almost a certainty that you will love this movie.    Richard Armitrage as John Thornton is now first in my affections and Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy is 2nd.    It took me a little time to adjust to a couple of the accents.  Especially that of Mrs. Thornton.  There are one or two spots where clips of a scene are re-used.  But overall, this is one of the absolute best adaptations of a novel ever done.    And you should try Wives and Daughters too.
B00004T9UF|5.0|This anger filled album by Eminem still rings with raw emotion nearly a decade later.  Definitely not PC, but that's part of the dirty pleasure.      The album contains several that still (Stan and the Real Slim Shady to name two) live on in radio play.  The more aggressive lyrics (Kill You & Kim) continue their powerful punch.  Other songs (Amityville & Remember Me) lack the commercial staying power but are still worth listening to over and over again.    Just don't listen to this in front of your young kids or older parents.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|I was so happy a few years ago when the N started airing Daria...until I saw how they hacked up the episodes. Apparently it's okay for Degrassi to show teen sex and drug use, but it's not okay for a Daria character to say \\"hell\\" or \\"thank God\\".  (Yeah, that makes sense!)    Here's hoping that the guys at MTV finally get a clue and release Daria on DVD - uncut and with all (or most) of the music intact!
B001B93QSW|5.0|I had this ALBUM. It is still great to listen to, and Tommy Lee's drumming on this record is just SUPER great and energized. This is when they were all young and hungry for fame, so most of the songs are energy filled and obnoxiously great!
B0000E6XH3|4.0|When I first saw \\"One More Time,\\" on Cartoon Network, in 2001, I was so intrigued by the anime, that I couldn't stop watching it. I had to have the rest of the story and the music. This one has it all, great music, great story, but no words, or dialogue to the movie. Now I have to admit, some of the songs on this DVD, were just too good to stop watching, while the others were just didn't have any singing to the music, that was a major drag, but if your interested in DAFT Punk, and you like anime, then this one is for you.
B000062XGK|5.0|Every time i see this movie on television i watch it.  It doesnt matter at what part it is at or what time of day.  I have to watch it.  I think it is my favorite all time movie besides the Wizard of Oz.  In all the years since it has come out on DVD, for some reason, i never thought of ordering it.  Well, one night i am sitting in front of my tv and there is not a blasted thing to watch.  The Abyss came to mind and as i went to my DVD collection it wasnt there.  So, as always, when i really want something i went to my computer, Amazon, typed in The Abyss, and ordered it.  Now i can watch it anytime i want.  If you have never seen it,,,PLEASE DO,,,YOU WILL LOVE IT !!!!
B00008WT5J|4.0|Great CD!  With the tracks \\" Who made Who\\" and \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\" you are going to rock! It also has the rock anthem  \\"For Those About To Rock (We Salute You)\\". Great album and a great price. The Free shipping was great also.
B0001O3YEE|5.0|This is one of the many DVD's i wanted in my collection.  It was easy to find in Amazon ( as always ) at at my price ( also , as always ) .  Its why i always come back to Amazon for all my wants and needs.  This is one of the few DVDs that was missing that i had wanted for quite some time.  I finally just sat down at my computer, went to Amazon, typed in what i wanted,,,,and wha-la,,,there it was.  And its a FABULOUS  movie to boot !!
B0017R5UAA|5.0|I found this on iTunes while browsing My Morning Jacket albums and accidentally pressed \\"enter\\" (which played a song sample) instead of pressing \\"back.\\" Perhaps it's lame of me to admit, but tears welled up in my eyes because I was absolutely overcome. I'd never heard anything like it before, gorgeous, absolutely wonderful songwriting. I bought it immediately and cannot give it any less than five stars. I can NOT believe I'd never heard of them--it's a sin. Truly. Buy this album this minute and prepare to be enlightened like never before!
B00005OM4K|4.0|If you like Creedence Clearwater Revival music and don't have any (or very much) in your collection, then this is the set that has it all. Some of the early stuff before they were Creedence isn't all that good (mostly because it doesn't sound like them) but everything else they did is in this box set including live versions. Better than a greatest hits!
0385339682|5.0|This is a great book. I haven't read in years, so I was surprised when I was so into it. At times you feel like you are in Ford County, Mississippi with the characters, thinking you know what's coming next when the story takes a turn. It's a good book by Grisham.
B000FC12ZA|5.0|Is Mutant Message a true story? I don't know.  Is Marlo Morgan lying to the public? I don't know.    Did I enjoy this book?   Every single word, from start to finish.  It has been suggested that Mutant Message Down Under is nothing more than a rehashing of pop New Age philosophy with storyline points more in common with Native American culture than any Aboriginal truths.  Perhaps that is so. Again, I don't know.    What I do know, is that the message put forth is one of timeless truth and desperately needs to be heard... again and again, in our materialistic and compassionless world today.    Set aside your doubts as well as your need for quantifiable evidence and use your own inbuilt intuition to discern the veracity of this Timeless Message from antiquity.
B000YDOOU0|5.0|This is amongst Pat Metheny's finest releases to date. To begin with, this trio is amazing, and I would go as far as to say that it's my favorite Metheny trio.     Antonio Sanchez's drumming perfectly contemplates Metheny's fluid, beautiful, and deeply articulate post-bop phrasing with such artful cleverness. He plays quietly, hanging in the background to allow Metheny to have his say, while making perfect elaborations with heavy cymbal use, but also not being afraid to speak up when the time is right, and exploding into drumming reminiscent of hard-bop Art Blakey.     Bassist Christian McBride is solid and is the glue that holds this magnificent trio together. He stays low and constant underneath Metheny's speedy and precise phrasing, while also keeping perfect rhythm with Antonio's abstract and artful drumming. Also speaks up when the time is right, though those moments are a bit sparse on this album, given the nature of the music and overall pace of Metheny and Antonio together.     Metheny is at his finest in this album. Upon a first listen I was unable to get into the new tone that Metheny had adopted, being a die-hard fan of Bright Size Life, I was lost without the cutting and sharp treble tone of Bright Size Life. Nevertheless, I continued to listen and found this album to be just as good, if not better. Metheny's tone has evolved quite a bit over the years and it's perfect for what he's playing and whose he's playing with on this album. His phrasing has become beyond exceptional and the soft lyrical quality of his phrases have become incredibly sophisticated to a profound point of articulation that leaves the listener speechless.     Not to mention the deep passion and emotion that lurks and is revealed through this album is dynamic, gorgeous, and revelatory. Day trip will always be one of my favorite Jazz albums of all time. If you are ever considering buying this album then I would suggest that you stop even \\"considering\\" it, and just buy it and give it alisten. And listen a few times. There's so much depth buried in the passions of this album that you will discover and feel more and more each time you listen through it.

B000065BPB|5.0|Having searched for a set of headphones that would operate at quality levels, I continually encountered positive feedback about the Sennheiser HD280 Pro. I decided to purchase a set, and have found out the following:       They can handle a wide range of genres, even producing low bass and high treble with a great deal of clarity. They were designed as studio quality, and carry out that professional duty more than adequately.       The headphones are compact enough to store away neatly, but large enough to fit over your head just as neatly. The drawback might be the seal they produce around your ears, which will effectively cut off most of your ambient sounds. When listening to anything, the ambient sound almost vanishes. People talking, a radio playing, the tv on... Gone.       For their price, which is half of its original cost, I have the personal opinion that they outperform the pricier Bose. The Sennheiser HD280 Pro is not really remarkable in any one direction, and is instead a well-balanced product, appealing to a wide variety of tasks without sacrificing any of them. Where bass headphones mercilessly cut up the treble, these can produce both ends, and make anything sound rich, alive, and downright remarkable.
0571195709|5.0|Hardly qualifying for a novel at a mere 118 pages-- although it still may be too long-- INTIMACY is the account of the end of a relationship as seen through the eyes of Jay, who is about to leave his lover Susan of six years-- they are not married-- and their two sons. \\"It is the saddest night, for I am leaving and not coming back.\\" So begins Jay's ruminations of what has gone wrong and why he is leaving. There is precious little to like about him. Well educated and a successful writer-- he has been nominated for an Oscar although he never tells the reader exactly what he did to get the recognition-- he likes recreational drugs from time to time, currently has another lover Nina, who in his eyes, has provided assurance that he would stay as long with Susan as he has. She is not as pretty as she was when they first got together. If he should see her in a bar now, he opines that he would look at her two times but not three. He's a real prince of a fellow. As he is packing a few things to leave, he makes sure he has  a signed framed picture of John Lennon before he gets photographs of his children. And he does not have the courage to confront his lover but rather leaves her a note after she has gone off to work.  He does attempt, however, to be honest about himself, saying that \\"Perhaps, all this time she [Susan] has been making a heroic effort to get along with a morose, over-sensitive, self-absorbed fool.\\" And he obviously loves his sons dearly, hoping that as he changes the three-year-old's \\"nappy,\\" that his son in the future will return the favor. Jay is well aware that his deceased father would not approve of his leaving Susan and their children. Kureishi contrasts Jay with his friend Asif, who exhorts him to be responsible and says in tender, beautiful language: \\"'I can just about see why someone would leave their spouse, but I can't understand how someone could leave their children. To me just going to work feels like SOPHIE's CHOICE.'\\"<br /><br />When I finished this book-- that you will want to read in one sitting-- I wondered where this character will be in ten years, perhaps like the character in Kureishi's compellintg short story \\"Nightlight,\\" who after escaping from his wife and children in much the same way as Jay does, sees a woman every Wednesday for sex but does not know her name. On the other hand, he may be closer to the character of Jamal-- we can hope-- in Kureishi's latest novel SOMETHING TO TELL YOU who still believes in and keeps looking for love.  I suspected that many men will see themselves, at least in part, in Jay's character-- in the U. S. approximately one in three marriages ends in divorce I believe-- and finally was glad that my father never left my mother, my brother and me.<br /><br />You may not like this character but you will certainly  be much taken with Kureishi's honest depiction of him as well as the author's fine prose.ook-- that you will want to read in one sitting-- I wondered where this character will be in ten years, perhaps like the character in Kureishi's compellintg short story \\"Nightlight,\\" who after escaping from his wife and children in much the same way as Jay does, sees a woman every Wednesday for sex but does not know her name.

B0017MO10U|4.0|With Continuum being the last entry into the Stargate SG-1 story, they do a good job of tying up the one real remaining loose end, namely Ba'al.  He is up to his usual tricks of trying to take over the galaxy and the SG-1 team is again tasked with saving the day.  Like a lot of the episodes, SG-1 gets itself into a pretty deep pickle before finally coming through in the end, but it's a good story and certainly worth watching.  But, like all of the Star Trek movies that came out after the show's finale, this movie is just a longer version of an episode that might have aired on the SciFi network during the show's run.

B000G8NXYQ|5.0|\\"Amarcord\\"--\\"I Remember\\"--just may be my single favorite Fellini film.  I love it for three reasons.<br /><br />First, it's a warmly nostalgic look at the sometimes buffoonish, sometimes strange, but always lovable figures whom Fellini remembers from his childhood hometown.  I don't know how much in the film is a historically loyal depiction and how much is a cocktail of memory and imagination.  But it doesn't really matter how accurate Fellini's portraits are, because what he gives us is an ensemble of characters, from his youthful counterpart Titta, to Titta's hot-tempered father Aurelio, to his crazy \\"I want a woman!\\" uncle, to the over-aged Don Juans who still have adolscent libidos, to the unforgettable Gradisca and the hilarious town lawyer, who are charming and real.  The only other film I can think of that comes close to \\"Amarcord\\" in warm nostalgia is Woody Allen's \\"Radio Days.\\"<br /><br />Second, the film is genuinely funny, and sometimes absolutely, laugh-out-loud hilarious.  The buffoonish black shirts strutting through the dusty streets; the \\"do you touch yourself?\\" confession scene; the dinner scene in Titta's household; and the unforgettable scene in which Uncle Teo climbs high in a tree, throws stones, and screams for a woman.<br /><br />Third:  funny as the film is, it's also got a very definite edgy message.  Mussolini's blackshirts may've been clownish, but they could also be brutal.  The Church may be comical, but it also encourages sexual repression and prolonged adolescence.  The aristocracy may be quaint, but it's also decrepit and parasitical (in the opening spring rite scene of the film, the brief visit to the local count's palace is one of the best in the whole movie).<br /><br />The movie isn't without its troublesome spots.  The fantasy scenes that take place in the Grand Hotel seem out of place, and tend to rupture the smalltown ambience the rest of the film creates.  In addition, the illness of Miranda is announced too abruptly, with absolutely no preparation, and her death follows quickly.  But overall, \\"I Remember\\" is a film to remember.death follows quickly.  But overall, \\"I Remember\\" is a film to remember.
B000WCBPOG|1.0|This deluxe edition is not the original movie soundtrack, but \\"Music from the Original Motion Picture\\" and missing a few songs to boot. The original songs are so much full of passion as they were recorded during the acting. I was very disappointed in this CD.

B000AARKW6|5.0|We see Carlito's traumatic fate at the very beginning of the film, but how does one who so ambitiously wants to leave the former gangster life in the past and move on with himself still manage to end up here.  This is the tale, and what a story it is.  Al Pacino gives a memorable performance, and Sean Penn is right there behind him.  Carlito (Pacino) is released after 5 years for a 30 year sentence from the help of his lawyer and best friend (Penn).  Carlito has been given the opportunity to own a piece of a nightclub, where he can progressively earn enough money to get the amount he needs to get away to the Bahamas, once and for all, where there he can live out a simple dream and leave the past behind.  From the near get-go, the kind heart of Carlito can't say no to his young cousin when he is asked to stay by his side during a deal.  The deal goes wrong and Carlito is already finding himself back in old times, but refuses to keep his dreams from not succeeding.  One after another, old pals re-apear, but it's the story behind the Sean Penn character that gets things really going, and when Carlito is reunited with his old flame (Penelope Ann Miller) the story becomes intense, suspensful, engaging and never ever lets up.  For the first hour, the movie is at its slowest (though never boring) and then shoots into high gear then on out.  Thankfully, the fire never loses its fuel, as this is one of those films that happily gets better and better until a very exciting, very suspenseful chase scene climax.  Just when you think the height of the excitement and story has been reached, there's still more on it's way.  Carlito's Way is a fantastic film that is sad in a sense, but states a sad truth.  More-so, this is just fantastic entertainment pulled off by a superb performance from Pacino, and a great director Brian de Palma (Scarface).<br /><br />Acting - 5<br />Action/Suspense - 5<br />Characters - 5<br />Story - 5<br />Overall - 5
630542845X|5.0|I can't believe that everyone who sees this movie isn't moved to tears for any number of reasons.  It is imaginative and different in all ways.  It shows the cruel side of mankind not only in the hunting of animals for sport, but bullies in the school who are just afraid of anything and anyone who is different.  It also shows the vulnerability of each person for different reasons throughout.  The character of Powder is so full, yet powerfully quiet.  He harnassed energy and humanity in abundance.<br /><br />I was disturbed by reviews that this movie points towards homosexuality...I dont believe that was the intent at all.  In the poignant scene where Powder is staring at another boy in the locker room, it's quite obvious it's NOT in a sexual way but in comparison.  He was seeing what it truly was that HE was not.  He could not have any body hair, yet this other boy had long hair and body hair that HE did not.  This other boy was tanned and \\"healthy\\" looking, one more thing he could not have...pigment.<br /><br />I've seen this movie a number of times and never fail to be moved to tears each time.  It makes you laugh and cry and is true entertainment.

B000MQ54OY|1.0|I absolutely hated this movie because of blatant environmental message.  I actually agree with the message they're trying to give, but they've done it completely wrong.  I felt like they tricked me into watching it.  The movie was advertised as a fun kids movie. Read the description, watch the trailer, and you'll expect a normal, fun movie. There's no hint that the entire movie is about how humans are destroying the environment.  If I wanted to see that I'd watch a documentary.     It seems people do love they animation.

B000V86OKG|3.0|The first season of \\"Dexter\\" blew me away -- it was just so odd and difficult and implausible, engrossing and delicious, clever and suspenseful. Michael C. Hall, in particular, gave such a bravura performance that we could even forgive dead spots in casting such as actress Jennifer Carpenter (who plays Dexter's sister, Debra, and who I find singularly unappealing...)    Anyway, Season Two was a major letdown, and while I had to see how it all came out, it was bit of a chore to watch all the way through. Having created a brilliant premise, and met with great critical acclaim, the show's producers seem to have been at a loss for how to keep all the plates spinning in the air, and this season had a slight shark-jumping feel to it.  More importantly, week after week, the writing felt uneven, picking up momentum and losing it again without establishing a consistent rhythm -- if we the audience were a fish that was being reeled in, these folks kept giving us too much slack.  Also, what is it with the lame female actresses on this show? Brit export Jaime Murray did the impossible: she was even more annoying and less appealing than Jennifer Carpenter!  Wow.  And, jeez, I hate to say it because I think he's a great actor, but it almost felt like Michael Hall was coasting on this one... The brilliant actor-within-an-actor-within-an-actor kachina doll performance of Season One gave way to an almost one-note characterization this time around.     This is certainly worth checking out, but all in all, it was quite surprising to see how abruptly the tone of the show shifted from one season to the next: hopefully Season Three will get things back on track.

B000WGWQG8|4.0|Although it took me almost a month to slog through HBO's series on John Adams, I persevered and found it to be a rewarding, enlightening and fascinating series. It is successful in showing the difficulties, grimness, and reality of life in 18th century America. I confess to initially thinking that Paul Giamatti as John Adams was not quite right for the role but he improved as the series progressed (into episodes 3 & 4). The series was directed by British director, Tom Hooper, and features a number of British actors: Stephen Dillane (Jefferson); Tom Wilkinson (Franklin) and Rufus Sewell (Hamilton). Personally, I found Stephen Dillane quite compelling and enigmatic as Jefferson. Dillane has always been magnificently expressive with his eyes and evokes stillness and grace while Giamatti brings more of a blustering, awkward physicality to his role: ultimately, both actors complement each other. Unlike others, I thought David Morse (usually a favorite) was merely adequate as Washington. Laura Linney as Abigail Adams has an engaging delicacy and conviction about her; unfortunately, she hardly seems to age throughout the series. Sarah Polley's performance as Abigail's daughter is deeply moving and reflective of the hardships and restrictions that women suffered during this century.  My first complaint about the early episodes of the series regards the jerky camera movements; I became nauseous and irritable by the 3rd episode. However, there are outstanding moments in every episode. Also the series musical score is disappointing and unoriginal especially as it borrows 2 pieces of well-known classical works from the film \\"Barry Lyndon.\\" Nevertheless, HBO's John Adams is outstanding in every other category, including costume and production design, and art direction. The series concludes with many poignant scenes. The scenes depicting the renewed correspondence between the aging Adams and Jefferson who died on the same day (July 4th) within hours of each other, could have evolved into another series.  Some of the correspondence between John and Abigail Adams is incorporated into the series which is appropriate and touching since the couple was often separated during the first decade-plus of their marriage. And one of the benefits of this John Adams series is that it will lead the audience into further exploration into early American history. I first heard excerpts of the correspondence between Adams and Jefferson on one of the American Experience Presidential series documentaries on either Adams or Jefferson. They were narrated by David McCullough who did such a fine job on the Harry Truman documentary of the same series. I also recommend reading \\"My Dearest Friend: Letters of Abigail and John Adams\\" and \\"The Adams-Jefferson Letters: The Complete Correspondence Between Thomas Jefferson and Abigail and John Adams.\\" It also might be worthwhile to view the The Adams Chronicles (1976) with George Grizzard.

0380730405|5.0|There are almost five hundred reviews on this book, so I have almost nothing to add except the following.<br /><br />This book is a romance/mystery written in a different time. The original publication date is 1937 or so. I have seen a lot of disappointment about the speed of the book, the main character, how the book paints women, etc. To those people, you need to understand that we haven't always been a society of people needing a \\"quick fix\\" or who even want to be spoon-fed, and books do not stay around as long as Rebecca because they are shallow. I rather suspect, having read Jamaica Inn, that Du Maurier intended for the heroine to be exactly as \\"mousy\\" as she is and that she intended there to be many questions left unanswered. The book is wonderful because even once a reader puts it down, he/she can sit and discuss it with others. Does Maxim really love the narrator or does he just want her to keep quiet? Was Rebecca the witch she was painted as or are we just getting a portrait of her third hand through the narrator (who got a lot of her material from Maxim)? Who really wins in the end? Rebecca? Maxim? And is justice really done?<br /><br />As you can see, the possibilities for discussion are endless, and that is exactly what makes this book so remarkable.

185984054X|3.0|I really didn't need to read this book to figure out that Mother Teresa was just another globalist tool and a propaganda/fundraising cash cow for the Catholic church but Missionary Position does a good job of driving that point home and giving good solid evidence to that fact. To give a few examples, the millions she took from the mega swindler Keating and never returned, her response to the Dupont chemical spill in India instead of seeking justice and calling to make Dupont acountable was telling people to \\"just forgive\\" so as not to cause any problems with the globalist corporats. Then of course there were the notoriously deplorable conditions in her hospitals and shelters, totally filthy, where they not only reused needles but their idea of sterilizing them was washing them with cold water! Also people were not given proper pain medication (Mother Teresa had this idea that the more you suffered the closer you were to Christ!) So you had things like this going on but at the same time it was found out in just the bank account for her shelters in the New York area there was $50 million dollars sitting idly. When the city of San Francisco donated a fully furnished shelter to her for a shelter for homeless men who had AIDS she promptly had all the couchs, beds and televisions thrown out insuring that the dying would live as comfortless as possible. All I can say is thankfully this cash cow for the forces of evil in this world is dead!

B00127RAJY|5.0|This workout video is amazing.  I bought it at Modells because I could not wait to try it.  I started the workout the day I bought it.  Did Level 1 for 2 weeks and am now at level 2 for two weeks.  I have not lost 20 lbs but I have lost inches.  I went down about 1 1/2 sizes from a tight fitting size 10 to a comfortable size 8 so far and it has only been 29 days.  I lost about 5 lbs...I think.  Probably would have lost more if I was strict with my diet.  Have done the 20 minute workout routine everyday.  My goal is to get down to a size 6.  I feel the difference.  I am definetely more toned.  The 20 minutes (25 minutes with warm up and cool down) works for me since I am working mom of 2 little ones.  I squeeze in the workout no matter what b/c it is only 25 minutes total.  No excuses!  Highly recommend this workout!!!  Love it!!!!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I deleted my original review since I initially bought this DVD a few years back, but did not keep up with it for more than a few days.  Now I have a true incentive to use it.  Please read below:<br /><br />***UPDATED 3/7/12***<br /><br />I have gained 8 lbs in the past two years, and am sick of feeling flabby and gross.  8 lbs may not sound like much, but when you're only 5 feet tall, TRUST ME when I say it can feel like 15-20 lbs on a person who is of average height or tall.<br /><br />Now, I want to start by saying that I believe my weight gain has been largely caused by taking different SSRI's over the past year (antidepressants - Celexa and Zoloft).  Unfortunately, many people gain weight while taking these meds and even more disconcerting is the fact that people say it's basically impossible to take that weight off while still taking the med.  In my case, I have found this to be true.  I have tried diets such as eating very low carb or meticulously counting calories, and my exercise consisted of running on the treadmill as well as doing pilates and/or yoga dvds. All of these things would have, in the past before I was taking meds, immediately given me a 4-5 lb loss, no problem.  However, currently no amount of change in my diet or exercise has made any difference in my weight, inches or tone.  Bottom line, I am feeling super bummed out and helpless.<br /><br />I've decided to commit to the 30 Day Shred as my last resort.  I bought it a few years back, but didn't use it regularly, as I was more or less satisfied with my body at that time, and had no real incentive.  I am worried because I feel like I will be INCREDIBLY disappointed if even THIS doesn't work, in terms of changing my body!  But I am committed to trying it.  I am on Day 4, and I do feel stronger but have not noticed any change in how my clothes feel.  I realize it's still very early on, so I'm not letting it get me down.  I will update this review as I go along.<br /><br />For those folks out there who have gained weight due to SSRI's (or other medications) and can't seem to lose the weight no matter what, I hear ya.  I hope that by tracking my progress in this review that it will bring hope to those who are in a similar situation and feel powerless to control their body weight and tone.  Hopefully I will have positive news to report, haha!  I'll be updating every few sessions.<br /><br />I took my measurements & weight on Day 1, and I won't be checking in on my progress with either of those until Day 30.  The main reason for this is that I don't want to become discouraged if I don't see the numbers I'm hoping for.<br /><br />DAY 4: On Level 1. No noticeable change in how my clothes fit.  However, I do feel stronger and feel that I have more endurance to do the workout.<br /><br />DAY 7: On Level 1.  Although there is still no difference in how my pants fit, my thighs definitely feel tighter and my butt feels more lifted.  I do notice a difference in my abs, for sure - they're less poochy.  Unfortunately, since I have IBS-C, I am always bloated / distended to some degree, and have gotten used to looking anywhere between 3 and 8 months pregnant at any given time depending on what's going on with my body (funny & sad, but true!).  Anyway, I've noticed that there does not appear to be as much flab on my stomach, and the muscles are tighter and are holding in the bloating better :)  The initial soreness from this workout has faded, and I'm excited every morning to get out of bed and do it.<br /><br />DAY 10: Began Level 2. Teensy bit of difference in how my pants fit - almost negligible, 1/4\\" maybe?  Still feeling like I'm getting stronger and building endurance. I don't like the exercises in Level 2 as much as Level 1, and so it might be harder for me to get through this phase.  It still had me drenched in sweat, of course.<br /><br />DAY 15: On Level 2. Same teensy bit of difference in how my clothes fit - slightly looser.  I had high hopes that I would have gone down 2 pants sizes by now (haha), but no such luck.  I am continuing to get stronger, and can especially feel the firmness in my abs.  I'm thinking it will probably take me more than 30 days to see results, given my whole situation with being on meds.  But, I'm trying to remain positive - after all, I am building muscle and getting rid of fat - even if it's verrrry slowly - so that can't be a bad thing.ne down 2 pants sizes by now (haha), but no such luck.

The story is not new and not really interesting. I read it but wouldn't call it a page turner by any means. James has an attitude and is not likeable, he is pretty young so I guess you can excuse that behaivor so people say. The other characters are more of the same, and the book is just repetitive all the way through. It should have been called 101 ways to be a jack*** in rehab or something like that. I 'm glad I borrowed this from the library.
B000009RC2|5.0|Inner Mounting Flame absolutely is my favorite all time album ....this changed my understanding of music and what great music really is! John's playing is superb and I believe never been equaled. Buy this CD and  \\"Birds of Fire\\" as well as the Live \\"Between Nothingness And Eternity \\" you will be forever changed by the quality and originality of this band....    I also personally prefer Johns guitar playing on these 3 albums as well as the amazing solo album done just prior to Inner Mounting Flame that being the album \\"Devotion \\" buy it and savor Johns distorted screaming playing that will provide a perfect appetizer for \\" IMF\\",BOF,BNE \\" johns guitar on these recordings is raw and cutting it is wicked and hard hitting not like the Muzak fusion that is popular these days....john was hitting the strings with a fury that equals any rock player going.    Enjoy this fine band and see what you have been missing!    I wish to add I was privileged enough to see the Mahavishnu live in 1971 in N.J. The band was a revelation John playing his black Les Paul at the time and using a huge set of Marshall amplifiers as was Goodman and the rest of the band.Live they were note for note in duplicating the recorded sound with a twist...the music was more intense and Johns tone was amazing!  Inner Mounting Flame buy it now!
B00140PK6O|4.0|&#34;Cranford,&#34;a recently-made, typically lush British Broadcasting Company comic costume drama, is based on the classic works of Mrs.Elizabeth Gaskell, a celebrated British Victorian-era novelist.  The Emmy-nominated production, in five episodes, uses Gaskell's &#34;Cranford,&#34;with added material from two of her short stories, one about Lady Ludlow, and one about young Dr. Harrison. It is set in 1842-3 in a small rural Cheshire town, based by the author on the real town of Knutsford.  The gorgeous location filming was done in Hertfordshire; with Ashridge Park, Little Godesden, modeling for Lady Ludlow's estate, Hanbury. It boasts a large cast of top-rank British actors, and more stars than there are in Heaven, as Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer used to like to boast.<br /><br />The story, clearly aimed at the demographic of an older female audience, who love Public Broadcasting Systems &#34;Masterpiece Theatre,&#34; and the filmed work of Merchant/Ivory -- just like me, of course, as charged --centers on the women of Cranford, most of them no longer young, robbed of any chance at marriage by the Napoleonic wars.  They face unprecedented change, as outsiders start moving into their lovely village, and the railroad approaches. They are also forced to live lives limited by their finances and their social positions in the patriarchal society of the time.  Most prominent among them are the acclaimed stage actress Eileen Atkins( [[ASIN:B0001MDP3G Cold Mountain]]), as Deborah Jenkyns, local social arbiter, and the Oscar-winning Dame Judi Dench ( &#34;M&#34; in the new James Bond movies;[[ASIN:B0009S2SOY As Time Goes By - Complete Original Series]]) as her younger warmer sister, Miss Matty.  Imelda Staunton,([[ASIN:B0007P0YKY Vera Drake]])as Miss Pole; Julia MacKenzie ([[ASIN:B001UWOLQG Agatha Christie's Marple: Series 4]]), as Mrs. Forrester; and Barbara Flynn ([[ASIN:B001JXPC4Q Cracker: The Complete Collection]]), as Miss Jamieson, do strong, funny work as their satellites.  Francesca Annis,([[ASIN:B000XUF6AG Lillie]]) still beautiful, gives us an admirable Lady Ludlow.  We also get distinguished performances from several more women: Lisa Dillon as Mary Smith; Rosy Byrne as Lizzie Hutton; Kimberley Nixon as Sophy Hutton; Julia Sawalha ([[ASIN:B000UNYPGM Absolutely Fabulous - Absolutely Everything]]); as Jessie Brown, and Emma Fielding, as Miss Galindo, who seems to utter a lot of thoughts, on the subject of women's difficult lives,  that may well have been the author's. As the Tomkinson sisters, Selina Griffiths and Deborah Findlay provide sweet comic relief.<br /><br />There are also men in Cranford of course, and some very heavy-weight male actors playing them, though their parts are generally lighter than the women's.  Chief among them must be the acclaimed Michael Gambon ([[ASIN:B00007HGIJ The Singing Detective]]),as Mr. Holbrook, a former suitor of Miss Matty's.  Martin Shaw ([[ASIN:B000AOEMV4 P.D. James: Death in Holy Orders/The Murder Room]]), shows up briefly as Peter Jenkyns, brother to the Jenkyns women.  Jim Carter is a sturdy Captain Brown.  Simon Woods is handsome, and  light of touch, as young Dr. Harrison, who comes to town bearing new medical techniques, and somehow gets himself into trouble with the local womenfolk. Philip Glenister as Mr. Carter appears in every episode and may have the strongest, most dramatic individual scenes in the production.  And playing right with him, to the hilt, as young Harry Gregson, a poacher's son, is young Alex Etel, who shone so brightly as the little boy in Neil Jordan's film &#34;Millions.&#34;<br /><br />The Cheshire locals, of course, will have their own strong country accent, with which Americans will not be comfortable.  And, while looking elsewhere on the Internet, I found a comment about this production: &#34;If you don't know what they're saying, turn on the subtitles.&#34;  So here comes the subtitle report: if only we could.  It is fiddly work indeed trying to turn on those subtitles, and we failed at it in this house.  Can't the BBC do better for this blue-ribbon production?in this house.

0812975219|5.0|Every once in a while, someone really intelligent focuses his thoughts on the most valuable skill a human can have--how to think.  Nassim Taleb has done an admirable job at just that: not telling us what to think--but showing us how to think in ways we can apply to innumerable life situations. I'm talking about what Charlie Munger refers to as \\"multiple mental models.\\"     The most important ideas explored are those of Popper--the idea of the open society--one in which no theory is known with certainty--only with probability, and theories continually replace one another as more information comes in.  Interestingly Taleb continually cites Soros as a famous investor who utilized Popper's ideas, but Warren Buffett, the ultimate realist, if queried, would no doubt acknowledge Popper in influencing his thinking. In contrast to Soros and Buffett would be Bill Miller, an intensely philosophic investor, who recently has classified himself as an optimist--but not a realist.  In any case, the methods of thinking propounded by Taleb fit nicely into what Charlie Munger classifies as \\"mental models\\"--doubtlessly useful stuff for the introspective, philosophical investor.
B001E75QGG|5.0|The movie was great, it did great in the box office, it brought Indy back for the new generations. The story did what it had to do to A. Appeal to a new generation B. Still give old fans what they desired    There's lots of gripe by some die-hard fans about \\"A.\\" they like to complain about what Indy had to do to appeal to new fans.. but that's to be expected from older set in their ways, stubborn, fogies. Even then it's still hard to understand why it went unliked by some old fans...    Considering what we've seen from the first 3 Indy movies the 4th installment isn't at all a stretch of the imagination..       Obviously this is just a movie review and not a Blu-Ray review... so to add some connection to Blu-Ray in this review.. all i can say is I hope this Blu will be excellent and considering the track record of Paramount i'm sure it will be.   The stunning visuals really require a High-Definition source for our home viewing and this Blu-Ray will more than likely be a fine treat.

You can always release it again when 3-D becomes popular.
B000784WMW|5.0|It was like reading a good book, well in this case, it was like reading Jane Eyre by Bronte. With a good book, I couldn't put it down.. with a good tv adaptation, I couldn't stop the dvd.     Timothy Dalton may not be the Rochester I was imagining from the book, but he surprised me. He fit the character. Dalton is my favorite Rochester. As for Zelah, she was fantastic as Jane. No one could have picked a better Jane.    I gave this 5 stars for the overall content of the DVD, the only complaint about the DVD is there are no subtitles.
B00005TPKD|5.0|Updated review- July 8, 2010<br /><br />WOW!  I totally didn't get Phallus Dei when I first heard it a couple years ago.  Apparently I somehow completely missed all the amazing psychedelic instrumental sections cleverly (and secretly) put in all the right spots.  Okay, maybe not ALL the right spots, but most of them.<br /><br />The title song is amazing for a variety of reasons.  The 4-minutes atmospheric build-up in the beginning not only reminds me of late 60's Pink Floyd with odd howling female vocals reminding me of the psychedelic years of Gong, but it actually really works. It does a splendid job leading into the bass/electric guitar jam.<br /><br />When the guitar jam arrives, it's most fantastic for being incredibly pleasing to the ears.  Maybe a comparison to Jerry Garcia's guitar style is appropriate, or maybe not.  It's up to you to decide on that one.  Hey, I love the Grateful Dead, but most of the guitar playing goes by completely unnoticed to my ears.  Most of the guitar work taking place throughout the jam isn't necessarily melodic, but it *works*.  I can't exactly explain how it works and how I can enjoy it despite not being terribly melodic- it just does.  Then again you know what?  The more I play it, the more I can remember/enjoy it.<br /><br />Then the song takes a serious 180 degree turn and reminds me of some small town festival somewhere in the midwest with people cheering and having fun (such as in Kansas or Nebraska) with the brilliant violin jam that dominates a majority of the second half (about 10 minutes worth of playtime, I totally kid you not!).  If you remove the violin, this aspect of the song would seriously remind me of Chicago's \\"Beginnings\\".  Often the violin isn't the main attraction and is pushed in the background, but it's there, believe me!  It's there in all its amazing glory.  The violin alone (or is it a fiddle?  Who knows!) shifts through all kinds of tempo changes and just takes flat out bizarre directions, but since I love that darn instrument so much, I can't help but believe the entire jam is just mind-boggling terrific.<br /><br />But why WHY does the song have to end when it does?  It's obviously building to something as the guitar grows intense and the vocals soar in a heavenly kind of way and then... then... the song ENDS!  Nooooo!!!!!!<br /><br />Some people may think the psychedelic movement is all about the sounds and weirdness factor, and that you're not really supposed to care about the majority of actual notes taking place, but an album like Phallus Dei proves such a theory wrong.  There *is* quality and memorable instrumental chops scattered all over the 20-minute title song.  It just takes time and patience to begin to hear some of them.<br /><br />I can actually see why I didn't get this album at first- this is like extremely challenging psychedelic music (if such a thing is possible!)  \\"Dem Guten, Schonen, Wahren\\" has some circus-like vocals momentarily before shifting into a more melody part.  One thing I've noticed about Phallus Dei is that it presents a military marching approach in much of it, and the instrumental parts of this piece are no exception.  I believe I detect a mellotron in the background but I could be wrong about that.<br /><br />I'm not quite sure what to think about a song like \\"Luzifer's Ghilom\\".  The distinct German vocals are somewhat of a distraction and take away from the music taking place in the background, but hey!  This could very well be another example of a song that has yet to really dazzle me.  One day I might totally fall in love with it, who knows?  Anyway, the guitar playing is quite heavy.  That's about all I can really hear besides the occasional slabs of bass and heavy emphasis on those German vocals.<br /><br />Update March 17, 2014 (Happy Saint Patrick's Day!).  I was WRONG about \\"Luzifer's Ghilom\\"!  I'm so crazy sometimes.  How could I NOT detect all the cool guitar and violin tricks the first time around?  Well I honestlydo still feel the vocals are a bit too weird to really understand (then again they're sung in German and I'm American- obviously I won't be able to make out what's being said) but the electric guitar intro is *awesome* and I seriously mean it when I say the rest of the guitar parts are equally terrific.  There's many tempo changes that sound really cool.  This song is probably slightly forgettable in the vocal department though, but *just* the vocals!<br /><br />\\"Kanaan\\" is an outrageous way to kick off an album!  Loud, upfront, psychedelic-influenced, makes me envision standing before someone of great importance at the pearly gates... and well, just a perfect walk in the park for yours truly!  It eventually drifts into a groove rocker somewhat, and accurately captures the feeling of dreaming (and daydreaming!) if I do say so.  That is one really special guitar jam at the end of this brief song.  The Moody Blues-like soaring vocals are awesome too!  \\"Henriette Krotenschwanz\\" features military drum beats and predicts a certain female operatic tune that would BLOW ME AWAY from the bands next album, Yeti.  This song however, is only 2 minutes long.  However it provides a nice taste of what would come soon enough!<br /><br />I really underestimated this album.  It's fantastic.  Just expect a challenging album.

B00005JPO1|1.0|Why is George Lucas intent on ruining the two franchises (Star Wars and Indy) that brought him to prominence and established him as a household name?  This movie started going downhill from the very first scene with the ridiculously generated prairie dog.  It sets the tone for the whole movie: Scenes that are completely over the top and are done in such a lazy fashion that the contemporary \\"Mummy\\" movies look like high art in comparison.  Over the top is fine as long as it is done with a certain flair and injecting humor (exhibit A: grossout dinner scene and rollercoaster traincart ride in ToD).  I hated the prairie dogs and the monkeys that Shia rallies to his \\"cause\\".  The George Lucas/Steve Spielberg of 20 years ago would've put forth a little more effort in making scenes like these believable both in terms of quality of special effects and within the context of the story.  They fail on both counts on these scenes and multiple others.    George Lucas has reached a point in his career where A)he doesn't have to try as hard to make a good movie (the studios will throw money at him regardless of the ideas he proposes) and B) is surrounded by people that idolize him and know better than to criticize his ideas.  Result: 3 star wars prequels and an indy film that don't even come close to the level of quality of anything he has been involved in prior to 1990.
0141182865|5.0|I've read this masterpiece many times since it was published and, each time, I laugh out loud as if I were reading it for the first time. The characters are sterling, the plotting flawless and the writing witty. From its first description of Ignatius waiting for his momma outside the D.H. Holmes store to its conclusion--every loose end tied into as thick a braid as Ms. Minkoff's hair--this book is a priceless treasure.
B000YJ54DU|4.0|Well worth the read, but then I'm a die hard Child\Reacher fan.  Kept my interest and had somw good twists and turns, but left me wanting just a bit more.
B00005O3VC|5.0|Listening to previous reviewers here on Amazon, I ordered only the \\"special edition\\" vs. the \\"foo foo\\" version that came with the book and other thing.    I'm glad I did.    The quality is fine, and it's so wonderful to be whisked away into Python-land once again!     I still remember the dialog word for word - my fellow \\"Rhebo's\\" from HCHS would be proud ... !    Python is silly and irreverent, which makes it such a nice aside from the \\"dumbness\\" of reality TV. Makes me want to keep it loaded in the DVD player so on a moment's notice I can escape the ridiculosity of now into the silly of then.    If you're thinking of getting it, just do it. You'll be glad you did when it's been discontinued and you DO have your copy ... !
0385484518|2.0|Several people in my family recommended this book and I managed to avoid it until yesterday because the one asking was a young person. How could I say no to a kid telling me to read a book she liked? What kind of ogre would I have to be to say no? It turns out I'm the kind of ogre that realized I could have lived without reading this. There's not much that's new here or that someone other than a rich, spoiled sports reporter wouldn't have known about the importance of family and the necessity to find your own path to the waterfall. My guess is that there are millions of people with the money to buy this book but without the most basic idea of how to be human. This book is just some basic, simplistic rules about how to be a good person. Nothing drastic or thought-provoking here. Again, I wanted to like it, but I can think of dozens of other books that have really touched me in many more ways than this one. Morrie Schwarz sounds like he was a nice man, but I think I would have gotten more out of one of his sociology classes or from spending an afternoon with him just talking than from reading Albom's book.
B000I2JKFG|5.0|V for Vendetta is one of the best movies I have ever seen.  When I first saw it I thought it was just ok but since then I have seen it atleast 10 times.

B0006L0LOS|5.0|I saw this movie on DVD because they never brought it to our cinema. I subsequently tried to purchase it on DVD but that order never arrived. I must have Patience's bad luck with this movie! Either way, I am determined to own it because it's a really fun movie and has a plausible storyline that actually makes sense to me, is thought-provoking and is not overdone or over-acted, contrary to what some reviewers say. I believe those reviewers probably watched a different movie - or are of the comic-book fan crowd who hated the movie before they even saw it.     All the actors delivered fine performances. I especially liked the tie-in with the history of cats, which lent credibility to the plot. One of my favorite scenes is actually not of Halle as catwoman but when Patience (revived) and Lone play basketball - it looked really cool.     I read what Halle said about the movie when accepting her Razzie - although I believe she didn't really mean it (besides what else could she say) especially since she later said she would consider doing a sequel. I say 'bring it on' WB!

B000002LFU|4.0|The 1990s music landscape saw Alternative Rock begin to basically become part of the mainstream music fold.   Alternative Rock actually had its roots in the 1980s.  Alternative Rock really ties itself to the \\"Indie Rock\\" (Independent Rock) movement.  It is a style of music that often covers a wide variety of genres, often working on independent record labels, but most importantly the artist maintains complete control of the music and their careers.   With 1980s Rock dominated by \\"Hit Radio\\" and mainstream music, much of the Alternative Rock movement was \\"underground\\" - heard in smaller venues and colleges.   A band that was at the forefront of this underground movement of music was R.E.M.  While many know R.E.M. is a pop-band from the 1990s, many also know R.E.M from the 1980s as one of the pioneers in Alternative Rock.  R.E.M. would achieve a groundswell of success from the underground movement.   In 1987, things would change when R.E.M would bring in producer Scott Litt.   On their \\"Document\\" album, R.E.M. would successfully crossover into the mainstream with their first Top 40 hit, \\"The One I Love\\".   This success would position R.E.M. to rise from the underground movement and become a force on the mainstream music scene.   Following \\"Document\\",  the band would switch from little-known I.R.S. records to Warner Brothers.   In 1988 - once again teaming with Litt, R.E.M's first album with Warner Brothers, \\"Green\\" would solidify their standing as a force on the mainstream.  At the same time, R.E.M. would remain true to their underground roots.    There are three changes I noticed in \\"Green\\" from previous albums.  First up, \\"Green\\" probably shows some of the most pop-friendly songs by R.E.M. since the group's inception.  In other words, these are songs that could easily be played on mainstream radio. While I always felt there was a place in mainstream radio for the I.R.S years of R.E.M., I can see how these songs are more receptive to R.E.M.   The second change is that this album definitely had a stronger political charge than previous albums.  This is perhaps because this was recorded during an election year.  Finally, this album would introduce the use of the mandolin - something that would be a trademark sound for the band as they progressed forward with their career.    Here is a song by song synopsis.    \\"Pop Song '89\\":  Two of the characteristics of this album are shown loud and clear.  The title of the song is indicative of the mainstream sound this song has - and of what this album has.  There are also political undertones with the line \\"Should we talk about the government?\\"    \\"Get Up\\": This song also has a nice mainstream feel to it.   In particular, there are some nice background vocals from the band that compliment lead vocalist Michael Stipe perfectly.    \\"You are the Everything\\": This is one of the songs that feature Mandolin by Peter Buck.  This song almost as a feel from the underground days of the album \\"Fables of the Reconstruction\\" - namely the feel of traveling across the Southern United States.    \\"Stand\\": This was probably one of the more popular songs from this album.  While it wasn't one of my favorites, I can't knock the song. Lines such as \\"Think about direction\\" to some extent carries a political undertone.    \\"World Leader Pretend\\": As the title indicates, there is a political message in this song.  However, there is so much to this song - this is a powerful song not just lyrically, but musically.  It represents a great cross between the underground sound and mainstream sound of R.E.M.   Stipe provides haunting vocals that really give this song an edge.    \\"The Wrong Child\\": This is a second song with the mandolin.  The mandolin adds to the haunting quality of this song that is reminiscent of the underground sound of R.E.M.    \\"Orange Crush\\": Awesome song.  This song probably falls more on the mainstream end thanks to the catchy melody and lyrics.  The title references \\"Agent Orange\\" from Vietnam thus having a political undertone.   However I feel it is the vocals again by Stipe and company that really are the strong point of this track.    \\"Turn You Inside Out\\": I would also say this song has a mainstream feel to it. Like \\"Orange Crush\\", it are the vocals by Stipe and company that really are the song's strong point.     \\"Hairshirt\\": This is the third song with the mandolin.   Once again the mandolin is used to create a haunting sound that is reminiscent of the underground days of R.E.M.    \\"I Remember California\\": This song is a tribute to the State of California.  The geographic aspects of this song also remind me of \\"Fables of the Reconstruction\\".  Bill Berry's drums help contribute to the haunting feel of this song.    'Untitled Hidden Track':  There is an eleventh track with no name on it, although there it is listed on the disc label (without a title).  This song has less of a haunting feel compared to the other tracks.    The liner notes on my particular version of this collection were thin and with the exception of \\"World Leader Pretend\\", the lyrics were not included..  This was slightly disappointing because I think R.E.M. music has some of the most interesting music and adding lyrics would have been a good thing.  Overall, this album shows the transition that R.E.M began to made from underground to mainstream band.   I credit producer Scott Litt for helping make this seem easy for the band.  I like how R.E.M. was able to work both sides of the line here.   This is an album that should keep both the core fans and new fans happy.  This album is highly recommended.
B00001OH7U|5.0|This is an incredibly six track album. I much prefer this type of album (six songs that are all winners) to newer albums that cram 14-18 tracks on a CD and only the first 3-4 really matter. You can truly turn this album on and not have the desire to skip a single track.    Put this album on, sit back, and enjoy. Station to Station takes a while to build, but when it rocks, it rocks. Next is my  favorite song of all time (no, not from this album, but of all time), Golden Years. How can you go wrong with finger snapping and whistling? Definitely a sing-along rock song.     My two other favorite tracks on the album are TVC-15, which you have probably heard on a Bowie Greatest Hits if you own one. When I heard this on my own greatest hits, I didn't expect it to come from this album, and admittedly it is a bit different (in my opinion), but still very rocking. Finally, Stay starts out with an amazing guitar riff, and lets the rock soak into you, and then builds into a great chorus.    On another note, I saw Bowie in concert a few years back, and he didn't sing \\"Golden Years\\" or \\"Young Americans.\\" I was really surprised that he didn't at least play \\"Golden Years.\\" Good concert, but I was very disappointed.
0671799320|5.0|This significant tome is Daniel Yergin's fascinating, 1992 Pulitzer prize-winning account of the personalities, politics, adventures and misadventures behind the evolution of the ruthless global oil business. This authoritative, intelligent and highly entertaining book reports on the past, present and future of the commodity that shapes the world power struggle. Yergin delves knowledgeably into fulcrum events. For example, shortly before World War I, Winston Churchill made the fateful decision to convert British navy's fuel from coal to Iranian oil. This decision set off the modern Western quest for Middle Eastern oil. The world is still feeling its wrenching impact, and Yergin shows how and why. getAbstract finds that this book provides an essential context for understanding today's international conflicts.
B000P12LWY|1.0|What a vacuous piece of crap! I wasn't expecting this to be 100% or even 90% accurate but this was incredibly far off the mark.  And the modern anachronisms and thoroughly BORING, vapid characters were really grating.  I couldn't even make it through one episode without wanting to fling the DVD out the window.  (But, alas, it was a rental so I had to return it in one piece.)  I've seen some of the actors in other movies and they've done wonderfully - their talents are wasted on this piece of excrement.  (I know - don't hold back...)
1400034205|1.0|See the film with Bill Murray instead [[ASIN:B000069HYF The Razor's Edge]]. This book is so pretentious and over-written I had to finally put it down after making it halfway through. In the book, for example, when Isabel visits Larry's room in Paris and asks him about all the reading he's been doing, he launches into a long and unbearable soliloquy about all the things he's learned from his reading; Murray simply says \\"I skim them.\\" What Maugham says with five pages, Bill Murray says with a sentence, a gesture or a facial expression.
B001BKXUOQ|4.0|I respect what a lot of you \\"hardcore maggots\\" are saying, but just realize that you don't speak for every Slipknot fan.  You may not be ready for Slipknot to evolve, but I really didn't want to hear \\"Slipknot\\" 4 times in a row.  I will admit, I did however think Volume 3 was overall pretty bad but I think this is definitely a step up from that.  Honestly, this isn't a bad listen.  This album is a roller coaster and has a heck of a build up to start off.  The closer of the album All Hope Is Gone(aka, the title track and the leaked track that hit before psychosocial) would probably be my favorite of the bunch.  It really has the visceral bite that many of the Slipknot songs of days past had.  Overall, I think the album flows together pretty well from track to track.  It's a quality album and I would definitely recommend it.    Now to address what I feel is a sad state of affairs involving not just Slipknot, but the genre of \\"metal\\" as a whole.  So many metal heads are just as bad as the teeny boppers that they continue to mock so easily.  Truth be told, they are just as narrow-minded as the teeny boppers.  Try out some other music every now and then.  Allow yourself to hear something else you dumb meathead jocks.  As a musician, I appreciate when a band branches out and tries something different.  Rock and metal are all about being heard and if they make an album that is more accessible, that doesn't make them weak, it means they are doing something that your dumb self didn't think of in the first place and they are branching out their sound so that they can in fact, be heard.      I also laugh when the narrow-minded metal fans get mad about bands not remaining \\"underground.\\"  Seriously, why would you not want everyone you know to hear about the good music you like?  If you are trying to introduce people into your music and saying you want said band to remain \\"underground\\" then you are pretty much a hypocrite.  Want them to remain \\"underground?\\"  Keep your mouth shutand don't go see the band live or buy any of their merch.  See how long your \\"underground\\" band will remain afloat.  Nuff said.
B000BKHL1K|5.0|This is a very nice, modern, wine rack.  Well made and easy to mount on the wall.  I took the advise of another review I came across and put up beefier drywall anchors.  Definitely recommend this product.  I came across another picture where 2 or 3 were put up along a large wall in a dining room - looked awesome.  Oh, and I have also received lots of compliments.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|My wife and I love this series, Its cool cause they also talk about how they got some of the shots and what kind of trials the crew went through.. Great series, all kinds of cool stuff you may not know about
B000O75F7C|5.0|Maybe it's a big statement to claim that Porcupine Tree are the new Dire Straits, but if that isn't the case, then hopefully some can agree that Steve Wilson et al bring many of the same catchy and intelligent songwriting skills to the mix as Knopfler and co. did back in their hayday.<br /><br />On first listen, this didn't stick with me the same way that 'In Absentia' did, but on subsequent spins, I was able to finally start listening to it as a different type of album, and I really enjoyed it.  Where 'In Absentia' succeeded in exploring a lot of different musical and thematic terrain, this album is very much a concentrated effort.  That isn't to say that it doesn't bring a lot of variety to the table, but there is a very clear concept.<br /><br />I feel like the time Wilson spent working with Opeth really paid off, and the heavier moments on this album and 'In Absentia' definitely help keep things lively.  Overall, this is a superb release and I think it will sit well with most prog fans.
0743455967|4.0|An easy read. Though I skimmed much of the 1st 1/2 which is mainly memoir and a bit dull at times. Though I thoroughly enjoyed reading about King's alcohol and drug problems.<br /><br />In the 2nd 1/2 King talks about writing and publishing. He explains how he works (he doesn't believe in days off) and how one might go about getting published. The actual writing advice itself is not new--leave out adverbs--don't say in 3 words what you can say with 1, etc.<br /><br />I think it's a great book for a beginning writer to start with.
B0017MO10U|5.0|The Movie's plot was not what I expected.  I bought the movie since I have seen every episode of every Stargate season.  I expected the movie to give closure to the series and give a sense that the characters will continue with a better life.  I never expected the twists that occurs in the movie where Bal has such a unique role in the movie.  I really enjoyed the movie.  I think that I would have seen the movie even if I did not watch and own all 10 seasons.  I recommend this movie for anyone who likes Science Fiction or just wants to see a good movie.
B001E7EONC|4.0|A pornographer and political radical have some lude pictures of Princess Maragaret and using them to blackmail the crown. They are held in a safe deposit box in a bank. The spooks use a beautiful woman with a criminal past to recruit some low-level thieves to break into the bank and rifle the safe-deposit box vault, only they can't know what the real objective is.<br /><br />This is not your typical adrenaline-fueled Jason Statham, car-chase pic. There is some action, lots of intrigue, and a bit of romance. It's a fun yet serious caper movie with several plot twists to keep you interested along the way.

0452289963|5.0|Eckhart Tolle's \\"A New Earth\\" is an earth moving book.  Even though the theme/message of this book is becoming very widespread, Tolle's writing style and clarity will give you another, better point of view.  If you are interested in changing your life in a significant way, this book is for you; it has definitely changed mine.
0385340567|1.0|What a terrible disappointment. I've read all the Jack Reacher novels and am so VERY glad I chose to borrow this last one, \\"Nothing To Lose\\", from the public library.    If the author wants to get political, enjoys criticism of his \\"host\\" nation, just go on back to jolly ?? old England....we don't need another parasite on our shores.    This book has radical political views supporting foreign nations & criticizes the U.S. It offends me, & I notice others feel the same.    To be fair, most of the Jack Reacher novels will keep a reader up nights until the book is finished. This book was difficult to keep reading, too much superfluous information, nothing much to want to continue reading.   Contrary to the title of this book, I believe Lee Child \\"lost\\" quite a bit this time; many of us see no reason to read his books again!
B00005JL3A|4.0|While the movie is loosley based on the resident evil games it still manages to stay true to its the games roots. just the simple things like the underground research facility, raccoon city, the arklay mountains and even the licker from the games will have the fans saying oh yeah i remember those. Im keepin this review short so for those of you who have no idea about the games, heres the pros and cons. pros: plenty of people getting killed here so this film will satisfy your barbaric needs, offers other neat sequences of action other than killing zombies, and the main monster is very well planned out. cons: the loud headbanging music really doesnt go with the resident evil genra, milla jovovichs red dress really is out of place here, the characters all have paper thin individuality. Its a good movie, just a few misteaks made but definatley worth watching.
B0019FOC5E|5.0|This was a fun movie with unexpected singing from some of my favorite actors/actresses.  Some parts were very hysterical. An absolutely joyful experience. In fact the music was so lively, I bought the soundtrack. FUN, FUN, FUN
0452289963|5.0|This book, at least at first, is not easy to get through.  It's dry, written in a kind of monotone (which is also how Tolle speaks), and a bit dense in terms of language.  But Tolle is, truly, an enlightened being, and for people who are open to what he has to say, his words ring true in very profound and helpful ways.    It's important to know that this isn't another \\"What Should I do with My Life\\" guidebook.  It's really about learning to live in the present moment and have your life's purpose come from within rather than from the expectations others have of us.  I have returned to it on many occasions to re-read and remind myself of how to live in the now.
B0002F6AZC|5.0|In a small town in Main, a young boy named Billy eagerly awaits for his copy of his favorite comic book \\"Creepshow\\". The Creep (Played by Tom Savini and voiced by Joe Silver) arrives with his truck as he magically gives him his comic and tells the viewer three ghastly stories. The first story \\"Chief Wooden'head\\" tells a modern supernatural western tale of revenge as two kind elderly store owners (George Kennedy and Dorothy Lamour) are offered a great deal by a rich Native American man which can promise them a good future, unfortunately three crooks murdered them as the store's wooden Indian comes to life for revenge. The second tale \\"The Raft\\" is about four horny college students looking for some sexual fun at a lake soon discovers that a mysterious man-eating oil-like goo terrorizes them on a lake of blood. Finally \\"The Hitchiker\\" deals with a a cheating rich wife (Lois Chiles) driving her way home from scoring with a gigolo accidently hits an innocent hitcher on the road and his spirit won't stay dead until he wants revenge.<br /><br />Exciting sequel to the excellent 1982 cult classic from George A. Romero and Stephen King only this time Romero is writer with three stories that were originally intended for the first movie but never made the final draft. \\"The Raft\\" is the most intense and creepiest of the stories since it's based on a Stephen King short story as it's a nifty one with the idea of being trapped on a raft in the middle of a lake with a hungry blob like on \\"The Blob (1958)\\" wanting to eat you. \\"Chief Wooden'Head\\" is good but predictable with it's not-too realistic wooden indian but the kills are good and \\"The Hitchiker\\" is the best story of them all including with that memorable line the hitcher says \\"Thanks For The Ride Lady\\". Sure some of the animated wraparound story parts are cheesy but this movie is a solid sequel to a true horror classic that is worth watching.<br /><br />This DVD contains excellent picture and sound quality wih cool extras like trailers, audio commentary, a featurette, Storyboard art, DVD-Rom: Original Screenplay, and Behind-The-Scenes Still Gallery.udio commentary, a featurette, Storyboard art, DVD-Rom: Original Screenplay, and Behind-The-Scenes Still Gallery.

B000MG1ZGA|4.0|This is not 1971 mixdown, which presumably was approved by ALL four members of the band and reflected their original intent.    Remixing, while making it more satisfactory to the ear accustomed to current trends, compromises it's value of what people liked and bought for the last 39 years. It would been a better thing to remaster the original recording and, if space permitted, add as many remixes that showed the alternate benefits of what it might sound like recorded today or reveal hidden aspects that may have been deliberately buried in the mix as part of the 1971 mix for the benefit of the curious.
6305633177|5.0|In the early '90s I had an umpteenth-generation dubbed VHS copy of this and a friend of mine and I watched it nearly every single day. The videotape squeaked and never wanted to rewind fully. The sound quality deteriorated until you could only tell what song they were playing by watching closeups of their hands on the guitars. We didn't care, and continued to watch it every day anyway, so good is this video.<br /><br />Now, after Load was released I think I actually went a full decade without listening to even one Metallica song, I was so disgruntled by it. I still haven't heard anything they've done after Load, but, you know, enough is enough. I've forgiven them, because there first few albums are still great. I still am depressed about the fact that, when ask people, \\"Do you remember when Metallica didn't suck?\\" people make me feel like a crusty old person. Many people do not remember. If they got this DVD, they could perhaps understand. Maybe it's the nostalgia value, but words cannot adequately convey my love of this compilation. It's mostly live clips but some humorous interview footage is also thrown in. (Interviewer asks how long the band has been together, James answers, \\"...since we started...\\")<br /><br />As implied by the name, this is obviously all stuff from when Cliff was still around. (R.I.P., Cliff.) In case you're clueless, he's that tall, puffy cloud of hair with the Misfits tattoo, and of course it collects a good amount of bass solos.<br /><br />Song choices are good and there is a clip of them covering \\"Am I Evil?\\" The video and sound quality varies, as some of this is bootleg video-sourced and other stuff was professionally-shot. But the fuzzy videos from the early days are still awesome due the amount of energy and the quality of the music, despite some quality problems and the fact that James doesn't sound great on some of the songs. Watching this, I can almost forget about Metallica's later stuff, and that is a good thing.
0670020745|5.0|Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor has put together an awesome book!  My Stoke of Insight: A Brain Scientists Personal Journey is extremely well written.  What are the odds that someone with such extraordinary knowledge of the brain and at the height of her career would have a stroke at the age of 37 and live to share such an amazing journey with us?  That, coupled with her talent as a writer is unique and extremely interesting.<br /><br />This book is written on a level that average people can comprehend.  Step-by-step the author describes how she felt, how others treated her, and what happened to her brain and abilities during her left brain deterioration beginning on December 10, 1996 and the 8 year healing process she endured.<br /><br />The author explains her nirvana like existence when her right brain was dominant while her left brain was healing.  Her ability to live in the moment and observe her thoughts in a detached manner to reach a peaceful state as a result of her connection to her right brain is described by many other authors as \\"Mindfulness Meditation.\\"  [See my other reviews if you are interested in reading other books on this technique.]<br /><br />Enthralled with the story, I could not put this book down.  I doubt that there is another book written by a person with firsthand expert knowledge of what it is like to have and recover from a stroke.  I am glad I read this book and recommend it to people who are interested in study of the brain or those who like biographical stories of people who not only survive, but grow out of the depths of catastrophe.
B0015UKX7Y|4.0|This sounds very different than the Arctic Monkeys (though the emotional tone is the same) with an understated symphonic pop sound.  I like it much better than the last AM release, though some of the songs aren't that great. Check out \\"My Mistakes Were Made For You\\" for a good example of how this CD sounds.
0790734850|5.0|All comments linking L.A. Confidential to film noir are absolutely valid. Nevertheless, I don't love this movie because of what it compares to - it's a milestone of cinema that stands on its own two feet.  There is no superfluous scene, no useless dialog that distracts from the plot, nothing showy to cover up deficits. There are no deficits. The acting, music, cinematography, and plotline are accompanied by an irony and tragedy that makes the characters feel like much more than figures crammed into a film noir mold. Just one example: the montage accompanying Hush-Hush magazine's coverage of L.A.'s crime and corruption illustrates the bitter parallel to the glossy snapshots of glamor we think of when we hear 'Hollywood'.  If you want an intelligent, complex crime story, and can handle the sight of blood, this film is for you!

B00009RAJJ|5.0|REVIEW: Coming after the unparalleled, worldwide success of \\"RUMOURS\\": the sonically twisted edginess of \\"TUSK\\" pushed Fleetwood Mac's musical sensibilities to the avant-garde limit. Guitarist Lindsey Buckingham was the prime mover behind the record's skewered, \\"splatter paint\\" of a production (the group even went so far as to build a new studio in order to accomodate his artistic vision), and the end result cost over a million dollars to make. And even though it was a more \\"modest\\" commercial triumph (\\"only\\" going double platinum!!!) in comparison to \\"RUMOURS\\": time, critics, and the public alike have been kind to \\"TUSK\\", and now it is rightly hailed as a true classic of itchy, modernist pop/rock. Many artists have released double albums at the height of their careers (The Beatles, Dylan, Hendrix, Stevie Wonder, etc.), but few groups have possessed THREE first-rate songwriters capable of sustaining the huge demands such a project warrants. With \\"TUSK\\": Buckingham, Christine McVie, and Stevie Nicks showcase their skills as never before. No matter if its the haunting love songs \\"Sara\\", \\"Storms\\", and \\"Never Make Me Cry\\"; the gentle, lulling opening notes of \\"Over & Over\\"; the wildly explosive rockers \\"The Ledge\\", \\"Think About Me\\", \\"What Makes You Think You're The One\\", and \\"I Know I'm Not Wrong\\"; the triumphant marching band venom of \\"Tusk\\"; or the sweetly percolating closer \\"Never Forget\\": you come away feeling that the Mac may very well be the greatest band in the world.      HIGHEST BILLBOARD ALBUM CHART POSITION: Number 4.    HIT SINGLE: \\"Tusk\\" (BILLBOARD: Number 8).  HIT SINGLE: \\"Sara\\" (BILLBOARD: Number 7).

1600610234|5.0|Doug Chiang's book, Mechanika, is a book I'll be recommending to both my College and private classes. In it, Mr. Chiang shows not only his eloquent mastery of logic-in-technique when creating a great variety of Sci-Fi imagery, but as well he shows us the basic step-by-step sequence to accomplishing the task. It's so well done! There is no doubt Doug Chiang possesses great expertise in creating visually stunning Science Fiction Art, and his credentials prove it, and now we the fortunate can see behind the scenes, you might say, into how Doug Chiang brings his visions to life. A must-have for any and everyone's library. I proudly have it in mine. I'm sure many of my student's, and students-to-be, will have it in theirs.
B000W7JWUA|2.0|I love this game. I had the old version but not the expansion so I got the new version with the expansion. To my disappointment, the quality on the new version is terrible. After a day of opening my game, I found that the cardboard pieces would bend, which made it more difficult to build the board. Not only did the individual hexes bend, but also the outside water pieces. Very annoying and very disappointed. I also feel that I can no longer play with it now.

0307455378|4.0|Having, like so many others, loved Ruiz Zafon's last best-seller [[ASIN:0143034901 The Shadow of the Wind]]/[[ASIN:0974872407 La Sombra Del Viento/ the Shadow of the Wind (Autores Espanoles E Iberoamericanos)]] I couldn't wait to get my hands on El Juego del Angel despite it not yet being available in English translation and my Spanish not being all that brilliant. I wasn't disappointed; El Juego del Angel is written in Ruiz Zafon's now familiar fluent, elegant style; his descriptions of 1920's Barcelona are as evocative as ever and El  Juego del Angel is, in any language, a page-turner! The author cleverly returns to some of the familiar themes and fantasies used in Shadow of The Wind without this ever feeling like a 'poor relation' or sequel - this story, with its gripping central theme of a young, talented but (fatally?) nihilistic writer whose life is variously shaped, steered, dictated and saved by a mysterious 'angel', is completely new and fresh while still having some comfortable similarities.    Highly, highly recommended!
061891868X|5.0|For those of us non-physicists looking into what has been going on in string theory for something close to three decades, things just look curiouser and curiouser.  No doubt the problem is that only physicists can comprehend the science itself.  Still it is enormously frustrating that not a single shred of experimental evidence has come to light supporting string theory.  What this suggests is that string theory, as beautiful as it may be, is art not science, or perhaps it is pure mathematics.<br /><br />Lee Smolin, who is a real physicist, has come to a similar conclusion in this insider's look at the sorry state of particle physics today.  Once the undisputed master of the sciences, physics has become--it is downright dreadful to acknowledge this--the butt of jokes from--are you ready for this?--the social sciences!  Even professors of literature are having their way with physics.  The inability of the string theorists, who have dominated particle physics lo these many years, to accomplish anything substantial, has so damaged the prestige of physics that something called postmodernism has been able to declare that all of science and mathematics constitutes merely an arbitrary \\"social construction\\" with no more claim to objective truth than utterances from a creationist's convention.<br /><br />Say it isn't so, Brian Greene.  Well Professor Greene has said it isn't so, but entrenched scientists tend to have entrenched ideas, just like global warming deniers, and so what we need are some hard facts derived from experiments or at least some predictions that can be identified and confirmed.  Alas, as Smolin is at pains to point out, we have more like the opposite.<br /><br />Take the reincarnation of Einstein's cosmological constant.  Not predicted by string theory.  Take the discovery of dark energy.  Not predicted by string theory.  Take the seven additional dimensions required by M-theory (an offshoot of string theory), and the old phobia about infinities in the equations seems rather mild.  No one has yet seen, tasted, smelled, felt or heard even a fifth dimension (putting aside the once popular band) let alone six others.  We cannot even imagine such a thing.<br /><br />Well, yes, the fact that we can't imagine them doesn't mean they don't exist.  However, one of the leading reasons that physicists like string theory's extra dimensions is that they do away with the infinities.  Talk about going from the frying pan into the fire, or from the deep blue sea to the devil!<br /><br />Philosophy was once the most prestigious academic discipline.  Could the same thing happen to physics?  And if so, why?<br /><br />Part of the problem is the great success and power that physics has enjoyed since the days when Newton stood on the shoulders of giants.  Even more so, since the days of James Clerk Maxwell, vast has become our knowledge of the physical world.  Indeed physics and physicists have constructed much of the modern world.  Their ideas and discoveries and understanding have led to enormous advances in technologies that have increased the standard of living of people, at least in the developed nations.  So much success has led to great expectations.  The sad fact for physics may be this: the next great discovery may be centuries away, or worse yet, beyond the reach of humans.<br /><br />Smolin certainly isn't so pessimistic.  The tone of \\"The Trouble with Physics\\" is that of a father urging his children to great accomplishments while warning them that they have been wayward.  He is blunt but bends over backwards to be fair.  The trouble with the book for non-physicists is that it is really impossible to follow the various arguments for and against string theory in any concrete detail.  The truth is in the equations, and Smolin doesn't give any, and rightly so since this is a book aimed at the educated general reader.  We educated general readers are left skimming the bewildering details of the history and current state of stringtheory to focus on the broad implications while being guided by Smolin's expert opinion.  But even in reading somebody like the aforementioned Brian Greene, who is a proponent of string theory, this reader at least was left with the sense of watching a wild goose chase from a distance.<br /><br />It isn't just in particle physics that physicists have gone over the deep end, so to speak.  Take cosmology where some physicists are postulating a large, possibly infinite number of universes in addition to the one in which we live.  As Smolin points out \\"The existence of a population of other universes is a hypothesis that cannot be confirmed by direct observation...\\"  He adds, \\"...the fact that we are in a biofriendly universe cannot be used as a confirmation of a theory that there is a vast population of universes.\\" (p. 163)<br /><br />Although there is nothing wrong with Smolin's writing style, and he does write with a minimum of jargon, some of this is impenetrable, at least for me.  Those more versed in physics will do better I'm sure.  However particle physics is per force about things we can't see and can't even visualize.<br /><br />Near the end of the book Smolin presents some alternatives to string theory.  As a non-physicist I have no ability to evaluate these approaches, which brings up an important point.  How can any non-physicist pass any kind of judgment on the validity of string theory?  We can't.  We can only count noses--physicists' noses.  When we do we find that most theoretical physicists believe in string theory despite the dearth of experimental support.  Why?  Perhaps because string theory is what they have been doing all their working lives, and string theory is what they have been taught and are teaching.<br /><br />My question is, have string theorists become a sacred priesthood?  Smolin doesn't use this term, but his book suggests as much.uided by Smolin's expert opinion.

B0017MO10U|5.0|I admit, I am an SGC fan.  I have watched the series since it began, including the original movie.  I love the concept (although some of the stories are a little weak on occasion).<br /><br />This movie has some great scenes, like the huge armada of ships hovering over Earth, ready to destroy us.  I always love time travel and time paradox stories, and this element of the story makes it especially interesting.<br /><br />So, if you like SciFi, and you like Stargate, you gotta buy this DVD!<br /><br />I hope they keep producing these DVD's - they have a forever customer with me (as long as the quality continues to hold up).
B0000CABBW|4.0|I have seen this movie once before, and it was nothing short of inspirational the second time around. The Whangara tribe's faith derives from Paikea, the first Whale Rider. Like many tribal religion, their tribe faces the threats of extinction when the Koro's son fails to give him a male heir to the tribe. Pai, his only daughter, not only faces being orphaned by her father (who left the tribe not being able to face his wife and son's death), but the rejection of her grandfather as the one who would carry on their tribe's legacy. When Pai's father returns, Koro hopes he would become the next chief, but he is gravely disappointed. Pai's father leaves the village once more, this time taking her with him. But, Pai returns. However, Koro continues to become more and more distant towards Pai, believing that she will never be able to fulfill the roles of a Chief in their tribe, even though his wife continues to tell him so. Koro becomes more stressed with the emergence of a beached whale, thinking that it is a sign for the worse. He and the other tribe's people struggle to save its life, but they are unable to. Pai's ability to lead the whale back to safety is finally tested, and with it she gains the title of the Whale Rider, as well as the respect and adoration of Koro.   The Whangara people focus on their ancestral values, animism, and they also embody earth-focused beliefs. This movie not only shows these beliefs in action, but also embodies the struggles that many tribal religions have to face in the world today; movement of their people into the outside world. People leave to find better lives and quickly become accustomed to the lifestyle, never to return to their homes. It also shows the struggle to survive and maintain tradition with the daily threats of the outside world. It is a great movie that enlightens the audience about the many problems faced by people today. However, it still remains deep rooted in the morality and ethics of faith and its existence.
B001EOQWF8|5.0|Again, Pixar reinvents it self and comes up with another hit. Who would have though a movie about a little robot, who does not speak (we don't hear human voices till well in to half the movie) would have worked, but it does. This is more of a love story then an action movie. It is about a the last trash robot on earth who falls in love with Eve, a probe robot who is sent out to look for organic life on other planets.<br /><br />I am looking forward to this on Bluray, it is going took and sound amazing. My first Bluray purchases were Cars and Ratatouille. They both look outstanding in HD.<br /><br />I highly recommend this to families and adults.
B001AJVR5M|5.0|The Jonas Brothers right now are following in the foot steps of other television and teen pop acts of the past such as David Cassidy (largely fueled by the exposure on the Patridge Family) and The Monkies (Success was largely due to their Television show).  The JoBros do not seemingly have a whole lot of substance but they are an entertainment juggernaut, filling up the media outlets with music, television shows, and soon a 3D film.  So, why would we think that they wont be another flash in the pan act like The Monkies or David Cassidy?  That is something you have to reconcile yourself.<br /><br />  Before I listened to \\"A Little Bit Longer\\" I had not heard the Jonas Brothers music besides \\"The Year Three Thousand\\" from their debut album \\"Its About Time\\".  Most people did not know who they were at that time in 2006, but I flagged them in my mind because they reminded me of one of my all time favorite bands Hanson (because they were three young boys who looked like brothers, and sang a fun pop/rock song, the similarities end there).  I had no desire to even further explore their music until I heard about their new album \\"A Little Bit Longer\\", mainly intrigued by the cover, I decided to purchase it, and yes, girls behind me at checkout were laughing at my purchase.<br /><br />  \\"A Little Bit Longer\\" being my introduction to the Jonas Brothers technically speaking, felt very contrived and suitable only for a pubescent 12yr girl.  I, however, on repeated listenings, found much to enjoy on \\"A Little Bit Longer\\".  It is very rare that you find a teen pop album that becomes more enjoyable on repeated listenings.  The common occurrence is that it sounds good for the first five listens, you forget it, and then when you go back to listen to it again, you forget why you enjoyed it so much in the first place.  Surprisingly, this is not the case with \\"A Little Bit Longer\\".  The music, while seemingly without substance upon the first few listens, actually grows in meaning once you dig beneath the surface.<br /><br />  A number of the songs while having a really juvenile theme like \\"BB Good\\", \\"Burning Up\\", \\"One Man Show\\", and \\"Got Me Going Crazy\\", (which for some reason reminds of me Fallout Boys \\"I Don't Care\\" which enough came out after this album), they are high energy and a lot of fun to listen to!  There are songs that show growth and hints at maturity such as \\"Lovebug\\", \\"Sorry\\", \\"Video Girl\\" and \\"A Little Bit Longer\\".  \\"Video Girl\\" unashamedly criticizes women who sell themselves for 15 minutes of fame, \\"Lovebug\\" although juvenile in theme, sounds very mature in its presentation and sounds a little bit more retrospective rather than an \\"OMG I LOVE YOU!!!\\"  song like most of their other songs.  \\"A  Little Bit Longer\\" although border lining self-pity, is a nice here a song that goes away from the \\"I love you theme\\" and veers off into self-examination, which hints that there really is more on Nick Jonas' mind then woman.  \\"Sorry\\"  deals with the theme of regrets and forgiveness, which at least is an attempt at growth.<br /><br />  While at first glance, Jonas Brothers are much like any other teeny bopper band that has come before them, there is something that sets them apart from the pack of wannabes, and that is sincerity.  They sincerely seem to enjoy what they are doing and really want to be honest and make honest music rather than just writing what people want them to.  I can definitely see them becoming serious musicians in the next ten years, but for now, there is no reason to not enjoy their youth and explore more complex issues as they come along.<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amyu dig beneath the surface.<br /><br />  A number of the songs while having a really juvenile theme like \\"BB Good\\", \\"Burning Up\\", \\"One Man Show\\", and \\"Got Me Going Crazy\\", (which for some reason reminds of me Fallout Boys \\"I Don't Care\\" which enough came out after this album), they are high energy and a lot of fun to listen to!

B0018RWMNM|5.0|I love the video, but the first DVD you sent did not work. It took talking to two different CS reps to get it straight, but eventually Amazon wound up doing the right thing. Thank you Amazon!
B0017ZB8M6|5.0|Great songs, and not just \\"I Kissed a Girl\\". The whole album is good. Definately worth a listen and a buy.
B00005JPY0|3.0|Everyone knows about the movies that are very well written, casted, and directed. They are awarded and phrased films we've placed on our movie shelves for good looks and not show (There Will Be Blood, No Country For Old Men, Atonement, Titanic, Broke back Mountain, Batman Returns, may i continue...)  . I have added The Dark Knight to the movie I must own, because it was great (and Heath Ledger died before it's release and has made it history), but i will never suffer through the three hours of talk talk talk and batman's boring humiliation AGAIN!!! EVER!
0783227434|4.0|This is a movie that has grown on me with age. I love it now for what it is and always has been. Army of Darkness solidified Bruce Campbell as a cult hero and he carries this film with his funny line delivery and one huge chin. The special effects and sets are pretty bad, but it's all about the campy fun from start to finish. There are some classic scenes and lines you will feel compelled to quote to people, probably getting you many blank stares from those who have not witnessed Ash in action.<br /><br />I have the Boomstick version with the original and director's cut. I like them both, but the picture quality sucks on the DC, so I usually watch the theatrical version.
B001BPJJ9G|4.0|when it comes down to real story telling this is the movie that will captivate your senses. What's absorbing about this film is the fact it's seen through the eyes of the young listener, who does not have the usual imagination of the injured stunt man or we as the audience. By the films ending you will leave with one lovable lesson on life and the passion to one day visit far away lands such as India.
B0013LPS7U|3.0|The original Boy album is a great CD and the remastering is well done here with a lot of muddled aspects of the original cleaned up.  But this deluxe 2CD set is definitely not for the casual fan and not worth the money.  The second disc has only noteworthy moments.  The early versions of \\"Stories for boys\\" and \\"Out of control\\" are interesting for a true U2 fan.  As is the song \\"Saturday night\\".  But \\"Boy-girl\\" and \\"Cartoon world\\" are horrible. The live version of 11 O'Clock Tick Tock is forgettable.    Basically, this 2CD set offers interesting insight into the beginnings of U2.  But for the casual fan, I would recommend buying the single disc, since even I, a big U2 fan, will not be throwing the second disc in the player all that often.
B00005JPS8|5.0|For those with low attention spans, this is the perfect movie to watch. You will be (as critics like to say) 'on the edge of your seat' the whole way through. The role of Tony Stark was perfectly casted with Robert Downey Jr. who is satisfyingly hysterical! If someone asked for an entertaining action movie, I believe Iron Man is the one to recommend.
0143113100|5.0|Norman Doidge offers an entertaining account of how researchers on the frontiers of neuroscience are creating a better world for all us. The stories he weaves keep our attention on many heroes. These range from researchers who are to be admired for their intelligence and persistence to others who have overcome great difficulties.    Most importantly, Doidge makes significant news readily accessible to those who are seeking better understanding of who they are and they how they might help themselves and others. A brain surgeon colleague was suitably impressed when I prompted him to read this fascinating account of brain science.     This book is a must read for health professionals, educators, mums and dads and all of us over 55. Friends and I have given away numerous copies. The recipients are never disappointed. [BTW, I have never met Norman. I have no shares in the publisher's company nor am I readily given to writing effusive reviews.]

031606792X|5.0|The story of Bella and Edward will continue always for me.  It was truly a wonderful love story.  Stephanie Meyer is an amazing writer and had all my emotions captured thru all four novels.  I couldn't have been more happy with how she closed the series. When I closed the back cover on the book, not one part of me felt like I had missed out on anything or that anything was missing.  I know people wanted more mayham and distruction.  But all I wanted was a love story that would go on forever.  And that is exactly what Stephanie gave me.  A love story that I can read again and again.  My heart broke along with Bella's when Edward left her and I never wanted to feel that grief again. We all want our happy ending and real life can sometimes be too hurtful.  Beautifully written, beautiful ending.
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|Just for fun, I watched the Director's commentary with the film and now understand why watching this film is like looking through a broken kaleidoscope. It starts with birds chirping on a beautiful landscape, moves to an odd close up, over the shoulder, of a book Lizzie is reading, but you can't see the title of, then has her walking over a FILTHY duck pond into a working farm house, eavesdropping on her parents.   The whole movie goes back and forth between modern use of cameras against a backdrop of regency styles. The family, the costumes, the houses, are all regency, while the camera work fractures the story-telling with its movement from harshly lit close ups to single hand held shots. In the commentary, even the director admits Dame Judy Dench looks awful in her close ups when she comes to visit Lizzie in the middle of the night to confront her about Darcy's proposal. He talks about getting ideas on the way to filming different scenes - like the sunlit close up of Lizzie when she travels to Derbyshire with her aunt and uncle came to him when he put his head out the car door in the sunlight when he was going to a film location.   This story seems filmed a bit off the hip, or off the cuff - improvised!    I still love it. The unspoiled landscapes are gorgeous. From the Longbourne house with its moat and surrounding wildlife and even the farm life to the gorgeous grecian temple in Wiltshire - I will try to go there now that I know where it is - where Darcy proposes makes me melt to the cadence of Matthew MacFadyen's voice. I want to go there just to listen to the echoes of the scene - in the rain, of course. He is a revelation as Darcy, although I can also picture him in modern terms as a spy in his series Spooks. But he is fun and sexy. The close up of his hand after he touches Elizabeth helping her into the carriage is glorious.    I would recommend listening to the directors comments about ALL  his casting choices, what he feels about their performances, the design of the sets, and how he made his decisions in telling the story.  (the ribbon dyeing scene is wonderful).     So I would recommend this film to anyone. But I would caution them that it is a clash of sensibilities - modern and regency.   Thanks for making it.

B000N6TX1I|3.0|Oddly, I must be one of the few folks to have seen \\"Children of Men\\" and did not form an opinion as to it being a rancid pile of rotting mule skin or the greatest movie since [[ASIN:B000063UR1 Silent Running]]. I found the basic premise to be fascinating: How would the world react twenty years into an epidemic of childlessness? Which some of the reviewers here seem to miss...this is not just how the world reacts to the onset of infertility, but almost two decades since the last baby was born. So many industries would fall into slow collapse; education, garments, much of the medical industry, etc...as the population ages past the point where new folks would replenish both consumer and professional.<br /><br />Clive Owen starts off the movie in a coffee shop as the world learns of the death of its youngest citizen. He walks into a city full of violent rebellion and to where Britain is the last nation that hasn't fallen into anarchy. The government has slipped into a fascist state in order to keep from being overrun by refugees, yet Owen's ex-wife (Julianne Moore, great in a brief role) kidnaps him to set a plot into motion. They have discovered the last pregnant woman on Earth, an African named Kee. They need to smuggle her out of England to a mysterious \\"Human Project\\" group.<br /><br />This is where the chaos really begins and the allegories become oppressive. Kee's baby has no discernable father (and a miracle birth is even joked about). The miracle baby has factions splitting off of factions before the little savior is even born. Oh yes, the African mother; how very Cradle of Civilization! Plus one reclusive ex-hippie idealist (Michael Caine, all crazy hair, John Lennon and homegrown weed) to emphasize just how badly the sixties failed when they were all so much better then than these fascists now.<br /><br />The heavy handedness of the message is carried by some incredible cinematography, like the near ten minute single-camera shot of Owen racing through the prison camp uprising while under fire. London in decay is depressingly gritty as is the Fugee concentration camp (with shades of Abu Gharib). The sense of dread curdles under each character (like Owen's visit to his brother, the art curator), yet the tiny light of hope of the new baby still stops a war in its tracks, however briefly.<br /><br />It is that final sense of redemption - the \\"maybe we might get our miserable species out of this mess anyway\\" message - that keeps the relentlessly bleak view of \\"Children of Men\\" from completely tanking. But it's the ham-fisted proletyzing that also stops it from arcing beyond its science-fiction art-house roots.under fire.

0385340567|1.0|After writing great books like Die Trying, One Shot and Bad Luck why you had to put Nothing to Lose out there is beyond my comprehension. Why is it bad?  Let me count the ways. 1) The plot is convoluted, ridiculous, strained and uninteresting. 2) The details are forced. It is great that you tell us how Jack figures things out, but you filled page after page with meaningless minutia. 3)Character Assassination - in one fell swoop you made Reacher anti-army, anti-war, anti-church, a murderer, and a pacificist. I am surprised you left out him becoming a Vegan and a ballet star. 4)You forgot your audience. Reacher fans want the old Reacher. If this is the direction you are taking, one fan at least is through with the Lee Child gravy train. 5) Cardinal sin you committed is that you injected yourself into this book. You clearly want us out of Iraq which is okay but you co-opted Jack to put forth your views. You should have written a separate book with that agenda. Using Jack was unbelievable based upon the character you have developed over several books and at the very least, boring. I would predict that Jack Reacher fans are not as anti-military as you would like. I personally do not believe in the apocalypse but he should not have killed Thurman when he could have arrested him and posed no health risk to anyone. Now you have Reacher playing God which is as bad as Thurman playing god. 6) \\"Bad Writing-Big Trouble\\" - please don't go any further down this road. This book was so hard to read. Only my own rule to finish any book I begin to read kept me going. Thanks for all the others. Good Luck!
B000ZBPQEO|3.0|EMI has been releasing a great many ambitious box sets lately, some devoted to specific composers with as many as 30 CDs, but this dwarfs them all (except for the Maria Callas tome), and I'm just talking about volume one, the orchestral collection. Was i glad to see it done? Certainly! Do I wish that a little more care had gone into the planning and execution? Heartily!     The idea is a fine one, assembling all of Karajan's official EMI orchestral recordings in one package, and remastering many of them once again. But the execution is amateurish -- the paltry booklet giving the tracklist for each CD has no index, so if you are, say, only interested at a particular moment in hearing Karajan's interpretations of Johann Strauss II or Liszt, or even Bruckner (or any other composer, for that matter), get ready to turn a lot of pages and make lots of notes of disc numbers. Second, given that this is a 2008 release, the CDs aren't even title readout encoded (or whatever they call the function that displays the title of the piece as you play it, along with running time etc.), which is now pretty much standard.     And finally -- and I'm wondering if anyone else has run into this problem with this or any other of these EMI mega-sets, of Karajan, Callas, Vaughan Williams etc. -- a third of the CDs among the first dozen in this box (and the Vaughan Williams set) would not boot-up/scan/play properly in my player; some were perfect, but four of the first twelve cycled and cycled and spun a while but would not play, and two would only start in the middle of the disc (though they all did work fine on my Mac and in my all-region DVD player, but that's not what I have them for, or where I want to use them); I had two other box sets on my listening shelf the same evening from Universal, both Europe and Japan; and one from Sony US (an \\"original jackets\\" box), and every one of those discs played perfectly, without a hitch or a glitch.     Maybe at a retail price point of under $3 a disc it's too much to expect that this kind of box is much more than an ornament for a living room, the CD equivalent of a coffee table book  -- \\"a set for people who don't listen to CDs\\" is how the best classical retailer I know in New York describes it.     Oh, and I will admit that the sound on what I've heard is fine, with the early Vienna recordings a marked improvement over some prior issues. But the producers of this set still have a very long way to go to fulfill its promise and potential; and as is all-too-often the case with these big CD (and DVD) sets, someone in the art department is making life very difficult for the purchaser -- in this instance, someone should have told the appropriate people at EMI, yes, keep it simple but don't neglect the bloody obvious, either! Meanwhile, I still listen to the late mono and the stereo parts of the Karajan EMI library on my late 1980's CDs of this same material, organized conveniently on a normal shelf, easy-to-find etc.
0375703764|1.0|I really wanted to like this book.  All the post-modern literary devices appeal to me, and I was looking forward to the creative typesetting, the story of Johnny Truant told in footnotes, all of it.  I am the kind of reader who often finds myself up til the wee hours when I get engrossed in a book.  I thought House of Leaves had the potential to be one of those books.<br /><br />But as it turned out, all this book ever did was put me to sleep.  Part of the problem was that the literary devices in this case really got in the way of the story.  Being diverted from the narrative of the \\"main\\" story by a three-page footnote is disruptive to say the least.  And when it happens every chapter, it just starts to get annoying.  But the bigger problem for me was that I fundamentally didn't care about any of these characters.  Johnny Truant was a compulsive liar with a crush on a stripper.  Whoo-hoo.  Zampano was hard for me to relate to, since more than half of his \\"work\\" was nothing more than fictional scholarly articles.  The Navidsons, if we are to believe they were anything but a fiction created by Zampano, were shallow, self-absorbed people who I really couldn't feel much sympathy for.  The only characters I ever cared about at all were Johnny's institutionalized mother, and Jed.  Unfortunately, these characters only had small parts in the book.  About halfway through the story (which was way earlier than halfway through the book), I started skipping the footnotes altogether.  I really couldn't get into Johnny's story, because I just didn't care about him.  All I wanted was to have the small satisfaction of finding out the end of the story about the house (it was disappointing), and then the greater satisfaction of returning this book to the library.  I'm glad to be rid of it, and even more glad that I didn't waste any money on it.

031606792X|5.0|Breaking Dawn was a great finale to the Twilight saga.  My one complaint is that now it's over.  I am anxiously awaiting the movie, the companion books, and Midnight Sun.  This is a great book for kids as young as 13 and as old as 30.  These are the best books I've ever read (and I am not usually a fan of vampires).
B000WZAE1I|5.0|This movie is family friendly but also great entertainment for an adult.  Truly, who doesn't love a pirate in a dress?
031606792X|5.0|Excellent finish to a wonderful fantasy! This story couldn't have ended more perfectly!  Another great work by Stephenie Meyer!! In my personal opinion, the negative reviews are most likely coming from the young population of Twilight fans who cannot comprehend the complexity of life, love and family.  The first three books in this series focused on \\"young love\\", the final book focuses on much, much more.  We get to experience how young love develops into far more as the relationship matures.  We get a first-hand look into how Edward and Bella's love strengthens and grows over time and eventually expands to include parental and family love.  \\"Young love\\" is a precious stage in all good relationships but young love is just that...YOUNG!  This story represents how magical love can be even beyond the initial infatuation and intrigue that a couple experiences in the \\"Twilight\\" of a new relationship.

0451197968|4.0|I haven't met a Bachman book so far that I haven't been a fan of. While this isn't my favorite from the pseudonym, it is still very enjoyable. This book was originally published in 1982, and like \\"the long walk\\" focuses on a futuristic America. (this time the year 2025).    It's always interesting to read books written over 20 years ago about a futuristic America in which we now live. (even though we're not quite to 2025 yet) Some of the small things you notice are that cigarette vending machines are present, the costs of items are more representative of what they were in the 80's, and the dialogue has obviously changed. Most would look at these as distractions, but I actually found them enjoyable. It made me appreciate that much more the story Stephen King wrote because it gave me better perspective on when he wrote it.    In King's novel every household is, by law, equipped with a \\"free-vee\\" whose programming is designed by \\"the network\\". The \\"games\\" that people watch exploit those participating for the entertainment of those who are watching. (sound familiar?) This was written long before reality television was mainstream. One of the games depicted by King is called Treadmill to Bucks. The contestants run on a treadmill and have to answer questions. If they answer incorrectly the treadmill speeds up. According to the author, \\"they only accept chronic heart, liver, or lung patients sometimes throwing in a crip for comic relief\\".    Like all of his books, especially of the Bachman variety, the story centers heavily on the people. In this case it is Ben Richards an unemployed father whose daughter has pneumonia and he can't afford medicine. His wife is prostituting herself just to be able to buy black market medicine for the child and food for the family. (This is no Arnold Schwarzenegger in the film of the same name. They have very few if any similarities.)      Very enjoyable, and a quick read. Definitely recommended.
B0017VG69U|5.0|First off this is obviously priced better than the previous HD/Combo season...so that is a major plus.    There are many fan favorite episodes here as well as a ton of extras. Totally worth it.
031606792X|2.0|[possible spoilers throughout]    I read Breaking Dawn when it first came out, but I've been dallying in writing a review because I'd hoped that, like Eclipse, I would gradually come to see the wisdom in the decisions made by the author, for the characters. Safe to say: I don't think it's going to happen and the finale of my favorite series will forever live in Two (very generous) Star Land.     I do not think that fiction must mesh with \\"reality\\" -- it therefore does not bother me, in the abstract, that Breaking Dawn is built on absurd premises because, folks, it's a novel about vampires. If you're complaining that it's not a realistic enough novel about vampires, might I suggest I genre switch? Following that, I have no problem with Bella not going to college, marrying at 18, or being a good or bad role model for actual teenage girls. In abstract, I have no issue at all with vampires having babies, being \\"vegetarian\\" (or not being vegetarian, for that matter), mating with humans, falling in love with humans. I don't mind that a werewolf can imprint on a half-vamp baby and, by golly, I really do love a happy ending! I need no suffering to justify or temper the outcome of a fictional tale.     What I DO need, however, is for the series of events within one book of a series to mesh with the events from previous books in the series and, above all, to follow the \\"rules\\" established for the fictitious tale. Anyone can write rule-less story. A truly good author can present (obliquely) a series of rules within their made-up world and then weave the story around, and in accordance with, those rules. I could save us all a lot of verbiage and state the following as my complete review:    With Breaking Dawn, Meyer negates much of the previous three books and throws all the \\"rules\\" out of the window in order to provide an arbitrarily \\"happy\\" ending that has nothing whatever to do with a \\"happy\\" ending for the series she'd already written.     But I'll write more.     What we get, via a vampire Bella and a . . . a . . . baby, is a happy ending for someone standing outside of the Twilight Series. We get a generic happy ending suited for the average human female: immortality with endless wealth, a foxy husband who's incapable of leaving you (as well as you him) and a magically beautiful child who will conveniently cease aging at her most appealing age (as well as the one which will allow her to live, unfettered, as a Cullen) and who already has a built-in boyfriend who is, himself, incapable of leaving *her* (as well as she him). I mean, if you look up \\"Happy Ending\\" (no, not *that* kind) in your Funk and Wagnalls, I'm pretty sure they've placed a picture of the extended Cullen-Swan-Black clan beside the entry, because there is so much abstract happiness is the situation Meyer created that it makes me throw up a little in my mouth. And that's fine, I suppose, except that it has *nothing whatever* to do with the three preceding books.     The choice that seemed to underpin the entire series -- that drove all of Bella's ridiculous actions in Eclipse -- we find out, with Breaking Dawn, meant nothing. And i don't mean to sound that I think Bella needed to suffer for her decisions, because I don't think she really would have. We had three books of Bella deliberating over multiple major life choices and, one by one, she knocked them down to arrive at her grand finale, only to be handed everything she never indicated was important and be told that \\"oh, ha ha. Just kidding about forcing you to make all those decisions.\\" If I were Bella, I'd be seriously peeved right about now.     Plot issues aside, my other complaints about Breaking Dawn are your standard issue. The characters don't seem like themselves, Edward all but disappears as a main character, in practice, by the beginning of Eclipse and the vamp who returns to play his role in Breaking Dawn should really be sent back to the daytime soaps. Jacob, who is much redeemed in this book, is allowed to continue his ascent to Edward's former position as Grand Poobah Male of the Twilight Universe. The relationship between Edward and Bella feels rushed and, while I was desperate for some physical moments between Edward and new Vamp Bella, is almost entirely comprised of a series of fade-to-black descriptions of sexy times between the two of them. There is none of the allure between them, little of the tenderness and quiet understanding they shared for all of Twilight, parts of New Moon and occasionally in Eclipse.     So while everyone got everything they wanted, the one Person (in the royal sense) who was utterly shafted was the reader. And, granted, it was never \\"our\\" story and \\"we\\" are entitled to no such flourish of contentment, but the fact remains that we were presented with one story that had a fixed outcome based on choices made and, at the wrap party, were met with Ashton Kutcher in a trucker hat, freaking out about how we'd been punked.

0679720200|5.0|(This is a review of the Matthew Ward translation; black an dwhite cover)    This is a newish translation, done by an American rather than the British translation that had previously been the only English version of this French classic. It seems Camus was heavily influenced by American literature of the period -- Hemmingway, Faulkner and others -- and had written The Stranger, the first half especially, to reflect those stylistic sensibilities. The translator argues in his forward that much of that was lost in the British translation. And so here, it is restored.        The result is a matter-of-fact tone more in keeping with our unlikable protagonist, the distant, somewhat bitter Meursault. His almost emotionless life and anti-social tone are stark and ugly, traits that drag him beneath the waves when he is put on trial for murder. As always, The Stranger is compelling reading, but also frustrating, because it is so impossible to care for the main character in the final chapters.    Camus' timeless classic remains as essential today as it was when released, while this new translation gets us a bit closer to the stylistic approach he allegedly wanted. Essential reading.
1594201749|5.0|If you read nothing else this year, get your hands on \\"Playing the Enemy\\" and read pages 201 to 253.<br /><br />It won't take long.<br /><br />By the time Nelson Mandela walks into that stadium, your heart will be pounding. By the time he walks into the Springboks locker, you'll be in tears. And you'll cry pretty much straight through to the end.<br /><br />All because, on June 24, 1995, the South African Rugby team beat New Zealand to win the Rugby World Cup.<br /><br />If you're like most Americans, you know that Nelson Mandela spent 27 years in prison --- 18 of them in a tiny cell on Robben Island --- and emerged without hatred to spearhead a peaceful transfer of power in South Africa. But you probably know nothing about the 1995 Rugby World Cup match. John Carlin's brilliant book corrects that, and, along the way, presents a concise biography of a remarkable man.<br /><br />In these pages, Nelson Mandela is a brilliant politician with a genius for disarming his enemies. To Mandela, everyone is human, everyone can be reached. The only question is how. In prison, he would introduce his lawyer to his \\"guard of honor\\" --- and his jailers would find themselves shaking hands with an attorney they loathed. And he used his dead time in prison to teach himself Afrikaans, read the Afrikaans newspapers and familiarize himself with Afrikaner history.<br /><br />Rugby is the favorite sport of Afrikaners, the dominant white tribe in South Africa --- \\"apartheid's master race.\\" All but one of the 15 players on the Springbok team were white. In a stadium that held 62,000, 95% of the crowd would be white. No wonder that blacks saw the Boks as a symbol of oppression.<br /><br />\\"Don't address their brains,\\" Mandela believed. \\"Address their hearts.\\" One direct way to do that was through sports. People love their teams; the connection is purely emotional. If the Springboks could come to engage both blacks and whites, that might end the sense among blacks that sports in South Africa was \\"apartheid in tracksuits\\" --- and might make whites more accepting of blacks as equals.<br /><br />Mandela did not just lay out a goal. He met and charmed the white lords of rugby, then lobbied for the World Cup to be played in South Africa. He invited François Pienaar, the Springboks captain, to visit him and encouraged him to see his sport as \\"nation building\\". Soon the team was learning how to sing \\"Nkosi Sikele\\", the black national anthem. And, because a storybook fantasy was becoming reality, the Springboks advanced steadily to the World Cup finals.<br /><br />The pages that are your homework begin on the morning of the championship game. One of Mandela's bodyguards got an idea: Mandela should enter the stadium wearing a green-and-gold Springbok jersey. Mandela improved on the idea --- his jersey, he said, should have Pienaar's number on it.<br /><br />Across town, the players had been staying at a hotel. To calm their nerves, they went out for an early morning jog. As they left, Pienaar recalled, \\"Four little black kids selling newspapers recognized us and chased after us and started calling out our names --- they knew almost everyone on that team --- and the hairs on my neck stood on end... It was the moment when I saw, more clearly than ever before, that this was far bigger than anything we could ever have imagined.\\"<br /><br />Five minutes before kickoff, Nelson Mandela walked onto the field to greet the players. To the Springbok jersey, he had added a Springbok hat. \\"When they caught sight of him,\\" Carlin writes, \\"the crowd seemed to go dead still.\\" And then the chant --- from the almost all-white crowd --- began: \\"Nel-son! Nel-son! Nel-son!\\"<br /><br />I'm going to leave it there, so as not to spoil the magic of the next pages for you. Just know that what happened in that stadium that afternoon was a crazy quilt of glory: atonement, forgiveness, liberation and celebration. It's the kind of event that happens when people who have known only hatred andfear drop the burden of history and move past their differences. Winning a game? That day South Africa climbed a mountain.<br /><br />It is a measure of the quality of this story that Morgan Freeman is producing a film based on the book --- and playing Nelson Mandela. Matt Damon will be Pienaar, the South African rugby captain. And Clint Eastwood is slated to direct.<br /><br />I guarantee you: Audiences will cheer. And weep. And these will be tears of joy, because --- for once --- a national leader had perfect pitch, and all of his countrymen knew it, and they all got it right.<br /><br />In other countries, even in our own, skeptics doubt that this kind of brotherhood can be engineered. It can be. It was.h Africa climbed a mountain.    It is a measure of the quality of this story that Morgan Freeman is producing a film based on the book --- and playing Nelson Mandela.

B001BGTWXI|4.0|It's not easy being Slipknot. With nine people to bounce ideas between and an overly-fickle fanbase, it's getting harder and harder for them to release an album that truly delivers. Perhaps that's why it took them four long years to release another album, and perhaps that's why it doesn't live up to all that it's expected to be.<br /><br />When you make an album as strong and expansive as 2004's \\"Vol. 3: the Subliminal Verses\\" it's got to be impossible to follow it up. So, with their newest album, Slipknot attempt to combine the edginess of \\"Vol. 3\\" with the mean-streak of 2001's \\"Iowa\\" and for the most part, it works. \\"All Hope Is Gone\\" is definitely Slipknot. It's well made and well played, but there is definitely something missing.<br /><br />With every album Slipknot releases comes change. We saw it from 1999's somewhat dated but fun self-titled affair (the first featuring frontman Corey Taylor, thus, the first in the string of \\"true\\" Slipknot albums) to the brutality of 2001's \\"Iowa.\\" To counter that, in 2004, the band released their most melodic and experimental album to date in \\"Vol. 3.\\" Unfortunately, four years later, change isn't in the cards, and \\"All Hope Is Gone\\" treads over territory all too familiar.<br /><br />Make no mistake, this is still a strong album, even if a certain aspect is missing. Songs like \\"Vendetta,\\" \\"Gematria (The Killing Name)\\" and the title track are 100% classic, pure, unbridled Slipknot. If you can't appreciate these songs, you probably didn't like the band to begin with. \\"Sulfur,\\" \\"Dead Memories\\" and the first single, \\"Psychosocial,\\"  capitalize well on Taylor's knack for melody and catchy hooks. Sandwiched in between are some strong and compelling material (\\"Snuff\\") and, unfortunately, some of the most dumbed down and predictable music the band has recorded to date (\\"The Butcher's Hook\\"). To say they combined the best of \\"Vol. 3\\" and \\"Iowa\\" on this album is definitely the best way to describe it, as each songs could have a place on either album.<br /><br />\\"All Hope Is Gone\\" -- in a nutshell -- is a good album, hampered by the lack of freshness. Perhaps all the side projects and stand-in gigs have taken their toll on the creative well within the band, and if that's the case, four years is too long to wait for album number five. Slipknot are still a great band, iconic even. And on the same side of the coin, \\"All Hope Is Gone\\" is a strong release. But they need something more. Something that sets them even apart even more from the ever expanding pack of new metal bands. And that something, unfortunately, isn't here.l Hope Is Gone\\" -- in a nutshell -- is a good album, hampered by the lack of freshness.

0790705141|5.0|The Shining (1980) is in every way an epic horror classic that really just gets under your skin. It's not only one of the best horror films ever, but also one of the best noteworthy flicks of 1980. I won't get into the plot too much as I'm sure by now it is no mystery to anyone. But I will share my feelings on it and what the impact of watching it is like. The Shining could almost be called a cinematic perfect storm with so many factors combining together that worked out so advantageously.<br /><br />The first is Stephen King's novella, which this adaptation is one of the few to actually do justice to, the second is director Stanley Kubrick's masterful vision and the third, of course, is Jack Nicholson's frighteningly intense, tour-de-force performance that will scare the S#*% out of you! Ordinarily in most of his movies, it's fun to watch the always larger-than-life Jack chew scenery, but here in The Shining it's much more likely to scare than amuse you. I can only imagine how unnerving it must have been the crew on set during filming with Jack when he was in character and if they were ever worried if he would know when to break it between takes! Also, the son's repeated, high-pitched screaming of redrum (murder spelled backwards, as we all know) is pretty disturbing and scary as well.<br /><br />Thanks largely in part due to a very creepy musical score and a remote, snowbound Colorado location at the resort, an overall sensation of forlorn dread and isolation permeates this film, which only further amplifies the terror factor. All of this combined with nightmarish, haunted hotel imagery, ghoulish apparitions and setting make for a pretty damn scary cinematic experience. Almost 30 years later, this horror epic still packs a potent punch. Definitely one that stays with you and one you don't want to ideally watch by yourself!<br /><br />Even as an adult, to this day and beyond, this movie still gives me the creeps.
B000059TEP|3.0|Somewhere between good and bad lies `Ghost', a film that has enough working for it to offset the elements working against it, but in the end can't really be labeled as a `good' film or a `bad' one.  I feel somewhat torn as to my response towards `Ghost' because the film is essentially two films, one of which works far greater than the other.  There is a love story and a murder mystery, and the love story (which ends up taking a back seat to the murder mystery) is in all actuality the most impressive and touching part of the story.  The murder mystery should have been stripped from the screenplay in my opinion, especially since it is obvious even before Sam is killed who exactly is going to have it done and why.<br /><br />So, the film centers on Sam and Molly, an attractive couple who are deep in love (even if Sam never says it) and have just moved into an apartment together.  One night out on the town they run into a mugger who strikes Molly causing Sam to burst into a furious rage and gets himself shot.  Now Molly is all alone with her grief; well sort of.  Sam is not gone; his spirit is still allowed on Earth because he has some unfinished business to settle before he can enter heaven.  That's when Sam meets Oda Mae Brown, a scam artist posing as a spiritual counselor who can actually hear Sam and thus offers to help Sam reach Molly.<br /><br />The film tends to fall apart when Oda Mae is not on the screen, namely because without Whoopi's brilliant comedic work the film drifts into clich&eacute; after clich&eacute;.  Instead of focusing on the undying love between Sam and Molly, which is really what this movie was supposed to be about, it focuses on the reason for Sam's murder (which could have easily been left as a senseless act of violence, allowing for the `love story' within this film to shine forward) and this tends to take away from the originality of the film.<br /><br />When the movie began and Sam and Molly were kissing and falling all over each other during the now infamous clay pot scene I was so touched (that was one of the most erotic scenes I have ever seen in a film) and I really expected the film to draw off of that vibe when placing together the plot.  I wanted to see Sam try and embrace Molly when she was alone and feel the chemistry between the two of them as she felt him near her, but that never happened.<br /><br />Sam was too preoccupied, thus the audience becomes too preoccupied to remember the basis of this film.<br /><br />The acting was actually pretty good, and in some areas excellent.  Whoopi Goldberg, or should I say `Oscar Winner' Whoopi Goldberg, is the best part of this film.  Her comedic timing is impeccable and I really can't think of another actress who could have pulled this off as brilliantly as she did.  Demi Moore was also wonderful as Molly, her emotional breakdowns wholly believable, as was her love for Sam.  I also enjoyed Tony Goldwyn's neurotic portrayal of Carl Bruner, Sam's friend.  His acting was a little clich&eacute;d but he was entertaining.  I have never been one to think of Patrick Swayze as a good actor, and sadly `Ghost' didn't change my mind any either.  He was serviceable, but his outbursts seemed forced and contrived.<br /><br />In the end I can say that `Ghost' works on some levels and should really be seen for Goldberg at least (who is truly amazing).  I just wish that the script would have been thought through a little more, for this had the potential of being a beautiful romantic film but instead became your standard murder mystery.  I also thought that the depictions of the afterlife were a little `Ghostbusters' but that's may just be me.I was so touched (that was one of the most erotic scenes I have ever seen in a film) and I really expected the film to draw off of that vibe when placing together the plot.

I have a hard time finding a good book for him to read that is not too \\"girly.\\"  This book actually got my son interested in reading.  He loved it so much, we had to go buy the next book as soon as he finished this one.  And my husband is not at all a reader either, but he actually sat down and read this whole book and said it was great.  Anything that gets my son excited about reading can't be a bad thing.

B001EOQWEO|5.0|Previous reviewers of this amazing film have confined themselves to the plot.  Someone should mention the fact that half of the film is a black and white silent movie.  How much is communicated with no sound (by a machine, no less).  Once humans are \\"back in the picture\\" the style changes completely.  And how about the fact that the machines have to \\"teach\\" the humans how to be human.  These Pixar people truly are sophisticated filmakers of the highest order.

Amazon carries the \\"chubby board book\\" version which is great because then it can be carried around without being destroyed.
0374105235|5.0|Unbelievable story told through the eyes of a 12 year old boy. I read some of the negative reviews posted on this website related to this book. The reviewers felt his (the author) facts weren't true and some things were impossible to have happened. I want to dispell any commentary surrounding this. Remember, this is being told from a 12 year old child's perspective. It brings awareness to the despicable acts humans place upon each other. And, as always, the most central question remains: What will we do about it? Probably nothing. At the very least, read the book. Then, watch Blood Diamonds. The scenes in which boy soldiers are shown are based on the fact presented in this book.
B000MCH5P4|2.0|What did I learn from watching \\"Babel\\"?  1. Never leave your kids alone with a Mexican Nannie.  2. Being a Tokyo dentist has its perks.  3. Americans - just stay the F out of the Middle East.    Of course, the way this movie is produced is you're supposed to feel bad for the drunk Mexican endangering the lives of two little kids, and the \\"bad guys\\" are the border patrol officers who try to help them.  We are also supposed to feel bad for two Morrocan kids who shoot an innocent American tourist, and a Japanese deaf/mute slut (I'm not kidding) who flashes her snatch all over Tokyo.  I give this movie a \\"C\\", unless you're a smarter than the rest of us liberal movie reviewer, who all loved this lame movie.
B00005JPY0|4.0|Wow!  My heart was beating so hard during \\"The Dark Knight\\" that I thought I was having a heart attack.  Of all the Batman films I've seen, \\"The Dark Knight\\" is the most violent and the most depressing.  The Joker represents everything that is wrong with humanity.  He is vile, amoral, sadistic and cruel; he shows no mercy as he dispatches friend and foe alike.<br /><br />  \\"The Dark Knight\\" is extremely entertaining . . . for adults.  It is non-stop violence from beginning to end.  There are intense scenes involving the taking of hostages, and their subsequent tortures and deaths.  There are numerous terrorist acts where buildings explode.  Major characters betray, deceive, and seek bloody vengeance.  \\"The Dark Knight\\" is not a movie for children.  It should have been rated \\"R.\\"  Otherwise, the violence should have been toned down in order to give it a \\"PG-13\\" rating.<br /><br />  The original Batman movies, starring Michael Keaton as Batman and directed by Tim Burton, were geared more for children.  They had a gothic feel and appearance that distinguished the mythical Gotham City from New York, Las Angeles, and other big cities of the real world.  I missed the gothic elements.  \\"The Dark Knight\\" reminded me of action movies such as the ones found in the \\"Die Hard\\" series.  Gone was the comic book adventure found in \\"Fantastic Four\\" and \\"The Incredible Hulk.\\"<br /><br />  If you enjoy violent action thrillers, then you must see \\"The Dark Knight.\\"  The Joker is a diabolical street thug with a witty, dark sense of humor.  We never learn his true identity, which adds a delightful sense of mystery to the film.  Who is he and what does he want?  He tells different versions of how he obtained his scars.  He is an insane, pathological liar.  I hope to see him in another sequel.  However, since Heath Ledger has sadly died, I don't know how soon, if ever, that will happen.

B00006F7S4|5.0|Who'd have thought it? Beck Hansen, the onetime ironic champion of ironic trash culture, has grown up. The Beck we see here eschews sampling and sarcasm entirely, and doesn't rap at all. Instead, the backing tracks are warm, and lush, and Beck switches from rapping to crooning in a gentle baritone inspired by Nick Drake. There's often an orchestra, but it never overwhelms the main focus: the lyrics. It's a breakup record, and it's the most genuine thing Beck ever put out. He doesn't do any screwing around, he doesn't once try to display how clever he is. He just sings from his heart for fifty minutes or so, and the result is the best record Beck ever made. I know most prefer Odelay and Mutations, but I think this bests either of them. It's a very melodic, haunting, gorgeous record. The string arrangements are inspired (\\"Paper Tiger,\\" \\"Lonesome Tears\\"), the singing is much better than it ever was (\\"Guess I'm Doing Fine,\\" probably the most emotional song Beck's ever released; \\"Lost Cause\\"), and the lyrics are dead earnest, heartbroken, and much better than any others he's ever done (\\"Golden Age\\"). There is also some excellent production supplements scattered about, including prominent electric piano on \\"End of the Day\\" and odd sound effects that fit completely with the album's somber tone everywhere. Even lesser songs like \\"It's All in Your Head\\" have likeable touches such as stand-up bass. The best song is probably the eerie, spacey mood piece \\"Round the Bend,\\" though it's also hard to argue with \\"Lost Cause\\" and \\"Guess I'm Doing Fine\\". He also gets points for using elements of the Far East in his vocals and guitar tone on \\"Already Dead\\", which demonstrates quite an able falsetto as well. He even works in some wary, cautious optimism into the chorus of \\"Sunday Sun,\\" which has a U2/Coldplay style chord progression and an abrasive ending. A bit more variety would've helped the record, as it closes with two good but disappointing acoustic ballads (\\"Little One,\\" \\"Side of the Road\\"), but as it stands this is as good as I've heard from Beck.the Road\\"), but as it stands this is as good as I've heard from Beck.

I highly recommend this book for all who can handle the awesomeness.
B0000256VK|5.0|Roxy Music is not for everyone; and for good reason, it's very progressive, even nowadays.  Roxy is romantic, smooth, sharp, to the point, obscure, discreet, ambient, catchy, dancy, melodic and very, very English with an international flavor.  These guys are talented as a group under the direction of Bryan Ferry, or as soloists with their own projects.  Phil Manzanera is perhaps one of the very best guitar players ever.  Listen to some of his licks, how restrained and clean they are.  Andy McKay is the best sax player I've heard, ever.    That all being said, this is their best album, and their last I believe.  The Eno albums were good, but without Eno pulling one way and Ferry the other, the group flourished during the 1970's becoming an international success.    Avalon is the best, followed by Viva (the live album), then Country Life, Stranded, then Siren.  The other efforts fall into place after these.  To us Yanks, their music still sounds fresh and never dated.

B001DRF84W|5.0|Currently, the majority of the reviews on this page are feeble attempts at warning readers that this is not the brain dead silly CGI-fest that was released in 2008 starring Edward Norton.  I'm here to say that I know exactly which Hulk movie page I'm on, and I know exactly which Hulk movie Blu-ray I'll be purchasing over the other, thank you very much.    When I saddled up for the ride into High Definition, Blu-ray was already victorious over HD-DVD, and Ang Lee's Hulk (2003) was currently exclusive to the dead format.  Many a days I sulked, thinking they would never release Hulk on Blu-ray for me to soak in its breathtaking vistas and vibrant colors in High-definition.  Then, August 1st, 2008 came around, and to my great excitement, it was announced that Blu was the new green.  In my opinion, this movie was made for hi-def.  I salivate simply at the thought of viewing the Hulk bound across the Utah desert in a seamless blend of CG and nature cinematography worthy of Planet Earth.  It is apparent that the team of filmmakers behind this project approached it as a work of art, rather than a shallow popcorn comic book movie to make a quick buck.  More films in Hollywood should be created in this fashion.    Beyond that of being beautiful visually, the Hulk also sets itself apart from the rest by being a heartfelt narrative that no Marvel comic-book adaptation could ever dream of being.  Which is what turned many cold to the movie right off the bat.  This was a comic book movie that could actually live and breath on its own, rather than rely on CGI and tacky \\"Hulk SMASH\\" dialogue.  It attacked deep, psychological problems, making the real battle being that of Bruce Banner vs. The Hulk, instead of CGI green mass vs CGI brown mass with an anti-climactic finish.     If you're Blu, I highly recommend giving this film a view.  It is bound to impress with its striking palette and intense action sequences.  I am quite certain it will be added to my small collection of demo material for the Blu-ray format.
0143038583|2.0|I am going to write a review here that I am sure that will get pummeled and give me nothing but nasty comments and a billion negative votes. So let me say some good things first. Pollan is a gifted writer, is engaging and entertaining to read. The book and it's premises though are a sure recipe for global disaster. Pollan is more even-handed and fair than most of the books trumpeting the perils of industrial farming, but let me please try to explain why these arguments are dangerously flawed. I will try and give and intelligent and considered response and those of you who must blast back at me, I only ask that your comments are equally considered.<br /><br />Many people are scared of industrial farming, the inputs that are used, and the genetic engineering that is advancing farm science. Most of these fears are based upon \\"frankenscience\\" designed delilberately to be scary. Scary and sensational sells books, magazines, and newsprint. The \\"organic\\" label has been profitable to the tune of billions of dollars and will continue to be so. There is so much momentum in the press about the dangers of industrial farming and too much money to be made for it to stop. On the other hand industrial farming is not going to stop either. We have to eat.<br /><br />In our society the best way to control how people think is to control the questions posed. When industrial farming is discussed it is presumed to be bad because it is \\"industrial\\" and there are chemicals involved. Ergo we have the slew of reporting biased against industrial farming. All of these books may even be right and everything they maintain may prove to be true. I doubt it, but even if so we have a problem that is ignored by the media when experts pontificate about agricultural issues. The question isn't whether industrial farming is good or bad. The real question is, \\"there are over 6 billion people on the planet, and the population will grow to be over 9 billion. How are we going to feed everybody?\\"<br /><br />The prescription of this book, more local farming and more organic food, is simply a recipe for billions of deaths through starvation. Many people hate it when facts don't fit their preconceived notions or agendas. In fact, I never seen a political party that doesn't suffer from this flaw. My response is neither political nor do I have an agenda. Although you may not listen to what I have to say, I feel compelled to try and point out the simple holes in the logic of this book. You may not thank me for it, but at least I will have tried. This book is irrational because it refuses to face the real question of how to feed everyone. A rationalist is a person who plays the hand of cards they are dealt, not the hand of cards they wish they had. They solutions offered in this book amount to playing the cards we wish to have rather than the ones we do have.<br /><br />Here are the cards. Land can either be good farmland, tolerable farmland, ranch land, or non-arable. All of the good farmland and tolerable farmland in the world is already being farmed. There are no reserves of land in this world that would make good farmland. You can try to farm ranch ground, or poor farm ground, and you can pursue slash and burn farming in rainforests, but the problem is that the land will only be productive for a few years. After that it is uneconomical to farm it. By that I mean you will put more calories into the farming than you can withdraw. Moreover this land then is subject to erosion and other environmental problems. The simple math is this: there are roughly one billion arable hectares in the world and there are just over 6 billion people. Those are the cards we hold. Can we feed everyone? Yes, for now.<br /><br />Here are the problems with local production and organic food: local production is fabulous when you can do it, but many people do not live where food is produced. Think of New York City. Obviously NYC cannot grow all the food it needs for its population. They need to importfood. This is not a new problem. Ancient Rome was entirely dependent upon food produced in Egypt and other provinces. When people choose to live where the food isn't, there is a cost associated with getting the food to those people. There always has been. However, you also can't wish those people to move to where the food is, because their housing would take up all the farmground. So local markets theoretically work great for certain groups, but it is simply not rational to suggest local production as a solution to world food shortages. There is also a reason why the world looks like it does with densely populated non-agricultural areas and thinly populated agricultural ones. People can't live on the good farmground. Plants have to live there. Therefore, when you really think about it, suggesting local production as a solution is just a preconceived bias that in practical application would cause a lot of people to starve. Sure, some people get to live near the food, and it would be more efficient if they would eat the food produced right next to them rather than food that is shipped halfway round the world. Getting people to do so would make the system slightly more efficient, but it is not going to be the solution. It would be a bandaid on a sucking chest wound. Moreover, it wouldn't work anyway....people don't want it. They like eating bananas from central America, grapes from Chile, lamb from New Zealand, cashews from Vietnam, and cornflakes from Michigan. A diet of only local foods would be very bland compared to the diet to which we have become accustomed. So, you can wish for local production all you want, but those pesky humans are going to mess you up every time. They will pay lots of good money to have tasty foods imported from far distant places.<br /><br />Local production means local foods only. You won't get others to agree to that after they've tasted the goodies of the rest of the world. I sincererly doubt that most readers of this book are actually willing to eat only on what can be organically grown within 20 miles of their residence. If they are not, then they are just chanting, \\"do as I say, not as I do\\", which is the fault I find with this book and the author.<br /><br />Suggesting organic farming as a solution though is frightening. Let's do that simple math again.....one billion hectares and six billion people. Right now, with incredible amounts of oil-based fertilizer, herbicides, pesticides, chemical inputs, and, whoa, even scarier, genetic technology, we are just managing to basically keep those six billion people fed. Organic farming does without those inputs....and produces about 1/4 the equivalent yield. If the world switched to organic farming then 4.5 bilion people would have to starve to death. Even if you are willing to become the biggest mass murderer in the history of the world, people are not just going to sit there and slowly starve to death for you. No, they will fight for food for themselves and their children. When you do the math you will realize that organic farming is much more harmful than the \\"bad meat\\" chant (I'll get to that in a second). Organic farming simply equates into less food output. Less food = less people. Westerners, in a shocking display of hypocrisy, can extoll the virtues of organic farming, decry the use of chemical inputs, suggest local production, etc., while they are chewing on their bananas, dining in expensive restaurants, wearing their leather shoes, burning their oil in their luxury SUV. But we can't have it both ways. To the third world we appear as insufferable, arrogant, self-righteous, and astoundingly stupid hypocrites. Imagine yourself in a west African village explaining organic food and local market approaches. I've been there....they've done it that way for thousands of years. They'd think you were retarded for suggesting back-breaking labor and risk of starvation to have organic food. They have organic food, and they would love to swap places with you. After trying to grow your own food there for a year, organically, you'd want out too. Those villagers would love the chance to use modern inputs to increase their yields, and a trip to a US grocery store would seem like something out of a fairy tale to them. Before espousing organic farming and local production imagine yourself as the person who had to do the labor, moreover you life depends upon your success, and, additionally, say goodbye to anything more intersting than gruel to eat. This book offers answers that sound great in theory, but in real practice you'd find absolutely horrifying.<br /><br />There are real problems with industrial agriculture, primarily its dependency on oil, but I'd prefer to see the author looking at the real problems and trying to craft solutions that can actually be made to work. Solutions that the other 6 billion people on the planet can live with and you can live with too.<br /><br />Complaining about the $75 billion that the feds plug into American agriculture is not very well thought out. I'm not going to defend a single thing the USDA does.....but I am going to defend the reason why it started and why it has to stay. Despite being a capitalist country, we can't not have a safety net in regards to food. If we don't produce enough food in this country then people will DIE. Get it? It's a concept called food security because food is the most important thing in a society. If you don't believe that, just don't eat for two weeks. You can go without gasoline for two weeks, you can sleep outside if you have too, you can live without your DVDs....but try living without food. Since it is the one necessary item before all others, for thousands of years nations have had food security policies and practices. The people in power have to keep the people fed. If they don't, they won't be in power long. The United States is no different and never has been. We have been so blessed with good farmland and good practices that it has been 80 years since we had food shortages. Starvation is not a place any person or any country wants to be. Ergo, governments spend money on agriculture. Yes, sometimes they do stupid things, but food security can't be left to chance. The US Govt is not going to stop, nor should it, implementing policies for our food security. They may not get it right, there may be incompetence and corruption, but it is up to us to do something about it when they get it wrong. We should be deeply thankful that they don't leave food security to the \\"Free Market\\".<br /><br />Another problem overlooked in this book is one of labor. Before the green revolution about 90% of the world population had to work in agriculture. In America today less than 1% of our population has to do so. That frees up the other 99 of us to build cars and houses, write novels, practice medicine, run utilities, make movies and clothing....to do everything that brings us to the level of technology, wealth, and health we enjoy today. Without industrial farming we can't have those 99 people creating and sustaining our level of technology.<br /><br />One last point. The whole \\"meat is bad because it takes eight pounds of grain to make one pound of meat\\". That's just embarassingly wrong, pure proganda, and thankfully Mr. Pollan doesn't fall into this particular trap. What that argument is really saying is that midwestern style feedlots that feed corn to cows are inefficient and oh my gosh! People could eat that corn instead! Then no one would have to starve. I've heard this argument many times before, from many likable people. The problem is that it's not true; moreover it is obviously not true if you think about it. It's an argument that serves the agenda of people who don't like people eating meat. It's an effectively convincing lie apparently, but it is misinformation serving to score political points. I don't care if people eat meat or not, but I do care when deliberate misinformation is used to create a public opinion. Well let me point out the glaringly obvious. Most of the livestock in this world, well over 98%, will never see a feedlot and they will never get to eat anything a person would eat. Hunh? What? By using a small fact, that to fatten a cow in a Kansas feedlot can take eight pounds of corn to creat one pound of gain, and shouting that to the world, you're left to assume that all meat takes eight pounds of grain to create. Not so. No, most of the cows, goats, sheep, chicken, and other beasties in the world that are slated to be our dinners eat things like grass, insects and weeds. Things we can't eat. In fact, I could make a perfectly good argument that based upon on the meat produced for consumption in the world, against all the grain used to create that meat, that it only take 2 ounces of grain to make one pound of meat! Therefore by not eating meat we're going to cause everyone to starve. As Mark Twain once said, \\"there are lies, there are damn lies, and then there are statistics\\". Watch out for the lies and the damn liles, but never believe a statistic. Not even mine. Also be careful of believing what others tell you without thinking it through. If you think about it yourself you will realize that most livestock in the world forage for their food. They're not eating anything a human would eat. The \\"meat is inefficient\\" argument is only true if applied to an American feedlot and even then it is still specious (a damn lie) for two reasons. Here is the first reason: even those 2% of animals who get to spend a few weeks eating corn and millet in a Kansas feedlot, so that they wind up tasting better to us, still aren't eating human food. Pollan points out they are eating corn that humans can't eat and wouldn't want to eat. Therefore it is a damn lie that what the feedlot cow ate can have been equivalent to 8 times more food for the starving whomever. Now, the anti-meat group's rejoinder is going to be, \\"yeah, but the land that grows that non-human corn could have been used to grow real human food.\\" Not really. Anti-meat people, because of their bias, tend not to really undrestand much about agriculture as a science. Yes, some of that land used to produce corn to feed cows could be put into human food production; and I guarantee once the need for it is there it will be put into human food production. Farmers make a lot more money on human food than they do on animal feed (humans have more disposable income than cows). So again, the implication of the anti-meat crowd is that we lost 8 times the calories we could have had....not true. If we needed those calories then humans would have gotten them and the pro-meat crowd would have to eat veal rather than steak. Humans are going to get fed before cows do. But the real problem with the \\"that land could have grown human food\\" argument is that it is wrong. Those people, because they don't know even the basics about agriculture, conveniently leave out the need for a little thing called crop rotation. It means you don't keep planting the exact same crop over and over again in the same place. You have to rotate crops. Some of our major crops, such as millet, sorghum, and corn, are grown for reasons other than direct human consumption. That turns out to be handy because it means we can rotate crops and keep yields up year after year. Let me try to explain. I could plant wheat five times in a row, but my yields will fall if I do. If I rotate millet into the cycle then maybe I only grow wheat three years and millet one year and sunflower seeds one year during a five year cycle. However, I'll have as much wheat out of my farm as you will have on yours if you tried growing wheat five times in a row. So it turns out the the millet I feed to my dairy or beef cows didn't really cost the world any extra food, did it? Indeed, now I get to eat milk, cheese and ice cream, maybe even a steak once in a while....<br /><br />Most arguments about food production can be picked apart like I tried to do in the above. The arguments are created to support someone's idea of how they think things should be. They have an agenda, and then they seek facts to support their agenda. I don't have an agenda, but I do see that we have problems. An increasing world population, decreasing genetic variety, soil getting tired, erosion, lack of technology, experience, and inputs for Africa and much of the rest of the third world, depleting phospate reserves, depleting oil reserves, and inconstant weather are all going to be challenges as we go forward. I'd love to see a well-reasoned and rationally sound blueprint that, politics and agendas aside, considers how we are really going to feed 6 billion people now, 9 billion people in 30 years, and how to do it consistently for the next thousand years. This is the real question, and billions of people are relying on us to provide real solutions, ones that everyone can live with. This book unfortunately doesn't do that.r any country wants to be. Ergo, governments spend money on agriculture. Yes, sometimes they do stupid things, but food security can't be left to chance.

B00140PK6O|4.0|A wonderfully engaging translation of several of Mrs. Gaskell's novellas to the screen.  While the knitting together of the stories isn't as perfect as the the knitting of the residents of Cranford, it does very well.<br /><br />The central characters of the story, set in mid-nineteenth century England, are two spinster daughters of a clergyman, Dorothea and Mathilda Jenkyns (Miss Jenkyns and Miss Matty to you!)  Even though Miss Jenkyns is of a forceful nature (and beautifully portrayed by Eileen Atkins), it is dear shy Miss Matty  (Dame Judi Dench) who dominates events because of the respect everyone feels for her sweet nature. They and their neighbors must contend with the changes associated with the disconcerting transformation of rural Britain by the Industrial Revolution, as well as with the inherent challenges of life.  The ladies face poverty, death, servant problems, love, wandering cows, evil stepmothers, and questions of attire with aplomb, assisted by a few brave men:  the frank and winning Captain Brown; Mr. Morgan, the doctor, and Mr. Harrison, the doctor's new young partner, who has recently set the hearts of all the village maidens aflutter.  At a distance reigns the aging but elegant Lady Ludlow and her steward Mr. Carter, who must decide how to deal with a local poacher and his bright and capable young son, and how to pay the mortgage on the estate.<br /><br />This series is wonderfully acted and beautifully produced--really a living window on a vanished life.  Each character grows and develops, sometimes in unexpected ways--sometimes funny and sometimes poignant.  The most winning thing was the way in which, as much as they contended and struggled with each other at times, the ladies always faced real emergencies with utter kindness.<br /><br />Very, very enjoyable.
B0015D3Z4O|3.0|There's one thing you can count on with Madonna - there's new music always coming down the pipeline, and every CD is different.  This one isn't going to be one for the ages.     Overall, it's a decent album.  It's not anything revolutionary or an attempt to kick the industry in the behind, like \\"Confessions...\\" and \\"Ray of Light\\" were.  But it's different from the last, in style and tempo, so she's holding true to form.      \\"4 Minutes\\" didn't seem to get as much top 40 fanfare as I thought and that might have been a sign that the entire album isn't going to be well received.  \\"Give it to me\\" is the follow-up which hasn't had much, if any, airplay.      The album starts strong with a goodie in \\"Candyshop\\" which is followed by \\"4 minutes\\" which is still decent after 200 listens.  The first half of tracks are all very good.  It should have stopped at an EP.  The second half I would consider \\"filler songs\\" and just don't seem to be really good.      Overall, I guess it's average.  Some good, some bad.  Every Madonna listener has already bought it and is going to the next concert tour.  You just have to decide whether you can live with half an album or wait until the next one.
B000001GXB|5.0|This is clearly the gold standard for late Beethoven performances.  I saw Pollini play these pieces at Carnegie Hall in the late '70's and was absolutely overwhelmed.  After just having spent some considerable time with Papa Serkin's final effort on Opp. 109-111, gotta say, 'tain't but the One: and that One is Pollini.  For my money, it's a nearly perfect CD.
0316001821|5.0|The perspective of this book is original and the story is very compelling.  This is a great book for young adults and up the story get under your skin and makes you believe in the characters.  Dealing with such a serious topic the writing still finds room for wit and charm.  I highly recommend Lovley Bones.
0743298039|4.0|The Thirteenth Tale was a splendidly delicious story with a beginning, a middle, and an end, just like Vida Winter said.  It was an enthralling page turner.  There were intriguing and creepy characters and overall, I was captivated and enjoyed it immensely.  If you like reading to escape into a really good old fashioned (creepy) tale, this is the one!  The plot twists and turns kept me going throughout.  I will say, though, that I thought the side slight storyline of the co-joined twin of the biographer was weak, not so interesting, and didn't add to the novel overall.  Still, in all, I loved it and would recommend The Thirteenth Tale to anyone who loves to read for variety.
0440241030|4.0|. . . and if you knew me, you might be surprised.  I write novels about California, where people swim naked, have sex, and smoke a lot of pot.  Nothing like that happens in Lee Child's novels!  But these books are thrilling, fast-paced, intriguing.  And I must admit, I find them sort of sexy.  Yes, sexy.  The whole man without a country/family/homebase thing is the perfect escape from a life that's often made up of carpool lines, dishes and laundry.

All my workout partners use it often to review our exercises.<br /><br />But we also found a book that has the workouts planned out in simple charts. Has the weights, # of reps and everything. AND THEY WORK. I have lost over 12 lbs of fat in 3 months and spend less time in the Gym.<br /><br />The books.<br />Weight Training Workouts that Work by James Orvis.<br /><br />There are 3 books in the series and they have been great addition to Strength Training Anatomy.<br /><br />My recommendation -Start lifting weights - everyone/any age/right now! I am 41 and feel better than when I was 25!
B00003CX9E|5.0|Every movie lover should have this film in his/her library.  Especially interesting was the commentary by Roger Ebert.
B0012Q732O|4.0|I just love to tag the idiots who think they're so smooth panning a movie because they're above it all. Get a life! If you wrote a review you must have seen, or heard others comment. It was good, clean fun, not action packed idiocy throughout - some just don't get that. The film is reminiscent of Gibsons 'Apocalypto', not much acting, but a story line that wasn't lost in the telling, and an ending worthy of good fantasy - three and a half stars.
0689865384|4.0|I've looked at this book on the shelf for a long time and finally decided to buy it.  This was not one of my favorites nor would I read it a second time.  However, it was a page turner and I had serious trouble putting it down.  It's the usual theme, what's right and wrong.  Tally is a Uglie and she is forced through the course of the book to decide to go with the flow (become a Prettie) or take another path and become a Smokie.  The book is full of the meanings of self discovery and the paths we choose.  It takes place in a future very advanced, hoverboards, hovercars, operations to completly change you and heal to perfection within a weeks time, turning people into the ideal citizen, tracking your every movement down to the number of breaths you take.  It's a very good book.  I cannot wait to read the rest in this series.  However, I won't keep on my bookshelf for a second reading.
B000O78KW4|5.0|One of my few day shifts at the post office, so I was able to go! The theater was right across from the plant and I met my buddy, Danny, who got free promo tickets for opening night or my buddy Dave won them but could not show. I can not remember, but I think it is the latter. It was exciting going to a premier showing; they had draws, local celebrities, save the Jets campaign, etc. The movie was ok. Another typical action movie, but I like the water Jug part. I hope many of you can guess the mystery, my mathematically inclined friend did, and myself a little after the movie. Bruce Willis does not do the over the top annoying borderline jerk character, and I like the more realistic role.
B00140PK6O|5.0|A delightfully different period mini-series.  Judi Dench is great, as always and there are twists and turns, romance and tragedy in the town of Cranford where the women rule.
B0002S947K|5.0|That voice! It makes me think of some of the best, most soulful singers ever. Otis redding. Bobby Womack. Van Morrison. Stephen Stills. Not because Ray sounds like any of them, but because his voice just has that very special, warm sound that touches your soul. And he's a damn fine songwriter, too. Trouble, Shelter, All The Wild Horses, and Jolene (my favorite) are wonderful. This wasn't just a promising debut album, when it was released, it was a very convincing one. Ray got it right the first time around.
B001CT877Q|3.0|There's just something about Arnie movies that always grabs me, and makes me want to watch them. I've seen a few that definitely haven't been my favourites, and Eraser is one of them. I feel the more that I see films of Arnie's that I haven't seen before, the more I love the ones I've seen loads of times - Terminator, Twins, True Lies etc.<br /><br />The storyline is in no means OTT. It doesn't have the intriguing aspect of Total Recall for example. Arnie plays John Kruger, who specialises in 'erasing' people in the Witness Protection Programme. The film opens showing exactly how he does this, which is quite interesting.<br /><br />But then Vannessa Williams (Lee Cullen) comes into it, and really, she just didn't work. There was no chemistry between her and Arnie whatsoever. I don't particularly want them to start ripping each other's clothes off, but there was nothing between them at all. And in my opinion, it's always off-putting when that happens.<br /><br />The story then continues with John trying to keep Lee out of danger, and keep himself out of danger himself. There's one totally ridiculous scene, where John is hanging from a plane door, about to directly fall into the path of the plane engine, which just so happens to be on fire! His parachute then gets ripped off, and he has to free fall after it, and also has to worry about the plane preferably not crashing into him. It's a totally unbelievable scene, and definitely the highlight of the movie. But better done in Point Break I have to say. The alligator scenes also had me barely breathing, as they were amazing!<br /><br />I just don't think Eraser holds up with some of Arnie's other movies. The last movie I saw was Total Recall, and while I didn't understand it, and it left me racking what little brains I have, I still remember most of it. Eraser just comes across as a throw away movie, which is forgettable, and not that special up against his other movies.
B00006F7S4|5.0|I never really liked Beck's music prior to Sea Change. His music just didn't resonate with me. It may have been fairly creative and original, but it was seriously lacking in warmth. Too much style and too little substance. Lost Cause, the first single off the album, surprised me, since it was much more of a folky singer / songwriter type of song. So I took a chance and bought Sea Change - a good decision. It's a beautiful piece of work with tasteful production by Nigel Godrich (Air). I first bought it on cd and recently bought it on vinyl, too.
0061537934|5.0|I admit it... being a dog-lover (my wife and I own a 15 year old black lab mix and an 8 year old beagle mix) I was drawn in by the cover.  Since I was not familiar with Garth Stein's novels, I was not sure what to expect.  But, I found that this to be one of the most enjoyable books that I have read in quite some time.     Garth Stein has a nice fluid writing style and I was impressed with how well he portrayed the story through the mind of a dog.  I also found myself moved with how he used racing as a metaphor for navigating through challenges in life.  This book will stick with you long after you read it. It's been a couple of months now, and I still think fondly of Enzo.  The story was made more powerful for me personally knowing that our beloved lab is in the twilight of his life, but I would recommend the book even to people that don't own dogs.      After reading The Art of Racing in the Rain, I am looking forward to reading the author's other works.

Of course I'm probably gonna die of starvation anyway.  Bummer.
031606792X|3.0|I bought this book for my daughter, who is 18.  She has been a faithful, excited follower of the Twilight Saga.  She can't wait for the movie.      She was not very excited over this book.  She said that it really moves slowly.  She actually was content allowing her friends who had already read the book fill her in on what happened.    The series is undeniably a success.  I applaud the author.
B000002O7D|4.0|The \\"Cold War\\" was both exciting and at the same time full of many moments that were abbreviated (if allowed to run their course....WWIII).  The \\"Red October\\" movie was the last hurrah for cold war movies, and this is its score.  Unfortunately, this ed. mirrors the cold war in that it too is full of many exciting moments not allowed to run its course.    WHAT IT WAS ABOUT.  Sometime before the rise of Gorbachev and the end of the Cold War, the Russians launch The \\"Red October\\", a nuclear powered submarine that cannot be detected - it's magnetohydrodynamic powerplant allows it to slip past western technology, and it carries enough nuclear warheads to start and end WWIII.  Already nursing a grudge against the Soviet leadership, Red Navy Captain Ramius suspects his new command of being a \\"first strike weapon\\" and conspires with his handpicked crew to turn the super sub and its secrets over to the west.  To keep his crew from changing his mind, Ramius warns Moscow of his intentions, knowing that the Soviets will send their entire fleet after him.  Unbeknownst to him, an American analyst has also reasoned out his plan (the basics anyway) and flies off to save the Red October from both Soviet pursuers and Americans who are unconvinced that Ramius isn't simply a nut job planning to unleash nuclear armageddon.    If you've caught Poledouris's other work - \\"Conan\\", \\"Starship Troopers\\" or \\"Red Dawn\\", then you know that he's one of the unsung heroes of 80's movies.  What would the first \\"Conan\\" have been without \\"Riddle of Steel\\" or \\"Orphans of Doom\\" (the second \\"Conan\\" movie comes to mind, even though he did do that one too), and how would \\"Red Dawn\\" have risen above the 80's pack without great sounds like \\"Robert's End\\" and, of course, \\"Wolverines\\"?  The answer is that they probably wouldn't have.    If you enjoyed \\"Red October\\", you know that this is Poledouris in top form.  The problem is that this ed. captures only the highlights.  We get the opening \\"Hymn to the Red October\\" and \\"Ancestral Aid\\", but the tape has only a brief version of \\"Course Two-Five-Zero\\" and does not contain any version of the Soviet Martial Anthem sung by the ship's impromptu choir.  The tape's version of \\"Hymn\\" is pretty much identical to the one in the movie, but a superior version (sharper and with English vocals, not Russian) can be found on \\"Hollywood goes to War\\".  There are no end credits at all.    The tape offers complete versions of \\"Chopper\\" and \\"Two Wives\\".  \\"Chopper\\" was an unnecessary sequence of the film, and its inclusion here is one of the weakest points.    Two powerful sequences in the film - the moody movements that follow \\"Red October\\" and an American sub as they circle each other (\\"Crazy Ivan\\"), and an emotional choral that rises as Captain Konavelev sets off to hunt his former teacher - are completely absent.    That said, what is here is classic.  You'll sit through the first side without touching fast forward, and will measure FF on side 2 to get to the crown jewels: \\"Red Route 1\\" (Red October's mad dash through a submarine canyon using a stopwatch and really \\"hyper accurate charts\\") and \\"Kaboom\\" a sequence so powerful, it climaxes twice!  For a film that follows a silent ship, the \\"Red October\\" OST ends on a powerfully deafening note.    In short, it's Poledouris at his best, only not as much as one would hope.
B00117AXUS|1.0|Admittedly, I'm not a music expert.  But I know what I like, and this is not it.  It's about as ugly as music can get.  Didn't enjoy it at all.

0385340990|4.0|I really was not expecting to like this book (Eliz Gilbert blurbed it? Ew....) but a good friend was reading it and liking it and so I started it Labor Day weekend. When I started I thought, oh, its just another Helen Hanff type book, charming and light. It didn't take me long to realize it was much more than that. I didn't come up for air that next Monday, when I finished it. So yeah, I guess I liked it.<br /><br />I won't go into the synopsis, but suffice to say that not only did I laugh, and not only was I moved, but I learned a great deal about that time period. I did not know that the Nazis were in the Channel Islands, and as much as I have read and heard stories of the Nazis occupations, the stories of the occupants in this book were original, and yet very familiar. This a book about the inhumanity, hypocrisy and brutality of man, as well as the grace and dignity of people who have overcome it, and still care about their fellow man.  On a lighter note, I loved the romance - tho predictable, do well enough for me to want to shout Mazel Tov!  And while there are moments of twee (to which I am allergic) it was enough to show people being human, sincere, and honest.<br /><br />BTW, there really isn't a lot of book discussion going on here, tho many books are mentioned and quoted.  If you are expecting more you might be disappointed. I did have a quibble about the time span between some of the letters: a day between London and Guernsey? (and they weren't telegrams, as she noted those).  I could let that one stand and it didn't keep me from my enjoyment of the book. If the author had not added the dates to the letter, it probably would have been better.  The story, the characters, the setting was more than enough to keep me engaged and satisfied. The only thing that keeps it from being a five is that I reserve 5 stars for books that are outstanding and great literature themselves.<br /><br />I was looking foreward to more books by this author, but it seems she died before it was published. How very sad that there will be no more excellent reads like this one, but oh, what a gem she left behind for the rest of the world!.

B000ANVQ0K|5.0|I admit... I've watched the film TITANIC three times in the theater and hunted city after city for the TITANIC soundtrack for that one Celine Dion song.<br /><br />  Afterall, this movie was hyped as a mega blockbuster that would later become a winner of 11 Academy Awards including Best Picture.<br /><br />  I also waited in line with almost a hundred other fans to get the VHS release but when the first DVD release came out,  I didn't buy it.<br /><br />  I was a bit dismayed by the lack of special features and the fact that the film was divided into two discs.<br /><br />  Knowing that popular DVD's tend to be re-released in different incarnations with a \\"deluxe this\\" or \\"premium that\\" , TITANIC has finally returned as a Special Collectior's Edition.<br /><br />  The Special Collector's Edition does not disappoint as it is loaded with over 3 hours of special features.<br /><br />  Included in this special version are cast and crew commentaries by director James Cameron, Kate Winslet, Gloria Stuart, Lewis Abernathy, Jon Landau and Rae Sanchini.  Historical commentary by Doon Lynch and Ken Marschall.<br /><br />  To my disappointment, the movie again is split up into two discs  Thus you will need to get up from your seat to change the DVD when you get close to the two hour mark.<br /><br />  But fortunately, DVD space is utiltized well  with the inclusion of branching technology, so when ever you want to know how certain scenes were made, you have an option to watch the behind-the-scenes featurettes while watching the movie.<br /><br />  The DVD looks great and audiophiles should be pleased to learn that Dolby Digital 5.1 ES and also 6.1 DTS ES is available.<br /><br />  Disc 2 includes the alternate ending titled \\"Brock's Epiphany\\" which is based on the original script.  Which I'm glad that Jim Cameron edited out of the final verison.  Also, included on this disc is the music video of Celine Dion's \\"My Heart Will Go On\\".  But I'm a bit surprised how dated the music video looks.<br /><br />  On Disc 3, this disc features all the TITANIC goodies with 45 minutes of never-before-seen deleted scenes with optional commentary.  This was actually very interesting to watch and listen to why James Cameron removed those scenes.  Included also was the FOX special \\"Breaking New Ground\\", press kit featurettes, 1912 newsreel which was more of taking footage of the actors in costume and making it look like footage from 1912.<br /><br />Construction timelapse, deep dive presentation, video matics, video effects breakdowns, still galleries and so much more.<br /><br />  In closing, I admit that I was originally dismayed that the movie was split into two disc's but with the addition of the behind-the-scene brancing featurettes with the film,  I can understand why.<br /><br />  The number of TITANIC footage on this Special Collector's Edition is simply amazing.<br /><br />  If you are a big fan of this TITANIC film, this DVD Special Collector's Edition is definitely a must-buy!disc features all the TITANIC goodies with 45 minutes of never-before-seen deleted scenes with optional commentary.

B000YDOOUK|5.0|Airbourne Rocks! Yes, they do sound like AC/DC, but are they trying to copy AC/DC...no. The reviewer that gave them a 1 better hide before I find him and give him an embarassing slap to the face in front of his mom.    The songs are simple and fun, they're loud, and they're catchy as hell. I also thought it was refreshing that all the songs are distinctly different and all of them have great choruses...you can't help but scream along. Buy it!
B000HKWCOA|5.0|I have watched all of Enterprise and it is easily the best Star Trek series since the original.  Yes, even better Next Generation, which was less than perfect for me.  And far better than DS9 and Voyager which were mixed bags, with less than compelling and irritating characters, and repetitive story lines.  Enterprise drags a little in season 3 but picks up again for the final season.
B000089RV6|5.0|The single, \\"Shook me all night long,\\" was what got me hooked on AC/DC.  The groove, the sound, even the odd-ball vocals had me paying attention.    This album is hands down a rival for their best work.  It's energetic, entertaining, and sounds good at any volume.  Sure, it's \\"meat and potatoes\\" rock, but it doesn't need anything fancy.    Kick back, crank it up, and enjoy!

B000AARKW6|4.0|CARLITO'S WAY (1993) has the same feel of having been created by a genius,   and perhaps is  Brian de Palma's answer to  Francis Ford Coppola's work,  ONE FROM THE HEART, 10 years after the fact. Many aspects appeal to the crowd,  ranging from  the  powerful story, the nostalgia,  the sensual and sentimental spects  to action and ruthless underworld scenes.     There are many parallels, one being the excellent wide-screen filming quality and the   script itself, wherein a gangster reviews his past life  in the ghetto, dealing narcotics and surviving  the violence of the streets,  and  builds a continuity to that as he's released from his  penal term, and juggles various tasks, such as   staying out of the grasp of law enforcement,   staying alive in face of deadly rivals  all intertwined with various lush and spectacular settings,   such as night clubs showcasing charismatic  girls (strippers, waitresses), in between gambling,   and memorable other scenes (sunsets, etc.)    The film is boosted by  Penelope Ann Miller, whose presence alone in  the picture works wonders,  as she interacts with Carlito ( Al Pacino) and plays a sensual, adventurous yet vulnerable young  woman who  is skilled in creating the illusion of love   on st his hard edged, natural  personality from his gangster days, with a humanity and personal longing for romance.    The music ( Latino rhythms and 70's dance  classics) , coupled with  the staff  and the way the club  scene is laid out,  draws the audience into the action from the realism of all those aspects,  if not  for the importance given to the cash flows generated by the actual night club, managed by Carlito.     Sean Penn is perhaps at his best as an actor, playing a substance addicted attorney   with a high risk clientele operating in the underworld (weapons, rubouts, substance trafficking,  gangsterism, gambling, money laundering, etc,  who lacks scruples in the way he conducts his   legal assistance operations, at the same time beingsuccessful in getting an acquittal for his clients.    The strength of the script is its attention to detail, such as a  well rooted street knowledge, and vocabulary, bringing into focus old territory rivalries of Latinos, Italian-Americans, Porto Ricans, Black Harlem, the stigma of stool pigeons, the double cross, the drug burn, and more. Clearly, in that world,  lives are a second thought  when dealt with by simpletons on the street. Another essential ingredient,   the confidential informant  carrying a wire  hired to get information from Pacino for FBI and DA, through privileged access as a childhood friend, is very real.    Effort is made to show the challenge of one balancing one's own  cultural identity, origins and job  with convincing a girl  to build a life together who has a different lifestyle and track record.    The story articulates quite well the emotional impact of a con being released from the Big HOuse  after a 5 year term, comparing street life before and after the term and the counseling received as a con.    The repercussions of embezzlement  ( the guns and lime pit waiting and ready, and contract) is not ambiguous as the victims tend to want to do justice by their own hands.    At the end of the day, Carlito (despite his upbringing), still  is in disbelief on how ready some people are to double-cross their  intimate friends, for profit,  despite all  perceived bonds of love, loyalty, friendship and  trust ( rare commodities indeed.) \\"Saving your own skin\\" is the lesson, and he sees that  the more things change, the most they stay the same.    The movie has a great action and  suspense finale, with a perhaps too predictable guy- tries- to- get- the girl outcome and live happily-ever-after.

0553212419|1.0|The text is so small a normal human being can't read it. I was so excited to get this book and the text was so small. I tried to read it but was getting headaches and serious eyestrain. Why are these publishers so cheap? Why not have legible text? Why do they print these classics too small to read? No wonder kids hate reading these classics. I search high and low for text that big enough to read comfortably. I'm a young guy and there is nothing more frustrating than small mouse sized text.    I'd pay a dollar or two more for legible text... but it's way too small to read... and the whole point of a book is to \\"READ\\" it. It's like making a car with no windows... or a tiny little one inch windshield. It's silly... BIGGER PRINT, BIGGER PRINT, BIGGER PRINT (CHANT) ON CLASSIC BOOKS!!!!
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Wall*E - the new animated movie from those genuises at Pixar - you had me at hello. Seriously, from the first moment I saw a trailer for this, I knew my family & I had to see it. This is an EXCELLENT movie in every single way. Wonderfully positive messages for all of us are laced throughout the movie, which is something I greatly value in these types of movies, plus it's just a fantastic movie to watch for entertainment purposes.<br /><br />This movie has so much heart, I still feel Wall*E's hold on my heartstrings, I think it's permanent, and that is lovely. It is an interesting & topical story to start off with, a clear message on our environmental footprint and what the future could hold should our behaviors go unchecked. It is also a wonderful comment on respect and reverence for 'life' in all its myriad of forms, of working together, of love & companionship, of personal courage and standing up for what you believe in, no matter the odds stacked against you. I think, for me, its most powerful message is one that is echoed in other great stories (such as Lord of the Rings, for example) - that no one is too small, too \\"insignificant\\", to make a great impact on all of our lives. There is great power for positive change in the unlikeliest of beings.<br /><br />Funny, sweet, touching, exciting, memorable. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!<br /><br />I will love Wall*E forever :)<br /><br />Rai Aren
B00000J2PH|5.0|Tapestry is one of the great pop albums of all time. But \\"pop\\" does not define what Tapestry is. Carole King wrote songs with a musical sense that belongs to the great songwriters of all time, from the classical songs of Schubert, great church hymns, Stephen Foster, Gershwin, and of course the best contemporary song-writing.    The point is that Carole King wrote great songs that defy easy categories. I hate the labels: country, rock, pop, adult easy listening,.... blah blah. Hey, a good song is a good song and can probably be done in any number of styles, from country to jazz. And all of those styles are American, now, anyway, duh...    And Carole King put a bunch of great songs on Tapestry and sang them with a big heart that makes you believe every word she is singing. So cry, laugh and enjoy this American Song treasure that will last well beyond the time we are all gone. Make sure your children hear Tapestry: an education in great music, a heartfelt slice of life as we really feel it.    Jim Finn
0783240287|5.0|This retelling of \\"The Coat of Many Colors\\" is a fanasty full of delighful music.  Set as a grade-school production, the staff of the school is featured in the various roles with the gym's stage morphing and flowing into the Pinewood 007 Studios, where the bulk of the film was shot.  Donny Osmond shows his skills in the title role, travelling from a happy boyhood in Cannan, to a tearful and scary Egyptian jail, and finally to the side of Ramses' throne as a noble Prince. The 40 year old actor is believable as both an 18 year old youth and the older, mature royal advisor.  Maria Friedman has too much fun as the Narrator. She strolls through the desert, dances with the brothers, and sips drinks in the shadow of the Sphinx. Her bouncy step and emotional face change for each number to support Joseph/Don in his plights.    With musical themes from the Roaring 20's, the Rocking 50's, the Mod 60's, the Soulful French Canteens, and the American WildWest Saloons, this movie deserves the large box of popcorn. You won't want to have to miss a thing!
B000001FI7|5.0|\\"Trip-hop\\"? \\"Downtempo\\"? Although it is a dark record, between Beth Gibbons' tortured voice, Geoff Barrows' beats, scratches and samples, and Adrian Utleys' jazzy guitar: this album is pure sex.    Don't believe me? Try it.
B0017ZB8M6|4.0|Noisiy guitar riffs, loud vocals, risky lyrics and cheesy slow ballads made this album just perfect for lost teenagers who are looking for a new Avril Lavinge to follow.<br /><br />Apart from a few good ones, including of course the hit singles, there's not really much new on this \\"Pink-meets-Avril Lavinge-wannabe-Alanis Morisette\\" experiment.<br /><br />The good ones are really good and the other ones, well, are just not much relevant... Probably, rather than releasing full album, a Maxi-EP would have been better enough as one can feel how some of the cuts are in here just for filling.<br /><br />Good, but not much more of it.

B0013FXWU6|4.0|The central character in \\"There Will Be Blood\\", oil tycoon Daniel Plainview (played by thoroughbred thespian Daniel Day-Lewis) is a fascinatingly repugnant character. He's greedy, ruthless, cruel, and shamelessly manipulative, to be sure ... but it's really the touch of humanity he occasionally displays that truly makes him tragic, because you can see that beneath all his contempt is a sad, broken-hearted man. Although capable of affection, whenever Daniel feels abandoned or betrayed he reacts viciously and often violently, destroying any possibility of authentic relationships.<br /><br />Throughout the movie his character's fate is tied to that of Eli Sunday, a theatrical minister who, despite superficial differences, is as ruthlessly ambitious as Plainview is. Sunday is Plainview's nemesis and mirror ... their mutual hatred is due to the fact that they surely see all of their own loathsome qualities reflected in the other. Throughout the film the two characters spar, compete, play mind games and torture each other.<br /><br />Although the film ends with a final confrontation between the two characters in which one apparently \\"wins\\", powerhouse director P.T. Anderson makes it clear that there are no real winners in this film, just empty characters who sold their souls to the devil long ago. \\"There Will Be Blood\\" is an indictment of human nature, the destructiveness of anger and greed, and the American Dream gone horrible awry.

But, from the poor, new choices like RONIN and SUPERMAN: FOR TOMORROW, to this Absolute TRAVESTY of an Absolute edition...I am very worried as to the future of this collection.  DC should refund everyone who bought this edition, and apologize on top of it.  The only explanation I can muster in the face of DC's silence, is that they are angry that Moore has taken the League to his friends at Top Shelf.

0765356139|1.0|I'm not sure I read the same book as what all these glowing reviewers are discussing. It's a little like the Emperor's New Clothes. I found this book less exciting than the first one in the series which was a yawner to begin with.  Cardboard characters and sterotypical situations.  There was nothing new, it was all a melange of other fantasy novels.  As someone who loved the first three volumes of Jordan but grew increasingly bored with the constant sequels that added nothing to the storyline, I guess Sanderson is a worthy pick to finish off The Wheel of Time.     Joe Abercrombie makes this guy look like a piker.

It had the infamous \\"People = S***\\", which was a fun song and was excellent to listen to, as it had the Death Metal feel and just rips your head off and shoves it up your arse the moment it begins. Seeing as Vol. [[ASIN:0634086537 Slipknot - Vol. 3 (The Subliminal Verses)]] had no swearing on it, it still has is their best. And here, Slipknot has put out a Volume 4. Don't worry guys, Slipknot hasn't changed. They are still THE SAME BAND. Aside from the fact that there's a ballad on here (which isn't a bad thing, it's a good track), There isn't anything new here. It just feels like an album of outtakes really. But there are some excellent tracks on here for sure. The opening number, .execute., is a hard-hitting song that rocks for sure. Sulfur is a ballad which is beautiful and has good vocals. But what songs could the album have done without? Well, Vendetta and Butcher's Hook, which sort of feel just thrown in to fill the space. There are couple other ones, but overall, this is an OK CD, and the ending track is to this album what \\"To Tame a Land\\" is to Iron Maiden's [[ASIN:B000063DFQ Piece of Mind]]. Still worth a listen.
0393035158|3.0|\\"Harris pointedly asks us to consider that those who do not fear death for themselves, and who also revere ancient scriptures instructing them to mete it out generously to others, may soon have these weapons in their own hands.\\"    So I wonder if Harris is in favor of a pre-emptive military strike on Iran?  If so, then he's just like the fanatical Christian George W. Bush.  I hope his faith in reason offers some realistic ideas on how to deal with people whose faith is in God.
0930289234|3.0|I'm not sure but I think this book is a little over-hyped.<br />I collected comics for a while and this series came out when I did, as individual issues. Even then this series got incredible critical acclaim. I never collected them but through the years I've always wanted to read this book. So when I saw the preview for the film I thought now is the time so the movie doesn't ruin it for me.<br />Perhaps it was the hype back in the day or the hype on this site and others or the hype on the book jacket itself.<br />\\"One of Time Magazine's 100 Best English-Language Novels since 1923\\"<br />That's a lot of hype.<br />I just don't think it lives up to it.<br />In any way.<br />Or perhaps it did live up to it when it was first released and just hasn't aged that well.<br />Either way it is interesting enough to check it out but if I had a do-over I would borrow it or buy it used.<br />I know this won't go down well with the devout but their reviews are much too biased to be taken seriously.<br />P.S. I thought V for Vendetta was better.
0131479415|4.0|This book has all the information needed for start working and refining scrum estimation.  The only complain I have is the chapter over deciding between story points and ideal days, you should skip it(just use story points) and everything else is very valuable.
0060977493|5.0|I read this book as a literature student in college and it is still one of my favorite books of all time.  Her words read like poetry.  It literally took my breath away in its beauty and message.  Highly recommended for those who enjoy reading about the effects of globalization on so-called Third World countries, as well as those who appreciate a good romantic novel in the magical realist tradition.

B0000DZ3EN|4.0|Return to Oz is a film I watched when I was a child and even this fantasy gave me the willies, but I couldn't help but enjoy this bizarre child-like adventure. So much darker than the Wizard of Oz starring Judy Garland, Return to Oz stars Fairuza Balk who in some ways is more connivincing as Dorothy Gale. The good and evil characters are pretty scary, so probably this film should not be viewed by children under the age of 8. There is this one scene that still sticks out for me, where all the mannequin heads come to life, creepy as can be!!! Gotta give this '80s classic a viewing, it will trip you out, enjoy!

B001ACY8D2|4.0|This is my first try with a foreign language CD.  Sigur Ros is a great band from Iceland and their beautiful melodies are wonderful to listen to.  I know that American music is popular all over the world, now I know what it feels like to get into the sound of a band, even if you do not understand the language they are singing in. It is very different, a very interesting sound.
0920668364|1.0|I have lots and lots of childrens books but this one is by far the worst. Its a good concept, but the illustration and story of the concept that parents too get old and need care is horrendous. How about easing the little ones into the reality of life?
B000QQFKYE|5.0|Firt off, I need to say that I would never insult or ridicule anyone for liking or disliking this or any other film, nor would I put anyone down for not understanding a film(especially one such as this).However, to insist that this film means \\"Nothing\\" would seriously make me doubt your cognitive abilities.You can dislike a film, not understand it, even dislike it BECAUSE you didn't understand it, but you should at the very least be able to recognize and admit that repeating symbolism, imagery, and themes JUST MIGHT mean \\"Something\\" despite your inability to grasp it.\\"I don't get it therefore it can't mean anything\\" is really quite infantile.  Now, as for the film itself, it's really quite difficult to describe the plot more concisely than the review and product description on the site.But suffice it to say, If you're a Lynch fan there is no reason you shouldn't love this film.However, I can see how the average non-Lynch fan might get a bit frustrated with this.This is a three hour cinematic delirium dream, filled with all things bizarre,intense and disturbing.This demands your full attention and is sure to engage the intellect and emotions, ultimately leaving you exhausted on both those fronts.At least it did me.This flick blew me away.I watched nearly all three hours of this with my brow knit,my jaw slack, and my hand over my mouth, my mind working doubletime to piece this awesome puzzle together.As exhausting as it was, it made the payoff at the end that much more intense and rewarding.  Now I'm in no way saying that I understood this movie completely, or even mostly, but complete intellectual understanding isn't necessary to connect with a movie like this on an intuitive and emotional level.  This is definitely a movie in need of repeat watchings and definitely worthy of them. David Lynch has produced a challenging movie worthy of the word \\"Epic\\". I wish I had dreams this haunting.
B0015AARJI|3.0|ok so luckily i got this controller cheap because after playing with the sixaxis for so long it feels like im using a log as a controller when using a dualshock 3,i mean seriously?this thing weights more then a dualshock 2,i dont know about you guys but the vibrations just not worth all that weight to me,plus the vibration takes a pretty big cut from the battery life,my plain six axis still lasts days longer then the dualshock 3 and its almost a year older
B001AJVR5M|5.0|I have this CD. I purchased it for my 6 year old daughter and I have been very surprised.  I have caught myself singing to it and continuing to play it in the car even when she is not with me. I love it, it is clean cut, great sound, a bit of a harder edge than their previous CD. I really like it, you can move to it.  This coming from someone who is 39 but no one would ever guess and whom loves to dance.  I can't say enough about these brothers and how humble they are and how good they sound.      Sincerely,  Kim M.
0881425591|5.0|I won't repeat the 700+ reviews for this book, but I do have some comments on the many 1 Star Reviews.    I went through and couldn't believe all the one stars that were given to this book. Yes, it is about Rabbits. No, it is not a children's book. Yes, it does give detail descriptions about everything. These are things that make it GOOD. I read this book when I was in 7th grade (on purpose) and I loved every minute of it. The world that Richard Adams has created is one of masterful work. Maybe it's because my IQ is not below 75 that I love it. If you want just the story, watch the movie. If you want to read one of the greatest things in print today, get the book. Or if you hate reading, get the audiotape even and listen in the car. Trust me, if you go in with no prejudice, you will love Watership Down.
0385340990|4.0|At first glance I passed on reading this book until people began to rave about it. I think it was the title that made me think it might be silly; I'm glad I gave it a try. I loved the book but I do think it is the type of book that would not appeal to most men. I found this epistolary novel to be charming and sweet. It had me grabbing for the post it notes to jot down a passage or two along the way.<br /><br />The novel unfolds in 1946 London. A writer Juliet Ashton is looking for her next project after the war. Juliet lost her home and her possessions which included a cherished book collection. Out of the blue, she receives a letter from a resident of Guernsey, named Dawsey Adams. Dawsey tells her that he owns a book by Charles Lamb that once belonged to Juliet. Although she is intrigued by this, it is his comments about a roast pig bringing about the start of The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society that makes her want to learn more. Juliet begins to correspondence with the society's members, learning about their island, their love of literature, and the impact the war has had on their lives. Captivated by their stories, she sets sail for Guernsey, an unforgettable island, and what she finds changes her forever.<br /><br />I was touched by the charming inhabitants of this unforgettable island who turned to literature in terrible times. Animal lovers beware there are a few references in the book which really upset me. Despite this, I am still happy that I read this book.
0345495004|5.0|I devoured this book.  The prose is gorgeous.  The story is both controversial and thought provoking.  Even by today's standards, it is a story that will have many wagging their tongues.  Yet, I came to sympathize and care deeply about the main characters, even if I didn't always agree with the decisions they made. It provoked me to think about women's roles and choices, and how far we've come. After finishing the novel, I felt touched, wiser, and fulfilled having read it. It is now one of my all time favorite books.
B000063DI9|5.0|Iron Maiden is almost unique among \\"New Wave Of British Heavy Metal\\" bands of their era in being able to reinvent themselves repeatedly while still maintaining the essential elements that gave their sound an identity to begin with. It is easy to grow bored with the continual assertions by narrow minded \\"fans\\" that they \\"sold-out\\" with this record, or went soft and became \\"prog\\". No, for that listen to everything Queensryche did after Empire (and up until Operation Mindcrime II). Seventh Son is a creative, storytelling concept album that demonstrates a high point for Maiden in writing, production, and musicianship. They embraced technology, synth sounds, and polished professional production, without losing the energy and power that makes all of their \\"classic\\" era albums great. Do you like 'Maiden, or NWOBHM, or both? Get this one. Don't like 'Maiden, then skip it, and stop trying to convince everyone else it's a poor record or a mis-step because YOU don't get it.
B0013N3DSE|5.0|O.k, o.k, I know that some out there are probably saying, Errol Flynn has nothing on Kevin Costner, but I disagree. Errol Flynn, is the best Robin Hood there is. However, I not too keen on the up beat music in this film. It sometime's sounds childish, but no matter what you might think about it, it will always be a timeless classic. I would recommend this to anyone who loves Robin Hood. No matter how cheessey it may be, it's still one of the best. It's fun, entertaining, and very adventureous. Plus, it has a Bugs and Daffy short of Robin Hood that you'll share with your kids. Not to forget some extra bouns material as well. Five Stars for this one.
031606792X|5.0|It was obvious from the beginning of the novel that the central theme would be mother and child, so of course Bella got pregnant.  While it was an admittedly slow beginning, Bella proved herself a remarkable vampire.  It was a welcome change for her to be the protector of the ones she loved for once rather than the hapless victim.  We got to meet new vampires with new special skills, we saw the flaws in the Valturi; how they were defeated not by brute force, but by out maneuvering on Bella's part.  She proves finally to be an unbeatable, viable asset.  Jacob reached his happy end by imprinting on Nessie, Jacob and Edward at last made peace, and I once again most reiterate that Bella made her preview as vampire extraordinaire.   Again, I loved that Bella had the chance to be the ultimate protector of her new vampire family, and for once, not the helpless victim.  The Valturi met their match, Charlie remained an integral part of their lives, and the werewolves(shape shifters)found peaceful existence among their sworn enemies.  Could Seth Clearwater be more endearing??  All in all, I truly could have not asked for anything more, and count myself lucky that Meyer concluded with such an open-ended finale that can easily be expanded upon.  While Renesmee is indeed a silly name, it was a slight annoyance within a wonderful novel.  My only complaint was lack of Alice within the book.  My advice to you, is don't listen to the stinky complaints others have to offer; come in with no expectations, and enjoy the book for what it is: a tidy and apropos ending.  To me, Bella finally came into her own as an active, strong, and incredible character.  I can only assume the dissuaders were longing for more Bella whining and more Edward rescue, ie more of the same.  In this case, the same old character roles are not missed; rather change is welcome in this at time slow moving, but albeit wonderful conclusion to an extraordinary series.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|This is the story of an East German Stasi officer sent to tape record the activities of a man so that he can be eliminated from the picture so that a higher party official can get his hands on the man's girlfriend.<br /><br />However, thanks to the presence of the East German cinema's late Ulrich Muhe (who was himself followed by the Stasi) this movie is so much, much more.  As the film progresses we watch as the dutiful Muhe receives his charge, begins to carry it out and becomes both disenchanted and ultimately noncooperative in the process.<br /><br />To my eye, it would seem that in reality anyone with the gravitas that Muhe had wouldn't have been able to function as a Stasi officer in the first place.  But movies are wonderful places where you suspend your disbeliefs along with your diet, eat the buttered popcorn and settle in to the movies alternate reality.<br /><br />Like Run, Lola, Run and Goodbye Lenin, this is another extraordinary product of a German cinema that's finally ready to move on and make movies about events that occured after 1945 as well as those that occured before.
031606792X|5.0|This was a great read. I couldn't put it down. Although I wanted to story to go on, the author was right when she said that all good stories must come to an end. I give it an A+!
B000TLMWMY|5.0|This is a stunning collection.  Eighty five-star reviews out of about ninety reviews... that says it all.  So does the list of artists and songs.  I bought the sampler DVD at Positively Records outside Philly and decided to trade up to the 2-DVD version within hours of my purchase.      I really hope that a Volume Two is in the works.  As a long-time Everly Brothers fan, I also hope that a DVD compilation of The Everly Brothers Show (Johnny's summer replacement series) is forthcoming.  They had an equally impressive list of guests and, similarly, had many unique pairings of artists.
B000WO251Q|5.0|This book gives you a look at real love. Whether you have it, had it and lost it, or never had it.... you will love this book. Its slight humor and major romance is great for anyone who loves to get lost in a great romance book. I have read it over and over.... still cry!!!
B000EYK4KI|1.0|I love love love this movie so I bought the \\"unrated\\" disc as I thought it would give me some interesting insight into the actors and the film, etc. I was so sadly disappointed! If you put the director's commentary on as your watching the film, you will literally fall asleep, he is so incredibly boring.  I thought directors are great storytellers, but man, is he a drip! I could not sit through it!! Doesn't anybody look at this stuff before it's sold to the masses?!? So I turned the commentary off and watched the same dvd I could've rented from netflix.  Not fair for 20 bucks!
B000WGWQG8|5.0|This was an outstanding historical production.  The detail was amazing. The look into the personality and character of one of our major Founding Fathers was fascinating.  My only question was to the accuracy of the two references to the \\"White House\\" in episode #7.  The year would have been in the very early 1800's.  Not having read the book yet, it is possible that McCullough explains, but it is hard for me to believe that the now popular, even official name, of the President's home could have been used at that early time.  Theodore Roosevelt first put the White House name on the official stationary of the mansion but that was after 1901.  Adams was the first president to live there and although it was a white house, I don't think anyone was calling it that at that early date.  A minor point in an otherwise riveting chronical.  It may appeal to serious students of history more than the casual, especially in the middle few episodes.  However, I would have to say that it is worthy of every one of the 23 Emmies that it has been nominated for.  I was also impressed by the fact that there were few priveleged people of leisure in those days.  Adams had a large estate and grounds.  He, Abigail and their family were constantly laboring at Peacefield to keep up the estate and to make a living.  For a man to live to the age of 90 in those days was an amazing accomplishment considering that the average life span was decades shorter than that.  The other three presidents that lived to 90 or more were all in the 20th century.
B0014DBZT2|4.0|This is CD is much better than I expected and an absolute surprise to me. I am big Nick Cave fan and loved his ballad CD's (Boatman's Call / No more shall we part / Nocturama) and the Pop inbetween (Abottoir Blues). I was a little afraid that after Grinderman he would try to get back to his roots of The Birthday Party trying to get the punk back. But no. Instead the CD is very much like \\"The Good son\\" and contains great ballads, fun songs and pretty much of everything. Very catchy and I can't stop listening. Only four stars because of 1-2 fillers.    Great CD!
B001DRF84W|5.0|I think a lot of people get caught up in the popular opinion and write off this movie as a bad movie.  If you actually watch it, I think Ang Lee did an excellent job, and in my opinion, it is better than the newer Incredible Hulk movie.  A lot more thought was put into the plot, the \\"comic book\\" style cinematography was really cool to watch, and I even preferred the action sequences in the desert with the Apache helicopters, jets, and tanks versus the action sequences in the newer movie.  Yeah, the dog fight scene was a little weird (especially when they \\"poof\\" after he defeats them), but it was still a surprisingly savage and raw fight scene.  Plus, Nick Nolte was awesome as Bruce's insane dad, and I definitely liked Sam Elliot and Jennifer Connelly over William Hurt and Liv Tyler.  The acting wasn't bad in the new movie, but the script just didn't give them much of a chance to act.  Anyway, I'm excited about this coming to Bluray, and I think it's an excellent pickup for any true Hulk fan that is willing to think a little and enjoy a well-crafted movie.

B0007Y89ZM|5.0|Wow! what kick to see them reform and work to get back to their great sound. The band gets better as they get into it. I love the guitar playing from both Dan Felder and Joe Walsh.  This is a must have for all Eagles fans.
0930289234|5.0|After seeing a preview for the movie adaptation for this comic i decided to look into it's origins. As my title says it makes me giggle but not because it's crappy just because the dialoge is great! nice grafics to look at as well. I haven't read the whole thing yet (let a buddy borrow it for a little bit; faster reader than i) but I can't wait. Was worth the money.
031606792X|3.0|OK, so...    I'm not a rabid die-hard fan of the series.  I picked up Twilight, enjoyed it, and picked up the remaining books.  I don't particularly hate the series, either.  Three stars.    I thought the writing was pretty good.  I wasn't thrilled with the shift in narrative, but it worked.  I got to know the characters a bit better, and that's always a good thing.  Since it's a book geared at teens, I felt that certain scenes were written appropriately for that age group.  It flowed well and there were times when I was engrossed.  BUT...    There really is a heavy \\"ick\\" factor on certain plot points.  Jake imprinting an infant was just foul in my mind.  Sorry, but I am not budging on that feeling at all.  Between the fact that it was a child (ewww) AND Bella's child by another man (double ewww), I simply do not support that plot twist.      Moving on.  It felt like we got too much at once.  Marriage, sex, a baby, and oh yeah, you become a vampire, in 600 pages.  There were times when I felt as though the author just went a bit overboard on the reader by throwing all of that out in one book.  Yes, anyone with a brain could figure out what was going to happen eventually, but it feels like it should have been a bit spread out (and without the baby).  But the new vamps, great characters.  Loved the Volturi.  And the extra wolves.  Really good, relevant characters with compelling stories I look forward to reading more about.      I know a lot of people have complained about Bella as a character.  She's a relatively typical teenager, hate to say.  She has her moments of selfishness, and her moments of stepping outside of herself and understanding what her decisions mean to other people, but she is still a child, and thinks as such. For better or worse.  Edward never struck me as overly dominating, but I would expect him to be a bit arrogant since he *is* immortal and pretty much invulnerable.  I would be, too!  Young forever, and born in a time with a much different setof values which weren't completely trashed upon becoming a vampire.  I would have like this to be explored a bit more instead of jumping into the preggers plot.        And one last thing... there were times when I wondered if the author had ever read an \\"Anita Blake\\" novel.  There were times when I felt like I was reading a different author!  Vampires, werecreatures and our poor heroine!  Uhm, it *has* been done.      Overall, it was an average book.
031606792X|4.0|Another great book from Stephanie Meyer! It is pretty intense from the very start of the book all the way to the end. I love her \\"action\\" scenes at the Climax of her books. This one was awesome. I felt like she tied up all loose ends and I was happy with the direction in which she took the plot. Only one concern...this book probably should be in the Adult category rather than the Young Adult category. I feel it is geared to a more mature audience, or should be at least. There are sexual references(but milder and in better taste than most PG-13 movies these days, at least Bella & Edward are married!)and there is some mild Language.
B001CD6FKI|5.0|Okay, I'm just going to go ahead and say this -- I enjoy a good epileptic experience every now and then, and this was about the best film out there to fulfill that urge.    That aside, it was a ton of fun in other ways as well. It really hit that nostalgic sweet spot, while still being new and fresh.    You have to keep in mind that it's basically a kid's movie, so you can't expect it to be too serious, deep, or realistic. It's meant to be thrilling, colorful, and even inspiring in some ways, and in my opinion, it achieves those ideals quite well.

B00177Y9ZC|2.0|***CONTAINS SPOILERS***<br /><br />Anakin Skywalker battles the forces of evil by using the force and ...Oh. Wait a minute. Wrong movie. Sorry `bout that. Well not truly sorry; just a tad peeved at this flick and how horribly it went astray.<br /><br />It is true, however, that the grim Hayden Christiansen of the new [[ASIN:B00006HBUJ Star Wars]] fame is the main character (David Rice), and he has some unique abilities: he can jump through space/time at will, breakfasting on top of the Sphinx in Egypt, jumping back to his New York flat for luncheon pizza, then heading out to surf in Hawaii that same day ...or even hour if he wished it. He learns he has this power during his high school years (the young David is played by Max Thieriot - see [[ASIN:B00005JPLE The Astronaut Farmer]]) and nearly dies after falling through some thin river ice. He miraculously reappears in a local library, water and all, soaking book stacks. David was trying to retrieve a gift from the ice that he'd gotten for a girl he liked named Millie (Rachel Bilson), but he quickly learns that his jumping abilities make him something of a freak, and believes Millie would see him that way too. So he runs away and into the world.<br /><br />Once out amongst the populace he learns how to steal, including jumping into bank vaults and taking as much money as he will. But this also gains him notice by a secret society of men known as Paladins (look up Palatine and you'll find interesting parallels). The head of this religious order is a man named Roland (Samuel L. Jackson, [[ASIN:B000JBXHQY Snakes on a Plane]]), and his goal is to kill Jumpers (\\"No one but God should have these powers!\\")<br /><br />So the battle between Jumper and Paladin is set and interesting shots and gadgets dot the screen. And that's about it...<br /><br />The biggest flaw with the film is that there's no set-up to it. We don't really know why Jumpers can do what they do (Genetic/[[ASIN:B000HEVZ9E X-Men]]-like mutation? Alien DNA? Gods?). We also don't know who funds the Paladins with all of their travel, gadgets, and many, many members. I can guess that it might have been the Roman Catholic Church, but it's never even hinted at. If it was the church, then how did Roland get access to secret information, including bank vaults, police records, etc.?<br /><br />With all of its story flaws, Jumpers does have some amazing CGI. Particularly, there was one scene where Roland is in the desert and a Jumper brings a double-decker London bus with him through a jump scar and tries to roll it on top of Roland. That was incredible and made my jaw drop.<br /><br />But that was it. All style over any substance, Jumper was so weak along storylines that I didn't much care what happened to anyone in the film. The worst part is that the ending was obviously set up for a sequel. Maybe Mace Windu (Jackson's Star Wars character) could magically appear and wield 'The Force' to kill that off, too.Paladins with all of their travel, gadgets, and many, many members.

B00188KD1Y|4.0|I saw this movie lastnight with my aunt and we really liked it. Jason Statham was great and very easy on the eyes too. Jason plays \\" Frank \\" who loses his wife to murder and he is charged and sent to Termenal island prison. at the prison there is a race where who ever wins five races gets out.  After he get there he is told that he will be Frankinstin who had died but know one knows that. the deal is that frank has to win five races and he has already won 4. so all the new frank has to do is win one. this is an action pact movie.
0060574216|4.0|This book was very beneficial for understanding the opposite sex, and how they are \\"wired\\" differently! We had to read it for pre-marriage couseling, and it really opened our eyes about each other, and why we do those crazy things we do! It really helped me to learn that the things he does that drive me crazy are instinctive for all men, and not to take them personally. I would recommend this if your relationship/marraige has reached a rough spot, or if you are just interested in those quirky aspects of the opposite sex!

1933492279|4.0|Cosmic Motors offers a new perspective on futuristic racing machines by blending the form factors of things like WWII bombers and F1 racers with Simon's creativity to bring you some of the slickest vehicles around. Daniel Simon also provides a context for his vehicles with dashes of story throughout the book. The book contains several pages of tightly rendered sepia sketches as well as many extremely crisp 3D renderings that show off some seriously insane attention to detail.  A lot of the 3D renders contain composited pilots or sexy babes posing by the vehicles to show off scale and maybe a little leg.<br /><br />Overall the book is a nice addition to any concept-book lover's library. I only have two little complaints about this book: 1. I wish there were more loose sketches to paw through and 2. sometimes the composited pilots are so \\"earth-like\\" that they contrast oddly against the futuristic vehicles from another galaxy, but that contrast may have been intended.
B000WGWQG8|2.0|McCullough stated that when he wrote this book he intended to write about both Adams was more compelling and more interesting. One of the main themes that runs through the book was how uninspiring, to say the least, Thomas Jefferson's behavior was (especially towards Adams). Strangely, this never really comes up in the movie. Instead it is Adams who is presented as a curmudgeon, almost manic-depressive, cold man and Jefferson comes across as the sage from Monticello. Never mind the fact that Jefferson spent his entire life massively in debt to english creditors and ran back to his mansion whenever things got tough. No, these things never come up in the movie and we are left with an incomplete picture from which we draw inappropriate conclusions about the shortcomings of Adams. The movie never details how Jefferson undercut Adams time and time again. Instead it goes to great lengths to show how Hamilton tried to screw things up. The whole feel of the movie just falls on its face compared to the book.    For instance,what joy is there in the eventual renewal of friendship towards the ends of Adams and Jeffersons life if there is no real alienation? I hate to seem cynical, but it almost seems as if the producers are loathe to question the historical integrity of Jefferson. This couldn't have anything to do with him being the father of the Democratic Party you think?
0307265730|5.0|For those who have already read Ms. Lahiri's stories before and would like to have more of the same (trials and tribulations of Indian immigrants in a new country)this is a perfect sequel. Apart from that, it is a lovely book to read too that I enjoyed every bit. However, as Ms Lahiri shows great talent as a writer the next time she comes out with her new work I am really hoping that she branches out a bit and tries her hand at something not necessarily pulled from that same source. I am even interested in the trials of tribulations of Indians who go back to India after 30 yrs in the US and trying to adapt back to what they thought they left behind and found that they are now immigrants in their home country.
0895260131|5.0|This is a truly scarry book.  One of the cover credits titled \\"praise for the author on [...]\\" reads as follows: \\"May Allah rip out his spine from his back and split his brains in two, and then put them both back, and then do it over and over again.  Amen.\\"  The biography on the back cover tells a little about the author, Robert Spencer, and when it gets to the part where it usually tells you about his family it reads \\"He (Spencer) lives in a Secure, Undisclosed Location.\\"  This book has truly pissed off a bunch of Muslims.  The reason?  Spencer tells it like it is and lays bare their unadulterated desire for world domination and the subjugation or elimination of all unbelievers.  Unless you faithfully practice the Islam faith, you are an infidel and according to Mohamed as written in the Qur'an you have three choices: (1) Convert, (2) Subjugate yourself to Islamic rule by paying a tax to the Muslims and  withstanding their demaning treatment of you (called dhimmi) or (3) you must be killed.  These instructions are repeated over and over again in the Qur'an and in other writing by and about Muhammad.  Spencer easily demonstrates that this is not extremist Islam but mainstream Islam.  In most Islamic countries nearly one half of all the population, or more, believe in these precepts.  And yes, Spencer cites the studies and polls that this information is gleaned from.  Throughout the book there are separate panels where the words of Jesus  are contrasted with those of Muhammad.  The contrast between the man of peace and the warrior who slaughtered his own townspeople when they refused to accept him as a prophet is shocking.  Spencer also gives the politically incorrect version of why the crusades happend (they were a delayed reaction to centuries of cruel Muslim wars that killed and enslaved much of the Near East, Asia, and eastern Europe) and  what they actually accomplished.  They held off the advancing Islamic invaders just long enough for them to finally pull backas a result of their own internal politics.  The problem is that they are advancing again.  They are infiltrating European and Asian and North American  countries with the intention of eventually imposing their religion and religious law (Sharia Law) on everyone  they allow to live.  Spencer does not claim that this is the goal of all Muslims, but he does show that an alarming number of them support these precepts and the terrorist groups that promote them.  Many Muslims are not even aware of the violence preached by the Qur'an (Koran) since they are not familar with the book.  Others ignore it or embrace it.  This book speaks up and tells us that we have been warned and that it is time for the tolerant and democratic governments of this world to protect themselves.  Read this book and any of the numerous references it cites in asides as \\"A Book You're Not Supposed to Read\\" and you will have your eyes opened.
1600610234|5.0|In this book Doug Chiang leads you through a number of his drawings from marker sketch to final render. One of the great things about this method is it offers a rare look into the step-by-step changes that occur during the development of a conceptual render. This is a excellent guide for up and coming concept designers and an good source of inspiration for established artists.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants a look into how great Sci-Fi illustration is developed.
B00005QAPH|4.0|8½ is suffused with the fictive childhood memories of Fellini's onscreen doppelganger, Guido Anselmi (Marcello Mastroianni), which- if the DVD experts on Fellini, and those I've scanned in gathering background information, are correct- are merely Fellini's own true memories transferred to film. They can result in some interesting themes and scenes for the film, but often, most manifestly in the Saraghina and Cardinal digressions, they make far too much of points that could more easily and poetically been conveyed onscreen. Both of these motivs waste a good twenty or more minutes of the film's running time....As for the famed narrative- or meta-narrative. Let me give a brief rundown of what 8½ is about. The film opens with shots of 43 year old married filmmaker Guido Anselmi in a traffic jam. It is obviously a dream sequence- or is it a scene from the film that he is to make, the one this film is about? It is clearly a set piece, and after escaping from his car window, as if from the uterus, he takes to the air, and becomes a kite, pulled back down to earth by whom we later recognize as the filmic representatives of Claudia Cardinale (playing herself), the actress who is to star in Guido's film within this film. As he falls to earth he wakens at a health spa where he is recuperating from a breakdown of some sort, along with his screenwriter, a dense film critic named Daumier (Jean Rougeul). Outside the spa he has a vision of a virginal white clad goddess, also played by Claudia Cardinale- although she is a separate character from the Claudia Cardinale who later appears as an actress in 8½. She manifestly represents an idealized vision of love and femininity to Guido. Daumier then criticizes Guido's ideas for his upcoming film as immature and self-indulgent, as Fellini obviously is striking the first blows for his film's claim to greatness.<br />  He then spots Mario Mezzabotta (Mario Pisu), an old friend who is squiring around a dark, sexy young American girl he intends to marry. Her name is Gloria Morin (Barbara Steele, Mario Bava's horror film diva). Guido then heads to the train station to meet his gauche and buffoonish married mistress Carla (Sandra Milo). He already regrets asking her to come, until that night they play a game of hooker and john, and she eagerly plays her naughty role to sexual perfection. Guido falls asleep and dreams of his parents at a cemetery, His father (Annibale Ninchi) is dead, and his mother (Guiditta Rissone) kisses him lasciviously, then pulls back to reveal it is his wife, Luisa (Anouk Aim&eacute;e). Later, Guido tries to avoid movie types and reporters who are after the story of what his next film will be about. Some entertainment ensues at the hotel, and Guido is reminded of a mysterious childish saying from his past, asa nisi masa. This nonsense phrase is the film's equivalent of Citizen Kane's Rosebud. How this all turns out is well known and detailed by others.<br />  Incidentally, there is some confusion over why the film is called what it is called. The truth is that the film's final title 8½ refers to the number of films Fellini directed to that point- six features, two short (½) films, and his first film, half a feature, Luci del Varieta, which he co-directed with Alberto Lattuada, thus totaling 7½ films. This was therefore his 8½th film. As for the critical reception and continuing misconstruals this film receives, both positive and negative, it is easy to see why. Much of this confusion is recapitulated in the film's original title La Bella Confusione (The Beautiful Confusion). It is not clear whether or not this internal artistic confusion was genuine, in Fellini's case, but it does not matter to his puppet, Guido Anselmi, for intent is meaningless in art. The end result is all, always all. Thus, 8 ½ is a weird m&eacute;lange of Freudian pop nonsense (id, ego, superego), and Salvador Dal&igrave; lite imagery, that badly dates the film intellectually. All of it is well handled, in beautiful black and white cinematography by Gianni de Venanzo, with an intriguing and well-placed musical score by Nino Rota, to enhance the artificiality of it all, but all the personal references, which in the film do little to enhance an understanding of Guido, even as they may lend obsessive critics insight into Fellini's life, drag the film down by its own overblown heft....8½ improves with rewatching, but it's still too long, filled with clumsy satire- Saraghina and the Cardinal, pointless digressions, and the like.d white cinematography by Gianni de Venanzo, with an intriguing and well-placed musical score by Nino Rota, to enhance the artificiality of it all, but all the personal references, which in the film do little to enhance an understanding of Guido, even as they may lend obsessive critics insight into Fellini's life, drag the film down by its own overblown heft....8½ improves with rewatching, but it's still too long, filled with clumsy satire- Saraghina and the Cardinal, pointless digressions, and the like.

B0018AK9RA|1.0|Judas Priest not only introduced me to Heavy Metal, they taught me how to play guitar, and how to write my own songs and not sound like every other band from the NWOBHM and onward into Thrash/Speed metal. They were a Juggernaut that with every release pushed themselves and myself to greater abilities of writing/playing and live shows that I will NEVER forget. Black Sabbath introduced dark lyrical themes and both Blues leanings and off-kilter time signatures to a heavier style of music. But in my opinion, Judas Priest invented HEAVY METAL, without question, and for that I am eternally grateful.<br /><br />However, the Priest that I've seen live (even on the unrecognizable \\"Turbo\\" tour) is no longer around it would seem. 'Nostradamus' is unfortunately the release from the Priest that exists today, and it shows that whatever magic Halford/Tipton/Downing had for writing some of the most killer metal songs of all time such as \\"Screaming For Vengeance\\", \\"The Sentinel\\" and \\"Painkiller\\", is now lost, probably forever. And I hang my head down and light a candle for the death of it. The mighty Priest has fallen.......<br /><br />p.s. And to save time on some rebuttal questions, no I do not expect them to repeat themselves over and over. I've played guitar for long enough to know that is idiotic and talentless. In my opinion though, this release is nothing like Judas Priest as I've known them over the years, and they HAVE changed over those years. Just not into....whatever it is that \\"Nostradamus\\" is.

B00000K19E|5.0|When 'THE MATRIX' first came out, I resisted the hype that began to surround it once all of the reviews--by laymen and professionals alike--started coming in.<br />  About a year after it's cinematic release, when it was available on pay-per-view, on a night when I was bored stiff, with absolutely nothing else to do, I invested $4.99 just to see what all the hoopla was all about.<br />  Excuse my French... but, God Damnit! Induct the Wachowski brothers into the movie making hall of fame right now!<br />  If they never make another film, (which they obviously have, considering that there's now a 'Matrix' trilogy. UGH!)this one fantastic movie, in and of it's own accord, justifies their having a place of prominence in the pantheon of the all time great producers / directors in movie making history.<br />  Being an intelligent, thoughtful, highly analytical and conscious individual, the mental stimulation which I derived from this finely nuanced film was enough to make me giddy.<br />  With a superb cast; great acting; a mind-boggling plot; and dialogue that you can sink your teeth into; THE MATRIX gives the viewer a whole lot of everything.<br />  But, for me, the one thing that it gave me more than anything else, was a sense of empowerment.<br />  The sense that if we can conceive it and BELIEVE it, that we can also achieve it; and in essence, this film is really just one long testament to my favorite philosophical axiom; one which states that, \\"The person who thinks that they can, and the person who thinks that they can't, are both right.\\" and for every single character in this movie, it was all about that one simple thing: 'belief'.<br />  Morpheus, the leader of the group, who was played to perfection by Lawrence Fishburn, BELIEVED so strongly that he would find the one, that he had devoted his entire life to searching for him.<br />  Trinity, played by Carrie Ann Moss, believed so strongly in Morpheus, that she risked her life time and time again, delving into the matrix as a liaison between Morpheus and 'the one'.<br />  Cypher, played by Hugo Weaving, believed that their search was so much B.S. that he sold out to the agents, attempting to sabotage the groups efforts, for his own personal welfare.<br />  NEO, played by keanu Reeves, believed that he was 'just another guy' until the collective belief of everyone around him, particularly Morpheus and Trinity, convinced him that he really was 'the one.'<br />  This movie is so tightly constructed that even the names of these individuals tell a story that is relative to it's character.<br />  Morpheus is the name of 'the principal God of dreams' in Greek mythology, and in The Matrix, Morpheus attempts to wake everyone from their dream state.<br />  Trinity represents the power of alliance, particularly the alliance of three, as in the sun the moon and the stars, the father the son and the holy ghost, life death and rebirth, past present and future, etc... and she serves as the link between Morpheus' ideology, and it's real life application in the embodiment of Neo.<br />  Neo, literally means 'NEW', and is also an anagram for ONE, and he would be the first person to see The Matrix as it really was, and he would also be the the first ONE to take a step into the heart of THE MATRIX and live to tell.<br />  Even the name of their vessel, the Nebuchadnezzar, was symbolic, in the regards that Nebuchadnezzar was the name of the Babylon king who rebelled against Darius the great of Persia, who was the most powerful ruler of his 5th century B.C times.<br />  This s**t is the macrocosm in microcosm, finely nuanced in every detail; and, in fact, if you really want to experience this movie from another perspective, DON\\"T WATCH IT...

0385493622|4.0|Alongside books like \\"Fantasia Mathematica\\", \\"Flatline\\" and \\"E=MC2\\", Fermat's Enigma does a fantastic job of showing both the human drama of mathematics, as well as the beauty of the science itself.    Better than I've ever seen it put before, Singh captures how math is different from every other science -     (my summary from pages 18-22)  \\"Math is the pursuit for ultimate truth. Once a mathematical theorom is proven, it is true till the end of time. Scientific proofs, on the other hand, are merely considered highly likely based on the evidence available.\\"    And, math is aptly described as a language, a way of talking about everything in the world around us with absolute truth. There is purity. As stated by Pythagoras when describing the shape of rivers, the sound of a musical instrument, the shape of the earth...\\"Everything is Number\\".

DK doesn't even crack my favorite 1000 movies,  Apparently hollywood has no brain anymore, what a shame. Only gave two stars, cause I actually sat through this atrocity. Probably one of the worst inventions ever was the cell phone, and this movie uses lots of its special effects on a nightmarish cell phone technology. Thats what I think about this movie. For young people who hate adults and a trashy nightmarish dark comedy, certainly good for nothing I can think of. The Joker, Heath Ledger, is obviously addicted to painkillers while the filming of movie, looks without energy and an annoying prescription drug addicted nuisance. In short, \\"A Nightmare of a movie---Rosemary's Baby, The Omen are just as scary-- should have never been aloud in the theatres like those type of movies are not aloud to be made anymore either. Without a doubt, deserved an R rating, but my personal opinion is if your going to disallow movies like that were made in the 70s, like \\"The Groove Tube\\", \\"Rosemary's Baby\\" \\"The Omen\\", this one surely should have never been aloud to be shown in this country. The only difference between the aforementioned movies and The Dark Knight, is The Dark Knight, with all its money on special effects, was poorly made and thought out.

B000PMLFRA|5.0|I vaguely recall a very controversial interview with Lucas from years past, when he said he would not release the original trilogy ever again UNTIL the technology which he desired was finally available. Of course, he never really described such-mentioned technology.    Well we all have heard that the apparent reason why he 'tinkered' with the original releases in the first place was because some of the 'technology' he needed to make those 'added' scenes was non-existant back in the 70's (CGI). Apparently those added scenes were in his notes, and just not do-able back then. Again, this is all arguable.    But my point here is.....okay Lucas, you added your 'beloved' extra scenes as soon as you were able to. So what about the re-release of the originals? What more could you want from the 'technology' then BLU RAY? It's won the HD war. It is arguably, the future. Do what you said you would do... release the ORIGINALS on blu. And soon! This is finally a format large enough to include everything and anything everyone could possibly want all in 1 place. Satisfy us all by releasing a single blu-ray for each movie that includes every version ever released (they did it for T2!)....and every extra ever released. That would be a SINGLE SET OF 6-7 BLUs (perhaps 1 seperate disk for all of the extras). Not 10 seperate regular dvd sets (and lets not forget those old vhs sets some of us are still hanging on to). The double, triple, and ten-touple dipping has got to stop! Imagine that; product for the people. Your patient fans await!    *****Update 8/2010*****  So Lucas has announced in Celebration V that all of the episodes will be released on Blu in fall of 2011. Part of me is overjoyed. Part of me is not so sure. Time will tell with what is included. All we know is that it will most definitley be the 'ammended' versions. And, of course, he'll pull footage out of his vault that we've never seen before in the extras. So much for my idea of housing a majority of the previous extrasall in one set. :( However, one of Lucas' comments left a bad taste in my mouth and I thought I would share it here. He is quoted for saying at Celebration V that \\"We've been wanting to do it as soon as we possibly could, but we just wanted to do it when enough people would be able to buy it and see it.\\" What exactly is that supposed to mean? Hmmm? My euphemism-detector is about to explode! So in other words \\"I didn't wanna do it until the opportune amount of people have jumped on the blu-ray bandwagon, so that I may make the most amount of money possible during it's first weeks of sale, therefore making my efforts worth while.\\" Really???? Say it ain't so George!
0743454537|1.0|I was all set to give this novel 4 stars up until the very end. The writing as amazing and you could almost sympathize with all the characters. Then the author oes something completely insane as an ending and ruins the whole story. I was extremely annoyed and generally upset by lack of disregard for readers.
B0000046MM|5.0|Along the flamenco there have been emblematic figures - specially along these last two decades - but all these have a common debt with Paco de Lucia, the gladiator, the herald the master musician of ravishing virtuosity and unequalled style.<br /><br />It's absolutely impossible not to be engaged after listening him from the first bars.<br /><br />Don't miss this album.
B0014I4KIK|5.0|I had never heard of Duffy until a couple of days ago when I heard Stepping Stone whilst listening to Radio 2 online here in the USA. Yes I know I am a dinasour! I fell in love with her voice and immediately purchased Rockferry. I am not wise enough to enter into an educated criticism of the CD or make comparisons with other singers. Enough to say this is a beautiful CD. Duffy has an amazing voice and the songs are beautifully arranged, I love the soaring string sections. Duffy is from Neffyn in North Wales a place I know well. What a contrast her life will show from there!
0930289234|5.0|There's not much I can say that hasn't been said, it's the best comic book (or graphic novel) out there by a long shot.  Heck, it's the only CB/GN to ever win a Hugo Award, and award that only goes to science fiction novels.<br /><br />Don't let the \\"lame character design\\" turn you off, you'll understand when you read it. Everything about this book is top notch, I recommend it to anyone who has ever liked comics, superheroes, or even just science fiction... actually everyone should give it a read.<br /><br />I can't wait for the movie...<br />5*
B00003CXDV|4.0|I have also watched this fun movie several times (all without my sweetheart who hates the idea of sci-fi) and I liked it because it teaches one of my favorite theories. It is impossible to pretend to be something for very long without in some way becoming that thing. The key is what do you pretend to be? Hopefully it is something more noble than what you may have been. I don't mean that it is good to be hypocritical, just that by stiving to be the man you would like to be is better than settling for the man you are. Maybe that is way too deep for this fun spoof of the Star Trecified shows.<br /><br />So here's the deal, this is a funny if a bit silly spoof that just might give you something to think about if you are in the mood.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|This movie not only was shipped to me in a timely manner, but the copy was superb. I first rented this movie on netflix, but after I saw it I just had to buy it! A wonderful love story, and a must buy if you are a fan of English romance novels! Enjoy!

NO LUCK<br />FINALLY, on the FOURTH attempt (with a friend who really wanted to see it) I drank one of those little 5 HOUR ENERGY things. (They WORK)<br /><br />BUT, it was a mistake!! I should have just let myself go to sleep and ignore my friend. (BTW, my friend did NOT like the movie either - She wound up falling asleep - LOL!!!)

I am also so greatful that my book came in mint condition and actually came about two days early. I recommend this book to people who like romance, fantasy, adventure, and good books in general. (I really can't say more because words just won't suffice for this)
B0018AK9RA|4.0|I originally gave this a scathing 1 star review. It was a knee jerk reaction to a cd I was totally not expecting. I played it a dozen times before putting it away claiming this was not the Priest I know and love.  I didn't listen to it again for 2 weeks before I said to myself, \\"Self. This is the Priest you know and love. Don't give up on it.\\" So back in the cd player it went with a different perspective on what I was going to hear. And what a difference that made. I was hearing songs I thought I'd never heard before, and they were good! Priest obviously took their time and put a lot of work into this, and it shows through the music. Often dark and heavy, sometimes fast, sometimes slow with preludes to many songs that connect and give life to the story they are telling.  So, to those that had preconceived expectations about this cd and were disappointed, I say throw those expectations out of the window and give it another go. You'll be pleasantly surprised. I know I was.
0553801503|2.0|The series was off to such a great start.  Then, a bunch of things happened.  The time between books got longer and longer.  The amount of story that happened in each book got less and less.  The amount of meaningless content in each book went up.      I agree that he's lost control of his story.  Either he thinks anything he writes can get longer and longer, and that it's excused by that Tolkien quote he uses (\\"The tale grew in the telling\\"), or that he can excuse it by saying the book is too long for physical binding.  Both should tell him something.      I would like to see his story lines become tighter, with fewer meandering reminiscences and back-references, and for him to shrink the time between books.      JK Rowling had some of the same problems, with the books having more and more fluff.  In her books 4 and 5, it was possible to see whole pages that contributed nothing to the story, where in books 1 through 3, it was possible to miss something if one was inattentive for just a sentence.  However, she was able to get her series back on track, and wrap it up with a great #6 and #7.    I see a disturbing similarity between his series and the \\"Wheel of Time\\" series.  With Robert Jordan, I was at first realllllly worried that he was taking too long, and I was hoping that he would pull things together.  After Book 9, I didn't give a damn any more, as I waited for the price of the used hardcover to drop to a buck before I bought one.      I'm half-expecting that this series will end the same, with me not giving a damn.  I really do hope he can resurrect the series and get it back on track, but I'm not holding my breath.  I've canceled my pre-order.
B00003003R|5.0|Guns N' Roses-Live:Era '87-'93 *****<br /><br />Depending on where you find it Live:Era can run you a pretty penny. Well it is worth the price of admission. As the title suggest it takes performances from all around the globe from 1987 through 1993 when the band was on their Lose Your Illusions tour.<br /><br />Slash, Izzy, and on a few tracks Gilby Clark play some killer guitar. Extended solos in some places and some all around impressive work always. Duff holds is own with Steven Adler and sometimes Matt Sorum. Axl's voice sounds pretty good through out and his interaction with the crowds is wonderful.<br /><br />'Welcome To The Jungle' is done fantastic. The intro is classic. 'Dust N' Bones' kicks; Izzy dominates here. The fact that they didn't leave of tracks from Lies is great as it is truly the bands best work. 'Patience' is chilling because the crowd almost over powers Rose. 'Used To Love Her' is as ruthless as always. 'Move To The City' is phenomenal. 'Rocket Queen' blows away the studio version as does 'Paradise City.' 'Estranged' could have been better but they all hated each other by then so that's alright.<br /><br />What really makes this worth owning is Axl's cover of Black Sabbaths 'Its Alright.' Absolutely stunning. Short, sweet, and brilliant. Take a listen and see what I mean because this has to be heard to appreciate.<br /><br />Live: Era is essential for the true GNR fan. Yeah there may be a better version of 'You Could Be Mine' but who has the time to find it on their own?

B0000028M7|5.0|My musical tastes have changed over the years quite a bit, but Alice in Chains has always, and always will be, my favorite band.  Every one of their releases are 5 star worthy, but this one is usually regarded as their best, and I would agree.  Simply because EVER single song is great, there is no filler.  There is a reason AIC still gets air time on the radio all over the nation, and if you like them even a little bit and don't have this cd, you need to get it now!
079073639X|4.0|Disclaimer: I'm a huge fan of the book so that's very likely to bias this review.<br /><br />Okay, first of all, if you haven't read [[ASIN:0345418972 Sphere]], read it first if you're interested in this movie. It's a fantastic book and a much better presentation of this story than the movie. If you watch the movie and then read the book, you're likely to enjoy the book much less. The movie is a great compliment to the book and adds some very good twists to the story.<br /><br />The movie has a problem with pacing. It dives into the plot at the cost of potentially leaving the viewer confused and doesn't build up the suspense up front as much as it could. This is more to focus more time on the middle of the movie, but it loses some of the magic of the book.<br /><br />Samuel L. Jackson and Dustin Hoffman both do a good job portraying their characters. Samuel L. Jackson especially nailed Harry and is possibly the best part of the movie adaptation. Liev Schreiber did a good job as Ted, but I was completely underwhelmed by Sharon Stone.<br /><br />The sets and atmosphere were nicely done and the music supported it well, but on a whole, something seemed missing.<br /><br />I highly recommend getting the book, reading it (possibly overnight) and then buying or renting this movie if you like the book.
B00000IQC8|5.0|This was the movie that lead me to the genius that is Kevin Smith.   This was his first movie and I think it's the second best movie he has ever made.   This is one of the comedies that echo truth that exists in you that you can only understand if you have actually worked as a convenience store clerk.  The lead character Dante Hicks has to deal with irate customers, a girlfriend that has issues with his stature in life, an nymphomatic ex-girlfriend, and a best friend that almost wants to see him fail.     This is one of the ultimate slacker comedies.  I was first aware of because of an article in Details magazine hailing it as one the latest and greatest independent films released.  I went out to Suncoast Video (do those even exist anymore?) and purchased the VHS tape for 29.99 and went home and immediately popped it in the video tape.     This is one the best movie for one liners that you repeat to your friends.   This is one of the movies where either you get it or you don't.   It's one of the greatest slacker comedies made.  If you haven't seen this movie, stop what you are doing and go out and get it.     I assure you this post is closed.

B00005JLD4|4.0|Rabbit Proof Fence is the true story of three Aborigine girls who travel more than 1,000 miles on foot through the desert to return home to their mothers.  The girls were taken from their mothers in Australia's effort to train \\"half caste\\" - or half white - children to be servants in mainstream Australia.  Most reviewers will note that although the intention seems absurd now, the government had good intentions.  I don't swallow this a bit, but that's my opinion.<br /><br />The movie itself is well done.  I didn't recognize any of the actors, but the acting was excellent.  I was surprised at the acting capability of the unknown girl actresses.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie.
B000BB14YY|5.0|Kurosawa may be the first world-class Japanese director that most Americans think of, but many Japanese consider him the most Western of their country's great artists.  Old prints of his early works list his name in the traditional order:  Kurosawa Akira.  We, of course, know him as Akira Kurosawa.    RAN is a good example of that cultural balance.  Not only is it an adaptation of KING LEAR -- in fact, it may be the best version of LEAR ever put on film -- but it casts the story in the historical context of 16th century feudal Japan and combines a dynamic, deep focus camera and ferocious battle scenes with the mannered performances of Nô theater.  It brings together Lord Hidetora, an arrogant, tragic patriarch; Kyoami, Hidetora's wise and loyal fool; and Lady Kaede, that most cunning villain whose scheming brings disaster to them all.  This cross-cultural balance probably shouldn't work but it intensifies, I think, the depth of the tragedy.    Parts of RAN, the plotting and back-room deliberations especially, may seem slow.  The alternation of still, almost meditative deliberation with sudden action is a rhythm characteristic of the Nô drama.  Kurosawa uses it beautifully.    Stephen Prince's audio commentary describes the background of some of the principal actors but concentrates primarily on Kurosawa's use of the camera and on the social and historical context of the story.  I suspect that those who find such academic discussions informative will enjoy Prince's superb narrative.  This recent Criterion release is nicely mastered with sharp images, vivid colors, and clear subtitles.

B001DP241O|5.0|(before reading this, note: i love stargate, both series. this review only includes what i do not like)       though i enjoy stargate atlantis. it suffers from something that has plagued the entire franchise from the beginning, even starting as early as season one of SG1.  even the greatest episodes have this slow lengthy period at the the end, that involves nothing more then talking heads, sometimes poorly scripted talking heads.  like we have to slow down and talk about everyone feelings.  on the Atlantis pilot, the worst line is the last, something like \\"you know, that could get us in to trouble.\\" its weak, but is short, so i can deal, but that is mostly what these \\"closing lines\\" consist of.  the worst of, being \\"the broca divide\\" from SG1. the episode is good, but has one of the slowest boring endings.     and their system for writing battles leaks through from sg1.  this is how battles went in sg1: good guys shoot, we watch enemies die for a while.  camera pans, its the bad guys turn to shoot.  turn based action.  i think this system carries through to Atlantis's way of presenting problems.  something happens, Mckay solves, and guess what, something else happens, didn't see that coming.     at least they got rid of the dinosaur carter, just because some people cant deal with canceling SG1 after ten years (the show was dead anyway, after Richard dean Anderson quit)  is no reason to bring over someone that i would say was the most replaceable character of SG1. even that aside, her character never had enough depth to say anything new after ten years.  her saying pissy lines was mildly entertaining the first dozen times, we don't need to see it even more.     something about Tayla says \\"give me fewer lines!\\" Ronan too, that was the whole point of Ronan, man of few words, but now he is the friggin philosopher.  and the caveman hunter Tayla, is a computer wiz? right.  not saying she should be stupid, but come on, there is some word for how fast humans can except technology. and i think they forget were Tayla comes from.  and their brilliant idea of, character episodes. though i love these actors, none of them have the strength to pull it off alone.  Richard dean Anderson, or Micheal Shanks, they could handle it.  but not any of atlantis, except maybe Joe Flanigan, and i think they have already done that. just stick with the group thing, its what they do best.  though i admit, season 5 is turning out better then season four. which involved more cliches and SG1 reference then ever before.

B0016FQ9LC|5.0|The first Opeth song I ever heard was Harvest. I heard it as part of a random collection of songs that came packaged with a magazine. I'd never heard of Opeth but loved Harvest. Of course I had no idea then that Harvest doesn't give a good impression of what Opeth really does. Harvest is only half of Opeth.    Before that, I wasn't a fan of metal at all, and surely not death metal. The genre was completely foreign to me and not even something I wanted to explore. Still, this was the time of Napster so I got a few more Opeth songs from Blackwater Park to see what else they had. Needless to say, they didn't compare to Harvest much and I wasn't much interested at first. It sounded like noise and screaming. Not to mention the songs were really long.    I got to like it, though. There are two things I think separate Opeth from other metal acts: Mikael Akerfeldt's voice, and the dumming. For the albums that I was first into, Martin Lopez was the drummer. He's awesome. (I've watched and re-watched the documentary that comes on their \\"Lamentations\\" DVD and I'm awed just not by Lopez but by all of them.) I don't see a lot of other people say that drumming is Opeth's main draw, and I agree, it's not. But I ask myself, why don't I like other progressive metal acts as much as Opeth? Take Agalloch's \\"The Mantle,\\" for instance. It's supposed to be highly regarded. When I listen to it, though, I'm just bored. The musicianship just isn't as good. And the vocals don't even come close to Akerfeldt's.    I'm digressing a lot. The point I'm trying to make is that Opeth isn't just for people who are into metal, anger, and screaming. This music is beautiful. True, it's brutal sometimes. Lyrically, it's not something you'd hear in church. The death growl is jarring at first and hard to take seriously if you're not used to it. You have to get past those things, though. Do not be scared to give this album and this music a chance.    Anyway, after buying Blackwater Park and then the others,Still Life is my favorite Opeth album. It's got all the same elements as other Opeth albums so it's hard to put into words why I like this one just a bit more than all the others.    And if you buy this at retail, and have a chance to listen to it on a 5.1 system, it's quite an experience, especially if you've been listening to the album for a number of years. You'll hear it in a whole new way.

1596680199|5.0|First off - yes, there are LOTS of books available showing all sorts of different projects using polymer clay and no, you won't become an expert overnight with this one or any other one.  HOWEVER, Blackburn has provided a book with updated information and the guidelines to get you on your way to make the beads of your dreams - referring to the first section entitled \\"Materials and Techniques:\\"  espcially, blending-Skinner Tech., Combing, Caning, Molding, Shapes, Drilling, Polishing (very important), Varnishing, Foils, Extrusions, Textures, Transfers Stamping, Mokume Gane, Mica Shift and more.  Just remember, she and others making beautiful polymer products do this all the time and so practice, practice, practice.  That being said, I have to say that I truly enjoy this book as so many others have mentioned - that being the focus on bead making.  My own efforts over many months of work were so so at best.  Once I followed her steps, which are given with photos & written info for each step, I am much more pleased with my own beads.<br /><br />My main interest in this book has been section two \\"Faux Techniques\\" - wood, marble, ivory/bone, leather, amber, coral bronze, abalone, jade, mother-of-pearl (amazing), silver, malachite, turquoise, lapis, onyx, agate.  For the most part, I have been extremely pleased at the outcomes of my efforts, but some of Blackburn's representations of imitating certain things could be better.  Lapis - get the book \\"Polymer-The Chameleon Clay\\" by V. Hughes in order to get a more realistic lapis stone appeal, same as for jade - but this 2nd book is horrible when it comes to Turquoise (also described in Blackburn's book but still not as realistic as I would like...a difficult stone to mimic).  So I use the Hughes book for some faux items.  Blackburn does have some outstanding examples (IMHO) of Wood (not the ultimate best, but close); Veined Marble - compared to the real thing, I was amazed; Coral bead work was admirable and worth practicing to get it just right; Abalone - love it - very realistic; Jade was comparable to Hughes work; Mother-of-Pearl - truly striking, especially when making the colored pearls; Malachite - close but before YOU make it examine natural malachite in order to develop a more realistic color pattern but still closely following Blackburn in the color production end; Onyx - MY FAVORITE - actually it is more like a natural agate stone as typically when you think of onyx, it is black.  Blackburn's Onyx is highly layered using products that I wish I would have thought of...but now I know...in order to get a REALLY natural looking agate stone bead.  Blackburn's section on \\"Agate\\" in the \\"Faux Techniques\\" applies more to a cut stone of agate and she has produced some interesting pendant type pieces.  But again, get an Agate book and try to mimic some of the patterns of real agates following Blackburn's technique.  You won't be sorry.<br /><br />Sections to use other books or to keep trying to find better ways to mimic these items are:  silver, turquoise, lapis, bronze (this could go either way for some of Blackburn's pieces are admirable - same with her amber pieces), ugh on the leather look, and noooo on the ivory and bone beads.  Books with more realistic bone are \\"The Polymer Clay Techniques Book\\" by S. Heaser - and pay attention to the antiquing section for bone or \\"Faux Surfaces in Polymer Clay\\" by I.S. Dean where the best looking bone look is shown.  However, both these books lack the more detailed descriptions and images that Blackburn provides in her book.  Yet, Blackburn's work/descriptions are a great way to start from in getting the look you may want using products she recommends.<br /><br />In the 3rd section of the book called \\"Bringing It All Together\\" - she does a great job of pulling the necessary items needed to really make the beads - from various jewelry findings, cording, attaching, designing...thus flowing smoothly into the final section \\"The Gallery.\\" Many of the great polymer bead artists' work is shown here and definitely grab your attention.  Yet this section is small as Blackburn focuses upon the other areas mentioned above and thus earning more stars from me as that is the reason I wanted the book...not for the gallery but for the great guidelines and examples to help ME develop my own pieces.<br /><br />With all this being said...or rather written...by me, I guess I have to say there is not just one book for all things in polymer clay.  However, I feel the layout, descriptions, images and all around clarity by Blackburn makes her book stand out in my library.  I am glad to have the NUMEROUS other books, magazines, etc. on polymer clay plus seeing some of the extraordinary work by many artists focused on this medium - all of which increases my drive to improve my own work with polymer clay...and hopefully your own work as well.  This medium is amazing and so available - use Blackburn's book as a great stepping stone and you definitely will not be disappointed.reat polymer bead artists' work is shown here and definitely grab your attention.

I found myself reading more non-fiction. Tons of reference books and historical types. So I saw this book at my local book store and looked it up on amazon. Read a few reviews and decided i wanted to give this one a try. WOW! What a pleasant surprise. Joe Abercrombie really knows how to welcome an old fiend home to the genre. This book was completely unexpected and a delite to read. I felt like he added in plenty of elements from other genres enough to really add in some fire to the fantasy genre. This book had me reading in the elevator, the bathroom, at the table, in bed and once while driving. You won't want to put it down. Do yourself a favour and pick this gem up and give it a try. I've already turend 5 of my friends onto it and they have all read his next book and are climbing the walls awaiting the third one.

1416550518|4.0|From the start, The House at Riverton reminded me of The Thirteenth Tale by Diane Setterfield, a book I loved. Both are gothic mysteries, both are told in flashback sequences, and both entail a secret that has never been divulged. Though I have to say my heart still lies with The Thirteenth Tale, this novel was well-written and is a fine addition to the gothic mystery genre.    There are two mysteries at the heart of this novel, one of which is mentioned in the summary. What really happened by the lake that ended in the young poet's suicide was a shock; I didn't see it coming at all. However, I was able to guess at the answer to the second mystery (I don't want to elaborate because it would take away your enjoyment of the book!) very easily, and correctly. While I don't like mysteries in books to be so convoluted as to seem unlikely, neither do I like it when the answer is too easy to discern too quickly.    The details about the Edwardian period of England, as well as the quick decline into World War I and then the roaring '20's was a delight to read. The details are wonderful, and it is shocking how quickly England goes from a world of corsets to a world of flappers. It is obviously well researched and the details about life in that shifting time period are enjoyable to read.    This book should appeal to multiple readers. It is primarily a gothic mystery, while also falling into the category of historical fiction. It is an enjoyable read, and while it does stumble a bit here and there, overall it is a well-written and engrossing mystery that anyone should enjoy.     - skrishnasbooks.com
B000GCFO0I|1.0|This film is one long beautiful piece of Art Director's delight. Every frame is a visual feast.<br /><br />But that is all.<br /><br />The script is incomprehensible and makes no sense whatsoever. The first half of the film is just the mother running after an irritating little girl who won't stop. The second half is impossible to understand... But it has to do with witches, a molested child, a crazy cult, freak monsters and a group of nurses who should be on that Madonna video \\"Nothing Really Matters\\" (that was what they reminded me of) LOL.<br /><br />This is the example of a film that follows so close a game structure that it ends up being just a hollow and uninteresting game narrative without the game parts... like if someone had sewed together all the exposition parts of the game.<br /><br />Dull.
B000X9PNOG|2.0|First off I am a big fan of Meat Loaf so I hate rating this so low. But here goes..<br /><br />On the first line on the first song \\"All Revved Up With No Place To Go\\" he wasn't even near the melody of the song. I'm talking WAY off here....not just a little flat or sharp. As I continued to watch it became clear to me that something was terribly wrong with Meat that night.<br /><br />The band is hot but because of Meat's poor performance I'm sure I'll never watch this again. It was just too painful.<br /><br />It's no wonder this DVD isn't even mentioned on Meat Loaf's official website.<br /><br />This product should have never seen the light of day.
B0002O7XW2|5.0|I just watched this classic film last night for the first time ever.  I have to say I LOVED it.  I am def. going to buy this dvd in the near future, I HIGHLY recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of classic horror and or Stephen King movies.

B000002MY3|5.0|This album, \\"Jagged Little Pill\\",  is the best that Alanis has put out to date. In this CD she is a girly version of Mike Muir a.k.a. Cyco Miko, pissed off and looking for confrontation. Gotta love the 'Cross eye'd bear' song, track number 2 titled \\"You oughta know\\"; One of her best songs ever! Over all a very relaxing listening album, like \\"Agent Orange\\", or \\"Devo\\".
0446677450|5.0|Our accountant recommended this book, and I am sure glad he did.  I read it in just a few days because it was so interesting.  This isn't a typical \\"get rich\\" book since I found that the author was definitely trying to teach the reader how to rethink the way he or she views money.  Some people might think that he is holding back by not going more into detail about how he made his millions, but trust me, if you read between the lines and really pay attention, he does give you some hints on how he got started.  He does reinforce a lot of his information, but he is a teacher, and teachers I find are usually repetitive to make sure that they get their points across.  This is a great starter book for anyone looking to make their money work for them.  And for those of you with children, this book (or Rich Dad for Teens) will help get them on the right track.
B00005AG7K|3.0|My three-star rating is based on the actual movie. If you are only a casual fan of the Beatles you are probably not going to care much for MMT. For diehard fans, though, it's a must. Being one of those diehards, I enjoy MMT quite a bit. After all, it's got the only video in existence of the Beatles performing numerous hits, including \\"I am the Walrus.\\" HOWEVER....you probably don't want to bother buying this pirated copy. I bought one a few years back after my original, official-issue MMT dvd went missing. I was extremely disappointed in the very poor quality of the transfer. I guess you get what you pay for. Hopefully Apple will get on the ball and remaster and re-release this one, but considering they've been hemming and hawing on a reissue of Let it Be for a couple decades now, I wouldn't hold my breath.

0765318741|5.0|After seeing the movie, I wanted to know more, so I picked up the book.  I discovered this is actually a short story & was totally different than the movie.<br /><br />Like a lot of books, the story starts out in the present.  However, Matheson did not delve into the past's details & when he did, it wasn't quite the chronology I was expecting -- which sets this novel apart.  Also, I think Matheson portrayed the main character wonderfully!  I love that he was so rough & flawed, but this also made the character more real to me.  I also enjoyed the sporadic dialogue the main character had with HIMSELF -- the dialogue kept the book from being monotonous.  Thought-provoking read with enough emotional & scientific-based depth to keep me interested.
0385340990|5.0|One of my author friends, Dennis Batchelder, author of Soul Identity, mentioned The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society - that he was reading it and thought it would be a great read for others. This is like where do chefs like to go out to eat on their days off - you look to see so you can experience the best.<br />And the best is this sweet book. Yes it is different - but it is something I as a fledgling writer would love to use as inspiration -<br />This book not only entertains with a young writer in London, post WWII, who has found success with her observations, being contacted by a gentleman in Guernsey, but a history lesson, so subtle and exquisite, it tells us of the German occupation in Guernsey - I for one didn't know that the Germans were that close to mainland UK - that is one more frightening fact, that is not known by many.<br />Juliet Ashton, gets the letter from Dawsey Adams in Guernsey. He has an old book of hers and wants to ask for information on an author, and starts to tell her about the Literary Society his friends have formed.<br />So starts a lovely and touching correspondence between Juliet, Dawsey, and all his friends, and the correspondence from Juliet and her publishing friends -<br />Yes - it is a book of letters and telegrams - and it envelopes you in its web and you feel you are a part of the Literary Society yourself.<br />This is a book of the love of the written word, from ordinary folks just trying to survive in a horrible time, and who, through their bond, triumph.<br />It is a different book, filled with delightful characters and situations, and one you will love as much as I.
B000Q31L4U|5.0|I had heard this move was a little dark and even though I might agree, my son who is afraid of everything LOVES this movie.  He will watch it over and over again all year long.  I think the best part for the kids is the train - all little boys love trains!  And the cool part for the adults is trying to figure out how many charater's voices are done by Tom Hanks!  Really great movie and the animation is phenomenal.
B000002B49|5.0|HIGHLIGHTS: Deep Forest's Boheme is easily one of the best ethno-techno albums. Not just a pale imitator of Enigma, Frenchmen Eric Mouquet and Michel Sanchez are avid samplers, apt musicians, and combine mostly European vocals (although some sound Asian and African in origin) on this sophomore outing with their own instrumental arrangements. The riffs are memorable, the tracks are rich and mature -- most are radio-friendly-length -- and just about whenever they're presented with, like master chefs, Mouquet and Sanchez synthesize into a delicious stew.<br /><br />There are no weak tracks on Boheme, altho some arguably shine more than others: \\"Marta's song\\", which I saw a documentary on the making of on MOR Music many years ago, has a hypnotic, entrancing music video which goes around and around (seek it out on YouTube). The violin solo is one of the most gorgeous instrumental interludes I've ever heard, and complements the strong-yet-gentle beat.<br /><br />Every song on Boheme definitely has its own personality, and if you look closely, the work is divided into two \\"halves\\", with \\"Anasthasia\\" and \\"Deep Folk Song\\" both flawlessly seguing into their next tracks. (This is also how I remember the cassette tape version being organized on each side.)<br /><br />Most tracks have a danceable hip-hop rhythm and skillfully sequenced bassline, altho if you need a break from that and want to delve into some beautiful piano magic with the talented Marta, \\"Bulgarian Melody\\" must be heard -- a shining virtuoso composition!<br /><br />The album closes off with the title track \\"Boheme\\", which pits a warbling, saw wave-derived melody (which is at once obviously electronic yet so organic) vs. more folk singing. Unlikely combination, but it works in an emotional, uplifting way. There's lilts of sadness in it too, which can be stereotypically tough to pull off when using electronic sounds, but Deep Forest succeed again and again!<br /><br />LOWBLIGHTS: I find it very difficult to scrutinize this album, and I'm very critical of the music I listen to. If I had to list a disappointment, it'd be that the followup album, Comparsa, was elementarily rich but lacked the compositional greateness Boheme has, and set the high bar for: Comparsa doesn't flow as well and the songs by themselves aren't as catchy.<br /><br />OVERALL INSIGHT: Want to experience the best of machine music with human vocals from around the globe? This is a must-buy!

B00026KDC2|4.0|If it's true imitation is indeed the sincerest form of flattery, \\"A Bit of What You Fancy\\" finds The London Quireboys practically down on their knees fellating the Stones, Faces, Mott the Hoople, and various members of Slade, Humble Pie, and the Spiders from Mars.  Then, despite all the sweaty effort, everything gets half-inched by the Black Crowes anyway, the brothers Robinson unceremoniously stealing their thunder and leaving them choking on the afterburn.    It's hard to believe these guys allegedly turfed Wildhearts front man Ginger from the fold for excessive sozzling, snorting, and generally fulfilling all requirements of the job description because this album is a party waiting to happen, the best night of your life, the last day of school, getting your cherry popped, and winning the lottery all wrapped up into one tidy package, time warped in the early 1970's and blissfully unconcerned with anything outside of magical raunch chords, nasty thoughts, and haystack haircuts.    It's easy, lazy, and unimaginative to play spot the influences on \\"A Bit of What You Fancy,\\" but it's also inevitable, especially when Chris Johnstone's jangle-jump piano references Ian McLagan to kick start album opener \\"7 O'Clock.\\"  The strep throat of Spot is a dead ringer for the rough-and-tumble of Rod Stewart circa 1971, \\"Sweet Mary Ann\\" and \\"Roses & Rings\\" sharing more than just a few of the rapidly deteriorating genetic strands of those early solo albums and owing a mighty debt to that hoary old classic rock staple \\"Maggie May.\\"  \\"Long Time Comin'\\" welds Mott's \\"The Golden Age of Rock & Roll\\" to \\"Stay With Me,\\" the foot taps out of habit, and pfooot! you're history.     It's one thing to cop your favorite 70's act and then present it as a pastel copy, but it takes skill to make it sound like a whiff of fresh air and the Quireboys shovel it out as good as it ever gets on three songs which toe the line between slavish imitation and outright genius, managing to look down their noseson just about anything released during the wretched 90's without breaking a sweat.  \\"Hey You,\\" \\"Misled,\\" and \\"There She Goes Again\\" are the nosh and tipple of The Faces done to damn near perfection, nothing shockingly original but delivered with enough enthusiasm, verve, vigor, and hooky swagger to leave you wondering how you've done without it for this long.    And then they were gone...

031606792X|2.0|I never really write reviews, but I  was so disappointed with this book, I felt the need to share.  I really enjoyed the first three books, but this book was contrived and simplistic since the first few pages.  It sent a very poor message to teenagers about life.  Everything was wrapped up so neatly and perfectly that it felt like a fanfiction.  I found myself constantly rolling my eyes as every little thing worked out so well.  I also don't like that Bella is so needy that she can't have a personality for herself...she is Edward's shadow.  Overall it was a huge letdown.  It ruined the entire series for me.
B001BGTWXI|4.0|You know exactly the album I'm talking about.  The one that all bands who last longer than one or two albums go through.  The one that signals a kind of change, possibly.  But also one that does something as old as time itself: divides fans, but also attracts new fans, like me.      While I share a similar taste in music, Slipknot hasn't always been for me.  A lot of people like their thrash songs, whereas I need a bit more diversity.  And so while I've listened to their previous albums, enjoyed particular songs, I've never had the patience to listen to a whole album.  Until now.      All Hope is Gone feels, in some ways, a culmination of everything that's come before; the sometimes melodic nature of Subliminal Verses, the pounding nature of their earlier work in Iowa, with, yes, maybe a smidgen of Stone Sour on the side.  The thing is, when Slipknot isn't trying to pound you silly with their music for a dozen or so songs, they can be quite enjoyable.      For me, All Hope is Gone picks up right as \\"Psychosocial\\" comes into play.  This song, the album version which rocks so much more than the \\"radio-friendly\\" version released as a single, exemplifies their nature perfectly: precision trash metal, with an actual melodic hook and a melody that carries through.      But the diversity continues, with \\"Gehenna\\" verging into atmospheric territories that sounds reminiscient of a heavier/more technical Korn.  And \\"Vendetta\\"'s rousing anthem chant of \\"Are you ready for the time of your life,\\" answered by shouts...perfect live material at shows.  Then, of course, there's the Slipknot ballad (how surprising is that?) \\"Snuff,\\" the song which will invariably have critics calling it a Stone Sour song with heavier drumming.      Don't get me wrong; there's still plenty of thrash songs with the barking vocals and the precision drumming, pounding submission into your head.  It's just that there's more here than that.  This is the first Slipknot album in which I believe Slipknot hasfound their niche.  They've found a way of distancing themselves from similar acts that stretches beyond wearing masks (which, as an aside, are much better than their previous ones).      So we come full circle.  This album will possibly be a divisive one for some fans.  But I believe it shows growth, maturity and a willingness to look beyond one song played twelve different ways.  Your appreciation may very, but I like this new Slipknot.      Songs to listen to:    \\"Gematria (The Killing Name)\\"   \\"Psychosocial\\"  \\"Gehenna\\"  \\"This Cold Black\\"  \\"Snuff\\"
B000V86OKG|5.0|I've already mentioned my tenuous link to the Dexter crew in my review of Season One, so I'll just skip to why I love this show so much: because it's fearless.<br /><br />This season takes many of the established tropes that make Dexter's life (Michael C. Hall) as a vigilante/serial killer plausible and tosses them out the window.  Everything that was a minor annoyance in the first season is amped up to 11. Dexter's dumping ground for corpses, a quaint little spot in the ocean that nobody ever noticed, gets noticed.  Officer Doakes (Erik King), who was openly hostile to Dexter, becomes a very real threat.  Harry's Code, which keeps Dexter on the mostly-straight and somewhat-narrow path, comes into question. LaGuerta (Lauren Velez) stoops to new lows to get her old job back.  And Dexter's sister Debra (Jennifer Carpenter), who was always annoying to begin with, moves in with him to become even more annoying.<br /><br />The show doesn't forget its past.  Debra is traumatized by the fact that she almost married a serial killer; the characters regularly forget the incident and stumble over apologies as they make insensitive remarks. Dexter greatly misses his serial-killer brother, the only person who understood him.  Until he finds a new soul mate: Lila (Jaime Murray).<br /><br />Lila seems to rub a lot of people the wrong way (or the right way, if you like brunettes).  She's gorgeous in a goth fashion, completely uninhibited, and madly in love with the Dexter she doesn't see. She's also a complete loon.  All these attributes make her a perfect fit for Dexter...except Dexter is very much a family man, a killer who would never harm children, who despite his violent excesses surrounds himself with the trappings of family.  Lila throws in sharp relief what vestiges of Dexter's personality are decent, and as such she's a perfect foil for season 2.<br /><br />The other breakout character is Doakes.  Once Doakes unearths Dexter's past, the two come to an understanding.  Throughout the season are philosophical arguments that detail each man's past in a game of one-upmanship.  Who is worse: the special ops soldier who murders people he's ordered to kill, or the vigilante who uses free will to determine whom he executes? We don't get a clear answer, only more questions.<br /><br />There are some entertaining nods to the field of serial killer investigation.  Don Foster ([[ASIN:0805063579 Author Unknown: On the Trail of Anonymous]]) gets a shout-out...and is soundly, brutally mocked for his language analysis, sorry Don. So does Bob Ressler ([[ASIN:0312950446 Whoever Fights Monsters]]) in the form of Special Agent Frank Lundy (Keith Carradine). An awkward but believable subplot develops between Lundy and Debra, just further exemplifying that none of Dexter's heroes are one-dimensional, but fully developed and all too humanly flawed.<br /><br />We tore through this season on our Netflix list, clearing out our queue to ensure we could watch all the DVDs back to back.

0307155102|5.0|My 17month daughter loves this book! I was into Richard Scarry books growing up and really wanted my baby to like it. Initially I was afraid the illustrations would be too busy for her, but that is clearly not the case. This book is one of three books (the others are big book of animals and book of words) she brings to me just about every thirty minutes, which is driving me a little crazy but I'll just have to deal with it. She really gets into the scenes especially scenes of the circus, zoo, farm, grocery, home, beach, ships, trains, etc. and has built up quite the vocabulary.  She's saying the names of the animals and their sounds, bodyparts, the landscape such as tree, sun, moon, cloud, flower and can point to most anything in the pages.  The scenes of the airport, trucks and \\"when you grow up\\" aren't engaging her yet but I'm sure later when she gets it more.      Richard Scarry books are a beloved classic, they are and will be on the bookshelf in our home (until the grandkids).  ;)
B000T9OP7G|5.0|I've really fallen for this show.  I think the program is solidly cast with some great actors; the action scenes are realistic, good scripts, and a lot of fun to watch.  It turned out to be more than I expected (I didn't expect much), and it's now become one of my favorite shows on television at the moment.  SO many police and lawyer procedural shows are now on, I look forward to the escapism this show provides.  No bad dreams.  Lena Headey is fantastic, as is, well all four of the major players are excellent.  Highly recommend, especially if your getting a bit stale on CSI's, Police dramas, half-hour comedies and Lawyer programs.  It's wonderful to see great SciFi coming back to television again.  This CD set is definitely worth owning, and has a lot of extras.
B0002199H2|5.0|[[ASIN:B0002199H2 The Miles Davis and Gil Evans: Complete Columbia Studio Recordings]] box set is a treasure trove for those who must have every recording.  Less serious fans may want to start with less expensive issues of the individual albums.<br /><br />Miles Davis has many box sets devoted to him, and this one is by far the most unique.  After purchasing several of the Miles Davis box sets that have been re-released by Columbia, I have to say that I am very pleased.  Eventually I will get them all, but my love of Gil Evans in addition to Miles is what made me pull the trigger on this set.<br /><br />For starters, what comes through this set even with a casual listen is the incredible influence that Gil had on the arrangements and approach taken during their greatest collaborations.  On many of the tracks, the horn arrangements and solos are pushed center stage, with Gil's play only providing a subtle backdrop.  That's typical Gil, though I do wonder what the outcome might have been if he had allowed himself to step forward more in those early years.<br /><br />Still, the tracks manage to be both incredibly traditional and daring at the same time, and this especially true of the alternate takes.  Once you hear the alternate takes, rehearsal tracks, and overdubs it's clear that the sound has to be in large part to Gil's credit.  In fact, the only way to describe the sound on some of these tracks is *large*.  The encyclopedic inclusion of various alternate takes and rehearsal takes provides tremendous insight and could easily be used by students of this music and history who want to get inside the minds of these recording artists and compare against the final product.<br /><br />That's another reason why this reissue is so worth getting.  While I have no complaints about the original recordings, several of the tracks are so greatly improved by the remastering to almost make the listening experience completely new for me.  I am slowly being converted to the remastering camp.  If all the reissued box sets sound this good, I may start to purchase multiple copies of each of them.  :)<br /><br />I was somewhat confused by the *placement* of many of the tracks, especially the way certain retakes are split between different disks.  At times they correspond to the original albums and at other times they don't.  I don't know why Mr. Schaap chose to do it this way, but I am pretty certain there were very good reasons.  It does make you wonder, but it doesn't change the fact that these are very listenable disks.<br /><br />Now because this is a set of the complete studio recordings, there are some tracks here that I am not particularly crazy about.  Among them are \\"Blue Xmas\\" and \\"Nothing Like You.\\"  Those tracks made me glad that not every song on here has alternate and rehearsal takes included.<br /><br />The box is certainly attractive, though understated.  It is certainly more durable and functional than other recent boxes I have purchased.<br /><br />As with all Miles Davis sessions under Columbia, these recordings showcase fantastic musicians.  [[ASIN:B000002AGM Miles Ahead]] and [[ASIN:B000HBK1UQ Porgy and Bess]] are clearly the most highly regarded albums that resulted from Gil's work with Miles, but [[ASIN:B000002AH7 Sketches of Spain]] will probably always be my personal favorite of the group.  I am also a fond of [[ASIN:B0009J8H84 Quiet Nights]], which has probably been over-criticized IMHO.  Yet the extra takes means that even if you own those albums you still have a very good reason to purchase this set.<br /><br />If you haven't yet purchased this set, take this opportunity to add it to your collection.<br /><br />Enjoy!ing camp.

[[ASIN:B000002AGM Miles Ahead]] and [[ASIN:B000HBK1UQ Porgy and Bess]] are clearly the most highly regarded albums that resulted from Gil's work with Miles, but [[ASIN:B000002AH7 Sketches of Spain]] will probably always be my personal favorite of the group.  I am also a fond of [[ASIN:B0009J8H84 Quiet Nights]], which has probably been over-criticized IMHO.  Yet the extra takes means that even if you own those albums you still have a very good reason to purchase this set.<br /><br />If you haven't yet purchased this set, take this opportunity to add it to your collection.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B000AYEL6U|5.0|Great adaptation of a classic novel.  While the movie added some scenes that werent in the novel, it kept the essence - enjoyed the last scene very much!  I didnt think of Margaret quite as she was pictured but overall well done.  Richard Armitage is so brooding in the role and has a voice that melts hearts - a perfect fit for this part.  Casting, locations, scenes - all so entertaining and kept my attention.
0385340990|2.0|This novel is comprised of a series of letters from a developing group of friends. The main character is a writer whose editor is an old friend, the brother of another friend, and a quietly jealous observer of the main character's growing attachment for another admirer.<br /><br />While I admit to some curiosity about some decisions the main character has to make about her tragic past and the consequences of a newly-ended war in the present, I just felt this novel could have been a bit more \\"evolved\\" about its approach to religion. The slams are frequent and harsh, and you get the sense there's a strong anti-religious crusade that is always vying for your attention so you can't really pay attention to the story itself. And it ruins all the fun. It's like baking a roast in the oven and garnishing it and presenting it with thoughtful perfection, only for your guest to discover you used sugar instead of salt to season it. It seems in the 21st century we're all expected to be a bit more tolerant and sensitive than that. I just got tired of it. It marred what could have been a very nice work.<br /><br />So what did this fictional writer with the sharp wit and a penchant for launching projectiles (books, teapots...)at her book-reading audiences decide about her seething disdain for the pursuit of a better life?<br /><br />I just couldn't tolerate the slams long enough to find out. A pity.
1591841984|3.0|We got this book to read and discuss as part of a Book discussion we have every once in a while where I work.<br /><br />The book is nice and well written.  Funny where it needs to be.  However, it seems that the author is just too in love with Steve.  I know the man can inspire a lot of people, but the fact that he was basically licking his boots at some points was kind of annoying (to me at least).<br /><br />If you decide to filter this out, this is a good read-and-then-sell book.
B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|This review will not speak to Director Zach Snyder's excellent handling of the superb (Frank Miller graphic novel) source material, nor will it speak to the tremendous job done by the cast of highly skilled, excellent actors.    Rather, my intended purpose is to briefly describe the movie experience after having watched/ heard it on blu-ray and in uncompressed 5.1 PCM surround sound.  One word: brilliant.    Video: I have no idea what many reviewers here refer to when they say the blu-ray version is, visually, no better than, or on par with the DVD version.  This is simply not the case.      The blu-ray version, visually speaking, outshines the DVD version by far; the level of depth, color, contrast,and overall tonal quality is spectacular.  Every environment in the film, while intensely stylized and computer-generated, is not *obviously* computer-generated.  In fact, nearly every scene looks like a perfect melding of a fantastic painting and reality, but visually leaning moreso towards reality.    Audio: As cliche as it sounds (so to speak), this soundtrack has to be heard (on the proper equipment) to be believed.  The score is sweeping and majestic, the dialogue is pinpoint tight in it's aural focus and delivery, and the battle scenes deliver a brutally visceral audio impact so intense it made this reviewer shriek and gleefully erupt like a little Spartan girl (which is incredible, given that the reviewer is actually a little boy, and not a Spartan).      Do yoursef a favor and pick up this movie right away, but play it only AFTER you've acquired and had properly set-up: a 1080P HDTV, an amplifier capable of decoding and/or playing back the movie's 5.1 uncompressed soundtrack, and a decent 5.1 (or better) speaker setup.    Now, sit back with some popcorn (or some gyros), and ENJOY!
B000NA2BEU|4.0|It was... ok. TV always has that problem where the beginning of the show is fantastic but anything after that, not so much. That's exactly the case with Veronica Mars Season 3. I mean its still worth watching, maybe just once though.

B000KGGB2A|5.0|I've known of Take That since their first time around in the 90's. I discovered them while vacationing in Italy - saw them on MTV in my hotel room.  Heard this amazing voice singing the all-time great song \\"Back For Good\\" and looked into the eyes of Gary Barlow. It's been love ever since! I spent $3000 to go see them in concert on NYE in London - waited 12 years for that!     I'm so pleased to see that so many new US fans have discovered them. Watch out for their next album due out Xmas of 2008 and followed with another European tour! Unfortunately we probably won't get them over here since the talks are that this will be their last.    Be sure to check out Robbie Williams too. For those of you who don't know, he used to be part of Take That.
B00005UW7V|5.0|This movie was supposed to be done by Stanley Kubrick but he died before it was complete. As a Kubrick film, one should know what to expect, but add in Steven Spielberg and the effect is warmer and still unsettling.<br />Just a side issue: I would have preferred a wide-screen version, but this is still a fine addition to my Kubrick collection. I pair it with other robot movies like  \\"I Robot\\" (I know... Asimov) and \\"Space Odyssey:2001\\" or \\"Bicentennial Man\\" for a fun popcorn night. What more could we want for a post-apocalyptic- dystopia night?

B000RPTQ1C|5.0|Coldplay - Viva La Vida (2008)<br /><br />It's really weird how the same music can affect different people in such radically different ways. The varied opinions of VIVA LA VIDA on this forum are striking. I've never really considered myself to be much of a Coldplay fan (was always more into Radiohead, by comparison) but - wow! - they really won me over on this one. I took a liking to it immediately.<br /><br />Every song here is top quality and every song is expertly composed and orchestrated. Major props to Brian Eno whose production style is clearly evident. The musicians are never flashy - every instrument serves to compliment Chris Martin's superb vocal melodies. Chris has grown quite a bit as a vocalist and he sings in surprisingly different ways throughout the album.<br /><br />Even though there are no mind-blowing solos or proggy freak-outs to be heard, the arrangements are sophisticated and reveal greater depth upon repeated listens. The instrumentation and musical textures are varied and engaging, yet the songs breathe naturally. Nothing feels contrived or forced.<br /><br />No song on VIVA LA VIDA sticks out or dominates like previous pop juggernaut \\"Clocks.\\" Rather, the album works as a cohesive whole. As with most any group, echos of influence can be detected, yet the album still feels original rather than derivative. \\"Cemetaries of London\\" employs a rhythm reminiscent of an old sea shanty while \\"Yes\\" makes use of a Middle Eastern sounding violin before it launches off on an exuberant alt-rock tangent to close out the track. Meanwhile, \\"Violet Hill\\" sounds kinda like the best Supertramp or updated old-school Genesis song you've never heard (it's way better than those groups but employs their same sort of style). And the beautifully orchestrated \\"Strawberry Swing\\" is \\"feel-good\\" music of the highest order. In fact, this whole album feels so good it practically makes me high (well, not quite!). This despite some of the rather dark subject matter including politics, war, religion and death. I also love the luminous opening instrumental track whose synthesizer reappears at the end of the last song, a nice way to bookend the album and add to its cohesiveness.<br /><br />Coldplay had some great hit songs on A RUSH OF BLOOD TO THE HEAD, but I didn't know they (along with Eno and some other first-rate producers) could make an entire record this fantastic. I expect to be listening to VIVA LA VIDA years from now. Highly recommended! Oh, and I'll have to go back and give X&Y another chance. I heard it once and wasn't turned on by it at all, but maybe I just need to give it some more listens.<br /><br />AN ASIDE: yet another FN CD booklet with scrawled, obscured, incomplete and barely legible lyrics and other writing. This highly annoying practice has been around for decades and why anyone ever thought it was a good idea in the first place is beyond me. I'm also not too crazy about the cover, taking a classic painting and trashing it with graffiti. But that doesn't bother me nearly as much as the junky words all over the inside of the CD booklet. C'mon people: either publish your lyrics legibly and in their entirety or don't publish them at all. Don't make us strain our eyes trying to figure out what, if anything, you're trying to say in print. CD booklet rating: Dpolitics, war, religion and death.

1573229725|1.0|I don't like writing negative reviews.  Really, I don't. ----Except, that is, for books such as this one which fully deserve it.  Fingersmith is, to be brief, a sump of slipshod writing, contrived plotting, bogus atmospherics and two dimensional characters.  If we are at the point where this can be considered as anything approaching Dickens or The Brontes, as so many of the professional reviewers do on the back cover and the opening pages, then we have reached a low point indeed in literary valuation. ----As a test, pick any page from Charlotte Bronte's masterwork, Villette, concerning its heroine Lucy Snow, and compare it to any of the pages here concerning Maud or Sue, and you shall behold the clear difference.  You may still prefer Maud and Sue and Fingersmith, but that is rather a judgment on you than on Bronte.  My guess, though, is that most reviewers here haven't even read Bronte unless they were forced to do so by an English teacher.<br /><br />Outraged readers will no doubt want to know what I mean by slipshod writing since they, to my disbelief, refer to it as \\"wonderful,\\" \\"beautiful,\\" \\"skillful\\" and other such superlatives.  Let's take Sue's character, shall we?  The girl was brought up in an environment wherein she didn't even learn to write her own name, and yet, she mouths utterances such as, \\"I was, not to put too fine a point on it, properly funked.\\" P.423 This is, not to put too fine a point on it, the voice of an educated person like Sarah Waters with a slangy flair to it, not Sue, or Susan, or whatever name you want to call her by the end.  Sue also mentions Helen of Troy as if she has read The Iliad and many other incongruous things besides that beggar belief.<br /><br />My real problem with the book though is that it is so unchallenging as well as unentertaining.  To plough through this book is to be exposed, time and again, to man's inhumanity to man, man's inhumanity to woman, woman's inhumanity to woman - especially in the madhouse, and so on.  My only feeling after finishing it was a relief at not having to read any more about comic book characters about whom I couldn't care two shillings put through a Victorian meat grinder, which is no less brutal than the Twenty-First Century version of it.<br /><br />My final exhortation to the prospective reader: Read the Brontes, read Dickens (particularly Bleak House), read George Eliot, read Thomas Hardy (esp. Jude the Obscure), read, in short, the real thing rather than this, sadly, uninspired and uninspiring literary throwback that, as Sarah Waters has said, arose out of her doctoral studies on Victorian pornography..

B000X5SPBI|5.0|So i just recieved mine in the mail today since i preordered it i ended up paying $36.99 which is great considering everywhere else its being listed as 38 or 39 dollars. i cant wait to start watching all the episodes. ive already got the first two seasons which ive watched all the way through and even got my boyfriend to watch a few episodes with me :) but now ive finally got the 3rd season so i can finally catch up on it. unfortunately i missed alot of episodes for this season because of work but the ones i did get to catch were great! i really disliked Bella, she just didnt work for me in this show, but Ruby, i really loved Ruby i thought she really added something extra to the show and Katie Cassidy did a good job portraying her. The episode i most look forward to watching is Bad Day At Black Rock. I just couldnt stop laughing during that episode! Sam losing his shoe, Dean tossing the pen into the gun barrel and saying \\"im Batman\\"...PRICELESS!!! lol gotta love the Winchester boys! Although the writers strike killed this season having a few more episodes (THANKS ALOT! GRRR) it still seemed to be able to make it through. They seemed to understand not to cut down on quality and have one of those crappy season finales because they didnt have enough episodes to get it to become a great one, no they overcame it and still ended it with a bang! and a very shocking one at that. like i said, i did miss quite a few episodes but this is one of my 3 favorite shows of all time (Roswell & Veronica Mars being the other 2) and i am soooo glad that we didnt end up with this being the last season for the show. finally a show that i love has broken the 3 season curse!

B00008LOS1|5.0|I like the Deluxe Edition packaging in general, and the remix on the original album tracks is superb. I do have one complaint: MCA needs to release one CD of all of The Who's 1971 Olympic recordings. The Who cut 17 songs (that were eventually released) as part of the Who's Next sessions at Olympic Studios for an intended double album, and they all sound fantastic. The Who never sounded better than they did on these tracks, with Glyn Johns producing and giving the excellent band performances a remarkably clean sound (compare Quadrophenia, where the band's sound tended to be washed out by the brass arrangements), and with the great Nicky Hopkins providing brilliant piano work which makes several songs by itself .  In fact, it is difficult for me to say that the tracks that made it on to the album are much better than the ones left off-- Pure and Easy is a masterpiece, and the others aren't far behind. These tracks are, in short, the Holy Grail for anyone who appreciates the Who; the band simply never sounded better.    Townshend has said that, with the Lifehouse concept scrapped, he wanted to avoid making an unfocused double album ala the White Album. In hindsight, however, the 16 tracks collectively would have constituted the Who's most consistent and listenable double album musically, if not their most conceptually ambitious (both Tommy with its instrumentals and Quadrophenia with its overblown arrangements are sometimes difficult to listen to end-to-end). The songs from the Olympic Sessions each have a depth, power, and subtlety not found on other Who tracks or indeed really anywhere else.    For the record, here are the eight \\"lost\\" Who's Next tracks to which I am referring. They are not all easily available, by the way, and the obscurity into which they've fallen annoys me because had they been on the original album they'd have become fan favorites if not AOR radio hits:    1. Pure and Easy (on the Ultimate Collection; released originally on the 1974 Odds & Sodsalbum, which is unfortunate because it is neither an odd nor a sod but rather one of Townshend's finest songs)  2. Let's See Action (the Ultimate Collection) (not released in the U.S. until it was included on the cash-in Hooligans compilation album in 1981)  3. Naked Eye (Odds & Sods) (Good live version on the Deluxe Edition bonus CD, although I like the studio version better for the reasons I generally prefer the studio versions of these tracks: Johns's production and the piano part).  4. Too Much of Anything (Odds & Sods) (the live version on the Deluxe Edition bonus CD is not good at all and put me off of the song until I heard the studio version, which is far, far superior.)  5. Water (bonus track on the Odds & Sods CD reissue; first released in 1973 as the b-side of the \\"5:15\\" single. There is a passable live version on the Deluxe Edition bonus CD which goes on too long).  6. I Don't Even Know Myself (bonus track on the 1995 Who's Next CD reissue; first released in 1971 as the b-side of the \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\" single. The Deluxe Edition bonus CD has an excellent live version of this song, but the studio version is slightly better.)  7. When I Was a Boy (a fine Entwistle song: it doesn't rock as hard as \\"My Wife\\", but is a nice song reminiscent of the later \\"905\\" on \\"Who Are You\\", and it brings to bear the trademark Entwistle dark perspective which was so important in leavening Townshend's sometime tendency towards pretentiousness. I don't think When I Was a Boy is available anywhere now besides some out-of-print compilation CDs and LPs; it was first released in the U.S. on the now out-of-print Join Together compilation album in the early 1980s.)  8. There is also an Olympic Studio version of Time Is Passing, available as a bonus track on Odds & Sods. This studio version is the only one which lags behind the live version on the Deluxe Edition bonus CD in quality; the studio version has a goofy synth part appended to the end of the track, and the performanceon the live version is tougher-sounding).

B000002J0B|5.0|There is no doubt that Houses of the Holy lacked the impact of Led Zeppelin IV; there is also no doubt that Zeppelin fans loved this album as they loved all of the band's work. In short, Houses of the Holy is neither the band's best nor worst album, but fans will find all of these songs to be essential to a complete understanding of Led Zeppelin.    However, there is a certain flatness about the studio versions of many of the songs on \\"Houses of the Holy\\" when one compares them to available live versions. For example, both \\"The Song Remains the Same\\" and \\"The Rain Song\\" are much more bombastic and powerful on the \\"The Song Remains the Same\\" live album than they are here. The same can be said for the brilliant extended version of \\"No Quarter\\" on \\"The Song Remains the Same\\" in comparison to the one here. The version of \\"Over the Hills\\" on \\"How The West Was Won\\" rocks much harder than this one. Finally, \\"The Crunge\\" sounds much better played live as a change of pace as part of the extended \\"Dazed and Confused\\" on HTWWW than it does here, with Jones's showy and utterly superfluous synth part and Plant's silly lyrics appended.    That leaves \\"Dancing Days\\", \\"D'yer Mak'er\\", and \\"The Ocean\\" to recommend \\"Houses of the Holy\\" as a studio album. These are each brilliant songs, with \\"Dancing Days\\" among the most affecting and enduring in the Zep catalogue (I love the synth part on the last verse in the \\"Houses of the Holy\\" version), \\"D'yer Mak'er\\" a hard-rocking reggae track which was foolishly dismissed by critics at the time for not being \\"authentic\\" but which in retrospect showed reggae's crossover potential, and \\"The Ocean\\" featuring one of the most distinctive guitar riffs in rock history.

B001EO748M|5.0|I have only the highest praise for season 2 of The Tudors. I don't want to give away spoilers by going into the plot. Yes, it is history which we all pretty much know. But it is amazing to see it played out in front of you with 3 dimsional characters that make the facts take a life of their own.<br /><br />The presentation is glorious. The scenery, costumes and all to do with the time period is breath taking and expertly done. And the acting is of the highest caliber.<br /><br />I find complaints people have had with this season to be rather minimal. Anyone can take a masterpiece and have something with it that does not please them. For me everything about this show gives it an A +++++. King Henry and Anne Boleyn are the center here but all the other historical pieces are expertly put in.<br /><br />I am amazed how the show manages to show history so true to fact, true to life and mezmerizing to view. Season 2 is an entity to itself and such ensemble acting is rare to find. View this and you will see only the highest quality television available, refresh your history knowledge and see the best acting out there.<br /><br />Kudos.

031606792X|5.0|I did enjoy the book.  It was a little too pat but it made me happy.  I would really like to read more about Renesme and Jacob so, though this is the last of the Twilight series, I hope that Stephanie will someday tell their story.    Also, I hope that Stephanie won't allow the carelessness of one person get in the way of telling Edward's story.  It says volumes about an author when she can tell the same story from a different point of view and still captivate.  What an innovative, ground breaking idea!  Stephanie - please finish it;-)     P.S. Read \\"The Host\\"!  Wow!  Wonderful story, can't wait for the sequels!
1416524800|4.0|I enjoy thrillers generally and am willing to suspend belief when it comes to works of fiction, so some of the things that other reviewers mentioned about some of the reaches did not bother me that much, but some did.<br /><br />This book started off very well.  The first few pages had me hooked, and had to finish off.  The story went well for awhile but started to tail off.  I found the anciallary charactors actually more enjoyable than the main ones, with one of the scientists being particularly good alebit a bit cliche.  The main charactors by and large did not \\"grab me\\" as much.  The television personality was good, the senator's daughter okay (started off strong then tailed), the senator and his aid never was enamored of, the President was okay.<br /><br />The book did let me down though as the action really progressed - in other words when the scientists make some further discoverys.  Just a tad bit over the top.  Do not want to play spoiler on this, but will leave it as that there was too much extreme things happening at convienent times with mother nature.  Just a bit forced overall and some gaps in the flow of the story to me.  I liked the idea and some places alot, others not so much.<br /><br />Overall it was okay reading, good for plane flights, but I would recommend Brown's other books more.  There there are general parallels in some plot points with the Da Vinci Code, I found the Da Vinci Code more enjoyable in terms of the writing and charactors.

0385338724|4.0|Honestly, when I'm reading fiction, I only judge a book by how entertaining it is.  I'm fairly educated, but unless I'm reading the classics, or at least higher-brow fiction like John Irving or Wally Lamb, I don't rip a book apart based on story structure, continuity, believablity, or even character development.  I know they're important, but I don't really care.  There have been times I've loved books that had no strengths in these areas, and books I've hated that have had all of them.  SOmetimes, I don't even know why I dislike them--even if the plot appeals to me, I either get into a book or I don't, and I can't put my finger on why.<br />So, I'm not even going to get into Kinsella's habit of creating one dimensional characters, or their unbelievability, or that they weren't given their full potential.  Her books are entertaining as hell, and that's all I care about.<br />Remember Me? wasn't as good as her others.  I've already re-read it, it's not awful, but it just fell a little flat--maybe as one of those \\"Gotta meet my deadline when I have so many better things to do\\" books.  Everyone that has a favorite author has had to deal with one of these--when the author's heart just isn't in it.  I think that's what happened here.  Lexi wasn't the type of character I could be invested in--I'd love to hang out with Becky Bloomwood and Emma Corrington, even have afew drinks with Samantha Sweeting.  Lexi just seemed weak and depressed, and the famous Kinsella humor failed to inject her with any warmth.<br />My main issues--<br />For one thing, I --SPOILER ALERT--wish her memory had returned.<br />I NEVER understood the whole marriage thing.  I know she --SPOILER ALERT--struggled with her father screwing her family financially, but she was obviously successful in her own right, why marry a guy that prints invoices for his own wife?  How could she have stomached the Monte Blanc in the first place?<br />And, my main problem--why the infedility in the first place?  They never explained it.  Okay, the sunflowers showed they had obviously been at it quite awhile, and the fact that Lexi was her \\"real self\\" over there shows she never drank the Kool-Aid.  She obviously didn't love her husband--why wait so long to leave him?  It didn't make sense.he sunflowers showed they had obviously been at it quite awhile, and the fact that Lexi was her \\"real self\\" over there shows she never drank the Kool-Aid.

031606792X|5.0|A critic can call a book escapist.  What that really means to me is that is so well written that the story truly draws you in.  There is a delicate balance between writing enough detail that you feel like your there and writing so many details that it just takes forever to read.  Reading shouldn't feel like work, you're supposed to enjoy what you read.  Ignore that critic!! This book was amazing.  We can only hope that Midnight Sun will meet the printing press.

You will fall in love with the characters from the very beginning.  It really makes you think about how we treat our loved ones & how time can slip away so fast.  I know this is cliche but I laughed, I cried.  Enzo will melt your heart & make you wish you could follow him wherever he goes.
B0009SS00A|2.0|While all of Brown's books are very entertaining I found Digital Fortress to be slow and monotonous.  I felt as though Brown was trying to fill up space in several scenes especially at the end.  He goes at length to describe the simplest things creating a lot of overkill.  With The Davinci Code, Angels and Demons, and Deception Point I never wanted to skip chapters just to avoid reading something I had already read.  I found myself constantly avoiding the urge to \\"fast forward\\".  Not one of Brown's best and I certainly would not call it a page turner.
B000P2A24W|5.0|This is my first Bon Jovi album that I bought.  I've always been a fan of the band ever since I first heard \\"Livin On A Prayer\\" when I was really young.  I liked their sound and even though it's changed a bit since their hits in the 80's it's still a welcome return from one of my favorite bands.  Some have called this album \\"Bon Jovi goes country.\\"  While not entirely true, there is some country aspects to this album such as the duet with LeAnn Rimes and a collaboration with Big And Rich.  My favorite song is the single \\"(You Want To) Make A Memory.\\"  It was one of my favorite singles of 2007!  Bon Jovi had a lot to prove with this album and I would definately reccomend it to Bon Jovi fans old and new.  I look forward to buying more music from this band!

1401216676|4.0|You must buy it for the artwork.  It the most beautiful artwork I ever seen in a Batman book.  I read a review here saying the recoloring in this book is bad.  This reviewer is so wrong.  Recoloring this book is the best thing that ever happened!  I literally compare the original with this book side by side before I made the purchase and it is night and day!  In this book, Brian Bolland, joins among the great Batman artists such as Jim Lee and Neal Adams.  Spectacular artwork, extremely clean and sharp with rich colors.  The story on the other hand, I do not appreciate as much as other people may have, because while it gives the Joker some background as to how and why he became the Joker, I'm not sure that I would want to know since it is the mystery of the Joker that makes him creepy and scary.  The Joker is also quite sinister in this book and no doubt, a book that really pays tribute to him compare to Loeb's books which depicts the Joker as a bumbling idiot.  The story is pretty straight-forward and easy read which is quite uncharacteristic of Moore (I have to look twice at the cover to make sure he wrote this), and disappointingly, not witty at all which I would expect from this author.
B00005JPY0|5.0|When I saw batman begins a few years ago I was greatly disappointed. The movie was boring and I fell asleep. I forced myself out of my house and dragged my body to the theater to see Dark Knight. All my friends said it was good even though they like horrible flicks I still went.  BAM! Straight in my face, from the beginning I was on the edge of my seat. Cristian Bale is not my favorite batman but he sort of manages to pull it off.   When I knew heath ledger was in this movie I didn't know what to expect. He did an excellent job of playing the psychotic joker.  This movie was dark and violent and it grasped the concept of choas and a hero to keep it in check.   I hope they choose the riddler for the next film. Then the movie quote will be \\"Riddle me this\\" instead of \\"why so serious?\\"    DC comics released Dark Knight graphic novels back in the 90's. So keep the ignorance to a minimum
1563894696|3.0|This is a very popular graphic novel as it is first in the Halloween series that attempts to continue what Miller left off in Year One.  These stories chronicle the early years of Batman as more of a detective than a superhero fighting crime.  He fights crime as well in this book and battles pretty much all the popular villains such as Joker, Riddler, and Two-face.  This book also includes the famous story of Dent's transformation to Two-face.  If you like a lot of plot twists and turns, very typical of crime mysteries, then you will enjoy this book.  I'm not too big on such complicated plots and like a more focused straight-forward, although witty plot.  In addition, it does not make sense how Batman battles all the villains with ease with the exception of Two-face.  Given this takes place during his second year, it is not realistic how he trashes, for instance, the Joker in a page or two.  The movie is more realistic as it depicts Batman struggling in desperation to defeat the Joker, the most popular villain of the whole franchise.  Ultimately, too much focus was placed in the mystery story, which a lot of people seem to enjoy, and on the character, Harvey Dent, leaving the rest of the villains as filler.

1401207529|5.0|If you ever want to know how Bruce Wayne became Batman, you come to the right book.  This book chronicles Batman's origin as well as the origin of his relationship with Gordon.  They are basically the main characters in this book and although there are no real villains in this book, it is a great character piece on the lives of these characters, their trials and tribulations, and their struggles and how they are able to overcome or succumb to them.  Although not as epic as The Dark Knight Returns, it is a close second.  But artwork is just horrendous.

B000VI70WM|5.0|4,5 stars.<br />I always had very mixed feelings about Duran Duran. They were the ultimate 80's band, and I HATE 80's music, and Duran Duran recorded som stinkers in their heyday (Wild Boys, anyone?). But if you look back, they've also managed to write a dozen (or so) rather classy pop songs during their long-lasting career. Admittedly, for me, they've been few and far between, but I do think that the following songs deserve some respect: Planet Earth, Save A Prayer, Notorious, Skin Trade, A Matter Of Feeling, I Don't Want Your Love, All She Wants Is, Too Late Marlene, Edge Of America, Ordinary World, Come Undone, Someone Else Not Me, Pop Trash Movie and the unreleased demo A Matter Of Fact. And pretty much every song off Red Carpet Massacre. I don't care that much for Dirty Great Monster, but the majority of the other songs are of very high quality, my favorites being the Timbaland productions Night Runner (very funky beat), Skin Divers, and Tempted, as well as Falling Down (their best ballad since Ordinary World), the delicious Box O' Honey and She's Too Much (seemingly about Simon Le Bon's daughter).

And of course the old classics \\"Rio\\", \\"View to a Kill\\" and \\"Save a Prayer\\" are fitting for any occasion.    Definately an needed add to any D-D fan or avid 80's music fan such as myself!

With Air it's the music, which says it all, not the lyrics, but the music is so vivid, so cinematic, that it creates all kinds of images and stories in your mind. Most critics and fans seem to agree that Moon Safari is their masterpiece, and they may be right, but personally I just can't make up my mind; I love Premier Symptomes, Talkie Walkie, and Pocket Symphony just as much. Life wouldn't be the same without Air.

1591840562|1.0|This book is very well written. It is concise, very low on fluff, and great for intuitive people. It gives you motivation and the feeling of - \\"YEAH! I can do it!\\". But there is a huge piece missing - people. In today's world, businesses do not have 3 employees. They have 3000. The foundation for a successful business is its people, and the book does not say anything about how to make sure that the people in the organization remain productive and happy. Instead, the book promotes the approach that, if you encourage and inspire your employees, then they will make a great team. This is absolutely wrong, as was pointed out by the pioneer of Management, Peter Drucker (\\"Inside the Guru Mind\\"). If you are serious about building an organization that people call home, then this book will not lead you there.    Another big issue that I had with this book, is that the Author says that to create a successful business you need to create meaning and want to do something good for others. But what is wrong about loving to be a manager? wanting to create wealth that you could than give to others? What about the personal goals? I think that an entrepreneur will be much more successful if they start the business because they understand the personal meaning of their business.    I think that the author is a really nice guy, but as the say goes: \\"Those who can, do; Those who cannot do, teach; And those who cannot teach- teach gym\\" (no offense to gym teachers).

For awhile I was discourage to read it because of the horrible things that I had heard. But let me say that all the things that I heard were completely stupid and just wrong.     The author clearly states that Bella is older than her years, that she is mature and that her mother thinks that she was born in another time period. Everything Bella becomes and is, fits perfectly with the story. I truly enjoyed the story and for anyone that is debating whether they should not read it because of the reviews, all I have to say is that what you believe and what someone else believes may be totally different. SO PLEASE read the book for YOU!    Great story and series and I'm sad that it had to end!

B0014G5LG2|5.0|Here for his debut on DG Daniel Harding competes on Simon Rattle's home ground. Rattle, too, was a rising star while quite young and made one of his early successes with the Mahler Tenth, a work he as gone on to conduct more than a hundred times, amazingly. Harding, however, was the first to introduce the whole work to the Vienna Phil, in 2004. Both conductors use the revised Deryck Cooke performing edition (the only one to gain wide acceptance in the concert hall), and both meet the challenge of making the Tenth sound like real, fleshed-out Mahler rather than a collection of sketches surroudning two completed movements. I'd say that Harding goes as far as Rattle in giving us a moving performance with every ounce of Mahler's complex tonal and emotional world, and in the bargain he is more freely expressive and involving.<br /><br />Harding's intent to pull us in is evident from the first bars of the great Adagio, which he molds the way a gifted Chopin pianist molds a nocturne. Literalists will want to stay at home, needless to say, once they realize how flexible the tempo and phrasing are going to be. Harding doesn't press the line as fervently as Bernstein, and he's not as coolly technical as Abbado, Chailly, or Rattle in his second recording from Berlin. Harding's approach is almost purely emotive, aiming to wrap us in a spell that will hold through the rougher, skimpier patches to come.<br /><br />The Vienna Philharmonic is the perfect ensemble for him, given its effortless expressivity, although DG's slightly tubby, resonant recording could be cleaner. Another notable thing about Harding's style is its soft grain; he eschews sudden explosions and eruptions, preferrring a seamless line a la Karajan (a name I'm invoking in a positive sense). The overall effect is eloquent rather than searingly tragic -- a justifibale course, if an unusual one. An immediate payoff is that the Scherzo isn't a letdown coming after the Adagio, and Harding further amplifies it as full-blooded Mahler with a great deal of variety in the playing; it feels not at all like a scketch.<br /><br />Purgatorio, an enigmatic movement but fully completed by Mahler, isn't as biting or stark in Harding's hands as in Rattle's, and again the lively, full-bodied playing of the Vienna Phil. holds your attention in every bar. Harding's romantic surges are a personal touch that I feel add a new dimension to the climax. (Sticklers will accuse him of taffy-puling.) The second Scherzo gains in power, and by this time the listener realizes that Harding is trying to draw a single arc through the symphony, building to a catharsis in the finale. That's why he soft-pedaled the opening Adagio and gives this later Scherzo such force.<br /><br />Here as  elsewhere there's great attention to variety of tone and changing mood. I can't say that anyone has done that part of the Tenth better, even the virtuosic Chailly on Decca. The vexed drumbeats msut be noticed, I guess, even though they are no more than one detail in a massive score. I find hard thwacks jarring and take my cue from alma Mahler's anecdote that her husband was inspired by the muffled drums of a funeral procession heard down below their window in New York. Harding agrees and gtives us distant, powerful, but muffled thuds. For once, the transition between mvt. 4 and 5 isn't nerve-racking.<br /><br />And so, does Harding succeed in making the finale, one of the barest movements, emotionally convincing in its starkness? I think so, because he expresses a postmortum elegy, haunating and removed -- a great composer is recasting the thrall of music after he's left this world. Compared to Rattle's, this account is warmer and less skeletal. I found myself listening with a catch in my throat.<br /><br />In sum, the most outstanding Tenth since Rattle's and one of the best Mahler recordings in a long time.<br /><br />P.S. 2011 - Since making this recording Harding seems to have been wandering in the wilderness for a while.After hearing a series of fairly uninspired concerts, I hope he finds a way to fulfill so much early promise.After hearing a series of fairly uninspired concerts, I hope he finds a way to fulfill so much early promise.

B000002IG4|5.0|Genesis singer and drummer Phil Collins released his second solo album Hello, I Must Be Going! in November of 1982.<br />Phil made Hello, I Must Be Going! during a busy 1982 which saw him play on ex-Led Zeppelin singer Robert Plant's first solo album Pictures at Eleven, tour with Genesis that summer, produce an album for ex-ABBA singer Frida and drum at the very first Prince's Trust Concert for Jethro Tull, Pete Townshend, Kate Bush and Robert Plant that busy year.<br />Like his previous solo album, 1981's Face Value, Phil plays drums and percussion, does all vocals and keyboards (save \\"You Can't Hurry Love\\" where Peter Robinson plays them) and is joined by co-producer/engineer Hugh Padgham, Genesis touring guitarist Daryl Stuermer, bass player John Giblin (and Mo Foster on tracks 6 and 7) and the Earth Wind and Fire horn section a/k/a The Phoenix Horns for another superb solo album.<br />We start with the great rocker about the disgust and apathy of being ridiculed and having one's name dragged in the dirt called \\"I Don't Care Anymore\\" which was a huge rock radio hit and still gets airplay on classic rock stations aside \\"In the Air Tonight\\". Next is the upbeat \\"I Cannot Believe It's True\\" which is a great number despite the fact it flopped as a US single. Next is the great rocker \\"Like China\\" which has Phil superbly singing in a Cockney English accent and superb solos from Stuermer. Next is the atmospheric rocker \\"Do You Know Do You Care\\" which has droning keyboards, exploding drums and guitars and Collins' vocals overlaid on that airy soundscape. He also made his trumpet playing debut on this track. The first side ended with his faithful note-for-note (but a step and half lower than original) cover of The Supremes' 1966 hit \\"You Can't Hurry Love\\" which was Phil's first US Top 10 single reaching #10.<br />The second side of the album starts with another US FM rock radio favorite at the time of the album's release called \\"It Don't Matter To Me\\" which has a nice horn riff from The Phoenix Horns and great guitars and drums. Next was the album's first single in the UK (which flopped in the UK), the haunting \\"Thru These Walls\\" which tells of a weird man's need to either listen with a glass to the wall or stare out at the window at goings on, where he wants to touch someone and cannot in the cold world. Next is the piano ballad \\"Don't Let Him Steal Your Heart Away\\" which was released as a single in the UK but flopped and was overlooked in the US for years, great number. Next is the instrumental \\"The West Side\\" which is one of Phil's best instrumentals and has great sax work from the late Don Myrick. We close with the sad but tender and beautiful ballad \\"Why Can't It Wait Till Morning\\" which is Phil on piano and vocal and the strings, and nothing else.<br />Hello I Must Be Going reached #9 on the US album charts and would go Platinum upon its release and Multi-Platinum a short time later and rightfully so as Phil proved he was not a one hit solo album wonder and would go on to bigger things with both Genesis and on his own as the decade wore on.<br />HUGELY RECOMMENDED!Phoenix Horns and great guitars and drums.

B00197U0DU|5.0|English rockers Genesis released its debut album From Genesis to Revelation in March of 1969.<br />The debut album of Genesis (lead singer Peter Gabriel, keyboard player Tony Banks, bass player/guitarist Mike Rutherford, guitarist Anthony Phillips and drummer John Silver) was the result of the collaboration between these talented then-teenage schoolboys from Charterhouse College in Surrey, England and record producer (and Charterhouse alumni) Jonathan King. Messieurs Gabriel and Banks from the band Garden Wall joined up with Anon members Rutherford and Phillips plus drummer Chris Stewart and formed a band and sent demos to King (whom produced the band's first single (the 1960s Bee Gees-ish sounding \\"Silent Sun\\" (which appears here in two versions) with the rocker \\"That's Me\\" as its flip side and is a bonus track on this new remaster) in the hopes that the five young musicians could push forward their music careers.<br />The band was named Genesis (as in a \\"new beginning\\" in music after the band rejected his first choice of Gabriel's Angels), King learned there was an obscured American band with that name, so the band wasn't give a moniker on their first studio album, but gave them a concept of \\"From Genesis to Revelation\\" for which to write their music.<br />They begin the album with the snappy \\"Where the Sour Turns to Sweet\\" which was an excellent song and was released as the single from the album but flopped in the UK. Next is the rocker \\"In the Beginning\\" which had hints of the style the lads would adopt in later years. Next is the piano driven \\"Fireside Song\\" which was another great song. Next is another excellent rocker out of \\"The Serpent\\" which has excellent guitar work from Phillips. Next is another great slow piece called \\"Am I Very Wrong\\" which is a nice song. Next was my first intro to this era of the band \\"In the Wilderness\\" (which I heard in its rough mix state as it appeared on the 1998 Genesis box Genesis Archives 1967-75) which reminds me of \\"Ruby Tuesday\\" by The Rolling Stones.<br />The second half starts with the great rocker \\"The Conquerer\\" which has some excellent guitar work from Phillips. \\"In Hiding\\" is next and reminds me of their then-label mates The Moody Blues' pre-Hayward/Lodge era. Next is the song \\"One Day\\" which is reminiscent to the British pop music popular in England at the time. Next is the acoustic ballad \\"Window\\" which is another great piece with acoustic guitars that would dominate the band's sound in their early days. Next is the rocker \\"In Limbo\\" which is a great song. We follow with \\"The Silent Sun\\". We close with the piano piece \\"A Place to Call My Own\\" which is a nice short but sweet tune.<br />The strings and horns conducted by Arthur Greenslade were added on to the album at the insistence of producer Jonathan King whom pushed the band to release a soft sounding album to set them apart from fellow up and coming (what would be known as) prog rock bands debuting at the time (the British psychedelia of Pink Floyd and Yes and the blues-rock of Jethro Tull). A few of the tracks on this album would appear on the Genesis Archive 1967-75 box set without the orchestrations in 1998. According to both Armando Gallo's book on the band I Know What I Like and the group's official biography \\"Genesis : Chapter and Verse\\", the band members were proud of the music but unhappy with the orchestrations.<br />The album did deplorable when it was released but it did chart in 1974 when London Records in the US re-released the album in the wake of the success of both Selling England By the Pound and Genesis Live as it peaked at #170.<br />Many re-issues of this album had been issued over the years (and remains the only album the band does not own the rights to). Now in 2008, a new remaster was re-released and sounds better than the previous versions of the album I had previously heard and has four bonus tracks (the aforementioned \\"Silent Sun\\"/\\"That's Me\\" single and the band's British second single \\"A Winter'sTale\\" (a great number) and \\"One Eyed Hound\\" (a great bluesy acoustic rocker)).<br />For those who are fans of later Phil Collins led Genesis are advised to steer clear but for Gabriel-era Genesis fans and unbiased fans whom want to see how they started out this is HUGELY RECOMMENDED.and \\"One Eyed Hound\\" (a great bluesy acoustic rocker)).

B0002KPIQY|3.0|Anjolina Jolie did a wonderful job with this role however the writers took a lot of liberties with Gia's life.  Everyone makes her mom seem like the bad guy but Gia's issues ran deeper than the lack of her mother's love like the writers want the public to believe.  Gia was most likely bipolar which little was done for or known about in the 80's.  Gia was a truly beautiful woman but I would wager that she thought and felt as though she were a man.  Today we have a label for what I think she was and that is Transgendered.  If she were born in the 80's, she would most likely be alive today with medication and a better understanding of who she really is.

I was able to successfully mix 3 microphones (using the 2 mic channels) and music from my ipod.  It allowed for more than enough flexibility and the sound quality was excellent!  I highly recommend this product!

0767802470|1.0|Can you say \\"useless\\"?  Das Boot is a German movie.  This particular cut was the Director's cut.  To see the whole movie, one would have to flip the disc over on its other side.  So we did, expecting to have a menu there to choose English subtitles.  Side two does not have a menu and therefore does not provide English subtitles for the end of the movie.  Surely, Amazon, you know that some of the products you carry and sell to consumers are defective.  Why not tell them?
0930289234|5.0|A significant crossover point between the comic book superhero genre with it's tenuous link to reality and modern literature. The back story is largely the whole story as the superheroes who save the world are given a canvas which is not merely black and white upon which to reveal their varied origins and inevitable flaws. Watchmen peels back a layer of our suspension of disbelief and tells a story that allows us to sink our teeth in. Batman would be proud.

B0000027DJ|5.0|I got hooked into Alice Cooper with Trash.  It came out my freshman year of high school and was a lightning rod for me.    Then, along came \\"Hey Stoopid.\\"  Stoopid was different, not a simple progression in sound.    Wind-up Toy is my favorite track, creepy and crazy all at once.  One can almost visualize some kid dealing with being locked away in a psych ward.    \\"Hey Stoopid\\" is a fun song.  It makes some points that the recovering alcoholic Cooper wanted to make, but made 'em well.  It grooves and sounds like a good live song, not overly mixed in the studio.    There's a string of depressing songs that fit my teenage moods all those years ago and ended up on my slow song mix tapes back in the day.    Cooper showed his stuff on this album.  And he covered lots of territory.
B0010VD7EO|4.0|Oracular Spectacular (2008, Red Ink) MGMT's first studio album. ****    The neo-psychedelia duo MGMT (made up of Ben Goldwasser and Andrew VanWyngarden) could have released a classic album. They could have. In fact, for a while, it seemed like they had done it; the first half of Oracular Spectacular, their debut album, it seems like MGMT have crafted something perfect.    The reality is, the Oracular Spectacular is lopsided, with all the beautiful gems showing themselves in the first half, and literally only the first half. With ten songs, \\"Time to Pretend\\" through \\"Kids\\" is a whirlwind of influences and originality, cleverly warped into one body and garnished with some very impressive and astute lyrics. \\"Time to Pretend\\" sounds like a lost anthem of a generation, a mix between the rebellion against the status quo of suburban life, yet yields the tragic consequences of the \\"live fast, die young\\" rock mentality. It's an eclectic blend of alternative pop as well as 60's pop. The true anthem, though, is \\"The Youth,\\" with its beautiful and minimalist approach, the gorgeous falsetto as MGMT ask an important question; \\"The Youth are starting to change/Are you starting to change?\\" It is a testament to John Lennon's \\"Give Peace a Chance\\" or \\"Imagine.\\" The Beatles landscapes of \\"Weekend Wars,\\" the disco beat and BeeJees stylings of \\"Electric Feel,\\" and the alternative dance of \\"Kids\\" are all outstanding pieces. And it is on \\"Time to Pretend\\" and \\"Kids\\" where MGMT sounds at their most original, regardless of how well their influences play on others.    Despite all that, the second half of the album slips, starting immediately with \\"4th Dimensional Transition,\\" steeped heavily in Middle Eastern and even rolling wild west approaches. \\"Pieces of What\\" fails to establish the hook it is looking for, and while none of the remaining songs are bad, they're certainly not what was promised in the album's opening act. Still, MGMT have proved that they are masters of neo-psychedlia, andperhaps a bit of time on the road will allow them to pen a few more ridiculously good tunes. (Time to Pretend, The Youth, Electric Feel)
0756404746|4.0|Innkeepers abound in fantasy novels.   Very rarely, though, do we get to see things from their point of view.  THE NAME OF THE WIND tells two stories at the same time. In the present, there is the innkeeper named Kote, our main character who is asked to share his past with another who is willing to write it down, word for word.  The vast majority of the book takes place in the past, covering Kote's youth and education at the University--as told by Kote himself.    One of the first things you will notice about this book (besides how thick it is) is the insane amount of praise that has been heaped upon it by other famous authors. Is this book worthy of such praise? Will it chase Lord of the Rings off your bookshelf?  No, it won't. But it IS a good book.  Good, not great.     Here's why:     PROS:   Interesting characters: The character of Kote/Kvothe is really mysterious. Just what sort of things has he done in his past that he has to take up the occupation of innkeeper in the middle of nowhere? Denna is also interesting since she is so unpredictable--like the wind itself.     The University scenes remind me heavily of the White Tower scenes in Jordan's WHEEL OF TIME series. A University is not an action-packed setting, but it was fun to read about Kvothe's education nonetheless. It was just as entertaining as reading about Hogwarts.     The author's style is eloquent without being florid. He won't beat you over the head with the customs of a dozen different nations and how every bolt of cloth looks.     Dragons. Again. Like we haven't seen that before! But I found the dragon scene very refreshing, believable and even humorous. Easily one of the best dragon scenes I've read, next to Bilbo's talk with Smaug in THE HOBBIT.     CONS:     Kote's recollection of his past is really long-winded. I found it hard to believe that someone would listen to that much dialogue in one day, much less write it down.     The map is pointless. If you're going to bother putting a map of the land in your book you should at least populate it with most (if not all) of the places mentioned in the book.    OVERALL: If you like the \\"youth goes to magic school\\" storyline, then this is definitely a book for you! Easily one of the best in this vein, right next to HARRY POTTER, although a bit more mature and adult.
B001AJVR5M|3.0|A Little Bit Longer (2008, Disney) The Jonas Brothers' third studio album. **1/2    I was extremely disappointed in Rolling Stone's award of \\"excellence\\" to this album. It's not that the Jonas Brothers are awful or that they will never become anything, but Rolling Stone's reasoning is beyond ridiculous. Jody Rosen's first line in her review of four Disney-released albums is \\"History teaches us not to dismiss kiddie pop.\\" I would actually say the exact opposite. Why? Rosen claims that we have to thank teen pop for results such as Britney Spears, Justin Timberlake, and all associated wannabes. But let's look at this fact; of the teen pop sensations Spice Girls, Backstreet Boys, N*Sync, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, and Justin Timberlake (solo), and a combined twenty-two albums between them all, only two have not been met with middling or poor critical reaction (Back to Basics by Aguilera and Blackout by Spears, the latter of which did receive a few mixed and poor reviews). And don't get me started on Katy Perry.    So if that's the logic you want to use, Jody, then we need to be wary of Vanessa Hudgens, Miley Cyrus, and the Jonas Brothers. But that's actually the opposite, because like Cyrus, the Jonas Brothers aren't bad. Is there album great? Not by any stretch of the veritably screwed-up imagination. Teen pop is useless, but they use it the correct way. They aren't going out of their way to try and be cool; basically, there's no mention of partying, sex, or the like. These guys are responsible to their fan base, and that's great. As far as the music is concerned, it's fairly bleak. Yeah, Nick and Kevin can play the guitar pretty damn well for their age. But Joe's vocals are so horribly predictable - complete with lines of \\"Tonight!\\" and forced voice straining - that they help fulfill all the cliches one can expect. There are two moments where the brothers get it right; the first is \\"Shelf,\\" a genuinely straightforward rocker that loses the excess of traditional generic pop. Switch the vocalist and you could believe it was any trapped-in-the-late-90's band. Another is the gentle ballad \\"Lovebug,\\" a simple acoustic number that turns radically electric as it progresses. Beyond that, the boys fail to be as adventurous or clever as their female counterpart. But that's okay, if they ever adopt a respectable genre they could transpose their skills. It's easy-going and honestly harmless music, because their full commital to Christianity doesn't seep in anywhere for an unwarranted and unwanted moral lecture. For fans it's their best yet. For anyone else, that last sentence doesn't mean a whole lot.
B000MNP2K8|5.0|I haven't read the book or seen all the other Bond movies, but for me, CASINO ROYALE does an excellent job of showing the roots of James Bond.     From the very beginning, we see how green Bond is as he messily kills a man.    We also see how naive he is and his \\"I'm invincible\\" mindset as he chases a suspect in a breathtaking scene involving lots of jumps and crazy stuntwork.     We see how this attitude is able to get him any woman he desires underneath the sheets.     We see Bond laugh in the face of death (the torture scene is very amusing!).     Finally and most rewarding of all, we get to see James Bond transform from the aforementioned naive agent into one that trusts nobody.     He's Bond.    James Bond.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|In Rainbows (2008, XL Recordings) Radiohead's seventh studio album. *****    There are several artists - Madonna and Bowie come to mind - who are chameleons when it comes to changing times. They are able to adapt to the what is up-and-coming, what the next big sound will be. Radiohead adapts as well, but not to be popular, not to fit in with the times. If anything, Radiohead creates the times, already handsomely showcasing heavy influence on many of today's artists. OK Computer was an album renowned for its ability to blend a three guitar attack with electronic sounds flawlessly. Kid A, while polarizing fans and critics at the time of its release, managed to yet again break new barriers, as it became among the first of the indie-electronica albums, and at that point the most successful. What Kid A also did was show Radiohead's outright refusal of the title of \\"The Biggest Band in the World.\\"    Over their next two studio albums, they struggled to put out true quality recordings. Surely neither Amnesiac nor Hail to the Thief is bad, but they weren't as visionary as their earlier works, and in the case of Hail to the Thief, seemed like a combination of desperation to not only please the fans, but to squeak out an album to finish their contract with EMI. After that, the speculation as to what Radiohead would do next was tremendous. It wasn't until 2006 that anyone had a real clue as to what their fate might be. After performing at Bonnaroo, Thom Yorke's unexpected solo album The Eraser came out that fall. A flurry started, people claiming that The Eraser was a sign Radiohead was through. Yorke denied this, and finally word of a new album began to leak.    In October of 2007, the monumental In Rainbows was put out, the first of its kind not only in sound, but in its style of release. Fans were able to download the album online or pay for an $80 \\"discbox\\" which included two CD's (the album and a second CD of B-sides), two heavyweight 45-speed vinyl, lyrics booklet, and art booklet, all neatly wrapped in a fold-out case. For those who decided just to download, the option of paying whatever you pleased was offered. In the end, Radiohead made more money off of this one release than they had from royalties of all their other releases combined. The reaction from critics was phenomenal; not only was the music brilliant but the release scheme had worked in flying colors.    But In Rainbows isn't about the money, and it isn't about the way it was released. It is, in short, about how Radiohead crafted their best album to date. For a while I wrestled with the idea that In Rainbows was superior to OK Computer, and even after listening to both relentlessly it was hard to decide. What makes Radiohead the best band on the planet today is their ability to do whatever they want; OK Computer and In Rainbows sound nothing alike, yet it is impossible to mistake either for anyone else.    In Rainbows is the most personal Radiohead has ever been, most notably through the lyrics. The change in Thom Yorke's approach was apparent from The Eraser, which with its political message also mixed in songs concerning him and another significant person. The album is also a distinct difference because of the lower amounts of reverb put on Yorke's vocals. Though it is not without it, compared to Kid A, it is remarkably less.    Starting with \\"15 Step,\\" a song with a blistering beat, Yorke spits out lyrics suggesting that In Rainbows is about a relationship; \\"You used to be alright/What happened?/Did the cat get your tongue?\\" And even when the songs are fast-paced and fist-pumping, like \\"Bodysnatchers,\\" there is still a romantic feel to all of it. It comes through because of the lyrics yet again; \\"I've no idea what I am talking about/I'm trapped in this body and can't get out.\\" The wistful, sighful \\"Nude,\\" laments with one of the first entry of a string arrangement, something that becomes more prominent as the album progresses.    \\"Reckoner\\" marks one of album's bestpoints, with a beautiful falsetto delivery by Yorke and a superb drum arrangement by Selway. And even when the album closes with the simple though haunting \\"Videotape,\\" the listener must re-start the journey again. Like any Radiohead release, it is impossible to crack within one outing. In fact, one may miss the subtle details of \\"All I Need,\\" because it's what marks the differences between it and its similar cousin, \\"Climbing Up the Walls.\\"    The entire album sounds like a cleaned-up jam session, and while some may say that is a drawback, it isn't, if it is anything at all, it's an element that makes it better. These aren't simple arrangements. There's nothing that isn't compelling about the guitar part kicking into full gear and out of its muddiness on \\"Bodysnatchers\\" once the quasi-chorus starts up. There's nothing that isn't short of genius about the meandering in \\"Weird Fishes/Arpeggi.\\" The jam element also tells us - and it's easy to hear - that the band is enjoying themselves. And anyone who has seen them perform this new material can attest to that. Quite simply, In Rainbows is a spinning blast of sound and color, a journey about the doomed relationship and all the emotions that come with it, a testament to the powers of the classical guitar and the wonders of electronic music, and an unforgettable entry in 21st century art. (15 Step, Bodysnatchers, Nude, Weird Fishes/Arpeggi, All I Need, Faust Arp, Reckoner, House of Cards, Videotape)
B001AGNMIU|5.0|Ever since I saw this at the theatres I've loved Burton's take on an early American gothic legend of the Headless Horseman and Ichabod Crane. The casting is great, Depp and Richie have chemistry and Miranda Richardson is unforgetable in her role. Great cast and of course great orchestral score. Im glad I waited to buy this on DVD because now this special release is even better.
B001ACY8D2|4.0|Med Sud I Eyrum Vid Spilum Endalaust (2008, XL) Sigur Ros's fifth studio album. ****    As any fan of Sigur Ros knows, they're fantastically strange. And anyone who does not like them would say the same, only changing that they're too strange, and that they're being different for the sake of being different. It's easy enough to say that the lyrical approach is pretentious; Sigur Ros sing in a Norwegian jibberish, encouraging their fans to make up their own words. No album better expresses their artsy tactfulness (or lack thereof, as some may say) than 2002's ( ), which had no titles, no lyrics, no acknowledgements, no nothing. The cover simply had the parenthesis and the band's name, and beyond that it was a mystery.    Now Sigur Ros have taken a new direction, and even the most devoted fan would have to say it is fairly different from anything they've done before. The opener, \\"Gobbledigook,\\" is probably the most upbeat song the band has ever performed, and the whole album feels this way. While with Takk... and ( ) Sigur Ros explored the depths of moodiness, subtlety, and spaciness, Med Sud I Eyrum takes a turn for the spiritual, presenting itself in different fashions. The genres range from folk-stomp to church hymn to tribal beats, but no where does the album not feel as if it was made in the spirit of hope and the unknown. Sure, we've no idea what they might be saying (as the lyrics are again in a foreign mix of nonsense), but Sigur Ros have successfully demonstrated that they are only about music, and that their voices are merely tools for creating beautiful sounds and that the words are unimportant. Without saying anything, they have communicated a message purely through music, and that is a feat in and of itself. (Godan Daginn, Festival, Med Sud I Eyrum)
B000BKVQTS|5.0|The Brother's Grimm ala Terry Gilliam. Im giving this 5 stars not because its Gilliam's best, but because I really enjoyed Ledger's and Belucci's performances. Gilliam is a real artist in his films, he likes to paint a colorful yet disturbing palette. Munchausen does the same, however, it was not as widely received as this one, which is why I think Grimm gets so much criticism. Some people either \\"get\\" Gilliam or they dont. Personally Damon's performance was lackluster, however, overall the story is a pastiche of old faerie tale legends, condensed into a hollywood-esque blockbuster movie. Had Gilliam gone more arthause and less hollywood, I suspect this film would have fared better.

0066620996|5.0|The CFO of one of my client companies was discussing Good to Great and it caught my attention!  He's a smart man with outstanding work ethics, so it would stand to reason he would find this book a winner.    After reading it, I am amazed that someone finally articulated what many of us had suspected -- it isn't about being good.  It isn't about hiring a team to come in and identify our \\"goals and objectives\\".  It is about something much more quiet, and so much stronger.  It is getting the right people on the train...and the wrong ones off.  It is about working for the organization, not self.      This book has many fascinating facts which, if you keep them in the lead of your thoughts, will help you go from good to great as well.    The road to greatness is not for faint of heart, the under-dedicated, or those who cannot channel their egos into their organizations to work for the common good.  BUT, if you are strong, determined and dedicated to the prize, look out--it's going to happen for your organization!    Definitely, read this book, regardless of where you are in your life/business process.    [...]

0307276902|5.0|I could care less if James Frey embellished the truth or made the whole story up, the point is the lives described in this book are incredibly relatable and very true to life. If drug addiction is something you've never had to deal with personally or with a close friend or family member consider yourself lucky. It's a long road home and I applaud anyone who can write about it rawly without glamourizing it the way Frey did. I think this book is written in a unique and interesting way. I couldn't put it down. I recommend you push the controvery about this book aside and give it a try.

B00133MKVK|5.0|Well, okay.  I'm a fan.  I picked this up knowing I'd enjoy it but I NEVER, EVER expected I'd be hit by such a lush, complex and incredible set.  At once it is wholly familiar yet completely fresh. I'm amazed by the utter brilliance of those involved, especially Dame Bassey who has managed to re-interpret some of her classic recordings and take on some notable songs by other artists and make it work like only a woman at the top of her game can.  She has only enhanced her legacy with this offering and you can't miss by adding it to your collection. Trust me, this is a stroke of genius and it's clear she is in a class all by herself. Really, I'm stunned at how good this is.

B000002AH7|5.0|This CD rocks! It is the reason Miles Davis was one of the greatest. His breadth is simply amazing. The slow melodic tones will have you gently rocking subconsciously.

0321356683|5.0|This book seems to be one of the most critically acclaimed Java titles. What could I possibly add to what has been said? The acclaim is fully deserved. I had the feeling that I already learned something new and important as soon as I reached page twenty. This is something that I cannot say of very many books. Effective Java manages to be extremely useful and simultaneously extremely easy to read. However, \\"easy\\" doesn't mean simple in this case, since many of the discussed problems are subtly complex. Some are so complex, in fact, that Java beginners might not fully understand or appreciate them. So, it's probably not a book for beginners. On the other hand, the book is neither esoteric. The 78 items are general Java programming issues which one is likely to encounter in everyday work at some point, regardless of any specific domain. The book is written in a clear and concise language and each problem is exceptionally well reasoned. The author has a very deep understanding of the Java language, which is rather apparent and no surprise, since Joshua Bloch is one of the architects of the Java platform. Incidentally, this also means that the problems are discussed from the perspective of an API designer rather than from the perspective of an application programmer. This is useful, because it is primarily concerned with creating robust and high quality interfaces. Architects, designers, and application programmers benefit likewise from this. The items discussed in this book can probably be described as design and implementation level rationales. They are grouped by Java categories, such as generics, enums, annotations, exceptions, serialisation, as well as by more general concepts, such as  object creation, classes and interfaces, methods and concurrency. Many of the individual topics are related; therefore the author makes ample use of cross references, which is helpful for reference use. The included code examples are a joy to read; they are clear, concise, and alwaysillustrative. While discussing the intricacies of the above named topics, Joshua Bloch casually introduces the reader to a good number of commonly used design patterns, many of which are illustrated with code examples. However, design patterns are not themselves formally discussed. The book equips Java programmers with an arsenal of relevant best practices, from comparatively simple things such as creating objects, implementing \\"equals()\\" and \\"hashCode()\\" methods to more advanced topics, such as concurrency, mutability, and thread safety. In doing so, Joshua Bloch points out quite a few quirks and peculiarities of the Java language, and he does not only point them out, but explains their practical consequences in detail. Thus, the book has great didactic value, as the reader will end up with a higher level of familiarity with the language. Reading this book is time well invested for any Java programmer.

B000W7JWUA|3.0|We are avid players of Settlers (and love it), but this newest edition has some flaws that make us wish we would have bought the 3rd edition. We have had the game for about 8 months, and the interlocking border (instead of the regular hexagon pieces in the 3rd edition) have never fit right. It takes three people to get everything into place, and even then the border warps and the pieces pop out. They interlock like a puzzle piece, and they are starting to wear out, so we have finally given up on getting everything together correctly. If you were worried about the 3rd edition getting bumped and jumbled, you simply had to set up the game on a tablecloth or piece of fabric. This newer edition is impossible to setup correctly, especially as it ages.  Also note you cannot use your old expansion packs with the newer edition, as the pieces are different. You now have to pay for all the newer versions of the expansion packs, how convenient.  We still love this game and will play it regularly, it just seems the &#34;advancements&#34; were not tested or well planned. It is also bothersome that they made the newer editions incompatible with the old expansions, you can easily spend $150 on this game and the expansions, and you would expect that investment to last... it is a board game after all!

031606792X|3.0|I absolutely LOVED the first three books in the Twilight Saga (Twilight, New Moon and Eclipse) but unfortunately, I thought that Breaking Dawn did not reach the potential I was personally hoping for. I do not agree with her having a baby, once i realized she was pregnant it ruined the book for me. I read the whole series in less than a week, the first three books it was impossible to put down but with Breaking Dawn it was completely possible. I'm not saying it was a terrible book, I'm saying that i hoped for so much more out of Stephenie Meyer.
B000A0GYD2|5.0|This video package is for the true space nut.  I grew up watching the Apollo missions to the moon glued to the set with each mission.  This video provides the background to all of the important decisions made in order to successfully make it to the moon and back.  I truly believe it is one of the finest series ever produced.
6305075379|3.0|Max Max is an ugly, bare knuckle movie that shuns sentimentality and explanation. Set in a dystopian future (not really post apocalyptic as many reviews claim - there is no evidence of a humanitarian crisis preceding the action), it features a wild and desolate Australian outback with feral kill hungry violent gangs of motorcycles taking on a quirky, underfunded police force. Max, played by Mel Gibson, is an old fashioned road to calvary type hero. A police officer who becomes disillusioned after the savage burning of one of his colleagues, he quits, but finds the gang have not left him. In horrific scenes, the gang hunts down his family, and Gibson returns to extract revenge, a necessarily determined and scarred loner.<br /><br />Max Max does not stretch out into many dimensions, but it contains a raw savage power and exposes something of the nub of the innate violence at the heart of man. A good one to watch in the line of movies that expose the raw seam below the surface of our civilization.
B000065I4L|5.0|I've seen this a number of times and find something new to laugh at almost every time I watch. It's superb satire -- but not for most folk who won't like playing around with religion and showing a female God who roars. The cast is letter perfect inlcluding George Carlin and Allan Rachman (the Voice of God). But caution for those who are true blievers it could be most upsetting. For others it's a remarkable change of pace from he usual mundane stuff that comes out of Hollywood.
B00005JPO1|2.0|Initial impression of this movie was good, but it got stale on a second viewing. It is full of cheese and nods to movies from way back when Indiana Jones movies were good. The plot is simply all over the place and several things make no sense whatsover, e.g.: the people with blowguns at the graveyard, no broken bones after traveling a mile in the air in a refrigerator, Shia LeBoeuf swinging through the trees spidey-style faster than a car can move. The movie has so many outlandishly unrealistic moments that I want to jump out of a plane and use a dinghy as a parachute and a sled.     Beyond that, it seems that Spielberg relied on pure studio sets more in this film than in the others.  Either that, or the use of the studio is just more obvious. The CGI was also an unwelcome addition. I would much rather see plaster casts and wax faces melting off.  It actually looks more realistic (see the ends of \\"Last Crusade\\" and \\"Raiders.\\")    That being said, Harrison Ford absolutely drives this movie. If Indiana Jones defines his career, it is because he fits into the role much as his head fits in the trademark fedora. There is a modicum of excitement and, with a suspension of disbelief akin to that necessary to watch popular movies such as \\"The Dark Knight\\" and \\"Iron Man,\\" there is some fun to be had.  I cannot entirely dislike it, but two stars seems appropriate. Though I do realize that extra star could get me booted from the fan club.
B0014Z4OQG|5.0|I've had several nightmares after seeing this movie. I've always wanted to see a movie about a nightmarish creature terrorizing a city, and this movie delivered admirably. Who cares what the monster is or where it came from? Not knowing just makes it scarier.
B00042YBTK|5.0|I was a musician when this was released; not good enough to break through but good enough to know the people who mattered. I heard about this album before it came out from producers in the most important studio of that time. This is Burdon proving to musicians that he could do an album as successful musically as he was commercially. It was astonishing then. Still is.
0740748475|5.0|I have loved Calvin & Hobbes since I first stumbled across them c1990s. I have 3 sons (10-18) who have, quite literally, read to pieces the five collection books I own. So, when I found out about this series, I knew I would need at least one copy (for me).  Having purchased a set and examined it \\"in the flesh\\", I had no hesitation in ordering another two sets, one for each (and hoping I can read them as well). I may need to buy a 4th for me - the only reason I have not (yet)is concern about Customs saying I'm running an import business...  Shipping to Australia has resulted in a very minor dint to one corner of the box-set, courtesy of minimal airbags in the carton, but the books themselves are in fine shape. Quality is excellent, and my biggest issue now is deciding at what age to pass them to my boys, so that they can appreciate them for many years to come. Such is the physical condition.  The content is quite simply the best cartoon series I have ever seen, and having had children adds a new dimension of appreciation of the insights Bill Watterson crafted into the strips. Mr Watterson - thank you!
B0006L0LOS|2.0|This is not the worst movie in the world as some would have you believe. But in a world that has given us \\"Manos: the Hands of Fate\\", \\"Dungeons & Dragons\\" and \\"Starship Troopers: Hero of the Federation\\", that doesn't really say much.<br /><br />I watched this movie because I have a morbid curiosity about bad movies. Particularly, figuring out where they went wrong. And the consensus here is ... pretty much everywhere.<br /><br />Let's start with the story. The villain's dastardly plan revolves around marketing a facial creme that rejuvenates the skin, but, if one stops using it, has some very mean side effects. That's about it. MAKEUP! Oh no! The world will never be able to recover from that diabolical blow! Sure, the Joker (in Tim Burton's BATMAN) used personal grooming items seemingly at random to inflict mild cases of death on the unsuspecting public in his sadistic mind game to cause horror among the population of Gotham, but we're talking about a creme here that actually makes you look uglier if you stop using it! NOOOOOOO!<br /><br />Okay, snark aside, I just couldn't care about the \\"evil plot\\" except for the fact that they killed our heroine to keep their little secret.<br /><br />Which brings us to the next point. Giving Catwoman superhuman powers because she is brought back to life by some mystical Egyptian cat? Really? You're going to stick with that? That's not quite the MO for this character. Sure, she may act catty at times, but there is nothing supernatural about her. Adding this mystical element just distances the audience even further from the character. Revenge we understand. Slight insanity? Got it. Superhuman cat powers? You lost me.<br /><br />Then there's the kinetic, motion-sickness-inducing direction. Do you think you could lock that camera down for a minute or two? Please? The lighting and coloring don't help in the least. It is just way too visually busy. I understand trying for \\"artistic\\" filming, but this is ridiculous.<br /><br />In the end, the only reason I gave this more than one star is that, for those who want to see how to ruin a movie, this is something you could actually sit through and take notes. As the movie ends, you truly don't care about anyone or anything in the whole movie. So it gets one extra star for the education it gives in bad film making.ar is that, for those who want to see how to ruin a movie, this is something you could actually sit through and take notes.

B0017MO10U|5.0|As a long time Stargate fan, this was just more enjoyment of the Stargate world. Although it didn't contain any revolutionary new plot line, I enjoyed the story with its twists and turns. Just great fun.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|The Eagles in concert live or on a DVD are simply amazing. The sounds of Don Henley and Glenn Frey are so distinctive and with the amzing guitar leadership of funny guy Joe Walsh and a very talented Steuart Smith makes this a very special album. And let us not forget Timothy B. Schmit on bass.  Phenomenal.
0930289234|5.0|I wanted to get back into reading comic books/graphic novels for a while but was a bit hesitant. Maybe it was the surge of comic book inspired movies that made me want to see what behind these amazing movies or the need for a greater story that I felt was missing, but I decided to start my kick off with Watchmen. I couldn't have picked a better book!<br /><br />The cover of Watchmen touts it as a \\"Winner of the Hugo Award\\" and \\"One of Time Magazine's 100 Best Novels\\", and as soon as you pick it up you will know why. It starts off heavy after the death of one of their own, the \\"hero\\" Comedian, and picks up steam after that. But the greatest things about this book aren't things you can see right away, it's what's underneath everything that keeps you reading.<br /><br />The first thing is obviously the story; it is real. It has a back story that actually builds upon the current story. Everything written in this novel has a purpose, and I know that every time I read it it will show me something new. After the first read I'm still trying to piece everything together because I know there are more details that connect, I just haven't seen them yet. And the fact that I want to read it again is a major accomplishment considering it's size and the weight of the story alone.<br /><br />Another are the characters. They aren't your usual cookie-cutter hero's. Sure, they are based on a lot of today's modern characters but they each have their own life and story. They have their own tendencies that make them human and their own person, and it's great to see how each person, no matter how different they are, interact with everyone. They are people just like you and me who have chosen to \\"adventure\\" for one reason or another, and their backstories are given to further strengthen the characters. They don't have any great powers (except for Dr. Manhattan) and they are wanted by the law throughout the book which makes it even more difficult for them.<br /><br />Throughout the entire story you read along as these characters get themselves in and out of trouble and the entire time they handle it like you think they would, but never does the story reveal itself or are you aware of what is coming next. Especially when it comes to the ending. The ending blows me away even now thinking about it.<br /><br />The bottom line is get this book because it's a story that will last longer than time and keep you hooked even longer.ory you read along as these characters get themselves in and out of trouble and the entire time they handle it like you think they would, but never does the story reveal itself or are you aware of what is coming next.

B000000XBC|2.0|Chronicle was a let down for me.  I guess Chronicle 1 had almost all of the best Credence songs.

It had a lot of cover songs that I don't think they did particularly well.

031606792X|1.0|My life does not hang on what happens in this series so please keep that in mind when reading. Oh and please do not mock my less than 'perfect marble' typing skills and sorry you might have to take more than 1/84th of a second to read this (for those of you who are WAY too into unrealistic perfection and unimaginative detail).    On the whole I think this book is very much like the others. My perception is that many people got swept up in the 1st thru 3rd books then have had to move on for a year and now that they have come back it is not as 'breathtaking' as they remembered, because it really is not and never was. Good story a little clever but NOWHERE near `Genius' as others have been so idiotic to call it.    There are two things that I was willing to give SM and she seemed to lose a bit of those in this book (and definitely lost completely in Host). 1- She knew her die hard audience (the `die hard audience' ...ahhh...this is a discussion for another time). 2- She knew her limitations, abilities, strengths, and weaknesses. With this last book she seems to have lost quite a bit of these two things, best-selling author does not = GREAT author, somehow she thinks she is a great author and she tries doing things that just how limited her writing `skills' really are.    About 20% of the book needs to be cut because there is way too much worthless and ultra repetitive detail. I do not dislike this book (as I did the Host) but I do not like it as much as some of the others. It does fit in with the rest of this series and for those of you who `hate' this book compared with the others, welcome back to reality, sorry it sucks so bad for you.

0805053883|4.0|Bought this book for my grandson in Cincinnati and according to his dad, he loves it.  He loves to go to the zoo and especially wants to see the Polar Bears, both before and after reading this book..........
0143038419|5.0|I was shocked when I logged on to Amazon and saw so many snarky, bitter reviews; I expected this book to have a solid five star rating.  I do a lot of reading and it not every day that I find a book so engrossing, so honest, so profound, and so funny that I clear my schedule in order to plow through it.  To all those mean-spirited reviewers, my question is: if you hated the book so much, why did you waste your time on it?  Seems to me those folks are the ones who needed this book the most, yet read it without appreciating any of the gifts it has to offer.  Now, I am not saying that this book is some sort of holy text; to the contrary, the writer is, or at least starts out, as a whiney, neurotic mess, who admittedly can be quite annoying in her self-referential misery.  And her path to spirituality reads more like a TV reality show than the Bhagavad Gita.  But I love the intensely personal, hyper observant, open-to-everything way in which she embraces her experiences, as well as the gritty and witty way she communicates.  The chapters are packed with wonderful nuggets of information, wise insights, fascinating observations of people and cultures, and delicious moments of sensuality, spirituality, grace and inspiration.  As a person who enjoys nature writing, my one disappointment with the book was that her interest seems so exclusively focused on people.  I would have enjoyed a little more natural history, the names of some of the beautiful flowers and butterflies she describes, or a description of a dog or cat or sacred cow that even begins to match the sensitivity and wonder with which she describes humans.  But that is a minor quibble with a major achievement.  And I don't even say this because I identify with the author's journey.  I spent my glorious months in Italy when I was 20, have met my soul mate, and am able to quiet my mind without visiting an Ashram.  But I, and I suspect most of us, can always use some help expanding our world views and and shoring up our moral and spiritual failings; this book inspires such self-work while being thoroughly entertaining.our moral and spiritual failings; this book inspires such self-work while being thoroughly entertaining.
0679405429|5.0|I loved this book and Jane Austen's style, but this is not a literary review -- this review is on the Everyman's Library Edition.<br /><br />This printing is wonderful and I absolutely love the everyman's library books.  If the book wasn't spotless, I would almost think it was an antique edition.  The cover is lovely, the binding is solid, the paper is thick and matte, and the font is legible.<br /><br />This book is to be read, loved and proudly shelved for display. Don't waste your money on some tiny, stiff, mass-market paperback.<br /><br />EVERYMAN'S LIBRARY EDITION -- TOTALLY RECOMMENDED!
B0019GOT2Y|5.0|So, I picked the CD up at the concert in Spokane when they were touring here recently! Like everyone here says...they do not dissapoint? The cd rips through all kinds of emotions but I like the second chance song the most.  Guess I am kinda mellow like that.  But Devour makes you want to pound on your steering wheel going down the road!  Keep it up guys...and congrats on your little boy!
031606792X|2.0|This book could have been so much more and it wasn't.  It dropped the whole series from second to third.  It ended better than harry potter but HP7 was a much better book.  I am most disappointed with Mrs. Meyer she could have made this so much better and she just took the easy way out with everything to make everyone happy.  Whats with the no fight at the end boring.  This book was boring and i wasted my time reading it.
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|I am not usually a music person. I rarely listen to the radio, mainly because of the dearth of compelling music these days. So when my husband said that he had heard a song on his car radio on the way to work one day that he really, really liked, I just tuned him out (sorry Dear)...He said that it was by Coldplay, that he didn't know the title, but that it had a bunch of violins in it. Coldplay? No thanks, I thought. Aren't they one of those alternative bands filled with angst and self-loathing, pretentious and riddled with caterwalling and plaintive wails---ugh, I'll pass. A few days later, in an attempt to drown out my three screaming children, I turned on the radio. I was immediately captivated by what I was hearing. It sounded like something right out of the 80's, like U2 with a touch of Duran Duran. I was spellbound. Then when I heard the violins, I figured that this must be the song to which my husband had referred. So I purchased the CD for my husband's b-day that was in a couple of weeks, and we have been listening to it daily ever since. We never, never tire of it. The cut Violet Hill is excellent also, but the entire CD is unique and wonderful and I would recommend it to everyone.
B000063S6Z|4.0|Another great mix of old soul, ambient, and dance music from Moby. It's a great combination. The ambient provides the spiritual tone; the dance provides the energy; and the old soul provides the added depth. And he's the best in the world at it. It works because you can tell he respects each sound he's using, and not just using it to prove he can, or fit a certain popular sound.<br /><br />Moby must have a great soul. You can feel it in his music. Very spiritual and life driven. And that shines through whether his songs lean more towards rock, pop, dance, or classic soul. Most of the songs on this album are a mix of soulful-dance-and ambient. There's also a few pop, a few ambient, one rock, and a few dance tracks. As an entire record, it works perfectly. And does wonders for your mood.

B00005N6KG|3.0|The good news is that these nearly weightless headphones sound great, and will actually stay in the ears of those of us who can't seem to master ear buds (and seriously, what's up with those anyway?)  The bad news is that I've yet to have a pair of these last longer than about 3 months before one channel (usually the left) goes dead.<br /><br />The lightweight wires are so insubstantial that a short circuit is guaranteed...and I have yet to be able to take things apart and patch them into working order again. So by all means buy these for small, relatively comfortable, good-sounding headphones (especially nice in the gym) - but understand that it's basically a disposable and won't last long.
031606792X|3.0|I don't want to rehash what everyone else is saying and bore everyone to tears, so instead I'll sum up briefly what turned me off about this book:    1. A happy ending for EVERYONE? Seriously??  2. No struggle to achieve happiness? It just comes?   3. Imprinting? Ugh. Creeeepy!  4. Pregnant without a chance of finding herself. Sad.    Hopefully the final book will be better, if Meyers doesn't decide to cancel it entirely.

031606792X|3.0|I feel about this book the way I felt about the third Matrix movie.  \\"What?  They set up all this really cool stuff and then ended it like this?  What a disappointment.\\"  I gave it three stars because at least it all makes sense, there are no major plot holes that I could find.  And I support the author's right to end her story the way she wants to.  I just thought it was very silly.  And I'm glad I'm a fast reader so that I didn't waste a lot of time.  But the teenage girls probably love it.    On a positive note, reading this series made me run screaming back to my Harry Potter books to find character development, cohesive plot, and good old common sense.  So thank you Stephenie Meyer.  You made me realize what a genius (a rare commodity) JK Rowling really is.
B0002Z9HT8|4.0|I bought the one disc version of this. I was not happy with it because the songs were not in their entirety. I waited until the price came down and I was ready. I am so glad. What a wonderful experience this is. To see the artists in 1985 is an adventure. Even the oganizer Bob G performing is wonderful. Do buy this and forget about your problems for a while and be part of this. A good cause and a beautiful day. It is easy to find the artist you want to listen to. The menu is so helpful. This brings a lot of joy to share with friends, don't watch it alone have people over. You will be singing and taking it in.    Debra Envall

0975991477|4.0|This book is a fantastic primer on cell biology and what's being discovered today about quantum physics and how it relates in a macro way to the cell. what was both daunting AND respectable about the book is the amount of technical education given on cell biology, chemistry, energy, etc. I found myself skimming over some, but I wanted to honor the mans' work as much as possible, and I realized that I could say \\"no\\" to the dumbing down of society by slowing down and ingesting the information.<br /><br />The book gives an entirely new slant to how our state of mind as well as subconscious programming gives rise to changes in cell and body chemistry.  In fact, this is probably the most complete information I've seen on how the subconscious works in relation to the conscious, as well as the REASON that the first four years of a child's life are the most important. Very sobering, a must read for anyone wishing to lead a more conscious life.

B000IOM1YG|5.0|While [[ASIN:B00004TJLD I Robot]] and [[ASIN:B000A88FAO Eye in the Sky]] generally enjoy their fair share of accolades, The Project's third release has always struggled for the recognition it so richly deserves.  Given its cohesion both conceptually and musically, that somewhat low regard seems every bit as mysterious as the theme of the album itself.  But, then, if ever there was a complex theme cleverly shrouded in nuance and subtlety, it would be that of [[ASIN:B000026D3U Pyramid]]!<br /><br />The opening instrumental staggers the listener with an atmospheric ambience one would hope is destined for a proper quadraphonic presentation while the following \\"What Goes Up...\\" asks why, if nothing is lasting, even build a pyramid at all.  Colin Blunstone of The Zombies made his first appearance with The Project singing \\"The Eagle Will Rise Again\\" - a stunning ballad where a very young Pharaoh struggles to reconcile the deity he is proclaimed to be with the gnawing insecurities from which every child suffers.  (Curiously, this thought-provoking ballad was a favorite of the prodigious Kate Bush who would listen to it repeatedly in the late seventies.)  Of [[ASIN:B0017SSZ5Q One More River]] Alan, himself, has gone on written record saying, \\"this was better than anything we did on I Robot.\\"  Wow...that's a tall order for a shuffle to achieve, but \\"One More River\\" more than lives up to that assessment with its ambient bridge alone.  The radio hit [[ASIN:B0017SWW8M Can't Take It With You]] explains, in stark terms, how all the earthly treasures Tutankhamen accumulated throughout his short life won't be joining him in the next.  [[ASIN:B0017SSZ3S In The Lap Of The Gods]] is arguably the finest piece of experimental music that Parsons and Woolfson ever composed, not the least of which is due to some of the best orchestral arrangements Andrew Powell has ever crafted, but it also marks a turning point on the album where the deceased pharoah lay entombed in his singular mausoleum while the multitudes who built it rejoice over the fruits of their life's singular task.  Given all the heaviness of melancholy thought throughout PYRAMID, Woolfson and Parsons wisely saw the need for bit of humor.  At the much deserved expense of G. Patrick Flanagan and his, shall we say, questionable claims of pyramid power, [[ASIN:B0017SWWBO Pyramania]] is a send-up in the proud tradition Rodgers & Hammerstein.  [[ASIN:B0017T0G3E Hyper-Gamma-Spaces]] is another ambient instrumental by Alan Parsons that makes me pine for a quadraphonic surround mix on Sony's SACD.  Lastly, [[ASIN:B0017T0G1Q Shadow Of A Lonely Man]] closes in epic, albeit somber, proportions with the spirit of the dead pharoah hovering quietly over his earthly treasures in a museum exhibit as passersby examine them with varying degrees of interest.<br /><br />Ardent fans will revel in the bonus material.  I was particularly intrigued with [[ASIN:B0017SV3UK What Goes Up/Little Voice (Early Version Demo)]] and the two demo versions of \\"In The Lap Of The Gods.\\"  The vast improvement in sound quality from the original Arista disc is directly attributed to Sony's Direct Stream Digital sampling from the best source tapes available.  My only complaint is that this masterpiece is not available in surround on SACD.  I am pleased with this remaster for moderate volume listenings, but find myself wishing I could crank the volume from time to time without the subsequent signal clipping from my receiver.<br /><br />In any case, I do hope this missive helps to elucidate Pyramid's elusive liner note:<br /><br />\\"From the rise and fall of an ancient dynasty, to the quest for a key to unlock the secrets of the universe, this album seeks to amplify the haunting echoes of the past and explore the unsolved mysteries of the present.

0439023483|4.0|The Hunger Games is a science fiction novel aimed at the teen/young adult market. It is part Survivor (Yeah, I watch Survivor; it's one of my guilty pleasures), part gladiatorial games and part devshirme (the systematic collection of non-Muslim children as tributes by the Ottoman Empire). Well maybe that last is a little stretch; but maybe not either. The premise is that after some sort of catastrophic collapse of the United States a new government formed in North America, centered somewhere in the Rocky Mountains. A rebellion occurred and was brutally quashed and the survivors in twelve outlying regions now are subject peoples forced to participate in a deadly lottery once a year. From each of the twelve regions a girl and a boy (between the ages of 12 and 18) are chosen who will be forced to participate in a winner-take-all fight to the death Survivor-style. That is, they are all dropped in some wilderness and must compete for access to a limited amount of food and supplies in addition to the last-man standing takes all death match. It's all televised, of course, and some behind the scenes games makers rig the environment to boost ratings and force dramatic encounters between the various \\"tributes\\". The winner will be given free food and housing for life and his or her province will get extra food for the year, which is huge because they are generally kept on subsistence rations.<br /><br />The heroine of the tale is sixteen-year old Katniss Everdeen who chooses to take the place of her younger sister who was chosen on her very first time out in the lottery. The story is fast paced with many flashbacks to her life before the games, developing her into a complex character as well as exploring the social and economic implications of living in a totalitarian state. It's a coming of age story, but also --perhaps?-- a romance. A little grim at times and might be too much for some more sensitive souls; but the violence is never over the top and never graphic. Most of all a page turner I couldn't put down.turner I couldn't put down.
B000LB7G00|5.0|I have used this SpaceNavigator SE for a few months now on 3D modelling programs such as Inventor 9 and Solidworks 2008. I find it very helpful, although I wish it had more than two buttons. It does take a while to become accustomed to manipulating it, but it is well worth it.    I did find that the rubber on the bottom does not stick well to my desk's surface so I grabbed some spare silicone rubber sheet (McMaster-Carr part no. 86045K411) and trimmed it to match the bottom. It is really grippy. The fit and finish is very nice. The software is good and has enough adjustments to satisfy a picky user like myself. I wish more applications supported it though.    I am very happy I spent the money on it and would buy it again if I had to. It is also fun to watch coworkers use if for the first time as they fumble around. Most can't keep a solid model on the screen for very long :)

B00001U0DP|5.0|This is one of the greatest movies ever!  It's about a Jewish fellow in pre-WWII Italy who falls in love with a rich Italian Christian noble.  They get married and live happily as WWII erupts.  Their little son Jozue grows up oblivious to the horrors of the day thanks to his wonderful parents.  Jozue's father is an eternal optimist and displays an incredible love for live and optimism even as he and little Jozue are being deported to the concentration camp just before the arrival and liberation of the allies. His mother shows no less courage and love as she voluntarily steps on to the \\"death train\\" heading for the same camp as her husband and son.  The film has a bitter sweet ending, but is an incredible production and a must see.  If we feed this kind of productions to our children, there will be fewer drifters and fewer dropouts as this makes one think deeply about life and love and enduring values.    There are copies of the movie in English, but it's poorly dubbed.  Frankly the Italian version with subtitles is the way to see this movie!  Benigni delivers masterful performance and his expressions in Italian are probably impossible to duplicate via dubbing.  It's a gem!
0930289234|5.0|Notice how I put 2 exclamation points in the title.  They are well deserved!  This is the best graphic novel ever, and I don't even like hero stories!  I'm more of a horror reader.  This is a must have for any book collection.
B0010ZR160|1.0|After I read this book by Dennis Lehane, I went out and rented the movie.  I wanted to see how the director portrayed some of the more interesting side characters in the plot.  Cheese Olman for one.  The book was full of Dennis Lehane's complex portrayals of interesting characters, and the quality of the plot twists were in line with other Dennis Lehane books, such as Mystic River.  THAT movie, by the way, was a great adaptation of a great Lehane book.    I was appalled.  The characters were so altered that I had no ability to compare these portrayals between the book and the movie.  All characters became stereotypes reflecting today's typical scripts.  I hope Dennis Lehane had no part in creating the script for this movie - it was dull, shallow, and the language unnecessarily went into the gutter, the characters were mutated to uninteresting ones with no depth.  Even the characterization of the 2 main people, Angie and  Patrick, made them shallow and dull.     The two most spectacular actors in the movie, Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris, were poorly directed.  They had no depth and appeared to just read their lines - they are so much better than that.  Amy Madigan was portrayed as a strident, witchy woman, very unlike her character as written.       The book will give you a much better understanding of all the characters.  Don't waste your time with the movie.
0446530573|5.0|I did not know what to expect from this cookbook.    As a recent rabid fan of The Sopranos (in DVD courtesy Netflix) and being of a culture which like the Italians also worships food, fellowship, and Sunday dinner (Southern/Hispanic) a cook book would have to be exceptional to top my idea of 'eating,\\" best described as Paula Deen does Tex Mex/Creole.    The Sopranos Family Cookbook is 'all that' and more.    Several of the recipes are now family staples, the Penne a la Vodka, the basic marinara and the Caesar salad.    The commentary by characters in the show is well-presented and will give you a good chuckle if you are a fan.    Excellent photography.

Then you have the back to back genius of \\"Sweet Jane\\" and \\"Rock and Roll\\", and it's hard to see how this album could go wrong.    \\"Cool It Down\\" does not disappoint, and along with the laid back \\"New Age\\" they show how great of a songwriter Lou Reed is.  \\"Head Held High\\" is Lou Reed having a blast, complete with background handclaps.  \\"Lonesome Cowboy Bill\\" reminds me of southern rock and roll, while \\"I Found A Reason\\" is as beautiful as The Beatles \\"Because\\".  \\"Train Around The Bend\\" is decent rock and roll, while \\"Oh Sweet Nuthin\\" is an epic closing song similar to the Rolling Stones.    While \\"Loaded\\" is not their most experimental album (White Light/White Heat), their most beautiful album (Velvet Underground), or their best album (Velvet Underground and Nico), it is their most fun, and that's good enough.
B001E75QGG|5.0|Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull marks the return of a legend. I just don't understand the negativity. This is Indiana Jones. Unlike the others in the series, this film takes place in the 50's, which the filmmakers felt it should reflect the Sci-Fi films of that era, much like what they did with the other three and with the serials of the 30's.    In a series where thousands of years old boobie traps still work, surviving a plane crash with just a dingy, still being alive after having your heart ripped out, driving and crashing into a deep crater and walking out like nothing, as well as the countless other things that force you to expand your belief more than people realize, this film fits in just fine.     I honestly believe that anyone who can say anything bad about this film just doesn't get it.

B000077VR3|1.0|I bought this DVD at the urging of a trusted reviewer.  While I was entranced by the imaginative cuts and effects during the beginning credits, my companion and I were immediately turned off by the extreme over-acting.  Yes, I've been cautioned that this technique was used to satisfy the intended theatrical effect.  However, in my opinion, the desired effect was dreadful, distracting, and irritating.  Only the first 10 minutes of my DVD was ever touched by a laser.  Unless you're a masochist, save your money.

B0018AK9RA|5.0|I've been a fan since I was 14. I'm now 43.   Disliked all albums since and including Turbo... but here we've got something very different that's sure to please the old fans. This is the same Priest that made me daydream about Metal when I was a kid -- bombastic, heroic and powerful. Plus -- as an added bonus -- this time they threw in their maturity composition-wise... so it's just an amazing adventure!   Sure, the lyrics may seem a bit preposterous to some... but this is what Priest does, and they do it better than anyone. If you read Tolkien looking for \\"cheese\\" you simply missed the point... same idea with the Priest.   Listen to Nostradamus without prejudice. If you think you're \\"too cool\\" or \\"too jaded\\" I'm sure there's other bands for you out there. This one is for the more mature Metal fan who remembers that old feeling and wants it back without having to dust off old albums.   Judas Priest \\"grew up\\" alongside their fans and they deliver the Metal the way we want it today... not the way we wanted it 30 years ago!

Creative typography and text arrangement<br /><br />Truth:<br /><br />1.  House of Leaves is surprisingly linear, albeit with parallel storylines.  In each story, things happen in linear order; and, while you can start to get the idea that Zampano never existed by following them simultaneously, you would get that idea anyway by just reading Johnny's text.  Neither the Zampano text nor the Johnny Truant text is a pleasure to read.  Zampano's text is a mess of intentionally poor editing; footnotes that break the flow of narrative/discourse; and often multi-page, incredibly pointless, tangents.  Johnny's text is, itself, a digression that interrupts and damages Zampano's text; but it's also its own story, so that can be excused.  However, the frequent lack of punctuation and extremely train-of-thought style makes it read like a transcript of a 7th grader's video blog.<br /><br />2.  Yes, it is quite postmodern.  From my experiences with attempts to be pomo, I have come to understand this to be a bad thing in so many ways...<br /><br />3.  It's really not all that spooky in any way.  There is an element of angst to Johnny Truant, somewhat weakened by the two-page-long intentional-run-on, awful-to-read sentences; but the main text and the Navidson story is not very exciting.  This is because...<br /><br />4.  90% of the book is written like a bad LitCrit dissertation that hasn't been edited (or has been mangled in places, to make it annoying to read more than anything else).  You can flip through and find the weird parts.  They're cute, yet brief.  The worst part are the footnotes.  Half the story is in the footnotes, and they connect to the Zampano LitCrit dissertation crap in interesting ways...  but having to go back and forth to footnotes constantly (and not in that fun _Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell_ way) makes it unpleasant to read, but in a conventional way (overused footnotes) rather than a pomo way (like the infrequent wacky text paralleling twisted or panicked storyline sections).quent wacky text paralleling twisted or panicked storyline sections).

B001BR5F4C|5.0|REGARDING THE WHOLE BLOODY AFFAIR: First off, The Weinstein Company owns the rights to \\"The Whole Bloody Affair\\" when it arrives, so you can't fault Disney for releasing the one and only cut of this movie that they own. They do not, have not and will not have the ability to put out \\"The Whole Bloody Affair\\".<br /><br />And if you're waiting for \\"The Whole Bloody Affair\\" I hope you have other things to occupy your time. \\"TWBA\\" was first mentioned in 2004, and it's since been four long years without literally ANY actual progress on the front of that cut surfacing. The cut is NOT yet finished. I think people are under the impression that foreign cuts of KB are \\"TWBA\\" and they are NOT. Quentin has NOT YET CUT \\"THE WHOLE BLOODY AFFAIR\\" TOGETHER AT ALL. Every year he makes a promise that he's about to get to it, to no avail. I wouldn't say I'm actually skeptical it will ever come out (I'm sure Quentin wants to do it) but I'm not exactly holding my breath anymore either.<br /><br />So, in conclusion: Not only is \\"The Whole Bloody Affair\\" NOT coming out tomorrow or something, but it's not likely to come out for quite a long time (especially with Quentin starting Inglorious Bastards), and when it does, it won't be through Buena Vista.<br /><br />Thanks.<br /><br />EDIT: In 2011, the completed \\"Whole Bloody Affair\\" did finally premiere at the New Beverly in Los Angeles for a week during programming selected by Tarantino (who owns a stake in the theater). There is still no release date for a home video version.
B000X5SPBI|4.0|Hunting monsters isn't easy but when you've got a year to live because you've made a deal with the Devil to save your brother, well, it just makes it that much tougher. Add in a lady Demon who chooses to help the guys and a woman competing with them for supernatural artifacts named Bela Talbot (a clever tip of the hat to Bela Lugosi and Lawrence Talbot the former a horror movie icon the latter the name of the character played by Lon Chaney, Jr. in \\"The Wolf Man\\") and you've got a fun season. The third season of \\"Supernatural\\" was shorter than the first two because of the Writer's Strike but the writing,direction, performances, twists and turns and third season story arc make the third season just as compelling as the first two. A lot of shows seem to jump the shark by their third season but the show has a preternatural  ability to avoid shark infested waters other TV shows fall into (yes, \\"The X-Files\\" I'm looking at you).<br /><br />Sam and Dean Winchester face new monsters and demonns in some clever stories. The Christmas episode involving what appears to be Santa's Evil Brother (it's much more complex than that because, well, this is \\"Supernatural\\" and nothing is simple)and the return of Gordon the \\"Hunter\\" out to get Sam because he believes him to be the anti-Christ are both highlights of this short season.<br /><br />We get all 16 episodes in a nice, natural looking transfer. The show is shot in HD so there are occasional bits of video noise but it's nothing distracting. Audio sounds terrific particularly during action scenes.<br /><br />You can skip the intro on each episode if you want. We get deleted scenes for a number of episodes as well as seven featurettes on the challenges of producing that episode told from the point-of-view of one of the behind-the-scenes talent including visual effects, etc.  There are no commentary tracks this time around.

0452289963|1.0|The author's recommendations - acceptance, enjoyment, & enthusiasm - seem to diminish in that order in differentiating between someone who finds a new purpose in living and someone who is devoted to a selfish and materialistic lifestyle. Granted that \\"acceptance\\" is crucial at the gateway to a new inner self. But the latter two traits can be equally applicable to pursuing a materialistic lifestyle. Perhaps a more distinctive approach following acceptance would be \\"others-centeredness\\" and \\"personal satisfaction.\\" Acceptance seems the hardest challenge in a materialistic society. Once we accept our existence, we must realize that our purpose in life on earth is to care for others. In our materialistic society, an equally difficult challenge is to shift our focus to the welfare of others. But it is through this effort that we realize enjoyment, satisfaction of purpose, and self-worth. And enthusiasm then comes naturally.[[ASIN:0595463177 Love and Immortality: Long Journey of My Heart]]

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I've been a Joss Whedon fan for a while, and own all three of his series on DVD. Firefly is my favorite. There are more DVD extras in this set than there usually are, for the simple fact that the show was canceled well before it's time and the cast and crew were still invested in the show when the DVD was produced.<br /><br />The show is wonderful; any Whedon fan will enjoy it. Far too short, though. Fox did the show and it's fans a great disservice by not following Joss's vision for the show (airing the episodes out of order primarily, and not giving it a chance to find a fan base outside of die hard Whedon fans).
B0002I831S|4.0|One thing I noticed when looking at the playlist for Season 1 is that the episodes at the beginning are out of sequence. For example, the VHS tapes I have (also published by Paramount) have the first four episodes listed as: The Cage (not in the set, by the way); Where No Man Has Gone Before; The Corobomite Maneuver; Mudd's Women. The first disc, according to the booklet (haven't had a chance to watch these yet) shows: The Man Trap; Charlie X; Where No Man Has Gone Before; The Naked Time. This is radically different in sequence. While I am not a 100% purist, particularly where the original series goes (since the main characters were all at the same place at the end of each episodes), it is still odd that we have such a huge dichotomy in the sequence of the shows. It's at least slightly disturbing.

Debut significance and any innovation credit aside, almost all tracks here are just forgettable in their basic similarities compared to his next few years when he and the band hit a creative stride. The traditional sound remains, although mainly butchered beyond stereotype in most cases with luke-warm songwriting and sterile backing vocals. A few tracks that crept out to land on further compilations obviously pointed at deeper melodic strength which was to come. Fans undoubtedly embrace this as early gospel, but those looking around as a starting point would do well to steer clear.
0743289692|3.0|Hirsi Ali is a survivor.  She details her painful experiences as a Muslim female throughout her life vividly and candidly and deserves credit for that alone.  She escapes an arranged marriage and winds up seeking political asylum in Holland, where she eventually gets elected to serve in  Parliament<br />As she learns to appreciate her freedom, she begins questioning what she was taught about her religion: women are possessions, the problems Muslims face are created by the West and Jews, honor killings are acceptable etc.<br />She eventually leaves her religion behind, drawing attention to what she learned and experienced as evidence that her teachings were severely flawed.  How can the West, where there is so much freedom, and life is so much better than in Muslim countries, be the cause of their problems?  Why shouldn't women have an equal say in their choices?  Why should women have to hide their bodies lest men have uncontrollable sexual attractions to them, and men not have to hide their bodies, as if women had no concept of  sexual attraction?  Why could women walk down the streets in Holland with their legs, arms, necks showing, and not get raped every second?  If a woman gets raped, why is it her fault?<br />Hirsi Ali rejected the notions that the West had any part of the plight of Muslims, and for her bravery, received many threats to her life.  Indeed the director Theo Van Gogh was murdered because of his involvement in a documentary he made in conjunction with her.<br />Hirsi Ali repudiated what she was taught about the West multiple times, but never said anything about how what she was taught about Jews was incorrect.  As late as 9/11 (2001), she mentioned that she could have understood what happened on 9/11 (please note, I'm not saying she condoned what happened), had the hijackers been Palestinian, and left notes saying that the terrorist acts were against the US because of its support for Israel.  Yet she never addressed what she said about Jews in terms of any enlightened experiences or knowledge.  She did speak about the embarrassment Holland felt for its complicity with Hitler, which would have been a perfect time to mention her feelings, yet they weren't addressed.<br />Hirsi Ali went to great lengths to show how and why she rejected her early teachings.  Every single objection was gone over repeatedly.  Yet she never addressed the claims about how Jews were responsible for Muslim problems.<br />I wrote to her at the American Enterprise Institute where she works, about my concern asking for her to address that, and received a letter from an associate telling me that Hirsi Ali reads all her email, but doesn't have  the time to answer everyone. Fine.  But it would have made sense to be directed to some writing where this issue was addressed.  Apparently, there isn't any.<br />I was torn between giving this book five stars or one.

Yet she never addressed the claims about how Jews were responsible for Muslim problems.  I wrote to her at the American Enterprise Institute where she works, about my concern asking for her to address that, and received a letter from an associate telling me that Hirsi Ali reads all her email, but doesn't have  the time to answer everyone. Fine.  But it would have made sense to be directed to some writing where this issue was addressed.  Apparently, there isn't any.  I was torn between giving this book five stars or one.  I decided to split the difference, and encourage the writer to explore her feelings and write about what Muslims say about Jews.

B000055XMF|4.0|I always liked the movie and only had a used VHS copy.  The DVD I bought was in good shape and I enjoyed watching QUADROPHENIA ON THE DVD format.  I have watched it a couple of times.  I did have some trouble with the  extra features (sub titles) coming on when I switched scenes during movie using the main menu. I would have to go back in main menu and keep turning the sub titles off.  But if I watch the DVD all the way through without interruption I had no words popping up on me.  Just For Today.

B0017VG69U|4.0|\\"Star Trek: The Original Series - The Complete Second Season (Remastered)\\"<br />(Released: Summer, 2008)<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />So, the original 1960s \\"Star Trek\\" has been given the George Lucas treatment and had new special effects digitized in to make it look more modern and \\"realistic.\\" The stars look starrier and there are more of them, the exterior shots show a more detailed model of the Enterprise, planets look more realistic as the starships circle them (with clouds and layered atmospheres) And, perhaps, if my eyes don't fail me, the non-special effects interior shots look like they may have had their color and contrast punched up a little (although I could be wrong about that...)<br /><br />Personally, I don't see the point -- if you're going to be a true, red-blooded Trekkie, you should fully enjoy the robust kitschiness of the original series, including loving how fake the space stuff looked (or rather, how much \\"of its time\\" it was: if that's what Rodenberry and Company actually created in the late '60s, then embrace it, enjoy it, celebrate it and appreciate it for the TV time capsule it is. It's wowed fans for over forty years, so why fix what ain't broken?) Also, the alterations are relatively minor: most of the action takes place in interior locations, or on outside lots, so the opportunities to goose up the special effects only take up a little screen time. (One exception is the extensive remake of the \\"Doomsday Machine\\" episode, which looks pretty cool. Also, they re-recorded the intro theme, doing away with that super-shrill female chorus -- an alteration that, again, I find a little questionable...)<br /><br />Still, I suppose that the fact that the majority of the other Amazon reviews are more concerned with the technical specifications of the delivery formats -- rather than whether we should digitally alter the culture of the past -- is indicative of where this is all headed. It's a slippery slope, but doubtless some day all these old TV episodes will be completely overhauled and made into 3-D virtual reality adventures in which you can play any character you want (try not to be a red-shirt!) etc. etc. The march of technology will go on: Fred Astaire will dance with a vacuum cleaner, Han Solo won't shoot first, the Enterprise will no longer look like it was made of balsa wood. I suppose the real tipping point is whether or not The Powers That Be will still allow us to see and buy the original versions: I personally think that it's better to watch TV shows and movies the way they were originally released. Just because you can alter them, doesn't mean that you should. In this case, though, little harm is done. Kirk is still Kirk, Spock is still Spock, McCoy still says \\"He's dead, Jim!\\" in almost every episode. And the new planets do look cool. Beam me up, Scotty!

B00009L1UP|5.0|I first bought this album at the age of 11 after hearing (what else) Silent Lucidity on the radio. Queensryche soon became my favorite band and I listened to this album almost every day.  The music of Empire was \\"mainstream\\" in that it was accessible, but in this case the music wasn't dumbed-down or vapid or any of the other things associated with (some) \\"mainstream\\" music. Empire was well-written, well-played and well-sung. In my opinion, this was Geoff Tate's best recording, too; the operatic styles of the early days were impressive, but his singing on Empire was more \\"real\\" and had more soul, and after Empire, his voice went downhill (I'm sorry, but it did).    That year I slowly got a hold of all of Queensryche's other albums, some of which were an acquired taste: at first I thought were just weird and didn't understand them, but over the years I grew to love. That year I also got exposed to heavy metal and discovered Dream Theater. To this day, I mostly listen to metal and progressive rock, and I wonder what I would be listening to if I hadn't started out with Queensryche. So, I think of Queensryche as a \\"gateway\\" band too.     Mindcrime is pretty stellar, but if I really had to choose, I'd say this was my favorite Queensryche album. I've owned it for years and years and to this day I still enjoy listening to it. I like every song that's on it, and even appreciate different songs at different times. This album changed the direction of my life. Silent Lucidity will always be my #1 song of all time and Queensryche will always have a place in my heart.
B000X1Z0BU|2.0|Now don't get me wrong, my two-star rating has nothing to do with the movie itself. Once was easily one of the best movies I saw last year, it is definitely one of the finest and most moving musicals I've ever seen, and has some of the finest music you will ever hear. My frustration lies in the U.S. DVD version of the film, specifically its audio.    I received Once as a Christmas present last year shortly after it came out on DVD. I went to watch it again and immediately realized the audio playback was wrong. It was half a step too slow, so all the songs were out of key and the voices sounded somewhat lower than when I first saw the film. I tried other DVD players and got the same result.    So I was disappointed, but I assumed that since the DVD had just been released this had just been an error in DVD authoring. Many DVDs have had to be recalled or reissued because of a glitch or mistake of some kind. So nine months later, the DVD is still circulating well and the movie is even being shown on HBO (and played perfectly in tune to boot), so I finally head back out and buy a fresh new copy of the DVD...and get the same result. The audio is still wrong, still flat, there are other DVD formats, a CD soundtrack and a TV broadcasting of the film offering sound evidence of an audio discrepancy, but nothing has been done about it.    This is why I'm so frustrated. I love Once, and I want to see it in its finest musical form. Too bad I live in the U.S. which just happens to get the short end of the stick in the audio playback department. My advice to any other U.S. viewers, watch the movie on HBO or watch the DVD on one of those players in which you can actually adjust the audio pitch on the disc playback by half steps. Or just hope that the DVD is some day rereleased and something is finally done about this. What a frustrating setback for an excellent film.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|Jeremy Isaacs did an extraordinarily thorough and exhaustive series with this piece of work. I am a WW2 documentary collector and I am up to, easily, over 150 DVD's, but this remains my favorite, even though mazaingly-enough, it was produced over 30 years ago. In order to truly appreciate this work, one must appreciate the thorough nature of the series itself: For example, we see living interviews with Manteuffel, Kaye Sommers (Ike's driver), Doenitz, Karl Wolff, Albert Speer, etc ... as well, the illstrated maps are easily to follow and eductaional in their explanation of movement .... the archival footage of troops, battlegrounds, Nazi Germany, Axis and Allied leaders, the before-after shots of France+Germany+England etc ..... the interviews with Jeremy Isaacs, Stephen Ambrose (Band of Brothers), plus shots of ALL the political eaders (Hitler, Churchill, Stalin, Roosevelt, Truman, Eisenhower, etc) ..... Altogther, if you want a true and living history of WW2 and the WAY IT WAS ... you MUST have this documentary .... it may be a bit pricey, but that is becuase it is worth every penny and the fact it was created in 1974, yet still remain the quintessential collectors piece, speaks volumes in and of itself ... Hats off to you, Sir Jeremy!
B001DDBCUU|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. I think it was just as good as the series itself. It was great to see the fabulous girlfiends together again and their new outfits and the way they changed and how they were doing in general. I laughed and I cried as I watched the movie. It definitely met my expectations. My friend and I were among the first people to see it and she liked it as much as I did.<br /> I own all the seasons of Sex and the City and I will buy this movie.<br />It's a must see for everyone who loved the series.

B00001U0E1|4.0|Others reviewers have taken issue with how historically inaccurate \\"Shakespeare in Love\\" is, and even if they're right on every count, they're missing the point.  This movie spins its own story, giving an improbable yet poignant context to Shakespeare's [[ASIN:0743477111 Romeo and Juliet]].  It's not meant to be a documentary of the writer's life, nor does it boast that it tells a true story.  The most history buffs could expect are a few grins here and there, what with the scene Christopher Marlowe plotting out \\"Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter\\" that nods to the \\"Shakespeare didn't write his own plays\\" theory, the inclusion of the sadistic child John Webster, and the many lines of dialogue Shakespeare hears and later incorporates into his plays.  These are all quite enjoyable, and should help any uptight history buff to remove the stick etcetera etcetera so they can enjoy this film for what it is.<br /><br />On the acting side, things are nothing but great.  I, for one, hate the institution of \\"big name actors\\" and think that most small time television stars do better jobs than your Pitts or Damons, but I really can't complain about Gwyneth Paltrow in this film.  She does a wonderful, wonderful job, but it truly serves to compliment the performance of Joseph Fiennes as Shakespeare.  He is a force of life on film, giving a passionate, hilarious, and downright sad portrayal of what many people see as the greatest writer in the English language.  In my opinion, it would have been impossible to do a better job.<br /><br />It's an intelligently written and passionately acted film with attention to details in plot and character development that is truly impressive.  This is very much worth owning on DVD.<br /><br />8/10
0439023483|4.0|Even though reading is one of my favorite leisure activities, I haven't had much time to do it lately.  The Hunger Games was so engrossing that I stayed up way too late two nights in a row to finish it.      The story takes place sometime in the (maybe not so far) future in Panem, a North American nation that used to be the United States and is now ruled by the cruel, sophisticated and ruthless Capitol. Panem is divided into twelve districts and each is required to send one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to the annual Hunger Games, a terrifying fusion of reality show and Roman Colliseum death match.     The heroine is sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen whose father died in the coal mines of their impoverished Appalachian District 12.  She lives with her mother and younger sister Primrose, and supplements their meager income by hunting and gathering in the forbidden woods.  When Primrose is chosen as one of the \\"tributes\\", Katniss immediately volunteers to take her place.  The other \\"tribute\\" is a boy who years before, had saved her from starving by risking punishment at the hands of his hardhearted mother in order to give her two loaves of bread.     The most interesting part of the story to me is how Katniss uses survival skills that she has learned in hunting and foraging to keep herself alive. There are the typical young adult fiction points where she must make decisions between morality and survival.  The conclusion is satisfying but you should know ahead of time that this is part of a series and not all questions are answered at the end of this book.  On the positive side, I'm looking forward to reading more by this author.  She really knows how to keep your interest and keep you reading past midnight.
0316010669|5.0|A fascinating study of how the mind works and the effects our gut reactions can have on our decisions, \\"Blink\\" hammered Gladwell's point into me in an engaging and entertaining read. The writing is easy but intelligent, and I loved the specific examples and stories, particularly one about the war games. Not only do they help support Gladwell's notion but they're enough to create enjoyable stories by themselves.<br /><br />The main idea I took away? First impressions aren't everything, but they're a lot more than you realize.

1595141715|4.0|I saw Jay Asher speak at UCLA's Festival of Books a few months back, and when he read part of the book it sounded so intriguing that I immediately put it on my list. Now that I've finally got around to reading it, I'm glad I stumbled into that session on Young Adult fiction those months ago.<br /><br />This is the story of a girl who committed suicide, then recorded 13 sides of 7 cassette tapes, each devoted to someone who drove her to take her own life. The novel begins with the narrator receiving a mysterious box full of cassette tapes, popping one in the player, and finding out that Hannah Baker put him on her list. It's a little awkward in the beginning chapters, and even immature and unimportant, which wasn't really what I was expecting from the story of a girl who killed herself. However, it really picks up steam and tackles some pretty heavy issues in the second half. And it never takes the easy way out and cheapens the story by making concessions, which also surprised me from a YA novel. I look forward to reading more from Asher.
B000YDOOUK|4.0|This is a great Hard Rock CD.  Built for driving fast, drinking hard and generally jumping around.  Its been in my car all summer long!    Other reviews have mentioned that they sound like AC/DC; I would argue that they really are closer to the sound of KIX.   Check KIX's debut cd and you'll see that Airbourne owes more to them than AC/DC.  Faster, less bluesy.  Another review mentioned Rhino Bucket as sounding similar too; which I wanted to point out that that band has a former KIX guitarist.

B00005JLEJ|5.0|If you are into Kurosawa's battle war films, you will enjoy the epic drama of Kagemusha (Kawgaymoosha).  It is about illusion, deception, identity and tribal battle clans.  I believe there have been lengthier versions of the original film.  But it most certainly deserves a second viewing, as it can become confusing with doubles and flashback.  The scenes are lengthy and long shots are used, making it difficult to closely identify the characters.  The impressive costumes lend to the reality of the period.<br /><br />Known as an epic drama, the film takes place in Japan during the 1500's.  The drama leads with the knowledge of a clan warlord killed and with the intent of surviving battle with the other clans, the death is covered up by a petty thief who bears a striking resemblance.  The thief becomes comfortable as the leader of the clan and then, onto defend his clan.  With that, you will see lengthy battle scenes.  Although, it remains confusing to me, battle scenes and Japan warlords are not really my type of film.  One needs time to absorb the depth of the film, especially with another viewing, and don't attempt to watch while sleepy.<br /><br />Kurosawa's paintings!<br />During the Extras on the DVD, you will learn that in his frustration to get the movie financed, over a great time span to do so, while waiting, Kurosawa visioned how he wanted scenes to appear and he painted hundreds of storyboards.  The DVD comes with a booklet that details intricate information about the plot and it contains many sheets of the paintings!<br /><br />You will also learn how Kurosawa relied on the aid George Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola in bringing this masterpiece to the screen.  The interview with the pair is very insightful.  Also another excellent interview provides extensive details about the Master and making of the film.  To fully understand the warlords, clans, battles, nuances, etc, listen the film with the remarkable commentary.  ...Rizzo
0441013597|4.0|\\"Dune\\", written by Frank Herbert<br /><br />The Atreides family is scurrying about on their home world of Caladan in preparation for their journey. The Atreides have been awarded the fief of the desert planet Arrakis also known as Dune. The planet Dune is rich in a substance called spice which people all across the universe use for different purposes but the true power of the spice is known to only a few. What all know is that the controller of the Fief of Arrakis can make themselves rich and powerful. The former controllers of Dune, the Harkonnen's are plotting the death of Duke Letto Atreides for having been awarded the Fief and the death of his whole family. The Atreides are well aware of the peril they face, even young Paul Atreides the Duke's son. Paul has been prepared all of his life for the challenges he will face and his training along with the spice is bound to make him something more than human...<br /><br />I was somewhat skeptical going into Dune. The book is held in such high regard and books that have so much hype surrounding them rarely live up to it. The books opens up slow and wasn't quick to grab my full attention which had me thinking that once again the legend had exceeded the reality. But after a slow start the hooks finally set and I was eager to see where the story was going.<br /><br />The Good: As many have likely noted, Herbert has built a complex, and unique universe with great depth. The overall government is led by a tyrannical Emperor that also comprises royal families. The Guild who are the only ones capable of deep space travel and hence have a vast amount of say regarding war and the transport of troops etc. The natives of Dune who have their own culture and religion with such great emphasis placed on water. As I said, a vast reaching and complex universe.<br /><br />The character development and evolution were all well done and the way Herbert was able to tie his complex universe together regarding Dune at the climax was masterful.<br /><br />The Bad: The only bad was that it took a while for the story to get my full attention but once it did I was hooked for the duration.<br /><br />Overall: Did Dune live up to the hype? Can anything really live up to that much hype? Dune was masterfully done though and if you haven't read it pick it ASAP.at it took a while for the story to get my full attention but once it did I was hooked for the duration.

B000026156|4.0|\\"Conference Of The Birds\\" starts with a blast -- \\"Four Winds\\" gets straight to the point with a fast, lively melody and fast, lively playing by the band.  Sam Rivers and Anthony Braxton share the saxophone and flute playing, and they are excellent throughout.  This version of \\"Four Winds\\" is superior to the one Holland recorded in 1988 with Steve Coleman and Jack DeJohnette.  The second song, \\"Q & A\\" is a very free song.  At points, given its slow pace a whistling flutes, you think it could be called \\"Conference Of The Birds\\", but of course it isn't.  The title track is a great tune - it has a witchy, beguiling melody, and ends too soon.  \\"Interception\\" is boiling fast, and starts with wild soloing.  It's a blast from start to finish, and you don't realize there's a written-out riff until the very end.  \\"Now Here\\" is a slow song, and Holland's bass playing is most prominant.  \\"See-Saw\\" is another fast one, though it's more structured than \\"Interception\\".       This is a fantastic CD, it doesn't sound dated, and every jazz fan should get it.
031606792X|5.0|This book and the first book are my faviorate of the 4 Stephanie Meyer Series. I like her style of writing and the story has a quality all its own. Really all the books are neat and I found that reading them in sequence 1-4 was the best way to go. I like things in the other two books as well. And the stories go together in a fun way.     All around a fun read. There are parts I would say are not suitable for younger audiances.  I am glad that Stephanie chose to show good moral standards as the charicters waited until marriage for \\"knowing\\" each other. However I would rate the 4th book PG13 because of married intimacy. She isn't too explicit though and I appreciated that.

Of course, opinions greatly differ as to which songs are the best! You may prefer to simply concoct your own personal anthology of our dear Van Morrison. On the other hand, this (the 3-CD version) is a very good, if not ever perfect, choice of songs.
1559211407|5.0|If you are a lover or collector of books, or a reader of good literature, this one is for you. An epistolary novel, it consists of letters mainly between Helene Hanff, a none-too-successful writer in Manhattan, and Frank Doel, a clerk in a bookstore at 84 Charing Cross Road in London. It has been a successful stage play and movie. The English were still suffering from the hardships of WWII and rationing was still going on when the letters commenced in 1949. Hanff sends her book requests for out-of-print books, and she gets them at amazingly reasonable prices.<br /> A close friendship develops between the two, and she sends rationed items including eggs to the store staff and Doel's family. The book ends in 1969. Through this twenty-year correspondence the reader gets to know a great deal about the two letter writers as well as other people who are workers in the store, neighbors or friends. Hanff's love of books is the thread that keeps the story together. She grows more relaxed and outspoken as the book progresses.<br /> Hanff becomes a TV writer, but she never hits it big. Throughout she wants to go to England to meet Frank, his family, and the store staff. Something always seems to interfere. She comes across as the consummate Manhattanite, and he is the somewhat reserved Brit. Her outspokenness, slangy humor, and generosity emerge in the epistles. Hanff playfully needles Frank about the slowness with which he delivers some of her book requests.<br />A novel told in letters can have severe limitations, but this one manages to present characters who grow and evolve, a sense of two cities, and a plot that can draw you into the narrative.<br /> It's a gentle book, a soft, fluffy pillow of a book that doesn't have great pretensions. It's a little story that meanders along giving quiet, unassuming pleasure. First published in 1970 it seems old-fashioned and quaint, yet it is fun to read. Hanff's requests are mostly for non-fiction until she decides to acquire Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\" She becomes a Janite, the perfect author for someone with her sensibilities.<br /> The recent best seller \\"The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Society\\" is also an epistolary novel, but it's a richer, more complex, and varied book than this one.

B0018D4SHY|3.0|Granted, Little Richard is the essence of rock 'n' roll; his music is, for the most part, loud and fast and unforgettable. This CD is good - but not great; there are hundreds of reissues of this material on other CDs; the Specialty Box Set of Richard's recordings is the ultimate for any fan. The promise of a couple of extra tracks that have not been released sounds enticing but the quality of the promise does not reach the premise. One cannot help but wonder: why aren't all the unreleased Richard songs released by now? There are Paris concerts and who knows what other treasures someone has recorded but not made available. This, though, is not that great a treasure. I bought it; I liked it; I wish there were more of it.
B0001Z53MY|5.0|I am very suspicious to say something about this classic , i come from a time where music used to stick out by being sung or made by selective acts and commercial business was even more into a finer good taste..so when this album came out it was a real shocker , all cuts are undoubtly refined, sophysticated and i can even think elton john himself would never disagree with the spreadout opinion that this record is one of the best things ever made in the show business. He would not ever get to repeat that. We can tell, we have remained alive through all this time... Sound here couldn't be more vivid . Buy yours too.
0060512806|5.0|I really liked Neal Stephenson's Snow Crash.  Then recently someone recommended this book by saying \\"It's like Snow Crash, with more ADHD.\\"    I was sold, and Cryptonomicon exceeded my expectations.  There are numerous digressions that are really funny, partly because you find yourself entertained the whole way.  Like a stand-up comic, Neal Stephenson will suddenly veer off into a side-anecdote and then slams you back in a way that's fun all by itself.    The biggest complaint to this book is that the ending is oddly-standard compared to the rest of the book.  Some authors seem to start with a great problem and a great solution, which creates a great ending.  Intead, similar to Orson Scott-Card's books, it feels like Neal Stephenson starts with a great premise, fully enjoys developing the story, then thinks \\"ok, I think that's enough. Hmmm... What's a great way to end the book from here?\\"    *shrug*  I still give it 5 stars.  I'll always prefer a great story with contrived ending over a contrived story with a great ending.    Here's an example and litmus test for whether or not you should buy this book... and it's a slight spoiler, but only of a digression, so I think you'll forgive me...    At one point, the book digresses for a few pages into a character's ability to solve scientific problems as a function of his sex drive, complete with graphs as if right out of a math textbook!  Now, if you would be annoyed by such a digression or the geek-factor of it then you should stay away.    However, if you are intrigued, amused, or especially both, then you are probably a geek like me, and you should buy it.  Now.
1595141715|5.0|Jay Asher's Thirteen Reasons Why is the story of Hannah Baker, suicide victim, and the series of events that drove her to her final, desperate act.  The story is told in her own voice through a series of tapes left behind for Clay, her would-be love, a teenager baffled by Hannah's actions and searching for some sort of perspective on her death.     Through Hannah's story and Clay's reaction, we find just how the thoughtless things we do every day negatively impact those around us, and just how much the loss of a life can mean.  Never condescending or dishonest about teen suicide, Asher focuses on the \\"snowball effect,\\" where no single truly horrifying thing happens to Hannah but, taken altogether and over time, \\"small\\" things drive her completely over the edge.      Parents and teens will be able to appreciate Asher's fluid style.  He flawlessly transitions between voices (Clay and Hannah) and stories as he weaves together a tight and tragic tale of teen hopelessness.    If you're looking for a book about peer pressure, the impact of rumors and bullying, or about suicide in order to open a dialog with your teen (or even just to understand what he or she might be going through), this fantastic (and dark) book is the one you want.
B0012X6FT4|5.0|Elvis's first disk with the Attractions (Steve Nieve, Bruce and Pete Thomas) burns brightly even today.  The songwriting is wonderfully acerbic, the band sound is stripped down to a live feel, and each musician kills.  A must own!
B0018O4YSQ|5.0|It was pure chance that I watched Alex Proyas's masterpiece back in 1998. Nothing better to watch, so although the trailer left much to be desired, in I went. Lucky me: the movie blew me away, in much the same way that Neo's \\"this isn't real?\\" would blow me away the following year. I won't spend more time discussing the merits of the movie itself, let's just say it ranks in my top 3 as a stunning work of art and philosophy.    The changes in the Director's Cut are actually quite significant, and watching it I repeatedly raised my eyebrows and even gasped at a few of the scene changes. I still haven't decided which version of the movie is better, but thankfully both are on the disc for your viewing pleasure.    The image quality is everything you would expect from Blu-Ray... Watching it on my friend's Pioneer Plasma was a fantastic experience. As you can imagine, black levels are extremely important in this movie, and Proyas's excellent cinematography can really shine in this format. The surround sound is equally amazing.    I haven't checked out the extras but this is a great movie in a great presentation. It's a must-buy.
0823003035|3.0|As some others have said this book is good for artists who have some mild experience.  But no doubt techniques such as enveloping, blocking in, and learning how to scan your eyes to see form is something that is very important.  This of course this isn't the whole picture to drawing technique, and as one review said following his technique could to some degree eventually make your drawings a bit like his; if perhaps you ever got such a precise eye.  So don't take this book and try to become the next Tony Ryder. I recommend borrowing it.  If you know how to block in figures and break down form, shade and so on, this book won't be of much use to you except to see Ryder's drawings (which tend to get boring since they're more about preciseness and not the work).  But Ryder is a good guy and doing his part for classical realism. So if you got the money support him and support the movement!
B00005JNS0|5.0|This movie is action-packed, bright, fast, and fun.  It's no wonder why it is still popular after two years of being released.  I have a 16-month old son, and a son going on three years old.  They love this movie!  Great music... I plan to purchase the soundtrack (if available) for Christmas for listening in our car.  Enjoy!
B000HT2P9S|5.0|Neil Gaiman is an amazing storyteller. His characters simply ARE whoever he says they are, no matter how outlandish a premise he starts off with.<br /><br />A Ndebele lady with a click in her last name and twelve gold rings about her neck is an instant New Yorker, all she needs is a cab license. This phenonmena is kind of what's going on in the book. I totally love it, especially since most of the novel takes place in the American midwest during winter, and the protagonist drives a beater. Each one of these elements are something just about anyone in the US can identify with.<br /><br />It's got a schizophrenic and humble quality to it, because the characters are from everywhere, which is kind of how the US really is.<br /><br />Not bad for a Minnesotan with a British accent.

B00062IDCO|5.0|This was the last season I needed for this series and I am now excited that I have them all. Star Trek Voyager is a great series and I look forward to watching them for a long time. Purchasing from amazon.com was easy and fast. I recieved the product only a few days after I put in the order and it arrived to me with no damage to the DVDs. I will defiantly continue to purchase items, like this and more from this site.
B000E33VWW|5.0|In an age of movies that are loud, brash, violent and special FX laden I was so impressed to see a movie where I wanted to sit right up close to the TV to catch every word. They don't make any good thought provoking movies anymore but seeing this movie renewed my faith that there are still some good people out there making fine films like this. To all the folks who were involved in the making of this film I say a big thank you. I haven't been lost in a movie in a long time till this came along.
0670020745|5.0|I bought this book after seeing a video of Jill Bolte Taylor talking about her experiences on Youtube.  My only complaint is that I wanted more!  I consider it to be one of the most amazing and important books ever written.  It should be compulsory reading for all stroke victims, their loved ones and medical personnel.  Oh, and probably for everyone with a brain as well.  You read it and you are likely to want to go and hug Jill for a couple of hours for being.
B0013D8LOK|1.0|The original 1936 black and white making of this film certainly left something for your imagination and leaves Tim Burton's film in the dust. I'm surprised Johnny Depp fell for the discusting and poor taste of the film's direction and it's too bad Mr. Burton doesn't have the film making skills to leave something for your imagination as the original version.  Hitchcock would have directed this movie in a way that would have you leaving the theatre feeling better than then when you arrived, not feeling like you need to take an antacid tablet. Instead Tim goes for the easy. It's amazing how actor's/director's taste have gone downhill.  He ruined this film with his Hollywood slasher theme and was a waste of money to see.
B000GTJT0C|4.0|There's so much less to Tomb Raider than meets the eye. Despite Jolie's pneumatic efforts, the whole film falls dramatically to pieces after even a moment's consideration.  Here's the thing: if Lara's dad wants to stop the triangle being rebuilt so that its destructive power won't be unleashed on the world, and it requires the clock to get hold of the triangle, why does he tell Lara where the clock is in the first place? Furthermore, if two parts of this artefact are necessary to make it work, Lara surely doesn't need to destroy both. Why doesn't she just destroy the first part when she gets it, as this would make the second part useless? Thirdly, when we find out finally that the triangle needs a further part, where is it? Inside the clock, of course. Surely this begs the question, why not just destroy the piece inside the clock, which Richard Croft actually had in his possession, thus rendering the triangle inoperative?  The fact that Bryce watches the Clangers was the only thing that stopped this movie being a total waste of time.
1401216676|4.0|Joker is my favorite villain of all time.  I have wanted to get this comic for ages.  The whole story line of how he came to be the Joker seemed rushed and the whole insanity saga with Commissioner Gordon played out like the boat scene in the Dark Knight...long, boring, and making no sense at all.  Also, the Joker just needed to be in the comic more being crazy as a loon and doing what the Joker does...much like the Joker needed to be in the Dark Knight A LOT more.  But the comic ends with a great joke and a pretty weird sililoquoy by a deranged 18 year old...didn't get that one.  Overall a great graphic novel from a great artist, just needed more of the Joker in it.
B000IJ7J0W|5.0|i got this cd on the positive review from amg some years back, though seeing the review again here doesn't do it the justice that the songs deserve. i always loved take on me and the sun always shines, though my sister didn't care for take on, anyhoo, when i got this cd it became an immediate fav of the synth-pop era. i felt like i should've known about this earlier, but better late than never right? the songs.... lush, dancy, sophisticated and yes catchy as all getout. living a boy's adventure tale is brilliance, blue sky is brilliance, other than like one song towards the end (forget which one, sorry), this cd is top shelf, even THAT song isn't bad, just not as good as the songs up until them, and the cd ends on such a strong note, you can't believe they had such killer tunes to end the album, and not sleepy boring ballads, or just plain filler. this got me to buy the other 2 following which have songs that are essential. if you love this one (which you should), it will get you curious enough to get the other 2 from this era, which are just as solid when they are on (me i'm touchy, touchy touch you)

0385720920|5.0|The author of fight club, Chuck Palahniuk's novel Choke is my personal favorite.  Its about a guy on his fourth step in his sexalocholic class and has to visit his mother who is out of her mind.  This novel is very good in humor and makes you want if your personality was shaped my you own mom.  I recomemend that anyone who has like the movie fight club will like this book.  I also recomenend his other books as well.
B00104W8T6|2.0|This CD only had a few good songs.  The rest of it, such as a track consisting entirely of random humming, was unprofessional and not the least bit entertaining.  The movie was funny and held my attention, however the soundtrack was a sad disappointment.
0321544080|2.0|Although the photos in this book a great there is minimal information on how to set the photo up. In addition, most of the hints are not for the beginner or tourist as they involve light boxes and various other pieces of equipment. I was disappointed with this book. If you're interested in learning more about the composition of a photo (with your camera as your only piece of equipment) I would suggest The Photographer's Eye by Freeman. I bought these two books at the same time and have found Freeman's book very instructive, although there are many other how-to books on composition that are probably just as good. But as for McNally's book, its now on my coffee table amongst the other pretty to look at books.
B0015519VS|2.0|I'm not a HUGE usher fan like most chic's BUT his last album Confessions was amazing. Now, this album was a HUGE let down and Usher knows it because he is firing most of the people who had a job in his current project. I'm 100% sure that Usher will regain his crown as the King Of R&B, Justin Timberlake's latest produced by Timberlake stomped Usher and exceled on Billboard charts for months.

B000002MTU|1.0|First, let me say I have nothing against white blues guitar slingers.  Love Bloomfield and Jonny Winter.<br /><br />Second, as a \\"classic rock dude\\" Clapton can't be beat.  Layla, and all that other stuff- its seminal classic rock.  The guy almost defines the genre.<br /><br />However, as a blues player, and especially as a blues singer, he is way overrated.  People float him five stars because of the above classic rock god status.  \\"Clapton?  I love Clapton.  Five stars.\\"<br /><br />The licks are ok, the solos are ok when he keeps them short.  When he tries to go gonzo on a slow blues, he just sounds silly.  Everything after Bluesbreakers was downhill for the guy blues-wise.<br /><br />And the singing.  Terrible.  Imagine the whitest dude you know- Nay, the whitest BRITISH dude you know, trying to sing blues.  Some can pull it off: Robben Ford, Jonny Winter, NOT Clapton.  He sounds awful.<br /><br />In summary: as classic rock dude: wonderful.  As gut bucket blues stringer: emberassing
0930289234|5.0|Absolutely phenomenal book. I know you can buy it anywhere now that the movie's coming out but Amazon's price is the most reasonable by far. This book is worth every cent I paid and it's definitely worth owning. I loved it!
031606792X|1.0|I was disgusted by this book.  I give it one star for Bella's wedding.  That should have been at the end of Eclipse.(and Jacob should have imprinted upon Alice, and the series should have ended there)I was a rabid fan, itching to get my paws on Breaking Dawn.  And I wish I hadn't.  Not only does Ms. Meyer completely depart from her original rules for the vampire world, but her vivid ability to write characters so that you care for them suffered horribly.  i stopped reading after Jacob imprinted on the baby.  That was disgusting, as was Bella in her human form drinking blood, and Rosalie ripping open Bella's stomach with her teeth so the child could breath.  This book is nothing like the others.  So many other problems.  So sad.  It should have been so much better.
0671015206|3.0|This is an interesting book with some insights to offer. Though these ideas are not earth-shattering or new, the presentation is novel, increasing the chance that some of the simple and clearly true advice offered may actually sink in. On the other hand, the authors have some underlying moral assumptions which they themselves may not realize are dubious, and which color their work,    This is what I mean: First, as to their insights, the authors demonstrate how wealth is acquired and maintained by the people who actually accumulate it, millionaires and/or those people who retain and build on a sufficient portion of what they earn to become financially independent. They define this as an ability to continue indefinitely in their current or similar lifestyle, without any additional earnings.    Theses people have certain traits and choices in common- a lot of which would be admirable without reference to money- such as doing what they think is appropriate and sensible, rather than what their neighbors do and admire. They drive used cars, instead of wasteful new vehicles, spend on education for their children, rather than fancy clothes, etc.    Perhaps most importantly, from a financial perspective, they live at or below their means, and save and invest a substantial portion of their income. In a time when our personal and national debt has come home to roost, this  can seem like utter genius. Sure, we all know it, but as a group, we seem to have been entirely unable to execute this feat. If you want to know how to plant a garden, ask the guy who has long maintained a beautiful garden himself, otherwise, ask his gardener- not the person with a scabby yard full of weeds- even if he has a degree in horticulture. Probably.    We live in a fantasy world, fueled by the unrealistic media image of the  lifestyles of ordinary people- who are waitresses and aspiring actors (eg \\"Friends\\"), yet share spacious New York apartments that a merchant banker could barely afford. Advertisements of credit card companies tell us that these and other acquired luxury goodies are what we deserve, and offer them to us in exchange for signing over our futures to indentured debt servitude.    I buy much of this advice, especially the part about not spending more than I earn, and hope to win the struggle to avoid debt and save and invest enough to retire without living on dogfood. It is an interesting  presentation, done via tons of data about what wealthy people actually do. Despite being dated statisically, this evidence makes the author's points convincingly; I'd bet that further data collection would be consistent with their first 2 efforts.    I do, however, see a fundamental flaw in the authors' value system. They  so admire their exemplary subjects for their courage and common sense  that they are utterly uncritical of their priorities. The accumulation of wealth to the extent of leaving an estate behind at death is the virtue, while all spending of earnings beyond that necessary for a modestly comfortable life (with the possible exception of certain charitable contributions) is presumed to be in aid of a pretentious and contemptible seeking of status and/or empty, transient amusements.    Phooey. The authors themselves admit that subsidized children of the wealthy are crippled by an inability to imagine a less luxurious lifestyle than that provided for them- so what's the point of having more than you need to retire fearlessly, if you want to, or if it becomes necessary? Money in a big pile for when you die- or as an abstract measure of your accomplishnent or worth-is useless and, dare I say it- greedy.    Money spent on education for its own sake, making or supporting art and the environment, travel, research, and other life enriching activities should not be viewed as status seeking, useless behaviour; it is money well spent. A life boiled down to economic survival is a desperate existence, and if we are lucky enough, and disciplined enough to beable to provide for own financial survival, in my world view, it is a waste and a sin to ignore all of opportunities for a life that is so much more.
B001BGTWXI|5.0|alright, everyone knows about slipknot. if ya dont, get out from under the rock you live under. that being said, i was really surprised at how the music sounded for the new album. i enjoyed the last one, and i also enjoyed IOWA. i wasnt a fan of the s/t album as most \\"maggots\\" are. i dont consider myself a maggot, im more of a casual listener. in the end, this album is an evolution of the last album. if you enjoyed the last one, then this one may also do the trick. there more thrash riffs on this one. and less acoustic songs. thank god for that, i liked circle on vol. 3 but vermillion pt 2 sucked imo. its heavy, catchy and pissed off. which is how i like my music.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I have always loved history because I realized pretty early that its not really about dates. Or at most, dates are a very small part of it. Its mainly about real flesh and blood people. I just recently watched this and absolutely loved it. I'm a huge fan of David McCullough's writings. This does his book proud. I did hear that 1776 is in the works. It'll be great and I can't wait.

0743270754|5.0|LEARNING from HISTORY... One of our limitations as a nation is that we don't seem to learn from history. Doris Keanrs Goodwin's book THE TEAM OF RIVALS was written before the current election but provides many lessons that are still relevant in today's political situation. First is the conditions that Lincoln had to deal with when he was elected and when assumed power. We think that times today are unique and troublesome, but can you imagine taking over power and having the country divide and a new nation formed..neither McCain nor Obama could imagine or are prepared for this type of division.<br />Second, it is interesting that LINCOLN choose his rivals to help him lead and was willing to deal with the consequences of this decision. McCain clearly has followed the Lincoln example and is likely to choose his rivals to help him serve...when he is elected.<br /><br />Overall we can learn from history and if we are smart avoid making the same mistakes... THANK YOU Ms. GOODWIN for the opportunity to do this because of your easy to read, highly researched and presented HISTORY LESSON.<br /><br />Bill Rothschild, author of THE SECRET TO GE's SUCCESS...which tries to do the same for American businesses.

0307237702|1.0|I wanted to see what inspired Oprah to say this was one of the most outstanding books she ever read. It was the biggest bunch of fluff I have ever read. It says we need to work together to accomplish goals and to end partisan bickering. Then it says unlike Republicans who cut student loans or spent millions to defeat Democarts. It is the life of a man who had not even been in the U.S. Senate yet. How does someone with no background win an election and the next month get a three book deal for 1.9 million and it go unnoticed? This was a novice who got paid to write whatever popped into his head for the sake of money.
B001B2U1AA|3.0|I did not intend to purchase two sets of the product. In review of the product for purchese it was not easy to determine that I was purchasing one dual set rather than two dual sets.    Amazon could have represented the product better by including the movie ratings. One movie was rated PG. great, no problem. However the other was rated R - which makes half of my purchase worthless, since I cannot view them with my family due to excessive use of the \\"F\\" word.
0060566108|5.0|Let me just say, I have read two books by Jim Collins and his research team and I have not been at all disappointed.  All chapters were explained without complex sentence writings and without all the extra stuff.  For example, \\"Resiliency (not perfection) is the signature of greatness, be it in a person, an organization, or a nation.\\" Jim Collins provided within each chapter insights on how to achieve at any position within a corporate company such as an employee, manager, senior executive, board member,and CEO. The book does mainly talk about people at the \\"top\\" but, the research information speaks for itself.  Comparing companies such as Procter and Gamble, Walt Disney, Merck, Johnson and Johnson, Wal-Mart to Colgate, Columbia Pictures, Pfizer, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and Ames, respectively.  The researchers group and Jim Collins provided and proved what facts can represent to a reader. If you are willing to take your time and read with a understanding that anyone can create a \\"visionary company\\" of tomorrow.  Highly Recommended to all future leaders with the pursue of how to develop what works and what doesn't.
0688014291|5.0|I know for a fact that when this book idea first came into its eventual publisher's hands, all the editors laughed at it! \\"Who would read a silly book like this with almost no words in it?\\" they scoffed. Yet for whatever reason they decided to publish it and the rest became amazing publishing history! In my own book, \\"The Expert's Edge,\\" I discuss how to develop leading-edge ideas as well as the importance of viewing failure as \\"desirable.\\" Without practicing both, you will never produce an unexpected success. Ken Blanchard was obviously doing both back when he conceived this groundbreaking book and the world (and his publisher) has never been the same.
B001D25MNE|5.0|It's hard to believe it's been over a decade since TIME Magazine heralded the Chemical Brothers (alongside Prodigy, Fluke, Orbital, and others) as stateside ambassadors of \\"electronica\\". False hopes cluttered up expectations, but even as many groups (often 2- and 3-member duos, if not lone bedroom musicians) faded along the way, the Chems kept pounding on new doors, bursting beyond their original badge of \\"big beat\\" to encapsulate a sound that could, in the end, only be their own (and often-imitated it was!).    It's convenient to have many of their big singles on here, altho I would've sequenced them differently -- \\"Block Rockin' Beats\\" is such a wake-up standout that I wonder why it was placed 3rd. Also, it isn't entirely clear whether this is the 1-CD version, since the track listing doesn't say -- yet the header claims \\"[LIMITED EDITION]\\". To the latter's point, the \\"Electronic Battle Weapons\\" are a wonderful showcase of party mayhem, the Chems continuing the 80s spirit of rough, raw beats (then it was breakdance, which has evolved into krumping and other styles...) rocking the neighborhood.    Also unique and notable about the Chemical Bros. is how they've been able to create albums that work as such, sometimes with tracks seguing flawlessly into each other, but how they've done strongly with singles too. To this day, that's extremely rare in electronic music -- many hit singles, few \\"artist albums\\" that gel as a whole.    While I feel their later explorations weren't as effective as earlier outings, admittedly, this is in part because I've become desensitzed to their once-novel way of taking disparate influences which you might not think work together, and whuppin' them into mighty, bold stews.    And then, there are the more delicate (but no less strong) excursions, like the harmonic rush of \\"Star Guitar\\" -- if you haven't seen the Michel Gondry-directed music video, its tempo-locked, tightly-synchronized visuals are a MUST. A MUST, I say!    \\"Out of Control\\"is another lesser-known (compared to the standout Beatles-infused dementia of \\"Setting Sun\\") beauty, used to great effect in Wipeout 3 and having an awesome guitar breakdown with syncopated breakbeats that get the mix moving again.    Overall, a wonderful retrospective, both healthy for your party and knowledge of technology-based music history. If you didn't discover the magic of the Chemical Brothers' time-travelling psychedelia \\"the first time around\\", there's no better time to start than now.
B0001XAPY2|3.0|Let me preface this review by saying that I love most all of Miyazaki's films, including Princess Mononoke, Howl's Moving Castle, My Neighbor Totoro, Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, Spirited Away, and The Cat Returns (though this one's not technically his).  For some reason, Porco Rosso just didn't do it for me.  It's difficult to point out objectively exactly why...maybe it was the ridiculous villians (they were funny though), or maybe it was the fact that I just couldn't really care about any of the characters, or maybe it was the somewhat dull and abruptly ending story.  As for the last thing, I'm used to Miyazaki's somewhat slow-paced story-telling method, but for some reason Porco Rosso just didn't capture my attention like his other movies.  I just didn't find the movie to be very charming like his others.  Normally, I feel the urge to rewatch his movies, but I don't think I'll be seeing this again.    So, do I recommend this movie?  Well, I suggest that all fans of Miyazaki's work see this at least once since it's his.  You may or may not like it; it seems alot of people on Amazon loved it (alot of 4 and 5 star reviews).    P.S. To all the Porco Rosso fanboys out there- yes, I know there's alot of metaphors concerning facism and humanity and all that in this movie.  So please don't tell me I'm just too stupid to enjoy this film.  I'm not dissing this movie out of spite or anything, I just couldn't seem to enjoy it, even though I really wanted to.
0790729350|5.0|This is the seminal rock film of all time.  I remember reading about the concert in \\"Rolling Stone\\", wondering about going, it sounds pretty good.  But I was still in high school on the west coast, and the surf was up that summer.  Then, when it hit the television news, the whole thing took up a life of its own...spontaneous combustion!  Then the three-record set came out, the movie came out, the poster came out, the magazine coverage, and the books.  With the passing of time, it's great the director's cut has been released, revealing more of what happened at the original Woodstock.  Drop some brown acid, and take a wild ride!
1400063515|5.0|Loved it. Great thinking, fantastic perspectives..like this gem referring to Umberto Eco's library \\"He is the owner of a large personal library (containing thirty thousand books), and separates visitors into two categories: those who react with \\"Wow! Signore professore dottore Eco, what a library you have! How many of these books have you read?\\" and the others -- a very small minority -- who get the point that a private library is not an ego-boosting appendage but a research tool. Read books are far less valuable than unread ones. The library should contain as much of what you do not know as your financial means, mortgage rates, and the currently tight real-estate market will allow you to put there. You will accumulate more knowledge and more books as you grow older, and the growing number of unread books on the shelves will look at you menacingly. Indeed, the more you know, the larger the rows of unread books.\\"..<br /><br />And that is just one example. See the wealth of other reviews here for more. If you even think you might be interested, don't hesitate!
B000PY52EU|5.0|An excellent, underrated movie betrayed by its atrocious theatrical poster, BLACK SNAKE MOAN works on just so many levels. Samuel L. Jackson is Lazarus, a farmer and natural blues guitarist living in rural Tennessee. Lazarus' wife has left him for his brother, and the bitter Lazarus veers like a skirling wind between self-pity, world-weariness, emotionally-charged violence, and religiously-fueled hopefulness.<br /><br />One morning, he finds Rae (Christina Ricci) lying beaten, bloody, and naked in the road near his house. Rae is the girl in town with the \\"reputation\\"; the least perjorative way to describe her behavior is that she uses her sexuality as both a weapon and a shield, closing herself off from a trauma-scarred childhood. Consequently, Rae manipulates men and is victimized by them. Her boyfriend Ronnie has just been deployed with the Tennessee National Guard, and in her lonely misery, her evening companion has attacked her and dumped her off.<br /><br />The lonely Lazarus takes Rae in, but realizing that she is delirious both from the beating and a raging fever, he chains her inside the house so she will not wander. Although Rae first tries to get away, she soon finds in Lazarus a kindred spirit, and the two become friends.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the image of Lazarus holding the panty-clad Rae by a length of chain is the image the promoters chose to market this film. This sexually-charged, racially stereotyped symbolism undoubtedly ruined this film's reception. And it's a shame, because BLACK SNAKE MOAN is a splendid film with great depth. Of course, the mostly-naked Ricci is sexy in a trailer park way (it's said that she put herself on a diet of junk to acheive the sallow, sunken-eyed look which typifies Rae), but the relationship between Lazarus and Rae develops into a profoundly moving father-daughter bond as the film progresses.<br /><br />It is not one-sided. Both Rae and Lazarus are able to collect the shards of their shattered self-esteem and rebuild their lives. In the Hollywood manner, all their complex problems are resolved by the end of the third reel, but nonetheless, BLACK SNAKE MOAN gives us a wonderful portrait of two deeply wounded people finding themselves in each other's eyes.<br /><br />There are many women like Rae; and there are many men like Lazarus. It is the reality of their shared experience that hits home with such force. We know these people. On some level, we are these people. A film can accomplish nothing finer nor more meaningful and lasting than that. The blues soundtrack is a perfect underscore to what we see onscreen.<br /><br />VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDEDwood manner, all their complex problems are resolved by the end of the third reel, but nonetheless, BLACK SNAKE MOAN gives us a wonderful portrait of two deeply wounded people finding themselves in each other's eyes.

B000BISBDY|5.0|This is a great snap shot of the legend that is Johnny Cash. It has some of his best hits, and some classic historical songs. The last track \\"Hurt\\", Trent Reznor may have the rights to it but Cash owns it!!! Peroid!!!

B00000K19E|5.0|As annoying as Keanu C. Reeves can be, this is his ultimate role!  The 44 year old Canadian actor whose middle name is Charles plays Neo who is most unlike his character in the 1989 comedy Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure.      Released in 1999 and written and directed by the Wachowski brothers this film takes the viewer into a dismal future for mankind in the year 2199.  As ubiquitous as today's World Wide Web is, this film goes in a direction that takes electronic machines and their artificial intelligence to the extreme in which they take captive 99% of humanity.      As dependent on machines, the internet and technology as we are - could all of that become greater than us and in turn rely on us for its survival?  You decide, this movie is in my personal top three movies I have ever seen!
B000000W5H|4.0|This is one of the better Stones' albums after there long winning streak, culminating with \\"Exile on Main Street\\" and \\"Sticky Fingers.\\" The Stones, then, included Charlie Watts, Bill Wyman, Mick Taylor, Keith Richards and Mick Jagger. Lots of their friends joined in this work, too, including Billy Preston, Nicky Hopkins, Blue Magic, and the 6th Stone, Ian Stewart (among others).<br /><br />The first three songs are all wonderfully played and sung. The CD starts off with a hidden gem, \\"If You Can't Rock Me.\\"  This is followed by a nice cover version of the Temptations' \\"Ain't Too Proud to Beg.\\" Then, the eponymous \\"It's Only Rock n' Roll.\\" One interesting sidebar: I just saw from the notes included with the CD that the inspiration for that song was none other than Ronnie Woods, later to play lead guitar with the Stones after Taylor's departure.<br /><br />There are really no duds on this CD.  Other songs that I had forgotten over the years sound pretty good to me! \\"Till the Next Goodbye,\\" \\"Time Waits for No One,\\" \\"Luxury,\\" \\"Dance Little Sister,\\" and \\"If You Really Want to Be My Friend.\\"  The raucous and rude \\"Short and Curlies.\\"  The final cut is a raggedy and provocative tune, \\"Fingerprint File.\\"<br /><br />Anyhow, listening to the whole work again after a long hiatus suggests to me that this was an awfully good work, better than I had remembered. So, for Rolling Stones' fans, a good addition to their catalog.
0739367676|5.0|Anyone who is familiar with the Twilight series by Stephenie Meyer is in for a rare treat.  A word of caution, this book will bring you to tears at some points.  It is the final book of the series from the viewpoint of Bella and it is filled with action, adventure, love, and drama.  If you're not familiar with the series you should start with the book \\"Twilight\\" and work your way up to \\"Breaking Dawn\\".  It will be a literary journey well worth taking.  Once you have finished the series you should check out Meyer's other novel, \\"The Host\\".  It is every bit as packed full of drama, love, adventure, and action as \\"Breaking Dawn\\".

B0000021RD|5.0|I can't say enough good things about this album. The late, great, multi-talented Terry Kath, and some beautiful songs and arrangements make this a true Chicago treat. I love the whole first side of the album, and side two's \\"Ballet for a Girl in Buchannan\\" is worth the price of the entire disc!!! Long live Terry Kath--one of the all-time greats!!!!! If I had to pick out one or two favorite songs on the entire album, it would definitely be either \\"Make Me Smile\\" or \\"Poem for the People.\\"
B001EZ2T7W|5.0|I hope they keep making these direct-to-DVD Stargate films. The TV show was outstanding and I loved all ten seasons. The previous \\"Ark of Truth\\" direct-to-DVD movie was terrific and this one maintains the high production quality, storyline and acting.     Somehow, they managed to get practically all of the actors portraying the various heros and villians over the years back together for the story. For example, there are lots of cameos by all the best \\"System Lords\\" we loved to hate in the TV show.    If you're a Stargate fan, you won't want to miss this.    My only regret is that I just bought the DVD last week for $15 at Best Buy when I could've rented it here for $3.99, but at least the DVD includes a few hours of bonus material about the production.    Two Kentucky thumbs up to the Stargate cast and crew!
031606792X|5.0|I loved this book. It went high beyond my expectations. In some series the first book is always the best. Not in this case, Breaking Dawn was funny, sincere, and exciting to the last word. There are unexpected twists that I could not have come up with in my wildest dreams which keep readers on the edge of the seat during the entire book. This was for me an immensely satisfying read.
B0000640SA|5.0|I see that some reviewers have given away a bit more of the story than I would have, but this does save me the trouble of recapping anything.<br /><br />I'll just say that it's every bit the \\"instant classic thriller\\" promised on the DVD cover, that it's both full of action and mentally stimulating, and that I will watch it again, which I've never said about a \\"thriller\\" before.  I'm also looking forward to watching the bonus DVD once I've let a little time pass, just to satisfy my curiosity.<br /><br />Oh yeah, and notice how the majority of us are giving this 5-star reviews.  There's a reason we do that.
B000LC4TJ0|1.0|If I had been in the audience at this performance I would have booed from the very beginning and throughout this horrible production. The singing was OK, the recits too slow and ponderous and WHAT was going on in the pit with all those pauses that added beats to pieces?  The Eros dancer was unnecessary; the Count wa a simpering idiot and I couldn't decide if he was sweating or had allergies or a nose bleed. Bartolo in a wheel chair? COME ON! It became about picking up papers and how he would get back in the chair! The \\"non piu andrai\\" was the worst travesty. I'm sorry the Salzburg audience had to be subjected to this at those prices. I will have a great deal of trouble watching the rest and  THANK GOD I didn't buy it!
B0018SWA56|5.0|something borrowed was one of the first 'chick lit' books i read and i loved it. of course they're all predictable but this book was a fun and light read!! however, i strongly recommend reading something borrowed BEFORE reading something blue.
B00005J79H|5.0|This is an outstanding CD!  Wished I'd orderded the DVD to have the visual of this amazing performance.
0792164903|5.0|It's pretty sad that it has taken me so many years to finally get my hands on a copy of the DVD.  When this first came out, I went with my mom to the theatre and was instantly captivated by the enchanting morbidity of this film.  Oh, I had the video for years, but it's just so hard to use video now.<br /><br />Anyway, I am in love with this movie and its odd inability to be placed in any one genre.  I would almost call this a fairy tale, except the only unreality is hellfire and withcraft.  But even with all the death and blood and murder there is something positively sweet and even cute about this storyline that is admittedly a far cry from Washington Irving's tale of a funny Halloween prank.<br /><br />In this tale, the Headless Horseman is no story and prank but a real ghost terrorizing the citizens of a little New England village.  Ichabod Crane, still hilariously done by Johnny Depp, is a neurotic cop from New York City sent to investigate the murders.  Unfortunately, he is a realist who has no patience for magic and ghosts.<br /><br />The story is a tight, fun, and thoroughtly satisfying one that is endearing in all its bloodshed with its likeable characters that seem to have jumped right out of a storybook, albeit one that spends the entire plot in overcast gloom.  Even the blood, which defies all knowledge of clotting and reality, is fun in its macabre way.<br /><br />This is honestly one of my sentimental favorites, a deranged fairy tale brought to life.
0312427999|1.0|I certaintly hope that nobody actually considers Klein an expert on economics.  This book contained many fanciful tales and creative history, but I challenge the author and her fans to point out one single true fact in the entire book.  Klein cannot make a decent argument without instantly resorting to the same tired tabloid approach of re-writing actual history and events to fit her argument.  This contains the same anti-capitalist themes and overtones you'll find in a 2nd year college essay.

B001DRF84W|5.0|Ang Lee is a superior director, and this is an introspective film on the nature of anger.    On the commentary Ang Lee mentions that he saw this movie as a \\"Dream of Anger\\"; an exploration on the nature of rage and what can cause a feeling that deep to become uncontrollable.     The Hulk is not your standard marvel superhero. In guest appearances he plays the 'Unstoppable Force'. In his own comic he runs from what he can't control. He doesn't put on a suit or fight crime. He is a creature driven by his base impulses. Impulses that take over his mind and body and drive him to do horrible horrible things, things that only later he discovers the consequences for.    Gee, sort of sounds like a metaphor for anger -- which is kind of the point of this film.     People complain about this movie because it's slow, introspective, and the hulk doesn't appear for over an hour of runtime. What they want is to put in a film, see a little bit of romance and some eye candy where things blow up. That is not what is in this film. What *is* in this film (and in my opinion is worth your time) is a study of what one man must do to come to terms with the monster that resides inside of him. This, like all films about hominid-morphs, uses an external monster to represent an internal struggle. This film, like much of Ang Lee's work, represents that struggle very well.    It's not a summer blockbuster. It doesn't have an explosive shiny battle at the end. What it does have is thought-provoking imagery and a complex statement about a complex issue. It is no wonder why your average American didn't like the film. It comes highly recommended for any fans of Ang Lee, and anyone who likes their movies filled with intelligence and metaphor.    All those proud of their ignorance make me angry, and in the words of the Hulk. . .
0671015206|5.0|The authors of this book give a more realistic approach on how to join the ranks of America's wealthy. Always live well below your means is one of the rules. There are others. The authors discover that most of the wealthy households were not located in upscale neighborhoods. These people also drove ordinary cars, work the right jobs and dont dine out as much. These people are in complete opposites to the households in posh neighborhoods that have little real wealth and are consumers with minimal savings and investments. This is a must read for the consumptive types.
0385340990|5.0|I LOVED THIS BOOK!  At first, I didn't think I would get into the letters and all the characters, but once I started reading it, I could hardly put the book down.  Wonderful book!!
B00004RF83|5.0|There is much to like about \\"Seven Days in May\\" as others have noted.  In this comment I focus on one long scene:  the confrontation between President Jordan Lyman and General James Mattoon Scott.<br /><br />It is a compelling dialogue about democracy.  The general is full of himself, and realized effortlessly as only Burt Lancaster could do, an under-rated actor by all but Luchino Visconti.  The beleaguered president, played with enormous conviction and depth by Frederich March, still has one thing the general does not have, an electoral mandate.<br /><br />While the film seems far fetched, a coup d'&eacute;tat in the United States, as others have noted, the underlying tension is real.  There are times when the elected government may well have lost the confidence of the electorate, but it clings on because the constitution permits or indeed requires it to do so.  The election occurred in the past, by definition, and events may have wrought great changes, or the government, in this case embodied in one man, the president, may have changed course for one reason or another.  That electoral mandate is then a thing of the past, or so it may seem.<br /><br />There are many examples, an Australian prime minster was removed from office in mid-term as recently as 1975, Israeli governments have stumbled as changing coalitions have produced policies from pure air, the threat of coup d'&eacute;tat against Charles DeGaulle over Algerian independence was very real.  More mundane examples likewise abound.<br /><br />An elected government confronts the reality of the responsibility of office and has to change its rhetoric form the carefree days of opposition to the hard edges of government.  Its supporters feel betrayed and the opposition beats the drum for a change of government.  In such a situation why wait for constitutional niceties?  Throw the rascals out, now!  Indeed, why not?  Because in the longer run this kind of mob rule and demagoguery destroys order, stability, and continuity.  The voice of the mob is not the voice of the people.  Why not?  Read on to find out why not.<br /><br />What is the worth of that dated mandate?  President Lyman then makes an argument that the process that produced the mandate stands above all else, and it guarantees the continued worth of the mandate, dated or not.  Process?  The democratic election that yield President Lyman, that process.<br /><br />General Scott claims to represent the will of the people, and just maybe he does in the film.  That is the tension.  He may be as much right as wrong.  He may be right about the will of the people.  But he certainly wrong about the voice of the people.<br /><br />The voice of the people is not heard on talk-back radio, in studio audiences of public affairs television, newspaper letter pages, bars, and lobbies.  The voice of the people is heard in the ballot box.  That is Lyman's argument.<br /><br />If he has exceeded his mandate, if the will of the people has truly changed as Scott believes, then the voice of the people will be heard at the next scheduled election.  To make that happen all Scott needs to do is declare his candidacy and run for election.  He can do that at any time.<br /><br />Scott argues that time does not permit the luxury of democracy.  The threat is real, material, and immediate.  He might be right.  Yes, also, this is ever the usurpers argument.  It convinced Brutus to strike at Caesar.  It led many well meaning people to support Adolf Hitler.  Even if right, Scott is also wrong in a much more important way than he is right.<br /><br />That is the great constraint of democracy.  It fixes the occasions of election in one way or another in any political system.  The rhythm of elections may not match the rhythm of events.  But to breach democracy in accord with the rhythm of events may be a greater destruction that any that events can wreak.  That is Lyman's reply.<br /><br />After all, if the Soviets see a military seizure of power inthe United States that alone will be sufficient to cause them to attack right now.  The very thing to be avoided will be provoked by the effort to prevent it.  But that kind of second guessing is just that, speculative second guessing.<br /><br />The note that Lyman strikes repeatedly is that democracy is the open and endless opportunity for anyone to take to the soapbox and rally the voice of the people, and that is the one thing General Scott has conspicuously failed to do. He speaks only to those who already agree with.  One of the hallmarks of democracy is that it requires those who seek office to meet those who do not yet agree with them.  Though there is a lot of nonesense in electoral campaigns that essential requirement remains.  To win any candidate has to get votes from that vast bulk of voters who are ideologues.<br /><br />Rather than face the auditorium with it noisily but vigorous disorder, his meetings have been in closed offices, underground car parks, back rooms, and the like, all this to save democracy from ... itself..

B001F6ZIXC|5.0|The timing of Sons is obviously gauged to take advantage of the latest mid-life crisis which requires men my age to buy Harleys and spend their weekends pretending to be outlaw bikers.<br /><br />Sons of Anarchy shows real potential as a worthy successor to [[ASIN:B001C3O6R2 The Sopranos - The Complete Series]] episodic brand of voyeurism.  Sons offers to take us into the lives of those who live outside the social contracts (or constraints) most of us take for granted.  However, unlike The Sopranos, the Sons are not a criminal version of royalty (a status bestowed by endless viewings of [[ASIN:B00003CXAA The Godfather DVD Collection ]].)  Instead they are, (as described by another reviewer) \\"relatable.\\" These are, for the most part, average joes, who've chosen to live outside the requirement to be a part of the herd or to \\"go along to get along.\\"<br /><br />Whether we actually practice it or not, the American ideal (or myth) is that of the rugged individualists, who band together to oppose the bureaucracy that wants to force these square pegs into round holes. Think of Rooster Cogburn in [[ASIN:B000O179FY True Grit]].<br /><br />And that's the legend that Sons of Anarchy is based on.  The basic concept is that the SAMCRO's (Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club - Redwood Originals) are  latter-day Knights Errant.  Following in the footsteps of Jesse James and John Dillinger (if you believe that they were only stealing from the villainous landlord or grasping banker and not the hard-working farmer) these outlaw bikers exist to protect their community from the evils of dope-dealing white supremacists and the rival Mayan motorcycle club.  And that's where they lost me, at least a little bit.<br /><br />I grew up in Fontana, California, with a family full of 1 %'ers (the one-percenter nom de plume arose after the 1947 Hollister riots, when the America Motorcycle Association famously proclaimed that \\"99% of motorcycle riders were decent citizens\\" and \\"1%\\" were outlaws.) The brotherhood is undeniable - every member was loyal to the patch and would do anything and everything he could to help another brother.<br /><br />But the loyalty was entirely to the club - if you weren't patched you were just strangers, worthy of no more consideration than the bug that slammed into your teeth as you roared your Harley down Route 66.  The idea of them banding together to protect their city, or even their block, just left me a little incredulous.  However, I'm nit-picking - this is fiction and I need to be more forgiving.<br /><br />So now that I've aired my petty grievances, let me tell you what I loved.<br /><br />This is probably the finest cast on the small screen I've seen in a long, long time.  Even though the story is theoretically about Jackson \\"Jax\\" Teller (played by Charlie Hunnam), it was Rob Perlman (of [[ASIN:B00008EY65 Hellboy]] fame) and Katey Sagal (finally escaping from [[ASIN:B00008AOX6 Married with Children]]) that were the most realistic characters and really made the show.  While Jax is an interesting character and was obviously designed drive the main themes of the show, I couldn't help but wonder how this brooding prince (think [[ASIN:B00019072G Hamlet]]) was able to rise to the level of vice-prez without committing some horrific act of violence, which the show promises to have a lot of.<br /><br />Sons was created by Kurt Sutter, a writer and executive producer on [[ASIN:B00006RCNW The Shield]] so you know he's going to keep this series gritty and as realistic as possible.<br /><br />Sons promises a lot and I'm looking forward to the next episode.

1401207529|5.0|Batman: Year One was the first Batman graphic novel I read. It remains my favorite and has sparked me to read other Batman graphic novels.     For anyone new to graphic novels or comics, Batman: Year One is a great place to start. It is fairly brief and quick to read. Frank Miller's writing is engrossing and powerful, yet remains simple and accessible. David Mazzucchelli's artwork isn't overly detailed but possesses substance and the dull colors give the drawings an old-fashioned look. The use of colors, light, and shadows is outstanding and really captures the mood of each frame.     For anyone interested in Batman, Batman: Year One is a must have. Not only is it an origin story of Batman, but it's also Jim Gordon's (later Lt. Gordon) first year in Gotham City. The story focuses equally on Batman and Gordon, soon to become Gotham City's top crime fighters. As the story develops, their long-standing relationship begins to take shape, a relationship that becomes crucial to Batman and Gotham.     Batman and comic fans alike will not be disappointed with Batman: Year One. Even if you're new to the graphic novel medium, Year One is a great first. It is a great example of how good this often overlooked art form can be.
B000WCDI64|3.0|Okay. The concert's not bad, if you don't mind unintelligible English, even when Ms. Winehouse is talking, not singing. If ever a video cried out for subtitles, its this one. The documentary has them, but the concert does not. And, yes, as \\"Back to Black\\" proved, Winehouse is a British blue-eyed soul talent in the mold of - if not necessarily the level of - a Dusty Springfield. She has talent and promise. But, she is pathetically out of control in the concert, drunk and drunker throughout the evening, and possibly, stoned as well. I don't want to seem holier-than-thou, but when I see teens singing \\"No, No, No\\" to rehab to a person clearly in need of just that - when I see that it was actually her enabling cab driver Dad who inspired that refrain, when I see the music industry types, featured in the doc, who apparently only care about wnat the singer can do for the label.... well, it's off-putting to say the least.  So, talent aside, it's just too painful to watch someone self-destruct before one's eyes. If this concert existed in a vacuum, I'd give it 5 stars. But it doesn't. So, a somewhat generous 3 stars for a disquieting disc that will remain in my seldom played collection. I hope Amy Winehouse comes out of this phase, and fulfills her talent in the future.

B0013D8LCW|5.0|I fell in love with this movie the first time I saw it. It was great to see a movie which wasn't steeped in gay culture,  that was about normal people going through hardships and while doing so discovering who they where and where they wanted to go in life.  The story follows Zach, a young man who instead of going to college, stayed behind to watch over his sister and her son.  His sister is a poor mother, leaving Zach to fill the parental role for his young nephew all the while trying to express himself through his art and surfing.  When his best friend's older brother Shaun  comes back into town for a month,  Zach begins to discover himself and driven by Shaun, starts to go after a better life than the one he had chosen.

B00008V5VN|5.0|Quite simply, this album is for me the definitive example of stoner rock.  Sleep really managed to transcend all the limitations of the genre with this album by magnifying and stretching stoner rock/metal's elements to an extreme rarely ever attempted, let alone achieved with this much success.<br /><br />Be warned: this album is not for the casual metal fan.  It is repetitive, droning and it unfolds at a glacial pace.  The vocals are sung in a hoarse monotone and the lyrics can be ridiculously over the top: \\"Drop out of life with bong in hand / follow pot smoke toward the riff filled land\\".<br /><br />But somehow, Sleep managed to take these elements and turn them into a bona fide masterpiece.  The length of the song actually works in its favor -- there is simply no other way that these fuzzed out, C-tuned riffs, played at unbelievably slow, heavy tempos, could otherwise be developed the way they deserve to be.  The band plays together with supernatural chemistry, grasping the sprawling changes with precision.  There are also excellent uses of dynamics utilizing stops and starts and changes in volume, and a few cosmic solos from Matt Pike, too.<br /><br />And about those silly lyrics: I suppose there is an element of humor to them, but the way they are delivered by Cisneros and the roiling power of the band backing him up manages to transcend any campiness.  By the end of the record you aren't laughing at the words and the story they tell, but getting ready to rid yourself of all worldly posessions to join the procession of \\"weedians\\" on their long journey to Nazareth.  It's a neat trick, to be able to use that sort of comic-book imagery to preach a quite sincere religion of marijuana use.  Only Sleep has really been able to pull it off this well in the metal world.<br /><br />Yes, like the title of the record and the lyrics certainly imply, this is a great album for doing a few bong hits and zoning out on the deep spaces and mountanous riffs.  Sleep weren't just unshy about promoting pot smoking, cannabis worship was very nearly the band's entire reason for existing in the first place.  It's a record by and for pot heads, obviously.<br /><br />But you don't need to be high to enjoy this.  The musicianship alone makes it worth hearing, and the gloriously fuzzed-out, detuned guitars are every metalhead's wet dream.  I have listened dozens  times to this record.  While it's too demanding a listen to be the sort of CD you would would want on heavy rotation, I find myself pulling it out every few months and giving it another spin when I want to truly get lost in titanic riffs for an hour or so.<br /><br />An essential album for any fan of heavy music, and one of the best metal albums ever.

B000050LY8|5.0|Ok...those of you Toto fans who are looking for that Toto signature sound, you'll probably be disappointed. Only 1 or 2 tracks on this CD fit the mold. For those of you Toto fans who also like a little Rock with your Roll, sit back hit play and enjoy, this album really delivers! This album is so NOT Toto, that you won't even recognize them. I was sitting in a club back in 1993 and the DJ was playing this CD. I was sitting there listening to it really rocking out! Every song that came on was good. I was so impressed that I asked the DJ who we were listening to. He said \\"Toto\\" and I about fell over. Toto doesn't typically write driving rock songs, although I've always liked their music. I went out the next day and bought the CD. I personally enjoy it when an artist stretches in different directions. In this case, Toto proves once again that they are phenominal musicians regardless of the music they play. The great thing about this CD is the \\"stretching\\" that Toto does seems effortless. This is one of my favorite rock CD's to date!
B000669GAI|5.0|Been listening to Pearl Jam for a while but had never bought any of their music and am pleasently suprised in that I thought I would like the older (relativly) stuff but I actually like the newer stuff a bit (not much) more.     Overall a very good compilation.

B0007TKNL0|1.0|The product came late, and it was defective.  Unable to play it on my DVD, I tried it on the computer, where it did fine.  If the problem is my DVD player, it would stand to reason that other DVDs would not play in it.  This was not the case.  However, I am willing to give the seller the benefit of the doubt on this--and I am beginning to actually prefer VHS to DVD--VHS is more likely to be error-free, and DVD--even brand-new--is getting to be a roll of the dice.  What bugged me most, though, was the non-response from the seller when I asked for suggestions.  I did not ask for my money back, only for suggestions, but no response whatsoever.  Again, I'll give the benefit of the doubt, and assume the seller didn't receive my email. But, whatever--you may be sure I will order no products from SpookyKid in future.  Thanks for the opportunity to express my opinion.  Normally, my Amazon sellers are A-plus.

B000VWE5OY|5.0|Torchwood is one of the biggest surprises in Sci-Fi to come along in a long while. If you like shows like Firefly or Dr. Who, then you'll get a big kick out of Torchwood.     Torchwood reminds me alot of the comic, \\"Batman and the Outsiders\\" - about a team of flawed super-heroes who spend more time fighting their own personal demons than super-villians. The protagonists in Torchwood don't have any super powers (except for Capt. Jack Harkness who can't die) but they all have alot of emotional baggage and relationship issues. Throw in some Doctor Who atmosphere and the result is a real winner.    Torchwood is funny, deep, heartfelt and sexually provocative; sometimes all at the same time. A truly remarkable achievement. The best part: there will never be a lame American TV version of the show, due to the sexual exploits of the characters in the show.     Getting this DVD is a no-brainer..
B000066744|2.0|This is an interesting, entertaining movie in many respects, and certainly the acting is excellent.  What stands out to me, however, is that this is a kind of \\"great white hope\\" story.  The character \\"1900\\" (Tim Roth) is sui generis--a unique oceanic human that is born, lives, and dies on an ocean liner without ever setting foot on land.  Of course, he is the offspring of an unknown European immigrant mother, who abandoned him; notwithstanding his de facto adoptive black father (Bill Nunn), \\"1900\\" he still represents Eurocentric values and attitudes.      Like Sylvester Stallone's \\"Rocky,\\" Giuseppe Tornatore's \\"1900\\" is a fictional character whose greatness is ultimately measured by his ability to beat the black champion.  In Rocky's case, of course, the opponent-champion, Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers)was also a fictional character.  But it doesn't take a doctorate to see that Creed's character represented the reality of heavyweight championship fighting being dominated by black fighters.  \\"Rocky II\\" (the come-back episode where Rocky beats Creed) was necessarily birthed out of the white psyche's need to justify themselves as the necessary center of western society.      Tornatore's story of the oceanic keyboard player, which is supposed to be based upon another Italian theatrical production, is pretty much the same kind of story when viewed from the lens of \\"race\\" and racism.  Tornatore's \\"1900\\" is also the white upstart facing a black champion, except the contest is musical, though hardly less combative.  Of course, in contrast to Apollo Creed, Tornatore's \\"great white hope\\" faces off against a real historical figure, and a giant in the annals of African American music, Ferdinand \\"Jelly Roll\\" Morton (1890-1941).  In one of the most dramatic moments of the movie, Roth's \\"1900\\" hesitantly faces off with an arrogant but brilliant Morton (Clarence Williams III) [Roth and Williams were also co-stars in \\"Bumpy Johnson\\"].  At first \\"1900\\" only dabbles at the keys, showingrespect to the great black master (the narrator is sure to tell us that Morton's greatness lies in the fact that he invented a music that could be played in whorehouses with much success).  Then \\"1900\\" reproduces Morton's brilliant playing like a virtual recording, further infuriating his black opponent.  In the last round of their musical competition, \\"1900\\" unleashes his master-race abilities at the piano, and humiliates Morton by almost literally burning up the keys.  As if that weren't enough, Tornotare has \\"1900\\" smarting off as the defeated Morton quietly slips off the boat at port.  \\"F--k Jazz,\\" says \\"1900.\\"    \\"The Legend of 1900\\" is ultimately a tale of white-racial oneupmanship more than it is a story about music and musicians, or about a man who is afraid to live on land because it seems endless and mind-boggling to him.  Nor is it just a fantasy about a white super-musician who can exceed and excel the great classical music tradition of the U.S.A., Jazz.  At its fullest, it is a story that illustrates the white man's belief that no matter how brilliant and powerful the contributions of his black fellow man, white people's music--like everything else in the construct of western culture--affirms white-centeredness, even white supremacy.      It is no surprise that such a figure as the stubborn \\"1900\\" must be blown up at the end of the story, dying with the only ocean home he knew.  This is where the parallel between \\"1900\\" and \\"Rocky\\" ends.  The \\"Italian Stallion\\" series continued, probably because the majority psyche of the U.S.A. is much more desperately in need of a \\"great white hope,\\" and much more likely to market them to the point of absurdity.  On the other hand, Tornatore understands that to perfect his  white \\"legend,\\" he must blow him up at the end--kill him off quickly so that the character \\"1900\\" can transcend (escape) Tornatore's disingenous and disrespectful use of the real genius of \\"Jelly Roll\\" Morton.  \\"1900\\" is not only a \\"legend,\\" he isa fake legend, and if anyone deserves to be dismissed with the \\"f-word,\\" it's him.  Unlike Morton, he never existed.  What really exists, however, is a pervasive mentality among too many whites (but not all of them!)which requires them to feel themselves superior and to dismiss dark humanity and its great contributions as secondary to their own.
B000XA5K48|5.0|This was an exciting movie from start to finish. It really was a shoot them up
B0018AK9RA|5.0|Like others who have reviewed the new Judas Priest CD, I have been a long time fan, even during the time when \\"Turbo\\" was relesed. Liked 'em then, still like 'em now.  I admit that \\"Nostradamus\\" takes a little getting used to, especially for those of us who were introduced to Priest during British Steel-Defenders of the Faith time frame.  What I really like about this CD is, well to me, is it's creativity.  Kind of goes back to the Sad Wings of Destiny style.  Yes it is different, but then so are just about every other Judas Priest CD's.  Each has their own niche, and this one is no different.   I enjoyed the storyline, the music, and of course, the vocals.  Also, the fact that this is something that Priest wanted to do is felt throughout the CD.  I applaud the effort and the final product that is \\"Nostradamus.\\"  Thanks to Judas Priest for the enjoyable journey.
0446402389|5.0|One of the best books I've read in a long time.  Could not put it down or stop reading (so good I had to leave it in the car overnight to keep myself from staying up all night).<br />The twists and turns caught me like a string around my ankle and the author kept pulling me in.<br />I understand the film rights have been sold to Ridley Scott.  Excellent book - 5 stars.
B000XNZ7LG|5.0|I did have to return the HD/DVD for a different DVD, my mistake dont have HD. However, recieved a new DVD of the movie and of course it's a fabulous film, they should even show this movie in history classes.    Still havent gotten my refund yet, and its been about a month.
B0000009SF|4.0|Perhaps it was only nostalgia that made me purchase this CD, but I've never forgotten its jazzy melodies. I especially enjoy \\"Blessed Relief\\" which takes me back to those musically experimental, latter days of high school (1972-74). I can count this album as one of a handful that formed the basis of my appreciation of jazz.
B000XA5K48|2.0|If this is supposed to be a homage to the Hong Kong action genre then John Woo should feel a little slighted.  This flick is of little discernible style and no substance.  The over-the-top action is boring, the plot is convoluted, and the constant stabs at humor drop like a thud.  The usually dependable Clive Owen cannot even save this turkey.  He has to work overtime to stave off embarrassment.  But, then, Clive can pick and choose his own projects so you can't imagine what drew him to this one.  Paul Giamatti lays an egg as the film's heavy.  Be careful, Paul, or people will forget that you made good flicks like \\"American Splendor\\" and \\"Sideways\\".  Monica Bellucci as the requisite femme fatale is the only performer here to make a visceral impact.  The hilarious love-making scene between her and Owen is about the only time this film engaged me.  Otherwise, this flick is a complete waste of brain cells and not in the good way that some popcorn flicks are.
031606792X|5.0|As a reader in my thirties, I have to say that I enjoyed and identified the most with this book in the series. Having read many of the negative reviews, I must say that I respectfully disagree with many of those assessments.     I found many readers disturbed by the fact that Bella not only married Edward at the age of eighteen, but also became pregnant. While I agree that eighteen is rather young to marry and have a child, I feel that Bella has grown and matured substantially throughout the series. Eighteen-year-olds are old enough to go off to war in our country, after all. Also, in light of the fact that Bella has made the decision to become a vampire, the commitment of marriage only makes sense to show Edward how very much she is determined to live his lifestyle and stand by him for eternity (quite literally).     Bella does become pregnant, and she and Edward both view this as a mistake at first. Neither of them realized that this was a possibility, and although it is frightening for them both, they eventually come to accept and sacrifice to bring a new life into the world. They are not, contrary to many reviews, getting exactly what they want. They both must make tremendous sacrifices in their own ways for this life they did not plan on, as many young parents do not plan on pregnancy but must come to terms with it. Bella must sacrifice herself physically, and they are both emotionally torn in that Edward must sacrifice Bella for a child he initially resents and Bella discovers that she desperately wants this child who is the result of the love that she and Edward share even though she knows that the child may kill her. They both mature immeasurably in their individual realizations that their child means more than their own lives. I don't think this is a negative influence for young readers. Through the myriad emotions that Bella and Edward experience, hopefully a young person would come away with an understanding of the seriousness and unpredictability of pregnancy and child birth. Stephenie Meyer does not glorify teen pregnancy; she shows the scary, gritty side as well as the wonderful emotions one may experience while pregnant.     One review mentioned that a teen would most likely be scared to death the first time she felt her baby kick. Although I was twenty-three when my first child was born, that first quickening is the thing that I will always treasure the most from my pregnancy. It was the most wonderful feeling in the world to actually feel and confirm the life inside of me.     Yet another review discussed Bella's immaturity. Frankly, I don't see this aspect of her character presenting itself very often, and when it does I feel that it only reiterates her humanity. This is a character who has been forced to be the parent in her own relationship with her mother and father. I think that Bella's most redeeming quality is how much she tries to make everyone in her life happy. I don't believe that she lives her life for the men in her life; she lives her life to foster relationships that are the basis of her hapiness. Some individuals have an immense self-awareness and independence in the giving of their lives to those around them. This does not necessarily point to a weakness of character or a lack of relying on oneself, but a gift to love with one's whole heart and mind while making oneself happy in the process.     Regarding the subject of Jacob, I feel that he matured the most in this book. He finally comes to the realization that Bella has chosen Edward. His internal struggle with this, as well as his acceptance of Edward, shows tremendous growth on his part. This was the first time that I actually liked Jacob as a person. In past books I felt that although a loyal friend, he was also manipulative and somewhat selfish in his relationship with Bella. He grows up enough to appreciate the love that Bella and Edward share rather than resent it. As for the imprinting, I'm still not sure how I feel about that. I don't think of it as perverted in that Ms. Meyer did a good job explaining that sexuality was not a factor, rather it is a matter of two kindred souls entwining forever. We are shown that Quil and Jacob do not look at their young mates as sexual beings, but as children that they love in a brotherly or parental sense until their ages are appropriate for the change. Jacob and Nessie in particular don't seem as strange as Quil and Claire given Nessie's rapid aging process. Neither do I think it strange that Jacob imprinted specifically on Bella's daughter. After all, she is a part of Bella, and possesses many of the characteristics that Jacob loves in Bella.      I do not believe that the story is wrapped up with a pretty bow on the top, with each character getting exactly what they want. To attain their happiness they must go through hell and back. Perhaps Bella and Edward seem to have the perfect life even with the mistakes they have made. However, they still must be prepared for an uncertain future; for a child that is not perfect even for all of the perfection she may exude. They also still face the threat of the Volturi, as well as humans, who ironically, possess less humanity than they themselves in many ways.   I also believe that there are many messages to be learned. Sacrifice is an undeniable part of love. We are at our most powerful with those that we love surrounding and supporting us. Struggle and sacrifice produces a strength and awareness of self that cannot be conquered. Family and friends are our greatest blessings. Giving of oneself to others does not detract from one's own independence, but fosters self respect. Humanity is the most important quality of all; even to those who are not human.    Lastly, this series is fantasy. Please remember that as you read. I truly believe and hope that young readers of this saga are intelligent enough to know the difference between fantasy and reality. I feel that we must give young people that are taking the time to read literature enough credit to form their own opinions without being influenced by the actions and decisions of a fictional character. The flaws that we see in characters are very often the best teachers.
B000N6TYLW|5.0|I thought this season was well written and I enjoyed every episode.  I missed Jared Padalecki from this season and the 6th but had to buy both seasons to see how the series ended.  I would definitely recommend buying all seven seasons.

0316143472|3.0|When You Are Engulfed in Flames is filled with more of David Sedaris's essays on pretty much anything that crosses his mind.  From his neighbor Helen to the boil on his lower back to wanting to see the dingo at the zoo.  Sedaris dwells on his inadequacies to the point of sleep (the reader's).  There are some humorous moments, but  Sedaris focuses on the negative too much and the comic relief  too little.
B0000508U6|1.0|For someone who says he's going to be bigger then U2 this album is by far has one of the worst songs ever written. That belongs to the song Yellow. Not only is it a pointless song it's one of the worst songs in history. One reason it was because it was so overplayed.<br />The other reason is because Chris Martin sounds like a prepubescent little girl whining at mom for not buying her those thong panties at Victoria Secrets. Not only that he fails miserably at his attempt to be better then U2. In fact most of his other albums sound the same with that whininess. The only good song that Coldplay has come out with is Clocks. Every other song is horrible. The only reason why he even is able to sell a cd is because some women think he's hot. They don't listen to him on his musical ability.<br /><br />Chris Martin is more of the Jonas Brothrs. At least the Jonas Brothers have a chance to have their voice change when they hit puberty, Chris Martin hit puberty and still sounds like a prepubescent little boy. I'm sorry what is the world coming too with such worthless songs as Yellow!
0780626966|5.0|Well worth the $$$ a great DVD collection,and also the bonus of the TV series all for half the price you would pay to buy them separately. Also a really cool package
0790744295|5.0|\\"Creepshow\\" unites George Romero, Stephen King and the make up skills of Tom Savini to deliver five creepy yet intriguing tales.   It is delivered in true comic book fashion with embellished lighting, unique camera angles and animated transitions from one tale to the next.  After all, it was based on the E.C. horror comics.    It all begins with \\"Father's Day\\" in which a murdered father comes back from the grave to collect his long awaited Father's Day cake.  It has its scares and the humor isn't as tacky as the summary would suggest.  It can actually make you laugh.    Stephen King is the star in the next tale \\"The Lonesome Death of Jordy Verrill.\\"  A meteors goop makes everything grow including Jordy himself.  King's performance as a slow minded hillbilly was decent at best.  In my opinion he should stick to writing.  This tale is definitely not the best of the bunch.    The tales continue with \\"Something to Tide You Over\\" which stars Leslie Nielson as a merciless husband seeking revenge on his wife and her lover (Ted Danson) by burying them up to their necks in sand and then leaving it up to the high tide to finish the job.  You know what they say about revenge...hint, hint.  It was definitely a change of pace to see Nielson play the antagonist in this story.  I'm still used to seeing him as Frank Drebin, but he played the \\"bad\\" guy really well.    The best was saved for second to last in \\"The Crate.\\"  Henry (Hal Holbrook) is a college professor who is submissive to his extremely annoying wife.  One day on campus a mysterious crate is found containing a ferocious creature, so Henry decides to make his wife the creature's next meal.  This tale is the goriest of all five and contains some really gruesome scenes including one where half a face is bitten off...Sweet.    Last but not least is \\"They're Creeping Up On You.\\"  A millionaire misophobic (afraid of germs and contamination) has his apartment invaded with thousands of roaches.  Eventually it's not just his apartment that becomes overrun if you catch my drift.  Roaches got to go somewhere.  Definitely disturbing and gross...not for those with a weak stomach.    Five eerie tales on one disc with George Romero directing and Stephen King writing make \\"Creepshow\\" worth buying.  Add this to your horror collection.
0307383415|5.0|Barack Obama is an incredible story teller. Reading \\"Dreams from My Father\\" was a most enlightening experience. By the time we got to Africa I felt like Obama was a dear friend sharing his life with me. Meeting family for the first time in Africa felt like me going home to meet my ancestors. The reading was delicious and I didn't want it to end. I urge my family and friends to meet the man who is making history and spend some quality time with him. It feels honest and it's so obvious that it was written before there were any presidential aspirations. A documented story of a man before any publicity spin.
B00006879E|5.0|This cd is great for everybody. My mom adores Maroon5 because they are talented and they have a fresh sound. Their songs are very touching. My favorite track is \\"she will be loved\\". Trust me, you cant go wrong with this cd!
031606792X|1.0|There will be SPOILERS here.  Like many of the reviews.  Those of us disappointed (those of us disgusted . . . more overall disappointed) with the series, had to use SPOILERS in our reviews, so if you haven't read the book, and feel the need to - please be advised there will be spoilers.    I know this book wasn't written for me.  Neither was Harry Potter, but that was an excellent series. Anyway, comparisons are not fair.  And they are insulting to J.K. Rowling who actually threw in a strong female character.      I read \\"Twilight\\" because I am a fan of vampire stories - not because I think they are sexy or mysterious, because there is something fascinating about the sad embodiment of evil (sustaining your life off the lives of others) trying to justify its existence, trying to reconcile it's place in God's world, etc.      A friend picked up the book and based it on to me.  Excellent read.  Although it was 20 years ago for me, most women remember the blindness with which we love the first time.  The first time.  Then came \\"New Moon.\\"  I read it in a day.  I couldn't pull myself a way, I risked injury reading on the treadmill.  So powerful, so true, the way a 17-year-old mourns a broken heart, the pain from the loss of love and from just not understanding what the heck is going on, and how to deal with how you feel.    Then, it all falls apart.  Again, I know it is not written for me.  And, Ms. Meyer doesn't have a responsibility to create a respectable role model for young women today, the 46% of which will apparently be confronted with teen pregnancy by the age of 20 nowadays.  She only had to write a story she is comfortable with and that someone will publish.  By \\"Eclipse,\\" I got bored.  Anyway out of high school got bored.  Again, I know I am not the audience for this book.  Bella, so obsessed to the point of desperate with Edward, who has broken her heart, is pathetic.  That after her devastating loss of him when he ditches her, after growing close to and trusting Jacob, she still throws herself 110% forgively at him, it's pathetic.  It's sad that this character didn't learn to shield a piece of her heart for self preservation.  Love him, save him, and desire imortality, but learn something from his desertion.  Have some self-respect.  But, she doesn't have to.  She's not my character.  I am not writing her.  It's up to Ms. Meyer.  The tragedy is by now the writing has become trite.  It's simple.  How many times must she write about Edward's beauty?  It's really become something unfathomable.  Unrealistic.  Sickening.  Trite because only a fool 30 pages into \\"New Moon\\" doesn't realize Jacob is a werewolf.  Trite because my \\"Breaking Dawn\\" only a 12-year-old sneaking the book from her parents (or, at least, she should be) cannot figure out Jacob is going to imprint on Bella's daughter.      But, along comes \\"Breaking Dawn\\" and the completist in my needs to know if she chooses Edward (I have no doubt this pathetic girl will choose the one who has already shown her he will leave if he thinks it will make him feel better) or Jacob, who will love her and stand by her.  So, three or four weeks later I still try to finish this book.  On the one hand, everything is predictable.  As I said, Jacob, to solve the love triangle, will imprint on Edward and Bella's daughter.  Sure, okay.  But Bella is pissed about it?  How?  Why?  That's so untrue to the character who selfishly needed him by her side despite her fawning, devotion, admiration, sycophantism to Edward.  But he's not good enough for your daughter?  You know he would always stand by her, always protect her, but Bella doesn't accept this?  It's not realistic to the character.    On top of the pregnancy, which is its own complication - Edward doesn't breathe, doesn't have a heartbeat, but he has live sperm?  WTF?  Anyway . . .    If there are teenagers who still enjoy this series, that's great.  I hope a mother or aunt or big sister or someone is a role model in there life so they understand, especially in 2008, especially now, that a woman's worth does not have to be defined by a man, doe snot have to be determined by a man, and a woman's destiny or future does not have to follow that of the man she loves.  Love is only love, and though it is wonderful enough, it's no good if you stop bringing anything to the table - if all you have to offer is devotion.      I am sad by the completion of this story because the first one was so enjoyable, because they were written by a woman, and because the writing turned to such dreg repeating over and over how unworthy Bella was to Edward, how plain she was to all the bloodsuckers, etc.  So, I write this review in case you're a reader like me - in your 30s, reading the books because they are 600-pages of a quick read.  To advise you this is really going to turn into teen-lit by the 4th book.  I hope if you have bought it, you enjoy it.  I hope Ms. Meyer's tries again and again.  I won't give her writing another try, but if she gets people to read, that's great.  I just hope her protagonists in the future are women worth admiring, worth following, going forward.
160459201X|5.0|I have always been curious about the subconscious mind and this book explained it so clearly.  It just makes such perfect sense and I love the simplicity of his writing.  I recommend this book to anyone even the slightest bit curious about how your mind works.  Awesome read!
B000T9OP7G|5.0|I remember from before any episodes were aired, this series was getting a lot of negative buzz for whatever reason.  Most people who would consider watching this have already seen the terminator movies, as did any sci-fi or action fan. This series is similar in tone to the cult-favorite second movie although it is a better drama overall.    There are a couple of things that make it the series to watch.    Acting. Relative unknowns have been cast in main roles. I'd say the girl playing Sarah Connor is OK, the girl playing Cameron (the terminator) is good... and that's the worse end of the stick. Guys take the cake on this one. Young J.Connor, Agent Alison, and Derek Reese, Cromartie are played amazingly.    I like the music in the show, too. Most of it is a derivative of the main theme in the movies, although not as blunt. Lyrical melody is mixed with synthetic drum beats to great effect, IMO. I simply love the piece playing at main menus on DVD. It puts you in a right mood for watching this tale.    There are several main story arcs, and a couple of secondary arcs throughout the first season. There are no stand-alone episodes. Lastly, the episodes (and maybe the writing) get better the farther you are in the season. The last episode was probably the best example of the potential and of what there is to come in later seasons.

I'm too young to be nostalgic about the 60's, I just think things sounded better then.    Since Mutt Lange crash landed on pop music, we've had 20 years of close microphoned, super compressed, and up-front-in-your-face mixing. And since Whitney Houston, most soul singers try to out do themselves with the amount of malisma they can force out of their lungs.
B001CFLHJA|5.0|One test of an album is, how many times do I want to listen to it?  I listened to this one five times before I took a break.  That's a lot for me.  Usually I'm relieved to get through a new album so I can go back to something I really like.  I switched to The Brian Blade Fellowship's Season of Changes for comparison, but I couldn't get through it before I had to go back to Invisible Cinema for another listen.  There are at least four things that make this album so satisfying to me.  First, there is the physical quality of the playing.  Aaron Parks and Mike Moreno both have a beautiful touch, delicate, precise, and supremely confident.  Second, there's a lot of variety on this album.  In different places it reminds of Brad Mehldau, The Bad Plus, Radiohead, The Pat Metheny Group, world music, and more, but I like Invisible Cinema more than anything I've recently heard from these other artists.  Third, Parks makes excellent use of harmonies and other ideas from progressive pop.  He even gives us a great bluesy number in \\"Roadside Distraction\\" and a great folky number in \\"Praise.\\"  Fourth, despite the variety, the album is unified by a very strong artistic vision.  Ben Ratliff in his recent \\"Critics' Choice\\" blurb questioned the clarity and consistency of Parks's leadership here, but in my opinion this is just further evidence of Ratliff's unreliability as a critic.
B000N4SHPS|1.0|To be honest, I kind of wish this film didn't exist. I was (and still am) a huge a fan of the Rocky series and while IV and V certainly have their faults, I found a lot more to dislike about Rocky Balboa.    I understand the main motivation for Rocky to get back into the ring is Adrian's death (thus the necessity to have her written out of the story so that there's actually a point to even having a 6th movie) but at this point, I feel that Stallone similarly already went down this road with Mickey and Apollo and because of that, there's not much of anything new being done here plot-wise. The difference here though is the entire film is heartwrenchingly sad and depressing all the way to the very end. If Stallone's goal was to choke people up throughout the course of the film, he certainly succeeded. But, for as much as Rocky loses in his life (watches Mickey die, sees Apollo get killed, loses his fortune, etc.) would it have been so wrong to have the story of Rocky be put to rest with him for once winning outside of the ring (ie. life) and be able to live out his later years with the 1 thing he presumably loves more than boxing? And I know, this goes back to the argument that it was necessary for Adrian to be gone for this film to even be made. Which is why I would have preferred it not have been. Or, at the very least, have taken another angle. Simply put, its too unsettling of a way to close out the saga.    Another major gripe I had with the film was Rocky's foe, Mason Dixon, was incredibly undeveloped to the point that I almost didn't even care about the boxing match itself. So much of the movie focuses on Rocky dealing with his grief, that there's no time for boxing to be the focus save for a few scenes.     The few positives I could find out of the film mostly included the nostalgia of it. Stallone did a good job of tying in a lot of stuff from the past films. The acting is solid and Paulie was entertaining as usual. But, between the lackluster build-up of Rocky's match with Dixon and the tremendously depressing story, the ending is far too unsettling for me and in my opinion, didn't really redeem anything from the fifth film. When Stallone knew that the only solid vehicle he could come up with to push out a sixth installment was to write out yet another main character (which now adds up to being a major plot point in 1/2 of all the Rocky movies), he should have known there wasn't much left to say and to just let it be. Or, to have thought this one out a little harder.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|By far one of the more intriguing books out there...I totally loved all of it.

B000AA4JMU|4.0|The packaging of the soundtrack with the movie together is a great way to celebrate this outstanding film.  Like many, this version of Oliver represents The Oliver, so objectivity is thrown to the wind.  The characters are all as well developed as possible, given the superficiality of the original Dickensonian serial.  How do you take such a biting commentary on modern life and trivialize it with song and a happy ending? The answer to that question lies on this DVD.  How to learn all the songs so you can sing them with the family and perform them in local theater?  The CD soundtrack provides that.  All in a neat package.  A good value for fans of the musical and for families.

031606792X|4.0|The twilight saga was a teen book; the fact is easy to proof since it's for young adults. The story itself is like reading this contemporary fairy tale. Girl meets boy... boy turns out to be vampire and they have a few problems. It's as easy as it is. The books are colored with immaturity --most of it coming from Bella and Jacob-- but if readers took their time to actually analyze the books you'll see they always have a fairy tale ending. Even Eclipse since it leads to Breaking Dawn. And so, with this fact established, I do not understand what readers expected in Breaking Dawn? I read most of the reviews before I started reading. I read the flames and the Commendations. Some sounded completely empty and others sounded like tamtrums to me; I don't let myself be biased by reviews though the spoilers were leaving me a bad taste, and I was already thinking I may have wasted my money with this book. I have to say it was totally worth it! The writing style is the same as with the other three previous books. What people are complaining about is totally absurd, when you think about Bella's previous adventures when she was human and she still survived, the events unraveled in Breaking Dawn are similar and believable. It is still painted as a fairy tale; moreover, you still get your share of angst, romance and action. There is also some play for power, envy, pride, and lust included; everything you see in reality. So I do not understand all the flames and complains where do they come from? I found the book enjoyable and fast paced as the others. I highly recommend it to people who read to enjoy a good time but who have their feet on the ground. This is fiction! In real life if you were to find a \\"vampire\\", (not likely!) he wont declare his love for you but suck you dry.
0307386171|1.0|While very well written, this book was a total snooze.  It took McEwan a very long time to get to the point, but then the story was rushed at the end.      Not recommended unless you have read this author before and enjoyed his work.

B00006CXSS|3.0|Sometimes it feels like a recruitment commercial.  The series shows the hellish side of combat, only to end with happy faces all around.  In fact, it seems to be centered more about the military career (going up the ladder) than about the actual war happening.  Being an American production, that is understandable.  Of course the characters depicted are all good workers, ups, sorry, soldiers.  For a better, non-jingoistic, and relevant look at war, see \\"Generation Kill\\".

B00005JPUN|3.0|This film has been getting mixed reviews, but I liked it. It's not great, but I've seen much worse. Considering the original is a classic, it's very hard not to criticize this film. This version is actually pretty scary with a good amount of tension and paranoia. The original film has been made more than once, so I welcomed the changes to the story and thought it worked fairly well. Most Sci-Fi films from the 50's were sort of dumb, so if you look at this film as a homage to that era, you can't say it's not at least as good as most from that time period. I watched this on cable, so I don't know about the DVD or the extras.
0446402389|4.0|This thriller is one of the most hyped books this summer. The story follows one man's hunt to catch a serial killer of children. In typical thriller fashion, different chapters reveal what is happening with the protagonist, the killer, and occasionally victims or other side characters. Most chapters end with a cliff hanger before checking in with another character in the next.<br /><br />Where Child 44 differs from the usual Safeway novel thrillers is in its setting - the story takes place in a Soviet Union ruled by Stalin. Clearly the author did quite a bit of research into that era, and he does a good job of showing the horrors and difficulties of life during that time. Much of the novel is spent developing the characters and setting - the murder investigations don't really rev up until the second half of the book.<br /><br />Although the dialog is sometimes over-earnest and the who-dunnit aspect of the story is not very exciting, this book is still worth a read because of the dark but fascinating world and time it draws the reader into. This book should appeal to mystery/thriller fans, as well as those who enjoy historical fiction.
0060882611|5.0|Classic book and I want to read it to my son.  I'm sure he'll appreciate it when he gets older.  It was shipped in perfect condition.  Thank you!
0061537934|5.0|I read this book in two sittings, and it is now one of my favorite fiction books. The narrator is a dog who who hopes to one day become a man, despite bearing witness to the cruelties that people can inflict on one another. He realizes and shows the reader through the story he tells that although things can look hopeless love, determination, and loyalty can often set things right.<br /><br />Clearly this book will appeal to dog lovers, but hopefully this book will find wider appeal. This book would also appeal to fans of Jodi Picoult because of a controversial subplot. Men will appreciate the descriptions of car races and references to famous drivers. This book will take you through emotional highs and lows. Any lover of engrossing fiction should be as happy to go along for the ride that Garth Stein offers as would the canine narrator Enzo in his master's race car.

B000RF7XYO|5.0|If you love historical movies, then this movie is one to see.  Cate Blanchett was made for this movie.  Watching it, I almost thought that Cate is actually Queen Elizabeth, and not portraying the role of queen Elizabeth.  However, I suggest that if you want to follow Queen Elizabeth's birth and rise to her status as queen, then I recommend the following purchases to compliment this GREAT movie.  First,  \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\"  which depicts Elizabeth's birth and the beheading of her mother, whom wanted to sleep with her brother (Elizabeth's uncle) in the hopes of producing a baby boy to replace the infant son she miscarried for her husband, the King of England.  Secondly, \\"Elizabeth\\" which begins with Elizabeth as a young girl whom loves to dance with her friend Robert.  However, when she becomes queen after an attempt to execute her for her religious beliefs, she falls in love with Robert whom beds her often.  The only problem is that Robert is married and Queen Elizabeth is unaware of his marriage to another until told by her trusted advisor.  He tells her because the powers-that-be, during that time, wanted Elizabeth to marry and produce an heir, but she considered herself married to England and was called \\"The Virgin Queen.\\"  View the movie to see how this queen reigns supreme with her God, her love for her people and England. Finally, you can purchase \\"Elizabeth, The Golden Age\\" to see how Queen Elizabeth is besieged.[[ASIN:B0012QE4Q2 The Other Boleyn  Girl]  ][[ASIN:B000ZOXDFA Elizabeth  - The Golden Age (Widescreen Edition)]]

B001BGTWXI|4.0|Slipknot never fail to impress me.  When you talk about \\"ambition\\" in music, Slipknot epitomizes ambition. ALL HOPE IS GONE is no different from other Slipknot albums in the sense of capitolizing on ambition and creativity. It serves as another strong addtion to Slipknot's discography.<br /><br />\\".execute\\" serves an excellent intro to ALL HOPE IS GONE as it is representative of the sounds and ideas that ALL HOPE IS GONE pushes.  \\"Gemantra (The Killing Name)\\" is where the real meat lies, serving as a fine opening track.  From the jagged opening guitar riffs of \\"Gemantra\\", you can tell the \\"masked freaks\\" are going to take you for quite a trip, as always.  They may also drag you to hell with them along the way, if you know what I mean, but maybe that is a risk that listener must make.  Content aside, \\"Gemantra\\" is certainly creative by all means with it's anthemic screams, sick drumming, sick guitar riffs, and rapid change of styles. Slipknot may not flip-flop styles like say The Mars Volta, but they do a pretty good job at being unpredicatable.<br /><br />A personal favorite, \\"Sulfur\\" features more dark, hellish sounding guitar work. Dark, malicious sound effects run rapid.  As far a mixing, this track is well mixed.  Panning adds a heightened sense of dramatacism while the layers of guitars blend perfectly.  The drums within the production throughout the entire album are well engineered.  What is more relatable about this album overall is the \\"hookiness\\".  There is actually something to grasp onto as opposed to feeling \\"lost\\" within Slipknot's dark 'orchestrations'.  \\"Sulfur\\" is representative of this as is exceptional first single \\"Psychosocial\\", which knocaks ALL HOPE IS GONE out of the park.  From the opening yelled \\"I did my time...\\" to the last note of the last bar, \\"Psychosocial\\" is a trip (a freakin' scary one maybe, but a trip).<br /><br />\\"Dead Memories\\" is tamer than the first three full tracks, but not tame enough to still scare you or seem inauthentic for Slipknot. It is 100% solid, as is every track on ALL HOPE IS GONE.  \\"Vendetta\\" resurrects the creepy sounds not present on \\"Dead Memories\\" with chilling cymbal work and jagged, uncouth sounding guitars. Keeping up the trend is the spastic \\"Butcher's Hook\\" followed by the understated, yet chilling guitar work of \\"Gehenna\\".  \\"Gehenna\\" doesn't posses the impulsiveness of \\"Butcher's Hook\\", but it is even more potent because of its understated nature. However, patches of overwrought screams and hellish ideals make evident that Slipknot are nowhere near wanting to embrace \\"the light\\".<br /><br />\\"This Cold Black\\" keeps up the pace with twice the manic nature of \\"Gehenna\\". \\"Wherein Lies Continue\\", \\"Snuff\\", and \\"All Hope Is Gone\\" all end the album with the vitality that it began with.  \\"Snuff\\" is surprisingly a ballad utitlizing acoustic guitars.  Even more surprising is that \\"Snuff\\" features some major chords! However, when the listener still hears the \\"f-bomb\\", you know that Slipknot is still as dark as ever.  \\"All Hope Is Gone\\" resurrects the jagged guitar lines that pervade \\"Vendetta\\".  It is quite the appropriate title track. As with all title tracks, there are always better tracks on the album. While this is true, \\"All Hope Is Gone\\" ends ALL HOPE IS GONE exceptionally.<br /><br />Overall, ALL HOPE IS GONE is one sick album, in more ways than one!

B000X5SPBI|5.0|Season 3 was to date, one of the best-written seasons of this top-notch series which just gets better and better from one year to the next. Eric Kripke and his writers keep raising the bar for themselves and they always clear it with room to spare. It was a little frustrating that the series got truncated due to the writer's strike last year, but all around, it was a solid season. The character development was top-drawer: Dean's deal with the Crossroads Demon forces him to reassess himself and confront his own mortality, while Sam has slowly start to toughen up inside, as he faces the prospect of a life without his big brother. And how Kripke and company are going to top the literal end-up-in-hell cliffhanger at the end of the season, and move on from there in Season 4 is going to be exciting to watch.<br /><br />I'm a little sad to see no full-length audio commentaries for any episodes, but the Special features which this set offers are just as good, particulalarly the feature on the make-up and VFX and the segment on the several black 1967 Chevy Impalas used for the \\"Metallicar\\" we know and love, and the spolight segments on several episodes.<br /><br />And if I had to pick a favorite episode this season, I'd be very hard-put to make a definate list of them, since this was such a solid season. \\"The Kids Are All Right\\" brought in an interesting take on changelings, which I never expected to see on this series; \\"A Very Supernatural Christmas\\" was a great, wonderfully twisted holiday offering; \\"Dream a Little Dream of Me\\" was a great reality-bender and gave you some insights on the most hidden little corners of the psyches of three of our main characters (as well as showing us the backstory on Bobby Singer); \\"Mystery Spot\\" had me giggling and wincing through the whole episode; and nothing can top the cliffhanger ending of \\"No Rest for the Wicked\\": I'm wondering just what Kripke and company are going to throw at the boys at the end of next season!

1592400876|4.0|I thought this was a fun book, although I'm not sure that I agree with all of the author's points. Clearly, she cares a great deal about grammar in a way that the rest of us might not.

184195392X|5.0|Part One:  a child/adolescent tries to sort out which religion is the \\"right\\" religion. By the end of Part One, Pi chooses them all.    Part Two: an adolescent is the sole survivor of a shipwreck.  Interrogators are sent to determine the reason why the ship sunk. In their interview they listen to the entire story that Pi has presented in Part Two -- which sounds to them like a fantasy. So, Pi gives them another story which they believe.  The interrogators never do pursue their original purpose: to determine why the ship sunk.      Part Two is one big metaphor for Part One.     I found myself completely disenchanted with the entire book as I plowed through it; it seemed amateurish, some of it was directly from Robinson Crusoe (both diaries ended abruptly due to running out of ink/paper), etc.    Robinson Crusoe is so much more believable.    And that was my attitude: plowing through the book. Drudgery. And then slam bang hit me in the face two pages near the very end that, an epiphany, explained it all. I was blown away -- after all that reading, in just two pages, I was blown away.    I think that if the author had written in a more sophisticated style (like the great late 19th and early 20th century writers), the book may have appeared to be better literature. But written in an adolescent style makes sense -- it was being narrated by an adolescent.    So, the book is not great literature in terms of sentence structure, vocabulary, metaphors, etc., but the way it hits you at the end will keep you thinking about it for quite some time.     One question: is there more hidden in the book that I might have missed? Is it worth reading a second or a third time once one has discovered the message? It might be.    But regardless, Part Two is a parable every bit as good as any parable in the Bible -- just a whole lot longer, and requires Part One as background to explain to the reader why the author wrote this book. In fact, had there been no Part One, the book would have made no sense.  Part One is crucial to understanding the message in Part Two.    So, five stars for overall impact; three stars for \\"fun to read\\" as great literature. It is probably written at the 8th grade level, but its message is probably too deep for those not yet at college level reading.

B0006Z2LP6|2.0|Being a big follower of the space program since the mid-1960s, I was really excited when Apollo 13 was released..first on VHS, then to DVD.  But on both the DVD-released versions, why are there scenes missing?  One that I noticed right away is when Barbara Lovell(the Lovell's eldest daughter) doesn't want to go to Mission Control to watch the TV broadcast from space.  Presumably because she is upset over the Beatle's breakup.  Then much of the TV broadcast itself from the VHS version is missing.  There were more missing, as well.  It was a little disconcerting..especially with the \\"anniversary\\" edition.  But the essence of the story..the triumph of the human spirit in the face of extraordinary odds...still remains true.

0192853619|4.0|An informative and interesting book at times, although readers seeking a more basic introduction to the subject of mathematics should look elsewhere. This book, which presumes that its reader already has high school-level math, should more properly be titled \\"A Very Short Introduction to Advanced Mathematics.\\"     Gowers is comfortable writing about mathematical concepts, filling his pages with references to complex numbers, fractional dimensions, the atlas of a three-dimensional manifold, and so on. If you're curious to know why the parallel postulate does not hold within spherical or hyperbolic geometries, you will find Gowers helpful. But if you want a more historical, less concept-driven overview of the field, you will likely be disappointed. These things are mentioned, but only in a hurried, fragmented way.     As I read through the book I grew to dislike the author's tone, which announces on practically every page, \\"I'm a mathematics professor and you're not.\\" It tends to come across as condescending and grating after a while.     In all, though, this interesting little book may serve to stimulate more reading in higher-level math, if you're already somewhat oriented in that direction. But if you just want to understand more about the basic ideas of math, its history, and so on, you will probably find Gowers' book difficult and offputting.
B000A6T262|5.0|In one collection a viewer can follow the changes in the Star Trek cast and production staff as the stories evolve from the original cast to the Next Generation crew.  And the second disc accompanying each feature video gives the reader the perspectives of cast and production staff after the films had been made.  The collection is a pleasure for long time Star Trek fans as a capsule history of the Star Trek phenomenon.  For a younger audience it is a look at what intrigued many of us for so many years.  When the production staff lost its way - and it did, the story lines became ordinary and the shows died.  However, that does not diminish the quality of the ten films.  With any luck, the upcoming film can recapture what Gene created:  A show with a hopeful theme - Humans can continue to grow and improve.
0061537934|5.0|This is a must read for anyhone who has ever shared their life with a dog, or rather anyone who has had a dog that let them share their life with them. Warm, funny and  totally engaging.  This is a book that I will read many more times.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|Amazing Grace is one of the most passionate and beautifully made movies that I've seen in a long time.  This 2007 film tells the true tale of William Wilberforce, a member of the British Parlament in the 18th and 19th centuries, who worked tirelessly to end the British slave trade. Invest in this engaging film and you will not regret a second of it.  Ioan Gruffudd (pronounced Yoan Griffid),the Fantastic Four movies, turns in a powerhouse performance as Wilberforce, He is not alone in this the others in the cast include Rufus Sewell,(from The Illusionist,he plays good guy this time) Michael Gambon(the later Harry Potter movies),the Romola Garai, Ciaran Hinds(Rome), Toby Jones, and Albert Finney as the author of the much loved and much sung title hymn.      I will tell you that when I borrowed this move from my library, after waiting over a month for it, I almost didn't give it back.  I REALLY LOVED THIS MOVIE!!!!
B000P7V45S|5.0|\\"Trick\\" is in my Top 5 \\"desert island\\" CDs. When I discovered the LP in April 1977, I was a 19-year-old dude narrowly focused on Zep/Sab/Purple hard-rock and whatever AOR was on the FM at the time. (Which, I will say-- (1) is music that I still kinda get off on, and (2) blows away most FM rawk nowadays.)    \\"Trick\\" opened me up to WAY more musical possibilities. Within a year, my LP collection went from 9 (mostly Purple) to over 70 (everything from Budgie, to the Carpenters, to Coltrane). Yeah-- hearing this ONE ALBUM did that! (Your mileage may vary.)    I won't go into a glowing review of it here, nor a track-by-track breakdown (not to mention the DVD vid extras)... there's lots of previous reviews that have already done that, here.    Let's just say, I've heard this release *hundreds* of times over the past 30 years-- and I know the performance, and (in particular) the mix and the mastering of this recording almost intimately. Beyond the original LP, I've owned the mid-80's \\"Mobile Fidelity\\" remaster LP, the original CD (still have it), and the mid-90's remaster (yuk). They all have slight differences in tone/EQ... but this release is different.    Now they've haven't just re-EQed the original 1976 mixdown--  they've cued up the original 16-track studio tapes and created a whole NEW mix. Not just for the 5.1 mixes on Disk 2-- but for the basic stereo mixes on Disk 1 as well.    Do I think this is a good thing? (Wait for it...) YES!    Now understand this: When I say \\"remix\\", don't think of it in the modern sense (songs radically re-arranged, drum tracks sampled in, random vocal tracks flying in out of nowhere). Relax-- none of that happens here!    Each song is mixed straight beginning-to-end. But what this new mix does is make some *slightly* different choices in what instruments are raised/lowered within the mix.     It's VERY subtle... and that's why I made such a big deal about my knowing this recording so well. I may be the only one (or one of very few) thatwould notice the difference between THIS mix and the original.    Overall, the tone/EQ of this mix is much beefier and yet more detailed than the 1976 original. But having said that... I sat and listened to this... and rediscovered The Magic of why I fell in love with \\"Trick\\", all over again.    The effect is like hearing an \\"alternative take\\", where they nailed the album take 99 per cent... but now you hear Hackett doing something during the quiet part of \\"Squonk\\"... or the back vox of \\"Entangled\\" are just a wee bit subdued. Tiny tiny subtle things; you know you're hearing the original performance you're familiar with, and it never lets you forget that... but with little peeks of things left off the original mix.    At this point, I could go into dweeby detail, all shamelessly subjective. But nahhh... I'll spare you. I promised you I wouldn't do that.  lol    I'll just say this: I still have my mid-80's CD, and this will not replace it. But that's just me--my personal \\"Trick\\" memories.    However, if you haven't ever heard \\"Trick\\" before, I can definitely recommend this version-- hear it in all its glory (plus the new interviews, and clean stereo transfers of the live-1976 show you've seen clips on YouTube).    But if you've heard and loved this recording for years/decades as I have, take a leap and pick this up. No, it may not make you wanna ditch your old copy... but you will appreciate this fresh, yet respectful reconsideration of their sublime post-PG masterpiece.
B000FP2Z0S|5.0|Rise Against is my favorite band out there, and this is the album that truly decided that. This is by far one of their best, right next to Siren Song of the Counter Culture. They keep putting out amazing work and I would like to review each song:    1: Chamber the Cartridge: This song starts out with a small intro, then goes right into a drum roll with \\"This Is Noise\\" coming in. All the instruments then start an intro, and it goes right into a powerful song. The chorus is catchy and the song is well written.  Score: 8.6/10    2: Injection: An amazing song with a fast, catchy beat. Originally called \\"Done With The Compass\\" this song delivers powerful lyrics of drug addiction, and somebody who is trying to get out of the habit.  Score: 9.6/10    3: Ready To Fall: Probably the downfall of the album. It's not a bad song by any means but it's probably the worst. Overall there isn't anything truly special about it, but it's still a good song.  Score: 7.6/10    4: Bricks: Fast, short, and good song. It's about retaliation against whatever, pretty much their name. It's bridge is very catchy and easily one of the most punk songs they have on the album.  Score: 8.6/10    5: Under The Knife: I have yet to understand the metaphor this song portrays, but it talks about surgery as a metaphore. Overall I like this song, and it's pretty good.  Score: 8.3/10    6: Prayer of the Refugee: Great song, one of my favorites on the album. A father is telling the story of what happened to their culture, through a very powerful chorus, and it's incredibly catchy. It's a very well written song and I love it.  Score: 9.6/10    7: Drones: Great song as well. It's about how sweatshops run and slaves in third world countries work. One of my favorites well with a very catchy chorus. The bass enters with a powerful line, and then they gather into classic Rise Against controlled chaos.  Score: 9.1/10    8: The Approaching Curve: The lyrics are very well written, but overall it's not put together right. The verse is spoken word, but...meh, I don't really like that as much as singing. It's a good song though, the chorus is catchy and the instrumentals are pretty good.  Score: 7.9/10    9: Worth Dying For: GREAT song. Powerful and catchy, with a catchy chorus and bridge. The verse is a little different than the rest, but it's still good, but not as catchy. The bass enters the bridge with a riff, then they all join again. Over all a great song.  Score: 9.7/10    10: Behind Closed Doors: Great song, overall kinda predictable, except for the chorus. Very catchy all the way through and very well written, especially the lyrics.  Score: 8.9/10    11: Roadside: A beautiful song, written almost acoustic but with a clean guitar instead, which sets the mood more. No bass or drums, but a fiddle and a female vocalist join Tim and the guitar, and it's a great song.  Score: 9.4/10    12: The Good Left Undone: Great song, with a fast verse, and a softer chorus. Bridge is powerful and both guitars work very well together in this track. At the end of the track is an intro to the next song, Survive.  Score: 8.7/10    13: Survive: Amazing is one way to put it, but that would be an understatement. This song is by far the best on the album and is amazingly written, and has become one of my favorite by Rise Against. The song is about how they overcome their struggles, and it delivers. This is the only song with profanity, saying \\"F***\\" 4 times, giving it it's Explicit Content sticker. If you don't like that, there is a clean version of the album available. Overall this is my favorite song on the album and I know this will get you to love Rise Against.  Score: 10/10
0345442970|5.0|I recently got back in to reading Star Wars novels.  The last ones I read were the first set of X-Wing books back when they came out, so it's been a while.  I'd say I chose a great book to get back in to the series!  One of the things I liked about the prequel movies was all of the backplot dealing with how Palpatine came to power, but I often felt that there was more that could be told about it.      This novel definitely shows the amount of genius that Palpatine possesses and how he deftly plays MULTIPLE factions against each other.  Yes, there are some familiar players from the movies, but this book gives alot more screen time to new characters and those with minor, at best, roles in the movies such as Supreme Chancellor Valorum.  Combine that with a plot with quite a few twists that you don't see coming, especially the one at the end, and you have a sure fire winner.  Only one warning though.  Like the prequel movies themselves, this one has a dark overtone and you shouldn't expect a particularly happy ending...  But that's why Palpatine is so awesome.  He really needs his own set of books to tell how he came to be the Sith Lord.  He's just so meticulously evil that you have to love the guy.

B00004YZT5|3.0|I think Poison is the gayest band EVER, however.....Richie Kotzen plays on this cd, so you should check it out for that reason only. This is the only Poison cd that holds any water, thanks to Kotzen.
B000002JSJ|5.0|Released in 1976, Led Zeppelin's 7th album has always been unfairly overlooked by fans and critics who'd expected another epic along the lines of their previous album \\"Physical Graffiti\\". And were seemingly disappointed by the even stranger than normal artwork (what was that black thing anyway?) and just seven songs. It was if the band had taken a \\"ho-hum\\" approach to their albums. They knew ANYTHING they released was guaranteed to sell a million copies in its first week. Seven songs? Who did they think they were, Steely Dan? Add to this the rise of punk rockers in England who regarded Zeppelin as boring old farts whose demise couldn't come fast enough. Relations within the band were tense as well. Robert Plant had been in a near fatal car wreck in Greece and practically recorded the entire album in a wheelchair. Jimmy Page and John Bonham's dalliances with heroin had turned into full-fledged addictions. And John Paul Jones felt his role in the band was merely taken for granted.  So the band was in an unfamiliar position; backs to the wall and needing a strong album to prove they still had \\"it\\" in them. To do this, the band decamped to Munich's Musicland Studios and pushed themselves to deliver a new album in (for them) a record time of 2 weeks, as the Rolling Stones were due to arrive and start their next album. Legend has it that Page completed all the guitar overdubs in one night; then asked Mick Jagger for one extra day of studio time. Jagger agreed, and when he arrived Page proudly told him the album was finished;  Jagger: \\"Oh, you got the basic tracks done?\\"  Page: \\"No, the ENTIRE album is done.\\"  This was at a time when the Stones needed two weeks to record ONE song.  \\"Presence\\" is a different album because of this. The proto-hippie acoustic tunes of the past are nowhere to be found here. This is a much tougher sounding and uncompromising album as a result starting with the opener. \\"Achilles Last Stand\\" is probably the longest song they've ever recorded at nearly 11 minutes of soaring vocals, galloping guitars, rock bottom bass and machine gun drums. \\"Nobody's Fault But Mine\\" is without a doubt one of the best songs they ever recorded with it's heavily phased guitar intro and Plant's wail of a deal he wants out of (Drugs or the Devil?) before it slams into a thunderous groove that only stops for a second as Plant quietly laments; \\"nobody's fault but mine\\". Though they were never a singles band, \\"Candy Store Rock\\" really could've been a hit single as the band do their best impression of a Sun Records rockabilly act. \\"Hots on for Nowhere\\" is Robert Plant strutting his stuff vocally while John Bonham lays down a shuffle straight out of the James Brown school of drumming. I have to say that the sound quality of \\"Tea for One\\" is remarkable and harkens back to the smooth drum sound the band had on its early albums before it drops into a slow melancholy blues that seems to say that the band was tired and that bad times were coming soon. Those bad times were the '77 tour that saw fan riots, hard drugs everywhere, and the death of Plant's son. Jimmy Page seems to have pulled out all the stops here and used every guitar trick he could think of. IMO, If Zeppelin had stopped here, their place in rock history would've been solid. If any album in the Zeppelin catalog could be called a letdown, it was \\"In Through the Out Door\\".
B000DWMN2S|5.0|This is literally one of the best movies I've ever seen. The first half of the movie, you will laugh uncontrollably at the cultural misunderstandings and crazy antics of the characters; then, the story morphs into a drama that  grabs your heart and twists it like dough. I've never watched a movie that causes me to feel so many emotions in one sitting. And I was drawn into it within the first 3 minutes.  Also, it is very, VERY quotable.
B0019FOC5E|5.0|I got my CD sooner than expected and love it I can hardly wait for the DVD. I saw the movie.  Thanks
