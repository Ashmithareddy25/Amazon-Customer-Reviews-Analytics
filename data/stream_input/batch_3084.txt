B00BATKPBE|5.0|The stars are for the content - the Kindle version is DEFECTIVE! At and before the 14% mark, verses of the poems quoted are set up with 1-2 letters per line. Almost impossible to read.
B00125WAWS|5.0|I shared this movie with my high school debate class, and every person was interested in this historic story. It was purposeful for my class and teaches about the power of argumentation in regards to the civil rights movement.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I was caught up in the writing of this book from the first chapter. I had to stop myself from highlighting the entire book. The story is written in such a way that I felt hungry when he felt hungry and that kind of closeness to the character made this book a special read for me.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Neil Gaiman has not written a book I haven't enjoyed. I only wish that this novel lasted longer. The point of view from characters (beings) who existed with the beginning of time is fascinating.
B00EKQ3YZI|2.0|I was very excited to hear this one, although while keeping my enthusiasm in check. Donna Summer has never been a producer's vehicle. Work Moroder has done with other vocalists has proven just how much she's contributed to her recorded catalogue. Likewise, work that Summer has done without Moroder has held up on its own. Nuance, attitude, power all come from Summer's voice. Everything else going on around it is lucky to be there and is punctuated by her tremendous interpretive skills. Even during her original 12\\" singles, sometimes extended past 10 minutes, it was never the sound effects or the instrumental that made the track the song--it was Donna. Even producers and mixers who worked on her material during the 80's and beyond understood that placing the focus on any element other Donna's voice was a big mistake...and therein lies the problem with Love To Love You Donna. Remixers & DJs today are too arrogant about what they do. Somewhere on the path to this age of the superstar DJ the notion that what they're really there to do is to enhance someone else's work was lost. Whatever a mixer touches today, for the most part, ends up being about their self-lauded \\"skills\\" and totally neglects the integrity of the song. They seem to approach a project as a platform for themselves, not as a showcase for the original track, and the quality and art of remixing someone else's songs have both suffered for it. Little seems to be understood anymore about the concept of a song from start to finish, as hooks, small-minded phrases, and sound effects have taken over much of what is dumped on the dance floor these days. The Chromeo mix of Love Is In Control, a love letter to early 80s synth pop, falls short of a complete win simply because during points in the song the music is too stiff to move with Donna's superior vocal--and that's clearly not Donna's fault. It's a great instrumental track but matched against this song...it's half-baked at best. Where are Junior Vasquez, Hex Hector, Francois Kevorkian, Arthur Baker, Todd Terry, Danny Tenaglia--mixers from the last generation, but mixers who clearly understand the delicate balance between artistic self-expression and the reason for mixing to begin with. Many of the tracks on Love To Love You Donna are mixed by producers & DJs who reduce Donna's vocals to percussive sound effects, leaving classic songs virtually unrecognizable, and that's a waste of such a superior resource. There are a couple of veterans here who have contributed quality mixes and kept Donna's vocal intact. Although, I have to ask why Frankie Knuckles neutered the rock element out of Hot Stuff. Although, he and Eric Kupper do use the keyboard riff to great effect. (Same thing with Gigamesh's treatment of Bad Girls, as opportunities to showcase two of the great rock vocals of all-time were neglected with both songs.) Afrojack brought his best game to I Feel Love, understanding not to mess with perfection. Instead, he uses the techno lexicon of the day to enhance the iconic and hypnotic nuance of the song--very considerate. Moroder & Chris Cox do justice to Love To Love You Baby, as well, bringing the electronic future of I Feel Love to a mostly acoustic track that predated it--very clever. La Dolce Vita, the unreleased track with Moroder, is a gem, too, hinting at the magic that's perhaps still left on the shelves and in the ether. More LP tracks could have been mined for this project, and placed in the hands of capable mixer, of course. (Based on his work on the mentioned I Feel Love I'd be curious to hear what Afrojack would have done with Now I Need You.) Although, Working The Midnight Shift is a disaster, as Holy Ghost! chose to feature another vocalist instead of Summer. How criminal. So, go forth with caution. There are shining moments here, those where Donna shines, but few of those moments are contributed by the credited mixers and DJs.<br /><br />After having said all this I just have one question: Why not skip thisnonsense and just get to reissuing Summer's catalogue? It's a strong library and each LP is surrounded with gem-like material that is just waiting to be added as bonus tracks. Surely, there's a heap of unreleased release-quality material just dying to see the light of day, as well. She really has a captive audience, too. Those of us who were willing to waste cash on this slop are proof!
B002LAM7PI|5.0|Luv this movie it's one of my favorites And so much fun my sisters luv to watch this movie with me and always want me to get it
0385532458|5.0|OUTSTANDING BOOK ONE OF THE GREATEST BOOKS EVER WRITTEN  I have shared this book many times and will continue to share it with others
B004JMY312|5.0|I like to watch this movie on Halloween one of my all time favorites it's really funny and a great movie.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|A good read but lacking in the action and detail of previous stories in the series. Still recommend if you like the series as the story moves forward.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Works great. If only it could stream more than just Netflix & YouTube. Hope google adds more sites to stream soon
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I hate the ending. More than anything. How could prim die? Gale should have died and Prim should have lived. But besides that, this book is amazing and one of the best books I've ever read.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|it has ocassionally frozen And<br /> stopped working and I would have to force close.I also experienced some problems with the snooze not going back off.
B0088EDMMS|4.0|I absolutely love this movie! Best Halloween movie ever!!!!<br /><br />I gave it four stars because I was hoping for special features. There's just a blu-ray disc and a regular one, which I guess would come in handy if you were without a Blu-Ray player for whatever reason.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this app is very fun me &amp; my friends love to see who can go the farthest! I reccomend this app to everyone
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I've been using this app for several months now and I haven't had any problems with it. I like the ability to check the charging time, temperature of my Kindle Fire 7\\" HD, and the amperage. This is a great app and I highly recommend it.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|I love to play this game is very addicting  and I don't know I just think it's a great game to play for all ages
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Great App. Let's me know the current and future weather based on location. I don't have to wait for the one on tv to get to my area.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Just a great and imaginative series. My son and I greatly enjoyed it. Great storyline as well. Too bad it ended but they tied things up well.
B00ECR7L0Y|5.0|My favorite Director + My Favorite Play + amazingly talented actors = Exquisite Movie! Loved this from beginning to end. And the cinematography in Black and white on Blue Ray is gorgeous!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|great game that everyone should get and the best part... its FREE!!!! I would recommend everybody to get this amazing game ive never been bored since I got this game.
B009XI7RF6|5.0|Ok so all those people that give it a one star and say ooh it is WAY to hard. Well guess what. I got it for the free app of the day and I probably would have bought it even for 0.99. Because all good games have at least a LITTLE challenge. so don't give it a one star just because its a little challenging. It is really fun and I would recommend it.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun to play and have a great time. I like candy so I think it is very time consuming because I take along time to eat my candy.
B0033H7VI6|5.0|Purchased this and a Ka-Bar BK2. It is a solid full tang knife and for the price it is just as good as the BK2. The only advantage the BK2 has is a better kydex sheath. Either way, I have put this knife to work and it has been great so far. This will probably last me the rest of my life and then some. I would recommend this for anyone looking for a good bush crafting knife.
B004VFOT4I|5.0|We watched this movie as a supplement to an assignment for my daughter's history class. Really enjoyed the whole musical, very well done. Classic!
B004SF2KNI|5.0|Two of the best guitar players of all time doing what they do best .Only once in a lifetime can you find quality of this kind .
B00BSBR9N6|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It kept me enthralled through the entire novel.  The novel was well written and is worth purchasing.
B00CHS31DG|3.0|This app was ok.  I didn't find it as much fun as I thought I would.  It did give raise the hair on the back of my neck a couple of times at the beginning.  I didn't try it at night.  I don't think I would have the nerve.  I think for all of you brave souls that are willing to do so, good luck.  So, even though I didn't necessarily like the app, I think for people out there that enjoy being scared, it would be something they would enjoy.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|It's good product! It is working properly.  It is good product but sometime connection is lost.  However, it is worth it with this price.  I waited for 2 month since I ordered it.
B00FWLSOOG|5.0|Great effects & good story! Also very good cast selection! Me and my grandson can't stop watching it! You will want to buy it!
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|you should get it I love this game so awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!get this game you will love it so much.  :)  this is the best game ever.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Great film, loads of extras on this format , much better than region 2 release. Well worth the effort of buying this edition and region recommended!!!
B004DLPXAO|2.0|I've had a Droid DNA since the end of December 2012. The Kindle app came pre-installed. Up until the middle of September everything was great, & I use this app on several other Android devices as well. However, beginning sometime after Sept. 26, this app on my Droid DNA began consuming enormous amounts of data; so much so that on a 4GB plan shared by 4 family members, this app used almost 2 gigs of data between 9/26 and 10/18. On Oct 20 I turned the app off (cannot uninstall) and contacted Kindle Customer Service. The rep was not able to determine that anything was wrong. When the data usage cycle reset on Oct 26, I turned the app back on. By Oct 28, the app has used almost .5 Gb of data in those 3 days. I submitted a report to Kindle CS through the apps feedback link and today called them again to try to trouble shoot. Went through 2 reps who said they could determine nothing was wrong and then the call was disconnected. It took so long to do this, I didn't want to bother calling back. But, certainly, on this device the app is now completely useless.
B00GD9F59S|5.0|I was sooo happy on how this series ended, yes it is sad it's over but, it ended so awesome. it blew my mind, this series is incredible I love it, jeez it was really great. then end of other great series what ever am I going to do now, You Missy, Jennifer Armentrout , are a terrific author and I enjoy your books and your writing its incredible. I LOVED THIS BOOK, GET IT OR DIE!!!
B00BAXFDLM|5.0|This is a fresh and well-written novel -- immensely absorbing and building to an incredibly tense climax. The AI protagonist has a believably inhuman viewpoint yet is still very compelling. The political intrigue is balanced with action and worldbuilding in a very satisfying way. I'm glad there will be sequels!
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This is a great story in general, and I enjoyed it. But I was not a literary classic.  I found the characters to be predictable.  Still liked the story line.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love playing it right before bedtime. If my Hubby is already a sleep before I get settled in to bed, I turn on my Kindle Fire and play a few rounds.
B005DJREGQ|1.0|It's just another teenage show about trivial high school drama and meaningless sexual encounters! So I really don't give it a &#34;star&#34; at all!
B00G32OER4|1.0|You can't be high enough to enjoy this movie.  There you go.  Just echoing the other 1 stars for the same reasons.  Between Hollywood's mission to churn out the mediocre and Activision slopping out another COD this is what we're left with.  An uneasy feeling emerges when you press the purchase button thinking \\"What crap did I just pay $4.99 for and am I going to have to sit through this for the next 2 hours of my life that I won't ever get back?\\"
B007Q35PLI|4.0|I would have given 5 stars but Claire Danes is far too cute to play the part of an amazing woman who has change our lives but was a pain in the whatever for those who dared say no to his genius. Pretty women often do not get taken seriously but given Temple was autistic and plain ( I mean not Hollywood material) she had to be bull headed to succeed. Indeed her story is more than being autistic as there are many who can amaze but she is in a class of her own.<br />The movie suffers from the same problems as Boys Don't Cry, the actors chosen are so darn cute that you could never imagine saying no or harming them. However, the reality is different and given all the pampering and primping of Hollywood actors I'm not sure how one gets around this.<br />Saying that I loved the editing and use of diagrams to show how Temple saw things differently.
B00000425L|5.0|When it comes to the Rachmaninov preludes I always return to Ashkenazy's versions. His is not the only way to approach this music, but at least I feel that these guiding idea behind these interpretation was to search for a sense of authenticity, an attempt to uncover the real \\"nature\\" of these masterpieces rather than viewing them as vehicles for the performers own ideas. I know that, in the end, this description probably doesn't really make much sense, but that is the reaction Ashkenazy's playing elicits, at least on a phenomenological level, in this listener. There is plenty of emotion, plenty of color and shade, atmosphere and barnstorming ferocity here, heart-aching sorrow and deep meditation, but Ashkenazy convinces us (at least me) that these are elements of the music itself rather than something he imposes on it. Maybe a better and more accurate way of putting it is that - despite insights and fascinating solutions provided in other performances - I have found and continue to find Ashkenazy's way with the preludes probably more satisfying than anyone else's.<br /><br />The same goes for the second sonata, though here the competition is of course even fiercer (though of course there are different versions to choose between). Again, I find Ashkenazy's account deeply convincing - staggering in its darkness, substance and depth of feeling - though there may be moments where his playing is a bit on the safe side - not routine or lacking in any of the features mentioned, but just a little bit predictable. But it really isn't a serious complaint, and overall these performances are must-have for anyone with an interest in the composer's music.
0385537131|5.0|I am a Grisham fan.  Have been for a number of years.  I have not liked all of his books equally, but I love the way he writes.  He brings the pages alive for me, without going overboard describing every little thing.  When I read Grisham's books, I can picture everything and feel like I'm seeing the story through his eyes.<br /><br />Sycamore Row was a very enjoyable read. I was hooked from the beginning and enjoyed reading every page.  I thought the pace of the book was maintained throughout.  There was not a rush to end the story.  Just a continued telling of the story.  The characters were great... even those I didn't like.  He really captures what makes the characters believable and interesting.  I think I may have met some of these folks in my lifetime.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Really like the challenges.  Lots of puzzles to solve.  Keeps you thinking.  This is played on a Kindle Fire, first edition.  Takes a half an hour to download.  When trying to open, it eventually goes to the carousal.  Finally got to the game.  When the first level is done and continue is clicked, takes me back to the carousal again.  Finally hard booted and was able to continue.  When you quit and come back, I have to keep hard booting to get the game to continue.  So, great game,  minus a star for length of time to download and for game to load.
B00005221M|5.0|One of my favorite stories and Daniel Day Lewis makes it that much better.  Worth every penny.  The music is awesome when played on surround sound
B006AN78XS|3.0|Cute blast from the past.  Entertaining movie.  The clothes are so much fun to look at. Kathy Bates has only a bit part and not memorable, so don't get too excited about seeing the old gal in this one.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|So interesting and powerful! You root for her all the way and her father makes you want to be better. Hope she writes another book!
B004GIV0QK|4.0|Sweet old fashioned fantasy.  Both characters are believable and so innocent.  I appreciate the beauty and simplicity of this film.  Jeff Bridges was just becoming a polished actor at this point and you could tell where he was headed.  A sweet love story for all.
0920668372|5.0|I bought this so I could, and I do, enjoy reading it to my grandson! It was one of the first books my son learned to read and its a tear jerker too
B00F35BV64|5.0|Someone truly loved the original Star Trek characters to seek out these young actors who portray the gang beautifully.  Trekkies must be proud!  Lots of special effects, but most importantly, the dialog, the humor and the love the crew has for one another.  I will watch this one yearly.
B00DCX08MW|4.0|Fun game to play with, easy to play and control and graphic good many setting options love it very much
B007WPM7SO|3.0|Not the best of period pieces, but enjoyable enough to spend time watching.  Brace yourself for some gorey battle scenes.  Tragedy strikes throughout the entire movie.
B00A9ET4MC|4.0|Interesting<br />Great writer<br />Read all her books<br />Had great book club discussion about this book<br />Rather wordy<br />Looking forward yo next book
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|it fun time passer for ages 2-200 really fun. I learner it from my 7 year old brother I just wish it saws free but .99? worth it..definetlyy
1936891026|5.0|the book had a lot of information that struck a nerve.  You always knew that resistance was a part of our lives but Steven made it make sense.  Re reading it now and marking my favorite &#34;AH HA&#34; moments.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Excellent! The story grabs my attention and keeps it. I don't want to put it down. Can't wait for the next in series.
B0064MGU98|5.0|The show is very good. Its addicting.  You watch one episode and realize you have been there for hours watching show after show. :)
B00BD99JMW|5.0|It isn't what I pictured for the wrap up of divergent but I loved it. The characters face some huge obstacles in this final book but I couldn't help but kind of shake my head yes. When it is over you feel closure and healing and happiness. Keep an open mind and enjoy.
B00F8MIIKO|1.0|The movie stops working after 15 min!  We've tried it many times and still stops at the same place!  My kids were so bummed, :(
B000O8OTNC|5.0|It worked great. I sharpen my knives in just a very short time.  It's very easy to carry with you in case you have an emergency and need to sharpen your knife.:
B006TF6WAM|5.0|Love the way the story twists and turns slowly getting the plot to a place where you can't put the book down for fear you might miss part of the journey. I feel like I know Harold Fry personally!!
B001NLL93W|5.0|These books and cast of characters suck you in, its very well written.  My hats off to Cassandra Clare she has a remarkable imagination that easily translates into written word.  I found myself ending one book and jumping into the next immediately, so addictive.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have Candy Crush on my cell phone and was very happy to see it as an Amazon app.  Waiting now for more games to move over.
B001QFYCZM|5.0|A WONDERFUL CLASSIC THIS SHOWS HOW  FILMS LIKE THIS BECOMES A LIFE LONG CLASSIC NO SHOOT OUT BLOW UPS - BUILDINGS TUMBLING DOWN - BODIES JUMPING UP AND DOWN  - CAR CHASES -AND ALSO WONDERFUL ON BLU RAY THANK YOU AMAZON<br /><br />LIZA DELLA REESE
B000HKYOK0|5.0|If you're a Trekkie, you don't need an explanation.  If you're not, you should just try a couple of the originals and see what you've missed.
B00G456S38|1.0|Ive watched shows by and like Wheadon as much as the next guy. This show is BAD.<br /><br />No one wanted this show... people wanted Hawkeye and Fury and bad-ass grizzled veterans of Shield who kick ass on a daily basis. Instead we got 20-something wet behind the ears kids who are for some reason... trusted with the most important missions of SHIELD. Its kind of like if you smashed Warehouse 13 and Dollhouse together and took out all of the good qualities.<br /><br />That being said, no one turned into a newt and made babies... or double-keyboard hacked. Yet
B000I8G5GW|5.0|This movie is a classic, not only for the superb acting, but also for the direction, screenwriting, and cinematography.  It is a movie that should be on everyone's bucket list.  Holden and Sir Alec Guinness are wonderful - perhaps the best film of their careers. This is a must-see.  It will not disappoint.<br /><br />kone
B008S2BZ10|5.0|Does this really need a review? It's The Terminator. Not as good as the sequel, but it's up there. Watch it.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|its a great program and it works well I love it wakes me up every morning<br /> `1 2 3 4
B003B02O3C|5.0|This was by far the most difficult book to put down. It held my interest from the very chapter to the last.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Nice,  clean,  easy-to-use tool.  Thank you,  KS Mobile.  I especially like the way it helps with cashe cleanup and separates the more important ones out to the advanced functions.  This helps from making a big mistake.
B00BVYNSLC|4.0|This show is good.  Tatiana does a great job at playing multiple characters. If you're into Sci Fi - give it a shot.
B008RA3X5E|1.0|Totally crashed my kindle. Had to remove it and go back to the free version. Hated this app. if you're going to get it, get the free version only.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|This book is one I couldn't put down - I started reading it and became mesmerized by the beautiful romance that Rainbow Rowell slowly revealed, layer upon layer of love and attraction and all of it flowing naturally through the dual narrative,the two alternating perspectives of Eleanor and Park. A true love story, with all the tension and heartache that we so often associate with teenage, puppy-dog love. This story offers a raw and fresh take on that love, and imbues it with a new sense of longing, attraction, and need.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Easy to use and any version you want. This is my pick for a Bible app. Also any font you need to be able to read without straining.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This fractured tale captures you and doesn't let go, page after page of intricate descriptions of a black and white wonderland, where nothing and no one is as they seems. A delightful fantasy world that  I thoroughly enjoyed escaping into, and exploring alongside the captivating characters. Truly magical.
B008YRVW0I|4.0|quite costly for a game but its Mindanao worth the money Cu's if you buy regular video games they're roughly 6o bums compared to this for 4.99
B0035QUXWQ|5.0|Favorite movie. Pop it in any day of the week it never gets old. Life's like a box of chocolates you never know what you going to get.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I loved the back and forth in the story.  It reminded me of Lawrence Sanders novels.  The ending was a bit disappointing.  Overall good read!
B002SJIO5E|5.0|Super Effects, very believable. I liked the Docu-Story telling way that it's presented. The Prawns are creepy and totally realistic.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|This is a wonderful watch, especially for the price. It has a unique style, is comfortable to wear and not overbearing in size. I also received the watch a day sooner than expected via standard shipping.
B000V4UFZK|5.0|We bought this DVD for our minivan.  My kids, believe it or not, love this movie.  I do too.  I think it is just the right amount of scary.  Classic.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|i like so much this game i spend so much time playing candy crush i  am addictive to this game
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very happy to finally be able to play this on my Kindle!!!!! LOVE the game, I have to laugh at myself spending hours on a game at 60 years old!
B00FAIPDAE|5.0|Its a game that takes time so if you don't have the time just don't get it if you do you will love it great game.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Such a good book. I could not put it down. A lot of tears. Definitely an eye opener and a good read:)
B000V8I2QU|4.0|This has always been one of my favorite Springsteen albums. Sure, it doesn't stray too far from his roots or reinvent his sound but instead it finds him focusing on his strengths as a songwriter. The energy of his older records is here along with a newfound maturity and reflection that has permeated his work over the past decade. The hooks are here in full force, from the bombastic rock of \\"Radio Nowhere\\" and \\"You'll Be Coming Down\\" to the sombre ballads of \\"Terry's Song\\" and the folksy title track. Some of the album's best moments come in the more tender numbers, mainly \\"I'll Work for Your Love\\" and \\"Girls in Their Summer Clothes\\", whose bright melodies betray the more serious and thoughtful lyrics. Just about every track on Magic works and has something enjoyable that I can come back to for repeated listens. I'm not a fan of Springsteen's politics but those are easy to overlook when the music is this strong and the record is this tightly focused. The political overtones are just vague enough that you could easily apply to them to the present day or any time in the past. That kind of songwriting is smart and helps a record like this one avoid being pigeonholed in the past.<br /><br />However, the album stumbles in the sound department. Countless reviewers have already lamented the over-compressed and painful levels on this release so I won't waste time reiterating those points. Older Springsteen albums like Born in the U.S.A., The Rising, and Darkness on the Edge of Town were able to conjure up big rock sounds without sacrificing dynamic range; unfortunately this release will give you some ear fatigue by the end. The album overall is one of my favorites but the poor sound keeps it from being all it could have been. Put that aside and you have one of Bruce's most consistent and fun albums to date.
B0090P98Z4|2.0|Because this app allways give me trouble, Like I could been playing this game for a while . Than when i came back to it oneday it took me back to the first level more than one time. Also pushaches tokens it sub. from my accont more than one time an i did,t recieve the tokens. Other than that I loved this game but come on who,s to go back to level one when you was all ready past  in to the third game . Capital TROUBLE .
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Well written didn't think I would like this book but it turned out to be a good book and leaving you hanging at the end is great, makes you want to run out and buy the other books.
B008ALA6DW|4.0|I wish Apple included one of these by default with my Macbook Retina, as the laptop itself is not the cheapest on the market. If you need wired Ethernet though, this is exactly what you want. Works flawlessly with no configuration needed on both Mac OSX and Linux, just like you would expect from a regular Ethernet port.
B009949RKC|4.0|Enjoyed the book and the movie all those years ago and the movie is just as good now.  It still spooked me and made me jump at the end even knowing what was happening.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Now this was a super book! It was fascinating to see how it all came about from a guy who was there. Also interesting was getting an understanding on how our government vets these actions.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Works well for Youtube and Netflix but not good for Chrome browser. It slows down the streaming considerably. Product needs improvements.
B005COO1X6|2.0|Much as I love, love SK, this story is just ok.  I was disappointed at its length.  Just as you're getting into it, it's over.  I am used to SK's lengthy novels and lengthy 'short stories' that you can sink your teeth into.  This one felt incomplete.  This story did not build, it felt like a bit of a sell out and I think I will stick to novels in the future.
B000PVAFT0|5.0|Great color, entertaining, suspenseful and educational. The student's eyes never left the screen! Though it is G rated I would not show it to younger children.
B0000028M7|5.0|I love everything Alice in Chains (with L.Staley) has ever put out. This album was mostly written by Staley, and is about his drug use. Still, great album though. His voice and lyrics are very touching and relatable.
B00FPH6AXE|5.0|Will wrote it; it is lush in it's scenery and special effects abound. with the possible exception of the opening narration; intonation of Jaden's voice takes a moment to follow (for me personally) I felt it was a very entertaining and educational movie !  I was shocked to see it seemed to be so poorly received on the big screen; I feel DVD and digital sales and the \\"real public's \\" voice will show otherwise. I highly recommend it. However, you need to focus on it and not allow yourself to be distracted by other things.
1582406723|3.0|The Walking Dead. By now, everybody not living under a rock knows about this series, but I'm still going to give my 2 cents on it. Personally, I find the future volumes to be far superior. Days Gone Bye isn't bad persay, but it seems pitiful if you consider some of the amazing moments in the series. As with most first volumes, volume 1 is mostly establishing the story and characters. (The most important in this volume are Rick, Carl, Lori, Glenn, Andrea, Dale, and Shane).<br /><br />The story begins with Rick waking up from a coma. He eventually runs into a man named Morgan. Rick decides to travel from Kentucky to Atlanta Georgia to find his family. There, he comes across a group of people including his son, Carl and his wife, Lori.<br /><br />One part that I liked the least was the artwork. Tony Moore isn't a bad artist, but the art is a bit too cartoony and stereotypical comic book art-like for a zombie story. Now I know this IS the first volume, but the fact that the characters don't get much development is a con. However, I think that Kirkman succeeded in his goal of setting the story up. The title is \\"Days Gone Bye\\", and this is very fitting because everybody is remembering thier past days, and how the apocalypse makes them realise that they took them for granted, and now that the world's gone to hell, the average person would do anything to have them back.<br /><br />At this stage, the characters are a bit naive, and they thing everything is just going to blow over (especially Shane). This volume has a few character deaths, including a really unexpected one at the end (especially if you've watched the TV show).<br /><br />Overall, this volume has good and bad things about it. It's not bad, but it's not good enough to escape the realms of \\"decentness\\", and that's why it gets 3 stars.
B0036S4B6M|2.0|It's alright, but I thought it would be more exciting. Day to day accounts of prison life is well described.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love minion rush because its about d2 from Xavier to d2 and I love. despicable me 2 and it was funny.  and coooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooool
B003B02PF4|4.0|Better than others I've read by same author.  Good plot and character development.  As usual ending is ambiguous.  A good beach read.
006202406X|5.0|Endings to series are often the most crucial. It needs to fill in all the blanks that were not explained in the previous books. It needs an ending for the main characters and supporting cast that makes it strong and honours all the characters and the lives they lived within the story.<br /><br />Veronica Roth did just that. She explained a lot in the first few chapters and it was a lot to take in, but I think she did a wonderful job. The endings for the all the characters were satisfactory even though some were filled with sorrow. Even with the sadness it did not take away from the main goal of the book, it did not take away from the plot. Many like to compare this series with Hunger Games and I have to say that Roth did a better job at ending her series. It was stronger and more believable. We were given a few chapters to swallow and process everything. I recommend this book to all the fans as well as new readers.<br /><br />Allegiant was filled with adventure, romance, sorrow, and wit. Wonderfully written. I was able to see true sacrifice in action. I enjoyed it a lot, but I am sad that the series is complete.<br /><br />As a writer, I understand Roth's ending for Tris, I often do it for my own characters. It will be hard for readers to completely except it, but I think Roth did her character an honour for ending things the way she did. It was hard to swallow for myself, but once I took myself out of the emotions of the book I was able to see from a plot and storyline view. I can think of no better ending for Tris than the one she got. It is believable and better, I think, than the happy ending that happens in many books that create a false view of heroes - that they always survive. The theme of the series is made complete with the ending. Thanks Veronica Roth for such a fantastic series and I can't wait to see what you come up with next!
B004OR199G|4.0|I like this book a lot. It has a lot of really great and easy to understand nutrition information. She explains things in a sassy, no nonsense kind of way that makes it interesting. Not sure how I feel yet about all the information in the book. I still am doing my research, but it's a good start to getting well informed about my health and diet.
B008JFUNHI|5.0|Enders game did not disappointment me.  The movie was both entertaining and cleverly done.  The special affects made you feel like you were in battle. The action was very fast and the opponents clever.<br /><br />Ender Wiggins is a military genius trained to defeat the buggers.  In the final battle against the bugger world, Wiggins questions the reason the buggers maintain a defensive stance.  Secretly, Bean is feeding Ender the strategies that will help in the final defeat of the buggers.<br /><br />The movie does have a brilliant strategy and a complex character.<br /><br />Ender realizes that he has destroyed a race of intelligent beings.  He realizes that the queen had been trying to communicate with him through a psych game.  Ender remorse the destruction of the buggers and seeks to atone for his actions by helping the bugger seed find a new world to colonize.<br /><br />The federation is very happy to have the buggers destroyed.  They few the buggers as a security threat and feared the buggers would strike again in a moment of weakness.  Survival at any cost was their motto.  Ender had become emperor but leaves for a distant world leaving a power vacuum for his brother Peter to occupy.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|Pleasing little game. Good cartoon graphics. Fun to play. Pretty good game for free. Can't wait to make it all the way thru!
B0000DG00B|5.0|This recording is a true gift and I am very thankful that it exists and available.  What struck me the most about this set is how incredibly superb Gregory (his preference) Allman`s vocals are.  I mean it is mind-blowing how much better they are here over any other recording - including the Fillmore shows.  And it is not just the strength or clarity or placement in the mix - it`s also his phrasing - just heavenly, bluesy, perfection.  I always thought of him as a very good singer - somewhat overshadowed by the instrumental virtuosity of the band - but this album puts him in a class with very few other blues/rock singers.<br /><br />I am not quite sure Greg Allman gets the musical appreciation he deserves.  One thing for sure, anyone who listens to him on these tracks will come away knowing blues vocals just can`t get any better this - no way, no how.  Even when things go south like D. Betts on Stormy Monday playing off key - Allman manages to keep the vocals pitch perfect and right on time.  Wonderful!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Love this game!<br />I hate how it took forever for it to come to the kindle, though. Other than that, it's a fun game.
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|I liked this game very much. It was very interesting and had very good graphics. I think this is a very good game for adults and children.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|Love this series can watch it every day and still get a laugh. Makes me see I am a geek even more.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|It was riveting to watch Piper thrown into what was for her an entirely  &#34;alternate universe&#34; only to overcome desolation and desperation. The community the women created within prison walls was touching, humorous, and reaffirmed the power of the human spirit.
B005VPRG10|5.0|This Lego set is a good size and fun to put together. My husband had it done in a day. Great for a day project.
B00EVW0VTI|4.0|Loved the little girl. Also a decision the President made that was realistic. A lot was improbable, but it was entertaining
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Smart, sexy and fun....Love this show!  Julianna Margolies<br />and Chris Noth do a perfect &#34;marriage in distress&#34; tango!<br />It is a do not miss series!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Not the ending I was hoping for but it makes sense. The theme of the series has always been love and sacrifice.
B00BAXFAOW|3.0|3.5 stars but I couldn't give half stars. As usual, Gladwell tells entertaining stories, but unlike his past books, these do not congeal well into the central premise. I enjoyed it, but by far weaker than his past works.
B008JFUR10|5.0|Giant robots, big monsters, and a satisfying character-driven story on top of it. The human characters steal the show almost as much as the Jaegers and the Kaiju do, and Mako Mori's character arc is emotional and riveting.<br /><br />The best review I've ever seen about this movie sums it up like this:<br /><br />Remember how awesome Godzilla and other monster movies were when you were a kid? There are pleasant happy memories of just how amazing they were. You go back years later and see how cheezy they are and can even be a little disappointed.<br /><br />Pacific Rim is that childhood memory come to life, and even the non-robot and monster lovers among us will find something to love about it.
B005BY3XHC|5.0|It is a book well worth reading. Having finished it, though, I can see that it deserves a second reading. The instructions that are given are simple enough to follow. However, the real challenge will be putting them into practice as part of your life. I believe that for someone to benefit from this book they will need to have an open mind.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|THE BEST BOOK I HAVE READ IN YEARS!!!!!!!!!!!!! I LOVED IT SO MUCH I READ ALL THREE BOOKS AGAIN! I WANT MORE!
B000RLFJQ2|1.0|I started to watch this movie but it is such a lousy movie that I had to stop watching. That was a surprise because I usually like De Niro movies.
B001OKGV6W|5.0|A movie that forces you through a membrane into other ways of thinking, very well done, excelent movie...5 stars, for this 1...
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Doctor Sleep is a great book. Enjoyed it tremendously. I was sorry it ended. Stephen King gets better with every book and I have read all his books.
B00AWFEBDK|2.0|I liked very much guns, germs and steel. This one is not a bad book, but it is not so good and it is little monotonous.
B00ESB6GBY|5.0|Finally building to a finale, the format of this season is a very nice change.  I'm glad we should be getting a satisfying conclusion to this show.
B007MC0IAG|3.0|It's not the best Richard Dawkin's book, but it's ok. I have seen some of the ideas in his previous books. And, I think that I'm older than the target reader.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|This series is amazing. George R R Martin writes in such detail that every page is brought to life. Each chapter tells the story from another characters point of view, so one moment you're reading about Winterfell and the north, the next your half a world away in Kings Landing, but it all ties together so well that you almost wonder why more books aren't written this way. Full of white knuckle moments that will have you riveted to your reader, you won't want to put it down. I can't tell you how many hours of sleep I lost after saying &#34;just one more chapter, then I'll stop.&#34; If you're a fan of medieval drama and fantasy worlds you're in for an excellent read, and this is still an actively produced series, so once you're hooked you'll have something to look forward to.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I just wish she didn't end the book this way. Literally so sad for Tobias and I git so into these books and this is how it ends. This series is still the best I have read so far but I just wish tris and Tobias would have started a life together, it would be such a better ending. I'm still so sad. I cannot get over it
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|I played it then the next day I try to play it and doesn't get past title screen now it's my screen for almost everything don't get this app!!!
B0002KVULG|5.0|XXXXX<br /><br />Most people know the story of Dracula based on the novel \\"Dracula\\" (1897) by Bram Stoker.<br /><br />In this particular movie, much of Stoker's original plot was revised to make the film more romantic.  And what a film!!  This American/British movie is a triumph of:<br /><br />(1) performance<br />(2) art direction<br />(3) atmosphere or mood.<br /><br />Frank Langella as Dracula gives an electrifying performance.  He stalks with the grace of a cat.  And Laurence Olivia (1907 to 1989) is in fine form as Van Helsing, Dracula's nemesis.<br /><br />The background music is just fantastic.  (This is not surprising since the musical score is by the great John Williams.)<br /><br />The special effects were also good for the time.<br /><br />This movie has a tremendous, exciting ending that you've got to see.<br /><br />This film is notable for switching the main female character roles.  (Dracula purists might be shocked by this.)<br /><br />This movie won the 1979 Saturn Award for Best Horror Film.<br /><br />The DVD itself (the one released in 2004) has three extras.<br /><br />Finally, the only problem was that the colour was somewhat washed out.  This is a pity since the sets and costumes are just gorgeous and deserved strong, vibrant colours.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a more romantic version of the story of Dracula with a mesmerizing performance by Frank Langella!!!<br /><br />(1979;  1 hr, 45 min excluding end credits;  wide screen;  18 scenes;  rated 'R')<br /><br />&lt;&lt;Stephen PLETKO, London, Ontario, Canada>><br /><br />XXXXX
0979019710|5.0|I loved this book and after my quick read now need to highlight the keys for me and implement. There is no doubt that using what Hal shares will make a huge difference in my day and therefore my life. Hal has taken the strategies we have heard about doing to be successful, isolated the ones that make the biggest difference, and then packaged them in a truly \\"workable\\" way starting first thing in the morning. Why don't we do all these things? Because we believe we can never fit it all in and quite frankly, were not sure it was even possible. Not anymore! What I loved is, each time an excuse popped into my head of why I might not follow his advice or instruction, he offers a tip or suggestion for getting around my objection (foiled again)! Well worth the read.
B006MW3VGA|5.0|I watched all of season two for free (and in one day) using my Amazon Prime account, and I am really glad that I did!  Season one of Downton Abbey got me hooked, and the second season kept me hooked.  I love the story line, and how it unfolds...  of course, there are a couple of things that bug me, but nothing major.<br /><br />I think that the characters are played pretty well flawlessly.  I would occasionally yell out much-needed advice to them, much to the amusement of my husband.  \\"They can't hear you\\" eventually became \\"Still can't\\" when he realized that I was going to yell things anyway.<br /><br />I was angry when Robert -- feeling lonely and misunderstood -- acted like a big baby, as well as when any character did horrible things (I'm looking at you, Thomas and O'Brien).  I felt sorry for them when things didn't go their way, and their human vulnerability showed (yes, even you, Thomas and O'Brien).  I sighed and \\"oohed and aahed\\" when romance appeared, and I was jealous of Lavinia for Mary.  I could go on... there is something to be said about everyone, but I think you get the picture.  In my opinion, the show is written very well and the characters are developing very well, though not always in the directions one might like.<br /><br />Are some parts predictable?  Yes.  Are some parts kind of cliche?  Sure.  But, that's all right with me; the good far outweighs the bad.<br /><br />Of course, I had a couple of minor issues.  First, I almost hate to say this, but I felt that Cora kind of started to sound a bit like Carol Channing.  I know that she is supposed to be patient and loving, but that voice change got on my nerves a little.  Also, what the heck is going on with Bates?  He's like a false-accusation magnet!  Good grief... I hope it all works out for Anna and him, but also hope that things don't get too drawn out.<br /><br />Neither of these minor issues affected my enjoyment of the show in the least.  I really did love watching this season, as well asthe third, and now can't wait for the fourth!  Recommended!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|As usual Steven King keeps you guessing ...and trying to remember certain events in &#34;The Shinning&#34; He is a brilliant writer of the &#34;spooky-stuff&#34;.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|I love this show! So happy to hear there's 2 more seasons scheduled. (Even though it was originally written to be 5 seasons)
B0071AKB38|3.0|This is an ok speaker, but it is over priced. The sound isn't all that great. You have to keep the volume down low or else the speaker sounds like it is going to blow.
B000075BFK|5.0|Awesome cd
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Held my attention til the very end!  Well-developed characters.  The kind of story that you wonder what you would do in the characters' places.  Excellent read!!  Would read this author again.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Good mix of old school games like galaga asteroids space invaders all mixed in to one  plus easy to use on the tablet
B00E0SX118|5.0|very good movie, not only did the kids enjoy it, our entire family enjoyed it too! very funny loved the grand ma
B003Z0BWRM|3.0|I only read the book because my bookclub read it. I did enjoy the story and will push on with the next one hoping it might be a little better.<br />I found Clary to be really annoying and i could see the whole possessive Edward/Bella relationship pain all over again between her and Jace. And then the whole brother/sister thing made me really uncomfortable to read about but i googled to see if they really were or not.<br />The book was ok but don't spoil it by watching the movie.
B005FPT51K|4.0|Ok so let me start by saying we have yet to have the baby this was purchased for. Out of the box, installation was a breeze, so I do not know what all the complaints were about it being difficult, it is literally 4 steps. I will say that the one thin that has kept me from going this a 5 star rating is that the unit does not have an independent power supply. If you have an old home like I do (built in 1894) outlets are few and far between so this will require some creative wiring to be in a position to see my son in his crib.
B00CATSONE|4.0|The book is well researched and the style makes good reading. The significance of his genius emerges clearly. His  courage to carry on despite setbacks and his persistence to pursue his vision is highly motivating. A truly remarkable man. Worthwhile book. PS They found the Black Arrow, but not Tesla's black box that gave it 90 mph in 1934.
B004J4WLB4|3.0|I love San Francisco.  Diffenbaugh's interesting take on a young girl's struggles and her powerful being is like so many young girls in America now, even if they don't grow up socially distressed they can and often do remain very spirited and dedicated to being themselves.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game. It is fun and challenging. Wish add ons were not so expensive though. But all in all better than Temple Run
B0075PYG1M|5.0|This is such a great album! I love the fact that Robert Glasper has taken the classical greatness of jazz piano and mixed it with what we hear in mainstream R & B music. The clash sounds amazing! This could even surpass the smoothness heard in Alicia Keys's sound.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's lots of fun.it can also drive you crazy. Love the fish.my daughter told me how much fun it is. We finally agree on something
B001GA1RFA|3.0|I am a huge fan of John Green, and this book was cute, but underwhelming for me.  It's a quick read, and I'm not mad I read it, but the characters just weren't as compelling as other characters Green has created.
B007ZI06FE|5.0|Passionate with skillful storytelling skill, Bec's first book in this series is a triumph and a must-read for any steam(y)-punk fan.  Blistering love scenes! Tension is built with agonizing and delicious slowness.  The eventual culmination of it was handled with consideration that those who had longed for it would not be sated by the duration of it, and therefore were granted multiple pleasurable returns from their first surrender.  If it were not written in that way it would have been to sadistic. :)  Because reading up to a love scene, your eyes reading are scanning words faster and faster trying to take it all in which renders a love scene short.  But it was well drawn out, I thought, and satisfying.  Would have liked to see a bit more detail of gadgetry used and explained since this is a steampunk genre.  Other than that, no complaints at all.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I wanted to continue reading and didn't  want to put the book down.  Can't wait to get the third book.
B003M731UE|5.0|Anything I can think of saying has been said in the positive reviews already posted for “Sons of Anarchy.” This production has elicited every emotion I’m capable of, and some emotions I’ve kept locked up for years. I’m not sure why I chose to watch the show this weekend, but I’m glad that I did. What a wonderfully written, acted, produced show! No fluff, just pure life at its best and its worst. Somebody put great effort into this masterpiece, and I’m grateful for that effort. Excellent work! I hope they just keep this great stuff coming!
B00BAXFAOW|3.0|Book rambled throughout and then ended with no fanfare!  I've read all his other books and this was clearly not his best.
B00B1EEKM8|1.0|Well, it seems like I ordered the wrong version of this re-release.  I see now that there is a 3D Blue Ray, which is what I had wanted.  But I had high hopes for this re-release since it had been recently been remastered and released in 3D on the big screen.  Unfortunately, this movie was grainy and the sound was awful.  I plan to return this version, definitely not worth almost $18!!  In fact, I later rented Jurassic Park 3 (on a Sam Neill kick) on VIdeo on Demand, not even the HD version, and the picture and sound were much better.  I wish that Amazon would not use reviews for the same movie all across the board for the various versions.  It gets very confusing!
B007M45PMU|5.0|great album and a great folk music artist. Everyone should get this album if they are a fan of folk music.
B00F91SCXC|5.0|I've been waiting for an intense horror movie for awhile.  What it lacks in the horror department (the zombies are creepy and scary, but there isn't enough zombie killing in this version) it makes up for in action.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I have mixed emotions about this book. I won't post any spoilers but the Part I initially pissed me off and I was like why should continue reading this, then Part 2 totally threw me for a loop and I couldn't put the book down from there. Part 3 totally let me down. I kept waiting for this wonderful ending and it just never came. The ending left totally underwhelmed. There are parts when I hated Nick then I hated Amy and by the end I really hated them both, probably the author's goal. Even with the disappointing conclusion the writing was wonderful and the story kept you engaged until the last page. I'd definitely read more of this author's work.
0446677450|5.0|Excellent teacher on finance. Something everyone interested or concerned about their financial future in overcoming the straines of the soon coming economic woes.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Sometimes I find this too intense (ok, scary) to watch alone at night!  I love it though.  I like the long term characters and am hoping they stay around.  I would recommend highly.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|Great book!!!! Highly recommended...suspenseful and thrilling, loving and emotional!!!! Couldn't put this book down..hope the movie is just as good!
B003NS2T9G|5.0|The Torchwood series was interesting and fun. The story lines were engaging, and the ensemble of actors pulled us into the drama. It was an enjoyable series of television, and I hated to see it end.
B003G4W49C|5.0|... I just finished this book and its one of those books, that when it's over it leaves you sitting there unsure of what to do with to our life. I can't recommend it enough for you.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Normally I do not watch this type of program as I tend to lump it all in with the 'Law and Order' type schlock that is now being purveyed. L&O was very good in the first few years but I haven't watched it in about the last ten. I decided to give The Good Wife a try basically because I knew it was still running on prime time (ie more than two seasons and hadn't been axed). To say I made a marathon out of the first season would be an understatement! Can't go wrong with a program produced by Ridley and Tony Scott. It is well-cast, the scripts are well-written and believable, and it doesn't drag on endlessly. Julianna Margulies finally LAUGHS in something she is in, which is nice because her laugh sounds genuine. I'm already into Season Two and haven't been disappointed yet!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Outstanding,it keeps you on the edge of your seat,  I would loose track of time reading it.<br /><br />And with my kindle fire H D it would read it to you.<br />Can't wait for the next book
B001H1SVO8|2.0|A fairly ridiculous plot, starting no where, and going nowhere. Interesting surprise towards the climax but at that point I just wanted everyone to die anyway. Although the acting performances are excellent, this film is very overrated.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|I love this show! The acting is superb, the writing is phenomenal...everything about it is top notch! My entire family is in the legal field and we all are huge fans. So refreshing to have a show that actually does its research on the storylines. I find that they stay very true (mostly) to the law and courtroom procedure....with a little creative license thrown in for tension. All I can say is....More, Please!
B00BAXFECK|5.0|I would say 4.7, but din't know how to do that.  It was a long page turner and I wanted it to keep going, loved all the characters.  My only complaint, more selfish, is I wanted to see how the key people turned out, maybe not all the way but at least a few more conversations at the end. Why did Pippa never acknowledge that she saw Theo in the museum or what his Mom said about the painting, etc?
B0060D3BWK|5.0|I love this movie,  I watched it every year since I was 5 xD all l have to do is get the sound track to and my childhood Halloween dreams are complete
B001C46P2K|5.0|This movie has become one of my favorites! Emily blunt does a supurb performance as a young queen coming into her own. The courtship between Victoria & Albert is beautifully done and continues even beyond their wedding. You can see how two people have truly become one in the way they learn to govern a tumultuous England together. No nudity, foul language or unnecessary violence (someone does pull our a gun in an assassination attempt)
B00COO2D6O|4.0|Great game for a tower defense game.  Love the accuracy in towers.  Look forward to next in series.  Will buy it too.
B004EPYZZI|5.0|Excellent family movie! Great message of perseverence and how her faith in God heals her physically and spiritually. Shark scene is not graphic.
1476733953|3.0|I came away from reading this book disappointed because of the high reviews.  I found it lacking complexity, characters were pretty one-dimensional, the dialogue was pretty bad and quite a lot of holes in the story. It doesn't help that this story has been done so many times before and by much better writers like Philip K Dick.<br /><br />And for the love of god, do not, absolutely do not, purchase the audible version, the female reader was excruciating to listen to, whispering so low at times you couldn't hear her.  Her dialects aren't very good, especially when she goes into her grade-school evil voice for the villains and silly child voices.  Please, lose the sinister voice, we know Bernard is a bad guy, we're not children.  I honestly may have liked this book better if I had just read it and not listened to it on Audible.<br /><br />I'm going to try the next book, maybe I was annoyed with the reader and missed something, but I doubt it.  Just very let-down after reading all the glowing reviews, I can only assume that a bunch of tweener fans latched on to this book and gave it such viral and undeserved high reviews, a master piece, this is not.

B00FEHXISA|5.0|It had great special effects and was funny. My 7 year old boys really enjoyed the movie and gave it five stars.
B0091REZMW|3.0|This is a fun game but can only be played a little at a time because the diamonds and energy run out quickly. Graphics and sound are great but have to pay to continue the game.
B00B19H2KU|5.0|I am not sure how we missed this movie when it was released last year but we thought we would give it a try and wow, this is one of the scariest/creepy movies we have seen in a long time. Definitely worth the watch!
B00FEJIVRQ|5.0|A great second sequel! Once again Robert Downey Jr. delivers a great performance. The Iron Man saga is a great hero's tale.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|A model of how to live your life by finding out what is and what is not important. I loved how each person Harold met on his pilgrimage taught him a lesson in his life and the impact he had on others.. As so often happens, we do not know how we may have made a difference in someone's life, but hopefully we have behaved in a way that may have had an impact on others.What a great gift that would be.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Greatest ending ever!!!! It is worth every penny.The only  thing is its so stinkin depressing, that at some times i it, you will want to cry.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|A lot of fun. You get better every time you play.  Reminded me of video games I played a long time ago
B009G41CG2|5.0|I love this game. Cool and a good time passing pleasure to play. If you have not played,try it you might like it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally can play on my kindle fire I do not have to get onto a computer. Fun and challenging game.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|This movie will change the way you look at the food on your plate. It is an incredibly eye-opening view into the giant food producing industry in the United States today, and how it has changed in the last fifty years or so. I had no idea that most of our food production is controlled by mega corporations who only care about more and cheaper, and of course, profit! I was glued to the screen all the way through this movie. Watch. This. Movie! It may help you make wiser choices three times a day. Excellent!
B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|I enjoyed the book it was fast reading keep my attention. It will be nice to read more. I was able to see in David's mind and heart
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|I had only read the first sentence when I began to empathize with the protagonist.<br /><br />“Nobody came to my seventh birthday party.”<br /><br />Why had no one gone to his birthday party? Was he new to the area? Was he shy? Was he a social outcast because he was somehow different? What was it?  I recalled the times in my childhood where I’d felt out-of-place, a little misfit. Neil Gaiman does a remarkable job of stirring those childhood memories to create a connection with the reader.<br /><br />“Childhood memories are sometimes covered and obscured beneath the things that come later, like childhood toys forgotten at the bottom of a crammed adult closet, but they are never lost for good.”<br /><br />This story will take you back to your childhood as quickly as the aroma of your mother’s homemade Christmas cookies wafting through the air. Only, it isn’t the pleasant memories that come to mind. You will recall the times you heard or saw things that weren’t evident to adults.<br /><br />“Adults follow paths. Children explore. Adults are content to walk the same way, hundreds of times, or thousands; perhaps it never occurs to adults to step off the paths, to creep beneath rhododendrons, to find the spaces between fences. I was a child, which meant that I knew a dozen different ways of getting out of our property and into the lane, ways that would not involve walking down our drive.”<br /><br />I often wonder if, as a child, I was more in tune with the metaphysical world, with the unexplained, the things that go bump in the night. It was the time before I learned to put the world in a neat little box where every odd occurrence could be reasoned with a logical explanation. What about the toy that begins to play in the middle of the night? Oh it’s just a malfunction in the mechanism. What about the trinket that falls off the shelf? Surely it had been accidentally shifted by a person’s touch during the day and finally succumbed to gravity. What was the flash of light across the bedroom wall? Oh, it was the reflection of a passing car. What was the shadow you saw in your peripheral vision? Well, of course it was just your imagination.<br /><br />“I saw the world I had walked since my birth, and I understood how fragile it was, that the reality was a thin layer of icing on a great dark birthday cake writhing with grubs and nightmares and hunger.”<br /><br />Reading this book will cause you to relive that paralyzing childhood fear when you were certain something was lurking under your bed or in your closet, but somehow hiding under your covers provided a magical layer of protection from anything sinister. You will believe that there are invisible forces at work. While evil lurks in the shadows, there is a benevolent force, like Lettie, that will cover you like that warm blanket from childhood. And quite possibly you will wonder if there really is an ocean at the end of the lane.<br /><br />Memorable quotes:<br /><br />“It’s hard enough being alive, trying to survive in the world and find your place in it, to do the things you need to do to get by, without wondering if the thing you just did, whatever it was, was worth someone having…if not died, then having given up her life.”<br /><br />“How can you be happy in this world? You have a hole in your heart. You have a gateway inside you to lands beyond the world you know. They will call you, as you grow.”
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|The game is ok. But the music is nerve racking.  If you can't finish a game  you have to wait to play on or buy time. I DON'T like the way it makes me frustrated.

B008RA3X5E|5.0|Great app. Love the look of it and it works great. If you want a new clock that is nice looking and easy to use you will like this one.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|It came to me from someone special. That is why. This is the kind of knowledge should be spread through every one. Good vibs are exceptional and unique to make our dreams come true. No dude!
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|I personally think that is better than Season One. I like the action in it and I do feel that it is part of the show. I have read reviews by the Damian Lewis that he thought Season One was better. He is entitled to his opinion. I don't want to spoil the show for there are many spoiler alerts, not just the end, which you would expect. Buy it; enjoy it!

B00EAI94AA|4.0|As a rabid fan of Twilight Series, Blade, & Underworld, this is going to make a great edition to my Vamp collection!
B000AOEMXM|4.0|For one reason or another, I ended up sitting this series out when it aired but heard much of what the Trek fandom establishment had to sat about it and thus didn't hurry to catch up.<br /><br />I recently had the opportunity to watch the entire series over a few days and was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />I understand that there is the whole issue unmentioned alien races and major historical events in supposedly later series and that would be a problem for an obsessive Trek historian.<br /><br />Here are some of the things I really liked about this series that was missing from earlier Star Trek series.<br /><br />1. We get to see a lot of how people on Earth are reacting to this voyage and the captain and crew are all pretty big celebrities. The voyage isn't taking place in a social vacuum.<br /><br />2. They make a lot of mistakes that are not reconciled or fixed in some way. For instance accidentally wiping out the population of a whole planet or screwing with the social system of a tri-sexual race who were clearly far advanced from them. That kind of stuff is very credible.<br /><br />3. For most of the series the Vulcans are the bad guys. Seeing them as less than perfect was refreshing and, frankly, very believable.<br /><br />4. There was a strong story arc that runs throughout the whole series, particularly in season 3.<br /><br />5. The Andorians. Interesting folk. They have been in the Trek universe from the beginning. Why are we getting to know them at this late date? Also, the Klingons are quite interesting at this point in history before they were at total odds with humanity. This series shows relations with them starting on a good note.<br /><br />6. T'pol's incredibly screwed up psyche. It us hard to imagine how the Vulcan High Command would allow someone as sensitive as her to rise to the position she attained and trusted her to keep an eye on the humans. She would crack under pressures that merely half-Vulcan Mr. Spock would have dealt with easily.I sort of enjoyed her regular meltdowns. Also, of course, she was played by arguably the hottest woman to ever be a major character in Star Trek history and that is against some reasonably stiff competition. The producers made sure there were plenty of excuses to show her in her underwear too. A-plus for that.<br /><br />There were horrible blunders also. It was a *HUGE* mistake to do Borg and Ferengi stories. It just requires too much contextual suspension of disbelief. I would recommend just bypassing those episodes. Also there was no context for the Mirror Universe&#34; story, no excuse for why we were seeing it.<br /><br />Even with those flaws, I think it compares quite favorably with other Star Trek series. Way better thought out that the original series. Less confusing than Voyager. I even like it better than DS9.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I think the game is fun to play. But some level are very difficult to understand if not important to pass.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I kept waiting for this one to get scary.  It's more a war between good and evil, much more on the order of The Stand rather than The Shining.  I did enjoy it once Danny got his life together.

B00D6DVSAE|5.0|I have always liked Sting and his band The Police.  This is something very different than his past recordings and I was VERY pleasantly surprised.

0385351399|5.0|Ranks among 1984 and Fahrenheit 451. With better and more publicity could be #1 on The NYTs best seller list --for the next 268 weeks. Found the theses perversely profound and apt commentary on today's mores.
0786958731|3.0|Disappointing. Not needing a DM is good, but the constant respawing of monsters eliminates the feel of exploration i want from a D&D game.
B009NF54ZE|5.0|A great hidden object game with variations that keep it interesting. Live the zoom feature. The storyline is intriguing and what convinced me to purchase the 2nd one.
B00GD9F59S|5.0|Although it was sad to see this series come to an end let me just say....WOW that was a great way to finish and wasn't the<br />ending that I was expecting but I was very happy with how it ended. Ok so on to more important things like the perfection that is my book boyfriend Aiden...Yeah what can I say about him besides the fact that he is just amazing,hotter than then Hades and makes me want to swoon with the romantic things he says to Alex...so yeah he is perfect. As for Alex she is a great example of a strong heroine and just all out kicks ass on a daily basis and gets the hard stuff done, while also adding her. famous Alex snark into the mix. Heck I even forgave Seth for the master level of douche that he was in the last book ....so all in  all this book just awesome and if you have read the other four trust me when I say it is worth the money to finish this series. Plus who in their right mind  would turn down more Alex and  Aiden time lol

I just read some of the comments and was confused, I have never had a problem with this either app.<br /><br />On the chance that these problems are recent occurrences, I just  played offline to see for myself. Not one problem, as I expected.<br /><br />I should mention, I don't usually purchase apps but after playing the free version I was hooked after one day. Definitely glad my husband suggested I try it out.<br /><br />Great job developers

B00EH0K9IM|5.0|All the possible playback issues are with the 1st run of Blu-Ray versions lack of compatibility with some brands of North American players. The DVD version has no playback problems at all. This isn't clear as the Blu-Ray reviews get lumped in with the DVD as well.<br /><br />As far as the show goes, expect a great audio mix and additional songs from each member's non Flying Colors releases. All in all, it's a fun show with the fine songwriting and musicianship you expect from these talented guys.

B00E0SX118|5.0|The movie was cute hilarious and very kid friendly.  My kids loved it all 7 times we watched it.  This was a good purchase.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This a very engaging story. It has lots or twists and turns and kept me on the edge of my chair from the first page to the last.
0316204366|1.0|Too subjective and one-sided. Too many topics are not underdogs, etc. such as class room size. But the worst is his assertion that criminals are a product of their environment and not their fault and strict enforcement of the law is wrong. The book's message is challenge authority, not think about our assumptions.<br /><br />Much of the book focuses on an argument that there is an optimum classroom size and that neither too large nor too small a classroom is good. That's great, but what has that got to do with underdogs and giants?<br /><br />His &#34;study&#34; of crime is extremely limited. The examples are interesting, but certainly not conclusive nor extensive enough to draw his conclusions. There are too selective to support his argument and there is too much crime today, to imply that social programs alone can solve the problem, or that authority has it all wrong.<br /><br />Gladwell is an excellent story teller. The book is entertaining. But it lacks the insight from Blink and Tipping Point. In fact, it is uninspiring and is more of a &#34;Challenge Authority&#34; chant, than anything truly thought provoking.
0374533555|5.0|I've not finished reading this book, but I have learned so much from it already. It requires a bit of deep thinking to assimilate the information so it is a slow read for me. But a terrific source of information on how the brain makes judgements and decisions.
B009APMNB0|4.0|I am a part-time freelance professional photographer and take color calibration very seriously. My color calibration and workflow starts with proper white balance at the camera all the way through to profiling my workflow with the specific printer of my lab. I found this product to be OK, at best, for enthusiasts (please understand that is just my opinion). However, if you are being paid for your work, are a perfectionist in terms of color output, or if your workflow is critical to you in that wasted time costs you money, I suggest looking elsewhere.<br /><br />My workflow environment (that relates to installing this product) consists of a Dell Windows 7 64 bit machine with 12gb of RAM, an Nvidea GForce with 2 gb RAM, two Dell U2410 IPS monitors, Adobe Lightroom 5 and Photoshop CC. I output to a variety of professional labs including Millers and Mpix. My color calibration tool prior to this product was the [[ASIN:B006TF36TM Datacolor Spyder4Elite S4EL100 Colorimeter for Display Calibration]], which I went back to after trying this product.<br /><br />Prior to install, I restored my monitors to factory default, which I strongly recommend. I also set the lighting in my office at my preferred setting for image editing. I also recommend you tilt your monitor back during the calibration process to ensure you have a flat contact between the monitor and the \\"puck.\\" Also, make sure no direct light is shining on your monitor.  As some other reviewers noted, install did not go smoothly for me either. The entire process seemed to stall. After about 5 minutes, it appeared installed and of course required a reboot. After reboot I ran the program, and like with most other calibration devices, you run through a setup to establish the calibration.  This takes about 7 minutes to achieve what I call basic color calibration. It's straightforward enough. Afterwards, you are presented with a \\"before\\" and \\"after.\\" You will clearly notice a difference.  However, in my experience, I did not like the difference. Simply put, I found the colors a little warm.<br /><br />I must emphasize that this calibration device is fine for enthusiasts/hobbyists and that is who it was made for and the price reflects that fact. The end user will experience an immediate improvement if they used no calibration prior. However, for my particular needs and workflow, I elected to return to my previous product. I found the Spyder much better and accurate when working in the Adobe Gamut and outputting to specific printers at labs.<br /><br />A final note, the only way to accurately test color accuracy is with a final print.  Posting images on the web requires conversion to Srgb profile, which does not test a wide color gamut.t like the difference.

B003O86FMW|5.0|I thought \\"Catching Fire\\", the second book of the Hunger Games trilogy, was excellent in every way.  It had all the suspense, pathos and excitement I could handle and then some!  What an imagination and beautifully flowing style of writing Suzanne Collins has!  I look forward with eager anticipation to reading book three!
B00BC24NT4|4.0|Not Le Carre's strongest work, but eminently readable like all of his writings.  Slow in the beginning, lots of characters, and you don't know which one to latch on to as the main character.  Once the game pieces fall into place, however, this book becomes a page turner.
B00G32OER4|4.0|Great movie! Very scary and entertaining. My family and I were anxious to watch this movie and it definitely didn't disappoint. We tried to get this movie from Redbox and Netflix but they didn't have it available yet. Amazon's the best!

B007SGLZP8|5.0|I have typically liked Grisham's typical law based books, but that was the problem with them - that there was some predictability in each one of them. I have also typically not liked his non-law based books - they just don't hold my interest.<br /><br />Th Racketeer opened up a new line. There is no class action and no baseball - just a nicely told story of the effects of a crime already committed and a plot woven around it with a couple of twists but with mostly a straight-line narration that keeps you engrossed.
B002ITWSUQ|5.0|Great story  has such a good meaning to it I would recommend this to everyone looking for a good movie for the family

0439023521|5.0|The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins was published in 2008 by Scholastic Press and is the first book in a critically acclaimed young adult trilogy.  Her military father and his deployment to Vietnam when she was just six years old influenced Ms. Collins' writing . She got her start writing for children's television where she received awards. (Collins, web) When asked if she wrote to attract both male and female readers, Ms. Collins said, \\"Whenever I write a story, I hope it appeals to both boys and girls. But maybe in its simplest form, it's having a female protagonist in a gladiator story, which traditionally features a male. It's an unexpected choice. Or I don't know, maybe the futuristic, grim nature of the story is larger than that. I wouldn't care who was the lead in a good dystopian story.\\"(Hudson).<br />A good dystopian story is exactly what The Hunger Games is. Some critics tried to argue that it was just another teen angst love triangle story, but one critic, Katha Pollitt pointed out that, \\"The whole plot turns on Katniss being so romantically uninterested in Peeta, her fellow District 12 Games contestant, she doesn't realize he's in love with her. And, \\" As for \\"guy number two\\" back home, the devastatingly handsome Gale (Liam Hemsworth), Katniss only fleetingly thinks there might be more than friendship there. Mostly she is just trying to survive without becoming a horrible person.\\"(Pollitt).  The story takes place in a post-appocolyptic America now called Panem where twelve districts work under substandard conditions to provide food and products for the ultra wealthy inhabitants of The Capitol.  To remind the downtrodden proletariat not to risk revolting again one male and one female child are taken from each district once a year and forced to fight to the death in an appalling reality television program enjoyed by the Capitol residents and endured by the District residents.  It is difficult to miss the social commentary on America's dependence on goods produced in third world nations as well as our love for the cruel behavior exhibited on current reality television programming.<br /> There are so many ethical lessons illustrated in this fast paced book, that it could provide lesson plans and project ideas in classrooms for at least a semester.  One sociologist, Amber Simmons, wrote, \\"Class on Fire: Using the Hunger Games Trilogy to Encourage Social Action,\\" an academic paper detailing how teachers across America have used The Hunger Games to encourage high school students to get involved in their communities.  The book's theme of hunger has encouraged kids to work in food banks, conspicuous consumption  leads to recycling, children warriors lead to outreach for child soldiers in Uganda and working to end human trafficking at home and abroad.(Simmons). As Ms. Simmons said, \\"But language arts teachers have a responsibility to make our students conscious of such difficult issues, not to turn away from them.\\"(Simmons).  Turning a blind eye, or spectator guilt is another theme of The Hunger Games, as the outlandish populace of The Capitol think only of the Tributes as fodder for their entertainment, not starving children forced to do unthinkable deeds.<br />There are some characters that choose to help, who see the injustice and use their talents to oppose President Snow, the evil villain of this fairytale.  One such character is Cinna, the show's stylist who, like Cinderella's Fairy Godmother, designs a dress to impress and sway the Capitol audience in Katniss' favor.  But it is Katniss' intelligence, strength and skill that keep her and Peeta alive in the arena. If it is a love story, it is a reluctant one, with a lead female character who has no desire for children or love, only survival for herself and her family.<br /><br />Works Cited<br /><br />Collins, Suzanne.

B00BD99JMW|5.0|Despite the gut wrenching ending, I respect Veronica Roth's choice to end it the way she did. The underlying tone throughout the series pertaining to self sacrifice is unfortunately a fitting end to the series. I may not like what happened, but I get it.
B008ZDC7M8|5.0|I love it! I love it! I love it! Mark Cousins takes you on a complete journey of the 100 plus years of film. But! Instead of the typical rehash of Hollywood claptrap, he takes you around the world to see actual innovation and new thought. As a lover of independent film, this 5 Disc epic gives me greater insight into the films I have seen, and leads to new films I haven't seen.<br /><br />Cousins covers technique, directors, styles, actors, writers and everything else it takes to make cinema. Perhaps one of the most interesting aspect of this series, is how in poor countries around the world, they have created such masterpieces, on shoestring budgets. With little equipment and experience, desire and drive have leapfrogged over Hollywood's billion dollar boondoggles. It almost brings a tear to your eye when you realize what Hollywood could have put out if artistic expression had been the goal, instead of control.<br /><br />If you think CGI Super Heroes bouncing around onscreen, blasting the snot out of the landscape is fine film, then don't buy this series.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|An elegant, engrossing and enjoyable game. The thoughtful story line is deep and mysterious and the superb graphics reflect how much hard work went into developing the game. I found myself saving chapters for later so I could savor The Room over a few days. Download before a long plane trip. It will be a marvelous way to spend the time.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|It was one of the most original books I ever read. I didn't want it to end.... I wish it was longer.
B006LSZECO|4.0|An interesting tale of marriage from each spouse's perspective.  Terrifyingly humorous as to how marriage can drive each spouse to their own psychotic revelations.  The end, which in life, may be sadly understandable.  However, the explosive if not just end you expected, didn't happen. A total let down for me.  Not for the young because of profanity and sexual content.

B00BWQW73E|5.0|This book contains plenty of information about amazon culture like two pizza size team, mock up press release, working backward, etc. These are all very unique amazon cultures. The best is this book not only just cover these cultures, but also explain how many of these cultures came into being. Besides, the book is also well written, it's very hard for me to put down after I started reading it. :-) One thing I wish the book could cover more is the AWS part, which is not discussed much in the book. For those who want to know better about amazon or Jeff himself, this is definitely a book worth reading. So thanks Brad for such a good book!
B005SFR7YE|5.0|What a great performance! Well worth owing if you love good quality musicals. We have watched it several times already.
0307476073|1.0|The only reason I finished this book was because I was reading it for book club. Let's put aside how incredibly dangerous it is to hike one of these trails when you don't know what you're doing because, to her credit, Ms. Strayed does mention it wasn't the safest idea. The writing is repetitive in a way that seems both purposeful as well as unnecessary. It's like when a movie has a nice subtle point and then it has a voice over telling you what happened so that no one could miss it. The writing is also repetitive in the way that it repeats words and ideas sentence after sentence--&#34;though&#34; being a favorite.* In addition, there are many editing errors (misspellings, etc.), which makes it seem like a poorly edited piece. Overall, I would not have finished this book if I didn't have to do so.<br /><br />*The writer of this review repeated herself there intentionally, and will now demonstrate the over the top nature of what it is like to have something explained to someone when that person already knows what's happening.
B00G32QIEG|4.0|With the cast I honestly expected it to be funnier. With that said the story line was good and I liked the characters.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|Would have rated five stars anyways but it is shady in my opinion to require it for a bonus level .
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Very easy reliable and convenient to use love this calculator app better than the others. I use it all the time to balance my checking account it's never failed me
B00FPH6M82|4.0|This move had great effects graphics and audio.  The story was not deep but strait forward.  The ending was corny.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I loved this ending and felt it did the characters justice. My only issue was that I had a little trouble following who was narrating. Other than that the story was very satisfying and tied up everything nicely.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Interesting twist. Great easy read during commute. Very vivid main characters that resembled people or a composite of various people you probably know.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|It is fun fun fun. You will get addicted to this game. Try it out, you will have fun. Any game from this company I have not been disappointed.
B001TH16DI|5.0|This set will cost a lot more if bought elsewhere. Good there is Amazon that we can depend on. The packaging is very accessible better than other which are bulky.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|The story has taken a turn I wasn't expecting. I'm glad to see there's a reason for his lifestyle...But I feel like the sex is just feeling in the pages...a little boring actually...
B000QCS8TW|5.0|The people are magnificent,and the story line is facinating. Can't wait to read the next one. I have ordered it.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|In the Husband's Secret we are presented with three different story lines that are all somehow intertwined. I won't be telling you how, because that'll just take all the fun out of it! First we're given Cecilia, who after searching for a piece of the Berlin Wall (literally) comes across a letter her husband has written, addressed to her and only to be opened upon his death. The big question is will she or won't she read it??<br /><br />Secondly, we have Tess who has just been informed by her husband, Will, and cousin, Felicity, that they are in love with each other and want to act on their feelings. Doing what she thinks is best, Tess takes off for Sydney with her son Liam, to take care of her mother who has broken her ankle. Also allowing for Will and Felicity to just &#34;get it out of their system&#34; so she can have her husband back.<br /><br />Thirdly, we have Rachel whose son and daughter-in-law will be moving to the United States and taking her grandson, Jacob with them. Rachel is absolutely devastated, Jacob has been the one thing to completely distract her from her solitude. Once they leave for the states she will be alone, and left with only her thoughts and memories.<br /><br />All I can really say is Wow. Ms. Moriarty has constructed one unbelievably detailed and well written story. Her writing style will absolutely captivate you and keep you enthralled from beginning to end. The character development was excellent. She has created a cast that is so &#34;real&#34; and relatable it could easily be you or a friend living out the story, making connecting with them absolutely effortless.  And I definitely connected! Sharing their emotions, their ups & downs and their day to day struggles was just amazing.<br /><br />Right off the bat we're thrown into the story just as Cecilia has found the infamous letter. But don't think you're getting the goods right away. The suspenseful build up leading up to the point where she actually reads the letter was pure torture! (In a good way of course). I was definitely caught off guard by the big reveal, I expected it to be something completely different, so kudos to the author for completely throwing me off the scent! I enjoyed the quirky humor and elaborately constructed scenes. It was interesting to see how all the characters lives were connected in one way or another. The story flowed perfectly and unfolds right before your eyes much like a movie on the big screen, which I seriously hope it becomes.<br /><br />This is my first experience reading a book by Ms. Moriarty, but certainly not my last! I highly recommend this book to those who love a good emotional and suspense filled read.re! (In a good way of course).

B00CWY76CC|5.0|I think this game is a very good brainstorming game to help challenge your self and to make you think better in real life because your challenging you self to solve these cases and that makes you brain stronger in every day life
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|My friends warned me NOT to start playing Candy Crush Saga... told me it's addicting and they were right!  So much fun, easy to play but challenging. Clear, colorful graphics and sounds. If you are patient and diligent you can keep retrying without paying more to play. I am not a fan of games that lure you in then charge you to continue to play. A plus is I can play without internet connection so I can play anywhere. Thanks Amazon.
B006S08RLU|1.0|I read the reviews and thought it would be a great movie to watch, everyone talked so highly of it. This is definitely an artsie-type movie. I was bored through the entire thing, nothing was inspiring to me other than knowing I was just a little bit closer to it being over. I know it could just be my personality, but I know there are others out there like me. Horrible movie.
B004HXIZVC|5.0|I think this app is so great I did a little WiFi test with it and it works without WiFi this app is so great. It's free get the app and download it and lastly install it. But that is just my opinion.
B000BISBDY|5.0|There are lots of Johnny Cash collections out there, but this one gives the casual listener the songs they really need from Johnny Cash's long career. It even includes &#34;The Wanderer&#34; from U2's Zooropa album.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I absolutely recommend this game its fun and it passes the time by when your bored. Really like this game I hope they make a sequel.
B005HED11Y|4.0|You've gotta love a show that shows the precursor to the cellphone, the blue tooth(uhura's ear communicator) and a flat screen TV as a  just to name a few latter day inventions this show came up with, why sickbay even had a MRI machine a classic.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This game is fun but addictive. Enjoy the fighting and upgrading. It has a broad spectrum of fighters and has a good fighting system.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Can barely put it down. They make learning about virology and epidemiology fun. Cannot wait until they come up with their next update. I will keep my eye out for this company
B00BBA6FOI|5.0|Almost every idea in this book reflects what strong women think, afraid of, never tell or cry about. wery much recommended to those who still hesitate what to do with their lifes or who still depends on stereotypes, created by world,religion,history,life,etc.
B009JZSC9S|4.0|love this series, doesn't bore you. My husband doesn't get into this type of show, so usually I watch it when it's just me and my daughters...then it's s Good wife marathon!
B001DPHDCY|5.0|I thought this would be new...it's not, but still is in very good condition. I love Horton Hears a Who. Yes, &#34;A person's a person no matter how small&#34;!!!
B00BAVCD8A|5.0|this album is fun to play loud and sing along to - my personal fave track? &#34;The Mighty Fall&#34; - soaring vocals, fun verses, and more of the trademark Fall Out Boy sound
B0041KBWM0|4.0|This version of Emma provides story details lacking in the other versions, but it tends to drag too much. Our favorite is still the version starring Gwyneth Paltrow.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Just as good as the first book. Another easy read. Wonder if the movie will do it justice? Looking forward to reading the 3rd book.
B001992NUQ|5.0|No words can describe how great this movie is :x  This is a David Fincher Master piece that can never be topped. Buy this movie !!!
B0092S4WLY|2.0|More primitive, and I hate that there is no hint or help button if you get totally stuck and can't advance. I also an not impressed that if you leave and go back that you have to start that level all over again...the more I've been playing these, even the ones you purchase...they need a hint button!
B002MG2RG0|5.0|Thoroughly enjoy the classics. Bela Lugosi IS Dracula, he originally came from that part of the world!! No one can compare. My husband and I rented these for Halloween. Really enjoyable!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great game, keeps me entertained, no issues so far...would have given 5 stars if it had a clue or help button...I've gotten stuck and have had to come back later, only to have to start the level over.
B00CHVJI08|5.0|Omg!! The movie is sure to become a classic! !! I love my belt, he goes everywhere with me. A must buy for your collection.
B00AYE8C70|1.0|I could not get this app to work.  I was travelling overseas which is the reason I purchased it but it did not work for me and was therefore useless.  I uninstalled it and reinstalled it with a newer version from Google and that app appears to work, although I have not had the opportunity to use overseas yet since I had already returned from my trip.
B009NX1YT6|5.0|Wonderful classic film with great music. Takes us of a certain age group, back to the day which we can identify with. Thanks.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I have no problems with this game. If you enjoy bingo, I would recommend! I downloaded awhile ago. And I play the game everyday. I faithfully collect my daily bonuses and play for a while. Try it.
B00CAUHF6U|5.0|Factual and objective. The more you read, the more it becomes interesting. Could not wait to finish the book and now to see the film.
B0049J0CTM|5.0|Thumbs up----- love this movie! Can't wait for part 2 coming out in 2015! You will love it too! :-)
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I agree with all reviews that have one star.  I read up to Chapter 22 then in my usual fashion could not wait any longer to see what happened at the end.  Needless to say I was extremely disappointed.  I immediately went to Amazon and refunded this book.  I wish I would never have started this trilogy and now have NO desire to see the movies.  Hate to say I love the happy ending but I do.  I feel like my time was wasted to have these characters end so strangely.  Not at all what I thought it would be.  Shame on this author!!!
B006K1IIHA|5.0|If your an English Mystery fan as I am you'll love the modern setting of Arthur Conan Doyles stories of the detective Sherlock Holmes. If you think the Victorian era of detective stories may be getting a little long in the tooth then &#34;Sherlock&#34; may be the series for you. All of the stories from Sir Arthur Conan Doyles novels have been redone in this modern rendering of his stories which will not disappoint.
0525478817|5.0|Amazing book. Sad but absolutely beautiful! Would recommend this book to everybody!! Was absolutely glued from beginning to end! Fantastic!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is fun and addicting. Levels alternate between easy and extremely challenging and sometimes its simply a matter of luck.
B007AL48UK|3.0|If you like Mahjong than this is a game for you. I found the tiles a little too alike so in order to match you really have to pay attention.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|I love to get to know the characters in any book I read. Louisa was well-drawn and I loved her.I thought I would be disappointed as I read because I thought there would be a predictable ending. I was surprised . There were many serious topics mixed in but humor also.Well worth reading!
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Who thought the safety of the prison would last...??  Season 4 is off to a great start and it's clear that the influx of new people from Woodbury has introduced a huge set of issues that will need to be addressed as we proceed into the season.  Having cut the cable/satellite ties about a year ago, it's fantastic to jump in and watch commercial free the day after air.  My only complaint so far is that I can't get Talking Dead (the 1 hour after show) via Amazon.  This seems to be the only show that I have to go without at the moment, and it was fun to see cast, crew, and celebrity commentary immediately following the episodes to help process all the details and clues that crop up.<br /><br />Anyway, I digress.  To sum up, if you are a Walking Dead fan that wants to own the season you won't be disappointed (at least so far).  I've yet to be really let down by the content and hope to see AMC carry this production on well into the future...
B00132S74A|4.0|True Follett from beginning to end. I guessed Anthony's role. Still had a surprising end. Attention to detail was superb.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I remember reading The Shining while waiting in line to get in to see the original Star Trek film.  By the time we got into the theater I was at the part where the hedge animals where were attacking Halloran.  Being a Trekkie I did enjoy the film but it was  bit anticlimactic after what I just read.  Doctor Sleep was a good read but more mellow and easier on the good guys. I too have aged and enjoy this type of triumph in a time that is rife with hostility and violence.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Flynn does a great job of setting up the story making you create certain conclusions in your mind but has an unexpected twist. Very well done. Also a little creepier than I had expected but still good
B003WUYOQ6|4.0|Great content however a little repetitive in the first half of the book. I learned a whole lot about different diets and the effects on the body. Has helped me figure out the best way for me to eat.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I see lots of reviewers are disappointed about the conclusion of the story. That part didn't bother me at all - but the poor plot development, inconsistent characters, and the recycling of ideas that had worked for the author in the past did.  Clearly this book was rushed to production under the schedule of movies and not under the careful eye of an editor.
B0063GORYU|5.0|It's very addictive and easy to play. Better than solitare<br />Fun for the whole family. I enjoy playing everyday for hours.
B0014DQSG2|4.0|It is a beautiful story about a daughter's journey to find her father and know him, it is acted with great sensitivity.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I can understand the addiction; especially when they only give you so many free moves - noone wants to pay for additional moves, so you play the same level over and over until you complete it. EVIL!!!
0861714911|5.0|This book has not only become a classic but it is also a special treasure. Bhikkhu Bodhi writes eloquently and covers a very wide terrain of complex issues in a very accessible and intelligent manner. The text provides a very useful structure in which to view the Pali Canon and interweaves this into a very insightful way broadening understanding of Buddhas legacy to the world. 5 stars from me.
B000NY12LO|5.0|well written.....kept your interest.....so enlightening for this day and time .  A &#34;must read&#34; for parents with middle school and high school age children.....OR ANY AGE children......As a parent,  it shows us the importance of keeping up with what our kids are doing,l<br />What their everyday life is at school.  and certainly what they are doing on social media~!!!!!!!!!!
B00CHSPB8Y|2.0|REALLY that's all that needs to be said.<br />The armors get more expensive, the levels get harder as you progress, and the only way to get a somewhat lengthy experience is to purchase those expensive armors.<br />The devs only put 4 levels in this game. That's it. You just play those same levels over and over again.<br />Enemies are way too repetitive.<br />As you progress the levels get more difficult and it would seem the control responsiveness gets worse at those times when you need it to work the most.<br />Then, the game freezes way too frequently at points when you need to maneuver so you end up taking damage or get killed which is ridiculous because the farther you progress the faster it goes. So, again, the game glitches at those important times when you need it to work the most.<br />Boss battles are okay but there arent enough bosses in the game.<br />Seriously, cant these guys put an update or two in there to give more levels, enemies, and bosses? I know they're making money off of this game.<br />Upgrades matter very little. They are so minor in effectiveness it's obvious that the makers of this game are just trying to more than persuade you to spend real money.<br />I understand that they have to make their money but I dislike games that do it in this way. Manipulation rather than the quality of the game overall is how they plan to make money on this game.<br />It's good for a short while but there's just not enough content to justify spending real money on this game.<br />The graphics are very good though. The only thing I can't complain about.<br />The armors look great. Like they're being displayed on a showroom floor.<br />I would say play it as long as you want but don't give these guys your money until they add much more content.
B00992CF6W|4.0|It's a great games if you don't have the pc version but there isn't lava or diamonds.<br /><br />We can't build some stuff like boats and nether portals
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I love this book,I watched the movie before the book because I didn't know there was a book to it but when I found out I was like I gotta read this book this book is the best book I've read in my lifetime I swear please read this book
078322947X|5.0|Friedkin's unappreciated Masterpiece. This film is on no one's Top 100 list. I can name you seventy films on that list that are not as good as Sorcerer.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I really liked this book,I'm looking forward to House of Hades Book 4 I think that it will be good!
B000FC1MCS|4.0|I loved it!!! It really changed the way that I look at children with disabilities.  I have often wondered what they could be thinking at different times.  I recommend this book to everyone and its an easy read.
B003G4W49C|5.0|It was a great book. Definitely worth reading<br />. I couldn't put it down for more than time to eat.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app. You can let your imagination run free. The thing is, it needs to have throngs like the Xbox version. Such as wolfs,more tools,like a fishing pole, enderman,all those cool decorations that the Xbox version has,spawning monsters in creative,everything in the Xbox version. Thanks mojang,for reading this review! Besides it needing more stuff,I highly recommend this app.
B0078XFYDA|5.0|Somebody needs to tell Amazon that this book does not really belong in the category of &#34;folklore and mythology,&#34; despite the fact that it has the word &#34;magic&#34; in its title. That's &#34;magic,&#34; not &#34;magick.&#34;
B006LXQID8|4.0|Excellent characters, especially Audrey Tautou.  I like the settings, the people interaction, and the story line.  Some of the lines are so telling of Amelie's situation.
B00E8B1358|2.0|50% cheese, 40% action, with 10% comedy filler.  I had high hopes for the movie, but I just couldn't get engrossed.  Reality is, there are some funny moments, and the action is OK, but the story line never pulls you into the movie.  It has a lot of potential, with a very good cast, but somehow it misses the mark.
B004J4WNL2|1.0|I'm an introvert, and didn't like this book at all.<br /><br />She's addressing the problem in our society with how extroversion has been glorified. It turns out sounding more like an extrovert-basher book than not, and gives introverts permission to not develop any sort of people skills at all. \\"The big bad extroverts don't understand how we're actually deeper and smarter than them.\\" Basically, the opposite extreme of the problem she's addressing. Shouldn't we be going for balance and acceptance of all types of people?<br /><br />In Myers-Briggs speak, she basically said all Extroverts are ESFJs or ESTJs, and all Introverts are INFJs or INTJs. As an ISFP myself, I often felt more like her \\"Extrovert\\" than her \\"Introvert\\", and I'm clearly introverted.<br /><br />It was \\"okay\\", but she spent way too long saying way too little (a lot like this review, haha). The book had a couple good points, the main one being that our society has glorified extroversion, and \\"people skills\\" are more highly valued than they necessarily should be. For example, she talked about Harvard and how the students' grades are directly connected with how well they do socially, and being \\"social\\" basically means being extroverted. Or how when you're in a job interview, they want you to be \\"good with people\\" more than they want you to actually be good at the task you're being hired for, whether the job involves people or not. She went on to say that OVER AND OVER AND OVER again in different ways, with poorly done (and boring/slowly written) studies and stories.<br /><br />Now, I didn't read the entire thing, just a few chapters and I skimmed a bit... I honestly couldn't get through it. (Maybe the parts I didn't read were awesome, who knows.)<br /><br />Is it worth 10 bucks? Maybe. It was nice to skim. :)
B00F91SCXC|4.0|Good movie.  I had no idea the movie was about a world war against Zombies, but it turned out to be a pretty good storyline.  Brad Pitt is excellent as always, and the other actors in the movie are OK as well.  Special effects are excellent, and the story does keep you engrossed with the movie.  I wish the ending was different, but other than that - 4 stars.  Very good.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I love the idea of it and the potential for where it can go, but unfortunately I have not been able to get it to work on all the networks I've tried.  That's not exactly the Chromecast's fault, but it just means that on some networks, it may not work so well.  When I did get it to work, it was great and easy to use.  But getting it to work is the trick, and one that won't work depending on network settings.
0553108034|5.0|Fantastic series and is way worth the read. If you enjoy to read and enjoy the game of throne series on HBO then these books are for you!!
B0012CH350|5.0|The cover is very durable and should last a long time.<br />My Weber Grill is outdoors all year in all weather conditions albeit under the cover of a porch. In the summer it gets to be 115⁰ and higher in the shade and down to 20⁰ and even colder in the winter.  This cover can take anything the weather dishes out.
081099741X|5.0|Matt Zoller Seitz is one of my favorite critics and he didn't disappoint with this beautiful volume.  Matt's takes on the different films are very interesting and enriching.  The photos, layouts, and overall design are worthy of a book about Wed Anderson.  I'm very happy to have this on my shelf.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I am so glad there is a kindle version of this game now. I love playing it on here as it is the perfect size. This game is fun and draws you in, sometimes for longer than you anticipated.<br /><br />My one complaint is how long it takes to build back up lives. Also, to unlock a section of game you have to wait for help. Or pay. Wish you could pass it after a certain time frame.<br /><br />All in all, great game!
B00D3NSDVO|5.0|Travelling from one end of the globe to the other this story ties in real life occurrences with a clever and well written plot. It's a nail biting race to save the world and is believable in every sense. Really well thought out with depth of characters and attention to detail. Best read since &#34;Haji Haji Haji&#34; by John Lewis. This is a must read. I couldn't put this book down. Will certainly be looking for more from Terry Hayes.
B00BV85AVE|5.0|Beautiful new casing, loving the packaging and the bonus song!!!! Def a collectors/Lamb item<br />stone winner smash hit wonder a beautiful collectors item for any Lamb or Mariah fan
B00BU9DXAY|5.0|This book basically is my life with my beloved dog Sophie. I am a huge dog person and have often thought similar things about dogs. I freaking love The Oatmeal and have pretty much since day one. A fan for life. Read this book and hope your furry best friend achieves immortality. Also I love that his dog is named Rambo.
B00G32TD98|5.0|Damn this was thrilling! This is from James Wan, director of Saw 1 and Insidious 1&2 and Fast and the Furious 7. Based on a true story, the film is very interesting.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love the app but will not update it said a new update is on Amazons app story and it is free
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love to hate this game. I can't stop playing it's so addictive. Just when you think the levels can't get any harder they do. Trying to keep ahead of your friends is also fun.
B00F7YHDWC|2.0|just like dumb ways to live that really wasnt made for the kindle fire like they make u blow a plane(thts wht she said)to keep it from hiting the ground which is impossible and the graphics arent tht great
B00785P2QC|5.0|Awesome game, every one should down load and play. End less fun you will not be able to stop playing this game.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Works great on my kindle. Been waiting for it for awhile. works just like if I am on my Pc.
0425266060|5.0|I could not put the books down! The ending will leave you mad, until next book comes out. A must read for women.
B005OKTPKC|5.0|John Grisham always does a great job and this one is no different. It's worth a read and I breezed through it because I couldn't stop reading!!
0744014956|5.0|I don't need walkthroughs for my games but I love collecting these books! Its a very nice hardback and beautifully illustrated. I do agree with people how it could be a little more descriptive, especially with the stock market. I still very much enjoy this book and would highly recommend it to.
B00EMAGCJM|5.0|I think this CD turned out well. I love almost all of the songs on the album. At first there were a few songs that I wasn't sure about and now there is only one &#34;Do my thang&#34;. I just can't get into that song.<br />I love the diversity of the music and each song has its own unique sound. The collaborations with other music artists made it a really good album.<br />I have been listening to this CD in my car since I bought it the day it came out.
0545615402|5.0|Each book is about 100 pages each. The set and each book has an expensive feel due to the textured hard cover.Buy them to complete your Harry Porter library and also to contribute towards two charities that J.K.Rowling has chosen.
B00AQL8VU4|4.0|The OTG cable. HDMI connectivity, screen resolution, Home Office bundle, and speech to text hands-free option were pleasant surprises. it was very easy to set up and the stock browser is quite stable. I experience very little choppiness while screaming video from YouTube and the video quality was comperable to any tablet in its price range. It does not come with Bluetooth connectivity and the camera is not very good. other than that I would recommend this tablet anybody on a tight budget. On two occasions I emailed the seller with questions and they were very prompt, responsive, and totally appeared to care. I would not hesitate one moment to order anything from this seller should I need a product.
B002ZG99G8|5.0|I love action movies.  Things blowing up and lots of gun play.  So I definitely liked this movie.  It has the typical theme to it of course but who cares... I want entertainment
B00BAXFAJC|5.0|Many novels are described as Dickensian, few deserve the praise, the Luminaries could have been written by the master himself.  It is that good.  If you are not a dickens fan you might not enjoy the richly detailed scenes, the large diverse cast of characters with wholly unexpected connections with each other....the author even manages to nail the sentiment which almost verges too far into the sentimental but yet somehow still moves the heart in a deep substantial satisfying way.  The author just gets it! If you love Dickens you will love this novel.
B000YHE4AG|5.0|I truly love this movie. It is now considered a holiday classic. Will ferrell did the part excellent and needs to return for a sequel. This is a must have for any Xmas collection. Please come back with a sequel for your fans will. Your amazing.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is addictive.  Now I see what everyone is talking about. I play it before I go to bed. Right before. I go to work. Its crazy how much fun it really is.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Interesting and different. I like the mystery about it. I don't like that you have to wait for your energy to stock back up in order to play unless you buy diamonds.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game is awesome my mom was getting me games and she got this so I decided to play it it is awesome you should try it
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|Did not like keeps kicking you off ,and you have to buy lifes to continue.I don't. like to buy new lives.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this game is awesome. my relative is addicted to it. awesome buy it awesome awesome awesome. cool cool cool awesome sweet awesome
B00BSBU4EC|2.0|So-so movie. Tired story-line that has been used 1000 times, ie- fantastical characters help human save the day. Very predictable story-line. I yawned a few times... kinda corny. I wouldn't bother watching it again. Kept kids attention half-way or so. Good animation though.
B00000IPAX|3.0|The album is amazing. I love every song on it. The only issue is that the casing for the album came broken and cracked. But if you like Blink - 182 then buy this
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Hilarious movie! Excellent story line that was original and well written. Very humorous. Kids loved watching it and are always excited to watch it again- the sign of a true masterpiece.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|It was great to go back to familiar characters and at the same time learn a whole new story. I found this to be an easy read that I did not want to put down. Definitely , one of the better King books. I'm not giving much detail about the book, you can glean that from other reviews.
B000PDYVVG|4.0|Not quite sure what I was expecting but after seeing the movie in the theater, I just knew I needed to read the actual book. It was everything and nothing like I had imagined. I've been inspired, I've had moments that caused me to reflect, moments of pause, bewilderment and awe. It's been an exhilarating worthwhile read.
B006LSZECO|4.0|It was a very thrilling ride all the way up until the end. I was a little let down by how it ended. I loved how you got both perspectives of the story and the gripping turn of events but I just wish the ending was just as thrilling.
0374533555|5.0|There are books that you read for pleasure and others that you read to learn something. This one is of the later type, but it is also a very enjoyable read. The ideas are presented clearly and with each chapter about 10-12 pages long, you can definitely learn &#34;in managable chunks.&#34;<br /><br />Better yet, you can actually apply the concepts you learn to your daily life or your job. Marketers, sales people, investors, and politicians may benefit the most, but if you want to make better decisions for yourself or help other make better decisions, this book will help.<br /><br />Each chapter ends with quotes that help to summarize the key points of the chapter. Still, you might want to take some notes on each chapter and keep them as a reference.
B00C1S945G|5.0|I am really enjoying watching the actors become their characters and seeing the ensemble really work together.  It's very intertaining.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|The story is very good once I got past the world introduction. It conveys the creative passion of an artist struggling against an impossible contract.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft pocket edition but they should add more things like slime enderman wolf's cats birds and more Biomes  to the game and  add mine carts and tracks and skins and mods other than that it's great
B00F8GYC1Y|4.0|I think the game is good but it's really short also it some times glitches on my divise and it can be chalinging
B0021L8UPS|5.0|WTH! This movie was really mind blowing, and shocking to say the least!!l It reminded me of the GOOD SON, with Macaulay Culkin and Elijah Wood. Thumbs Up!!
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|I like the new Doctor and the action is Superb! I also think the show is well written and wonderfully acted!!
B00CMQX84A|5.0|Excellent movie. So nice to see no violence on this just plain fun film. All the actors are clean cut mostly and a joy to watch
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Really addictive! In a way it is irritating that have to WAIT for new &#34;lives&#34; to be available, but at the same time it is slowing me down from playing for hours.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|This is the best action film and so well done. If your not a fan then this one just might change your mind. I can't get enough of the action in this one!!
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|Hard for me to manipulate. The game itself is fun I just have a hard time playing it.  I couldn't seem to get the hang of it.
B00EGMQIJ0|2.0|(or more precise - Atlas Shrugged meets 1984 and they all work at Google)<br />Not nearly as good as the Time magazine reviewer made it seem. No surprises, simple characters. Would be more appropriate in the free lending library. Disappointed I paid full price.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I enjoy all of the Angry Bird series! They are easy for me to master! It reminds me of the movie.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|Denzel Washington is such a good actor and doesn't dissapoint in this movie. It was kind of a dark role for him. I enjoyed it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|The automatic play aspect of this game eliminates the monotony of dragging each card into play making the game move much quicker.
B008602KQI|5.0|I read all of the books first. I really enjoyed the movie and can't wait for the next movie to come out.
B00BHHIWQO|2.0|Fun game and addictive if you like matching games but ... what gives them the right to stop game play because you won't rate it! I paid for the game so why do I have to rate it if I don't want to. Sucks when they stop all game play if you won't rate it.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|I just love this saga, I decided to watch it all over again. Great series. Disc 2 did have few glitches.
B003IKMR0U|5.0|This is a fun game and easy to play.  I bring it to game night and it's a big hit with everyone.  It's quick enough to keep your attention and easy enough for any age to play.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|One of his best. Suspenseful. Loved the way he referred back to&#34;the Shining&#34; & made it part of the story.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I like that each level has different challenges. Some games are just repeated over and over.  I also like that you get 're dos.<br /><br />.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|I really liked this game.  There weren't too many HOG.  A map would have been very useful.  I had to keep using the hint button to remember how to get to/from different scenes.  Overall, a quality game, and I will get Enigmatis 2.
B00DI75SWM|5.0|thus app is so much fun!! you can create your own sayings, design, Colorado, filter and picture!! even though this is 99 cents, you wont regret it. its a great app and the money is totally worth it!!!
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|I must say I am a huge fan of Andrea Bocelli! His voice is by far one of the most beautiful classical voices of all time!!!!! I think this album is pure beauty and life! All the songs are moving classics that can make you cry, and tap your foot. I think anyone who loves classical romantic music, and the legendary opera tenor Mr. Bocelli needs to purchase this album! A few paper bills are a fantastic deal for what you will get ! My favorite tenors of all time are Andrea and Luciano Pavarotti(may he rest in peace), and I must say these two classical giants have moved me to tears. This music in this album has life, romantic depth, and stunning color. This is quality  talent! There will never in history be a tenor like Bocelli in the future. Just the fact that he can sing Opera and other types of music like romantic classical blows me away! And he does both so beautifully. there are no word to describe how much I love this music and how beautiful Andrea's voice is. He sings every note like he is singing to God. pure beauty. Please if you want to be moved, buy this album. You will hold it close to your heart for years to come. I happen to be an Operatic mezzo-soprano myself and jazz, romantic singer, and I must say this album has got me singing the songs all day long. Mr. Bocelli is one of my idols. Andrea, thank you for sharing your God given gift. One thing I don't like is the fact that he sings with singers Like J L and N F. These people are pop culture figures and don't come close to the talent of Andrea. I think its tacky and stupid. I don't know why someone else was not chosen to duet with him on those two songs. I do love the songs though! Andrea is probably trying to bring this kind of music to young people, which is incredible, and just what the music world needs. that's just a theory. This is just my review. Thank you again Andrea. I hope I can sing with you in the future.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I liked how the book was very detailed in the descriptions. It was a really easy book to visualize while you read and that made for a very good book. I would recommend this to anyone. Young adults would especially like this. I chose a 5 star rating because that's what I think the book deserves.
0803726570|4.0|Very cute story! My daughter loves to listen to it and she likes the pictures. Good lesson about sharing and teamwork.
1452113432|5.0|It was Exactly as described! And it arrived on time! We Will definitely choose again! What customers look for is to be able to get what u ordered and get it asap!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Look, this is the BEST game ever!!! Minion rush is awesome and I'm an expert at this. I've had this game for like, 2 years and it never gets boring
B00EO4SBSG|5.0|TRIVIUM ARE BACK WITH A VENGEANCE AFTER THEIR LAST ALBUM (IN WAVES) HAD MIXED REVIEW'S AND LEFT SOME OF US TRIVIUM FANS WONDERING WHAT DIRECTION THE BAND WAS HEADING. SOME PEOPLE LIKED IT AND OTHERS NOT SO MUCH, WELL I HAVE TO SAY THAT IS ALL OVER NOW! THIS ALBUM IS DEFINITELY PUTTING THE BAND BACK IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION! IT'S LIKE A CROSS BETWEEN CRUSADE AND SHOGUN AND IT WILL HAVE YOU RAISING THE DEVIL HORNS AS SOON AS YOU HEAR THE OPENING TRACK - BRAVE THIS STORM! I AM GLAD TO SEE THE SPEED AND HEAVINESS ON THIS ALBUM IS TIGHT AND CONTROLLED, AND I'M SURE MOST TRIVIUM FANS WILL LOVE IT AS WELL. THIS ALBUM COULD BE A CONTENDER AS THEIR BEST WORK YET AS IT HAS ALL THE TRADITIONAL SOUNDS THAT MADE THE BAND TRIVIUM THE GROUP WE LOVE TODAY, BUT TAKING IT EVEN ONE STEP FURTHER......VENGEANCE FALLS IS SOLID THROUGHOUT AND THEY PLAY EVERY SONG LIKE IT'S A HIT......SO GO OUT AND GET THIS TODAY BECAUSE IT WILL BE IN YOUR CD OR MP3 PLAYER FOR AWHILE I'M SURE.
B004FEFS5E|5.0|An interesting detailed book designed for whom is entering in the world of photography. A well description how things really work to get the right exposures.
B00DCP0082|4.0|ANNIHILATOR HAS SERVED UP ANOTHER DISH OF SOLID METAL FOR US METAL HEADS TO FEAST UPON! THIS IS THE FIFTH ALBUM TO FEATURE VOCALIST/GUITARIST DAVE PADDEN, WHICH NOW HAS BECOME THE LONGEST VOCALIST JEFF WATERS HAS USED IN ANNIHILATORS CAREER. ALL FOR YOU, SCHIZO DELUXE, METAL, ANNIHILATOR, AND FEAST ALL FEATURE MR. PADDEN ON VOCALS AND HE BRINGS THE MORE MODERN STYLE OF METAL VOCALS THAT IS BEING USED IN TODAY'S METAL SCENE. RANDY RAMPAGE IS STILL MY FAVORITE OF ALL THE VOCALIST'S JEFF HAS HAD IN THE BAND AND WOULD HAVE SOUNDED GREAT FOR THIS PARTICULAR ALBUM (IN MY OPINION!) AND AS MOST OF YOU KNOW WAS THE ORIGINAL SINGER. I SAY THAT BECAUSE OF HIS GRITTY MORE DEATHLY STYLE OF VOCAL THAT HE BRINGS TO THE TABLE, NOT TAKING ANYTHING AWAY FROM DAVE AS HE CAN DELIVER BRUTAL VOCAL'S TO, BUT THEY ARE JUST CLEANER AND CLEARER SOUNDING WHICH SEEMS TO BE THE WAY ALOT OF METAL VOCALIST'S PERFORM TODAY, NEVERTHELESS ANNIHILATOR HAS SPANNED A NICE COLLECTION OF ALBUM'S WITH DIFFERENT UNIQUE SINGER'S. I PUT THIS ALBUM IN AT #3 OF ALL THE ALBUMS THAT FEATURE DAVE. (SCHIZO DELUXE) AND (METAL) ARE A LITTLE BETTER (IN MY OPINION!) JUST BECAUSE THEIR HEAVIER, BUT THIS ALBUM STILL SHREDS AND IS ABOUT THE SAME AS THEIR LAST ALBUM SELF-TITLED ANNIHILATOR, AND IT HAS ABOUT 4 OR 5 GOOD SONGS ON IT. JEFF STILL DELIVERS AMAZING SOLO'S AND IS ONE OF THE MOST UNDERRATED GUITARIST'S IN METAL! HE HAS HIS OWN UNIQUE STYLE THAT WHEN YOU HEAR HIM PLAY YOU KNOW IMMEDIATELY THAT IT'S JEFF! IF I HAD A DREAM BAND IT WOULD CONSIST OF JEFF WATERS, GARY HOLT ALONG WITH ADRIAN SMITH (AS A COUNTER BALANCE) ON GUITAR'S, D.D. VERNI AND FRANK BELLO ON BASS, DAVE LOMBARDO AND NICKO MCBRAIN ON DRUMS ALONG WITH BRUCE DICKINSON ON VOCAL'S AND GLEN DANZIG AS BACK-UP SINGER. THAT TO ME WOULD BE THE ULTIMATE LINE-UP! I GAVE THIS ALBUM 4 OUT OF 5 STARS ONLY BECAUSE I WOULD LIKE TO SEE JEFF LEAN MORE TOWARDS THE HEAVIER AND DARKER STYLE OF MUSIC THAT HE HAS DONE IN PAST ANNIHILATOR ALBUMS. BUT THE SONGS DEADLOCK, NOWWAY OUT, AND FIGHT THE WORLD WILL SHRED YOUR EARS! MOST OF THE SONGS HAVE GOOD HOOKS IN IT THAT MOST ANNIHILATOR FANS WILL APPRECIATE. SO GET THIS ALBUM TODAY AND ENJOY THE FEAST!
1401324649|5.0|Allan Karlsson did not want to attend his 100th birthday party.  So he slipped out the window of his nursing home, headed down to the bus station, and, on a whim, stole the suitcase of a rather rude young man who asked him to watch over it.  Said suitcase is packed full of money, getting Allan and an increasingly funny cast of characters into and out of trouble.<br /><br />This is an easy, lighthearted, fun read.  Chapters weave between the present day and Allan's improbable past as an explosives expert who fraternized with the likes of General Francisco Franco, Harry Truman, and J. Robert Oppenheimer.  He's a remarkable man with a great sense of humor and a delightful spirit.<br /><br />Sticklers for historical accuracy will simply have to suspend belief for the course of this novel.  Its whimsical plot is meant to be a fun, joyous ride through the life of a truly remarkable man.  It's far from the deepest novel I've read, but it certainly ranks among the most entertaining.<br /><br />I highly recommend this tale to anyone looking for quick, entertaining read.  I challenge anyone to finish this novel without letting Allan's delightful spirit infect your mood.
B00EY7LT9Q|4.0|I didn't think I would like this show but the story line is pretty good it stays pretty close to the movies
B00F8MIIKO|5.0|great movie. I love that it's a prequel to Monsters, Inc. Great humor and a wonderful story. Also a great lesson in friendship
B00DBOF5Q6|5.0|Well written the best description of pow under the Japanese on the Burma railway a great book on the devastation of war and those that survive..10 out of 10
B008MM9630|5.0|It's fun, easy, and the graphics are sooo adorable. I wish I had some friends playing with me... Thanks for making a great, relaxing game :)
B005HED11Y|5.0|Fun to watch the old series again. While watching you appreciate how the Star Trek universe evolved. While I have enjoyed the theatrical reboot, I wish they would continue to build on the original universe.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I love this game. It's pure wasted time and its fabulous. I'm obsessed with beating my own best time on the clock. The music can be annoying but I turn volume down on my kindle when I don't want music. Overall, I can't say this game benefits me in any way, I'm not learning a new skill or stretching my brain but for me, that's the point! It's downtime, giving brain a break time, and having a ridiculous amount of pleasure doing so. I highly recommend!
B005MLOKXA|1.0|Immoral people doing immoral things, all the time. Nothing to like, no character development, just a bunch of a-holes. I would rather watch paint dry.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved it. Its a page Turner and I can't wait for what's to come next from this author....wow a must read!
B000WGWQG8|5.0|A great movie.  I caught bits of it on HBO and decided to buy it and watch it from beginning to end.  It's a good buy for history buffs and HBO Doc. never disappoint.
B00D48BT5A|4.0|Great Bill Bryson style of picking obscure details to mix with major historical facts. And throw in a few light hesrted anecdotes
B002KGEORM|5.0|This is an utterly amazing show. The twists and turns will keep you guessing. Amazing work. Writing and acting are top of the line
B005HED11Y|5.0|Shatner.<br />Repeat nine times.  Honorable mention, the other Shatners in Mirror, Mirror & Enemy Within. His ego, which also should have received acting credit on the show, is a force for good and change within the Federation. The winning combination of the two (or is it three?) is what makes Star Trek the cultural icon of the...I ran out of trite phrases. Sorry.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|The case works for her. She has dropped her kindle fire (the one and only original) quite a few times over the years. The case seems to do its job. Its worth the price and the stars.
1439153663|3.0|An epic demonstration on the power of truth, and the devastating effects that visit us when we fail to be honest in regard to our actions and motivations.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Unlike many authors in this cannon I am pleased  to see a satisfactory ending to a well executed story. Bravo.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Temple run 2 is of coarse just as good as #1 I am very addicted to it but I would wish that there would not be so many glitches other then that though I would have to say it is the best game I have ever played.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This app works great on the kindle fire. I give  I  2 thumbs up!! I haven't found another application that is more thorough than this weather app. Nice.
B00FWLSLJ4|5.0|I generally steer clear of the boys action movies, but this one drew me in.  It was clean and had a good story.
B00992CF6W|5.0|There are a lot of reasons I like Minecraft. Sure, the Pocket Edition doesn't have everything the Xbox and PC editions have, but Minecraft is still awesome. 5 stars all the way!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|great app does exactly what it is supposed to do, lets me play candy crush even if I am not sitting at my computer.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I'm very happy with this game. I like putting puzzles together but it's hard when you have kids this app made it possible it's really cool I recommend trying it out its free and worth it.
B0091THRCU|5.0|This case works great and looks nice. I have received many compliments from my colleagues and some of them have regretted buying a more expensive version.
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|This game is fun. The only thing that sucks is the in app purchasing to play longer without waiting for energy. Other than that the game is fun and additive.
B009DZDJU6|4.0|Good movie, and the storyline was awesome. To tie a great president with the battle that changed a nation, you can't help but love it.
1451666179|5.0|I can't actually tell you how good this book is past page 13. This is because by page 13 I was crying from laughing so hard that I couldn't see the pages. All I've accomplished is getting page 13 spattered with tears. So I can say this book is good for a) pretending to be a tissue, b) giving you an ab work out, c) disrupting the peace of anyone near you. Buy it. Buy it now.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Great game overall just can't beat the game without purchasing tokens, can't upgrade available weapons enough for last mission. Still good addictive game
B00ER23V1W|5.0|Rarely do I buy a movie soundtrack album that is just instrumental pieces of the score, rather than songs. But I HAD to buy Steven Price's phenomenal, haunting, memorable soundtrack album to the equally phenomenal, haunting, memorable sci-fi/drama film &#34;Gravity&#34;. Besides Alfonso Cuaron's outstanding direction, the mindblowing visual effects and cinematography that make you feel like you really are in space, the wonderful performances of Sandra Bullock and George Clooney as the stranded astronauts in space, and the world-class sound design that engulfs you from all sides, Steven Price's mesmerizing film score is the final piece in the brilliant &#34;Gravity&#34; picture. This magnificent musical soundscape score instantly grabs you and keeps you engaged, piece by piece, from the first track to the last. Listening to the soundtrack album brings the movie back to me all over again. This isn't easy listening, per se, but WOW, is this music powerful, especially at night with the lights out, and on headphones. Steven Price easily deserves an Oscar for his amazing work here. If you're a huge fan of the film &#34;Gravity&#34;, then buying this must-have soundtrack album is a no-brainer. I love it. :-)
B00F35BV64|5.0|These guys really do a good job of making you think they are the original characters just younger.  It was good!  Everyone acted well and there was excitement as only Star Trek can bring.
B00ESB6GBY|3.0|I feel like it is too much about Barney and Robin and not enough about Ted and how he met \\"The Mother\\"!
B00FRMDH7Y|4.0|Really fun.  Concept was a little strange, but over all the show was good.  Lessons to be taught...working together, believing in yourself and others, etc...  Worth seeing.  Hard to find good kids shows.  This one was fun.
B0068TJLSY|5.0|Not the greatest movie, but great mindless entertainment. Anytime worth a one-time view. Some people have compared it to ET. It's what ET as a bad horror movie would have been.
B00EY7LT9Q|5.0|Yippee!  Love the Marvel characters!  Love Stan Lee!  Hope they bring Dead Pool into it!  He's flexible because no one sees his face.  This show has the potential to be very exciting.  There evidently is a deeper story line than just weekly episodes.  Little by little, things are revealed.  To get the most out these, you should see them all.  Yet, they could stand alone.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Bought a couple of these, one for myself and one as an attempt to improve my dad's youtube viewing experience (he was setup with an IPad + Apple TV).<br /><br />For my own setup it was pretty straightforward - I got a kick figuring out how it could be configured to recognize my wifi without having any methods of input.  After that, I promptly tried casting chrome tabs from my MBA, and youtubing from all of the mobile devices in the house.  All worked as expected, but I have very little use of it in my house.<br /><br />As a replacement for my dad's Apple TV, however, it rocks.  Previously my dad would use the IPad as the remote for AppleTV to facilitate text input (for search etc), but the connection is intermittent, and the fact that he couldn't log in through AppleTV's Youtube app was cumbersome.  With Chromecast, I instructed him to go to what he wants on the IPad, or his Galaxy Note, then just &#34;cast&#34; it to his TV.  Pausing and seeking is easy and responsive, and he could queue episodes!  Again, he only watches shows on Youtube, so YMMV.<br /><br />A great testament for Chromecast was my dad calling me up the next day asking when I would go pick up the AppleTV.  I am very happy with this ease of use, since it saves me a lot of time and headache doing technical support.
076115728X|5.0|This book shows how what we think are mistakes, can be changed into something even better.  I loved the story and the beauty of the creations from the &#34;Oops!&#34;  Well done!
B006AZZPCM|5.0|This is a fantastic tool to capture youtube content as mp3's to be played offline.  My daughter and I are huge fans for The Voice, and we would listen to the clips in the car.  Previously I would have trouble with contents that are restricted for desktop only, but 2.0.9 can grab those too!  Highly recommended.
0763619612|5.0|This is one of the best children's/adult books I read in a long time.  The philosophy of it is simple and joyful and more insightful than I could have ever imagined.  I bought the book for myself, as a reminder that we all have artistic ability within us.
B00FN811SY|5.0|Simply Awesome! So thrilled to have this app - kids love it too!<br />Works well on Asus Transformer & Google Nexus.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Addictive! The game is simple yet challenging. I have a hard time leaving it alone. I highly recommennd it, lots of fun.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have this on my kindle. I enjoy playing this very much. Very adictive! Anyone who plays this better watch out!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|ADDICTIVE!!!<br /><br />Another great game was also \\"Wboko Monster Blocks\\" which is really good \\"crush style\\" game for \\" FREE\\" too...<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00G1W9O58 Wboko com Wboko Monster Blocks]]
B00G9U7R2O|5.0|Kind of like the Monsters version of Rudy, which BTW is my favorite movie anyway.  Also, my Mom, who recently passed away, loved the original movie, Monsters INC, but sadly didn't get to see this prequal.  If she had, I know she would of loved it.<br /><br />I also kept wondering about all the Monsters deemed 'not scary' in this movie, how the tables would be turned once it was discovered years later, that laughter is a more powerful energy source, than fear/screams were.
B003U4ZOQ8|4.0|This series keeps you guessing with every episode.  Just when you think you have it figured out, there is a new twist.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Grisham usual brilliant novel . Sycamore Row is an attention griping narrative woven with a highly informative  description of civil court.<br />Lawyers tactics.
B0026NWBY2|2.0|I'm a great George Harrison fan and was looking forward to getting this CD<br />I'm not going to get to comment too much about the song selection because for the most part is quite representative of George's work<br />But the sound quality is just awful, I've usually had good luck with remastered CD's, not this one.<br />If you love George Harrison get another CD unless sound quality is of little importance.
006202406X|3.0|It was a slower going story in comparison to the first two in the series.  It is well written.  Let's say I was extremely disappointed with the direction taken for the ending.
0385537131|5.0|Sycamore Row is written in the style that I had come to love from Grisham.  A legal thriller written about local characters in a small, southern town is perfect reading material for me as a southern girl married to a small town attorney.  I love the fact that Jake, Harry Rex and Lucien are back and at odds on how to handle a trial.  There are twists and turns and as usual the ending comes so quickly that the reader is let-down; simply because it is over. Great read.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Sad but heartfelt story about young love. Wonderfully written and quite realistic. Quick read. Great for book clubs or any leisure read
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|very fun for those who like puzzles or figuring things out. it's a very addicting game. if you have difficulty passing the first 20 levels though, I wouldn't recommend continuing. it only gets harder.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|great show. probably the best show that was cancelled in a year. always been disappointed it never got a real chance.
B0034G4P4O|5.0|Action exciting for young and old. format of movie was different but realsitic  non stop action and the characters were all exciting a pleasure for the whole family
B005544TRQ|4.0|It's a great show, good writing, characters, acting, and plots, just wish they'd tone down the swearing, especially G** d***.
B006PZBRCY|4.0|Innovative, funny, riveting. That's what I call a perfect dinner time flick for the family. Great story, awesome acting, especially the little kid. All in a all, well worth the time and the money.
B007WTR2W6|4.0|Very good book, pratical with a bunch of usefull tips and advice. If you are an entrepenauer buy it, you will like it!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|My Alarm Clock is very User friendly. I enjoy going to sleep listening to soft music. This is the best Alarm Clock I've ever had.
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|Excellent acting.and camera work. If you enjoy The Killing or the Bridge then  this is for you.  Tennet and Coleman have great chemistry.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Agent Pendergast novels are so riveting you can't put them down. I can never wait for the newest book to appear.
B0084TWN9K|5.0|A brilliant poet and also a story teller - the short story format is her natural fortey. Keep writing Ms. Munro!
B001675YQ6|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies and I've gotten all my friends hooked on it too. Now they are showing it to everyone!
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|This Was An Excellent Movie..With Unexpected Twists. It Was Fun To Watch. It Had A Great Premise. Actually One Of The Best Movies I've Seen.
B000FBFMIO|4.0|Hobb tells another wonderful story to add to the previous trilogy.<br />The beginning has to catch up the new reader but those returning<br />will enjoy the new characters along with the familiar ones.<br /><br />I look forward to book two already in this series.
B005DJREJS|4.0|I had heard good things about Awkward, and tried it on Prime. I can see it skewing to a (younger) MTV crowd, but found it very enjoyable. A bit soapy (but a lot of shows are), Ashley Rickards as Jenna is immensely appealing and relate able. Her problems are universal (how can I be popular/cool, which boy should I be with, why does she hate me, why is my Mom such a spazz?) and have changed little over the years. The show is also realistic about sex, treating it as natural, messy, and fraught with emotion (even if you're not &#34;serious&#34; yet). I've started on season two, which develops personalities nicely, sophomore year is different, after all. Some unoriginal stereotypes, the ditzy boy crazy BFF, the Asian pal with the overbearing parents, but the characters aren't to blame for that and still manage to be fun. A big thumbs up......
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|Dr Perlmutter is to be congratulated for writing an extremely high quality book explaining complex medical topics clearly and succinctly for the lay person. The research contained in the book is exhaustive and cutting edge. Even more importantly, Dr Perlmutter conveys to his reader why you should care and why you should change your life.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I read this sequel in two days. Could not put it down and never saw the ending coming, exactly. Well written.

B007EC27QM|1.0|I dont know how you could make a calculator that doesn't follow the order of operation. I would have given zero stars if possible, this is a serious failure. Remeber learing the Mnemonic PEMDAS in grade school? Thats order of operation, or also called operator precedence. Apparently the coders for this app were never taught this fundemental mathmatical procedure. Its possible this app literally can make a person dumber
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This author of this book has a talent to keep the material in  his stories  o good that is hard to put it down until you have finished the book

006202406X|4.0|I just finished \\"Allegiant\\".  I have enjoyed the series but I wouldn't say I was a die hard fan or a part of its fandom.  That said, I found this spoiler online by complete accident.  At first, like many readers, I was shocked and a bit horrified.  Then I thought about how Ms. Roth took risks herself to write this ending.  She had to know that she was going to get backlash for this decision.  But it was what she first envisioned when she began writing the trilogy (never guessing how popular it would be) and she stayed true to that vision and I think that is classy.<br /><br />As far as the actual book, I found the storyline to be much more interesting than the second installment but not as good as \\"Divergent\\".  As all of the truths and lies were unraveling I got confused a few times and had to go back a few pages and reread to make sure that I understood things.  I was steeled for the ending but it still knocked the breath from me, but if it had to be written it was done masterfully. Also the rest of the book from that point on was done realistically. In every war there are going to be casualties.  There is a very famous adult author who has a series up to 14+ novels and you never have to worry about her characters being in peril because she refuses to kill them.  Its unrealistic that they could survive that much danger that many times.<br /><br />All that said, I agree that this will certainly cause a mess for the movies unless they change the ending drastically.  I am not sure how such an event would play out across movie audiences.
1400064287|5.0|Fast easy read with great modern analogies that many people can relate to in my opinion, I would recommend this all who want to  make their ideas stick in other people's minds.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|I like Sci Fi but not necessarily zombie movies.  I mean basically if you've seen one zombie you've seen them all. Zombies haven't changed much since I was a kid.  However, I really liked this movie. It made some scientific sense.  Brad Pitt does a great job (nothing new there) his wife in the film annoys me but then when people are stupid in movies it's because it's in the script.  I'd definitely recommend this particularly to Sci fi fans even if they are not zombie movie fans.
B007T8BYWE|5.0|I love Flip Pix. They are the best games of these type that I have found. Wonderful tutorial for beginners.<br />Only wish each game had more puzzles.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I can understand why a lot of you were upset at first at the end and so was I, but you have to look at the big picture. It was a great ending to series and didn't deserve all the criticism it got. Veronica, you broke our hearts many times but you gave us amazing books and characters to love. Thank you.

If u don't do that u well never win that board and move on to win other boards.I have four boards I should've won by now but didn't cause they say somr pieces u win in the treasure cases but I still haven't won nothing and it's been 9 months.I stop playing it only play this gave when BORED.. it gets boring fast.

B00ARA4SLU|4.0|For fans of Hitchcock's style and creativity, this is an interesting \\"bio\\" of his life around the time of the making of PSYCHO ........ a make or break film made late in his life.<br /><br />Anthony Hopkins and the rest do a great job capturing the people and famous actors they are playing --- and although it is not 100% historically accurate, it is accurate enough with just the right degree of poetic liberty tossed in to be very entertaining.<br /><br />An entertaining and loosely based semi-accurate look at the lives of the people behind the making of one of cinema's most pivotal movies.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|There is an intriguing philosophical lesson in this book. Wishing that things had turned out differently does not necessarily mean that the outcome will be better. The Universe has a way of staying in balance.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Keeps you wondering all the way to the end.  Great main characters and a really fun  story line by Grisham.

B003G4W49C|5.0|I have read this book at least ten times but every time I read it I am pulled right back into the world of Ender Wiggins. It is a fast paced read and full of action. I would recommend this book to anyone and hope you will give it a chance you will not be disappointed!!!
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|Obviously, you would not buy this unless you like Paul McCartney.  And if you like Paul McCartney, you will like this.  Paul has not yet started a decline into old age:  He still rocks!<br /><br />It was not immediately obvious to me what was &#34;Deluxe&#34; about the &#34;Deluxe Edition&#34;.  I had to go back and read the other reviews and discussion threads to understand what was going on.  Yuck!  If my funds were limited, or if I was a crazy-radical McCartney fan, I would have shopped a bit more carefully for this, and might not have purchased this particular edition.  Given Paul's non-trivial wealth, one wonders why the greedy marketing?  Still, I did enjoy the songs, especially the one about the Green Bus.
B0089LOG02|3.0|I gave the novel Orphan Train, by Christina Baker Kline, three stars because everything was predictable.  It read like a Nancy Drew novel.  It was more appropriate for a teenager than a women's book club.
B00DMK6WN4|3.0|The original 2001 \\"Monsters Inc\\" is my favorite Disney/Pixar film to date.  It would have won the best Animated Film Oscar if it was NOT for \\"Shrek\\".<br /><br />When I learned they were making this film I was looking forward to it.<br /><br />Man, what a disappointment .<br /><br />I can go with the storyline for a prequel.  Would have rather have seen a continuing story of what happened after they opened the new company with laughs.<br /><br />I do not have a problem with the story where is question is where are the laughs?<br /><br />I laughed only a few times in this film.  Besides Mike & Sulley we see Randall & a for a brief bit at the end of the film the Abominable Snowman briefly from the first film.  Otherwise, they were just throwing new monsters at us with only 2 making it into/from the first film.  Too much.<br /><br />Positive, the color on the blu ray is great.<br /><br />Extras, nothing special.<br /><br />Something I thought was strange in this package, a 3D disc, 2 blu rays & 1 DVD.  The DVD was where the blu ray with extras SHOULD have been.<br /><br />If you are a fan you can buy this but do not be surprised this film does NOT have the fun & magic of the first film.

B00FVS4EUI|4.0|The quality of the video was high, and the plot line of this episode was good. It's the first episode of Season 4, and it sets the stage for some creepy things to happen. Months have passed in relative happiness since Season 3 ended, but it's clear that all the characters are going to be tested in new ways this season.

B008RYN44U|3.0|I love No Doubt and have all of their CD's.  This one only has a few stand out tracks and the rest are pretty bland.  It was more on the disappointing side as an album goes.  As someone said, \\"maybe they took too much time off that it stripped them of creativity.\\"  Maybe the'll put out another album in the future and it'll be killer.  This one I'd say is just okay.  It's not bad, but it's not fantastic either.

B00BD99JMW|1.0|This book was an extreme disappointment. There were so many plot holes and it was incredibly difficult to detect the difference between the two POVs. It was extremely anti-climatic in many places and often people acted out of character. Also, Veronica's theory on how the factions came to be was interesting but after a while it was simply boring and repetitive. The ending was absolutely horrible. It feels like she was in a rush to end the book and Tris' death seemed pointless to me. It makes no sense that I spent two books falling in love with Tris only to have one of my favorite characters ripped away in order to create an element of shock. If she had to die, she definitely deserved more than a couple of pages and for her killer to be able to completely forget what he did and continue to live freely. On top of that, Tris was seen as nothing more than a rebel against the government by the end, instead of a strong young girl who scarified so much for the greater good. Tobias' grief afterwards was the most painful part, I hated reading those pages. By the end of the book, I was disappointed, heartbroken, and incredibly anger. I became invested in a character who was carelessly killed off for no purpose. For a horrible second, I was regretful I had started the trilogy in the first place. Now, I plan to ignore the existence of this last, terrible book and not let it ruin the first two gems for me. I definitely regret reading this book and wish I had known ahead of time how bad it would be so I could avoid it at all costs.

0375842209|5.0|This was the most imaginative book that I have read in a long time.  The prose was super creative.  I have never read a book written in a style like this one.  Learning about life in Nazi times in Germany for its' poor people was interesting.
0670024856|2.0|Recently I have made use of what I learned decades ago, back when people were in awe of then-President John F. Kennedy's skills as a very rapid reader. In college we were offered \\"speed reading\\" classes. And recently I have found that those skills are easily recaptured. This book is so overly written, in marked contrast, for example, to the power of Alice McDermott's latest, \\"Someone.\\"<br />I had read the reader reviews here and now wish I had paid more attention to the ones with one and two stars. The central character, Alma, has lived a rather secluded life, the only child (well, except for the one adopted by her parents, a child that maybe her father sired of the prostitute who bore Prudence) of a very wealthy Henry Whittaker who has established a large estate in Philadelphia and has accumulated much wealth. Alma is fascinated by flora and become a botanist who publishes. Her specialty becomes mosses. There is a large indoor botanical garden on White Acres (belonging to the \\"Whittakers\\"!) patterned after the one George III had created for his enjoyment back in England where Henry was born.<br />Along comes Ambrose with his orchid lithographs, and the plot thickens. But I won't be a spoiler except to say that it seems that every novelist and short story writer cannot resist putting homosexuals in their works. (Don't panic! I'm not a homophobe! I actually am a homosexual who believes that sometimes these situations are now contrived to meet the increased public support for those of us who are gay.)<br />This book needed a heavy hand at editing it, to use the language of a botanist, a \\"pruning.\\" A big pruning. There are factual errors. For example, on page 223 (there are 499 of them, and thankfully not 500!) the author has a palm tree \\"cut back.\\" It was growing too tall in the enclosure. I live in Miami Beach, and anyone knows that when palm trees are \\"topped\\" they die. Then there is 48-year-old Prudence, married for 30 years but with a swarm of small children. Where was the editor of this novel? Then there's a contradiction between a document Henry had Alma sign (this relates to Ambrose). But when he dies--how thankful I was when the author finally killed him off at 91--that document and his will are at odds. And there are plenty more problems like that.<br />So if you like a thick book that looks nice--and this one does--and you can practice you skimming skills, then I recommend this one. But if you want a well-written book, then look elsewhere.e was the editor of this novel? Then there's a contradiction between a document Henry had Alma sign (this relates to Ambrose).

0783231032|2.0|Quite possibly the longest movie I have ever sat through. That doesn't mean it is terrible. There are some genuinely funny moments and Slim Pickens inhabits most of them. This is Spielberg thru-and-thru. His talent, vision and fingerprints are all over it, but it needed a comedic genius that wasn't there. Add to any collection for the sake of Spielberg alone, but &#34;classic&#34;, I think not.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Just plug it in to a TV HDMI port, power it up, install Chromecast on your Chrome browser and it is ready to use.  There were no glitches.  I even use it from my iPhone4S.  Our grandson likes to watch Pluto cartoons on YouTube.  Anything that you can display in your browser, you can watch on your big screen TV.  I also use it to stream Amazon MyPrime movies. The operation of Chromecast  is very simple.
B0074MZSWW|4.0|Loved the group when I first heard them.  The singer is very unique.  This CD has a good selection and variety of music on it.  Lively and fun.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|I absolutely hate it when a filmmaker or director splits a long story into more than one film, even though I see the necessity of doing so with Tolkein's stories--they are just too much story for one film. Still, I really wish this one had come out closer to its next installment--waiting so long to see the ending is just hard to take. Peter Jackson has faithfully reproduced the feel and the atmosphere of the novel, and I loved the depiction of the dwarfs. He got it right--just as he did with Lord of the Rings. But waiting for the rest is hard. Very hard. I don't think most fans will find much to complain about.

B00BGZ8TVA|5.0|This is flat-out one of the most beautifully photographed films I've ever seen. Not only that, it has a profound message about faith, God, and the stories and myths we believe in order to achieve such beliefs. I didn't expect that when I sat down to watch it, and it was a lovely surprise. Watch it with an open mind and an open heart. It's a truly beautiful film that will stay with you for a long time.

B00BAXFDLM|5.0|This multi-layered story weaves finely-drawn personalities, rebellion, religion, brutality,  humor, music and angst into  - well, Scalzi said it best - a &#34;compelling and very cool&#34; story.  I'm not sure that I can do it justice, no pun intended.<br /> &#34;What does it mean to be human?&#34; is the question that permeates and propels the narrative.  Is one human if she was a ship and now has only one human body? If she has many bodies? If she cares for others, or is a conniving oligarch?<br /> &#34;Ancillary&#34; is defined as  &#34;a subordinate part or element &#34;.  The protagonist is ancillary to the Radchaai, an empire bent on conquest and  &#34;annexation&#34;. She is also tied into the bodies and brains of her human and &#34;ancillary&#34; (bodies resurrected and amended by tech) soldiers, the whole of them creating the warship Justice of Toren.<br /> When Justice of Toren comes under attack by her own government, one small part of the ship escapes, as an ancillary soldier.  Breq is isolated,  keenly aware of her losses, and out for justice. (The back cover blurb calls her goal &#34;vengeance&#34;, but it's far more convoluted than that.)<br /> Her quest begins with a gravely damaged companion,  acquaintances who impact her in ways that increase her humanity, and a final battle that I had to slow down and re-read (shades of CJ Cherryh's penultimate scenes) to understand.  I think.<br /> Finally, the issue of gender threads itself into the story, and into the consciousness of the reader.  By the end of the tale I hardly noticed - but I'd be interested in hearing if male readers find the same distancing by the use of the female pronoun as I do every day by the ubiquitous use of the male pronoun in US culture.<br /> I was intrigued and challenged by this novel.  Every once in a while I thought that the author had thrown in every huge issue it was possible to explore.  I'll be re-reading it - while I drool for the sequels.

I went into this book thinking there was no way it could live up to all the praise I have heard lavished upon it. I was wrong, on so many levels. I'm thankful that I decided to read this classic mystery, and I'm also happy that I didn't watch the film version first.

B006GHA9VQ|5.0|Great storyline with twists, portrayal of human nature on beauty/ugliness, and European style ending.  It almost lost me at the beginning, for it seemed a little too long for setting the framework and begin to develop the story, but it get better and better as the production progresses.  The viewer should see the Phantom of the Opera (i.e. 25th Anniversary Show recommended) before watching this production to grasp the inter-relationships of the main characters and to appreciate the new sequential storyline built on the Phantom.  Truly enjoyable and highly recommended.  I'm well pleased to own one.

It incorporated high-tech theatrical features for the actual audience, using many concerts and theatrical experts.  You'll be to enjoy some of that as a viewer of this blu-ray disk.  Since you'll get to see close-up shots from angles the professionals selected, you can watch, listen, and feel the demonstrated emotions by the performers better than in person.  At the end, you will get to see the original cast, and hear some of them sing.  Everything about this production was just fantastic and outstanding.  If you like Broadway shows, this is a must have item.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Very good app. It tell me everything I need to watch. The radar is great. I can zoom in to see home and work.
B0076DELIG|2.0|I've read a lot of the Bosch novels and generally they are 3.5-4 star, decent reads with logical and interesting twists and competent endings that follow from the action. This particular book, without spoilers, is the kind of magic-hat facile ending that makes me irritated I had read the preceding 300 pages. A long, simplistic description of action with the single purpose of Harry leaving a set of footprints, by which he is identified. He might just as well have written &#34;Hey presto!&#34; and skipped the last 50 pages for an ending of equal quality. Facile, illogical, entirely unlikely even in a genre that thrives on the improbable. Cardboard characters with an actual &#34;evil grin&#34; (I mean, seriously, &#34;evil grin&#34; Mike? Geez...) and a last second shuffle of bad guys. Skip this one.
B005LAIII0|5.0|This is such a great movie!  The filming was done so well.  The actors are also chosen very well.  If you haven't seen this movie you should add it to your to-watch list!!
B005LLSZNM|5.0|All I can say is O-M-G!  I love this series and it keeps getting better with each season.  I highly recommend this series!
B008CJ0JTI|5.0|This movie is awesome.  I don't know why it is not more popular amongst fans.  It is truly a well made movie with a great cast!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|As I read the last page... I have a moment of silence for the divergent series.<br />I was legitlly on the verge of tears, I mean my MOST favorite series came to an end!!!<br />Then as I thought I was sitting there thinking.. \\"wow all these people rating this book one star because of the outcome of the book. And because of them... I almost DIDN'T read it\\".<br />Well I have to tell, any person who is reading this. Take it in your best interest to read this book. It will show you how emotionally attached you have become to these characters. But it will then make you giddy with excitement for the movie!!!<br />And my final words for the final comment on this series will be this....<br />I have become braver by reading this. In more ways than one. This book has made me wise, intellectual, and has made me look at life in a different perspective, view, and light..<br />So thank you Veronica. And R.I.P to Tris, Marlene, Uriah, Tori, Mr. And Mrs. Prior, to all the Abnegation, Dauntless, Euridite, AND Candor, to the many Divergent, and lastly... to this series which I will miss with all my being.<br />I just hope Tobias can recover with the loss of Tris. :'(
0399159347|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read for a long time!  The plot ended up shocking me; I don't know how she thinks of these things!  I also appreciate the author's insight into marriage and relationships; it is very authentic.  I am telling everyone about this book and all of Liane Moriary's books.  I love them!
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|This is a somber look into the lives of a SEAL team. It tries to be realistic. Missions on short notice. Missed communications. Blown entry or ex-filtrations. It does demonstrate how special teams are trained and equipped to allow a small number to put out an overwhelming volume of concentrated fire on an adversary. It's nice that they show that they work in conjunction with intel and the \\"Special Boat Squadrons\\" to do some serious butt kicking! Their scenarios range from malaria infested jungles, arid high elevation deserts and strange foreign urban environments. But things can go wrong and people do die. That's just business for these guys. They are good. Occasionally the bad guys are good too..... Buy it! Don't bootleg this one! Honor these guys, who make it possible for us to sleep at night without worry.<br />This one brings a tear to my eyes. Don't get me wrong! It don't drip, it just wells up and sits there!
B005MLOKXA|5.0|I am part way through the 2nd season of &#34;The Good Wife&#34; and let me just say I really enjoy it. The characters are very easy to follow and their mannerisms are identifiable. I will continue to watch this series
B00C5R8364|1.0|VERY BORING READING. THE ACTION GOT STARTED WAY TOO LATE AND THE START WAS BORING AND UNINTERESTING.NOT ENOUGH ACTION.. SLOW.
B003ES61EE|1.0|Awful. Cap would not stay on. Like, critical malfunction. I bought four of them, they each had this problem, might as well be a one time/disposable product. Lame.
B006LSZECO|3.0|A very strange read, not my usual genre. Read it as part of a book club at work. It was very well written I just couldn't identify with any of the characters. Different.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I've read every book in this series and can't wait for the latest one to arrive. Pendergast never fails to please!
B00GD9F59S|5.0|This book was so beautifully written and was a wonderful conclusion to this series. Though the ending was not what I expected I loved it !! Aiden is a character that everyone has no choice but to fall in love with and I love to see how Alex has matured book to book! An excellent read a do me that will leave you satisfied with a smile on your face in the end.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|The graphics and controls are awesome . Let alone that games have come along way from what  it use to be.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Best book I have read in a long time· This book has it all, humor<br />, love, and sadness. It was wonderful.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Wow what a page turner this one is.  Spoiler alert, I never saw a lot of this coming.  I would have liked a little different ending but enjoyed this one as well.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|Cruise delivers a star performance as expected. He never gives any less. It's all here: great story, action and the unexpected. Great sci-fi.  Recommended watch.
B000H7J9RQ|4.0|Good Music
B003G4W49C|5.0|Even if I disagree with many of the author's views on society (outside of his books), Ender's game is really a great story. I never got bored and liked it so much that I'm reading the Speaker for the Dead now. I understand why this book got the Hugo and Nebula awards. Highly recommended!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love this app. I use it everyday. It makes my work and life so much easier. I used to keep stacks and stacks of notebooks. I can now keep and organize all of my thoughts all in one place!
B000OZ0NXA|2.0|A man was thrown into the plot so so speak. Conveniently, he was allowed to assist the police in their investigations. He committed murders, some not quite described as self defence. There was a lot of violence (with no repercussions) by a &#34;common man&#34;. The cold blooded bad guys killed extremely violently in some instances but in another, kept 2 persons alive and simply asked they to shovel stuff around.  Maybe it's just me - this is not really my thing.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Another great story from a great storyteller! I couldn't stop reading, even to watch my favorite football team play. Fantastic book.
B00AB65SVE|5.0|I love this show.  It's a great series about family, albeit less than traditional family in this series!  A lot of people say the story is a bit repetitive, but I find that is a good thing.  Too often sitcoms have tried to change too much and suffered as a result.  Other times series changed, ratings improved, but upon re-watching, fans notice the comedy lowers and the tension and drama increase (look at you, Friends).  But despite similar stories, the interactions and writing are all very nice and fresh.<br /><br />I especially liked the homage to The Godfather.  Probably one of my favorite Modern Family episodes yet!<br /><br />The new baby doesn't really change anything, but it does create a bit more room for the writers to work in jokes about Gloria and Jay.  \\"His initials would be: F.U. Pritchett...\\"<br /><br />The biggest improvement I feel is in the character Lily.  She's old enough now (not sure if it is a different actress, but probably) to have some humorous dialogue.  I think it adds a lot to the Cam - Mitchell comedy and interaction.  Love it!<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Really enjoyed this book... Very interesting.. And keep me on the edge of my seat wondering what was going to happen next to the children, and Jacob :)
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Get this game not dragonstory because that is just a ripoff version of this game.get this game best of the free games
B00AB7HESI|4.0|its okay but glitchey and its a near exact copy of super scribblenauts. i do like it anyway. it should have more objects and the SN unlimited system for adjectives.
B002SSUQFG|1.0|Watch stops every 10 hors. Very difficult to pul the stem out reset the watch. Operating instructions are very difficult to understand. I guess this is what to expect from a $59 watch.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|Appp it is so fun when it's counting down and I LUVV the way it takes my cute cute photes
B000FC2L1Y|4.0|Another great read.  I really enjoyed character development of Roger & Brianna.  I am looking forward to starting FIREY  CROSS  today, can't wait to see what's next for the inhabitants of Fraser Ridge.
B0063M22QO|3.0|not enough choices to move between levels of difficulty. also would like to see more variety for tile design so it doesn't get boring.
B000I8G5C6|5.0|Will Smith is so absolutely expressive in everything he does, and of course Eva is BREATHTAKINGLY beautiful as well as a fantastic actress. I've seen this three times now and the third time was JUST as funny as the first two.
B00D28TNT6|5.0|I agree with the reviewer who made the BoC comparison. This is immediate, frenzied, agipop. Volume up. In the dark.
B0035XVVDY|5.0|AMAZING! Great action GREAT actors, suspense, thrills, intrigue, and action. We loved every moment of this movie and the ending was PERFECT.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Compact, light weight and just what I wanted for plane traveling. Highly recommend if you are looking for a comfortable set of headphones
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|When I first saw my older sister playing this game, I thought it was just like another one I saw, but when I played it.....it was SO MUCH BETTER! I started playing online on my mom's facebook (because I didn't have a facebook nor an ipad/iphone) in the beginning of summer, and I was hooked! It became even more fun when they finally got in on Kindle do I can play it on the go! The levels are so fun to play, and the game as a whole is even more fun when you're racing against your friends. I would DEFINITELY recommend this game to everyone who needs a fun little break from everything going on, or even someone who enjoys a little competition. The cute little graphics are even child friendly, too! In summation, you NEED to buy this awesome game, it's free!!! :D
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|It has a lot of stuff you can do<br />You can suck blood and do cool things and evil vampires
B000FO0AOC|5.0|Had some songs I had never heard before, but fell in love with... I purchased it because A friend sang Chained and Bound to me and I just had to have CD.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|That would would be everyone.<br />Great read. One of those books you don't want the journey to end. Have faith in the journey.
B003F44QRQ|4.0|I consider this a possible Vampire classic. The casting was brilliant and  considered &#34;The Hottest&#34; Stars of their time. Although Cory Haim is no longer with us, his performance in this film shows what he could have had.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|Everyone concerned with their health should read this book. It is backed by science and makes a lot of sense.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|Easy to use. Like the title option. Would like it if volume of alarm could be adjustable while keeping the gradual increase as I am somewhat hard of hearing.<br />Maggie
B006P73TAA|4.0|It really wasn't the sellers fault, but there seem to be some technical problems with this recording that I wasn't aware of -- poor mike placement resulting in very uneven volume among the singers.  Some passages are so faint they are nearly inaudible at a &#34;normal&#34; listening level.
B0062KMDZ2|1.0|Not a good movie! It had poor acting and poor screen play. I would not recommend for anyone over 11 years old.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I am a Trekie  & like ALL the Star Trek shows  this is a very good movie; recommend  it to every one
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|This is probably the best book that exists.  Buy two. Maybe three, just to be safe.<br /><br />My boyfriend made fun of all the faces I made as I read it.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Was waiting for the kindle version.Only thing missing is the boosters. Rest is great. Please fix so that boosters can be used here. Thanks!
B00BOUL9DM|4.0|You know how there's always that one game that you continuously go back to? Well, this is one of them. I will definitely be playing this one many times!
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Excellent writing; I am 66 and still practicing law; a lot of what she said is so true; I think it is a great resource for women in the workplace
B00192IV9U|4.0|There is some skepticism about whether all of the songs on this album were actually recorded by Michael himself or an imitator, and that is really the only thing holding this back from getting 5 stars, but regardless the songs are good.
B007HM2G3S|5.0|ITS SO GOOD MY SYLVANIANS GO TO CAMPING WITH IT THE FAMILIY I PUT IS GINGER CAT FAMILIY SO SO GOOD
B00005QGAT|5.0|A great classic album from the Great King of Pop Michael Jackson! Any Michael Jackson or music fan should have this essential album in their collection of great music. Off the Wall will bring you back to the good ol' days of disco or if you weren't alive during the disco era it will help give you a feeling that you were a part of it. Whether you're young or old I highly recommend this album.
030789701X|5.0|A design masterpiece, no doubt about it. The amount of lore and illustration is amazing, I'm still reading it and loving the game more than ever, this is a book every Skyrim player should have in their shelves. One of the most impressive guides ever made!
B001XV3LSS|3.0|OK, just not a great movie. I suggest looking at a better movie with a better plot. This review will save you time.
B00G32OER4|5.0|Scariest movie I have seen in a long time!  Don't watch this movie alone!  It will make you jump!  SCARY!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|IIt's so cool get pocketinvpro with it you mine you craft best app ever :/<br />Join people I wonder when we will get 0.8.0
B008JFUR10|5.0|An homage to the monsters vs robots movies/shows of old.  Beautifully directed and produced.  Here's hoping to seeing more of Pacific Rim in the future!<br /><br />If there is an extended edition to show other Jaegers that'd be glorious.  But as it is, it's still a very good flick.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This was wicked fun , I love the voice for the game. This is wick addict I love it though. It's an easy game, little kids will love it
B0064X79JC|4.0|This is a novella. A quick read, very very enjoyable and well done. Interesting and descriptive descriptions of specific driving sequences. Dark in places and a little gory. Definitely different from the movie but not so much that it bothered me as the origins of the film are very clear in this piece. If you're even thinking you might want to read this book I suggest buying it.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I loved this story. How he brought old terrifying characters back to life along with new ones. Stephen King never fails to amaze me! I would definitely read again!
0062255657|4.0|Typical Gaiman and true to the origins of the fairytale in that he mixes darkness with light and reminds us just how children see the world and are seen in it. Wonderful characters. Probably not appropriate (too scary) for younger children but should be fine for middle school and up. Does include monsters and a suicide reference. Definitely darker than Stardust and Neverwhere.
B003REEPJS|1.0|Pleaseeeee... this has been done a hundred, or a thousand, or a million times before... just re-creating the past but not any better at doing it...  I'm sorry.  of course she's not any worse then the male versions also doing the same thing that was done a hundred, thousand, million times before...
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Makes you think a bit, but doesn't make you want to rage quit. Good game to play to clear your head. Need more levels asap!
B009WUAK2M|3.0|Not what I would consider a good movie but there were some entertaining scenes. As expected the dialog was a classic &#34;Stallone&#34; script.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I could not put this book down. Read it in one day! A surprise ending kept me guessing. John Grisham at his best!
B00BEYX7TW|3.0|kind of a slow moving movie. Parts were good in the story, but kind of a boring feel to it.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Every time a new Grisham book is in the works, I can't wait for the release.  John Grisham knows how to write.  He knows how to plan the plot and all of the intricacies necessary to grab you, pull you in, and keep you wanting more.  His books are meant for pure entertainment and he delivers each time.  Sycamore Row may have been a bit predictable, but so what?  The story will keep you thinking about it long after you are finished - that is the sign of a great writer.  I am a big fan of television, but every time a new Grisham book comes out, the TV goes off until I am finished.  If you are a lover of a great tale and a fan of John Grisham, then you have to read Sycamore Row.  It is fantastic.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Veronica Roth had an incredible opportunity to wrap up this trilogy in a very creative way. Instead, she introduced a brand new storyline that was so boring it was hard to keep reading. If she wanted to kill off a main character, that's fine- but do it right. JK Rowling killed off her characters with meaning, she didn't rush a death just to be shocking. It's clear Veronica Roth didn't have an actual gameplan when she wrote this book. To be honest, this was the worst third book in the history of trilogies. I almost wish I didn't waste my time.
B003O86FMW|4.0|While I enjoyed the first book in this series too, this one was my personal favorite between the two. Looking forward to the third & final book on this series.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|We've had this bag for almost a year now and it has held up well through a lot of travel. This bag is just the perfect size for organizing and carrying all our gear — not too big, not too little.
B00BAXFAOW|4.0|I've read all of Malcolm Gladwell's books.  This one is just as interesting, well-written, and thought-provoking.  I was a little disappointed in the Northern Ireland story however, as it really wasn't particularly enlightening.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I definitely recommend to anybody who wants to learn a new language! It is very thorough and easy to learn through Duolingo!
B005IS565S|5.0|This band is doing great things and I am looking forward to future albums from them. Great work and I can't wait for they'er next one.
B00G4CXHSK|3.0|4 chapters with some-what sort levels. I like how there are a ton of guns and unique costumes to use (costumes aren't purely cosmetic, they increase health) but it's quite a grind to raise the money to buy them all. That being said, Game play is simple yet enjoyable to play. The one glaring flaw of the game is lack of content, I think once they add more chapters to play or maybe even add a multiplayer, It'd be a much better game. I'd still recommend it though, It's well worth checking out.
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|Best album and great lyrics. Alice in Chains never disappoints the fan base. I throughly enjoyed every song on this album
B00BRUQ3PS|5.0|A great payoff on the trilogy. Just delightful, elegant and simple in the same breath. Superb. Well worth the wait.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|The intire album is great and the three bonus songs are great as well. i was disappointed in receiving the jewel case in the condition i received it in
B0037EAJAC|5.0|RAN is a Movie epic...Based in Feudal Japan, the story to the cast is exceptional, with each scene and character portrayal a joy to behold, RAN is an easy 5 star rating, a MUST See!!
B008K9SG9K|5.0|Imagine Dragons has a promising career. The album is great. I was unhappy with the condition of the jewel case, because I received it cracked.
B004EPZ08E|5.0|Totally Hilarious - What a funny Movie...the vulgarity is a tad bit over done, but the story and acting make this a 5 star attraction...YOU are going to laugh your A-- OFF!!
B0030B621W|5.0|For those of you who can't deal with movies that don't contain: one-line wise cracks, sexual cat & mouse play, shots fired, running/chasing, yelling, romantic syrup, etc., then DON'T watch this.  Stop reading now and move on.<br />For the rest of you, who can be stimulated solely by the cinematic exploration of a popular sci-fi theme, then check this out.  You should be entertained by it.
B007KW5N9Y|5.0|A Steven Spielberg Master Piece!!! The story line is based in occupied China, on J. G. Ballard's semi-autobiographical novel this movie is a marvel to behold...A young Christian Bale makes his movie debut, with  John Malkovich, Miranda Richardson, and Nigel Havers in supporting excellent roles!!  Easy 5 out of 5 star rating, this movie is a must have for any Movie Buff!!
B00F91RYL8|4.0|I thought that this was pretty good.  It's not monumental, but it's well crafted as far as the standard thriller format goes.  It does a good job of making one want to see what happens next, even though, overall, you know generally how things are going to wind up at the end.
B00B4804KS|5.0|Jurassic Park in 3D off the charts!! Ranked as the thirteenth highest grossing film worldwide on all time, Jurassic Park is another Spielberg masterpiece! With Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum and Richard Attenborough, ( lets not forget Samuel L. Jackson as a Computer Geek ), this movie is a must see in 3D!!!
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|Awesome this app is extremely pleasing i would recommend it to everyone else in the world i have a great love for it
B008HE9TVW|4.0|I have seen better 3D movies, but generally speaking both titles are fun entertainment...4 out of 5 stars, ONLY because the 3D imagery was marginal
B00AA0U05A|5.0|bought this for my86 yr old dad, he absolutely loved it ! Emmy has a beautiful voice and does a wonderful job with all these sentimental oldies.
B00F30S0Y0|2.0|I loved the last two albums, but this ones was a big disappointment.  But I have to give them credit for trying something different and being consistent with that.  I only like two songs:  Reflektor and Afterlife.  The later sounds like classic AF and would of fit in on any of the other albums.  They pull the trick again where they bury one of the best songs at the end of the album.  Just like Sprawl - Mountains beyond Mountains was at the end of the last album and that song is my favorite AF song ever.<br /><br />Alas, two really good songs out of 13 does not a great album make.  I really, really wanted to like it.  Its a shame we'll have to wait 3 more years for new material.
B000002LIM|4.0|it just arrived without the album cover however the Cd still works so i am still happy i can always print off another cover

B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|a fabulous gaming experience.  I am devout video game puzzler who got hooked with myst.  I have kept right on solving.  it has been awhile since I have encountered such a clever game as this.  I do not want to stop playing.  if you buy this game you are getting a big bang for your buck and so much more.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love the game. My kindle is not as fun as my pc, cause the screen is fairly small, but still I can indulge my addiction
B00CNQ7HAU|1.0|Author puts forth his liberal view on how racial injustice should be addressed and payback handled for the mistreatment of blacks in the past. The rural south is also portrayed in a negative manner.
1451666179|5.0|It is okay to put this book down occasionally. Serious consequences may occur if you do not. Your laundry may pile up, your pets and loved ones may feel abandoned, and worst if all your face may crack in half from all the laughter. No one wants to see that. The sick and twisted and fans of her blog (same thing really) will enjoy this book. If you are not already aware that you are one of the above, flee now before you discover the truth.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Been waiting for it to show up on kindle fire to see what all the fuss is shot, it's true, it's fun and addictive
B00846REIS|3.0|like the book , on book 2 ... my fav characters  so far r  cary and gid , eva too whiney for me.
078322947X|5.0|A classic.This is the most under rated movie ever. Don't believe me? Ask Rodger Ebert. Great characters. Awesome cinematography. And Tangerine dream soundtrack. This is the last blast of 1970's anti Hollywood.
B00B0LPYXG|1.0|This was the poorest i've seen Mr washington! Don Cheadle was great with the material he was given to work with as were others, but the presentation and development of the story was juvenile.  Should maybe have been titlled \\"A Drunk Pi;ot who Finds AA.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Yay finally.  Couldn't wait.  So glad its here.  I'm super addicted .  Now i can play with the rest of my family and friends<br /><br />.
0446614459|5.0|What more can I say about David Baldacci book?  I have purchased many of his book.  They are all so very good.  I have one left to review and see no need in reviewing another one of his books.  This is nothing more to be said about just how great they are.
B008Y7BE7E|5.0|I was just expecting a spoof zombie comedy but this is way better than any other zombie movie.  The way the characters interact with each other is what seperates this movie.  My wife who hates zombie movies loves this movie and was asking to watch it again.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is a very well written story.  I completely bought into the premise and was hooked from the get go.  Compelling characters and an interesting plot.  I highly recommend it!

B00BD99JMW|1.0|I was SO disappointed with this entire book. The whole idea of Edith Prior's world was so intriguing but I felt as though we were tricked by what the world outside the fence really was. And everything else went downhill from there...the hopes we had for Tris, Tobias, and all the other characters never came to a satisfying end. I have never been so disappointed with an author in my life.

0393317552|1.0|When I started reading Diamond's curious tome, I came upon the part where he was talking to his New Guinea friend Yali. So Yali asks Diamond why Europeans have so much \\"cargo\\" and his, Yali's people, don't. Diamond says he's puzzled too, because it certainly can't be because Europeans are smarter. In fact, asserts Diamond, he's convinced New Guineans are as smart or smarter than Europeans. He knows this how? Because New Guineans flash charisma and energy. And of course those  Europeans don't flash any charisma and energy.  They're just a bunch of lucky dopes who were fortunate enough to live in lands that basically handed them all their ill-gotten riches simply by virtue of geography. Inherent mental abilities had nothing to do with European dominance over primitive peoples.<br />And so after just a few pages my teeth were set on edge, but I grimly read on determined to wade through Diamond's extraordinary reasons (some of them valid..some utter bs) as to why Europeans invaded the geographically unfortunate peoples of the world and not vice versa. Diamond returns to this question many times: why were the Euros able to invade the lands of remote peoples of the world, and the remote peoples didn't invade Europe? Actually, that's one of a number of false assertions by Diamond. The Mongols invaded and conquered much of Asia and Europe. They left no improvement on the advance of civilization other than new ways to slaughter millions. Why, in a magnanimous gesture, Diamond even mentions the Mongols. But they don't count.<br /><br />Much of what Diamond writes about as far as civilizations developing is true. Lot's of people lived in areas that made it easier to develop machines and better methods of food cultivation than other countries. But too often Diamond goes into excruciating detail about certain plant methods, or DNA, or other avenues of development or undevelopment. I arrived at the conclusion that Diamond could have presented his basic thesis, even all the east-west, north-south theories in a lot less words. He could have written his main arguments in under one hundred pages. So guess what?...I skipped a lot of his overwrought explanations, and saved myself some time. In short, Diamond delivered a history lesson about many people that was either too long-winded or totally irrelevant to his argument.<br /><br />So why is Diamond's main thesis a bunch of bull hockey? Well, even if you agree that many advanced civilizations owe their beginnings and developments in science, food growth, military hardware, and many other manifestations of a superior culture to good fortune, they did not or could not hide their advances from other peoples. If one nation or group of people with enough on the ball sees what's going on in another country or civilization, they pick it up. They then use that info for themselves bettering their own civilization.<br />So what is stopping Yali's people, the New Guineans, from picking up the knowledge of the European or superior Asian countries and using it for themselves. Why is sub-Sarahan Africa basically one huge disaster area? Obviously in typical leftist fashion, Diamond dismisses any talk of genetic superiority being responsible for Euro (and now east-Asian) dominance over the benighted peoples of the world. Only geography (and disease) made it possible for Euros to subdue those equally intelligent denizens of the remote areas.<br />But then why, if they now have the means to improve their societies and their countries, don't all the spectacularly backwards peoples of the world take this advanced info and transform themselves? Why, it just can't be genetic inferiority  which only nasty, racists claim is behind the whole thing asserts Diamond. Diamond is essentially arguing the tabula rasa or blank slate theory of humans, a theory very popular among leftists in the sixties but since thoroughly discredited. According to the blank slaters, humans are all born with nothing in their cranium. All intelligence is learned, little or nothing is inherited. It's astonishing to hear these same people claim that humans are nothing more than animals, and then state they're the only animals born without instinct or inherited intelligence. Diamond is not unaware of the many tests taken by reputable scientists, including esteemed scientist James Watson  of the Watson-Crick duo who disovered the double helix. All these scientists have arrived at the same conclusion: most intelligence is inherited, and some people and groups have more than others. On average. But they're all just nasty racists according to Diamond.<br /><br />A much better and more important question that someone should write a book about is not whether certain peoples of the world have more on the ball than others, but how did some peoples on average come to have more on the ball than others. Why did the Chinese of mainland China come to a major player on the world scene after centuries of grinding poverty for their many millions? Before the Deng Xoa Peng China was mired in a corrupt communist system with basically enslaved the Chinese people and bound them to an economic system that ensured their poverty and many times famines. Then Mao croaks, Peng takes over and introduces a market system, and China in the very short space of 30 plus years in now the second largest economic power in the world and threatening to overtake the U.S. which has decided with the election of Obama that Marxism is not so bad after all. According to Diamond, China, despite have a  superior culture to many Euro countries for hundreds of years, should still be a backwater. Why were the Chinese people able to transform their country from a backward state into a superpower. Could it be the IQs of the average Chinese was pretty large and freed from communism the Chinese were able to take advantage of market techniques? Nah..that can't be it says Diamond. That would be racist.<br /><br />Again, why are all the countries of the world populated by black people so poor and destitute. Many African countries were European colonies at one point. The Europeans displaced many of the barbaric customs and practices of the black people they ruled over and replaced them with Euro customs. Then the Euros decided colonization (and improving the lives of millions of black people) was bad, and left or were kicked out. Now many of those black African countries are reverting back to their primitive societies and are busy creating another hell on earth for their peoples. In the western hemisphere, Haiti is an example of an all-black country doomed to failure. Why is that so? Are evil western countries keeping the secrets of modern civilization and science hid from the Haitians? Of course not. Could it be the Haitians (and many other virtually all-black countries) are just not smart enough or just too stupid to take advantage of what is being offered or given to them? Nah, that can't be it....that's the racist answer says Diamond with smug assurance backed by throngs of other equally smug leftists afraid of drawing the right conclusion (some people are smarter than other people) and losing their place among the \\"enlightened\\" people of the world. Near the end of the book Diamond actually states that if the situation were reversed and the Aboriginal people of Australia swapped places with the white people of certain Euro countries, the Abos would start to resemble the white people and their culture, and the white Euros would eventually resort to the primitive lives of the Abos. What collection of fruitcakes believes this hokum?<br /><br />If simply moving people from backwards countries into advanced countries (Diamond professes to not really know what an advanced society is), then why don't the black Africans have similar rates of success as Europeans? In any country on the earth you can name that has a mixture of white Euros, east Asians, and people of black African descent, the latter will be on the bottom. They'll have the lowest educational and job/career achievements and the highest rates of crime and dependence of the government. There are approximately 16,000 school districts in the U.S. There is not one of them with appreciable numbers of black students where the black students are equal to or ahead of white or Asian students. What does that suggest to you? Do you really believe every school district is racist and trying to keep knowledge of success away from non-white/Asian students? You have to be an ignoramus of the first rank (or a fraud like Diamond) to believe in the idea that superior IQ is not relevant and the main reason why people from Europe conquered non-white peoples and not vice-versa.<br /><br /> And laughably Diamond, like all leftists, contemptuously dismisses many great military leaders by simply asserting that they owed their victories more to disease that military tactics. Yes, I'm sure Robert E. Lee owed his spectacular success in the first two years of the American civil war to those Yankees just falling dead from disease rather than Lee's and Stonewall Jackson's military expertise. Hitler wasn't defeated by superior arms...he and the rest of his army just died from the sniffles. It certainly wasn't the overwhelming military superiority of the Allies by the end of the war. So many howlers in this book and statements of \\"fact\\" that are really nothing more than Diamond's personal, and unsubstantiated by facts opinions. It's simply his attempts to keep his name in good standing with the other leftist frauds of the world...of which there are many.ted by black people so poor and destitute.

READ THE EXPERT OPINIONS DELIVERED BY THE TEAM OF LEARNED CONTRIBUTORS TO THIS IMPORTANT BOOK<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />`The primary objectives in containing a financial crisis are first, simply to stop it and second, to minimize adverse impacts on the real economy.'  When it comes to financial crisis -- including the GFC global financial crisis - this statement quoted by the authors in the preface to this book, more or less says it all. Certainly it is a succinct expression of what this recent book from Edward Elgar Publishing is all about.<br /><br />Based on their detailed and extensive research on financial crises, the authors, in their words, set about to `examine the response to the crisis, with particular reference to the extensive use that has been made of the government guarantees in private financial markets and the impact that those guarantees have had on sovereign debt.'<br /><br />Certainly, the three authors are amply well qualified to accomplish this task and to lend considerable authority to it.  John Raymond LaBrosse, for example, like his co-authors who hold equally dazzling CVs, offers a broad range of expertise based both on economics and law. With directorships in numerous Canadian financial institutions, he led the reform for two major revisions of the Canadian Bank Act and several other pieces of financial legislation - we count seven - including the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Act - and has advised numerous other countries worldwide, including the UK, on the design of deposit insurance systems.<br /><br />This is all rather interesting in view of the ways and means by which Canada, more successfully than any other nation, managed to weather the storms generated by the global financial crisis - and certainly lends further authority to the commentary in the book.<br /><br />The book itself includes papers presented at the Banking Law Symposium organized by its three authors in October 2011 and hosted by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).  This, together with the research findings and policy advice from its thirty learned contributors, make it an authoritative collective statement centering on how to cope with the current global financial crisis, with a view, hopefully, to avoiding more such crises in the future.<br /><br />Lawyers, economists and absolutely everyone interested in, or involved in, or affected by the crises that frequently afflict the global financial services industry should rush out right now and purchase this book.

Certainly in our experience the vast majority of criminal barristers, solicitors and judges have been found to be in possession of it.<br /><br />Since the first edition appeared in 2003, `Banks on Sentence' has come to be regarded as the leading text on all matters connected with sentencing, quickly revealing its superiority over traditional texts which were often less than reliable and not entirely up to date.<br /><br />As the modern statement on this difficult subject, `Banks on Sentence' continues to make its appearance in any number of criminal courts; `a welcome feature on every Crown Court Bench,' as Rafferty LJ has said.  Writing in the `Views' section which prefaces the first volume HHJ Jeff Blackett refers to it as  `a simple guide to the most complicated areas of sentencing', well indexed and logically laid out.<br /><br />`One book,' he adds, `which I can always bank on.'  This of course is only one example of the kudos these volumes have deservedly received.<br /><br />As this book is updated annually, it's important that you acquire the new edition, particularly this one with its wealth of new material, and rigorous re-editing, re-organising and re-writing, particularly following the commencement of many of the provisions of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and  Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 (LAPSO).<br /><br />In addition to the new guidelines from the Sentencing Council, there are paragraphs detailing the position prior to and post-LAPSO where the changes are not yet in force.  Also note that the new edition contains a confiscation chapter about twice as long as that in the seventh edition.<br /><br />We should mention here that the author has suggested that if you have a copy of the old edition, you should retain it, as the new edition refers to old cases in previous editions.<br /><br />For those who prefer electronic media, `Banks' is now available as an eBook across a range of devices via the Thomson Reuters ProView platform and as such, completely replicates the print copy, with cross references and massive index of 6,500 entries.  Additionally, updates are frequently posted on the relevant website and there is a regular `sentencing alert' service on email.<br /><br />To facilitate your further research there are well over 130 pages of tables of cases and statutes in the print edition, followed by a table of rules, plus a detailed index at the back of each volume.<br /><br />In short, this is an authoritative work geared to easy navigation and quick reference - an enormous benefit to practitioners under pressure and, we would say, indispensable for those dealing with criminal justice.

I also plan to read the author's academic articles and will comment following that.  I am not a psychologist but a researcher in physical science so want to read the foundational work just for more background.

B00EUS9JF0|4.0|When I saw a new Paul McCartney CD in stores, I instantly thought, \\"Good grief, ANOTHER McCartney album?\\"  Nothing against being prolific, but still, it seemed like McCartney just HAD a new album, and he IS over 70 by now, but he's showing no signs of slowing down whatsoever.<br /><br />A close look at the sticker on the cover though tries to present a different narrative, informing us that \\"New\\" is his first album of all new material in 6 years.  I don't entirely go for that though, because in the meantime there's also been the Electric Arguments album, which was very much original McCartney material, plus last year's \\"Kisses On The Bottom\\", which may have been marketed as a 'covers' album, but was still a new McCartney album all the same and DID have a smattering of new Macca originals despite being dominated by songs from the Great American Song Book.<br /><br />Obviously, Paul is a musical genius, but he's also incredibly uneven and willful, seemingly a nice perk that comes with having such massive commercial success.  Paul no doubt loves the mind-blowing commercial success, but also takes pleasure in doing whatever he wants and doesn't feel compelled to 'play to his audience' all the time.<br /><br />That said, I had no idea what to expect from \\"New\\", but I am really pleasantly surprised with the results--this is definitely more than just another McCartney record.  I disagree rather strongly with the idea that working with younger producers is an attempt to give McCartney 'currency'.  There's hardly anything that really reeks of electronica--most of the drum parts seem to indeed be REAL drums that sound great.  Frankly, I don't hear this as a particularly 'modern'-sounding recording at all--touches such as the fuzzy guitar on \\"Save Us\\", the Atari-sounding keyboards of \\"Alligator\\", the Mellotron and Rhodes sounds on \\"Queenie Eye\\", and the massively compressed megaphone-style vocals (a la \\"Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey\\") on \\"Get Me Out Of Here\\" strike me as downright retro by the standards of 2013.<br /><br />But retro shouldn't be mistaken for lacking in freshness.  \\"Save Us\\" is a terrific opener, greeting you instantly with an uptempo beat and a punchy riff, and the piano really fills out the sound to great effect--this is a hell of an about face compared to the interminable \\"Dance Tonight\\" that opened \\"Memory Almost Full\\".  \\"Alligator\\" is simply masterful, loaded with riffs, catchy as all get out, but also very emotionally-charged, with McCartney's falsetto sounding great on the bridge sections.  Also a gem is the funked-up \\"I Can Bet\\", a very surprising treat arriving at track 10, sounding like prime '70s Wings, Moog-style synthesizer and all.<br /><br />Actually, the production is a big part of what makes this such a thoroughly enjoyable listen, even through the lesser tracks.  McCartney has a great sense of how to always have something to listen for, which of course is nothing new, but it baffles me somewhat when people cry out for a stripped-down McCartney spotlighting his guitar and voice, as if not noticing that 'ear candy' production is a huge part of McCartney's overall appeal.<br /><br />Although I'm not entirely surprised, I still can't get over McCartney's lyrics at times.  It's hard to look at McCartney's life and see anything less than a pure marvel of accomplishment, and yet he writes the reflective \\"Early Days\\" with its remarkably reflective tone, suggesting that Paul ponders those pre-fame years far more than one may expect, and not without a streak of defensiveness, which seems to me like splitting hairs.  I think the nostalgia goes over the top on the throwawayish title track (with its rhythm and tempo extremely reminiscent of \\"Penny Lane\\").  \\"Appreciate\\" is a rather bizarre misfired commentary as well--hey Paul, YOU'RE telling US we need to appreciate the good fortune life has brought us?--plus it has some irritating sound samples.  He also tries, as he's been doing for many years, to push his agenda that he's a true everyman on \\"Everybody Out There\\", with emotive vocalizing toward the end that does get under one's skin.<br /><br />All in all, it's ingratiating to see that McCartney is at once in touch with his past but still not standing still creatively.  Listening to \\"New\\", it's clear why he continues pumping out the music--he's still got something to say.

The game is addictive and has good replay value if you want to better your score. The sound effects & menu representations seems to mimic Zeptolab's popular [[ASIN:B0058VW36U Cut the Rope]] series. The game offered here on Amazon has 'Flurry analytics' but you can opt that out by visiting Flurry website. (See comments)<br /><br />Overall a decent puzzle game for kids and adults alike - Three stars from me.
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|I had never before thought the year 1927 was particularly memorable. Perhaps no one in history has thought the year 1927 was all that interesting - except Bryson. He manages to tie in so many disparate yet familiar threads that I'd heard of individually but never before linked into one fateful summer. I don't want to commit any spoilers, so I won't give any details. However, if you just read the free Amazon excerpt, I think you'll be hooked too.
B000RH0C8G|4.0|Fascinating character, interesting story, engaging writing. Not 5 stars because the chronological flow of the narrative seemed a little ambiguous to me.<br /><br />Nonetheless, I very much liked Billy Beane because he understood that obtaining accurate, objective, hard information is difficult but economically valuable.
1568363931|4.0|The cookbook claims preparation is easy, however, forgetting that in certain markets the ingredients are not retrievable or available. It is quite a challenge to find Asian (and other) products in a heavily Hispanic-oriented market...Overall, it does provide feasible recipes. It would be significantly beneficial if it would provide healthy substitutes when the original ingredients are not available.
B00DJZR46G|3.0|Elton John is one of these artists where every time he has a new album, it gets hailed as some kind of comeback, or 'the album fans have waited for', a routine that seems to have been going on since 2001's \\"Songs From The West Coast\\", and that could probably be fairly applied to earlier albums as well (i.e. 1992's \\"The One\\", widely known as his first post-rehab album).  Even for fans, I'd imagine it all must get exhausting after a while.<br /><br />Elton himself doesn't exactly help matters in interviews.  If you watched the little video here at Amazon regarding this album, Elton explains he went through his back catalog to help him assess where to go next musically, but then almost immediately afterward asserts that \\"I'm not interested in the past.\\"  Huh?!?  I'm not saying that Elton isn't an intelligent man, but he is undeniably compulsive, and sometimes I don't think he really knows what he's talking about, and he has an inclination to exaggerate.<br /><br />Really, \\"The Diving Board\\" is hardly any kind of big departure from \\"Songs From The West Coast\\" or \\"Peachtree Road\\".  I suppose one could argue that, with T Bone Burnett at the helm, the album is marginally less glossy than what Patrick Leonard offered on \\"...West Coast\\", but we're splitting hairs, and actually, T Bone's production slips over into downright blandness at times, including his 'barely there' horn parts on \\"Home Again\\" and the title track.  From the instantly familiar-sounding opening track \\"Oceans Away\\", with Elton loading up the tune with his trademark secondary dominant chords that resolve just like you'd expect, you get the sense that you'll be in for an enjoyable, but routine affair.  I'm not saying you can't write a great new song using a familiar chord sequence, but there's a certain spark that is sorely lacking.  It should be obvious to anyone by now that Elton can crank out pleasantly melodic material in his sleep, and since he so consistently falls back on that talent, he hardly ever makes a truly weak record, and that certainly applies here.  Bernie Taupin too seems to know his modes all too well, providing Elton with a heaping pile of world-weary and sometimes painfully obvious lyrics which Elton delivers in his now trademarked 'weather beaten' vocal style.<br /><br />Actually, it seems much has been made about how this album spotlights Elton alone at his piano, but that's a major misnomer, as guitar, bass, and drums are present on most songs, along with other adornments.  \\"A Town Called Jubilee\\" offers us some inescapably George Harrison-esque slide guitar, and on \\"Voyeur\\" you even hear faint traces of synthesizers that sound like they escaped from the '90s.<br /><br />The one song that reveals itself as a standout is the nicely funky \\"Mexican Vacation (Kids In The Candlelight)\\", which is reminiscent of the '80s b-side \\"Lonely Boy\\" (look up \\"Lonely Boy\\" if you've never heard it--definitely one of Elton's lesser-known tunes).  He also sprinkles a small batch of instrumentals throughout the album, seemingly of a piece, as they're titled \\"Dream #1\\", \\"Dream #2\\", and \\"Dream #3\\".  The latter has a particularly moody piano part that makes it one of the most ear-catching moments on the disc.<br /><br />Not a bad listen, but a pretty exhausting one, and as I said before, you've very much heard all of this before if you're an Elton devotee.  I understand that Elton is going in for a contemplative mood, but that doesn't mean that you can't have memorable, still-punchy tunes to go with it, such as David Becvar's spine-chilling piano ballad [[ASIN:B00G5T06JA Crash and Burn]] (from his 2013 album \\"Too Much, Too Little\\").  Or, consider Paul McCartney's now-released [[ASIN:B00EUS9JF0 New [Deluxe Edition]]], which is a much more ear-catching listen while still having its undeniably melancholy touches.  \\"The Diving Board\\" is the kind of album that I'd imagine gets played sporadically upon release by fans, and then quickly collects dust on the shelf, even for seemingly 'devoted' Elton fans.  However, that shouldn't be necessary, as this is an album that makes me glad we're in age of 'virtual' product.  \\"Mexican Vacation...\\" and \\"Dream #3\\" would be fine additions to your ultimate Elton playlist, but I definitely wouldn't pay any money for \\"The Diving Board\\"--it's an almost uniformly pleasant, but routine and forgettable listening experience.
B002UZ5CHO|3.0|Food, Inc. is not accurate. It does not lie, per se, but omits a lot of truths. Fairly accurate: portrayal of mass meat production and the market drivers. I'm still an omnivore, but it made me reconsider where I get my meat.<br /><br />Not accurate: portrayal of Monsanto and grains farming. &#34;Where am I supposed to get my seeds?&#34; says one farmer. There are plenty of non-Monsanto seed companies. And the whole whining about how only 6 seed reconditioners exist in Indiana? Maybe that's because reconditioning existing seed doesn't result in the bushels/acre that new seed does, and farmers are smarter than that. As for GMO/non-GMO, you would be hard-pressed to find any non-GMO corn or soy anymore in the US, and that isn't necessarily a bad thing. It has been happening for years by all seed companies.<br /><br />I would encourage anyone who watches Food, Inc. to do research on the topics after watching this to get a more balanced view.

B004TMPJP6|5.0|This is probably my fourth to-do app. The search is finally over!! The sharing feature and the ability to designate responsibilities is an added bonus.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I like the game but you can only play for a limited time.  When you lose your lives it makes you wait.  Sometimes for up to 24 hours.  Very disappointed with this aspect.
B0018RBN8C|5.0|Wonderful record! Tracks sound good, and surprising voice quality! It arrived on time and it was in good condition! Amazing and old-fashioned performances!
B009ZQFSRA|4.0|This is classic science fiction.  I liked the actors, I liked the plot. The plot is like living under Obama if he can make himself Sheik of America.  It's 1984, Big Brother, Fahrenheit 451 all rolled into one. It's a movie than gives hope and dreams to the elderly and oppressed people in America, that they can be free one day.
B002LC8HF0|5.0|I love it when someone can build a world with dozens of seemingly unrelated details and you don't understand their relationship until the last 100 pages of a three book series.  That takes real planning, imagination, and genius.  Loved this book.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|Graphics are nice. Gameplay is fun. Decent storyline. Some levels can be somewhat of a pain but you don't want a game that is too easy.
B001SF8G1Q|5.0|I found myself singing songs on this album that I once owned as an LP/vinyl ....loose and lovely playing....w some exquisite numbers ....like If Dogs Run Free..... Went to see the Gypsy ....If Not For You (written w George Harrison ) ...Well heck I like them all .... &#34;my friend said &#34; Now didn't I warn you...Brighton girls are like the moon&#34;<br /> Oh Yeah!
B001KDQ4KQ|2.0|Too me, it was a highly illogical portraying of main characters that I couldn't deal with. Way way too many discrepancies in their psychological profiles. It made me cringe one too many times to enjoy this book.<br />An intelligent boy, supposedly so in tune with his girlfriend, but not able to see that she hates any sexual contact with him? So in love with the girl he'd rather let her pull the trigger than upset her plans to kill herself? He cannot imagine his life without her but will let her kill herself 'because she wants to'? So unreal.<br />A smart and talented girl who is not smart enough to realize her beloved &#34;brother/boyfriend&#34;, whom she is so scared to hurt, can be charged with her murder and put in prison for life? Let alone the fact that the smart girl could not see any other possible way out of a relatively common situation. What kind of upbringing does one get to be so socially inadequate? You'd think her parents were an ignorant and careless mess. But no, they are portrayed as loving, attentive parents, who, somehow, not once cared to talk to their daughter about her love life and failed to see their child was agonizing and in desperate need of help.<br />I understand that all is possible in life, people can be quite a compilation of contradicting features. But this story has too many illogical and contradicting personalities and moments, which made it highly unrealistic.<br />To enjoy and appreciate a story I have to believe it. The Pact, to me, was absolutely unbelievable, and not in a good way.

B00C8S9VKM|4.0|A very interesting historical read.  Because so many things happened in that era and they all are told at the same time, it is almost like being there.  History is amazing when told that way.
B000JMKNJ2|5.0|The excellent characters and rich setting show genuine talent!  The city of Camorra is as intriguing as any other in the genre, and the anti-heroes of Locke and Jean are more relatable and fleshed out than many traditional protagonists.  A must read for any fan of Fantasy literature,

B00EAIMGDW|4.0|Pretty fun game. It is pretty hard too and makes you use your mind.  Pretty easy controls. Would recommend game.
B005PK56TA|4.0|This show follows a struggling family who, trying for a fresh start, move into a new home only to find that it's haunted.<br />I love this show, despite the fact it would be just as good if SOME of the sex and gore were toned down. I'm far from a prude but a few of the scenes seemed so gratuitous that they detracted from the storyline a bit and were more than just shocking entertainment, but were actually very disturbing and unnecessary.<br />The GOOD: Excellent acting by all. The storyline has twists and turns at every corner. The characters all get their own back story which, when told, collectively add to the richness of the already intriguing center story.<br />I'm not sure how I feel about the ending. The show was so good and ALMOST everything gets wrapped up neatly, but not everything. I initially thought it was a cliffhanger, but found out this show makes each season into its own miniseries. So the end of season 1 is the end of that storyline. The next season picks up with a new story set somewhere else, nothing to do with the prior season.<br />Overall, I love this show and would recommend it to adults who like horror, drama, suspense, mystery or any combination of the above.

B00F30S0Y0|4.0|After a three-year hiatus, Arcade Fire return with their fourth studio LP, Reflektor. Reflektor is definitely a contrast for the Montreal based band as the effort is not only a double album, but also  one that contains more elements of dance and pop compared to previous albums.  By infusing such elements, Reflektor definitely sports more of a groove and at times even more lightheartedness than previous efforts.  Don’t let it fool you though - there is still plenty of heft here.<br /><br />Naturally divided into two volumes given the two discs, both discs are ambitiously scattered with varying themes.  On volume one,  the band gets us dancing with the incredibly addictive “Reflektor” and its head-nodding follow-up, “We Exist”.  The brief “Flashbulb Eyes” is shocking given its unexpected reggae cues, while the ear-catching “Here Comes the Night Time” seems to have plenty of finger pointing towards the church (“Now the preachers they talk up on the satellite / if you’re looking for hell, just try looking inside”).  “Normal” suggests that ‘normalcy’ is a strange (“Is anything as strange as a normal person?”) while “You Already Know” confirms and states the obvious (“Sometimes it moves so fast…if you stop to ask /it’s already passed…).  The intriguing volume closes with “Joan of Arc”, among the album’s most confusing and most metaphorically driven tracks.  All that can be said is, “what a ride”.<br /><br />If disc one was something, disc two is even more ‘unique’.  “Here Comes the Night Time II” contrasts the first disc’s version, taking on a more mysterious variation.  Three cuts (two consecutive ones) use the Greek mythological tale of  Eurydice and Orpheus as their inspiration (“Awful Sound (Oh Eurydice)”, “It’s Never Over (Hey Orpheus)”, and “Afterlife”).  While all three are extremely unique and quite the ear-catching experience, “It’s Never Over (Hey Orpheus)” may be the most vintage sound Arcade Fire number.  “Porno” switches gears, placed between “It’s Never Over (Hey Orpheus)” and “Afterlife”.  It’s message? About how bad and how selfish younger guys are towards girls.  To close the album is yet another ultra-confusing cut in “Supersymmetry”, which completely switches gears into minimalist music combined with physics.  Go figure.<br /><br />Unique through-and-through even through its less accessible moments, Reflektor ends up being one of the year’s most captivating efforts.  It’s not everyday mythology is playing through one’s iPod, but it certainly provides the listener with something different from generic pop.  Highly recommended, 4 stars.ntage sound Arcade Fire number.  “Porno” switches gears, placed between “It’s Never Over (Hey Orpheus)” and “Afterlife”.  It’s message?

Take a look at the other reviews and you will find that its not as bad as everyone says.

This is a great book, and I recommend anyone to read it.

B00A2H9X6I|5.0|Many people wonder \\"What's the point?  I know this story.\\"  That's true, and nobody can deny that Sissy Spacek is a great actor, but Chloe Moretz's take on the character is so different from Spacek's, that the new film is well worth seeing for Moretz's performance alone.  Much like her under-appreciated performance in \\"Hick,\\" her work here is extraordinary.  Whereas Spacek was distant and somewhat cold (and in the end, genuinely creepy), Moretz is much more sympathetic and relatable, and therefore the feel of the whole film is much more emotional; this is a drama, not a horror film.  Perhaps you don't know this story after all. . .

0316056863|3.0|I am a HUGE 30 Rock Fan and love Tina Fey's sense of humor. However, I get the sense that she doesn't really want to share any memoir-esque details of her life in this book. She is reluctant to open up (which is okay) but in that case, I would have preferred this to be a strictly professional memoir for comedy nerds. She seems to be trying to share &#34;just enough&#34; of her personal life (which is not of that much interest to me). As a result of this, the humor in the book reads oddly distancing. It should have been funnier since Ms. Fey is hilarious (pronounced the Tracy Jordan-way).
B006OE7XM4|5.0|Great vocals, lyrics and music!  A treat for the ears, heart and soul!  So glad that I saw his interview on Tavis Smiley!
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|This movie kept me on my toes. Great amount of action and suspense! Would definitely recommend this to who ever is into super hero's.
0399226907|5.0|Great Book!  I received exactly what I expected and am  very please with the condition of this book when it arrived.  We love all of Eric Carle's books.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is so good I love the concept of it and how you have to connect the dots together . Really good game buy buy buy!
B00AAQVTD6|5.0|If you are a fan of Frank Zappa, this is a must have album. I had this album on vinyl before.
B004UHL9EK|5.0|Great app - lots of options and settings to choose from.  I hope to find many more uses for it.

B0095VP8D4|5.0|I paired this up with a xfx 6670 GPU to crossfire with the apu and it dose run skyrim on High 30+ fps
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It's a basic calculator that is convenient to have on the few occasions I actually need one. I particularly like the large display!
B001O1O71C|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read. It made me think a lot about Jews and their live  in concentration camps and how terrible it was for them
B00FWLSLJ4|5.0|If you don't like monster/ creature Godzilla like movies, please don't watch this movie expecting Academy Award winning acting and dialogue. I am not a 16 year old boy but a 43 year old veteran sci-fi fan and this movie to me was flat out fantastic!! I've enjoyed it more than once now.
B00DVKOYBM|2.0|For a free game its not bad but be beware that all of your hard work to win coins/games could be for nothing.  At random times on iPhones, Kindles, and computer this app will randomly lock for approx 15 seconds.  If it's longer than that, you or your opponent are about to be booted out.  When you are in a higher stakes game or tournament that is SO FRUSTRATING!!!  I have lost at least 750 coins in games and tournaments because of app glitches.  I have contacted tech support and customer service but no one has responded.  Play at your own risk&middot;&middot;&middot;And for God's sake, unless you like flushing money down the toilet, don't BUY coins or power ups until the random booting is fixed.  Maybe then the app creator will pay attention!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love creeper and the entertains my little sister so she not bug me. Minecraft is like so awesome. Minecraft Minecraft
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|Very affecting.  Couldn't put it down.  My kids think it is really fun too.  Which there were more levels to play.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|Great bag for the price. Not quite the build quality as a lowepro or whatnot, but for half the cost it's not bad either.<br /><br />time will tell
B003F44QRQ|5.0|I have always loved this movie since i was a kid. My wide and i saw it on prime and we head to watch it.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Because as always it grabs you and you can't put it down till the end.Would also like to see what happens with Abra.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This is a great matching game which continues to come up with different challenges. A bit of the game is just luck, but mostly it is strategy. I don't like that once I asked friends for help I couldn't play the mystery quests because you can be hampered for days if your friends aren't actively playing. Also some times my friends don't see the request for help. It would be good to get a confirmation on requests being received. But otherwise it's great fun.
B00FN811SY|5.0|I love this app....but...it is NOT Kindle compatible.....and that is very disappointing....the whole point of getting it was so I could put it on my Kindle Devices...yes...it works on my phone...but I already went through GOOGLE for it to be installed on my phone.  Please, please, please...make it compatible for all the Kindle Devices.  Thank you.
B004TSXUWY|3.0|The main character in this book, Christine Lucas, has no past nor future. She has amnesia and lives in the present only. Every night she goes to sleep, her memory is then deleted and she awakens not knowing who the man is sleeping beside her, or that she has lost twenty years of her life. However, she keeps a diary of each day, which is her only tether to what has gone before. What a unique idea for a book! Well yes, yes it is, but the novelty wears off  pretty quickly and then boredom sets in. The beginning is suspenseful, I was looking forward to reading her struggle with life and meeting the people around her, but it is a very, very, slow moving book. After the first 100+ pages, it's a bit snoozeville until finally, her intuition/paranoia awakens and we uncover that not all is what it seems. It's an easy, well written read and is being made into movie with Nicole Kidman and Colin Firth.<br /><br />\\"Don't trust Ben.\\"
B00E5C3AJM|5.0|I gave this 5 stars, but it's just the EXACT same game as Star Girl, just with a different background, which apparently is supposed to be an Italian theme. I love Star Girl, but I wish they would stop releasing things like this as new games, when it's just the same one.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Would've gotten 5 if not for the daily bonus being a bit mean in comparison to the cost of cards. Fun and addictive though!!!!
B0055SWM08|4.0|This game has lovely music and graphics.  It's effectively leveled so that you stay challenged but not frustrated.  Overall, it provides an engaging yet relaxing experience.
B00DW1WR14|3.0|Let me begin by saying that I am a PJ fanboy, and I'm not ashamed to say so. With that said, this is easily their worst album. I'm completely perplexed by the positive reviews of this album, especially those comparing it to the quality of their early work. Sleeping By Myself is simply the worst track the band has ever recorded. Backspacer had two great mellow tracks in Just Breathe and The End. Both were very moving and profound. Sleeping By Myself isn't even worthy of a B-side. What is the point of Let The Records Play? Hey, let's record a song that's been done a million times before, just not by us. Brilliant! The last four tracks are completely unnecessary; they actually bore me. This hurts to say because rarely have I come across a PJ track I've truly disliked. One of the aspects of PJ I enjoy most is the interplay between McCready and Gossard. Unfortunately, I just don't hear two distinct guitar personalities on this album. McCready and Gossard are so in sync that the album actually sounds too polished and overproduced; the music lacks texture. With that said, I actually think the first 8 tracks are decent for the most part. I do have issues with Infallible. Parts of this song work, but some of it simply sounds cartoonish if that makes sense. I really enjoy the title track Lightning Bolt. This track reminds me of the tracks Given To Fly and In Hiding from the album Yield. Perhaps the strongest track on the album is My Father's Son. This song exhibits the edginess I'm used to from PJ. I have mixed feelings about Sirens. While I think it's ridiculous that some folks have compared this song to an arena tune in the vein of Journey, I don't feel this is one of the band's stronger ballads. This is the problem with Lightning Bolt. The strongest tracks on the album don't stack up to anything they've done previously. I do like Getaway a lot, but is it really comparable to some of their classic openers such as Go, Once, or Life Wasted? Pendulum is a strong track on thisalbum that could fit comfortably on Binaural. But again, it would not even be a stand out track on that album. Now Swallowed Whole actually hearkens back to the classic PJ sound of the nineties. Along with My Father's Son, I think this is the strongest track on the album. Like that song, this track could easily fit on Yield. Overall, I'm quite disappointed with Lightning Bolt. But I must use the ole cliché that this album is much better than anything else you'll hear these days. PJ will always be one of my very favorite bands, but for me personally, this one falls a bit short of their great masterpieces.
B00DW5IM9Q|3.0|It's Bob Dylan, so I will listen to it and get my monies worth, even if not my favorite of his.
0788859544|5.0|One of my favorites. Sabastian if my favorite character. This is an Awesome Disney movie. I am also going to purchase The Little Mermaid 2.
B009FXIICK|2.0|not fun at all, very boring and repetitive. I can appreciate the kind of stylelized graphics, but honestly I found this game to be boring.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I Love it. Very easy to use not hard at all.  Very helpful in Bible study. You wii love it to.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John's books always keep my attention.  I find it hard to want to do anything bit read!  From the moment I pick up the novel to the moment it's over, it's always like a thrilling movie.
B00BPDR3F6|1.0|Weighty, compelling, beautifully written. A book to read over and over again. Not what I expected, so much more. Patience pays off as the story unfolds.
B00CLZ48FA|4.0|It's a cute movie.  A way to explain how the wizard came to OZ.  If you don't mind a movie with semi-good acting, then this is worth getting.  I like it and glad I bought the DVD with amazon instant video code with it.
B0001I561E|4.0|I think Aladdin is a pretty good Disney movie. I like that Robin Williams plays the Genie. He does a wonderful job.
B000WKT6C6|5.0|JJ Cale may have been America's greatest underrated songwriters. No doubt Eric Clapton's solo career was strongly boosted by his songs along with covers by Poco, Lynyrd Skynyrd, etc
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is the best app ever! I got everybody addicted. When I downloaded it I thought I wasn't gonna like it. I was right because I LOVE IT
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Excellent storyline, great characters- especially the villains of this King tale.  As with his best work, there is imagery from this book that will stay with me forever.
1439153663|5.0|Wonderful book; couldn't put it down. Honest portrayal of slavery. This story was told from the perspective of a slave and an indnetured servant. The chapters alternated between the two characters as the story unfolded.
B00EDLP6O2|4.0|This game is great, with awesome graphics and a great gameplay. The textures are very good but the models make it unproporcional to a real human, besides this is perfect. Runs smooth and responsive on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9'.
B00ERIUO02|5.0|Too often artists fall into a pattern of producing the same sound. Katy has stepped away from her Teenage Dream vibe and has showed us she is capable of much more. This album is a love story of sorts and I am glad to see she is providing her fans with variety. I can picture a few of these songs on movie soundtracks (remember I said it first :).  I love that she is showing us a different side of her musicality. If you're looking for Teenage Dream type music you won't appreciate this...if you are a fan of Katy's music, then you must get this ;) Katy Cats 2013
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|Cool game for insomnia nights and easy enough for me (I am not very good at difficult games nor very patient ) recommended to everybody!!!! I am hooked!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|o lobe this app.its awesome.it works just fine for me.I hope ot does for you too.thank you very much.thank you again for reading and food bye
B004UPANGM|3.0|Good cult classic, grew up with this movie, if you haven't seen, I recommend at least one watch through, it's worth it.
B00EQUP3Q6|5.0|Never has an album taken so long for me to fall in love with.  Its been months and it took several listens but I went from a cool reception to absolutely loving Hesitation Marks.  As I listened to the album more I heard new things that made me enjoy the album more and more.  While I appreciated the album more with each listen, it wasn't til recently though when I saw NIN live where I found true appreciation for this album.  These songs live are amazing.  I truly believe this album was made to be listened to with a quality sound system or headphones.  The true appreciation in this album is the small things you hear that provide the finishing touch to the songs.  No this isn't heavy guitar driven NIN album but there is heavy aspects to the album.  Hesitation Marks actually has such a grove that it makes you almost want to dance.
B00GD9F59S|5.0|I could not fathom a better way for this story to end. I have been waiting for months to read this book and am so glad it was finally released.<br />I hope everyone enjoys this book, and the way it ends for our beloved characters.
B0026OR1UK|5.0|Terrific in the breath of skills to which one can apply this learning. Very inspiring. Tangible and clearly communicated. Great for most ages. I highlighted passage after passage.
B00E9ZATJO|4.0|Monsters University had a lot of hype to live up to.  After all, Monsters, Inc. was a huge hit....especially with my daughter!<br /><br />So...does Monsters University live up to the hype?  Well....yes it does!  However......it doesn't quite have the charm of Monsters, Inc....and I think that's because it lacks Boo.  After all, Boo was the \\"cute factor\\" in the first movie....and in this movie, of course, you don't have that.  BUT...aside from this \\"lack of cute factor,\\" Monsters University does not disappoint!<br /><br />In the movie, we learn the famous scare team's back story.  We begin the movie with Mike Wakowski (the \\"walking eyeball\\") as a young school child...and he is so adorable!  We find out about this overly enthusiastic character's past and how he developed his all consuming desire to become a \\"scarer.\\"<br /><br />Then we cut to Mike Wakowski as a new college student at Monsters U.....we find out how earnestly he wants to achieve his goals...how devoted he is to book learning about scare tactics...enter James Sullivan (Sully)..who hails from a long line of scarers and who doesn't \\"go by the book\\" at all.  Sully is overly-confident that he will pass all the tests without ever cracking a book....hence the team of Mike and Sully is born!<br /><br />Of course, they don't exactly hit it off at first....<br /><br />There are many new characters to meet in this Pixar prequel.....a whole group of funny misfit monsters in a \\"nerd\\" fraternity....there are frat parties and college hijinks, and most of all, a big competition...all of this providing plenty of brightly hued action and humor for young children - with enough amusing dialogue and character development to keep parents entertained, as well.<br /><br />Even though we all know the outcome of the movie (this is a prequel, after all) the end result is never taken for granted as we watch...which is very clever of those writers, I think.  I liked this movie....my daughter liked this movie.....my whole family liked this movie.  It's just one of those fun \\"likable\\" movies.<br /><br /> Is it as good as part one?  Well...no...but that's okay.  It's still good, and that's the point!  I say, definitely add Monsters U to your Disney collection.......it's worth it!ed this movie.  It's just one of those fun \\"likable\\" movies.<br /><br /> Is it as good as part one?  Well...no...but that's okay.  It's still good, and that's the point!  I say, definitely add Monsters U to your Disney collection.......it's worth it!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game lots of fun. Good for all ages. Love the different minion options. Wish coins were more plentiful. Cuter than temple run.
B008OOYALE|5.0|This is a lot of fun and really addictive! I love breeding the dragons and its exciting to see what new dragon getschatched.
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|Bill Bryson doesn't disappoint. This is a most interesting and comprehensive history of a pivotal summer in US history. I especially enjoy the books that Bryson reads and find myself dipping into them at odd moments for the pure joy of his humor.
B00ESY7QXI|1.0|I watched this movie for about 39 minutes, it was terrible! I kept waiting for it to get better it just got worse, what a waste of money.
B0087GF8ZG|4.0|I bought this light for a closet which had no lamp or electrical outlet, and was just a bit too dark. I installed the light on the wall, using the enclosed adhesive velcro strip, which holds it well. The light reliably turns on whenever I move my hand into the closet, as this activates the motion sensor. The light doesn't turn on if it senses enough light already, so if the light in the hallway is on, the Hipo usually doesn't turn on.<br />The LED array isn't very bright, but provides enough light to get whatever I wanted from the closet.<br /><br />All in all - it fulfills my needs.
B00ESNE696|5.0|Excellent acting, fast paced stories and a great mixture of drama and humor! The twists and turns keep you interested and the continued storyline unfolds
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Luv this game it is the best better than subway surfers jst sayin this game rocks...play this game everybody should
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|It's very fun but I don't really appreciate the ads that pop up.. although it's to be expected considering it is the FREE version.
6305428387|5.0|Love this movie<br /><br />feel good movie with a great soundtrack, has a good message without being heavyhanded, I'm old enough to remember this olympics!!
B00G32QIEG|4.0|Good movie if you are looking to turn off your mind and watch something different. It entertained me for as long as it was on and was good. Worth the 5 bucks not worth 6.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun for any one it always has a different theme well every couple of days or weeks I love this app
B003M70O5O|5.0|SOA is one of the best shows ever written. If you are a Breaking Bad fan. Then you will love SOA.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This is probably one of my favorite board games I have ever played. Most of the people I have played this with have enjoyed it as well.<br />My only negative comment about this particular product would be the border of the game board. I have played this where the water is placed with hex piece, which I liked. This version has a border you piece together like a puzzle and doesn't hold the hex pieces in place very well (it is a tight fit)
B0050DZN4K|5.0|This is my replacement for the late Google Reader. The app is pretty slick and looks lovely. Count me impressed.
B005LAIIN0|5.0|Great Movie, didn't know what I would think of it, so I rented it first. I watched it twice in the first 48 hours, then bought and have watched it 5 more times since, and read the book. No this is not the book, but you couldn't make a movie that followed the style of book. I like the thought that this movie is the story of the interviewer in the book.<br />Good story I hope they give it at least one more movie.
1451629192|4.0|A Stolen Life is a heart wrenching story about a young women who was kidnapped and kept for 18 years of her life. This un fathomable memoir reveals the very disturbing, raw stories that made up the long time of her captivity. As I read this novel, I felt a wide array of emotions. I cried, I felt empowered, I laughed, and I even was angry. Throughout that whole memoir, one feeling remained. I was intensely intrigued!!! I could not put it down. Even though it was extremely hard to read at times, when I had to take a deep breath before moving on, I defineitely would recommend this book!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so addicted to this game. I have to put myself on time limits or it will consume me. Lol. Please keep up the good work
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|Not the cleanest audio, but it could have been my recorder. Audio sounded a bit tin-y and distant, but wasn't out too much money.
031623480X|4.0|I found the book to be very informative. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I suspect that grains (primarily Wheat) over usage may explain so many of today's health woes.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Great book different style of writing, but good story. Easy to read if you don't have the time to sit and just read a book cover to cover.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|It's not as fun as league of legends but has all the same attributes. You have a team you level up and destroy.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Because I dont have to wait so long for tickets to the next level. Would recamend to all of my friends.
B00992CF6W|5.0|i think in the next update there should be the moon and you can go there!#awesome #crazy #boohah #the moon
B00EZPCZ5O|5.0|This album reminds me of a combination of stuff from art of drowning and sing the sorrow. Its definitely a CD you can listen to strait through. I am really liking their sound right now because no one else in the industry is sounding like this.
B00BQ1DBUS|4.0|I enjoy Rod's new music...unlike some other singers, he has not tried to keep doing the same style of songs that he did in his 20s, and since I'm no longer that young either have enjoyed growing older with him and his music.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I liked it. it could be a little more challenging though:) sometimes I wish I could close everything after opening them, but somethings I couldn't. not that its that big a deal, but OCD...
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Great app. Does just what it says it will. It's quick and simple for us nontechies  but  has..options for fine tuning for those who are interested.  By cleaning out tag ends of  programs you are done with,<br />it frees up memory... a great app that's also free. Thanks folks.
0984725113|4.0|short, quick read with important insights about why we continue to see a slow jobs recovery since the bottom of the Great Recession and where technology, job creation and social issues are headed.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Excellent game for mind and especially for kids to think about to keep their mind on stuff for school work
B00BMTX5IW|5.0|Got the CD and played it three times in a row.  It is infectious.  I happened on her name in an unrelated magazine article--the writer just mentioned having a party in her apartment in NYC and had Caro Emerald playing in the background.  I check her &#34;sound&#34; out on You Tube.  Upon reading reviews of her works, I chose this one.  It's a bit 30's sound and one is a cha-cha-cha.  I'm only a jazz affectionate (light stuff) and this one is so unique and just delightful.  Look forward to sharing it with our friends.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|I really like this game! The controls could be better, but other than that it is awesome. It is a great time killer too.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Shawn I got the game I thought it would be strange, but now it is so much fun!<br />Thank you for this game.
0547884591|4.0|Another great book by Tim...  covers a broad range of topics and interest. Could use some more cooking pictures, but still detailed enough. Great present to any chef.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|The characters instantly remind you of someone you know personally or just think you know.....and oh my....the scenes become embedded in your mind....I think forever....great book!
B00170GXQ2|5.0|Amazing movie. One of the best vampire movies of all time in my opinion. I think this one follows the stoker novel very well.
B00D7NWTSI|5.0|Nice storyline, sound is good. And the action and visual is great. I have watched this in the cenema. Not regretting i bought this.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|The game itself is fun and challenging.  The animation is colorful and grade A.  Plus you get to choose between the dark side and the life force side during the game.
0992251656|5.0|I come from a family of serious board game players,  and let me tell you: this game does not disappoint!  It is very true to the show and movie, has a wonderful amount of variety to keep the plots interesting,  and has serious room for future expansions and alternate plots/rules/ etc. I love that you can play alone or with a partner.  This is rather hard to find in a board game.<br /><br />For our first game we followed the directions suggestions for a starter game and got the hang of things pretty rapidly. Can't wait to play again!
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|Challenging, addicting, funny, fast. I love the characters you acquire when you hit a certain amount of points.<br /><br />Also, pledge to never play around trains! Dangerous, bad! :)
B00G32QIEG|1.0|Never should have rented the movie in the first place. It was a total waste of mone.  Don't waste your time
B00CTSDDVO|2.0|Storyline is okay...<br />Very poor sound. Its 7.1 tru-sourround.<br />I'd prefer, 5.1 Dolby digital.<br />I have watched it in the cenema before.<br />It sounded better in the cenema.<br />I have my own cenema sound system. My room is like a cenema.<br />Playing movies in my room have always sounded better or similar to cenema, but this, 7.1 tru-sourround, it sucks.
B001EBWITA|5.0|Keanu does a great job acting as Constantine, the &#34;hero&#34; of the movie. He is fighting evil/demon forces who have come to conquer earth. He and the other actors in this film do an outstanding job acting their representative parts.  Each actor brings a &#34;je ne sais quoi&#34; quality to their personality (character.) It is a well thought out movie, with special effects and suspense. Good v Evil; Heaven v Hell; Arch Angels v Humans; God v Satan. Self v Self.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game and so does my son it is nice that we can play together thats appropriate. thank you!!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I am speechless. I thought I knew what the end would be but I was completely wrong. An amazing  book to end an amazing series. Bravo Veronica Ross, Bravo.
B008NMT684|5.0|Very good game. My 3 year old boy loves it and it keeps him occupied while we are either doing laundry or driving
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|5stars<br />A great book<br />Brings out my wild side<br />You should read this book ,is a journey you can't forget
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|For lives..... I love playing.  I hate waiting. I can't see the people that invited me to pay either. Hopefully they show soon.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Great story teller! Characters come alive and you can't put it down. I'll look forward to all of his writing in the future.
B006ZNRD06|5.0|Though many complaints I have found out the main problem seems to be memory which it needs to load the video frames I suppose... all though not necessary for  all videos. So not only is this need memory but it's a 7-day trial so either way still worth it if get a Memory boost app.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I think it's really fun.I honestly enjoyed this game on facebook and now I play it on my kindle.It's great for long term play.
0788859544|5.0|I have always liked this movie. Such a great movie for kids. I would recommend this movie for families of all ages.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|This game is like so awesome I love the little people in it it's way better than dumb ways to live cause I play it on my brothers kindle and its just stupid but this is awesome and super funny I play it every single day and I just love that song it's so catchy I just don't know how to do the plane game that's like super hard so I just took the plane game off but overall this is awesome times infinity :D
B0089EHWQE|5.0|An incredibly beautiful book that had my emotions in turmoil.  I couldn't put it down.<br />The characters are real and every gesture is true. I felt transported into their worlds and took part in their daily lives with their small triumphs and large tragedies.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Love it and I would recommend it to other people.<br />Graphics are so good it feels like your actually hunting.
B00E7RZEI0|5.0|It's fun and addicting. I would recommend it to anyone with the time or money to play it! :) z
B005T87QCI|4.0|I love this game but i wish it would be easier to get better robots without having to pay for them with real money. That is really the only thin  i would change.
1476727651|5.0|This baby was classic King. Right out of the gate you are taken back to the Overlook and the effect it and Jack Torrance had on Danny well into his adult life. Definitely another &#34;page-turner&#34; by King. My only wish ..... that he had ANOTHER one ready to buy !!!!!
B00AFEQA5K|2.0|I was so surprised and disappointed that MM would play a role like this.  It was a very disturbing movie.  I almost wished I wouldn't have watched it.
B00FEHXCIG|2.0|the movie let me down you always expect the same level of excitement each time you watch these movies maybe i should stop expecting so much
B00BV85AVE|5.0|24 karat CLASSIC Every song takes me back to a special place in time. Mariah is #1 Buy this album
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I play a lot of different games and this is one of my favorites. Many of my friends/co-workers play it.
B001CDD84Y|4.0|This is a very underrated film that I can't find anything wrong with but a lot that I like. It is fast paced with Sam Jackson as a villain who thinks he's doing good and acting for rightous reasons. The teleportation is portrayed in a believable and visually appealing fashion. Christensen's protagonist is relatable as a young man escaping a bad home life with a newly discovered super-ability to escape anything, go anywhere, and take almost anything he wants with him. Merits a sequel, imo.

1476727910|4.0|I knew I was going to enjoy this book when Mr. Haig quietly dropped a joke into the last line of the first page of chapter one.<br />The fish out of water story is an old one, and the need for some authors to remind us to stop and smell the roses is probably just as old -- but with a strong sense of humor (and tongue occasionally in cheek) Haig gives the familiar a fresh coat of paint.<br />I won't bother with story details as the other reviewers have done that, but I particularly liked the author's ability to create a three-dimensional character from 'negative space'.  Isobel becomes fully realized by what she doesn't say, son Gulliver is a walking wound we recognize from our own adolescence with being given too much detail nto his misery (at least at first), and the other characters gain a life from the alien's unbiased description of them.  Haig also disarmingly gets us on the alien Andrew's side as soon as he befriends the dog--we all know a dog's ability to sniff out good people.<br />Yes--it does get a little preachy near the end, though one of alien Andrew's pieces of advice really struck me \\"To like something is to insult it.  Love it or hate it. Be passionate. . . indifference . . .is a disease.\\"<br />So, I didn't like this book, I loved it--at least enough to recommend it to you.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|Having read E Gilbert's other fiction and non-fiction, I remained open minded to this latest work. She easily drew me into this new world and I comfortably put my trust in her hands. I was rewarded when time, topic and language fell away and I was immersed in the story.

B00D1VKZ3M|3.0|I was so excited to read this book and as soon as I started reading I realised the style etc was exactly like previous books, i.e Sept 13th Lb lost - zero, cigarettes smoked - too many. It was a nice easy read in that sense and full of humour. I would recommend reading - even for a sense of nostalgia if you are a fan. You feel close to Bridget as always and truly want her to find happiness. Love the few twists in the book - 3/5 rating!

B00BAXFECK|5.0|Before downloading The Goldfinch I read at least 5 reviews, 3 of them from the NYT, and all laudatory.  All referred to the length (almost 800 pages) of this bildungsroman, to its Dickensian and Dostoyevskyan similarities, to its magical descriptions and Tartt's ability though female, to get inside the heads of its male protagonists, particularly in portraying their friendship. All referred to her sublime use of language, her story-telling talents, her ability to reach the depth of emotions.  So you might say that I was prepared to embark upon an engrossing read.  That's the understatement of the year!  I blazed through this remarkable novel like a band of locusts and had to force myself to put the book down each day so that I wouldn't finish it too soon.  I even flirted with the idea of immediately beginning again.  That's how good it is.  For plot see Michiko Kakutani's review in the New York Times and Kamila Shamsie's in The Guardian below, but above all, treat yourself and read The Goldfinch.<br /><br />Normally I keep a list of books for future reading, but Donna Tartt's exquisite prose has made it impossible for me to even contemplate anything of a lesser nature.  Either I'll have to go in a totally opposite direction (Doris Kearns Goodwin's forthcoming tome, The Bully Pulpit), or with a classic (Dostoyevsky's Crime  & Punishment).<br /><br />The painting by Carel Fabritius central to the novel actually exists and will be on display until January at The Frick Collection in N.Y. in an exhibit of 22 Dutch Masters.....Rembrandt, Vermeer, Steen, etc.  Fabritius was a student of Rembrandt and the teacher of Vermeer.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />[...]

B0098VXMNE|4.0|Good plot and decent acting.  If you like a lot of gratuitous sex and violence, you'll give this 5 stars; if you find those things offensive, you'll give it one or two.  I'm not particularly offended by sex or violence - but found them to be excessive in this series.
B000HZGNEU|5.0|A nice comedic tone that is lacking in most of the series.  Also, a nice break from the standard story line of most Star Trek movies.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This is an interesting book even for Christians. It attempts to shed light on the real historical Jesus and to try to separate the facts from myth in the Bible. This book may upset some people but should not detract from the Christian beliefs that our religion espouses since all religions rely on faith to carry us through some disputed accounts of Jesus' life. I enjoyed the authors work and agree with most of his conclusions. It is also interesting that there has been controversy with different ways to organize our Christian religion since the time of the  twelve Apostles and their disagreement with Paul on the goals of the church.

B00321MGPG|5.0|I've developed a bad habit of wanting to watch some TV before falling asleep.  The problem is that if I pick a show that is really engaging, I'll stay alert and watch it.  Planet Earth is full of beautiful HD visuals and great educational content, but it is also something that you can shut your eyes and just listen to and let it lull you to sleep.  So I not only have enjoyed watching it in full, but I also take it with me on the road on my Kindle Fire HD and use it as &#34;white noise&#34; to help me sleep when I travel.<br /><br />You'll need to lay aside the nonsense about global warming - remember that much of this series was developed when our politicians and media were on this bandwagon prior to the time that it was proven to be bunk.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|Perhaps the one word to sum up what House of Cards is all about is AMBITION and INFLUENCE PEDDLING. The setting is Capitol Hill and the White House, Washington DC. The focus is House Majority Whip Frank Underwood and his wife, Claire, who heads a blandly named non-profit organization, the \\"Clean Water Initiative\\".<br /><br />This is a case study in career strategies, jealousy, and mutual back-scratching (back-stabbing?) in the heated and hedonistic atmosphere of Washington politics. The crackling tension between the hard-boiled characters, both male and female, and the chess-like interplay of the web of relationships, projects House of Cards head and shoulders above other dramas. It is a delight to see exquisite writing and acting used in a dramatic television series to depict something other than police and detective work...a worn-out genre, overplayed for decades.<br /><br />The acting is amazing. (A backhanded way of saying the casting is completely brilliant.) This is the best thing Kevin Spacey (as House Majority Whip Frank Underwood) has ever been in. Period. And I'm including LA Confidential and American Beauty. He is certainly in his element here, the dark anti-hero of a toxic and deadly inside world of manipulation, and I think will be remembered for \\"Cards\\" at least as much for anything he has ever done.<br /><br />Robin Wright is Underwood's wife, mixing her cunning drive behind an icily professional demeanor, always seemingly on the threshold of burnout, and incapable of genuine warmth...only a reasonable facsimile. Kate Mara is the ambitious young journalist who rides Underwood's coattails to success, but ends up getting more than she bargained for. And Corey Stoll is a young but alcoholic congressman from Pennsylvania who perches precariously on a precipice between glorious success and absolute ruin.<br /><br />The production budgets feel limitless. You will see a lot of money up there on the screen in extras and locations. Jeff Beal's music score work is dark, moody, and chilling -- absolutely indispensable to the ambience of the whole series, a real bullseye.<br /><br />And the one minute sequence at the beginning of each episode, containing stunning time lapse shots of DC landscapes, combined with Beal's music, adds up to the most evocative, ground-breaking open title since 1965's Hawaii Five-O. By shooting timelapse of DC scapes, the series expresses the idea that we will have an omniscient perspective of the goings-on in Washington, on a very personal level.<br /><br />David Fincher (who directed the first two episodes) was right. TV series DO allow for deeper characterization than conventional 2 hour movies. Real life is more complex and ambiguous than a 2 hour feature. House of Cards is not for the simple-minded.<br /><br />House of Cards is an amazing series on a level with the best movies and television you've ever seen, so rich in it's characterizations and it's deeply cynical writing. It's more than a cult classic, it's gonna take over, and it is an eye-opening look at the bruising world of high-wire politics and power patronage.<br /><br />Or you could just keep watching romantic comedies or detective and spy dramas, which would please Frank Underwood no end.is dark, moody, and chilling -- absolutely indispensable to the ambience of the whole series, a real bullseye.<br /><br />And the one minute sequence at the beginning of each episode, containing stunning time lapse shots of DC landscapes, combined with Beal's music, adds up to the most evocative, ground-breaking open title since 1965's Hawaii Five-O.

B00CBXV96I|5.0|This is half movie/half TV.  The quality of the writing and acting make this one of the best TV programs I have seen.  Since I am a big fan of Mads Mikkelsen, this really delivers. Mads does a superb job of playing a smart twisted mad man so much so that he is likeable.  We need more!!

B00EVPSJOE|5.0|Great album. The DVD is a great extra feature. Nice to see the band having fun rehearsing. A timeless album that I can listen to over and over.
B00EDOS6IC|5.0|I really need 10 stars to rate how monstrously awesome this album is. Though \\"Blackbird\\" is often considered Alter Bridge's best effort to date, in my opinion, \\"Fortress\\" far surpasses it. The track chronology is perfect; it starts off with a flamenco-inspired classical acoustic intro before launching you on an epic sonic journey from beginning to end. There are moments of extreme sensitivity counterpointed with devastating heaviness. With every listen, I have a new favorite track, and the songs have been trading places on constant loop in my head.<br /><br />This album is filled with sophisticated melodic and rhythmic complexity (\\"The Uninvited\\", \\"Bleed it Dry\\", \\"Lover\\"), drop-D metallic pummeling (\\"Addicted to Pain\\", \\"Fortress\\", \\"Farther Than the Sun\\"), intense galloping rhythms (\\"Cry of Achilles\\", \\"Peace is Broken\\", \\"Waters Rising\\") with surprisingly radio-friendly hooks (\\"Calm the Fire\\", \\"Cry Me a River\\", and the ballad \\"All Ends Well\\").<br /><br />Powerful bombastic songs are contrasted against the hauntingly evocative \\"Lover\\". it's almost embarrassing to admit, but \\"All Ends Well\\" is the first metal song that has ever made me cry when I heard it--the lyrics are deeply emotional and uplifting, and the major 7th vocal interval in the chorus is heartbreaking. There is an instrumental break in the middle of \\"Cry of Achilles\\" at about the 3:45 mark that is oddly reminiscent of the beginning of Journey's (!) song off of \\"Infinity\\" called \\"La Do Da\\" (pronounced \\"lah doo day\\"). As a diehard Journey fan, I found it humorously pleasing to see the obvious yet unexpected influence represented here in such a heavy song.<br /><br />The voice of Myles Kennedy, whose range is beyond compare, truly shines on this album. He's given the opportunity to use his entire vocal range, from the deeper gruff register to the soaring highs for which he is known, and to introduce a third dimension, a breathy softer side that manifests as a soothing angelic quality (in the beginning of \\"Calm the Fire\\") and in \\"Lover\\", as an eerily husky sensuality that, later expanded into his power range and coupled with the song's story, serves to underscores the creepiness of the song.<br /><br />One point of note: a common trend in heavy music today is using screaming and animalistic growling. If you hate that as much as I do and long for the days when singers SANG with precision, emotion and good technique, then this is definitely the album for you. Myles is a Singer in the true sense of the word.<br /><br />Guitarist Mark Tremonti is featured as lead vocalist on \\"Waters Rising\\" and it is a welcome complement to Myles' vocals. Tremonti's guitar playing is everything that is good about tasteful, scarily gymnastic leads and captivating riffs. This is classic, perfect shredding at its finest.<br /><br />Lyrically, it is Alter Bridge at its most profound, delivering a message of change and premonitions of apocalyptic nightmares should we dare to ignore the warnings.<br /><br />If you own only one Alter Bridge album, this is the one to have. It's exciting, it's inspiring, it's ear-bleeding, mind-numbing, powerful, passionate, exuberant and serious all at once. This album--nay, this BAND--gives me hope for the future of music. It hearkens back to everything that was good about the classic metal of the 80s and 90s, and takes it forward.<br /><br />For fans of: Rush, Dream Theater, Yngwie Malmsteen, Journey, Metallica, Creed, Iron Maiden, complex time signatures, galloping rhythms, soaring emotional vocals, unexpected melodic structures, headbanging.m the Fire\\") and in \\"Lover\\", as an eerily husky sensuality that, later expanded into his power range and coupled with the song's story, serves to underscores the creepiness of the song.<br /><br />One point of note: a common trend in heavy music today is using screaming and animalistic growling.

B000FBJG04|5.0|Did you know that this book (and movie) are true stories of World War 2?  I recommend this as a must for anyone who wants to learn about D-Day and those that sacrificed so much during and after this historic battle.  It is also an inspiration to those who long to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with others who would sacrifice everything for their brothers and sisters.  I find myself frequently reflecting on this bit of history and applying it to business, personal situations and to how I should give back to my society.
B000YMHOUS|5.0|Pleasantville is about two teenagers in the 'present' fighting to find their identity and the meaning of life, sucked into an old-time Leave It To Beaver-style TV show about two teenagers in the 'past' fighting to find their identity and the meaning of life. Their struggle 'infects' the town of Pleasantville. This movie shows how people evolve, and how they react to change differently. This isn't a teen movie, meaning people of all ages will enjoy it, but it is written from a teen's perspective, so only one side is presented. What these kids did opened a lot of opportunities for people, but it also prevents people who liked the former lifestyle from living it. It's gone, the good and bad. Would the culture of the 50's survived, if there had been an acceptable outlet for women in the workplace, artists, etc? Are humans doomed to trade one prejudice for another? The movie tries to tell us that compassion for one another is all that really matters. There are so many levels of discussion for this film, it should be part of every school's curriculum. The film may be set in two different generations, but the message itself is timeless.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|I like this game a lot! The matches are quick and progress is saved.  Its requirement of power cores to fight is similar to Candy Crush Saga's moves.
B004FQX59I|5.0|This is the film that stirred public opinion enough to result in the creation of the Assassination Records Review Board, which caused millions of JFK-related documents to be declassified in the 1990s. Those documents contained quite a few important revelations about the case, though the mainstream media has seen fit to ignore them. This, of course, is the same mainstream media that attacked Stone's film with a blind fury and savagery not directed at any other motion picture to my knowledge.<br /><br />JFK is extremely well-made: the directing, editing and cinematography are perfect. It still stands as an example of the incredible power of film-making (critics would say the power of propaganda). Kevin Costner turns in a strong performance, though he doesn't resemble the real-life Jim Garrison. Gary Oldman is simply stunning as Oswald. We don't know what David Ferrie actually sounded like, and he was actually fairly tall, but Joe Pesci steals every scene he's in.<br /><br />The screenplay is not perfect. Veteran researcher Harold Weisberg attacked the inaccuracies and invented scenes. Assistant D.A. James Alcock actually delivered the closing argument at the trial. There were no strangers in the Book Depository laying down new flooring (it was being done by the warehouse employees). But the overall message is right on target: Oswald was framed, and JFK was killed by powerful forces inside and outside the government who opposed his policies.

0316204366|3.0|I am rather disappointed by this book. I have loved most of Malcolm Gladwell's books but am losing interest in his writing with each new book. I find that he writes in the same voice and uses the same formula in every book. His writing no longer feels fresh, new, or intriguing to me.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|If you've never played any Angry Birds, then you should get at least one version - and this one is as good of a place to start as any.  It's a very simple game to play that is easy to get into even if you only have a few minutes.  But it is challenging and engaging enough that it can keep you going for hours if you are so inclined.<br /><br />It's another Angry Birds version.  So if you've ever played Angry Birds before, it won't let you down.  Not much more to say than that.

B009HXG9UQ|5.0|Enchanting tale of the inevitable relationship of two individuals misunderstood by their families and society.  Wonderful performances by the two child stars and the entire cast.  Stunning cinematography of a beautiful natural landscape and clever, intricate architectural set pieces.  The adult characters sympathetic to the plight of the two runaways at the center of the story (Ed Norton, Scout Master, and Bruce Willis, local cop) are particularly poignant in their connection with the boy.  Each character is treated with humor, sensitivity and love (except for the bully and the state child services rep).  As always, Wes Anderson creates a very particular world - life on an island that feels very remote and protected from the modern world.  It's a wonderful world to inhabit for 90 minutes.  And love reigns in a bold and spectacular way.
B004CLYKLI|4.0|Being mother to an adopted daughter from China, I was very interested in the Tiger Mom and Chinese way of child development.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I read this book with great interest and reflected on what the author said for quite some time.  His &#34;experience&#34; of heaven sounds sensational and, as a brain surgeon, he seems to have some excellent credentials.  His experience is well-told and engaging.<br /><br />However, after reflecting on this for some time and even doing some research, I have come to the conclusion that his experience of heaven is not true.  That's tough to say - who knows what heaven will look like, so how can anyone argue with someone else's experience?  I based my conclusions on two things: (1) recent scientific evidence shows that even a &#34;nearly brain dead&#34; person may still have enough brain function to experience a dream-like state - something that the author positions as impossible, and (2) the author says that he was told that the world needed to solve the problem of global warming during his visit - a theory that has recently been proven to be false as we are now potentially headed for another little ice age - presumably an all knowing God is already aware of this.<br /><br />With all of that said, I still give it 3 stars.  I believe that the author is sincere in what he dreamed and the story was engaging regardless of its value.  It's a nice work of fiction.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book....a wonderful author......I truly makes you understand how an animal and a person are so much alike and share so many of the same feelings...it brought tears to my eyes because I recently lost my pet and it somehow comforted me.

B00ENBS4GO|4.0|Good plot and decent acting.  However, there is a tremendous amount of gratuitous sex and violence in this series.  I am not generally turned off by these things - but there was so much of it in this particular series that I had to drop it from 5 to 4 stars.  If you are easily offended by sexual content or violence (extreme violence) then you will not enjoy this series.

B009AMAJVO|4.0|I was surprised by this thriller (and I guess that will happen if you don't read the blurb before watching a film), at the start I thought this was going to be a gangster film. It begins with a crime boss being targeted and trying to find out who's after him. It turns out that the person is one of his trusted lieutenants who is seeking revenge.<br /><br />Things become complicated when he get's involved with his neighbour who has her own plans for revenge.<br /><br />It's a slick thriller and Colin Farrell does a good job as the lead and is well balanced by Noomi Rapace's character. The story unfolds at a good pace and the romance works as an integral part rather than a distraction. The main plot is simple enough, but the plan is quite elaborate and keeps things interesting.<br /><br /> Things get a bit crazy towards the end and while it's a sensible conclusion, it's a little over the top compared to the preceding part of the film. It doesn't spoil the film, but it's on odd note to what was quite a considered build up.<br /><br />All in all I enjoyed watching it, it keeps you entertained all the way through.
B003F3PMYI|5.0|This is an amazing book for those people who want to learn how to consistently operate at high levels and who want to help others do the same.  This book has a large number of research outcomes that support the conclusion.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I don't play a lot of games on my Kindle Fire HD.  But this is one that I do occasionally enjoy.  It's a light plot, but involved enough that it keeps me engaged.  It takes a bit to learn the controls, but not so much that it puts me off.  If you're looking for a way to entertain yourself for a few minutes, then this is a nice one.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I loved this story and couldn't put this book down. It was so well written that it captivated me.  I have read a lot of books but John Grisham's style of writing kept me engrossed. I don't write reviews like some people do who tell you what the entire story is about. I will say you won't be disappointed. If possible, I would have given this book a 10.
B00CM4VC7M|5.0|Amazon protected the cute packaging very well so no damage came to it. The figure is very good quality and well made for it's great price. When I got it in the mail, I fell in love with the cute box Sailor Moon was in and how well the details with the face especially was done. I had to buy another and I did.
0440237688|5.0|When I read this book as a child, it quickly became my favorite book. I reread it recently as an adult, and discovered that it was still one of my favorites.<br /><br />Jonas, on his 12th birthday, is given the weighty honor of holding all of his utopian society's memories of love and pain and everything that makes us human. With each new memory he receives from the &#34;Giver,&#34; the retiring former holder of that job, he is forced to face the best and worst parts of the world that his society has decided to shun.<br /><br />I strongly recommend that children read this between 4th or 5th grade. It will give them an appetite for true literature, and will encourage critical thinking about themselves and their world.<br /><br />(I also strongly recommend that EVERYONE reads it, regardless of age. Devote a Saturday to it. You'll be so glad you did.)

B007SYWFRM|3.0|It is tiring playing the scratch game for little points. I understand trying to make money on game by making it so we have to buy nuts if we want to get a lot of things, however I had this game on my other kindle and when I had to get a new kindle this game started over,losing everything I had,previously.I will not buy again.
B00336G7HI|5.0|Does what it is suppose to do. Holds it charge very well on my Sony HDR-CX260V. A nice liitle batttey pack.
1742204147|5.0|I have had the opportunity to review a good number of travel guides on Japan over the years but this is the first time I will be reviewing Lonely Planet's Japanese travel guide.<br /><br />For those not familiar with Lonely Japan, for the last few years it was owned by BBC Worldwide until it was sold to NC2 Media in 2013.  The guide is over 878 pages of information throughout Japan including a city map of Tokyo.<br /><br />The first 62-pages deal with planning your trip to Japan, things you need to know, traveling with children, going to Japan on a budget and more.<br /><br />The the guide goes into traveling to Tokyo, Mt. Fuji and around Tokyo, the Japan Alps and Central Honshu, Kyoto, Kansai region, Hiroshima and Western Honshu, Northern Honshu, Sapporo and Hokkaido, Shikoku, Kyushu, Okinawa and the Southwest Islands and remaining pages on understanding Japanese culture plus a survival guide.<br /><br />This latest guide features writings from various writers of what they love about Japan, Japan's top 25 locations, preparing newcomers to Japan from bargaining to etiquette.  For anime fans, there is even info. on Akihabara and Ikebukuro's Otome Street and also the Ghibli museum and for J-Pop fans, even information on AKB48 (although, the information on voting for a member in the theater is incorrect - The voting for a member is for actually for the senbatsu event).<br /><br />While the majority of the full color pages are on the opening pages and the center page on Todai-ji, for the most part, \\"Lonely Planet Japan\\" does a great job with featuring a lot of detail for various regions being visited.  Lonely Planet also offers  certain guides for Tokyo and Kyoto for those wanting to focus on a certain region, as well as pocket information on their online shop plus eBook versions for those who prefer the guide on a tablet.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />What I look for in a travel guide with up-to-date information, maps and as much detail for the region as possible.  Some tend to skimp on other areas outside of Kanto and Kansai region but this Lonely Planet guide really does a good job of giving coverage for all over Japan.  While I do enjoy the Fodor's travel guides for its use of color throughout, while photography of a region is nice to have, for travel guides, it all comes down to detailed information and I will can easily say that \\"Lonely Planet Japan\\" is easy to read, informative and a travel guide worth using and help in planning and preparing for your trip to Japan.<br /><br />\\"Lonely Planet Japan\\" is recommended!e.

0763652245|5.0|This is the best seasonal kids' book ever.  We have purchased 4 copies in total -- one for us and 3 as gifts.  The poetry is hilarious and the flaps are ingenious.  We love it!
B003VANOFY|4.0|my first week of wearing these for 52.3 hours... battery lasts a full day; definitely charge them every night.. reception; i can go downstairs to other offices and they work just fine. Occasional crackle sound most likely rf noise due to all the wireless devices in my office. sound is excellent and they work really well to block out background noise too, you can really turn these up but the battery goes faster with the surround turned on... the mic seems ultra sensitive; my clients hear me really well but they hear everything really well!! could use more background noise filtration, (example) not as good as my cellphone headset at blocking out background noise.. they wear like a glove my ears fit comfortably inside them, they're really form fitting and light too, love the pivoting speakers makes wearing them around my neck fashionable.. the flexible mic is a nice touch too, overall i give them just 4 stars because i think it's too soon to give a 5 star rating, i'm still early on in this romance but it's looking like a real love affair at this point... i'll keep you posted
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is a very addicting game &amp; I am so happy that it's on kindle so I don't have to go on Facebook all the time just to play it.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|Its a great little device if you don't expect it to do too much ...... it works well on smooth floors like linoleum or tile or wood, but you'll have to clean the brushes often if medium to long hair is regularly swept up.
B000OCY7JE|5.0|Fabulous movie in the proper NTSC format. Fine closeup content and interesting human stories. Awesome director and acting.<br />Makes a fine gift
B00AB7HESI|1.0|I am really disappointed. The game starts up and all that, but no objects can be placed, defeating the entire purpose of the game. Please fix. Does not work for Samsung Galaxy Note 3 for Sprint
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|my son loves this game, and has not stopped talking about it since I downloaded it... keep the birds flying folks!!!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This book was heartbreaking and wonderful.  My book club chose to read this and I am so glad they did. This is the best book I have read in a long time!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This was great fun, creative problem solving in a detailed 3D table that just kept me challenged.  Looking for more from this company!  Took me much longer then I thought it would and well done on the graphics and special effects. A broader span of history may have been great, they reference the pyramids and early history but don’t use it in the puzzle.  More clues in the notes would have helped too.  Worth every penny for hours of fun!  I may be slower then some folks; took me four hours; but I would buy it again!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I love this app because for one it's ad free which is great but also the graphics are really good it's as real life as a game could get.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I really like playing this game. It's colorful and creative. I just wish they would come out with a paid version for non social media users. Its annoying having to wait for lives to replenish and to move on to higher levels.
B0001ARCFA|5.0|Fantastic cans for all kinds of listening. These were my third pair of over ear phones, and I'm much more satisfied with these AKG's than with my previous pair costing twice as much.
B0054TKB8I|5.0|I avoided watching this show for months because I thought it would be really cheesy. But it's actually fantastic. I'm kind of a chicken when it comes to horror but I love the special effects and the edge of your seat scary moments in this show. The characters are well written and acted (and exactly hard on the eyes either). The story lines, drama and relationships are some of my favorites on TV right now.
B000FCKRDI|3.0|Good series. Very Likeable characters, action, romance and a good plot. Have read earlier books and will read the rest.
B003XYERRM|5.0|Now that Richard the Third's body has been found, this novel gives you good reasons to have a better opinion of him. The book is a moving portrait of the man who has been so maligned by the Tudors and Shakespeare.i
B009JZSC9S|4.0|It continues well after a good first three season.  You can, however, see where the writers are reaching for new material.
B00F3W9NQ2|5.0|Every time I think this show has hit it's peak, it surprises me with even more blood, romance, drama, suspense and general nail biting craziness. I'm obsessed.<br />p.s. - watch The Originals too!! Best spin off of all time!!
B005NFJAZS|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movie and I loved being able to see it again and again.  Go Music Man!
B0029LCJJS|5.0|Jonathan Reyes Meyers is Henry the VIII.  The costuming and palace settings were breathtaking.  All of this visual enjoyment with the history added is just to hard to pass up.  This is the second time I have watched the complete series &#34;which is saying a lot for one who is easily bored&#34;.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I absolutely fell in LOVE with the first two books.  But this one was just a huge let down.<br /><br />SPOILERS<br /><br />She can NOT do what she has done.  It is against the laws of writing a good series.  Guess what she did? Are you guessing?  Okay, I'll tell you.<br />SHE KILLED OFF THE MAIN CHARACTER.  SHE FREAKING KILLED TRIS.<br />You never do that if you want more than 2.5 stars.  TRIS was amazing and she killed her.  I will not read anymore of this author's books, just for the sake of wanting to read happy endings.  And, piece of advice, Veronica, you said \\"I was trying to convey real world things into my writing not everyone has a happy ending and I wanted to put that into my books,\\" well let me tell you, THE WHOLE REASON PEOPLE READ IS TO GET OUT OF THE 'REAL WORLD'.  So next time, make a happy ending. And may be, just maybe, I'll read it.  Only if you aren't stupid.  I'm sorry for that name but it's better than threatening you.  I would never actually hurt you, (even though I would very much like to rip you apart in the most painful way possible for killing my favorite character. Or shoot you in the forehead.)  JUST KIDDING I'M JOKING WITH YOU!  I WOULD NEVER HURT ANYONE. :)
B0055XCDZ2|5.0|I never know exactly what's happening in this show and I think that's what keeps me coming back. The surprises, the intrigue, the secrets and plot twits are maddeningly good. By the end of each episode your head is spinning because you have as many questions as you do answers. It's like a drug. You just have to know more. Every cast member plays their part incredibly well and it's impossible not to get caught up in the plot.
B0029LCJJS|4.0|Great cast.  Surprisingly substantive and high production quality.  Showtime always felt like HBO-Lite to me and this series is a direct competitor to Game of Thrones without the dragons.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I really love this movie. Took it on my iPad to Texas. Great on a 3 1/2 hour plane trip. If you like Star Trek check out this movie. Digital download worked fine.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is fun. It would be nice if there weren't a set amount of moves but i guess that's what makes it challenging.
B00ESNE696|2.0|The first four seasons are good but so far this season I'm really bored. I don't really like the main characters anymore, they used to be endearing and now I find them unlikeable. The story 3 episodes in was really depressing so I cancelled my TV pass.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|There's not much more to say. It's powerful where it needs to be and hilarious everywhere else. I loved it.
B00B2QG3K2|5.0|This is GREAT!!!!!!!!!  I LOVE EVERY SONG!!!!!!!  I think this young lady has so much talent.  She brings every song to life with expression & feeling.  She is amazing.  My favorite is Grow Up.  I love the part of the song that She tells her friends they can stick it!!!!!!!!  The clarity in her voice is very expressive.  Actually, all of the songs are fun and up beat.  I love them all.  I am so glad I decided to buy this & I recommend it to everyone that loves a good beat and easy to listen to lyrics.  Fun music!!!!!!!!
B00F91SCXC|4.0|Great, fun movie that never insulted or took away from the original book.  For once, an adaption of a great novel wasn't screwed up by Hollywood!
B00EY7LT9Q|4.0|So far this is pretty good. I don't know how attached I am to any of the characters but I think they'll grow on me and the story lines have been interesting.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|I  really enjoy this game because it is a puzzle and I  really enjoy doing puzzle-like games. I don't  have anything against against it.
B00A4FOWYQ|5.0|I like this cd.  It is up beat & very addictive.  It has a peppy makes you want to dance kind of beat.  Good pick you up and send you out the door in a good mood kind of music.
B001BC5HXG|5.0|This was a terrific read. I really enjoyed it. The characters were relatable and you couldn't help root for them. I heard they are making a new movie. I have never seen the original with James Dean, but plan to.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|It's a little juvenile but still a good read. Fast paced, good characters and relationships. The end was a little bit strange but still good.
B0058EBNAO|3.0|If you change devices.... you cannot re--install..... you have to purchase the program once again. This is a serious deal breaker.
B005HJWWW8|2.0|For iphone 5, it makes no difference in volume. Bummed. At least I didn't wast too much money. Really trying to find a better system for my motorcycle helmet speakers.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I'm 44 and read this book, even though it's a child's book. It was a good read. Of course, I've seen the movie with my kids, when they were small, but have been enjoying reading all of the classics that I didn't get a chance to read when I was younger. Of course, the children's books written in the 19th century were tougher reads than those written and dumbed down for our children in the 20th century. The storyline is sweet and inspiring and I enjoyed reading through the Yorkshire accents of the children. I was able to get through this book quickly.
B009XIXVU6|1.0|The book was hard to follow. There should have been a diagram of all the characters at the beginning. I read this for our book club and only one out  of 6 members liked it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm so glad I can play on Kindle now. It is awesome that it connects to my current Facebook game! I like the alerts for full lives.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game...addictive!  Very glad I have it on my Kindle. It was a surprise when I could finally download it!
B00FWAZ87I|5.0|The album takes you on a musical journey. The voices of all of the singers (Tommy Karevik, ect.) are exceptional and the instrumentals are outstanding. Arjen outdid himself with this record, assembling an amazing array of talented musicians to help bring this interesting story to life. The more you listen to it, the better it gets. There are so many layers to the story both instrumentally and lyrically that one listen isn't sufficient to absorb it all and it can easily be enjoyed time and time again.<br />It is a long record, a little over an hour and a half, and you really owe it to yourself to listen to it in one listen with lyrics in front of you. If not every time, at the very least the first few playthroughs. The intricacies are best heard when the album is listened to in one sitting as many songs run together and build on each other.<br />A great record, worth a listen.
B0019IB0II|5.0|I thought she explained the  brain very well. Also would help you understand someone who has had a stroke. It also could encourage some one to keep on trying to keep on getting better.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love playing candy crush. Fun, challenging, addictive. So glad this game is on my  kindle, now I can play anywhere. Recommend for anyone, challenge your friends or just try to beat your own best scores. Try it, you'll like it.
B00EGMQIJ0|3.0|This is a pretty good futuristic novel, although, really not so far in the future. It's a pretty suspenseful book, and has some interesting ideas in it. Kind of depressing to me, actually. But it was ok. I did finish it since I really wanted to find out what happened in the end, but was glad when I was done with it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it is a great game for young people and old alike.<br /><br />my young man enjoys it a lot. it is a lot of fun
B003VANOFY|5.0|This is the best all around headset I have used that wasn't a bluetooth. It works great with my Dragon program, holds a charge for a long time, and has a wonderful base for the adapter with a long cord, so it isn't in the way. I would definitely recommend this headset.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|so far so good. 4 out of 5 stars only because something is shutting my kindle off not sure if its this game so that being said to be continued.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love the game! Very hard on some levels but you keep trying and finally you get it. Hard to put down.
B00E9PMML2|5.0|One of the greatest movies series of all time.  Since I finally upgraded my old blue tube televisions to the wide screen LCD/LED televisions and only having the older DVD's offering the standard screen sizes, I wanted the newer disks offering the wide screen formats as I tend to watch these movies once a year.<br /><br />Some of the specifications of these newer DVD/Blu-ray disks published on October 2013 were not completely disclosed within Amazon.com's product information, likely due to this product containing both DVD & Blu-ray disks which usually contain different video resolutions and audio bitrates only due to disk capacities.<br /><br />For Linux users, see Note 2 concerning encrypted Blu-ray movies.

B00ARF92HK|5.0|This adaptation was a lot better than the earlier version.  I think it did not do as well in theaters as a lot of people thought this was another remake of an old movie.  This movie is not a remake and deserves 5 stars.  Good special effects, and lots of action I most certain I will watch this again.
006202406X|1.0|I enjoyed the first two books and couldn't wait for this one.  Very disappointed and not referring about the end.  It was very hard to get into and the only \\"excitement\\" happened in the last 50 pages or so. You can probably read a couple of the one star ratings to find out what happens and avoid the boredom.  I keep wondering how Veronica Roth can get it so wrong.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|LOVE the Chromecast. I use it all the time. It's pretty much all I use to watch tv shows and movies.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|With two children under two I need sleep desperately. This app helps me and my kids get the zzz we need. I enjoy playing it during the day as well.
B0054X3FQO|4.0|Having Miranda's purpose in mind - the hope that the content in &#34;Treasure Yourself&#34; helps inspire young ladies - I have to say this was great to read. I was 15 when I got it and was going through a REALLY rough time in my life. This book helped give me short methods and ideas for learning more about myself and what I was worth, but it is only of great help when you read it as a &#34;guide&#34;, rather than a book. I loved the affirmations and became really passionate about them, making my own and sharing them. I was so moved by Miranda's heart and so blessed that this book helped lift my spirits,  I bought a few more copies to give to some of my friends. This book is geared toward pre-teens especially, and would make a great gift for a young lady unsure of their purpose, or feeling overwhelmed by so many new changes in their life. I cannot wait for her second book &#34;Empower Yourself&#34; coming soon!
B001FB55I0|4.0|Good movie. Great price for this 2 disc Blu-ray. Worth buying for this price. This movie is a stand-alone movie.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|This is an excellent book about the plight of women in Afghanistan.  Anyone who liked  The Kite Runner must read this book
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I don't even know where to begin. So I'm giving this book four stars because I loved this series so much not because I necessarily love this book so much. The only thing is that over the last two years I've inhaled every word, waiting in anticipation of what going to happen next, to find out what everything meant and then to end with a death. I mean it seems to be the easiest way to end something from a movie to a tv series to a book because death is final. There's no coming back. No more birthdays. No suffering and hard decisions. No getting married. No having children. No growing old together. All that's left is the Tris hole shape left in everyone's life and bittersweet moment when you realize she was only sixteen and has entire life to live and she didn't. Plus the fact that she was so special she could withstand even the death serum just to go down from a gun shot wound?! I also get that Tobias and Tris were in love even though they had only been together for a matter of weeks if not a couple of months and I know that because Veronica Roth killed Tris she's not going to introduce possible love interest in the last pages of the book but the thing that gets me is that in the epilogue she made him seem like this was the love that was going to define his entire life and that there was no room to ever possibly move on. He's was only twenty in the end and had his whole life to live and love. Also some of the character continuity just doesn't add up.
B003QTNFHW|4.0|A wonderful new twist on a great classic story. Johnny Depp makes a great Mad Hatter. Very entertaining/fun movie. Will recommend to friends
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad this is finally on kindle, so now I can play all the time!!!  Unfortunately, my husband now gets to waste all my lives,  but I can learn to deal with that.
B00F031XPS|5.0|This new documentary was made by Experience Hendrix, LLC because the 1973 film is horrible! It was nice to see some of the people in that 1973 film in this new one like Jimi's old squeeze Fayne Piedgeon (or however you spell her name).<br />  It also showed some classic interviews with Al Hendrix, I wish it showed more and more of the new interview with Billy Cox! The Billy Cox interview would have made a great DVD extra.<br /><br /> Just for the Extra's alone makes this a purchase. Why has it taken all these years to finally see the July 1970 Randalls Island gig?<br />One thing you'll notice if you're any kind of Jimi fan is that Leon is absent from this DVD completely! What an insult and the continued bitterness by Jamie goes on! Leon has a lot to say and would made an excellent edition to the DVD, thanks janie for nothing!<br />  Leo prob wasn't allowed to be in the Doc! anything that comes from Janie wont have anything to do with Leon! Sad!<br />  Also....the \\"extras\\", I can see it now, next year the full DVD for NY Randalls Island will be out and more newly discovered Miami Pop film will make a new DVD. Thats how Experience Hendrix does things, string you along and sucker you out of every dollar they can!<br />  One example is on the DVD extra of Randall's Island \\"Foxy Lady\\" is absent, yet it is shown in the 1970 film \\"Free\\" also known as \\"The day the music died\\". So there is footage of that, plus all the multiple camera angels of the footage, there is no way that was all that was available.<br />  2014 look for the new DVD on it to make another buck.
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|Love his style, lots of great history in this one. So many interesting facts that have really gotten lost over the years. A very entertaining read.
B00BPDR3F6|4.0|Gilbert is a good writer and this is original and creative. It could have been done with about 50 fewer pages.
B00C7607BC|5.0|The price was great. Video new as promised. Condition was excellent.  Digital copy works with iTinues and other media. Blue ray extras are great
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I enjoyed this book much more than the previous. All my favorite characters were back and there was so much going on it made it hard to put the book down.  Can't wait for book 6 to be available.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Excellent! Re-read or read &#34;The Shining&#34; first.<br /><br />I love Stephen King! And this was a great sequal to &#34;The Shing&#34;.<br /><br />Need I say more.....
0439023521|5.0|I´ve watched the movie, but in contrast to the book, I prefer the book, interesting passages, the author develops a lot of imagination and readers like me, the book make us imagine that unknown and strange world of the Capitol and the twelve districts.  I know this book was published years ago, but I´m very happy reading this book.
B005RAO0GS|5.0|I love Florence and the Machine, especially this album. She has an enchanting style when it comes to her lyrics and sound. I love it.
B00F8MI9NK|5.0|It's a rare follow-up movie that's as good as the first, but this one is. There is a good story line, independent of the Monsters, Inc. movie, good character development, and a great moral to the story. Totally enjoyed it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Everyone should be playing.  Works the brain and keeps you challenged.  It is fun challenging your family and friends.  Awesome game.
