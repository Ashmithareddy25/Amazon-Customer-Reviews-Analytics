B00BSBT8M6|1.0|Whoever gave this movie more than one star must be out of their mind, or are paid by the production company so they can mislead the public into buying/renting this joke they call a movie.<br /><br />I was annoyed of the entire movie. Basically you are on a boat stranded with animals the whole time.<br /><br />Then all the animals eat each other with the tiger, \\"Richard Parker,\\" coming out victorious.<br /><br />The kid spends 99.9 % of his time on a boat in an ocean trying to fend off the tiger.<br /><br />Very few good scenes. Definitely not worth your time.<br /><br />The End.
B002CLBJPK|5.0|It's just a nice imaginative movie that never gets old. When you want a movie you can watch that is not graphic with sex & gore, where the bad guys get their comeuppance, &#34;Bed Knobs & Broomsticks&#34; does the job. Plus you can watch it with kids & not worry if you'll be embarrassed/bored by the mindless dribble of most stuff being be turned out for family consumption.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|My 7 year old is obsessed with the movie.  It is loaded with humor for everyone to appreciate.  So don't be a gutter snipe and check it out.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is the best book I've read in a long time. Heart wrenching and devastating yet it warms you to see the kindness and beauty in the midst the destruction that war and hatred stir.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|It's a fun game but it gets boring kind of quickly. The story is really cool if you like ghost stories.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is a awesome app you can choose up to 4 cards it's a awesome game me and my cousin play it all the time you the costumer should by this app
B003B02OOG|5.0|A little different than a standard full-length Grisham that only left me wanting to know more of the characters.  I say this, only because Grisham is such an exceptional writer, and can make you wish you knew the great Southern characters he describes.  I laughed with most of the characters, both their perfections and flaws, and would highly recommend the Ford County:  Stories.
0374531269|5.0|Fantastic and important read. It's not a book - it's someone's life. I burned through the pages in a matter of hours... Everyone should read this - not only is it well written, it awakens a sense of compassion and heightened responsibility. At the very least, we need to be aware of the circumstances that other human beings--just like you and me--are living through in today's world.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun way to make the best of your time. Most likely will get hooked on this game. Gotta think outside of the box. Hopefully this game is not too addictive.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Pick this game up and you<br /> won't be able to put it down! The graphics are colorful! Great game to pass time!
B007D5E7C2|5.0|I love this move ! IT came fast and in great shape I have hard a hard time finding part 1 and 2  so was very grateful to find for such a great price
B009NY43NY|5.0|I did not buy Dead After After when it was first released because of all the negative reviews. I am so glad that I ordered and read it. I am very happy with the way Mrs. Harris ended the book. Sookie has grown up and has chosen the best guy....the one she can be happy and grow old with.
0525425772|5.0|I am so happy with John Grisham's novels for teen readers.  This first book got me hooked.  Boone is good at defending pet owners in pet court as well as solving mysteries. I have purchased every Theo Boone novel Grisham has written.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This is a very great game, a game that I have been searching for, for a very long time, anyone who likes a game where you build your own city I highly recommend this one.
1441761268|5.0|I have both the novel and dvd on this book. It is a story you can't put down or stop listening to. It is like the south was in those days between slaves and plantation owners. Could be cruel at times and also loving.
B00B2QG3K2|5.0|Another good album by Paramore.  I'm a Paramore fan and they continue to put out good music. I would recommend to a fellow fan.
0425263924|5.0|Love this series and love this book as much as the first two.  Hoping this is not the last book in this series.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Hi love this game it first when I started playing I saw sure but When I started I loved it sooooooooooo  much I recommend.
B00CL68NOG|5.0|Loveable characters and a great cast! WHats not to love? I found myself laughing out loud in parts and really liked the dynamics between Streisand and Rogen! A fun movie for all!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Love these two characters. Once I got the book, I couldn't wait to dive in and wasn't disappointed.  Can't wait to see what Sylvia Day writes for their next journey together.  I do hope a continuation book comes out soon, I don't think I can wait long.  I'm hooked.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT ONE!! This was so much fun, and totally worth the money! When does the next one come available?
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|its ok .I have a time getting my birds to go where I want them to go, but thats what makes it fun
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surf!!!! It is literally my life! I especially love how many challenges you have to face!!! However I would like it more if they had more characters for lower prices! But overall it is an amazing game. BRAVO SUBWAY SURF!!!!!!!!!!!
B00AZF13KG|5.0|Disc arrived in good condition.<br /><br />Natalie Portman as Marty steals the movie, just an extraordinary performance by an extremely young Natalie in too few scenes. The rest of the movie is alright, but Natalie's portrayal of Marty is simply wonderful and elevates the movie to something much better than its pieces.
B003BWERF8|4.0|It paired with several bluetooth devices but not the Bose Sounddock 10 with bluetooth adapter.  Actually, it did one time only but there was no repeating it.<br /><br />It is a nicely designed product.
B0063GORYU|5.0|it is very timecomusing. I have a hard time winning,because I usly make the wrong moveand have to start over
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Defending Jacob kept me on the edge of my seat right up until the end.  There were some interesting twists and as a parent, some difficult decisions to be made and questioned.
B004M5HUXE|5.0|Amazing book.  Saw the movie but the book was much better.  This is better than fifty shades of gray anyday
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I LOVE THIS APP! Its perfect for just about any mood. I use it to unwind after a stressful day. and I also use it to fall asleep when it seems like I'll never go to bed. The sounds are soothing and relaxing. It's wonderful for sleep, relaxing and meditating. The quality of the sounds amazes me. (Yesterday  had the thunderstorm button on and forgot that t wasn't actually raining.)
B0063IH60K|5.0|love it I play it all the spare time I have.  I like that there are no two alike and that I will once in a while
B0090KZDSK|3.0|At the end of the book I felt like not a whole lot actually happened.  The book was one long played out issue and I believe that the story could have just ended in this book.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong though, I do love Eva and Gideon's story!! I'm a huge fan but was left feeling a little bit disappointed in the end. Sorry :(
0061547840|5.0|I know most people find him annoying but I think it is because they are jealous of him. It is a good, fun an easy book to read. I have so much energy to start my own business now, just what I needed it.
B003WQT2YY|5.0|This is particularly one of the best musician/movie fusions. The combination of music overlapped onto the musician's story is a potent combination.<br /><br />This is a must see for anyone who has ever composed something.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|I love this game alot, but when i try to visit friend's towns it says error, the game also freezes. Maybe this will be fixed, and i don't get how people would want to spend real money on a digital pony, this definitely needs to be fixed.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Outstanding  graphics and challenging opponents and if you get this game friend me on amazongamecircle as ghoster 21 so please get the game guaranteed you play and play so go have with this awesome game
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I think plants vs zombies is my favorite game on my tablet<br />I cant seem to stop playing<br />Im addicted
B0000C9ZBW|5.0|I have been getting lots of compliments on the style of the watch along with the band. Since it isnt the normal leather or metal strap. It is small and thin so doesnt get knocked or bumped on things when you are moving your arm around. I really like this watch and glad I purchased.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Lots of fun for hours and hours :-)  try to beat your own times in each level get faster and better.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I literally could not put this book down. Finished it in two days. The fastest I have ever read any book.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|This game is a fun experience. It teaches you to act fast. It's a fun way to entertain yourself. I like how it gets more difficult the longer you play<br /> I don't like how it takes to long to raise your multiplyer.
B001A4LYN2|5.0|Anyone who doesn't give this movie 4-5 Stars doesn't need to write movie reviews ever again.  This is one of the best movies of all time
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|The story continues straight off from the last book. I was concerned how it would be wrapped up near he end as I thought it was a trilogy, glad to see there are more books planned.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|This documentary film with Robert McNamara, US Secretary of Defense for Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson, was incredibly insightful. McNamara shares his insight and the important lessons he's learned throughout his long life and career and provides us an insight into the conduct of warfare not only of the past, but also of the present. And given the current state of world affairs, it is more important than ever, that we remember the mistakes and tragedies of the past. The film also gives us a clear picture of the personality of McNamara himself, a man who tried to do good and sincerely regretted what had happened in Vietnam for the rest of his life.
B00A2H9PLG|1.0|Copycat redundancies to the recent \\"Olympus Has Fallen\\" aside, \\"White House Down\\" is an unintentionally laughable action movie that wallows in involuntary cynicism about how America -- or screenwriter James Vanderbilt at least -- views the White House as the world's biggest crime ring. Buried in a shallow grave just beneath its veneer of absurdly cheesy Americana platitudes lays mocking subtext, twitching with spastic gestures and pointing awkwardly at a corrupt political system eating itself from the inside out. U.S. President Jack William Sawyer (played by Jamie Foxx) can't wait to explain his occupational predicament to the first pair of ears that comes along. \\"The first term is all about getting reelected,\\" he tells an upstart Secret Service agent before explaining that now, during his second term, he is finally ready to do something that will make a difference. Sound familiar? You'd think he was petitioning for single-term-limits for the Presidential office. Interestingly, the ever-buff Channing Tatum dons the Edward Snowden mantle as John Cale [no, not the Welsh composer and musician of Velvet Underground fame, although that would have been interesting]. Like Snowden, Cale has a history of not finishing things -- e.g., school. But our would-be Secret Service agent bodyguard has friends [mainly female] in high places. He went to college with White House Secret Service official Finnerty (Maggie Gyllenhaal), one of President Sawyer's right-hand agents. Still, when Cale arrives at the White House for a job interview with Agent Finnerty, with his 12-year-old daughter Emily (Joey King) in tow, she quickly gives him the thumbs-down -- so much for friends in high places. Cale is a perfect outlier, ready to pounce for the true cause of liberty when he gets a chance. On this particular day a crew of generic baddies sneak into the White House to hack into its computers, take hostages, and see how far down the line of presidential succession they can move the title of Commander-In-Chief. Naturally, Cale's daughter falls into the hostage category while our able-bodied hero takes personal responsibility for getting the President out alive while all hell breaks out around them. You can't help but transpose Barak Obama into Foxx's character during goofy action sequences, as when Cale and President Sawyer climb up through an elevator shaft. The effect is mildly comical if only because it's so hard to imagine Obama doing anything so remotely athletic and risky. Although its plot gymnastics are idiotic to the point of parody, \\"White House Down\\" makes a smart point about how vicious, cunning, and vengeful America's power-hungry politicians are. They all want to be king for a day, and don't give a damn about how many civilians get crushed, punished, or put out of work and home in the process. The best thing this cinematic assault-on-the-senses has going for it is its title. Like Edward Snowden, America is on its own and there are very few places to hide.mander-In-Chief.

B001PU8N0I|5.0|The acting in this series is so good!!  In the first week I had it I watched it 3 times!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Nice application for a basic Klondike Solitaire.  Ads aren't too pesky and are easy to skip.  Hours of fun for free!
B000LB7G00|4.0|it's good for me, is very nice for design program, I would like upgrade this product in the future, for now is ok.
B005LAII3U|3.0|This movie turned out to be better than I thought it would. Mostly because of Kate Beckinsale.  She plays a great bad-azz.  The movie surprisingly looked low budget and weak special effects. It wasn't about Mars and the only high tech things they had were a tunnel thru the earth and hovering magnetic cars and I guess these android police guys that looked to much like guys in metal suits. Colin Farrell just looked like a guy playing a part in a movie and not real convincing. Kate Beckinsale showed in this movie she's not only gorgeous but a great actress. The rest of the movie was a little weak.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved it! I'm sad that I have to wait for the next book to know what happens to Eva and Gideon, but so excited to know that there will be even more to the story
B004UHL9EK|5.0|But I don't know what I dislike about it. Lots of alarms and timers. I don't know what all of the buttons do, but haven't really tried to figure them out either.
B001NOQI3U|5.0|This was an award winning film for Barbra!  The character, Yentl, had a hunger for knowledge that drove her to desparate measures.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the writing style of the writer of these books. They were enjoyable to read! I can't wait to read more books by this author soon!
B00B4VI8MQ|2.0|The game is fun and challenging but I don't like that you get to play very little before they lock it and expect you to buy the game.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is a truly amazing book. If the 4,000 other 5 star reviews don't convince you to buy it, mine wouldn't either. So rather than review it (already done 4,000 times) I'm proposing a soundtrack.<br /><br />\\"I Remember The Sun\\"- XTC<br /><br />\\"Going Underground\\"- The Jam<br /><br />\\"People (Living Underground)\\"- Drawn From Bees<br /><br />\\"Goodbye Blue Sky\\"- Pink Floyd<br /><br />\\"When The World Is Running Down (You Make The Best of What's Still Around)\\"- The Police<br /><br />Listen to these songs while reading it (and you must read it) to make the experience even eerier.
B000ICZD4I|5.0|Strong, unforgettable characters with an interesting story line.  Have watched it several times on VHS and now purchasing the DVD.
B00846REIS|5.0|I absolutely love this book! It will keep you wanting more through the whole book. Would read again! Love it!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|The question is...Can You Escape?  This game is challenging and fun. I found myself replaying games. Trying to be a bit faster.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|ITS SO FUN!!!!!!!!!! its kind of hard but so much fun it really works your mind .<br />GO. GET. THIS. APP. RIGHT. NOW. OR. YOU'LL.  REGRET. IT.
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|Well , first off it's really blurry and really frustrating to work with it is like slow or something. I have actually bought apps from this company and they are all blurry. It suck! Please do not waste you time...
1423101502|5.0|The Last Olympian is the fifth, and last book in The Lightning Thief series by Rick Riordan.  I had to order four more copies to go along with the five I already had, as my many students in my classes read through the series, and the waiting list was long.  Great series - and this book was just as good as the first, which often isn't the case.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Thanks for a unique puzzle game. Added a different twist from the other puzzles I've done. I love the simplicity of the story line and the graphics. Each level builds off itself. Thanks again.
B008QE9XD2|5.0|I saw this film at the theater and enjoyed it very much.  With Johnny Depp as Barnabas Collins and some other characters thrown in there that you will recognize from the TV series, this is a must see for the kids of that generation.  With a cool soundtrack and some funny moments, this makes for a fun night of reminiscing with new twist.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Been playing Minecraft when it first came out on the pc. This game is great for spending your time.when you have nothing better to do the only set backs are TNT does not explode in creative when on fire, no mine shafts or carts, and the lack of some enemies on the game. This game is great even without those, but it would be better with some better updates than a few buckets and animal spawners.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|Love this golf solitaire game!  Great graphics and love the sound effects. I skip the shorts about the gopher though. Good game to play while waiting.
B005JR3Y5W|5.0|This show makes me laugh for real. Not a courtesy laugh, but really laugh. They are so wonderfully weird, but make so much since together. If you like to laugh at obviously weird things in life, you will love this show.
1878424319|5.0|I have now purchased this book for good friends and family members.  The words within it are life changing. I heartily recommend it to others. Thanks also for the great price!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app. it has great animation and grafics. I would highly recommend. this game for all ages. very well made.@
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It works very well. Can easily bookmark items and make notes. I don't know of any other bibles available but this one is any easy one.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Lots of fun.slightly challenging but not too difficult.I am anxious for more levels to be released. Makes you think.<br /><br />I recommend it
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|My mom missed seeing this movie so I was happy to be able to purchase it for her.<br />I know she will treasure having it:-)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game. I love the real life interactive feel the game has.  It makes you feel as though you really are caring for your own horse.
B009Z5BPZK|5.0|I loved the show, but so sad it ended.  I felt like the last season was way too short, but oh well.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|Another overrated Gaiman novel. I'm a huge fan of his amazingly-plotted and well-told stories 'Stardust' and 'Neverwhere', but after sitting through 'American Gods', 'The Graveyard Book', and now this, can't help but feel that maybe I'm not as huge a fan like I had initially thought. A serviceable story with one or two nice lines about childhood and nostalgia, otherwise it's written with the grace and style of a 10th grader's book report.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|This is a gateway book, meant to get you from reflected in you to the 4th book in the series. Most authors do that to get you to keep reading. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the book; I just hated the open ending.
B00821OX98|4.0|Quite entertaining.  Amazing how none of the main characters die but that wouldn't make sense right.  Still enjoy this series and will keep on watching it until it is discontinued.
B003G4W49C|5.0|My son read this book from his Summer reading list.  I became intrigued when he read the book while others were watching a movie. I read the book thinking it was written for kids.  This book is a great commentary on the human race.  I was stunned and enjoyed the book to a great degree.
B008XCM18Q|5.0|I really loved reading this book. I don't read that much, but this book kept my attention and kept me wanting to come back for more.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|The first two books were great! This story was rushed, and seemed all over the place. I wish the author spent more time diving into Gideon's background.
B000006NXP|5.0|I have heard many performances of this work, one of my favourite pieces of the Romantic era. This brings a poignancy to the 2nd movement that is heart breaking. The only performance to come near this one is one I heard years by Barenboim.
B007ZGBZHE|3.0|this is perhaps the most boring pendergast book written.  I would skip it if I had not already read it.
B005C8ENI0|5.0|I think this should be made into a series because it was a very good Movie that could go even further.
B008QTVNUI|4.0|Despite the violence, the show was compelling, intelligent, and literate. I look forward to another season of intrigue and suspense.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|I am glad this was offered to me as it was a book I wanted to read for a long time.  AS a novel on the kindle though, I think I may have preferred an easier way to flip back to passages I had read.  The novel would have been to weighty to comfortably carry around to do that so I am glad I had it on kindle.  The piece is soooo immense as it stands, that reading it was tedious at times.
B00003L2I0|5.0|Gilbert I love this cd. I am filled with nostalgia. Alone again naturally and We Will always bring a tear to my eye.
B00C1CO0XS|3.0|I was disappointed with this CD. It was not what I thought it would be. Some artists did not perform as well as I would like.
B005MMZ63C|5.0|This black and white classic stands the test of time.  I love the old school over dramatic acting, heady dialogue, and exaggerated set design.  I was surprised at the dark, moody theme and tragic ending - not the typical Hollywood fairy tale I expect from that era.
B006Z1XY7E|4.0|Only wish I could access it through iTunes as well.. or listen to it on my apple device... as it stands I have to listen to it on my pc
B007FDE4Y8|4.0|After fiddling for a long time and looking on Youtube over and over, I've got this unit working pretty well.  There were no instructions and you have to make sure not lose some of the small parts off the unit when opening the package.  Otherwise it provides what I think is an excellent effect for the money.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|For a post apocalyptic read this one takes an interesting turn.  It seems as if there is no real hope for the future beyond the silos.  Almost as if they are space ships traveling towards the same star but unable to get there.  Liked!
B00AH8FTT2|5.0|The Best Kept Secret was really good,loved the Clifton Chronicles am waiting for Book 4 hope Jeffrey Archer hurries writing it<br />Del
B003JH8LPW|5.0|I read this many, many years ago on a PDA!  After reading Inferno I decided to reread this one.  Every bit as exciting the second time.  Back then I bought a new PDA and sent the old one to hook my son on Dan Brown.  It worked!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I really enjoy playing bingo blitz. I have met so many great friends and it is just a great way to enjoy when their is nothing to do. It's even very hard to put down. AWESOME game
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Loving this whole series!  Great read after the &#34;Fifty...&#34; trilogy!  Good and juicy, similar to the Fifty series in some ways, but without the SMBD aspect.  Love the twists and turns of the story line and the mystery of events.
B0057567P0|2.0|I am disappointed, it won't boot my MacBook Pro 17\\" (2006) OS X 10.6.8. Also, can't really tell if it is backing up my 350GB HD any faster than USB 2.0. It took over 4 hours for a full backup to a new Seagate 2TB external drive.
B001F12J0C|5.0|Excellent film!  I am sure that followers of Matt Damon will agree...this trilogy is perfect for gifts and personal enjoyment.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I tried to enjoy this game for a month, but too many glitches: not loading, told I wasn't connected to internet, cash went missing, when earned cash I couldn't use it, told couldn't build because I needed 6 people to support ... had 8.<br />I tried submitting complaints or questions ... an ordeal in itself, and was told to reload so I lost all progress and started again with same issues.<br />I deleted the game.
B00846REIS|5.0|This was a recommendation of something to read after finishing &#34;Fifty Shades.&#34;  Not sure which one I like better!  Although this one starts out similar to the Fifty Shades' first book, it liked the mystery aspect of this read.  Highly recommend this if you liked Fifty Shades!
B001BKTEZA|5.0|To say that this book is great is &aacute;n understatement.  The significance of this book lies in its' human spirit, how we as humans can show compassion and prevail through the most difficult of circumstances.  This gives hope to people born in opulence.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|great puzzle game for all ages and helps pass time when waiting, it's hard to put down and easy  enough to play anywhere.
B002BJGYU8|5.0|The DVDs are perfect. There was a couple dents in the package but I suppect they resulted from the shipping process. I am very ahppy with my product.
1469220717|5.0|I was hesitant to get this on audiobook, but had a long drive coming up and needed something to keep me awake.  This did it!  Next thing I knew I was almost to my destination.  Although the voices on audiobooks tend to annoy me sometimes this one was quite as bad as a few others I've heard.  When the narrator tried to speak as though she was a different character in that seen it did grind on my nerves a bit.  BUT overall I loved it.
B002NT3B52|4.0|I found this book fascinating. I Learned a lot about dog's abilities and there senses and how they see the world.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I've gotta say, I've wanted to read this book for a LONG time. The price is the only thing that's held me back for so long. I finally stopped being cheap and bought it and let me say...It is worth EVERY last cent. Warning: You will cry. No matter how much you say you won't, you will. I tried so hard not to. Its just a heartbreaking story of life and love. John Green does an extremenly wonderful job of making you feel connected to the characters which makes this book so difficult to read. You'll love them, hate them, be annoyed by them, and feel for them. Its a sad story but Green somehow manages to make you laugh out loud at the perfect moments. You've been warned. This is a beautiful story and I reccomend it to anyone and everyone. Before you read it, you may want to get a new box of tissues and keep em close. You're gonna need them. Enjoy it, you won't be able to put it down!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I loved this book and my 12 year old son loved it just as much. Something every middle schooler on up, boy or girl should read.
B00AZMFK3K|3.0|When Star Trek Into Darkness came into a cinema near me, I knew I had to instantly go and see it. For one thing, the trailers looked great, promising a dark, action-packed film where the stakes were high and the threat was even higher. For another thing, it had Benedict Cumberbatch in it, a consistently good player, as well as a fine cast that included Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Zoe Saldana, Karl Urban, and Peter Weller. The reviews were (mostly) positive, too. So I went and saw it. I had a good time.<br /><br />But I left the theatre with mixed feelings. When I was invited to see it a second time, I saw the film with renewed concentration. I weighed the good, and I weighed the bad. And the film was found wanting.<br /><br />But before you click that dislike button, hear me out. But be warned, there are spoilers below.<br /><br />First, lets see what I DID like:<br />1. Benedict Cumberbatch is the boss! He makes every film he is in better, whether he's acting as a giant dragon or a fussy detective. He is up to par, as expected, in Into Darkness. He is definitely the high point of the film, even if his character has got some script issues.<br /><br />2. Another equally good antagonist is horror icon Peter Weller as Admiral Marcus. His scene-stealing ultra-bad-dude gets some great lines (\\"You will run this bastard down\\") and fun scenes. He reminds me of the film it could have been.<br /><br />3. Michael Giaccino. Wow! The J.J. Abrams staple has outdone himself with his score, which ranges from beautiful piano to pounding drums. The score in the London hospital scenes is incredibly brilliant.<br /><br />4. The action is great! And there's lots of it to behold. Love the mixes of martial arts!<br /><br />5. You know who else I liked? That little mute alien that travels around with Scotty. No kidding! Give that guy an Oscar!<br /><br />Now, for what I did NOT like:<br />1. OK, lets start with the very beginning. I sat down in the darkened cinema, and the film began. Everything was blurry and out of focus. Aha! I forgot to put on my 3D glasses. I put them on my head. Everything was dark, blurry, and out of focus. Please tell me I am not the only one who thinks 3D is overrated. Like this review if you think 3D is overrated. Now, I completely understand 3D as a TOOL to tell stories. James Cameron used it brilliantly in Avatar, as did Scorsese in Hugo, Ang Lee in Life of Pi, and Peter Jackson in The Hobbit. Those films are only made BETTER because of it.<br /><br />But let me get this straight: 3D should not be put in for making money, to appeal to younger audiences, or as a joke. Superhero movies do not need to be in 3D. The Great Gatsby does not need to be in 3D. Neither does The Last Airbender, Alice in Wonderland, or The Jonas Brothers 3D Concert Video. Star Trek Into Darkness did not NEED to be in 3D.<br /><br />2. The opening salvo looked like it was being filmed by a hyper-caffeinated teenager with ADD. A person beside me muttered \\"It looks like a video game.\\" Indeed, with the bright colors, fake-looking 3D, lens flares, and out-of-focus shaky cam so shaky it would make Jason Bourne jealous, it did indeed remind one of a video game. But is that a bad thing?<br /><br />3. And here's my biggest problem with the film: the lack of emotion.<br />Near the beginning of the movie, a Starfleet officer is blackmailed by Khan into blowing up the London Starfleet headquarters. We are supposed to feel sorry for this guy, we are almost TOLD to feel sorry for him (with lots of lingering shots on his sick daughter and saddened face), but we do not. The explosion itself is cold and distant, and not in a good way.<br />Iron Man 3 also has a couple suicide bombings, and while it's not a perfect film, you actually feel for the characters. They appear human in our eyes, and the incident is all the more shocking because the stakes are that much higher.<br />Not so in Into Darkness. Instead of feeling sorry for the characters, the audience instead iswondering how such a tiny ring makes such a ludicrously large explosion.<br /><br />Even worse, the explosion is never brought up again, except very briefly. We see no ordinary people affected by it, which makes it hard to feel for the characters, and worse, we don't feel that Khan is actually much of a villain either. Are we supposed to feel sorry for him? That never comes about either.<br /><br />In another scene, Spock and Uhura talk about their feelings while flying in Klingon airspace. \\"Are they really doing this right now?\\" another person beside me asked. I knew what Abrams was trying to do. He was lulling us into a false sense of calm, just to pull a jump scare. And, on queue, it happened. Boom. Yawn. Did I mention that said action scene was AWESOME?<br /><br />There is one action scene where Chekov is sliding down the floor of the Enterprise screaming. I thought he was going to die. But he didn't. The action fell flat. If Chekov had died, who knows how brilliant this film could have been? In the original Star Trek franchise, Spock died. Sure, he was raised again, but at the cost of the Enterprise. To quote another critic, the first series weren't perfect, but at least they were daring. They raised the stakes.<br />Kirk dies in Star Trek Into Darkness, but he is resurrected a few minutes later. Why didn't he stay dead, at least until the inevitable sequel? Think how brave that film could have been! Even when Admiral Pike dies we don't feel sad. It just felt like the mandatory killing off of *that* character to generate sympathy.<br /><br />4. The script. Now this is a time where we can all rally together and point fingers at someone: Damon Lindelof. The guy who ruined Lost, Cowboys and Aliens, Prometheus, and Star Trek Into Darkness. That guy is cinematic poison. It took a second viewing to see all the chinks in the armour. As I said before, Cumberbatch is phenomenal, but when he says \\"You, you can't even break a rule, how can you be expected to break bone?\\" the seriousness falls out of the story. Lindelof is trying too hard to give him cool lines. Then there's the question of the misogynistic, unnecessary, gratuitous, completely offensive changing scene with Alice Eve (is it just me or is her character somewhat unnecessary?). This got so many bad reviews that Lindelof had to issue an official apology via Twitter.<br />There are a myriad of plotholes pointed out by other cinemaphiles. Some you notice and care about, some you don't.<br />Namely, there's the little \\"Khan's magic blood\\" twist, which gave many reviewers the impression that Abrams did not know whether he wanted to distance himself from the first franchise and create something new, or follow in older footsteps. The film tries to \\"homage\\" older films, but only succeeds in making a mess.<br /><br />...<br /><br />The result? Not a BAD film. No, not at all. Just a film that could have been so much greater. Did I hate Star Trek Into Darkness? I rather enjoyed it; it's not a bad film at all. It's a great action blockbuster. Abrams and Co. have created a film we can all enjoy, regardless of issues. In conclusion: Hov Trek Into Darkness is dun qu' tIv poH 'ej lathl QaQ movie, with op ay!

B006VA3ZEG|1.0|DO NOT, DO NOT, DO NOT get sucked into this Amazon product.  You cannot hook up a device via HDMI to watch on a regular TV set with friends and family.  This is a terrible, weak imitation of Netflix -- It's like painting a Monet on black velvet.  Don't waste your time or money if you want to watch on a TV through your computer or iPhone with an HDMI cable.  Not going to happen because these geniuses have a very small tool box.
B004GYY714|1.0|I signed up for this because there was a specific radio show I wanted to hear, and I can't find it.  There isn't anywhere for me to search for the show that I want.  You have to scroll down tons of shows and hope you find it.  Maybe I don't get it, but it doesn't work for me if I can't find the radio show I want.
B00C5W3SBE|3.0|Children love this film. They love the colours, the humour, the story, and the magic. Adults find this film completely hollow, lacking any emotional development or depth or heart. Before I saw the film (with a group of young children), I watched the \\"Making Of\\" documentary.<br /><br />And it was embarrassing. The entire film was lit-er-all-y (I am not misusing this word, as so many do) a few actors in a GIGANTIC BLUE-SCREEN COVERED ROOM! I am not joking! And it shows onscreen! 75% percent of all you see was made by a computer! And you thought Avatar was bad! The actors must have been embarrassed to act in it! At least the Wicked Witch floated around on wires.<br /><br />Raimi, Raimi, Raimi. You've mastered horror, westerns, and superhero movies, but your Oz does not hold up to your fine resume. It's no more then a children's film; a fun, lush, beautiful, well-acted, respectful (trite, hollow, Disney-fied, special effects-stuffed) children's film.<br /><br />And that has it's own merits in itself, I guess.
0062200909|5.0|A must have for big fans and collectors. I really enjoyed learning the inside details on the process of creating the characters and all the sets and items used in the first movie. The back-story on the film was great, and learning about the &#34;High-Fells&#34; which was cut out of the movie was excellent.<br /><br />Highly recommended,<br /><br />Paul Genesse
B0013FNC38|4.0|I found there was a lot of good songs on this CD, the case was cracked but the CD was I tack.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect from this release. Like most `Ryche fans, I'd become pretty disenchanted with the band. \\"Dedicated to Chaos\\" was definitely their worst release and the whole \\"Cabaret\\" tour left me disgusted. I blamed the majority of the recent failures of the band on Geoff Tate's need to push the band in the direction he wanted to go, which seemed different from where the band had been and what fans wanted. Obviously Tate has a right to go in the direction he wants, but the fans don't have to go along and, for the most part, they haven't.<br /><br />In my opinion, the band splitting up was a good thing. They really could not sink much further and I was not planning to purchase another QR album again. Their more recent albums were simply unlistenable. Once the split happened, Tate took the QR moniker and built his own band, releasing FU. Although that album has been largely trashed, I thought it was a definite step up from \\"Chaos.\\" However, it felt more like a Tate solo album than a QR album, which is logical, given Tate was the only remaining member of QR (unless you count Kelly Gray, which I don't).<br /><br />Now comes \\"Queensryche,\\" the release from the remaining members of QR along with new lead singer Todd La Torre. Obviously, this band has also continued to use the QR name. Apparently the issue of who actually gets to keep the name will be decided in court. I doubt the court will make its decision based on quality of the music released under the two names in recent months, but if it does, the La Torre QR proves their case beyond a reasonable doubt.<br /><br />This album, \\"Queensryche,\\" sounds like pre-\\"Hear in the Now Frontier\\" QR.  While it has touches reminiscent of \\"Operation Mindcrime\\" and \\"Empire,\\" overall the album sounds like early QR releases, including the EP, \\"The Warning,\\" and \\"Rage for Order,\\" as well several slower tracks reminiscent of \\"Promised Land.\\"  In sum, this is the best QR release since \\"Promised Land.\\"  Casual fans may not pick up on the significance of this, but any fan who has witnessed the downward spiral of QR since Chris DeGarmo left knows this is serious praise.<br /><br />\\"Queensryche\\" kicks off with an instrumental number, \\"X2\\" which immediately calls to mind early QR releases.  If you were a fan of \\"Promised Land,\\" you're going to love the second track, \\"Where Dreams Go to Die.\\" A mellow tune, with strong use of the dual guitars, Rockenfield's excellent drumming, soaring vocals by La Torre, and an angry lyric.  It's a new fave for me.<br /><br />The album stays strong with \\"Spore\\" which has an excellent chorus.  \\"In This Light\\" is a very accessible rock/pop-oriented tune. I didn't care for \\"Redemption\\" when I first heard it several weeks ago and I still don't. To me it sounds like generic nu-metal and it is surprising to me, given the strength of the numerous other tracks on this album that QR pushed it out as a debut track for the new album.<br /><br />Some of my other favorites include \\"Midnight Lullaby,\\" \\"A World Without\\" and \\"Open Road.\\" All are slower tunes. I love the fact that the band was able to mix it up on this album with some solid rockers and these slower tunes.  This really harkens back to what they did so well on \\"Promised Land.\\"<br /><br />A few final notes... La Torre is fantastic on this album. Yes, he sounds a lot like Geoff Tate and if I was listening to several of these tracks without knowing better, I'd say it was Geoff. Eventually, I'd hear something that tipped me off it wasn't and this is what's important here. La Torre isn't simply mimicking Geoff Tate, he has his own sound, which happens to be similar to Geoff's. You couple this sound with Queensryche and, of course, it sounds like QR of old. La Torre is stone cold solid on this album and, my apologies to Geoff, as far as I'm concerned, he is the new lead singer for Queensryche.<br /><br />Next - the length of the album. Lots of gripes about this, but not from me. I get it, we live in an age where  people believe more is better. Why get a small fry when I can supersize it? Why get a 16 oz soda when I can have 64 oz? Why have a 35 minute album when I can have 72 minutes? More is not always better. Would it really make this a better album to throw three or four more tracks on it which the band did not feel were ready for prime time? It's a solid album without a real clunker in the bunch and I'll take that over a 72 minute album full of filler any day.  You could sift through the last six releases by Queensryche and not come up with a single track to rival \\"Where Dreams Go to Die\\" or \\"Spore.\\"<br /><br />Finally, the Deluxe Edition of this album is really great.  Three stellar live tracks, some free buttons, a patch, a sticker. I know it's not a huge deal, but it is really a nice gesture to the fans, in my opinion.
B005LAII80|5.0|I am a little biased, I'm a fan of Karl Urban and to a lesser extent Lena Headey.<br /><br />Leaving the embarassing Rob Schneider comedy sidekick routine where it belongs (in the 1990s Judge Dredd) Dredd takes a very serious approach to law enforcement.<br /><br />The opening chase sets the scene, with Dredd as Judge, Jury and Executioner. Life can be harsh in the post apocalyptic Mega City One.<br /><br />Although she failed the test, Cassandra's powerful psychic powers are of interest to the Hall of Justice and Dredd gets to take the rookie out on assessment. Events conspire to trap them in the 200 story Peach Tree tower. Drug Lord Ma-Ma (Lena Headey at her most vicious) wants the Judges dead and uses psychological warfare, blackmail, bribery and brute force.<br /><br />Dredd looks great and sounds great. It almost demands to be seen in 3D with a good or better sound/surround system (there is a 7.1 audio track compatible with Neo X). I've only watched the blu ray in 3D and it looks stunning; the scenes of the time perception altering 'Slo-Mo' drug are used sparingly. I've also watched it on DVD; a friend that did NOT want to see this saw the opening scenes and sat down to watch the entire movie.<br /><br />Along with 'Madagascar 3 - Europe's most Wanted' I use this 3D blu ray to show people what a really good 3D experience can be.

B003VANOFY|5.0|I bought this headset based on Amazon's ranking and boy I was not disappointed at all. This is the best headset (agreed its is just been a week I had them ;)) that I had till now. The surround sound functionality is pretty good and it feels the best surround sound that I have ever heard.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game I love it. It is an amazing game and I think it should be voted for best game for 2013. This is my favourite game on my Kindle and I will be buying more coins later as well. My favourite character is probably Lucy but she is not my only favourite. I like Fresh as well. My review on this game is 10 out of 10. Amazing game.

B007ZGO7EM|4.0|A basic calcualtor, which is all I need on the Kindle Fire HD. I don't need a scientific one or one with other extra functions. I just need a type calculator to assist my decisions or make do for some quick handy math calcuations. It works ok for me, and I will judge over time, if a better one is noticed or this one has some unknown issues.

B003KRJNBW|3.0|The story is set in an apocalyptic America, thirty years after a devastating war. Washington plays the lead who is wandering `west' to deliver a book of great power. He is a fearsome warrior who deals very violently with the assortment of cannibalistic thugs who roam the roads. The crux of the story is his encounter with Gary Oldman, who is trying to re-establish civilization, though his methods aren't  terribly civilized. Oldman wants the book and Washington refuses. More violence.<br /><br />The basic story is not new. Many stories have explored the dim days following the collapse of order and the scavenging needed to survive. Human principles are disgarded by almost everyone and cannibalism is the new fast food. The fresh element here is religion. Washington has a purpose greater than personal survival and he must defy the forces that seek to exploit it. Even so, it is at best only average fair. The fight scenes aren't too special and if you think about it too much, there are some perplexing plot issues.<br /><br />Personally I welcomed the religious element, though I suspect it's not developed sufficiently for the faithful, and it's probably still too much for those who are resistant. It was kinda undone for me anyway in the last scene. The gore and sexual elements are reasonably limited, though there's a bit of language at times (THAT word will apparently outlive anything!). So overall sound enough entertainment but nothing special.
1781162646|5.0|The master story teller is back again with a short novel that is both a ghost story and a coming of age book. All the characters are real, living, breathing individuals fully rendered. The plot line is rather simple and the murder mystery is also straight forward. But the stroll through that golden year of 1973 is spot on. The journey is the treat and the reward. There is only one. An anachronism I thought existed when a character says the famous line \\"do you feel lucky punk\\" from Dirty Harry. I looked that up and Clint Eastwood said that line in 1971 and would be known and used in 1973. Again, this proves King's attention to detail. He also got the mid-range non-franchise amusement parks which existed in the early '70s is also correct. As this book is less than 300 pages, it qualifies for a short story according to the authors typical book. This book should and probably should be made into a movie. I highly recommend it.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This is a great, but maddening game. It is hard to play in a great way, as it is hard to keep the vehicle from rolling over on hills. I keep coming back for more though.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book leaves you on the edge of your seat the entire time it was amazing and I can't wait to finish the next book as well. The book was extremely suspenseful and there wasn't a moment when I didn't want to continue to read and finish the book

B007SGLZP8|3.0|Good story and plot.  I liked how it was laid out piece by piece.  I wanted to like the main character more, but besides being smart and conniving he did things out of a sense of revenge and lacked character.  When Max and Vanessa were deceiving Nathan, supposedly the real bad guy, I was trying to figure out what they were doing and why.  Either the good guy in this story needed to be better or the bad guy needed to be worse.  Even the judge turned out to be a crook and all of the police and government people were inept.  In the end a group of crooks won the day and I could care less.

The movie set a fast pace without too much time spent explaining &#34;the plan&#34;.  I love the humor they were able to inject without making fun of the series and its fans.  I love the call-backs they make to the series, from the rifle Hannibal uses in the opening scene to the 3D movie being watched in the asylum.<br /><br />I'm glad I have this movie in my library.

B009GFEOY8|5.0|I bought this film to test out an SX-70 Model 2 I picked up at a yard sale for $15.  I used the darkslide to shade the film as it ejected, despite the color protection; no sense taking chances on a bright day!  It worked beautifully!  I've taken 3 shots so far, and they are all fantastic.  The color is very nice, and the image has a great softness to it.  No exposure problems or undeveloped spots.  It takes FOREVER to develop (first shot took over an hour) but it was still fun, and the end result was worth it.

B000FC13Y0|4.0|I had been curious about Gaiman's works for a while, and decided to read Stardust as a way to introduce myself to the much talked-about author. While I wouldn't rank this as one of the top 10 fantasy books I've read, I definitely enjoyed Stardust and now feel curious about Gaiman's better-known novels, such as American Gods (which I might read next). Don't expect deep, complex characters you'll fall in love with. However, give Stardust a chance for what it is: a short, light-hearted fantasy narrative that won't change your life but will certainly entertain you.
B00005LOUP|5.0|DVD plays fine, even though it was left in the hot sun, on my car, by the delivery service.<br />My son wanted this movie for his birthday & was upset when we couldn't find it in stores during the summer! Luckily amazon has no seasons!

B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I read this true story in far less time than any other I've read this year because it told a remarkable story about two aviators in World War II, a German fighter pilot and an American bomber pilot, their meeting in the skies over Germany, and the courageous act that bonded them for the rest of their lives. Mr. Makos researched this story well and described it in a way to make it near impossible for the reader to put the book down until the story is fully known.<br /><br />I highly recommend this excellent reading.

B00A32H1B6|2.0|I looked forward to seeing Losey's film in its original theatrical release and was terribly disappointed by many aspects of his staging (see further below).  Because of the uniform excellence of the cast, I was willing to purchase the DVD.  That turned out to be a major mistake because of the DVD's terrible sound quality, as properly remarked in so many of the reviews here.  A competently remastered version is all but mandatory; if that ever happens and I could enjoy at least the vocal performances, I might buy it again.<br /><br />As I said, however, there are major flaws with Losey's staging.  There are moments of breathtaking imaginativeness, most particularly the magic sequence of the Masked Trio, sung while the characters journey by water to Giovanni's villa.  Those few minutes are among the finest operatic moments I have seen on film.  Setting the opening scene in a rainstorm was evocative and well suited to the story line.  I was also impressed by the filming of the second act sextet, during which the various singers find their ways through the backstage mazes of a Renaissance theater and, at the climax of the ensemble, emerge onto the stage of that theater to face a seated aristocratic audience watching the performance.  Unfortunately, too many glaring mistakes in handling the drama itself offset the few impressive moments.<br /><br />The fact that the most damaging of these flaws involve the finales of the 2 acts only adds to their weight in dragging down the production.  The first-act finale depends entirely for its dramatic impact on the fact that Mozart composed 3 different dances, all played at once though they are in different meters (the minuet is in 3/4 time, the others in 2/4 and 6/8).  The impact of these 3 meters heard at the same time depends wholly on their being played in a single ballroom setting, which concentrates the jarring effect Mozart created; this builds tension to an almost unbearable point, when from offstage Elvira cries \\"Genti, aiuto! Aiuto, genti!\\".  Losey inexplicably makes the scene an outdoor carnival, spread over a space equivalent to a gridiron football field.  This completely dissipates the effect of the 3 orchestras with their different meters, and Mozart's intended effect is ruined.  The impressive final image of this act, with Giovanni standing amid thunder and lightning beneath the central dome of his Palladian mansion, cannot make up for Losey's unpardonable blunder here.<br /><br />The same sort of thing happens in the second-act finale.  Losey unforgivably lets the audience see the ghost of the Commendatore at the point when Elvira catches sight of it, thereby undercutting the supreme dramatic effect of the statue/ghost's entrance into Giovanni's dining room.  That should be among opera's most hair-raising moments, but as the audience already knows the ghost is coming, the intended effect of its entrance (underlined by what have rightly been called \\"the most terrible trombone chords in all music\\") is irretrievably lost.<br /><br />The overall balance of the uneven imagery in this film is undeniably negative, and I can sum up my reactions only by saying that Losey evidently knew little about opera, less about Mozart and nothing about Don Giovanni.  Better to invest in a filmed stage production, which is compelled to follow Mozart's original intentions and gets across the opera's dramatic impact to much better effect than does this well-intentioned but deeply flawed film.
B006BG7RI0|5.0|One of the best Black & White movies ever made, if not the best.  Superb collectables with a reasonable price.  Grab one while you still can!  They have raised their price by $15 since I got mine. but this is a one of a kind collectable.  As this is a limited edition the price will keep going up.
B00C2AXDAU|4.0|I haven't had this for long enough yet, but so far this seems like a worthy successor to Smoke Ring For My Halo. Long songs, generally quieter riffs, excellent lyrics. Highly recommended.
B000F8O35U|5.0|This movie holds up, even 10-plus years later. My girls love watching Ariel and the Sea Witch over and over.
B002UXRH10|5.0|Because this cd was all my friend ask for for her birthday I had to order it because it was no longer available in stores. Rough words in it for me but she's thrilled!
1400049628|5.0|Remember, as I tell my sister, accept no substitutes, Max Brooks is THE Z scholar and original.  I gave this book to my brother and have to replace my copy, for my own reference.  The knowledge of history, geography, and weapons is so impressive, and adds to the bust-out-loud laughing; part of the brilliance I find is that this guide is so useful, when the Z apocalypse does descend!  I am reading WWZ, highly recommended to me, and I am struck by the brilliance and cleverness of this parody; I see it as a parody on so many levels.  Lovin Max Brooks.
B00BHUB11Y|5.0|One of the most creative films I've ever seen. The concept is brilliant and I laughed throughout the whole movie. It's even suitable for kids as young as 6 and enjoyable for all the adults. This is a good one folks! Enjoy.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|We saw this in the theater when it came out and loved it.  It is really quite faithful to the book.  We enjoyed it just as much watching it the second time in our home theater.  Great movie.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I rather enjoyed the pace of the novel.  I didn't think the initial comments made about marriage were foreshadowing.  I found the story very intriguing.  I am thrilled at the idea that Gideon and Eva's story is still being told.  I will be buying the next novel as well. It was very enlightening to discover some things about the two of them and yet it's intriguing to know there is more character development to come.
B005LAJ17M|1.0|The picture quality is pretty bad, actually real bad. Most of the video is almost black, I thought it was my TV (Sony LCD) going bad, but just really poor DVD quality

B00957T6X6|5.0|I am watching the series, and it has me just captured.  I decided to read the set of books and there is more information in the books that is so valuable to know.  Highly recommend
B00908DDZM|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums of the year. Amazon's shipping was fast (as always), and it's great to have access to an electronic copy through Amazon Cloud Player.
0385341008|3.0|This book is very unique in how it tells the story through mostly letters written just after WW2.  I enjoyed the characters and even though the plot was a little predictable, it was fun.  However, it seemed to me that the author is angry with God.  Just my observation.  Still, a great read!
B00BW0QC8G|4.0|[[VIDEOID:60ba5e9d9aaad95c53f523b0b910f9a5]] For the last three years I've been using [[ASIN:B0037TRWTI Targus A7 Backpack Designed to Protect 16-Inch Widescreen Laptops TSB167US (Black)]], which has been a GREAT backpack (you can easily find my video review on the product page). I use the Targus when traveling and it's been perfect.<br /><br />So three years later I get this backpack:<br />* As you can see in the video there are plenty of pockets<br />* Thought to supporting tablets and headphones was good planning on this design<br />* When I compare the padding, the Targus is far superior in both shoulder straps and the area around the laptop.<br />* In my video I missed another small pocket just below the main handle at the top. Big enough for loose change.<br /><br />Overall this is a good backpack, but when I first reviewed this, it cost 90-frick'n-dollars. The price has since fallen by 50% to something more expected for this type of product. Plus a star.<br />Yes, the padding on the shoulder blade area and lumbar area keeps the laptop away from your body and can allow airflow between your back and pack. Sill for the price was hoping for something for more padding on the bottom or other &#34;impact&#34; areas.<br /><br />Bssed on great reviews & price, some other alternatives you might want to check into:<br />[[ASIN:B004YIFKRM Targus Drifter II Backpack for 16-Inch Laptop TSB238US (Black/Gray)]]<br />[[ASIN:B008HY60AA Samsonite Luggage Xenon 2 Backpack]]

Most of the other editions have German audio with English and French dubbing plus a selection of subtitles (but not German).  The 2002 Columbia Tristar DVD has Spanish dubbing instead of French dubbing.  The 2011 UK edition has additional Finnish and Hindi subtitles.    The 2011 UK \\"2-disc Director's Cut\\" and the 2011 USA \\"2-disc Collector's Set\\" seem to be the same with one disc having the 149 minutes version and the other the 207/209 minutes version.  Both versions, apparently, are based on the theatrically re-released version of 1997.  Somewhere there is supposed to be three hours of special features.    The run times are as stated by Amazon or printed on the DVD or Blu-ray cases.    I bought the 2011 USA \\"2-disc Collector's Set\\" from Amazon for just $12.73.  This Regions A, B and C Blu-ray has German audio - but no German subtitles - plus English and French dubbing plus subtitles in Arabic, Danish, Dutch, English, English SDH, Finnish, French, Hindi, Norwegian and Swedish.  Disc 1 has the `Director's Cut & Commentary', Disc 2 the `Original Theatrical Version & Special Features'.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|There are many different characters to buy and choose from. It's a simple yet addicting game for all ages. All in all its a pretty good game.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I love games like this one, I only wish that there were a little bit more instruction.  It can be confusing for some when there is no instruction.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|A whole lot of fun. Some skill required!  It is fast moving.  I have not caught on to all of the tricks yet but I'm learning.

B00CRS88IO|4.0|\\". . .My name is Fleming. Ian Fleming. . .\\"<br /><br />Damian Stephenson does a good job of bringing James Bond back to life in the fictionalized character of his real creator, Ian Fleming. Operation Armada is a fast past thriller, worthy of the real Ian Fleming. Lovely ladies abound, (like Ann Charteris, Fleming's real life eventual life, and Denise Atelier, the fictional bad gal who loves the fictional Fleming): dastardly villains do their worst to kill the hero. Like the ladies, they are a mixed sort. Admiral Louis Jean Darlan was a real French admiral and a leading figure in the P&eacute;tain government. Although he was and remains a controversial figure, literary license has been taken in his life and death. The fictional German nemesis, Colonel Bock, lives to fight another day.<br /><br />For those who love Bond, high tech weapons, and a twisting, turning plot which leaves you wondering, like any good spy, who really are the good guys, Operation Armada is a satisfying read.
B004UID2LC|1.0|It was a descent app, but it doesn't let you search videos well. It will sign you out, make you reopen it, search again then work. It hasn't let me play videos lately and has st opp op-ed working completely.
B000BNX4MC|5.0|This movie is a classic. To not experience this movie is to live a sheltered, boring life. Matthew Broderick's talent is superb.
B009RH9FR6|4.0|This case does almost everything promised:  securely holds the Kindle Fire 7&#34; tablet, puts the Kindle Fire to sleep by closing the cover, wakes up the tablet by opening the cover, rotates to provide horizontal or vertical viewing, and is beautiful with well-stitched leather exterior.  The main reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is the horizontal stand catches do not hold very well.  The last catch (nearest the outer edge) holds, but the first two slip easily.  Not that I use the catches much anyway since the viewing angle is too steep for my taste.<br /><br />I haven't dropped the Kindle Fire in this case, so I don't know how well it holds up to falls.  The case feels solid enough to protect the Kindle during a fall, but I have no plans to test this unnecessarily.
1419707671|5.0|I was concerned we might be sick of these books by now, but my son and I have enjoyed these books as much as the first three.<br /><br />They arrived in a timely manner and were in excellent condition.
B008476HBM|5.0|Jane Austen is amazing!!!!! I love love love her writing! She is a genius when it comes to romance! Best love story ever!
B00A50PDDY|5.0|I saw twenty   one   pilots when they were one of the opening acts for a Neon Trees concert I went to last year. They were like nothing I'd ever seen. Honestly, I didn't really know what to think of them at first but afterwards my friend and I got pictures with them and they are such funny/down-to-earth guys. If you ever get a chance to see them live, DON'T MISS IT!<br /><br />I had forgotten about them but then decided to look them up randomly and listened to their album stream on YouTube. I INSTANTLY fell in love with \\"Guns for Hands\\" and couldn't get it out of my head. I'm the kind of girl who likes having a physical CD to play in my car, so I ordered the audio CD. It came in the mail and I listened to it right away. All the songs are SO amazing and SO unique. \\"Ode to Sleep\\" is almost like 3 songs in 1! And Tyler's vocal prowess (specifically his rapping) is incomparable. I didn't think I'd be a fan of rap, but t o p actually has CONTENT in their songs and I can't get enough! I love rolling the windows down and just blasting this CD!<br /><br />I agree with the other reviewer about anyone who's hesitating about this purchase. Do yourself a huge favor and buy it. You won't be disappointed. I have a ton of CDs and I can honestly say, if I absolutely had to make a list, this would be in the top 5 for SURE! :)
B00CWY76CC|4.0|My daughter and I had a good time playing this game. We can't wait for more levels to come out.
1582701709|5.0|This is without a doubt one of the best books I have ever read and has inspired me to follow the secret method of thinking and feeling within myself and about all things. I believe it not only philosophically but scientifically. Good thoughts attract good things to you and bad thoughts attract bad things to you .
B00DEG4Z1W|5.0|This app is the 2nd best game in the world , the 1st is minecraft P.C .Anyway if I could rate it 100 stars ,I would  because it's so AWESOME.
1439130833|5.0|This book goes hand in hand with the secret book. It is a small but very thick hardcover book with one years worth of daily reminders to think about to help keep you on the right path of attracting your wishes towards you. Each page is arranged by the day of the week for 365 pages.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect when they turned this masterpiece into a movie but I really loved it and was totally surprised by the powerful performance of Russell Crow and his singing ability.  A sad but touching story of a dreadful time in history.  Well done!
B007DIQC90|5.0|I had heard a few of the tracks on the radio over the past year or so and decided to take the plunge.  I was not disappointed.  The tracks go from somber to playful but what's best is listening to the lyrics over the music they're being sung with.  The popular &#34;Little Talks&#34; single sounds playful but the artists have admitted that this is actually about mental illness.  I love both the male and female lead singers on their own but the best tracks have to be the ones where they're actually singing to each other (not quite a duet, but you'll see when you hit those songs).  Overall well worth the $8.99 price tag, I look forward to hearing more from this band that one the Icelandic Battle of the Bands.
B009AMANBA|5.0|A great movie even if you aren't a history buff.  One that will deserve watching a few times to catch all the meanings and depth of the subject.  My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B004SBULWE|5.0|He gets the job done. When I have too much going at once click and it all goes away. You will love it to.
B001EC3JME|5.0|It is not very best but I haven't seen any other designs out there will be better.  I tried it with my 18650 battery tube and it seemed to work OK.  I like it for the reason that I can turn the light forward the same way as a head lamp for free hand.  I give it a 5 star.
B00BU9DXAY|5.0|Laughed so hard that I cried!  Mostly because every word is complete truth...<br />Would recommend this for dog lovers everywhere.
1781162646|5.0|I've read King for years, and enjoyed most of his work.  I had a lot of fun with Joyland, which part coming-of-age + ghost story, and really isn't something to pick up for a good scare.  Think Stand By Me, not Cujo.  If you ever spent summers on the coast, with the boardwalk running along the ocean, with its little shops, cafes and amusement parks, this will take you right back.  Sometimes King's never ending descriptions irk me, but he did this one just right. The characters, the story, the setting, I loved it all.  It's a quick read; perfect for the beach!
B00CE03UOC|5.0|It's a awesome game with all the neon colors.  I will tell all my friends to get it.  I can play it for hours.
B003Q6D2BE|5.0|Critics were mostly tepid on Red, which kept me from seeing it in the theater.  I should know not to listen to critics, by now.  I loved this flick!  It's nothing extraordinary, but I found the balance of story, humor and action to be perfect.  Great cast, fun time.  Can't remember where I read it, but someone had stated this is what s/he expected The Expendables to be, and that's a pretty good statement.  Red really is a fun ride.
B003EY7JH6|4.0|the funny thing it's full of futuristic improbabilities that have become our daily reality, now in 2013.  Plus it's a very good story, intelligent and witty.
B009QU9X44|4.0|This is a fantastic novel which presents an objective \\"from the outside\\" view of race dynamics in America.  It is a sad reflection of our society that the Nigerian protagonist, who just considered herself a Nigerian, suddenly became \\"black\\" when she lived in America.  The author has a keen eye for the slightly hypocritical university intelligentsia and all the preconceptions they have about people from Africa.  She also recreates her country with all its great qualities and human weaknesses.  A truly enjoyable read that breaks down all our assumptions and stereotypes about race and sometimes gender throughout the U.S., England and Africa.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|Not up to her usual standard. Repeated a lot of I do from old books and to much unnecessary description.
B006N0YWGY|1.0|Looked fun, repeated errors. Have to keep downloading and reinstalling. Stupid. Uninstalled. Thank goodness it was free. Don't buy. Definitely not worth it.
B007N6NGYG|4.0|An enjoyable game that I keep coming back to.  The puzzles require both strategy and timing, and often trial and error.  It has the right level of challenge, so I can solve the puzzles but it does take effort.  The graphics are simple but nice.  I particularly like the way the cows go tumbling when a train crashes nearby.<br /><br />The only complaint I have is that the game seems to be trying to talk you into buying coins.  You don't need any coins, but they have an option to use coins to make the puzzles easier.  The problem is, those buttons take up an entire corner of the screen, making it harder to plan your moves before actually starting the level .  You can skip three levels for free, but after that the skip button takes you to a page to buy coins.  That drives me crazy because my two year old, who likes to watch the trains move and crash, loves that button.  I turned off the in app purchasing, but I have to solve all of the levels before she plays with it to keep from getting that screen every thirty seconds.  I know they have to make money, but the sales pitch does annoy me.<br /><br />Overall, it's a good game that I'll keep playing.
B006N0YWGY|4.0|This was a great spin on the old Dopewars apps on the Ti 83 and other mobile devices.  Graphics were clean and fluid and its very eye candy.<br />Suggestions.  Add new locaions and maps.  Upgradeable boats with mods like extra cargo, speed, and handling.  This could truly be a exceptional game with online leaderboards.
B00CW665VI|5.0|this book was so thoroughly enjoyable that i could not put it down. i was even reading it while i was at work, supposed to be working, and i read through the whole thing in a day's time. emma chase is a verrry good authoress, and it's not often i can say that these days. i look fwd to reading more from her in the future. the best part of the book for me was how well she narrated the first person viewpoint of a guy. it made it all so fantastic, reading from the alpha male pov, and that the woman in question, kate, was credibly alluring. heck, i'm a married woman, heterosexual to extreme, and i almost wanted kate my darn self!<br />i found their dialogue witty, and convincing. i don't often read romance, but out of all that i've read period tangled is high up on the list in delivery of excitement, entertainment and all-around quality. normally i prefer the classics and fantasy, but i might, now because of this book, go exploring other genres. thanks, mrs. chase, and pls keep up the good work!
B00ABGEFWC|1.0|This game is intended to be played by little girls.  However, it is really easy to spend real money through in-app purchasing.  Today my 4 year old purchased Twinkliest Heap for $19.99.<br /><br />Gameloft is unethical scum!  Same for the Littlest Petshop brand.

B001NLKXK2|5.0|This is a book that inspired me in a way that few books have. With Alzheimer's Disease touching more and more families, the book provides a true look into the life of not only the person with the disease, but into her relationships with her husband, three children, and co-workers as well. If you read nothing else this summer, read this book. I laughed, I cried, and I understand so much better what these individuals are experiencing.

B00005OWIU|3.0|John Williams produces some of the most memorable film scores ever, but the more familiar one gets with his work, the more it starts to sound exactly the same.  That does not make the music bad by any means. It is all quite good.  This particular score release only drives me a little crazy because some tracks are out of order, or one track will contain really two sections from two radically different parts of the film.  For someone who prefers film scores completely in order, things like that are insanity-inducing.  Still, enjoyable music. ~ T
B005GIS7GK|5.0|It's hilarious. What else can be said about a comedy that would be better?<br />It moves fast, has great characters, isn't 'too' crude even for the fairly prudish and ought to offend<br />no one.<br />You can watch it twice and not be bored.<br />I'm a sci fi fan to start with, and a comedy this good with a little alien in it is just what<br />'Bones' ordered.
B000001F9E|4.0|If unfamiliar with Thin LIzzy, this is probably the album to get hold of for a first introduction. Good stuff. ~ T
B0090KZDSK|5.0|I was tired after book 2 - all the fighting and making up was getting old quickly so I was pleased there was some solid progress with Gideon and Eva's relationship. And hopefully now there will be NO MORE break up/make up scenes. There is so much going on now - Gideon's mother, Dr Lucas, Corrinne, Cary and Tatiana, I can't wait to read the next two books. (Yes I am HAPPY there will be another two books, I think I must be in a minority :))
B00006IR5S|4.0|This score is darker, and has a wider scope.  The Phoenix's track is lovely, and Lockhart's themes are absolutely fun and bumblingly hilarious.  A much more enjoyable score of the franchise. ~ T
B003L77GGK|5.0|I love Supernatural.  Amazon has the best prices on dvds normally.  I can't wait to finish the series that is out on dvds so far.  I have bought every season that I can from Amazon, and saved a bunch of money when looking at prices in stores.
B000OLGCHA|4.0|It is a different feel musically to most of the Potter scores.  Probably because it is not done by Williams.  Granted it is still massively out of order!  There are some incidental/filler music tracks that do not do well on their own, but there are also plenty of tracks that do very well by themselves.  This is a good score.  The most notable tracks are: A Journey to Hogwarts (this contains the lovely theme playing in the background of the Harry & Sirius scene in the family tree room), and Death of Sirius (very intense, full of movement and drama, excellent!).  ~ T
B000X5SPBI|5.0|I love Supernatural.  Amazon has the best prices on dvds normally.  I can't wait to finish the series that is out on dvds so far.  I have bought every season that I can from Amazon, and saved a bunch of money when looking at prices in stores.
B000V6BE6M|5.0|If you one of those movie-goers who really pays attention to the music in films, gets the mass-produced and easy-to-find music releases for it, and are then annoyed that almost all of your favorite moments are nowhere in that released score...then look for things like this release.  It has everything!  And I mean everything.  With the number of discs in this collection, you would hope it has everything.  Also, if listening to film scores with the tracks out of order (not arranged in the order the pieces occur in the film itself), then - again - recordings like this are for you.  Every piece is there, and in the correct order.  (Although there is something that seems a little bit off with the Denethor scenes' music.  Some beats seem not quite right, or possibly even extra.  Pay attentino when watching the film again in his scenes e.g. his audience with Pippin and Gandalf, and his scenes with Faramir before he sends his younger son to his doom.  Something is off there.  However, despite that...)  Worth the money to get a superior version of this epic trilogy's score.  ~ T
B001FB4W0C|5.0|I love Supernatural.  Amazon has the best prices on dvds normally.  I can't wait to finish the series that is out on dvds so far.  I have bought every season that I can from Amazon, and saved a bunch of money when looking at prices in stores.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|Buggy controls and card plays(cast a fight spell and i couldn't regenerate). Can't change in game volume. Screen times out while in game. Eats batt life. Deck building is tedious. Samsung galaxy s3.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|I love Supernatural.  Amazon has the best prices on dvds normally.  I can't wait to finish the series that is out on dvds so far.  I have bought every season that I can from Amazon, and saved a bunch of money when looking at prices in stores.
B009R659L8|5.0|MHC always gives you an ending that no one can predict; this is another one.  I wasn't able to stop reading and continued to try and write the ending myself.  My husband made me a fan of MHC; he loves and has read everything she has written.<br />We can't wait for her next novel; hurry, hurry!!!
B000R7GKQE|5.0|I love Supernatural.  Amazon has the best prices on dvds normally.  I can't wait to finish the series that is out on dvds so far.  I have bought every season that I can from Amazon, and saved a bunch of money when looking at prices in stores.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|Wow.... just got mine yesterday. Deluxe Version is only 1 CD but all the tracks are there, add recent live versions of Queen of the Reich, En Force and Prophecy. This album is really awesome, I don't notice the short length when I play it because theres so much to chew on. Redemption is probably their best song since Empire. Todd sounds awesome and sincere (as opposed to trying to sound like Tate), lots of \\"Ryche\\" guitars and Eddie and Scott never sounded better on a record.
B0053O89IS|5.0|I love this show.  I have bought all seasons from Amazon, and have saved so much money by doing so!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is addictive!  My daughter and I just sat and played this together.  A very good and fun brain teaser!
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I love Supernatural.  Amazon has the best prices on dvds normally.  I can't wait to finish the series that is out on dvds so far.  I have bought every season that I can from Amazon, and saved a bunch of money when looking at prices in stores.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a great app it keeps kids entertained while I am bussy  my little cousin never gets tired of it. Sometimes it freezes but it is still fun to play. It teaches kids of how to take care of a pet and be responsible.
B003B02PF4|4.0|John Grisham is always a delight to read and this one is no exception.<br /><br />Only, perhaps, he was a little weak on the plot, and he took us on a protracted tour of Italy and its cuisine which was not really necessary.<br />However, that will not stop me from buying the next Grisham novel to come out.
B008BM9L72|5.0|I loved the Trilogy and have read and re-read several times.<br />Hope the author will come up with Book # 4
0770437400|1.0|I regret buying this one. I am very disappointed. Makes me not want to see the movie. I usually enjoy reading the book before the movie....this is not the case with this one.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Awesome! Very addicting. My kids love it too!  Can't wait to get to the next level every time a new one starts! Have never had a problem with it!
B009NY43NY|3.0|Finally the last book of the series is out and I guess it was okay even though I did not like the ending. I guess must read if you have started the series but quite boring book.
B004UNX1LS|4.0|It doesn't let you add video's to your playlist unless you have a Facebook BAD!!! ): that's the only flaw that I don't like
B0063IH60K|4.0|great app. I love it :) fun game and haven't had any problems so far. seems to be working as expected
B00CFOGCAG|5.0|This game would have to be one of the best I have ever played so far. Hopefully, in the future there will be a sequel to this.
B000VS6QTK|5.0|Awesome dvd havnt seen all yet blew up amplifier getting repaired so cant wait to get it back so hopefully soon cheers amazon good service.
0679805273|5.0|I ordered these for my children on their last day of school so the teachers could sign them.  I will do this until they graduate and then give them the book as a graducation gift.  The books were perfect and I just love this book!  Price was the best that I could find on such short notice!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is awesome!!!.You should get this app. My daughter loves this game. In the game they give you a horse and u can get more. I think you should get this app
1400034205|5.0|Not such a typical novel - the author is a character and provides the narrative but also is a character, this story examines much about life in a simple way; along a journey of years with the author and some of his friends and acquaintances. He interacts and follows them with objectivity at times alternating with his subjectivity. Many aspects of human nature are examined and portrayed in such a simple but interesting ways: love, friendship, materialism, spiritualism, etc.<br /><br />The time period is between World Wars I and II, and settings are primarily Great Britain, France, and the U.S. It's not a story that has a templated plot; instead it is more of the observations of the author along his journey in life pertaining to this select set of friends on whom he focuses. Given the length of time covered, one gains perspective on the lives of the characters - the choices they made based on what each felt was important and seeing the consequences that naturally ensue. Often humorous and unpretentious, I felt the author provides a thought provoking as well as very entertaining journey for the reader.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Freaking awesome to play with others. I played this game for two years hasn't got old to me yet.I love it
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very fast read. Watched the movie, so had to read the book and was not disappointed. Read the book in two days.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|This was to no help to me at all it had nothing I needed and now I have a paper due 11 o o'clock Sharpe tommrow and I am no we're closer down then I was as when I stared
B000VAPZM2|5.0|This is one of the favorites of my granddaughter.  I love the educational story line.  The music is fabulous and the movie holds your attention.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|This book deserves 5 stars it helped with every little thing I needed other then another I looked it soooo very pleased with this
B001NE80P4|5.0|This is a great movie for everyone.  The story line is educational and keeps your attention.  The music is fabulous.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really makes you think! Wish there were more levels! Did all in a day but hadn't enjoyed a free app this much in a long time!
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|The story in the 3rd book was fine but instead of having an actual ending it just stops. It was like the author got tired of writing and just stopped mid thought. I was pretty disappointed.
0425263924|5.0|I love sequels and Silvia Day did a good job with the Crossfire saga. I can't wait for the next one.
B00BUADSMQ|5.0|So many people really crapped all over this movie and didn't like it, whatever, personally that just says that you are not a true Bruce Willis fan because this movie freaking ruled!!!!  It was just as awesome and great as the rest of the Die Hard films, John McClaine is such a freaking badass!!!!  Loved this flick from start to finish, A Good Day To Die Hard is an action packed, kick ass movie!!!!!
B00BC5FN2C|5.0|After hearing about the way people were inhaling episodes of House of Cards, and not being a Netflix member, I decided to buy the series, but honestly didn't expect to get hooked, but I did in the first 10 minutes. This has echoes of The West Wing, but is cynical without being so snarky that it is too dark and tasteless. Really enjoyable.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I have purchased all of the FliPix games and look forward to more. Bring them ON!!! I replay them time and again.
1416955070|4.0|Clary and Simon are best friends.  They go to the latest club and coffee houses.  At one club Clary sees something that no one else can see.  She sees people known as Shadowhunters killing demons.  No one else sees the two mystical beings.  One of the Shadowhunters, Jace, finds himself attracted to Clary and wonders how she can see him and his family. Suddenly Clary's mom goes missing. Then Clary and Simon get caught up in the Shadowhunter's life.<br /><br /> Usually when I read books with a triangle romances my vote goes to the first love interest,  But this time I landed on the side of the of bad boy.  Of course the end of the book ruined that for me and suppose Clary as well.  Grrr....<br /><br /> A lot of the story is pretty typical for a Fantasy YA read.  Young girl in lead, her best friend is in love with her and she does not know, she sees things others can not, a new love interest introduced ..etc I could go on.  That said it is still a fun read and I am glad I read it before the movie.  I can tell from movie trailer there is already some differences.  Frankly I believe the book will probably be better.<br /><br /> I really did like (almost love) the story and even though some of was expected I feel I am emotionally invested in the series.  I will be continuing to read the rest of the series.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I'm super addicted to this game. I love this so much :) anybody that plays this game will love it as much as I do
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|This is a fun movie, with engaging chararacters & an enjoyable plot. The graphics are clever, and the acting is winsome.  If you are familiar with the classic &#34;Wizard of Oz&#34; film, you will get a kick out of the ways in which this one both references and foreshadows many of its iconic elements.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Very slow beginning, exciting middle, disappointing end. Needed more closure. Possibly a sequel in the work s?  Three star s.
B00992CF6W|4.0|minecraft is a great game, but my friends have it on their ipods and there was a new update and now when I play I cant join their worlds because there hasn't been an update for the kindle fire yet. PLEASE PLEASE UPDATE SOOOOOOOON!
B00992CF6W|3.0|You don't have flint and steel so you can't use that in creative.theirs no LAVA in survival.theirs no portals or grass or enchantment tables
034580404X|5.0|The trilogy was as interesting and as fascinating as all of my friends who have read it said.  And, just like them I could not put the novels down.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love this game. I love seeing all the dragons and connecting with friends and family over it. Very fun game.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|The story is great I couldn't put it down and you are left wanting more. With that being said the book ends in the middle of a day, with the promise of a trip to see Eva's dad with Cary. We have been told it was a trilogy so the ending sucked to me, but I read yesterday it is being made a saga, so i am happy again and can't wait till its released.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun game for any age or gender. Love th&eacute; realistic look of this game. Me and my son both enjoy playing it.
B0044DE906|4.0|It was way too dramatic. Yet It was interesting and relevant to many age groups. It was funny as well.
B00992CF6W|5.0|thank noch for creating this game I can't get my eyes of it!  I told a lot of my friends to download it and they love it!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a really good game especially for being free it's better than most games that you have to pay for
B006DJ2JSI|4.0|Not abridged but good enough for my purposes.  Could use some upgrading but for the price (free), no complaints.  Worth it.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Well written, by a professional with a different perspective.  Not quite finished but like what he saw and related it to the brain. I would recommend it as a good read for anyone.
B00006JJ2Y|4.0|Lou Reed was never cooler than in the mid to late seventies. His ongoing chatter during and in between songs betrays that he's probably under the influence of something. Nevertheless, great song selection on here and great performances. Leave Me Alone is one of the main songs to benefit from the 'live' treatment. Great versions here of Berlin, Sweet Jane, and I Wanna Be Black, Reed's controversial song about stereotypes. If u ask me, this live joint by Lou blows away anything on London Calling, Nevermind The Bollocks, or those braggarts of \\"New Wave\\" street cred, The Talking Heads and Blondie. Lou was/is the \\"godfather of punk\\" all others, well, pretenders to his throne.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|this game is so fun. I also think its just funny. I just got it but so far it is awesome.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Fun game. It kept me entertained for many hours  if you're stuck the hints are very helpful.  I would recommend this game.
B006N0YWGY|5.0|I can play it every day for the rest of my life it is a geart game I love it
1455526959|3.0|I'm a long time fan of Michael Connelly and his Harry Bosch novels. I'm also one who buys the hardback because one, I like them, and too, I like to have them of authors that I follow. The Drop is a good book, just not great and it wasn't the usual page-turner I expected to fall into my summer days lap that I was hoping for. I had to push myself through it.<br /><br />Harry is fighting the powers to be, which is expected; he's a tire-kicker, which I like; and his assignment this time around involves the cold case files which opens up Pandora's box. Yes, he solves it; yes there are a few twists and turns and of course, the usual corruption and dirty politics; and I'm certainly glad, as all his fans are, that he gets the bad guy. It's fun to see his smart and sassy daughter Maddie growing up and Harry getting a little romance back into his life--he does like the women that are important to him after all. Yet, Harry feels tired to me--maybe the next venture will get me cheering again.<br /><br />Judith Briles, author of Author YOU- Creating and Building Your Author and Book Platforms<br />[[ASIN:188533141X Author YOU-Creating and Building the Author and Book Platforms]]
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is so awoke I am always playing it. I let my friend play it he played it all day then he started to die then he bated it.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Thanks Charlaine for such a wonderful series and such great characters!  It would be great to have further adventures to read, but they'll always live on in our minds and hearts.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game was great! There were some Times where I had to call in a friend . Haha, But it's very tricky, But it was really fun!
B005KAH7QU|5.0|If you like action and fights. This is for you. This little girl is a one man army. I love the way she gets the bad guy  back. Yet, I feel sorry for her because she is raised not to be a little girl and she wants to be.  watch it!!
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I enjoyed Beautiful Creatures so much, I downloaded the rest of the series.  Beautiful Darkness kept my attention from beginning to end. The cast of characters grew and I was impressed with the changes.  I can't wait to read the rest of them!  Be yourself and accept yourself for who you are.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|I never thought I would say it, but it better than the Lord of the Rings Series. And I still watch that now. I will be buying this soon. Watch it!!!
B00BGIBVP8|4.0|Not for the kiddies, but I was surprised how good this film was. YES, it's slow in places, but when it's good it's great. The lines are sad and funny, and that is the sign of a great writer. The acting is superb and Mann is fascinating to watch. Aptow likes to shock with uncomfortable humor and sometimes it works, but this was not all it could have been. Still worth a watch for the clever writing and great acting.
B00B3L3RPA|4.0|I read this book a long time ago and I'm planning to read it again.  What can I say I need for more words.
B002C949AE|5.0|Totally loved this book. It is very brave of Waris Dirie to have come out to write and be a spokesperson against FGM. I am enlightened about Somali culture.
B001BANK32|5.0|Another great book by Stephen King. One of the best I've read by him so far. It definitely kept me at the edge of my seat throughout. Great book, definitely worth reading.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I'm pretty sure this book can be read over and over and still be excitingly awesome and worth your time.
1616551151|5.0|Can't go wrong with this if you're a fan of the Dragon Age universe. Tons of great information on everything from lore, to politics, to character backgrounds. It does will in elaborating on backgrounds in regards to some key historical figures and locations and does a great job in putting some things in perspective with one another.<br /><br />Not so much an art book as an encyclopedia, though there are some choice pieces of concept art that are rather impressive.
B00BN3DPQ4|5.0|I loved this down to earth action movie, no one liners. Arnold in about all his movies was the badest kid on the block or the nicest take your pick but in Last Stand he is one of us maybe a little smarter. He plays a small town sheriff that just wants to live and let live. The biggest thing to ever happen there that makes the news is maybe a dog gets hit by a car but not hurt. As you can guess bad guys come into his little town and the action starts from there. Keep it up Arnold what a come back.
B008KOTNVA|3.0|I noticed recently that my MacbookPro 15 w/retina had some screws working themselves loose so I figured it would be best to buy the correct tool so I could tighten them back down. Well, after searching the internet to find the right type of tool, I hopped on Amazon looking for which one to buy. I was originally going to just buy a single driver just for this purpose but the prices were kind of high for just one tool that I would use so very little.  I ended up reading the reviews for this, and recognizing the \\"iFixit\\" brand I went ahead with the order.<br /><br />The item came quickly and the packaging was nice. The driver itself felt pretty decent for one of these \\"jack of all trades\\" kind of packages so I was initially very satisfied. I went ahead and pulled out the correct pentalobe bit for my Macbook and began tightening the screws. The first few tightened up just fine and the bit fit in very snugly. After I got to the 4th one, I started noticing that the bit began to get a bit rounded and I began to worry.  By the time I got to the last screw, the driver bit was almost completely rounded and at this point I can't even unscrew any of the screws anymore because when you apply any amount of torque, the bit just spins freely in the screw.<br /><br />Needless to say, it is extremely frustrating when you buy one of these multi-bit kits and the one tool you bought it for fails. I will be returning this and looking to pick up a more pricey dedicated pentalobe driver which will hopefully last longer.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|Great app. Great way to get into the game. Two somewhat minor problems though. First is that damage does not lower the toughness of creatures. The way they handle damage here is fine for a majority of cases, but it can get confusing when an indestructible creature is shown with 0 toughness and it doesn't die while actually lowering toughness to 0 with something like mutilate will kill even an indestructible creature. Next is a smaller concern. I clicked that I have played a lot of magic, but the alerts for every keyword still pop up. That's pretty annoying. Neither of these should discourage anyone from buying the app, but be aware of the damage thing if you are new and plan to go play in paper at some point.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|get ready to reach for your tissues folks.  Richard Gere was the perfect actor for this part.  If you're an animal lover as we are, you will rave about this film.  We did
161655164X|5.0|This book is amazing from cover to cover.  It has all the characters concept art, and it really tries to show you the many different ideas that could have been the final outcome.  The book is hardcover, and feels sturdy, and the pages remind me of a good yearbook, glossy and thick.  The art itself is phenomenal to say in the least.  Great concepts, great ideas, and vivid colors make this book a must buy for anyone interested in the visual & art side of the game.  Great insights into the illustration aspect of the gaming world.  If you are interested in art development or visuals, this book will show you or at least give you a glimpse of what it is like to work in an illustration environment.  Once again I recommend this book to any fan of good art.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|If you've been following James you'd find this book to be saying many of the things he has said before via his blogs/twitter etc., but it still is a very nice collectible to offer all of that wisdom packed in a book which you can go to again and again.<br /><br />The style of writing doesn't put down a lot of judgement on what you should do and what you shouldn't (although the only thing it wants you to do is to 'Choose Yourself') but it rather gives you patterns and some kind of analysis, examples, old stories and you're then comprehending the concept on your own. This is the best thing about the book.<br /><br />The language is very simple and you don't need to be a native English speaker to make sense out of it (My first language is no English, in fact its my third language to be precise). The style doesn't bore you, and the witty storytelling like writing keeps you with itself for as long as you want.<br /><br />It also helps you see some past/history via James' eyes, see what he thinks about future, and more importantly helps you cultivate that kind of vision which can analyse the past and assess the future.<br /><br />I still have some chapters left to go through, but so far the experience has been good enough that I'd recommend it to other people who are trying to see above the level of he crowd and are searching for the meaning of this life
B007FKI9G0|3.0|It's not a gripping life altering film by any stretch, but it is an amusing concept that deserves merit for for creativity. If youv'e got some, it's worth the time.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I found it easy to use. It is has a nice big number display that can be useful for people with vision loss. It 's a great App.
159463176X|1.0|OMG... I'm soooo disappointed in this book:( I read kite runner (good) and A Thousand Splendid Suns (excellent!), but And The Mountains Echoed was simply terrible!  The first 50 pages were great and then the story went all over without interest and the characters we not consistent... and the reader doesn't get back to the original family story until, basically, the end.  When the original story continued it was such a disappointment... Really... I can hardly believe it was edited.  The ending sucked and the author didn't tie any key elements together.<br />I'm so shocked people have given this book such a positive rating.  I read every word hoping this story would tie together in a lovely way (like A Thousand Splendid Suns)but it got worse and worse.  Seriously, I can't believe it got published... it was terrible.  Such a major disappointment.  Shame on you Mr Hosseini for starting with a rich story and adding a bunch of nonsense... then ending with junk!
B007LB5MF4|5.0|Well written.  Like the way you are kept on track with the happenings with all the characters.  Love the storyline and the characters are wonderful.  BUY THIS BOOK!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's one of the best games I have ever played. Me and my sister love it to bits. If I gave marks out of ten it would be 10 out of 10. I think people should make more games like it because a lot of games are boring!
B0090SI42Y|5.0|It is an excellent modern example of the genre.  Beautiful visuals.  Lol funny.  Good acting being out done by the great outrageous fight scenes.
B007LGPSX0|5.0|These first seasons of 90210 were the best! Watching these takes me back to high school and they are just so much fun to watch. All the episodes in season 1 are great and I would highly recommend.
B000F8O35U|5.0|A classic i get to  share with my 2 year old..not a scratch insight,  just as described.Thank you very much.
0694013013|5.0|Absolutely one of my two-year-old's favorite books. He must have played along with the book in the daycare, since he knew how to imitate the movements when I read the book to him the first time at home. He is apparently crazy about the book, and the times when we read-or danced to, more precisely-it together were always the most enjoyable. Simply classic and would recommend to all the parents out there looking for memorable moments with their children.
B0001I561E|5.0|Another classic, i get to share with my 2 year old. delivery was fast, not a scratch on it, it was as described. Thank you very much.
B008OM0EDO|2.0|He was so much better in his other movies I thought he would be better. I know it's just a comedy but the plot was so horrible it took away from the funny parts.
B0013FSL0C|5.0|This is an interesting premise for a show and, although it sounded as if it might be tedious...you know listening to other people's problems, it is not at all and has an interesting storyline as we see the therapist's interaction with his family and in his own therapy too and there are twists and turns.
B0015DWJX2|4.0|I was disappointed when it ended and I realized I would never read the book about Elizabeth. I really enjoyed the book and the subtle way it dealt with a difficult subject.
B001H9MYPW|5.0|John Mahoney is in one of the sessions as a overly stressed businessman with insomnia and his performance is superb. Alison Pill ) does an excellent job as does Hope Davis. Most poignant is the character, Oliver, although as he is a young actor I do not know his name.
B005VPRETE|3.0|Great lego product for my nine year old daughter, but once she put it together it is just sitting around.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Best Game Ever! I love it!!! ive wanted a horse forever &amp; now ive got one without needing tto spend actual money!
B00BGIC4I6|1.0|The movie was good from what I was able to watch.The movie showing was intolerable as it kept stopping to buffer and load. Even after letting it sit for 30 minutes, we couldn't watch the movie straight through without interruptions. I don't think i will be watching anymore instant movies or shows on Amazon.
B0079R8KXG|5.0|Had another case for my kindle but this case I just bought is what I was looking for. Protects my kindle and it is easy to use.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|As much as I hate waiting to see what happens next, the ending of this book was uneventful.  I hope the next one gives more depth.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really enjoy this game! It definitely gets your brain going! It is ten times better than that 100 floors game!
B00COGY2P2|2.0|A: Watching another Tom Cruise movie and expecting it to be good.<br /><br />Obviously whomever reviewed this movie and put &#34;Thrilling&#34; on the cover did not watch the movie.
B00BRH2MN8|5.0|Every song on this EP is great. I would recommend this to anyone because it's highly addicting.  I can't wait for her to come out with more material!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Amazing book, much better than the first one. I couldn't stop reading it. Highly recommended, don't watch the movie until you read the books.
B00C061I3K|5.0|dazzling album, steeped in soul and brimming with an uncommon musicality, all rhythmic urgency and compelling melodies and anthemic choruses.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|Best season yet.  The last couple have been hurting a little.  This one appears to have fresh writing, fresh ideas.  Definitely worth the watch.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game!!!it's one of my favorite and most addictive games I have...I play this game pretty much everyday and never get tired of it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really really like this game. its really fun and super addicting. its really hard though. other than that its fun.
B006JRY2QG|5.0|I had seen the last 3 seasons and it was nice to be able to see the first two.  Now that I have seen the first two seasons, the plot twists and story lines make more sense.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is the bomb! But this is probably best for people who love horse. Rember this game is the bomb!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Awesome. Loved playing this. Went a little quick though. Wish it would have lasted a little longer. Please create some more, pretty please.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Keeps you entertained and wanting to come back and play more. There are enough activities to make the game interesting. Each activity also serves an important role in caring for the horse instead of the frivolous games you might play in similar animal care games.
B004LROMX4|3.0|Isn't this series awfully similar to The Walking Dead (or vice versa)--just substituting aliens for zombies (or vice versa)? huuummm?
1250012570|5.0|My Thoughts:<br />Eleanor & Park completely surprised me with how enjoyable it was for this self proclaimed non-contemporary reader. The story was gripping and endearing in all its awkward glory of youth and two teens that didn't fit the mold but fit each other perfectly. This book took me through so many emotions; sometimes I was smiling and feeling butterflies in my belly. At other times I wanted to throttle Eleanor's mother for her lack of spine. The pacing was perfectly slow but not in the least bit boring.<br /><br />This book touched on disturbing topics such as parental abuse and neglect.  Subject matter that mirrors our reality and situations people are actively suffering from tend to make me sad and I stay away. Somehow, even though this book heavily addressed abuse I was able to handle it and enjoy reading. The glimmers of hope and pure love pulled me through.<br /><br />I can't give my thoughts on the story without addressing the characters since Eleanor & Park was essentially a study of these two individuals. Rowell created such vivid and unique characters they actually ceased to be characters and became people to me. I don't think I can listen to a Smith's song without thinking about Eleanor or Park. Rowell's smooth and seamless writing style gave me such insight into these two and even the secondary characters I really felt like I was eavesdropping on their lives.<br /><br />Final Thoughts:<br /> I'm not sure I'd classify myself as a fan of contemporary fiction, but I will always have a place in my heart for Eleanor & Park. I'm pretty confident I'll be reading another Rainbow Rowell book at some point.
B00005N6KG|1.0|I have used these for years and yes I have to replace them every 6 months or so but that wasn't a problem when they were less and $10 a pair.  At $27 it's a major problem - I'll be looking for another brand
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|This atmospheric movie looked the way I imagined Jane Eyre.  Jane was plain but attractive just as described in the book.  The English manor and moors captured the atmosphere of the book.  Jane and Mr. Rochester had a kind of intellectual chemistry.  The school scenes when Jane was a young girl were terrifying.  All in all, it captured the spirit of the book without being overacted or inauthentic.  It was a total pleasure to watch. The actress who played Jane was brilliant.
B00AMBH70S|2.0|Quit while you're ahead! I own the first three movies and am so glad I did not purchase this one...
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game not only because I love horses but this game allows me to feed them train them and clean them u name your horses and love them
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a fantastic game, suitable for the whole family. Once you've captured the basics which will take you two minutes I promise you you'll be playing this til the cows come home. Must have for all gamers plenty of depth will keep you entertained for ages.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Great book about a real American hero. The legend of Chris Kyle will live on forever. Finished it in a day
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Great game and very addictive. I play on facebook and on my kindle. Very hard to get the last jewel for the crown though!
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|Cheryl really shows her brave and foolish ways in this book. I understand how the PCT can catch the imagination of someone who feels trapped. She gives you the false sense that you would also be able to do what she did
0307341550|5.0|I picked up Sharp Objects, knowing nothing about it except it was written by Gillian Flynn, author of Gone Girl which I absolutely loved in all of its twisty goodness. Camille is a Chicago journalist sent by her editor to her tiny 2,000 resident hometown in Missouri to cover a 13 year old girl's murder. Her reluctance to return is understandable once her cold and unloving mother, 13 year old \\"mean girl\\" half-sister, and other colorful characters of this small town are introduced in wonderful, entirely unflattering detail.<br /><br />We discover details of the murder plus the disappearance of another 13 year old girl as Camille does, and the story quickly plunges into the same warped, uncomfortable, and violent territory those familiar with Gone Girl will recognize. Camille investigates these horrific crimes while battling her own, equally shocking, internal darkness. Her own questionable actions, and the secrets she unravels are all cringe-worthy, but one just can't help but continue on to the next chapter!<br /><br />Sharp Objects is a dark, twisted, and shocking thriller/mystery that will stick with you long after the Epilogue.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|I didn't read the books so didn't care what the character looked like. that matters to many people who read them. Mystery with good action.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|I will watch this againand again,.. it get better each time. its not just another superheroi show,.. well above average and multiple stroy lines
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I saw the movie based on the book and loved it so much I wanted to read the book.  Goodwin is such a good writer.  She brings the characters to life and makes even boring subjects fascinating.  I cannot wait to finish the book so that I can read some more of her writing.
0399162097|4.0|My favorite thing about this book was in the writing, all the brilliant asides and perceptive observations.  I loved her descriptions of the subtext behind people's actions, especially among family, her observations about memory and reality.  The reason I don't give it 5 stars is I thought the ending was a little of a let down.  Not that it was bad story-wise, but the writing lost some of its brilliance toward the end of the book and seemed to go from being an exceptional classic to a more run-of-the-mill drama.  Overall I'm very glad to have read it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Per my son:<br />I love Minecraft. It's the best. You have to get it. Trust me. Just do creative mode. That is the fun one. I created am incredible pizza. Get it.
B005Y1SVKQ|1.0|I choose this to help me in my Architectural work.  I can't even figuar out how to use it because it has no instructions.  It was a waste of money.  I think someone just put it up for sale to make some quick cash.  If you are looking for something then look else where.  Unless they update it and make it so you know how to operated it, I would say stay away from it or run away from it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Absolute LOVE this series:  everything about it is Off the Hook!:  characters, acting, romance, scenery, history...have watched 3 seasons in 2 weeks.  Thank you, Amazon!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Lots of fun and very addictive! I started and haven't stopped playing. Love find and seek games and puzzle games. This is both in one.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Can't wait for more!<br />Definitely worth the time and money for the game. I will be looking forward for more rooms and games.
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|I've reviewed Final Fantasy for Kindle Fire ( see http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QUR4B8IVJF8S/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm). Symphony of Eternity addresses almost all of those concerns.<br /><br />The story has strong (ish) characterization. The PCs have their own motivations, they interact with each other, and grow and develop as actual characters. Some of the supporting characters are fairly one-dimensional, but it's acceptable, given the expectations for this sort of 8-bit style game.<br /><br />New Game +: It doesn't call it that, but it's there. Unfortunately, my kindle died right after I beat the game, so I haven't had a chance to try it out. It definitely exists, though, and there are extra dungeons accessible only from the New Game +. I played the main story for about 30 hours before beating it, so with the New Game +, you're definitely getting your money's worth.<br /><br />Instruction manual: included and accessible from Pause menu.<br /><br />My biggest complaint was the ease with which I beat the game. I don't think I ever got a Game Over screen, even with some of the tougher bosses. I can't remember if this game had multiple difficulty levels--if it does, I played through on Normal.<br /><br />Secondary, and smaller complaint: At certain points in the game, you'll get new playable characters. You can equip them before you fight with them, but you don't get the equipment back after they leave the party. If I had known that, I would have equipped them with different accessories. They do return later, and you get all your stuff back, but by then you may not even need those armors/accessories anymore.<br /><br />All in all: This is what RPGs should be. For less than $5, you have to buy this.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I chose 5 stars because of the number of new and different Solitaire games it includes.  I have played Solitaire all my life, but have found new and exciting games on my Kindle Fire.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|GOT THIS GAME just today and my sweetie played it for hours. She absolutely loved it and so do I.
B00AWJYJVA|3.0|Good at the beginning. In the middle inttermiteently the story becomes disconnected and again comes back to the mainstream.  Hence the reader is confused. Script and style of writing is more suitable for a movie script rather than a novel
0307887448|5.0|If you spent the '80's firmly esconced in the nerd culture - whether through arcade games, surfing the BBS's on a Vic-64, playing Dungeons and Dragons, or perfecting your Monty Python accent - then this book is for you.<br /><br />Did you read the Hitchhiker's Guide before the movie came out?  Can you write Elvish?  Have you ever picked your dragonrider name?  Will a flesh wound stop you?  Can you make the Fiery Phoenix or discuss the problems Gamera had with Megalodon?  Did you ever pay a quarter to play Pong?  Did the giant bunny in Akira kind of creep you out?  Do you know what comes after Cherries and Strawberries?  Did 8-bit graphics make you nostalgic *before* Minecraft went mainstream?  Did you post a eulogy to Devo's drummer?  Have you spent hours online dissecting the horrible timeline blunders made by any DC or Marvel comic big-screen reboot?<br /><br />Yeah, you know who you are.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Overall, I love it.  At times it's frustrating to lose your money by accidentally pressing a button.  The updates are nice - it mixes things up again.
0394804406|5.0|My niece says her daughter continually wants her to read this book over and over.  She is a Pices baby and maybe that explains it.  Beautiful simple illustrations and nice story add to the appeal.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|And the story continues.  Another great enstallment to romance that you must follow.  More secretes revealed and created.  For now.
B0055OK2T0|5.0|This is a good movie, good acting and plot line. This was my second time seeing it and was still kept my attention.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is amazing. I love how the world tours such as going to paris ,japan, new york,and others. Daily challenges are fun as well. Subway surfers is awesome! You also get to buy New peope from the tours you go on. Also hover boards.are pretty nice. I like the colorful spray paint jetpack tht u can cando tricks with . Subway surfers is a fun game.
B00CATSONE|1.0|It was very boring, not at all interesting.  Said the same thing over and over.  Nothing else to say about the book
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I first got the free app to listen to at night because it sounded relaxing. After about a week, I noticed that this version was the free app of the day! I said what the heck, and I downloaded it. It is better than I expected. I thought it would only have a couple more sounds than the original, but boy was I wrong! I would recommend this app to anybody who needs some &quot;relax time.&quot;
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It is interesting and challenging.  The game is wonderful. Hint: not all combinations are numbers but maybe colors.  buy it!
B007V2UGPE|3.0|I ended up paying for things that didn't get and know they owe me $4 but besides that its pretty<br /><br />-
B000GCFG7E|4.0|I love reading the Jack Teacher series and this book was no different than the rest.  I have enjoyed reading all the Lee Child's books so far.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I love this game its very fun and i recommend this game to people who like the original cut the rope but want something a little more challenging.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a.good game but it copies temple run I think the owners of it should t sued definitely
1451648537|4.0|I waited until the dust had died down to read Walter Issacson's bio of Steve Jobs.  I know Issacson does a great job of telling the story of complex people. He does a great job here in a more modern setting.  Issacson doesn't attempt to delve too deeply into the history of the PC or try to tell the story of Silicon Valley.  Instead he focuses on the story of a complex man and the leading role he took in making one of the premier brands of all time.<br /><br />This work tells us that Steve Jobs was an uncompromising individual who had no desire to hide his feelings. He was a brutal and sometimes effective leader.  This book does not hide the negative attributes of Job's personality. All-in-all this is a well written intelligent book and I highly recommend it.  I do think it crosses the line at several points into psycho babble which is why I don't give it 5 stars. But it is still a great book.
0425263916|5.0|As a book reviewer I receive many books from authors and publishers to read.  I always enjoy discovering novels that I would not have normally known about as it has definitely broadened my literary world.  I have been lucky enough to discover many great authors and novels and I enjoy sharing them with you.  With this said, while reading the novels that are sent to me only a few have found themselves a revered spot on my bookcase, which is for my very favorite books.  On my 'special' shelf are three books in the Crossfire Series by Sylvia Day: Bared to You, Reflected in You, and Entwined in You.<br /><br />I first read Bared to You in May of 2012 and was literally blown away.  I was pretty obsessed with the Fifty Shades books and was on the hunt for anything that would compare.  I didn't realize when I picked up Bared to You that I was about to find a series that would put Fifty Shades to shame.  I quickly read Day's novel revolving around the dangerously sexy Gideon Cross and his equally damaged love interest Eva and couldn't get enough (my 2012 review of Bared to You can be found at [...]<br /><br />I have had a countdown to the release of each new book in the Crossfire Series.  Entwined with You, the third book in Day's series, came out on June 4th and I have literally been counting the days since I finished Reflected in You in October.  I don't quite know what it is about Gideon and Eva that grabs me and won't let me go, but Sylvia Day's Crossfire novels have 'it.'  And yes, for those wondering I am already anxious to read what is next for Gideon and Eva in the fourth book, Captivated by You, which does not yet have a release date.  If you have never read Day's novels please be warned that they are intended for MATURE audiences due to the graphic sexual scenes and adult language.<br /><br />In Entwined with You, Eva and Gideon have found themselves back together but must keep their relationship quiet until everything that happened in Reflected in You is straightened out.  Don't worry though, Eva and Gideon find many ways to be together and together they are.  However, the duo still has their fair share of problems as Brett, Eva's Rock Star ex, and Corinne, Gideon's obsessed ex, remain in the picture.  Also adding to the controversy is a reporter/spurned one night stand of Gideon's that is determined to make him pay for humiliating her.<br /><br />If you have not yet read Sylvia Day's books and you like hot romances, you MUST get your hands on Bared to You, Reflected in You, and Entwined with You.  I would be willing to bet that the Crossfire novels find a special place on your favorite bookshelf as they have mine!  Don't waste another minute!<br /><br />**The publisher has provided me a complimentary copy of the book, Entwined in You, for the purpose of review.**
B00BN0BZVY|5.0|I'm probably one of the few, but I never saw the movie based on this book (although I admittedly saw the trailers that plastered the airwaves). This book was therefore something of a surprise, and wonderfully so! Sad, funny, poignant, touching, this captivating story never failed to ring true, no matter how \\"off\\" Pat's hold on reality sometimes seemed. I even have more of an appreciation for the mindset of a true football fan LOL. As someone who admittedly does like silver linings as well, I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes to read fiction, period. As for myself, the movie version has now rocketed to the top of my \\"to-be-watched\\" list.
0142000655|5.0|this book is just amazing! i had to reed it for school over the summer, but i finished it in 2 weeks....i don't even enjoy reading on my own.i love everything about it. the plot is awesome.
160774273X|5.0|I love this book!  I have read several bread books and tried several recipes, but this one hits the mark dead center for me.  Making Ken's bread is like working a science project - weigh the ingredients, test the temp of the water and the dough as well as the temp of your kitchen and spot on for your oven.  When all those things are in alignment, your bread is outstanding!!  It was one of the very best loaves of bread I have ever made.  I won't go back to any other recipe.  I will use Ken's!
B001MSMUH0|5.0|Just like his TED speeches Sir Kenneth Robinson has expressed what is essential for human happiness. I recommend this book to everybody.
B000002ORU|4.0|Yes, I have one or two of those hit collections and I play them in the car, as well as the one long disc of Live at Leeds...without the Tommy part.<br /><br />You could make your own playlists on the iPods of course. But this will do nicely. I play the first three discs routinely in the car. Hits and some oddities in the mix. The fourth one I leave at home, but if that is your favorite Who era, it's fine too. It has Mama's Got A Squeeze Box of course.<br /><br />All discs have their own case, good idea in this case.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This is great fun and for an app is quite deep, good fun for all ages<br />Suffers from the need to buy to progress but if you're patient the rewards are there
B005LAIHPE|5.0|Excellent character building which is something a lot of action movies neglect today in favor of computer generated action sequences on screen.  If you don't care about the characters then you will not like the movie.  This is a great ride all the way through with characters that are well done and believable.  I highly recommend it for a rainy day with popcorn and the kids.
1781162646|2.0|\\"Two stars for a book by King? What's going on?\\"<br /><br />Well, since you asked, I'll tell you.<br /><br />Joyland finds a college-aged youth, Devin Jones, working for a humble amusement park (the name of which is found in the book's title) in 1970s North Carolina. After finding a room to rent near his place of work, Devin learns that the park's haunted-house ride features an unintended guest who sometimes makes herself known--a murder victim whose killer hasn't been found. Naturally, the mystery enrobes the new guy, compelling him to solve it.<br /><br />With this character lies much of my dislike for the book. Sure, he may be relatable, but I found nothing to engender an affinity for him as a character. (Yes, he's lost a parent, but that event is mentioned maybe twice, and the occurrences don't exist near other.) Consequently, I ended up plodding through the book with Devin's first-person retrospective narration. This type of narration inherently has a noticeable flaw: characters simply become unfamiliar with the details as they look back on their lives after many years. This is a problem because characters do tend to have a sense of their hazy memories while we as readers are left in the dark about them. For instance, Devin rides the aforementioned haunted-ride, a point I'd been anticipating; unfortunately, the details thereof are too slim for my taste.<br /><br />Another issue I took with the book was Devin's future love interest, whose child has premonitions. I saw this relationship as secondary, but it ended up taking on a good bit of focus to my chagrin. As mentioned, the woman's child is a magnet to portents; this bothered me as I thought that the addition of more than one supernatural element was enough for a story such as this, causing the book to take an extra (unneeded) step in the direction of the occult.<br /><br />Don't mistake me: S. King can write a tale that's gripping and will leave his readers pondering on them once they've finished. In fact, it's his name and story-crafting skill that drew me to this one. Ultimately, Joyland just wasn't a \\"joyland\\" for me.<br /><br />Note: for anyone who's read the editorial review here on Amazon for this book that mentions the possibility of this book garnering YA readers, know that this book, in typical King fashion, is loaded with obscenities in its writing.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|A romance gone curly! Who to like and who to be horrified by? It twists and turns like a twisty-turny thing.
B00BN2AQL2|5.0|I didn't know there's music genre called electro swing- ever! But I watched a short fan movie and the bg was Bambous by Caravan palace.<br />I quite liked the song and bought both of the cds which became one of my best cds for now!<br />Tring to find other good electro swing songs though Caravan palace is still on the top :p
B000BJ7BCK|3.0|Honestly, this is a pretty bad movie. It's rather quirky and it has its memorable moments, don't get me wrong... but you've probably seen this one before. My girl has a deep love for it, since it features superpowers, but even she acknowledges that it is pretty unoriginal and, at times, painful to watch. An accurate, if somewhat obscure description of this movie would be that it's a cross between the Disney Channel Original \\"Up Up And Away\\" and the YouTube series \\"Video Game High School\\". Combine those stories, maintain that level of cheese, cliche, and predictability and this is the product.
B00846REIS|5.0|I am happy with the quicker delivery than expected.  I have read shades of grey and like this better than that particular series.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Started confusing but quite an interesting and thoughtful prophecy thats possible to actually occur in some form .good Sci/Fy trip.
B002M5E2DW|2.0|I have several friends who absolutely swear by this book. I tried to read it based on their recommendations. I found nothing new, re-tooled scripture, positive thinking mush. Then, in what I can only assume was an attempt to legitimize the whole thing, very early in the book (page 21) was a list of some of the world's great minds espousing parallel principles. The list? Carnegie, Emerson, Shakespeare, Bacon, KRISHNA, and Buddha. Really?? A Hindu deity uses your method? Sorry... I can't take anything else said here seriously!
B00571F26Y|4.0|This book was very interesting, even if the topic was an inconvenient truth for me. I am convinced by his arguments, though I'm not sure I'll be rushing to eliminate all wheat from my diet right away! It definitely influenced me to rethink my diet and make adjustments, though. I read the Kindle version, and the downside is that flipping through the recipes is much harder. Something to think about if you're a Kindle user.
B00005GA13|5.0|STUNNING! This SACD is one of the finest I have heard. The mix is perfect. The dynamics are good. An excellent engineered piece of art. Good luckfinding the SACD version, buy it. I payed 28 dollars, i would pay twice as much, after listening to it. I love it in every sense. More, more, more!
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|Since the up date the treasure chest stink. They just rip you off now so you have to buy things all the time. Very disappointing. I would have given this a 5star but now a 2
B004HWYTP4|5.0|It's silly, full of action, something everyone in the family (older of course) enjoyed. Would recommend to everyone! That is all
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game ever invited! I love the people you have created they are so cool and awesome.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B009UX2YAC Subway Surfers (Kindle Tablet Edition)]]
1591843162|4.0|Instead of dog-eat-dog, kill-or-be-killed career advice, Seth Godin takes a human approach.  When you see your gifts as something to be shared and seek out where you can be useful, success can't be far away.  Will this really work?  Seth gives examples.<br /><br />Tired of the corporate ladder with all the back stabbing?  Try becoming a Linchpin instead.
B004K4AVAG|5.0|I'm a new fan of Lady Gaga.  I love to listen to this album when driving or exercising.  Very happy with purchase
B00756GRUE|5.0|I really wanted an automatic chronograph, but any auto chrono has an ETA 7750, and those are getting really pricey.  Most are over 1000.00 bucks.  I did find an UHR for 750.00 USD, but I just could not pull the trigger on this.  Hence, I defaulted to this reasonably priced solar quartz chrono from Seiko.<br />Yes, 200m water resistance.  Nice brushed/polished case and bracelet.  Diving bezel in a variety of color combinations.<br /><br />For the money, this is the bomb.  Highly recommend it.  I wear this more than my auto divers.  Thats how much I like it.<br /><br />Lume is not as good as my Sumo, but it still readable early in the morning before sunrise.
B00454U1NS|5.0|This is a fun, upbeat CD.  I use it for driving and exercising to keep me awake and motivated.  I'm very happy with my purchase.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Heart of Obsidian is a terrific addition to the Psy-Changling series.  It's caused me to look back through the preceding books to see some of the references to Kaleb Krychek to pick up some of the details I'd missed.  I look forward to these books all year!
B006XBSAP2|5.0|This is my first Katy Perry CD.  I like to listen to the upbeat songs when driving or exercising.  I'm very happy with purchase.  Bought along with some Lady Gaga and Kelly Clarkson CDs and loved them all.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|So excited that there is more to come. Excellent reads. I don't think I want it to ever end. Loved!
B005SV9X22|5.0|I don't usually buy concert CDs like this.  I've only watched Justin Timberlake's, which was great.  This one was great too.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I got this for myself, but my 4yo loves it! Of course he need assistance when it comes to the number codes, but he loves to look for the items. I have gotten stumped a few times. Good thinking game.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|You can't go wrong with this one!  I'm very happy with my purchase!  I already have one of her albums, but she just keeps cranking out the hits.

B009JZWO3I|4.0|The Good Wife is a combination Law and Order, The West Wing, and any number of family dramas. It has a lot of good female roles including the lead, likable supporting characters like  Dianne Lockheart and the female investigator (tho her storyline goes a bit off the deep end in later seasons). Overall, a good show to watch while you're passing time on the treadmill.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this show... It's addicting.  It's too bad that the actors seem to think that they can make more money elsewhere ... Watch and see what happens.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|Really fun game i would recommend this to people who like battle field heroes and games like that. For being a free game it is really good and very fun.
1476734941|5.0|This is an easy to follow eating plan.  It allows one to live their life as normally as possible with only two diet days per week.  The Fast Diet book explains the science behind this kind of eating and why it is so beneficial.  It is great for anyone who still eats out with their families, celebrates a birthday, celebrates holidays, or just wants to live their life without thinking of all of the forbidden foods on a daily basis.  The weight loss is slow and steady but easy to do once you get through the first or second, low calorie, fasting day.
B004E547D8|5.0|This movie is hilarious and action packed. And it's on Blu-Ray. Can't ask for much more, and that's why it is one of my favorites!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Such a different and captivating writing style that makes it hard to put the book down..the plot and the details written in such an suspenseful mode.  Really good reading.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I like the game. I could lose sleep playing this game...even forget to eat, bathe, brush my teeth, or go out and play.
B0091QSNEE|5.0|My kids love this game!  They love making food.  This occupies them for quite some time and my 2 and 1/2 year old loves it.  It is easy enough for him yet entertaining enough for my 9 year old for a while.  Very worth the money.  Cute graphics and very realistic.
B00BWYX2MG|5.0|Followed instructions and it works as described. Used two coats and a hair dryer. My gloves are black so any staining was a non issue. Great product, a simple solution to a small but vexing problem.

B00CNEVHMG|1.0|First of all Audio Fidelity used to always use the original master tapes, now they don't and the sound quality has suffered because of this. They think they can get other sources and remaster it into something spectacular but nothing is better then using the original master tapes.<br /><br />Mobile Fidelity always uses the master tapes and you can clearly hear the superior sound quality.<br /><br />So when you buy a gold disc from Audio Fidelity don't becuase it looks like gold that the sound will sound like gold
B006N0YWGY|4.0|Reminds new of the character based Dope Wars that came out 15+ years ago.  This has a nice twist on that game,  and is fun to play!
0525952926|4.0|The books characters are developed well as they live their lives in the 20th century, each in his or hers own generation.  The family ties are fluid from book one as they navigate the turmoil of 20th century history.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|The perfect game for a little girl to play. You can put your own personality in each  princess created. It also teaches little girls how to cater to themselves.
0525951652|4.0|As a person who has lived his first 60 years in the 20th century I was fascinated by the historic perspective of the story line especially the first half of the 20th century.  In many ways the politics of those early days of the 20th could be over laid in 21st century.  In many ways the characters and their struggles could mirror my family's experiences, based on stories I heard my grand parents, uncles & aunts tell.

B000JMKQX0|4.0|What a unique way to look at a disaster - from the point of view of those who survived it. This book has very little to do with zombies and everything to do with the living and their ability (or lack there of) to maintain their humanity in the face of epic disaster.

0670026557|5.0|I read 30 to 40 non-fiction business books each year (and write 1 or 2) and this is hands down the best book I have read in 2013.  Incredibly well-researched, exceptional storytelling, and oozing with actionable advice on every page.  It starts and ends with the surprising result that Givers are both at the top of the success stack AND at the bottom.  If you are a Giver, this book shows you how to be \\"otherish\\" so that you can rise to the top.

B008220DGE|4.0|While this is not P.T. Anderson's best film (I still say that is Magnolia), \\"The Master\\" is a solid effort with unique characters and an intriguing plot.  I remained very enthralled by the story line throughout the movie and thought the subject matter was handled exceptionally. An interesting take on the trauma of war and the post-war consequences, \\"The Master\\" demonstrates how some find solace in faith, but can at the same time perhaps go too far in doing so.<br /><br />The only downside is that I am reviewing the DVD version of this film which does not expose the full resolution of the 65mm format this film was shot on.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Love this game. The levels are amazing and there are plenty of them. I also love the shuffle option when you run out of matches.
B00CXL6XP0|4.0|This album is a huge step forward from the Tater years.  I like what they did, and really on have 3 constructive comments about the whole thing.  One, too short- I will give them a pass on this one.  It's a group that is trying to find it's voice so maybe they were a little thin on material.  Next time I expect 50 minutes.  Two, there are some strange tonal changes (mood & harmonics)that seem out of place.  The tracks are moody and heavy and then the tone in the chorus shifts into to happy and inspirational.  It seems out of place within the rest of the track.  I can't really give a better explanation than that, but if you listen to it, you will hear it.  Lastly, whether you love or hate the Tater, you have to admit that his story telling as a writer/co-writer (whatever) was cohesive and cogent.  -You may not have like what he wrote, but it was bound together logically.  The lyrics on this album are more about imagery and symbolism than social commentary and cohesive storytelling.  Mind you, I'm not looking for Mindcrime, I just saying that there is a lack of grounding in the lyrics. Still though, I am really enjoying this album.  I think that LaTorre is a class act, and I expect a second great chapter from the band.
B0001CNRBG|5.0|this is about two people who have an affair for one week a year for about 20 years. It is a wonderful movie that shows the passage of time, and how people grow. Wish I had something like this is my life.

0399246665|5.0|My grandson loves this. It is so versatile and kid friendly. The thick double pages are perfect for little hands. Tons of learning opportunities and Eric Carle is ALWAYS  wonderful!
B007IWG3WC|5.0|I love to watch this movie when I'm in the mood for something that's not to challenging.  Watching these smart sharks chase their human creators is gory but intriguing.  And Samuel L. Jackson as the mysterious benefactor of the project is delightful as always. His performance is reminiscent of his turn in &#34;Snakes on a Plane&#34;.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Although the release date was bumped, I feel it was worth the wait. I also love that Day extended past a trilogy!
B004VFN7BE|5.0|I could watch this movie over and over. Sigourney Weaver is fabulous. Holly Hunter is great. The relationship between these two characters is fascinating going from grudging collaborators to a fierce team of warriors.  And Harry Connick Jr. is deliciously creepy.  Bottom line: A great movie with strong female lead characters.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|I love this game I hope a lot of other people also enjoy as much as I did this game made me feel like I was doing it in real life
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|The acting is excellent but the plot is hard to follow as it ping pongs back and forth from one time to another.  It's a movie you need to see a second time just so you can sort it out and perhaps follow it a bit easier.  It wouldn't be a great sacrifice to watch it a second time as the characters are fascinating because they are played by the same actors....crossing race and gender lines in different times and eras.  It's interesting to see if you can look through the ingenious makeup and identify what character the actor is playing for that time.  It's definately worth a shot.

0345803485|5.0|I would definitely recommend this book....I started off a little slow but then you become shocked and immediately intrigued with the main charaters.
B006N0YWGY|3.0|It's a decent little free game for the day, but there's really nothing to the game. There's absolutely no substance and no reason to replay the game after a few runs. Sure, you can buy stuff at different stores, but it's not like there's any rewards to doing so. The handling is sloppy at best and there's nothing to do other than turn back and forth. Uninstalled after less than 5 minutes of playing.

B006R4H5FG|5.0|This book came recommended from three different sources I trust.  Glad I took the recommendation and have seen better responses to the visuals and presentations.  Now when I see really bad, not report / not presentation, PowerPoint docs I reconsider the credibility of the presenter.  Simplicity in design is proven more effective, yet in the name of professionalism dull, un readable text is judged the standard.  An impactful presentation takes some thought and Presentation Zen provides some points for consideration.  Anyone who has to make a point or lead a discussion would do well to practice the concepts presented.

B00AAQHP66|4.0|Even those who do not surf will like this true story about one of surfing's legends and the discipline required to succeed at anything difficult.  The shots of the action on the water do not overwhelm the picture and there are some great ones.  If you have never been into surfing, the movie will make you appreciate it more.  Good story, good acting.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I love this series and could not wait for this book to come out. It was good and the story continued but for how many pages there were there wasn't a lot that went on. Although this was a good plot setter, I suspect the next book will be full of action and suspense!

B006OGMEUI|5.0|This album is just amazing, no matter what I cannot stop listening to it. The music goes right to my soul.
B008220D5K|3.0|Some funny parts, a few poignant scenes, overall just too long. It's a grown up version of The Berenstain Bears and Too Much Birthday. You may keep asking yourself, when will it end? Some scenes are more like an extended gag reel. The main characters are likable so at the end you find yourself thinking, \\"Well, it really wasn't that bad.\\" Who doesn't like Paul Rudd? I'd like to see Julie Hagerty should play Leslie Mann's mother in the next movie...but please hire an unbiased editor.

1781162646|5.0|With none of the exploding eyeballs or nasty aliens that have become all too common in King's later novels, JOYLAND hooks you in so that you quietly keeps you turning page after page. It's a ghost story told in a way that's both subtle and effective. Great characters, and the comfortable prose that King is king of. Loved it!

B004KBSQOW|2.0|In the world of Hawaiian music IZ is the Carrot Top, not so great vocals combined with crony Hawaiian protest songs along with sappy dibble about rainbows, this is the best of IZ and the worst of Hawaiian music. I rate this: 2 thumbs down.<br /><br />If you like the Hawaiian sound look at the &#34;The Folk Music of Hawaii - Sons of Hawaii&#34; album or The Descendants soundtrack album, there are also a number of Slack Key Guitar albums and all are well worth the price. All these albums do what Israel K tries to do, if somehow you are a Iz fan, then expand your horizons and buy a couple of the albums mentioned above, you'll be happy you did.

B00AEFYZ2K|2.0|I just took a look at Road Trip, comedy from way back in 2000. I bought it because it came with a free ticket to see The Hangover Part III and I had a passing interest in seeing it. I am now starting to regret that decision, twofold.<br /><br />The plot is fairly straightforward, with no real surprises in terms of the narrative, but the premise offers plenty of opportunities for funny scenes and characters. Road Trip, unfortunately, misses most of those opportunities. This film was clearly meant to be in the same vein as American Pie, a raunchy college comedy, but it doesn't quite reach that level, nor that of something like Animal House.<br /><br />Like I said, the plot isn't too complicated. College slacker Josh Parker (Breckin Meyer) has a girlfriend named Tiffany (Rachel Blanchard), his childhood sweetheart, but they attend different colleges, with Josh at the fictional University of Ithaca in New York State and Tiffany at the University of Austin, Texas. He has a tryst with classmate Beth (Amy Smart), which she lets him videotape. Said tape is accidentally mailed to Tiffany as part of Josh's ritual of him sending her video journals, or something like that. Now Josh and his buddies have three days to drive from New York to Texas to intercept the tape before Tiffany sees it. It's pretty straightforward, no real problems plot or narrative wise, with one glaring exception. The plot is set in a frame story, a set of flashbacks narrated by Tom Green's character, which I'll go into detail with later. This framing device is pointless. If taken out, there is no loss to the plot. In fact, he could've just as easily been narrated by Meyer's character.<br /><br />During this trip, there are a decent variety of scenes and environments given the road path that the friends take. The cinematography is decent, but nothing special. The soundtrack is typical of the late 1990s early 2000s era, mostly mellow college rock; again, nothing to write home about. The shenanigans that thecharacters get into, typical of this \\"crazy adventure\\" type story, are hit and miss, mostly miss. Thankfully though, a lot of the unfunny jokes don't last very long, and are typically scene-enders. The gross-out type comedy that is prevalent in this genre is kept to a minimum without any real loss of the comedy, or this case, lack thereof. The fan-service scenes are gratuitous, of course, but that's the point in this genre; they serve their purpose. The dialogue between the characters is a natural and believable, given the characters and the situations that they find themselves in; most of it isn't pointless, but there are some hiccups.<br /><br />The acting and the characters are really were this film drops the ball. It's hard to remember, but these actors seem a little bit too old for college kids, even for back then, but for suspension-of-disbelief's sake, I'm willing to forgive that. First of all, not everything is bad. Amy Smart is nice and likable, the girl-next-door type. She does okay, with a good and believable mix of strength and vulnerability. DJ Qualls as Kyle is squirrelly and vulnerable, but not wholly feeble. His friends do take advantage of him, but it all does seem to be in good fun, and he takes it in stride well enough. He is the \\"pathetic loser\\" type typical of teen films, not unlike Cameron from Ferris Bueller's Day Off (played by Alan Ruck), right down to the overly strict father. Unlike Cameron, Kyle does eventually confront his father directly, rather than it being implied, and although this particular plotline's resolution is not terrible, it's not particularly satisfying either. Breckin Meyer is barely passable. He almost delves into blandness, but not quite enough to destroy the performance, but he does straddle that line a little too closely for my taste. Paulo Costanzo as Rubin is boring, emotionless, and uninteresting; if he obviously doesn't care about what's going on around him, why should we? He's the stoner/slacker stereotype, andhe doesn't diverge from that trope at all, and much of the plot can take place without him without any real loss. Sean William Scott plays . . . somebody. I forget the actual character name, but let's face it, he's just playing Stifler from the American Pie films again. Seriously, the character is no different, essentially a copy-and-paste with no discernible changes whatsoever. But I suppose that is the point, as Sean William Scott was typecast for that character type. If you found Stiffler funny, you'll find Stifler 2.0 funny in this film too. Anthony Rapp's character of Jacob is a stock psycho/stalker type; he's clichéd and lame, and only serves to poorly fill the \\"bully\\" stereotype, but he doesn't really look the part. There are some funny cameos, however. Horatio Sanz, from Saturday Night Live fame, has one of the few really funny parts in this film. It's of the gross-out variety, but not too bad and hilarious nonetheless. Jimmy Kimmel also has a cameo that's pretty funny; see if you can catch it. There's also a brief appearance by John Ross Bowie, whom you probably know as Barry Kripke of The Big Bang Theory fame. Of course, Andy Dick is an unfortunate blemish on an otherwise good cameo list. But all of this, good and bad, is nothing compared to the true horror of this film, the un-equally terrible Tom Green.<br /><br />Tom Green is abysmal in this film; by far, he is the worst thing about it. He is annoying and unfunny. For the life of me, I cannot remember or understand why we as a nation ever found him funny, and frankly, I'm ashamed of it. Like I said before, he's the narrator for the frame story, but I already went over how pointless that was. In fact every scene he's in is pointless and goes nowhere. Not one bit of it is funny, just annoying and obnoxious. Everything about this character is painful. His name is Barry Manilow, something that I believe that the real Barry Manilow regrets immensely. Tom Green's scenes are painful in every sense of the wordto watch. The only good one is where the snake tries to eat him, and man, do I wish it did, but then again, Tom Green is nearly impossible to stomach.<br /><br />The ending, which I won't give away here, is kind of anti-climactic, in the sense that it just sort of happens without any real tension or build-up. I will give the film credit for this though: the way the situation resolves is unconventional and unexpected, and even grown-up in its own way. The standard epilogue for this type of film, that being the \\"what happened to them afterward\\" footnotes are uninteresting for all the characters, and don't do any of them any real justice, what little there was to be done.<br /><br />The DVD extras are standard, mostly trailers. The trailer itself is mostly more Tom Green, so it's just annoying. He also hosts the making-of documentary, so that's also worthless. The deleted scenes were left out for reason, as they are even less funny than what made it into the film, and many of them are just mean-spirited. Skipping the DVD extras will most likely do you more good than otherwise.<br /><br />Overall, this film is boring, forgettable, and only slightly funny in some rare parts. That being said, it's not outright terrible, but it comes darn close, almost too close for comfort. There could've been some genuine comedy here, but the opportunity is mostly missed out on. Unless you're really a fan of just this genre of raunchy college comedy films, you're better off passing on it.
B002ZG981E|5.0|one of the best movies in the past years<br />blu ray is the way to watch this kind of movies
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I love this game, because the game kinda gives interesting facts about the fish, and the underwater life.<br />I also love the fish swimming around, very smooth animation! Great job Disney, on this wonderful, educational app!
B002T9H2ME|5.0|in some parts, reminds me about 2001 a space odyssey: the pace, the long silences, the robot, the lingering... but hey you are at the moon. first time i watched it was late at night, big mistake.<br /><br />personal experience aside, great movie if you feel drawn into space.
B001EBWING|4.0|A very well done older film. A classic for sure. I highly recommend to any and all who like film noir, older movies, and fans of films that leave you wanting more. A really great watch.
B000Y7U98W|5.0|watched it by accident, and lingered in my mind until i had to buy it<br />danny boyle is one of the best directors nowdays and still i feel that's an understatement
B00CL0J99K|1.0|Iron Man 3 was terrible It topped Spiderman 3 in killing the franchise,what a let down and how the heck did those suits fly around with no one in them? stark duct tape???? it wasn't Iron Man 3 either it was Tony Stark \\"The Movie\\" 1 I'd really like to time how long he was actually in a suit? maybe 10 minutes out of the 2+ hours.<br /><br />Bring on The Avengers 2 and get us a REAL Director for IM4
0880793589|4.0|The cards are cool. They work as a trainer for your creative mind development or for a actual problem solving process.<br />I think they will work best if you read Von Oech's book first.
0345803485|2.0|I don't usually read stuff like this, but my friend read the trilogy and told me its a must read.  The books sat in my house for about a year.  I ran out of real books to read, so I thought; \\"why not\\".  That turned into WHY?.<br />I was shocked when I saw all the reviews on here, because I thought I was going to be the only one who felt that way!!<br />I actually started skipping over the sex scenes, because they were so unbelievable and stupid it actually got annoying to read them.  The whole series is so far fetched you really have to suspend all sense of reality while reading.<br />I did however feel compelled to soldier on and finish just because I wanted to prove my guesses were right!! And big shock they were.  I predicted the outcome of this book so well I could be on the psychic friends network.<br /><br />If you want to numb your brain and not have to perform any intelligent thought, then this series is perfect!!!!!
0307476073|2.0|I tried very hard to like this book, but once Cheryl received her new boots, I couldn't bear to read another word about her tortured feet or her blundering through experience after experience, including the flashbacks.<br /><br />Cheryl Strayed is an admirable woman who gained her sanity and some real-world insight into her late mother and worked through her grief by plunging into hiking the Pacific Crest Trail. I did enjoy \\"meeting\\" those men and women she encountered on the trail. These incredibly kind strangers are probably the only reason Cheryl isn't dead. And her encounter with the bow hunters was chilling...but for once she \\"got it\\" and probably saved her own life.<br /><br />But there's just so much angst a reader should have to bear...and Cheryl's never-ending commentary on her lack of money, raw and blistered feet, over-weight pack and her incredibly naïve approach to her PCT trek finally drove me to close the book on my Kindle and seek a good summer read elsewhere.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game, definitely keeps your mind going! even my kids like it, we fight over who's turn it is Pol
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|This game is addicting. Easy to learn how to play. Love how easy to play this game. Good for any age.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have English and Spanish versions of the Bible available anywhere! It's user friendly and convenient. It has a section where you can keep notes of your thoughts as you read. I also enjoy the audio feature! If I can listen to the bible if I don't want to read.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Well written! This story pulls you in quickly and you feel the emotions of each character from beginning to end.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|This book was awesome. It really showed how domestic violence can drive you to completely change everything about you to escape. It was very romantic  and and sweet and I loved the unexpected ending. Love all of Nicholas sparks books!!!!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Love the story line. I gave 5 stars because the book kept me intrigued & entertained. Can't wait for book #4.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|It was great but thought it would be the end if their story but ended so weird that I hope I understand where the new book will start. Hope it is soon!
B00BNWWUDY|5.0|4.5 stars<br /><br />I knew nothing of this ahead of time, and the first half made it seem like a very well-made look at what a bunch of pill-popping zombies we are turning into. Lots of sweet (really more sour) little shots at the evil pharma companies and their total disregard for everything but money. But then things go sideways and suddenly get even more interesting.<br /><br />Jude carries this film easily, though Mara is also very good. Law is slowly becoming a more and more skilled actor, full of nuance and understated moments that say a lot while showing little. And may I just compliment him on not wearing a wig or getting fake hair? He looks more like the love child of Phil Collins and Sting every film, and hats off to him for keeping the hats and wigs off and aging like a real person, not a Hollyweird joker-faced freak like so many of those phonies are becoming. His sense of honesty informs his role here and as he shifts into gear as it rolls along you really start loving what he's doing and connecting with his nrain.<br /><br />Add to that a solid script from Burns and very nicely measured direction and editing and composition from Soderberg and you've got a relatively quiet movie that says a bunch while never having to scream its messages, as some of SS's earlier films do. He says he's retiring, but he'll be baaaack. He's too good at this game, and too willing to tell truths our society needs to face up to, to not resume his mastery of the cinematic arts.<br /><br />The blu-ray is a good transfer, and though the extras are barely ten minutes, the three minute making of is a very sarcastic send-up of how good stars have it on set. The fake ads for Ablexa are also all too accurate, especially the interactive quiz where every yes answer leads to Law telling you how this lovely drug will solve all your issues. While as usual the side effects roll by in small print. Oh, you know, nausea and dizziness and suicide, just the normal things.<br /><br />In decades to come, if we get smart enough to start trusting nature over big-money-run science again, Side Effects will be seen as a very wry and chilling look at how easily we have let ourselves be turned into zombies by people whose only interest is profit. Oh, and social control, of course. That's where the really big money is.<br /><br />Perhaps Soderberg will come back with a film that mentions how most of the school shootings have been done by kids on anti-depressants. Not that there's any connection with doping up children every day for years and them becoming insane, mind you. We couldn't say that without any lawsuits now, could we? Let's just say that it's a potential side effect.<br /><br />I think this movie had to be turned into a thriller to get made by a studio, but what Soderberg really wants to say is, WAKE UP! We're all uncomfortably numb these days, and the pills ain't helping most of us. They're only making it worse.<br />But, you know, side effects...to come, if we get smart enough to start trusting nature over big-money-run science again, Side Effects will be seen as a very wry and chilling look at how easily we have let ourselves be turned into zombies by people whose only interest is profit.

B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This game is really good and a great way to pass time. I play it all the time and I recommend it for younger boys who can't find an interesting game. Get this game while it's still free!!!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I was hanging on to every page didn't want it too end, great writing and excellent story I'm going to read more of his
B002PMV9K6|5.0|As I have stated before in some of my earlier reviews, its obvious that you cannot take a book that has more pages and words than bees have hives and make a movie. You can however, take a book and make a movie that stays true to form and does its best to keep up with the pace of the original novel. In that category we have: Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince.<br /><br />The acting in this movie was great. I feel that Alan Rickman, Michael Gambon, and even Tom Felton  (though he is a bit of a cry baby at times in this one) shine in this movie especially.<br /><br />Harry Potter is growing up rapidly as he is now 16 and set to start another year at Hogwarts. Dumbledore meets Harry outside of the wizarding world and then asks a favor of Harry. From there, we meet a new professor, Horace Slughorn. Not long after these series of events while Harry is on his way to Hogwarts with Ron and Hermione, suspicions arise after seeing Draco and Narcissa talking to what appears to be Death Eaters. And that is only the beginning of the mystery.<br /><br />Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince deals with issues such as: love, loyalty, and sacrifice. The tone of the movie overall can be described as engagingly humorous, eagerly romantic, but as serious as the book is; some even argue that this is one of the darker stories in the series, I can be inclined to agree tremendously. It is an enjoyable 153 minute movie.<br /><br />Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince's final score:<br /><br />5 stars
B001HNE3NO|4.0|Really sad really real really couldn't put it down really glad when it was over such a well written story
B00CWY76CC|1.0|This sounded like fun, downloaded for my Kindle Fire but it wouldn't let me actually get any of the items needed.  Sad.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|The puzzles were not overly difficult.  I look forward to additional levels.  Of all of the escape games, this was the best.
B00DAXYNEI|5.0|Great Acting and plot. These characters are so smooth that you never see the danger coming. I hope life doesn't imitate art when it comes to &#34;House of Cards&#34;
B00785P2QC|4.0|I think this is a really fun.  but it takes a while for u to be able to build different things.
193700788X|5.0|Review by Cassandra from Book Talk<br /><br />Sookie Stackhouse's life is about to turn upside down once again. This time it's even more complicated and dangerous than ever. Sookie turns down a request from former barmaid Arlene when she wants to get her job back at Merlotte's. It's understandable since Arlene tried to have Sookie murdered. Sookie's relationship with Eric is on the outs and this time it might be forever. Eric and his vampires are keeping their distance from Sookie and keeping her out of the loop when it comes to vampire affairs. When Sookie learns why, she is heartbroken. When a murder is discovered, Sookie is arrested for the crime. The evidence against Sookie is weak, so she is able to make bail. With a team of great friends behind her, Sookie investigates the murder and learns many lies are hiding in Bon Temps. With many enemies out to get her and evil plans being made, Sookie's run of luck may finally be out. Justice will be made with blood and love sometimes just isn't enough.<br /><br />This book is amazing. It's bittersweet to me for the fact that it is the last book in this series. After all the trouble Sookie has endured in the previous books, this one holds the most trouble and danger. It also holds plenty of heartbreak for many characters. While Sookie has killed in the past, this time she is arrested for a murder she had nothing to do with. She is being framed while more attempts on her life are coming at her from different directions. There are more than one enemy after her this time and they are determined to see her punished and dead for perceived insults to themselves. Sookie's relationship with Eric is an emotional affair that leaves you wishing things could be different. I was just happy that the person she ends up with is the one I was rooting for her to be with. It's a wonderful book full of emotion, danger, and major plot twists. This is a series that is not to be missed. Warning: adult content and violence.
B0090KZDSK|2.0|I enjoyed the previous two Crossfire books and was really looking forward to what I thought was the end of the series.  After reading this repetitive and at times boring book I am at a loss as to how Sylvia Day will spin out the story over another two books.  The pacing was extremely slow and the sub-plots of Corinne/Cary/Victor etc. were no addition. The dialogue was extremely stilted at times between Gideon and Eva plus the phrase &#34;I love you&#34; was used that many times that it became ridculous. Overall it was not worth the wait
0670026603|5.0|Me Before You<br /><br />Louisa Clark was leading a simple life in a charming town which had a castle at its centre. Louisa was quirky and fun, with a great job in an equally charming cafe called the \\"Buttered Bun\\". She had a close knit family and a nice boyfriend. Everything changed when the cafe closed and Louisa lost her job. She got a new job looking after Will Traynor , a young rich professional, who was  in an accident and is now a quadripeligic,  permanently confined to a wheelchair. He already has a nurse, Nathan, but Louisa is hired by Will's mother to have a positive effect on her son's wellbeing. She is given six months to change Will's outlook from hopeless to hopeful. The task , however, is far from easy. Will was raised in that very castle which  looms in the town centre. He has known a life of privilege and the accident has made him moody, mean and depressed. His sarcastic , biting remarks are hard for Louisa to deal with but she is determined to come up with creative ideas to make his life interesting again. But , Will has some stunning ideas of his own. This story was such an enjoyable read. It makes the reader experience a myriad of emotions and just when you think that you have it figured out, it turns on you. Beautifully written and not what I expected. A fantastic summer read!
B00D6BU8GG|2.0|Unfortunately, there were too many cliche lines and stereotypical characters. The action scenes were intense and cinematography exceptional, the script was too weak.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Very challenging and makes you think. Definitely recommend this game. Some levels take more thinking than others but the challenge is worth it.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This is a great show that keeps you riveted and waiting for the next episode! A must see for all.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is an amazing have if you don't have it you should really get it you get to travel around the world and collect point if it was actually real I would most definitely do this  in real life.
B005KTZ05G|5.0|First, I dont think this figure is a TOY for little kid so if you want one for young kid, dont buy it because it's too fragile to play with.<br />Okay, then this one is just amazing. The details are done perfectly, and the paint, even though it smells a bit, is precise and beautiful. Worth your money, 100%.<br />I personally love this one very very much. Good job. :D
B006N0YWGY|5.0|This game is so fun and entertaining!!get it!The sound effects are awesome a little tricky at first butthen youll get a hang of it
B001FB4W0W|5.0|It is great that in the time of twilight we have a show to get the bad taste of that horrible series out of our mouths we get a intelligent well acted addictive vampire show.
B00594XOZU|5.0|Hi I'm Jeanny,  Kik me my nameme is PEWDLOVER I'm 14 I talk with a range of 14-26. I love this app! It has brought me so many memories and friends!
B000094HMU|4.0|Worth seeing.  Placido Domingo is strong.  Zeffirelli production/sets are memorable.  Interesting mix of Western forms with some eastern musical influences via Puccini (his last work).
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Nintendogs but for horses<br />Really fun to play kills times and keeps you busy for a long time,enjoyed the game hut slot of things are too expensive :(
159413586X|5.0|I love these books and Mockingjay is a great end to the series. Highly recommended for an easy but exciting read.
1781162646|5.0|I found the story and premise to be very interesting,<br />the protagonist kept my interest throughout.  The<br />characters will stay with me for awhile.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game makes me feel like I have a real horse .me and my bffs enjoy this<br />Game. DOWNLOAD IT
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Very fun and even somewhat challenging at times.  Keeps you interested until the last level.  Now I am waiting for the next installment.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|Loved it so much! Can not wait for season 8 and I am sorry the show is ending. Hope they reconsider.
B005COO1X6|5.0|SK is my favorite author and this story delivers his classic and usual horror. It's a short story and I had to read it all at once.
B0060D1B2C|4.0|While the book is superior, the movie is engaging and heartwarming. Perfect for a night in jammies with your girlfriends and wine.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Good game. All around fun. Easy to play and learn. I like how you can by so many people and costumes. I could play it for ever.
B00D6B4PUG|3.0|This app is honestly just a book mark updated to look better then standard.<br /><br />Pro's:<br />- Looks Great<br />- Gets The Job Done<br /><br />Con's:<br />- Slow<br />- Fails To Load Often<br />- Only Supports A Single Account<br />- Freezes<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />Unless you really can't stand the standard KF email app and want the GMail look and feel that bad, then this app isn't for you. I wouldn't recommend this app to anyone really. It's a waist of money. If you want something like this just use the Chrome browser and book mark it there. If you want to know how to get it just respond to this review or head over to my profile and email me, and I will let you know how to get it. Save yourself some money. Thanks for reading. Hope this helped.
B0034G4ORC|5.0|i love the movie and it was a good deal since I cancelled my online movie service, very happy about this order
B006N0YWGY|2.0|Ok the graphics and sound are great but you can't slow down. You have to maneuver around tight bends and your are at 100% speed constantly.  Alow it to be slower maybe by tilting the screen or something. Other than speed the game has great thought and original idea.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|The picture quality is fantastic! You see things not previously noticeable. Highly recommended if you are a Star Wars fan it is a must have collection.
0399246665|5.0|Even with my grandson having other books on colors and shapes etc... this set is really cute. This will also Grow with him, as now he just can point to things(animals, shapes, colors, etc) but later can be challenged as the cardboard pages are split in two in a clever way, and he will have to look around and use his brain to match top pages to bottom ones. The only thing I would change is the Color Red in the fire truck is is not enough red.
B0038P59A0|4.0|Very good movie Robert and Jude make a good team. I will order from this company in the future. I am happy with order and movie.
0805047905|3.0|This is a nice book when you like Eric Carle but would be a better book if it was bigger.
B000059590|5.0|This is a film I watch over and over.  The historical setting and the original story made it completely real.  I liked the ending so much -- Adam Coooper's leap in the all-male Swan Lake -- that I bought the ballet.  Viewing the ballet after the Billy Elliot DVD made the whole story more complete.
0399229191|3.0|Bought this book of Eric Carle for my grandson(1 1/2), among others. I think I liked the original hard cover & soft pages better(that I read to my kids when they were young). The format in this Board Book is a little small for the full experience. Still nice, but I might buy the hard cover/bigger version, later.
B004G6009K|5.0|Absolutely BEAUTIFUL in 3D!<br />I love this movie, and I can't believe that it would be able to get any better, but the 3D really made it pop.
B008IEWBJ8|3.0|What a great Record , I cannot begin to describe the recording quality , how great it is . The microphone placement , the openness and the transparency of the music .<br /><br /> I doubt that anyone could have done better .<br /><br /> Plus you get a coupon inside the record package where you can go to the record label web site  and down load a free MP3  of the record . Plus amazon gives you a free MP3 delivered to your cloud .<br /><br />OH but there is one very disappointing thing about the record . There are a number pops and clicks in the physical record , that come through when playing . Most of the time it<br />seems as the music covers these up , but when the music gets quiet or in between the songs you can hear the pops . One of the reason I ordered this album as a record and not a CD was the record label.I thought I would be getting as high a quality as possible a recording I could use to demonstrate my stereo and record player . Although the recording is as GREAT as I expected , the pops are annoying . Another post makes the statement that the vinyl may have not been as good as possible . Even with this one flaw I love this album and would buy it again as a vinyl LP , because the music and quality of the recording is so outstanding .
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I am having so much fun playing this game with my friends just to see who can stay in the less.
1451695187|4.0|I liked the book, but it was a little more intense reading than another book on the same subject-&#34;Heaven is for Real&#34;.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|An &#34;ordinary&#34; girl named Lou, aged 26, who's never left her home town, is hired as a care taker/ paid companion for 35-year-old Will, who's severely disabled after an accident and has decided to end his life. It's Lou's job to keep Will entertained and prevent him from going through with his plans to end his life. They don't like each other very much at the beginning, but eventually come to really appreciate each other and fall in love. This is the basic premise of Me Before You. In the hands of a less capable writer, this could easily have turned &#34;slushy&#34;/ melodramatic, but Moyes gives the story some (unexpected) depth.<br />What made Me Before You stand out for me were the characters, particularly the main characters Lou and Will. The romance between them is both very touching and heartbreaking, and I alternately found myself laughing and crying at various points. The other thing I really liked about Me Before You was that Moyes doesn't go for &#34;easy answers&#34; and doesn't try to &#34;indoctrinate&#34; the reader.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|this game is full of great entertainment! it will definetley keep you busy for a while. hope an update is coming soon!!!!
B007CI81IQ|5.0|Well structured and researched, provocative, and possibly game-changing in the way we think about poverty and redistribution policies. It is also a recommended read for everyone that is eager to think about an old problem in a new way.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|ITS A really good game to play and I am happy to play this.. You could get a good post for this.
1594746168|4.0|*I received this book via LibraryThing giveaway*<br />Dr. Spencer Black, a controversial surgeon, is considered a prodigy until he begins studying the unconventional. Operating on those born with deformities he comes to the conclusion that creatures of mythology are actually the ancestors of humans. He spends the rest of life experimenting in unthinkable ways to prove his theory to the world.<br />My complaint would have to be that there is very little text and I feel like I am missing something. The plot is incredibly fascinating to me, which could explain why the lack of text bothers me.  Carnivals have always held my interest and I think the lifestyle has an occult like appeal to people.  It's definitely a quick read and flows very well.<br />The artwork is amazing. I do wish there would have been more to the story, but the pictures make up for that fact somewhat. It's nice to be able to see what you are reading every once in awhile. I realize this will not work for everyone but I do recommend it.  The story is dark but the artwork adds a little bit of whimsy for the imagination.
0307946711|3.0|I won't say WHAT happens at the end, only that I understand why the author did it ... but I completely disagree that it was necessary. I think the mistake here is that the author assumed his book was about one particular character, when in reality it was (or at least should have been) about the other main character. He made a serious misjudgment, and the result is a lovely book with a very damaging ending.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|I LOVE this show.  Sexy, handsome billionaire out to rid the world (or at least his city) of greedy bad guys.  What's not to like?  Reminds me of Alias.
0671449028|5.0|The pattern and cadence of the words on every page soothes little ones to sleep as you read it aloud. But be warned, it may work on tired parents as well! A great book, fun to read and re-read at bedtime.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a very good version of minecraft. It is way better than Minecraft Lite because it lets  you have more items in your inventory.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I enjoy this game because it can help with hand-eye coordination, focus and a good distraction from any of your worries and a good way to pass the time. I highly recommend Subway Surfers.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Absolutely love the game but I wish it would update at the same time as on my other devices. Do love the game and I keep coming back to it.
B008K9UZY4|3.0|This game is very good and a fun sonic game but some time it is to fast paced and you can't tell what's going on.
B00CRVZRUS|5.0|As soon as the movie began to play, I couldn't believe what I was seeing.  The visual quality and clarity are remarkable - no, astounding.  This disc transports me back to 1965 and I'm with the Fab Four in my living room.  It's as if they stopped by to play a private concert and I'm sitting in on the session.  Once the music started I got goose bumps.  I've heard every Beatles song thousands of times, but never like this - 5.1 Dolby (or DTS) surround sound with incredible depth and definition.  I didn't believe that audio like this was possible with recordings from the 1960's.  Listening to the songs I could swear that they were recorded yesterday in an all-digital studio with state-of-the-art recording equipment.<br /><br />I commend the talented technical people who made this Blu-ray possible.  There's extra footage on the disc with interviews about the restoration process and how painstakingly difficult and detailed it was.  Well done and thank you!
B00B7Y0206|2.0|Whenever I search something, it hives me random unrelated videos. Once I searched cats, and it game me tutorials on how to fix a lamp. And the videos do not even load... I do not reccomend.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I just downloaded this app, soI really haven't had a lot of time to play around with it. Seems like a good game for kids. It will be fun to dress the horse(s) and compete.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Very well written and enjoyable. It makes me want to keep following Christian and Ana through their life together  Bring on #4.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This book is so awesome and you don't realize you are at the end till you have no more pages to turn. And the ending will shock you.So glad there will be more..
B002KC8BSO|5.0|I really don't think anything needs to be said about this perfect movie. If you haven't seen it and you enjoy horror, campy comedy, or medieval times, I don't know what you're doing with your life.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Wonderful character development and story line.  Reading it I felt like I was living in that era. Highly recommend this book.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|The acting in this movie was absolutely wonderful. Im so glad to see these ladies won so many awards.  It was funny, sad and just a feel good show.
B0091WNK8M|5.0|one of the best kids movies of all time, i couls watch this movie over and over and over again, i really love it on my kindle fire HD
B001NHNG64|3.0|I have often found that series based on a single character tend to get very predictable and increasingly less believable with each book. The Jack Reacher series falls into this trap.<br /><br />The book kept me interested enough to finish it all, and the size was just about right even for someone with limited time. There were even some points where I couldn't just lay the book down.<br /><br />But we already start seeing patterns here:<br />- Unlikely coincidences in each book. Reminds me of Doctor Who, who always ends up someplace for some random reason but always is where he's needed. Except Jack Reacher often doesn't have two dollars to his name, never mind two hearts.<br />- There's always a woman (or two), usually different ones every book, but always with that &#34;Oh, Jack, you're so strong&#34; kind of attitude. It's like Jack Reacher bathes in Axe and the world works just like the Axe commercials.<br />- Lee child has this strange preference that things turn into mist, like cars with bombs turning into thin smoke, and brains with bullets turning into pink mist.<br />- Villains are always clearly &#34;bad&#34;. No room for gray in here. In this case the villain is a leader of a militia who just enjoys killing people.<br />- And the FBI, when it makes a show, always goes about the wrong way first, usually taking Jack to be the criminal at first.

B008OM0EDO|5.0|By far the best politically incorrect comedy I have watched ever. Cohen does not disappoint as in his other productions (Borat, Bruno)
B008JFUORW|1.0|Because us guys in our 20s and 30s think seeing a giraffe decapitated is hilarious, yeah that's really the type of humor guys have.<br /><br />To the makers of this movie... If you all got decapitated... That would genuinely make us laugh... A giraffe... Not so much.<br /><br />What stupid losers.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the bomb. I think a lot of people should play this game, you would have a lot of fun.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|Twists & turns, ups & downs, craziness abounding!  This movie was touching, real & moving!  It's one I will be watching again & again!
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I was so disappointed after reading this book. It abruptly ended and I feel like the story is just being strung out for monetary gain on additional books. Not a single story line was resolved in this book and I really feel like it was just used as a \\"filler\\" to get to the next book.
B0087ITBPC|5.0|The whole family enjoyed this movie!  It was funny, touching & had a happy ending--it was perfect for a weekend treat!
B009X2CRMK|5.0|So many twists and turns through 3 generations.  Absolutely riveting right to the end. Happy and sad at the same time.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|I especially enjoyed the way the book was written...from the viepoint of the servants and the &#34;adopted&#34; main character.  I thought the ending would be predictable but, it was not.  Good read.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|what a wonderful story! I had no idea the hardships women face in Kabul. Many moments of tears. What an eye opener!
1451627297|5.0|I am not the typical Stephen King reader but this book has converted me.  I am on my third Stephen King book.  This book was wonderful and I have recently purchased it for my husband so that he can experience the book.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|addictive just like aod good game<br /><br />not sure how many levels but I'm on wave 30 and its still pretty cool
B0089LOG02|4.0|Didn't know about orphan trains...a difficult solution to an impossible problem....which might have worked except<br />Humans are self-serving and forget the &#34;Golden Rule&#34;.
0425263908|3.0|I read or should I say I scanned the 50 shades trilogy and was not at all impressed. I usually don't read romance novels, but I invested in these books because of the hype. Then I heard of Sylvia Day and Bared to you, so instead of buying all the books on the market, I thought I would just buy the first one..... Bared to you... and believe it or not. I ended up buying the complete works. Beautifully written. Miss Day, I'm now a reader of romance novels and to date, I think I have read seventeen of your magical books.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|Unfortunately, the quality of the DVD was terrible-  first time ever from Amazon.<br />So I bought it elsewhere.  If youa re only mildly an Eagles fan, you will love this.  If you are a rabid Eagles fan, you cannot watch it enough.  Enjoy it!
B008476HBM|5.0|I was glad to have this for my Kindle.  I loved reading it again. Timeless principles are communicated by Jane Austen.
B003VR5PPY|5.0|I finally caved in to buying this game after much pestering from my friend. Oh boy, I missed out on such a great game until now.<br /><br />The story and narrative is very good in playing tricks and making you think about what certain actions can lead to different outcomes. The game is even more essential when the sequel, Virtue's Last Reward, is out.<br /><br />Any gamer who loves a compelling story and wants to get sucked in to the game should definitely try this out before getting VLR.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is for the most part a great game, with the cool extra stuff in the shop and the mystery prizes ln the box. The only real part that I don't like is when the game sometimes glitches at random places
1451683405|4.0|Very interesting book with implications on not simply how we perceive morality but culpability; and therefore, how our criminal justice system is ill-focused. If we are at the mercy of neural processes than it would behoove us to add information into the brain as much as possible in order to provide increased data and thus influence those processes. Whether that be from a deterrent angle, as in the looming punishment for a crime, or a satisfying angle where our understanding of some stimulus increases that very feeling of satisfaction.<br /><br />The only real consideration I saw untouched was within the realm of biological processes as that of emergent properties. In other words, is consciousness, or even decision making, somewhat immune to, or at least insulated by the possibility that it is more than the sum of its reduced parts?
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|If you loved Fifty Shades you will also want to dive into the Sylvia Day series!  An extraordinary read that will keep you coming back for more!  I can't wait to see what happens with Eva and Gideon!  Outstanding!
B0055Q5F36|5.0|i have dropped my phone countless times and its still working and looks great. case has saved my phone even after i left it in top of the car and drove until it fell off and caught my Attention. thankfully no Traffic
B0083Z614S|5.0|This is a lovely tale for any age, time well spent reading a story about ordinary magic of the seasons, good people, and all the creatures of nature. This book has been made into plays, musicals, movies and television movie series; but none hold all the magic of the original printed word.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|As good a read as Kite Runner.....interweaves the lives of a family in Afghanistan.....very we'll written, and just the right amount of suspense that kept me from wanting to put it down....didn't want it to end
B00C1S9G90|5.0|This is still the best sci-fi series that has been on the small screen. Well acted, (usually) well written episodes, and always thought provoking.<br />  My two teenagers enjoy it TOO!<br />A side note; the Amazon Prime picture quality is far better then Netflix.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Really, it's about time we finally got not only a good game but a Duels of the Planeswalkers game here on the Android. Playing it on my Kindle HD and loving it. Miss the casual variants from the last two games, but draft is really rather fun and random so been playing with that.
B000056HE9|5.0|If you aren't familiar with this movie you must add it to your holiday watch list.  Beautiful story, good acting.  A time of innnocence.
0375851569|5.0|I bought this as a gift and it's the perfect collection of Dr. Seuss!  Wonderful gift set and great value.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|Love this app. It's addicting. Easy to learn, hard to put down. Time can pass by so fast and you don't even know it.
B008BQ8VOC|2.0|Too much bad language. First season didn't have all of the cursing and swearing. This season it's all the time. What was a good show now is off my list.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|As an (older) expat Brit, I found it oh so easy to go on a journey back into my literal (and literary) childhood with Neil Gaiman. Not the &#34;Watch with Mother&#34; groomed and safe childhood of Suburbia, but the elemental countryside where Fairy rings and the &#34;Green Man&#34; have always been real, comforting and more than a little scary!<br /><br />I didn't suspend my belief like the adult me - I believed The Ocean and all the Hempstocks like the child I still am inside.<br /><br />Good story, good read for grown-up kids everywhere.
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|Awesome app for kindle fire. Has great controls for a kindle.<br /> Way better than the first version. I would recommend it to my friends.
B005OP28XS|5.0|Finally something on commercial TV to watch. Best comedy series in years, laugh out loud funny!! Every season is better than the next.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|James's book is at minimum totally accessible and at the best life-changing.  He distills many of the most important thoughts relevant to our overwhelming, noise-filled world and combines them with time-tested approaches that leverage our animal tendencies in a positive way, putting them into a personal approach to philosophy that is both practical, deep, and (I believe) very sustainable.  In a world full of snake oil self-help and multi-point howtos that make a buck but are too specific to deliver results except for the very few, Choose Yourself is a shining beacon of authenticity.<br /><br />Altucher's writing style is clear, concise, and honest, and always invites introspection.  At the same time, his approach leaves the reader enough room to identify and craft their own template for a truly personalized version of success.<br /><br />I have followed Jame's blog for some time and turn to it from time to time for strength.  His writing style is personal and authentic, and he never fails to reassure that the most successful follow a difficult path and often are just as confused and struggling as the as-yet-unsuccessful.  The book is a further distillation of these ideas, and to me represents a siren's song for when I feel lost (which is not infrequent, as I am in the process of building a tech business).  His message is that strength comes from within, and is supported by the relationships around you so you must cherish and nurture both.<br /><br />One small caveat is that internalizing James's suggestions for execution requires a keen awareness on the part of the reader that his entrepreneurial drive was forged early in his life in very intense fires.  My perception is that his grit and perseverance, as well as his ability to shine when the opportunity hits is exceedingly refined, and developing that muscle is a prerequisite to the really big wins.  Nevertheless, there is something in all of us that, if chosen and cultivated, will deliver results we can be proud of.
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|IT IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE GAMES THAT IS ON MY GAME LIST THAT IS A WORLD WAR 2 GAME.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Freaking awesomeness. It's really a good and addictive game. It make me happy happy happy Jack . I always play this game everyday when I'm bored.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love this app for both it sleek look and funtionality. Works perfectly well on my kindle fire hd and it offers some great stats on battery life depending on different user activities which otherwise I wouldn't be able to get. Certainly worth downloading - I can't believe I ve been using my device for so long without it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The best he on tv Nintendo aint got short on this buster my girlfriends husband hooked me up with her and the game real real fool
B00992CF6W|5.0|If your thinking of getting this app you should. The price may be a bit high but it is still worth it. The description is out of date, It's now (not for long) 0.7.1. The maps  are a bit small but I am sure Mojang will fix that. Yes it  also needs biomes and a lot more but It WILL eventually get everything it lacks now. I think its worth the money. Otherwise I would not have bought it.
B000AP04L0|5.0|This movie is a classic!  If you have ever worked in a office you will be able to relate to this comedy.  It's just a good film.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it the game is really nice for horse lovers. But if u don't like buying things don't bother.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Great app. I sleep like a baby with it on. Many great sounds to fall asleep to. Easy to use, and well worth it, give it a try.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I love this alarm because it worked gust how I want it to. It is an amazing app. Now I am never late for anything.

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Loved loved loved the third book. Cannot wait to read further about Gideon and Eva......please don't take too long for the next read!
B004EPYZUI|2.0|Zack Snyder's worst film too date. Disgusting script and bad acting. But I'm stil looking forward to Man of Steel.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love this app. Easy to use and only one advertisement at the start of each game.<br />I would recommend this app
B0034G4P4Y|5.0|Spielberg's best Film. Love it. Great Script, and the motion capture is beyond superb. Andy Serkis is very good as Captain Haddock.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|This book was assigned to me in college. It was amazing. We had 3 weeks to finish it and complete all the assignments. I finished it in 2 days. It was amazing experience and I would recommend it to everyone! Go ahead and buy it, you'll love it!
B002LC2DQ4|5.0|It has become impossible to find these cards in retail stores. Ordering it through Amazon was terrific. I received my order in two days and the cards work perfectly. If these cards become no longer available, at least I have these two and two others to use with my Olympus cameras.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|Comes in great packaging. Easy to read and put together. Already been dropped several times and not a scratch on it. Better than her Otter Box by far!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|i really enjoy this app. it can be challenging at times. great way to pass the time. I would definetly recommend it.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|This CD is great and the guys are not missing Geoff Tate at all!!! They sound better than ever and Todd LaTorre's voice is hitting the high notes that Tate has not hit in years. I really liked him in Crimson Glory and he is a perfect fit for the missing in action Tate. This CD is 10 times better than the boring material that Tate's version put out. I bought it, but really wish I did not waste my money. I traded it in to get this CD. Best move I have ever made. The only downside to this CD is that it's so short. I would have loved to have gotten a 60 minute CD. It's ok, still the well worth it. Thanks guys for finally releasing some good music, apparently it took getting rid of the psycho lunatic.
B00ACP3OOM|5.0|The product works great!!!!    Other products that have ear buds that go into your ears, ONLY work while you can keep the seal the ear bud makes with your ear from getting broken.  Once the ear bud seal gets broken, you will get water in your ears, and 90 plus percent of the sound is then completely lost.  For me, this broken ear bud seal happens before I get 100 yards finished, if that.  AND...even if you can manage to keep the seal in place for a little longer, while the ear bud seal is not broken, you are totally isolated from everyone else in the pool, you can't hear anything, and you cannot communicate with anyone.    I've tried many of the other products, and the ONLY ones that work for me are the products by FINIS, the NEPTUNE or their other swiMP3 models.    The NEPTUNE player easily fits on your goggles, and you don't even know it is there...no fussing, etc.  It has a pause and start button that you can easily & quickly hit during your sets to communicate with others in the pool.    I average at least 6 days a week in the pool, and the FINIS headsets are the ONLY way to go!!!!  I like working out to music, and with the FINIS headsets, I am able to do so.    Plus, if you need help or assistance, their customer service department is 100% helpful.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|Animated movies can be very entertaining and this one is no exception. Great but predictable storyline with some fun humor and likable characters.<br /><br />Not of the quality of classics like Shrek or Toy Story, but well worth an evening.
B00A8MGIZG|5.0|The ideas:<br />First - we are all connected with each other - not only in our present time,<br />but ever since the long, long ago past times and centuries, as well as in<br />coming future times.<br />Second - already during the long ago past, we created the pathways for our<br />present lives and the surroundings/circumstances we are living in, and we<br />keep creating the parameters for our future to come.<br />Third - Death is but a transition from one incarnation to the next.<br /><br />These are the basic ideas which keep unfolding through the lives of six<br />protagonists who live in different times. Different people, different ways<br />of live - but still they are connected with each other through their acts<br />and decisions, by which they keep influencing not only their very own life<br />and people in it, but also the lives of others still to come in future centuries.<br />Decisions, several people made in the 19th century, for instance, and how<br />these decisions kept influencing future lives 300 years later and even<br />further on to future individuals.<br /><br />In a time, where the last natural ressources of our planet are being<br />exploited for greed of profit; in a time, where the wealthy industrial<br />nations are making even more profit on the backs of the poor Third-<br />World-Countries' populations, up to such highly perverted stockmarket-poker<br />with shares on basic foods -<br />in such times as these, isn't it high time to ask ourselves, whether we<br />might have a responsibility in what is happening here?<br />Are we really thinking that we will get away with it when we die, and<br />leave this \\"legacy\\" that we created to our future generations to clean up?<br />What if these `future generations' will be nobody else than us - in a new<br />body though, even possibly holding a different sex or ethnic background -<br />but the problems, the circumstances, we will be facing then, we did create<br />ourselves centuries ago already - the small-scale ones as well as the<br />big-scale ones.<br /><br />Fourth idea: Change thinking. Trespass boundaries and dare act against<br />conventions - even then, when it's uncomfortable; when the majority or the<br />holders of power don't like it.<br /><br />Five stars are not remotely enough to rate this phantastic, wonderful movie.<br />What an awesome gift..!
B002QKZLZ6|3.0|Good:<br />Unit is nice leather<br />Magnetic closure holds well<br /><br />Bad:<br />It will not last more than a year with daily use.  The leather will deform/warp around the top hinge.<br />Also, there is no good reason to have the opening, I always worry the headset will come out<br /><br />This is my third unit...
B009VMN3RA|3.0|Aside from having a movie star parent, Sachi Parker just isn't that interesting nor was her book.  She complains about not getting money from her parents, then relinquishes title to a house worth millions in Japan.  Her woe is me mantra wears thin as does her sexual escapades.
B004L3AR0K|5.0|Just loved this film, after watching it 3 times I purchased a copy, its funny, well made, good actors, and a good storyline. Well worth a second viewing.
B00AYM6JFO|4.0|You can here his age in the songs but it is such a sweet album it just grows on you.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Mind boggling fun. I'm hooked! What's that? Dinner? You 're on your own!... Once you start playing &quot; The Room&quot; nothing else around you matters. It captures your attention from the get go and then you don't want to stop. It will keep you going until the end. I Love It!
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|This was such a disappointment compared to her first 2 books. Parts seemed to drag on and I found myself wanting to fast forward through the &#34;geeez, AGAIN&#34; parts. It was a little much.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|It is easy to read with lots of facts and helpful information.  Once I got the hang of how to read and compare.  Hope you are talking about my copy of the Chronology Study Bible.  Would recommend to all who would like to read the Bible as he events took place.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|Problem!!! If you go to the shop and click More Levels, it won't go away until you turn off your device. This is a perfect game, if you don't count that. But my score will stay at 4 stars until this is fixed!
B00377V6J2|5.0|Really have enjoyed. Anyone who appreciates electronic/acoustic guitar  probably would enjoy both performers.  Albert King was some one I had heard a long time ago about 10 yrs.  Heard their performances on PBS. They are both great guitar players.
1861085257|5.0|The book is in new condition.  I have found the material very relevant to my task.  The book also contains great examples and instructions.
B008JFUO0Y|4.0|If you are looking for a highly engaging story filled with characters that you will grow to love. Then go see something else.<br />If you are looking for a great Horror film, yes pay for the ticket see this movie 5 or 10 times with your friends.<br />I am not going to comment on the story. Does it matter? Kids go in the woods. They do stupid things. The evil comes for them. People die.<br />What matters is the presentation. Evil Dead manages to tell you a story you have been told hundreds of times over but still manages to hold your attention. It does this with top notch cinematography and sound design. The film starts out with bright full colors and ends in fog covered dark gray. No matter the color or camera angle Evil Dead looks great. The film stays away from CG effects and sticks with old school physical effects. Did they CG a Jeep driving through the water? Every gore shot is shown up close and personal. Get ready to see things that cannot be unseen. Blood, gore, limbs removed, beatings with blunt objects, nail gun, broken glass as well as a chainsaw and a Shot Gun or Boom stick. These things all add up to a super violent display of awesomeness. The sound design of the film is filled with wet spattering sounds, and something that is reminiscent of a possessed cat or an air raid siren all add to the gore effects and overall creepiness of the film.<br />Evil Dead is a great horror film but it is not perfect. I missed Ash a little. It should be Evil Dead Law that if a Deadite gets dirt thrown in its face this event must be followed by an Ash approved one-liner. Second a Nail Gun that works with no air compressor or battery. I know it's a movie with possessed people running around. But it could have been removed and replaced with something else that would have been more believable.<br />Throughout Evil Dead there are lots of things for fans of the older films to find, the Oldsmobile, the necklace in the shape of the skull on the ground.<br />Overall Evil Dead, though not original still remains the best horror film I've seen in a long time. So if you are you looking for tons of gore covered in a river of blood, Evil Dead can and will deliver.ugh not original still remains the best horror film I've seen in a long time.

B0050DIWFC|5.0|Easy reading.  Unpredictable story line.  Kept you guessing throughout the book. The characters were realistic. This story would make a great movie.
B0035KGWR2|5.0|If you haven't ever heard of Amy Macdonald or listened to her music, you are missing out on some absolutely fabulous classic rock. She's a big hit in Europe and the pride of Scotland, but I barely find anyone in the US who has any idea who she is. She is a big fan of Bruce Springsteen and I hear a lot of influence from him in her work. She likes to give us a driving, upbeat tempo with a strong chorus that keeps playing over and over in your head. It's happy music too. Not full of heartbreak and bad-boyfriend complaints like so much current junky American pop music. This is actually her second album of three, and came out in 2010. However, it is every bit as good as her most current release (2012), Life in a Beautiful Light. Get that too. And her first CD, This is the Life. They are great! Buy now. (Oh, for some reason, this one is NOT available on iTunes like #1 and #3. No clue why.)
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|One of the best parts about books is that you learn so much about the author. How they think, what they dream and sometimes you get fragments of their life. This book is in someways like watching a home movie of Neil's childhood. There is more of him in this book than any of his others and I hope he continues to write like this, one part magic two parts himself.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I didn't know that I would like it so much.  I'm not really a game player but I found this one to be enjoyable.

B009NY43NY|4.0|Although I agree with most of the reviews that the last couple books in the series sort of fell off a bit, I never get tired to the characters and storylines in the sookie series.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Not a bad little game. Kind of reminds me of Excitebike on the classic Intended. Worth the free download, yes.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Read it the first time many years ago.  Still great. I seriously doubt that the movie being released this Fall will come close to being as good as the book.  it will probably be just a &#34;shoot-em-up&#34; action flick.
B008ASLK8A|4.0|Well thought out and done. It wasn't &#34;The Matrix&#34; where the first installment was the only thing worth watching. I look forward to more like this.
B009OCR1X4|5.0|This is a wonderful soundtrack by the Pale 3 trio of Klimek, Heil, and Tykwer. It has enough diversity and variety to satisfy a multitude of tastes, and the main melody, which echoes throughout the movie in various forms, is absolutely stunning. It's called the Cloud Atlas march, but that doesn't begin to describe its charm. It's as if you combined the beauty and simplicity of the Shiller\\" Ode to Joy\\" theme in the 4th movement of Beethoven's 9th symphony with the dignity and stateliness of the famous Elgar precessional (often familiar as the music played at commencements and graduations). It's a melody that's as entrancing and beautiful as it is simple and I could not get it out of my head for weeks. There are at least four or five variations in the accompaniments, each as beautiful as the last, which range from driving rhythms to pulsating sonorities in the strings. But besides the march as I said there's also enough variety so that I was never bored by the music. By the way, you should read Jon Broxton's brilliant review. I believe he's a writer for a British music website and his review is much more detailed than mine. It's a review worthy of a score like this. Tykwer was also one of the three directors for the movie in addition to composing some of the score, very unusual for a director, and my hat's off to him for helping to create both a great movie and a stunning musical soundtrack.
B003OUXECE|4.0|Interesting to see the building and fall of Rapture that ends off where the game begins! Worth a read to understand more about the characters, especially McDonagh, Sander Cohen, Fontaine, and especially Andrew Ryan himself. Reading the story helped me understand the finer points of why Rapture failed and makes me enjoy the game even more when I later replayed it!
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|he expands on tried and true \\"altucher\\" topics with hilarious stories and practical advice.  if you've read his other books or not, this one is a must read.  i posted my review here:<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />plus, he'll refund your money or donate the proceeds to charity if you read it :)
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Another beautifully written story from the gorgeous Nicholas Sparks!  Strength doesn't always come from muscle, it comes from believing your determination to change is worth the fight.  Love that their is a magical sense of those that have past on are still helping us survive.
0802473164|5.0|This book is highly recommended for any couple who have been together for a length of time and have gotten comfortable with each other.  As everyone knows, when the &#34;newness&#34; wears off, sometimes relationships can go stale.  This book helps you with discovering your love language, and if your significant other reads it too, you can both know better how to &#34;love&#34; each other using the correct love language.

B00957T6X6|5.0|Simply the best fantasy writer of our time. GRR Martin is absolutely brilliant. Constantly keeps you on your toes. A must read!
B0098QBEXO|5.0|A touching film, with amazing performance by the cast, so natural, sincere, honest. As if living their own lives and sharing those incidentally with us on the screen. Cumberbatch is amazing, which is to no surprise for those watching his artistic career climb,  he makes you believe that he indeed is James, that he knows what the physical and emotional pains are and simply allows us, outsiders, watch the last days of his life unfold.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|The reason I say I don't care is because sometimes, it doesnt work very well and it says &quot; Sorry, Application &quot;Beach Buggy Blitz &quot; is not responding.&quot; It is very fun anyway, and addictive.
B003K07DUC|5.0|I LOVE MATT DAMON, the movie was perfect for a former Army Ranger. Would recommend for anyone into action packed films
B003WE9TU8|4.0|This was an interesting read. The idea of the world sort of surviving a Zombie Apocalypse??? Fantastic!!!<br /><br />The book sort of limps to an ending which stops it form being a all start, but it's pretty close to being perfect...
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Very interesting reading materia, very interesting written by a doctor, who now believes and knows there is a heaven, and there is something beyond this world..
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I have never played a game like this before now I am addicted. If you like puzzles then this is the game. I love it
B00BF2RTO2|5.0|UP THE IRONS!!!!!!!!!!!!  First Concert Ever was the Seventh Son of the Seventh Son and this video brought back all the memories except the ringing in the ears and the lost voice!!!!  Thanks
1476719071|1.0|Hopefully potential buyers will read the one-star reviews prior to buying this book.  The writing is horrendous.  The characters are mannequins.  The premise moves from illogical to predictable to downright boring.  If this author can find a publisher, there is no limit to who is capable of getting trash published and finding a space on shelves.  Seriously, my title is not an exaggeration.  I stopped halfway through the book, and the only reason I went that far was because I became addicted to the tripe.  The greatest pleasure I got from this book was throwing it in the garbage can and banging the lid shut.  Buyer beware!  Do not waste your hard-earned dollars on this travesty.
B005HJU7HA|4.0|They don't call them classics for nothing.  They are very cleverly written.  I enjoy the camaraderie of Watson and Holmes.  I add this to the list of books that I should have read in my youth, but better late than never.
B00BY8DIT2|5.0|This merging of these young very talents could not have been better done. Joe has only recently come across my radar and Beth is just a great talent and not very hard on the eyes at all. Great material performed to perfection.
B0007KIFGE|5.0|We have watched this several times and my husband will, no doubt, watch it again sometime. This one has a place in our dvd library.
B008MM9630|5.0|I love fairy farm it is amazing awesome. I love it so much.  then again it. does get boring a lot
B00008G8M4|5.0|We have enjoyed watching this movie more than once. And, we will enjoy watching it again. For us it has a 'patriotic' feel to it and we like it very much.
B005IQZB14|3.0|Wanted to love the story but just got too lost in the many tiny details and prolonged parts  of the story. It did not move along fast enough for me or offer what I expected which was a dynamic story about hiking and willpower and life in general. I found myself skimming to get to the end. Applaud her for working through it and making it to the end. Awesome accomplishment and she should def be proud of herself.
B00AEFY5TI|5.0|&#34;Grease&#34; is a favorite movie of ours and will continue to be one of all-time favorites. We have watched this several times and we will, no doubt, watch it again sometime. This one has a place in our dvd library.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I'm really enjoying watching Downton Abbey.  Only wish I could watch an episode each week.  I'm almost finished with Season 3 already.  Very engrossing.  I highly recommend it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game makes you think! I haven't gotten stumped so far but it has challenged me. Each level has different things you need to find to get out of that room and its fun figuring how it all is connected.
B0015RFCZ0|5.0|We'd heard about this movie and we loved it ourselves. We watched it with our grandchildren and they didn't budge the entire time. It's wonderful!
B0063M22QO|5.0|LOVE this game. Easy but offers challenge as well. Would recommend to all. Just got my kindle and LOVE playing the games available.
B009R659L8|4.0|I enjoyed the book. Certainly liked the twists and turns. Kept me<br />interested to the end. Love Mary Higgins Clark
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Very sad ending .  I read to relax and this book certainly did not provide a relaxing  plot.  Not very suspenseful.  Just another tragedy that we hear so much on the news<br />.
B006N0YWGY|5.0|I don't have time to write reviews but I figured I would take the time to write one for this one. this is a pretty fun game worth a download and worth the time to play. please great on s3.
081297381X|2.0|The tittle of this book is misleading. While it does discuss \\"black swans,\\" it really does not focus on the unknown. Instead, this book contains some useful observations the author has discovered. However, the majority of the book is a rant about the bell curve and how bankers are idiots (in fact, the author pretty much calls everyone who believes in the current financial system an idiot or a fool). The passages and transitions in the book are very difficult to read because the author/narrator is very dull or self-centered at times. There are also quite a few arguments in this book that are non-sequesters (do not follow the argument).<br /><br />Overall, I do not recommend reading this book for entertainment/educational purposes. It has no citations or support for the claims presented and it is not organized or easy to read. The idea that there are things that we don't know or can't predict is nothing new, most people realize this early on in life. The author/narrator is very arrogant in stating the obvious claim though.<br /><br />I do, however, recommend the book \\"Thinking Fast and Slow.\\"
B0025KVLS8|5.0|Good songs that never sem to go out of date..  Reproduction on C.D.'s sounds as good as it was when recorded.originally.
B0035JRVR8|5.0|I just got back from Rome about a month ago and it was so nice to see the city brought to life by two of the best actors of all time.
B0017QSZW6|5.0|I like History, and the Tudors is what you would think of Henry VIII and Ann Boleyn when you read about them.  Most if not all of the main characters are real in History.  Henry Cavill is just.... Wow!! Great performances, entertaining, and excellent.
B002RI9ZPY|4.0|&#34;The The Girl With The Drag...&#34;, was a better book compared to the two sequels offerings in this trilogy. This one is not quite the same.
B000GLKLCK|5.0|Since Amazon has been showing out of stock for months now, I ordered this from a vendor in Japan.  I had to wait several weeks for it to arrive, but oh it was so worth it!  I love, love, love this set of CDs!!
B00C81AVNU|5.0|The Cd captures the joy..passion and energy of the<br />show. Love It! Kudos to Cyndi!  Kudos to Harvey and the entire cast!
B008133MDK|5.0|This is so much fun to watch.  Love Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman together.  Can't wait for season 3 to start.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|I missed watching &#34;the good wife&#34; on t.v.  Now that I'm catching up with the series, I'm loving it.  It has such good plots.  The writing is wonderful.  Acting is good.  I'm happy to watch it and recommend it for anyone.
B00511PTWM|4.0|I wanted to have 2 outlets to charge electronics on road trips, this does exactly that.  Very satisfied with my purchase.
B007SGM084|5.0|Excellent read for those of you who like this type of stuff. Wish she would begin to write another trilogy.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|The graphics are outstanding and the storyline is intriguing. I would recommend this game to anyone who loves a story with an exciting hidden object game.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Works very well, I love that I can customize the different colors for the battery. I would be willing to pay 99 cents
1932100660|3.0|I honestly cannot review \\"THE CHINA STUDY\\" because I didn't read it. I know it has good reviews from others who have read it. Sorry, for my lack of opinion.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|good steady reading with no letdown,it was a blast it just had so many good characters, that were getting to me
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very entertaining! Good time filler. I actually found myself getting irritable on several levels, and of course the answer was right in front of me. Just had to think outside the box.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It's a lot of fun and really challenging, but there should be a hint button if you get stuck for a period of time. But in all reality I love it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Very well written game, no bugs, challenging but not too difficult. It's one of the better escape games out there. Works great for kindle.
B0090KZDSK|2.0|boring to read, nothing new in the book, not as good as the first two books, terrible ending, very dissapointing
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Super fun and addicting game. Very good way to kill some time on a gloomy day. Some levels are pretty tricky but there's help online
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Love the thrill of the game wish it was all free though. Cut me off after a while would like to be able to still play free. Well worth the download
B0054LJGWS|5.0|This book could have been about anything. The topic really wouldn't have mattered, because it is a symphony in words. Here you have two guys (Gaiman and Pratchett) playing with words where you find layers of meaning in every sentence. The way they write their British English, the language is more than a language, it embraces culture, history and tradition. Which is why i see a film progressing as i read it.<br />And it is all about humor. It is about making me (the reader) laugh. (Or actually it was about getting eachother laughing whilst writing it) (Just like a Lennon/ McCartny cooperation in music, not that they laughed, they quarreled, but they made eachother better)<br />And i laughed. When I read about the \\"Buggre Alle This Bible\\" my wife wanted to call me an ambulance, she thought I had a nervous breakdown, which of course i did, but that is an other matter.<br />It is sometimes hard to draw breath, because the small funny details is queuing up. Like for instance the footnotes to Milton Keynes or the British monetary system or the tiny detail about the traffic warden`s combusted notebook as both \\"the devil\\" and \\"god\\" argue about whose invention he really wasn't.<br /><br />The frame of the book is that Armageddon is coming, and due to a minor cock-up by a sweet satanic nun, Antichrist is swapped just after birth.<br /><br />Enjoy! God (and the other guy) knows I did.
1781162646|2.0|Stephen King got too cute with this one.  He pulled off his attempt at the old dime-store paperback, but this piece is about as robust as any of the other fluff you'd find on one of those spinning racks at the back of the drugstore.
B005CMSDLE|4.0|Great story, and keeps you on the edge of your seat. I can usually predict  the outcome in movies, but I couldn't with this one.
B007OWRBJK|5.0|Instead of the usual recounting of booze, groupies, and drug, Pete actually talks about the times and reflects on how they shaped his personality and his music. He does talk about the &#34;sec, drugs, and rock 'n roll&#34;, but that is by no means the main thrust. He does not gloss over the bad times in his life. The reader comes away with a deepened appreciation for him and his art.
0553386794|3.0|I really expected more from such a lauded novel - but it fell flat for me.  I think the real problem is that so many people are used to drivel (like a popular vampire novels or such) that they don't know what good writing is.  People repeatedly say in their reviews - \\"great writing\\" but it should be great - Martin is a professional writer and has editors.<br /><br />I did find this easy to read.  That's the only reason I gave it three stars and not two.  However, there simply are too many story lines being followed simultaneously and too much development.  I was excited at the beginning and hopeless after two thirds of the book.  If I didn't read it quickly (just a week) I may have never finished.  Even the political 'complexity' many review as being so enticing I felt was banal.  Bernard Cornwell is better at political intricacies in series like his Warlord Chronicles (much better than this with more shocking surprises - even though it is historical fiction it 'feels' like fantasy because it is about King Arthur).<br /><br />I think most of this hype is HBO related.  I haven't seen the series, so I won't comment on that.  Perhaps the media is controlling our thoughts after all?<br /><br />In short, this book is longer than it is good.  Martin isn't Tolstoy (or Tolkien for that matter).  There really doesn't need to be five or more different places and people we are reading about at once.  There should be more discipline in his writing than this.  By the time someone important died, I was happy - and felt no more sympathy for the Starks (heck - I am not even 100% sure they are the protagonists in this novel because so many people are written about - maybe this is really Tyrion's story or Dany's - they are both possible heroes.  I should know after 674 pages!!  but I don't.).<br /><br />Read this if you must, but there is much better writing out there.  This is pedestrian fantasy without substance or depth.
0679805273|5.0|I bought this for a friend whose daughter is in preschool - she has each of her children's teachers sign the book as they go through school for a &#34;yearbook&#34; of well wishes!
B000WBOV1G|5.0|It's really great program, I own both seasons, I wish had not taken off the air. It would have made a lot more great seasons, I was disappointed. When there were only 2 seasons
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|I love Bejeweled and this game is just as fun. I can kill time for a while or for just a minute if that is all I have.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|I really love my case.  It was just what I wanted.  It works wonderfully.  I hope you will enjoy it too!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I am a weather person and I can obsessively check the weather to anywhere that I might be going to anytime.
B009GXHOW4|5.0|This is one of the best apps ever!!! I really enjoy playing around with the stuff that is not in the game yet on my survival world!
B00CHNKJFO|2.0|This app was good for almost 3 years since I no bought it.  However, ever since the update back in January 2016 of the 2 New Star Wars The Force Awakens game tables, the app itself became very corrupted!  I am VERY angry that the app WILL NOT WORK because of the new update.  For Zen Studios, the creator of the app, PLEASE FIX IT NOW!  Thanks so much.
B002I9Z8I0|4.0|I bought this collection for my wife and all I can say is, for the price it cant be beat.
0385536828|5.0|This is NOT really a SPY NOVEL - It's a love story with a twist and lot of literary references - Plus a page turner - Reminded me a little of some of my favorite William Boyd novels.
B008EZVNFE|5.0|Only issue I had was the CD cover was greasy and smelled like coconut oil it would't play initially in my player until I wiped off the oil. Other than that I'm a huge fan, love her  style..
B001TM14VC|5.0|One of the best movies ever, trully ahead of its time, the special efects, the scenarios and of course the Cast.
B00992CF6W|5.0|All of the people who gave this app one star must be really impatient. Amazon always waits for the bug fix updates! Its for the benefit of the user! Anyway... this is a fantastic app and a great pocket version of the famous game. I got it a while a go right before the update. After the update it was amazing. I am extremely happy with my purchase and I'm sure you will be too.
B00BEPVAV8|2.0|its hard to control and its very short amount of time to actual play................ its a giant waste af time
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is extremely addictive i must warm you of this right off the bat. Secondly if you've ever heard or have played temple run then I suggest that you play this game because in my opinion opinionit is a lot like temple run but better!
B002JIEYLC|4.0|This CD is obviously a must have for Sabbath fans. It's some of their most creative music from their best period as a band (1970 - 1976). It's a lot different from their other CDs, but I think that the change was definitely refreshing. I see it as a partner with Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, as I think both albums are similar in style, with this one rocking a little bit more. If you like Black Sabbath outside of their Paranoid album (which everyone should love, even if you aren't a fan of Ozzy) you'll be sure to love this one.<br /><br />+1 for the album artwork.. What the heck is Ozzy wearing?!<br /><br />If you can, try to get the UK edition under their Sanctuary label. The packaging on that edition is nice, and it comes with expanded liner notes. The remastering job they did on the Sanctuary discs is stellar. The original US WB edition also sounds pretty good as well, so if you don't care about having nice packaging, and don't want to pay that import price, this edition will satisfy your craving for Sabbath as well!!<br /><br />Rock on,<br /><br />Kyle
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is absolutely awesome and wonderful to play in your free time. Everyone who looks at this game just know it is a really good game to play
B00C81LYH2|5.0|Beautiful Barbie Doll in a Beautiful gown for the 2013 holiday season will make a perfect gift for a little girl or collector. I very strongly recommend it. Beautiful doll all around in the tradition of Barbie.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Challenging but not so much where I got bored and put it down out of frustration. Really enjoyed the  different puzzles and tasks.
B009MYARIK|1.0|Anything written by Ms. Kinsella is always and automatic purchase.  I loved almost all her work.  I hated mini shopaholic, couldn't even finish reading it, (a whole book about her trying to throw a surprise party?  come on.), but thought she may have just went one book too far with the series.  I really actually enjoyed I've got your number, and was really excited about this book...fail.  The characters are just not likeable.  I hated how it kept switching from Lottie to Fliss.  the male characters were just boring.  the only character i did like was Fliss's son.  I couldn't even read half of this book before i gave up on it.  Most of Sophie's previous work always had me stuck in the first few pages.  I tried so hard to get into this book, and it just wouldn't happen.  The whole plot itself was just unrealistic.  I actually feel bad giving any Kinsella book a bad review, as I've always loved her work.  If Ms. Kinsella does write another book, i'm sure I will buy it, but please please please, Sophie, don't disappoint us!!!
B002JC9RMY|1.0|this is the worst take on dragon ball i have ever seen in my life anyone who says they are a true fan of the dragon ball saga and likes this movie needs to shut there mouth and yall know who im talking about this movie is so far off the true saga that it has really no relation nothing in the movie happened like it did in the true dragon ball saga so this movie needs to be burned so if i were you i would not get this movie if you were giving it to me for free lucky for me it was on netflix instant watch so i did not half to pay for it and its a good thing so dont waste your  money on this POS movie i beg of you...
B000000QFV|5.0|This is an awesome CD with Tony Martin laying down incredible vocal work. Every song rocks. This is a Metal must-have.
B009X01GJ2|2.0|Had to send this one back. It was the wrong one for my Kindle, couldn't tell much from the description when it was ordered.
B002RVCD0U|2.0|T1 and T2 were great, and even T3 was above average stuff, within the action movie genre. But this is just trivial.<br /><br />The director is not someone I'd ever heard of before, and I'm not sure who thought the man that made Charlie's Angels was qualified to do a Terminator movie, but the results are not so much bad as just yawn-worthy. The writing is also mediocre, with bizarre plot ideas that just lack credibility, not to mention whole scenes that make little or no sense. It is definitely painful to see what was once a great franchise sold into the fumbling hands of third-rate talent.<br /><br />Oh, and the ending involves a gratuitous tear-jerker plot twist that is completely lacking in believability.<br /><br />Overall, not worth your time. Find something else to watch.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|This novel is based on French history and often times is very confusing and hard to understand. Just read about the characters and ignore most of the comentary on France of the era.
B001XUJMZK|4.0|Good sound and video.  I do not rate all these because of your requirement for all these reviews.<br />Word, word
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|This movie was interesting, not as good as the hipe when it was new. J. Lawrence was good but not really Oscar caliber, she is no M. Streep.
B008P9M614|1.0|I too got this set only to discover a bunch of broken plastic falling on my lap when I took out the cases from the box.<br />Every single season case was fractured, the DVDs inside were scuffed.<br />Customer service was not willing to replace the item for me for some weird reason. Instead - they took it back, refunded me the money, and asked me to place a new order.<br />That's not very helpful, because in the new order no one will be sure to check the item more thoroughly and make sure I wont receive it broken again.<br /><br />This will be my second and final attempt. If I get it broken again, I will be extremely disappointed with Amazon, which has so far been very helpful to me with other items, and that would be a real shame.<br /><br />Either way, I'll be sure to update here with what happens.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My grandson absolutely loves this Kindle Fire game. It is easy to use and very much like the XBox version. Given the difference in technology, I'd say this is a great, affordable ,and portable option.
B0074ALZ7Q|5.0|Great book with suspense and a sense of eeriness all the way through. The extract at the end was very interesting and thought provoking in regards the author.
B002KLOPF8|5.0|I rate the first part in PI 5+  stars. The second part is not as good but the PI part is so good that it elevates the final count to 5 stars.
B00D8WJ9JK|5.0|Vintage cole the boy gets better and better this album is at LEAST as good as his first album,Cole World,The Sideline Story
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft so much cause you do want to do and it lets do it.  if you don't like it than destroy it.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This app does what you need it to. My alarm clock broke and I used this as a backup. It tells you the day, time, date, weather, and temperature. You can have it on even when your tablet or phone is in sleeping mode. You can choose which days you want it to repeat (ex: I wake up at 6:00 a.m. but prefer to sleep in on Saturday until 7:00 a.m. Not that I really do, but it was an example.) Terrific! Get this app!!!
B0062QRTKA|3.0|The premise of this game is simple and imaginative.  Very unique from what I've seen on the appstore.<br />Unfortunately, this game is way too challenging  and frustrating for what I thought was an easy-going, casual game.<br />The first few levels were okay, but it quickly became way too difficult for me to enjoy playing.
1878424319|4.0|This book was recommended to me by several friends. It was a great buy and easy to read. I would recommend this book used, as a good value.
B00BWRKVVS|3.0|I love The Emperor's New Groove. I've been waiting so long for Disney to release it on blu-ray. So as soon as I saw it was out I had to have it. The two-movie combo pack had me worried, and rightfully so. Although the video and audio quality is just fine, both movies are crammed onto a single disc. There are no extras whatsoever, not even original trailers. For those extras you have to go to the DVD. And whereas the DVD features an animated menu, this blu-ray awkwardly attempts to implement a separate menu for each movie, with both being a simple splash image and no animations whatsoever. Yes, a menu plays little role in the actual movie, but it makes the package as a whole appear very shoddy. Give me an HD source and I could create the same blu-ray and menu in a day.
1451695195|5.0|I really enjoyed this book as an insight to the after-life. I have shared it with several friends who are dealing with loss of family loved ones. Reassuring and comforting- a great book and good value.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|I have been ready James Rollins books since his first Sigma adventure and they are captivating. Once I start a new book I cannot put it down. Bought this book for a trip to Italy to enjoy the flight there
B004NQO61Q|5.0|Seems to be working out great. A very different type of mouse but for hand issues it is good. Small size a benefit as well.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Bought a new Samsung 3D TV and what other movie could you pick. None. This was stunning in the movies and should be in every person with a 3D tv's collection
B004I2K4DY|5.0|I love this.  I saw it on PBS and knew I had to have it.  Alfie Boe is brilliant.  His acting, expressions, stance and singing it superb.  The music is classic as well.  Definitely a keeper and a classic.
0399226907|5.0|This book has provided an Autistic student the perfect practice he needed for the days of the week. Very sturdy and kid friendly.
B000SEI230|5.0|It's no wonder Sparks is as well known as he is. Amazing story!  Such an inspiring message. I cannot wait to read more of his books
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was great!  I couldn't put it down.  Their sense of humor intrigued me.  I would definitely recommended this book!
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|Don't know why this movie wasn't more popular when it came out; so entertaining.  I really wish they woulda kept making them just like the books :(
B0041D843M|4.0|Every American should be required to read this. Big business should not be allowed to destroy the health of the public.
B009VSW15Y|4.0|I haven't had an opportunity to use this camera yet but hopefully it will<br />do all the functions as suggested in the write-up.
B002VUFKG6|4.0|Nice follow-up to Eat, Pray, Love; which, by the way, was much better than the movie. Her writing style is quite entertaining.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Love the action, characters, mix of story line and some comical content. Can't wait for Red 2 to come out!
B0033780Y0|4.0|Peter Freestone does a good, honest job in telling who the real Freddie Mercury was. I enjoyed it although I found Freestone's accounts of Freddie's affairs, the description of Garden Lodge and the poorly narrated description of Queen's videos shooting (why did he include this?) irrelevant. It has a sad ending, but of course, we knew that before actually buying the book. Worth reading for Mercury fans.
B005HSG3VK|1.0|The case is cheap and cheap looking. It is flimsy and does not stand as shown. Over all satisfaction of the product was a waste of money. The cover is thin and would not protect my kindle from anything. Purchased a different case and gave the Pink microcell to the trash man.
B0000BWVCM|2.0|I have never read an X Men comic. My first exposure was in  the first movie, which I enjoyed. This is not so much an indictment of this particular movie as a mega complaint about a character. I was willing to suspend my disbelief when Mystique fought Wolverine, AS Wolverine. However, when Mystique broke into the school's archives (OK, that may not be the correct name for the location, but she broke into some secret place of the good mutants) and first transformed into Professor X to gain entry (remarkable how she can literally make such a perfect transformation right down to the fingerprints, eyes, whatever),and, when Jean Grey shows up while Mystique is photocopying some secrets, Mystique makes a quick change into the janitor, whom she passes in the hallway. I'll accept the physical change, but I CANNOT get my brain around her ability to also change into the exact attire of whomever she turns into. Sorry, but that is too much for me to fathom. I ejected the dvd as the janitors passed each other in the hallway. I mean, if she can create duplicate clothes from nothing, then her powers are virtually limitless. Game over. This character ruins the whole premise of X Men for me.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I was skeptical at first to indulge in this book... however after reading it I am looking forward to reading the others in the series.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I enjoyed the game. just complete the game in less than a day. It really make you use your mind l which a challenge is always good. Thank you!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Same old game witch is still awesome.<br />Keep up with the updates.<br />This game is something to cherish.<br /><br />KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK GAME MAKER!!!  :)
B004OEIL54|3.0|This is a stylish thriller/mystery and one of the best horror movies in years- but where's the uncut version? Where's the NC-17 version? I wish I could get the uncesnored version of the movie. I want the NC-17 version of Scream.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Best game ever. I feel like I have a real horse.<br />You earn money from fun games and you have a lot of fun.
B005HV6YO8|5.0|What a true talent and wonderful artist.  Push play and cruise control - have a great day. Fabulous array of his best music. Happy buyer.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was my first Hugh Howey book (or collection of books) and I have to say I was really impressed. The collected stories are essentially one continuous novel. It's a bit long, but what I really liked about it was that it wasn't predictable. Just when you think you know what's going to happen, the story goes in a very different direction. If you're looking for a good Sci-Fi fix, this is worth it.
0679805273|5.0|I bought this for a gift to my daughter and it is great exactly as pictured. A true classic for every library.
B006N0YWGY|5.0|Took some time to load to my kindle fire but when installed the play was very smooth and the graphics are great. Play is very fast. I am NOT an airboat driver and you all should. be thankful for that. I was able to get upside down a couple of times and wrecked just about every cabin in the swamp. Good fun. Never did see any gators but was able to outrun the law most of the time.
B000SW4DXK|5.0|I loved this movie when I was younger and now my daughters & son will love watching every Christmas too!
B007FEZQF8|5.0|This graphic novel is very different than the T.V. series, while characters were added and taken out it still focuses on the same key points (Survival, Team effort, etc.) , also while maintaining a connection story line.
B00DGNO3WE|2.0|This film had been so highly touted due to the director that I was expecting something fresh and insightful.  Instead, what I saw was close to an exploitation film a la Marigold Hotel and other cliches depicting old people waiting for God.
159463176X|5.0|What a wonderful storyteller. It's absolutely believable and the characters seem so real. I feel more sympathetic with the people of Afghanistan and their plight.
B005K17RU0|5.0|It's great to be able to see th e weather where our relatives are. It makes us so happy we live where we do. It seems to be very accurate that it makes you wonder why the local forecasters can t get it  right.
B0091REZMW|4.0|The only reason I gave this game 4 stars instead of 5 is due to some performance issues on my Kindle afire. The game freezes sometimes and sometimes when I try to start the game it just goes back to the Kindle main screen.  The game is addictive so I am willing to put up with these problems.  Hidden object scenes are the main part of the game but they really are means to collect various objects to fulfilled quests or fight monsters or enter new rooms.  The game never gets boring because you constantly have new objectives. Some people have complained about needing to use money to play but if you have patience that is not necessary.  I am at level 18 and have not spent any money.  I am thinking of buying some diamonds (the major currency in the game) just to reward the developers for making such a fun game.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Let me start by saying I'm admittedly tough when it comes to Harlequin's adult titles. I enjoyed them back in college for a bit, but once you get down to it, it's the same story over and over again. Still, when I read the synopsis and saw the pretty, fresh cover, I had to give Waking Up Married a try. Sadly, it's the same formula with a lil bit of pep to it (that pep fizzles rather quickly).<br /><br />This story starts off really cute and promising. I liked the introduction to the MC's and I admit I was grinning. I love stories where couples start off married, but not necessarily in love. It's fun watching the relationship grow and wondering if it'll work out for them. Though Connor seemed way too pragmatic about the idea of love, one you get to know his character, it all makes since. Likewise, I really felt for Megan. There's one particular scene that made me want to give her a hug.<br /><br />Here's where things get disappointing. As we move towards the middle of the book, I found them rather boring together and the romance disappointing. I liked them, but there was just something missing. What started off kind of fresh and full of potential quickly turned into the predicatable. In the end, it was just an ok love story
1582701709|5.0|This book has profound ideas about how we live our lives.  This is one of those books you need to read with an open mind and it can help you open your mind to all the possibilities.  We underestimate the power of our mind.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Not sure what to think!!! More unanswered questions!! More questions not answered!! Kinda all over the place!!! Didn't care for the ending.......
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Loved this book. All 3 were very good. I loved the story and romance. It was the kind of book I couldnt put down.
0156027321|1.0|Trite and sententious epigrammatic observations, an artificial and annoying sense of wonder, symbolism that doesn't work.... and it's about 314 pages too long.<br /><br />Tyger, tyger, speaking rote,<br />To a cretin in a boat,<br />What pretentious writer's eye<br />Dared frame this asininity?
B004J4WLB4|3.0|I found myself wondering as I read the book whether I liked Victoria or not. Still haven't decided. I think I enjoyed the book but also found the ending a little too neat for such a complicated character---but I would not have liked another ending. Guess I'm as mixed up as Victoria.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|So disappointed with this book. All the other books were good. What happened?! Sad sad sad how can you mess up such a good story?!
B000005HFH|2.0|Not original recording as advertised. Some selection cut off prior to the end. Not at all pleased with the recording quality.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|most of the levels were easy enough to figure out but challenging enough to want to keep going. not too much of going back and forth and unlike many games similar to this, you don't have to remember a million clues or numbers. cant wait for more levels!
078401213X|1.0|Reading the reviews I get the feeling that a lot of people feel obligated to give the movie high marks simply because it is focused on a mathematician. In reality, it doesn't include much math, or genius, other than trying to understand a number the computer spit out. The feel if the movie is more psychedelic \\"wow, man\\", than a movie that really makes you think.<br /><br />In short; if you're over your hippy years, or are interested in genuine mathematics, you will most likely be disappointed.
B009FZFONO|5.0|The Season 3 episodes were great.<br />All story lines were masterfully cohesive.<br />The characters interesting.<br />A must see for all horror fans
B0061S073A|1.0|Took my 10yr old all of 5 minutes to bypass this app. Why is something so simple as blocking a certain website so hard to find for the kindle. And yes I know I can turn off the Wi Fi connection but that basically makes the kindle useless.<br /><br />There are built in parental controls on the kindle, but just like these in this app, do not work.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game was challenging and fun! I loved it! Need more floors!! Very addicting. Was sad to see there were not many levels. Please add some soon.
B0043JDUNS|4.0|The characters have good sense of humors and the actors work well together.  I like the movie.  A must see and a good action movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's a good game it keeps you busy getting coins and special tokens for spike, tricky, and fresh. Or you can get the players that cost coins.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Perhaps even better than the first!  Love it.  Several spots that made me gasp even.  Can't wait to start the 3rd!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is pretty cool and entertaining. This game is also pretty simple and is a good way to relax.
B00A4YZWN2|5.0|For those of us that can remember the Berlin wall coming down, I have to say this novel struck chords. For anyone younger it's a cross between Hunger games and Twighlight ish.....hard to describe but at the end of the day a great read. The morale of the story is fight for what you believe in even if thats sometimes hard, the end result is worth it, both for you and the ones you hold dear.  All around the world this is what our boys fought for 70 years ago, your right to say NO.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|easy to operate am using in sunday school  might like to see hooking off line use easier to use thanks
B000IKQK7E|5.0|One of the movies I saw and loved as a kid but have really only seen a few times. Not a million times like blazing saddles or the breakfast club or revenge of the nerds... So I loved it and although I know a lot of the lines I can't recite the whe movie.. Which my girlfriend likes
B000002LFZ|5.0|So I bought this and am VERY pleased with it!<br /><br />Many excellent songs to sing too loud to as you drive to work...at least you'll be in a good mood!
B0058W74UY|1.0|Can't watch any videos without static & interruptions & skips over big chunks. Don't understand why this is even available and/or supported by Amazon. Not good!
B005LAII80|3.0|The story was ok but the carrot the was a bit too serious he would have been better if he was just a robot
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Took me a couple of chapters to get into it but then it was like I had to finish the characters snuck up on me a little. I just really enjoyed this one.
1444723537|1.0|I ordered this book so I could read Rage, which SK pulled from the shelves after Columbine, and it was NOT IN THIS COLLECTION despite other reviews saying it was. I've read 2/3 of the others, so there's no reason for me to own this book. I'm very disappointed and plan to return it if I can.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|I love the complexity of the plot and the numerous characters from a different era of history.  It is sometimes difficult to accept the horrible things that happen but that is part of the story.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|AMAZING FOR THE LACK OF A BETTER, WORD COOL PEOPLE AWESOME<br /><br />LIKE THIS ITEM LOVE IT I<br />BUY AGAIN<br /><br />4 DAY CHARGE
B0060MYM3S|5.0|This continues the unraveling of the plot and displays the characters' tendencies towards good or evil.  It is a magnificent if horrible story of life during this fantastic time of the game of thrones.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|It is awesome. It's like I'm in World War II. It makes me feel like I'm in war. I love it.It is the best gun app ever. but i wish you had more guns
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Absolutely beautiful, challenging without being discouraging, fully engaging. Brilliant interface that was so much fun to play with. Hope the sequel comes soon if not out already. Thanks for the gift of this wonderful puzzler; please keep it up and we'll keep buying!
B005EGXNLS|5.0|With  Uhtred telling the tale, you know that he has survived whatever enemy he faces.  It is always interesting to see how he does that.  Mr. Cornwell always does a great job of making the reader feel like he is not just reading a story, but actually watching the events unfold.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|i was bummed to learn that it didnt end. i do not think this book was as good as the other 2. i really have liked her writing style but there are times when from page to page the editor should have read it better that it is not a fluid story.
B008I43DYU|5.0|I use it all the time to balance my checkbook. It is easy to use-the numbers are large and it is easier than my calculators.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|As a lifelong original series trek fan, albeit one who doesn't yet have a Blu Ray player, these are of decent enough quality for my 1920 x 1200p 17 inch widescreen laptop.  I route the audio through my external speakers, get the popcorn, and I'm set for a weekend night of entertainment the newer movies (except maybe First Contact) can't match.  Their compact size is nice, too.
B000BHN7D4|5.0|Great valve for money. CD reached me in excellent condition and amazing time frame. Would recommend to friends. Thank you.
B004EPYZPS|5.0|This movie is great and I like the action and things that happen in it; I'd recommend it for other people.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is so addicting. even when I hear the sound for the battery I keep playing. this game is just plain amazing in my opinion!
1603425381|5.0|I can't wait to try including some of these border on a project. Beautiful book. A great library addition for anyone who crochets.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Best graphics and gameplay for a free app game, I'd spend money to buy it. Reminds me of Baulders Gate for the ps2.
0385394233|4.0|A nice mix of personal experience, research, reality and hope. If you're looking for a \\"how-to-start-at-the-bottom-and-make-it-to-the-top\\" book, you'll be disappointed. If you appreciated Sandberg's TED talk, you'll probably also like this book. The book does seem a little repetitious at times, but Sandberg's main points bear repeating. Not just for women executives, Lean-In offers insight into the masculine power structures that persist in our society and ideas for shifting gender paradigms and moving toward a healthier balance for future generations. I listened to the audiobook.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I had never really been interested in this series and was on vacation with nothing on TV and I decided to start from Season 1, I love this series.  Wish I would have been alive during this time, I love all of the tradition and pomp and circumstance.  Dressing for dinner, imagine!
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|Whether you love or hate the musical direction DP went on this album, it just sounds good. Niles Rogers and company did an expert job in the studio, and the basslines are outstanding.<br /><br />What appeals most to me is the blend of disco-funk and electronica that results in a great album to dance, work, drive or chill to. The other blend of real instruments and beats/sounds/effects results in a &#34;warm&#34; familiar sound with all the catchiness of dance/electonic hooks. The homage to dance and pop synth from the 70's and 80's could come off cheesy to some, but Daft Punk gives it the right touch and makes it sound current.<br /><br />Highlights:<br />3. Giorgio by Moroder - slow start, but gets great after Giorgio finishes his story. Transitions into a sick neo-classical electronic groove, then to smooth jazz, then to some scratching alongside a meaty bass walk.<br />5. Instant Crush - great 80's era beat with robo-Julian Cassablancas on vocals.<br />6. Lose Yourself to Dance - possibly catchier than 'Get Lucky' ... and you'll love this if you like 'Get Lucky'<br />8. Get Lucky - if you haven't heard this catchy gem, get to the radio or Youtube.<br />12. Doin' it Right - uses the robo vocals as background music for Panda Bear. I can't stop listening to this song.
B004Z2TUGE|2.0|I was pretty excited to watch this movie. But I was really just disappointed.<br />The ending was bad, the fight scenes were bad. Overall, I found the entire movie bad. I wouldn't recommend this movie. I was going to write a long review of this movie, but I can sum up the entire movie in one word; BAD!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This is a fantastic book, and will truly take you to another world. I can't wait for the next one to come out!
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|This ends in the middle of the story. Obviously she was needing to get this out before it was ready. Very disappointing.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|I've been a Queensryche fan from the beginning. I've been dissapointed since Hear In The Now but have stuck with band any way. There's a little bit of good songs on some of the albums but overall I'd say they that they have lost their way.I listened to Tate's version of the band was once again dissapointed. But this new version of the band hit's it out of the park & then some. Reminds me a lot of the Empire album with doses of Mindcrime & Promise Land thrown in. Great metal album. As far as people bitching about the sound? GET A NEW STEREO! I find not a thing wrong with the sound. You must be listening on a Coby boombox or must not know how to adjust your stereo. Ryche & Roll returns!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a simple puzzle game that's fun to figure out.  great game can't wait for the new rooms!  fun!
B00AGH6FD8|5.0|Always a good watch. Funny. We are always looking for a movie we can watch as a family, with young kids those are harder to find these days. Some language in this movie is not the best but overall a good movie.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Great app performs as described; One can appreciate this when you purchase an app. Worth the upgrade/ upscale. I do hate the nagging tho.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|This is a toy, and I am a fully grown man, 21.  Yeah I played with it, took around with me and still do.  Pretending I am the Doctor, &#34;fixing&#34; stuff, failing to operate on wood etc.  I am looking forward to buy another one just for collection.<br />It is only a toy, not a nice and pretty replica.<br />The most disappointing aspect is the UV light.  I mean, I am 21, who Im I be going to be writing secret messages to?  They light doesn't look or appear blue, but more of an indigo color.  It looks great off:p, but I can live with that.<br /><br />**You need a screw driver to put in the batteries in you screw driver**
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|Having read and loved Hosseini's previous books, I really looked forward to this novel, and while I enjoyed it, it didn't 'grab' me in the same way.  It's set out in quite a complicated time pattern, so working out the relationships can be a bit puzzling.  I can see why he's done it, but does it detract from the story?  On the upside, one does get a wonderful sense of daily life in Afghanistan and how people cope with living in that country.
B00571F26Y|2.0|Uses data without scientific method. Gives support anecdotally. No new information.  Really is a low or non carb diet recommendation.
1616550414|5.0|As a big fan. This made my day. (1 month) Perfect price. No complaints what so ever. Has everything from the beginning to the end of the series.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|This game is awesome but it needs a lot more guns like the 1911 and the mp40<br />Which would make the game more epic
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Not too hard. Not too easy. This game has just the right combination of fun and thinking! Please add more levels soon!
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|The game is addictive, so beware it could become a bit<br /> expensive because you become so involved with winning and you end up buying more coins :( so don't let that happen to you like it almost did to me. I also don't like the fact that you have to wait a long time to build up free coins.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I nearly quit work so I could read the entire set in about a week. Stayed up way to late blasting through this series. Great entertaining story, Amazing characters and plots.
B002N9MK8G|5.0|The Man is at his best in this, his comeback performance following a brief retirement.  Quincy Jones conducts the Count Basie Band, putting his own edgy imprints on the familiar Nelson Riddle arrangements.  A must for any serious jazz or standards listening library.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|To compare Rodriguez with Dylan isn't doing justice to Rodriguez's unique thematic and slightly jazzy style. Rodriguez's musical arrangements stand alone.
B005LAIIMG|5.0|I've read the book \\"World War Z\\" and it's a superb book. When I heard they would be turning it into a movie, I figured it would be a narrative film like Pitt's \\"Interview with the Vampire\\" in order to keep with the structure of the book or a different film altogether that only shares a name. It is indeed the latter but that's completely acceptable for a variety of reasons. It would be tough to copy it word for word from the book, turn it into a movie, and keep the film under 4 hours.<br /><br />Zombie films have become sort of repetitive. Either the zombies are these slow moving  undead (like The Walking Dead, which is a 5 star show IMHO) or they are fairly fast moving (like 28 Days/Weeks Later). Instead, these zeds move and act almost superhuman. At points, they work almost like fire ants; they cluster together and flood themselves into whatever it is they are going after. Sure, some fall a distance that would cause every bone and organ to explode out of their skin. But if your read the book, those are the type of zeds the soldiers were fighting: superhuman strength, speed, agility, anger, and the ability for their bodies to take all the abuse you could throw at it. The film recognizes that and makes these undead the most dangerous zombies ever. If you were to encounter a herd of these, there isn't a kukri, machete, sword, or anything short of a few thousand M1 Abram tanks that would slow them down (even then, I don't think it would help).<br /><br />As far as the lack of violence, or rather zombie slaying, the film itself is a different take on zombie films. There is plenty of zed killing but it keeps it to a PG-13 rating in regard to the amount of violence, blood, and gore. Instead of slaying herds and waves of undead, it focuses on finding out what and who caused it so a cure could be found. In a true zombie situation, this is exactly what the WHO and the CDC would do. To me, that is an excellent idea in order to create a fresh and new approach to zombies. Whilethe rest of us would be fighting and killing the zeds, there would be someone trying to create a cure or find out how to keep us safe. Consider it the more technical side of the zombie apocalypse. The film does implement some \\"jump\\" scenes very well while other times, you see it coming. It also puts our dear hero in bad situations in certain places that if a zombie outbreak were to occur in those places, most of us would simply **** our pants and cry like a little child. It also pulls some stuff from Brook's other book and from popular zombie websites. Unfortunately, they use some dialog that is cringe worthy and unoriginal: most notably bug out bag, preppers, and other terms that make you think who ever wrote the film simply searched internet forums to find cliche terms regarding the whole zombie culture (at least nobody says \\"Get my IFAK!\\"). They are few and far between but they are still there. And don't worry; Pitt never screams \\"YOLO!\\" before putting himself in harms way.<br /><br />As far as the characters (and their actors), nobody jumps out at you. Sure you might cheer Pitt on or have sympathy for some people. But for the most part, they aren't truly memorable......with the exception of David Morse's character (who should of had a much longer part in the film) and a few other people later on in the film. You never become attached to any of them. So if a character gets bitten, you really have no sympathy or much care due to the lack of depth for each person. But then again, our hero isn't there but for one reason and it isn't to save their lives. But Pitt still nails it and does a bang up job delivering the film.<br /><br />If you are into slash and run zombie films, then you are probably not going to find this as entertaining as Dawn of the Dead or The Walking Dead or 99% of other zombie films. If you are expecting this to be a dead on version of the book, then understand it isn't even close. But it is indeed a great zombie action flick that has plenty of moments of action, suspense, thrills, humor, and terror. It's a \\"summertime\\" movie. Big budget, big name actors, lots of suspense, plenty of action, and most importantly, 2 hours to escape reality and be entertained.

1469220725|5.0|I LOVE this installment of the Crossfire Series! I love how Eva and Giddeon are not as insecure with their love and just how much he has proven to her she is the love of his life! All the twists and turns are exciting! What an imagination Sylvia has!!! :)
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The author made me fall in love with the characters and that was a first for me. Normally I have something to complain about but not with this story
0399255370|5.0|It seems that our young narrator, Duncan, gets to school and is about to open his crayon box to find a stack of letters on top.  The letters were individually sent by the various colored crayons with a myriad of complaints,except for GREEN, which is happy with its lot, but would like Duncan to settle the disputes the other colors seems to have. Some complain of being tired from being used too much, some are depressed at not being used enough, and one even complains that Duncan uses it to color outside the lines [for shame for shame] :-) Beige hates playing second fiddle to brown and pink thinks that Duncan feels only a girl would ever use pink. Duncan finally figures out a way to make all the crayons happy and the story ends well.<br /><br />I thought the drawings were very representative of what a kindergartner or first/second grader might do and kids of that age should easily be able to relate.  A quite original idea for anthropomorphizing inanimate objects and making them come to life and thrill the young ones at the same time.  Each of the various colored crayons had a letter written to Duncan in their very own color.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Awesome! I totally loved this book! Awesome love story<br />The book pulled you in and made me love Christian and Ana
B00C81AVNU|5.0|A very lively and exuberant cast brings high energy to the musical based on the movie &#34;Kinky Boots.&#34;  Great songs including those which explore the lives of the main characters.
B005HED11Y|5.0|I love the original series and it looks amazing in HD. I highly recommend this if you like Star Trek.
B0036FOGTW|5.0|What I like about this book is that Dambisa Moyo's critics stand outside the box. Where a bunch of authors had preached the gospel of Aid in reducing poverty, she conversely pointed it out as the source of poverty.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the awsomest game I have ever played and its like temple run and its just so fun to play!¡!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0679746048|5.0|When I first opened this book, I was shocked by how short it is. I started reading it on a Saturday morning, and finished it that Saturday afternoon. It was the perfect weekend read! It may be short, but it is packed full of descriptive narrative that's so easy to fall in love with. I found myself feeling a little happily insane just like the author. And it's always fun to watch the movie right after (which has always been one of my favorites) but after reading the book, it doesn't compare. I think you'll enjoy the (true) story the book offers vs. the movie. Although casting in that movie is nearly perfect :)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I LOVE IT! IT'S SO AWESOME, ADDICTING, AND PERFECT FOR ANY AGE, TO AGES 1 TO 100! I THINK EVERYONE SHOULD GET THIS!
B0000ADY9I|5.0|These are some of the best recordings the Allman Brothers Band ever made.  Recorded only a few months before Duane's death.  Some of the best slide guitar recordings ever made.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This entire book set up a forth one. It was not my favorite, but when I read it a second time I actually enjoyed it more, because Istopped trying to figure everything out. Plus there were some shocks in it that took me by surprise so once I was prepared for them the second time I was able to absorb more. I cant wait for book four! I hope Eva just lays into Corine for being such a manipulative &#34;B&#34;!!!
B0039TD7RC|5.0|This is the Stones at their peak.  The additional cuts in this double CD were left out of the original album.  They don't really fit Exile, but are pretty good anyway.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I love there love story. I feel like they are no where near the end of there story, but the author feels differently sine the follow up book not only did not do it justice, but ended their story through the epilogue. Well either way, this was a goo and fun book and I felt worth my time.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|It is working well, this is the good app to notify about your phone battery but I want this app without advertisements.

It had black marks everywhere, numerous dry grass.<br />So dirty that i am wondering how \\" new\\" this product is.<br /><br />Spent over 30 mn inflating the pool and after 1 hour of playing in it, it is deflating fast.<br />Bad quality.

1451695195|1.0|I am angry after reading this book because this author is either a complete liar or a deluded fool - and since he is an esteemed surgeon, the evidence perhaps falls on the former.<br /><br />By its very sub-title, this book purports to describe the author's \\"journey into the afterlife.\\"  However, within a few chapters it became clear that the whole premise is faulty.  The fact is, the author did not die.  He entered a comatose state after a rare infection had shut down the neo-cortex of the brain - the part that controls thought and emotion.  Once again, however, he did not die.  What follows in this tedious book is an account of what the good doctor recalled upon \\"miraculously\\" awakening from his coma, claiming to be a view of the afterlife or, as it has been termed, a Near Death Experience or NDE.  In fact, like all NDE'ers, he did not experience the afterlife because he did not die.<br /><br />While the doctor provides a variety of explanations for his NDE, and NDEs in general, he cleverly, and disengenously, discounts each one of them as inapplicable to his situation.  He even discounts what is known as the \\"reboot phenomenon.\\"  However, Dr. Alexander never discusses this possible explanation - that his entire supposed experience while in a coma that is detailed (did I say tediously) in this tedious book was a mere fantasy, a delusion, concocted by him AFTER he awakened from his illness-induces coma.  Now, a cynical person might surmise that it is worse than that - that the good doctor saw a way to make money and gain celebrity by publishing a book about his supposed experience of the afterlife praying on our inhernet, deep-seated and largely repressed, fear of death.<br /><br />Irrespective of the basis of the book, however, post-coma fantasy or post-coma lie, the bottom line is that there is only one way for a person to know what is in store for us after death - and that is by actually dying.  Or, as Herman Melville put it in the epigraph to Chapter 30 of thistedious book:  \\"And the drawing near of Death, which alike levels all, alike impresses all wiht a last revelation, which only an author from the dead could adequately tell.\\"  Well, sorry to say, Dr. Alexander is no \\"author from the dead,\\"  but merely an author who may also be a fraud.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|If your looking for a rad game this is it try it for yourself. When I tried this game I thought it was for retarded people. It's not though it's the best game for builders and dinosaur lover's
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Love the characters, love the singing. It has motivated my daughter to sing more herself. She has the cup song memorized and on key! She is only 8 1/2.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|This whole book was very interesting. When I was reading it I never wanted to stop. It was a great plot line, and everything was perfect. This book was planned out very nicely!!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|So far I love the Crossfire series. I love that this book finally show Gideon and Eva as a couple who trust each other and will do anything to be together. Can't wait for the next book! Love this one.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This he is so realistic I used to have a horse but one day he got out and an f as meet killed him because he was hungry from running all over he was my most famous horse

B00BHBBSZ2|5.0|Interesting program.  I have been sitting here writing...using this program and having fun.  Was thinking I would write a book.  Though I was writing mostly bullets..its really great.
125000098X|1.0|I was in my early teens when I first read \\"Not a Penny More, Not a Penny Less.\\" That was followed quickly by \\"First Among Equals.\\" I remember being amazed at how cleverly Archer wove the story from different POVs into one tale twisting ending. These Clifton Chronicles attempt to do the same thing. But now, I have the (mis)fortune of having lived over two decades from when I first picked up Archer books. Nothing in real life comes even remotely close to how these books portray them. His writing style too, seems to be aimed at people with a fifth grade reading level. While Dan Brown writes in a way that makes him seem too smart for his socks, Archer dumbs down his prose. Short sentences with lots of \\"everyday\\" words (like my first grader would say). The characters are vacuous, the writing vapid. Sure.. go ahead and read the books. But I doubt you will feel the joy you did from the earlier books. Archer's best is well behind him.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Cant wait for the next book. This book is truly one of my favorites. Its very heated but still shows the true passion people can have for each other.
B006N0YWGY|5.0|*Update* One thing I would change about this game is to let you see your cargo at the end before it's sold. Right now, at the end of the last run, it immediately cashes in everything immediately so all you know is the total amount.<br /><br />BTW, you can choose SWARM from the main menu to see the leaderboard with your and other players' best game and lifetime scores. You can also see the trophies you earned for various achievements.<br /><br />**<br /><br />This is another running type game of the Temple Run ilk except that you always get to your destination in the end regardless of how BAD you are! Crash into the tunnel wall? No problem! Land upside down in the road? Just turn around and keep going! Run over the police boat? Great! There is also more to the story than just \\"running\\". You have to make money by buying low and selling high. You pick up money on the way, (if you can), and at each trading post, you have to figure out what to spend your money on with an eye to selling it for profit. You have 10 days (runs) per game and at the end of the 10 runs your money is counted. This money accumulates and you don't die or lose your money if you crash. You can only lose money by making a bad trade.<br /><br />There is one speed -- VERY FAST. The sooner you make it to each stop, the more money you make in addition to the money you find along the way. The graphics are great  - looks just like the gator country I saw in Louisiana and game play works well. You have a choice of using tilt, touch, or on-screen controls.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This works better to charge my Kindle Fire HD then the charger that came in the box and for me its kid proof as well since I have a 2 year old that likes to chew on everything. If you have a Kindle Fire no matter what kind you need this to charge it.

0307341550|5.0|I first discovered the books of Gillian Flynn from some co-workers that were talking non-stop about Gone Girl.  So, when one of them asked if I had read it and I had said that I hadn't, she handed me the book and said, \\"you won't regret it\\".  So, even though I haven't read much thriller-type books since college, I thought, \\"what the heck, if it's that good, I need to read it\\", and read it I did.  Every single moment that I wasn't working or sleeping!  I was so caught up in that book that I couldn't put it down.  That is how  I decided that I needed to read every one of this author's books.<br /><br />  At first when I started reading Sharp Objects, I decided that I wasn't really that much into it.  I thought that Gone Girl could not be topped at this point, and I had a tough time getting through the first couple chapters of the book.  Then, it started getting interesting.  Our main character, Camille Preaker, it turns out, is quite the little freak show.  Camille is a journalist for a small-town Chicago paper, who  is sent back to her hometown of Wind Gap, Missouri, where she was to get the story on the abduction/murder of two little girls. She hadn't been back to Wind Gap in years, nor had she been in contact with her family either. So understandingly, she wasn't looking forward to this assignment. But, for the sake of the paper she does return, and this is where the nail-biting starts...<br /><br />  Sharp Objects is an awesome book!!  I can't really decide which one I liked better between it and Gone Girl - they were both that good!  Once again, I was absorbed by the story, and just like with  Gone Girl, I was once again bouncing around with my decision about who did what.  I have to tell you -  this family TOTALLY creeped me out!  If you want to know the ultimate in dysfunctional families, look no further than the Preakers.  I actually  live in Missouri and have been in the boot heel region many times, so I could almost picture this small town perfectly.  I can see the grand old Victorian house where Camille's mother and half-sister lived, right down to the main part of town with it's hole-in-the-wall bars, and dense forest area. Gillian has nailed it once again!<br /><br />All this being said, I am definitely ready to read the third book by Gillian, Dark Places.  I am totally sold on this author!  What a twisted imagination!!  Go out and get this book....I think you will thank me.see the grand old Victorian house where Camille's mother and half-sister lived, right down to the main part of town with it's hole-in-the-wall bars, and dense forest area.

B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|What sounded like a very interesting way to tell a story ended up being a movie that was boring and confusing, even with a very talented cast.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|This app is better than cut the rope.And its free.That makes it better than cut the rope.So stop reading reviews and download the game!
B00992CF6W|2.0|I hate it know because you can't join game's of other people.My name is Logan Echeverri and I'm 14 and I hate it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is a duplicate (Jesus Calling) Only ordered one and received. Previously reviewed.<br />Safe Haven was a great read. Hard to put down. I'm not normally into romance novels, but this was a goodie.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|If you haven't already, READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!! It's so good. It melts your heart and molds it back up again. I hope that there is a second book... I will be quite Engaged in it.
B00992CF6W|1.0|Do not buy if you want your life ruined! I bought this and got super addicted to it! I was playing it 24/7! I was wasting my time playing this horrible game.  DO NOT BUY IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A DECENT LIFE!
0385347774|5.0|One of the most original and entertaining books I have ever read. Almost weirdly obsessed with it. The details and voices were perfect. The theme was like a jolt of electricity. Best dialogue I have read in forever. Such a great dark comedic book. Loved it. Sorry it had to end. There was a lot of discussion about a disappointing ending, but i think it was startling and scary and cringe worthy--just perfect. OMG what if Amy was my mother?
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Brain tease. But I loved it. Being a single working mom not in school I never get to work out my brain.
B008OOYALE|1.0|This app has a false description. Dragonvale, FOR A FACT, is the best Dragon game for Kindle Fire. And,. they just copied Dragonvale. done. bye.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I love all the sookie stackhouse novels. I can't pick a favorite but I this one is in my top three.
B00C2VIA52|4.0|I was looking for a card game to kill time, and this seems like a good time killer that also is pretty entertaining. There's a few things that could use improving upon, but since it's free to play (at least initially) there's probably restrictions on what all can be added.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Loved it! This game was challenging without being too difficult. Can you escape was a lovely little game and I look forward to playing more levels.
0887308589|5.0|\\"The Dilbert Principle\\" by Scott Adams is a light-hearted critique of various problems that businesspersons often run into. The book is illustrated with Dilbert cartoons that relate to the sections that they're in. The book is somewhat long for a humorous book (over 300 pages) but it's fun to dip into occasionally.<br /><br />Adams' criticisms of modern business culture (excessive meetings, meaningless mission statements, clueless managers) is hilarious and oftentimes quite accurate. At the end of the book, Adams devotes a chapter to his idea for a business style: \\"Out After Five\\". His idea is good and worth reading; it feels like a breath of optimism after a somewhat cynical read. I recommend this book to anyone looking for light reading, especially if you like Dilbert or cartoons in general.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This entire series has been fantastic, and in fact, each book gets better as their relationship progresses. Sylvia Day writes her characters really well so that you get invested in them and can't hear enough of their story, which is really HOT, tender, exciting and loving. I devoured this book within a 24 hour period, reading through the night and even going to work the next morning. I just couldn't put it down. I loved it and it brought me to tears a few times. Even though some people are complaining that their saga is being continued with at least two more books, I couldn't be happier. I wish Gideon and Eva's story would never end. In fact, I can't wait for Captivated by You. Thank you, Sylvia Day! Keep 'em coming!
B00C7O8TSM|5.0|I have been a Beach Boys fan since I was 15. I was not able to attend their 50th anniversary tour and was so excited to have this collection from their tour. It's great to have them in my car singing their special sounds again.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Just loved this book! I was so happy to read that Gideon & Eva got married. I just hope that their marriage is not bothered by any of the other female characters in the book. Or male for that matter.The waiting for the this book to come out was a long time in coming, I hope that book four does not take that long to come out. Sylvia Day really knows her stuff in the romance department. Way to go girl!
0441013597|5.0|This is a remarkable creative work that is just as relevant today as ever.  Beyond the numerous accolades this book has received, at the end of the day, this is an intriguing analysis of human behavior, wrapped in great story telling.  This book is well worth reading and re-reading!
B00CWVG1Z8|4.0|A prettty good movie and was enjoyable to watch. I like to sometimes watch the paranormal romance type of movie sometimes and this fit the bill.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|A great book, everyone should read it. Its like a guide to the best life ever  and its practically free!
B0007DAZW8|4.0|A good collection of earlier Daft Punk music, I really enjoy listening to it in the car on road trips.
B00932DCS8|5.0|Stunningly beautiful visually. Then it takes a turn. Yep. A true crime thriller where you become engrossed into the story. Before long, you're cheering for certain characters and love where this is going.    It's like a great page-turner. You can't put it down. You have to keep reading.    Same \\"feeling\\" here.    I was completely satisfied by the end of this film. Wish more films more like this.    Two best films I've seen over the last year,  start to finish, have been foreign films. And neither of them starred Adam Sandler. Get your s*** together, Hollywood.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|I enjoyed watching this and ended up buying a copy of it later on. It has a good story and was interesting to watch.
B000CC7II8|5.0|The binding and printing of text are great.  I have several copies of this (one of my favorite books, tho my childhood is long past)  This is one of the best.  Stevenson is ever entertaining!

B00607EWYC|4.0|Beautifully written in the sense of the intricate use of the English language, admirable character development, yet I found myself yearning for a sense of plot to draw me through the pages.
B006LSZECO|4.0|It was fast paced and exhilarating.  I was on the edge of my seat, coundn't turn the pages fast enought.  However, I did not like the way it ended. But, I would recommend it!

B005544V6A|5.0|I head so many good things about this show and finally sat down to watch it before Season 3 airs on July 16th!  It's awesome and I'm hooked!  Highly recommend to anyone who enjoys shows like The Newsroom, House of Cards and Entourage.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game gets progressively harder as you go through each level.  It's fun to look for clues and try to remember where things are in order to find what you need to escape.  I enjoy it a lot and want more levels!
B004A8ZX28|4.0|Bought this movie cause we really liked it when watched it before. Haven't had the time to watch again but hopefully soon.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|I was quite excited to see this case for my Voyager Legend Bluetooth device.  The case is hard plastic and the bluetooth fits snugly inside it. You can carry it anywhere you need to go and have an extra charge when needed.  I was worried it would not work as advertised (so many of these things don't), but I was needlessly worried.  This item works exactly as described and is a perfect companion for my bluetooth device. i would recommend it to anyone who has the Voyager Legend Bluetooth device!
B005LAIIRQ|4.0|Got this awhile back and looks good ordered because we like the actor but haven't had time to watch yet as husband works out of town all week.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game  is awesome!!! I love the  game. If you are reading this  right now, you should get this game!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Pretty awesome game for price tag. Great for kids of all age groups. Warning, could become addicted. Once you start you may not want to stop.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I did not like this book as much as all the other reviews. I thought the book was well written and the romance was sweet, but still, the storyline is dense and the best characters (Six and Breckin) don't get as much part of the story as others...
B009XIXVU6|2.0|I was so excited to see that Khaled Hosseini had written another book....I had  thoroughly enjoyed his first two books.  Overall, I thought this book was so poorly written........it was page after page after page with such poor connections and the ending was just nonsense to fill up the required pages.evidently....I understood that it took him six years to finish &#34;And the Mountains Echoed a Novel.&#34;  That should have given me a hint!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I absolutely love this book! Great characters, wonderfully written. I can't wait for the sequel. This is the best romance I read in a long time. Delightful!
B00DIFARQ6|4.0|Sadly 2 samples was not really enough! Good graphics and challenging variations. But ......come on ....show me a few more variants and I would be hooked.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Could not put it down! Great history lesson to apply to the world now. Can't wait til the next book!
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|This game is more for children 10 and older but it was fun to play. Lots of hidden object mini games.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's awesome but I don't like how u can't blow up tnt in p.e other than that it's great!!!!!!! Get it now
B00BESIKWM|1.0|this movie nothing to do with the first or with the video game..kind of saw or Japanese movie, waste of production and direction and actors, good FX, but if you are a fan of silent hill you will disappointment nothing to do with the silent hill style or something close, at the end is a bad movie... do not rent or make copy forget it...
B0091REZMW|4.0|it is a great game if you want to work your eyes and brain.  its a challenge when trying to work through it at night. great game.
B00BK5D95C|5.0|This is the best album I have bought this year. And the best concert I have been to this year.<br />They are an AMAZING band, amazing vocals, amazing MUSIC. They are real, that's all I can say.<br />They take you somewhere with this album. LOVE IT. Perma-repeat in my car.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|Very nice looking product. I'll be evaluating it this week an post an updated review. So far I like how it was packed and what were provided, including a small pouch.
B004G6009K|5.0|Item was given as a gift and the recipient was very pleased with it - I would expect nothing less from a Disney product.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|love this app you can do sso Mich on it not to mention that the graphics are spool cool and realistic looking
B00CH26TL8|1.0|I just love this game. It's one of my favorite games to play and i am so excited to play it on the kindle fire. I am begging can you pretty please get candy crush saga that will just make my day and probably will make thousands of other addicts happy.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Laugh out loud funny, hot, swoony. Took me a little bit to get used to the narration but once I did, I fell HARD for Drew.
B00DC7NNAC|3.0|&#34;The Good&#34;: Nice special effects and cinematography was quite vivid. Nice concept and storyline<br />But<br />&#34;The Not So Good&#34;: The movie was too long and did not leave us wanting more.<br />So<br />&#34;Bottom Line&#34;  It was an OK movie, and made for a decent rental.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|It's hard to get with a first person narrator who seems to be examining himself and his response to events while at the same time being oblivious to the import of his actions.  In addition, the narrator's obsessive-compulsive style ends up being boring (as is always so with others' obsessions - but not my own).  The author's background as a prosecuting attorney leads him to over-describe courtroom tactics and behavior - though this might be interesting to non-lawyers.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Great challenges...one draw back its not free to finish got to pay half way in. But it is so worth the time and money...if you enjoy search and find you will enjoy this game.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|This game is a great time waster for those who love this type of game.  The levels aren't too hard and there are a lot of them.  I found this game really fun!
B008EKMB82|5.0|Masterpiece of multiple plots creatively woven together like an intricate Japanese ikebana which carry rich themes of time, questions of our humanity, and the strings of familial love that connect us throughout the generations. Every time I thought this book had given me a final revelation, not just about the characters lives but about life itself, the next wave of literary excellence would knock me over again. Wave after wave of literary prose sweep over and pull the reader through a journey, not only geographically but also intrinsically, connecting history, philosophy, and modern technology into a Tale for the Time Being.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|I love this game it's so fun to play! It's very entertaining. I love the action in it. It's cool how you get to be iron man.
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|Drama, music, entertainment, its all here!! I would recommend this almost anyone 15 yrs and older as the show really does leave an impression.
0425166805|5.0|Considerable evidence and intriguing questions are explored in this must read for everyone! I also feel the documentary compliments the book.

B009ZQ8FQG|2.0|We got season 1 through netflix and it was great season 2 and 3 through Amazon have given us trouble. The stream keeps stopping due to lack of connectivity. We have not had this issue with Netflix.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is a realy fun game to play really addicting game. levals are easy at first and get harder as ya go. fun graphic sound not so much
B000ID37RM|5.0|This classic black and white portrayal (considering the themes, the black/white filming reinforces the chasm between African Americans and whites) of the 20-30's South shows the horrible racism that existed then and is  still alive in parts of this country now. The lead character, Atticus, is brilliantly portrayed by Gregory Peck. It was interesting to see Robert Duvall as a young man who portrayed a lonely housebound person who really cared about the children who sometimes pestered him because he was different. The fact that children recognize injustice at an early age was evident. I think the themes of injustice,integrity, morality and taking the higher road are obvious in this movie. The cinematography was outstanding given the limitations at the time. This is a movie that is perfect for anyone, particularly families. The idea that Atticus was a hero in his children's eyes because he walked his talk was an important theme.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a very good app.. I play this game all the time!(: I love how the places change it makes the game much more enjoyable(:
0393327655|4.0|Good book, a hard point of view, very strong. Kind a difficult reading for those whose the english isn't the maternal language.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This game is so fun and scary! I highly recommend this awesome app! It is just like the PC version! Maybe even better! The graphics are amazing and slenderman's design is awesome! And after you collect 5 pages, slenderman is even scarier and has tentacles! And if you listen very closely slenderman can talk! Get this amazing app I promise you will not regret it!
0470876417|5.0|Easy reading, very illustrated. Many references as possible for each statement. Completely changed my interpretation and way of thinking for business.
B00004W4UB|4.0|Doctor Jeckel and Mr. Hyde seen from a different perspective.  It has it's horror appeal, but Julia Roberts creates Mary into this shy and retiring scullery maid, who's coming is neglected, but put directly to work and who's ending is walking down the street into the fog.  In between is how she copes with Dr. Jeckel and manages her fear and disgust at Mr. Hyde.  John Malkovich has been always such a vercital villen and in this film, he fails us not.
B004RSCWZ2|5.0|Enjoyed every song and never tire. Trucks is the best of his generation! Tedeschi is wonderful. i couldn't believe how terrific it was.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really think this is a great game. I'm pretty sure that it's not free but it as worth the money. I really like how you don't have to use actual money for things in the game.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|One of the best games ever. It is much better than temple run and has zero lag. I love how they change the city often
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a very fun game to play. It gives me lots of challenges and I like alot. I play it all the time.
1846615240|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo2233CGMQKKP6R]]AT A DEPRESSING TIME FOR HOMELESSNESS AND SOCIAL HOUSING ALLOCATION<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />The Localism Act 2011 has substantially altered the landscape somewhat concerning the provision of social housing allocations and the continuing problems of serious homelessness. The authors of this 3rd edition and both barristers at Garden Court Chambers, Jan Luba QC and Liz Davies, have met the challenge magnificently with this new edition of their work and it is a most welcome addition to the chambers library. Do read their `Stop Press' at the beginning of the book which sets out the timetable for the 2011 Act which was written in November 2012.<br /><br />The book now reviews the following statutory responsibilities: the new power to discharge housing duties by offering private rented accommodation; the new two year rule for re-applying for homelessness assistance; the new power to exclude classes of people from allocation schemes; and the new rules affecting tenant transfers in social housing.<br /><br />Luba and Davies say that what drove them to continue with this new edition was the experiences they had from across the country, of continuing interest and enthusiasm among local authority staff, housing association officers, housing lawyers and housing advice workers who want `to do the right thing' where possible- and we have found this to be the case on housing committees and in housing law itself.<br /><br />The point of all this is that these people can ensure that the homeless, and applicants for social housing, may achieve minimum rights which the statutes have given them. The authors say \\"if our writing helps them in that endeavor, in any way, it will have been worth it\\". They have and it does!<br /><br />The authors make one comment about the impact of fewer court decisions than in their previous editions.  They make the point that this downturn (which some welcome because of the huge amount of case law available!) is a consequence of the greatly reduced availability of legal resources now on offer. It is not just a question of settlement of claims but also the diminishing number of specialist lawyers assisting the homeless because of legal aid reductions which has become a fact of life with the deficit reduction policies of the coalition government.<br /><br />As a result the third edition looks at the role of the respective ombudsmen with greater emphasis identifying the lessons which have been learned from their investigations and reports produced.  This could be the road ahead for some years and may well serve the claimants well as courts are so often the final resort, and not (as with some previous governments) the first resort for those seeking help.<br /><br />This is a first class book from Jordans which is reader friendly for those new to the subject and it has a most useful CD ROM to assist for those readers who use discs. There are 4 appendices and the final one is a further stop press on recent developments which practitioners will find most helpful.  The law is as quoted in November 2012.some welcome because of the huge amount of case law available!) is a consequence of the greatly reduced availability of legal resources now on offer.

1451695195|5.0|I heard of this author and some of his story on the news and decided to order the book. It is easy reading and not a thick book. I have shared the 2 copies I bought with friends and relatives who have really enjoyed it. I shared it w/ my priest and he was impressed enough to mention it in the homily.<br />It turns out that this physician/author lived in the next county from me and is a relative of my boyfriend's law partner. Somehow, having a local connection makes this book even more special.<br />This book will certainly make you think as you read his journey through death.
1906076669|5.0|NOW IN A NEW EDITION<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />From extortionately high interest rates on `payday' loans to the demands of certain mortgage lenders, the problems of debt continue apace and therefore the publication of this latest edition of the `Debt Advice Handbook' by the Child Poverty Action Group  is timely.<br /><br />It is aimed primarily at counsellors and advisers, not to mention lawyers, and indeed anyone struggling with making ends meet will find it of immense value.  It's clear, it's logically structured, it's easy to use and it covers just about every kind of debt problem and every kind of solution to said debt problem that you can possibly think of.  As \\"The Times\\" has commented, you can use it as a self-help book too.<br /><br />Interestingly, the statement is made in the introduction that `the Handbook is based on the assumption that debt is caused by lenders who predict it, but lend nonetheless.' This means, we gather, that some lenders overlend and subsequently force the issue when borrowers find themselves in trouble.  It is this category of trouble that takes certain distinct forms and leads to any number of unpleasant effects, from bailiffs, disconnections and repossessions to relationship problems, depression and stress and a lot more.<br /><br />The Debt Advice Handbook therefore provides an absolutely invaluable reservoir of advice which effectively points the way to helping clients either alleviate or eliminate any the main categories of debt problems.<br /><br />The Handbook can be used in at a number of different ways:  as a training aid for the new debt adviser... or as a reference work for non-lawyers who provide debt advice; social workers and housing officers for example.  It is also an excellent first step is sourcing and understanding the relevant primary legislation and regulations -- and is generally ideal for anyone either giving or receiving debt advice services.<br /><br />Starting with the keys skills and stages of debt advice the Handbook methodically, yet succinctly, examines and analyses the full spectrum of issues and outcomes pertaining to debt, from priority and non-priority debts to representation at the county court and magistrates courts, to bailiffs and personal insolvency -- and of course much more.<br /><br />If you or your organisation already has the Handbook in the previous edition, you will need this new one for, its revisions and updates which reflect changes to legislation, case law -- and court practice and procedure.  There is also additional information on the European Consumer Credit Directive, as well as the latest Office of Fair Trading guidance.  And speaking of payday loans (with their astounding APRs of up to 2,356 per cent), there are apparently new codes for these and also for bills of sale.<br /><br />Wide-ranging comprehensive and refreshingly user-friendly, the Debt Advice Handbook should be considered an indispensable weapon in the armory of every debt counsellor. The law covered in this edition is stated as correct on 1 September 2012.ice services.<br /><br />Starting with the keys skills and stages of debt advice the Handbook methodically, yet succinctly, examines and analyses the full spectrum of issues and outcomes pertaining to debt, from priority and non-priority debts to representation at the county court and magistrates courts, to bailiffs and personal insolvency -- and of course much more.<br /><br />If you or your organisation already has the Handbook in the previous edition, you will need this new one for, its revisions and updates which reflect changes to legislation, case law -- and court practice and procedure.

B001ANSSDC|5.0|To say they made a movie out of this book is not really true. They used about 40% of this fantastic book and added about 60% of Hollywood.<br /> But this review isn't for the movie. It's for the book. I have a mental illness like the main characters. Getting a glimpse inside of a mind that is like mine but completely different was refreshing. Pat's attitude and dedication were so inspiring! Anyone who has been on the down side of life can relate to wanting to find your silver lining. This is one man's playbook on how he got there. Amazing story!!

The heroism displayed by  those four as well as the reaction five was inspiring to say the least and brought a year to the eye more than once while reading this book.

0691152640|3.0|The favored approach of narrow-minded, neoclassical economics-inspired historiography resonates with the French adage: plus ça change, plus c'est la même chose.<br /><br />A prime example of this is the critically acclaimed work of Reinhart and Rogoff . It is motivated by a kindred mantra: \\"We have been here before.\\" The study is certainly thoroughly researched and elegantly presented. But this hardly exonerates first-rank scholars from the folly of equating numerous sovereign and banking crises since the early infancy of capitalism, based on a limited number of unhistorical characteristics. (It was not flawed Latin grammar that led to the rejection of Malleus Maleficarum.) Self-feeding speculative episodes ending with spectacular disruption may have always been driven by the prospects of personal aggrandizement, corporate miscalculation, and political survivorship and they may have always been marred by manipulation, gullibility, and inertia in mass behavior, but they have differed essentially in the modality and scope of their impact on the evolving individual as a social component, on constantly transforming national economies and on international economic relations.<br /><br />Accelerating demographic and economic growth has been a relentless novelty producer. Consequently, the world changes beyond the control of mind and will, sweeping along personal lives and reasoned judgment. The cogito is inundated with so much new information that believing that \\"this time is different\\" is par for the course because in so many different ways it really is.<br /><br />\\"This Time is Different\\" conjures up a fictitious gambler who plays the same game for eight centuries. The inebriated idiot is either inflicted by a chronic gambler's fallacy, culminating in sequential Martingale fiascoes (given that output and stakes have grown over time); or he has neglected Bayesian derivations, or again, has been using consistently wrong evidence to update his beliefs.<br /><br />De-emphasizing the multifaceted variance among selected events negates the fundamental dynamism of universal history. Lightning and the computer both feature the laws of electricity (those fickle electrons!) but that is not a sufficient reason to equate them.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really like this app.  Keep a pencil and paper handy to write down the clues. Great for those that like solving puzzles.
