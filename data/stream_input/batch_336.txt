B00006CXSS|5.0|Has anyone else had this experience?<br />I rented &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; (DVD) from Blockbuster.  When I watched it at home, I found no English closed-captioning.<br />Seems like a real shame . . . but then again, it says in the product description that it IS closed-captioned . . . and yet . . . sure didn't see any.<br />I know the version broadcast on HBO had closed-captioning.  I had taped an episode, and I went back and checked it out.  Yup, that one had it.<br />???<br />: )
B0000AI44Q|5.0|I have been following Neil Young for the last 26 years of my life, have every album (disc), and was disappointed once (Trans, refunded the album and then purchased it again a year later after expanding my horizons).  I did not think Neil could ever top his talent, album after album, but he continues to prove he can outdo himself again and again.  Greendale is the best compilation he has ever done, not only musically, but also because it has a &quot;storyline&quot; which tops the Who's &quot;Tommy&quot; and even Pink Floyd's &quot;The Wall&quot;.  Of course, I went to his recent concert at Red Rocks in Denver, CO on July 29th, and he had his &quot;players&quot; dancing and acting out the music as he played the entire album (then he played ten more older songs).  I was awestruck to say the least.  Having seen the Greendale tour was obviously a lifetime experience alone.  Then the album was released on August 19th.  As of this writing (8/27/03), I have not removed the CD from my player.  When I hear the album, I &quot;see&quot; the concert.  As likened to &quot;The Wall&quot;, you listen and experience more every time you listen to it, yet Neil Young really puts a lot of commitment, energy, and style into this in a way that nobody else ever could.  I have close to 500 CD's and have seen most everybody from AC/DC to ZZ Top.  This CD and concert is/was the best of everything I have ever experienced, hands down.  Neil Young &amp; Red Rocks rules - I cannot wait for the video!  Hint, Hint!
B000002V07|5.0|Since 1993 when I first heard &quot;Fade Into You&quot; I was floored.  This CD is a True Masterpiece and one for a lover of beautiful haunting ballads.<br />Without a doubt, you will own this and it will grow on you and become a Record to which all others will be compared.<br />Simply put, OUTSTANDING!

B00009TB5G|3.0|Some of Carl's points are well taken.  The entire book can not possibly be captured in a 3 hour movie, nor will people want to sit through 15 hours of film. However, this story offers so much to choose from without deviation from the original storyline, that there is no reason to fabricate events that never happened in the book.  <br />- Why must Aragorn fall off a cliff in a battle that he was never actually in? <BR>- Why was Faramir's decision changed from allowing Frodo to pursue his quest, to taking him to Gondor? <BR>- Why did they make Frodo face the Nazgul and offer him the ring in Gondor, if he was never supposed to be there in the first place?  <BR>- Why did they change Faramir's personality to match his brother's when the whole point was the differences in their decisions? Boromir tries to take the ring while Faramir chooses to release it.<br />Need I go on?  I'm not saying that this was a bad movie or a failure, BUT it could have been much better if they followed the original story line within the time constraints. Rewriting parts of the story is unnecessary when you have such a wealth to events choose from.
B00005JLTN|2.0|DISAPOINTING - a single word to describe this movie.  I was one of the first to see it and was denied the touted best movie sequal of all time.  Neo fight scene I feel could have been done better by the makers of southpark, cheap computer graphics that were so obvious it was a slap in the face.  The love making scene was so lame it was laughable.  Not to mention all the mistakes - I thought they took out all the plugs save for the brain ones...no no no they are back.  <BR>this was over all a horid bomb and will only hope they spend more time on the third.  Watch it only for the progression to the third.
B00008US8R|5.0|I think that this is an awesome album.  Eventhough that the CD seems short, it keeps you wanting for more.  I think that the balance of songs, and even the order of songs makes each one noticeable and unique to each other.  It's got some good orchestration and great punk/pop melodies/rythms.  I'm a fan of many types of music (The Cd that I just bought, which was right after this, is the Pirates of the Caribbean Soundtrack-it's a short'er' one too).  All In All, this is a pick-me-upper.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|Finally a new Neil album, and a brilliant one at that.  I was actually fortunate enough to see the material on Greendale performed live in July and let me tell you I was no disappointed to say the least.  I could not wait for the album to come out.  Neils new material is very different from any of his other recordings because most of the songs include the same group of characters, that you don't get bored hearing about over and over.  Greendale tells the story of the Green family who live in Greendale, California.  If the narrative was a complex portrait of a family (a grandfather who clings to forgotten virtues, a disaffected uncle who lives in a houseboat, and idealistic teen daughter and her cop killer cousin) hounded by the media and the FBI against the backdrop of an impending ecological catastrophe, the music was built on three-chord structures and lilting choruses.  And if the cd is not enough you get the amazing acoustic versions of all the songs on dvd from when Neil performed them, solo, in Ireland.  Something for all those unplugged junkies.  I highly recommend this to not anyone but everyone.
B00003CXB2|5.0|This is a great film and one of my very favorite movies.  I love everything about it.  The exquisite length and pacing of this film can only work when the dialogue, acting, and pictures support it.  Here the movie is packed with everything wonderful from the first sound of the tympani to the credits.<br />My father always felt that Peter O'Toole was cheated when the best actor Oscar went to Gregory Peck for \\"To Kill a Mocking Bird\\" and I have always agreed with that view.  Nothing against Mr. Peck, but O'Toole gave a spectacular performance that has not lost its power over time.<br />While I am not a film scholar, I have always found David Lean a compelling story teller with his images as well as the dialogue.  Here, the images are so beautiful, powerful, and vast that they never leave the memory.  They become part of our visual language.  Who doesn't get thirsty when the Nefud is being crossed?  Whose heart is touched when Lawrence comes out of the Sinai into the officers club with the boy?  Who doesn't feel a mix of blood lust and revulsion in the battle scenes - especially at the train and the slaughter of the Turks on the way to Damascus?<br />The extras on the making of the movie and the reprint of the original theatrical program (though in a much smaller size) are quite good and valuable.  It is hard for me to get my kids to understand that we used to get dressed up to go to movies and they did sell program which people bought, read, and KEPT.  Different times ...<br />Yes, the events in which Lawrence played a part were a sideshow of a sideshow of the Great War, but they certainly get their monument in this great film.
0316666343|4.0|I found the author's view of heaven fascinating. From a Christian stand point it is totally off base, but read as pure fiction it was captivating. I had to watch this family try to put their life back together after the death of their daughter/sister. Equally difficult was watching the daughter try to let go of her family. All in all, a very good read.
B000056H24|3.0|In our time of fast cuts, limited character development, and two-word dialogue, this movie could not be made.  It is visually beautiful and is a bit like watching moving paintings rather than moving pictures.  I find the slow pace more exquisite and beautiful than long and boring.  There are things that should be experienced in long phrases and bathed in time rather than crushed in a time compactor.  The story of the life of Christ seems the most appropriate for this treatment.<br />I do find the huge vistas in the west rather strange because I have seen a great deal of footage from the Holy Land.  Yes, this movie could not have been made in the historical setting, but the huge and coursing River Jordan in this movie is awfully different than the more-creek-than-River Jordan.  But, setting the setting aside as dramatic license, I do find Max von Sydow's performance beautiful.<br />What is most interesting about this movie is that none of the action seems life-like, but it all seems so appropriate and right for the story it is telling.  As I said, think of moving paintings and you will get a better idea of what to expect when you see this film.<br />Is it a great film?  I think there are films about Jesus that are more appealing to me.  But as von Sydow points out in one of the extras on the making of the movie, everyone has their own view of where Christ fits in and it is impossible to make a film that won't disagree with someone's settled view.  I think this is a very good film that holds up well for what it intended to be.  For my taste, by showing the miracles it clearly shows the miraculous nature of Jesus, but it doesn't seem to come down firmly enough on his Divinity.  It seems to want to have it both ways, the final Christ in the Clouds notwithstanding.  But that is my view.<br />One of the criticisms of the film in its time was that the many cameos by famous stars were distracting.  In the documentary Stevens is quoted as saying that the day would come when no one would know the stars in those cameos and would just see the film.  My children are that generation.  I have to tell them who all these stars were.  But they have a hard time with the pace of the film because they are used to much quicker cuts and a different kind of film language.  I encourage them to just sit back and bathe in the beauty of the images and listen to the language and the spaces between the words as music.<br />In my view, it is a film very much worth watching and there is much that is masterful in this film, but I think it falls somewhat short of being a truly great film although Sydow gives a great performance as Jesus.en no one would know the stars in those cameos and would just see the film.

0783232039|5.0|As a child who was terrified of Chucky throughout the late 80's/early 90's and who grew to love him and the 'Child's Play' movies, I was pumped when I first went to see this in theaters almost five years ago. It was everything a movie of it's nature should be: Entertaining, shocking, gorey, and of course, funny. The special effects were excellent and Jennifer Tilly and Brad Dourif played perfectly off each other as the doll version of Bonnie & Clyde. Today, all of that still holds up. No matter how many times I watch it, I am still enthusiastic about it and it is never dull. 'Bride of Chucky' begins with Chucky's remains (basically a trash-bag full of chopped up Chucky parts, calling back to part 3) being stolen from a police evidence locker. Chucky's old flame (when he was flesh & blood, mind you) Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) resurrects him and a series of events leads to her soul becoming trapped in a doll as well. The duo hitch a ride to New Jersey, to dig up Chucky's body which contains a special jewel that will allow them to transfer their souls into any other human (yeah, it's a stretch). They are led by  unsuspecting newlywed couple Jade & Jesse (played by Katherine Heigl & Nick Stabile). As the body counts rises and the couple unknowingly leaves a trail of blood behind them, they are framed for the crimes and suddenly find themselves outlaws on the run. John Ritter has a minor role as Jade's verbally abusive uncle, whose body takes much abuse throughout the course of the movie (just a small bit of the black humor). 'Bride of Chucky' of course isn't meant to be taken seriously. It is fully aware of itself (\\"It's a long story - in fact, if it were a movie it would take 3 or 4 sequels just to do it justice\\") and the deaths are horribly hilarious at times. If you liked Chucky's little one-liners that were sprinkled throughout the previous movies, you'll definitely get your kicks out of this movie. For the first time, Chucky is the center of the movie. The Andy saga has been pushed aside, and although I would like to see the character return in a future sequel, it's nice they took a break and focused more on our anti-hero. The movie is masterfully directed by Hong-Kong filmmaker Ronny Yu (Formula 51, Freddy Vs. Jason). He brings a unique style and flavor to not only the movie, but the entire series. His is, hands down, the best looking installment so far. Backed up by a meaty heavy-metal soundtrack (White Zombie, Slayer among others) this is one movie that Chucky fans and horror fans alike can all enjoy. Universal is pretty generous when it comes to extra material on DVD's and this is no exception. The DVD contains two commentaries: The first done by director Ronny Yu, and the second done by Chucky creator & writer of all 4 movies, Don Mancini and stars Brad Dourif and Jennifer Tilly. There is quite a bit of unexposed information in these commentaries, they are definitely worth listening to. We also get a \\"Spotlight: On Location\\" featurette which is basically a montage of interviews. Standard production notes & theatrical trailer are included, along with \\"Jennifer Tilly's Diary,\\" which basically tells her story of how she came to be involved with the movie and how it was made and \\"the History of Chucky\\" which recalls Chucky's previous activities up until now.has been pushed aside, and although I would like to see the character return in a future sequel, it's nice they took a break and focused more on our anti-hero.

B0000942HV|3.0|Well it is very hard to judge TB 2003. I must say after comparing TB from 1973 with a new version that i prefer Older one. Why? it was spontanic. It was romantic, Melancholic and full of heart. Mike was using only few guitars (for those who do not know it was Fender telecaster, Fender precision bass and one acoustic and classical guitar) and not so many instruments as you may though. Mandolins and some of other sounds were created using Electric guitar mixed and changed in studio to sound like, let's say, bagpipes. In 1973 mike was not a superstar and a well known genius player. He was just lucky guy with a huge talent who had an opportunity to record in a professional Studio his own ideas and melodies. It was all very spontanic...In seventies his music was full of passion and very personal (&quot;ommadawn&quot;, &quot;Hergest ridge&quot;), while when he joined more mainstream style of music (&quot;Moonlight shadow&quot;) he became a superstar with a lot of money, but with no really original concepts for his new records. yes i agree, &quot;Five miles out&quot; or &quot;Islands&quot; are a brilliant works too, but looking back to seventies it was nothing compared to emotional bombs that &quot;Ommadawn&quot; and other albums were. The music slowly was loosing it's soul. With &quot;Amarok&quot; he proved that he can still compose such a genius music like TB, but later he mostly made mechanic (in real sense - all of his new works were made with computers and synths) works and he lost many of his splendor and talet that he had before.<br />I am afraid about Mike's.future &quot;guitars&quot; and &quot;millenium bell&quot; were simply some wierd mistakes and they contained only a small shadow of some of his older works. Ok, even compare it to &quot;songs of thr Distant earth&quot; (his best from new period) and see how piontless he had gone. &quot;tres lunas&quot; was not his real studio album. It contained a music to a computer game - to computer game it was originaly composed, and in a computer game it sounds the best. those cyberspace stuff just don't work now.<br />TB 2003 is Very good album.Very good! But only if you forgot that he recorded the same thirty years ago.<BR>i felt satisfied when i heard the BASS along with main piano motive in first miute.in 1973 it sounded thiny and quiet, now it blows of your subwoofer. the sound is crystal clear and without any noises. But with those changes, the magic of original Tubular bells had vanished. In some parts you could heard Mike's fingers sliding on his guitar, now it is all so crystal-clear perfect, without any sound flaws.<BR>I heard that he is planing to Re-record &quot;OMMADAWN&quot; and &quot;HErgest ridge. for music - 4 STARS<BR>for idea - 2 STARS<br />for all - 3,5 STARS...
B00003CXRM|3.0|If it wasn't for George Clooney, I probably would not have watched this film.  This film I'm sure was well intended.  However, since my family and myself in part came out of Kentucky and some thereabouts, I found this film depressing.  I do understand the comedy they are making in the film.  But, this film is also real and was real.  Depends on where you lived and how you lived.  The music is fine.  That is what country music used to be.  DVD contains the music video performed by Soggy Bottom Boys, \\"I Am A Man Of Constant Sorrow\\", an 8-minute featurette on the production, and another 9-minute featurette \\"Painting With Pixels\\" on getting that old, dusty Kentucky look, the digital way.
B00003CXXP|1.0|My husband and I use this film to rate all others ... &quot;At least it was better than AI&quot;.  This movie is a waste of time and money. The plot is tedious at best.  The roles are not played convincingly, I did not care for any of the main characters, in fact at times in the movie I was hoping for their demise - just to end the pain.  We hung in until the end just in case there was a payoff, unfortunately, we found none.  Jude Law's role was a nice injection of humor but that was over much too soon.  <br />I expected more from Spielberg, but I guess everyone has their bad days.
B00009APK1|5.0|&quot;Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers&quot; is the second edition to this trilogy.  This action packed movie is one of few that lives up to the original.  The action isn't the only detail that attracts audiences.  So do the special effects and most important...the genius storyline.  Drama and elaborate scenes combine surely pleasing J.R.R. Tolkin, the book author.<br />Peter Jackson, the director, the producer, and the writer, proudly presents his sweat and tears.  He's worked nonstop since 1999 perfecting every detail.  He leads the crew to make a seamingly impossible task look easy when actually, it's one of history's hardest movie creations.  The set and the buildings look real, but the construction took almost a year to complete with just &quot;The Two Towers&quot;.<br />Every actor performs every drop of heart and soul as did Peter Jackson in his duties.  Elijah Wood proves as Frodo Biggings that he'll perfect more demanding roles in the years coming.  Other Oscar worthy performances are noted by Ian McKellan, Viggo Mortensen, Sean Astin, Andy Serkis, Orlando Bloom, and others.  They give their characters the necessary emotions for the audience to feel in their hearts.  <br />Those interested in this movie are advised to watch &quot;Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; first.  Otherwise, one will be clueless to many scenes.  This is the continuation of the journey to destroy the ring before it takes over the world; therefore, creating widespread evil.  &quot;The Two Towers&quot; keeps the audience's eyes wide open waiting for the next intense action scene. <br />Afterward, watch the special features.  It includes a sneak preview of the next trilogy chapter, &quot;Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot; with a behind-the-scenes look.  Sean Astin's short film feature is viewing worthy.  It stars four &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; crew members including the legendary Peter Jackson.  The WB-special originally aired on November 2002 informshow &quot;The Two Towers&quot; was made.  All other features are worth watching.  The ensemble will not leave the audience disappointed....<br />It'll be.......their precious.
B00005QZ7U|2.0|I'm very unhappy with this movie.  It had a lot of potential but listening to classic songs re-done poorly and jumbled together was absolutely painful.  The singing and acting were fine - not stellar but fine. I am more disappointed in the fact that I had to hear many of my favorite songs from the 70's and 80's completely butchered.  What happened to the days when musicals had original music and lyrics?
B00005O5CM|5.0|Each time I watch this movie, I think, &quot;This is what would have happened if 'Cher' from 'Clueless' went to college.&quot; Reese Witherspoon is engaging and adorable. It's a really funny film. I enjoyed it immensely. I could watch it again and again. I love that the DVD offers both widescreen and standard views.
B0000A4GAK|5.0|The fourth installment from The Derek Trucks Band, Soul Serenade, which was apparently recorded before 2002's Joyful Noise, works as fine a follow-up as I can imagine.  While Soul may rock less than Noise, its eclectic fusing of jazz, rock, Indian, blues, and even folk amalgamate to beautiful results.  <br />These recordings-all-instrumental, save for Track 3, sung by Gregg Allman who's in fine form-are sophisticated compositions that have a discernible melodic structure-sometimes lacking from \\"jam bands.\\"  But to merely call TDTB a jam band would be doing them a disservice.  The jams are never self-indulgent; they have direction and balance.  The musicians have such a tight synergy between them that it appears they've been playing together for a decade or two.  The tunes are at times jazzy: (\\"Bock To Bock\\"), funky: (\\"Soul Serenade/Rasta Man Chant\\"), bluesy: (\\"Drown In My Own Tears\\"), and ethereal: (\\"Oriental Folk Song\\" &amp; \\"Sierra Leone\\").  Despite sounding like a mere rambling of music styles, the songs on the disc actually coalesce into a natural togetherness-creating a unified vibe.         <br />The key word for this band is taste.  They tastefully employ the use of flute (a rather audacious choice that works so well), played by the widely talented Kofi Burbridge.  They tastefully keep their tunes to a reasonable length, never overplaying as far as I'm concerned.  Even the packaging and liner notes (though a bit laconic) show good taste. <br />Like all great art, and I do believe this album exemplifies great art, Soul Serenade is truly original.  But if I had to liken it to something, I'd compare them to Traffic (at their zenith), of course The Allman Brother's Band, and Wes Montgomery (the late jazz guitarist).  And because it's great art, it's absolutely NOT for everyone.  There are no \\"pop hooks\\" (I loathe that phrase) or riff based songs.  There's no maudlin display of musicianship or image.  There are simply forty or so minutes (I wish there was more) ofgreat music.  <br />The last thing I'll say is about Trucks himself.  The CD includes a bonus interview where D.T. offers up his own take on his music.  After watching this, I felt a tremendous respect for him; he is articulate, humble, and wise beyond his years.  It's nice to know there are some artists who know not only what they're doing, but also why they're doing it.
0446691437|1.0|Sorry, I did not get a thing out of this book, except that the author has struggled a lot and has a fairly negative attitude. He also believes in muses. (Guess if you don't feel on top of it, it's comforting to know there are muses out there.) Okay, maybe you believe in muses too. (If you do, you might like this book.) My good friend, whose opinion I value greatly, recommended it. He loved it. I didn't. We debate.  I have better things to do with my time than read stories about how the author failed so many times before he reached a modicum of success, and then became a philosopher. So why do I take the time to write this review? Because I think you might spend your time better elsewhere. It's a small contribution; but, nonetheless, a contribution.

From my perspective, he did a wonderful job of portraying what it might be like to be an individual with autism, giving concrete examples (like the inability to read the facial expressions and emotions of others) and other insights.<br />I've recommended this book to parents and fellow educators as well as friends as an extremely readable foray into the world of autism.

0385504209|5.0|I have read many great books before, but I never had any concept of what a &quot;page-turner&quot; really was before I read &quot;The DaVinci Code.&quot;  The first night, I started reading and the next time I looked up, it was 2 a.m. and I had read about 150 pages. The simple fact that it is a good thriller makes it hard to put down.  However, the most enthralling aspect of this book is the simultaneous presentation of some mind-blowing revelations about the roots of Christianity and Christian symbolism.  Not only do you keep reading to find out what happens to the characters, but you also do so to find out the next little historical detail that Brown repeatedly dangles in front of your nose.  The only thing I didn't like about this book was the dubious nature of some of the &quot;revelations&quot; that are presented.  I am generally skeptical about symbology to begin with (anyone can attach any meaning they wish to a symbol or painting, or even a work of literature, if the person who made it is dead), and this book didn't do anything to lessen my skepticism.  All in all, a very enjoyable book, particularly for someone with an open mind and a good knowledge of traditional Christian beliefs.
B00005JCA9|4.0|I am not a Julia Roberts fan.  I don't think she is a great actress, and I don't find her particularly attractive.  I usually don't like her movies because I don't think she is effective.   &quot;The Pelican Brief&quot; and &quot;My Best Friend's Wedding&quot; would have been much better without Julia as the lead actress.<br />However, she is great here, even if it is Hugh Grant who makes the movie go.  This movie is smart, romantic, and quite touching.  Grant is the owner of a small travel bookstore who meets Roberts (playing a movie icon) when she comes in to shop.  Throughout the movie, they hook up, and split up a couple of times, mostly on Julia's whims.<br />What makes the movie, is the characters.  Roberts is not as shallow and transparent as usual.  Grant is funny, especially since the movie is shot in his native England.  The various British accents make the movie lots of fun to see.  Rhys Ifans as the slovenly roommate of Grant is a hoot and steals each scene he's in.  I also loved Grant's sister, and the birthday party scene where Grant shows up with Roberts is a classic.<br />The plot is no surprise, but the characters and the dialogue make this a great movie to watch.  If you are a fan of Julia's, you must see this.  If not, the other characters in the film should help, especially since they are relative unknowns and I found that to be refreshing.
B00005R1N3|5.0|This is one of those movies that I remembered from a sneaky late night, parents are asleep, stay up past bedtime, then regret that for the next month when you jump every time the phone rings.  I had always remembered that this was a terrifying film but did not remember the title,  so was very happy when I finally redicovered it.  Although we have seen many imitators of this little canadian film it still holds its own.  Set in a partially deserted sorority house right before christmass the film moves smoothly from one scene of suspense, a person POSSIBLY sneaking into the house, to relaxing scenes of the girls leaving for winter vacation.  This in turn is the reason why, as some girls are getting attacked their dissappearences are not noticed.  The director manages to keep suspense at nail-biting tension.  The psycho is not seen, as in Nightmare on Elm Street, where Freddy became more of a Shekky Green spouting one liners, nor as in Hallowwen where Michael Myers became an unkillable otherwordly demon.  This person is human, and all the more frightening for that reason.  AS the movie builds towards the climax with the still unsuspecting, last women in the house, you get to hear the famous line, probably the first time it was ever used in a teen horror movie.......The CAlls are coming from INSIDE THE HOUSE!  This is the origional, before these movies became targets for camp or self paradies.  Watch it with the lights on!<br />I very much recomend this movie, it's been imitated but this really is one of the best.
B00005JKZV|5.0|This is the second of three releases under the title, Lord of the Rings.  Make sure when purchasing that you choose the widescreen version of the film as there is no real difference in the packaging.  It says accross the top which version you are purchasing, make sure you have what you want. (widescreen)  This is one film that is horrid if not seen in it's original intended format.<br />I want to make this informative without giving away any plot points.  The special features are excellent with a bonus short film by Sean Astin (Samwise).  Several making of's and featuretts.  The best feature is a 10 minute preview of the third installment, Return of the King.  Due out in December in a theatre near you.<br />This is not the version with the 43 minutes of additional footage, that will be coming out later in a four disc set.  If you have read the books, you must see the film.  If you have seen the film, you must read the books.  There is nothing small about this movie or this series.  It is simply gigantic.  I highly recommend this DVD purchase, in widescreen)...
B000002LRX|5.0|all I have to say is WOW!!!! What a great album! I bought them on an instinct, never been into the rap/metal stuff, but FNM are much more than that! Last year I saw Tool with their opening act Tomahawk, which is Mike's new band. They were awesome, and I immediatelty bought the Tomahawk album and got into his singing style. It is so original. I did more research and found out he did FNM, Mr. Bungle, and Fantomas. Angel Dust is just great, all the songs are good, none disapoint. My favorite is Small Victory. I am always jamming to it! So if you want some good music, check out FNM, and the other bands I have mentioned.
B000001E7V|4.0|Coming out of collaboration with Massive Attack, Tricky was clearly bursting with ideas of his own. On Maxinquaye he sticks to a trip-hop bluieprint, ironically nicking Karma Coma's lyrics for the brooding 'Overcomes' and even sampling Portishead's 'Glory Box' - one of the classic triphop songs - on 'Hell Is Round The Corner'. Yet he infuses the sound with a dark, understated urban menace and with singer Martina Topley-Bird he creates sweltering, sexy grooves that sometimes, as on 'Abbaon Fat Tracks', descend into pure erotica. She has a sultry, alternative voice which complements his laidback rapping style very well, both of them sounding very British. Its an intriguing combination though its a shame that he doesnt take the mic and go solo more often. His only real freestyle rap comes on the almost old-skool hip-hop of 'Brand New You're Retro'.<br />Occasionally as on 'Strugglin' they wander astray without a tune and it makes for a somewhat routine track, acceptable as a 2-minute filler but unbearable stretched into 6 and 1/2 minutes. Yet there's more than enough to make up for it: the masterpiece of paraonoia that is an inspired cover of 'Black Steel', Topley-Bird's voice awash in aggressive guitars and gritty production. Her voice is an acquired taste, especially on tracks like 'Ponderosa' where her sound is totally Estuary, but its nicely broken up by the lush 'Pumpkin' which takes the ingenious tactic of marrying a Massive Attack-style backing track to Orbital (and, after this album, Goldfrapp) vocalist Alison Goldfrapp and a brooding Smashing Pumpkins sample. Also, when the tracks are as good as 'You Don't' which is reggae-tinged and almost like the Horace Andy tracks on 'Blue Lines' its churlish to complain.<br />Ultimately, Maxinquaye is not only a trip-hop masterpiece but an urban classic. Highly reccomended to fans of not just triphop but those new to the genre or mainstream hip-hop fans.
0553814826|4.0|I recently realized how much my super-negative parents were affecting me.  I bought this book and it made me feel a lot better.  First, the author describes the different types of abusive parents.  Just seeing actions that my parents did on that list validated my feelings.  Also, she describes how to heal.  There are various exercises you can do, so you should definitely buy this book.  Some of the chapters weren't applicable, but anyone who feels they had even &quot;just&quot; Emotionally Toxic Parents can benefit from it.
B0000028RR|5.0|I'm the late arrival on the reviewing scene for this album aint i? anyway, its 2003, nearly ten years after Rage made their debut, after breaking up in 2000 (how we miss them)and their mark will take a while to fade, and damn right too. NO-ONE has ever made a sound like Rage, the way point between nu-metal and respectable ol' rock, with amazing guitar work, drumming, rap, and meaning. Zack speaks out with feeling over political views in his songs, they have feeling, meaning, and everyone of them is like a story. This album rocks the boat the the best way possible way, so listen up mush, listen good, and let Rage's message get to you, because its an important one.
B000002JSJ|5.0|I was online and i downloaded Achilles last stand and i think  its one of the best songs  ever. So i wanted the album. I bought it and discovered that tea for one is so lovely and sad and has a great beat and then there is nobodys fault but mine which is a wonderful song. As for the rest i feel they are all amazing songs. But my favorites would be the three i mentioned above!!! LED ZEPPELIN RULES
B000000993|5.0|here we have an awesome effort from an awesoem band, the drums the guitar the bass and the vocals all work together in a very heavy and hard harmony. maynard is a lyrical master mind and the best vocalist i have ever had the privilege of listening to, this is an awesome album a real picker upper, if you aren't a truely devoted tool fan try listening to songs like prison sex, sober, the swamp song, and bottom those most of the not truely devoted tool fans would enjoy and if you like those try out the rest of the album
B00005JKZV|5.0|Wow!   This is the only expression that can escape my lips as I stare awestruck at the ending credits...<br />   See, I didn't have the opportunity to watch this in the theaters, but knowing how great \\"Fellowship\\" was, I couldn't wait to see this DVD.  A couple points to highlight here...<br />1)It's an absolute work of art!  Every scene has the perfect amount of lighting and color, and the locations should all grace the front of postcards.  Just watching the likes of Frodo, Aragorn, Pippen, etc. in these fantastic places will make you feel as if you're there with them, enjoying some sites, and dreading others.  Amazing!<br />2)The acting is simply phenomenal!  Every word spoken and every implied gesture shows the dedication the entire cast had in the making of this epic.  The passion in the voice, actions, and eyes found in every actor, in every scene, cannot be found at this level in even many \\"high profile\\" films.  Outstanding!<br />3)Music to the world's ears!  The music is exceptional in every scene.  Music can make or break even the greatest of movies, but every piece here is made exclusively to portray just the right emotion for each scene.  It never overpowers, but perfectly compliments the performance of the actors and visual effects team.  Beautiful!<br />4)Special effects make the heart grow fonder!  Well, they do in this case.  An incredible amount of time has been spent on the likes of Gollum, the orcs and masses of creatures and characters, random spell and lighting effects, and the color scheming of each and every frame of this movie.  The effects become a part of the world, and never overshadow the world they are in.  Superb!<br />5)Little things mean a lot!  All of the other details, such as direction, staging, camera angles, choreography(wait until you see the awesome action sequences, along with my boy Legolas in action!), costumes, miniatures, etc.  Making a book trilogy as legend as Lord of the Rings into these epic films is a project not to betaken lightly.  The books are of such a grandiose scale that not every minute detail could make it onto the screen.  Picking and choosing the direction and flow of the sequences, as well as the sequences themselves, in such a way as to do service to this epic is a daunting task indeed.  The success of this film, along with it's predecesor(and I'm sure \\"Return of the Kings\\" as well...we'll soon see!), could only happen with a massive group effort and incredible dedication to this project.  The long hours and effort really shows!  The end result is a cherished film adaptation that all can enjoy.  Note that these films serve to compliment the masterful work of Mr. Tolkien, and not to replace his epic. So enjoy the visual greatness of the films, and enjoy the minute details of the books in this complimentary fashion.  From all perspectives, this is a tale that will invite your very heart to a warm place that you'll want to venture again and again.<br />   As for the DVD, yes the extended version will be the cream of the crop, as was the case last year with \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\"'s extended version.  If you just want to get your fix before the November release date, then renting this version until that time may suffice.  I have an ownership problem(I hate renting), so like last year, I'm getting both versions.  This is just my complex though; if you do consider getting one version of this movie, get the extended version.  If you don't want to wait, then sure...get this theatrical version.  In any case, at least rent it...you will not be disappointed.  So go ahead, experience for yourself this masterpiece of \\"wow\\"!
B00005B36H|5.0|ok here we have the latest from the greatest badn ever maynard has the same great voice danny carrey is still pounding those war drums and yes adam jones and jason chancellor are still bringing the whole experience together. this is one of the best from a great band pick it up if you like to jam out
B00009P1O0|5.0|I am not a die-hard Neil Young fan, but thought this recording had the level of outrage most Americans, especially young Americans, feel about our country's domestic environmental and human rights policies. It's also damned fine music, beautifully remastered. MOJO Magazine rated this album five stars, and since I'm skeptical about such things, I bought it.  It IS worth five stars -- especially for the bluesey cuts # 3, 5 and 8. They are absolutely classic, accessible, well performed and remastered.
B00000099Y|5.0|ok ok let me think here what to say about aenima well its totally awesome there are alot fo dark tones to this album but this being a tool effort they pulled it off. honestly maynard james keenan has to be one if not the best vocalist that ive ever heard. throw that in with the guitar of adam jones the bass palying of jason chancellor and of course the punding of the war drums by danny carrey and uyou have one of the best albums ever
B00003CXBK|5.0|Mayazaki reached the pinnacle of his art in SPIRITED AWAY, but this film was the prophesy.  This is not a film for apolitical people, nor is it a movie for those who prefer their films to be wrapped neatly and tucked thematically.  The destruction of the earth is not a poetic vision, but a fact. Mayazake understands the fact of worldwide environmenal dissolution by the responsiblke manner in which he addresses the issue.<br />This is his first truly beautiful film, one in which the landscape and characters possess immediacy and plausibility. The musical score is sensational and the voice-dubs work more effectively than I imagined. This is a movie about the destruction of the world -- viewed through the eyes of liberals and conservatives.  The concludion of the film will haunt you and make you suspicious of partisan formulas for interpreting life-saving issues. Very fine and more than worth double its price.
B00002SWEM|3.0|What exactly was on Wim Wenders' mind, I wonder, when he was shooting this movie? Was he trying to make a concert film? A documentary on forgotten Cuban musicians? A travelogue of Havana locales? Well, \\"Buena Vista Social Club\\" is all those movies wrapped in one, but only one problem--it's not long enough to carry them all. Maybe it was meant as an introduction to the music, so that if you liked it, you could seek it out on your own. Either way, it's really unfortunate that there isn't a single complete song anywhere in the movie, and sequences like the one with Ry Cooder and his son riding through Havana on a motorcycle cannot serve any purpose.<BR>Another bone to pick--most DVDs these days come with hours upon hours of extras, usually useless crap scraped off the editing room floor. One would think, then, that the producers of this DVD would try to fill in the gaps and put in the complete concert and studio performances that were captured. More likely, they'll wait a while, then try to push a 2-DVD set, then a 3-DVD remastered collector's edition, then a 4-DVD...<br />On second though, just buy the CDs. All the music is there.
B00003CXAR|4.0|In an age where everyone and their mother knows the basic plotline of JAWS and has seen this classic at least half a dozen times, I was very disappointed when I picked up this Collector's Edition to discover that half of the supplemental documentary was excised. These days, seeing 2-disc special editions is a norm, but back in 1998, more than one disc in a package was unheard of. So in order to be able to cram the entire movie, trailers and the documentary onto one single disc, the phenomenal 2-hour making-of documentary (directed by Laurent Bouzereau) that was produced for the JAWS: SIGNATURE COLLECTION Laserdisc in 1995 was condensed to a 50-minute \\"featurette.\\" I really, really hope Universal takes heed to the cries of foul from the fans and re-releases this title one day as a 2-disc set, restoring many wonderful recollections that were cut out of the DVD's documentary (including Roy Scheider's recollection of the infamous night the entire cast and crew had a massive food fight and then all jumped into a resort pool to wash themselves off). Luckily, I still have my original laserdisc set and can see this documentary in all of its nostalgic glory. I'm very surprised Spielberg let them cut that much out, but being released in 1998, it was still the birth of DVD and thus forgiveness can be bestowed. This is why I give four stars out of five...four stars for the film masterpiece, zero stars for the extras. Universal, please give us fans what we want! Restore your original grand homage to one of the great contemporary cinematic classics!
B0000024JA|2.0|Method Man is the most immediately striking of the Wu-Tang personalities.  The track named after him on \\"Enter the Wu-Tang\\" is one of the best tracks on that album.  But the '94 release \\"Tical\\" leaves a lot to be desired.  For starters, it's as if RZA was saving his better beats up for Raekwon's \\"Only Built 4 Cuban Linx\\" and GZA's \\"Liquid Swords\\".  Meth's lyrics are just plain tiring on \\"Tical\\" with notable exceptions (\\"Bring the Pain\\" is dope lyrically but doesn't really make the head nod).<br />Tical does have that irresistable early Wu-Tang rawness that you would expect, but do NOT expect Cuban Linx, Liquid Swords, or even Return to the 36 quality.  It's a shame, because those 3 Wu solo albums and Enter the 36 each owe their greatness partially to Meth.  Here's why though:  Meth is a punchline emcee.  He can't write stories like Rae, INS, ODB, GZA, or GFK, but he's got a sharp wit and a smooth delivery, which makes him a great chorus man (\\"Cream\\", \\"Ice Cream\\", \\"Raw Hide\\"), but an album that stars Meth alone just doesn't hold water.<br />That said, the nicest songs on this album are the collabs with other Wu emcees (\\"Meth Vs. Chef\\", \\"Mr. Sandman\\").  RZA, Raekwon, etc hold it down and Meth complements them perfectly.  But Meth alone to me is kind of like ketchup with no french fries.
B00003CX8U|5.0|Lock up those little guys and gals that wanna be a star, Momma...this one is back!  One of the most dark, wonderful films I had ever seen is finally back in print (leave it to the teeming hordes of &quot;Chicago&quot; fans who are snatching up anything Fosse to bring some distributor to his senses!) and just as thought-provoking as when I first saw it (about 20 times!) in 1979.<br />Roy Schneider is terrific as Fosse (whoops, make that Joe Gideon) who destroys every personal relationship in his life for his art...it's all about the play, the musical, the number, never about his wise ex-wife (guess who-should we say Gwen??), his knockout girlfriend (played with ultimate knowledge by the Master's actual girlie at the time), nor his daughter (sassy and cute - the Peter Allen number with her and Katie is one of the highlights of the film).  That this is autobiographical goes without saying, when Bob died of a heart attack in the 1980s, he was walking back to his apartment with Gwen.  <br />The biggest kick for me was to see characterizations of folks I knew in the business and how it is truly a business - the meeting with the insurance guys while Gideon undergoes (graphic) open-heart surgery should knock any romantic ideas of &quot;The Great White Way&quot; right outta your head.<br />And &quot;Take Off With Us&quot;...is there a more seductive, erotic piece of film ever shot???  Simply superb, simply tremendous, simply...Fosse!
0140277447|5.0|This book was also assigned for a 20th century history class in college. It really broadens your prespective on what still remains a mystery or still swepped under the rug about WWII. In high school all you heard about was the suffering of the Jews on the western battle fields but never what was going on in the east. The rape of nanking really opens your eyes, showing you how much damage was caused in so little time. Even if you find it hard to believe, the pictures in the middle of the text speak for themselves.
0316666343|5.0|Wow!  What a spectacular read!  I usually take several weeks - months to get a book read, but this one I could not put down.  I read it in 3 days and what an emotional rollercoaster.  Like so many others, I thought \\"what an awful premise to a book\\".  Having 2 young girls myself, I felt the subject of the rape and murder of a young girl to be too dark and depressing.  This book was anything but that.  It tugs at all of your emotions and can bring tears of joy as well as sadness to your eyes.  There is nothing better than a novel that can really get to you deep inside, and this one does that and then some.
B00005J9ZB|5.0|I'll leave the in-depth review in the capable hands of those who have already submitted (although I'm still a bit mystified by the bad rap due to rap content -- I guess we all have opinions!).<BR>I hear many influences in this work, all to great effect. Pink Floyd, Dream Theater, Marillion (because of Fish's voice no doubt), Alan Parsons, Supertramp, Holst, blues, even the Beatles! The sci-fi story is compelling and holds all the varied styles together nicely. This is great prog done by great musicians, with enough prog-metal and space rock to satify the most demanding listener. Many spine-tingling passages. Excellent!
B000005RYQ|1.0|great musicains great voice but what a bunch of phonies.you call outladous PUNK????? i guess you musicologists think music begins and ends with the beatles get real . u want punk try the dwarves maybe some pop jazz like sting tries to immitate,get the real deal STEELY DAN the voice sting wishes he had.every little thing she does,,,,  god i cant even stomach it anymore. i do like Brand New Day though.

'you don't like rice? a billion chinese people can't be wrong!' )  This movie rocks...best 80's flick and better than any of those stupid 80's movie sherry watches!  Way cool sound track too...'people are strange' and 'though shall not fall' (that karen, listening to that all day...she thinks she's a vampire).  I'm trying to get my good cousin mander to watch it too...she better have watched it by the time this review comes out!  This movie has already cracked my top 20 movie list and karen's and derrick's list.  As for that derrick fellow, he's one funny dude.  He was trying to be like micheal and eat maggots.  Everytime he eats rice, I say: &quot;your eating maggots derrick&quot;  Hahah, but derrick wants to be one of the frog brothers.  he thinks he's a vampire hunter so the other day he went to church and filled his water gun with holy water! then he went up to karen and started squirting her.  after karen didn't sizzle like a vampire, karen punched that fat bloke of a derrick straight in the stomach and knocked him out.  &quot;If there's one thing I can't stomach in santa cruz, its these damn VAMPIRES!&quot; hahha man 'people are strange'

B00005JMFR|5.0|The problem with just about every theory i've heard is that they assume that what we've heard so far is correct. Remember, this is the matrix trilogy. In the first film we learned that the reality we live in is actually built for humans, ruled by machines.<br />who is to say that the machines won the war in the first place?<br />for those who have seen the animatrix, they saw a world where a machine entered a private matrix. who is to say that the robots really won the war? here's what i think happened:<BR>the humans won the war, and the machines, now sentient, wanted to be humans. so, every human inside the matrix is actually a machine. the people we see that work for the matrix are actually humans, trying to regulate what occurs in the fantasy world of the matrix. what we see as the real world is just a facade and another layer of the matrix.<br />in the first film, smith called humanity a virus. well, isn't he looking awful virus-like at the moment? email me with your thoughts about this, i am eager to discuss it.
0312983867|5.0|I guess this novel deserves a 4.5 instead of 5, but I love the series too much. I think the thing is, with this series, if a person doesn't laugh enough for any of the later books (say, 7 or 8), they will give a lower rating. I know it's hard for Janet Evanovich to keep up with the hilarity level of each of her Stephanie Plum novels, so, even if I didn't laugh after every two pages of this novel, I gave this novel a five. <br />I think I speak for a few people when I say that the tendency for repeating all the facts about Morelli and Steph's past, Vinnie/Lula/Connie and their own weird characteristics, and Grandma Mazur's reason for living with Steph's parents are getting annoying. I'm willing to ignore those little bits because I understand that readers may be reading the series for the first time, and they need the explanations to understand what's up. <br />I can see how some may think this novel is a teensy bit darker than the others. I guess it got a little serious with Eddie Abruzzi and his stalker antics. However, the added seriousness of this particular novel doesn't diminish the fact that this novel is still great.<br />'Hard Eight' is fast-paced, and things move along a little faster than it usually does in the other Plum novels. How it ended was a little abrupt, but, while others may disagree, what Ranger did made me like him even more (Yeah--weird, I know).<br />My only complaint is just that things are getting a little repetative. We know what'll eventually happen to Steph's cars; we know about Grandma's viewings at the funeral; we're not as surprised anymore with Lula's actions. I don't mind this as much as other readers might, because I still haven't gotten sick of any of the novels yet. Sure, I may like some books more than others, but it doesn't mean I'll stop reading the series. <br />Anyways, I heard 'To the Nines' is a little different than what we're used to, so I'm looking forward to reading about another one of Stephanie's adventures.
B00005JL96|3.0|OK, call me a bad mom for taking my 3 1/2 year old to see Disney movies. Never do we see a complete family (mom AND dad)in a Disney flick. But this time, we didn't expect such a poor reaction. Lilo is a BAD little girl. Yes, she has had a sad life and may  be acting out, but a young child only sees a nasty, biting little girl who talks back and really never gets punished. Everyone feels bad for Lilo and doesn't stop her bahavior. So, ... yes it is a good movie, but wait until your child is 6 or more, unless you want to see some biting in your home.
B00005JKHN|5.0|This new 2-disc dvd of Disney's 1959 masterpiece is simply beautiful. \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" was a turning point for Disney when animators sought a more sophisticated look for their animation and presented it in widescreen. The abundance of extra features for this dvd show how this look was achieved with a history of behind the scenes which includes samples, restoration comparisons and interviews from many of the animators. Also included are games (\\"Rescue Aurora\\" and \\"Princess Personality Game\\"), music videos, art projects, art galleries, trailers, scrapbooks, publicity posters, etc. Also included: a 25 minute short film \\"Grand Canyon\\", and two other shorts - \\"The Peter Tchaikovsky Story\\", and \\"Four Artists Paint One Tree\\".<br />The commentary is especially noteworthy and informative. It features a narration by Disney historian Jeff Kurtti with the participation of Eyvind Earle (art director), Mary Costa (voice of Aurora), Ollie Johnston (supervising animator), Marc Davis (supervising animator), Frank Armitage (background painter), Mike Gabriel (Disney artist) and Michael Giaimo (Disney artist).<br />The dvd has the option of viewing it in widescreen mode (enhanced for 16x9 televisions) or full screen. I must add that viewing it in full screen will be a travesty - the full glory of this artistic accomplishment is best seen in widescreen!
B00000255F|5.0|&quot;Born To Run&quot; is one of the greatest albums of all time, and that fact is inarguable. The only question is how many albums you'll put on the list. Any list with more than ten, without this one, is clearly in error.<br />It is an album where a single listen will convince you.<br />The cinematic sweep, from &quot;Thunder Road&quot; to &quot;Jungleland&quot;, makes you feel like you're watching a movie while listening. The epic nature and true storylines makes you feel like you're reading a classic novel.<br />I ask you, what album have you ever listened to, that elicits a sensation of music, film and literature simultaneously? It's breathtaking.<br />And ageless as well. You know how old black &amp; white movies seem crisp and eternal, while, say, certain 70's movies have a dated feel...even though they may be GREAT 70's movies?<br />&quot;Born To Run&quot; hasn't aged one iota. It's as impressive now as it must have been in 1975.<br />It's an album that sounds just as good in your car as it does on your headphones.<br />From Roy Bittan's piano opening &quot;Thunder Road&quot; to Springsteen's anguished howl ending &quot;Jungleland&quot;, you will have gone somewhere. Bruce and the band takes you on a journey...GOD I'm jealous that some of you haven't heard this yet! I'd like to watch someone listen to it for the first time...<br />I'm telling ya, this is simply one of the great musical experiences of all time.
B000002TQV|5.0|Radiohead's last completely 'natural' album--that is, their last record made strictly with guitars, bass, drums, and common keyboards--\\"The Bends\\" is arrogant, angry, heartbreaking, exciting, and philosophical all at once.  It opens rather turgidly with the jittery, vaguely [mad] drone of \\"Planet Telex,\\" sending the message that the band has more than outgrown its status as a by-the-numbers indie guitar band.  As Thom Yorke gurgles \\"You can force it/But it will not come\\" over a wall of noise, it is clear Radiohead have already left this earth, perhaps for this imaginary planet where nothing is beyond the reach of a dazzling guitar riff or an intriguing lyric.    Luckily, \\"The Bends\\" is one of the rare records where the genius of each song is outdone only by the genius of the subsequent one.  After this impressive opener, Radiohead drift into the far reaches of the rock universe and churn out one classic right after another.  \\"Planet Telex\\" is somehow outdone by the guitar blasts and vocal distortion of the title track, which is in turn bested by the vocal acrobatics of \\"High and Dry.\\"  The fourth track, \\"Fake Plastic Trees,\\" is both gorgeous and darkly cathartic, its pristine acoustic strumming and falsetto singing give way to another wondrous guitar drone and Yorke's delirious vocals (the way he twists the word \\"feeling\\" in the final verse sends chills up my spine).  By the time the album ends with the towering Jeff Buckley-meets-The-Smiths wonder of \\"Street Spirit,\\" Radiohead have crafted a sparkling interstellar soundscape from these ambitious tunes.    I would venture saying \\"The Bends\\" outdoes even \\"OK Computer.\\"  It is a more human record, and packs twice the load of heartbreak.  Furthermore, it features the best Johnny Greenwood solo of all time (the grungey-funk explosion that ends \\"Just) and the band's best 'ballad' (if the hopeless, operatic depression of \\"Bullet Proof\\" can be called such).  However, I must say that this record is more of a slow-grower than its successor; the subtlety of some songs (the glowing background vocals on \\"Nice Dream\\") take time to sink in, and the lyrical messages are difficult to absorb with only one listen.  Regardless, \\"The Bends\\" is one of the musical highlights of the 90s.
B000002HRE|5.0|This album is one my fav Metallica albums. not only metallica finally broke the \\"trash rock\\" sterotype, but at the same time proved that they can be musicians as well as a heavy metal band.<br />To enjoy this album, most of all you need a good music system to hear each sound, and comperhand the lyrics. Great stuff!

0156027321|4.0|A boy, a tiger, and a lifeboat might seem to be some rather meager materials from which to concoct a novel about life, religion, the very basis of being. This book attempts it, and in many ways succeeds in its aims.<br />Before we get to the lifeboat, Yann carefully develops not only his character of Pi but also shows some excellent slices of life in India, quickly throws both some heavy barbs and some praise for certain aspects of three of the world's major religions, and educates the reader in some basic rules on the care, treatment, and normal behavior of zoo animals. When the ship Pi is travelling on founders, taking down with it his parents and quite a few of the animals from the zoo that Pi's father was director of, Pi suddenly finds himself trapped on a lifeboat with the oddly (but logically) named tiger Richard Parker, and all of this earlier background material comes into play, making the situation not only highly believable but quite fascinating. Pi's resourcefulness in staying alive in this situation for 270 days is exceptional, and Richard Parker becomes a full-bodied character, while remaining very much a real tiger. The interaction between the two and the challenges of the sea is a broad canvas that Yann uses to investigate his larger questions of religion and life, questions which are answered on a very individualistic basis for Pi. But I think most people could recognize some points of contact with Pi's ruminations, and find their own lives richer for vicariously living through Pi's experience.<br />Yann's style is very fluid, occasionally almost poetic, and he gets by with a minimum of description of places and scenes. The style and the carefully placed informational material did much to make me believe in the basic situation of boy and tiger surviving together. The detail work is impressive, from Pi's raft construction to cleaning out the lifeboat of Richard's wastes - details which enforce the feeling that this is a description of reality. However, there were a couple of places where I felt that Yann included some items merely for their shock value, and weren't really necessary to develop his theme or story, and a couple of other happenings did not strike me as at all believable.  But neither does he unnecessarily drag out the survival story, and his wrapping of Pi's narrative in a surrounding story of a writer investigating the details of this tale from a much later date adds both cohesiveness and veracity to the story.<br />I was disappointed by the end of the book, as it brings into play the literary artifice of the `unreliable narrator', calling into question the entire earlier portion of the book. While this certainly led me to evaluate all the philosophical points Yann had raised, it left me with a large emotional let-down, an unhappiness with the overall gestalt of the book. I think I would have been happier if this final section had not been included, though many seem to think that it is this section that completes the thematic message of the book.<br />Still, a fascinating read about a truly exceptional situation, with more than enough message to occupy my brain, and enough visceral happenings to keep me emotionally engaged throughout the book.<br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat), there were a couple of places where I felt that Yann included some items merely for their shock value, and weren't really necessary to develop his theme or story, and a couple of other happenings did not strike me as at all believable.

B00005JKZV|5.0|DON'T GET ME WRONG!  <BR>I'll still take this movie over just about any other I've seen lately.  I've met lots of people who never read the books, and I can understand why they like the movie just as it is.  The effects are awesome without smothering the story, Gollum is perfect, and the whole thing does rock.<br />But I do have to agree with a lot of what the \\"purists\\" are saying.  Fellowship departed from the book in a lot of small ways, but only one of them (Aragorn's wishy-washy self-imposed exile) really altered the storyline, and they were probably done to establish the characters more quickly.  The book had a lot of islands in the story (Tom Bombadil) that were removed without a loss.<br />The Two Towers movie went a lot further with the creative license, and I think the storyline is hurt.  I agree with keb that Faramir was completely hijacked, as were the Ents. In the book, they deliberated for days about fighting Saruman, but in the end, they _agree_ to.  Had they not, no amount of well-intended trickery on the part of the hobbits would have changed their mind.  They were meant to have personalities befitting ancient forces of nature:  their minds move like a mighty river whose course does not change easily.<br />Then there's how the movie ended.  What was that?  The book ends with Sam stuck in Mordor by himself, with Frodo a prisoner and in very bad shape.  How perfect would that have been as a cliffhanger?  To make matters worse, they took the time they saved by ending the movie \\"early\\" and blew it on a side plot about Aragorn falling off a cliff and coming back the next day. Not to mention inventing a conflict among Elrond, Arwen and Aragorn about their relationship (and embellishing the attraction between Aragorn and Eowyn).  In the books, Elrond doesn't have a big problem with Arwen and Aragorn.  He seems to think surrendering her elvish nature to wed Aragorn is fitting; the only involvement the Elves can have in the coming ages.  His brother, after all, did the same thing thousands of years ago and became Aragorn's distant ancestor.<br />The elves at Helm's Deep are annoying for the exact reasons laid out elsewhere:  the Elves, as a faction, were \\"done\\" with Middle-Earth in that capacity.<br />Saruman's possession of Theoden was also a little overdone.  The book seems to imply a much more mundane sort of enfeeblement for Theoden; he was getting old and had lost his will to fight.  Saruman's main involvement was to send Grima along to insulate him and keep him plied with bad advice.<br />I wish they'd spent a bit more time on the aftermath of the battle at Isengard.  The book's rendering of the tension in the air as Saruman trues to BS his way out of trouble with the major characters was really great.  I don't think they did it justice.
B00005JLSE|5.0|I was absolutely amazed by this musical made movie.  Zeta-Jones, Zelleweger and Gere's performances are incredible.  Their singing voices are perfect for this film, and their dancing is stupendous.  The plot melds greed, corruption and murder with satirical song and dance in the one of the best musicals ever written.  <br />The extras on this DVD are fun.  Mind you, there aren't your typical deleted scenes, but finally being able to see the deleted song \\"Class\\" is worth it.  Plus, the short documentary on the making of the film was good fun.<br />This DVD is a must have for any good collection.

B00000I9MK|5.0|Why do you listen this album? Because you wanna be part of a picnic together with your closest friend? Because you wanna record it on your walkman tape and take it with you, while you take the subway, watching girls talking about their lives? Chelsea and Lisa? Why do you get attached to the songs so easily? Probably because you feel like &quot;this is my personal moment right now&quot;. Chilly and comfortable, sat on a velvet chair or on a noisy bus, it doesn't matter, this album goes with ocasions of resting, drinking and observing.

B00005JLSE|5.0|I seem to be in the minority here for loving this movie/musical.  That's okay though.  I thought that the singing, dancing, and acting was outstanding.  In a different review I had written for the CD to the movie, I remarked that I was quite surprised by Renee Zelwegger and Richard Gere.  I had no idea how talented they are!<br />The behind-the-scenes section is incredible!  I loved being able to see rehearsals and the secrets of how the play came to be.<br />True, it's very different to put a musical that is meant for the stage on to the screen, but this was definitely worth the buy.  I am a huge fan of musicals, and this one didn't disappoint me one bit.
0446677450|5.0|My resume.<br />I lost everything that I owned, not once but twice, before the age of 36 by making almost every single financial mistake that a person could make (too much credit card debt, repossessions, tax liens, etc.). I consider myself to be the poster child for financial ignorance.<br />What is funny is that I am far from being stupid or lazy. But I was extremely ignorant and arrogant about money like most of us, until I read this book. Losing everything you have twice makes you stop and think about what you're doing, and more importantly, why you are doing it. We are not taught what is in this book in high school or in our higher institutions of &quot;learning&quot;. Why is that? I am not saying that the book is a cure all, but it is a very good start in helping someone to educate themselves. Now, I can say that I know what money is and what is not; and this knowledge thanks to Mr. Kiyosaki has greatly improved my financial literacy and understanding. He makes points that make sense because he explains why we can work so hard for so long and end up with nothing to show for it.<br />As a result, I have made the study of money a top priority in my life and I try to help as many people as I can understand how to think about money and how to use it wisely. The other books in the Rich Dad, Poor Dad series are also must reads.<br />In my studies I have read a lot of information concerning banking and the history of money, especially the history of the Federal Reserve and the Federal Reserve Act of 1913. More info on this can easily be found on a good search engine, like Google.com. Rich Dad, Poor Dad is definitely a must read book. The more I study other sources of information, the more I get out of the book. I have read it now about 5 times. It's simple. It works. I am applying what I learned and it is working. IF anyone tells you anything that's different, they're either in denial or flat-broke or both. On top of that, they are easy prey for those who make a &quot;good living&quot; exploiting the ignorance of others.<br />Robert Kiyosaki has done good by me. If you read the book and do what he says, he'll do good by you too. 'Nuf said.
0345440900|4.0|Tracy Hogg makes it clear pretty quickly: her method is neither Attachment Parenting nor Schedulista. In fact, it's sure to turn off those parents who read parenting books (and these reviews) to compare them to their steadfast beliefs. But for the rest of us, there's about the same amount of stuff we can use as the in other leading books.<br />Hogg lays out a plan for a \\"gentle schedule:\\" nursing time, alert time, naptime, repeat. Great, though it didn't work for our baby--she'd spit up a lot if she didn't sleep after nursing. But the key insight from the book wasn't the order of things, but this straightforward nugget of advice: put the boob away and let your baby get some rest.<br />That's been a bit controversial among some in our families who interpret every sigh as a hunger cry, but we've learned to pay attention to our daughter's body language and to distinguish tired from bored from hungry. The point is that we're paying attention to her actions rather than to our overactive desire to be wondernurterers. Probably coincidentally, our baby is 50th percentile for weight and height.<br />Hogg is definitely on one side of the fence when it comes to parents affecting their baby's behavior. She makes a good case for the notion that you can provide some structure without being draconian. She presents parents' need for some autonomy as helpful, rather than a divine right or a cause for guilt and self-loathing. Bottom line: if you can get through the self-conscious English charm and off-target lists, it's worth a read.
B00000DFRS|4.0|100 years ago, Whitney beguiled us all with her incitation I Wanna Dance With Somebody. It's been a wasteland of paint-by-the-number soundtrack screamers ever since. One can blame her attempt at Hollywood starletdom and a desperately dysfunctional marriage to one-hit wonder Bobby `Ike Turner' Brown for some of the career limp. But Houston's no saint either. After ceaseless years of prancing to the stage to collect her obligatory statuettes, interviews have revealed a rubber-necked diva, a wasted Whitney who appears close to nodding off to Neverneverland. It appeared the bright-eyed and bushy-tailed babe who bounced on the scene with her pipes stoked in the early `80s had been beaten out of her. And along comes My Love. It's no revolutionary R&B album, but it tames the roaring lions waiting to chew Houston in to a walking anachronism. Reems of new comers are largely to credit for saving her, including Babyface Edmonds, Wyclef Jean, Lauryn Hill and Brandy/Monica studio wizard Rodney Jerkins. They help bring the groove Houston's been missing for so long, turning her MOR tales of love lost, love won and life questioned in to a suitably charming and listenable package of diverse styles and catchy hip hop, soul and Wyflef reggae creations (there's even a so-called hidden track, a pleasing cover of Stevie Wonder's I Was Made to Love Her). Yes, there are dabs of the brand of schmaltz which has come to epitomize her worst. But Houston's weaker moments are overpowered by the cool samples and pure pain and emotion this diva uses to ram each and every note. A nice move sideways.

This compared to 'G Funk Era' and 'The Chronic', it's impossible to say which one is the best. If you're one of those people who dislike this album, something must be wrong with you because this has easily entered Rap's Hall of Fame.<br />Produced by Dr. Dre, this has mind-blowing and ear-splitting beats I've ever heard in the G Funk genre. Outstanding songs to be heard on this album are: What's my Name, Gin n Juice, Tha Shiznit, Murder was the Case, Doggy Dogg World and Ain't No Fun (which is my favorite song on this album. Expect guest appearances from Dogg Pound, Dre, RBX, Lady of Rage, Warren G (basically the whole Death Row crew except for 2pac).<br />Out of every rap album Snoop has released, this is the best by a long shot.

The real value is on the Bonus disc. Live recording from Wembley stadium is just amazing and worth of buying! I bought this version even I had the same cd without Bonus disc! Live disc contains a legendary live versions of Sultans of Swing and Brothers in Arms recorded in very high quality. You may have heard the live version of Sultans of Swing in Alchemy live, but this is better, extremely professional sound quality and amazing specimen of skill in quitar playing by Mark Knopfler, more feeling, more ambience. Even you are serious fan or just freshman in listening Dire Straits, I really recommend this one. You'll get comprehensive collection of their music with one of the best live recordings ever!

0385509456|5.0|When you read &quot;The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time&quot;, you get a glimpse into the thought processes of an autistic savant. Written in the form of a journal by the teenaged Christopher Boone, this innovative story ostensibly takes us through the boy's efforts to find the killer of his neighbor's dog. But what we really experience is a bittersweet journey of self-discovery for a boy who finds the world a most confusing and illogical place.<br />Haddon, who has worked with autistic children, does a wonderful job of explaining how Christopher perceives his environment and tries to cope with its perplexities. Examples abound of the contrasts between Christopher's literal, logical thought processes and the more typical imaginative and emotional ones. A powerful illustration of intuition versus logic is presented in a deceptively simple &quot;Let's Make a Deal&quot; probability problem that had me struggling for an entire day before accepting and understanding the answer.<br />Don't let the thought of an unemotionally narrated story with math problems in it put you off, however. This book is a delight in every way. We still witness the emotional impact of events on the people around Christopher. Although we feel frustrated over his inability to read others, we cheer him on as he manages to get by in the world in spite of his disability. There are humorous touches throughout the book to prevent it from becoming too maudlin.<br />What more can I say? Read this book!
6305508550|3.0|Amazon should get the year of this movie right it says 1999 when it came out March 1998 (I still have my stub).

B00005JKJA|3.0|Mulholland Drive is probably the most accessible of David Lynch's films (except perhaps the Straight Story). I prefer Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me and Wild at Heart for their all out absurdity. But I'm guessing that a second viewing of Mulholland Drive would make it even better, and I bet it was amazing on the big screen. I only saw it on video. <br />Laura Harring is quite delicious in it and the scenes between her and Naomi Watts were steamy. If you don't like weird films, you probably won't like this one. But I think it's worth seeing just for the scene where Rebekah Del Rio sings \\"Llorando (Crying)\\". Chilling. <br />The movie was written to be a tv pilot and in some ways, it shows a certain weakness in the story and acting. But this also makes it a bit more interesting than something written for a movie.

B0000BWVCM|5.0|Consider the first X-Men film a plot progressing set up, because from the first opening scene in X2 your thrown head first into one of, if not the, best comic to film adaptions of all time, and one of the few times a sequel out do's the original. Almost all of the first film's entire ensemble cast returns: Patrick Stewart (Professor X), Hugh Jackman (ever perfect as Wolverine), Ian McKellan (Magneto), Halle Berry (Storm), Famke Janssen (Jean Grey), James Marsden (Cyclops), Anna Paquin (Rogue), and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos (Mystique) are all back. Also, the film goes more in depth with Iceman (Shawn Ashmore) and Pyro (Aaron Stanford) and introduces us to beloved characters Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming who turns out to be nearly perfect in the role) and Colossus (Daniel Cudmore). The storyline finds the X-Men months after the events in the first film, under siege by General Stryker (Brian Cox) who has his own agenda for mutant kind. Eventually the X-Men must team up with Magneto to stop him, and this is where the film shines. Director Brian Singer was critiqued quite a bit when it was said that the first film wasn't action packed enough; well, he made up for it here as X2 is action packed from beginning to end and the film pushes the limits of it's PG-13 rating. The performances are great, and while Jackman is his usually terrific self as Wolverine, he isn't the focus this time around and we get to see Berry more developed as Storm, Romijn-Stamos gets more screen time as well, and Janssen is better now as Jean Grey than anyone could have ever thought before. The special effects are nothing short of incredible; from Wolvie popping his claws to Deathstrike (Kelly Hu) popping hers, to Colossus' body turning to steel to Pyro's fire spewing shootout with the cops you will be in awe of the special effects wizardry. The only complaint here is that with the exception up towards the end of the film is once again Cyclops is a criminally underused character. Marsden is a good actor and Cyclops is a very interesting character and it is a shame he has gone so underused. All in all, X2 is much better than I could have ever hoped it to be, and this is undoubtadly one of the finest comic to film adaptions of all time.nd Cyclops is a very interesting character and it is a shame he has gone so underused.

It offers a combination of hard beats and mezmerizing lyrics tied up with the outstanding solid female vocals Evanescence offers.  Something else offered on this CD is a variety.  Every song has it's own feeling and nothing sounds the same except for the outstanding performace by Amy Lee throughout this release.  Do yourself a favor, get this cd!!

The true shining gem on this CD is the title track &quot;Home,&quot; which easily ranks among Simply Red's best, and needs to gain some exposure, because it is a Grammy-worthy ballad. Nice Dylan cover too.

B00005JLSE|5.0|Chicago is a movie that you just cannot help but love. It has an all star cast, a great musical score, and a plot that is so far-fetched, it is nothing but a good time. Though the action of the film revolves around a group of women who kill their significant others, a publicity hungry lawyer, and a less than noble women's prison warden-hardly the best society has to offer-it does not attempt to be anything but fun. The film is glitzy, colorful, and fast paced. The DVD has a bonus track of a number omitted from the film which is fun to watch, though omitting it from the film was probably a wise choice, and behind the scenes shots which is a plus fo0r any movie buff.<br />Many reviewers of the film wondered if Chicago's success is the beginning of a new era of Hollywood musicals. This is hard to say. If we look at some of the great musicals of yesteryear, particularly the great MGM musicals and Twentieth Century Fox's versions of the Rogers and Hammerstein greats, and consider that studios were able to take implausible plots, set then to music, add an all star cast,  put money behind the project, trusting the talent of all involved and the movie going public to support such projects, and have great success, then perhaps Chicago is the beginning of a new era. We will have to wait and see.
B000055XMF|3.0|I have been waiting a long time for the release of a special edition version of this film, and must say that I have been let down by the final release. The film tells the story of a young mods life in 60's England. I love the film and have been a fan of it for a long time. The problem with this release is that it is not the complete film. There are scenes missing that are on on the original UK VHS version. The extras are bad, if you're expecting indepth stories and details about the film, you will like me be disappointed. They are made for an audience with no understanding of the medium it is trying to cover. This just makes it annoying. For a first time viewer, they will be just light, boring and very short entertainment. The interview with Sting has a lot of trouble finding anything that Sting said about the film. The scooter part is about 40 seconds long! The restored film has better colour than the VHS, but this is about the only good point. With missing scenes and bad extras this is not for anyone who likes the film and wants a DVD version of the film to keep. Why dosen't someone give this the release it deserves? Love the film hated the DVD.

The sole light at the end of this seemingly endless tunnel of darkness and despair is the voice of Amy Lee, who's voice is clear, sweet, and tragically wasted on this disturbing mess of sounds and empty lyrics masquerading as a \\"music\\" album.
B000002KON|4.0|Ray Davies and the Kinks were always criminally underrated, especially here in the States. Part of this, I believe, has to do with their subject matter. Davies' commentaries on a declining postwar English society are often seen as irrelevent by the American record-buying public.<br />That assumption should be put to rest, right now. Ray Davies is a singer-songwriter for the Everyman, more so than American contemporaries Neil Young and even Bruce Springsteen. Who cares if you weren't raised in England? Released in 1967, Arthur's conceptual pictures of lower middle-class life, ennui, and struggle are extremely captivating and have just as much relevance today as they did 30 years ago. Take this verse from Shangri-La, for example:<br />\\"And all the houses in the street have got a name/<br />'Cos all the houses in the street they look the same/<br />Same chimney pots, same little cars, same window panes/<br />The neighbors call to tell you things that you should know/<br />They say their lines, they drink their tea, and they go/<br />They tell your business in another Shangri-La/<br />The gas bills and the water rates, and payments on the car/<br />Too scared to think about how insecure you are/<br />Life ain't so happy in your little Shangri-la..\\"<br />Doesn't that sound an awful lot like the faceless suburbs seen throughout modern America? That verse in particular, with its rocking drumline, exquisite horns, and Davies' energetic delivery makes the song for me. But you could easily devote a thesis paper to the rest of the song and indeed, the rest of the album. Yes Sir No Sir, Nothing To Say, Brainwashed, She Bought A Hat Like Princess Marina, and the title track display this same nature and are perfect artistic statements. Some Mother's Son is a heartbreaking song about the anonymity of war, and Mr. Churchill Says can either be taken as a tribute to the great prime minister or an ironic commentary on war-hungry politicians.<br />And it sure doesn't hurt that the Kinks rock like few other British Invasion bands, either.<br />I don't think the album is perfect. I never cared much for Drivin', and Victoria borders almost on self-parody. But if it weren't for The Village Green Preservation Society, this might have been regarded as the finest Kinks album. I highly reccommend that you buy both. Also buy The Who's Sell Out and Pink Floyd's first record Piper At The Gates Of Dawn, which like Arthur are frequently regarded as albums too whimsical or too English to catch on here, but are classics on the same level.e few other British Invasion bands, either. <br />I don't think the album is perfect.

B000050X31|5.0|This DVD of Mozart's &quot;Magic Flute&quot; is one of the best I ever seen (over-shadowed only by the CD set with Gedda, Janowitz, Berry and Popp).  I approach this opera with skepticism as all the roles are incredibly difficult to sing (coming from experience singing the role of Tamino in college).  Araiza's vocal expertise and physical stature make him a convincing Tamino.  Battle's ever-innocent features make her a perfect Pamina (check out her Zerlina also).  In my eyes nothing could ever surpass Lucia Popp in the role of the Queen of the Night but Serra certainly gives it run for the money.  Her features (the &quot;beautiful villainess&quot; reminiscent of Malificent from Disney's &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;) and the sheer vocal power of her Queen makes her as stunning as she is beautiful.  This is one of the BEST casts I've ever seen put together.

0156027321|5.0|This is one of the most unique storylines I've read in a novel in quite some time.  A mixture of sadness and humor, of hardship and triumph -- Life of Pi is one novel that will stay with me for a long, long time.  Yann Martel is 100% deserving of the Booker Prize.<br />I wasn't quite sure what to make of this book when I first started it.  It was slow to get into, and there were parts that seemed to go on and on.  But while it felt bogged down, it also held my interest.  I mean, how many books do you read involve a 16-year-old Indian boy and a Bengal Tiger adrift on a lifeboat in the middle of the Pacific Ocean?  Perhaps the long-windedness of the story (in regards to zoo politics and descriptions of everything) was pertinent, a way of creating the atmosphere of boredom -- a feeling I'm sure was at the top of the list for Pi Patel as he floated endlessly in search of rescue.<br />The book was set up in three parts -- part 1 gives us background information on Pi and his family and their zoo; part 2 sends the family and their zoo on a Japanese cargo ship across the ocean to their Canadian destination (which ultimately ends in disaster); and part 3 is the conclusion of the book (which will remain a secret...you'll just have to read!).  I must say that all three parts of this novel were exquisitely rendered and toward the end I had tears in my eyes.  The long, long wait (Pi's journey in the Pacific) is definitely worth the ending.  Awesome, amazing, wonderful...I highly recommend this novel -- stick with it and you will absolutely be rewarded.
0307120007|5.0|My 14 month old son has never been good about sitting through a whole book - especially a new one.  I wanted to spark his interest in books a little more so I bought the Pat the Bunny book and bought him the bunny, too.  The first time we sat down to read this book, he sat still and let me get almost the whole way through.  Then instead of getting down to do something else, he went back to a previous page to play Peek a boo with Paul.  That is still his favorite page, although now he likes to smell the flowers quite a bit, too.  This book kept his interest.

B0000A02TZ|2.0|In short, my only gripe with the film is the 3 advertisements (totaling about 10-15 minutes) at the beginning that play before the menu loads.  There's no way to skip over them and if I OWN the disk I feel like I shouldn't be held captive by ads before getting to enjoy it.

B00009ATIX|4.0|First things first; this IS a good movie, assuming that you are a certain kind of viewer. Solaris will be misunderstood and deconstructed as boring, unemotional, and the type of movie only \\"pseudo-intellectual\\" viewers would like. This is not true. If you like this movie, it does not mean that you are a posturing, wannabe, film critic, it only means that you saw something in it that other viewers did not. <br />Some might characterize the performances and infrequent dialogue in this film as lacking chemistry or slow, however if you realize that sometimes what is NOT said is as important as what IS said, you should recognize the masterful performances of Clooney and McElhone. The relationship between the two is very powerful and drives a suspensful story that held me in thrall until the credits rolled. Not every movie can make me wait with baited breath. <br />Some viewers may sense a lack of conflict or not be able to identify a protagonist or antagonist, but this is only because they do not recognize the oldest and most intricate form of conflict. Man vs Self. <br />Performances aside, this movie deserves a certain modicum of merrit based solely on cinematography and set design. Through the rare understanding that less can be more, Soderbergh creates a very powerful and beautifl movie without being caught in the trappings of its science-fiction setting. If you have a thing for cinematography, check this movie out.<br />On a final aside, this movie is simply not for everyone, but don't let one person's opinion condemn this movie before you see it. You may find it a VERY enjoyable experience as I did. Some books are meant as entertainment, but some are meant as enriching experiences. While Dickens may not be fast paced or exciting, have you ever heard anyone refer to his writing as meaningless?
B00007LTIB|5.0|For those Yes fans wondering why they should spend more money on yet another set of re-masters, the latest batch by Rhino is the answer.  The latest four are some of my favorites, and they sound so much better than the earlier releases, it's just amazing.  Perhaps the best re-master is &quot;Tales...&quot; which has suffered in muddy sound for so many years, and now has many hidden details brought to the surface.  Superb job on these, and high marks to Rhino and Inglot and the rest of the team involved.  The bonus tracks on most of these reissues are just OK, but with a rehearsal/demo of Gates Of Delirium available, definitely worth a listen.  Great packaging on these CDs, too.

For those of you who don't own a single PT CD, this is a good place to start, though I'd recommend Lightbulb Sun and Stupid Dream as perhaps better introductions.  If you enjoy melodic, spacey and somewhat dark rock with clever, introspective lyrics; then you should definitely give this double CD a listen.  This isn't my favorite PT CD, I'd give it 4 stars when compared with the rest of their discography.

B00009MGQL|1.0|In my opinion, this trend of seeking new listeners and alienating existing ones started with Santana's \\"Supernatural\\", continued with Clapton's \\"Reptile\\", and now with Jeff Beck's \\"Jeff\\".  Anyone hoping for a return to the \\"Blow By Blow\\" and \\"Wired\\" era will be extremely disappointed.  If one could only separate the guitar tracks from the sampling and  inane \\"Yoko-like\\" vocals, maybe there would be something listenable.  For anyone seeking modern sounds from Jeff Beck, I highly recommend the soundtrack recording from \\"Frankie's House\\".

B0000047CW|4.0|I think it is important to remember that this site is an international one, with reviewers and browsers from all over the globe - so I can easily see Brazilians shaking their collective cabesas over the comment that this was the first Bossa Nova record. It was definately one of the first to introduce samba and bossa rhythms to the U.S. Both Dizzy Gillespie and Cannonball Adderley were using bossa standards in their repetoire at the time also (much to the chagrin of some of their fans). As to the comment that &quot;Jazz Samba&quot; is a better and more fluid recording than &quot;Getz/Gilberto&quot;, I can not agree. Byrd is a great player, and even a great player in the Brazilian mode, but he is no Joao Gilberto. &quot;Jazz Samba&quot; is 'fluid' in my opinion also, but because the dynamics are never bumped up a notch. &quot;Getz/Gilberto&quot; has more subtlety, better playing by all the musicians involved (Jobim's piano work on 'Corcorvado' alone is more subtle and his chordal sparcity on &quot;Doralice&quot; more dynamic than any moment on &quot;Jazz Samba&quot;), and one incredible singer to boot (and I don't mean Astrud). Getz plays far better and way more 'in the pocket' with Joao and a real Brazilian rhythm section. Don't get me wrong, I love this recording. &quot;O Pato&quot; is a masterpiece for its time and the recording stands up well today in general, but when the first &quot;bossa nova&quot; recording was made has been discussed at length - some even say Laurindo Almeida may have made it a decade before, but the general consensus is that Jobim, Gilberto, Lyra, Castro-Neves, et al. were doing it in the later half of the 1950s. That does not diminish the greatness of this recording then, and it sounds great today as well.
B000002LUB|5.0|I own this album since it came out in 92. At first the album looks like its not one of the classics, but after listening to it for a while in the background you start to realize how heavy it really is. I was going \\"What the hell...??\\" on occasions and turning on the volume.<BR>After listening at it again after a couple of years I have to say that its simply one of the heaviest of their albums. The riffs are real real heavy I have to say once you play them yourself.

B00006ALGL|5.0|You may see reviews here that shun this record, claiming it to be immature, uninventive, cliche, the &quot;catfish of irish folk&quot;.  Whatever.  This disc is 100% phenominal from start to finish.  No weaknesses, no faults.  What you'll find in O is pure emotion; passion, love, confusion, anxiety.  All brought to life in such a way that simply cannot be described.  Damien Rice bares all here, letting nothing back, and the result is stunning.  Everything is presented with such deliberate subtlety and grace, and is yet so overpowering that one cannot help but to get wrapped up in every beautiful piece.  Don't listen to the nay-sayers; this album is pure gold.
B00000F1D3|4.0|The first time I heard Cher's powerful wall-piercing vocal STRONG ENOUGH on the radio, I told myself I'm going to miss the 70s goodness of disco and gayness if I don't dump my then heartbreaking relationship and move on with my life...<br />DO YOU BELIEVE IN LIFE AFTER LOVE? Yes, for the sake of survivors, Cher will always be a grand guidance figure to shelter us from the cruelty of love when it leaves you bleeding.<br />Despite of a few critically too cliche-sounding disco tracks, I gave 4 stars to the bold release of this record and insist &quot;this is the (curing) album for the lonely&quot; and hurt.<br />P/S: The CD sleeve printing is a platinum pearl-like silverish blue which adds the disco feel to this album. I actually bought it twice for an original German copy to replace the &quot;duller&quot; local edition in my country Malaysia.
B00005MK9Y|5.0|This is Bob Marley's second live album, following the aptly titled, &quot;Live.&quot;  When playing live, he changes the beats around, and gets the crowd into it.  He starts off the album with the jolly &quot;Rastaman Vibration.&quot;  I love his rendition of one of his great rock songs, &quot;Concrete Jungle.&quot; On this album, the intro is more pronounced, and the solo is a great rock piece.  On most of the songs, you can almost hear him grinning while singing.  The album makes you want to get up and move your dancing feet.  Throughout the concert, you can hear the audience cheering and singing along with the songs.  Bob Marley is one of the best live musicians, along with Bruce Springsteen.  It shines through on this album. Worth every single penny.
B00008S2VH|3.0|First of all, speaking of phenomenal artists like Madam Madonna, there is already no reason why Mirwais should remain in the picture of production again (and again in fact).<br />Enough critics have been said about her latest (r)evolution of music. Despite of that, this album remains one of the year's biggest, publicised records.<br />As someone who is onced fascinated by her image in the 80s, dazzled by her videos in the 90s and seemingly in the past millennium-gate years, I'm not gonna be bias to comment this much glossified album entitled AMERICAN LIFE.<br />I'm no new or naive to techno trance but frankly, another Double M (Maddy + Mirwais) record is gonna have us &quot;electrocuted&quot;.<br />Enough irritating syntherised sounds Mad - MOVE OVER MIRWAIS.<br />P/S: My 3 stars goes to the last track EASY RIDE in its entirety. Honest, engaging lyrics plus a well orchestra arrangement.<br />Additional remark: This thick, limited telegram container box edition will take up a triple-CD space in your rack.
B00005JLO2|5.0|The Four Feathers is a really good film which had a highly competent production cast and crew which flopped nevertheless. Production was rushed whereas post-production virtually slowed to a snail's crawl due to the events of Sept 11 somehow interfering with the anti-colonialist stance of the movie, as well as producers falling out over the long initial duration of the film, forcing director Shekhar Kapur to cut a third off the planned 3 hour release (which Kapur revealed that Miramax boss Harvey Weinstein actually approved). Well, this is nothing less than a monstrosity. Many people reported that the film looked rushed, that the editing was choppy - and it really was. Imagine what the extra hour would have added to this film. I charge that Miramax release a 3-hour Director's Cut version, because the theatrical version didn't do justice to the movie at all. At the present state the movie is already very good - a unique, sweeping score, breathtaking yet poetic cinematography, dramatic acting, not-so-direct plotline (one that is more soulful and spiritual than something that you can pitch in two sentences), as well as the prospect of seeing a well-made period film, a genre that is rarely revived these days. However the editing really suffered due to the many political pressures forced down upon it ... it is time that the real movie gets to see the light of day.
B0000069NM|4.0|I didn't care for this album when I first got it. I had sat myself down to listen through it once or twice, but it didn't grab me. Finally, several years later, I put it on again and &quot;got it.&quot; Billy Martin's playing reminds me sufficiently of Bill Stewart's, especially on the slower tunes, and that did if for me.<br />I think I would recommend A Go Go for someone who wants to make a fairly smooth transition from rock to jazz. While I still prefer the sophistication of Sco's work with Joe Lovano and Joe Hernderson, and the groove of his work with Dennis Chambers, this disc has reasonable amounts of both and has considerably more fun.

B00005JM09|3.0|I was disappointed when I first learned James Cameron wouldn't be directing this movie.  Now I can see why.  In a nutshell, this is a ripoff of Cameron's T2 only with a less-interesting storyline.  Without spoiling anything for those who haven't seen it, a number of the action sequences in this movie are direct ripoffs of scenes in T2 leaving you with a \\"been-there-seen-that\\" feeling.  Due to improvements in special-effects technology, the effects in T3 are the best of any in the Terminator series.  But the story is inferior with little if any moral behind the special effects as there was in T2.  Arnold still looks great, but you don't develop the same bond with his terminator character that you did in T2.  To top it all off, the series storyline really isn't advanced that much in this film.  I was hoping to see the war of the future between man and machine.  This installment merely gets us to the very start of that war.  Apparently, there will be another sequel that will cover the war itself.  Bottom line--worth seeing for Arnold and the great effects, but don't expect as solid (or novel) a story as you saw in T2.

B00009XITP|5.0|Okay, this definitely could be classified as a &quot;chick flick&quot; but it's such a touching story. I too, originally wanted to see it because of Colin . And I'll admit I used to watch &quot;The Amanda Show&quot; on Nickelodeon which was pretty funny. I'm glad Amanda Bynes finally gets to show her stuff, acting stuff that is. Anyway, I rented it and 20mins into the movie, I knew this was one I had to add to my DVD collection. <BR>Kelly Preston is great as the trippy hippy mom. The pairing of her with Colin Firth was great as well. I only wish they had more scenes of them falling in love...you know, good dating stuff in Morocco. The story follows Daphne (Bynes) to London on her search to meet her real father, the political candidate for Parliament, Lord Dashwood. Can she fit in to his new life? What about his fiancee and her daughter? With touching moments and the great physical comedy provided by Amanda Bynes, this movie is great entertainment. Great movie for a quiet night at home or as a family movie and the soundtrack is awesome. It even includes two of my favorite songs of all time, &quot;London Calling&quot; by The Clash and &quot;Rock and Roll Hoochie Koo&quot; by Rick Derringer. <BR>Watch this and you won't regret it.
B00005JKZV|5.0|Most of us have seen this movie, and we either like it or dislike it. The Tolkien purists have been complaining since 'The Fellowship of the Ring'. When I saw 'The Two Towers', I just knew that I'd hear about the changes that took place from book to movie. First off, I've read all three books (plus, 'The Hobbit'), and I love them. Yes, wargs attack the Rohirrim and Aragorn falls off a cliff after the attack. Yes, Elrond sends Haldir and some other elves to aid at Helm's Deep. Yes, Merry and Pippen see Gandalf in the forest. And Gandalf plays 'The Exorcist' for a bit by expelling Saruman's spirit from Theoden. And yeah, Pippen tore off his brooch with his mouth. Who cares? I enjoyed the changes. There were several more, but I don't want this to be too long. I thought that the changes brought something to the movie. The only explanation I have for the elves at Helm's Deep is that Peter Jackson wanted to include them so it would be a little more realistic that Aragorn's forces could hold. Or maybe he just liked elves. Hehe. I can just imagine him, sitting in his director's chair: \\"More elves!\\" But anyway, you have to expect SOME stuff to change when a book is adapted for a movie. Sometimes, the changes are good--like in this movie. Sometimes, they're not. Believe me, Peter Jackson could've done a far worse job. The trilogy could've resembled those hideous cartoon movies of the 70's. Oh yeah, and I LOVED the Ents! How cool were they?! My favorite scene in the movie is \\"The Last March of the Ents\\". Yeah, baby!

B00007LTIA|5.0|Tales From Topographic Oceans is not often seen among the great Yes albums due to its inaccessibility, but it belongs at the top of the list in my opinion. It was a natural progression from the long-form pieces of Close To The Edge. Relayer, the album that follows this one, distills all of the elements of this daunting work into what I feel is the pinnacle of Yes' performance. Anyone with any attention span at all can (and should) listen to Topographic Oceans. It is an album of indiscribable beauty. <BR>Now, with this re-release, one has no excuse but to buy it and enjoy the wonderful journey. The bonus tracks are a real surprise, as they lend a bit of insight as to how this intensely complex body of work was formed. They also help one realise that Yes are actually terrestrial beings. :-)<BR>Buy this record! It's worth it.

0156027321|5.0|Yann Martel has created a masterful work of fiction in &quot;Life of Pi&quot;.  'Pi' Patel is the young son of a Zookeeper in Pondicherry, a French settlement in the south of India.  His imaginative antics save him from the torments of his classmates and make for quite an interesting story.  Pi is inquisitive, and soon decides to investigate Christianity and Islam, although he is raised in a Hindu family.  This leads to enlightening discussions of the three religions, and some very funny events.<br />My favorite part of the book was the information on training animals.  I learned a ton from Pi's stories about the animals in his father's zoo, and the ways they were tamed.  The only criticism I have is for the story of his adventures with the animals on the boat, which I felt was too long and detailed, but toward the end it is evident why the author put so much detail into the story.  The ending is delightful, and completely changed my rating from 4 stars to 5.  A word to the wise - the second half drags a bit, but the ending will make it worth slogging through all the extra words.  Don't miss this book - I can only imagine all the prizes it will win!
0151006903|5.0|\\"Baudolino\\" seems to be italian writer Umberto Eco's most accessible fictional work. I mean, you can read this book without an encyclopaedia by your side (unlike \\"Foucault's pendulum\\", for example), even if sometimes you wished there was a Britannica or at least an internet terminal close by so you could look up some interesting things depicted in the book.<br />Baudolino is an italian gentleman born in the XXII century. Early in life, he is adopted by Frederick Barbarossa, ruler of the Holy Roman-Germanic Empire. As his son, Baudolino is drawn to many important happenings, and claims he was sole responsible, through a series of interesting schemes, for some of the most important situations in the history of Europe.<br />Is Baudolino the grey figure behind Barbarossa's actions, or is he just a very immaginative liar? The answer is given by Eco in the final third of the book, where Baudolino and his friends get to know fantastical places and beings while looking for the fabled Christian Kingdom of Presbyter Johannes in the eastern unknown territories of Earth.<br />\\"Baudolino\\" may seem simple at first sight, but there are so many levels buried behind the improbable shallow layer of paper that the reader may be tempted to read it again only to disclose cool information and references, randomly (not too much randomly, in fact) pasted in the story by Eco. There're links to Swift's \\"Gulliver's travels\\", Marco Polo, Voltaire, and these are just the obvious ones. \\"Baudolino\\" is a blend of real history with fictional situations, but a blend that only Eco could create, and the reader is always wondering what is true and what is not. The story is so compelling that the reader may not notice that Baudolino himself is the only character fully developed. But who cares? This book is as fantastic as Baudolino's stories. There's even a misterious murder in it, like \\"The name of the rose\\".<br />One other thing. \\"Baudolino\\" has two narrators: one is Baudolino himself, telling the story of his life. The other narrator is a third-person, omniscient one, but sometimes (like he forgot to correct himself) he uses the \\"we\\" conjugation in his phrases, and the reader is left with the impression that this misterious narrator was in fact part of Baudolino's friends. Am I wrong? Did I understand it right? I don't know, but this is just something else about this book that I'll try to find out.<br />To fully understand \\"Baudolino\\", and as a matter of fact to fully understand Eco's universe, look for other information in the internet about him, especially the website \\"Porta Ludovica\\".<br />Grade 9.2/10story of his life.

B00005JLYW|5.0|this movie rocks because it is what it is and it doesn't pretend to be anything else. it also doesn't apologize.<br />i don't know about you but i have often laughed fondly at the angel cult and copied idiotic hair flicks with my friends. then came the movie (part one) and it just elaborated the idiotic, the camp, the fast-cut, the colorful. i expected a lot from the sequel and it didn't disapoint me.<br />it was more of everything. more action, more wigs, more color, more dance numbers, more flying....<br />these girls just leave the ground without even bending their knees while dodging bullets and 'taking on six sailors' leaving unscathed and with their make-up unsmudged.<br />isn't that what it is about when it comes to 'charlie's angels'? it is for me. if you are like that too you will love this. chances are you have already seen it anyway. sign me up for this dvd, amazon!!!
0451169514|5.0|\\"It\\" is not Stephen King's masterpiece, but it's a close call.  However, \\"It\\" is Stephhen King's  masterpiece about FEAR. During  the whole novel, the reader is stuck with an uneasy, creepy, dark feeling, and I would not be surprised if I knew that most of the readers left lights on after reading the book.<br />Some say \\"It\\" is much longer than it needed to be. I disagree. The first 800 pages are there for a reason, and that's to set the atmosphere and let the reader get acquainted with the main characteres and, mostly, with the city of Derry, Maine. Stephen King's writing about Derry was so graphic that I was able to draw a very good picture of it in my mind, and I think that's important to enjoy the story further. Derry itself is one of the main characters in \\"It\\".<br />About the human characters, \\"It\\" is divided in two parts: 1958 and 1985. In 58 we know that Derry is one spooky place to live, when kids start to be murdered in gruesome ways. Then we're introduced to Bill Denbrough and his stuttering and leadership, to Richie Tozier and his Voices, to Ben Henscomb and his fatness, to pretty Bev Marsh, Eddie, Stan and Mike. They're the members of the Loosers Club, a bunch of common kids that get together to be outstanding among themselves. But they're not common at all, because together they are able to identify and fight the dark evil power lurking at the bottom of their city. And in 85 they are together again in Derry, trying to finish It forever.<br />Of course, there's much more to \\"It\\" than that, but it's best to read the whole book. Once again, Stephen King's children characters are awesome. SK's capacity to develop characters, even the minor ones, is amazing. Also, his style is to write about lots of situations, that sometimes are seeminlgy out of context, only to be tied up with the rest of the story in a few pages. And then, the 1985 characters are perfectly coherent to what they were when they were kids.<br />Atmosphere. That's why \\"It\\" is 1100 pages long, not 400. The story grabs the reader and won't let go. The final chapters (200 pages) are completely frantic and hallucynated, especially both confrontations with It. And there are some strange things too. At least, in one specific situation, I think Stephen King was a little wrong there. The kids would have to be older for that specific situation to happen as he describes it. Those who already read it will know what I'm talking about. Those who haven't, read it and see if you agree with me.<br />Grade 9.2/10long, not 400. The story grabs the reader and won't let go.

B0000AOV85|5.0|What to say? My favorite album of all-time, dissected right before my very eyes. WOW!!!!! From insights into the songs, to mixing/recording technique chat with Alan Parsons, David Gilmour, etc one could not want much more. This is a definite &quot;must-have&quot; for all Floyd fans. Heck, for music fans in general! Do yourselves a favor and RUN don't walk to the store to get this one. Right after I watched it for the 1st time, I played it again. The credits hadn't even began to roll when I started it again!! I plan on watching this gem again tonight. A masterpiece for the ages.
B00009APK1|3.0|This review contains some spoilers, so please don't read it if you have a problem with that.<br />I am not a Tolkein &quot;purist&quot; in the sense that I feel that any time the movie leaves out something from the book it is a bad thing.  I am fully aware of the task of translating such a complex, lengthy book into a movie.  I am also fully aware that to do so, not only must some things be left out, but that things must also be changed.  I don't have a problem with those concepts, and for the most part they have done a good job of overcoming these obstactles in these films.<br />HOWEVER...<BR>Some of the changes they have made in the film have not only been unnecessary from a time standpoint, they have also SERIOUSLY detracted from Tolkein's vision.  This, I do have a problem with.<BR>--The filmmakers seem to have a real problem with the concepts of nobility and honor.  I guess they must think these traits would seem too unreal in the modern age.  I can't think of any other reason for the deliberate reduction of these traits in the movies. <BR>--The character of Aragorn has had much of his nobility removed.  In the movies, he is portrayed as running from his role as king.  This was not the case in the books, where he was merely waiting for the proper time for his ascension to the throne.<BR>--In the movies, the battle of Helm's Deep happened because the people of Rohan were trapped there by the Orcs while they were running away from the fight.  In the books, they were riding out to fight.  So Theoden's nobility has also been diminished.  He goes from being a hero to being a coward.<BR>--In the movie, Elrond seriously criticizes Arwen for her decision to stay with Aragorn, then shows her eternally young while he ages and dies.  In the book, she gives up her mortality to be with him.  This is a more nobel sacrifice on her part, and Elrond is not nearly so petty regarding her choice.<br />There are other examples, but I think these are enough to document the theme I see.  None of these changes were necessary to make the story flow better.  Indeed, I think they take something vital from the story.<br />Other than these issues, I think they have been doing a superb job with the adaptations.  The visual effects are astounding, and they have created a world that looks like Middle Earth should.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|This is a revolution in hardcore/punk/metal/piano whatever. So diverse and epic that its richness doesn't fade after listening to it 100 times. If you miss out on this, you're missing a truly great album that solidifies A7X's position as one of the best bands in the world.
0385504209|5.0|WOW! What a great book - so good that it deserves my first review! The mystery surrounding the death kept me intrigued until the end! I loved the riddles that were used to solve each step of the mystery. I found the content of information and facts regarding the evolution of the catholic religion extremely interesting. Once I started reading I couldn't wait to get to the next page. I was the 7th person in my family to read it and have already recommended it to over a dozen friends. This book is money well spent! A great mystery that is not easily solved, contains interesting facts and is very well written.
B00005JKZV|5.0|Just thought I would let you know that I CAN NOT play my DVD in my DVD Rom in my computer (the only DVD player I have unfortunately). I think there is an encryption written into it to prevent copying and pirating to other forms so they can be shared via the internet. The Special Features Dvd works fine though.  I also tried it with my friends copy and the same thing... the movie didn't work, but the bonus CD does.  The movie DOES work in his component DVD player in his entertainment center though. I would be curious to know if this happens in other forms of DVD players (such as XBox or PS2) as well.  Needless to say I was not pleased with my purchase and won't be able to watch it until until I purchase a DVD player for my television.<br />I hope no one else gets stuck with this problem. I wrote to Alliance Atlantis to see what they new or could do about it. Hopefully enough people will complain and something can be done about it. ....... was the address I sent it to, I'd be interested to hear if anyone else had this problem. .......
B00005AQGI|5.0|Some people will say Nas's \\"Illmatic\\" is the best hip-hop album, or NWA, or something along that line. Even though those were good albums and raised the game up for its time - Nothing has made a more serious change to the rap game then this album here.<br />But you know why this album is special? Because it can't be copied. No other raper has tried to in ANY way reproduce/copy/expand anthing in this album. Because they can't. Not even Nas, Jay-Z, Eminem.. no rapper can even reach this level that this album stands on. <br />People often refer to this album as \\"its own pedistool\\" - it's just ranked in its own leauge, and it will always be there.<BR>Heres a few reasons why, in my opinion:<br />1. This is the best production I have ever heard in any rap album. Period. Not even Dre could come close to something like this. The beats are raw - not overley done - not overley mastered and loud - and are just... raw. Hard. Eerie. Spooky. (Bomb First, Hail Mary, Life of an Outlaw, Against all Odds)<br />2. The lyrics are just awesome. Imagine \\"Illmatic\\" but at a whole new different level. The metaphors in this album are just incrediable (Me and my Girlfriend, Blasphemy). There intese, angry, and poetic at the same time. Makaveli in this first track, our-right calls out rappers. Saying they are phoney, and just need to leave the rap game before he puts them out. This man had honestly no fear. He would go at anyone - they were all fake in his eyes. <br />3. Like I said earlier in my review - nothing in this album can be reproduced. I have yet to hear any other rapper try to put out something this deep. Oh sure... there are some pretty intelligent rappers out there - but they are not emotionally deep like Pac was. This album was (and probably still is) WAY beyond its time. It was beyonds it time for 2pac, and beyonds it time for hip-hop in general. It's not a popular album. Its not a commercialised album either - Because this is an album that is way ahead of that. It's a personalalbum, that you have to listen to.
0316666343|4.0|I dont find the time to read many books, but when it came to The Lovely Bones, I couldn't stop reading it!  I bought the book on a Saturday and had it finished by Monday (which for me is fast considering it takes me 10 minutes to read a stop sign :-).  I was,however, also disappointed in the ending.  I was hoping it would give relief to some people who found themselves in the same situation as the Salmon's, but I guess it was more about Susie's view from her heaven and not about the reality of catching her killer.   <BR>All in all I think it was a great read and highly recommend it.

B00005JLSE|4.0|The marvelous movie musical \\"Chicago\\" is finally out on DVD, though fans of the Oscar-winning film might be more than just a little disappointed with its poor treatment in regards to DVD-extras and behind-the-scenes material.  Despite this, it is very much worth owning.<br />Hollywood has a notorious track record of butchering popular Broadway musicals when transferred to the silver screen.  What musical theatre fan doesn't cringe the atrocities of \\"A Chorus Line,\\" or, dare I say, \\"Evita\\"?  Luckily, this particular musical-to-film translation is completely on target.  Under the direction of Broadway director/choreographer Rob Marshall, the film of \\"Chicago\\" remains mostly faithful to the original 1975 production and the 1996 Broadway revival.<br />I will spare you a synopsis of this film.  What I will say, though, is that \\"Chicago\\"-set in the roaring twenties-is a brilliant satire of our modern-day obsession with the proverbial \\"media-circus\\" and the criminals that become celebrities as a result.  While it may seem an old, tired satire, this film treats it with such freshness and relevance.  <br />Rob Marshall's experience in New York theatre lends itself well to the film.  His concept of vacillating between reality and the fantasy taking place in Roxie's mind solved the ever-persistent dilemma of so-called \\"stagey\\" musical numbers-present in several past movie musicals.  Almost all of the numbers take place onstage in a theatre somewhere in the recesses of Roxie's imagination, with the exception of \\"All That Jazz\\" (which appears as Velma's nightclub act) and another at the end of the film.  Both work well in reality and fit with Marshall's concept.<br />Renée Zellweger hits the spot as Roxie Hart, a wannabe chorus girl that murders her lying boyfriend Fred Casely.  While Zellweger is not the strongest singer/dancer (she had no prior vocal or dance experience before \\"Chicago\\"), she acquits herself well enough.  It also gives a new dimension to the character, sayingthat maybe Roxie really doesn't have the real talent to be a real vaudeville star.  Catherine Zeta-Jones hoofs and belts her way through the role of Velma Kelly-an already established vaudeville star that commits double homicide on her sister and husband.  Zeta-Jones' smoldering, sexy performance of \\"All That Jazz\\" and the energetic \\"I Can't Do It Alone\\" are two great highlights!  Richard Gere combines charm and sleaze as defense attorney Billy Flynn, singing in three tough numbers, and proving himself as a tap-dancer.  Rapper Queen Latifah is a revelation as Matron Mama Morton.  Channeling Sophie Tucker, Latifah knocks your socks off in her rollicking (and quite \\"busty\\") rendition of \\"When You're Good to Mama\\" and is aggressive in her portrayal of a prison matron that believes in \\"quid pro quo.\\"  In the role of Roxie's mechanic husband Amos, John C. Reilly sings his single number \\"Mr. Cellophane\\" with a sadness and brimming anger that breaks your heart.  Amos is the moral center in a story where the good guy is the loser, while all the corrupt people are the winners.<br />Other mention must be made for Christine Baranski in the re-vamped role of reporter Mary Sunshine, a clever sob-sister.  Director Marshall made smart, if brief, use of five female performers in the roles of accused murderesses in the Cook County Jail.  Among them is R&B singer Mya (credited here as Mya Harrison), Deidre Goodwin (a veteran of the Broadway revival of \\"Chicago\\") and ballerina Ekaterina Ctchelkanova.<br />For such a good film, I am disappointed to say that the DVD presentation is not up to snuff.  Besides the essential English audio and subtitles, what you get is a behind-the-scenes special, running commentary from the director and screenwriter Bill Condon, a deleted scene (with or without director/screenwriter commentary), Spanish subtitles, and a French Language track.  <br />The behind-the-scenes special, while informative, gets plodding after about ten minutes.  The deleted scene, \\"Class,\\" is nice to have, but it is clear that the number wouldn't have worked in the final cut of the film-and Rob Marshall explains exactly why.  The film's commentary is quite insightful, anecdotal and worth listening to for an hour and forty minutes.  The Spanish subtitles, while advertised on the DVD packaging, don't seem to appear whenever selected.  A most amusing feature is the French Language track with dialogue AND songs dubbed by French actors and singers.  The last time I've found this was with \\"The Sound of Music.\\"<br />While these features are satisfying, there was so much more that they could have included.  I can recall several specials on television in relation to this film, as well as special features that could be accessed online from users of the soundtrack recording.  A rumor has been circulating through the internet that a special edition 2-DVD set is to be released at a later date.  Even if it means shelling out more money, I hope this does happen and that it is an improvement over the lack of features for a film that was such a critical, awards and box-office success.<br />I give the film 5 stars, but the features only 3 stars, which averages out to 4 stars overall.  I recommend this DVD regardless of the lack of features.  It is still a great addition to musical theatre lovers as well as those who simply enjoyed the film.
B0000542DH|4.0|To clear something up that bothers me after reading the other reviewers comments. This film is about a married duo of SPREE KILLERS. Many have made comments about how Mickey and Mallory (central characters) are serial killers or mass murderers. A complete misconception. Serial murderers choose their victims sometimes randomly, sometimes selectively but their is nearly always a purpose. However, mass murderers are different they kill large amounts of people. An entire family for example. A spree killer travels, usually cross country killing anyone & everyone they come into contact with. Of course, I'm not here <BR>to compare and contrast each of these types of killers, I am here to write a review.<br />Natural Born Killers is yet another fun filled, violent ride through the artistic mind of one of the industry's top film makers, Quentin Tarantino (screenplay), and the artistically driven directorial effort of Qliver Stone. Unfortunately, a great film such as this can even have its share of problems. <BR>One such problem is the creative struggle between these two filmmakers which can be seen if you read the original script <BR>a very different movie. Tarantino removed his name from the credits due to this. They really must have butted heads for something like this to have happened. This can also be seen while watching Stone's version (movie today) it doesn't feel like a Tarantino piece. The direction is too artsy for the<BR>old fashioned dialogue and action Tarantino weaves together.<br />To be blunt it is too weird even compared to what Tarantino normally does. This is no Pulp Fiction or even True Romance.<br />As far as the actual intent of the film's meaning, the best <BR>way to sum it up is how it depicts how the media controls <BR>its viewers. How the media always manages to involve itself<BR>into everything. How the media uses its coverage to twist <BR>the emotions of its viewers. How something so violent and so disturbing can suddenly become such a mockery whenthe media gets ahold of it. The film makes the media out to be what it <BR>is... a carnival attraction! And does a damn good job at it.<br />As far as the performances, they are some of the best I have seen from these smaller, often media bashed actors. They all give solid performances, yes even Rodney Dangerfield who has only had one decent performance in his career (Caddyshack). <br />As far as the cinema work, although sometimes too artsy for <BR>me it is some of Stone's best. The (original) screenplay is excellent and the revised one is pretty good too, not much changed. The biggest change is the ending of the film Stone completely changed it I won't spoil it. See it then read it!<br />So, in closing NBK is one of the best films of its genre. I would have loved to be able to seen Tarantino's version and compare how drastically different each would be on film. Oh<BR>well, at least, I can kick back and read the script & watch <BR>the movie to get the whole picture. <br />Reviewer advice: Get the film, then buy the original script<BR>released through Grove Press Books. Check Amazon for a copy<BR>of yours today!<br />Other films I recommend: Killing Zoe, Thursday, Love & A .45

Gradually, hearing Lose Yourself, Run Rabbit, 8 Miles & running Jay Z, Battle, Places to go - Eminem is a 'Rare' Choice Pick. Eminem has 'hardcore lyrics' and the words spill out emotions, experiences with the harmonious music beats in the background. 'Eminem's this pick is 'Lose Yourself Free' - grabbing opportunity, rap, hip hop and freak free to 'Whack, scrap' yet enjoy the stuff - cool Rap!

B00005JKZV|5.0|Let me begin by saying this is a superb film.<br />I did prefer the Fellowship of the Ring.  I thought the first film was paced better, more emotionally powerful, and a more coherent storyline but I do acknowledge it was much easier to translate to screen than The Two Towers.  And I have to admit that my opinion is not shared by many of my peers.<br />The whole film slowly builds tension which ends in a climactic battle scene at Helms Deep.  There's a few changes to the story which the purists won't like (mainly surrounding the Arwyn/Eowyn/Aragon scenario), but I think they all work well cinematically.  Also a portion of the story has been moved to the third film - so don't expect Shelob in this one.<br />I own both editions of The Fellowship of the Ring and while I enjoyed the extended version, the cinema release I thought was a much tighter film.  I can't comment on The Two Towers extended edition, but based on my past experience I'd say - If you're buying because you love tolkein, get the extended edition.  And if you're buying because you love film, get the cinema release.  Or ideally buy both if you can afford to.<br />I have no doubts the third installment will also be a fantastic film and I sincerely hope that the series gets some recognition from the Academy.  Speculative fiction movies have never done well at the Oscars but if there's one series that really does deserve to pave the way, its this one.  Hats off to Mr Jackson and team, hope they get the recognition they deserve.

B00008S2VG|4.0|I'm a fan of Madonna's music and, although I like this album, it is not as good as I expected it to be. Her albums Ray Of Light, Music, and Like a Prayer were far better. Some of the songs on this album don't seem to have much meaning or appeal to them. Bottom line, the album is good, but only mediocre for someone like Madonna.<br />This is how I rate the songs (ten being the best):<br />American Life- (7/10) Not really anything special, except for the rap, the beat is good though.<BR>Hollywood- (7/10) I think this song is good because the words mean something and the music is pretty cool.<BR>I'm So Stupid- (5/10) Honestly, I really cannot stand this song. I think the actual song is kind of obnoxious and the beat really bothers me. I have to say this song is what it's called, &quot;stupid.&quot;<BR>Love Profusion- (9/10) This is one of my favorite songs on the album. It's really catchy, and I like how it really changes styles of music throughout the song. <BR>Nobody Knows Me- (8/10) I can't say I really like techno music, but this song makes me want to. The lyrics are really great.<BR>Nothing Fails- (10/10) Out of all the songs on this album, this one is the best. I love this song. The lyrics are well written, &quot;Nothing fails, no more fears, nothing fails, you washed away my tears&quot; and the backround singers add a lot to the song, as well as the music. All put together it's an amazing combination.<BR>Intervention- (8/10) The lyrics in this song are complex and meaningful. The music has a steady beat and all together it's a pretty good song.<BR>X-Static Process- (10/10) This is another one of my favorite songs on the album. It's not complicated, it's just a simple melody but the lyrics are deep and Madonna makes this work really well.<BR>Mother &amp; Father- (8/10) Simply put, this song is nothing special. The music and beat is not original and it sounds like everything else on the album. I gave it an eight because the lyrics are pretty powerful, but that's the only reason.<BR>Die Another Day- (8/10) This song is extremly catchy, and the beat and music are pretty cool. <BR>Easy Ride- (8/10) I like this song because it's toned down and it's a great finish to this album.<br />This album is good, but not great. I think it's a great beginning for Madonna really giving her own meaning to her songs though, and I can't wait to see what her next album is like. Basically, if you like Madonna, buy the album, but if you haven't listened to her before, buy a different one like &quot;Ray Of Light&quot; or &quot;Music.&quot;
B00006879E|5.0|This disc was amazingly surprising.  It provided good, swinging funk tunes.  Strongly recommended, especially if you like Jason Mraz and John Mayer.
B00005JLTN|4.0|Alright, look the first matrix is my second favorite film of all time.  I mean what didn't it have? It had amazing graphics, a great plot, the best action sequences I've ever seen in any movie, and for god sakes...it revolutionized the visual effects industry.  And I was waiting for the sequal for months, a week before hand I had reserved tickets....and I went to see it, and how does it start...great, it's so cool...however, once they arrive at the orgy/techno scene, as I refer to it, where keanu and carrie are making love, that scene is lost in an otherwise five star film, it is unneccessary to the premise of the movie, and takes away from it.  Also some of the computer graphic shots in the movie are a little obvious, however...the plot is amazing, and so is the ending...it just leaves u wanting more.   This is a definite must see...and for anybody who has seen the first matrix 3 times or more, a definite must buy...there are some amazing characters in there...the ghosts, that french guy...haha, \\"I love cursing in french, it is like wiping ur ass with silk\\", and of course...the best part of the whole film is that Neo can freaking fly, how cool is that??  And what an amazing way to save trinity's life. Sure there are the annoying things like agent smith's repetiveness...we get the idea ok, he can go into other people, and duplicate himself....but if u want a movie that u can watch over and over and enjoy over and over, if you want a movie with an amazing soundtrack, great acting, some wisdom, and most importantly...a movie that will make you think, and leaves you gripping...this is your movie my friend.  4/5 stars...and that's all folks!!!
B00005JLRT|2.0|Anyone who's seen the movie Adaptation should understand why this edition of Star Trek took the route it did.  In order to appeal to a wide audience, there are certain things your movie must have.  Crazy action sequences with slow motion and car chases, gratuitous sex, whatever.  Basically all the things the Next Generation series never had.  <br />What the writers/director of this movie don't seem to realize is that people who never liked Star Trek in the first place would probably not be lured to see this because of the blockbuster cliches it employs; the biggest fans of the TV show will be the ones who see the movies.  But with this movie, many of the people who never cared about Star Trek will still not care about it, and many of the diehard TNG fans will feel like their favorite show sold out.  I'm part of the latter group.<br />I feel bad for the actors from the series, who had to act way out of character for much of it.  They did a good job with their roles, which is why I gave this two stars.  The movie was also fairly entertaining, loyal to the series or not.  But the movie is stupid.  It was nice that Riker and Troi got married in the beginning, but that served to have nothing to do with the rest of the movie.  Picard speeding around in the buggy was awful.  The sex scene between Riker and Troi was totally unnecessary (even though they did manage to fit the story into it- but they could've done it without the sex).  And I've never been big into Star Wars, but even I could recognize what action scenes they stole from it.<br />I wouldn't recommend paying to see this movie, but if you want something light and it happens to be on TV, it's worth a viewing I suppose.  I just wish it had better writing.
B00005JKZV|5.0|Look...you know it was amazing.  BETTER THAN THE FIRST EVEN...and who wants to get the longer version? I mean I agree that parts of it are better, but...you want both trust me!  What an amazing film, they captured Golem perfectly.  I love the scene where he is talking to himself, god...and what a huge film too, the scale at which this was made is gigantic.  I love every scene in this movie, every line.  The speech by Sam at the end is maybe the best cinematic speech I've ever heard, the way it's edited...it's amazin.  It makes me cry everytime I see it.  And such amazing dialogue, this film is monumental, twice what the first one was....THIS IS A MUST BUY!!  Please...if you don't already have it, buy it..I know I have.
B00005N5S5|4.0|In 2029 Los Angeles, where human and robots do battle, the androids send an uncompromising and unstoppable killing-machine (Arnold Schwarzenegger), back to the year 1984. He has been programmed to kill the woman who will give birth to the leader of the human resistance, Sarah Connor (Linda Harrison), thus changing the future. The humans send back a rebel soldier Kyle Reese (Michael Bihen) to protect Sarah.<br />Executed in a vigorous and action-packed manner, \\"The Terminator\\" is excellent (and violent) entertainment. The most notable scene is the police station massacre. Arnold Schwarzenegger gives a laconic, chilling performance. <br />Overall rating: 4 stars<br />Rated R for strong violence, a scene depicts surgical treatment of an eye, language, nudity, and some sexual encounters.
B00006AW2M|5.0|The Stones rock, anything by The Stones is worth 5 stars.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|Being a long time Neil Young fan and owning a good part of his collection of recordings, I can safely say that Neil has created another gem in his portfolio of musical explorations.  This is a truly inspired piece of work.  The CD flows like a musical book about a place called Greendale and the characters who inhabit it.  Neil shines as the storyteller for this piece using both singing and voice characterizations and his always excellent guitar work to give life to the story and the characters who inhabit the mythical town of Greendale.  My first listening of this CD was in my car on the way to work so I didn't hear the whole piece from start to finish.  Musically, the CD shines with the presence of the always stellar backing of the members of Crazy Horse and of course the electric renderings of Neil's guitar.  But it wasn't until I viewed the included DVD, (nice touch Neil!), and heard Neil's explanation of the story about Greendale that I really got a chance to hear the complete piece.  Each songs flows like a chapter in a book, with the various characters popping in and out of each verse.  Another very strong plus of the DVD is that you get to hear Neil do it acoustically which lends a different flavor to the story, but does not diminish the musical power of each of the songs. All in all, a great recording that all true Neil Young fans will enjoy.  This is a must have!!
B0000A02TZ|4.0|Pivked the DVD up today, it's good but was hard to find, It was also offsetting to find there are no inserts with the DD, I would think a chapter list or look back by John Landis would have been great, oerall a great ovie with a funny Mockumentry and a good real look at behind the cameras.....<br />Still haven;t gotten through the special Features.....<br />TOGA! TOGA! TOGA! TOGA! TOGA!<br />Solid Disc but needs a insert, a handy fellow could make there own (like me) but why go to the trouble.<br />I guess Universal has some other specialer version for the 30th anniversary.<br />I gie it a 7.
B000088E6M|5.0|Album from decent rapper with some of the best production out there right now (Dr. Dre).  This will end up being an essential recording, unless 50 Cent can make one better and more media friendly than this one.  The only bad thing about the album is the violence.  Rap music needs no more violence.  Get this album for its musical quality, but don't do the things that the album talks about.
B000050XEI|4.0|I love this CD.  I've given almost half the tracks (five) excellent ratings, while two more get really good ratings.  Of the remaining four tracks, two get good ratings and, unfortunately, two get merely OK ratings (that's why I can't give the overall CD an Excellent).  In general, Enya manages to do this by producing beautiful, calming music that doesn't just fade into the background (which those two &quot;OKs&quot; do).  It stays in the foreground and makes you listen to it.  My specific track ratings are:<br />1. A Day Without Rain -- 5 Stars<BR>2. Wild Child -- 5 Stars<BR>3. Only Time -- 5 Stars<BR>4. Tempus Vernum -- 2 Stars<BR>5. Deora Ar Mo Chroi -- 2 Stars<BR>6. Flora's Secret -- 4 Stars<BR>7. Fallen Embers -- 3 Stars<BR>8. Silver Inches -- 5 Stars<BR>9. Pilgrim -- 4 Stars<BR>10. One By One -- 5 Stars<BR>11. Lazy Days -- 3 Stars
0767903862|5.0|This is the fourth book I've read by Bryson and it's my favorite so far. The titular country is Australia and Bryson clearly loves the country even though he repeatedly reminds you that it can be very dangerous. Of the ten most dangerous snakes in the world, all ten are Australian. And then there's the lethal Red Back spider, the deadly blue-ringed octopus, and box jellyfish, perhaps the most feared animal of all. One expert had his wrist accidentally brush up a small bit of tentacle and described it has being akin to having a lit cigarette held to your skin for at least 30 seconds. Bill Bryson is often amusing and I found myself chuckling aloud in several places. And the book, like the country, is fascinating. As Bryson says, it's an interesting place. The Outback is one of the largest, hottest, deadliest places to find yourself but had countless explorers taking trips into it. Temperatures within can reach 140 degrees Fahrenheit. You can get literally cooked in there. I usually gravitate towards fiction but this is one of the more gripping non-fiction books I've come across. Whether he's relating a curious anecdote, or kvetching about the tedious aspects of travel, Bryson is always entertaining.
B000002KOO|5.0|In the late 70s, Fleetwood Mac were an accomplished pop band. They featured such talents as Stevie Nicks and also released the third best-selling pop/rock album of all time-&quot;Rumours.&quot; Yet due to their immense popularity during those years, earlier versions of the Mac have often been overshadowed. The original version of the band may not be to everyone's taste, but for some, &quot;Then Play On&quot; may actually win over some new fans that were just never into the &quot;Rumours&quot; era of the band. While I love Fleetwood Mac in all of their forms, &quot;Then Play On&quot; is admittedly for a different audience than their best known period. It shows the band in the late 60s, when they were an accomplished blues band, and not an accomplished pop band. At this point in their career, they were instead lead by the enigmatic blues guitarist Peter Green, whose work shines on this album. While many would argue that Clapton was a superior white blues guitarist at the same time, I still have a soft spot for the beautiful and melancholy guitar work that Green plays on this album. This style would stick with him into his solo career after leaving Fleetwood Mac when this album was completed. I would recommend &quot;Then Play On&quot; and Green's solo work (if you like one, you are sure to like the other) if you are into other 60s bands that fused blues with rock. Other similar examples of this style would include Clapton's work in bands like Cream and Blind Faith at that time.
B00003CXXP|3.0|(This is really worthy of 3½ stars, but such a rating is not available.)<br />Talk to anybody who has seen this movie, and chances are fair that you'll encounter a pretty strong opinion.  My own experience have been opinions that are not so good.<br />Yes, it is long.  Yes, it is (at times) tedious.  It's also a beautiful visual experience, a fairy tale, and a movie that sticks with you.<br />Osment is perfect here-- the odd combination of robotic and human as the role requires.  Jude Law is a hoot-- a character you hate for his seediness but enjoy for his humanity (though he too is a robot).<br />The story is not an uplifting one, but challenges the mind.  In a manner similar to \\"Sling Blade\\" we see how society's normalcy is often anything but, and the seemingly lesser individuals in society are left to expose its shortcomings in their fates.<br />I suppose a lot of people could draw different lessons and different interpretations from this movie.  I tried not to think about what it was attempting to say too much and instead took it in as a futuristic fairy tale, albeit a dark one.  To this end, it succeeds.  You're haunted by the Osment's character and genuinely desire success for him on his journey.  The ending delivers-- successfully in my opinion-- a somewhat satisfactory conclusion without alienating the audience with one that is too sappy and unreasonable.
B0000AOV85|4.0|Pink Floyd's masterpiece &quot;The Dark Side Of The Moon&quot; is one of rock music's all-time greatest albums. Thirty years after its initial release in 1973, the album is still embraced my music fans and continues to find an audience with each passing generation. Without a doubt, &quot;The Dark Side Of The Moon&quot; is simply a modern rock 'classical' piece, one that will probably continue to be listened to for centuries to come.<br />Recently released is the &quot;Classic Albums&quot; documentary DVD which gives an slightly in-depth look at this historic album. Included are interviews with all four Pink Floyd members sharing their thoughts and inspirations for certain tracks on the album. Also interviewed are recording engineer Alan Parsons, mixing supervisor Chris Thomas, album cover designer Storm Throrgeson and Rolling Stone Magazine editor David Fricke.<br />Engineer Alan Parsons as well as Floyd guitarist David Gilmour take us into the control room and dissect the pieces &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Money&quot;, &quot;Us and Them&quot;, &quot;Breathe&quot;, &quot;On the Run&quot; and &quot;The Great Gig in The Sky&quot; from their original multitrack tapes. These parts of the documentary are the most revealing and appealling. Also included are acoustic solo performances from David Gilmour performing &quot;Breathe&quot;, Roger Waters performing &quot;Money&quot; and &quot;Brain Damage&quot; and Richard Wright performing &quot;Us and Them&quot; and &quot;the Great Gig In the Sky&quot;.<br />While this DVD does not show absolutely everything there is to know about &quot;The Dark Side Of the Moon&quot;, it still is a fascinating look at this timeless classic. Some missing information docks this DVD from a five-star rating however, it certainly does not disappoint.
B00005J4HH|5.0|Their first album was awesome, but this album is brilliant.  Matt Bellamys voice is amazing I've never heard any one sing the way he can.  This album is harder than their first.  My favorite song on the album is &quot;citizen erased&quot; not only does it have a great name, but it's one of the greatest songs ever.  Every song grabs you, and doesn't let go to the record is over.
B00007JVBI|3.0|I am not sure what was going trough people's heads when they reviewed this CD and complained because they didn't know what they were getting into. This is the weakest leg for an opinion to stand on because, first of all, you should at least have SOME idea of what you are about to BUY is consisting of, and secondly, there are freaking samples, beyond this web-site's meager offerings, all over the net to allow you to form an educated laud or chaff. For me, someone who pays attention BEFORE pressing &quot;pay now&quot;, this album's sound represents a problem with with most recording artist's works that follow the first. A progression into songs slightly more hollow, slightly more digestable, and slightly less intriguing. Collaborations turn out, most often, to be a pitfall as well. They should only make it to the record if it culminates in something augmentative, not something that homogenizes the intent or utterly fails, which is what has sadly happened on a few of the tracks. Seriously, Dave Grohl on drums? He could barely play for Nirvana. On the positive side, Ms. Power, as one of the ignorants put her, retains her personal, intimate honesty with every song she writes. That rarity alone merits a dive in this ever-wideningly public pool.
B0000AI44Q|3.0|Well,Neil give us Greendale,and im just a little disapointed about it.The old formula of creating his song,are just a bit boring.But we have good songs:Bandit and Be the Rain.<BR>Is just a good album with a few good songs.The Horses are a limited band,but Neil have make good albuns with there.So i have to wait until Neil realese another On the Beach or Comes a Time.
B00006F83Y|4.0|Best metallic 'stoner' rock since Nevermind. Period. Superb manic drumming by Dave Grohl, massive crunchy guitars and even an appearance by Ween's Dean Ween.<br />Now, what every reviewer fails to mention (that said I haven't read all the reviews) is that after the Victorian chamber music sounding hidden Mosquito song, there's another hidden track. It's a cover of Everybody's Gonna Be Happy by The Kinks, and it adds a funny party tone to a collection of mostly serious tracks.<br />At least it was included on my copy, bought in Australia.<br />SPACE TRUCKIN'!
6304057709|5.0|I haven't read any Jane Austen, for which I fervently apologize, but the early nineteenth century is well captured in the scenes in both countryside and London, as well as the costumes.<br />The Dashwood family, the mother and three daughters Elinor, Marianne and Margaret, has fallen on hard times due to their residence at Norland being given to eldest son John and his wife Fanny following the death of Mr Dashwood.  Consequently, they are reduced to being visitors.<br />Edward Farris (Hugh Grant) is very soft-spoken and kind of wooden, yet he is more sensitive to the Dashwood's plight than his sister Fanny.  He is talented at being tactful and clever, given the way he draws out the youngest sister Margaret, ever hiding in her treehouse and under furniture.  He is described as being loyal to a commitment, refusing to go back on one's words.  Honourable traits indeed for a gentleman.  He wants to be in a parish in the quiet countryside, hating London and its lack of peace, but his families has high expectations for him.<br />The eldest sister Elinor (Emma Thompson) is quite taken by Edward but she has suppressed any feelings by seeing things sensibly, perhaps to the point of being denied happiness.  After all, any future between them is hampered by their social standing.  The Dashwoods have fallen down in status, and Edward would stand to be disinherited if he married beneath his station.<br />Marianne (Kate Winslet) though does not find Edward too passionate.  There's something wanting in him, \\"too sedate\\", as she tells Elinor.  \\"To love is to burn, to be on fire, like Juliet, or Guinevere, or Heloise.\\"  A tried and true romantic, and thus the one I connect to the most.  She would definitely take issue with Fanny saying \\"Love is all very well, but unfortunately, we can't all rely on the heart to lead us in the most suitable direction.\\"  She falls for Willoughby, a gentleman of ostensiblu good standing, and despite the short time between them, believes that \\"time alone does not determine intimacy.\\"  She also wishes Elinor would be less restrained.  \\"Always resignation and acceptance.  Always prudence and honor and duty.  Where is your heart?\\"<br />The youngest Margaret, is twelve, and is in a world of her own, reading atlases, living in a tree house, and imagining many scenarios, including herself being a captain of an expedition.  I was like that when I was young, and I was simply enchanted.<br />Their move to Barton Cottage, on the estate of Mother Dashwood's cousin Sir John (Robert Hardy of All Creatures Great And Small) and his mother-in-law Ms. Jennings (Elizabeth Spriggs) proves to be a curse and a blessing, the former because of the impossibility of keeping secrets, especially with a cheery Ms. Jennings.<br />The social class strictures, such as marrying within one's own class, money and breeding being the important factors, the concept of primogeniture may seem dated today, but the hopes of escaping those strictures, or any strictures imposed in any time makes this movie and the novel relevant today.<br />All the performers are wonderful here.  However, it's interesting to see Hugh Laurie (Jeeves and Wooster, Blackadder), usually so full of goofy wackiness playing it so tempered and buttoned down as Palmer, and he does it well.  It's a joy to see Kate Winslet as the romantic Marianne, before she plunged into fame in Titanic.  Alan Rickman does wonders as the ever-brooding but understanding Colonel Brandon, whose face belies a pained past.  He even tells Elinor that maybe it's better for Marianne not to learn the ways of the world, that it's better for her not to hide her emotions, and is well aware of the \\"impolitic cruelty in dividing two young people long attached to one another.\\"<br />Despite Marianne's travails, I say it's better to use one's heart and not one's head for one's destiny.  After all, \\"can the soul really be satisfied with such polite affections?\\"  I feel not so.e does not determine intimacy.\\"  She also wishes Elinor would be less restrained.  \\"Always resignation and acceptance.

B000000OUJ|5.0|Yo, check this one out.  GZA comes correct,the beats and lyrics are tight, and all the guest appearances fit into the ablum.  The Genius takes hip hop to a whole 'nother level.  When you listen to this album, you don't skip around, just let it play.
B00003CY6M|4.0|In my humble opinion, thats what its all about. Congratulations to the entire cast and crew of Serendipity. The film has become an instant favorite of mine since I first saw it. People forget sometimes that you cant cheat destiny, or karma, and this movie does a great job of illustrating that fact. It seems predictable at times simply because thats how fate works...If it is meant to be it will be. There are several little quarky moments in this movie that simply make you feel lucky that alls not terrorism, bombs and carnage. Serendipity may not be the greatest film of all time, nor may go down as the 4 main actor's best works, but its truly a shining example that simple light-hearted fun movies have a place, especially in these times today we live in. Who says you need layers upon layers of plots and twists and sub-plots to make great on screen magic, all you need are stars in the sky, the cute inspective look from that one special person, and the kinetic energy of a New York romance. Jeremy Piven, who's character literally cements the entire chemistry, delivers several great memorable quotes, as well as the rarely mentioned mock obituary near the end that grabs you, and lightly sets up that rendezvous with fate. Kate Beckinsale delivers such coy cuteness, and charming intelligence in her role in this film, and who can deny John Cusack his crafted talent for being the &quot;likeable guy&quot; the kind of guy we all know, who's just plain normal, often confused and sincere in his awkward way? It's not the most perfect depiction of how Serendipity can rise and touch two people in love, but its just one of the ways it can, and may have. With love, and destiny, anything's possible. With &quot;Serendipity&quot; everything's possible. I've witnessed it myself, which is another reason I am so fond of this film. All I can ask is for you to suspend all the doubts and cynicism, get the one you love, and watch this film together and pick out the little quarky things in it youtwo can relate to..I do it all the time.
B00009V7RF|4.0|Not your usual BEP record. Nope that is the case. But Nevertheless its a fantastic album. This is a new direction for them but...to all those people who say this aint BEP, i say well some things change. And BEP have obviously gone down another road this time. Tracks like Smells Like Funk, Hey Mama Fly Away, Hands Up...new BEP. But it certainly aint bad.<br />I mean come on guys....stop bein so harsh....they gotta be doing somat right, the only evidence needed to that is to just listen to &quot;Where is the Love&quot;....what a song.

Ever turn present a fresh scene that takes your breath away.  Middle Earth creatures once in our hearts and minds, come to life with such accuracy, feeling, and emotion ... it makes you wonder whether your in the movie.  Helms Deep was a battle that lores are made of ... and people will recall this battle sequence well into future generations.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|I'm going to take a controversial stand right from the start and say that &quot;Greendale&quot; is Neil's masterpiece. If a masterpiece is defined as the culmination of an artist's talents and career, then I don't think I'm exagerating. There have been some upset fans saying how dare Neil play an entire new set on tour, but don't judge until you have heard this story.  The classic Crazy Horse heavy, distorted groove grabs you in &quot;Falling from Above&quot;, and Neil starts by saying &quot;Seemed like that guy singing there been doing it for a long time, is there anything he knows that he ain't said?&quot; He knows this album is something bigger than himself, and as he explains on the bonus DVD he would be driving to the sessions and stop along the road periodically to write lyrics. Sometimes they were there, sometimes not. But the story of the Green family came from somewhere else. It is the muse speaking through Neil, and for the first time in his career an entire album centers on the same cast of characters. The DVD is essential; it's Neil solo, acoustic, and mesmerizing, narrating the story between songs, explaining that he didn't know what was going to happen, and the band would be emotionally affected by the news he would deliver each day as the tale unfolded. That feeling is captured in the music. It's Neil and Crazy Horse at their finest, especially at the explosive finale with &quot;Sun Green&quot; and &quot;Be the Rain,&quot; two new classics that will certainly become a part of the live repertoire. In fact, the only criticism I can find is that 'Pancho' Sampedro is not a part of the band, something that might bother purists. Perhaps Neil wanted a leaner sound with just Ralph Molina and Billy Talbot acompanying his raw guitar sounds. So be it. You can't find fault with an artist who dares to surrender himself to an impulse after 30+ years of success.
B00006879E|5.0|There is so much argument in these pages about what makes a band great or whether a band sounds like another band or not.  The key to great music, no matter what genre is that it says something to somebody.  It must convey an emotion from the people playing the music to those listening.  There are infinite ways in which to do that and not everyone will agree.  If an artist can accomplish this while bringing something new to the world of music then they are all the more important.  That being said, no matter how origional or novel something sounds, it is always built on those bands that influenced them.  It is not a critisism to say you hear another bands music in a new band's, as long as those influences are used and integrated in a creative and new way then its all just part of the evolution of music.<br />That being said, let me tell you why I think Maroon 5 is so great.  1)  Maroon 5 does not deny their influences.  If anything they celebrate them.  Every song is a tip of the hat to the legends that they grew up listening to...Stevie Wonder, Herbie Hancock, Michael Jackson, Otis Redding, Destiny's Child, The Beatles.  You see those influences and many more in everything they do, but they use what they taught them and do something new and origional with it, and proudly.  2)  Maroon 5 are very creative musicians and that comes through both live and on their record.  Listen to the bass lines and the way the the bass drum perfectly mirrors the bass guitar.  It adds a power and groove to the music that isn't immediately apparent but give an extra dimension of solidness and rhythm to their grooves.  I dare you to find many other bands that tight.  Its not easy to do.  Sure, they borrowed that from old funk and some new hip hop, but these are white guys in '03 playing live instruments (its easier to synch the bass and bass drum if they are just synthesized on pro tools).  Maroon 5 adds touches like these because they add to the character of the music.  They could do iteasier and it would still sound good, but it would be missing that extra punch.  3)  Maroon 5 has lyrics that mean something.  Adams lyrics really sound like expressions of who he is and the experiences, good and bad, that he has had.  The lyrics are both catchy, yet not cliche.  4)  Yes Maroon 5's album is fairly heavily produced.  But is it to the detriment of the music?  I say no.  These are hard working musicians who want their music to be heard.  Making your album sound good is what is going to make that happen.  Sure they could play live into a single microphone in a recording studio and it would sound good, but who would play that on the radio these days or even buy that record.  Music these days is more and more produced (listen to hip hop, rap, pop and even alternative rock [listen to the likes of Radiohead or The Flamming Lips] music these days for proof).  But listen to what those artists can accomplish with that technology!  We are hearing sounds unlike any we have heard before.  Using that technology to get your music across to todays audience should not looked down upon if you are making music you love and not compromising on how you want it to sound.<br />I guess that is all I will say for now.  I just wanted to say that Maroon 5 is a great band who writes great songs and are great musicians.  I have seen their whole evolution and they keep getting better and better and experimenting with new sounds and influences.  If you haven't already, give them a try and I think you'll be hooked.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|I'm going to take a controversial stand right from the start and say that &quot;Greendale&quot; is Neil's masterpiece. If a masterpiece is defined as the culmination of an artist's talents and career, then I don't think I'm exagerating. There have been some upset fans saying how dare Neil play an entire new set on tour, but don't judge until you have heard this story.  The classic Crazy Horse heavy, distorted groove grabs you in &quot;Falling from Above&quot;, and Neil starts by saying &quot;Seemed like that guy singing there been doing it for a long time, is there anything he knows that he ain't said?&quot; He knows this album is something bigger than himself, and as he explains on the bonus DVD he would be driving to the sessions and stop along the road periodically to write lyrics. Sometimes they were there, sometimes not. But the story of the Green family came from somewhere else. It is the muse speaking through Neil, and for the first time in his career an entire album centers on the same cast of characters. The DVD is essential; it's Neil solo, acoustic, and mesmerizing, narrating the story between songs, explaining that he didn't know what was going to happen, and the band would be emotionally affected by the news he would deliver each day as the tale unfolded. That feeling is captured in the music. It's Neil and Crazy Horse at their finest, especially at the explosive finale with &quot;Sun Green&quot; and &quot;Be the Rain,&quot; two new classics that will certainly become a part of the live repertoire. In fact, the only criticism I can find is that 'Poncho' Sampedro is not a part of the band, something that might bother purists. Perhaps Neil wanted a leaner sound with just Ralph Molina and Billy Talbot acompanying his raw guitar sounds. So be it. You can't find fault with an artist who dares to surrender himself to an impulse after 30+ years of success.
B00004Z459|5.0|WHHHHHHHHHHOOOOOOOOOOOOOA!!!!!!!!!!!!!<BR>I bought this cd expecting it was junk.... But i listend to it and it was AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!

B00005AAFS|5.0|&quot;Whoa&quot; was the first thing that came out of my mouth when I turned on Mutter. I didn't really expect much, being that this was the first Rammstein CD I bought, but to my amazement the German Gods don't dissapoint in any way. &quot;Mein Herz Brennt&quot; starts off with an INCREDIBLE string section with Till softly singing along. Then, it breaks into guitars and drums playing WITH the strings. Overall an incredible effect that makes an incredible song. Next, &quot;Links 2 3 4&quot; brings on the competition with very cool guitar and an even cooler chorus. Then, the GODLIKE &quot;Sonne&quot; proves that no band in the world can pull off what these six have. &quot;Ich Will&quot; is a cool keyboard driven song mixed with guitar that ends up with a great sound altogether. &quot;Feurer Frei&quot; is basically what most people will buy the album for. Anyone who has seen Triple X, know this, (in case you didn't know already)  Rammstein was the band in the beginning and this song is what they're playing (which is nothing short of amazing). Next, the slow guitar and string driven title track shows Rammstein's softer sides as well as the very cool &quot;Spieluhr&quot; which has a GREAT chorus. &quot;Zwitter&quot; demonstrates some of the heavier areas of Rammstein along which comes out great. &quot;Rein Raus&quot; is really the only complaint I have. It's not a bad song, but it needs some work because it gets repetitive in some areas but has some cool parts which makes it still worth listening to. &quot;Adios&quot; easily makes up for this slight fault with a excellent chorus and a catchy guitar solo. Finally, the album ends with the slow and mysterious &quot;Nebel&quot; which actually comes out pretty good for an ending track (though many will probably disagree). Overall, AN INCREDIBLE third effort from the six gods of Rammstein and definitely worth buying.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I was a hugh fan of the series. Clever dialog.  Interesting storeline.   Wonderful character development.    So disappointed in the network when it pulled the show off the air.    It was very shortsighted of them.
B0000057C5|5.0|To say Sehnsucht is an incredible album is a HUGE understatement. The German masters of industrial metal are at it again following their previous stunning effort, Herzeleid. Unlike most sophomore efforts by bands, Sehnsucht comes across as a HUGE surprise. The album starts out with the AWESOME title track with a very cool middle eastern like sound effect and progresses into a cool synth and then into heavy guitar and drums. Next, the melodic \\"Engel\\" balances Till's singing with a woman's (who comes in on the chorus). Overall, a beautiful combination that makes an incredible song. After that, the very cool \\"Tier\\" begins followed by the metallic \\"Bestraffe Mich.\\" Then finally the LEGENDARY \\"Du Hast\\" plays out (and if you haven't heard this song, PLEASE LISTEN TO IT  SOMEHOW!!!) followed by the heavy \\"Buch Dich\\" and then \\"Spiel Mit Mir\\" which is probably one of the best tracks on Sehnsucht. It starts out all soft and mysterious, and builds up into a slow, heavy whirlwind of guitar and keyboard. \\"Klavier\\" balances out the CD with a peaceful guitar and beautiful chorus. \\"Alter Mann\\" starts with a cool, jungle like drum beat and quickly jumps into guitar and then goes back into the very cool jungle beat again. It's a pretty cool track. \\"Eifersucht\\" and \\"Kuss Mich\\" aren't as awesome, but still are good tracks that have pretty good choruses. Finally, for anyone who remembers the 80's band Depeche Mode, Rammstein does an AMAZING cover of \\"Stripped\\" on the hidden 12th track that ends Sehnsucht with a bang. Simply put, Sehnsucht is essential to any industrial, new metal, or hard rock fan's collection.
B00008GKEG|5.0|The opening title sequence is a perfect illustration:  Starting with a close-up of the group's icon on Ringo's bass drum, the band, as if from an ethereal plan, plays while the frame pans out.  The music gets louder but the background screaming of the crowd becomes overwhelming in intensity as the image of the band diminishes under a huge Beatles logo and their song becomes totally drowned out by the hysterical crowd:  As a pebble thrown into a still pond, the ripples expand indefinitely while the source of the energy becomes lost beneath the water.  This incredible set of live performances, video footage, interviews, and excellent digitally mastered audio recordings weaves a comprehensive portrait of the rise of the working-class bar-band from their youth through their last recordings as the Beatles.  Recent interviews intertwined with the earliest impressions of John, Paul, George, and Ringo provide a full circle perspective that is probably the best recorded compilation of a pop super-phenomenon in the 1960s.
B00008O31H|5.0|Ive been listening to The Black Keys since they were local around akron and they have to be one of my favorite bands ever. Thickfreakness has more of the rock edge (minus a few tracks, I Cry Alone is all blues) but The Big Come Up was more blues than rock, at least thats how I saw it. I give both discs 5 stars, buy them, they're great. And im not a  very big fan of The White Stripes, I dont see how The Black Keys sound anything like them.
B00005JLSE|1.0|What a piece of crap that was!!! Mis-cast is the least of it's problems and among them and but not limited to are bad dancing, bad acting, bad singing ... er ... lip-sinking e.g. Richard Gere for one. Contrary to what some reviewers have said, Fosse would NOT be proud.<br />As the two heroines in the film play the system Rob Marshall has played us . . . all for suckers.
B000002NE4|1.0|This guy sold out many years ago, unfortunately.  Like Crusty the Clown and Neil Young, Nick Cave puts his name on everything, as if the world is one big advertisement for his profit.<br />Musically this album is pretty boring, pretty boring indeed, just like all other Cave's ventures into the netherworld of goth-rock.  On the positive side, though, Cave sounds a tad more upbeat, so perhaps he's finally beaten back that hernia he's been suffering so many years.  <br />For true rock, check out the coming Limp Bizkit CD, plus I heard Van Halen has a new record coming soon.  Is Roth back in the fold this time?<br />HAVE FUN!!!!!!!!!!!
B000063CMK|5.0|Pain of Salvation are one of those rare bands who take a myriad set of influences and amalgamate them in such a way that they sound entirely fresh and original. This was the first album I heard by the band and to say I was impressed would be a severe understatement. The music is certainly progressive, but POS push the boundaries of that word in so many unexpected directions they instantly transcend any sort of categorization. If anything, I'd pin down the earlier work of Dream Theater and the entire career of manic genius Mike Patton as key touchstones, yet there's so much going on down Remedy Lane these are merely starting points. The Patton influence is most evident on the vocal delivery, on which Daniel Gildenlow truly shines. He runs the gammut from emotive crescendos, to barely audible whispers, to aggressive pseudo-rapping, all the while sounding absolutely comfortable. The music is at time grandiose and certainly epic in places ('Beyond the pale' being the epitomy of this) yet the band finds time to include far more on this seminal piece of work. 'Fandango' sounds like a more focused and very dark version of Mr Bungle at first, before exploding into some high notes from Gildenlow that are practically off the scale. 'Ending Theme' is a melodic metal effort and a standout track, with the albums strongest chorus, while 'A Trace of Blood' is my favourite track, with a manic, repetitive keyboard section underlying some huge chords, an intriguing chorus and some great lead guitar (the way the band brings the theme back after the first full chorus is genius). 'Second Love' and 'This Heart of Mine' are beautiful ballads, which some reviewers on this page appear to not like. Still, I think theyre great, allowing Gildenlow a chance to display yet another side to his toolbox of a voice. Elsewhere, 'Remedy lane' is a synthesized instrumental which recaps the albums main themes before the run in to the grand finale, 'Rope Ends' is a heavy and stacatto metal song,'Chain Sling' is effortlesly original and 'Waking every God' is another highlight, with incredible harmonies.<br />Pain of Salvation's music isnt easy to describe, but its all good. Fans of original and uncomprimising progressive metal should buy this instantly, others are advised to give it a try, you might be pleasently surprised.ing' is effortlesly original and 'Waking every God' is another highlight, with incredible harmonies.<BR>Pain of Salvation's music isnt easy to describe, but its all good.

B00008LDPU|3.0|out of all of the parts of this DVD I liked about half of it. I am a fan of Anime, but some of this was like the worst of anime. It was hard to find a coherent story in most of them, and some of the visuals were erratic. Final flight of the osiris was Beautifully rendered CGI, making me sad that there won't be another Square feature, whereas world record made no sense and could've been easily omitted to bring up the average score.<br />I know some people out there will find virtues in all of these episodes, but I stick to a score of 3 meets expectations.
B00005JKZV|5.0|Plenty of people have criticized Peter Jackson's The Two Towers movie because there are so many departures from the book, far more than in The Fellowship of the Ring. As a Tolkien fan for over thirty years, I too was dismayed at first by such interpolations as Aragorn's flirtatious moment with Eowyn over dwarf beards, or the repeated playing off of Gimli the Dwarf as the butt of numerous jokes.  But then I came to realize that any written work, even one so sumptuous as The Lord of the Rings, faces numerous difficulties in translation to the screen, and that in Peter Jackson and his team, Tolkien's masterpiece has been fortunate indeed.<br />The Two Towers is an extremely complicated work to film, split as it is between two different journeys, that of Frodo with Sam to Mordor and secondly the tangled stories of the remainder of the Fellowship.  In the movie the scene shifts back and forth, sometimes rather abruptly, but in the end it smoothly finishes off at real turning points for all the characters.  The settings are magnificent: the plains of Rohan, the tower of Orthanc, the deadly approaches to Mordor, Fangorn Forest, and the ravaged garden of Ithilien.  The action fits the settings:  huge battles and world changing decisions.  The cast fits as well, most of the familiar characters from The Fellowship of the Ring return of course, but there are many new faces, among the most appealing being Theoden King of Rohan and his nephew and niece Eomer and Eowyn. As in The Fellowship of the Ring, some of the most emotional moments come when Tolkien's own words are used, my favorite being the final scenes when Sam and Frodo laugh about the tale of Frodo and the Ring and Samwise the Brave. That emphasizes how fortunate the books were to have been filmed by a group of true Tolkien lovers.<br />The DVD contains quite a bit of interesting additional material on the making of the film, plus a peek at The Return of the King and another peek at the Extended Version, which will contain about 40 more minutes of material.  This last feature is truly fascinating, with hints of additional scenes of Pippin and Merry with Treebeard, among others.  But even if the only thing you watch is the theatrical release itself, this DVD is well worth the price!tain about 40 more minutes of material.

B000002UDD|5.0|Explosive! Aggressive! Backbraking!! So Far... So Good..So What.. is one of the greatest metal albums to ever be writen and is by far greater than any Metallica album. Dave's vocals and music perfect capture the anger and frustration in In My Darkest hour and Liar. If you are a metal fan and dont own this album it is an absolute must!!!
B0000AI44Q|4.0|Neil Young did a gutsy thing by touring behind this album months before it hit the stores.  Sure, it's not the first time he's done that, but because the story line of this concept album is fairly tough to follow at times, to present this to audiences for the first time of stage took guts.  At least I think so.<br />In concert, the audiences seemed divided.  Most wanted to hear greatest hits live, while others were digging the new material.  I think I fall in the latter category.  From the first note, I was hooked.<br />I expected the material performed in the studio to pale compared to being performed live.  But I think the material is as good on CD as it was live.  Plenty of great guitar work, Crazy Horse sounds as good as ever.  Though the sound is cleaner than usual, not as distorted and grungy.  <br />From start to finish, it's a great album.  The only weak track is &quot;Bringing Down Dinner&quot; which is performed on a pump organ.  I'm sure there's a good song in their somewhere, but the arrangement tends to bring the song down.  Weak, but not horrible.<BR>One of the best songs in &quot;Bandit,&quot; which is the only other song on the CD not performed by Crazy Horse, but is performed acoustically.<br />Lyrically, the CD is dense, somewhat obscure and it's hard to follow the story at times.  It really helps to listen to it at least once while reading the liner notes.  But the story is not so complicated that one can't at least get the gyst of it.  And even if you can't, the music is so stella that it more than makes up for it.<br />I've listened to the CD three or four times in the past week, and still love it.<br />The only reason I didn't give it five stars (I would say it's more a four and a half star album) is that there are other Neil albums that are five stars (Time Fades Away, Rust Never Sleeps, Sleeps with Angels) and I can't quite put Greendale in the same category.  Almost, but not quite.
B000088E6D|5.0|I bought this CD based totally on an E-card someone sent me with Buble's rendition of &quot;That's All&quot;...and I must say I am pleasantly surprised. This cat's got chops for one so young!<br />Although I don't agree with the selection of all the cuts (Queen's &quot;Crazy Little Thing Called Love&quot;...out of place amongst the other more classic Pop standards) the arrangements are solid and slick. Buble's vocals don't drown out the fine instrumental work here nor is it hidden by it. Nice, very nice.
1582432678|5.0|This book is intense - depressing - shocking - and I could not stop reading it.  It will stay with me a long time.  The emotions, the words, were all believable and I was swept up in the life of this mother and her &quot;demonic&quot; child.  Fascinating.
B00009L1TA|5.0|This was a great movie.  I just watched it on DVD and I was mad at myself for not going to see it at the movies.  The plot keeps you more than interested.  You feel like a detective tring to figure out the truth.  The ending was amazing.  Many movies give you an ending that is exciting, but you figure it out before the movie is over.  Trust me that is not true for this movie.  Some of the others said there were to many plots, but if you like something that will keep you guessing and engaged you will love it.  I am sure you will love this movie and never figure out the ending and it will make you watch it again.  I loved it.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|Dont get me wrong, I was a fan of Sounding the Seventh Trumpet and was impressed with the musicianship, but this album blows it away.  Its more metal, with all around better musicianship, much better guitar playing, especially the solos.  The vocals are also much less strained when he sings than on the last album.  Seriously, even with prior knowledge of the band, I put this album on and was blown away.  It is a definate must have of anyone into metal or hardcore.
0780620445|4.0|I enjoyed this movie for the most part. After all, it was well-acted, had beautiful music, had an uplifting, inspring ending, what's not to like, right? Well, fact is, it's been a while since I saw it, and frankly I can't remember the music, or even much of the story; so, what's left, you ask? Vivid recollections of the disturbing behavior of the characters, and a feeling of unease, and wanting to avoid watching it again. Too bad, but maybe I'll just get some of artist's music instead.
B0000A36J1|5.0|After Fellowship, I re-read the LotR Trilogy, digging it up from its place on the bookshelf for 30 years(!).. Visually, the film is a faithful recreation of Tolkien's imagination. As a two-year film project to maintain a seamless final product, the accomplishment is all the more impressive.<br />I'm not a Tolkien purist, but one significant difference between the written and filmed version is the battle at Helm's Deep in Rohan--very little (relative) treatment in the book, but, I think, absolutely essential to develop the story on film. The portrayal of Gollum in the Two Towers is a masterpiece in itself, exactly the character you'd expect from his role in the books. Sam Gamgee's character is beautifully developed to set the stage for his evolution to the Return of the King. And for their parts, Bloom and Mortenson are on their way to great careers after their portrayals in this episode.<br />It's sooo good to have Part 2 now in DVD, closing the first \\"cliffhanger\\" from memory. And, it is seamless, with flawless continuity.<br />Why the films didn't clean up in the Academy Awards is beyond me. But then, they weren't filmed in Hollywood...
B0000A02TZ|1.0|The movie is an absolute classic, BUT this DVD forces you to watch several minutes of commercials at the beginning with NO way to skip them.  I don't mind if they have the commercials, just give me the ability to skip them....bad marketing IMO.<br />I think I'm going to buy the out-of-print version of this DVD from eBay.
0385504209|4.0|When I first started reading the book, I was quickly absorbed in its pages and couldn't put it down. I loved the plot, learning more about the Holy Grail and all these societies that really existed. I can't say that Brown is an extraordinary writer literary style-wise, but his plot is brilliantly created.I have to say though, that I predicted some of the mysteries that he created and when I found I was right, I was ironically disappointed because that meant that he wasn't that great of a writer like I thought. However, this book is an overall great triller and thoguh I don't plan on reading any other of Brown's books, I definitely recommended buying this one! I did not give the book 5 stars just because I felt that the book could have been better written, not plot wise but with richer language.
B00005RRG9|5.0|I love this movie. I remember when I was little and I saw it for the first time I loved every minnute of it. I bought the special edition 2 disc dvd set a month ago and I have already watched it 6 times. I just love this movie more than any other Disney Movie ever made.<br />Here is the main story line.<br />It stars Haley Mills as twin sisters. They meet at Camp Inch. Well when they find out that they are related they get a bond together. And they try to help bring their parents (Brian Keith, and Maureen O Hara) back together. Well at the end it works and they live happily ever after.<br />It Also Starred<br />Una Merkrel as Verbena<BR>Charlie Ruggles as Grandfather
B00005JKZV|5.0|The second part in the LOTR trilogy is just as sweeping and literate is the first.  I don't care what others say, hands down this will be the greatest trilogy ever put to film.  The DVD is certainly lacking compared to the monster special edtion that'll hit stores in the near future.  However, if you just enjoy the film and aren't concerned with spending over 30 dollars, then pick this up.
B0000399WI|5.0|The plot of this film does not sound promising.  Two guys become close friends while sharing time in a prison for twenty years.  It is also very long, clocking in at around 2 hours 20 minutes.  However, this is quite possibly the most enjoyable movie I have ever seen, with great characters and super pacing leading to a wonderful surprise ending.<br />This movie lost the best picture Oscar in 1994 to Forrest Gump.  While Tom Hanks deserved the best Actor award that year, that movie was no where near as good as this one.  Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, a Maine Banker who is falsly convicted of the double murder of his wife and her lover.  He is sent to Shawshank Prison for two life sentences, one for each victim.<br />Early in his stay, he meets &quot;Red&quot; (Morgan Freeman) who has already logged twenty years there and is turned down for parole when we first meet him.  Red is the man who has the connections to get anything the prisoners want, for a price.  He actually has no respect for Andy when he first sees him, but eventually they become very close.<br />The movie is fantastic in the way it sets up the personalities of the various characters in just a few scenes.  Both the warden and the head guard are extremely evil men, yet we don't see them more than in just a few scenes.  Their characters are established early and we grow to hate them almost immediately.<br />The ending has several parts and it is great.  It may be one of the most complete surprise endings ever, several strands in the story seem to come together at once.  Should have been best picture.
B000002AVF|5.0|\\"Daydream,\\" in my opinion, is one of, if not the most creative and pleasant albums she has recorded to date. This album was recorded in her pre-breathy R&B days, and thus most of the singing and song writing is her own. Now, don't get me wrong, I am still as big of a fan as ever, but this album still stands as her shinning achievement.
6304712936|5.0|How did Mozart die?  Was he murdered?  Was Antonio Salieri responsible?  These questions will never be answered.  The great film, Amadeus, does not even try.  It presents Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce) as a punk kid, with pink wigs and an annoying high pitch laugh, who comes to Vienna searching for work in music.<br />It's obvious immediately to Salieri (F. Murray Abraham)that Mozart is a prodigy.  However, he is appalled to see what a brat he appears to be.  Consequently, he swears to bring Mozart to ruin.  <br />It's a fact that Salieri, later in life in an insane asylum, claimed to have murdered Mozart.  Historians are split on whether this claim has any merit.  The film, as I stated, does not take a side either way.  <br />The movie is great because the characters are so fresh and fun.  Mozart is a real hoot with his laugh and Salieri's intense hatred of him is obvious.  I also love Jeffrey Jones as the Emperor (remember his failed attempts to run down Ferris Bueller).<br />No one will ever know what happened to Mozart.  This film shows us a reasonable guess at what his last 10 years were probably like.  The music is great, the acting superb, and the film was definitely deserving of its Best Film award.  I find it interesting that Abraham and Hulce, after such a great performance in such a highly publicized movie, really have slipped into oblivion.  In this film, however, they were golden.
B000069AUI|5.0|First off, I first heard colplay while working at Bestbuy, and it was yellow, off of their first album, and it was like nothing I had ever heard before, I was over taken by it and I had to have the album, Paracutes....I thought that it couldn't get any better than that, I mean I did'nt go a day without saying Coldplay atlest 5 times and certainly did'nt go a day without listening to them. When I heard \\"In my Place\\" on their new album, I said okay, the genius band Coldplay has done it again, and they have solidified themselves as one of the greatest bands ever, at lest top 5. If I had to pick 3 songs to listen to for a year straight, \\"Clocks\\" and \\" Warning Sign\\" would be 2 of them, this album is 1 of the best albums of the decade, and were only 3 years in!! COLDPLAY KEEP IT UP!!! WE CANT GET ENOUGH ...
0596000480|2.0|JavaScript is not well organized nor standardized which makes it inherently confusing to work with at an advanced level.  But the organization of this book does not help matters.  Too often I find myself with book marks in 5+ places as part of researching a fairly basic technique.  Some of the examples are overly complex and not real-world.  If your customer is standardized on IE 6.0 there are some things missing (contenteditable and document.selection for example).  The subtitle &quot;The Definitive Guide&quot; may not be warranted.
0385335482|4.0|i loved this book, full of witty characters, charm, and humor, i laughed at every turn of the page, and the other two books are even better. you must read them all. i really related to the main character and her urge to shop. Great read! i suggest you buy it and add it to your personal library!
0679746048|4.0|After learning that the movie &quot;Girl,Interrupted&quot; was based on the memoir of true events in the life of Susanna Kaysen, i thought that it might be an interesting read. I was pleasently suprised at how much i enjoyed the book. Girl, Interrupted tells about the experiences of a young woman's stay at a mental institution in the late 60's, including the people she met there who changed her life. For one thing, i liked that it was a memoir as opposed to a biography. It wasn't &quot;This happened, then this happened, and then this happened,&quot; it gave the full story but not by dwelling on the exact sequence of events. At one point the author will be telling about a certain conversation she had with her roomate but in the next chapter she might be telling about when she first entered the institution. The stories had a way of making the reader feel as if he or she were a fly on the wall, a witness to the events that took place. Another reason i liked the book was that it almost made i seem as if the story could happen to anybody, that any one of us could be 'Interrupted.'

B00005JM09|2.0|There are few movie series that affect the way I view the world and how I view the so called \\"norm\\" of every day life. The Terminator movies have done more for me than just entertain me for 2 hours. Needless to say, I was overjoyed to hear that the third installment of the series was in the works. But has new news of the development came out, it seemed to progress like untreated acne; only getting worse. James Cameron not having any role in the production. Seeing as he was the man responsible for the creative magic for the first two, this was a low blow. Then the fact that Linda Hamilton (aka Sarah Connor) would not be featured or the leader of the human resistance, Edward Furlong. All this bad news badly weighed down my enthusiasm. Even then, I hoped for the best and saw the movie. Dissipointed is too strong of a word, but so is impressed. The movie had great action scenes, Arnold, and the special effect magic of Stan Winston. Then the cold realizations hit you. \\"This plot is almost totally similiar to the second one\\" , \\"The T1000 was far more deadly than the TX\\", \\" Sarah Connor's exit from the series lacked any creativity\\", \\"I want to stab Nick Stahl\\".....just for example. So many elements of the plot seemed thrown together with little regard on how it would affect the films presentation. Sarah dying from leukimia? I say if you're going to kill off a major character in a series, at least give the death some logical connection to the character. All in all, the film was entertaining but that's about it. But so is watching a clown on fire.
B000059XUO|5.0|It is one of the MOST AMAZING films I have seen in along time!!! It has alot of heart and hummor which keeps viewers glued to the screen. All of the characters are exciting to watch and the storyline is easy to follow. The music is great, my favouriate tracks are 'Burn' by The Cure and 'Dead Souls' by Nine Inch Nails.   <br />Brandon Lee will be missed, but at least he left us with a great movie which will never be topped in my opinion for its content and unforgetable characters.<br />ERIC DRAVEN IS SUCH A DUDE!!!

B00005KARJ|5.0|'Dumbo' is one of my all-time favorite Disney classics. It's timeless! Everytime I watch it the story never gets old. There isn't another sweeter movie to match it. It's a darling story of how a little elephant with unusally big ears finds that no matter how unique you are you're always have a purpose in life.  Who says that a character gotta speak in an animated film or any film for that matter? It's the emotion and facial expressions that speak louder than words. The innocence and sentiment surpasses it peers to a priceless treasure. You'll fall in love with the characters Dumbo and his circus companion, Timothy Q. Mouse. Other highlights of the movie is the scenes with the Crows and the music score (won an Academy Award in 1942 for Best Music Score), &quot;When I see an Elephant Fly&quot; sung by the Hall Johnson Choir, the pink elephant (could this be an 1941 anti-alcohol message?). You'll find yourself shedding a tear to &quot;Baby Mine&quot; (nominated for an Academy Award in 1942 for best song). If not, I pronounce you clinically brain dead. I always feel lulled into a calm state-of-mind every time I hear it. Try it sometime! In my honest opinion, the Top 10 all-time greatest Disney classics would be: 1. Dumbo, 2. Mary Poppins, 3. The Jungle Book, 4. Winnie the Pooh, 5. Pochantas, 6. Tarzan, 7. The Lion King, 8. Lady and the Tramp, 9. The Love Bug, 10. Fantasia.
B00005BJ9W|5.0|It's very easy to dismiss Duran Duran, and up until now, it has been the norm.  As one who didn't mind the Thatcherite politics or the excesses of the early videos (\\"Girls on Film\\" was art, dammit!), I sentimentally love this album.  I have played it so many times I have lost count.<br />But, more importantly, it is the Duran Duran album that matters.  It is musically complex in ways that were scarcely matched throughout the entire 1980s - and is still refreshing to listen to in the present.<br />Now that Duran Duran are coming back together with the original line-up (Le Bon, Rhodes, and three Taylors), it is a good time to re-explore the early Duran years and see just how underrated this band was.  This really is the best that they ever sounded, and their only true \\"masterpiece\\" album.  Duran Duran were a singles band, true - and they were never better as a band than with three Taylors.  This album, along with Duran Mk. I's swansong \\"A View to a Kill\\", is as good as they get, and sounds fantastic remastered.  And, for the uninitiated, I promise this will sound great upon first listen!
B0000028M7|5.0|One of the darkest, most disturbing albums of the grunge/postpunk scene that dominated the early 90's.<br />Even though the themes of death, depression, and addiction have become cliche in modern music, Alice in Chains still presents these themes in a fresh, intoxicating way, even for someone who's looking back at this album from the modern perspective of look-alike pop-metal bands and their bland, overused subjects and lyrics.<br />One of the most alarming subject matters of this album is drug addict.  During this time, and up until is death last year, frontman and co-writer Layne Staley was heavily addicted to heroin.  This theme is explored from many angles.<br />\\"Junkhead\\" is a view through the eyes of a junkie in denial of the fact that heroin is slowly destroying him.<br />\\"God Smack\\" is about the slow descent into addiction and how the drug itself becomes a more powerful and dominating figure in your life than anything else (\\"...and God's name is smack for some\\").<br />Heroin is also mentioned in more subtle references, such as in the lyrics of \\"Angry Chair\\" and \\"Sickman.\\"<br />Another alarming and original song for Alice in Chains is \\"Rooster.\\"  This song, written by guitarist and co-writer Jerry Cantrell, is about his father's experience fighting in Vietnam.  For someone who was never even in the military, Cantrell masterfully conveys the feelings of hopelessness, despair, and anger that only a veteran of a war which he knows he's losing can feel.<br />Overall, I think this is the best Alice in Chains album, and was the album that once-and-for-all defined their dark and sinister style (Notice how on the Facelift album, there are still a few 80's hair-band butt-rock songs along with darker ones like \\"We Die Young,\\" \\"Love Hate Love,\\" and \\"Man in the Box\\" that would become the defining voice of AIC).
0804102988|3.0|Had I not once visited Sarum and seen Salisbury cathedral, I doubt I'd have been able to stick with this book... but if you HAVE been to either, you can appreciate the atmosphere and incredible historical detail.<br />The subtitle &quot;The Novel of England&quot; is about right...<br />the book attempts to tell the story of this part of England through five families, beginning with prehistoric Akun who takes his family south to get away from the famine of the icy land-- they want to go to italy (they don't know its name, of course) but the English channel prevents them.<br />You've got to pay attention, because even here, the &quot;bad&quot; hunter the family hooks up with is going to be the progenitor of every single nasty character to come.  The genes = temperament thing is a little simplistic.<br />Rutherford does know how to draw compelling characters and tell good stories.  The trouble is that no story is ever resolved... We spend a good chapter in a particular time period, invest in that character... say, the nobleman Godfrey who tries and fails to arrange marriages for his children with moneyed merchants (the Wilsons, descended from that nasty old Tep)... and start to care...<br />and then suddenly, it's 50 or 75 years later.<br />For me, that sometimes meant that reading was a bit of a chore.  I did enjoy many of the vignettes, particulary during Elizabeth's reign, and the restoration.<br />The Victorian and modern periods were far less convincing... and the book just stops in 1985.  Like the individual chapters, it doesn't really resolve.<br />I tended to be far less interested in the authorial history lessons that are inserted from time to time.<br />It's a worthwhile read... I'd recommend highly for anyone about to travel to that part of the world.  Much less dry than a &quot;straight&quot; history of the place would be...<br />..but for me, not a really engrossing historical tale... too fragmented.
B00005JKZV|5.0|In Swizterland I have grieved for the arrival of the DvD, totally forgetting the that an Extended Edition would soon come out, but my dissapointment was exorcised by this Dvd. Spectacular audio and video even in the most intricate scenes. This is a must for any LOTR lover and I think it might be the best of the three. There are a few mistakes which have been pointed ou previously, though Faramir's feelings about the ring are completely wrong and a few other details. However I loved the film and I wonder how come there have been many criticisms and very petty and few Oscars have been awarded. Gollum is simply unbelievable and the battle of Helm's Deep breathtaking. I also think that the soundtrack is one of the best I have ever heard. The extra's are more on the production then the background of Middle Earth, and that dissapointed me a bit. I give it 5 stars for it cannot receive less, it's one of the \\"big ones\\" in the history of cinema. Few fantasy films have had the same success. I watched both the French and the English version and I was very satisfied. The only thing that really dissapoints me, I must say, is that I cannot see the extra scenes. I'll find a remedy ;)!!!!!<br />Salut
B0000A02TZ|5.0|There isn't much to say about Animal House that hasn't already been said.  Except to say that this is one DVD that truly deserves a special edition, and it's nice to see that Universal has pulled out most (but not all) of the stops in bringing it  back to life.  Animal House is one of those rare films that truly set a new standard in comedy, not just in the sense of clever storytelling, but in raising the bar for celebrating the underdog rebelling against the establishment.  I've thought about buying this DVD for a long time, but glad I held out for this edition.  However, besides the previously mentioned advertisements for upcoming releases, I have a few questions:<br />Why do we need a new video of Shout by some artist most fans of the film probably don't even know?  Seems like an unnecessary extra and certainly doesn't match the performance of the song in the film.<br />Where are the deleted scenes or audio commentary?  I read that John Landis didn't feel like doing one, opting instead for the &quot;not-bad but not great&quot; where are they now short film.  But couldn't someone at Universal at least have assembled a few cast members and writers to provide commentary instead?  Seems like a no-brainer.<br />Last but not least, where is Tom Hulce?  He's not in any of the special features and is barely mentioned.  Maybe it was his choice to be absent, but it's a glaring omission.  Also missing are Donald Sutherland and James Daughton (Greg Marmarlard).  Any ideas?<br />Despite these issues, I still think Animal House is one comedy that belongs in everyone's collection.  Having watched it again, it hasn't lost any of it's charm.  There are just too many classic lines worth repeating.
B000001GXJ|5.0|I first heard this opera purely by chance one day while scanning through the radio dial in my car.  It was playing on National Public Radio one morning and as soon as I heard the music I was hooked.  This is the most beautiful piece of music I've ever listened to.  It is amazing to me that this opera has remained so obscure to the general public.  In fact, until I stumbled across it playing on the radio I had never even heard of the title.  I have been a Jose Carreras fan for quite sometime and when I decided to purchase this opera on CD I deliberately searched for a version with him on it.  I read several of the other reviews on Amazon before purchasing it and I have not been disappointed.  The best surprise for me was when I heard the other singers on this recording.  Freni is excellent. I honestly can not think of a single weak spot on this version.  The entire cast is incredible and will simply blow you away.  If this CD had cost me ten times more money than it did it would have still been worth every last dime.  If I had to throw every CD I own away and was only allowed to keep one CD this opera would be the CD I would choose.  Buy this version and you will thank me later!
B00005UKE0|5.0|2 hours and 07 minutes of the greatest musician ever (well, one of my favorites).<BR>You can not say that this album you must have, couse if you say this, you must live in neptune and never heard about George Harrison.<BR>Lyrics and music can not be describe, with this album I become a George Harrison`s fans, even that right now I`m 19 years old. In the beggining of 93, heard it for the first time, even that i was not able to understand the lyrics (because im an argentinian boy)  the music felt so great that while I was studying, in the record was let it down playing all the time, couse it was tender and also aggressive in a second. Other song was I remember jeep (dont have any world in english to describe this song).<BR>After I learn english, George Harrison`s lyric came to me in a new way of listen and understand the meaning of the music with the lyrics (the same happened with The Beatles). All Things Must Pass (Todo debe pasar) it is an album that is complete in all the music and lyrics, will me you pass through all the kind of mood (all things must pass).<BR>Anyway, I recomend you this album with capital letters, YOU MUST OWN THIS CD, tomorrow morning is good if you dont have it. <BR>its one of the cds that I would take if I get lost in an island, with the white album and no answer or out of the blue (electric light orchestra). But if you make me decided for two, of course I will choose, this album and the white album.<BR>George Harrison was and it will be for me and many people a great musician, one of the best.<br />Thanks George for everything!!<BR>From an Argentinian Fan.<BR>

B00009TB5G|1.0|The media hype surrounding this film should be an indication of how laughably bad it is. TTT has to be one of the worst movies since Plan Nine From Outer Space. It is just a muddy plotless mess, full of cheesy special effects, lame wannabe dialogue, lookalike characters, and totally devoid of any character development. I've seen better films on the SciFi channel, and that isn't saying much.<br />The only people who could possibly enjoy this are videogame addicts, or individuals who get an intellectual challenge out of Wheel of Fortune reruns.<br />The only reason to watch TTT is Gollum, a hilarious yet surprisingly pathetic cross between a homunculus, George W. Bush, and Donald Duck. <br />Next time, the producers should pick a real director to film the Rings series - someone who knows how to humanize tragedy. Maybe Julie Taymor (\\"Titus\\") or Ridley Scott (\\"Gladiator\\") will take the challenge someday.
B000001ESN|4.0|This is a transitional album.while &quot;Hemispheres&quot; where Rush's peak of their Progresive rock style,&quot;Permanent waves&quot; are their first more Pop-rock album.a Prelude to &quot;moving pictures&quot;<BR>there are six tracks here  - more simple 4-5 minutes song are mixed with two epic progressive mini-suits...<br />1.&quot;The spirit of radio&quot; - quite a big hit...a classic Rush song about power of modern music industry...very nice catchy riff,simple and a bit naive lyrics,a very pleasurable song!<BR>very cheerfull and catchy           5/5<br />2.&quot;Freewill&quot; - More dark and heavy rock tune...another well known song from here.it is about people's will that others try to manipulate - &quot;if you choose not to decide, you've already made a choice...&quot; Propably my favorite from here...in the end Geddy sings incredibly high notes...           5/5<br />3.&quot;Jacobs ladder&quot; - incredibly heavy guitar riff...this almost 8 minutes long progressive tune shows hiw talented Rush are - all these solos,synths stuff and huge bass line.it's a slower song about the power of nature and weather...really dark.i love the creepy quiet part with synth riff and geddy's voice in the middle.a very good one, but far from &quot;The camera eye&quot; 4/5<br />4.&quot;Entre nous&quot; - very nice more pop-rock song.many of Rush fans hate this one but i found it very enjoyable and moving.chorus is fantastic and will not leave your head...         5/5<br />5.&quot;Different strings&quot; - slow and mellow ballad with delicate Geddy's vocals...lyrics are about feelings and love that can't be sheared beetwen everyone &quot;different hearts beat on diferent strings...&quot;.really touching song with marvelous guitar solo...one of not many Rush ballads         5/5<br />6.&quot;Natural science&quot; - almost 10 minutes long Progressive song...Pretty much overrated.compared to &quot;The camera eye&quot;,&quot;Xanadu&quot; or &quot;Cygnus x-1&quot; it lacks of such a big variety and magic...the instrumets are playing very well in here of course (crazy bass line,raging guitars...).but as a whole tune something is missing here...maybe Geddy,Neill and Andy were wanting too much to be putted in one place?i don't know,but it is the weakest one from here - interesting and worth listening but not so great as some of Rush fans claim it to be.   3,5/4<br />&quot;Permanent waves&quot; are a must-have for every Rush fan and also for average Rock music fan...beside &quot;Moving Pictures&quot; it's an album that made Rush a legend and made their way to the rock pantheon...
6300214028|5.0|It's a brilliant movie really; romantic, funny, intelligent and sad, as well as historical.  John Reed was a confused American, or perhaps just an inspired one.  His real battle was for the American working man, an underpaid, over-worked breed of Americana who helped form this nation.  Reed really just believe, if you break it down into bare essence, that men should be treated fairly.  He was labeled a communist, and probably believed himself to be one on some level, but his views were really more socialistic.  This was his basis, and that basis took him to Russia, where he became an unwitting spokesman for the communist regime, his words twisted and translated to meet the Party's needs.  His heart was just with the working man, and a misguided feeling that life should be fair.  His writing speaks for itself--read &quot;Ten Days that Shook the World&quot;.  Ah, but there's more behind Reed's Russian connection, far more.  He, along with the people who formed his circle of friends, was a bohemian in all respects.  They were people of art, and of talent, intellectual artists in their own right, and far ahead of their time.  The movie touches upon it, and leads one to want to learn more about the man, and his time.  His relationships with Gene O'Neill and Louise Bryant goes far beyond what is portrayed, but the movie does at least give one the insight into those relationships.  In their time, Reed, Bryant, and O'Neill did much in America for American writers, and for American theatre.  They were all people of art, and of deep emotion.  In a time of growing comformity, they tossed comformity aside.  Their lifestyles were not the lifestyles of &quot;proper people&quot; of the time, but they gave great emotion to merely living, and to living each day as it came.  Each of them touched this world in some way, left something of themselves behind, and that's what Reds is really all about...what one leaves behind.  John Reed is the only American ever buried in the Kremlin...hardly a matter to be left a faded shade in history.  His belief was strong, and he stood by those beliefs, and that's something that most of us never achieve in the long run of things.<br />It's a good movie, and worth seeing, and worth remembering.
B000000993|4.0|The First Tool's real studio album (after \\"opiate EP\\") shows already all their skills and talents of composing a havey metal anthems with a bit of craziness and their own style.songs like \\"Intolerance\\",\\"Prison sex\\" or \\"sober\\" are like diamonds...their power will last forever - and so other songs from here...and \\"Disgustipated\\" shows more ambient and experimetal face of Tool...no guitars,industrial sounds,and creepy lyrics about the holocaust of...carrots (yes,that is true...)...Maynard,danny,adam and Paul (paul d'amour, their first basist,left after \\"Undertow\\") are a humorous guys...<BR>This is maybe not the best album to start with Tool (\\"Lateralus\\" is the best\\" but definitly it is a rich and powerfull record...<BR>why not 5 stars???<BR>because of Weak production<BR>and...i like even more \\"aenima\\" and \\"lateralus\\"!!!
B00009V7T2|5.0|This CD is unbelievable. The energy throughout this CD is WOW!<BR>But this CD!
B00004T9AO|3.0|About two weeks ago i listened once again to \\"Crises\\" and i found it not as bad as after buying...i have rediscovered it as a CD with some really great moments,the title track simply growes ojn you after many listenings...<BR>ok, here are my impressions about all tracks...<br />1)\\"CRISES\\" - about 21 minutes long suite. Starts with a soft theme played by a synth and tubular bells.<BR>after it we have a two small guitar based themes.the second one has even a loops of car engine sound and ambulance...<BR>Later it grows in more and more energetic and full of agressive guitars title song (Mike sings as a main vocalist in this suite).<BR>The title song is an angry anthem, where mike roars \\"Crises, crises!!! you can't get away...\\". it is a really great moment of this album.Guitar work is impressive...<BR>Later on the atmosphere changes with \\"The watcher and the tower\\" song. It is a gentle and pathetic track with wonderfull vocals and beautifull guitar...the drums are rythmic and are a solid back-up for a melody...<BR>\\"watcher and the tower\\" fades into a quiet variation of beginning theme...This is the most beautifull moment from here,and worth af buying whole album...Gentle synth and bass and a fantastic guitar solo...<BR>Then the coda of \\"Crises\\" beggins...Coda is a synth variation of one of the themes from here...And this is where the suite gets boring.The loud and almost 8 minutes long ending is repetative and irritating...Even the \\"ommadawn\\" styled ending (tribal srums and female vocals) are not makling it better...<BR>and so this suite should end after 12 minutes, not after 20...<BR>3,5/4<br />2)\\"Moonlight shadow\\" - the most well-known and biggest hit ever of Mike Oldfield. I think that every person in the world heard it at least one time in lifetime...It's a nice acoutic guitar based track, with sweet vocals by Maggie reilly...sounds a bit like Fleetwod Mac songs.The guitar solo is the best one that Mike ever played.listen to this solo and you will know why he is such a genius.<BR>5/5<br />3)\\"In high places\\" - A great colaboration with Jon Anderson (Yes singer). simple but very catchy song about flying.extremly cool melody. Synths and Vibraphone parts are remarkable.wonderfull.<BR>5/5<br />4)\\"Forreign affair\\" - another hit single. monnotonic song based on one repetative chorus.Could be a Typical eighties pop but Mike made it kind of Mantra song...very hypnotising track...but although it is interesting it is a little bit boring.<BR>4/5<br />5) \\"Taurus III\\" - third part of Taurus trilogy.A flamenco styled song but nothing special.Classical guitars are very irritating.it is a filler.just skip it <BR>2/5<br />6.\\"Shadow one the wall\\" - Energetic Rocker...memorable vocals by Roger Chapman...the most energetic song from here.i love almost everything about it.from the bass line to hidden banjo...<BR>sadly the version that is here is the edit of original track that appears on \\"Elements\\" and \\"the complete\\" compilations...get the longer and original version!!!!!<BR>3,75/5<br />In the end- this album is maybe not hte worster Mike 's album, but it is not his best either...there are brilliant moments on here and whole album is a classic but beside \\"Earth moving\\" it is the weakest eighties Cd of Oldfield...go and buy \\"QE2\\" of \\"five Miles out\\"!!! well, you can check \\"crises\\" too but do not expect his genius at full on here<br />Ps - note about Remastered Edition........<BR>The sound is more natural and brighter...If you have a subwoofer the basses will be delightfull for you.anyway - the sound is really good,better than standard edition!<br />the biggest and the most silly mistake - \\"Foreign affair\\" is not mentioned in hte tracklist!!!!!!! like there are 5 tracks acording to Virgin new edition...of course \\"Foreign affair\\" is avaible here...but that mistake is really bad bad bad bad bad...shame on you virgin!<BR>not to forget that the MIke Oldfield's HDCD re-editions all have many funny mistakes...is this a price to pay for the new clean sound?
B00009MGQL|4.0|I first got tuned in and turned on to Jeff Beck with his &quot;Who Else?&quot; cd, which in my personal opinion is the best. But this newest offering is a good mix of sounds and rhythms, and Jeff is experimenting with alot of interesting styles and sounds. I would just as soon that he keep it instrumental as opposed to including vocals on his stuff. His style is unmistakeable and strong enough to hold its own without the help of anyone singing.. This is good.. but &quot;Who Else?&quot; is really choice!
B00006F83Y|5.0|Not really much of a story of how I discovered this little gem.  I was a fan of Queens of the Stone Age's &quot;Lost Art of Keeping a Secret&quot;, and definitely liked the first single of this, &quot;No One Knows&quot;.  I suppose that's all that inspired me to buy this...<BR>Then, upon my first listen, I was instantly drawn into some of the most ethereal, out of this world stuff I've heard in awhile.  Listening to this, it's unbelieveable this is coming out alongside with some of the banal same-chord nu-metal bullcrap out there (Linkin Park, POD, etc.. ). There is no streamlined guitar, no electronic drums, no heavy reverb...it almost feels like the band is holding rehearsal right next to you.  The majority of the songs here are played in a standard C-tuning, giving the album a very epic, yet basic feel.  <BR>The opening track, in its simplicity, just sonically alone is inspiring.  &quot;No One Knows&quot; is obviously a smart and beautifully crafted pop hit, as well as the drop B-flat driven Kyuss throwback, &quot;First it Giveth&quot;.  Dave Grohl's drumming truly shines through out the recording, as well as Josh's guitar playing, and Nick's bass wankery.  Josh's vocals are the most appealing to me, more so than Nick or Mark Lanegan.  His vocal melodies used throughout are spellbinding, and otherworldy.<BR>&quot;The Sky is Fallin'&quot; is definitely a standout track here, displaying a gut-wrenching melody on the guitar, as well as the vocal melody.  Other standouts are the frantic piano-driven &quot;Go With The Flow&quot; (with an incredible music video to boot), &quot;Do it Again&quot;, the bluesy &quot;God is in the Radio&quot;, and the spooky epic track 13, &quot;Song for the Deaf&quot;, which is by far my favorite on the album.  This is by far one of the haunting, skin-crawlingly good tracks put out by anyone I've heard, and a scary closer (aside from the &quot;hidden&quot; track, &quot;Mosquito Song&quot;, which is no less incredible, with full orchestration.) Honorable mention also goes to &quot;Hangin' Tree&quot;, one of the more &quot;metal&quot; songs on here.  The theme of jokester radio-DJ's that segues throughout the recording gets a tad tiresome, but I have thusfar found no track that I skip over.  Anyone who leads you to believe this recording is anything less than stellar is either jaded about the rock scene, or not listening closely.  THIS IS A MUST-HAVE FOR ANY FAN OF ROCK MUSIC OF ANY AGE, which is saying a hell of a lot, my friend.  I wouldn't even reccomend some of my favorite Yes albums to all rock fans.  Just go out, and buy it already.
0688163173|5.0|The thing about Dennis Lehane is that he had it made. Those two guys, Patrick and Angie, were fighting crime, falling in love, falling out of love, fighting crime, and it could have gone on forever (as many of the &quot;format&quot; authors do). But what separates Lehane from the rest of the pack is his unwillingness to settle for the easy way.<br />He wrote &quot;Mystic River,&quot; which distanced himself from many, and now follows that up with &quot;Shutter Island.&quot;<br />Shutter Island . . . . imagine a mystery set in the venue of Ken Kesey's Cuckoo's Nest? What is real and what is memorex? Who is lying, who isn't? When U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels goes out to Shutter Island off of Boston Harbor to investigate the disappearance of a patient, Rachel Soldano, we're just not sure what we're in for. Both him and his partner, Chuck Aule, are there to resolve the Rachel Soldano case. But reluctantly, the close mouthed Teddy acknowledges that there is another issue. There's a man incarcerated (treated?) there that was an arsonist and set fire to Teddy's apartment, killing his wife. He's lived with the hatred, remorse, despair, rage and sadness for several years. What he plans to do is never resolved in his partner's mind. But murdering him isn't out of the question.<br />When things add up and then don't add up, the reader is hanging together with Lehane but not sure we know where he's taking us. That's an infrequent pleasure, a brilliant novelist getting us to the last 20 pages with NO idea of what's going to happen.<br />The ending will knock your socks off.

B0092MJOMW|5.0|I have been into speed metal since the early 80s. When \\"Reign in Blood\\" came out, we were all still marveling at bands like Metallica (Kill 'Em All), Venom, Exodus, etc.<br /><br />This album set a new benchmark of speed, intensity, ferocity, technical excellence, and brutality. It simply and utterly demolished everything that came before it... and since its release in 1986, little has come along to rival it.<br /><br />It's less than 30 minutes long (well, the original version that ended with \\"Raining Blood\\") but as Metal Hammer magazine said back then: by that time you're in a coma. As unsubtle as Kerry King's nailed arm-bands; if you think modern metal bands are extreme, spin this up loud. Enjoy.

1563890119|5.0|This was the beginning of a Neil Gaiman masterpiece. His work on the Sandman is great. It's a comic that all who love fantasy can enjoy. Personally I had never ventured into the world of comics until I heard about the Sandman. The characters have some aspect we can all identify with. It's a definite have to read.
0375713751|5.0|And I missed the main character after I was done reading.  I described it to friends as Bridget Jones Becomes a Mom.  What a terrific read!  Hilariously funny!

6305079811|5.0|Move over Luke Skywalker, the true hero of 80's sci-fi films is here!!! Thank God for sci-fi films, and thank God for \\"Flash Gordon!\\" One of the best, and most wildly entertaining sci-fi epics to ever be produced, \\"Flash Gordon\\" is a real treat. The film has everything that a moviegoer could ever want in one movie: lots of action(including a great battle scene involving the Hawkmen), humor, great settings & costumes, the single best movie soundtrack EVER ('Flash! Ah-a, savior of the universe!') and the wonderfully over-the-top Brian Blessed as \\"Vultan.\\" I mean, honestly, is there any movie scene out there that compares to the thrills that you will receive when Vultan's legions of Hawkmen assualt War Rocket Ajax, and that kick-bum battle theme music from Queen kicks in? I think not!! Let's just thank our lucky stars that we have a movie that's the caliber of \\"Flash Gordon.\\" This film is enjoyable on every level, and will surely become part of the sci-fi lover's home video library. I would honestly marry a woman in a heartbeat if she loved this film as much as I! Don't miss out!!!<br />P.S. Who knew that a New York Jets quarterback was capable of such amazing feats - honestly, could you picture Broadway Joe doing this? I think not!

B00005QXXO|4.0|The unfortunate thing about living in The States is that when Radiohead does tour here, once in a blue moon, the shows are so few that it is next to impossible to get tickets. I, therefore, have never been able to see my favorite band live....but I have heard how amazing they can be. Whenever I listen to &quot;I Might Be Wrong&quot; I close my eyes and let the music envelope me so that I do feel like I am right there with Thom, Colin &amp; the rest of the boys. This album is an amazing companion piece to the Kid-A &amp; Amnesiac records. One only has to listen to the absolutely beautiful and haunting rendition of &quot;Like Spinning Plates&quot; (easily the album's stand-out track) to know that this band is truly one of the greatest rock bands of our generation. The record is solid from start to finish and lends itself to numerous listens, especially the aforementioned &quot;Like Spinning PLates.&quot;  The sound quality of the album is fantastic, its a soundboard copy of the show, on par with the quality of Phish's live albums. If you're a Radiohead fan, check this one out! If you aren't a Radiohead fan, you might need to familiarize yourself with their catalogue to appreciate this, but you can certainly enjoy it on any level.
B00005N91B|5.0|Michael Douglas and Sharon Stone star in this erotic thriller.  Their chemistry is perfect for \\"Basic Instinct\\".  The writers wonderfully blend erotica and murder mystery, giving the audience more eyepleasing scenes.  Director Paul Verhoeven proves his fearlessness as the passionate scenes deepen into territories that many would only dare.  Some may sense the obvious connection to a book.  Still, this is a movie worth watching.  Those looking for extra sexy scenes should watch the unrated version.  It offers the director's intended theme and interviews from Douglas and Stone.  Those pleased with \\"Basic Instinct\\" should watch it again.  That time, pay extra attention to every quote.  It'll help better understand the long and deep chain of events.
B00005JM09|4.0|I am a life-long Terminator fan, but when I heard plans for T3, I cringed. I knew that the movie would be horrible, as most sci-fi franchises are. However, I was surprised to find a film that not only knocked my socks off, but literally left me  asking \\"when does T4 come out?\\" The film's plot is so paper thin, its amazing that this didn't go straight-to-video. The film's saving grace is its self-satirizing attitude, and a car chase that puts the \\"Matrix: Reloaded\\" freeway chase to absolute shame. It seems like half a city was destroyed to get the sequence in, and it left the audience wildly cheering and applauding. Arnold isn't anything special, and you can tell that age is getting the better of him, but his tongue-in-cheek attitude (his reference to being an \\"obsolete model\\" was really quite brilliant) really helps to make this film enjoyable. I would recommend this film to the \\"Matrix\\" audience that was disappointed by this spring's film. \\"T3\\" proves that you don't have to be philosophical or pretentious to entertain - just be yourself, which is what this film is all about. Is it \\"Casablanca?\\" Hell no. But it's the most entertaining and wild ride that you will experience in a cinema this summer.
B00004YYDI|5.0|this was one of the best movies i have seen, you cant just say its a bad movie because of the violence but its a good story about this killer who cares about this girl and that all killers arent mean and nasty. im always telling people to see this movie
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|Lately I've somewhat been dissapointed by new releases from hardcore bands that made an amazing album at one point. Albums like Artist in the Ambulance by Thrice and You Come Before You by poison the well definitley don't measure up at all to their past albums such as illusion of safety and opposite of december. Waking The Fallen is the complete opposite. The band has definitley matured a huge amount since the release of Sounding The Seventh Trumpet. The songs on this album definitley sound much more honest and more emotional(but definitley not emo) than the last album. The songs in the past album sound more as if A7X was trying moreover to fit into the hardcore scene whereas this album definitley sounds more like what the guys really want to do. I honestly wasn't really expecting too much from this album judging by the sampler that was released a while back. The two songs on the sampler are definitley 2 of the weaker tracks on the album, but they still are very good. I also really like the re-recorded version of second hearbeat which is on this album. I won't see you tonight part 1 is definitley an amazing song on the album, even though the longest timing in at 8:58. Some of the parts on the song chapter four show a very distinct thrice influence, the guitar solo part on the song I won't see you tonight part 2 show what I'm guessing is a meshuggah influence.<br />All in all a VERY amazing album, and definitley worth your money, it's really too hard to put into words just how amazing this album is so just listen to the songs.
B00005QW5X|5.0|What to say about this sleeper hit which very few people have had the pleasure of viewing. The soundtrack itself is worth the investment. Outstanding. John Cameron Mitchell is completely mezmorizing in this role(which he wrote) and is an untapped talent in Hollywood in my book. The message is quite simple: no matter how odd, diverse, or unfamiliar one's life may seem we all want the same thing...to be loved. This story of a trasvestite from a land we have only read about in the papers and watched on TV, touches all of us: male, female, straight, gay, etc... It's about human nature. And connects the disconnect we feel about others that seem different. This is a beautiful movie that unfortunately, won't be seen by the people who might benifit the most from a classic such as this.
B000002H38|4.0|Anita Baker gets CAUGHT UP IN THE RAPTURE of jazz and soul. SWEET LOVE is the album's first hit,and later most of the other songs would appear on the Hit Parade. Anita's personal composition WATCH YOUR STEP,was not a hit,though. She covers MYSTERY which was a hit for THE MANHATTAN TRANSFER. Other hits from this album include NO ONE IN THE WORLD and SAME OL' LOVE. Almost every song on this album has been played on jazz stations all over America.
B00005QEO1|5.0|Aerosmith seldom disappoint. OK, &quot;Nine Lives&quot; & &quot;Just Push Play&quot; were absolutely TERRIBLE albums and I don't know what they were thinking when &quot;OH YEAH! Ultimate Hits&quot; was released just months after &quot;Young Lust:The Very Best of Aerosmith&quot; but this is back in the day when Aerosmith rocked! There is no other band I can think of in the world that has had such a remarkable comeback than what Aerosmith had in the 1980s. &quot;Permanent Vacation&quot; in 1987 was their first sober album in years and was a huge success, they followed that success with &quot;Pump&quot; - another classic.<br />&quot;Love In An Elevator&quot;, &quot;What It Takes&quot;, &quot;The Other Side&quot;, &quot;Young Lust&quot;, &quot;F-I-N-E&quot; - Aerosmith's classic melodic harmonies are all here in this amazing album. <br />Check out &quot;My Girl&quot; and &quot;Monkey On My Back&quot; - plus &quot;Janie's Got A Gun&quot; -   Aerosmith should give up now because they haven't had a decent album out in years, but this is a classic - back when Aerosmith could do no wrong!
B000002UB3|5.0|Everyone has his own favourite album, I guess. Well, mine is 'Abbey Road', which I consider the best Beatles' work and the greatest product in pop music history. As most of you know, it's the Beatles' swan song: they met for some weeks, they abandoned quarrels and anger and worked together again, as they hadn't done since 'Magical Mystery Tour' (or maybe 'Sgt. Pepper's'). It was clear it was going to be their last effort. What is incredible is that this work is surprisingly good if we compare it to the 'Get Back' stuff (that will become 'Let It Be' with the contribution of Phil Spector).  Lennon and McCartney didn't write songs together as they did in their early days, anyway this album sounds incredible to me. In 1969 Rolling Stones released 'Let It Bleed', my favourite work of theirs. 'Let It Bleed' is a very good product, but I could never compare it to 'Abbey Road', that is not just very good... it's mature, diverse, emotional, self-assured as no other album that I ever heard is.   Side A. Lennon's contributions are the late-psychedelic 'Come Together' and the hard-rocking 'I Want You (She's So Heavy)'. McCartney produces a catchy ditty, 'Maxwell's Silver Hammer', and 'Oh Darling', a great song that he sang in incredible 'Long-Tall-Sally'-style. Ringo sings his 'Octopus's Garden' that works pretty fine with backing Lennon-McCartney vocals and background effects. Harrison gives us his best work ever: 'Something' is the best love song ever written, at least that is what Frank Sinatra claimed.  Side B. We find 'Here Comes The Sun', a brilliant acoustic song by Harrison (hey, that man got better and better in writing songs...), the three-voices gem 'Because' (with wise use of synthesizer in it) and the 'long suite' that consists in different short tunes that work really fine together. Except for the final surprise (the short ditty 'Her Majesty') the end is... 'The End', a catchy rocking song which features Ringo's drums solo (the only one on a Beatles' record) and three guitar solos by Lennon-McCartney-Harrison.   'Abbey Road' is a masterpiece and would deserve even more than 5 stars. If you like pop music just buy this album and enjoy.
0375703861|3.0|In the novel White Teeth, Zadie Smith tackled a very difficult task of incorporating comedy into a very serious cultural clash.  The booked is centered upon its two pillars, the egotistical, patronizing, pretentious, and condescending Samad Miah Iqbal and the soft spoken, non-confrontational, modest yet suicidal Archibald Jones.  The two men come from completely different cultures, Samad being a Bengali Muslim, and Archie being a British Christian.  As Samad and Archie go from the British Royal Military to north London their friendship stays strong.  They each have their own complicated families which serve as the main characters in the book.  Samad marries the over-bearing, opinionated, and out-spoken Alsana.  They have identical twins Magid and Millat, who are both the same person yet so very opposite its increadible.  Archie marries the beautiful, rebellious, and toothless Clara Bowden, a Jamaican immigrant and daughter of a die-hard and somewhat hysterical Jehovah's Witness, Hortense Bowden.  Together, Archie and Clara have a daughter, Irie, a voluptuous, opinionated, and averagely intelligent girl.<br /> The beginning of the story works on bringing the characters together.  It is careening with oddities and some of the most awkward matches and situations possible.  Once both of the families are clearly established, the true genius of the book comes to light.  Each character is developed into a complex jumble of emotion, conflict, love, and rebellion.  Samad ships his eldest by two minutes and better son, Magid back to Bangladesh to become a religious profit gifted with the light of Allah.  In doing so he created an enemy of Alsana until he returned.  There second son, Millat, develops into a rebel of sorts.  All of the girls are obsessed with him, he smokes pot incessantly, and he leads a gang of rough riders feared and respected throughout the youth of North London.  As the development of his two sons strays further and further from what he intended, Samad believes himself to be a cursed Muslim and decides to devote himself to Allah forever.  Archie continues in his non confrontational style for the whole book, while Irie and Clara constantly clash about nearly every issue that comes up.  The families, alone and by themselves have enough issues to make a shrinks career.  They then run into each other and even another family, the Chalfens, to create even more friendship, love, conflict, turmoil, and cultural clashing.<br />The book unfortunately falls off a bit in my mind after of the conflict, drama, and commotion is clearly established.  Smith rushes her characters into new developments completely inconsistent with their previously described and wonderfully thought out characters.  Samad goes from powerful and handsome, to feeble and insignificant.  Alsana then goes from a subservient wife to a spouse abusing wench worthy of any husband's fears.  Millat goes from a popular leader to be followed, to a follower in Kevin, something that was so incongruous to his character that is really detracted from a reader's connection with him.  These inconsistencies did not ruin the story, but they attacked Smiths credibility, this being a story based in the realm of reality.  The only character that stayed consistent was Archie, though even he was a hard to gauge.  We saw in the first seen of the book, his attempted suicide, and from that point on he is a submissive vegetable who offers a gentle opinion here and there.  While the story holds up, its characters have difficulty doing so.<br />Smith's trend of factional evolution of the characters was the strongest metaphor throughout the story.  It began with Hortense Bowden and Ryan Topps committing their lives to Jehovah's Witness church.  Then Millat went to KEVIN to act as a fundamentalist follower of some ridiculous approach on Islam.  Then Joshua joined FATE mainly out of rebellion to his father.  The message in all of this seemed to say that people have a need to associate withthat seems to them as an important endeavor, their time has to be worth something.  In assuring this for themselves, they often make decisions that would normally never even be considered.  While the messages are consistent, once again, it is not consistent with the story that Smith conjured in the opening hundred and fifty pages of the book.<br />In all, this was a very interesting book with many twists and turns, some expected and some completely curve balled.  I became easy at some points to connect and at others to be completely detached.  When reading it, keep an open mind and don't search to hard for explanations and reasoning that you think you missed, chances are it isn't there.  If you just move with the motion of the book it's an enjoyable read that will interestingly leave you wanting more (possibly because the ending was dismal and you need a better sense of closure).
B000002U82|5.0|It's very hard to review an album that is considered one of the greatest album of history (if not the greatest one): it introduced a revolution in music, was the best concept album ever, and so on.   I think this album is overrated, though I admit that music is great. 'Breathe' is a slide-guitar-based introduction, 'Time' is a wonderful song from all points of view, 'Money' is a good song (maybe overlong, but it works), 'Us And Them' is a Wright's keyboard-based work (maybe a little too epic/slow/long), 'Any Colour You Like' a very pleasant jam, 'Brain Damage' a good Waters ballad, 'Eclipse' a weak melody that works as a good conclusion for the album. But the musical ideas were not completely invented in this album: please notice how 'Childhood's End' is structured in same way as 'Time' (although the first one is much less catchy and rich) and how the melody of 'Eclipse' recalls 'Wot's... Uh The Deal'. 'On The Run' is a non-song put in the wrong place (if it ever deserves a place, which I don't believe) as it breaks the natural flow of the songs. But 'The Great Gig In The Sky', a gorgeous Wright's tune, features great Clare Tory's vocals and an amazing piano playing.   And music is not the only good thing on here. Lyrics are good too; written by Waters (who didn't take control of the band yet) they present his vision of life: lyrics about time, money, madness and so on are deep and flow well, making this a very fine concept album. Special effects are even more important and from this point of view this album presents great innovations: initial heartbeat, laughters, airplanes, clocks and cash registers are working in amazing way (in 'The Wall' effects will work even better).  Overall this album presents terrific moments that overshadow all weak ones ('On The Run', long instrumental part in 'Money', pompousness in 'Us And Them').   So buy 'Dark Side Of The Moon' now if you are searching for the quintessential Floyd's work, just don't believe the hype and don't expecttoo much: it's a great moment in musical history, but it's no perfection.
B000099T2L|3.0|Whilst I do like this album, I'm not raving about it as personally I feel hyped up to be better than it is. &quot;Crazy In Love&quot; &amp; &quot;Baby Boy&quot; are both really hot tracks. Despite the Whitney / Mariah type warbling &amp; Beyonces overvocalising going on throughout the whole album it is actually very listenable. I would of given it Four stars except for the awful duet with Luther Vandross &quot;The Closer I get To You&quot; and a slightly altered version of the worst track on DC's &quot;Survior&quot; album &quot;Dangerously In Love&quot;. Whilst on the whole the album is good all the upbeat tracks are at the begining and all the slow tracks at the end I think it needs to be mixed up a little. Doesn't make it in to my top ten releases of the year so far. I prefer Ashanti's &quot;Chapter 2&quot;.

B000002UTY|5.0|This album has played in my head daily for the last 30 years.  Some brunette split with my 8-track, so I hadn't actually heard any of it (with my ears) since about 1972.  I bought the CD-thing in August 2003.  WOW!!!  Talk about flashbacks!  These tunes really take you back.  This album is every bit as incredible as it was the first time I heard it, back in '68 or '69.  5 stars?? I'd give it at least 6.....
0385509456|5.0|Thanks to the good advice of a person knowledgeable about great new fiction reads, I decided to pick up a copy of freshman author Mark Haddon's &quot;The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time.&quot; The author works as a creative writing instructor at Oxford with occasional forays into writing and illustrating children's literature. Most importantly, Haddon once worked with autistic individuals, a fact that certainly provided the foundation for this groundbreaking novel. Haddon is the author of the book, but the perspective the story takes comes directly from the mind of a fictional fifteen year old British autistic named Christopher Boone. This is Boone's story, and what a wonderful tale it is. &quot;The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time&quot; is nominally a murder mystery story, but it is really more than your typical whodunit. Instead, we get a story about life itself from a most unlikely source.<br />When Mrs. Shears's dog Wellington dies a violent death, next-door neighbor Christopher Boone realizes it is up to him to solve the homicide. There are numerous obstacles in Christopher's path: no one seems to care about Wellington's death, his father outright orders him to cease his investigations, and Christopher is an autistic. Christopher's inability to connect with people on an emotional level makes asking questions about the crime extraordinarily difficult. Even worse, young Boone cannot read facial expressions; he does not understand various shades of emotional states. This disability will cause serious problems with his investigation, but Christopher understands his liabilities and resolves to use his logical mind to unmask the murderer. As the story progresses, Christopher recognizes he must overcome many of his fears in order to accomplish his goals. His fear of the color yellow must not stop him from taking a trip on a train; his mania about crowds and excessive noise must not stop him from asking questions or moving around town; his ignorance about areas outside of his house and school must not stand in the way of a trip to London. As Christopher homes in on a solution to Wellington's death, he understands that a dog's untimely demise profoundly changes his own life in ways he never foresaw, especially in his relationships within his family.<br />I am not particularly familiar with the intricacies of autism, at least not beyond what I picked up through a few movies and several articles in the newspaper. From what I do understand about this medical condition, Haddon seems to conflate several different types of autism into one character. Christopher hates physical contact, possesses bizarre fears about colors (yellow and brown), cannot stand to have food touching on his plate, often drifts off into intricate mental exercises, possesses an amazing capacity for mathematics and numbers, and often groans or resorts to violent outbursts when overwhelmed with sensory input. I doubt whether one individual autistic could really contain all of these attributes, but like I said, I do not know enough about the condition to refute Christopher's character traits. I will say that allowing Christopher to possess all of these quirks makes for a more interesting novel. It also allows for several humorous sequences, such as when Boone lists &quot;Hating France&quot; as one of the reasons people consider him a behavioral problem. Another section that causes a few chuckles occurs when Chris lists the reasons why he despises brown and yellow. After reading this list, who can really argue against his points? Brown and yellow are weird, and you will think about Christopher's logic the next time you bite into a banana.<br />What impressed me the most about Haddon's story is how an enormously emotional and private family turmoil emerges through the eyes of an individual who simply cannot make complex emotional connections. Christopher's ultra logical mind never fully grasps the reasons for the fractures in his family life,but the reader does and it makes the emotion in the novel even more vivid. It's as though you want to reach into the story and shake Christopher into awareness, and the knowledge that you cannot reach him any more than those around him imbues the book with an awesome power. I am not at all surprised to see that many people cried at the end of the story; I must confess to a certain mistiness around my eyes and an inexplicable knot in my throat as I closed the cover for the last time. Haddon's book is powerful, and I frankly cannot imagine how this author will ever top the magisterial beauty of this book.<br />Since I finished Haddon's book I have mentioned it to several people I know. I even got my mom to read it (she thought it wonderful, too). I think word of mouth is how this book will become a classic, since it does not appear on any bestseller lists that I am aware of (maybe it is now). Run, do not walk, to the bookstore or library to get a copy of this novel.

B00005JM02|5.0|This is a wonderful movie for young, and old alike. The start of the movie is scary with the entire family of Nemo being eaten by a shark except he and his father Marlin. The movie is funny, sad, enlightening, and beautiful with vivid colors under the sea. If you like Toy Story, or Monster's Inc. you'll love this computer generated movie also. Once again, Pixar comes through with a wonderful cast of characters. My children, husband, and I, all went to see this together, and we all loved it. It will be on our shelf of DVD's this fall for sure. We look forward to seeing it over, and over again. Thanks for a great movie!
B00005JKG7|5.0|Thanks in large part to the frenetic efforts of John Carpenter, the horror film medium flourished in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Few fans of the genre need a reminder that Carpenter directed the classic &quot;Halloween,&quot; an independent film that went on to great success and eternal status as a cult classic. While the tale about the merciless Michael Myers certainly didn't invent the slasher film (look back to Mario Bava's classic &quot;Twitch of the Death Nerve&quot; to see an earlier effort), it influenced many others to carry the torch in the following years. Carpenter's follow up to &quot;Halloween,&quot; a nice little chiller called &quot;The Fog,&quot; moved rapidly away from a maniac wielding a knife and screaming teenagers, focusing instead on psychological terror and supernatural eeriness to scare the masses. Carpenter's recent films just don't compare with his early fright fests. That's a darn shame, but for horror aficionados, watching the troika of &quot;Halloween,&quot; &quot;The Fog,&quot; and &quot;The Thing&quot; will always deeply satisfy.<br />The citizens of the coastal town of Antonio Bay are proud of their town and its approaching centennial celebration. It's unfortunate the town harbors a gruesome secret dating back to 1880, but most of the residents know nothing about what the city founders did to the crew of the Elizabeth Dane on a foggy night back in the last century. Even the descendents of those hardy town fathers, one of them the town priest played by Hal Holbrook, aren't aware of the evil committed off of Spivey Point. When the discovery of a diary from one of the pioneering figures surfaces, it's far too late to stem the curse rising from the bottom of the sea. For the long dead crew of the Elizabeth Dane seeks bloody retribution for the crimes of Antonio Bay, and as the clock strikes midnight the townspeople have little idea of the terror moving in from the ocean. Now, everyone in town is fair game as ghosts with a grudge sweep through the streets. Possible victims include local radio station owner Stevie Wayne (Adrienne Barbeau), hitchhiker Elizabeth Stolley (Jamie Lee Curtis), Kathy Williams (Janet Leigh), and Nick Castle (Tom Atkins). As the body count rises and the fog grows thicker, the principal characters head to the local church and the final showdown between the ghosts and the townspeople.<br />I know several hardcore horror fans who dislike Carpenter's &quot;The Fog.&quot; They grumble about the lack of splatter effects, the reliance on fog as a crucial plot point, and the lack of screen time dedicated to Jamie Lee Curtis. Two of these arguments carry weight: there is a scarcity of gore and Jamie Lee Curtis is definitely not the star of the movie. Where I draw the line with these complaints concerns the claim that the fog doesn't provide enough chills. Like Stevie Wayne says several times during the movie, it's what's in the fog that brings disaster to the residents of Antonio Bay. The glowing, swirling mass hiding a hideous curse definitely worked for me, and it ought to work for other viewers as well. Cripes, this is a ghost story! What better way to introduce vengeful ghosts from a shipwreck than through a supernatural fog bank? Watching that pulsating fog roll in over the town bringing death to the descendents of the original settlers provided plenty of chills. Besides, if you really wish to criticize the film, look for a few improbabilities in the script. Why, for example, do the ghosts from the Elizabeth Dane seek to harm Stevie? She isn't one of the descendents of the town that the spirits hold accountable, yet the phantasms chase her with the intent of doing bodily harm. That question alone deserves more criticism than concerns over Curtis's screen time or a lack of gruesome scenes. Besides, Curtis apparently doesn't consider &quot;The Fog&quot; important enough to contribute a new interview for the DVD release. Both Janet Leigh and Adrienne Barbeau took the time to filma few comments, but Curtis is nowhere to be seen.<br />This DVD offers loads of extra goodies for the rabid Carpenter fan. Not only do you get an amazing transfer of the film in widescreen, you get other tidbits to wet your whistle. This special edition version comes with two documentaries about the film, one from 1980, the other made especially for this DVD. There are stills aplenty, a commentary with John Carpenter and screenwriter Debra Hill, tons of ultra cool television and movie screen trailers, a gallery of movie posters and advertisements, and a story board/ scene comparison. When you look at the price for the DVD, you know you're getting a great deal.<br />&quot;The Fog&quot; is great fun, a sort of old time horror tale brought up into the modern age. It's also neat to see John Houseman's introductory monologue outlining the tragedy of the Elizabeth Dane (along with Donald Pleasance's monologue in &quot;Halloween&quot; about Michael Myers, Carpenter knows how to create memorable background narratives!). Hal Holbrook's appearance here as the doomed Father Malone seems surprising, but the actor apparently appeared in another horror film around the same time, called &quot;Rituals&quot; in 1977. In fact, the ensemble cast does a great job in this creepy movie. If you're going to watch &quot;Halloween,&quot; and &quot;The Thing&quot; anytime soon, you might as well throw in &quot;The Fog&quot; while you're at it. It's worth your time.a few comments, but Curtis is nowhere to be seen. <br />This DVD offers loads of extra goodies for the rabid Carpenter fan.

B00009UW0N|5.0|Halloween, were do you start? Well one place to start is talking about the whole genre of horror films, and the fact that halloween brought on a flurry of rip-offs ranging from guys in hockey masks to guys with knifes for hands. John Carpenter had a vision with this film, and he made it a reallity, he took something that was concidered to a joke in the movie community and made a profitable buisiness. John also did this with lack of gore that some of the other slasher films had to do. He made a good film rather than a straight horror movie, that is hard to do. Still there is no getting away from the fact that Halloween is a terrifying movie, that fact ia apparant if you have ever really watched the movie. There are certain movies that are must see's and this sure one of those films. If you have seen this film buy this dvd and see the film how it was truly was to be seen, if you haven't seen this film you should buy this dvd and see what you have been missing the last 25 years. Thank you John Carpenterfor for just a great movie.
B00005BJ2O|1.0|I loved this movie and so I went out to buy the CD, and I was so disappointed when my favorite song wasn't even on there.  Ther were so many other songs I could not care less about and that were not even in the movie.  So I went on line to get the &quot;original soundtrack&quot; and when I looked up the songs on both, the songs That I wanted to hear were not on either one.  I wanted to take the CD I purchased back to the store I was so mad. Niether of these CD's are &quot;soundtracks from the movie. Niether of them have the real songs from the movie on them.  Do not waste you money.  It is NOT the sound track from the movie at all.  Never even hear of alot of the songs!!!
B000002GFC|5.0|This CD is by far the best I own! I bought this CD after listening to Cream's original records, and it is absolutely FANTASTIC! At that time (and arguably, even now), Clapton was the best guitarist, Bruce the best bassist, and Baker the best drummer, all in one band. The result is awesome. Think: B.B. King meets Jimi Hendrix. There's a bunch of blues-style songs with a rock makeover (Strange Brew, Sitting on Top of the World, Born Under a Bad Sign, Crossroads), some psychadelic songs (Sunshine of Your Love, Tales of Brave Ulysses, Those Were the Days, Deserted Cities of the Heart), and some flat-out rock songs (N.S.U., I'm So Glad, Swlabr, White Room). I could go on about the music, but the compilation itself needs description.<br />For one, they did pick the best songs over Cream's musical span (much better than the original &quot;Very Best&quot; compilation). But the eye-popping (or ear-popping, in this case) development in this CD is the famous Apogee UV/22 20-bit digital remastering. This machine makes the oldest, worst recorded songs come to life with brilliance and punch. My next favorite CD, &quot;A Window in Time: Rachmaninoff,&quot; was remastered by Apogee off of those punched-paper piano recording rolls from 1914, and it sounds perfect. Same deal with this CD. Having listened to the original records, this CD sounds better than any of the records. It is pure heaven with a surround sound home theater / stereo system. (It's recorded with Dolby Pro Logic II, which splits to 5.1 channels in a surround system.)<br />The summary: the best blues/psychadelic/rock music ever, by the best rock musicians ever, on the best remastered CD ever. What else can I say but listen to the song samples and/or buy the best CD for long-time or future Cream listeners!
B00005YW4H|5.0|I was hesitant to buy this album initially.  However, after hearing it once, I was glad I did.  Great for rlaxing after a hard day.
B000002GFC|5.0|In 1966, some of the best young musicians (literally, the cream) of the British music scene put together the ultimate blues supergroup. From the Yardbirds and John Mayall: guitar prodigy Eric Clapton (who was inspired to put together a trio after hearing a blues threesome album by Buddy Guy and Junior Wells); from the Graham Bond organization: Jack Bruce, bass, and Ginger Baker, drums. Over the course of three years, this amazing group absolutely redefined British blues, mixing in elements of hard rock, jazz, and even classical music. This compilation does indeed represent the very best of Cream, with one or two exceptions. Of course, all the classic rock FM staples are here: Sunshine of Your Love, Badge, Crossroads, White Room, SWLABR (translation: She Walks Like a Bearded Rainbow---did I mention Cream had a psychedelic streak???) Also, it is worth noting that even though Cream was a superb live band, only one live cut (Crossroads) is included here. Smart move, considering that in almost every case, the studio recordings are better than their live counterparts. Too bad this album is not quite perfect: &quot;We're Going Wrong,&quot; must be counted as a good, but failed, experimental number, and &quot;Anyone for Tennis&quot; can be dismissed as a silly trifle. However, &quot;Wrapping Paper,&quot; though atypical Cream, still sounds as fresh today as the album it came from. On balance, though, the album is a superb overview for the experienced and novice listener alike. After this album, the listener will want to skim through Fresh Cream, Disraeli Gears, and Wheels of Fire (you would do well to ignore Goodbye, Cream, which is a patchwork monstrosity). Trust me, you'll be all the &quot;butter&quot; for it!
B000055Y0X|5.0|I'll admit that the first time I saw DR. STRANGELOVE, I thought it was merely good.  An enjoyable film, but not one of the greatest films of all time, or so I believed.  But I liked enough of it to give it a second chance.  And then I gave it a third chance.  And a fourth.<br />I've probably seen this film six or seven times now, and each viewing brings something new to my appreciation.  From individual ad-libs by Peter Sellers to the complete absurdity of the whole situation, there is just too much hilarity to recount in one review.  Each of the actors appears to be having an absolute blast reciting their subversively funny lines.  Special mention must go to Peter Sellers playing three characters, and managing to make them all unique and individually funny.  Group-Captain Mandrake, the straight-laced British Air Force officer trying to prevent a disaster.  The U.S. President trying to limit the fallout (no pun intended) of that disaster.  And, of course, Dr. Strangelove himself, the ex-Nazi scientist whipped into such a frenzy in anticipation of the disaster that he delivers cinema one of its most recognizable lines.  (The fact that Dr. Strangelove's unique voice was apparently based on some actual person is almost as frightening as anything in the movie; I cannot imagine any real-life human being sounding like this Third Reich Muppet.)<br />Director Stanley Kubrick coaxes some wonderful performances out of the rest of the cast too.  George C. Scott is wickedly fun as the over-the-top General who isn't quite sure of what all the fuss is about.  Sterling Hayden is an utter riot as the cigar-smoking, paranoid General firing shots through his office window to protect his precious bodily fluids from the evil Communists.  And who can forget Slim Pickens, whose final scene is perhaps one of the most surreal and hilarious in film history. <br />Much of the humor comes from the wonderful juxtaposition of the horrific with the mundane.  The discussions over exactly how manymillion will be wiped out, and the efforts of the US to get the Soviet Premier on the telephone are both diabolically absurd, and probably closer to the truth than anyone realized.<br />This special edition DVD is quite good value for what it offers.  First of all, the film itself looks to be in excellent condition.  Yes, the aspect ratio changes throughout, but that's the way Kubrick intended it.  The sound is also crisp; the echoes of footsteps in the War Room and Major Kong's yelping both come through equally clear.<br />The DVD also contains a few mini-documentaries.  \\"The Art of Stanley Kubrick\\" highlights Kubrick's film career leading up to the filming of DR. STRANGELOVE.  Hardcore Kubrick fans will probably already know most of what is discussed, but I found it to be a very informative look at the parts of Kubrick's filmography that I was least familiar with.<br />\\"Inside The Making Of Dr. Strangelove\\" combines many interviews with still-living members of the cast and crew as they recall their memories of working on this film.  Some of the more famous anecdotes are recalled (such as Slim Pickens' line of having \\"a pretty good time in Dallas\\" being changed to \\"Vegas\\" because of the assassination of JFK) as well as some more obscure bits of trivia that I hadn't heard before (the fact that many of the crew upon first seeing Slim Pickens thought he had arrived in costume, when in fact he was just dressing as he normally did).<br />DR. STRANGELOVE is a truly great and hilarious movie.  Thankfully, this DVD release is worthy of one of Kubrick's best films.  If you already love this film, this disc is worth picking up immediately.  If you've never seen it before, I suggest at least a rental is in order.
B0000942HV|4.0|I actualy enjoyed this re-rendering, if only because it shows how creatively bankrupt Oldfield has been in the last 15 years or so, and how fantastic this work really is, even 30 years on. And the awful wah-wah guitar tone he has favoured of late only makes a couple of appearances on this CD. It's really a pretty sad state of affairs for an artist to not only re-interperet his most famous work umpteen times, but to then re-create it, note perfectly, er, for what? Like George Lucas digitally &quot;enhancing&quot; his original Star Wars movies, what's the point? You made the statement, leave the damn thing alone, it's done already! Still love the album, but Mike, please retire or help the homeless if this is all you have to offer.
B000001FI7|5.0|I am a recovering trip-hop addict. For about a 4 years I ate up just about anything with the words trip-hop or downbeat attached to it. Sure there was a lot of quality albums there from groups like Massive Attack, Portishead, and the first Tricky album, but there was also a lot of [stuff] like the Sneaker Pimps and every other Tricky album. Now I know better. Just because somethings slow and dark doesn't necessarily mean its brilliant. <br />Portishead is different though. Beth Gibbons backs up the dark music and lyrical gloom with the most beuatifully raspy alto I've ever heard. There are more samples than I can possibly count but they all seem to blend together so tightly that you could swear that this album was recorded by studio musicians (I meant that as a compliment). Theyre self titled album is great too, but i dont think that it or any other album in the genre could ever surpass Dummy.
B000001E18|4.0|When i first listened to the album, i wasn't really impressed with it, but i warmed up to it eventually. Lemon and Stay were favorites from the beginning, but i did like the rest of them. Eventually, i heard other versions of the songs, either on the Live from Sydney video or remixed for b-sides, etc.... I realized that maybe U2 hadn't spent enough time on them. I prefer the live version of &quot;Daddy's Gonna Pay...&quot; where Bono actually sings the lyrics rather than just says them. The remixed versions of Dirty Day (from Staring at the Sun single and Best of) is a much more complete version of the song. Numb definitely sounds better on the Best of, I actually like it now. Aside from the title track, the rest of the album's tracks could have been b-sides.  But despite it's faults, the album is still a keeper, if only for Lemon and Stay, and for those two songs i give the album its four stars!
B000002UJQ|5.0|What can I say that hasn't been said already. This album changed my life and changed the way I looked at music. Its every bit as relavant now as it was when I was in eight grade. Ive noticed that this album has gone down to 4.5 stars, so i feel like its my responsibility to give it a little boost. Just Doing my part.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Excellent CD for those easy going moments when you need to unwind with or without a nice glass of wine. This is also great snuggle up music. Hope everyone enjoys it as much as I do!
B00005Y1XZ|5.0|I'm so sick of packing for college, I go back on saturday. I really need a break. Ahh, nothing like cdnow reviews to kill time. <br />Anyway, I'm living proof that this album is an alltime great enjoyed by people of all ages.  I love it, my friends love it, my friends parents love it. Every song is hummable and instantly burrows its way deep into your head where it wont come out for weeks. On top of that, this is a lyrical masterpiece only topped by my Aim is true (who else would use the term rhythmically admired). It may not be as diverse as the later albums but its our last chance to hear good old-school hard rocking elvis. This should be considered required listening for any rock mucic fan. Do yourself a favor and buy this and if you already have it buy it for someone who doesnt.
B0000AI44Q|4.0|Greendale is the best thing Neil and Crazy Horse have done since Ragged Glory in fact to these ears it harkens back to that style. Greendale is loaded with expressive guitar work and melodies that will have you humming if not singing along after a few listens. Yes this is a story set to music however except for 2 which sound more like story narration the songs all sound great by themselves just like any wonderful Neil Young &amp; Crazy Horse song. Bottom line if you love Neil Young you won't be disappointed here and if you were a fan of Ragged Glory era Neil &amp; Crazy Horse you'll really enjoy Greendale.
B00005JLH3|2.0|Don't even think about making band look as cool as playing football. An extended music video with very awkward performances. The music-video pieces have a few scenes worth watching but overall they should have spent a few more months on writing the story.
B000092ZYX|2.0|I'm sorry folks, but I have to step back and call it like it is-this album's simply boring and overrated, with the exception of the stand-out cut &quot;There, There.&quot;  I've tried to like it and gave it repeated listenings.  A let-down from the edge and intensity of &quot;Amnesiac.&quot;
B00002E23E|5.0|I lot of people have put this down, but to me it is truly a spectacular show....even with the dream sequences. I just fast forward thru some of them. From what I've read, the crew they hired to film the concert didn't keep the cameras rolling all the way thru some of the songs. So they had to put something in there to take up the space of the missing footage while you heard the song being played. I agree the dream sequences are a bit silly, but it does show a side to each of their personaities at that time in their lives. You have to remember that this was shot in 1973, people...30 yrs. ago! For not having today's technology, you have to admit that it doesn't sound that bad and the picture quality is quite good! I think Jimmy's solos are exceptional! Dazed and Confused does go on quite a bit too long, but that's what made him a legendary guitarist...his improvosational skills were unmatched by any guitarist then, and since, and he does a supurb job of showing that off in this film! The band has enormous energy which is plain to see. Their talent is also unmatched. I highly recommend this film to any Zeppelin fan or really to anyone who wants to witness the best guitar player on this planet and the most talented band that ever graced the face of this earth!
B0000AXE8I|3.0|the movie starts off so yawn inducingly boring, that the rest of the movie suffered.  I guess the freeway sequence was nice, and I'm sure you can dig for meaningful messeges in the movie.  But that was all lost to me all because of how utterly slow and boring and meaningless the first 1/3 of the movie was.  <br />Hungry and fearful Zionians dancing like they're in a 21st century hot night spot?  Less then erotic sex scene?  I could have stomached maybe a minute of those.  But these went on and on and on.  And to make it worst, this was all triggered by what was supposed to be an inspiring speech given by morpheus.  Only thing I got was a pitiful chuckle as Lawrence Fishburn tried to mix stern calmness with fiery rhetorics, only to fail miserably.<br />I was seriously considering leaving the theater and maybe rent a DVD or something at this point in the movie.  But I stayed put, mainly because I rode with my friends and I wasn't the driver.  No choice.  So I groaned and watched the rest of the movie in state of boredom.  It wasn't until I finished watching the film and started discussing it with my friends at a local restaurant that I started to 'get' the movie.  <br />I consider this a renter, but if you already own the first movie, might as well own the second in the trilogy.
0688170528|5.0|This book was recommended by a former co-worker of mine, but the concept alone is what motivated me to actually read it. I'm usually leery when someone tries to introduce me to an author I'd never read before, but I'm so glad I made an exception.  Not only did the story move me, but her ability to humanize a character is what makes this an amazing book.  I don't think I've read a more emotional story.  Reading about a character's grief and actually feeling it yourself are two totally different things, and with The Pact, I felt every emotion these characters had.  It is a story unlike any I've ever read and I put this book on my list of favorites.
B0000AI44Q|4.0|Neil Young long ago passed the point where needs to please anyone but himself.  The man is undisputedly one of the kings of rock and roll, and as far as I, and many others are concerned, he can do whatever he wants.  The results of this attitude have had mixed results.  Some good - &quot;Comes A Time&quot;, some bad - &quot;Trans&quot;.<br />What he wanted to do this time was tell a simple story of a town, and it has ended up being possibly his best album in almost a decade.  It's heavier and less heartsy - a departure from recent albums such as &quot;Silver and Gold&quot; and &quot;Are You Passionate?&quot;  It sounds less like the newer Neil we have heard for the past few albums, and more like old Neil, staying up until the wee hours, having a few beers and jamming with Crazy Horse.<br />Fans of such earlier albums like &quot;Ragged Glory&quot; and &quot;Mirrorball&quot; will indeed be pleased.  &quot;Greendale&quot; is not his best, but it proves that Neil Young has still got some rock in him, and is not quite ready to rest on his laurels just yet.
0385504209|4.0|OPUS DEI is an anagram of OEDIPUS. I'm surprised they missed that one. Robert Graves and others  claim the source of the classic Greek OEDIPUS is Akhenaten. Rosicrucian Leader Spencer Lewis identifies Akhenaten as a prior incarnation of Christ. Osman claims Akhenaten was both Moses and Oedipus. And Freud is convinced the Jews killed Moses in the desert as they killed Christ in Rome--the classic patricide or Oedipal complex as performed by a cultural group. There's plenty of psuedo-history, myth and innuendo out there for a sequel :)
B0000057C5|5.0|...  I tend to notice that the main driving force of the song is Till Lindemann's grungy, abrasive voice that all the more gives such a unique sound to the Teutonic-like music of Rammstein. Though short instrumental solos in the songs do further the songs, Lindemann I think progresses the songs. I say this mainly because, mostly, the guiter riff has a certain pattern - sometimes for the entire song (you could say the guitar is something of a more ambient set of drums)! <BR>     I remember reading a little about Rammstein, and one of the initial purposes of the band was to make monotonous, even boring heavy metal (Schneider, a band member, said that in an interview, anyway)! <BR>     That of which the monotony is the main reason for all those 1 star reviews. Those same reviewers seem to like to hold comtempt for the masses that like them, claiming the lyrics are infantile, etc. Who cares? I don't really care what they're saying, as long as the general melody is good. If I like what the masses like, then so be it. <BR>     Even if you're not much of a heavy metal fan (as I'm not), you'll probably like this (unless you're either a esoteric art lover who hates any conception of a chorus within a song, OR you're just contemptuous with hate of anything that over a million people enjoy because you're a &quot;thinking man&quot;). I personally find this to be a awesome album, even if some of the songs sound a little similar to each other.
1563898586|4.0|L'histoire de cettte bande dessiné n'a rien avoir avec le film.  Les personnages comme Allan Quatermain, Capitaine Nemo, L'homme invisible, dr. Jekyll et Mina Murray sont présents mais dans une histoire et un contexte différents.  c'est ce qui donne son charme.  Bien dessiné et bien imaginé, on en vient presque a préféré cette BD qu'au film mais il ne doit y avoir aucune comparaison car les deux oeuvres font leur histoires sur a peu près des bases différentes.<br />En résumé, très bonne histoire illutrée de façon magnifique et l'histoire nous surprend d'un bout a l'autre par les habitudes plus choquantes qu'on ne montre pas au grand écrant.
076790592X|5.0|I am not a person who has been living a long time.  I am 17, but Tuesdays with Maurie made me think of life in a whole different way.  I read Tuesdays with Maurie on and off for over a year.  The book is excellent, I just have been very busy with work and school.  While reading Tuesdays with Maurie, I felt guilty sometimes of feeling bad for myself when I had a bad day.  Maurie is somebody that anybody, and everybody, could look up to.  No matter how bad his problem was, ALS was his, he would always insist to hearing Mitch's first.  Maurie was an individual that anybody could have one up to and would immediately feel better.  Although I never actually met Maurie, I feel like i knew him as well as anybody.  Maurie is truly one of teh most genuine kind-hearted people I have ever known.  Through other people's love for him, something he will always be remembered by, Maurie has made a positive impact on people like me everywhere.  I not only recomend this book, I STRONGLY advise you to read this book.  I have never said there is a book everybody should read, but Tuesdays with Maurie might just be the book that changes that.
6305907145|1.0|Another film in the grand tradition of directors who think they can improve on great authors.  This film is so unlike Jane Austen's beautiful novel in all its essentials as to be unrecognizable.  Austen's Fanny Price, it has been said, is a heroine who succeeds because of her refusal to DO anything (including budge).  Here, she is turned into a feminist fireball.  Worse and worse . . . the director actually has her accept the scoundrel's proposal of marriage, something Austen's immobile and faithful Fanny would never do.  The director throws in all kinds of peripheral non-necessities, distracts from the story as much as possible, and destroys all possible subtlety in the process.  Just goes to show you . . . if you have a story to tell, don't try and pass it off as a great author's just to gain legitimacy.  Especially if your story is worth a lot less than the original.  Avoid this movie; read the book.
B00009V7RF|2.0|I'm not really sure I know what BEP where thinking. This album is a joke! Some tracks are laughable, like track 5 \\"Shut Up.\\" Is this a joke? I thought that after a decent effort with their first record which had two amazing tracks on it, \\"Fallin' Up\\" and \\"Joints & Jams\\", that this band would be amazing. Those tracks made me really excited for their second album \\"Bridging the Gap.\\" That album was truly amazing and I put BEP up there with the hip hop greats. Every song on that album is amazing. This album is such a huge dissapointment after that! One of the true characteristics of a truly great artist is some sort of consistancy. BEP have completely embarrassed themselves in my mind. I don't mind Justin Timberlake on a track if its good but there are no good tracks on this album. There is a JB's sample on track 2 \\"Labor Day.\\" The JB's have been used so many times by so many artists that them using it seems so boring. I'm truly dissappointed with this album, I hope they regroup, rethink and get rid the singer for the next record.
B00005JLSE|1.0|Yes, musicals are really about the music and dancing, and less about the story. Unfortunately, this one seems like the actors were having coffee one day, and all said &quot;hey, wouldn't it be fun to be in a musical so we could all sing and dance??&quot;. I can't for the life of me understand why or how this piece of &quot;art&quot; got any awards, or any repeat views. I like musicals, but not this one.
B00009APK1|5.0|Its rare nowadays that Hollywood actually produces something that is both visually stunning while being able to tell a very well crafted and enthralling story.  Having read all three of the books numerous times, (front, back and the appendices!), the movies are genuine works of cinematic art.  The scenery is breathtaking, the acting is superb and its amazing at how much attention to detail was given to the sets, costumes, makeup, etc...  Despite a few departures from the book, both Fellowship of the Ring and the Two Towers succeed on a grand scale of transferring a very complex novel onto film.  I agree with the person who commented that no one, including &quot;purists&quot;, would want to watch a 15 hour movie!  That is why there are novels, one can read all the minute details at one's own pace.  Furthermore, I urge overly zealous purists not to allow a few details ruin the sheer enjoyment of these marvelous films, they are well worth watching!  So, pop your popcorn, grab your beverage, turn down the lights and enjoy the show :)

I read Tuesdays with Maurie on and off for over a year.  The book is excellent, I just have been very busy with work and school.

B00009V7T2|1.0|I bought this album after hearing all the positive reviews about them and how they sound like some classic bands (i.e Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin). Now if you like to listen to classic rock with the bass all the way down and the trebble set to the max then we might be comparing these bands. All i could hear was Rush, and i hate Rush. I usually give bands a few tries before judging but i like my ears, so i opted to throw the cd out my window and beat my ears against my steering wheel, an obviously more enjoyable experience. Everybody's entitled to their own likes in music; people liked Rush, i personally don't get it. IF YOU HATE THE GROUP RUSH LIKE I DO, STAY AWAY! I am definatley not a pop music fan which is why i bought this album in the first place, i like to hear goups that are unique in these days of \\"hey, look at me, we sound like Lincoln Park too.\\" This album just has a sound i hate.
0792833236|5.0|This movie is truly a masterpiece.  <br />Why is it a masterpiece?  Simply put, Robert De Niro pulls off one of the most believable performances I've seen in any movie.  You truly believe that he is Jake La Motta, who is the \\"Raging Bull\\" of a boxer to which the title refers.  La Motta is not a likable character by any means, but the strength of the movie is that he is a believable character.  It's a fascinating story of how a person's life can spiral down into destruction, and Scorcese's no holds barred approach makes it all the more believable.
B00008NG5V|5.0|Having never heard a single song from his acclaimed debut, \\"Brushfire Fairytales\\", I as a reviewer can make no intelligent comment about how Jack Johnson's latest, \\"On and On\\" sounds similar.  Personally, considering how excellent this disc is, I can't imagine this being a bad thing.  Familiar sounding or not, On and On is an excellent, consistent album.  <br />Jack Johnson is not what I would typically pick up, nor is his laid back Bob Marley-like vibe a quality I often seek out in my music.  But as someone who tries to give any artist a chance, Jack Johnson seems as worthy as anyone to capture my listening ear.  And capture my ear he does, with sixteen tracks that echo of simplicity and pleasant sunrises.  Each song features light, jazzy acoustic guitar rhythms and Johnson's sincere, calm vocals, helping each one flow gently and effortlessly into the other, like the ebb and flow of tides on the beach.  <br />But Jack Johnson's not just another Bob Marley come lately.  Like Marley, Johnson has another trick up his sleeve - he has something to say as well.  You'd have to scour the lyric book to notice them, but buried beneath the laid-back melodies is commentary championing simplicity, conservationism, basic kindness, and challenging the media, SUV culture, and materialism outright.  It's not quite Thoreau with a guitar, or even \\"Get Up, Stand Up\\" but you'd have to be really close-minded to not get swept up in these grooves.  <br />The ultimate musical treatise for simplicity and quiet activism, \\"On and On\\" is absolutely essential listening for warm summer days, driving across the country, and simplifying.  If this album can't help you relax, you had better see a doctor.
B000003AEB|5.0|Snoop Doggy Dogg's solo debut album \\"Doggystyle\\" (1993) is without a doubt a Hip Hop classic. A few months from now this cd will officially be ten years old and in my opinion it still has great replay value and remains Snoop's best album. Guest appearances and vocals which are excellent on this release come from: The Dogg Pound (Daz & Kurupt), Nate Dogg, Warren G, The Dramatics, Dr. Dre,D.O.C. RBX Lady of Rage & Nancy Fletcher. Executive produced by Suge Knight, track production which is phenomenal is looked after by Dr. Dre. I like every joint on this thirteen track release, some of favourites include the laidback timeless party/cruise tracks hits \\"Gin & Juice\\" , the funkified \\"Who Am I (What's My Name)?\\" memorable \\"Doggy Dogg World\\"  & the getting laid song \\"Ain't No Fun (If the Homies Can't Have None). Snoop and Company come harder on the  street classic \\"Murder was the Case\\",  deadly 4 way collabo of Snoop, Daz, Kurupt and RBX on \\"Serial Killa\\" and the standout piano based \\"Gz and Hustlas\\". No doubt that the guest appearances are good, however Snoop really is the star of the show dropping rhymes to remember, with a flow that is truly addictive to listen to. Snoop's \\"Doggystyle\\" (as well as Dre. Dre's Chronic)has been like a Blueprint for many West Coast rappers often imitated never duplicated. Another thing that makes this album great is that anyone can enjoy it whether they be a Hip Hop head or someone new to the genre. This is a very good example of original West Coast Hip Hop: full of excellent beats, tight production, memorable lyrics, an album for anyone who loves quality Hip Hop.

Driving across town in the middle of the night, climbing up a ladder and into her sons bedroom reminded me of something out of Psycho or at the very least Serial Mom. What would you do if your mother did this?

B00006BTCA|4.0|But if only the 80's were this sweet. These guys take the best of what the 80's could be. I can also find these guys comparable to the strokes, in that they are both unique, they sound inspired by 80's rock, and they are both good (as is Hot Hot Heat, Kings of Leon, Spoon). I am not an 80's music fan at all, i just can hear the influence, i think anyone could. Give this album a few tries and you'll be hooked. Also, the free MP3 they give on this website &quot;NYC&quot; is by no means their best, they rock out a lot better elsewhere on the cd.
B00005JKZV|4.0|For the hardcore LOTR fans who don't want to buy two versions of The Two Towers - wait until the extended edition is available in November.  I just received the first version only to find out about an extended one not yet released.  More deserves 5.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Like it or not...I rate some movies by how often I will watch bits (or scenes) when they're shown on tv/cable.  And Donnie Darko has been on HBO a lot.  And from the first time that I saw the ending scene with the song Mad World, I was hooked.<br />Every time I see this is on TV as I'm flipping channels, I absolutely MUST stop and look.  So I finally went ahead and bought it.  (I won't go into the main plot line or details, as you can read those in many other reviews.)<br />It is just so interesting and weird and different.  So many different story lines that come together so well.  But at the same time, you never quite fully understand it.  (You think, if I just watch it again, maybe I'll finally get it.)  And the Darko family, all five of them, are so perfect as actors and characters.  There is a great cast of supporting roles.  Throw in the time travel and the school and the talent show...You have to see it.

B00002Z88D|2.0|Monolithic thundergods of pummelling Uzi beats, methamphetamine guitar chords and malnourished coyote howling from the crumbling abyss of the apocalypse, Metallica pair up with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra for two discs of live revisions of their greatest hits (Master of Puppets, For Whom the Bell Tolls, One, Enter Sandman). No doubt it was a noble thought; you know, transform the staid and ultra-serious multi-member orchestra in to a Satanic philharmonic backup band for speed metal's ruling agitators and have a go at the gruesome repetoire. `Word to critics -we're musical visionaries, not cow-brained macho metal gits.' Unfortunately, the result is the opposite: Metallica's rumbling menace has been dumbed down to cadaver stiff scope, as if the boys had been tucked in to tight tuxedos and chained to the music stands of their orchestral counterparts for good measure. The orchestra fare no better. With sheer volume against them, the only tangible element of the symphony discernible beneath the blitzkreig of crunching - if uncomfortably brassbound - mammoth metal of Hetfield et al. are brief and elementary flashes of desperate string accompaniment that at best sound cursory and at worst utterably ridiculous sewn to the leathery fabric of the infidel chaos up front. The Thing That Should Not Be indeed.
B00007LTIG|4.0|This is the Grateful Dead's first album.  Like many of the early psychodelic, San Francisco albums, it sounds slightly dated.  But it is not as dated (or wierd) as the Dead's second and third albums.  <br />This album contains some of the Dead's best songs of all time, like Cold Rain and Snow.  It has the best version of Morning Dew of anyone (even Nazereth).  <br />Rhino (which is now owned by Warner Brothers) has done an excellent job of remastering all of the Warner Brothers' Grateful Dead albums.  The sound quality is excellent.  On this album, they also used the &quot;full lenghth version&quot; of many of the songs.  The tracks around 10 to 20 seconds longer than what was on the original LP.<br />The other thing Rhino did on these re-issues was to add bonus tracks, using up every second of the CD, so that they are all 79 minutes long.  The nice thing about the bonus material, is that there is a long pause between the end of the original material and the start of the bonus material.  This allows you to fully take in the original album before being disrupted by the bonus material, which usually doesn't fit in with the flow of the original music.<br />The bonus material is interesting.  A few studio tracks and then a 23 minute live version of Viola Lee Blues.  It is a very nice version of the song.  The only problem is that they ran out of disc space, and it all doesn't fit, so there is an awkard fade in and fade out.<br />The Grateful Dead and the Allman Brothers must have met at one time and shared ideas.  There are places here where Garcia sounds like Duane Allman, and there are places on Live at Ludlow's Garage where the Allman Brothers sound like Gerry Garcia.
B000002I6T|5.0|Funny thing about the rock era.  It celebrated freedom, but pigeonholed musicians in ways other forms would never do.  David Crosby, for example:  He was pigeonholed in the &quot;singer-songwriter&quot; category, like Neil Young, Jackson Browne or Joni Mitchell.  And then was seen as somehow less than all of them, because he didn't have that string of solo albums that made a generation weep.<br />What David Crosby best compares to is a great jazz musician who usually appears as a sideman, but occasionally steps out front. His specialty was harmony--vocal harmony, and also on the rhythm guitar. In that role, he was unique, and brilliant. It's impossible to think about the Byrds' classic era without him. He's right there, harmonizing away on timeless hits like &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; and &quot;Turn Turn Turn.&quot;  His contributions as a harmony singer were every bit as important to the group's special sound as McGuinn's 12-string.  His musical choices were never obvious; he drew upon jazz and classical influences, as well as now-obscure harmony singing groups like the Swingle Singers and the Four Freshmen. Almost as a sideline, he wrote a handful of songs for the Byrds.  They were few in number, but each one stood out as a highly original composition.  Songs like &quot;Why,&quot; &quot;Tribal Gathering,&quot; &quot;I See You,&quot; &quot;Dolphin's Smile,&quot; and especially &quot;Everybody's Been Burned,&quot; and the long-supressed &quot;Triad&quot; stand the test of time as well as any songs written in the 1960s.<br />Okay so what about this album?  As a singer/songwriter solo album, it's very weird.  Many of the songs are sung in syllables without words.  Others are mere chants, repeated phrases.  There are three fully realized songs with words and music, verses and choruses, and two of them, &quot;Laughing&quot; and &quot;Traction in the Rain&quot; are among his very best songs ever, accompanied by some of the most beautiful arrangements both vocally and instrumentally.  The third, &quot;Cowboy Movie,&quot; isn't quite at that level, but it's got a great, psychedelic groove.  But--&quot;Blood on the Tracks&quot; it ain't.<br />Judged on its own terms, however, I think this is a great album, one that is long past due for rediscovery.  If you appreciate the unique talents of David Crosby as a singer, musician, writer and a scenemaker (the album is a who's who of California hippie rock stars), this album puts his gifts on display to better effect than almost anything else his name appears on.  The wordless singing on songs like &quot;Song with No Words,&quot; &quot;Orleans&quot; and &quot;I'd Swear There Was Somebody Here&quot; is beautiful and highly effective.  The illustrious musicians play brilliantly, but humbly.  Jerry Garcia is particularly amazing here, playing with almost symphonic effect on &quot;Laughing.&quot;  You can also pick out, here and there, some great performances by Phil Lesh, Graham Nash, and Neil Young--but no one seems too impressed with themselves here.  The album strikes me today as a perfect moment in time, captured for all time, and perhaps even more enjoyable today than it was back in the hippie era from which it sprung.and instrumentally.

6304712944|5.0|This movie is adapted from &quot;The Once and Future King&quot; by T.H. White.  And you probably know the story - boy becomes king, king is betrothed in an arranged marriage, Lancelot pops in....It is _nothing_ like the book but it does have its good points.<br />One is Richard Harris' over the top performance as King Arthur. He, much in the manner of Rex Harrison in &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, speaks his songs as opposed to singing them. Suprisingly, it actually works very well. It's not the &quot;feel good movie&quot; of all time, but it is a good one about flawed individuals - and it was said to be President John F. Kenndy's favorite Broadway play.<br />So if you're interested in seeing a movie that will make you think about great leaders' errors in judgement, along with the pagentry of court life, this is a movie for you. I recommend it highly.
B000002UZ4|5.0|As a product of the '80s, the Pet Shop Boys is one of my favorite synth-pop groups from that era of MTV, acid-washed jeans, hair crimping, and leg warmers. PSB's music is some of the catchiest pop songs I had ever heard at the time. I strongly remember seeing music videos for songs like \\"Opportunites (Lets Make Lots of Money)\\" and \\"West End Girls\\". Back then I didn't care if one of the guys was gay. I still don't care to this day. PSB's music is irresistably infectious and still fun to listen to. Although Neil and Chris are still putting out music to this very day, their '80s material is the group's most popular and well-known to the public. No matter how many times I listen to \\"Opportunities\\", I still love the catchiness of the song and the total irony of the song considering the time of the release of the song (the '80s being filled with materialism). I thought PSB did an amazing job on covering U2's \\"Where the Streets Have No Name\\", one of the handful of songs that really shouldn't be covered in general. PSB always does some pretty incredible covers like they did with the Village People's \\"Go West\\" on their \\"Very\\" cd. Although times has changed (and not for the better), songs like \\"Suburbia\\" and \\"Always On My Mind\\" still holds up well but that may be due to my fondness for the days when MTV played music videos and had no \\"Real World\\", \\"Road Rules\\", and other non-music related programming. I thought \\"Discography\\" was...is a thorough collection of Neil and Chris' earlier music. I think it will give casual listeners a good idea of PSB's music when new wave music was big.

B00005JLXE|2.0|Too cheesy.  How does going blind give you flea-like jumping abilities?  All the characters (other than king-pin) were just boring and flat or over-acted.  The fight scenes even looked completely fake and horrible.  Suspending disbelief is not a possiblity in this movie.  Not even for a second.  I don't expect much realism out of a superhero movie, but yikes.  This is just poo.  Apparently in this world gravity is slightly lower (or occasionally non-existant...) than our Earth...  Speed Racer was more realistic, maybe they'll turn that into a superhero movie next.

B00005JKZV|5.0|The Twin Towers is a sizzling page turner for the eyes, a magnificent effort.  I was most taken by the taffey-like tug of war within the minds of Gollum and Frodo.  There were only a few minor stumbles and who cares if the storyline was not followed exactly as we are swept away with dazzling special effects and scintillating action.<br />Gollum had to win the character prize in my eyes, a breathtaking job by Andy Serkis depicting Gollum as the wiry,anguished, twitching, tortured and pathetic Barney Fife in a loin cloth.  The rescue of Frodo in the spooky bog cemented a bond of trust that was heartbreakingly broken later.<br />Gollum stole the show, but the Ents saved the day as the powerful sheperds of the forest put on a dazzling visual feast, smashing orcs and wrecking Saruman's realm.  Chris Lee is without peer as an actor as he plays the ice-cold Sauruman, but the Ents had the normally stoic Sauruman scrambling in disbelief at his evil console, an unforgetable blow against evil.<br />This epic is full of transformations to go along with the continuing wonderful performances of Gimli, Legolas and even Aragorn.  Grima Wormtongue is a wonderful addition, the type of slippery and evil character that makes you want to head for the showers just for looking at him.<br />This movie is a must see and must buy.  I'm glad that I waited for the DVD widescreen, the pictures and sounds on a HD Plasma were top notch, as is the movie.  Top pick!

I am 17 and I have loved this movie for as long as I can remember; it's even better now, because I am old enough to appreciate its wonderful messages and morals. It's an anti-animal cruelty flick seen from the animals' point of view and pointing out the ignorance of the humans, and a realistic depiction of how cruel and unjust the world can be, and what can be done to overcome despite it all. Anyway, for those of you who aren't familiar with the plot (get your heads out of your rears and watch this, PLEASE) it's the story of a baby elephant delivered to Jumbo on a circus train from a stork. He is immediately derided by the fellow elephants and human audience because of his oversized ears. The only ones who who show any compassion are his mother Jumbo, and his friends-a mouse named Timothy and a flock of crows who give him support and encouragement.<BR>I love the cleverness and depth of this movie- the mother and friends that stick up for him even if it results in sacrifices for themselves (Jumbo being confined from the other elephants for \\"disorderly conduct\\"), the loving bond between mother and son, and the anti-discrimination messages. By the way, this movie isn't racist, I know for a fact that it's ANTI-racist (uncountable reasons why that would require an entire separate review) and the crow scene was not intended to demean black culture but embrace it, (with a black cast); many people misread the content and took it the wrong way, seeing as most things at the time were condemnable and ignominious. Pretty outstanding for 1941 when there was still so much bigotry in the US. The same thing happened with the 1942 cartoon \\"Coal Black the Seven Dwarfs\\". And the \\"Roustabouts\\" scene wasn't bigoted, either. It's just a fact that in those days it was common for brothers to be willing to take the [bad] jobs if better ones weren't available, am I right? I am black myself telling you all of this, so does that make any of this more convincing? I'm not nave and I discern racism when I see it. The completely different selection of writers and blackless cast for the monkey scene in the Jungle Book, however, is an entirely different situation, but lets not get into that. If you are one of the neurotically oversensitive people who DO thing this movie's racist, your kids won't know anyway unless you rub it in their faces; you're only aggravating things. <BR>Anyway, the parts of the movie that will delight people of all ages are the quaint and adorable animation of the animals and the classic catchy songs. My faves are the cute \\"Look Out For Mr. Stork\\", the clever pun-filled soul song \\"When I See An Elephant Fly\\", the hypnotic \\"Elephants On Parade\\", the catchy tunes \\"Casey Junior\\" and \\"Roustabouts\\"... they're all so good. The few good characters are lovable- benevolent Jumbo, cute little Dumbo/Jumbo Jr., the witty and hilarious (and cute may I add-I love cartoon birds) crows, the charismatic Timothy, and \\"good ol'\\" Mr. Stork. I detest the rest of the characters. The heartless elephants, that awful red-haired kid teasing Jumbo Jr., the selfish Mussoliniesque circus trainer who had disregard for the well-being and proper husbandry of the animals, and the *cough* clowns. Those are the most hideous clowns I have ever seen and have lurked in my nightmares as a child. What I also don't like about this film are the alcohol/drug references, anti or not. Although it may not do too much harm being that to the younger naive audience it will have no significance and to the older audience simply amusing and humorous, I still find the idea of an infant elephant getting drunk in a children's movie a little disturbing. And that psychedelic pink elephant scene- try and tell me that there weren't stoners involved in the writing and production of thatpart of the movie. As a little kid I thought it was entertaining on the eyes, now it makes me laugh, but I still can't help but wonder why that didn't frighten me as a small child. And how the neglecting elephants all of sudden started respecting Dumbo just because he was famous? That always made me outraged.<BR>Despite of the film's few blunders, there are many times more good qualities that could make me care less. This movie literally is a classic.
B000002A3T|4.0|This is a good album. People will always complain that it's not the original Pink Floyd without Rogers fronting, well, i'll tell you strait: the band with Rogers fronting isn't the original floyd either, so stop your bitching. We'd all have been better off with Syd staying on as the frontman, then we would have been able to enjoy floyd's dreamy creative peak with a sense of good humor too. I don't care if you enjoyed Rogers more or not, this IS pink floyd, and this is another good album by them, that DOESN'T sounds like a Rogers-era album, which is a plus. Would you prefer they imitated Rogers?
B00008X5J1|5.0|I saw the movie in the theater, couldn't wait for the video, then bought the book.  I thought it should have won the Oscar, I found it kept me riveted to my seat, and left me with many questions as to how & why all this happened.  As a historical researcher, the story told of true events & how the Immigrants fought for survival in a country that offered a lot of grief & corruption due to greed.  How many of our Immigrants came to really love this country & help build a nation of unbelievable patriotism is truly an amazing story.  One more note, Native Americans are not New Yorkers, they are the Indian Tribes.
B00008J4P5|4.0|This is a great cd, and was the first I heard of The White Stripes. After acquiring this cd, I ended up getting everything of theirs I could. This one has songs that rank with their best, but their best cd to me is White Blood Cells. De Stilj is just as good or better musically but partially deals with evil violent themes of the blues, and is too challenging; I'm a puppy, sorry. In 7 Nation Army, the White Stripes dialed towards the center a bit; maybe their handlers are getting to them. They should have gone more nuts, not less. But like I said, some of it is right up there in the rock god hall of fame.
B000002UY5|5.0|I have owned this cd for about 10 years and I still love it. It has great vocals, lyrics and melodies. But what makes this album is the awesome guitar work. From start to finish, no point on this album is more than a few seconds from awesome multiple guitar interplay. Guitar heads should own this album.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|I deeply appreciate Neil Young's music.  After all these years, Neil made another very respectable album.  It's garage-rock quality is very much unlike any other new music out today.  I can't see Neil making a big budget album and Greendale sounds like it was recorded at a bar.  If you haven't heard much Neil Young before, you probably won't like this album (buy Harvest and After the Gold Rush).  I've grown to love his music and out of all the ... new rock that is out and very much appreciate Greendale coming out.
B000089CJI|5.0|Good Synth Pop is hard to come these days.  Not so many people are interested in the style and old groups like Erasure and Depeche Mode are no churning the best material.  Newer American and European groups like Iris, Intuition and Sweep are just content imitating the 80's sound.  Then along comes The Postal Service.  This group has created a fresh Synth Pop style that appeals to older fans and new fans alike.  The sound is new but the songs have a retro feeling.  The album is consistent, even though some reviewers indicate that it only has 3 great songs.  That is incorrect.  This is a great album from top to bottom.  And I dare to say that is as good as anything Erasure has done in the past.  I hope they keep turning records in the future.  The real Synth Pop revival is here at last.
B00005JMC6|4.0|\\"Whale Rider\\" is certainly a different kind of film, both in its setting among the modern Maori of New Zealand and its emotional story of a young girl facing the prejudices of her traditional grandfather, an elder chief. Grandfather hopes his grandchild will be a boy to carry on the chiefdom, but is disappointed when the child is born a girl. Already disillusioned by his own sons who live a more relaxed modern existence, Grandfather sets out to find another worthy lad among the village youth (some of whom are troubled by absent parents and near-poverty.) Despite angry rebuffs, the granddaughter persists in attempting to assert herself as a candidate to carry on the town's ancient legacy. There is a haunting spiritual undertone to the actions of this brave girl; if all this sounds like a far cry from slick and frivolous Hollywood, it is. I think it would be a mistake to pigeonhole the film by calling it \\"charming\\" as many have done, because in actual fact it's not all that charming - this is a gritty film full of strong sorrows, painful conflicts, and awkward situations. Indeed, the burdensome tone of heavy sorrow which covers most of the middle part of the film seems unrelenting at times, and just when you think and pray that things are going to get better, they keep on getting worse. The human inspiration which we have come to find takes a long time to get there, but when it does at last, it is moving and memorable.
B00006690G|3.0|This cd is only good if you are white, not something else. but i guess its alright. some good songs are without me but cleaning out my closet has the best message in the song by far.
B00000099Y|5.0|This album is really some of the first of I had heard of Tool's, and now I am hooked to their dark and complex styles. Being a bassist myself, I immediately notice the complex bass riffs and learn to play them. This music is some of the most amazing out there right now and this well represents the talent this band has. There are some tracks that are only sound intros to the next track, but I think they were well placed. The songs range in the mood in many different ways, and overall this is one of my favorite albums.
B000000993|5.0|I have always thought of TOOL as one of the greatest bands ever since they discribe the world in a whole new way. From jocks to some world wide debates they always tell you how they think it should all be. I would recommend this cd to anyone who can appreciate great music.
B0000A02TZ|1.0|This disk forces you to sit and watch appoximately 5 minutes of promotional materials for a half dozen other Universal releases - each and every time you use it! The &quot;Menu&quot; key and others are disabled until the prom has run it's course.<br />Let's not encourage this trend - don't buy this disk and return it if you have. BTW, the picture and sound quality ARE a bit better than prior editions, which makes this more of a shame. The &quot;Special Materials&quot; are unimpressive. The movie itself, of course is one of the best.
B000003TAR|1.0|Everyone says Cobain's a genius. OK, Prove it. Where's the proof that he supposedly is of above average intelligence? Just because you wrongly believe he could do no wrong (wow! See? I can do a play on words like Kurt! I must be a genius too!) doesn't mean he's worthy of the god-like status his suicide catipulted him to. The In Utero production is horribly muddy, and yes, after rethinking it, Kurt chickened out at the last minute and called up Albini to try to fix it, but Albini couldn't re-engineer anything he engineer in the first place. The songs are OK, but the most pretentious thing is to try to be unpretentious, so I guess Nirvana is the most stuck up hick group in the west. Whatever. Nevermind.
0156027321|5.0|Piscine Molitor (&quot;Pi&quot;) Patel is the son of a South-Indian zookeeper. He is very much into religion, so much so that he decides to become a Christian, a Muslim AND a Hindu. His parents decide to move to Canada travelling by ship and taking most of their animals with them. When the ship all of a sudden sinks, Pi finds himself on a lifeboat with a zebra, an orang-utan, a hyena and a Bengal tiger: a kind of Noah's Ark in the middle of the Pacific. After less than a week only Pi and the tiger remain and they settle into an unleasy relationship to survive their 227-day ordeal. The adventures are numerous, some times hilaric, sometimes tragic.<br />An extremely well written book on a subject that could easily become either a tear-jerker or totally unbelievable, but Yann Martell finds exactly the right tone to make it (relatively) light-hearted, exciting with unexpected twists and turns despite the confined space of a lifeboat. The behaviour of both the animals and Pi are natural to the extreme, a joy to read. The first part of the book, which is mainly set in India, gives some very intersting observations on animal behaviour and on religion, the second part (at sea) reads like the adventure story it is and the third part (after rescue) puts everything in an unexpected perspective. I was also amazed by the fact that a Canadian writer writes an story book that reminded me of the stories written by great Indian writers like Salman Rushdie, Vikram Seth and Vikram Chandra. Truely a masterpiece.
B00006V9A0|1.0|Despite the fact Kurt Cobain says he was in full support off womens' rights, he sure was anything but the model advocate. For example, the song \\"Rape Me\\" slapped onto this Greatest Hits CD is supposedly anti-rape, but it's impossible to look at it in any light besides it being in support of rape. With lyrics like \\"Rape me again & again my friend\\", it can only be seen as support of the violation of women. Play the song for anyone, and I guarantee nobody would say it's against rape. No victim would ever find solace in a song so insensitive and demeaning. I don't care what Kurt Cobain meant by the song; I find it totally tasteless and humiliating to anyone how was unfortunate enough to go through a trauma like that. He totally trivializes rape by saying that he's \\"not the only one\\". I'm sure that's easy for him to say... since he's never been raped. And yet Cobain ended up playing an anti-rape benefit! What irony! If anything, it'd make the victims feel worse about themselves and feel contempt for Cobain. The rest of the songs are nothing offensive, though. There's nothing revolutionary, either. Or eye-opening. Or relevant. Or creative. For a band that supposedly sparked a \\"music revolution\\", Nirvana sure are devoid of anything meaningful, and compared to all bands I've ever heard on a respectable label, subpar on every level (Muddy Banks, anyone?). Cobain claims he was an artist, but artists take risks and break away from routine in their work. The only risk Cobain took was with himself and his family when he went on heroin binges. All Nirvana songs are repetive and go on for way longer than they should. After the obligatory solo, they repeat the chorus a few times or ad nauseum. As for the CD packaging, well, it's as cheap & run-of-the-mill as can be. It's rushed just like this CD. But I suggest you buy it just so I can watch you waste your money.
B00006LPER|5.0|this is a movie that makes critical contributions hard to express, albeit 233rdc's review does the job so well.<br />anyway, upon learning what ms. huppert had to say (in the extras) i was puzzled by her obliquely appropriating this work in the name of feminism--the director's opinion on this is sorely absent.<br />i consider this movie makes an artistic point about what takes place at the near-intersection of woman's pathology with mundane masculinity. the main characters, polarized with such charges, fiercely exhaust each other in a unique orbit (i.e. attraction &amp; repulsion.) they do so much onto each other yet there are the unintended consequences that they live and die by and not their prior projections.<br />it is also worth noticing how MUSIC catalyzes everything up to the point where the orbiting gets dangerous; then it stops. music is all they share, everything else is just a succession of opposite positions the characters take along identical dimenssions.<br />excellent acting, excellent directing, excellent story, good music!
B00004THAY|4.0|Clapton and BB's legends precede them and, independently, these two artists are phenomenal.  Both possess a powerful magic that drives a blues tune, and when one OR the other takes the lead, the song is epic.  However, when both try to share the lead as with the title track, they sound oddly shy and hesitant.  The laid back, cool style of this CD and the amazing blues riffs are sure to please you, but somehow, 1 + 1 only add up to 1.5 on this CD.
6302581907|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies.  It's hilarious and there's never any slow spots in the film.  Whoopi Goldberg does a fabulous job along with Maggie Smith and Kathy Najimy.<br />The musical numbers are classic, too.  The nuns turn Motown tunes into spiritual praise songs and gives a new interpretation to traditional Catholic hymns.  This is a MUST SEE!<br />I loved it and I know that you will too!  A perfect film for a date or even the family!
B00007LTIA|5.0|Finally after a couple of discraceful mastering and remastering jobs (the last in 1994 sounded arguably worse than the already appalling first edition) we have the definitive edition of this  masterpiece. The sound is significantly improved, the definition and clarity is all there at last, and there is very little tape noise. It sounds like it's been polished !<br />As if a perfectly restored edition wasn't enough, there are significant bonuses too, not least of which is a 2 minute `scene setting' introduction to `Dance Of The Dawn' excised from the original LP. With wave sounds and long Moog and guitar notes it<BR>makes the perfect precursor to the rather sudden intro fans of this piece will know so well.<br />A double CD, the first three pieces are on disc one, totalling 62 minutes. Disc Two begins with `Ritual', side four of the LP, and perhaps the best example of just how well this has been remastered. <br />For those who have loved these pieces for nigh on thirty years, there is then the first chance to hear sides one and three as works in progress, which is a bold move by the band to allow a window onto their world, and a fascinating listen. They are less `studio run throughs' as stated on the sleeve, as `early developments'. Dance of the Dawn has the final rhythm tracks but lacks the later overdubs and the vocals are 50% finished at best, you can hear Jon Anderson striving to knock this epic and complex music into shape, with sketchy lyrics and vocal utterances that are completely different to the final work. <br />Then there is a version of The Ancient that appears to take it a stage further back than the previous track, bearing no relation at all to the final version. It is even more fascinating, as it illustrates which ideas were dropped and which were developed.<BR>Both bonus tracks (totalling 40 minutes) are excellently recorded and are of immense interest. Not something to be played very often perhaps but great to hear the first time and nice to have.<br />To round it all off, the artwork is in the form of a slipcased digipak replete with booklet, and if ever any artwork deserved the digipak treatment it's the Roger Dean classic on offer here.<BR>Wholeheartedly recommended alongside the other new reissues (Close To The Edge/Relayer/Going For The One)

6300214826|5.0|Only when a work of art leaves room for ambiguity enabling subjective interpretation, can it really be personalized and only if the creativity of the artist allows you to subtly imbibe his fecund thought, do you get to feel comfortable with it genuinely. If it happens to be a movie, you'd call it a memorable success if you get to identify with one aspect of it. What do you call a movie if it enables you to identify with almost every aspect of it ? let it be the pace, stylization, narration, cinematography, soundtrack, screenplay or action, I think this movie would leave an indelible mark on every open minded viewer's psyche.<br />What can one say specifically about this one ? having seen and imbibed almost every subtle nuance of every character of this movie and closely observed every aspect of it for countless times, wish I culd give it a 5+ rating. <br />A very eerie coincidence was how accurately this movie models what I call &quot;grungy determinism&quot;. I guess I can identify with every action of Capt. Willard, and infact behave and think like him personally (even be4 seein this movie). I found the philosophical significance of the boat rowing towards the heart of darkness way beyond the petty battles between nations/ideologies that are represented in this movie. The way Willard had given up on redemption and presented a realistic and disaffected notion toward duty, is philosophically a mile above any of the major protagonists I've ever seen in modern cinema.<br />The soundtrack containing Jim Morrison's &quot;the end&quot; is soo apt and strikes a seemingly foreboding note with the climax. <br />I think life would've been absolutely barren w/out apocalypse now, pushkin's poetry and everclear jello shots ;)

B00003CXIP|5.0|Okay, I admit it. Like Rick Blaine in Casablanca, I am a \\"rank sentimentalist.\\"  As such, there are many movies that can bring me to tears: E.T., Summer of `42, Casablanca...no matter what era they were released or who directed them, there will always be movies that will jerk some heart-felt tears out of this mostly action-adventure film watcher.<br />Stand By Me, Rob Reiner's 1986 bittersweet coming of age story based on Stephen King's novella The Body, is definitely one of those movies that move me.<br />Starring Wil Wheaton (Star Trek: The Next Generation), River Phoenix (Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade), Corey Feldman (The Lost Boys), Jerry O'Connell (Sliders, Joe's Apartment) and Kiefer Sutherland (24), Stand By Me tells how a group of four boys goes into the woods in search of the body of train-struck Ray Brower, hoping to recover it before a gang led by Ace (Sutherland at his meanest, menacing best) does.<br />Reiner, working from a well-written screenplay by Raymond Gideon and Bruce A. Evans, excellently captures King's nostalgia-tinged story's mix of drama, comedy and even a bit of horror.  He coaxes very natural acting from his four main actors, particularly from Wheaton, Phoenix, and O'Connell.  Even Feldman, a child actor I really did not like in other films before his career flopped, is heartbreakingly poignant as Teddy Duchamp, the son of a mentally-ill World War II veteran.  Despite being scarred by his father's harsh punishments,  Teddy is proud of his father's wartime service.  One of the best scenes is his confrontation with the mean junkyard operator of Castle Rock, where Teddy's conflicting emotions of anger and love for his dad are summed up by his tearful yell of \\"My father stormed the beach at Normandy!\\"<br />The heart and soul of this movie comes from the friendship between Gordie Lachance (Wheaton), the sensitive would-be writer, and Chris Chambers (Phoenix), a bright kid who seems destined for disgrace because he comes from the wrong part of Castle Rock.  Chris projects a tough shell to hide his inner turmoil, while Gordie is having trouble coping with a family tragedy.<br />Reiner shines as a director capable of mixing moments of comedy (watch for a hilarious exchange revolving around the mystery surrounding Goofy's identity -- \\"Mickey's a mouse, Pluto is a dog...so what's Goofy?\\"), drama (an encounter with an approaching train), and a wickedly gross revenge story told by Gordie involving a very large boy and a pie-eating contest.<br />A particularly effective narration by Richard Dreyfuss (who plays the adult Gordon Lachance) adds just the right mix of wry humor and bittersweet nostalgia, and Jack Nitzsche's gentle and subtle score, with its interpolation of the classic rock 'n' roll song \\"Stand By Me\\" just heightens the poignancy of this affecting tale of boyhood friendship.art of Castle Rock.

B0000214F2|5.0|Robin Williams does antoher fantastic job.  With a blend of comedy and drama, he brings this TRUE STORY to life with integrity and dignity.  Not only does this film provide tons of laughs, it's very educational in that we learn more about the human spirit than we ever have.<br />It's definitely worth watching!
B000002UAU|5.0|Still the champ in many peoples minds all this time later,that must say something. A day in the life is still awe-inspiring after 1000 listens.
038572179X|2.0|The beginning and ending of the book were manipulative and mean.  In the end the decent people were trashed.  One might say this is reality.<br />The problem is that the beginning was a mass of artifice to create a &quot;realistic&quot; ending.  The hints of &quot;a crime&quot; and the intimations of disaster were drawn out page after page.<br />The middle of the book, telling of the retreat to Dunkirk and the description of Briony as a nurse in the hospital were the redeeming features of the novel.<br />The rest was aggravating and maybe a wee bit pretentious.
B0000A1RJI|4.0|You will find that from the moment you play this cd, you will be swept out of your computer chair and into the Disney harbor where Pirates was filmed. The music is uplifting and packed with that righteous sense of adventure that seizes you in the film. I only wish that they had made it longer...I found myself dancing for about 10 minutes and I look to see that I am on track 5! If you are expecting a soundtrack with long, long scores that encompass the entire movie this cd may not be for you.
B0000A4GAK|5.0|If you have seen Derek Trucks live after 1999-2000, when this album was recorded, you are already familiar with these tunes.  Derek Trucks is one of the few artists who lets his soul flow out of his instrument, and he does it on Soul Serenade with a sense of ease and a tinge of nastiness.  Gregg Allmann's vocals on track 3 are actually recorded separately from the band, but it is seamless and provides for a rockin' tune.  The band is tight in the studio, much tighter, in fact, than their first couple of efforts including Out of the Madness.  Every song on the album is most excellent and the sound quality is also rated high.  My only complaint: at about 40 minutes, this disc ends and I'm still ready for more.
0060977493|1.0|When a book wins the booker prize and sells for 11.20 on amazon.com, something is wrong. I had to read this book for my english class over the summer. It is undoubtedly the worst book I have read in my entire life. First of all, the ending is in the beginning of the book, which spoils the book immediately. There is a simile in every paragraph and Roy absolutely must use personification with everything and anything possible. In addition there is an incredible amount of unecessary detail, with very little relevant plot. Numerous times, I have read pages of detail about something very forgettable and insignificant (I don't remember what) only to think, where is this going, but never finding the answer. If the book was a quarter of the length, it would have been much better. As if that's not bad enough, the characters are horribly portrayed, and barely at that. And why is it necessary to confuse the reader by continually jumping around? After about 75 pages of the book jumping from character to character, time to time and place to place, I gave up trying to enjoy it, or understand why Roy was writing what she was. I simply concentrated on getting through it, which was similar to chinese water torture. Unless you enjoy constantly trying to figure out what is going on and love endless, irrelevant detail, avoid this book at all costs. <BR>P.S. Did all reviewers who gave this 4+ stars, including the critics get bribed to give this book a good review? That's the only reason I can think of them doing so...<BR>P.P.S If an English teacher (mine) read this book in grad school, then how can highschool students be expected to read this book?
B00008G9JM|2.0|I guess there is something to A Passion Play that I may be tone deaf to, but many Tull fans swear this is one fo the best.  I have always found this one overly pretentious and impenetrable.  Interesting in bits here and there, but for the ultimate Tull &quot;concept album&quot; go to Thick As A Brick.
B00008J4P5|5.0|Unlike 'The Stokes' 'The Vines' and 'The Hives' Jack and Meg White have staying power. 'Elephant' proves what critics were saying-this bands rocks. Recorded in England, &quot;Elephant&quot; sounds alot like &quot;Revolver&quot; (though way louder). Meg's drumming is solid, and Jack's guitar work is crunchy and great. The songs are very rock/blues styled, and all of them work. The single 'Seven Nation Army' and 'There's No Home For You Here' stand out, but any of these songs could be played on the radio and become a hit. Meg's singing debut 'In the Cold, Cold Night' adds yet another facet to this unique band.  As people, they seem messed up (one reason I've been weary of buying any of their music). But if you can look past the eccentric nature of The White Sripes as people and as a critical wonder-you'll discover great music and the continuation of more traditional rock.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|If you love hardcore, metalcore, 80's metal, or just straight ahead butt kicking music you will love Avenged Sevenfold's new CD! It is so perfect. It blends all their styles together and make one helluva good album. The mixing is much better than their last release, and there is a lot more singing also. I urge you to pick up this CD... because if you do not then you are surely missing out on one of the better CDs to come out this year.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|This movie is far better than most people give it credit for.
B00008PX8P|5.0|5 stars after 320 reviews?  That pretty much sums it up.  I never had a chance to see The Zep live so this CD gave me a glimpse into my past that somehow (regrettably) I missed.  When you watch the amazingly clear footage of these concerts from the 1970's you will clearly understand why this band is considered to be the best rock band ever, at least by serious music lovers.  These guys were incredible musicians on and off stage!  And, for you guitar lovers, if there was ever any doubt about who was the best rock guitarist ever, you will wonder no more.  I used to think it was JIMI.  It is now clear to me that it was really JIMMY!  I also have whole lot more respect for Robert Plant after seeing this DVD.  Damn, I miss the 70's!!!
B00005JMD3|2.0|It seems as though if I enjoyed any movie to come out in the past few years, I better be a fan of Colin Farrell.  Has anyone else noticed that he can't say no to a movie, even if it is a mindless action movie with little to offer in terms of plot.  SWAT is just an excuse to blow things up and shoot everybody. <BR> <BR>This movie is more predictable than 80's horror movies, but despite these major problems, Samuel L. Jackson and Colin Farrell manage to do a good job as members of SWAT.  I only hope Samuel L. Jackson begins to realize that the mindless action movies he is in are awful.  At least Vin Diesel didn't grace this movie with his presence.
B000009ED0|2.0|Kid Rock already had several records under his belt when he released \\"Devil Without a Cause,\\" his first big success. It features \\"Bawitdaba,\\" a rock radio favorite, and the HIDEOUSLY mainstream ballad, \\"Only God Knows Why.\\" It also includes the kinky and silly \\"Cowboy,\\" for which this record is probably best known.<br />The album is fine for those who like hardcore rap and rock. And you had better be able to tolerate a bit of profanity, because Kid Rock does plenty of it (only because he can, mind you). Most of the songs' beats and rhythms are repetitious and tiresome. He can be a little melodic, however, notably on the opening chorus of \\"I Am the Bullgod.\\"<br />When you slap it all together into one plastic disc, \\"Devil Without a Cause\\" is not much more than an hour or so of profanity, innuendo, and arrogance. This is fine, of course, for those who enjoy it, but for those who can't tolerate rap (especially white rap), it's not worth getting.
B00008DDSC|3.0|Secretary is a 3 1/2 star movie, unfortunatley Amazon doesn't allow one to be so picky and we must choose between 3 and 4 stars.  I enjoyed Secretary a lot while watching it, however I feel it never quite attains 4 star status, although to condemn it to the level of the 3's seems a trifle harsh.<br />The movie itself suffers from the same indecision.  It is unsure whether to be a campy play on an S&M relationship, or whether to be a serious Solondz-esque examination of the dark side of the suburbs.  In the end it fails to achieve either.  The plot of the movie has been adequately described by other reviewers, and one doesn't want to give too much away.  The movie itself can be split into 3 main sections, which i shall name after the key ideas - Degredation, Devotion and Disgust.<br />Degredation - The start of the movie revolves around degredation. The central character, Lee, is a self-abuser, freshly released from and institution.  In the minds of the writers, this means she needs a new pastime to stop her from cutting herself. The self bause here though is never shown on screen, making it hard for us to relate to the character - i think this is a cowardly move on behalf of the director. What happened, he didn't want to scare off the suburbanites?  Anyway, while the self abuse is pretty much left to our imagination, we are treated to a full rendition of the flowering relationship between her and her passive/aggressive boss.  Dr Grey is a lawyer with a particularily strong line in tough love, and we get to watch his transformation from a \\"Bottom\\" to a \\"Top\\", as he gets over the loss of his previous mistress and sets about enslaving Lee.  To enslave her me must first degrade her, and the most interesting scene in the first 1/3 of the movie occurs when he forces Lee to go dumpster-diving for a document he carelessly threw out.  The juxtaposition of her, in short skirt and high heels, climing into a dumpster and playing in the trash forces him to do some heavy exercise, presumably to punish himself both for the rising sexual urge and for degrading her in the first place.<br />The themes are expanded in the second third of the movie, which i refer to as Devotion.  Here the lines between their work relationship and master/slave relationship are played out in a series of interesting scenes (her red pen fetish, his all-consuming guilt), and then increasingly blurred as these worlds become inseparable.  All good things must come to an end though, and she has to go and spoil everything by falling in love with him. Chicks, eh? While his revulsion at his own acts causes him to push her away. Men, eh?  This is where the movie works best, exploring the self-destructive streak in all of us in our quest for love, using S&M merely as a metaphor for our own internally paradoxical desires to be in control of our world and hopelessly dependant on someone else.  You could get freudian here and delve into Eodipal undercurrants, but space forbits it here...<br />I said the end of the movie is characterized by Disgust. That was all mine. Having set up an interesting premise and painted detailed portraits of the human psyche, the film makers run out of ideas and suddenly try to bring the movie to an end as abruptly as possible.  I don't want to \\"spoil\\" the ending, but it steals from Kafka's \\"Hunger Arist\\" short story, Tom Robbins' \\"Still Life With Woodpecker\\" novel and Radiohead's \\"Just\\" video and in the end plays more like a Renee Zelwegger film, which is ultimately a shame, and reduces the movie to the three star level.<br />This is one of the sexiest movies i've seen all year - some of the scenes in the middle third are charged with erotic tension without resorting to nudity or even overt sexuality, however in the end (like the movie's best set pieces...) it is ultimately unsatisfying and one is left somewhat unfulfiled.<br />( As a sidenote, I wonder if genuine S&M afficinados find the premise that one must be disturbed or unhinged to enjoy S&M ill-educated or just insulting...)<br />A friend of mine saw this movie and walked out halfway though.  I recommend oy uwalk out 2/3 of the way though and leave it perfect in your mind....ted or just insulting...)<BR>A friend of mine saw this movie and walked out halfway though.

B000001Y42|1.0|I was introduced to Limp Bizkit by their second album, &quot;Significant Other.&quot; The band's debut, &quot;Three Dollar Bill Yall,&quot; seriously ticked me off when I bought it. Not only is the production lousy, but everything on the album is out of control and unstable.<br />Wes Borland is definitely a great guitarist, and this album is plenty enough evidence for that, but his heavy riffs and hooks don't mix well with anything. Fred Durst's lyrics are fast and unpredictable, and sometimes unintelligible; half the time you can't understand him. The album is NOTHING like the band's later efforts (&quot;Significant Other,&quot; &quot;Chocolate Starfish&quot;), and instead it seems to emulate all the other rap-metal acts that were scurrying around in the late 90's. The result: 60-some minutes of noise. The record's only big hit was the cover of George Michael's &quot;Faith&quot; ... and Fred Durst still managed to squeeze a &quot;Get the f*** up&quot; into it.
0064407667|5.0|If you like addicting dark series, this is for you.<br />What I like about these books are that the author gets you involved and leaves a lot of questions hanging, which are up to you to solve. It's very addictive, and once you read one, you can't stop. I can understand how some people don't like them, but it's called a Series of Unfortunate Events for a reason. A lot of adults think childrens minds are all happy and sugar-coated, but that's not really true. If you like happy endings, back away.<br />Although the books are all about misery, I am hoping that the actual series has a good ending. I guess only time will tell.
0738206679|4.0|Having read both &quot;Linked&quot; and &quot;A New Kind of Science&quot; I feel compelled to add my two cents to some other reviewer who unfavorably compares Barabasi to Wolfram.<br />While it is true that Linked is a bit light on the underlying math - not trivial by all means - and that there are chapters the book would be better without (last three notably, as well as the already-mentioned analysis of M$ dominance) this remains an interesting introduction to networks theory. We do not need rocket science to tell us that a scale-free network has its' vulnerability in its hubs, but I find it interesting and not entirely common sense that it is INHERENTLY more robust than a random network.<br />I find some of the critique here a bit petty (perhaps penned by fellow scientists ?). Barabasi comes out IMHO as a witted scientist with a knack for explaining stuff to the masses, an art in which Richard Feynman (alredy mentioned here and perhaps my all-time favorite hero) excelled. Perhaps a 100-page compendium would make a better reading, but there seems to be an unwritten publishing rule whereby no essay shorter than 250 pages sells.<br />On the other hand, I have rarely witnessed such an inflated ego as the one self-portrayed by Stephen Wolfram who bombastically claims to have invented a whole New Kind of Science ! His 1,200-page tome uses all variations of the &quot;I&quot; pronoun *ad nauseam* and there are whole sections who could be happily burned to no consequence to the reader (e.g. the proof-free wanderings on biochemistry et al.), not to mention the gazillion diagrams which cease to astonish well before you peruse the fiftieth.
0394524063|5.0|I read &quot;The Mists of Avalon&quot; about 10 years ago, sometime during my freshman or sophomore year in high school. I really didn't know very much about the whole Arthurian legend, but I was interested in Paganism at the time, so I decided to give it a try. Even after all this time, I'm still impressed by this book. However, I wasn't about to reread it in order to write this review, because, if I remember right, it took me a couple months to finish it, seeing as how it's nearly 900 pages. But I'll try to recap as best as I can, starting with a phrase that pretty much sums up a major theme in &quot;Mists&quot;: Behind every great man stands a great woman. Or, in this case, about four great women, all of whom are relatives of King Arthur's in some way: Morgan (his half-sister &amp; lover), Viviane (his aunt), Igraine (his mother), and Guinevere (his wife). Yet the story is primarily shown through the eyes of Morgan and Guinevere, two complete opposites of each other--Morgan being the yin (dark Pagan energy), while Guinevere is the yang (light Christian energy). Out of the two, Morgan was definitely my favorite; Guinevere was just utterly annoying. Separately, these two try to sway the power and balance in Avalon via King Arthur. If you're familiar with Arthurian myth, then I don't have to explain further; but if not, it couldn't hurt you to pick up a copy--that is, unless you drop this 2-pound epic on your toes. ;)<br />Almost 20 years after it was published, &quot;The Mists of Avalon&quot; was made into a movie in 2001, starring some of my favorite actresses (Anjelica Huston being one of them). I haven't seen it yet, but from what I've heard, I haven't missed much. Still, I'd  recommend it if you enjoyed the book (Hint: read the book first). I'd also recommend the other two Avalon books by Bradley: &quot;Lady of Avalon&quot; and &quot;The Forest House.&quot; You don't have to be an Arthurian/fantasy buff to enjoy this book, but you do need a great deal of patience to finish it.
B000001FS3|5.0|When I first heard &quot;Where the Streets have no Name&quot; I was absolutely floored.  This is the greatest song ever written and is just the beginning of the best CD ever.  Neither U2 nor any other band has ever or will ever record a better album.  Every song is a classic and every song ranks as one of the best ever.  Listen to Bono Screaming out the lyrics to &quot;I still haven't found what I'm looking for&quot; I have heard it thousands of times and never ceased to be amazed at this and the 11 classic songs on this greatest album that has ever been produced.
B000058T5E|5.0|As most of the reviews are positive on this one, I am not going to repeat the obvious, except to say that this is the most outstanding piece of work that Jeff has done since Wired.  While his early contemporaries have simply recycled their product (ala Page or Townshend) or have played it safe (like Clapton), Jeff keeps pushing the limits of sonic exploration and this album has to rank as one of his greatest works to date.  Everytime I listein to it I hear something different.  It's overall sound impact is downright &quot;rude&quot; and it may alienate some people whose admiration for the artist is still mired in The Yardbirds or his Truth days, but for my money this is cutting edge industrial buzz saw rock by a guitarist that only Hendrix surpassed.  Can't say enough ...
B00005LMWI|4.0|At this point, Kamelot has riched a level in quality of compositión that only could go up. The songs are pretty nice, and once again the balad ones are amazing, but this time I belive the best song it's &quot;forever&quot; a very melodic power song.<br />But the most interesting thing of the album is the high level of production that translates in a great sound and very interesting arrengments and ideas, thanks to the cooperation of Milo and Sasha Paeth (also Luca Turilli and Rhapsody producers).<br />Kamelot is since Siege Perilous - 1998 a very good metal band that has rich a very identificable sound and a standar level that would please any metal fan that likes certain level of technique and performance, but in this album (2001)the band still shows a grade of evolution making us think that the next will be also better than the previous ones. Highly recomended album.
B00005B1EX|5.0|I didn't even know that Halford had his own band now.  I have been out of the metal scene for a few years and my friend turned me on to this album saying &quot; I can listen to it over and over&quot;<br />I bought it ...listened to a few tracks and now over the past few months have become totally addicted..I listen to it more than anything else in my 300 + CD collection<br />simply awesome!!
B000062Y98|3.0|The correct rating in my opinion should be 3,5 stars but since thats not posible I rate it with 3. Is not that this is a bad album, but coming from Blind this is no one of their best, considering also the great success of Nightfall in the Middle Earth or Imaginations from the other side. This may be the reason why I was disapointed with it, even do it isn´t bad. There are some interestings tracks that need to be pointed: &quot;Precious Jerusalem&quot;, for example, a song with a lot of power and energy and very nice choruses, &quot;Under the Ice&quot;, &quot;sadly Sings Destiny&quot; very on the way of previous albums, &quot;the Soulforged&quot; also a very good work more alike with previous albums, maybe my favorite and finally &quot;And there was silence&quot; an interesting song of 14:05 minutes but very well structurated.<br />Another thing that made me rate this album with 3,5 was the fact that the art work is so poor that it is very disapointing for B.G. fans.
B000002AZ8|5.0|I am only writing one review, well more like a bash. This is for the kids who complain that all the PJ records don't resemble TEN...let me ask a question, if all the Metallica albums sounded like Kill em all, if all the Slayer records sounded like Hell Awaits, if all the Alice in Chains records sounded like Facelift, if all the Pantera albums sounded like Cowboys from Hell, would you buy them? It is a little thing called evolution, and for the most part I'll bet most of you still think the way you did when you were 6...wake up children, we all age, our tastes progress, and the artists are the same way. If you were a painter, would all your works look like the first..i doubt it, if you were a guitarist would all your riffs and solos sound the way they used to, most likely not,  and if they did, you would have a very small, backwoods group of fans. As for this record and all the PJ works I hear, it rocks, and the fact that they basically left mainstream makes me enjoy their work even more, ...

B000002BFZ|5.0|No Code, Ahhhh..I love it, so far different from TEN, and the fact that I don't hear it on the local radio all damn day is very refreshing, this is an album that doesn't need to be pounded into your head with a radio hammer.  The true fans of the Jam, will dig it for its artistic value..the &quot;Ten&quot; kids may not want to purchase it, or if you are stuck in your generation, you may also want to avoid it,  The Jam's taken a new road, and I like it!<BR>I give it 5 stars without hesitation, and local radio here only played one song....perfect :-) makes the other 12 that much better!!  True PJ fans already own it, some want it...buy it, if you dont like it, use it as a coaster and pop &quot;Ten&quot; back in your cd player.....
B000089RVX|5.0|Finally! A breathe of fresh air without selling out. This album gives the listener all of the things that make true rock the best type of music. It combines guitar, harmony, drums, grit, drama, emotion and substance with a hint of new wave to acheive the most complete album I've heard in a long time.<br />There is nothing better than a hard rock riff and a chick singing her guts out. This CD has that and more...<br />A must buy for the true rock enthusiast... If I could give it 6 stars, I would.
B0000508U6|5.0|What is it about Coldplay that's got us in it's grasp?  I am still not sure (and well into their 2nd album &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot;) but whatever it is...it works SO well.  Played on &quot;Alternative&quot; rock stations that feature much heavier, harder and dysfunctional band - they stand out as a simple, classic, beautiful band.<br />This album is fantastic - in no way common - more reminiscent of 1980's alternative.  Listen to it twice - you'll be hooked.
B000022TSH|3.0|First of all I am a fan of jacks films but there is a difference between a good story and a good movie.  This is a good story, and I have stayed interested through the whole thing twice and enjoyed it both times.  But there were aspects of the movie which left me a bit empty. This is a good movie for you if you A. are a Jack nicholson fan, or B. are a fan of private dick movies that are a little dry...no punn intended.<br />p.s youd have to see the movie to understand the unintended punn
B000069AUI|5.0|This is an exicting time in music isn't it?  Coldplay, White Stripes and Queens of the Stone Age give me hope in a world of Justin's, Britney's and Cristina's.<br />This album is wonderful - not so different than Parachutes but in no way repetitive.  &quot;Daylight&quot; (#6) blows me away....but the whole thing stirs deep emotions - the same way U2's &quot;October&quot; did years ago but without the politics.<br />Buy it - if you regret it then you just don;t get it!
B00005YU1O|2.0|I saw this movie once, and I never want to see it again.<BR>The creative forces behind the movie were trying to be original and freethinking with the movie's philosophy, but everything they talked about I had already heard, or have heard since in my high school philosphy/theology class. I didn't hear a single original idea, just a sloppy mish-mash of atheist existential morality, libertarian rage-against-the-system political rants, New-Age interpretation of mankind's future, and something about a collective universal consciousness. Add to that a dash of misinterpreted Christianity and dumb science (one character/orator is in denial about quantum physics) and you have the philosophy of Waking Life.<BR>As if that's not bad enough, the movie's preachy to boot. In lieu of a plot, Waking Life offers a series of disjointed monologues (of course those people sound convincing when no one challenges them!) and a bare-bones story about some guy (who's never named in the movie) who can't figure out if he's dreaming or waking, and can't seem to wake up. So the movie alternates between ramming pseudo-intellectual-existential-New-Age philosohical offal down your throat and mocking your attempts to make sense of its sorry lack of a plot.<BR>Yes, the rotoscopy animation was amazing, but not good enough to redeem the film. I wish Mystery Science Theater 3000, back in their glory days, could have time-traveled 100 years into our future, bought the rights to this film, and then taken it back with them to give it their special treatement. That would make Waking Life both more entertaining and more educational.<BR>In conclusion, if Waking Life is truly representative of independent cinema, I'd rather be a philistine.

B00005B36H|5.0|This album is by far TOOL's best piece of work, and it is, by far, my favorite album of all time.  They have matured as musicians and people and it shows in Lateralus.  The lyrics are quite mature and very well thought out.  Very deep, for the most part.  Musically, I have never heard anything like this.  The song composition and timings are extremely sophisticated.  I admire TOOL for putting out such an astounding album and doing it because they love the music rather than doing it for airplay.  Be warned; this is not a commercial album.  Give it some time to sink in!  Check this one out.  It's awesome!
B00009P1O0|5.0|I thought they'd never get this issued on CD. This album has one of my two favorite blues songs, the title track (Since I've Been Loving You by Led Zep is the other). I remember playing this album so many times in '74 with less than a clear head. Walk On is as good as any Neil Young rocker, and the other blues songs really express his dark and gloomy side. I needed this CD because my album was just about worn out! The wait was worth it. Don't pass this one up.
B000092ZYX|3.0|One CD full of \\"beeeeeeeeeep-hummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm-oooommmmmmm\\" is enough, don't you think?

B00005JLSE|5.0|This movie musical has all the right elements to make it a timeless treasure to be viewed over and over again.  It's a great tongue in cheek look at Gangsters, Crime, Jazz, and Liquor prohibition of the Roaring 20's and how America and our Justice System dealt with these \\"Evils\\".  <br />Every cast member gives 150% of talent, sweat and bravado - The entire movie is filled with high spirited and entertaining song and dance numbers.  There are no dull spots to muddle through between musical numbers, just witty dialogue to keep the plot moving.<br />This is a great film to have on DVD - a real treasure!<br />Two of my favorite musical numbers are The Cell Block Tango and the Ventriloquist Scene.<br />TWO THUMBS UP!!!
B00008X5J3|4.0|The 1920's in Chicago. The city is rife with illegal booze, jazz clubs, and corruption. Roxie (Renee Zellweger) is a chorus girl who dreams of being a star.  One day she shoots her lover in a rage at his betrayal. In prison she meets Velma (Catherine Zeta-Jones), who was Chicago's most celebrated showgirl until she shot and killed two people. Velma has retained the city's most successful defense lawyer, Billy Flynn (Richard Gere), who never fails to produce acquittals for women indicted for murder. Roxy also seeks Flynn's representation and quickly becomes his star client. The two women compete for headlines, trial dates, public sympathy, and all the stardom that their crimes can get them, desperately trying to stay one step ahead of each other and of the public's taste for the latest spilt blood.<br /><br />Director Rob Marshall and screenwriter Bill Condon have successfully adapted Bob Fosse's popular musical &#34;Chicago&#34; for the screen. The production is spectacular. The &#34;stagey&#34; musical numbers and more conventional dramatic scenes are well integrated. Dion Beebe's cinematography is creative and impressive. My only criticism of the film is that some of the more circus-like musical numbers struck me as overproduced and over-stimulating. Many modern stage musicals become ensnared in the trap of overproduction, which can do more to distance the viewers from the musical numbers than to draw the audience into them. Some of that seems to have carried over into &#34;Chicago&#34;'s movie version. But the performances are good. Renee Zellweger and Richard Gere cope admirably with the challenge of singing and dancing in a musical. Catherine Zeta-Jones gives a standout performance. She unabashedly plays her character over-the-top, belts out every song with great conviction, and really sells her performance. Another  impressive performance comes from Queen Latifah, who plays the women's prison warden, Mama. She also holds nothing back, and it doesn't hurt that she is a singer by profession. Catherine Zeta-Jones and Queen Latifah both have considerable stage experience, as well as being blessed with screen presence, which might explain their ability to bring great energy and a larger-than-life quality to this film version of a Broadway musical. If you're a fan of musicals, Chicago is a must-see. If you're not...well, musicals aren't everyone's cup of tea. But I think there is enough entertainment in &#34;Chicago&#34; to please most movie goers.inger by profession.

B000003TAR|5.0|This is the best ever Nirvana album because every song is absolutely amazing, and there's a great sound variety, from the grungy, heavy sound in &quot;Scentless Apprentice&quot; or &quot;Milk It&quot;, to the light, peaceful sound and lyrics in &quot;Dumb&quot; or &quot;All Appologies.&quot; I reccomend it to anyone who has already got other Nirvana albums like &quot;Nevermind&quot; or &quot;Nirvana&quot;, because this one is quite more complex and people who havent got a clear idea of how Nirvana is already might get a wrong impression. PS_ Kurt Cobain was assasined, he did not commit suicide.
B000003TA4|5.0|Wow. First of all I don't really know where to begin, since this album has absorbed itself into pop culture (perhaps reluctantly), and most people already own it. But I think this album is great not because it had hit songs, or that it sparked a grunge revolution at the time, but because it is a very powerful statement, and its raw depth is enormous. I got into Nirvana around 1998, which would have made me about 16 at the time. During this period, I had previously only listened to 70s arena metal bands such as Kiss and Deep Purple. But I remember one time I was sitting in my room, doing homework with the radio on, and \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" came on. I had heard of this song (and maybe heard it passing a few times in the past without thinking much of it), but, on this particular night, that song truly resonated with me for the first time (maybe it was because I was at the right age), and I vividly remember being unable to get that catchy chorus out of my head. I went out and got the album, and, for the following month (maybe two), Nevermind was all I listened to. I got into alternative music largely thanks to this album, and I owe Nirvana a lot for that.<br /> The opening track is, of course, the infamous \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\\" which moves along with that now-immediately familiar guitar riff and indecipherable lyrics. \\"Come As You Are\\" and \\"Lithium\\" also received air time, the former with its \\"flangy\\" sounding guitar solo (which sounds like it was recorded underwater, this as well as the video for the song tie in with the \\"water\\" theme on the album cover). Other noteworthy songs include \\"Drain You,\\" \\"In Bloom,\\" the raw punk rockers \\"Breed\\" and \\"Territorial Pissings,\\" the acoustic tracks \\"Polly\\" and \\"Something in the Way,\\" and the perennial pop nugget \\"On a Plain.\\" The only complaint I have (and this is very minor) is that the production is WAY too slick and clean for this kind of album. However, the album still seems really lo-fi in comparison to a lot of thestuff that followed it. Kurt Cobain's excellent songwriting abilities are evident throughout the album, and the exciting rhythms produced by Krist Novoselic and Dave Grohl really push the music to a higher level.  <br />I have to admit that I'm slightly more partial to this album than the others simply because it was right there with me for so long during high school. Every song resonated with me, and being a loner like Kurt, I could definitely understand where he was coming from at times. Even four years after he died, I still believed in Nirvana. I still listen to this frequently because it means something to me. <br />Over the past couple of years, this album has really been overanalyzed by a lot of people, and I think that's missing the point. When you listen to Nevermind, you don't think or be analytical...you just feel the depth and emotion. To me that says more than anything. If you are a teenager who is searching for some music that actually has worth, I cannot recommend this album enough.

B00000AFGM|4.0|This new Era Manson got into was very strange apart from the Antichrist era. This album &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot; is an awsome new start. It's not as good as Antichrist , but it has a more electronic sound to it .I was dissapointed that the former guitarist Zim Zum had left . Zim is awsome on this album , John5 only did this album live . Besides John5 is just stupid.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|Everytime when Neil Young gives the World a new album, you wonder what's this time Neil up to to. This time he gives us a wonderful album, sometimes a little bluesy, sometimes a little country but always in a good form. Maybe you have to hear it more than once before you can enjoy it, but i did it immediately. He also gives he opinion about the politics nowadays, what only a few dare today. Neil has to go on you will hear that not only the younger musicians can make good albums, but Neil does it also at a age that most musicians are taking their rest or make albums with the older songs, they did so many years ago and make money one more time.
B000002UAR|5.0|I will start right off saying there are two songs on here-GOOD DAY SUNSHINE and YELLOW SUBMARINE-that, along with WHEN I'M SIXTY-FOUR, are very, very bad songs by Mr. Paul McCartney.   However, he makes up for it with the beautiful ELEANOR RIGBY, the slightly less beautiful but still nice HERE, THERE, AND EVERYWHERE, and his two standout songs here, FOR NO ONE and GOT TO GET YOU INTO MY LIFE.<br />George Harrison also shines on this record.   Both TAXMAN and LOVE YOU TO are absolutely awesome songs.   Skip I WANT TO TELL YOU, however.   It's not horrible, but it's not great either.<br />The cream of this album, however, belongs to Lennon.   The amazing guitar riffs from SHE SAID SHE SAID and AND YOUR BIRD CAN SING are amazing.   DOCTOR ROBERT is a really fun song.   I'M ONLY SLEEPING is an amazing effort with the backward solo and just very catchy and drowsy, both at once.   And, of course, the album's closer, TOMORROW NEVER KNOWS, the greatest expression of an acid trip ever recorded in song or story.<br />All in all, an absolutely brilliant album that far outshines RUBBER SOUL and SGT. PEPPER, and is on par with the WHITE ALBUM.   Get it, or I will sit on your head.
B00005JKZV|5.0|I loved the Two Towers!  I loved the plot, the story and the action.  It was all so good!
0767805712|5.0|Word on the streets is that this movie's premis is how things would be if Hitler had won WWII. It's a story about a future society where only the most physically capable are able to do certain things. I won't spoil it all for you. It's a slow movie, but I liked it. I thought it was really good. None of my friends like it. I think it's a movie to sit there and watch alone the first time.
0385720920|3.0|The first sentence of Choke is a warning about what lies ahead.  <BR>\\"If you're going to read this, don't bother.  After a couple of pages you won't want to be here. So forget it. Go away.  Get out while you're still in one piece.  Save yourself.\\"<BR>Palahniuk wasn't kidding.  I had a real hard time trying to get through this book which reads more like a lot of snippets of Chuck's wonderful writing, wit, and insight than a well-thought-out, integrated whole.<BR>Many of the individual scenes and dialogues are fun and entertaining, seemingly absurd but at the same time insightful and thought-provoking.  That is what I love about Palahniuk's writing and why I struggled to get through this one to the end.<BR>It's not on the same par as Fight Club or Survivor as a story, however, which is unfortunate, given the power of many of the individual scenes.<BR>Juxtaposing Colonial Dunsboro (Colonial Williamsburg?)against contemporary standards and values is a very effective way to ponder what really changes over time and what stays the same.<BR>The sex is more graphic in this book than the other Palahniuk novels that I've read.  Victor Mancini is a sex-addict and his dawg gets a real workout.
B00008NRI9|5.0|I loved this movie. Being a romantic comedy, the ending is fairly predictable - but you don't watch this type of film for any great surprises. Hugh Grant & Sandra Bullock have great on-screen chemistry, and the dialogue is very witty in places. I won't go into all the plot details - if you haven't seen it, you should, and if you have, you already know what happens - but for me the best part of the movie was the depiction of the relationship between George (Grant's character) and Lucy (Bullock's character). Yeah, they argue, disagree, drive each other crazy, etc, but there are a number of cute scenes showing just how much they've come to mean to each other while working together. For example, watch out for the scene where they're having lunch and, without even pausing in their conversation or seeming to notice what they're doing, take food off each other's plates.<br />Overall, great fun, heart-warming, and charming. I'd love to see Sandra and Hugh working together again.
B00004S3AN|5.0|Time Out, an album recorded over forty years ago still lies in the top 100 albums sold in Amazon (the regular, not the SACD version). If that doesn't speak for itself, then consider these facts: it was the first successful attempt by white musicians to play jazz, creating a genre that later became known as West Coast Jazz. The album, as laid back as it sounds (not surprising considering where the musicians were from), contains some true musical jewels where Brubeck and his quartet experimented with \\"odd\\" time signatures, such as 5/4 (the classic \\"Take Five\\") and 9/8 (the opening track, inspired by a visit he paid to Turkey). All in all, it ages superbly well: give it a listen, and unless you are in a rush, you will enjoy it. It is great music now as in the sixties: \\"Time Out\\" without a doubt is timeless.
B000002UAO|5.0|What a great album.  One of the nicest things about it is that I can just leave it in my cd player and listen to it over and over again on loop.

B000002UAI|5.0|The conventional wisdom insists that, at best, \\"Beatles for Sale\\" is a step back.  I maintain this is only the case if you're grading the album in terms of original material or the inclusion of \\"Mr. Moonlight\\".  But hey - big deal.  The covers are excellent, often funky and interesting, interpretations renditions of classic songs (with the exception of \\"Mr. Moonlight\\"); if you've got this album you may not feel you have to own the original Chuck Berry version of \\"Rock and Roll Music\\" or the original Buddy Holly version of \\"Words of Love\\".  If you enjoy the Beatles cover of a song, then you're enjoying the album.  Sure, it's the original material on an album that signifies the artist's contribution, but some fresh insight on a standard is valuable too.<br />Let's turn to the original material.  I would venture that \\"No Reply\\", \\"I'm a Loser\\", \\"I Don't Want to Spoil the Party\\", and \\"Baby's in Black\\" are four of John's best.  In my opinion, each one is better than anything he contributed to the White Album (OK, maybe \\"Dear Prudence\\" is as good).  Paul's contributions are also up to snuff - he shouldn't be ashamed of anything he's done on this album.  George's rockin' cover of \\"Everybody's Trying To Be My Baby\\" makes me hit the repeat button almost every time I hear it -- and that's a mark of excellence for me.<br />The Beatles and George Martin do some light experimenting with texture, structure, and tone on this album, but it's subtle and sadly overshadowed by the extensive improvising they did later.  Don't let the crowd or even your own comparisons to other Beatles albums stop you from evaluating this one on its own strength.  Highly recommended.
B000056JYB|5.0|I got into Blind Faith mainly because I was a Cream fan first. If you like them, chances are you will like Blind Faith, although I can't guarantee it. As this was Clapton's first band after Cream disbanded, the vibe of the album is similar. Blind Faith is almost like a more acoustic version of Cream. The vibe of 60's British blues is there, yet the amped-up electric distortion and fuzz of Cream is absent. Instead, Steve Winwood (from Traffic) shows up to provide some of his quirky style to the music. So Traffic fans might enjoy the album as well. Just don't go looking for other Blind Faith albums after this. This was both their debut and swan song, making Blind Faith better remembered as an interesting experiment between Clapton and Winwood than an actual band. Clapton would move on Derek and the Dominoes and Winwood would go back to Traffic. Oh well. If you ever want to hear what Cream and Traffic sound like in combination or marriage, pick up &quot;Blind Faith.&quot;
B00008J4P5|2.0|These two pale-faced slugs continue to fake out the world of rock and roll by posing as a singer/drummer combo.  Truth be told, there's no way in heck these lazy sods could churn out the unfiltered noise they do without lots of help.  What they don't tell you is that Jack and Kate White (otherwise known as Jack and Kate Ryan) have a bassist and keyboardist with them at all times in the studio and in concert.  Plus, Kate White doesn't play her own drums, due to the fact that she can barely play.  Jack White lip syncs in concert, and rumor has it this weird combo used to play metal ballads at weddings in New Jersey, where they floundered severely and almost called it quits.  They were discovered, though, by some alterna-dude who thought he could mold them into a band like the Black Keys.  Next thing you know, these two posers called themselves White Stripes and turned \\"alternative,\\" and everybody's feeding off them now as if they were Bon Jovi in the '80s.  Every rumor you've heard about this duo is true, but there's also a lot you don't get to hear about them.   <br />Steer clear from this wreckage of an album.  I heard it a few times at a high-profile book store that specializes in alternative music and was highly turned off by the repetative drudgery of its sound.<br />GOOD DAY!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000000WZ4|5.0|It's probebly true, Depeche Mode has reached the end.<BR>Starge thing about DM albums, it takes about a year to realize the true beuty of a certain album, but this one is different, from the moment I pressed the PLAY button I felt something strange. I wasen't sure what was that feeling until the second track started playing ... In that moment I forgot about myself and flew inside the music. The funny part is that the more Rock songs here are the less good. The quite ones are beutiful, wherever you'r a DM fan or never heard of them this album is a must have.<br />It's probebly true, Depeche Mode has reached the end.<BR>We both aggree that there were strange times (the early days with that wierd dance music) and sttange times (EXITER) but this album is just to beutiful to pass on.<br />But there are better words to descire this amazing album ... those aren't my words... It's their<br />&quot;This is an insight<BR>Into my life<BR>This is a strange flight<BR>I'm taking<BR>My true will<BR>Carries me along<br />This is a soul dance<BR>Embracing me<BR>This is the first chance<BR>To put things right&quot;
B00005MP58|5.0|An incredible, beautifully done story of Austen's classic. True to every historical detail and the actors and actresses walked through time.  Jennifer Ehle is exceptional. With her classic beauty and supreme acting (tell me the truth now, this woman was born in the 18th century, right?) she transports you back in time.  I am a adult who, though I love history, am not given to hiding in romantic novels, but I have watched this movie about 6 or 7 times.  When I need an escape, I go spend the day with &quot;Jane and Lizzy&quot;. Any man or woman who appreciates history will also enjoy this film for it's detail to just that.
0441009425|5.0|It seems that in the last decade space opera has acquired many new important authors. <BR>The problem with most of them is that they feel they have to rely on metaphysics to create a problem that the entire galaxy has to be involved (You don't create a space opera over some petty theft!).<BR>But no. Not Reynolds. He create a problem (Did I say ONE problem?)  of galactic proportions. He does not rely on love (Simmons-Hyperion), or evil (Hamilton-Reality Dysfunction) or whatever metaphysical instrument. <BR>He keeps his science straight. It is a full featured science fiction work describing a word that could be. I can easily see how human beings went from here-today to there-then.<BR>I read the first part of the book a little faster than I should because I did not realize his style. When reading you have to keep in your mind all the data he gives. They (problems you did not really realize they where problems) are coming back later when you least expect it to get resolved (a small spoiler: so the father was not lost, he was sold but he does not seem to mind).
6302800897|5.0|One of James Stewart's greatest roles and movies, Otto Preminger's Anatomy Of A Murder, has him as Paul Biegler, former public prosecutor who spends most of his time fishing.  That is, until his boozing partner Parnell McCarthy tells him about the Manning incident.  A certain Lieutenant Frank Manning shot the owner of a bar, Barney Quill, five times after learning that the latter raped his wife.  That's quite a change in fortunes, according to his secretary Mayda, who tells him, \\"What appointments?  People will think you have migrated into the woods.\\"<br />Biegler has a rough one.  There are four options to get Manning off the hook:  1) Quill committed suicide, 2) Manning didn't do it, 3) he was legally justified, and 4) it was an excusable killing.  Biegler can't use #3 because of the time element--Manning killed Quill an hour later, which makes it premeditated murder.<br />Then there's Laura, Manning's luscious wife, described by Mayda as \\"soft, easy, the kind of woman men like to take advantage of, and do.\\" one of those women men like to show off, but may get jealous if too much attention is paid to her.  Laura sticks by her husband all the same.<br />The courtroom scenes become impassioned with the usual objections called by both sides, to the point that the weary but overly patient judge tells a smart-aleck witness, \\"Just answer the question.  The attorneys will provide the wisecracks.\\"  The best one comes from Biegler at the expense of an expert witness there to observe.  \\"Is he here to observe the constellation of Taurus or the life and times of a bumblebee?\\"  At least it gets a laugh in the courtroom.<br />Apart from Stewart, Arthur O'Connell, best known as the older cowboy in Bus Stop, does wonders as Parnell.  Lee Remick turns in a sexy but assertive performance as Laura.  This was also one of George C. Scott's early roles.  He is Claude Dancer, assistant attorney general from Lansing, assisting the prosecution.<br />This movie gained controversy for the then-considered graphic description of the assault in the courtroom, but also when Laura tells Biegler that Quill \\"tore my panties off.\\"  In fact the Hays Code denied the picture a censors certificate, but the Supreme Court wisely permitted the release of the film in 1959.<br />Duke Ellington's mellowed music serves as a cooling off after the heated court sessions.  Duke himself appears as Pie Eye, piano-playing leader of a band, and he and Stewart share a few bars together.<br />Eve Arden's tart lines are in plenty supply:  \\"If this refrigerator gets any more fish, it'll swim upstream and spawn all by itself.\\"<br />Parnell has a great reflective soliloquy on the justice system while Paul plays the piano.  \\"Twelve different minds, twelve different hearts, twelve different walks of life, twelve sets of eyes, ears, shapes and sizes, are asked to judge another human being as different as they are from one each other.  In their judgment, they must become of one mind, unanimous.  It must be one of the miracles of man's disorganized minds that they can do it.\\"  Biegler's attempts to do that is what this movie is about.hen-considered graphic description of the assault in the courtroom, but also when Laura tells Biegler that Quill \\"tore my panties off.\\"  In fact the Hays Code denied the picture a censors certificate, but the Supreme Court wisely permitted the release of the film in 1959.<br />Duke Ellington's mellowed music serves as a cooling off after the heated court sessions.

1558908382|5.0|A complete laugh out loud flick about hit man (Cusack) who goes back home to Grosse Pointe to his ten year high school reunion.....Very very funny....And Minnie Driver is so hilarious and so likable in this movie...I think she did a great job!
B000002H8F|5.0|Yes, I agree .. Doolittle is probably better, but wow this album still knocks you off your chair when you first hear it. I LOVE the raw and screamy sounds of Roch Music and the eery sounds of the Rosswell song 'The Happening'. It's great the scream along with Hang Wire and then finaly cool down with Stormy Weather. But the best song has to be Dig for Fire. Simple, strong and soooooo beautiful !! I love it ! Second best is All over the World; so quiet in the verses but when the chorus starts it's like a bomb exploding ! You can see that I'm quite happy with this album; and so will you be ! It's a must .. For everyone !
B0000AMRJD|5.0|Watch this right after Gandhi and you'll have one of the most mind-altering double features you can get. Pacifism followed by utter mind [altering] chaos!<BR>Incredible film making. I saw it on commercial TV awhile ago and with the language and carnage cut out, fit into 2 hours with the ads!<BR>Not for those offended by language, guns, drugs and [physcial activity].<BR>You will enjoy it, I assure you.
B0000019PA|5.0|best cd purchase ive ever made.  its always in my cd player and everyone can agree to listen to it in the car and whathaveyou.  you can laugh to it, sing to it, dance to it, cry to it.  very multi-faceted.  close your eyes and pretend your robin of loxley in the forest.  they go well together.  buy this cd - i promise youll be hooked.
B00009V7PJ|5.0|I bought this along with the cd and I can't stop playing this DVD. The packaging, songs, dancing, her entrance, the audience, her monologues, and everything else makes this the best concert dvd!  You're definitely getting your money's worth with this!  Her costume changes reflect her many different moods throughout the show and you feel it right along with her! She's at her sexiest (to me) with her disco dress oufit for \\"Take Me Home\\".  I'm at a loss for words...other than my subject line...she, the dancers, band and everyone else involved gives it their best and it shows right through.
B00005JM1F|4.0|I bought this movie because the previews looked really funny.  When I watched it, I was a little disappointed.  The movie is funny, but it didn't live up to all the hype that was made about it.<br />My favorite part is the cinder block scene! :c)
B000002OZY|5.0|This deserves 100 stars this album is right up there with Pink Floyd's The Wall but albums like this can't even be called albums they are an EXPERIENCE that everyone must listen to.  This also has the rights to being the very first rock opera.  Anyone who gives this less than 5 stars is out of their mind because there is NOTHING wrong with this musical &quot;experience&quot; sure the who's earlier things were good but this brought them, in my mind, to be one of the best bands of all time.  No matter what kinda music u like u should buy this because it is perfect I don't care if u listen to 50 cent and j. lo u still NEED to listen to this anyone who doesn't listen to this is being deprived.  So incase I haven't made this message clear STOP READING THIS REVIEW AND BUY THIS ALBUM!!!
B00003CXXP|5.0|A.I. is one of my all time favorite movies. The cast is brilliant under Spielberg's direction. The futuristic yet familiar sets are stunning and true. And nobody gets aliens down quite like Spielberg. It helps that Pinocchio is my favorite childhood story, and it is beautifully replicated here in gorgeous dialogue and theme.
B000006TRV|5.0|why are u reading reviews? u don't need convincing this album is one of the best things I have ever experienced. If I didn't own this album I would refuse to live.  What else are u gonna do with 25 bux that is more worth it than this?  The Only thing that could come near the brilliance of this album is the who's tommy.  BUY THIS NOW!
B00005AQE8|5.0|This Is The Best CD Ever From The Best Artist Ever. Enough Said!
B00008BXJG|5.0|I was noy very interested when I first heard that a new record label was going to reissue the AC/DC Catalog. I said to myself that this would be another &quot;REMASTERED&quot; album with nothing much added. <br />I was quite surprised and impresed with this reissue work. Each CD is filled with pictures relevant to the time the album was recorded. The sound is quite good. Therefore, It provides an enjoyable experience. <br />Highway to Hell was the results of years of dedication. The band developed their style on years of touring and recording. In this occasion the band made match with a new producer (Robert Lange) that provided a new perspective and enhanced the sound making the collection of songs on this album truly memorable. This is a masterpiece of blues infected hard rock. The title track only is a rock and roll gem for ages  to come.<br />It had to be an intense time for the band as it was followed by the dramatic death of their lead singer. Few times in rock hitory a record name has been more representative of the people who mad it!!
B00005AQE8|5.0|This Is The Best CD Ever From The Best Artist Ever. Enough Said!
B000005RR0|5.0|Well this is as the CD states on the cover a collection of hits from the 70's to the early 90's. The Stones are too much of a legendary band but this does not means that they did not have their weak moments. Like it or not this period had as many great moments as it did some weird experimentation that did not always end it up sounding great. Nevertheless, this set represents quite well what the band was during those 20+ years. <br />As I stated, the RS are a legendary Band. They have already made history with their music and this CD is only a small portion of their legacy
B0000AXE8I|5.0|I loved this movie...I saw it twice and the second time IMAX...wow ....can't wait for the third...
B00006RU5B|4.0|I must confess that I was a bit concern that this &quot;new&quot; band would be just a bunch of filler songs in order to make a lot of marketing and promotion on the fact that is made up of already know rock stars.<br />I am glad I was wrong as the whole CD is filled with great tunes that, in my opinion, define a new bread of hard rock sound. I read in a Guitar World interview a long time ago that the band wanted to recreate a Classic Rock vibe. I think that this task has been achieved very well both in terms of sound and lyrics.<br />Every band member plays their instrument in a perfect blend of riffs and melody giving the recordings great strenght and depth. As for Chris Cornell his voice is perfect for this new sound. <br />I just hope that this band has a chance to record some more music as the results seem to be quite sincere and spontaneous.
B00005JLEU|4.0|The filn starts slowly... typically the father and mother are annoying from the first scene and remain that way. Dont let this stop you. Chihiro is a guiding light and keeps you stuck to the screen no matter how utterly sweet and innocent the animated character might be. <BR>Set in a world that only japanese anime could provide, the movie engulfs your imagination. Its one of the first family style animated movies ive watched and it left me dumfounded with its timely heart felt approach and its sincerity. Never once did i think that chihiro thought twice about the trust she gave people. its not manufactured which is a very rare sight these days and one you expect least from an animated feature. <BR>All i can say is watch this movie for yourself. it will touch you, if it doesnt then you are beyond help and fair game for anyone to take a swing at. it is worth the time.

Each CD is filled with pictures relevant to the time the album was recorded. The sound is quite good. Therefore, It provides an enjoyable experience. <br />As for High Voltage, the CD was the first US realease for the band and it was as raw as a band could get in those days. It was a bold statement for a rock band. AC/DC are not virtusos but what they lack on playmanship they make it up on intensity, performance and dedication. This set was just a blue print that belive it or not did evolved with each new record the band made.<br />The basis for the AC/DC sound is here in this album... is the starting point on one of the must sincere recording and performance careers on rock and roll.
B00005U18E|3.0|I saw the movie.<br />It was just ok.<br />The plot was silly.  It was as if they had the actors and tried to make the story line around them.
B00008PX8P|5.0|The most important part of this DVD is that it pictures the band in top form during different performance since 1970 to 1979. It is not just one great concert but a true document on how Led Zeppelin evolved as a band throught the years. <br />It is really interesting to see how they manage to start as an experimental blues band and , at the end, they became a more elaborated concept band. The changes are evident as the band members change from boys to &quot;rock stars&quot;. I mean, you can see the changes in their attitudes, the way they approach their instruments and the music.<br />The DVD also gives you enough material to fully appreciate each members contribution to the Led Zeppelin sound. Specially, John Paul-Jones shines as a bass player who, along with Bonzo on drums, gave Page and Plant a solid fundation for their guitar and vocal performance. <br />The selections cover all basic aspects of Led Zeppelin's sound: Blues, Rock, Acoustic. Lights and Shadows at their best... Most interesting are the bonus material in DVD 1, specilly a performace for radio program tha shows the band in a really intimate and confortable setting playing with such intensity that this performance alone in worth the investment.<br />For guitar fanatics, this set of performance are a complete guitar course on Led Zeppeilin as one has a real chance to see Page play many of the bands best riffs. Also, Page that has always been identify to the Gibson Les Paul, as this was his main guitar in the previous live set &quot;The Songs Remains the Same&quot;, plays a Fender Telecaster, a Danelectro and a Fender Stratocaster in many of the tunes giving the guitar fanatic new perspective on his playing.<br />Overall, more than a simple rock concert this is a document and a tribute of a great period and band in rock history.... It was long overdue.
0131103628|4.0|Yes, this is the classic text on C, but in 2003, there are better books.<br />If you want to know what went on in the designers mind in the creation of C, get this book.<br />If you need a tutorial about C, there are better choices.
B00008LOS1|5.0|Who's Next is as much a Classic Album as is a mysterious one. Is hard to belive that this collection of songs are just the seeds of a much ambitious project that could not be completed. Just about every song on this album is a classic and just to think that the initial idea was more elaborated is mind blowing.<br />As for this package it follows the same structure as other remastered releases. This is, it gives you bonus materials, a great booklet (with notes from the band and others), live performances, etc. Is this a better edition? I just think that is more interesting as it provides further information and other musical perspective (live performances and demos) on already known songs.<br />This is a set for fanatics, record collectors or people interested on learning more about this legendary album.
B000007OY0|5.0|This really was a great movie.<br />Great and believable plot. Excellent acting.<br />One of the best of the past 10 years.<br />I loved this movie!
B00000DFSK|3.0|This is just a badly put together collection that offers little in the way of anything new except for a 'new' song &quot;Sweetest Thing&quot; which I find to be relatively dull in comparison to much of U2's other work. The shortening of many of the songs ruins them completely and there is room for at least four more full-length songs. This collection is great musically but they really squandered their chance of making an excellent collection. The B-Sides edition though is much better but they should've released those B-Sides on a separate album! Don't waste your money on this useless collection. Get their albums instead
0671027344|5.0|This book is simply amazing.  It is a must read for every teenager in high school or preparing to go into it.  Its a book that you will not want to put down and you will laugh and cry along with Charlie.  A lot of the situations Charlie is in are directly related to what every person goes through at least once in their life.  I was never really a big reader but once I read this book I wanted to find every book out there that is like it.  It is a must-read!

0767805712|5.0|A sci-fi bomb when released in 1997, \\"Gattaca\\" will live on as a masterpiece.  You can't help but feel sympathy for \\"Godchild\\" Vincent.  The \\"deGENErate\\" is masking his true identity in a sterile world of perfectly produced test tube co-workers.  Andrew Niccol's vision of quiet chaos is superb.  The sets are filmed crisp and cool.  The effects of Man vs. Nature are revealed at a suspenseful pace.  Hawke, Thurman and especially Jude Law, couldn't ask for a better script.  Not to be missed !

B0000AI44Q|5.0|I was very eager to hear this CD when I first heard of the concept behind it (and after the dissapointing &quot;Are You Passionate&quot;).<BR>  All I can say is -- Neil delivers. This album is a LOT more than I thought it would, not the concept of it, but the lyrics and songwriting. It seems Neil actually TRIED this time. You can tell when you've got a good CD when the first song gets stuck in your head after only ONE listen. <BR>  I wish more &quot;older&quot; singers/bands would put their heart into their music, unlike Aerosmith, The Rolling Stones and that godawful band KISS, who are all doing NOTHING but making money. <BR>  At the old age of 57, Neil still plays from his heart, when he wants. I'm curious as to what the future holds...
B00005JMCR|3.0|Well , its finally here - the third installment in the American Pie series. In my opinion this is the best one by far as it as all the elements of a comedy. Even though half the cast is missing (for reasons best know to them), the rest of the gang Jim, Finch, Stifler,Michelle (Bang Camp fame)including the one and only Eugene Levy (Jim's Dad)who always seems to catching his son \\"off guard\\". <br />The movie starts off with a very unusual Wedding Proposal scene between Jim and Michelle which ends up into a fiasco... thanks to the Jim's Dad which leads to the planning of the American Wedding - ofcourse not to forget when u have a wedding ur friends want the best for you and if you have friends like Finch and Stifler - God save you. These two in a quest for Cladence (Michelles's sister) turn the movie inside out to see who can win her love. Amercian wedding has some hilarious scenes of Stifler dancing to all time classics in Bar !!! Eating Poo , Doing Jims' Grandmother !!! and a Bachelor Party seriously gone wrong. <br />I thought this was a great movie and a must see for all American Pie fans...
B00005JM02|5.0|Pixar has created a masterpiece that should receive a Best Picture nod.  Of course, we know that it won't happen.  When children and adults can come together for 90 minutes and everyone is entertained, then you have a successful movie.  Entertaining, educational, creative and visually stunning.  I saw it three times in the theater, and cannot wait for November 4th!!<br />Great movie!

0553381407|5.0|If you are a child of a toxic parent you will find Susan Forward's book both validating and empowering. Forward says that healing is most effective when you proceed down the double track of changing self-defeating behaviors and disconnecting from traumas from the past.<br />The goal of the book is to reverse the balance of power in your relationship with your toxic parents.<br />Forward says all parents are deficient at times but Toxic Parents have consistently harmful effects. Focusing on their own problems Toxic Parents expect kids to take care of them, turning their children into mini-adults. Unable to control their own deep-seated rage, they blame their children. They control their children via guilt and manipulation. They are extraordinarily insensitive to both the pain they inflict and the lasting damage they do. They overtly or subtly abuse their children with constant put-downs and rob them of self-confidence. They may abuse alcohol or drugs and are mired in denial.<br />Forward says Toxic Parents cope with problems such as communication by pretending \\"nothing is wrong\\" (denial), blaming the child (projection), enlisting and ally (triangling), making the family a private club (keeping secrets), or rescuing or care-taking (sabotage).<br />Forward gives specific techniques and behavioral strategies to change your self-defeating beliefs, feelings and behaviors that keep you enmeshed with your family and prevent you from being independent. She shows how to stop feeling responsible for your parent's toxic behavior and how to respond to their negativity. She recommends that forgiveness come at the conclusion-not at the beginning of your emotional housecleaning.<br />Forward says the most healing act is the confrontation of your toxic parents via constructive criticism in person, in a letter or symbolically and shows how.<br />Forward says the healing comes not from your parents reactions (which is usually negative) but because it works. It works as you are facing your deepest fears, which is enough to begin to change the balance of power between you and your parents. She says what you don't hand back you pass on. If you don't deal with your fear, your guilt, and your anger at your parents, you're going to take it out on your partner or your children. The alternative to confrontation is to live with these fears, to reinforce your feelings of helplessness and inadequacy and undermine your self-respect.<br />Forward says, \\"There's no such thing as a bad confrontation...no matter what happens during or after any confrontation, you come out a winner because you had the courage to do it...the fear that kept you trapped in your old role with them can no longer control you.\\"deepest fears, which is enough to begin to change the balance of power between you and your parents.

B000089A07|2.0|I was happy to hear about this remake even though I am a long-time fan of MANHUNTER and totally love the original Thomas Harris novel, RED DRAGON. I had good expectations for it, as I like Ed Norton from other movies such as Fight Club, and was looking forward to Anthony Hopkins reprising his Hannibal Lecter role.<br />What a disapointment! This film is just absolutely juiceless, half-hearted and made for the \\"bucks.\\" This was a great opportunity to make a film closer to the novel's intent. While Manhunter is a stylish 80s take on the story, the script deviated seriously from the novel and left many details out. Some reviewers hear mention such things as the Blake painting, the Red Dragon tattoo, Dolarhyde's sad backstory, THE ENDING, etc. I would like to add to that what I think is the most important lack in BOTH film versions -- the novel \\"Red Dragon\\" is a tragedy, and depicts Will Graham's emotional deterioration, the breakup of his marriage to Molly, estrangement from his stepson Willy and his slide into alchoholism and depression. It does NOT end happily with Will and Molly reunited at their expensive beach home (a simple beach shack in the novel), but has Will mutilated for life and almost killed. If either of this films had the guts to tell that part of the story, instead of being solely inanmored of the police work, serial murders etc., then that would have been one hell of a truly great film and the definitive version.<br />RED DRAGON is a shameless waste of some talented actors and a big budget to make a lame movie that has no originality or point of view. Ed Norton sleepwalks through this, and I am especially disappointed in what are ordinarily talented people -- Harvey Keitel! Emily Watson! Ralph Fiennes! Phillip Seymour Hoffman! -- who make no impression at all. The script is boring and lame, despite attempts to include more material from the book. such as a \\"prequel\\" to the story that shows Will Graham being attacked by Dr. Lecter (even this, they can't stick to the story properly and make all kinds of unnecessary changes, such as having Dr. Lecter shot full of arrows!) Other annoying additions include Dr. Lecter tricking the FBI into providing him with a fancy gourmet catered dinner in his cell. And as stated earlier, an \\"invented\\" happy ending showing Will and Molly reconciled at their luxurious beach mansion.<br />Manhunter was at least an honest, high-style, suspenseful attempt to tell this story, with nice visuals and a good 80s techno-rock score...Red Dragon is a big piece of nothing. Do yourself a really big favor and READ THE BOOK.

B00005JLSE|3.0|I never saw the musical, but the plot sets the audience for a complex morality tale. The setting is one of total corruption- The main character Roxie gets away with murder- but the Commentary and the plot itself hints that the showbiz Roxie so desperately craves is not what she expected. She is doomed to a short career, sharing a stage with a woman she hates, in front of a fickle audience. The end should make one queasy that we give the media spotlight to such evil conniving monsters (and their lawyers!) Unfortunately the last number is so flashy, and Zellweger and Zeta-Jones such enthusiastic performers, that one is left with a moral vacuum. The one decent character is just abandoned, slack-jawed, and so is the audience. Perhaps Hollywood is just too corrupt to portray this story properly.- Perhaps Rob Marshall should have renamed and reset the movie in present day Hollywood- morally bankrupt Hollywood.
0898705525|5.0|Love this book.  Chesterton is sort of the Mark Twain of apologetics.  Reading it I found that I was laughing one minute and seriously blown away the next.  I am not a Christian, but this book gave me hope that maybe there is a place for a logic and faith based Christianity which is both orthodox and stronger than a fearful fundamentalism.  I like the fact that Chesterton opposes his critics while for the most part honestly respecting them as intelligent people.  It's the sign of a man secure in his ideas.<br />I would recommend this book to any other failed pagans out there.  Would also be a good read for any agnostic interested in the role of imagination in simple, thoughtful living.
B00005JMD3|2.0|Oh boy! Another big-budget TV adapation. This time, we get Hollywood's \\"bad boy of the minute\\" Colin Farrell and acting workaholic Sam Jackson as members of an elite S.W.A.T. team who must escort Euro-trash convict Martinez for a prison transfer. To spice things up, the bad guy has declared that he will pay one-hundred million dollars to anyone who helps free him causing the criminal element of the city to come out in full-force.<br />Farrell is Street, a former S.W.A.T. member who is on the Captain's \\"... list\\" after he and his old partner attempt a risky but successful save during a bank hostage crisis, that seems like it was directly pulled from the \\"44 Minutes\\" cable movie. Anyways, his old partner is out of the picture and Street is stuck at the evidence locker. Enter Hondo (Jackson). He is the type of \\"old school tough\\" that the department is looking for and they want him to start his own unit. Wouldn't you know, he finds something he likes about Street. With a new team consisiting of bad girl ...-kicker Michelle Rodriguez, rapper-actor LL Cool J, and Josh Charles, Hondo is ready for anything but not before the Captain puts his team to the test. For some reason, old Cappy doesn't much like Hondo or Street.<br />After about a half-hour or so of training montages and subplots that don't really go anywhere, the team passes the test. Lucky for them, they pass just in time to escort a notorious crime kingpin. Here is where things get sticky. We get a whole lot of car chases, explosions, and general action hijinx but it all seems to be done in a way where it seems so \\"old hat\\".<br />\\"S.W.A.T.\\" is very routine and predicatble. If that's not enough, it spends an exhausting ammount of time getting going. The movie spends over an hour and twenty minutes getting to the crisis and takes a little more than a half hour to finish it. For all the time we spend with the characters before the big showdown, we really don't learn much about them except that Street was left by his girlfriend and that Rodriguez's Chris Sanchez is a single mother who may or may not have a thing for Street. Most importantly for all the predictable plot twists, we really don't get much explanation. One of the major villian's motives aren't really detailed enough to understand why he would take such calculated risks.<br />S.W.A.T. is a two-hour movie that could have been told in under ninety-minutes. It works in some areas because of its likeable cast, most noteably Jackson and Rodriguez, but it should have been trimmed a bit in the middle. You pretty much know what you're getting into if you've watched the trailer.

6302767741|5.0|A delightful movie.  <br />Why no DVD?
B000001GRE|4.0|This is probably Pierre Boulez's most successful Mahler recording.  I have enjoyed all of his previous Mahler recordings, but this is the finest by a fair margin.<br />This is the best-played Mahler Seventh on disc.  The brass is not perfect (the playing lacks confidence, it is not very expressive, and it lacks tonal opulence) but just about every other section of the orchestra offers playing as good as can be heard anywhere in the world.<br />Boulez offers the most lucid performance of this work ever available on disc.  He reveals the symphony to be a perfectly-constructed and perfectly successful symphony.  Not even Abbado or Haitink, both excellent at serving Mahler's structural requirements in the Seventh, offered performances as natural and lucid as Boulez.<br />The downside?  Well, the fifth and final movement lacks drive, and does not offer much of a sense of culmination.  This is the only serious deficiency in the disc.<br />Nevertheless, this is now one of the four essential recordings of this work (even though the Seventh has still never enjoyed a truly great recording).  The Boulez nicely supplements Bernstein's second recording of the work (Bernstein nails the final movement, but the playing of the New York Philharmonic requires lots of indulgence), Abbado's first recording (with Chicago) and the overlooked but truly excellent Sinopoli.
B00005JLZN|4.0|This isn't one of the great movies of all time, but it certainly isn't the horribly bad movie that I imagined after reading the reviews on this site. <br />It is a sly take on capital punishment, as you probably know already. It will hold your interest right through to its twisted end, which is what entertainment is about, isn't it? <br />Having said that, I did find the characters a little cliched -- <br />(1) the alcoholic and dissolute but brilliant professor<BR>(2) the emotional and crusading activist<BR>(3) the plucky and assertive reporter<BR>(4) the good-old-boy country lawyer<BR>(5) the well-groomed but brainless governor<br />The movie has its moments, and although the \\"big explosive ending\\" was not exactly opaque to me, it does make you think. What \\"Dead Man Walking\\" accomplished at an emotional level, \\"The Life of David Gale\\" accomplishes in its message and plot. <br />Definitely worth a watch!
B00005JLFC|5.0|This is a beautiful movie. A movie you can really 'watch' and really 'listen to'. The music portrays the emotion at every turn  and is heartwarming. The color in the film is brilliant;  brilliant earth tones throughout. The acting and directing are superb. The most moving part of the film is the ending scene where Yentl is enroute to America aboard a ship; she sings \\"A Piece of Sky\\" intertwined with \\"Papa Can you Hear Me?\\" which is absolutely fantastic; she holds the last note of the song over the word \\"sky\\" for an amazing amount of time  to a final instrumental beat that has your heart beating strong with awe.

B00009P1O5|2.0|This album is mostly just okay, although some songs actually manage to be so bad they're good.  The psuedo opera singing before the chorus of opera star for example is hilarious.  Then there's T-Bone, the lyrics of which are nothing but endless repetions of 'Got mashed potatoes, ain't got no T Bone'.  The lyric sheet helpfully writes out every single repition of this.  Thanks Neil!  :)  And sadly, those are the better songs.  There are some good guitar licks on this one, of the loud and distorted variety, something Neil should do more of.  But the songs just aren't really there.  Neil himself admits his heart wasn't in this one.  At the time of its release he was involved in an intensive program with his autistic son that left little time to focus on music.  <br />I am glad to see this one is finally back out there, so collectors like myself can grab them.  Neil may sometimes be hit and miss, but he never fails to at least be interesting.  :)  If you're intrigued by the 4 new re-releases, go grab On The Beach, a true lost classic, and save this one for another day.
B00005Q4CS|4.0|Requiem for a Dream is a technically sound and quite compelling experience that can be called a cautionary tale (at least) about the dangers of substance abuse.<br />The film builds very nicely; we fade in with comedy-noir cut scenes in which two of the main characters are pushing an ancient television set on a cart across various urban setpieces. As it turns out, one of the main characters is hawking his mother's television set to pay for his habit. By the end of the film, his mother will have developed a habit as well, from seemingly innocuous beginnings.<br />After the relative silence and lightness of the early scenes the film begins to develop a darker, much more aggressive and hopelessly bleak march, climaxing with rapid cut scenes of the characters' interwoven stories that show the impending moral and emotional deaths of each. The cinematography is powerfully executed and the rising, harrowing soundtrack becomes a metaphor for the rising sense of hopelesness that permeates every frame. Five star composition.<br />My only gripe is with the plot. There are four major characters in this film, each of them an addict. While the junkie lifestyle certainly has its pitfalls each of these characters somehow happens on the worst of all possible circumstances at every crossroads.<br />The script could have been satisfied with the demonstrations that junkies often end up serving for posession or that junkies often end up turning tricks to support their habit. There was no need to take the heavy-handed approach. In this world, black junkies from Brooklyn go to all-white Klan-run prisons in the south, young wealthy female addicts end up in live lesbian S&amp;M shows for chanting mobs of white-collar criminals, and aging suburbanites with amphetamine prescriptions end up getting electroshock therapy until they're vegetative. The law of averages clearly does not apply here. These extremes do contribute to the overall effect, but they don't stand up to reflection once the smoke has cleared; this dilutes the film's message to some extent.<br />Four stars for a brilliant piece of film, but one star is lost for being so heavy-handed as to abuse the substance (so to speak) of the film for intelligent audience members.ke has cleared; this dilutes the film's message to some extent.<br />Four stars for a brilliant piece of film, but one star is lost for being so heavy-handed as to abuse the substance (so to speak) of the film for intelligent audience members.
B00003CXFV|5.0|What a great movie Erin Brockovich is.  I usually don't write reviews on DVD's/Movies unless they are typical guy movies, war movies, etc.  However, I had to make an exception for this wonderful, outstanding acted movie.<br />Julia Roberts portrays true life Erin Brockovich.  A lady who came from a not so glamerous background who with the help of the law firm she worked for took on big and powerful Pacific Gas And Electric (PG&amp;E) and won a huge settlement for the townspeople of Hinckly, California.  This is a true life case where PG&amp;E used Hazardous Chemicals in their electric turbines and took the waste from the turbines (Chronium) and instead of safely containing them in lined waste ponds, decided not to make the ponds safe and thus the Chronium seaped into the ground soil and contaminating the town's water supply.<br />Erin Brockovich (Roberts Character), needed a job desperately and was able to work for a law firm who had the case &quot;pro bono&quot;.  THANK Goodness for the law firm and Hinckly that Brockovich worked for the lawyers (even though she isn't a lawyer).<br />Overcoming a tremendous burden (single mom, low paying salary), Brockovich researched the cases, got to know the townspeople, gathered evidence, and to make a long story short, won for the &quot;little people&quot;, over 300 Million Dollars!!<br />This is a movie that everyone would enjoy.  Roberts rightfully won the Oscar for Best Actress from this movie.  All actors/actresses in this movie did an excellent job.  The plot is true life captivating, intelligent, and will keep the viewers interest from the very first scene.<br />Highly Recommended!!

But, she combines all of her creative energy and charisma to put together meaningful songs that convey various themes or politcal statements about sex.  Because of this ability to put together great songs she has become the biggest star in Music.<br />Recently she incorporated the hot sounds of Parisian electronica by working with Mirwais.   He worked as a producer on her past two albums.   If you would like to know more about the French electronica scene that helped give birth to the last two Madonna albums then go get Paris Under A Groove SV1.   This is a collection of some great artists like St  Germain, The Bottle ( a mirwais alias), Kia, TT and Florian, etc.  Dive in and hear the great new electronica from France in its original form without a Madonna make over. This one of the coolest albums around. <br />On the other hand, American life tells the story of a cynical famous woman who has various difficulties with her wealth and fame.  Oh poor Madonna.  She needs to stick with more upbeat dance tracks and stop whining about nothing.

B000002HAJ|5.0|I am sure any Robert Smith worshiper--I refer to him individually here only because he, in every mannerism and lyrical nuance, is the Cure--would skoff at what I am about to write. Mostly because any serious musical enthusiast regards one--and only one--piece of work as the magnum opus of a favorite artist(The Beatles 'White' album, Pearl Jam's 'Ten' etc.)leaving all prior efforts, in retrospect, to be considered only warm-ups, and all entecedent releases falling drastically, if not unexpectedly short by comparison. I know. I know. The Cure hit their stride in the mid-eighties, reaching the creative peak of their unique mountain of cloudy melancholy with 'Disintegration' right? Well, in 1992, the Cure accomplished something of a miracle in the music business; they released a SECOND masterpiece entitled 'Wish', a dreamy weaveworld of emotive guitar pop, laced with too much sprawling conviction and ruminative honesty to be labeled 'radio friendly'--'Friday I'm in Love' notwithstanding, of course. 'Wish' runs the emotional gamut, infused with anger, nostalgia, longing, and even skip along happiness(which was unprecedented for the notoriously gloomy Cure) Each part is seperate--never redundant or plain-- yet unquestionably part of something whole. The perpetually love-sick Smith never seemed more confident in his romanticized confusion than when he bellows 'there is no one left in the world, there is only you' on the brilliantly lethargic ballad 'Trust', or more innocently childlike in the almost too-catchy-to-believe 'High'. 'Wish' undulates in a way that gets under your skin, much the way lyric-absent chill-out electronica attempts to do these days, except The Cure did it on a canvas of swirling colors without repetitive blurring, and WITH a an all too familiar voice to guide us. And that, after all, is what a great album makes, is it not? A winding road of a listening experience--a narrative fairy tale with a beginning and an end. But, boy how I wish this one hadn't...

I apparently like \\"drivel\\" because this movie amazed me.

It was imaginitive and inventive, drawing just enough from other classic cinema, then infusing it with moody scenery and ingenuitive gunplay.  Even on this very site, the reviewer scoffs at the \\"gun katas\\" even though that seems to me like a very intelligent, natural evolution of martial arts weapon mastery.<BR>     Bottom line, don't believe everything you read.

B000055Y0X|5.0|While the previous version of Strangelove on DVD looked terrific it really was lacking in extras. That would put it on a par with the Kubrick films released by Warner Brothers (where Warner elected to remove the only extra on the 2001 DVD previously seen on the MGM version and provided few to no extras on all the other films). To be fair, that was Kubrick's wish before he died. He wasn't interested in digging up a lot to put on the DVDs. He felt the films should speak for themselves. Then again, that's why there are film historians to make sure this stuff is put.<br />A deft satire about nuclear war, the paranoia of the Communist era US and precious bodily fluids, Strangelove benefits from Kubrick's distant style as a film director. With the exception of The Marx Brothers' Duck Soup, there wasn't any political satires quite as sharp as Strangelove. Kubrick had purchased the novel Red Alert (by Peter George) in hopes of turning it into a serious look at the risk of nuclear weapons. As he prepared the final screenplay he realized that the absurdity of the situation was actually funny. Kubrick hired comic novelist Terry Southern to work with him on the final script and a comic classic was born.<br />The entire cast is perfect. Peter Sellers brings to life three separate characters all with their individual quirks and so different that it's hard to believe that they are being played by the a same actor. Unfortunately, as Sellers career progressed he never did have the staying hand that a director like Kubrick could provide. He gave many memorable performances before and after but his best performances were for Kubrick ( with the exception of Hal Ashby's Being There).<br />It's well known that George C. Scott didn't care for much of his final performance in Strangelove; he felt that Kubrick always went for the take that was over the top. He was right. It worked perfectly. Every other actor is in top form and the deadpan Sterling Hayden nearly steals his scenes with Sellers.<br />The transfer is very, very good. The extras are appropriate given this film's classic status. Included are a documentary and featurette on the making of the film. The interviews with James Earl Jones (this was his first film)and other surviving crew members are enlightening and often quite funny. There's also photos in the documentary of the fabled pie fight conclusion (sadly, the footage for this sequence no longer exists). The documentary covers everything from the inception of the project to the marketing after it was released. We also get an advertising gallery, the cutting edge theatrical trailers and production notes on the making of the film. Oh, and the inclusion of the original split-screen interviews (provided to television stations as a pre-packaged interview with the actors answering questions that would be mouthed by local critics later)is great. Scott's is particularly interesting and funny.<br />Step into the world of Strangelove and discover a past as serious as it was absurd.ers.<br />The transfer is very, very good.

B000002J09|5.0|Zoso, Runes, IV, whatever you want to call it, this album is truly Led Zeppelins best, and a personal favorite of mine. Every one of the 8 songs is worth the price of the CD. Its  combination of heavy metal and folky acoustic songs is one of a kind. All of these songs have become famous one way or another. \\"Black Dog\\" (10/10), the awsome (and my personal favorite) opening track, is packed with what zeppelin was all about:killer guitar riffs, Plant's amazing vocals, and a great heavy guitar solo. It's tricky time changes made it a hard rock favorite. The next track, \\"Rock and Roll\\"(9/10), has become a rock anthem. Despite being one of zeppelin's less creative songs, it packs a big punch and has an unforgettable tune and lyrics. The spooky, dark, and folksy, \\"The Battle of Evermore\\" (9/10) is zeppelin's best folk song and has references to J.R.R. Tolkens \\"Lord of the Rings\\". The use of the mandolin and Sandy Denny for backup vocals make for a mistical, and interesting song. And here it is, the most overplayed song in history: \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" (10/10). It starts with gentle acoustics, and gradually aquires a faster tempo until the unforgettable climax. Its mysterious lyrics and guitar chords, plus the most famous guitar solo ever, make it a great, but overrated classic. Its overplaying over time has takin away from its original beauty. After the epic \\"Stairway\\", comes the hippie/hard-rock blend of \\"Misty Mountain Hop\\"(9/10). Its strange but fun lyrics and great guitar and keyboard tune make it unique. \\"Four Sticks\\"(8/10) has another awsome riff, outstanding vocals, and a funky rythem (John Bohnam used four drum sticks during the recording, thus it's name). Then comes \\"Going to California\\" (9/10). It can be described as touching, meaningful, and just plain beautful. Some more mandolin and acoustic tunes are used here here. Then, comes another song with the same epic potential as \\"Stairway to Heaven\\": \\"When the Levee Breaks\\"(10/10). Based on an old Memphis Minnie(heis given credit for the song in the CD sleave) blues song. The harmonica drivin piece has a thundering, yet steady drum beat that makes you want to sing the blues. Its many great elements make it a masterpiece. So there you have it, all 8 great tracks of the best selling rock album of all time. Whether your a zeppelin fan or not, old or young, as long as you like classic or hard rock, you'll love this CD. Buy it! And enjoy the Zeps!
0316096199|5.0|This was a vivid and compelling account, a raw and emotional tale.  Raped in a tunnel while she was a freshman (and a virgin) at Syracuse University, Alice Sebold brings us into her world of extreme trauma and recovery.  She tells about this period of her life not as a victim but as someone of extreme integrity who commands our respect.
B00004TEUX|5.0|Peter Maag's version of the Mendelssohn &#34;Scottish&#34; has been a perennial favorite of record reviewers and standard listeners for nearly a half century. I remember when the recording was introduced on the London label here circa 1958-59. I still own the original blue back lp,with its distinctive portrait of the composer on its front jacket.I also have the current cd, on which the &#34;Scottish&#34; is coupled with the Midsummer Night's Dream Incidental Music. The lp offered the Hebrides or Fingal's Cave Overture, featuring Maag's vivid portrayal of salty air, sea spray and wind driven waves. Though his &#34;Midsummer&#34; is a good one, I derive a greater sense of interpretive rightnesss and fulfillment from the performances of Kempe/Berlin Philharmonic, Monteux/Vienna Philharmonic and Haitink/Amsterdam Concertgebouw, the latter complete with vocal segments.  I have always found the &#34;Scottish&#34; or Third Symphony, which really post-dates his &#34;Italian&#34; or Fourth Symphony, more fulfilling than its predecessor. Maag's account certainly deserves the high praise bestowed on it for its outstanding features, the most salient among them being a sense of atmospheric &#34;rightness&#34;. Of course, the recording has always displayed a marvelous sound quality too.  And, I must mention the conductor's winsome characterization of the scherzo with its mercurial flow of colors and sense of airiness. Altogether, this disc constitutes a very fine investment. Aside from Maag's &#34;Scottish&#34;, there is only one other among those I've heard which registers a good deal of pleasure, and that is Bernstein's with the New York Philharmonic. It is superbly dynamic as well as attractively presented.
6305910324|5.0|And why is it that such a ridiculously good movie has been so clearly overlooked? This is not merely a family film. This film is quietly sitting around some shelves somewhere, being a genius. The very opening, what with the soft strings carrying some undercurrent of whateverness, along with the opening dialogue (spoken so sweetly by a child no other child can dare out perform) is hair-raisingly impressive. <br />It's futile. Every second of this movie can be discussed in great detail: the technical musings, the psychological gamblings, the musical magnum opuses (becoming so excited by the thought of this movie that I'm no longer making any sense whatsoever), the acting...<br />It's quiet and it's absolutely genius. The symbolism is beautiful. I'm thinking mostly of the &quot;Don't move until you see it.&quot;/&quot;I can't see it.&quot; moment, focusing on the pawn, the King.<br />So it's good.
B000006OS2|1.0|Great Movie but DO NOT BUY this poorly made copy from Hong Kong/Taiwan. Our bought VHS tape has better picture quality than this DVD version.
B000099T2L|4.0|At first, I was very surprised by the CD. It's very different from the Destiny Child cds. There are many slow ballads. I liked Crazy In Love, but I had to listen to the cd a couple of times before the songs grew on me. Now, I play the cd all of the time. My favorite songs are Crazy In Love, Yes, and Speechless (slow ballad about making love). The song with Big Boi, Luther Vandross, and Daddy (a song devoted to her father) are just okay. The rest of the cd is great.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|His best acoustic work since Harvest. Neil always was a master story teller and this is masterful work! Like him or hate him, this is good stuff...
0671027344|5.0|There are parts of this book that speak to the very inside of your soul. It is beautifully written and constructed, the lead character giving away more of his personality than he realises. And telling yourself about your own character. I was given this book and did not expect it to affect me the way it did. This is one to read and read again.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|This CD is fantastic...got it in the mail the other day along with a couple other cd's...and well..lets just say, i haven't been able to listen to the other 3 cd's i got...this cd is taking over my player....GET IT!! NOW!!!
B000089RVX|1.0|2 be honest i wouldn't think of buying this album coz im more into r 'n' b music but i got it 4 my birthday so thats how i came across it. I was actually suprised coz this album is pretty good!The lyrics are well thought out and the melodies are very catchy so its not just noise. Also its not all hard core rock it has beautiful ballads like My Immortal. So don't knock it till you try it
B000063DHL|5.0|For me, simply brilliant! Their best album. With one of my all time favourite rock songs- Ancient years, with the best guitar solo ever. Their other albums are great including their new one.<BR>Long live Iron Maiden!
1587990717|2.0|An obviosly smart man who was dying to write a book - he says \\"I didn't want writing this book to feel like work, it must flow freely from my thoughts.\\"  Well - it shows.  For a book on probability the examples never get in more depth than 'there are 100 marbles in a jar - 55 are black and 45 are red'.  <br />He changes subjects from psycology to probability to his personal feelings.  Talks of his grand career and how smart he is - while constantly putting down everyone else.  Claims randomness is the only reason for anything to happen - nothing has any basis in fundamentals or news/world events - it's all random.  He \\"watches the depressed losers on the train reading their wall st journals every morning\\", which is completely uselss in his opinion.  <br />I love how he claims his conservative strategy made him so much money and how since the stock market is random the only thing he would ever put he earnings in were treasury bonds.  While everyone else was getting rich in the bull market and getting lucky.  Then he rips the book \\"the millionaire next door\\" because of its wrong thesis that the rich are the savers and not the guy with the 2 BMW's and huge house.  It is a basic book with the underlying theme that saving and not consuming will make you rich - hence - joe next door driving his work van is richer than luke who goes into debt to impress the neighboorhood with his luxury items.  He sort of preached this early on as he was living in the shadow of a trader who was way richer than him - who he wished would blow up because his profits were the result of luck rather than skill.  He was irked by this guy but happy to have the small house and money in t bills.  He is so smart he can't realize this other book is simply saying not to be a huge consumer and to save - but he sees this theory as ridiculous because randomness is what makes one rich or not - except in his case because his theory is correct as opposed to all the other lucky traders.  <br />there is nothing to take from this book to apply to trading and it isn't more than a compilation of a rich, bored, intelectual wanting to write a book.  <br />It does delve into the minds of some great thinkers like soros, and other philosophers and shows that as smart as they are they can still be fooled by randomness.  I think he thinks he is in their class when he clearly is not.  Worth taking out of the library but not wasting any money on.
B00003CXE6|5.0|This is a good film. Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Richard Harris, and Djimon Hounsou were superb in this movie. They are the basis of this movie. Some people say that this is a boring movie, but people who say that obviously are brain-dead and have no real taste in movies, and wouldn't know a good movie if they saw it. The only problem I have with this film is that it's historically inaccurate. But other than that, it deserved all the awards it received. And it won quite a few.
B00005JKZV|5.0|Let me start my review by saying that I did enjoy the books in this trilogy.  How could you not become engrossed and fall in love with the characters in such an epic?  But this movie, as well as the Fellowship, is just amazing to me.  The books of course give much more detail and information, and although the movie seems to skim over a bit, I feel it added so much more intensity at the same time.  To me, being able to see the character's emotions and feelings instead of the way Tolkien only hinted at them in the books makes the story more enjoyable.<BR>The movie was intense and wonderful, especially the creature Gollum.  It just felt right. Some things just work, and this movie did.  Even though in the book, Arwen was not even mentioned, I think she was referred to once or twice, I really thought the scenes with her were worked in beautifully.  You could actually see that as something Tolkien might have skimmed over in his books!  I think the making of these movies was ingenious!  I can't imagine anyone seeing The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers and not being consumed with frustration at the end for closure!  You'll be crying for more even though we all probably know what happens at the end of Sam and Frodo's quest.
B00000IOSU|5.0|This CD is amazing! Its filled with the best of her hits! Originally i bought this cd for a few of the songs i heard on the radio. Over time i grew into most of the songs on the cd. I have to say that &quot;angel&quot; is a great closing to a great cd--anyone who is into Sarah--this is a must buy!
B000069HKH|5.0|This is a great tribute album by the Boss, Bruce Springsteen none  the less! Most tribute albums are cover songs they selected to record, by their influences, this on the other hand is a tribute to those who lost their lives, and friends/Familys on 9/11. The Rising gets its point across very well, we have to move on and not forgive or forget what happend on the sad day. All the songs on The Rising are superb, not a bad track here, every song is top notch, and all of them have those great tokken Springsteen. This is truly one of the top albums to come out since the 2000's started, Rolling Stone rated this a 5***** album and for once I agree with the critics on this album, your not a Springsteen fan if you dont own this yet, and if your not a real big Springsteen fan, but only like a couple of his songs you will still love this!
B00005OAIE|1.0|I dont understand what the hype for this cd is, his songs are WAY overplayed on the radio, making any part of this cd absolutely irritating, dont waste your money. Sounds too much like dave mathews anyway--just go with dave if you want something with depth and replay value
B000021YQV|5.0|This is without a doubt one of the best metal albums of the last 15 years. I only like 2 or 3 of the Nu-Metal bands but I love System Of A Down, I own all their albums and this is the best of them! The first album was amazing and this is better and trust me that is saying a whole lot, this is also one of the best concept albums of all time, this is the bands take on L.A. and the U.S.A. in general and really its right on the money, Malakein is a great guitar player he is about the same a Adam Jones of Tool, and Serj is a great vocalist, the Drummer is over the top, and the bass player is really tight along with the drummer. All the songs on Toxicity have a massage well except for maybe 'bounce.' All the songs are great they all have a great arrangment, and great chorus' this is truly one of the better albums I have heard in a really, really long time! You will love this album, I know trust me and belive the hype. I know people who like pop and stuff like that, and they really love this album and the band as well, System is one of the better bands around today and you are really missing out if your not listening, so pick this up you owe it to yourself!
0780020685|5.0|Not only one of the best Samurai films, but one of the most perfectly made films ever!  The story is well made, the realistic characters are played by powerful actors (one of them being Toshiro Mifune), with lots of drama, humor, philosohpy AND all in 207 minutes!  What more could you ask for?  Oh, don't forget the ACTION!<br />The DVD, of course, also has extras, like audio commentary and the original US theatrical trailer.
B000001FDK|5.0|Okay, I admit when I was a teenager I liked the music on this CD and I still do I guess.  What's really interesting is that John Travolta and Stockard Channing actually sing their own music on the album. <br />There are some cheesy songs here, but overall it's pretty cool.<br />If you like the movie and the music, this is a good buy.
B0000C3I6U|5.0|The father of Bodybuilding!!! The original on video was mindblowing!Imagine what it would be on DVD!I've been waiting for this release for ages!It's a dream come true!I can't wait for my DVD!This documentary was what ignite most bodybuilders passion for the sport, Arnold and friends truly captures the essence of bodybuilding.A deep insight to the sport.Informative, fun, entertaining and enjoyable.A truly amazing docudrama.With interviews by arnold in the dvd, it really is icing on the cake!<br />Truly recommended for hardcore fans, bodybuilders and the mainstream.And remember, you heard it first from yours truly, Zamry.Indulge yourself!
B00003CXAE|5.0|My wife really loves this movie.  I don't like it quite as much as she does but I find that even after having seen it a few times, it's hard NOT to watch it when it's on.<br />The Widescreen edition is really well done.
055357342X|1.0|I can't believe I forced myself through these 3 god awful books. I cound't stand it. I put the books on my list because of recommendations here and I honestly cannot understand why anyone would like it. It was painful to read. The characters are cutouts, the plot is completely derivative. A HUGE disappointment and I cannot believe all the praise for these books is real.
B000089RVX|3.0|Finally after 8 years of waiting for this music genre to surface.<BR>Unfortuntely, for those of you have reviewed this album favorably, you have all somehow missed the incredible bands responsible for the creation of this sound.<BR>If you like this you should definitely check out bands like &quot;The Gathering&quot; &amp; &quot;Lacuna Coil&quot;. Evanescence is very good but definitely is riding in on the coat-tails of the much more talented &quot;Lacuna Coil&quot;. Five Star rating. <BR>Now for the last reviewer, who claims that Evanescence copies &quot;Linkin Logs&quot;...oops...I mean &quot;Linkin Park&quot;. &quot;Linkin Park&quot; is not qualified to even be mentioned in the same paragraph as these other bands. If you want to talk about bands ripping off other bands, how about the fact that &quot;Linkin Park&quot; is almost and exact replica of &quot;Korn&quot;. <BR>Anyway, I've ranted long enough. <BR>Buy the Evaanescence&quot; CD. It's good.
B000001F3C|4.0|This was the third U2 album I bought, after Achtung Baby and Joshua Tree.  There's nothing like listening to the young, raw, drive of 'Like a Song' when you're in a down mood.  It's a good third album to buy if you're exploring U2.  This is a great display of U2's early fire, without the almost untrained (but still fun to hear) music on Boy or October.  If you start here, and then listen to later U2 songs, like 'Some Days Are Better Than Others' on Zooropa, or 'New York' on All That You Can't Leave Behind, you'll get a taste for just how much staying power and talent this band really has.  No band has experimented as broadly and well with so many sounds and styles as U2 has.<br />Only 4 stars, though, because the lyrics and musicality on some of the tracks seem a little trite.  U2 doesn't grow into their angst for a couple of albums =).
6305546789|5.0|A boy of 6 yrs old murders his sister and is committed to a mental hospital. 15 yrs later he escapes to return to the scene of the crime on Halloween night and stalks babysitters. Jamie Lee Curtis in her prime. This movie is creepy because there is a mental hospital in my town.
0425188809|5.0|I have never been a big fan of Koontz, i found his books to be too bizzarre and out there.. but for some reason i picked this up and could not put it down- the characters really resonated iwth me, and i am a dog person, so the golden retriever parts always got me.. i find myself hearing things outside and when my dog looks up, i ask him if he hears the 'outsider'... this book is chilling, well written and a page turner, i would read it again!
B00006L7XQ|5.0|She let her name slip on her last of many bad reviews. Anyway, I really loved this album. Cash has always been one of my favorites. Worth adding to my music collection.
B00005JLSE|5.0|The negative reviews below are mind-boggling. I've now seen &quot;Chicago&quot; 4 times and each time I watch it I am still blown away. I can't wait to watch it again. Being a fan of the Broadway show, I was very skeptical when I first learned of the casting.  However, the two female leads do a phenomenal job, especially Catherine Zeta-Jones.  The singing, dancing, choreography and acting are all fantastic.  If you're not a fan of big production numbers, then &quot;Chicago&quot; isn't for you.  But if you enjoy musicals, especially stage based, then &quot;Chicago&quot; is sure to please.
B00004XMSN|5.0|I first saw this movie on British TV some years ago, and loved it. It wasn't available on video in the UK at the time so I had to order it from Amazon US, cost me more in shipping than the actual video but it was well worth it. I won't go into the story itself as all the other reviews have done that perfectly, but I will say that this is one of the best Christmas movies I have ever seen. I watch it all year round.  Cary Grant as Dudley the angel is superb, David Niven as Henry, the poor, harassed bishop is suitably harrased and harrangued by the magnificent Gladys Cooper (Mrs Hamilton) at her patronising best, Loretta Young's Julia has a habit of storming up the stairs.  Taxi driver Sylvester and Julia suddenly become expert ice skaters thanks to Dudley, and the Professor discovers that his nearly empty bottle of sherry keeps full no matter how much he pours out, the contents of which, as he says, inspires but not inebriates. Julia gets her longed-for hat and Henry gets stuck to a chair at Mrs Hamilton's. <br />The Choir rehearsal is a delight, especially Bobby, and brings tears to the eyes.  Beautifully performed by the Mitchell Boychoir, I wonder where they all are now?<br />I fully reccommend this movie, it's a delight to watch not only at Christmas but all year round, there's a message in there somewhere for all of us.
B000009PNY|5.0|Fantastic album, taking the brilliant old DM melodies into contenporary musical styles.  Uncovering and building further on the DM mystery.
B00009TB5G|5.0|I haven't seen the first movie since it came out last year so when I watched this one I had no idea what was going on about 25% of the time. The story does drag out a bit and it is very confusing much of the time but who can resist those amazingly beautiful shots? The environments and special effects make each frame suitable for a book cover. The look and feel of this film is very much enjoyable. The action scenes are energetic and suspenseful. In the last movie the big action scene was with a huge fire monster. In this one the peak is with what seems like an unwinable war. Fantastic. I look forward for the next one to find out how this all wraps up.
B000069KGM|5.0|Chicago (they were only called 'Chicago Transit Authority' for this, their debut album, before dropping the Transit Authority bit to be the more manageable 'Chicago'.  I mean imagine putting all that on the back of your T-Shirt! It would go from paw to paw) are probably the only band in history to start out with a classic ground breaking debut album and then never reaching that peak again, but slowly spiraling their way down on the helter skelter of Rock 'n' Roll. Certainly in terms of creativity if not commercial success.<br />In the mid-seventies Chicago were one of the most successful in the world. By the time of their last album, cleverly titled &quot;Chicago 26&quot; after yes, you guessed it, &quot;Chicago 2&quot;,&quot;Chicago 3&quot;, &quot;Chicago 4&quot;, etc. They had sold over 120,000,000 albums worldwide with nineteen gold albums, thirteen of which went platinum in America alone. \\"Chicago 5\\" was top of the Billboard Charts for nine weeks. Twenty top ten singles and five number ones. Not bad for a band that was slowly going down the drain! Today the band is still going with four of the original seven, still in their ranks. (They could of been five, but stunning guitarist Terry Kath was tragically killed in a shooting accident at a party.)<br />But when this album came out in 1969, incredibly it was a double album, unheard of in those days for a debut album to be a double. Most established bands found it difficult to fill up both sides of a single Vinyl record without adding some filler to take up the slack in the required forty minutes. Seems remarkable in these days of seventy two minute CDs. The Chicago Transit Authority were the top ticket. Groundbreaking in every aspect, they had a conventional four piece line-up with bass, drums, keyboards and lead guitar; the vocals shared between the three that weren't drumming. However, they also had three other full time members of the road and studio band playing a combination of trombone, trumpet, and woodwind instruments. That gave them a unique sound combining Jazz/Pop/Rock/Funk/Soul with glorious musical skills. Before they had even signed a recording contract they had been invited out on the road with both Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix. Jimi Hendrix famously being quoted as saying that Terry Kath was the best guitarist in the world. One listen to this album and you have to admit that Jimi might not have been wrong.<br />The music kicks off with the aptly titled &quot;Introduction&quot; singing of how they are looking forward to playing for you. In the space of it's six and a half minutes each section of the band gets space to stretch their musical abilities, specially mid-song when they slip away into a Samba direction reminiscent of today's Santana sound. A stunning start. This is quickly followed by the first single from the album. Although the single is not a hit until after their breakthrough single the following year, the hard driving &quot;25 or 6 to 4'' from &quot;Chicago 2&quot;. \\"Does Anybody Know What Time It Is&quot; with it's simple piano refrain and driving brass backing is music to tap your feet to. &quot;Beginnings&quot; is easily good enough to have been the opener. It is similar in vain to &quot;Introduction'', but slightly more laid back with a nice groove that has you swaying along. &quot;Questions 67 and 68&quot; is the second single taken from the album with soaring vocals and fluid runs from Terry Kath, instantly laying the template for the 'Chicago' sound. &quot;Listen&quot; is a nice little number for the rhythm and horn sections to show off their wears. The next three workouts belong primarily to the guitar playing skills of Terry Kath. This boy could shred the wallpaper off your walls at one hundred yards. &quot;Poem 58&quot; slowly grinds its way up to a shattering climax that leaves you wanting more, so Terry Kath delivers a solo  &quot;Free Form Guitar&quot; all six and a half minutes of it. What it says is what you get performed on a Fender Stratocaster guitar through a Showman amplifier equipped with a twin 15 bottom utilizing a Bogan P.A amplifier as a pre-amp. No electronic gimmicks or effects were used in the recording of this section. The intent being to capture as faithfully as possible Kath's solo spot from their live show as it sounded on stage. &quot;South California Purples&quot; starts off with a classic rock guitar riff allowing all the band members to come in on its back before breaking into snatches of Beatles lyrics and chords, almost like sampling  from the present day. Then we get &quot;I'm a Man&quot;, a cover of the Spencer Davis classic written by Steve Winwood. Chicago turn it into their own including a short sharp sweet drum solo from Danny Seraphine . &quot;Prologue&quot;  is an actual recording of a Democratic Convention in Chicago, 29 August 1968, with militants exhorting demonstrators with ''God Give Us The Blood To Keep Going&quot;. Then when the march begins and the police attempt to disperse the marchers, they chant &quot;The Whole World Is Watching&quot;, a dramatic beginning to &quot;Someday&quot;, Chicago's song in support of these demonstrators.<br />The last song, &quot;Liberation&quot;, is the crowning jewel in Chicago's locker. A fast paced dance track that is driven along by pounding bass and drums with all the soloists given space during its fourteen and a half minute stretch. If &quot;Chicago'' never sounded so good again over the next thirty three years, it's no wonder. This album was simply impossible to follow.<br />The sort of music all New Zealand headmasters have displayed on their shelves. Quite rightly, too.<br />  Mott The DogFender Stratocaster guitar through a Showman amplifier equipped with a twin 15 bottom utilizing a Bogan P.A amplifier as a pre-amp.

Then when the march begins and the police attempt to disperse the marchers, they chant &quot;The Whole World Is Watching&quot;, a dramatic beginning to &quot;Someday&quot;, Chicago's song in support of these demonstrators.<br />The last song, &quot;Liberation&quot;, is the crowning jewel in Chicago's locker. A fast paced dance track that is driven along by pounding bass and drums with all the soloists given space during its fourteen and a half minute stretch. If &quot;Chicago'' never sounded so good again over the next thirty three years, it's no wonder. This album was simply impossible to follow.<br />The sort of music all New Zealand headmasters have displayed on their shelves. Quite rightly, too.<BR>                                                                                                 Mott The Dog
B00005JLKN|5.0|can anyone truly deny the superiority of this over ''manhunter'' ?( william peterson being the exception- the perfect will graham, in my opinion. ) this one will always suffer by comparison ONLY by the misfortune of being the 2nd adaptation of the great t. harris book. noonan was great, but missed key character elements of dolarhyde- i suppose the fault is mainly michael mann's, which is puzzling, since he is a great filmmaker at times ( HEAT, for instance ) - but how can you justify the exclusion of the tattoo and mythology of ' the dragon ',not to mention that old nursing home?  this is who francis dolarhyde IS: he dosen't see himself ' loved and accepted ' by those women, he only see's what they can do for him in ' the becoming '. of course there is a deep need for francis to be loved, and it's clearly stated in the book that reba is the only one to ever get close to him and live. by the time he is fully in the dragon persona, all such considerations are moot- it's then all about achieving power through that embodiment. ralph fiennes captured that dynamic perfectly- the switch from francis to the dragon. in turn, emily watson is something to behold in her portrayal of reba- with her wide eyes blind to the danger she is in- the audience truly fears for her when she is alone with him, because we by then have seen what the dragon is capable of. hoffman is perfect as lounds, and the key scene involving him and the dragon is one of the most frightening and powerful things ever comitted to film. if i could improve upon greatness, i would replace norton with will peterson- but norton does a decent job, so little complaint there. all in all, a well made film of a truly great book- couldn't ask for more.
B00009V7PJ|5.0|The colour, the audio and the chorography all come together in a splashy exciting bold show. Cher is amazing,never showing anything but love and enthusiasm for her effort here. The dvd has many exciting features,including a very informative documentary.Cher is in great voice, and showcased perfectly.This can't be a real farewell, as she is just too vital of a performer, the real entertainer to survive the 60's generation.Sonny would be proud and jealous too!
B00005JKZV|5.0|\\"The Two Towers\\" follows the continuing saga of Frodo, the hobbitt entrusted with returning the sacred gold ring to Mordor to save middle earth from utter destruction.  As trilogies go I'm reserving my final judgment until I see part three.  But as sequels go I must say that this one fell a little short of my expectations. Yes, it is a breathtaking visual experience to behold and yes, equally stirring are the performances from the expansive cast of characters.  Yet there seems to be something of that spark of magic - so evident in the first movie - that is lacking in part two.  <br />Unlike, say \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\" which is the second installment of the first \\"Star Wars\\" trilogy and is brilliantly and fully realized as both a sequel to the original film and a stand alone piece of fiction, \\"The Two Towers\\" cannot and does not function apart from the original \\"Lord of the Rings\\".  It needs the familiarity of Part One to encourage a viewer onward throughout its three hour plus running time.<br />TRANSFER: A stunning example of DVD's capabilities. The picture is rich, bold and vibrantly balanced.  The stylized picture is beautifully rendered.  Black levels are solid.  Fine detail, black and contrast levels are superbly realized.  Only the slightest hint of pixelization is detected as well as a modest amount of edge enhancement - though nothing to distract one from this visual experience.  The audio is 5.1 and astounding in its bass and spread across all five channels.  This soundtrack really rocks the house.<BR>Extras: Too many to go into detail but the 10 minute teaser for \\"The Return of the King\\" is nicely done.  Ditto for the documentary on the making of part two, although it strangely has the look, feel and flavor of the documentary on the making of part one.  A few other featurettes round out your DVD viewing enjoyment. <BR>BOTTOM LINE: If you own part one then you'll want to get part two.  Personally, I'm hoping that the third installment will bring everything to a justifiable climax, something I found lacking in \\"The Twin Towers\\".
0671027344|5.0|The other reviews of the book are accurate in their synopsis of the book, so I'm here to tell you that this book is simply amazing. Everyone should read it at least once. It's actually perfect to read once before high school and once after. I love this book!
B000002WCJ|5.0|First it's needed to realize that music was recorded somewhere between 1986-1988 and then if you are in real music and art you will find out that even today 2003 this album is more than excelent and why-?1,extremely technical musicians 2,excelent lyrics 3,best singer on the planet 3,players with life knowledge regardles in that time their early age 4,huge feelings and excelent melodic parts with heavy riffs and beauty combine together.They changed the time and even today this album is unbeatable bu NO ONE!by all aspects and positions this is BEST music album on THE Earth!!!!!!!!!<BR>No one else has chance even get close to them!
0380002930|5.0|Watership Down is simply one of the greatest novels ever written. Although often considered a children's book, it really takes an adult to appreciate Adams wonderful tale in all its manifestations. The book has many themes weaved through it: ecology, man's place in nature, the nature of primitive societies (the parallels between rabbit society and that of pre-agricultural man are many), amongst others. However perhaps the most important theme in the book, and one I would like to explore a little in this review, is the importance of individual freedom. <BR>The Sandleford warren is destroyed because it will not, can not by its very make-up, heed the warning of Fiver. It is only freedom that allows the individual talents of Dandelion, Bigwig, Blackberry, Fiver and especially Hazel to blossom; to leave the Sandleford warren, understand the dangers of Cowslip's warren and defeat General Woundwort and the Efrafans.<BR>Many have compared the Efrafa with Nazism because of its military character. I feel the parallels with communism are stronger: Woundwort as Stalin, Vervain and his secret police as Beria and the NKVD, and the Owsla as the Party. The lack of freedom, the show trials, the great Leader, are of course common to both fascism and communism. However the strict regimentation, the fact that no one is allowed to leave, and above all the justification that oppression is necessary for the good of the group; these are all hallmarks of socialist states from the Soviet Union in the 30's to today's North Korea.<BR>Please understand that these are underlying themes only, the book is in its essence an adventure tale, and one of the most enjoyable ever written.
0425173895|5.0|Agatha Christie is not the greatest writer on the face of the earth.  Her prose is adequate (at least fast moving, though).  However, her imagination and plotting abilities are unbelievable.  There are so many surprise plot twists and turns that we see day after day in modern movies and such that she invented.  <br />Her THE ABC MURDERS really introduced the serial killer to a wide audience, for example.  As did A PALE HORSE.  She also spent much time with her archeologist husband in Egypt and the ancient middle-east, and many of her books are full of lovely detail and settings from this part of the world.  You'd be hard pressed to find a more delightful writer, who decade after decade came up with one whopper of a surprise ending after another.  I've read ALL of her books, and probably only guessed the murderer correctly maybe 10% of the time.<br />THE MURDER OF ROGER ACKROYD, a fairly early novel of hers, gave us perhaps THE classic surprise ending to a whodunnit EVER.  It's been done since, but never better, except perhaps in Christie's own haunting novel ENDLESS NIGHT.  I read this novel twenty years ago, having heard it had a great ending, and I tried like heck to figure it out.  But I never dreamed the solution that was presented could be it. WOW!  Unless you're a totally jaded reader of whodunnits, this is a must read.<br />Now remember, Christie was practically from the Victorian age.  Her books are chaste and not terribly violent or action packed.  Lots of talking and looking for clues.  Not much chasing or fighting or shooting!!  These are sedate, rainy-day reads.  But don't think her books are just for fuddy-duddies or &quot;old folks.&quot;  I think they are a fascinating slice of social history, and a darn fine brain-teaser.  And THE MURDER OF ROGER ACKROYD would be a GREAT introduction to Christie.<br />(Other books of hers I especially recommend, THE MYSTERIOUS AFFAIR AT STYLES [her very first book], ENDLESS NIGHT, DEATH COMES AS THE END [set in ancient Egypty!!], THE ABC MURDERS &amp; MURDER IN MESOPOTAMIA [set at an archelogical dig and just dripping with authenticity])
B000005Z0E|5.0|Sorry, I saw Eric Smith's one star review, and I couldn't help myself.<br />In it he says this album and Tupac started a style of \\"Women, Cars and Sex\\". First, I don't think any cars are mentioned on this album, period. (If they are its certainly not in the \\"Bling, blings look at them rims sense\\") As for women and sex, both are mentione, but not with the mysoginistic focus that you'll find in most modern rap. Instead, we get songs like \\"Brenda's Got a Baby\\" and \\"Part Time Mutha\\" that talk about the consequences of underaged or unprotected sex, and the horrors of sexual abuse.<br />The entire album follows this mold; bringing to light social and political issues rather than focusing on materialism as much \\"MTV\\" rap does. Tracks like \\"Trapped\\", \\"Violent\\" and \\"Words of Wisdom\\" make powerful and truely scathing attacks on the inequalities of modern American society. (In fact, \\"Violent\\"'s story of a tragic entrapment by crooked cops makes it probably the best track on the album.)<br />In short, this is the first album by someone who is arguably rap's most well-known artist, and it certainly shows why.
B00008RH3L|5.0|Back in 1990, I was vaguely aware of the Coen Brothers, having seen Raising Arizona several dozen times. I was eager to see their new release, which from the ads seemed like it would be an entertaining, quirky gangster film. While I never got to see it theatrically, several months later I saw it on video and was amazed. Miller's Crossing is easily the best gangster film of all time.<br />The dialogue is second-to-none, and the acting is simply perfect. Albert Finney delivers one of the greatest scenes in cinematic history when he shows why he's known as &quot;an artist with the Thompson&quot;. This is as close to perfect as a movie can get.<br />The wait for the release of this DVD was maddening. My trusty, old VHS copy had nearly worn out. When I finally picked this up, I was thrilled beyond belief. It was the first time I'd seen it widescreen, and the picture looked amazing compared to my old tape. While I would have liked to have seen a deluxe special edition, I'm more than pleased with this DVD.<br />If you enjoy movies of any kind, you owe it to yourself to own Miller's Crossing.
B00000I8BX|5.0|One of my favorite albums next to Demanufacture. all I can say is i wish they were still around to keep making great Albums. all the songs  Are really nice and heavy and gets you in a nice Mood.
B0000047CW|5.0|Nothing could top the opening track.  What else is there? To borrow an overused cliche, this is &quot;Smooth Jazz&quot; at its best. BUt the homogenized smooth jazz of today but the sweet delicious tone of Staz Getz.  This is music to hold hands to , music to make love to, music to gaze at the moon.  The only problem being there is a lack of diversity among the tracks so they tend to blur.
B0000714BP|5.0|It's poignant, it's irreverent, it makes you laugh, and it makes you cry...a remarkable movie!
B000065V3H|4.0|Viewed as a genre of its own, the 80's Teen Comedy produced some fun, enjoyable movies. One that holds up quite well is Can't Buy Me Love. Starring Patrick Dempsey in what was probably his best role of the era, it's the story of a geeky kid who pays the captain of the cheerleading team to pretend to be his girlfriend for a month. While not entirely realistic, it has a good ending. The humor holds up well after 16 years, as does the movie overall.<br />The DVD was hugely disappointing, and my 4 stars are based on the movie itself. Unless you consider chapter stops a special feature, the disc is devoid of any extras. The greatest offense is that it's presented only in fullscreen. I'd normally pass on a non-widescreen release, but my wife insisted on having it. If you have to have this movie, this is probably the best release it will see for quite some time.
B00006690G|3.0|The Eminem Show is a nice effort by Eminem for 2002.  This is a good album but not as good as the Marshall Mathers LP and Slim Shady LP respectively.  One thing it does do is show Eminem's maturity and growth as an artist.  On the first full track White America, Eminem comes to the realization that if he were black he would have only sold half.  This is very true because black artists such as Nas and Jay-Z who are more skilled than Em, have never come close to selling an unprecedented 11 million copies like the Marshall Mathers LP has.  Well on with the rest of the album.<br />Business is a pretty good track.  It's one of those not bad tracks but not horrible tracks.  I used to love Cleaning Out My Closet but got sick of it after hearing it hundreds of times on radio and tv.  It is a great track though.<BR>Square Dance has a mediocre beat but has nice lyrics.  Em does well on this one.<BR>Soldier is one of the best cuts on the album.  Em raps with a slick and fast tongue and the beat is sick.  I guarantee you'll love this track.  <BR>Out of the next three tracks: Say Goodbye to Hollywood, Drips, and Without Me, only Say Goodbye to Hollywood is good.  Drips is a horrible track for Obie, he raps better on mixtapes.  Without Me is the pop-like single for the album.  It reminds you of The Real Slim Shady and My Name Is.  <BR>The next full track, Sing For the Moment is the best track on the album.  Despite the fact that it is sampled from Aerosmith, Eminem spits some of the realest lyrics of the album on this song.  I can really feel him on this one.  He explains the meaning of the gangsta rap that many rappers today feel they have a need to spit.<BR>The next track Superman was funny and amusing to me at first, but now it's annoying to me.  Eminem should leave the misogynist rapping to Ludacris because Luda does it better.  <br />The rest of the album's tracks are about average and don't really stand out.  The exception being 'Till I Collapse.  'Till I Collapse is the 2nd best track on the album.  It has the hook master Nate Dogg on it.  On this song Eminem reveals a list of emcees in order who he says are better than him.<BR>He says \\"Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac, Biggie, Andre 3000 from Outkast, Jadakiss, Kurupt, Nas, and then himself\\".  The list is pretty accurate.  Though I would put Nas after Biggie and Em after Nas and Redman especially doesn't belong at the top of the list.  Jadakiss is good but in my opinion doesn't even belong in the top 10 of rap.<br />Overall the Eminem is a good album and if you have the extra money then you should buy it.  There are some tracks up here definitely worth the money.
B000003N7G|5.0|This and Kind Of Blue were my first two purchases (I sure can pick 'em). Both are brilliant. However, while Kind Of Blue is a truly classic album, Coltrane's A Love Supreme defies even that standard. It is a masterwork among masterworks, perhaps the greatest accomplishment in the jazz world and certainly the best thing Coltrane ever recorded (and since his catalog also contains Blue Train, Giant Steps, Crescent, Ascension, and Interstellar Space, that's really saying something).<br /><br />Around the time this album was made (1964), Coltrane became highly devoted to the Christian faith, swearing off drugs and rededicating his life to God. This spirituality is a central theme of A Love Supreme. Although many people are bothered by the heart-on-sleeve Christianity of the liner notes, be aware that you don't have to be Christian at all to enjoy this album.<br /><br />The music is highly modal, and is composed of various interpretations on the same musical phrase. Take the first track Acknowledgement, where the band repeats a single four-note phrase (led by Coltrane's ever-capable tenor sax) though interpreting it a different way each time. There's a lot of free jazz elements, including occasional bits of atonality and some insane polyrhythms (courtesy of Elvin Jones, one of jazz's elite drummers) that point the way toward Coltrane's radical future material.<br /><br />Coltrane's playing is on fire here. From the urgent blowing on Acknowledgement to the shimmering beauty of Psalm, where Coltrane intones a prayer to God through the voice of his tenor sax. Perhaps Jimi Hendrix was listening to this album and taking notes--after listening to A Love Supreme I'm thoroughly convinced that Hendrix was trying to do on his guitar what Coltrane was doing with his sax, using the instrument as an expression of the soul.<br /><br />I know this review sounds gushy, but A Love Supreme is truly one of the 20th century's great artistic achievements, and no collection (jazz or otherwise) is complete without it. However, it's not for jazz newbies--Coltrane starts navigating some fairly abstract territory here, and if you're not accustomed it's easy to get lost. Buy Blue Train and Giant Steps first to understand Coltrane's development. Then pick up A Love Supreme and rest assured, it will amaze you.wever, it's not for jazz newbies--Coltrane starts navigating some fairly abstract territory here, and if you're not accustomed it's easy to get lost.

0792844882|1.0|My dad gave me this DVD when he couldn't make it through the first 15 minutes of it. I have to commend him on making it that far. I've tried to watch it three times now, and ten minutes is the most I can take. Sure, it's full of very attractive and very naked actresses, but it's also full of some of the most reprehensible acting and dialogue I've ever seen. It's truly painful to watch. The whole (short) time I spent watching this, I kept asking myself of everyone involved, \\"What were they thinking?\\"
B00000JCOV|1.0|If you believe music has lost all meaning and direction, Slipknot proves your point.<BR> If you buy this album, which I can not stress more than the simple word DON'T, then do not expect the highest quality of music. Instead expect lyrics about suicide, mental illness, murder, rape, drugs, and of course self mutalation, screamed while one chord guitar ballads are accompanied by drums that sound like a child banging on pots and pans. <BR> If you are battling schizophrenia and need something to relate to purchase this album, if you are looking for a good modern metal album look elsewhere. If you want to waste your money then I suggest wasting it on something else.
B0000028RR|4.0|From the beginning in 1992, Rage Against The Machine rank as the best, most intelligent foray into the tepid rap-metal genre. While their radical politics may not be for everyone (I'll get to that in a minute), when they were \\"on\\" not many mainstream bands could rival their intensity. Rage Against The Machine's debut is perhaps their most consistent and best album.<br /><br />The debut has a different feel from their later releases--the song structures are stretched longer, and the lyrics read more like political slogans than the poetry of The Battle Of L.A. The rhythm section also plays a more prominent role, with Tim C.'s funky slap-bass rhythms and tight drumming by Brad Wilk. Tom Morello's guitar playing never fails to amaze, with big Led Zeppelin-esque riffs (check out the Kashmir homage on Wake Up!) and unique electronic blips and effects.<br /><br />Zach De La Rocha is a unique vocalist--love him or hate him, few can argue with the power of Rocha's delivery and lyricism, somewhat remiscient of Chuck D. from Public Enemy. And the lyrics here are VERY powerful. Take Know Your Enemy, for example (which features a strong guest vocal by Tool's Maynard Keenan):<br /><br />\\"Yes, I know my enemies/<br />They're the teachers who taught me to fight me/<br />Compromise, conformity, assimilation, submission/<br />Ignorance, hypocrisy, brutality, the elite/<br />All of which are American dreams..\\"<br /><br />The last line is repeated several times, driving the song home and leaving the listener stunned. And the album achieves this level of power again on Wake Up, with the verse:<br /><br />\\"Ya know they murdered X/<br />And tried to blame it on Islam/<br />He turned the power to the have-nots/<br />And then came the shot/<br />What was the price on his head?\\"<br /><br />The rest of the album approaches or matches this level of quality, with only Settle For Nothing leaving me somewhat cold. Definitely worth a purchase, then check out the great third album The Battle Of L.A. (skip over Evil Empire).<br /><br />Note: I agree with some of the political views and disagree with others expressed on this album (such as the pro-socialism stance), but ultimately it is possible to enjoy the top-notch music and not agree with the rhetoric. As far as being charged as \\"hypocrites,\\" yes they are on a major label. However, a great deal of Rage Against The Machine's proceeds go to Amnesty International and other organizations, so I wouldn't be so quick to call them \\"sellouts.\\" Just thought I'd contribute my opinion.ews and disagree with others expressed on this album (such as the pro-socialism stance), but ultimately it is possible to enjoy the top-notch music and not agree with the rhetoric.

B000002NBY|5.0|It really doesn't get any better than this.  Poetic, heartbreaking lyrics, catchy melodies, originality for days.  The music is confessional, but we can all relate.  It doesn't age because Simon could care less about selling albums or hitting your demographic.  Its all gravy.  It grooves, it soothes, it even makes you think.  After you really listen to this, you can't go back to the same old top 40 shlock the industry puts out.  Deeply passionate without a hint of aggression.  Deeply personal.  This is it.
B000002I6T|2.0|This is one of my favorite albums, but the sound quality of this CD issue is atrocious.  The high end is chalk-board harsh.  This wonderful inspired album needs wonderful inspired remastering -please!

B00007M5CO|4.0|Tango is a mood. You don't listen to tango, you &quot;feel&quot; tango. Tango is a way of complaining about your unhappy moments in life, to understand it (and like it) you must have lived and suffered (a boy who left you, a girl who didn't pay attention to you) and when you are 18 there's not much that can put you in a tango way... <BR>Nevertheless, 2002 was a though year in both sides of Rio de la Plata, we all felt tragic, nostalgic, no matter how old or young we were. And there it appeared, Bajodondo, the perfect sound for those who wouldn't listen to tango. The right mix of tango mood and DJs. There's a little bit of everything you must listen to, but sampled, so give tango a try!
B000002LKF|4.0|Overall, I found this album to be less compelling and inspired than Graceland, but that's just me.  Lots of rather obscure lyrics with flashes of poetic beauty.  The music is haunting and percussion-heavy.  Still better than 98% of what's at your local record shoppe.  If you are new to Paul Simon, check out Graceland or Simon and Garfunkle...if not, this is a good one too, but, then, you already knew that, didn't you?

0452283760|5.0|It is almost as interesting to absorb the responses of readers to this text as it is to absorb the text itself.  Almost invariably, they fall into two camps: those for whom a weight is lifted and a hateful thing is explained, and those for whom the truth of the text is so unbearable that they feel compelled to somehow diminish its relevance.  Therefore, though I think The Fountainhead is one of the most important works of fiction ever written in the English language, I do not necessarily recommend it to others.  However, I will say that if you decide to read the text, you will almost certainly receive it with either the relief Ayn Rand writes about in her 25th anniversary introduction when she says that a rare few people will recognize Howard Roark and his struggle, and it is to them that she addresses her work, or you will receive it with the desperation of Peter Keating to justify his existence and his choices.  <br />If you are in the former camp, then I salute you.  If you are in the latter, I invite you to read the rest of Ayn Rands aforementioned introduction and continue to freely offer your opinions about the text, so that I might recognize you by your words.
B0000844I8|4.0|I started watching Stargate SG1 from the first season. Naturally, the more I watched it, the more I grew to love it. After all these years I still had not seen the movie up until a week ago when I rented it. And I was not disappointed in the least! Although there were some changes from the movie into the show, I was still enthralled. And Alexis Cruz was so great in this movie! Cast as a young boy (Skaara) on the enslaved alien planet of Abidonia, he is, without a doubt, the best part of the movie! He does a superb job as do all of the actors. It makes for a wonderful movie to own.
B00006SFBD|5.0|As all of my previous Opeth reviews state, it really is redundant to even sit and praise any of these albums. One listen is worth a thousand words. Deliverance is a rattling juggernaut of pure death metal; one that will most likely never be duplicated. From the pure brain-shattering romp of \\"Wreath\\" to the pastoral beauty that is \\"For Absent Friends,\\" Opeth again proves that they are the penultimate metal band on the planet. Versatile, lyrical, emotional and intricate, Deliverance is a required piece of any metal fans collection.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|This is &quot;another&quot; landmark album from Neil.  I think Neil must have realized that most of us &quot;Rusties&quot; have already heard the acoustic verisons of these songs from audience recordings made in Europe.  I am somewhat partial to the acoustic live versions of these songs, and the bonus DVD is very nice.  It is great to hear Neil go electric on these songs though, especially &quot;Leave the Driving.&quot;  I did not think that any change from the sparse acoustic arrangements would be good but I was wrong!  This seems to be the &quot;Tonight's the Night&quot; of the 00's because he toured with completely unreleased and unheard material that none knew or expected.  This is captured on the bonus DVD.  Imagine Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera ever having the stones to do something like this!!!!<BR>The lyrics are compelling, heartfelt, and at times distrurbing.  They somehow remind me of Steven King's fiction--not the super scary stuff, but the Shawshank Redemption, The Body (Stand By Me), and Green Mile stuff.  Just intelligent writing and good arrangements.<BR>The only drawback is that I don't think Neil is quite at his vocal best.  I prefer Neil's singing on the live shows from the Greendale tour.  I like his unique voice and I don't expect him to sound like a songbird, but sometimes he sounds a little tired.  Perhaps that is the intended effect.  It is helpful to put this one away for a while and come back to it.  Whenever I do that with any of Neil's albums (except perhaps Landing on Water)I am pleasantly surprised at how much I dig it later.  Get it.  Enjoy it.  Live it.  Love it.  Warts and all.
0385504209|5.0|The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown was one of three books I bought at one time. I am not typically a mystery fan and what I really enjoyed bout Brown's book is that it is not a &quot;typcial&quot; mystery. It's really great. I read it at the same time as I read My Fractured Life by Rikki Lee Travolta and despite being two different genres, there were a lot of similarities. It's a sign of great authors, crossing typical genre barriers. Da Vinci is more than a mystery; Fractured is more than a Hollywood story. I truly enjoyed both because they refused to be cornered into a genre. Both kept me guessing.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|Neil Young<br />You amaze and baffle your fans with sometimes erratic sometimes brilliant music.<br />Greendale beats them all,<br />What a marvelous piece of music.<br />Laugh, cry and enjoy Greendale.<br />Get the set with the DVD, Greendale is far better heard in acoustic format. (a must get)
B00007LTIA|5.0|Rhino did an outstanding job on Yes's Tales From Topographic Oceans. They gave the album the complete royal treatment that it so deserves, from the packaging, the high quality of the artwork, the beautiful casing, the very interesting and colorful photographs and extra liner notes, to the pristine, crystal clear sound quality (better than even the Japanese version), the very surprising addition to the album's exciting actual introduction, and the two very incredible studio run-throughs that, at times, make you wonder how it turned out the way it did. I have looked forward to this release for a very long time, and, after finally experiencing it, I must say that it far exceeded my expectations. Rhino are truly the real deal as I can clearly see that a lot care went into this. So, I say to them, thank you for the excellent, excellent work you did on this masterpiece, this, the greatest album ever written.
0790751305|2.0|I GUESS ITS ABOUT TIME I GOT AROUND TO REVIEWING THIS FILM.<BR>I LOVE EASTWOOD AND AM ENAMORED WITH GOOD 'WESTERNS' UNFORTUNATELY THIS AINT ONE OF THEM.<br />YES, IT IS WELL DIRECTED, WELL WRITTEN AND WELL ACTED. SO WHATS MY BEEF? IT AINT A WESTERN! WESTERNS ARE ABOUT BIG FOLKS DOING BIG THINGS. AND THE BIG FOLKS ARENT GUILT RIDDEN, WHINING RETROBATES.<br />THIS MOVIE WHINES, AND MOANS, AND GROANS THROUGH THE FIRST HOUR AND A HALF. IF IT WASNT FOR GENE HACKMAN'S GIDDY ROLE AS THE SOUR BUT REAL AND NOT WHINING 'BIG WHISKEY' SHERIFF IT WOULD BE UNBEARABLE. (AINT IT FUNNY HOW LIBERALS PLAY REALLY GOOD CONSERVATIVES? I THINK ITS BECAUSE INSIDE EVERY LIBERAL THERE IS AN INTELLIGENT CONSERVATIVE WANTING TO GET OUT!)<br />AT ANY RATE OUR PROTAGONIST, THE BEMOANED EASTWOOD RELUCTANTLY TRAVELS OUT ON A 'KILLING' BECAUSE HE NEEDS THE MONEY. HE IS PARTNERD WITH A FAR SIGHTED KID WHO DOESNT KNOW SHINOLA FROM YOU KNOW WHAT, AND 'NED' EASTWOOD'S COMPADRE FROM THE OLD DAYS.<br />NEITHER NED NOR THE BOY HAVE THE STOMACH FOR THE JOB. AND THATS WHERE I HAVE MAJOR PROBLEMS WITH THIS STORY. IT HAS NO CREDIBILITY. I CAN ALREADY HEAR THE 'REBUTTALS' I KNOW THAT IS THE STORY. BUT LIKE A BLIND HOUND &quot;THAT DOG WONT HUNT!&quot;<br />THE FILMS ONLY SAVING GRACE IS AT THE END WHERE EASTWOOD'S ' WILL MUNNY' FINALLY GROWS SOME GUTS AND WIPES OUT THE GUYS WHO HAVE BRUTALLY INTERROGATED AND KILLED 'NED.'<br />THE ONLY THING UNFORGIVEN HERE, IS EASTWOOD, FOR INSULTING THE VERY GENRE THAT MADE HIM WHAT HE IS.
B00005JKZV|5.0|Like what many reviewers have said, there are a lot of differences from the movie to the book.  However, I think it's a good thing for we won't really know what to actually expect with the third installment.  To actually stay loyal to the book just simply means that LotR will turn into a miniseries rather than 3 movies.  Of course things will be deleted or changed.  I'm just glad that the other important parts in \\"The Two Towers\\" book WILL be in the third film.  Peter Jackson has done it again!  This movie didn't feel like 3 hours.  It felt shorter.  There are some scenes that drag because it involves a lot of talking.  However, that is key for more character development and how the characters will grow (particularly Merry and Pippen).  Serkis does a great job as Gollum.  You can't help feeling some sympathy for the creature.  The scenes with Arwen are meant to represent how strong her bond with Aragorn is.  Overall, it's a great film and shouldn't be compared to the books page-by-page.  Enjoy the film as it is.
B00009RGBS|1.0|I had an idea that some things simply do not translate from stage into film well, so I would understand that &quot;Chicago the Movie&quot; was going to be only half as good as the &quot;Chicago the Play&quot; but this movie wasn't even half! While Rene Zellweger did a good job holding up her role, Catherine Zeta Jones totally tanked, and who in the world cast Richard Gere? He was god-awful in the part of Billy Flynn. <BR>There are those who can sing and dance and there are those who can't and this movie proves that. Gere couldn't carry a tune, and for all of the major characters there were &quot;stunt dancers&quot; that were way too obvious in the final cut. It's a shame.<BR>The lesson of this film is this: if you can't sing the part, if you can't dance the part, don't take the part. Gwen Verdon and Bob Fosse are roling in their graves, and I want my money back.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Beautiful! Brilliant! The best from Studio Ghibli yet. <BR>The animation promises to wow you and take you from your couch into the colourful exciting world of chihiro entered.<BR>The storyline captures your imagination as well as provokes thought.
B00003CXTG|4.0|OK, this movie had a bad screenplay, the history was not accurate, and the acting was hokey.<br />But, there is this one stretch of scenes in this movie that has stuck in my mind, which I thought was just brilliant. At the beginning of the Japanese attack, we see the planes juxtaposed against a number of really beautiful scenes of lost innocence - a Little Leaguer watches curiously as a Japanese plane flies by,  the Army nurses walk slowly to work in their dress whites, the hospital, with the open windows and billowing white curtains, etc., all flashbacks to an earlier time in America, that would be lost forever in the next few minutes of hell.<br />Kate Beckinsale was also gorgeous, another reason to buy this DVD.<br />Pearl Harbor was to America what Cannae was to the Romans.  Pearl Harbor was a tragic defeat that would galvanize a sleeping giant and change it forever, forcing it to develop a large and permanently deployed armed forces, which would then be used to create a world empire.<br />And so here we are today...
B00008OWZC|5.0|Although I have only been a fan of Led Zeppelin since May 9, 2003, when a friend introduced me to the band in his car CD player, I have to say that this band is amazing.  After purchasing this CD, I cannot stop listening to it.  Everywhere I go I have a Zeppelin song stuck in my head.  From an incredibly hard-driving rendition of Immigrant Song to a great version of Bron-Yr-Aur Stomp to a mind-bending Stairway to Heaven, every song on this 3 CD set is Led Zeppelin at their best.  And, unlike basically every live album, How the West Was Won actually has Zeppelin sounding better than on their studio albums.  To sum it all up, it doesn't matter if you have been a Led Zeppelin fan since their creation, a new fan like myself, or someone who has never heard them play before, pick up How the West Was Won.  You'll never get sick of it.  It's without a doubt the greatest album I've ever listened to.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|I just picked up this new release from Neil, and I gotta tell ya, it is simply incredible!  First of all, this studio disc is accompanied by a DVD of Neil performing the entire album solo acoustic in Ireland from May 2003.  While the video quality on the DVD is so-so, the sound is stellar, and Neil's playing has never been better.  The DVD is nearly 90 minutes by itself, and is worth the cost of the release alone.  Neil's commentary between songs lends insight into this zany concept album.  <br />The studio release features Neil getting electric with Crazy Horse.  It's a whole different feel than the DVD, but the acoustic &amp; electric performances of Greendale only serve to bolster each other.  Don't hesitate another moment.  Order this album right away.  You will not be sorry.  It's one of the best albums of 2003.
B0000A02TZ|1.0|I am returning this DVD tomorrow.  I refuse to sit through 5 minutes of previews everytime I want to watch the movie I paid for.  I own hundreds of DVDs and this is the first that forced me to watch anything other than the annoying FBI Warning.  Send a message.  Don't buy this DVD.  Don't let this start a trend.  At least with VHS you could fast forward.
B0000A02TZ|1.0|Nothing makes me angrier than a DVD packed full of up-front previews that you can't skip or menu-out of. That is just abusive marketing on Universal's part, in my opinion, and it ruins the experience of an otherwise fine movie. I actually thought my remote control was broken. So it gets only 1 star and I will demand that the store take it back even though I opened it.
B00005OAIE|4.0|This CD is really closer to 3.5 stars for me. I was feeling generous and rounded up. <BR>I love the singles &quot;No Such Thing&quot;, &quot;Why Georgia&quot;, and &quot;Your Body is a Wonderland&quot;. The rest of the album is largely more of the same, but not quite as good. Some of the lyrics are just plain silly. &quot;Your love is like neon&quot;? I mean really...<BR>Overall, the album lacks depth. It's not bad for fluff though.
B0000A02U2|1.0|Nothing makes me angrier than a DVD packed full of up-front previews that you can't skip or menu-out of.

B00005YW4H|5.0|I was scared when I bought this CD because I had only heard &quot;Don't Know Why&quot;. The CD is great! I like it so much that I would be hard pressed to pick a favorite song. They are all so good. I think her cover of &quot;Cold Cold Heart&quot; might be my favorite though. &quot;The Nearness of You&quot; is also amazing.<BR>A friend told me she wished there was at least one upbeat song on the disc. I don't. Norah creates and sustains a mood perfectly.<BR>This CD is also great for getting a fussy baby to sleep.
B000001FW9|5.0|I love what Gentle Giant wrote on the inside of their second album, 1971's &quot;Acquiring The Taste&quot;: &quot;It is our goal to expand the frontiers of contemporary popular music at the risk of being very unpopular.&quot; That pretty much sums up this daring British band, never achieving big commercial success in their 10 years together but not really caring either, as long as they made great music, and on their own terms. And they did. &quot;Acquiring The Taste&quot; is one of Gentle Giant's finest efforts, a superb prog-rock disc. My personal favorites: &quot;Pantagruel's Nativity&quot; is a stunning piece, with the band mixing classical, folk, rock, mellotron, and operatic vocals into a supreme musical blend. The title track is a brief but very-cool Moog synthesiser instrumental, courtesy of keyboardist Kerry Minnear. &quot;Wreck&quot; is a great rocker. &quot;Black Cat&quot; is one of my all-time favorite GG songs, a spooky little number with excellent string decorations throughout, and the 7 1/2 minute &quot;Plain Truth&quot; is another favorite Gentle Giant staple. The band's boldness, musicianship, and studio experimentation is mighty impressive on this album. &quot;Acquiring The Taste&quot; is another terrific prog-rock offering from the terrific Gentle Giant.
B00000IMYA|5.0|There is no point to adding to the already brilliant comments - especially from Messrs. Dorwell and Chell. I have the &quot;Duke Ellington and The Buck Clayton All-Stars At Newport&quot; LP, and the '56 Reissue as well on CD...but what I really would like to see is the Clayton stuff reissued! Man, he and Coleman were smooth and swingin' that night. Sometimes I think that set gets lost in the whole 56 Newport-Ellington mania. Just an opinion from a fan of great traditional jazz.
B000089CJI|5.0|I bought this album a few weeks ago and have been completely under it's hypnotic spell since it's first spin in my cd player. As someone who is a self proclaimed &quot;rare fan of male vocal bands&quot; I was incredibly surprised at how much I love this album. The music is like a weaving of alternative, synth pop and electronica all rolled into one incredible musical breakthrough.<br />The song that has captured my heart that fastest would have to be THE DISTRICT SLEEPS ALONE TONIGHT, which is also the albums opener. This song is such an emotianally charged song! The way it starts out hauntingly paced and ends up charging on electronically in a happier almost danceable sense. This song is beautiful! The song RECYCLED AIR is also another amazing song...It is probably one of the most subtly brilliant tunes I have heard in a while. I love the usage of orchestration in the background of this one and the catchy &quot;ba ba ba ba&quot; chorus lines. Sleeping In is another frequently listened to song from this cd...There is something about this song that just makes me happy! Overall, this album is an amazing breakthrough in the music world. This album is virutally flawless! I would reccomend it to everyone but seeing that there are a lot of people out there with terrible musical taste who would probably listen to a boy band or some other terrible type of music that has no substance or true quality to it...I will reccomend this to fans of synth pop, radiohead, any type of vocal lead electronica and  pop styled alternative music. Check this gem of an album out NOW!!
B000002UAU|5.0|This album transfigures The Beatles into the mystical &quot;Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.&quot; The transcendental influence of the Time and the Scene and the sitar and the classical orchestration continue their quest of the unknown and help shape this conflagration of ideas into one sound and worthy attempt at enlightenment of the human experience. Sgt. Pepper's is a &quot;must have&quot; in anyone's collection of Rock 'n Roll, a nice little fire to warm up to. The Beatles are one of the great artists of my generation and this album is a great adventure, like a flight to the moon. And then again I'm assuming you know of and have heard The Beatles. If so, you probably already have it. But if not, as they said next on Magical Mystery Tour, &quot;Your Mother Should Know&quot;, or maybe your grandmother by now. You could ask somebody, or you could just get the album yourself. On &quot;A Day In The Life&quot; imagine yourself blasting off to new worlds.
B00009V7PJ|5.0|I just received this DVD this week, and watched it last night. OMG - I thought I was at the concert again!  The quality of the production and crispness of this DVD is incredible.  By the end of the DVD, my surround sound system was cranked.  And there is plenty of bonus videos, monologues, and info to keep you entertained for quite some time.  This is by far my most favorite DVD ever.  If you enjoyed Cher's concert or didn't go but love her music, this DVD IS A MUST.  Period.  Spend the [$], you'll be glad you did.
B000002A3T|5.0|When I first heard this album I was shocked and aghast at what Floyd appeared to have become after the departure of Waters. <BR>But a few more hearings left me pleasantly surprised . And today I am prepared to put it among their very best albums , second to only The Wall . There is no track on the album that is even remotely weak . <BR>The album  though , is clearly a depature from Floyd's earlier style .
B00008X5J3|5.0|I confess.  I love this movie.  I loved it so much when it was in the theaters, I went to see it six times.  &lt;g>  I'm a theater buff, and I've seen the stage show Chicago twice in New York -- once with Bebe Neuwirth in the title role and once with Marilou Henner.  Both actresses were terrific, but I honestly believe the movie is better than the stage version, and Zellweger and Zeta-Jones are phenomenal.  Richard Gere, too, was a wonderful surprise.  Contrary to what one reviewer said, I found his voice to be perfect for this role.  Billy is not supposed to be a fabulous performer.  He's a con man, he tap dances around the truth, everything is flash.  So Gere's NY nasal singing voice is perfect for this character.  Ditto with Zellweger.  One reviewer complained about how thin her voice is.  Hey, Roxie is a wannabe, not a star.  Zeta-Jones is the star who is supposed to be fabulous (and she is).  Roxie is the pretender.  So Zellweger's less-than-perfect voice is perfect for the role.<br />I wish there were more than five stars to award this movie.  I'd give it a TEN!
B00008H2LB|5.0|Linkin Park has done a great job with this one.  They said they sound like nsync.  PSYCE.  Heres a real music fan that has the real scoop on this album. so listen up<br />Foreward-not a song 0/0<BR>Dont Stay-  kind of like one step closer only heavier (if it is possible)  10/10<br />Somewhere I Belong- the single.  pretty good one.  not as good as one step closer though.  not that heavy. nice acoustic gutair 8/10<br />Lying My Way From You-  Great intro.  perfect for bouncing in the car.  Nice rapping.  Not original 9/10<br />Hit the Floor-  Diffently a standout. not like any others heavy. kind of like myself only heavier and different beat 10/10<br />Easier to Run-  Standout.  Love the gutair that is like the deftones minerva.  soft. but awesome 10/10<br />Faint-Second single  love it. maybe the best song on the album. cant decide whethter it is better than from the inside.  100/10<br />Figure .09- lovin it. chillin wit it.  like the riffs. and chorus. but not an original 9.9/10<br />Breaking the Habit-  I am sorry but everyone likes this song but me. jk. itz ok. very slow.  What is this song about though itz almost like quitting smoking.  7.5/10<br />From The Inside-  Cant decide if it is better than faint or not.  Love the chorus and rapping.  Great job guys.  100/10<br />Nobody's listening- STANDOUT kind of like High Voltage is jappenese instruments and chester in it.  good song 8/10<br />Session-not as good as cure for the itch. if shinonda had busted out a flow in it. It would have been great. 6/10<br />Numb- completely copies pushing me away. i am sorry but everyone with the other cd will notice.  still a great song though 9/10<br />look uall dont listen to the other ppl that say it sux when it doesnt. it is one of the best cds of all time.  so buy this cd worth every penny
B00009APK1|5.0|The Lord of the Rings has come back to our screens again and it is definetly better than the first. The film is better on the small screen because you can pause it and have a break whenever you like. The is very long so I usually pause it half way through and come back to it later. The battle of helms deep is beautifully done, proberly the best battle scene ever on the big screen. The characters develop more and the quest becomes harder. For Frodo the ring is beginning to take control of him. For Aragorn he is beginning to relise what he must do. After the dissapointment of Star Wars and The Matrix Reloaded it is good to see a sequel go right
1400031362|5.0|Mma Makutsi rises to her own in this volume of &quot;The No. 1 Ladies' Detective&quot; series books.  As Mma Ramtoswe feels the pinch economically and emotionally, what with moneys tight in the agency and the illness of her fiance, Mr. J. L. B. Matekoni,she comes to rely on the unexpected talents and strength of her secretary.  Mma Makutsi, with her too dark complexion and too big glasses, a less than &quot;beautiful&quot; specimen, shows true beauty in her no nonsense approach to taking on the business managerial load of Tolkweng Road Speedy Motors and its &quot;lazy, girl crazy apprentices&quot;, as well as landing a big paying client for the detective agency.  Mma Ramotswe doesn't exactly take the back seat, but as she wrestles with the case of depression of her normally steady and reliable Motekoni, she is able to see her secretary's best qualities.  In fact, I found the very modern issue of medical depression quite fascinating, along with Mma Ramotswe's recognition of the need to read about it, and get help from the other strong woman in the series, Mma Potokwane, the director of the children's orphanage who relies on Rra Matekoni for help.<br />This volume of the series was very touching to me, as Precious Ramotswe takes on the case of an obnoxious Governmental Official who wants his own family investigated.  Her wisdom in using the cultural courtesies of Botswana to interview the would be &quot;culprits&quot; and find a solution are just good sense.  Her strength of character reinforces the issue of morality in the story.<br />Most amusing of all is the big money customer that Mma Makutsi obtains who requires  a quick investigation into the character of four Miss Beauty and Integrity of Botswana candidates, a rush job with an unusual need and surprising resolution.<br />Best of all, Mma Makutsi shines in her managerial skills with the mechanics and customers of Speedy Motors, more than succeeding in bringing things in line for the ill owner and his intended bride.  Her personal joy in receiving the opportunity to succeed in the business world makes her unusal character round out into a fully amusing and &quot;beautiful&quot; woman.<br />Mr. J. L. B.'s recuperative visit to the orphanage and connection with a wild child there further enrich his gentleman's character.<br />This is a reassuringly enjoyable read.  A comfort and joy for the fans of Alexander McCall Smith's series.
B000002MJC|1.0|This is not one of Depeche Mode's better albums.  I am not too familair with the details of the band's members but I know they have gone through many hardships and substance abuse and maybe this is a culmination of all thier pain and torment packaged for our listening pleasure!  Regardless, I don't know what stance or opinion this album is taking on religion probably beacuse I couldn't listen to it enough to form an understanding.<br />I Feel You starts off okay with classic Depeche Mode but the album pretty much goes downhill from there.  Slow, boring, vocal preachy songs without the usual synthesisers and beats that you find with classic Depeche Mode.<br />Bottom Line:  Blah...Non Depeche mode fans have no reason to go near this with a ten foot pole.  People interested in the band should start try Violoator or 101.
0375758992|3.0|It was interesting to read a book about life in Africa, from the perspective of a white woman brought up in a family who clung fiercely to the notion of white supremacy with every last bit of their strength. I disagree with a previous reviewer, however, who seemed to excuse the racism of the Fuller parents by implying that the historic and political situation they were in \\"made\\" them that way. Racism is racism, no matter what the circumstance.<BR> <BR>Despite the attitudes of the Fuller parents, their daughter Bobo has documented a well-written account of their life in various African countries, and provides vivid details about the smells, sights, and emotions that the continent evokes for her. Her writing really gives the reader a sense of both the incredible harshness and danger(poisonous snakes, itchy vegetation, scary militaristic governments, etc) of Africa, but also its gentleness and great beauty.<br />Although I think Alexandra Fuller writes very well, and I appreciate her honest writing about her parents' behavior and attitudes, I couldn't warm to the family. Despite their numerous trajedies and troubles, I found it difficult to feel sympathetic. In contrast, when I read \\"The Flame Trees of Thika\\", another memoir of an African childhood by another white woman, Elspeth Huxley, I rooted for her colonial, turn-of-the-century, white-is-right parents, Robin and Tilly, through all their successes and setbacks. They held the same attitude of racial superiority as the Fullers, yet there is something intrinsically more likeable about how they handled themselves on a continent where they were the minority race, political upheaval or no. After reading Fuller's memoir, it was a relief to pick up \\"Nervous Conditions\\" by black female Zimbabwean Tsitsi Dangarembga, and read about three-dimensional black Africans. Her book is set in 1960s Rhodesia, for those interested (A. Fuller recommends it herself in the Afterword section of her memoir). Despite my personal reaction tothis book, I recommend it to anyone interested in African writing, because I think that Alexandra Fuller's perspective is just as important and valid as that of any other African writer.
B00007ELEL|4.0|this is a great comidy, but im still not sure i intirely understand the plot. oh well. very funny movie. that you might want to watch some time.
B00005JKZV|5.0|I have read all his works, the LOTR  probably over 30 times and the posthumous literature. Yes Peter Jackson made changes, some we argue about, but nevertheless the movies are the most incredible, awe inspiring and beautifully crafted cinemetic experience I have had.  I was still tense at Helm's Deep, even though I new what would happen, I still felt for Gollum and Arwen. True magic to make me care even when I knew what would happen!<BR>Star Wars notwithstanding. PJ and his crew sweated blood and tears for nearly 4 years to make this, and did far better than a typical US Hollywood director. <BR>Thank God that New Line Cinema had the guts to make 3 movies, we are lucky that a crew that loved the book made it, not a crew that had no personal interest.<BR>The special extended edition looks like it will top even the 2 towers.<BR>Sean Astins litte movie is a nice little touch.<BR>Andy Serkis deserves more credit - I mean flopping around in freezing cold water for  4 takes.<br />Buy it and you'll not regret it.
B00003CXBK|5.0|i havent seen to many animes but i know that this one is GREAT! i think that every anime collecter should have this.  probably my favorite anime. if u know anything about anime u will like this.
B00006JJ1O|1.0|Ok, ok their music can be ok e.g. All the things she said. But the track \\"not gonna get us\\" is so stupid and requires not talent. Plus those girls are not even lesbians, so please don't get this just because you think their lebians because their not. I feel sorry for the lesbians who bought this because they thought they where lesbians. Ontop of that their music is played on radio mtv all the time so its not like you don't hear them much. And yes the only avg song by them is \\"all the things she said\\", rest is [garbage].
B00006L7XQ|5.0|I don't understand how people could criticize this record when you obviously don't respect the man, Johnny Cash. He is nearing the end of his life so do you really think he'll sing in perfect pitch and tone. This record shows an even darker side to the man in black that makes you want to sit down and listen to it again and again. I think the song &quot;Hurt&quot; is far better than the original and the cover of the Beatles song &quot;In My Life&quot; is excellent. Keep going Johnny, you're at the top of american musicians!!!!!
B00007LTIA|4.0|Tales From Topographic Oceans, one of the most highly controversial albums (becasue everything is so LONG!) released. Even though I've had this album for a long time, I still haven't been able to digest all of it (I've listented to it plenty of times, but...). This is a true love-it-or-hate-it album. I recommend it for a notch above the casual Yes fan. I gave it 4 stars because, it's so long!! AHHH

This is my favorite track. I love this beat. The lyrics are nasty but this the best song. The second verse is the best. 10.0<br />Overall..... BUY THE CD.
B000002J1H|5.0|There is not one track on this album that fails to please. \\"Going For The One\\" is funky mix between funk/country/prog/rock. It's really ingenious! Also, another classic is \\"Wonderous Stories.\\" A great soft/acoutsic song. A similar song would be \\"Turn Of The Century.\\" Both have great arrangements. There is the song \\"Paralells,\\" which is (IMO) one of the coolest songs written by Yes. It has a nice bass guitar part, and Rick Wakeman really jams out on the pipe organ! I chuckled halfway through the song when Mr. Wakeman broke out into (what I think) a pipe organ solo. The last song is 'Awawken,' which, in my opinion, has to be one of the greatest songs ever written by Yes. You'll just have to hear it to believe it. This album is a must for ANYONE! not just Yes fans.
B000003TAB|5.0|This one and Bleach are their best, without a doubt. You get the pure, unadalterated, freakish, garbage-pail-garage-pop that as millions of fans have discovered in the last decaded-and-a-half, is like communing with the music of the spheres--as the band's name always implied. They were and are, among the very best that rock has to offer. <BR>Buy this cd now and blast it as loud as possible at bus stops, on the bus, in your car, on the street, and everywhere--cut through and defy the denser spheres of rap and groin-grinding booming bass and keep melody--fused with distorted guitars and soul--alive!!!!
B00007LTIB|5.0|\\"Relayer\\" originally had 3 songs, but the Rhino reissues added extra stuff. That is cool, but the original stuff is SWEET!!! \\"The Gates of Delirium\\"...how do I even start talking about it?!?!?!?! It just combines so many different styles, sounds and techniques, I don't see why it's not a well-known classic! (Also, if you pay attention/read along with the lyrics, it is rather comical what the lyrics are talking about and the manner in which they are sung :-)...) Next, there is Sound Chaser. I..have...never heard...such guitar work in my life!!! Steve Howe is just pulling off some inhuman stuff here! And for the bass guitar, Chris Squire is pulling next to or passing some of the stuff done by Geddy Lee! <--Rush. The guitar is just speed, speed and then followed by the IMMORTAL guitar solo and more 1600th notes and so on. It is truly an amazing song! Awaken is pretty cool. It's a tad on the softer side, but nonetheless a classic! I highly recommend this to any fan of Prog-Rock. Nonetheless, Yes!
0446310786|5.0|I was assigned to read this book over the summer for my freshman year of high school. At first I was apprehensive, school books never seemed to be enjoyable and I was sure that this one would be just like the rest. However as I began to venture further into the story I began to realize that this wasn't like &quot;all the other school books.&quot;<br />By the time I had finished the book I was sure this would forever be one of my favorites. <br />I have yet to see the movie but anxiously await to in the very near future. <br />I recommend this book to everyone and anyone. It's a incredible novel.
B000001ESJ|4.0|Often only known for sporting the song \\"Closer To The Heart,\\" there are plenty of other classics in here too! \\"A Farewell To Kings\\" is an excellent song (from what I've found) talking about all the political criminals or whatever you want to call them and bad stuff (just listen to it). \\"Xanadu\\" is probably my favourite song on the album. It is based on the poem \\"Khubla Khan\\" by some guy, I forgot his name. It is definatly a prog classic! I like all the little birdie sounds! You can skip out on \\"Madrigal\\" and \\"Cinderella Man.\\" Finally, here is part 1 of 2: Cygnus X-1 Book I: The Voyage.\\" This song is one of Rush's BEST! It's about this guy on his spaceship \\"Rocinante,\\" sailing into Cygnus X-1, an unknown black hole thingy. The end is a cliffhanger and I will leave it at that...If you don't chills down your spine with Cygnus X-1, YOU ARE NOT PLAYING IT LOUD ENOUGH!! I recomennd this with \\"Hemispheres.\\"
B00005A46T|1.0|Why is it nowadays that all the bands, of which have no artistic ability in the metal genre recieve all the metal awards and the media which other bands observe? Why is it that screaming into a microphone till you puke makes you an artist? Well Slipknot is a very very very, unartistic and very pointless band. They combine Rap and Rock (what an original idea, maybe Korn should try it) into a very horrible noise that offends the brain and hurts the ears. <BR> Slipknot are less known for the music they create, but are better known for the image they create. 9 messed up kids from Iowa in clown masks and jumpsuits who stretch the limits of profanity.<BR> They are better known for their Parental Advisory label than the albums that carry this sticker that they parade like an award. Many people say they combine all sorts of elements of metal into one style, but I say it is music at its worst. It is my personal opinion and fact that slipknot should not be allowed to make any more albums, and should apologize publicly for making us waste our money.
B000001ESN|5.0|Okay, the Prog years of Rush are over now with Permanent Waves, but it doesn't fail to please! The best known tracks &quot;The Spirit of Radio&quot; and &quot;Freewill&quot; are here. But what about the OTHER good stuff?! It's hard to describe &quot;Jacob's Ladder.&quot; Whatever it is, it's FREAKIN' AWESOME! &quot;Entre Nous&quot; and &quot;Different Strings&quot; are cool too. Probably one of the last prog songs by Rush is here. &quot;Natural Science&quot; is a 3 movement piece (IMHO), about their philosiphy on life. I don't know if it is, but whatever it is, it's SWEET!!! This is a must for anyone coming into Rush, or a diehard fan! (chances are you already have it...)

Featuring the classic Yes lineup, this album doesn't fail to please. It's great music and not TOO long (like TFTO) and is just fun! I don't care if  you are a Yes fan or not, this album is for anyone!

B0000057C5|4.0|There is not much to say about Rammstein except the fact that they are so cool! Even though like 90% of their songs are of a....questionable nature (incest, rape, killing, homosexual practises), it's still cool! Sehnsuct, Du Hast, Speil Mit Mir are some of the best. The way the singer sings is funny and interesting due to all those funky German pronunciations! The guitar is nice and heavy and along with the keyboards, it sounds like it could be heavy techno/dance music but it still boils down to good ol' heavy metal! At certain points, you will just have to smile and chuckle, just because it's all in German.
B00005JKN9|3.0|This film shows the violence which was prevalent in New York in the mid-1800's.  &quot;Native&quot; Americans are pitted against the immigrant Irish and men being drafted into the Union army rebel against joining a war that they care little about.  There is plenty of fighting and plenty of blood.  The conflicts are personified by Leonardo DiCaprio who swears vengeance on the man who killed his father when he was a young boy and left him to be brought up in an orphanage.  As a grown man he seemingly joins the man they call The Butcher, while plotting his death.  Cameron Diaz is the love interest who leaves The Butcher to join DiCaprio.  This is a dark film, both visually and content-wise and it will probably not be taken as seriously by viewers as the film-makers might wish.

0451169514|5.0|In my personal opinion, It is better than any other American work of fiction.  It has terror, some (weird) humor, action, and enough BULK to keep your attention for quite a long time.<br />Like with most books, you cannot simply read a review and make a judgement.  You have to pick it up and read a few pages.<br />Overall, I would say it is right up there with &quot;The Stand&quot; as King's best work.
B0000A02TZ|4.0|John Landis rounds up most of the key surviving cast members for a where-are-they-now? mockumentary. Boon, Katy, Otter, Flounder, D-Day and Hoover all show up. The director and his middle-age actors give it the old college try, but the result is about as vibrant as a long-in-the-tooth class reunion. &quot;Animal House&quot; didn't have a single boring minute -- here you get 23 of them.<br />Mockumentary aside, this DVD will be required viewing for everyone who loves this film -- which is just about everyone. The uninitiated must wear beanies until the big homecoming scene.<br />The disc replaces a raggedy DVD from the early days of the format that dispensed wobbly sound and dark, grainy video. The new disc's images range from OK to quite good, while the audio, upgraded from mono to Dolby 5.1, adds punch to the comedy and grace to Elmer Bernstein's straight-faced score. The film is presented in its original 1.85:1 aspect ratio, with the enhancement for 16x9 monitors. (Universal bills the new picture quality and audio as better than on the original theatrical release.)<br />The 1998 DVD's sole virtue was a real documentary, &quot;The Yearbook: An Animal House Reunion,&quot; in which the producers, writers, director and actors told many of the great stories behind the production. Fortunately, Joseph J.M. Kenny's engaging and fast-moving docu resurfaces on the new disc, running 45 minutes. For extra credit, the new DVD sports popup trivia that doesn't seem to pop up nearly enough.<br />Alas, on the DVD, Universal kicks off this classic film with some visual spam: A handful of ads for upcoming videos that can't be chapter-bypassed. Repeat viewers, beware.

0451457994|5.0|Arthur C. Clarke's monumental novel 2001: A Space Odyssey is top-notch science fiction that more than earns its spot among the greatest works published in the genre.  Reading the novel is quite a different experience from watching Stanley Kubrick's wildly famous movie adaptation of the story.  The movie is far too abstract and vague for my tastes, concentrating more on visual wonders than sound plot development.  Many of the questions left unanswered in the movie (along with some questions and answers the movie never even addressed) can be found in the novel, and this made for a much more rewarding and satisfying 2001 experience for me.  Moviegoers had to wait sixteen years to learn the real story of Hal's failure, but Clarke explains it (and in more detail) in the pages of his original 2001 novel.  There are actually a surprising number of differences between the novel and the film, which strikes me as somewhat strange given the fact that the book was inspired by the idea of the film; as a matter of fact, much of the writing took place during the film's production, and Clarke has said that some movie shots led him to make changes to the novel as he was writing it.<br />The story begins in the ancient past, providing much more detail about the appearance of a huge black monolith on earth and its deliberative interference with the man-apes of the area. The film fails to convey the overwhelming impact of the alien monolith on the evolution of life on earth, and that is one important reason why I find the film too vague. The events of Clarke's first few chapters are of great importance in one's understanding of the story, and all the facts become clear in this book.  One will also find some major differences between the novel and the movie in terms of the setting of the final events.  In the novel, the crucial mission goes to Saturn, whereas the movie takes us no farther than Jupiter; this doesn't change anything really, but Clarke has said that Kubrick made the right decision and saved him some embarrassment from making a visual representation of Saturn that later failed to hold up to more recent scientific discoveries about the ringed planet.<br />Many of the crucial events onboard the Saturn-bound spaceship Discovery also differ significantly between book and movie.  Clarke's exposition of the growing doubts expressed by Captains Poole and Bowman over the performance of the onboard supercomputer Hal works much better than Kubrick's lip reading explication, and there is a lot more information provided here about the whys and wherefores of Hal's troubling and duplicitous actions.  The pivotal events of Hal's takeover of the ship play much better in the book as well, and the events as described here are actually much more exciting and convincing than the events you see in the film.  The novel concludes with a much more revealing look at Bowman's journey beyond Saturn into infinity.  Here, Clarke even goes into some detail about the creators of the monoliths, which is a topic the movie never really addresses at all.<br />In the end, the novel is just much more compelling than the film, and for that reason I would recommend watching the movie before reading the book.  Kubrick intentionally left his film rather vague and open-ended, and a reading of the much more compelling and informative novel may well rob you of whatever small joys you might otherwise find in the film.  In the same vein, the paucity of answers in the movie does little to detract from one's enjoyment of and fascination with the novel.t decision and saved him some embarrassment from making a visual representation of Saturn that later failed to hold up to more recent scientific discoveries about the ringed planet.  <br />Many of the crucial events onboard the Saturn-bound spaceship Discovery also differ significantly between book and movie.

080013558X|4.0|If you saw the original Broadway musical (I'm talkin' with McArdle), I could understand your disappointment with the movie....<br />Perhaps you even listened to the soundtrack first, then went to the movie...I could understand your &quot;disappointment.&quot;<br />BUT  (and there is a but...) I first heard the soundtrack from the Broadway musical - then I listened to it over and OVER again on my adolescent cassette recorder - and I went to the movie as a teen.<br />I must admit, after listening to McArdle sing, there is no comparison - do you REMEMBER she was the biggest child star of the late 70's?<br />Anyway, Carol B. is the BEST in the movie.  Quinn could be the only other to play the roll of Annie - and, enough said, I ENJOYED the movie for what it was ------ NOT the musical, mind you, but a GREAT movie in and of itself.<br />Don't watch it thinking it's going to do the musical justice. Don't go to the musical (as if you could?) thinking it will do the film justice.<br />Both/Either are good! Don't let anyone tell you otherwise!
B00003CXSM|5.0|I didn't know they made movies like this any more.  Totally enjoyable.  Great characters.  Really good acting.  Jennifer Lopez is wonderful; so is Matthew Mc--let's see more leading man roles for him; casting is excellent and directing is superb.  The script is charmingly written. I've seen it ten times.  <BR> The DVD I bought would not fill the tv screen

B00005JLSE|5.0|For those who have expressed here that CHICAGO was trash, undeserving of its Academy Awards, etc., I'm admitting confusion about your remarks. I saw MOULIN ROUGE. For the record, I do like Nicole Kidman, but found MOULIN ROUGE worse than almost any other modern day (post-60s.) film/musical made. For those who thought that CHICAGO was cynical, dark, unfunny, etc. Have you never seen a Bob Fosse production, including the biographical ALL THAT JAZZ (in which CHICAGO is a focus)? You can tell a Bob Fosse musical by certain trademarks...Compare CHICAGO to CABARET. The two are similar in tone, era, fashion and yes, cynicism--and they're both Fosse creations in terms of choreography and such. CHICAGO isn't even in the same class with MOULIN ROUGE, which was in my humble opinion, boring and annoying (and ruined a few classic songs like Elton John's \\"Your Song.\\") Because I'm married to an Academy Awards buff, and am a former film critic for a newspaper, I decided to watch MOULIN ROUGE. To me it was a waste of time, talent and yet another remake/reworking of CAMILLE (this version completely overblown.) Kidman has been in much better films than MOULIN ROUGE. As for Zellweger, I'm not a big fan of hers either, and she and Richard Gere are probably the weakest links in CHICAGO in terms of their musical abilities (despite Gere having been in a stage production of GREASE years ago,) but I think it sort of colors one's judgement when you go into a movie already hating an actor in a starring role as one reviewer wrote. You've already pre-judged the whole movie. I'm not a fan of musicals overall, but I'll give many of them a try. I also tend to not watch movies starring actors I don't particularly like (especially since I left my work as a film critic years ago and can avoid watching actors I don't like.) I really liked CHICAGO and was happy it won Best Picture. Bob Fosse hopefully is smiling in the Afterlife.
B00003BDXG|1.0|I don't care what kind of social or political statement this movie was trying to make, it was just plain stupid. It was all I could do to sit through it until the end. I couldn't even have an opinion about the violence or whatever statement it was trying to make because I couldn't get past how STUPID it was. And Robert Downey, Jr.'s character was insanely annoying. This is by far one of the very worst movies I have ever seen.
B0000640S3|2.0|Its funny to think that Rambo's buddies in this movie are the same people responsible for 911, well, maybe more sad than funny.. <br />Stallone mumbles his way between action scenes; taking his bow and arrows to Afganistan in search of his mentor who has been taken hostage by the evil Soviets. Stuff does blow up real good.<br />This movie is simplistic and cartoonish but it is entertaining; just like today's American foriegn policy.
B0000AOV85|5.0|If you're a Floyd fan or just an interested music fan, this documentary is phenominal.  Each Floyd member gives their own insight into each track (except one) of the album.  Rare live recordings and footage as well as in-depth mixing board sessions with Alan Parsons and David Gilmour round out the mix.  It's great to see the band talk so positively about their work.  Even long-time fans and collectors will find some new stuff here!
B00009RDG9|4.0|This is a chase movie at its core but Friedkin's use of silence and the pensive demeanors of the two main characters gives The Hunted a unique type of atmosphere. There is alot of graphic violence, especially in the beginning of the film. It is displayed in a matter-of-fact style which adds more tension to the film's atmosphere.

0140277447|1.0|As one reviewer said, a picture is worth a thousand words. One of the most moving pictures in this book is of soldiers using a hay cutter to behead a prisoner; Japanese soldiers in Nanking, author Iris Chang tells us. However, the uniforms on these soldiers are clearly Chinese Nationalist uniforms. Is this the innocent mistake of a researcher who has failed to study her subject even enough to recognize a Japanese soldier, or is it, more worryingly, part of a deliberate attempt to mislead? She shows a gruesome photograph of a row of severed heads that she claims to have been taken in Nanking in 1937; Susumu Sato, however, claims to own an original of that picture, bought in 1931. His copy has affixed a printed title that says gheads of bandits shot in Tielingh (Manchuria) by soldiers of warlord Zhang Xueling. A picture of a man (in a jacket never worn by Japanese soldiers) about to behead a victim appears suspect since his shadow faces in the opposite direction from the man standing beside him, suggesting the picture may well have been tampered with. <br />The contemporary gDocuments of the Nanking Safety Zoneh appear to be a valuable source of information from Westerners in Nanking; did Iris Chang ignore them because they disagree with many of her assertions, or did she merely not know they exist? A historian should tell us what she can prove and what she cannot, and what is disputed. This, however, is not history, but tabloid journalism of the very worst kind. She got her bestseller, but do the ends justify the means?
B0000AI44Q|5.0|Greendale is no ordinary collection of music. You will never here it on commercial radio, maybe a college album station or two. It is the best and freshest sound that I have heard in 20 years. From its reverberating strings to the old sound drum kit with plenty of use of the cymbal it after two passes from start to finish will have you agreeing that NY's poetry and truth is stronger than any you have heard before.  If you are a Neil Young fan  don't be looking for Cinnamon Girl and Down by the River.
B00004TH6O|5.0|Rated R succeds by bringing a kind of simplicity, honesty, and passion to rock without making any sacrifices. It is experimental while still using down-to-earth, soulful rock that can give you a grateful dead type high.<br />By letting their passion for music drive the creativity of the album instead of gimicks, they created a truthful image of how we all want life and rock to be: uncompromising, wild, full of energy, full of soul.<br />And while its merits may not be available immediately to the casual listener, if given the proper opportunity it will open the door to a new type of rock that up until very recently has been un-noticed by the mainstream.
B00008LDPU|2.0|This DVD consists of short anime clips that are joined together.<br />It scores well on artistic content and quality of anime.<br />What it fails badly in is the storyline.<br />Viewers are given a sneak peek into a little bit of this and that, without much of a storyline to join it all up.<br />Seperately, there is also a short clip on a teenage boy committing suicide in the belief that it will get him out of the matrix. I find this disturbing. Whether this will inspire copycats can lead to an endless tirade. I certainly will not be letting any impressionable kid watch this.<br />As with the 2nd installment of the matrix, this comes across as quite a disappointment.

B00003CX8U|1.0|I loved Chicago and can see why it was the best film of the year.  I thought I would like \\"All That Jazz\\" too but it really stunk.  I hated the plot.  The dance numbers were nice but it was a total waste of my ...for the DVD.  Just my $.02.
B000056JYC|5.0|Over 25 years since its original release in 1976, Peter Frampton's live masterpiece &quot;Frampton Comes Alive!&quot; is still one of the best live albums of the 70s and remains the biggest selling live recording to this day. To commemorate the 25th anniversary of this classic album, A&amp;M released an expanded deluxe version with an expanded booklet and four additional tracks bringing to album's running time to nearly two hours.<br />This album still never fails to please. From the Frampton standards &quot;Show Me The Way&quot; and &quot;Baby I love Your Way&quot; to the extended jams of &quot;Lines On My Face&quot;, &quot;I Wanna Go To The Sun&quot; and the ultimate talkbox-guitar opus &quot;Do You Feel Like We Do?&quot;, this album shows Peter Frampton in all his glory. Besides being a gifted songwriter and singer, Frampton's guitar work is up there with the greats. It's unfortunate that his guitar playing doesn't get as much recognition as his other two great talents.<br />The additional material on the expanded edition includes three additional live pieces as well as an unreleased studio track entitled &quot;Day's Dawning&quot;.<br />What else can I say, &quot;Frampton Comes Alive!&quot; still sounds as fresh and exciting as it did back in the day. This is classic arena rock the way it's meant to be done. Check it out and relive the the glory days.
B00000I8UF|4.0|I was a little disappointed in this one because my expectations were so high; i had read so many good things about this album and knew it was considered a hard bop classic. The first cut comes out swinging with a fantastic solo by morgan then surprisingly things become a little more sedate. All the rest of the cuts are solid with heavy expressions of blues and soul but nothing else seems to really grab me or overwelm me. I like it a lot but admittedly i never find myself feeling compelled to reach for this CD any more than others in my hard bop collection.<br />In some ways this reminds me of blue mitchell's &quot;out of the blue&quot; which isn't surprising since blakely and golson also perform on that album which was recorded just 2 months later. Persoanlly i like golson's contribution on blue's album more though his tenor solos are impressive here. This album could have also used wynton kelly since timmon's work doesn't seem up to par with the rest of the band. <br />A solid effort suitable for all hard bop fans and especially fans of great trumpet and drums. Not essential in my opinion.<br />...........socks
0380789035|1.0|As a teacher I should have known better but my impulse to buy and read got the better of me. I have to agree with a previous reviewer who said the writing is clumsy and the characters are skeletel, ie 1 dimensional. Scenes were thrown together nonsensically at times. Gaiman adds 2 sex scenes to the book just so they are there - they add no value and serve no purpose to the story whatsowever. I guess they are meant to shock. Without those two scenes however the book might have been approriate reading for my middle school readers - it is written at that level.

6305291446|5.0|I loved this movie and everyone other Halloween movie that I have seen. I have seen parts of Halloween 3: Season Of The Witch and from what I can tell it seemed pretty stupid. I hate the fact the nobody really likes Michael anymore, I mean he started the horror movie thing for Jason Voorhees and Freddy Kruger. Don't get me wrong I like Jason and Freddy. But I am really big fan of Michael Myers. Jason and Freddy have tooken things from Michael like the mask idea the one Jason wears! And Freddy who always kills people from the house 1428 Elm Street, Michael not only does he just kill his family, but the people who go into his house. I bet a bunch of you people now hate me, but I'm just making a point. But all 3 of the killers and their movies can scare me still.

B00005V9HH|5.0|Great movie.  Probably the best crime movie of the 90's (not sure if goodfella's counts as the 90's).  Very engrossing story with an amazing ending.  Smart, edgy, a movie that will always stand apart on its own.  The DVD has plenty of extras too.  This movie is a great edition to anybody's collection.
B00004W221|5.0|There aren't that many films that can grab your attention, and hope for the best by the time it finally ends. This film (released in 1993) was one that i missed when first released. It is now 2003, and i finally had the privilege to view it. It's a true story of hardship, determination, luck, and hard work. I do not understand why the critics did not like the film. If critics did not spend so much time comparing it to other films and not by it's own merit, it would have received better reviews. Also, critics pounced on Goldsmith's score of the film. That was amusing, since it's only a film score, not intended to be a work of absolute brilliance. The score indeed enhanced the emotional aspect of the story. The film is a must-see, even if you do not care for football (myself included). The acting was what was needed for the film, nothing more. The film was not made to win all of the Academy Awards available, but proved that a true story could be told without getting too sentimental. I praise the film for being focused, and not having any sub-plots that would have marred the intent. It's a story for all ages. For those who need inspiration when they feel that they cannot achieve what they want. For those who have achieved by hard work, and have proved themselves. I cannot stress any further how good this film is, not because i have just previously viewed it, but that it should be seen by anyone who wants to view, a good film.
B000002U6E|5.0|Enigma music is life. In the music you hear passion at it's most passionate. For the most part you always know what you will get with a new Enigma album, but that is why I like them, I expect to hear what they know what I want to hear. And that is music from the heart, mind, and soul. Now if they would only tour, because Enigma music is meant to be perfomed on a stage. Let me tell you my favorites on \\"The Cross of Changes\\".  My favorite song is \\"I Love You, I\\"ll Kill You\\" I love the great lyrics.My second favorite is \\"The Eyes of Truth\\". The longing for understanding comes across in the vocals and how the music meets with that longing. My third favorite is the album opener \\"Second Chapter\\".  Here the purpose is to give an overture of sorts as to what we will hear on the rest of the albums, and it also bridges where the last album left off.  My fourth favorite is the upbeat \\"Age of Loneliness(Carly's Song). The music is the star of the show here. I thought the second album was a great follow-up to the megahit debut.  It just simply followed in the same line.

B00005JKZV|5.0|The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is just as good if not better than the first movie in the series.  Picking up where the first one left off, Towers perfectly continues the stories as the Fellowship has been broke up in the efforts to return the One Ring to the fiery pits of Mordor.  Frodo and Sam are joined by Gollum, the previous owner of the ring.  This is an excellent part of the story as Gollum decides what to do with them and Frodo begins to suffer more under the wrath of the ring.  Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli find themselves in Gondor where they join with the king Theodin who is evacuating his people to the fortress of Helm's Deep.  Just like the first one, Towers leaves on a cliffhanger that leaves viewers desperately wanting to see more.  Also, the battle for Helm's Deep is one of the greatest battle sequences ever made and should not be missed.  The forces of both Sauron and Saruman converging on the stone fortress guarded by a much smaller opponent makes for a battle that is incredible too watch.  After watching the movie, check out the documentary on The Return of the King and the battles that will take place in that movie.  See what Peter Jackson says about those battles to put it all into perspective.  In one battle sequence, he says there will be as many as 200,000 warriors, on one side.<br />  The whole cast returns for this second installment and is just as good as the first one.  Elijah Wood as Frodo, Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn, Ian McKellin as Gandalf, Sean Astin as Sam, Orlando Bloom as Legolas, John Rhys-Davies as Gimli, Christopher Lee as Saruman, are all great in their performances, just as they were in the first one.  The DVD is very good offering widescreen presentation, theatrical trailers, an impressive preview of Return of the King, numerous documentaries, and so much more.  This is a great movie that should not be missed.  Fellowship and Towers are so far the greatest fantasy movies ever made.  I can't wait to see The Return of the King in December as well as the Special Edition 4-disc set coming out in November.  While the movie may differ from the book at certain points, it is still very good.  Fans of Tolkien will still love The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers.  Go out and buy this DVD!
006097625X|5.0|Sure, I have taken Art 101 courses, but none of those held my interest as much as this author. I had never really taken comics seriously, but I certainly will give them more heed now. Some comics have been and always will be better served as liner for litter boxes, but some really are good. This book, done in comic format itself, is a wonderful example of that.<br />Not thinking I would even finish the book, I found myself reading more and more of it with each sitting (I often read books five or ten minutes at a time). This was easy reading and educational -- a great combination for me. Give it a try!

I saw this cd at Hot Topic at the listening station. When I put on the headphones and put the volume to it's max, I was amazed. This cd rocks! I haven't stopped listening to it since i got it in the first week. I have not heard the first cd yet but im pretty sure you'll like this cd if you like the first one.  This cd contains a lot of intensity yet there is a lot melodies stuff on here.

0385512104|5.0|Curious Incident is a novel that is wonderfully clever and informative. Made me wish I had paid more attention in high school math classes! I learned tons and tons about autism, which especially interests me in that a dear nephew of mine is autistic. All the reviewers mention how funny the novel is. Well, it does come across that way, but to my mind it is more tragic than amusing. The teenage protagonist is disabled and his parents are so very lost and self-destructive. Christopher (the main character) is prevented by his literalistic mind from acknowledging the possibility of a merciful God. That is truly sad, because his little world proves itself in dire need of grace, love, and forgiveness.
B000000WJZ|5.0|Sheer guitar wrenched bliss and amzing lyrics spat out over monster drumming. Simese dream is not so much an album as a force. This is undoubtably the pumpkins finest effort. While others argue that MCIS is better, it cannot compare to the brilliance of SD. SD is emotional with a moutain of personal information while Mellon Collie seems to be mostly a compilation of pop rock and metal bliss. While simese dream lives each out through every song. Mayonaise is the best song ever writen, imho, and the journey siamese dream takes you on is one not easily forgotten.
0871137380|4.0|Modern War is tomorrow's conventional warfare. The increase in speed at which war happens seems to merit the term \\"modern\\". Hard to believe a few days' tale takes this many pages to relate. The story is not a bunch of gung-ho shoot-em-up, but of personalities, miscommunication, cultural idiocy, bravery, and distant victories colored by Big Media. <BR>Reads like a novel so much so that you have to remind yourself it's as true-to-facts as any history can be.

This is the release that helped the Scorpions get recognition in the US. I recommend this album to anyone who wants to feel their heart race and hear guitars chase the emotions of Klaus' voice and the words he is singing. I also recommend looking over albums that were previously released and definitely overlooked.

0380977788|5.0|Coraline, the superior and imaginative ghost story written by Neil Gaiman, manages to be both a chilling lesson about the virtues of teaching children self-reliance, and a cautionary tale about learning to appreciate what one has been given, no matter how ordinary it may seem.<br /> Coraline is the child protagonist of the title.  Bright and full of pluck and invention, Coraline is also at the precocious age where she has become a bother to her busy parents.  When the family moves into a new house Coraline is left to her own devices.  To pass the time, Coraline goes on trips exploring the house.  During one of her expeditions, Coraline discovers a door which when opened leads to another house --- a house just like the one she and her family live in.  In this \\"other house,\\" Coraline meets her \\"other parents.\\"  Unlike Coraline's real parents, the other parents give Coraline the things she most desires.  Something  isn't right, though.  Everything in this other house is the same, yet different. The other parents have buttons sewed in where their eyes should be and skin which is paper white.  The other parents are also very anxious to have Coraline stay with them permanently.  Although Coraline barely escapes the first time, she returns to the other house of her own free will a second time when her real parents are kidnapped by her other parents.  Coraline's life-and-death game of wits with her other mother take up the electrifying last half of the story.  When Coraline receives a hand at the end of the story it isn't a congratulatory one.  I found myself startled by every little noise in my home after reading this segment. <br /> Coraline has been compared with The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe by C.S. Lewis.  I disagree with the comparison.  Mr. Gaiman's story has far more in common with Japanese animator Hayao Miyazki's most recent cinematic masterpiece Spirited Away. Both Coraline and Spirited Away feature young girls who are disdainful of their parents.  In bothstories the parents are whisked away into a strange and terrifying spirit world.  It is left up to the daughters to save their parents.  A journey of self-awareness in which each child learns valuable lessons along the way ensues.  Both stories create a genuine sense of danger for their protagonists.  It is not readily clear how things will turn out for each child.  A happy ending can't be seen waiting just around the bend.  This sense of not knowing what may happen, while terrifying, also serves as a form of catharsis for children.<br /> Coraline is a short book.  Not everything is easily explained.  Mr. Gaiman, trusting the intelligence of children, leaves a great deal to the imagination.  Rest assured, though, while his book may be a fast read, the images Mr. Gaiman creates will linger in the imagination long after Coraline has been finished.<br />Preston McClear ...
B000062YAZ|5.0|This definitely one of the best thrash metal albums ever. Slayer certainly did well in combining fast, aggresive punk with heavy metal. The riffs sound awesome!!! The combination of palm muted notes with single notes and power chords make the riffs in this album unique and original.<br />The album is fast. I literally mean, fast! Nearly all the songs apart from Post-Mortem, Piece by Piece and Jesus saves are played at over 210 bars per minute!!! The intro of Angel of Death is an example of this. <br />The album is evil. This is typical Slayer. The lyrics feature heavy Satanic imagery, references to death and necromancy, and are very sadistic. If you are a sensitive person, who gets offended by this I wouldn't reccomend this album to you.<br />In conclusion, this album rocks and the 30 mins of listening will certainly blow you away. This album has everything; the fast, insane, random guitar solos (which fit into the mania of music), Araya's piercing screams, Dave's double bass drumming, the fast riffs and the lovely sadistic evil.<br />This is a must for anyone who likes Slayer, Metallica, Megadeth and Sepultra.
B00009L1TA|3.0|Some movies like \\"The Usual Suspects\\" or \\"Courage Under Fire\\" pull off about-turn twists and multiple reminiscences of characters with a certain pizzazz. \\"Basic\\" attempts the same but ends up in a sad sophomorish streak with one plot twist too many.<br />What this movie really has going for it is the atmosphere. The scenes of the squad in the hurricane (which, not to give anything away, is the plot of the movie all told in flashback) is very atmopheric, dreadful and appropriately mysterious. We are basically given a who-dunnit mystery told through the mouths of two survivors, each contradicting one another. Without giving much else away, the ending really did have me surprised though a little gypped.<br />What went wrong? Ambiguous information (which serves as a filler to the plot) and poor editing.  It tries to up the ante with the plot twists over and over and over and over again but after about the 10th twist in the plot, it gets weary.<br />The story itself is quite alright but shouldn't have tried so hard to make the viewer feel like it had outsmarted them -- anyone can make a plot with an unexpected ending but it takes some panache to tie it all together, and have it flow smoothly. Basic seems very choppy.<br />Despite the negativity that I am trying not to hide, this film is definitely watchable and dont let the lame reviews convince you into skipping it.<br />Watch it. Just with somewhat low expectations.
B000002ILG|5.0|I'm not exaggerating. Pride is perhaps \\"the most important album\\" I ever bought. It is what paved the way for me, what got me into Hard Rock and Heavy Metal, what made me a big fan of guitar riffs and solos, and so much more. I consider Pride to be the best album from the 80's era with all those so-called \\"hair bands\\". White Lion, for one, has always been different from 90% of the bands out there, especially because of Vito Bratta, possibly the most underrated musician of that decade and easily my favourite. Even though he retired from music back in 1992 and I have discovered lots of different bands and gotten into different types of metal, he is, to me, still the most emotional songwriter ever. His tone is one of a kind and I've yet to hear another player except Eric Johnson who can capture his incredibly clean tone. Vito's two-hand tapping became a trademark back when Pride was released and even Eddie Van Halen called him \\"one of the few players out there who made it big without trying to be an EVH clone\\".<br />Now as for the album Pride, actually this is not White Lion's debut album as some people have said. Pride is the band's second release after their 1984 Fight To Survive album, which got little critical acclaim. Pride was the band's break through record on a major label, namely Atlantic. Produced by Michael Wagener, the album contained several hits including the Top 3 Billboard classics \\"When The Children Cry\\" and \\"Wait\\". The solo in the latter was discussed in countless guitar magazines from 1987 to 1989, till many other guitarists of the era were \\"influenced\\" by Vito's technique.<br />Vocalist Mike Tramp sounds relatively more powerful on Pride compared to their debut FTS. His voice on songs like \\"Lady of the Valley\\", \\"Lonely Nights\\" and \\"When The Children Cry\\" sounds genuinely heartfelt and emotional. Though some listeners may not like his singing, to me, Pride would have never been so beautiful without Mike's input. Vito's call-and-response solos, alternate picking, crunchy riffs, and fluent legato combined with his unbelievable tapping along with Mike's haunting vocals and lyrics simply make Pride an 80's masterpiece. To this day all the songs on this album destroy me. I've been listening to it all these years and never got tired and I feel like I'll be giving Pride many more spins for years to come. Now that's what I call an album that never gets old and boring.<br />The band released two more albums after Pride but never reached the same peak again. Too bad they never got the support from their label they so well deserved. It all ended in misery when Tramp went on to form a new band called Freak of Nature and Vito quit music altogether.nate picking, crunchy riffs, and fluent legato combined with his unbelievable tapping along with Mike's haunting vocals and lyrics simply make Pride an 80's masterpiece.

B0000AI44Q|5.0|Comeback may be an understatement. This may turn out to be a career defining work, and Neil has had a long career. I have just bought this and I have to say it is the most consistant and musically coherent album of his I have ever heard. The story is secondary. The music is beautiful adult rock and roll. Nothing trendy, it will be as much a staple in your childrens music collection in 20 years as Rust Never Sleeps is in yours now. Not only is the album 78 minutes long, but it comes with a DVD of a solo performance of the whole album. Classic.
B00003CXUM|5.0|This is one of the most complete DVD packages I have ever seen ... something that couldn't have happened to a nicer film.<br />This package is one of few that takes advantage of what the DVD medium promised when it was launched. In the same small package all DVDs come in, the producers of In the Mood for Love somehow manage to include an array of the movie's trailers and posters from around the world, interviews with the major actors and director Wong Kar-wai, a second short film produced by Mr. Wong, an alternate ending to the story that had been under consideration, and director's commentary about all of it, along with a variety of subtitle options. There is also a special booklet that has the translated short story the film was based on, an essay about the film by a well-known Hong Kong critic and a very interesting (if unevenly translated) essay about the setting for the film by a local historian. All in all, a really amazing collection of information.<br />Of course, none of that would matter if the film it was all based on wasn't so darn good.<br />The story is wonderfully understated, told with deft simplicity and a delicate hand. On the surface, it's a relatively simple tale about two couples in neighboring Hong Kong apartments in 1962. Through circumstantial evidence, Mr. Chow and Mrs. Chan discover that their always-on-the-road spouses are having an affair -- a discovery that comes into focus as the stay-at-home half of each couple discovers the attraction each has for the other.<br />But the beauty of this film comes more from what is left out than what is put in. The dialogue is sparse, and the acting is elegantly austere. The faces of the unfaithful spouses aren't shown at all during the film, and the film's main conflict comes not when Mr. Chow and Mrs. Chan discover they are being cheated on but when they fail to react the way most would expect.<br />Add to that unusual camera angles that at times pull the viewer into the scene and a haunting soundtrack guaranteed to stay in mind hours after the end of the film. The final result is a film that feels like a blend between an old classic and a modern masterwork, a recipe for great entertainment.ack guaranteed to stay in mind hours after the end of the film.

B00005JLSE|5.0|I love musicals and this is definately one of my favorites! It won 6 Academy Awards including best picture. When Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger) is put in the slammer for murder she comes across Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones). They both are fighting for the attention on Chicago's Murderess Row. And Billy Flynn (Richard Gere) as the best lawyer to make his defendant famous after he is threw with them. But Kelly and Hart realize there is only room for one legend, or is there? If they could work together for a change. This film also stars John C. Reily as Roxie's dumb good for nothing husband Amus, Lucy Liu as the new attention seeking murderess, and Queen Latifah as the Mama of the jail. Beautiful movie, i highly recommend.
B00005JL3A|3.0|Honestly when I first thought about buyig this disc I had reservations. One being that it's based off a Japanese video game called &quot;Biohazard&quot; suitably renamed &quot;Resident Evil&quot; for the states. Two I didn't know any of the actors except for Mill Jovavich and I did like her performance in The 5th Element.<br />I however went ahead and bought the movie. To my surprise the flic wasn't bad at all. I expected certain things to be &quot;stolen&quot; from other flics especially in the horror genre but then again they're all rehashes of each other really. The story was good and the CG kept up with what the director wanted to portray. Don't expect a whole lot from Resident Evil but it's worth placing in your collection definately. I know you have worse titles in there already so at least you're on your way up with this one. If I had to recommend another recent horror flic over this one I would have to say that would be &quot;Event Horizon&quot;. This movie is truly a modern classic and I would recommend it to anyone who loves the horror genres.
0786915749|5.0|For everyone searching for the roots of the Dragonlance series, it all started here. Dragons of Autumn Twilight holds in it a kind of inarticulate \\"magic\\" that compels many readers to continue on through the series. The characters are developed with immaculate detail. By the end of the book, a reader can feel a sense of familiarity to each of the characters. The plot itself is but a drop in a bucket when it comes to the world of Dragonlance, albeit the story is full of exciting conflicts and personal quests. This enthralling, innovative novel is a must read for all fantasy fans.

B000089RVX|5.0|Most people who have heard the track &quot;Bring me to Life&quot; probably formed an immediate opinion - for good or for bad. My opinion was the former, and having played the album a few times I can admit to having fallen in love with Amy Lee's vocals.<br />Venturing further I actually started to listen - and I mean LISTEN - to the lyrics. WOW!, deep and very moving stuff. <br />I have seen Evanesence described in the music press as a &quot; Christian rock band&quot; - they deny this - and I believe that this &quot;label&quot; is simply an attempt by lazy music journos to pigeon hole a band who's lyrics are more simply &quot;spiritual&quot; in nature. <br />Funny how quickly the self same press dropped the &quot;religious&quot; tag when U2 became huge - even though Bono continues to draw on his own beliefs.<br />Undoubtedly Amy's lyrics are written from her soul as opposed from her heart. To any other I would describe them as thought provoking, but for me they are more powerful than that - especially when the words are set to music that swings from orchestral to all powerfull guitar riffs and back - to coin an overused phrase - AWESOME!. <br />As a fan of The Cure, Joy Division etc. during the 80's, I have to say this is a much more mature outpouring of introverted angst and confusion. <br />There are no lessons here - no preaching or proclaiming - just a collection of songs that individual people can contemplate in their own space &amp; time - alternatively you could just play it loud! <br />Either way I think it is the best thing I've heard for years. Head noddingly, foot tappingly, tear jerkingly wonderful stuff. Buy it and grow to love it!
B00006L83N|5.0|I'm unsure of how Symphony X manages to come up with CDs like this, and really, I don't care. The Odyssey approaches the previous 'V' in likeability, surpassing it in a few areas. Some of the songs seem to be fuller, louder; I view 'V' as a piece of refined musicianship, a little withdrawn with more nuances. The Odyssey is like Symphony X took the introverted 'V' and made it the most popular kid in school. That's not a bad thing, because with popularity, this album is really, really cool. Tracks like 'King Of Terrors' and 'The Turning' have a tendency to rattle brain cells loose, while 'Accolade II' has one of the most transcendental guitar solos at the six minute mark. While it serves as an effective method for changing to a higher key, there is also a tingling sensation along with it as it modulates. Michael Romeo's guitar can be very beautiful when it is called for.<br />Now, like other people, I miss the keyboards from 'V' (especially so, because I'm a pianist), and thus, 'Awakenings' is my favourite track. All the breaks and interruptions that Symphony X throws into songs didn't prepare me for the smooth jazz piano/bass interlude in the latter section of 'Awakenings.' And for some reason, it fits in perfectly with the song. <br />Musicianship the whole album through is at a high level. The singing of Russell Allen varies from a soft, glassy sheen to rough edged almost-growl. Drumming...wow, I know little about drumming, but all the pickups are speedy and perfectly loud.<br />The title track...it's long, 24 minutes, but the time seems to fly by just like it does for the rest of the album. Though it's hard to top the originality of their prior epic song, 'The Divine Wings Of Tragedy' (which started with acapella layered voicings not unlike a 17th century composer like Tomas Luis de Victoria), it is a masterpiece all the same. It is a shame modern day tour de forces don't receive the notoriety of classical era symphonies, because this song is truly amazing. This is one song that can fairly sum up Symphony X's achievements; it showcases their breadth of composition from the opening fragments of orchestrated horns to an ending that has one of the best choruses ever.<br />The bad? Sometimes songs can get repetitive. The first track, 'Inferno,' has a novel idea of moto perpetuo (as is said in the liner notes), but begins to wear a ways into it. Other than that...it's addictive. It will be a rare prog metal fanatic that will be able to stop listening to this. I bought this album when it came out, and now, many months later, am still listening to it regularly. Most certainly worthwhile.
B00003CX9E|5.0|Can you imagine what the perception of RKO was at the time they made this decision?  Let's see, how about we give complete control of a major film to a twenty five year old radio voice with zero film experience (whose claim to fame was scaring the life out of the public with a fake story about aliens landing on earth) and even better, let him staff the movie with actors who have little to no screen experience.  On top of that, we'll let it become one of the most controversial pictures of its time because it mirrors the life of one of the biggest names in America today.  Why, it may never be able to be released because of the lawsuits-- Great idea!<br />I have just described Citizen Kane.  All of the above is true, which makes the fact that it is possibly the greatest film in American Film History even more amazing.  Everything is perfect.  The script (which Welles co-wrote), the actors (all relative unknowns except Welles and Joseph Cotton), the special effects (listen to Roger Ebert's Commentary on this special edition for details) and finally, the makeup-- You won't believe how great a job they do making 25 year old Welles look 60.<br />As for the story, it's done in a most interesting fashion.  Charles Foster Kane (Welles) dies at the very beginning of the movie and utters his famous last word \\"Rosebud\\".  A reporter is given the task of finding out just what that one word meant.  So he goes and interviews all the people who knew Kane to try to learn the meaning of the word.  In the process, we are shown Kane through the eyes of those who knew him.  We never see Kane through his own eyes, always what his former associates saw.<br />This is interesting, because Kane is a tragic figure as seen by just about everyone.  He is unhappy and lonely.  We as an audience eventually learn the meaning of Rosebud.  I have read reviews that complain that the movie is about this one thing (I won't reveal what it is).  But long before we learn the identity of Rosebud, the film hasmade its point.  What is the point?  My opinion is that the film shows us basically the worthlessness and despair of materialism.  Loving \\"stuff\\" or money will ultimately lead to unhappiness.<br />By the way, this movie almost was never seen.  The man I spoke of at the beginning of the review is William Randolph Hearst, former newspaper magnate.  He saw too much of himself in the film and sued to squash it.  Fortunately he lost.  The second disc in the set is a two hour documentary on this topic.  It is also excellent and well worth a viewing.<br />One last thing.  Although this movie has been ranked on the AFI list as number one American movie of all time, it  did NOT win Best Picture in 1941.  That film?  \\"How Green was my Valley\\"
0066214122|1.0|This book reminded me why I don't read fiction very much. Although I am not a literature snob, I find much contemporary fiction to be kinda dime novelish, (I created a new word!) with the exception of Crichton, whose work I have enjoyed since the old Andromeda Strain days.<br />This particular book reminded me of s Stephen King book - Crichton starts to tell a perfectly good story, then, not knowing how to end it, tacks a ridiculous ending on it.<br />If you absolutely have to read this book, either check it out of the library, borrow it from a friend, or wait for the paperback to come out.<br />As a side note, I was very disappointed with the quality of this volume in general - pages raggedly finished, with ink blots partially obscuring the text. Really lousy quality for a hardcover - I have seen few paperbacks printed so poorly.

6305736650|5.0|What can be said of Casablanca that has not already been said?  This may be the most perfect movie ever.  Ingrid Bergman is luminous as Ilse.  She loved Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) when the two were in Paris (Rick didn't know at the time that Ilse was married) but when Hitler invaded, they had to escape quickly.  Ilse promised to meet Rick at the train station, but never showed.<br />Years later, \\"out of all the gin joints in the world, she walks into mine\\" laments Rick.  He is still in love with her, but her husband must leave the country and needs papers that Rick may have.  Without the papers, he will die in Casablanca.<br />In addition to Bogart and Bergman, Claude Rains is great as the policeman.  He brings several moments of levity to the film.  My favorite is when he shuts the bar down because he is \\"shocked, shocked to discover that gambling is going on\\", and in the next moment an employee hands him his winnings for the night.<br />Of course, all the cliched lines are very famous from this film.  It should be noted that the line \\"Play it again, Sam\\" never was actually spoken by a character in the film.  However, lines like \\"Round up the usual suspects\\" and the film's closing line are so common that they have become part of everyday lexicon.  Incidentally, if you have never seen the film and don't know what the last line is, believe me, when you see it, you'll know what I'm talking about.<br />I don't know if I could recommend a movie more.  One hour forty minutes has never gone by so quickly.  I have seen it at least a dozen times and I never tire of it.  Easily on my short list of the best movies I have ever seen.
0385504209|5.0|This is a book that will enthrall or enrage depending upon one's religious background and mindset.  For this reader it was a riveting exposition of great relevance in a lifelong pursuit of philosophy and world religions to learn whether or not the Bible is fiction.  Now I know.<br />The author is a meticulous researcher and careful chronicler of history, myth and fact. The story illuminates a compelling mystery that has tantalized mankind since time out of mind. \\"The quest for the Holy Grail is the quest to kneel before the bones of Mary Magdalene.  A journey to pray at the feet of the outcast one\\".  The Divine Feminine energy.<br /><br />The Da Vinci Code is a transformative story written in an effortless style that makes it easy to read and assimilate without the message being preachy at all. A Masterpiece.
B000099T2L|4.0|Beyonce's debut disc is a great variety of uptempo cuts and ballads.  Although the track listin' represents a roller coaster, (all uptempo, then all ballad), each song is wonderfully written to show off Ms. Knowles tremendous vocal talent.  Songs like \\"Crazy In Love\\", \\"Baby Boy\\", and \\"That's How You Like It\\" are potential smash singles.  While \\"Yes\\", \\"Speechless\\", and \\"Dangerously in Love 2\\" are for those real ballad lovers out there. Is it just me or can you see \\"Naughty Girl\\" being played in a strip club? Either way, this is a really solid album, you won't be disappointed.
B00005JLSE|4.0|I thought that this was a pretty good movie. It was fun to watch and had some good songs. Ren&eacute;e Zellweger did a great job, as did Catherine Zeta-Jones. Now, to all those people that compared this to Moulin Rouge: Yes, Moulin Rouge (to me) was the better movie. Moulin Rouge was just incredible, and you really have to be open to it. Chicago isn't strange, mind blowing, and spectacular like Moulin Rouge, but it was still pretty cool. In terms of musicals, it isn't the best one, but it had a cool story. I would still choose Moulin Rouge or Grease over this, but I thought that they did a very good job with the movie. To me, this was about the world of Hollywood and gossip and trying to stay in the spotlight. In a time when there aren't many musicals and they usually aren't accepted that readily by the public, this star-studded movie did very well at the box office. I think this movie is very much worth seeing. I couldn't watch it over and over and over, but I think I could watch it a couple more times since it is entertaining. Who knows, it might just grow on me and become one of my favourite movies of all time! Enjoy!!!!!
B00008LDPV|4.0|..Very good idea to gather all these animation artists and their teamworks in one movie...it could be confusing for some to watch an animation movie made of 9 chapters each is very different than other...but i think it was good to produce it in such way..here you are not watching a movie that is connected and united from the start to the end..you are watching several sketches all about the idea of matrix...far away from what you have seen in the movies ( the matrix )  ..you'd certainly enjoy the way each artist see the world of matrix in his own way and vision...also you'd enjoy the movie if you are into enigmatic and dramatic stories that seems some how incomplete so they keep your mind bust for ome time after watching 'em...i think much more movies can be produced with the same idea....seems the idea or the PHILOSOPHY of the matrix is more flexable that being just put in one movie....at the end here are the chapters i liked most : last flight of osiris , Beyond , The program.

B00006690G|5.0|I'd say this is tied with MMlp, SSlp a little way behind. This is a great cd where just about every song is good, and the excellent ones make up for the bad ones. I would say 9/10 BUY IT!!!!<BR>1.Intro-I would have preferred another psa, where he says 'yeah. arrest me' but o well no big deal<BR>2.White America- Great 'Way i am' style song where he looks at what his skin has done for and to him, and where he yells @#$% you America! 8.5/10<BR>3.Business- Great flow and an awesome beat make this one of my favorites. 9/10<BR>4.Cleanin Out My Closet- This is obviously a big song emotionwise, but i just can't get into it. 7/10<BR>5.Square Dance- Kind of weird but good song. I just hate the way he says 'scurred', that always annoys me. 8/10<BR>6.The Kiss- Not bad, not bad, but could be better. 6/10<BR>7.Soldier- Very good song i like a lot. he literally spits the last verse at you. 8/10<BR>8.Sayin Goodbye To Hollywood- He talks about how he wants to take it all back, he sold his soul to the devil, he wanted to give hailie the life he never had, but he forced them to be alienated. Pretty good and obviously full of feeling.8/10<BR>9.Drips-Totally gross and Obie is annoying.Not great.6.5/10<BR>10.Without me-Em, did you have to do another My Name Is clone? That said, nice song. 7.8/10<BR>11.Paul-*sighs* Another boring Paul Skit.3/10<BR>12.Sing For The Moment- Another song looking at his career, with an awesome sampling of aerosmith's dream on. One of the best on the album.9/10<BR>13.Superman- The chorus is too long and it's just overall not that good.6/10<BR>14.Hailie's Song- Aw[...] Em can't sing, but you can't help but fall in love with this one. Aw[...]<BR>15.Steve Berman- If you've heard the first one, this'll bring a smile on your face. If you haven't, he basically bags on how MMlp is a piece of $#!*.<BR>16.When The Music Stops- Nearly as good as Under The Influence(MMlp) but Proof and Bizarre bring it down by rapping terribly.8/10<BR>17.Say What You Say- Why does everybody like this? It's my least favorite song on the cd. It's clunky and the flow is terrible.5/10<BR>18.Till I Collapse- Great fight song with a thumping beat and a catchy chorus from Nate.8.5/10<BR>19.My Dad's Gone Crazy- Nice flow and Hailie sounds cute.8/10<BR>20.Curtains Close- A HAH! Just when you thought there would be no Ken Kaniff! At least all he wants you to do is rub is back...

B0000062Y2|4.0|This is definitely the best overall album for the JCS songs, although (as has been said before) Then We Are Decided is fairly pointless. The problem that keeps this from 5 stars is Yvonne as Mary. By herself, she's not that bad, but if you can find the Sarah Brightman versions of Everything's Alright and I Don't Know How to Love Him, they're just magnificent. The one other thing is I personally like a different Overture, I think it's the one from the 20th Anniversery London edition.   But for this version specifically, Jesus and Judas are awesome, and Caiaphas' voice is as inimitable as it is incredible. Watching the movie helps a little, especially in Everything's Alright with the way Judas and Jesus interact.   Best songs... Heaven on Their Minds, This Jesus Must Die (tho I don't get the drumming thing), Gethsemane, Last Supper, and Trial Before Pilate.   Low points, like I said, Yvonne's singing style (scooooop everything) bothers the hell out of me, so I Don't Know How is really weak and Everything's Alright is also subpar, and the ending to Simon Zealotes isn't very technically sound, if you get my drift.   Anyway, get this CD. For sure.

B00008OWZC|4.0|Its amazing that 30 years after the fact the power of the music on this CD still runs roughshod over most of what passes for rock and roll these days. The sound quality on this CD is excellent, and as a document of Led Zeppelin at the height of their powers is a must buy. <br />A minor complaint..Other than the improved sound quality, the \\"Dazed and Confused\\" presented here, though good, does not, in my opinion, stand up to the one on Song Remains the Same. That is 22 minutes of Jimmy Page at the height of HIS powers and will always, with the Allmans' \\"In Memory of Elizabeth Reed\\" and the Live/Dead \\"Dark Star>St. Stephen>The Eleven\\" be in my top three of recorded live tour-de-forces. <br />Whatever, the \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" here is a vast improvement over the lame-o one on \\"Song.\\" Page finally includes the \\"Since I've Been Loving You\\" that should have been included on \\"Song\\" and the acoustic portion at the end of Disc 1 is outstanding. Other highlights include \\"The Ocean\\" and \\"Bring it on Home\\" to close out disc 3. <br />Nicely done!
B00004RFFM|2.0|Deep Blue Sea had a monument of potential and they dropped the ball by becoming over-engrossed with shark attacks and sudden deaths of likeable characters, and unrealistc parts.  It's too bad, because I thought the sharks were cool in this, and Saffron Burrows was a joy to see because I thought her character came a long way up until the director makes a real bone head mistake in the end with her.<br />Deep Blue Sea is about super smart sharks that are being used to find a cure for Alzheimers.  Saffron's character is motivated to find a cure from these sharks because she lost her father to it.  This is good, gives her character an emotional connection to this film, a point for this pretty lady to be here.  As predictable as night will come, the sharks get loose and start eating everybody in the study facility.<br />I really don't see the point going over the characters that much because the majority of the characters had no development at all.  It's interesting how this film begins with Saffron Burrows and Samuel L. Jackson as the lead characters, the film practically following those two around.  About mid way through the film, the point of view shifts almost entirely to the shark trainer guy, Carter, and we know nothing about this dude.  This is just terrible directing and character view point.  So now, we have no idea who the main character is!<br />Then the sudden death of one of these main characters, mid way through, during a lengthy speech just ruins the film.  It's too sudden, and because his character was taken so early it was as if his character never contributed to the film at all...except for the speech.  Before a character, a main character mind you, should be killed off he/she needs to contribute first so when the person dies it doesn't make us say...\\"OK, um, what happened?\\"  In other words, it just confuses us not scares us.<br />Plus, my favorite character in Saffron, who is developing during this entire film gets the shaft in the end.  This is totallyuncalled for.  I wish I could go into more detail but I've been instructed not to give away important, specific things.  But it is very disappointing and very unnecessary, but again this director real had no idea of the potential he had because he was too obsessed with the sharks.<br />There's too much sudden shark attacks.  All these worthless characters have no point to the film, they are just there for future shark bait.  You need characters to contribute to a film, to have a point.  They shouldn't be there to fulfill the director's surge for carnage.  <br />I give it two stars because it is suspenseful and it can be scarey at some points, and I do like the story, even though no character establishes him or herself as the main character.  So because it does these things well enough, I give it two stars which means it is worth watching, but I assure you this film is not very satisfactory.  It kills off too many well liked characters.<br />The only reason why you would like this film is if you are one of those that likes any film that scares you or provides thrills.  But if you want substance, and character development that isn't cut short by a shark's jaws, then you better go see Jaws again because it is still the king of sea horror films.<br />Grade: D+
0316096199|5.0|Months ago, I read 'The Lovely Bones' by Alice Sebold.  I enjoyed reading 'The Lovely Bones,' so much that I decided to read her memoir 'Lucky.'  In her memoir, Alice Sebold, wrote about her own personal story.  While a freshman at Syracuse University,Alice Sebold, was raped in a tunnel.  Shortly after the rape Sebold turned to drugs and drinking.  What affected me in a sad way about the book, was how your life can change after a violent crime happens to you.  I applaud Alice Sebold, for having the courage to tell her own sad personal story.
6302800897|4.0|Allowing for the difference in movie-making over the past 40-50 years, it is easy to see why this film picked up some Oscars in its day.  Excellent performances and a twist ending make the viewing sheer pleasure.

B000099T2L|2.0|she is much better than britney, she can dance but I do not like her style! my style of music is not really ! just bought the cd for my girl friends birthday
B00005ASOC|4.0|A great story showing what can be achieved when race is put off to the side.
B00009RGBS|1.0|GUYS- this movie is to be avoided at all costs, unless you love musicals. Any guy who walks into this unsuspecting, as I did, is in for 2 hours of hell. Only one guy gets shot in this movie, no nudity at all, and lots and lots and lots of singing and dancing.  No car chases, no explosions, no shootouts... Definitely not a &quot;man's&quot; movie, and nothing you would talk to the guys at work about. You have been warned! Let the woman watch it while you give the lawn a 2 hour mowing.
B00009XITP|4.0|\\"What a Girl Wants\\" is a nice family comedy sure to please audiences.<br />THE STORY:<br />Raised by her single mother, Daphne Reynolds (Amanda Bynes) longed to meet the father she never knew.  Lord Henry Dashwood (Colin Firth) was an English gentleman destined for political greatness.  Little did he know that his life would be turned upside-down when the daughter he never knew suddenly showed up on his doorstep.  For Daphne, her life changes as well as she learns to adapt to the \\"good life\\" of a British aristocrat full of snobs and paparazzi.  In the end, both Daphne and Henry, through the help of family, friends as well as lovers, learn the true meaning of family and staying true to their hearts and selves.<br />THE COOL THINGS:<br />This is simply just a really nice movie on several levels.  The humor, while not bust-out-loud funny, is simple, nice and intelligent.  There is no profanity, no sexual innuendo, etc.  It's just a nice, pure, wholesome movie.  The movie's themes about the importance of family and of staying true to yourself are timeless.  The characters and situations they are placed in are simply charming.  Overall, this is just a plain nice movie to kick back and watch with the family.<br />BEST SCENES:<br />1. Breakfast at the Dashwood residence<br />2. The fashion show<br />3. Daphne and Ian's date<br />4. Daphne's presentation ball<br />THE DVD FEATURES:<br />The DVD comes with a decent set of extras for your perusal and listening pleasure.  Here are the goodies you get.<br />1. Amanda Bynes commentary track<br />2. Director commentary track<br />3. \\"Fashion and Etiquette 101\\" - 8 ½ minute featurette on the cast's wardrobe and etiquette lessons for the audience.<br />4. \\"What's a Girl to Wear\\" - Mix and match game wear the player needs to mix 3 sets of Daphne's clothes.  You get rewarded with a short special video if you match all three sets.<br />5. 3 deleted scenes.  Nothing special<br />6. Theatrical trailer<br />7. List of cast and crew<br />THE VERDICT:<br />\\"What a Girl Wants\\" is just a charming movie to watch.  The moving story of family and love is a refreshing change of pace in this world of sex and low brow comedy (not that there's anything wrong with that).  The humor of the movie is low-key and intelligent.  The DVD extras, while not overflowing like most new releases, add a nice touch to this already charmning movie.  Overall, this is just a \\"nice\\" movie to see.<br />GRADES:<br />The Movie:  4 stars<BR>The Extras:  4 stars<BR>Final:  4 stars<br />Highly Recommended
6305076995|5.0|This is a great movie. I can remember seeing this many years ago, more than once. Starship Trooper is not in its entirety, only get small pieces, tastes at the end. Obviously an editing issue. I would guess that even in 1973 they had to cut &quot;something&quot;, had to keep it commercial for the low attention span masses and their money. Other than that I have zero criticisms because it is very true to the performance. The camera work is fine, the amoebaes and fly-traps are fine, the capes are fine, and And You And I is great.
B00005JMCR|5.0|Despite a reduced cast \\"American Wedding\\" continues the tradition of oversexed comedic brilliance in this classic franchise.<br />THE STORY:<br />With high school and college behind them Jim (Jason Biggs) and Michelle (Alyson Hannigan), knowing they are the ones for each other, decide to get married.  As a result the gang (well, most of them) gets back together to help plan for and get ready for Jim and Michelle's big day.  As is the case when the gang gets together, lots of bad and hilarious things occur.  As an added plotline, Stifler (Sean William Scott) and his eternal nemesis Finch (Eddie Kay Thomas) take on each other for the attention of Michelle's hot sister Cadence.<br />THE COOL THINGS:<br />Many felt that the movie would lose a step with a lot of the old cast (Chris Klein, Tara Reid, Mena Suvari and Shannon Elizabeth) not returning.  This is not the case however.  The movie actually became a lot tighter with a lot of the extraneous characters eliminated (as several of these characters only had bit parts in the second film).  The same trademarked sophomoric comedy you love and expect from this series continues to shine through, particularly through Stifler's overwhelming personality.  Jim's dad (Eugene Levy) continues to put on a superb performance as the coolest dad on the planet.  In all, all is right in the world with this film.<br />BEST SCENES:<br />1. Stifler and the Dog \\"Treat\\"<br />2. The Bachelor Party<br />3. Stifler and Grandma<br />4. The Proposal<br />5. Jim and the Cake<br />6. The \\"Dance Off\\"<br />THE VERDICT:<br />Overall, the film doesn't lose a step and the laughs keep rolling when Jim and his boys hit the road.  This is a fitting end to an excellent series.  It's sad to see them go, but I'm glad the series has gone out with a bang rather than a whimper.<br />Highly Recommended
0385504209|5.0|The inside cover of The DaVinci Code says &quot;This is pure genius.&quot; This couldn't be closer to the truth. In an incredible show of creativity, imagination, and cunning, Dan Brown brings to life an ancient secret the likes of which I have never seen before. To be concise, this is the most interesting book I have ever read - and it has everything a book of its type needs: action, suspense, mystery and everything between. The characters are fanatastic and dynamic, the plot has a blissful mixture of action and information, and the puzzles and codes are unbelievably clever. The way that Mr. Brown ties these seemingly unrelated facts (every bit of information about history and art is true) into a single novel is utterly stunning. Dan Brown is many steps ahead of today's writers. Read this book... I promise you will love it!
B0000630YA|5.0|This is it!  The myth, the legend, the classic, Welcome To My Nightmare.  Alice's first solo album after leaving his original band.  On his own he had the freedom to take the stage theatrics to a new level, and the result is one of the best rock albums of all time.  This was the first Alice Cooper album I ever owned and remains my favorite of all of them.  Alice would release many great albums throughout his career but none of them would sound quite like this.  This is the original horror/rock/broadway musical.  Many groups would adapt this formula and make their little moderations to it(King Diamond and Gwar to name a few), but nothing can compare.  It isn't possible for me to find enough good things to say about this album or all the reasons why you should zoom your butt down to the store and get it.  If you have any interest at all in classic rock you may or may not have been contemplating purchasing this album.  While most of Alice Cooper's discography is great, if you only buy one Alice Cooper album in your life, buy Welcome To My Nightmare.<br />  In fact, you should have already headed out the door on your way to the record store before you even got this far into the review.
B00006L7XQ|4.0|Although I listen to a great variety of music, I must admit country has not customarily been one of them.  However, for me, Cash removes a lot of what I dislike about the genre and substitues pure heart and insight.  <br />To be, the cover of &quot;hurt&quot; was masterful.  A very touching rendition, with his voice wobbling at recollection of life's experiences and pain.  I defintely enjoyed his emotional voice and hearing the song on acoustic guitars throughout.  <br />Now, I am a Nine Inch Nail fan, and must step up to defend some of what I've read here.  Why would people here point to this song to highlight Cash's &quot;musical genius&quot; and &quot;heartfelt, perfect lyrics&quot;?  They're, ultimately, not his! Saying Cash &quot;is showing Trent Reznor a thing or two&quot; when he sings the lyrics because he knows more what he's talking about is inane. Reznor has not faced the problems or loss that coms with old age, but the character in that album had been through more than his fair share of woe.  <br />Also saying he sings it without the &quot;angst of an industrial band&quot; is far from the truth as well!  The album (1994s The Downward Spiral) has its share of angst, yes.  But as the album's closer, Hurt chronicled the last gasps of a young man so overwhelmed by life that he was driven to take his life.  By the time that song rolled around, the protagonist felt vulnerable, impure, and regretful for having lived his life wrong.  The song ends there by transitioning from a strong industrial beat (note its timed as like a heartbeat) before a blast of static signifies the end of the protagonists life (static flatlines out...)  It ends the most gut-wrenching album I have ever heard (and I've heard a lot).  <br />So, I celebrate Cash for putting a unique vision on this song. But I implore you to not diminish the original.  Both versions do a wonderful job of describing the emotions of the man at the end of his line...
B00006879E|4.0|one of my favorite things to do is to grab a cd that ive never heard of so that later when i listened to it, i would listen to a brand new unfamiliar song. unfortunately, sometimes i grab the wrong one, and eventually ill put it in one of my dusty racks that i'll never take a 2nd look upon. maroon 5, thank goodness, is definitely not one of those. as soon as i listen to it, it attracts me in a different way than other songs did. its not pop, not rnb, nor soul or rock... its basically a new thing, and style.. i couldnt actually describe it verbally, but i dare say that it is different from any songs u have ever heard! so, if u ever have the guts to try something new, try this! maroon 5 is definitely not gonna add my unused collected cd that i only hear once or twice!
0345363132|5.0|This book was recommended to my class by my history teacher who calls himself &quot;a Richard III&quot; advocate, and now I see where he gets this opinion. <br />Penman seems to have literally flipped Shakespeare's equally marvellous play. Every character who is revolting in the play is protrayed in a favourable light in the book. In this book, Richard is a puppet of fate and it is terrible to see him head towards his inevitable doom. <br />This story wraps you up in the intrigue, confusion, love and trechery of the day and carries you away. Each character touches your heart, be they good or bad. What a marvellously written, well-researched and convincing book!<br />I, too, am now a &quot;Richard III advocate&quot;.
B000002B35|5.0|This is a good starting CD for people who want to listen to Pink Floyd's best without paying loads of money for all their CDs. This album has all of their greatest hits, sung live in crisp quality on 2 CDs. They are truely amazing. I can never get enough of this. The cover is beautiful, too. Don't miss out on this one. It's a true Pink Floyd collector's item. Plus, it comes with a little booklet of pictures. Only the best from the best band is what I say.
B0000AMJED|5.0|I think this is a GREAT movie!! I guess If i had to pick 1 thing that I didnt like about it was the fact that they leave you hanging on what happend to Dom. (Vin Diesel) they mention it a cuple of times in the 2nd movie but he didnt say anything about it. but besides that I really recomend the movie to anyoe who likes fast and good looking cars!!!
0375414053|4.0|Katy Reddy defines the working mother in today's world!  Being a working mother myself, this book was hard to escape with in the beginning.  After a day at the stressful office and then coming home to read the first two chapters, I felt so overwhelmed with Katy's e-mails & to-do lists I could only stop to create my own to-do list's and respond to my own very full e-mail in-box.  However, I continued on and after getting to know this working mother a little more, I learned to feel relaxed while reading, regardless of all of the stress that Katy was experiencing. I also found the British humor hilarious and found myself laughing out loud on several occasions.  I think this book proves that it's near impossible to have it all.  Thanks to a friend for purchasing this great gift for my BIRTHDAY!
0140186409|5.0|This book has stood the test of time and remains an American classic. Throughout the book, Steinbeck gives us an intimate insider's view of the Joad family by providing a narration and dialogue with an incredibly fine level of detail. The description of the poverty and difficulties of the Joads is so vivid that I couldn't help but feel for the human condition back then. To be poor is one thing, but to live without knowing where your next meal is coming from is quite another.<br />The most vivid passage for me is in Ch. 28, when the Joads have been working on the cotton farm for a while and Ma Joad has accumulated enough money to finally go on a &quot;spending spree&quot; at the market. She probably didn't have more than a few dollars, yet when she buys enough food for the whole family, I actually felt a sense of relief, for it seemed they were as rich as kings.<br />To me there are two resounding themes present in this novel. First of course is the strength of the family in the face of adversity. &quot;Family&quot; means more than blood ties; it means people who have shared your suffering and will lend a recipricol hand when needed. This relationship also means that walls will be built to keep some out: note how Tom quickly brushes off the one-eyed mechanic who hopes to come along on the trip. The second theme for me is the yearning for labour, &quot;muscles aching to work, minds aching to create beyond the single need -- this is man.&quot; We still see this today in America: a need to work for something beyond just money, it is a need to be productive and busy, to surpass our parents, and to produce successful offspring.<br />A final note about this Penguin edition: It evidently reproduces the original typesetting from 1939, so it quite long at 619 pages. However, don't be put off by the length. The font is large, and the interline space is relatively wide. This book could easily be around 100 pages less with a more modern typesetting.
B00004YRQA|4.0|I bought my PS2 in a set, 2 controllers, the ps2, and this memory card. It works just as well as my MadCatz 8MB memory card, but is about twice the price. I wouldn't recommend you buy this, but rather the MadCatz memory card.
B00005JLYW|2.0|I loved the first Charlie's Angels.  It was kitchy, outrageous, funny and had three girls kicking butt.  It didn't take itself seriously -- kind of like the show -- and that was the reason it was fun.  It wasn't supposed to be Indiana Jones-serious and I went into it knowing that.  The sequel... could have been done better, unfortunately.  But, it's not without it's charm.  POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD.<br />The good:<br />Well, the three original characters are back and they have more adventures, more stunts, more fights and plays up to all of them nicely.  You have Demi Moore playing an angel gone bad, which was a nice twist and a handful of cameos.  Cameron Diaz being the loveable ditz is hysterical.<br />The bad:<br />There's a number of things here that I just have to write about.  The storyline is choppy and ill-written.  The first's storyline was outrageous, but it worked.  This one is so out there with too many characters, too many bad guys, too many subplots that it was overkill.  You have Dylan's past coming back to haunt her, Alex's father thinking she's into prostitution, Natalie's relationship with her now live-in boyfriend, creepy thin-man with absolutely no purpose and Matt LeBlanc who should have never been written back in, top that off with the Halo rings that have been stolen and so many characters playing bad guys you get lost.  The script should have been worked on much harder and longer; it's like the first Tomb Raider, it just concentrates too much on action and the serious moments are really unnecessary.  This movie tries to be more dramatic in areas that really are wasted, (i.e., Dylan coming to terms with the fact that the Angels will eventually split up down the road, sob! sob! Oh, c'mon!)<br />There's too many one-liners, (they actually use the term bee-yatch... GAG! Why didn't they just throw in blang, blang, while they were at it?) making it highly annoying at times.  Bernie Mac, although I love his show, was VERY much badly cast as Bosley.  They should have offered Murray a lot of money to reprise his role because there are just too many times that the Mac is just annoying and wasted.  Creepy thin man (Crispin Glover) who was brilliant in the first movie, reprises his role and unfortunately they give some of his background.  WHY was this necessary!?!  Plus, for absolutely no reason, he gets involved with the Angels which you will see.  They kill the mystery of the creepy thin man in this sequel.<br />Matt LeBlanc and John Cleese's roles are completely wasted on a useless subplot around Alex (mistakening her for a prostitute, Charlie being her pimp.)  Demi Moore makes a great bad angel.  She's hip, fun and wicked... she's just overdone.  Her role starts too far into the movie and she acts like she's making up  for it.  She only surfaces in the last third of the movie.  Plus, it's really obvious she's trying to upstage her three younger costars.  Demi is definitely lovely eyecandy for the guys out there, and considering how the world knew that she spent a lot of money on resculpting, concentration is focused on how she looks rather than her role.<br />Plus, it's really obvious that Drew Barrymore had a lot of creative control in this flick.  She's heavily into gun control (so only the bad guys have guns, and they kinda make a point of that, which gets a little preachy) her plots/subplots overshadow her two costars, which I found annoying and she has the most camera time.  Drew, next time, share.  The one thing I did like is that she's not as glamorous as her two partners, which was a nice twist.<br />So, it's with heavy hesitation that I say it was fair.  I had hoped that it would have been as good as the first, but apparently it didn't do too well in the box office, so if there's a third installment, I'll be surprised.  I won't be buying this... maybe rent it if there's nothing else to rent, but I'd recommend sticking to the first.  Two out of five stars for bad script and bad focus.should have offered Murray a lot of money to reprise his role because there are just too many times that the Mac is just annoying and wasted.

B00008X5J3|4.0|From the reviews on this site, everyone either loves or hates 'Chicago.'  Well, add me to the list that loves it.  I have seldom been so thoroughly entertained.  The music, dancing, and acting are wonderful, and the editing of dialogue scenes mixed in with the musical numbers enhances the experience.  It is very difficult to turn a great theatrical experience into an equally great cinematic experience.  'Chicago' succeeds at this by staging all the musical numbers as stage performances, but using close-ups and cut-aways to add a visual quality that only a movie can.  Those who dislike the movie because of its characters being crooked and amoral are missing the satiric edge of the script.  We are not meant to love these characters, or root for them, but to laugh at the society that allows itself to be flim-flammed by lawyers and the media into siding with adulterers and murderers.  Don't try to analyze the movie for social commentary; just revel in the exuberance of the performances and the sheer dazzle of the production numbers.
B000089RVX|5.0|This album doesn't fall easily into a category I'd typically like.  The *look* of the band is a bit Goth, while the music is more Linkin Park (as has been mentioned in multiple other reviews here).  <BR>Regardless, when a friend got hooked on this album, I gave it a listen - and this group is almost mind-bendingly good!  It's almost shocking how they manage to be on the heavy-modern side of &quot;rock&quot;, while at the same time absolutely nailing the catchy riffs that bring radio play, and giving you lyrics that are deep and meaningful --- all in the same song!<BR>Tourniquet and Going Under are 2 excellent songs.  This is an almost shockingly good album, that surprises on multiple levels.  Enjoy, but know it's got the depth to be enjoyed multiple times.
B00008S2VG|5.0|Definitely the best CD of the year--one of my favorites of all time.  I love every track with the exception of maybe &quot;Mother and Father&quot; (which is still pretty good).  Vocals, instrumentals, effects, lyrics... there all great.
0790743507|5.0|SINGIN' IN THE RAIN is a classic musical, and the one for which the great Gene Kelly will be most fondly remembered. The screenplay, by Betty Comden and Adolph Green, is laugh-out-loud funny and unlikely ever to seem dated; the score is tuneful; the dancing is superb; every number has terrific energy. Dancer Kelly may seem to be cast against type as ham actor Don Lockwood -- but actually he's not. Lockwood is, after all, a silent film star, and therefore must communicate using body language -- just as a dancer does. He doesn't become a spoken actor until late in the film -- and even then, he is a musical actor, rather than a straight dramatic one. Kelly's performance is indeed remarkable, and he is supported superbly by Jean Hagen (whose demur facial expressions in the first part of the film -- before she says a word -- contrast hilariously with what is soon revealed to be a shrill speaking voice), Debbie Reynolds, and of course the adorable Donald O'Connor, with whom Kelly performs dazzling tap duets to &quot;Fit as a Fiddle&quot; and &quot;Moses Supposes.&quot; O'Connor also gets to dance the riotously funny &quot;Make 'Em Laugh&quot; and is joined by Kelly and the charming Reynolds in &quot;Good Morning.&quot; And, last but certainly not least, there is Kelly's joyous, classic &quot;Singin' in the Rain&quot; and his masterfully choreographed &quot;Broadway Melody&quot; ballet, which is supposed to be part of &quot;The Dancing Cavalier,&quot; the musical film in which Lockwood is starring. The parodies of early talking pictures (like the out-of-sync dubbing in &quot;The Duelling Cavalier&quot;) are also masterful. As a satire on the era that saw the transition from silent films to &quot;talkies,&quot; and as a song-and-dance entertainment, SINGIN' IN THE RAIN is a great, great movie.
B000002GB9|5.0|There are a number of artists who seem to suffer from the unfortunate fate of their creativity not aging well. Styx is such a band. Often ridiculed for their slickly produced *corporate* rock, as well as supposedly coming off as an anemic version of some notable British progressive rock artists, the guys had to feel some tremendous hurt from the constant harsh criticism - which still exists more than 25 years after their major success THE GRAND ILLUSION was released. To many, most of Styx's material is simply no more than a dated joke.<br />Under my assumption, the responses to Styx's material seem to fall into two major categories: (1). Music fans listen to it, and dismiss it as a cheesy, watered-down, pretentious mess. They would want nothing more to do with this. (2). Music fans listen to this, and love the catchy melodies, but will try their hardest to refrain from admitting so, for fear of losing their *hipness* credibility.<br />But other than everything listed in the above paragraph, the biggest fans of this music are the ones who grew up with it when it was released. The adults around that time knew the negative reputation bands like Styx were receiving, but some youngsters around that time period were more than likely oblivious to the artist-bashing, and nevertheless, enjoyed the music just fine. I consider the latter to be the most blessed, as the saying goes, \\"what they don't know won't hurt them.\\"<br />But, all historical insights aside, I've always enjoyed Styx's music, and I was never bothered by the slick productions of their music, or anything else for that matter. I found it to be highly enjoyable, quality music created by talented musicians, and still do.<br />THE GRAND ILLUSION exhibits accessible hard rock with progressive rock flourishes integrated into the mix to create a highly compelling brand of rock. There seems to be a theme that runs throughout the entire album - a theme that states no matter how successful, or unsuccessful one is, no matter what kind of career one has, no matter what lifestyle one lives, no matter what one does or does not have, it doesn't make you any better, or worse than any other individual. Believing so is simply a \\"grand illusion.\\"<br />I've seen and heard for the longest time Styx being knocked as a band trying *too* hard to be like Queen. I honestly never understood that, as Styx never seemed to exhibit enough *Britishness* in their sound to even come close to imitating Queen (even if those supposed accusations were true.) However, small traces of British progressive rock bands (e.g. Yes, Genesis, Jethro Tull) do come to mind when I listen to this music. Queen comes to mind as well, but - like the aforementioned Brtish progressive bands - in small traces. On the whole, I find Styx's music to be - more or less - unique.<br />The bombastic, anthemic, theatrical opening of the title track (which I absolutely love) brings resemblance to Genesis and Jethro Tull, and is possibly the closest thing to resemble *Britishness* on this disc. Meanwhile, the megalomaniacalesque, grand vocals on some of the verses resemble Yes and Queen to an extent. But overall, Styx's music seems so Americanized, it refrains from sounding like a largely derivative thing. Thematically speaking, this track features lead singer Dennis DeYoung stating the negative aspects that come with the package of being a \\"rock star.\\" The lyrics seem to state that the lifestyle many ordinary blokes dream of living is not all it's cracked up to be. This is exemplified in the aforementioned title track the most. However, fame - the pros and (mostly) cons of it -- plays a big part of the thematic element that runs throughout the disc.<br />\\"Angry Young Man\\" seems like a message to the punks of the day. When reading these lyrics, it's easy to see that Styx were trying to send out a positive, optimistic message. Cynics (especially of this generation) will read these lyrics and scoff until they run out of breath. I'll be thefirst to admit that they do seem a little dated in their naivete, but the natural creativity, and the sincere, heartfelt optimism is hard not to be moved by, and, let's be honest - it's nice to be able to take a break from cynicism, as it gets old really fast.<br />\\"Superstars\\" is one of my favorite tracks. A mid-tempo rocker with some lovely, touching vocal harmonies which happen to share more in common with R&B/Soul than they do with rock. \\"Come Sail Away\\" has aged well to me. The haunting and achingly moving chorus has not left me one bit, and those lyrics I find to be absolutely poetic and beautiful. An all-around beautiful and moving track. Guitarist James Young writes and sings lead vocal for the sneering \\"Miss America,\\" the edgiest, crunchiest tune on the album. James' snarling vocal burns with a white-hot passion ( and cracks me up hysterically.) A track which may please many cynics. Who would have thought? \\"Castle Walls\\" is the most *proggish* on the album - a track which starts off fairly low-key and melodic, before showcasing some lovely vocal harmonies. Then we are treated to a brief instrumental section of over-the-top theatrics which recall the many progressive rock giants of the early and mid-70s.<br />I love this music, regardless of the negative criticism surrounding it. Just try to enjoy the music for what it is - great music made by talented musicians - and forget about the *hipness* or lack of it.

B00005JLXE|5.0|This Film was greatly underrated due to the fact that it came out in when there was a plethora of sci-fi and comic book movies to choose from.Did anyone really expect it to get much attention when X-2, Tomb Raider 2, The Hulk, etc. were coming out?<br />That being said, I was very surprised by this film. I myself never saw it until it came out for rent. <br />In my opinion, it is one of the best comic book films made. Granted, Ben Affleck really shouldn't dye his hair red, and the branded Bullseye was a touch hokey, but the rest was pure comic book gold.<br />The movie gets points for showing a superhero with scars and missing teeth. I was personally amazed that Ben Affleck could actually portray Daredevil as a real character instead of just a guy running around in tights.<br />The hero has flaws, the villians have flaws, the supporting cast has flaws. It makes the film more realistic to show that this guy is going to confession or that he thinks he can't handle a rich girlfriend.<br />Be honest, most guys would freak if they found out their new girl had bucks in the bank. Why is it so hard to think that a superhero would?<br />Props for the special effects in this film. The costuming was actually well done. It did not look hokey like it so easily could have.<br />While I personally don't care for the style of music of the soundtrack for simple listening pleasure, it fits incredibly well with the slightly darker tone of the flick.<br />The extras on the DVD are actually good. The free game was a nice touch, and the hearing impared description track is a great addition givent he subject of the film.
B00005B23A|5.0|this is a great movie but i failed to buy it because its only available on widescreen letterbox format.i hope they come out with it in full or animorphic formats.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|This is my favorite soundtrack that I have ever bought, and I still listen to it all the time.  I have read reviews where people complained about the repetative nature of the music, but I disagree that this is a negative feature.  As a musician, I am fascinated by the subtle ways the main theme is changed throughout the sountrack such as changing tempos, beat patterns, and styles, to create an entirely new effect.  I recommend this soundtrack to anyone who loved the movie!!
B00003CXDV|5.0|This is a very funny movie and holds up very well under repeated viewings.  I think it is Tim Allen's best work. Alan Rickman is also great as the great stage actor wannabe stuck in rubber makeup repeating a signature line he hates.  Sigourney Weaver plays against type as the show's bubble headed computer-repeating eye candy.  She does this very well.  Tony Shaloub brings his special gift for characterization to this very laid back Tech Sgt Chen.  His performance is one of the most fun in the film.<br />This was the movie I first noticed Sam Rockwell and his role as Guy Fleegman is memorable because it is done so perfectly.  The Thermians are wonderfully done aliens who believe the TV signals they picked up were historical documents and set about making the fake sets and space ships into real space ships and transporters.<br />What a cool idea.  Enrico Colantoni brings surprising depth to Mathesar, who could have been a simple cartoon.  The same is true for Patrick Breen, Missi Pyle, and Jed Rees.  Robin Sacs goes over the top as Sarris and that is exactly what is required for ole lobster head.  And Jeremy Howard brings Kyle to life as a teen who is smart enough to know more about the Galaxy Quest show than the people who made it, but is still kid enough to accept the show almost as the Thermians do.<br />I just have to say that I find every scene in this movie a delight, including the continuity problems and plot flaws, just like the show it is parodying.  I mean, who cares when you are having this much fun.

0446691437|5.0|This book is tough love for creative professionals. Outlining many of the obstacles facing any artist, THE WAR OF ART confirms much of what I've experienced and observed in my own career.What another reviewer calls a &quot;negative attitude&quot; I find a refreshingly candid assessment of the artist's predicament. Making a living as a professional artist is difficult. But at least as much of that difficulty comes from inside our own heads as from the world around us. Pressfield doesn't let us off the hook for a moment. No excuses or self-pity allowed. Instead he encourages us to face our demons and commit to the challenge in a unique and stimulating way.<br />He does get a tad mystical with his talk of angels and muses, particularly toward the end of the book. But this is really just another way of describing that indecribable &quot;something&quot; we've all tapped into when we really find our creative groove. <br />A truly helpful book I'll keep with me as a rough guide and reference for years to come.
6304044836|5.0|I actually like the 1995 version better than the original, which is rare. You seldom see a remake that is better than the first.<br />This is a gem of a flick that never quite got the respect it deserved. Julia Ormond shined in this film. It is a true pity her American Film Career never quite lifted off.<br />The casting of Harrison Ford was brilliant as he played off all of the character's facets.<br />The expansion of the character of David is the best improvement over the original film. Instead of just being a vapid womanizer, he actually gets a personality and you find yourself actually believing that he would support his brother instead of scratching your head about his change of heart.<br />The cast, as I said earlier, is brilliant in this film. The expanded plot lines and twists only enhance the experience.<br />The only detractor is that the sound is a touch funny in the film. In a few scenes, Harrison Ford sounds like he is having an asthma attacks instead of breathing. <br />Other than that, it is a superb film with amazing one liners.
B00009TB5G|1.0|I am just kidding. This movie is so good what does my review even matter. This movie already won a HUGO AWARD. so did that last one. Christ!!!!!! is it my life's dream to write a noval, or screen play to a movie that wins a Hugo award.<br />OK Look let me put it this way. This movie gets SIX stars buy me. ANYTHING that wins a HUGO award is game in my book. At this point in life the only books I read are books that won either\or the nebula award or the HUGO award. Well this moive won\WILL win the award. What else do you need. HUGO means BEST OF THE BEST OF THE BEST of the BEST. christ!!!!. GET this movie. are you joking how could you NOT LIKE IT. EPIC stories are the thrid reason hummans where put on this earth. just so you know the first reason we were put here was to figure this BALL of earth out, the second is succeed to our greastest potentical using the formentiond info, and the third is to create GREAT fiction\art\imagniation. This movie does that as if god commanded the crew to do so.......
0800179501|5.0|In 2004 this movie will be 20 years old.  Certainly, some of its cultural references have aged a bit, but the soul of this movie and its core themes hold up just fine.  My younger kids, who are karate students, enjoy this movie a great deal.  Ralph Macchio gives Danny a nice combination of fear, resentment, vulnerability, and charm that make him live as a good kid trying to make it in a new school and a new life in a strange place.<br />This movie rises most on the portrayal of Mr. Miyagi by Pat Morita.  A very fine actor in a very fine role.  He brings some complexity and pathos to the character.  He makes his befriending of Danny believable.  His mourning for his lost wife and child who died in an internment camp while he was off winning a Medal of Honor defending the country that imprisoned and neglected his family is powerfully moving.<br />Elisabeth Shue, who has gone on to some wonderful things, is also pretty good here as the girl from the right side of the tracks who is attracted to Danny because she sees a lot of good in him while her peers only see the poor skinny kid.  Randee Heller is very good as Danny's Mom who means well but is a somewhat clueless (maybe willfully so) about why Danny doesn't want to be in this new place and why push starting the car as she chaperone's Danny and Ali on a date in front of her rich snooty parents might cause Danny real pain.  I mean what could she do about it except just push ahead like everything is just fine?<br />This is a movie adults can enjoy.  However, parents would enjoy it even more watching it with their children.  I think young adolescents are a perfect audience or this movie's lessons.  They haven't become too cool, yet and will find the story resonates with the trials they are facing in their young lives.

I can't lose it this way :)<br />It truly is wonderful to be able to access jane Austen's novels without having to search through the whole house.<br />Besides, I saved money by buying this compilation. Maybe I could have gotten the individual novels on-line for a cheaper price, but how much more would I have paid for shipping?<br />What condition would they have arrived in?<br />Would they have looked as good on my Coffee table?<br />Could they have doubled as a night stand for my aero bed when I went camping?<br />It really is a good deal. Buy it for yourself.
B00009V7T2|5.0|Scrolling down, looking at the other customer reviews, i noticed a trend.  All either seemed to love it or strongly dislike it, which I found very interesting.  In my opinion, it is better for people to feel this way about an album than thinking it's 'pretty good' or 'decent'.  When people feel strongly about something, and stay away from the mediocre evaluations, it shows that true ART has been created.<br />Personally, I loved this album, and feel that it is one of the best of all time.  It is no easy listen, filled with thick bursts of instrumental chaos and lyrics that are sometimes quite disturbing.  Nevertheless, it is a very rewarding listen and I suggest everyone to listen to this album.  Every single song is amazing.  <br />Don't expect an extension of At the Drive-in, this is something on it's own.  It is 100 times better then what was done at At the Drive-in.<br />As already established, some people will love it, others will hate it, but you decide and download a song or listen to a sample before you buy the album.
B00005OM4N|5.0|I own this album and believe that everybody should give it a listen before they decide that they don't like it.<br />Stop drinking the haterade.

B000059QYB|5.0|Had this Billy Idol collection come out in 1991 instead of 2001, it probably would have sold a couple of million copies easy, instead of barely nicking the Billboard album chart.  From 1981 to 1990, Idol - with his his spiked hair and exaggerated sneer - made punk palatable to the masses via a series of entertaining videos that were featured on MTV.  With images ingrained in the viewer's head, the music from these videos subsequently crossed over to radio.<br />Idol got his professional start in the music business with the punk band Generation X and it is his bopping remake of their &quot;Dancing With Myself&quot; - from his 1981 ep DON'T STOP - that starts off this collection.  Also included here from DON'T STOP is his studio rendition of the Tommy James and the Shondells' hit &quot;Mony Mony&quot; (I prefer Idol's livelier, live version that topped the charts - from 1987's otherwise unvital VITAL IDOL - to this enclosed version).<br />It was with 1982's BILLY IDOL album that Idol emerged as a major video and radio personality with the sassy &quot;Hot In The City,&quot; and, especially, the gothic &quot;White Wedding&quot; (the latter is represented by its less satisfying single edit).  1983's REBEL YELL was Idol's most varied album ever as well as his most hit-filled, with the guitar-driven title track, the eerie &quot;Eyes Without A Face,&quot; the earnest, pure pop &quot;Catch My Fall,&quot; and his most punkish solo recording &quot;Flesh For Fantasy.&quot;<br />1986's WHIPLASH SMILE - Idol's homage to Elvis Presley - gave us the hits &quot;To Be A Lover,&quot; &quot;Sweet Sixteen,&quot; and &quot;Don't Need A Gun,&quot; while 1990's CHARMED LIFE gave us Idol the rocker with scorching takes on the original &quot;Cradle Of Love&quot; and the Doors' &quot;L.A. Woman.&quot;  1993's CYBERPUNK was a noisy mess (and Idol's last studio album to date) and its lone representative here &quot;Shock To The System&quot; is the weakest track on this set.<br />GREATEST HITS concludes with an unnecessary acoustic version of &quot;Rebel Yell&quot; (I'd have rather seen Idol's haunting CHARMED LIFE single &quot;Prodigal Blues&quot; and/or his riproaring theme for the hit film SPEED included here instead) and a faithful remake of the Simple Minds' hit &quot;Don't You (Forget About Me).&quot;  &quot;Don't You&quot; was originally intended for Idol back in 1985 when it was included in the BREAKFAST CLUB film and it is easy to see why Simple Minds got the nod after Idol declined, as Idol and Simple Minds' singer Jim Kerr have extremely similar voices (Idol's being a bit higher and raspier).  It is great to have Idol finally tackle it himself as the song suits him well.<br />With GREATEST HITS, we finally got a decent Billy Idol collection here in the US (the British got IDOL SONGS - which was comprised of his first 11 singles - in 1988).  These recordings serve as a great reminder of the fun Idol's unique personality brought to MTV and the radio during the '80s and early '90s.  They still sound particularly nifty in the car.
6305212112|5.0|There's really nothing not to like here. Everything comes together like a Renoir painting. It's a gentle, beautiful film about friendship and how relationships can help us grow as human beings. It's lovely to look at. The sequences from 1930's Alabama are lush and rich in lighting, color and costume (outstanding cinematography by Geoffrey Simpson). Fanny Flagg's and Carol Sobieski's script is moving as the characters lack Southern rural stereotypes and are displayed as individuals and real people. <br />As expected, excellent performances from Kathy Bates, Jessica Tandy, Mary Stuart Masterson and Mary-Louise Parker. Anyone of them could have walked away with an Oscar. To Ms. Parker's credit, her performance here could have catapulted her to vast commercial success, yet she followed her muse and heart via the theater instead. Although the various stories and themes are interesting, funny, nostalgic and sometimes tragic, the film is driven more by the characters and how the Evelyn/Ninny relationship (Bates/Tandy) parallels Ruth/Idgie (Parker/Masterson). It never bores as the characters and settings are so richly portrayed.<br />Director Jon Avnet, his cast and crew are to be congratulated. Fried Green Tomatoes is truly a work of art, one of the best films of the 1990's.
B0000AKCLS|5.0|I became a fan of Joe Bonamassa after hearing songs from his first cd \\"A New Day Yesterday\\" and his followup cd  \\"So its like That\\"   and was blown away after seeing the live concert footage on the enclosed DVD. and I am happy to say that this new cd is even better!!.....\\"Blues Deluxe\\" is a great mix of Blues covers and original music done in Bonamassa Style...great vocals and guitarwork. He has come a long way from his first recordings ..and will only get better.
B00003CXSP|2.0|The rumour is that Scott originally turned down this project as he heard the title and imagined that it was another historical epic. More's the pity, as this really is the emperor without any clothes, as the director turns in another classy effort, full of his usual cinematographic skill and care, but a film which is ultimately ugly and unnecessary. This is a series in decline: inititially there was the striking Manhunter, featuring an excellent Brian Cox as Lecter; then Jonathan Demme's slightly overrated but still enjoyable Silence of The Lambs. It has been a profitable franchise that just had to continue, and the new film has all the hallmarks of being cobbled together as an excuse to extend a unconvincing course of events even further, while leaving the door open for a fourth installment. <br />Hannibal falls into three broad sections: first the professional disgrace of Agent Starling; then the discovery and trap set for Lecter in Italy; finally the confrontation in America. Hannibal's presence (as he is now the star of the show) is delayed until quite a few minutes into the picture. Scriptwriter Mamet obviously thought it a good idea and as a way to build up suspense. There's no doubt that there's tension in the air as we await his arrival. It also enables some filling in of Starling's character and motivation. But the opening action scenes are a distraction, the events they portray are never referred to again. By the end of the film it is obvious what they were: narrative padding, deferring the arrival of the main event. Mamet later even has dialogue bathetically undermining the seriousness of what has happened: The Guinness Book of Records congratulates Starling on being the Female FBI agent who has `shot the most people' -  a ludicrous moment.<br />The problem is that Hannibal's insouciant malevolence is almost entirely static by nature. One thinks of the evil he suggests, regularly in situ in Manhunter's prison cell, or Hopkin's usual calm movements as an actor. Hannibal strolls and discourses, never hurries or panics. He is the civilised chef or lecturer, standing or being wheeled out in front of people, leisurely lighting candles or preparing a ghastly repast; what he is not is dynamic. Hannibal is an action picture constructed around a slow moving centre, and the result is mostly dull. Even the mutilated, fish-faced Mason Verger (an unrecognisable Gary Oldman) is unfortunately bed or wheelchair-ridden - hardly the dynamic opposition required. A chase or two, perhaps more of the manhunt in action for the most wanted Doctor might have leavened the pace a little. Instead, in Verger's watery eyed prosthetics we experience some of the imaginative exhaustion of a series which is feeding upon itself.<br />By far the most interesting part of the film occurs in Italy, where the avaristic Inspector Pazzi (Giancarlo Gianni, in his most high profile film since the cult Seven Beauties (1976)) discovers Hannibal's identity and plots to secure his capture for the reward himself. But, sadly, Gianni's hangdog charisma as an actor notwithstanding (oh why couldn't he have been cast as Starling's boss, and the wolfish Ray Liotta be the Italian cop?) this is a section fatally drained of tension. It is clear that he will meet his fate at the hands of Lector, who is too smart to fall for this sort of mid-film trap; we even know the likely cause of his murder, so heavily is the emphasis on the grisly death of his ancestor. All Pazzi can do is to listlessly plot and smoke until his game is up - a moment admittedly lightened by Lecter's quizzical `Entrails in or out?' - while the gore-starved audience is denied more of the suggestion made by the killer that he would eat the wife.<br />There's a scene in the cult exploitation flick `Bloodsucking Freaks' (1976), in which a mad doctor gleefully sucks a victim's brains out through a straw. One is irresistably reminded of this at the end of Hannibal, except that the original, Sadean, justification is replaced here by a jokey, gourmet one. For all of Lecter's weird and compulsive romancing of Starling (which by the next installment will no doubt develop into something more reciprocal), the ending, with the cranial work on Krendler (Liotta) is absurd. Liotta, excellently manic in Goodfellas (1990), good in so many other films, looks embarrassed mouthing his goofy remarks, and one is not surprised. Was this kitchen cabinet of horrors really written by Mamet? From lecher to Lecter's leftovers, Krendelr's role is an unthankful one, the actor's usual dynamism restricted to sexist remarks within smart team briefings and enclosed spaces. But Krendler-Liotta still seems more immediately dangerous to Starling than the good doctor ever does, which is one indication of the way that Lecter has been reduced in stature as each installment has progressed downwards. Like Freddy Kruger, Jason Vorhees and Michael Myers before him, familiarity has bred contempt, and Dr Lecter has lost much of the edge as a villain he once had.<br />None of Scott's excellent lighting, or Zimmer's outstanding score, can make a silk purse out of a sow's ear, any more than Hopkin's restrained acting style can make Krendler's brain much of a delicacy to be relished. Moments of true horror, like the man eating hogs, do stand out amidst the general dullness, but these are too far between to save a film which leaves those who expected better with a bad taste in the mouth.
B00005JLTN|4.0|The Matrix reloaded is not a bad movie but it was a bit of a disappointment. While I did enjoy the movie overall, I felt that there were too many references to Superman. Granted that this is Warner Brothers and they made the Superman movies but I think the references to Superman should have been left out.<br />Also I did not like the idea that Zion is constantly destroyed and then rebuilt. What is up with that? It is explained as a flaw in the program and that Neo's purpose is to fix the issues that exist with the Matrix. I guess these coders who wrote the Matrix software must have taken programming lessons from the Microsoft programmers who write Winblows..umm...Windows. <br />The special effects with the french guys and some of the action scenes were nicely done but overall the movie left me wanting more and I hope that the third movie is better than the second one. It should be interesting to see how they wrap this all up. Will humanity win? Will the AI of the Matrix win? Will the two sides get together and play nice? Who knows? Only the shadow knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men (or machines) :)
B00009W0WM|5.0|This DVD release is everything you could hope for. I do have an issue with Roger Ebert's commentary, though. Why would he consider as his &quot;favorite&quot; film one in which he relentlessly and cruelly derides one of the three leads? I think Paul Henreid is as wonderful as everyone else in &quot;Casablanca&quot;...his acting style is nowhere near the dated, stiff performance found in other films of this era. He is noble and urbane, and a necessary contrast to Bogart's deeply conflicted character. If there is a choice to be made, one has to perceive a difference between the two men. The business about &quot;reading off a cue card&quot; undermines the reasoning for selection as one of the best films of all time. (Rather, I have always found Bogart to be a great presence, but not an actor of significant range, and &quot;Casablanca&quot; stretches him just beyond his limits.) To say that Henreid and Bergman have no chemistry is to call into question the strength of the triangle, which I find to be very solid. If Victor was as flawed and &quot;lovable&quot; a character as Rick, would we care so much which one she wound up with? Henreid's stoic persona is expressed with great subtlety and finesse, and is a benchmark for screen elegance.
0375805613|5.0|Grover was always my favorite Sesame Street character and I always loved this book as a child.  My parents saved all my children's books and I love reading this one to my son.  I need to get the board book version though.  My old one is getting torn up!  We also like the new version with Elmo!
B00000ADG2|5.0|This has got to be one of the moust soulful albums I have ever heard.  She has a awesome voice, I can still remember her in Sister Act 2.... The standout track is definitely Zion, no wonder she hasn't put out a follow up yet 'cause how the hell can you follow up this album?
B0000A0DRY|4.0|All the accolades afforded this album over the years are well justified--and if you're reading this, I'm sure you've heard (and likely experienced for yourself) them all.  This is truly one of the greatest albums not only of the Sixties &amp; the folk-rock/psychedelic era, but of the entire pop music era period!  That said, I'm afraid we've yet to see the ultimate cd issue of this masterpiece--though this latest one offers the added attraction of four songs not on the original LP, three of which were cut during the &quot;Pillow&quot; sessions.  Airplane aficianados are well familiar with all these tracks (scattered through various compilations over time), but in fact, the extra tracks are really the only reason to purchase this edition of the album, if you don't already own one of the more recent issues.  The real killer in the bonus bunch is &quot;Go To Her,&quot; a showcase for Marty Balin's soulful wail, and a song more than deserving of inclusion on the original album.  You'll also hear Jorma Kaukonen step out front on an original blues &quot;in The Morning,&quot; as well as on an excellent reading of Lightning Hopkins' &quot;Come Back Baby,&quot; the latter actually recorded a few weeks after the album came out.  Further, there's an unlisted bonus cut at the end, an instrumental run-through of &quot;B.C.D.A. -25,&quot; on which Paul Kantner's 12-string rhythm playing takes the spotlight.<BR>     All that said, I want to caution you: If you're looking for an improved-quality recording of this album over the gold disk, the 1996 issue or the 2001 issue, you ain't gonna get it here!  That's not to say it doesn't sound good, rather to say it's not been improved upon.  Fans are well aware of the differences between the mono and stereo mixes of the album: It's great to have both, but this version only has two of the mono mixes (the two monster hit singles.)  As for the standard stereo mix, all the tape hiss is still there, not to mention the early fade-outs on the tracks which go on a little longer on the mono album.  I've thought for quite a long time that this album begs to be remixed, from top to bottom, from the original four-track masters.  Perhaps that'll be done someday--either after someone gets smart or after someone dies!  Fact is, the bonus tracks (all of which are in stereo outside of the two singles) are technically of higher quality than those from the original album. <BR>     In the meantime, to reiterate: If you have one of the above-mentioned issues of this album, the bonus tracks are really the only reason you may want to purchase this one.  They were my reason; I needed them and am quite pleased with them.  And oh yes: The liner notes are very good--with stories behind and recording info about--all the tracks, but of course, you can't play the liner notes!
B00005JKLZ|5.0|I loved this version.  Not only did it have a great twist on the original story line but it took you a huge step further by adding the twist -- which was changing the future.  However, this is where I got lost in the story.  I have seen this movie five times over the last few years and I have figured out all the other confusing questions.  But I have not been able to figure out how he was able to \\"change the future\\" by doing something to his pocket watch, placing the watch inside the time machine in such a way that it jammed the time machine gears, and setting the time machine to either go backwards or forward in time, which destroyed the Morelocks and their underground caves completely and by those events changed the future for 800,000 years to come.  ...<br />Richard ---
B00003CXXJ|2.0|My husband and I agree -- this movie is not for the whole family!  This is one of those cartoons (like the Simpsons) that is just not for kids.  It is very crude.  I gave it two stars because it did have a few funny parts, but I won't be seeing it again and I certainly won't let my son see it.
B00005JKHP|5.0|Thrilling special f/x, and great cinematography make up for this awesome movie!
B00003CX95|5.0|Directed and produced by Mel Gibson who's also playing the lead role, this movie not only won 5 Oscars including Best Director-Mel Gibson, and Best Picture 1995, but it is without question one of the greatest and most dramatic movies ever made.<BR>This story takes place in the late 13th century.<BR>William Wallace (Mel Gibson) returns to his native Scotland after living away for many years only to find his beloved land terrorized by a cold-blooded and ruthless king of England known as Edward the Longshanks. <BR>Disturbed by the misery and suffering of his people Wallace rises to oppose the cruel king. After his beautiful wife, whom he secretly married so he wouldn't have to share her with the king is brutally murdered by the English soldiers, Wallace becomes a leader of a rapidly growing group of Scottish men determined to fight the king's army and get their freedom back. \\"Tell our enemies, that they may take our lives... but they will never take away... our FREEDOM!!!\\" After winning a number of battles, Wallace quickly becomes a respected warrior, hailed by his people and feared by his enemies. Respected for his undeniable courage, strength and intelligence, he's on a quest for vengeance and freedom. <BR>Braveheart is a heart-breaking story blended with love, hate, courage, betrayal and an incredible patriotism. It is a story that will stay in your heart forever. <BR>\\"EVERY MAN DIES, NOT EVERY MAN REALLY LIVES.\\"
0375823360|1.0|I read through the first book without a worry! It was a great book! And I was soo obssessed with it! I thought it was even better then Harry Potter. But then I started on the second book...And it began to talk about plots to kill God. In the end...Well...Lets say it didn't end preety.<br />  I say this is not a good book for christains,Jews, or anybody who follows a religon dealing with God. I also don't recomend this for people who are lost without a religon or un sure about it...This may just waver you in the wrong direction.
B00005JL96|5.0|I bought this for my son the day it was released on DVD.  I'm sad to say that my little boy didn't like it.  He does like his talking Stitch that he got for Christmas, though.  I loved this movie.  It has some really cute characters and a great message.  Ohana means family and family means no one gets left behind.  It's a really sweet movie!
B0000AI44Q|5.0|There are two Neil's the cortez, the cinnamon girl the crazy horse bouncing off your wall and shaking the plaster from the frames Neil. The power chord gut check that moves your head and rattles your bones in standard time. Then there's the toe tapping neil, the philosopher, the road companion, the Canadian Keruoac that makes you want to pack up and take a longer look at the world, take a little more time, slow down, listen more. That's this Neil, that's what this album speaks, in a world of background music this album makes you pay attention! It's beautiful, it's harvest moon, it's silver and gold but has its own voice- it's a sunset dream, it's a conversation, it's georgeous and if you love neil for all that he is, then you'll love this album as well.
B00005JKZV|4.0|This movie is amazing. It is the visually pleasing sequel to the movie adaption of one of the most amazing movies of all time: Fellowship of the Ring. Tolkien's world is again brought to life by an amazing cast and technological crew. This second portion of the tale brings excitement, some interesting character development for new characters like Gollum, Wormtongue, and Éowyn, as well as enhancement of the stories of Frodo and Sam, Merry and Pippin, and Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli. Although this movie is interesting and truly other-worldly, it immerses viewers in a world very different from that of the \\"Fellowship\\". This second installment does feature good, emotionally intense moments (Frodo's further breakdown with the Ring, Gollum's dual nature, and Arwen's choice for a life with Aragorn contrary to the wishes of Elrond), but it does not have the same fantasy, dream-like feel of the first one. We will not marvel at the splendor of an Elfin palace nor feel at home in the Shire with Bilbo and Gandalf. Instead, we will watch a panoramic battle-sequence that speeds up the heartbeat but does not fill the heart entirely. The pacing of the movie is choppy at some points, but wonderful moments like Gandalf's assistance at Helm's Deep and the last march of the Ents bring back the feel of Middle-Earth. Some parts could have been avoided (Spoilers to follow....)<BR>like Haldir's death, Aragorn's fall, and a few other moments. I will not nitpick, because these movies take a grand amount of effort, but keeping in more of the basic chapters of the Two Towers book would make the pacing a little better. (Why don't Merry and Pippin meet up with Aragorn and the others?!). All in all, a great movie that is immersing and worth watching again.
B00009Y3L4|2.0|What a huge disappointment this 2003 DVD reissue is. It's in non-anamorphic widescreen, which basically means that the letterbox bars are part of the image signal.  HDTV owners with 16:9 sets will be most affected, but anyone who plan on upgrading to HDTV anytime in the future should avoid making this DVD a part of their permanent library. People with newer-model, higher-end standard definition TV's will also be negatively impacted. Why did Warners go to all the trouble of reissuing this classic without doing a better job?<br />The film itself is one of the finest musicals ever made. If you're a fan, consider renting to get your Cabaret fix. If you feel you must buy it, plan on selling this edition at a future garage sale when the next reissue comes out.
B00005JKDR|5.0|I bought this for my son shortly after he turned 2.  My husband and I saw Monsters Inc in the theatre, so we knew what to expect.  We eased our son into it by watching all the bonus footage and outtakes.  By the time the movie started, my son was hooked!  He watches this movie at least once a week.  His favorite bonus footage is &quot;The Birds.&quot;  This is another great movie from Pixar -- can't wait for the next one!  I just wish I could find Monsters Inc toys.  After they recalled Sulley with Boo, they never came out with any new ones. Oh well....  we love this movie!
0064471837|5.0|When I read this story I nearly cried. With her fathers ultimate sacrifice and the hardships Sabriel went through. I loved Mogget. He added alot to the story with his sarcastic humor and surprising actions. Sabriel was a very good character. Seemingly a regular teenager, well as normal as you can be as a charter mage in a city of magic and mystery, when her life takes an unexpected turn when finding her father becomes a journey of a lifetime that turns her into a responsible adult with the most important duty in the Old Kingdom. I loved this story. Email me if you did too!!!!
B00006RIO7|5.0|Why is everybody complaining about Renee's voice? Catherine's voice was very powerful and captivating but Renee's voice was mischievous and charming. The soundtrack is absolutely awesome but I wish they had cuts without the dialogue- like the one with &quot;Funny Honey&quot;. Also &quot;Nowadays&quot; was left unfinished like in the movie. I would've loved to here the song in full. Usually people buy the soundtrack because they like a song or two but with Chicago you'll find yourself listening to the entire CD... or at leat 80% of it. I want a sequel to this movie now just so I could hear more of the lovely singing!
B000000993|5.0|What can be said about Tool's music that hasn't been said already? Dark, mysterious, beautiful, intellegent, complex, great. (And I can assure you, this is NOT sarcasm.) If you ask me, NOBODY does it like Maynard James Keenan and company. NOBODY. <br />This was Tool's first full-length LP, and it is probably the heaviest. (It's not extremely heavy, like Pantera, but it's still solid rock.) I'll just touch on a few favorite tracks of mine:<br />\\"Intolerance\\"...great opening song. Especially with that sound in the beginning...creepy.<BR>\\"Prison Sex\\" is a solid rocker about child abuse, with some disturbing lyrics.<BR>\\"Sober\\"...here it is, the album's swan song. \\"Why can't we not be sober/I just want to start this over\\"...this song is so beautiful, it's not funny. (I'm dead serious.) Another thing that Tool and only a few others do: combine beauty and heaviness in the same song. Bravo, Tool, bravo. This was a huge single for a reason.<BR>\\"Crawl Away\\"...possibly the hardest on the album. I love it.<BR>\\"Swamp Song\\"...probably the angriest. \\"I hope it sucks you, [if-I-write-the-word-I-get-deported], I hope it sucks you down!!\\" Pretty easy to relate to it.<BR>\\"Disgustipated\\"...I don't really consider it a song, but it's just so fun to listen to. It starts on Track 69, and you just hear sheep baaing. Then, in comes some preacher going on about the \\"cries of the carrots\\". Funny stuff. Then, Maynard repeats over and over, \\"This is necessary/Life feeds on life feeds on\\". I think it's about the hypocrisy of organized religion.<br />Anyway, I definitely recommend this one, provided you already have Aenima.
0385504209|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read in a long time.  It made me want to research religion, secret sects, look at paintings by Da Vinci, and go back to Paris!  I wish a screenwriter would pick this up &amp; work that Hollywood magic - It would make a fantastic movie!  I couldn't put it down!
0790729350|5.0|I love janis joplin and seeing her preform 'work me lord' is the most wonderful thing I've ever seen. It sends chills up my spine, I love the song and watching her is like watching an angel. If you love janis half as much as I do, you've got to buy this. I rented the video, and had to buy the dvd because I can watch her over and over again and it never loses its magic. BUY IT!!!!
B00005JLSE|5.0|I thought this movie was excellent.  I have seen it twice and I have the CD and play it continuously.  The acting by all the characters is superb and I would recommend it highly.  I normally do not buy DVD movies but this one was a keeper!!!
B000002N2Z|5.0|Sorry if that header sounds a little cheesy, but it's true.<br />In 1995, the Deftones started their incredible career with &quot;Adrenaline&quot;. Yes, it's their debut album, which is why it sounds so raw. But the rawness only adds to the greatness. From the moment Chino's lyrics first emerge (&quot;Hear me spit on you, wither I...&quot;) overtop quiet, shredding riffs in &quot;Bored&quot;, you know this is going to be a great album. Chino Moreno, IMHO, is one of the most underrated vocalists ever. This guy goes from a quiet whisper, to a furious scream, to angelic crooning...all in the same song. Can Good Charlotte do that? Didn't think so.<br />Some of my favorite tracks include...actually, all of them. Yes, my friends, this is one of the few CD's in my collection that I can listen to all the way through without skipping any tracks. Every song on here is great. This album is raw, angry, beautiful, catchy, hard-hitting emo-core metal. And when it comes to that music genre, NO ONE does it like the 'Tones. (You listening, Finch?) It's not quite as heavy as &quot;Around The Fur&quot;, or as breathtaking as &quot;White Pony&quot; (&quot;Deftones&quot; is good too), but it does have a nice combination of the two, and it definitely should be in your collection, even if your favorite music is free-form jazz.<br />&quot;You know I want to pick you up, but they don't want you to...&quot;
B00009EIQE|5.0|I bought the CD and noticed the John Lee Hooker style, then i looked in the little album book - and read \\"In memory of John Lee Hooker\\".<BR>So i guess this album is kind of a tribute to The Boogie Man, and i like it.<BR>This is old style real blues. Listen to it and enjoy. This is a real treat.
B000002J1U|5.0|This album just kicks in!! I mean, their other stuff is brilliant as well, but no.III is simply the best album, they'e ever recorded!! It starts off with this kicking 'immigrant song', starting with this quite simple but rocking riff, and the beat's just brilliant! This smashing 2min. rock number is followed by 'friends', a rather mellow but weird piece of music, that surprises with its strings, which can be heard all of a sudden. And then another brilliant number: 'Celebration Day' fast, straight Zeppelin rock!!! The fourth track is another mellow, bluesy tune: 'Since i've been loving you'. The fifth song(last song on side one from the LP)'OUT ON THE TILES'!! first of all THAT'S my all-time zeppelin favourite and another thing is, it just rounds side one up so specially! This song's guitar riff is fantastic, and the chorus of the song is simply the best i've heard from those guys. some may think i'm stupid, because there are a lot of other tracks on this album, that are of more complexicity, but maybe it's really the rocky stuff, that made LZ to what they are now!! well, i'm tired of writing, so i just quickly say that the rest of the album is just as good, filled with lots of blues and folklore!! oh, man!! Once you've listened to it, you'll fall in love!!! well, that's it!!<BR>bye<BR>martin
B00005JLD4|5.0|Phillip Noyce's Rabbit-Proof Fence is an example of movie making for others to follow.  For those interested in making a movie based on true expierences and hsitorical events, then watch this piece of work that is artistically compelling and both emotionally draining and uplifting.<br />To often, movies based on true events take too many liberities with a astory that both history and the essence of the events are missed and often, what develops is an artistic vision that bares little resemblance to the &quot;real thing.&quot; (Think of The Untouchables or Nixon) This cheats the viewers who wish to connect with people of the past.  Noyce avoids all this by hiring actors like Kenneth Branaugh who turn in a perfect performance and childern to act who are not professionally trained, but come from the backgroud of the people he wishes to portray.<br />The story is about Molly Craig, a 14 year &quot;half-caste&quot; who is taken from her mother to be inculcated into the &quot;white system&quot; of Austriala's government.  She is abducted with her sister and cousain.  The cousian, Gracie, ends up being recaptured by the police, but Molly and her sister triumphantly return home.<br />This movie is so well done, that knowing the plot before hand does not discourage the viewer.  At times, one is emtionaly drained and at the end, we are both happy and sad.  The film score by Peter Gabriel's score is outstanding.  A beautiful viewing expiernce.
6305127638|5.0|In my opinion, this is the best of the Star Trek films. It has everything! If you like any Star Trek film, series or action film, you will love this film. Although I am a huge Star Trek fan, I believe this will appeal to the none-fan as well. Hell. I think everyone will love this film! It appealed to me because it has the two main things that appeal to me in Star Trek. The Borg and time travel, in that order. This film is a must see
B000001FA4|5.0|This is likely to be my favorite album by U2. Overshadowed by it's follow-up &quot;Joshua Tree&quot; I have to say that &quot;Unforgettable Fire&quot; is my favorite album by U2. &quot;Bad&quot; is just a marvelous and haunting track, and the title track is just amazing. The two tracks &quot;Promenade&quot; and &quot;Fourth Of July&quot; are amazing songs. Buy this album today! It's great and worth having.
B000021Y7X|5.0|OK, this isn't really a review.  Yeah, I agree with everyone else:  it's an awesome production, but what I wanna know:  Is there anything special about the DVD edition?  I've had this on VHS since I was seven.  Is there any reason to upgrade?
B000002UUX|5.0|Megadeth was at one point one of the most talented thrash bands ever, even dwarfing Dave Mustaine's former bandmates in Metallica (he left before Kill 'Em All was released). You had the stellar technical guitarwork of Mustaine and Marty Friedman (easily a better duo than Hetfield and Hammett), Dave Ellefson's great bass playing, and the fantastic drumming of Nick Menza (they credit him with \\"lead drums\\" for a reason).<br /><br />With all this talent you'd figure that Megadeth would be at the top of the thrash heap, but Megadeth is not the most consistent metal band out there, nor is Dave the most consistent songwriter. Frequently Megadeth has played second banana to the greatness of Metallica, but this album dispels that trend. Rust In Peace is easily the best Megadeth release, blowing away all albums before and after it, even Peace Sells..<br /><br />This is a guitarist's album like no other. Every riff is mindblowing, and the solos are incredible. Check out the lightning-fast solos toward the end of Holy Wars...The Punishment Due, the cool opening riffs of Lucretia, and the incredible last 3 minutes of Hanger 18 (one of metal's greatest guitar showcases). Mustaine's vocals are a bit rough and can't be compared to greats like Bruce Dickinson, but the lyrics display some biting black humor amid the visuals of war and destruction. \\"Military intelligence/Two words put together, that can't make sense...\\"<br /><br />Rust In Peace is almost completely relentless, the only slow song being the weird and short Dawn Patrol. This is Megadeth in their element--fast, raw, and \\"take no prisoners,\\" a personality which would not be displayed often after Countdown To Extinction. Pick this up NOW.
0316666343|5.0|This book is truly a marvelous story that no bookshelf should be without. Not only does the book focus on death and heaven. It also focuses on families working together to overcome grief. Teen girls will find the narrator recollecting her experiences as a young girl and it will touch them to see that their own experiences are represented through the novel. (school, boys, friends, etc.) I recommend this book to anyone with an open heart.
B00005QG9J|5.0|i can proudly say that incubus is my favourite band. and mv will prove it. along with s.c.i.e.n.c.e. this is my fave cd of all time. i would give both this and s.c.i.e.n.c.e. 6 stars if i could, fungus amongus 5 and make yourself 4. but back to mv. while i was going through the many reviews i came to a couple idiots claiming this was incubus' sellout album and even that s.o.d. is better cuz they sold more albums. this album is lyrically amazing, and sounds awesome. the quality is terrific (we can thank mike for that) and the musicianship is something to be proud of. each song was obviously written and recorded with great care. just watch the mv sessions (dvd). some people say it's horrible cuz it's \\"so different from the last\\". well, each album is different from the last, so go out and buy all of them! listen to pistola and megalomaniac (from lollapalooza) and you'll hear a whole new cd coming out next. - miranda
B00009RDG9|2.0|Not sure what hollywood was thinking when they cast these 2 fine actor's in a FIRST BLOOD..meets the FUGITIVE flick but oh well.Although it has some interesting action,fight,and Chase sequences that doesnt save this movie.There are far to many FAR FETCHED moments in this movie,one(squirrel track and racoon tracks)in the front yard El Toro pronouces to the little girl of his one time girlfriends in the movie(and remember they are in the suburbs here).Various rediculous falling scenes,over water falls..off bridges etc.And lets not forget the final fight scene wear Jones and Toro slash 20 holes in one another's bodies but still manage not to Pass out or bleed to death from losing pints of blood.So all in all this movie has everthing ridiculous except a flying dragon.So definate thumbs down to two GREAT actors in a very disappointing film.
B000067CPX|5.0|This album is beautiful. Even though &quot;By the Way&quot; had gotten a lot of airplay, I still cannot help singing along to it whenver I listen to it. A lot of people here have expressed their love for By the Way, Dosed, the Zephyr Song, Can't Stop, i.e. songs that have gotten a lot of airplay. However, don't make the grave mistake of buying this CD just for those songs, even though those songs are great. There are other beautiful songs on this album, such as the hauntingly beautiful &quot;Midnight&quot;, the catchiness of &quot;Minor Thing&quot;, the soothing &quot;I Could Die for You&quot; and &quot;Universally Speaking&quot;. However, the real gem of this album has to be &quot;Venice Queen&quot;. Please listen to the whole song, even if the beginning might be slow to you. The song throws you in a loop and you come out of listening to it knowing that you have just experienced musical genius. Beautiful
B00004SZWD|5.0|Anyone who says this is Stevie's best, I won't argue too strongly. I thought that for a long time too. But I've been listening & thinking about it for nearly 18 years, and I now believe \\"Innervisions\\" holds that distinction. \\"Innervisions\\" is a masterpiece, SITKOL is not, due to reasons I'll go into below. And yet, SITKOL has some of Stevie's very best music, so I probably will continue to go back and forth on the issue, in my mind. Ultimately though, it's irrelevant to compare it to other albums. SITKOL has so much truly amazing music that it will forever be in history as one of the top 10 albums anyone ever made, in any genre of music. But it has it's share of annoyances, too.<br />One problem I have with it is Stevie's inability to edit himself on some of these songs, like Black Man, Isn't She Lovely, and Joy Inside My Tears. They go on far too long after the story has been told, without much progress, even getting tedious toward the end. Also, the tired \\"black people are mistreated & downtrodden\\" theme crops up way too many times. Being proud of your race is fine, but thinking you speak for an entire race is arrogant, and devoting too many songs on an album to it is detrimental to the album as a whole. Black Man was just a bad idea to begin with (and poorly executed), and Village Ghetto Land was already done on Talking Book, and much better, as Big Brother. The line about children eating dog food is pathetic and poorly written. VGL is the worst song on the album, it doesn't fit, and stands out like a sore thumb. When you're working as hard as Stevie obviously was on making a classic album, you have to avoid stuff like that, and he didn't. He wanted to make his point, and he let the album's quality go down because of it.<br />Similarly, the religious stuff bothers me too. Stevie's strength is writing songs that appeal to all different kinds of people. You shouldn't have to be the same religion as him, or religious at all, to appreciate his music, yet he requiresthat in some songs on SITKOL, for example \\"Have A Talk With God\\" and \\"Pastime Paradise\\". I believe he got carried away with the religious & racial issues that concern him, and his music suffered because of it. Those songs tend to be less interesting musically, because Stevie was so intent on getting his message across that he focused more on the words. I guess when he was writing a lot of these songs, he was thinking that only black christians would be listening to them. He was overly zealous about it and ended up causing people who aren't in those categories to tune out those particular songs. Even today, he continues to be a great songwriter who makes good albums, not great, because on every one he can't stop himself from including two or three songs about god and the mistreatment of black people, which drag his albums down like a Spike Lee movie. Message to Stevie: if you want to make a gospel album, just DO it, stop trying to make your albums part gospel. We expect sophisticated, life-loving, pop music from you, not lectures about racial issues and religion. I deeply appreciate you as a musician, but I wonder if your strong personal & spiritual views have been holding you back from making great albums like you did in the 70's. Slavery was many years ago, it's time to move on to new topics.<br />He does far better on the songs which celebrate life, nature, & love. Those songs are the true heart of SITKOL. What was originally Side 4 of the album is the most beautiful suite of songs he ever wrote: Ngiculela, If It's Magic, As, Another Star. Stunning, sophisticated music, unequalled by anyone else to date (including Stevie), as far as I'm concerned. If you're a songwriter/musician and you want to learn, listen to those. The other standouts are Sir Duke, I Wish, Summer Soft, Knocks Me Off My Feet, & Isn't She Lovely. The rest of the songs I haven't mentioned yet are all very good as well, with the exception of Contusion, which is way too stiff and studio-cold compared to the way he used to do it live with Wonderlove. <br />So, yes, this album is one of the best in history, despite it's considerable flaws. The great is so amazingly strong that it overpowers the mediocre. But I still say that Stevie's ultimate creation is Innervisions. On that album, he had not yet reached the height of his success and the conceitedness that apparently went along with it, and therefore was able to focus and edit himself down to one album and make it perfect. On SITKOL, he seems unfocused at times. Frankly, there's just too many songs there. No one can write 3 albums worth of material, cram it all together and have it all be great & fit together. He needed a producer with a stronger will than his to say \\"Stevie, these songs are too long, and some of them are too ambitious.\\" He did not have this person, therefore we were 'treated' to the aimless noodlings of Contusion, the failed electronic gimmickry of Village Ghetto Land and HATWG, and worst of all, the insufferable children's screaming  on \\"Black Man\\".<br />The recent reissue of SITKOL, by producer Harry Weinger, is very good. It could have been better if Stevie would ever let anyone use his demos and alternate takes for these reissues, which he owns. He refuses, and all we get are the albums with no extras. Apparently he has to die first before we'll ever see his dozens of unused songs included on reissues, as in Marvin Gaye's case. Let's hope he changes his mind. Not likely, since he seems to have retired from the music biz.
B00005JKN9|4.0|After reading the reviews of this film I must say I was somewhat reluctant to spend the time to watch it.  But all reviews are personal and after watching the movie I found I enjoyed it alot.  <br />The film is truly theatrical, the big hats, sharp imagery etc...  but it fits on the big screen amazingly well.  Scorsese is a brilliant director and one of only a few who could pull a film like this off.  <br />The film marks a dark, bloody point in American history.  The bloody draft riots in New York, The bitter hatred between Irish immigrants and the so-called 'native' Americans.  Scorsese mixes personal and political agenda's together to make a remarkably gripping and intense movie.  The film is a must watch, sometimes if you ignore the critics you are rewarded, this is one of those times.<br />4 Stars, the movie is long, maybe too long.
B00003CY0V|4.0|I liked the premise of this movie, and Travolta plays a good &quot;bad guy&quot;. This movie has Police, Bombs, Bank robberys, Car Chases, Hacking, and many other commonmd things found in action movies. But it has one thing taht most Actioon movies dont have: it was convincing... well almost. It struck me as a DELL Commercial... ALL the pcs even the servers are DELLS that it the only thing that makes it less convincing...
B00005JKJA|2.0|The movie is one of the best in 2002 according to the Times Magazine, but the movie was recorded badly because my Toshiba SD-3006 DVD player could not play the entire movie. It stalled in the switch layer change. The recording studio should do a better job for recording two-layer disc movies. Every other DVD movies play fine in my DVD player.<br />Also, this movie does not offer chapter skip. You must fast-forward or rewind where you left off. Since my DVD player stalled while watching Muholland Drive at 1:08:00, I tried to get it played again but there was no solution for me to recover. Therefore, I am unable to watch the entire movie. Not sure if new DVD players do that also.<br />                            Walter Chan
B000069AUI|5.0|I know that people have the right to be critical of anything they want to be.  This is the Internet after all.  But please, who amongst you reviewers out there can even dream of writing songs as well as these guys?  Be honest.       In My Place and The Scientist are well worth the price of this CD just on their own, and the rest of the disc is about as good.    This is the kind of album that bands 30 years ago used to make, or at least attempted to; where songs build on each other, and the whole listening experience is heightened with each passing track.  Then you'd play the whole album again, just to relive that great feeling of experiencing something that's worthwhile.   There are few bands around today able to sustain that type of artistic consistency.      I haven't heard their first cd but after getting A Rush of Blood to the Head, I definitely will.
B00008H2LB|3.0|I have been a fan of Linkin Park since way back in October 2000, when they released Hybrid Theory.  Upon first listening to the CD, I was stunned.  It was something the like of which I had never heard before, and the album became heavy rotation for me - at most, a hip-hop fan.  However, at the same time, the album had a double effect in that it opened the doors of alternative, rock, and metal to me and I began to diversify my music tastes.  I give LP due credit for that.<br />Reanimation was an AMAZING album as well, as far as being the truest hybrid of hip-hop, electronic music, and rock I had ever seen that was lost on many of the Hybrid Theory fans.  But I was not prepared for anything when I stumbled upon the Hybrid Theory EP and the demos that LP had done for their debut album.<br />Shinoda's lyrics were so complex, it would put any mainstream rapper out there right now to shame.  Eminem, Jay-Z, Nas, whoever.  He would KILL them in a battle.  Chester's voice sounded more full of passion and pain than it ever had.  Although the EP was only 6 songs long, and the demos were the originals of the Hybrid Theory songs, some of the lyrics were different than the versions that came out, and in general they just were so much more amazing than what I had heard.<br />About a month later, Meteora came out.  To be blunt, now that I had heard the band at their purest, at full creativity, I suppose this was somewhat of a letdown, as I realized what corporate influence had done to them.<br />Don't get me wrong.  There are some decent songs on the album.  Somewhere I Belong, the lead single, is a first for LP in its messsage of hope, and the opening with the reversed guitar is unique, although the \\"dumbed-down\\" lyrics of Shinoda kill me, as he is capable of MUCH, much more.  Breaking The Habit, Faint, and Numb also signal new territory for LP as they bring in more piano and orchestral instruments, or just go insane as far as the tempo goes in a song.  Nobody's Listening is a good chance for Shinoda to flow lyrically, although again, it is NOTHING NEAR what he and every Hybrid Theory/Xero fan knows he is capable of.  Session is also a great job by Mr. Hahn, and in my opinion goes WAY past the work he did on Cure For THe Itch, in fact being so good that it was put on the Matrix 2 Soundtrack.  But after these 6 songs, the other half of the CD is just Hybrid Theory-re-hash or just plain awful.<br />I mean, they sound fine.  But in terms of fundamental music sense, they are just so wrong it hurts.  And what increases the pain even more is that this is probably due to the influence of their \\"producer,\\" Don Gilmore.  The reason Reanimation was so good and so true to what LP was is because MIKE and JOE produced it.  Not some big-shot corporate guy who made them re-do a song lyrically 90 times just so \\"Some kid in cleveland would be able to identify with it,\\" as Don himself said.  Dumbing down the songs, basically.<br />Personally, I hope this is the end of LP's association with Don Gilmore, because if it is, then we will be able to expect a day where they take us back to the HT/Xero sounds.  If not, then expect more Meteora...and maybe even worse.
B000092ZYX|2.0|Is it just me, or are these guys a bit overrated?  Either that, or they're believing their reviews too much. How about writing some songs, guys? Everytime I buy a new one of their cd's I think my speakers are starting to go downhill.  Not even that interesting anymore.  Save your money.
B00005RHGK|1.0|A friend summed it up best- &quot;oh, you mean the comedy Jeepers Creepers&quot;. For the 1st 40-50 minutes it seems to be heading somewhere, but it turns into the most ridiculous, unappealing waste of film I have ever seen in a horror movie- It makes the later &quot;nightmare on elm street&quot; movies  look like film noir. I couldn't decide which was worse- watching this or hitting myself with a claw hammer. Pretty similar feeling. I think I'd prefer the hammer- just to prove what fools we the movie going public are, they have now made a sequel. Again, I recommend the hammer
B00005JLD4|5.0|I don't know if we really have progressed that much past Australia's view (not that many years ago, mind you) of eliminating the Aborigines' gene pool from the face of the earth.  As a top govenment official, Kenneth Branagh's character is so real, so self righteously benevolent, he may be one of the scariest characters in movie history.  He's not quite a Hitler, not even close, but in many ways, he agrees with him.  He is a great example of subtle, well-intentioned evil.  <br />The story of the girls' journey is an incredible one, and should make any person proud and wonder out loud what the human spirit is actually capable of.  Phillip Noyce is one incredible director, and this is  one of his two greatest films, along with the 'Quiet American.'
0345451325|5.0|I half expected this book to be more like a documentary or something, but I was pleasantly suprised to find that it was a very cool story.  If your a Halo fan, get this book now, hurry, you're wasting time.  If your simply a fan of science fiction literature, I highly recommend this book, it has all the elements of a good science fiction story.  I have always enjoyed star wars books and such, and this was one of the better sci fi books I have read.  It gets 5 stars because I am an avid Halo fan as well.

B00009V7T2|5.0|I can't describe how intriguing this album is to me.  I absolutely love it.  The first couple of times I heard the album I loved how it sounded, but I wanted to know what it was about.  It is a very cool concept, it is kind of like a tribute to one of their friends who commited suicide after coming out of a coma.  He did rat poison or something the first time trying to kill himself.  Anyways the only thing you need to know is get this album.  It is such a nice break from all the crap the on the radio.
B000002ADT|5.0|No other album (jazz or other wise) can match this one. Perfection plain and simple.
B000002G7G|4.0|At last I have this album! Now I have all four studio albums(and 1969 live)...Anyways this album is very beautiful...Candy Says, Some kinda love, what goes on, beggining to see the light...all fantastic...The only negative things I can say about this album is that murder mystery should not be there...it doesn't fit on the album, it's not so much that I think its a bad song, but more that it disrupts the flow...also story of my life is fairly mediocre...but apart form that perfect! Definately worth your pennies...
B00009W0U4|1.0|i reccomend this film for its intelligence. i loved the way the plot is set up and the camera work is terrific. The acting was also impecible.However i do not think this film has enough warning on it about the type of scences the viewers encounters. <BR>DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM IF YOU ARE IN ANYWAY SENSITIVE TO RAPE !! it has posible one of the worst rape scetches i have ever seen. The violence is extremely realistic and i am not a squimish person but i felt physically sick on several occasions. Horrific doesnt even cover it and the infomation on the back i think downplays how brutal the film is.nothing is left to the imagination.if i was going to praise this film for anything it would be how it reveals just how much we fool ourselves into thinking we are civilised creatures and how close to instinct driven predators we really are.
B000002AP1|5.0|Great album... very influential...fantastic...perfect...but wait I like funhouse better!...this album may not be the \\"stooges\\" best but is still one of the best albums of all time...yeah they're that good! Anyways Search and destroy and Gimme danger (the album's openers) are damn fine rock and roll...They're lyrically teriffic and performed just so good that it's scary...Now as said before this is not the stooge's best, but then again how can any album compete with funhouse?...James Williamson's guitar playing is interesting...but I think Ron Asheton kicks his ... ...Either way this is worth your money...no question about it...I would also say if you're into heavy metal you'll love this...As for the whole remixing thing I don't know since I only have the iggy version...and I've heard conflicting reports...but you can't go wrong you'll be satisfied with either version no doubt...
B000002MFN|5.0|This album is great, and that's that!! And the critics who trashed this album probably never listened to it. There are only 2 really sexuall songs on here. (Erotica, Where Life Begins)She has her most personal lyrics on here (Why's It So hard, In this Life)<br />Total Copies Sold: 6 million
0452270073|5.0|This is definately my favourite book! From the minute i picked it up, i did not want to put it down. I was surprised by its content and found it utterly compelling. It is one of the lighter war literature reads, which seemed somewhat refreshing. The characters were fantastically developed and i found myself particularly drawn to Billy Prior. The sessions between Rivers and all his patients were entertaining, yet touching.<br />All in all this is an incredible book and i can not wait to read the rest of the trilogy!
B00005JLXE|3.0|Eye-popping visual effects, a great score...and...Jennifer Garner zipping around the screen in tight clothes...that sums up the high points of Daredevil. While not as coma inducing as Spiderman (a film that I felt was way overhyped and unjustly overpraised) Daredevil falls woefully behind other Marvel films. While Ben Affleck is adequate as the masked superhero, he seems very uncomfortable in the role. I can't exactly say why, but it just appears that he is not \\"having fun\\" kicking [booty] and taking names. Colin Farrell is absolutely hilarious as Bullseye, actually stealing most of the scenes he is in. Jennifer Garner it appears was placed in the film for one reason and one reason only, eye-candy. Michael Clarke Duncan spends most of the movie handing out roses and ordering people to do all the dirty work. In fact, so inconsequential is the supporting cast in this movie that the screenwriters apparently felt that a literate script was not even needed. Visually, Daredevil is top notch. The fight scenes are kinetically charged with flying fists and jittery camera work, and the prog/rock soundtrack fits the mood very well. The \\"comic book\\" spirit is adequately portrayed, and I guess that is all that matters for this type of film. While not the best of the Marvel pool, Daredevil is still a guilty pleasure film. Popcorn cinema at its finest.
B00005JLSE|4.0|The film version of the Broadway hit is about a 1920's wannabe celebrity who kills her lover and becomes an instant celebrity.  She gets off the hook thanks to the manipulations of a fast-talking lawyer and her tough-as-nails prison matron, but then she no longer makes headlines.  But not to worry, she hooks up with another celebrity-murderer for a sisters-in-crime act.  Some of the songs are excellent -- even Richard Gere shows that he can belt them out -- there is some clever cross-cutting between plot events and cabaret acts, and we are spared the traditional, offensive boy-girl romance.  However, the transition from stage to film is somewhat inept: the story takes place almost entirely in dingy backstage rooms and on a claustrophobically confining prison set. I wanted exteriors of gin joints, tenements, and society mansions.    <br />I also became increasingly uncomfortable with the dozens -- maybe hundreds -- of women writhing against each other in leather bikinis. Is this standard issue prison garb?  There are acres and acres of female bodies in almost total undress, but only two shots of shirtless men, both extremely brief.  The gorgeous Richard Gere remains staunchly suited througout.  This is definitely a movie for the ladies.
B00005JLXE|4.0|I really enjoyed watching this movie.  I think Ben Affleck could have been better, but I don't think his performance really took away from the movie much.  I thought Jen Garner did a great job as Elektra.  I also thought the special features, including some music videos were very good on the DVD.
B000003TA4|2.0|Alright kiddies, time for a dose of reality. Many proclaim this to be the best record of all time. Laughable. Anyone with any musical depth would never say such a thing.<br />All the worship of Kurt as a genious. No, he wasn't. His style is simple and doesn't really bring much to the table. What set him apart was his angst and depression. Thats the universal theme which keeps so many relating to him.  The music is rather unexceptional.<br />A lot of people say how this was the second coming of rock. Simply laughable such a notion as that. Those of us who were alive in the late 1980s and early 90s know that eye candy, pop and rap dominated the landscape. During those years Alternative  had been doing well below the radar (Jane's Addiction etc). So when the music industry needed to start a new cycle to move records - Alternative was up. As it had been selling well with very little corporate pushing.<br />Now is Smells like Teen Spirit catchy - of course. Are there some other catchy alt pop sounds on this album - yes. Does it rise to the level of the creme de la creme of rock - No. It was trendy for a time. Just like any forced fad the music industry heaves on us.<br />Looking at over the years my perspective has changed on it. The musicanship is mediocre. Dave Grohl is one of the must unfeeling drummers I've ever heard. No emotion whatsoever in his playing.  Chris's bass playing is competent. Kurt's guitar playing is simple and mediocre.<br />So in the final anyalsis what makes Nirvana different? Kurt's letting all his angst, anger and depression hang out there. There will be people that will relate to that forever. He communicated it honestly.<br />The people who love Nirvana relate to Kurt's themes. Hence, the loyalty to the band.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I heard this CD when daughter got it as a gift. As a 47 year old mom I found this CD to be quite enjoyable, and I listen to it all the time. John Mayer has a soothing voice and his songs are all down to earth and well written. I especially enjoy &quot;83&quot; which brings back memories to when my daughter was born. His music is definitely a plus in my view. This guy has true talent if he can sing without the help of backup singers and sound affects, and unlike most musicians today he can carry a tune. I never get sick of hearing this CD and I can honestly say I'd buy his music in the future. I must admit, I did think he was Dave Matthews when I first heard him sing, however I am convinced this was not intentional. His music brings out true meaning of life experiences that can only be expressed through his singing. I don't get into today's teeny bopper stuff but this guy is on my list of favorites.
B00005JKZU|2.0|TWO TOWERS IN THREE HOURS<br /> Gee whiz, this sure was some movie! Action, adventure, pathos, violence, kissing--you name it, Two Towers has got it. I am so impressed by this masterpiece that I think somebody should turn it into a book. It might sell very well.<BR> (I've heard that there already is a book called \\"The Two Towers,\\" written in the 1940s by some Oxford philologist named, I think, Tolkien.  But Peter Jackson need not worry about using the same title for a book based on his movie. Nobody who has read Tolkien's book, and seen Jackson's movie, will ever confuse the two.)<br /> Two reviews for the price of one:<br /> Review for people who have never read Tolkien, and don't intend to:  This beautifully-photographed adventure film should delight you no end. The exciting events, the constant shifting from one perspective to another, the courage of the heroes, and the hilarious antics of that noted zany, Gimli the Dwarf, should wring the withers and lift the spirits of young and old alike. You may find the portrayal of Frodo Baggins (by Elijah Wood) a little, um, wooden: he excels at standing still and staring unblinkingly while trying to make up his mind to actually DO something. (He's also very good at falling down. His belly-flop into the Dead Marshes is especially impressive.) But he contributes greatly to the movie, by taking the concept of the \\"reluctant hero\\" to new and hitherto undreamed-of heights. <BR>See the film, by all means. Those special effects will just knock your socks off, yessirree!<br />     Review for those who love Tolkien's masterpiece:  Take two aspirins and watch it. The opening will please you; then it's all downhill. You may feel angry at first, but eventually you'll probably start giggling. Did you know that Gimli was from Scotland? Listen to that accent grow! (At one point he even calls Aragorn \\"laddie.\\") Did you know that Aragorn fell off a cliff into a river and disappeared for several days? Did you know that Théoden was a zombie, his body literally possessed by Saruman? Did you know that several hundred elves came to help the Rohirrim at Helm's Deep--where Théoden had moved the entire population of Edoras? Did you know... but why should I spoil this chef-d'oeuvre further, by giving away its innumerable &quot;improvements&quot; on Tolkien? You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll cringe, you'll squirm, you'll wince (at the 200th close-up of Frodo's wide-eyed face). You certainly won't watch it twice, except for giggles. It's much worse than the first film.<br />Envoi:<BR> I did find myself wondering what Peter Jackson does in his spare time. Perhaps he writes improved versions of Mozart's symphonies, or touches up Rembrandts, or takes a chisel and enhances Michelangelo's David.<br /> I must admit I am very eagerly awaiting Part III. It should be a riot. Can we start a contest to predict how Jackson will end his epic? Based on what I have seen so far, I think that Aragorn will be living in a ménage à trois with Arwen and Eowyn; Frodo will become a mannequin in a shop window (since he is already almost indistinguishable from one); Gimli will get a job as a slapstick comedian at a nightclub in Minas Tirith; and Gandalf will become a full-time exorcist (\\"Begone, Saruman!\\"). You'll enjoy making your own guesses after you've seen this travesty. (What a pity it is that poor old Professor Tolkien couldn't think up all the neat things that Mr. Jackson has put into this wonderful film!)<br /> PS - Contrary to what some reviewers have said, it is not impossible to transfer a literary masterpiece to the screen without ruining it. Read Waugh's Brideshead Revisited, then watch the BBC series. Read Massie's Nicholas and Alexandra, then watch the movie. It can be done. But not by Peter Jackson. He is much too great a creative artiste to allow his brilliance to be stifled by the writings of a mere genius.<br /> Namárië.
B00009W0U4|1.0|hey, how do i kill 15 minutes of film time?  oh.......i could rotate the camera endlessly to make the first scene unwatchable.  \\"showgirls\\" is easier on the viewer than this film.  the fight and killing is well done and brutally real.  however the whole \\"artistic\\" (heavy sarcasm) aspect of the first chapter ruins everything to the point of \\"just let me be done with this thing\\".  i quit this film quicker than the french quit world war II.
B00006RU5B|5.0|This album is one of the best rock albums of all time. Of the last twenty years, I'd put it at number one. \\"Cochise\\" and \\"Show Me How To Live\\" are each worth the entire cost of this album, but, what a deal, you get the rest of the songs free. Not to say they're not worth anything, the rest of the songs are, to say the least, amazing. But amazing does not compare to the speechless awe brought on by the first two songs. Both will get you jumping three feet in the air with an air guitar in your arms. Both will get you to not pay attention to the road if you're driving. Both will give you headaches, that's how much you'll be headbanging. These songs are dangerously good. Audioslave proves that new bands don't have to suck, and can even be awesome. Audioslave gives us hope for the future of rock. This band is the Beatles, the Led Zeppelin, the Ted Nugent, the Jimmy Hendrix, of today. Needless to say in 30 years, we'll be hearing these songs every day on the radio. Needless to say our children (that is, for us teenagers) will ask for \\"The Best of Audioslave\\" for Christmas. Needless to say Audioslave will be enshrined in the annals of rock and roll history as one of the greatest bands of all time. This album alone stands to guarantee all this.
B000002GVO|4.0|Hotel California is regarded as The Eagles' creativity peak, but it has some weak stuff as well. What we know as side two of this album drags on too long and is much too slow. Some more fire is missing on it. Okay, The Last Resort is a fitting finale to this cd, but before it we've already had two more ballads, and this is way too much. I don't know what is worse - Pretty maids All In a Row (Unusual gentle song by Joe Walsh and Joe Vitale) or Try And Love Again.<br />Highlights needn't to be quoted, as they've been to death, but anyway let's do it.<br />The title track contains one of the prettiest guitar solos of all time, and the song itself is a treat. New Kid In Town harks back to the early Eagles sound, while Life In The Fast Lane brings Walsh' skills to the fore as well as Felder's. Wasted Time slows things down one more time and is a great if cliched ballad, due to the nevertheless beautiful string arrangement. <br />This song's reprise is the first filler of the album, though fortunately very brief. Victim of Love is the other rocker of the cd, and kicks all the way through, although the solo is too short. And right after this tune is when the cracks appear on the cd: three slow songs are too much, as pointed above. Pretty Maids is bearable, but then we have Try and Love Again, that could be great with a minute or two shorter. Sometimes to be good and brief is a virtue, remember also Meisner's Is It True from On The Border. There is no time to get bored by it, unlike what happens with Try and Love Again. The Last Resort is a great ballad, and the lyric is up to par.<br />All in all, a great classic but a little flawed, unlike many other (Led Zeppelin IV, Second Helping, Animals, etc...). And I consider On The Border as the best Eagles' cd, because it doesn't bore you, as Hotel California does, in spite of having best songwriting at times.
B000002J09|5.0|Allow me to explain...<BR>Whoever says this album is over-rated or in any other way bad is wrong. Don't get me wrong, people are entitled to their own opinions. I'd just like to take a moment to make fun of those opinions. Because they're wrong. <BR> <BR>The fact is... this album rocks. I agree, it's not Led Zepp's best. But that's not to say it isn't better than 99.99% of all the other albums out there. This album is amazing. It owns. \\"Black Dog\\" is catchy. By catchy, I don't mean \\"oh that's nice and catchy.\\" I mean, you hear it and you'll never forget it. Same goes for \\"Rock and Roll.\\" \\"Battle of Evermore,\\" eh, not that good. But again, it's better than most. \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" involves passionately written lyrics, accompanied by a steady and smooth acoustic rythym most of the way through, slowly leading up to an amazing and deep and head-bangingly awesome stanza, with electric guitar riffs and drum beats to beat any, and ending with a soft closing refrain to the title phrase \\"and she's buying a stairway to heaven.\\" \\"Misty Mountain Hop\\" is good, the round-and-round-and-round style is somewhat annoying, but not overdone enough to make the song bad. \\"Four Sticks\\" is good, but somewhat pointless, if you get what I'm saying. \\"Going to California\\" is also somewhat boring. \\"When the Levee Breaks\\" uses a somewhat-bluesy method to bring you a powerful beat. The song's good, but not amazing. It rounds off the album well. It's a good song to put at the end of an album. Overall the album is good. It's slower than most other Zepps', but it's very powerful. The lyrics are somewhat more meaningful, the guitar riffs less independent, and the focus seems to mostly be placed on the song itself, not just certain parts, as the music truly flows from one place to another.
B000002GXJ|2.0|Everybody who thinks is an Eagles fan should know the only reason this album was made was to please the record company, because the band was coming apart at the seams by then, so comes as no surprise the fact that the final result is boring. Logical, if this may be one of the most obscene examples of corporate greed. The band should have disbanded rather than make this uninspiring album.<br />I won't get into discussing if there are too many overdubs or not, cause I'm not up with that stuff so I prefer leaving it to people who know more than me but, if so many have claimed there are, it must be true.<br />The lack of passion is painfully obvious on this 'live' cd, and the setlist suffers as a result. Nine minutes for a Walsh song (that is not bad, but just drags on and on) and none for Witchy Woman, The Best Of My Love or Good Day In Hell? The latter may be the most unfairly overlooked song in the entire Eagles catalogue.<br />Contrary to what some reviewers have said, some of the songs' arrangements were changed for the stage, and f***** things up. The studio arrangements of their songs were already excellent, so why mess with them? On both Heartache Tonight and I Can't Tell You Why there's less drumming than on their studio counterparts, which is also a disappointment.<br />In a nutshell - one of the least appealing 'live' sets ever, probably not a good sample of what the Eagles were on stage before becoming the take-the-money-and-run dinosaur that are now. Wryly, and as contrived as Hell Freezes Over may be, leaves you with a better taste of Eagles's music than the dreary 'Eagles Live'. 'Eagles Yawning' would have been a more adequate title.
B000002J03|5.0|I find it hard to decide which is the best rock album of all time: Physical Graffiti or Led Zeppelin II. Either way, it ain't bad. This album is distinctly Led Zeppelin. It's definition is found in the amazing guitar riffs, kickin' bass, stunning drum-work, and the distinct voice of Robert Plant. To start the album, Jimmy Page blows your head off with his guitar riffs in \\"Whole Lotta Love.\\" The bass in this song will make the room vibrate, but you'd gladly give up the glass on that china cabinet to hear this song twice. \\"Thank You\\" starts off with some creepy-sounding vocals and overall boring music. I hate to say it, but Robert Plant just sounds like a ghost. The beautiful flowing lyrics and passion are what make this a good song, as well as the intensity found later on. This brings us to Heartbreaker/Livin' Lovin' Maid. Jimmy Page's second-best performance in my opinion. John Paul Jones helps make this song memorable. I can't say much except that the song is awesome. \\"Ramble On\\" is an excellent example of Led Zeppelin's rambling. Overall, Led Zeppelin's songs are just random. They can be acoustic, quiet, even boring for most of a song, but then they can burst out of the blues with chillingly amazing guitar riffs and bass melodies. \\"Moby Dick\\" is an amazing instrumental. John Bonham proves he can solo for five minutes without boring anyone or losing a beat. Jimmy Page's small role in this song is without question amazing, as well. Because of the passion involved, and the lack of bad songs, I think I can safely call this the best rock album, ever.

B00005JKZV|5.0|I've never been able to plod through Tolkein's work, but I've really been enjoying these movies.  I can't wait for the end!
B00005JKZV|4.0|From the first movie you could expect what would happen, and this one proves it was well written as was the special effects. I especially enjoyed the sequence of the trees coming to life. I would like to see more of the special effects in this movie involving the Elves, which they bring an important part of the movie. All in all it is not a movie you can just up and leave the room, you miss one second of The Two Towers you'll be confused. In the beginning I had no idea what was a dream and what was real, it went back and forth so much that after a few minutes you hoped they didn't go back into a dream sequence again. I enjoyed the movie, excellent casting, directing and a well written script. Take out the popcorn and don't move.

B000002U6E|5.0|Enigma's second album, 1993's \\"The Cross Of Changes,\\" continues this recording act's explorations in estoteric, spacey keyboard music, mixed with samples, slamming beats, ethereal vocals, and tribal chants (replacing the chanting monks from the classic first album from 1990). Enigma mastermind Michael Cretu, who also contributes lead vocals on a couple of tracks, has created another astonishing, dreamy soundscape where the music ebbs & flows, and simply takes your breath away. The awesome \\"Return To Innocence\\" was the big hit from the album, but there's many other delights such as the powerful \\"The Eyes Of Truth,\\" the thrilling 9-minute extravaganza \\"I Love You, I'll Kill You,\\" the Enigma signature \\"Age Of Loneliness\\" (from the Sharon Stone movie \\"Sliver\\"), the beautiful \\"Dream Of The Dolphin,\\" and the triumphant \\"Out From The Deep.\\" I just can't get enough of this awesome group---\\"The Cross Of Changes\\" is another hypnotic Enigma classic.

I'm not even sure there was a script for it.  If they weren't really going to try, why did they bother?<br />...I already own \\"Animal House\\" on DVD.  How often are they going to play this trick on DVD owners?  I'm tired of buying a disc only to have it followed up by a disk with more extras a year or so later.  Phooey on that.  I'm not playing that game anymore.  Let them eat re-releases or do it right in the first place!
048629823X|5.0|This edition of Marcus Aurelius' 'Meditations' is an excellent rendition of what may be the most profound book of insight meditation ever written. It is an updating of George Long's venerable 1862 translation, with long sentences untangled and thee's and thou's modernized to you's .  At first I found it a little dry and underemphatic, but as I continued reading, I became thoroughly engaged by its clarity and precision. As a literal reading, the Dover edition is a lot more readable than Loeb's Haines translation, and more direct than Staniforth's Penguin edition. And at this price, you almost can't afford not to have it. 'Meditations' really can help you be a better person.

B00008J4P5|1.0|This is the White Stripes best album to date. The production is minimalistic, the lyrics are excellent, and the melodies are powerful. Jacks guitar, Megs simple drumming, and Jacks heartfelt vocals combine to create some of the best music we have today. Favorites include &quot;The Air Near My Fingers&quot;, &quot;Seven Nation Army&quot;, &quot;Hypnotize&quot;, &quot;I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself&quot; (on which Jack sounds as though he's about to weep), &quot;There's No Home For You Here&quot;, &quot;The Hardest Button to Button&quot;, and &quot;You've Got Her In Your Pocket&quot;, though they're all wonderful. So buy this!

B0000AI44Q|4.0|I find it interesting, for a variety of reasons, that no one has reviewed this album yet, given that it was released about 2 weeks ago. <br />That said, I think the live DVD in Ireland is a particularly captivating piece of work. I guess I'm dating myself here but Neil, when he's solo and live, is at his most direct and powerful. He has a live presence -- I've seen him many times and also many other really great acts since the early 70's -- that can only be compared with other still living generational transcending greats of his era like Dylan, McCartney, Stones, Clapton, Tull, Santana, and Van (sorry if I've forgotten anyone -- I know I have), and all those dead greats like Jimi and Jim who continue to inform our thoughts and rhythms (again, sorry I haven't mentioned so many similarly influential characters).<br />There is just a kind of no doubt conditionally limited, but nonetheless sincere and genuine, wisdom transmitted through Neil -- through his great artistic moments and also his apparently ugly and/or lame and half-assed moments (of which most of us would affirm there are many). He is an incredibly creative and productive man who lives in an utterly paradisal place with a truly intelligent, beautiful, and compassionate wife, who has to look at his forever son Benny, who is quadrapalegic, spastic, and non-aural (and his other son Zeke also has cerebral palsy and, from what I've heard, his lovely daughter Amber-Jean is epileptic, as Neil is). He is a living allegory, as it were, and it seems to me that his message through Greendale is also a similar allegory, involving real, irreconcilable contradictions, but also apparent contradictions that can and must be reconciled.<br />Anyway, for what it's worth, I think that both the live DVD (being solo acoustic, and involving Neil talking at considerable length very drolly-articulately almost in the ancient bard verbal tradition) -- and the CD, as an electric 3-piece Crazy Horse statement, very notably without Poncho but with a thank-you to him, also contribute to intentionally allegoric combination of tensions and contradictions that Neil has attempted to create as a mirror for all of our hypocritical selves.<br />Neil made his pact with the devil in the Greendale prison a long time ago, as have most of us, but he's in a good position to criticize it for what it has, having paid such a price for all of us to see.
B00005NOOH|5.0|I thought it would be a daunting task to view all the programs in The World at War series, but I was wrong.  Like a good novel, it is easy to get hooked on this series and difficult to turn off the DVD player.<br />The tremendous amount of time and effort that was invested in the making of The World at War is everywhere apparent.  Each program is well written and the narration by Sir Lawrence Oliver is superb.  Actual footage of the war itself is interspersed with commentary by various participants, from the man on the street to the generals and politicians who made the important decisions concerning the conduct of the war.  Maps are used when appropriate to show us the geography involved and the movement of the various armies during the war.  The narration explains cleary and succinctly what we are seeing on the maps and helps us to make sense of the war footage that almost always follows.<br />Perhaps 75% of the story pertains to the European Theater of Operation.  Some viewers, particularly us Americans, would like to see more of the Pacific Theater, particularly the war in China and Southeast Asia. It is hard for me to determine what might have been cut to allow for more of the War in the Pacific beyond the sometimes overlong interviews of the tremendous number of participants in the war.  I am content to recommend the film exactly as is.<br />The filmmakers never flinch at showing the horror of this war.  Fifty-four million people lost their lives; most of these were civilians killed in the bombings of cities like Hamburg, Dresden, Hiroshima, and Nagasaki.  Fourteeen million people were killed by the Germans in their various concentration camps and by the SS Action Squads who murdered people, mostly civilians, in the field.  The additional footage on Auschwitz and the various concentration camps, is, perhaps, the most horrifying record ever put on film of man's inhumanity to man.<br />Toward the end of the program a German major is interviewed extensively and he attempts to support the big lie that the methodical extermination of Jews, Poles, Russians, Gypsies, and other people the Germans considered to be sub-human, did not take place.  It is impossible to watch this series and react with anyting but horror and dismay to such an attempt to disregard an enormous amount of documentary evidence to the Holocaust, much of it provided by the Germans themselves.<br />The World at War gives us the big picture and the details.  It is a history lesson without equal, at least in my opinion.  Many viewers will want to fill in the gaps that can't be provided in thirty hours or so of viewing the DVD by reading books like Life World War 2, a history told in pictures, to mention only one of thousands of possiblilites.<br />The transfer of the film to DVD is, I think, exceptionally good.  In little more than the space taken by a history book we now have available to us as good a visual documentary history of World War II as has ever been made.  Highest recommendation!he attempts to support the big lie that the methodical extermination of Jews, Poles, Russians, Gypsies, and other people the Germans considered to be sub-human, did not take place.

0385504209|5.0|Instead of writing a long explaination of the plot (you can read all of the others), I will simply encourage you to give this book at try.  I am an avid reader, and honestly, difficult to impress.  However, this book was fantastic!  I couldn't put in down and read it in one sitting!  Much better than a typical thriller and very thought provoking!
B00009MGQL|4.0|I'll start with a hypothesis - in any art form, there are only a handful of geniuses - one could argue for example that in Jazz, only Coltrane and Bird qualify on the saxaphone (add 1 or 2 more, according to your personal preferences). With that said, as a musician and fan of 40 years, there have been only 2 rock guitar geniuses, Jimi Hendrix and Jeff Beck. So that leaves us with one... and as surely as Michael Jordan in his prime was SO much better than anyone else playing the game, I think it's clear that Mr. Beck is by far the greatest living guitarist. Does anyone else copy him, as they did Val Halen? Nope... can't do it! I've spent many hours trying to copy many of his signature moves, and it is impossible to match his intonation, his phrasing, and his tone. The material on this album is not particularly impressive - if you're not a true fan of spectacular guitar playing, you'll be better served by many other CD's. If, on the other hand, you are interested in what the world's greatest rock guitarist is up to, buy it and crank it up.
B000002LGW|3.0|I heard somewhere that Depeche Mode was a live force to be reckoned with in the late 80's.  Selling out stadiums and putting on one of the biggest tours, these guys were the sensation you haven't heard much of if you are under 24.  <br />If this concert took place after Violator, it would probably be the only CD needed for the casual DM fan.  As it is Violator is great enough where that and this are more than enough to satisfy my DM appetite.  There are a multitude of great songs here.  Most of them are radio hits from their respective time that stil find regular rotation on 80's stations. Behind the Whell, Strangelove, Blaspemous Rumors, Shake The Disease, People are People and Just Can't Get Enough are the highlights of this album.  Some of the other songs are decent but get repetive after a while.  This is the perfect exmaple of why CD burners are invaluable as they eaisily turn a two decent CD's into one ALL STAR disc.  <br />Bottom Line:  The best of DM from their pre-89 stuff.  Pick it up if you have heard a few of the songs and think you might be inerested.
B000002ADT|5.0|Miles Davis and his old team ALSO revolutionized modal Jazz music.<BR>I'm a big jazz-fan but not into \\"grand pa\\" Jazz!<BR>Even people who are not very much into jazz often likes it too, so if you like to start somewhere start here :-)
B000002LK1|4.0|No doubt Depeche Mode's most popular album, this one has got some serious legs and deservedly so.  I don't know what you would call Depeche Mode sound.  It's kind of a mixture between dance, electronica, and pop.  Depeche Mode has their own sound which many assocaitate with an 80's tinge and thus has developed their own unique fan base.  This is the album that was able to transcend that fan base and is really a gem as it is still great ten+ years later.  <br />Where to start?  Well first the album is short (about 45 minutes) but that works because this kind of music has about a 45 min max for me before I've had enough.  Its pretty intense as the theme is the only reason keeping this from being a five star CD in my mind. It is dark and bleak and examines personal demons and feelings of loneliness, despair and neediness.  Heavy stuff that is usally only found in the everyday rotation of the clinically insane and depressed unless you are really in the mood.  Thankfully the beats and groove trancsend the atmosphere to produce likeable and singable head boppin ditties.<br />Four of the songs were radio hits (Personal Jesus, Enjoy the Silence, Policy Of Truth, World in My Eyes) and these are the heart and soul of the album.  DM really got in a zone with these songs as they all work extremely well at pleasing and never annoying.  The rest of the songs are for the most part slower paced and intersect the radio hits well.  The Sweetest Perfection and Clean are the best of the rest.  The only blemish on the album is Waiting For The Night.  This song reminded me a precursor of what was to come on Songs Of Faith And Devotion: i.e. slow, preachy and boring.  <br />Bottom Line:  An amazing CD that people who are fans of songs like Strangelove and People are People will probably enjoy.  Fans of 80's music will probably enjoy this as well.
B00009TB5G|5.0|Yes, the title says \\"Countdown to November\\", not December, when the \\"Return of the King\\" finally hits the big screens, but November, when fans of the Lord of the Rings trilogy can get their hands on \\"The Two Towers: Special Extended Edition\\", the entire movie that includes over forty minutes of extra film footage included in the theatrical release version. Many may think this review is not helpful (mostly because its being written before the Special Edition is for sale), but its here because many people are buying the standard theatrical version, seemingly without realising that a better and bigger edition is on its way. The 'sneak preview' for the Extended Edition - or the advertisment for it, if you prefer - can be seen on the theatrical release DVD, just as the the Extended 'Fellowship' preview was on last year's DVD, and if you fell into the trap of having to buy two DVDs in 2002, then don't let it happen again with \\"The Two Towers\\"!<br />My suggestion is to rent the theatrical release, in order to enjoy the movie and the special features, including trailors, interviews, music videos, and previews of both the Return of the King and the Extended Edition. This should whet your appetite and anticipation long enough for November, when you can purchase the four-disc set with all its extra goodies. The only reason I'm writing this warning is that my father almost brought the theatrical release DVD, but was very relieved afterwards when I warned him and we ended up renting it, wherein he saw the preview for the Extended Edition. His exact words were: \\"I would have been so annoyed if I had brought this version!\\" <br />For those who don't already know, the Extended Edition is set to be excellent. The \\"Fellowship\\" Extended cut had only thirty minutes of extra footage - here we get forty! Included in the cut (and this information is taken from the DVD preview and many internet sources) are:<BR>* Merry and Pippen growing taller due to Treebeard's Ent-draughts.<BR>* the stunning and elabourate funeral of Theoden's son Theodred. <BR>* a pivotal 'flashback' scene between Boromir, Faramir and their father Denethor in Osgiliath, which clearly shows the somewhat strained family dynamic, and may help to make Faramir's motives in forcefully taking Frodo and the Ring to his city more sympathetic.<BR>* Saruman looking over a book that identifies Aragorn as the \\"Lost King of Gondor\\"<BR>* Frodo, Sam and Gollum escaping from Osgiliath via the sewers<BR>* Merry, Pippen and Treebeard exploring the ruins of Isengard (and finding its larder!)<BR>* The Ents (or was in the Huorns? - sorry, I can't recall) rounding up the last of the orcs on the borders of Helm's Deep.<BR>* Eomer finding his cousin wounded in the orc ambush<BR>* Gandalf and Aragorn discussing his fate<BR>* Sam and Frodo using Galadriel's elvish rope to scale a cliff-face<BR>* Aragorn taming the deceased Theodred's horse Brego and releasing him into the wild (yes, that's the horse that rescues him after he falls off the cliff)<BR>* Legolas and Gimli sitting amoungst the dead orcs outside Helm's Deep after the battle.<BR>* Aragorn reluctantly swallowing a stew that Eowyn has dished up.<BR>* Faramir finding the boat containing Boromir's body and the Horn of Gondor cloven in two.<BR>* More Aragorn and Arwen love scenes (*rolls eyes*)<br />These are the main ones, to the best of my memory, but certainly not the only ones - there should be more dialouge inserted into already existing conversation, more battle scenes, and of course added music composed by Howard Shore. The Countdown begins to November...
B000002TYK|2.0|I am not a Foo Fighters fan, I liked Everlong and few of their songs here and there but I'm not too impressed.  I remember buying this album years ago out of my love (at the time) for Nirvana, being casually dissapointed and discarding to a box somewhere in my garage.  Recently I gave it another listen and altough I enjoyed it more now then when I was 15, it still isn't very memorable or inspired.  <br />There are a few decent songs like I'll Stick Around, and This Is A Call which combine some some catchy overdrive and lyrical passion.  The best song of the album is X-Static which is a slower song that is just plain pleasing (oohhhh, oooohhh static....)  Other than that the ablum bores and although the songs are inteligently arraigned and created, there is no passion or drive.  You feel IT at the end I'll Stick Around when Grohl goes off but IT never surfaces again for the album.  <br />I feel bad for Grohl.  He is obviously talented and funny as shown by his videos and music writing ability and I think very highly of him for sticking around exactly like he said he would in his ode to Cobain (Ill Stick Around).  But for me it would be upsetting to know that I was part of a band that could of been monumental (more so than they are) only to have it taken from me.  Maybe Im just being pessimistic but I still feel bad for him because Foo Fighters really are a poor man's Nirvana.  (Actually more like a poor man's Stone Temple Pilot.)<br />Bottom Line:  Boring and uninspired...lets not kid ourselves.
6305003882|5.0|Two thumbs up for this great up-coming classic. Leo was great and so was scene stealer James Madio along with Mark Wahlberg. I think James Madio Has Risen...Looking forward to watching his career. Movie holds you till the very end.
B00005JKZV|4.0|I know you all are going to kill me for giving this movie a 4. But hear me out. The movie was great, and a whole lot better than the first. The war scenes seems to be picking up, and the graphic are unbelieveable. However, near the end the movie kept on switching scene from the forest of trees to the war scene. It made me want to watch it, then when the forest came, it slowed down my heart. That was very irritating.
0140177396|4.0|Of Mice and Men is the story of two men - George and Lennie. George is small and smart, and George is big and mentally challenged. George and Lennie are about to start working on a new farm; they had to leave a previous farm because Lennie got in \\"some trouble\\". Lennie has a preoccupation with things soft and pretty, which lands him in pretty big trouble. <br />This book didn't immediately draw me in from the beginning. I thought the beginning was rather monotonous, but the pace quickly picks up when George and Lennie arrive on the farm. I found that this book is a beautiful portrayal of human compassion. George says that his life would be much better without Lennie, and perhaps it would be, but still you can tell that he cares very much for the gentle giant.<br />George isn't the only example of \\"human compassion\\". You have Carlson who's probably on the extreme uncaring end. He's one of those people who feels that a life isn't valuable anymore once you're of no use. There's also Slim who's very kindhearted. He believes that you can tell if a person is good or not just from their manner of acting. Then, there's Crooks-the cynical stable hand-who likes to believe in the worse of men rather than the best. <br />Also, Steinbeck did a very good job getting his point across using mostly dialogue. There is precious little description in this book, but that's okay because most of the emotion of the story is conveyed through dialogue.
B00001U0DP|5.0|When Roberto Benigni burst onto the Hollywood scene with this acclaimed film and his over-the-top enthusiasm, I couldn't bring myself to watch this film.  Instead, I waited for the DVD.  However, what I perceived as hype was truly deserved.  \\"Life is Beautiful\\" is a wonderfully inventive tale that seems fresh even today, years after its first release.  Part slapstick, part drama, part romantic comedy, part tragedy - this story of an Italian family during the Holocaust defies categorization.<br />The films opens with Guido (Benigni) and his friend arriving in town on a car with no brakes and being mistaken for facist officials expected for a parade.  This slapstick scene ends with Guido catching the future love of his life, Dora (Nicoletta Braschi), as she jumps from a barn window.  The clownish Guido sets out to win her heart despite the odds against him.  These early scenes set the stage for the rest of the movie:  Guido will rely on invention, humor, and persistence to protect his loved ones despite the obstacles he faces.  What begins as slapstick becomes heartbreaking later.  Like all stories of the Holocaust, this film has its grim side, but Benigni relies heavily on exaggerated humor, running gags, and an early circus-like atmosphere to set up the emotional power of the time's reality.  Most of the atrocities are implied, not witnessed, and the viewer's own knowledge of the time period creates an additional layer of tension.<br />Roberto Benigni is superb as Guido; his antics are hilarious, but during more dire moments, emotions flash across his face, revealing both the depth of his character and the reality of his position.  Nicoletta Braschi is also good, and little Giorgio Cantinini as Guido?s son Joshua is adorably spunky, especially as he questions his father's stories.<br />I always advocate watching foreign films in the original language, with subtitles, but I understand that some viewers may not like \\"reading\\" a movie.  In this case, however, the dubbed version was distracting, as Benigni provides the English track for his own character while American voices dub the rest of the cast.  His Italian accent amid the American accents completely broke the illusion for me.  Still, if a dubbed version is the only way you'll watch this movie, please do it.<br />I highly recommend \\"Life is Beautiful.\\" Its offbeat approach remains unparalleled in the canon of Holocaust movies.  Because of the absence of explicit violence and sex, viewers as young as thirteen should admire this extraordinary film.d version was distracting, as Benigni provides the English track for his own character while American voices dub the rest of the cast.

B00005JLXE|1.0|Okay, let first say that when I saw this movie in the theater I found it tollerable despite the fact that one of the worst actors EVER is playing the lead character.  Having said that, I bought the movie the day it came out and watched it again (of course) I would have to say I did a 180 on Daredevil.  It is one of the most GOD-AWFUL piles of garbage I have ever seen.  The acting was bad, the plot was razor......I just can't say enough bad things about this movie.  They changed the character of Daredevil from a protector to a man that seeks revenge.  Lawyer by day (and if the person he's up against goes free) he the executioner by night.  Thats not Daredevil at all.  <BR>They gave Daredevil the ability to leap really high, almost jumping over buildings,  he's has no such powers.  He just has super senses.  I wish these directors would stop changing superheros to their own vision.  They should keep these stories true to the comics.<BR>The fight at the end with the Kingpin was too short.  It was such a let down.  Also by the end of the movie almost everyone found out who the DareDevil is.  Don't superheros know how to keep their secret identities anymore.<BR>The only bright spot of the movie is Bullseye.  Colin Farrell should have been DareDevil.  He's a better actor than Affleck.<BR>Anyway........if you don't heed my warnings, good luck, watch with caution and a big bucked for your vomit.
B00005MAM2|5.0|I loved Akira the original, but I had to watch it twice to fully understand it. Now with the new translation I saw the story line better explained. Everything about this DVD is top notch and definetly worth the money. so many features. so many extras its just too good to be true, but guess what it is true. What more can I say? go out and get it.
B000002OX5|5.0|Simply put &quot;the who sell out&quot; is the best album from 1967 ( or early 1968 depending on which side of the Atlantic you were on). I know this says alot considering &quot;sgt. peppers&quot; comes from that year as well as many other classics,but i hold firm to my belief. To begin with &quot;The Who Sell Out&quot; IS the first concept album. A common theme runs through out the first side and now that it has been remastered with several bonus tracks this is even more obvious. &quot;Sell Out&quot; is a psychedelic album but not as far out (nor overproduced) as &quot;Sgt. Peppers&quot;. It still contains a simplicity about it in terms of sound. Plus it shows a unique sense of humour missing on so many &quot;serious&quot; bands (the beatles, floyd) at the time. But the only way to expierience this one one is to buy it and listen to it with soem friends or alone and you'll see what i mean.
B00005J6UP|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies. everything in here is great. I loved th extras and I'm happy to finally see the giant squid. The commentary was even great. This is a must by if you are a movie buff.
B00005JKZV|5.0|There are many people who are Tolkien purists, I have read LOTR so many times I have lost count. That being said I believe that Peter Jackson has done a superb job thus far. Anyone could nit pick but I believe that we as the audience owe it to the director to suspend all the pride and predjudice and watch as he unfolds the story for us. He has done everything that he could, and more, to follow the path of the ring-bearers, as well as the other main characters. As the story teller, he has remained true, without getting us lost in all the flash of special effects. For those who enjoy epic tales, these movies are what you need.
B00004VVNB|5.0|I've seen this movie a million times but the DVD makes it even better.Check it out its got some cool featurettes on it and the trailor. This is a real treat for fans of the movie.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|I'm alittle confused by previous reviews.I think it was a great action movie sequel.Not only did the action scenes blow me away but the twists and turns of the plot were excellent.Matrix reloaded was the perfect sequel...no not as original but it did take us further down that rabbit hole.

B00006JDVV|1.0|Lets face it, this movie stank!<br />Talk about taking a really excellent idea and just destroying it...<br />The basic plot line is that a dormant dragon has awakened and multiplies to, in effect, create (yet another) post appocalyptic world in which man has to fend for himself in a medieval type setting.<br />When I saw the trailers and clips from this film I thought it was going to be excellent, but what I found was a uninteresting story about a bunch of people arguing about tomatoes and a supposedly highly skilled team of dragon slayers that loose half their crew everytime the kill one dragon..<br />My personal opinion is that this movie has wasted what could have been top notch idea and has prevented any decent dragon movies to be made for a while<br />Stay away
B000099T2L|5.0|When I first got this album, and listened to the songs, I was really impressed.Beyonce did a really great job.The egyptian-like Baby Boy(wich features Sean Paul)has a really catchy but cool beat.Signs feat.Missy Elliot is really smooth.She and Missy did good.Signs should be the next single.And Crazy In Love is why I got this album.Congratulations to Beyonce on winning the award for Best R&B single.You deserve it.
0792162803|5.0|Superstar is one of those movies that you will never get bored with. It's one of those movies that you watch when you are sad. It will cheer you up within the first 5 minutes! The movie was made based on the success of the comedy routine on Saturday Night Live. They really should have made a movie about the Gap Girls before Chris Farely died. The movie is about a girl named Mary who does not fit in and wants to be a superstar and get a movie star kiss. The school holds a talent contest and the winner gets a free trip to Hollywood to be and extra in a movie. Mary knows that this is her chance. The dvd features are theatrical trailer,set up and scene selection. I would reccomend this for anyone who likes Saturday Night Live.
B0000AM6LY|5.0|Mick Hucknall has one of those instantly recognizable voices.  So it was that a friend was playing Home when I called her and heard it in the background. &quot;New Simply Red album?&quot; &quot;Buy it, just buy it&quot;, she said. I'm glad I did.  It's a great cd, rich and lush and warm and bouncy and grooving.  Enjoy.
B00005JKJA|5.0|A thousand question-marks play tricks to your mind. Your brain enters an unknown, almost terrifying, previously undreamed territory. More questions, yet no answers. A mysterious car accident, a spooky diner, some very bad espresso, a scary cowboy and a troubled film director -in kool glasses- who talks and says \\"this is the girl!\\" A real puzzling plot! Great acting, gorgeous women in beautiful erotic scenes, wonderful music and a few absorbing singing performances by some really good artists. More question-marks arise as you watch on... Some clues are given as to what's going on but Lynch never reveals what's really happening. He wants you to figure it out yourself! In the end you end up with some answers but not ALL the answers; and that's what makes a film interesting (to me anyway). When you watch Mulholland Dr your mind travels somewhere so deep -a mixture of a dream and a nightmare- that it wants to stay there forever! Couldn't sleep for 3 days...  <br />Although I've seen MD for the first time a year ago (I've seen it 7-8 times since), I can't stop myself watching it over and over again!!! <br />GTG now and watch it one more time! <br />Silencio...
1400031362|5.0|Mma Ramotswe moves her detective agency to Mr. Matekoni's garage and arranges for her secretary and asistant to do office work for Mr. Matekoni.  These steps together with the rental on the building used initially for the agency should serve to result in sufficient savings to insure the financial viability of the detective agency.  Mma Ramotswe learns from his apprentices that Mr. Matekoni has lost interest in the garage.  <br />Mma Makitsi, the assistant, decides to buy a doughnut to celebrate her new duties and promotion. The house of Mr. Matekoni is unkempt.  Mma Ramotswe goes to consult Dr. Moffat.  She is advised by him that Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni might be depressed.  Mma Makutsi is to function as the acting manager of the garage.  <br />A detective helps people in need to resolve the unresolved questions in their lives.  It is important to remember that every story has two sides.  A good mechanic understands cars.  The apprentices were a charity of Mr. Matekoni.  He thought trained mechanics were needed to replace his generation.  Mma Makutsi coordinates the work of the apprentices.  <br />Mma Ramotswe believes that the ordinary people of Africa  do not have room in their hearts for hatred.  Moral codes aree not designed to be selective.  Mostly it is about doing the right thing.  <br />Mma Ramotswe is distantly related to the woman who runs the orphanage.  She goes out to investigate the case of a seemingly feral child.  The boy cannot speak and smelled like a lion when picked up by the authorities.  <br />Then Mma Ramotswe is called upon to invesigate the motives of the sister-in-law of a government man.  In the meantime her assistant is to investigate the background of the contestants in a beauty and integrity event and to help run the garage while Mr. Matekoni recovers from his illness.  As usual, the writing is superb and the events described are of great interest.
B00005JLWN|1.0|When I rented EQUILIBRIUM today, I was drawn in by the story and the trailers featuring the fight scenes. The story begins when World War 3 occurs in the form of stock footage. The dictators of the time blame the arts for humanity's ability to wage war against each other(clock the images of Saddam - are the anti-Iraq war brigade involved here?!) and for influencing human emotions; so a new drug, Prozium(!?) is invented which people take by law to repress emotion and form a collective like the Borg in STAR TREK. Christian Bale(REIGN OF FIRE) plays cleric John Preston, an enforcer of the repressed emotion policies who suddely and very predictably becomes disillusioned and joins the other side, a resisitance movement. His superiors take note and send their own men after him, and the slow pacing of the first half degenerates into MATRIX rip off fight scenes, which while well staged, were too short to add any true excitement. Just what was this movie trying to be - art house pretentious rubbish or a cut-price MATRIX? Jan De Bont produced this, too, in my opinion, his career hit a low with SPEED 2 and has been going downhill ever since, with the obvious exception of MINORITY REPORT, which is far far superior. If you want to see a better version of this story, try the original inspiration, FAHRENHEIT 451, which is a true sci-fi classic. EQUILIBRIUM is the perfect waste of one hour and forty three minutes of anybody's life. And what the hell was the great Sean Bean thinking appearing in it?
B000002C25|3.0|The main thing that killed this album is that there are decent four-minute pop songs concealed in an average of 6 and sometimes even 9 minutes of repetition. It's unfortunate that the cocaine got to the entire band so much that they didn't bother to edit the album into the magnificent follow-up to &quot;Morning Glory&quot; that was waiting to burst out.<BR>There are massive guitars on all of these guitars, a huge wall of sound that sounds great nice and loud. Unfortunately, Oasis got too laid back and took their sweet time with nearly all of these songs. Not that they've ever done a fast three minute rocker, but a lot of these songs would have sounded much better in that fashion.<br />D'You Know What I Mean?: almost eight minutes of huge guitars and arrogant lyrics, great opener. A+<BR>My Big Mouth: a roaring rocker, hilariously over-the-top lyrics. A<BR>Magic Pie: the melody is brilliant, could have been so much better minus about three minutes. B+<BR>Stand By Me: not the Ben King classic, but a great song nonetheless. A-<BR>I Hope, I Think, I Know: more arrogant lyrics, and a lenght that begs editing. B+<BR>The Girl in the Dirty Shoes: could have been SO good with a shorter ending!! this way, just merely good. A-<BR>Fade In-Out: Johnny Depp drops by and lays down a competent slide guitar. menacing good song, but again, way too long. B+<BR>Don't Go Away: classic Oasis, great song altogether, and a lenght that fits. A<BR>Be Here Now: *sigh* more editing...this is getting boring. A-<BR>All Around the World: if you're gonna try to do another &quot;Hey Jude&quot; at least have a brilliant outro. good song, decent outro, but waaaay too long. A-<BR>It's Getting Better (Man!!): not really. a song this anthemic cannot trudge for seven minutes. B+<BR>All Around the World (Reprise): aww heck, let's stretch the song to eleven total minutes. B-<br />I think it's a genuine shame that these songs are so bloated, because there's real good songs getting dragged down in their lenght: four seven-minute songs and one nine-minutes, this album just goes on too long and killed Oasis' megastardom. Of course, the anticipation for this album was deafening: you were expecting Jesus himself to show up in London on August 26 to pick up the album. There is no excusing the absurd lenght, especially after the lean and mean 50 minutes of &quot;Morning Glory&quot;. I am willing to bet that had this album been about 20 minutes shorter, it would be much more acclaimed. Terrible shame, I'd love to see a sober version of it.
B00008H2LB|5.0|OK... to begin with... the album's a list topper, literally. If you are a nu metal fan, then this is a definite buy. I'll break down the songs and give you a moderate disc. about 'em all!!<br />1. Foreword - Acts as an intro for 'Don't Stay'<BR>2. Dont Stay - Brilliant beginning for the album, and really gets         you in the mood for what's to come. (4/5)<BR>3. Somewhere I belong - Probably the most promoted song on the radio, so I don't need to say anything about this. (4/5)<BR>4. Lying from you - Great starting, great chorus (surprised Chester didn't end up with a hoarse throat!) great ending. (5/5)<BR>5. Hit the floor - Good example of Jo's turntable talent. Hard lyrics. (4/5)<BR>6. Easier to run - Probably the best song on the disk. Has a emotional and desperate touch to it, you'll be wanting to hear this one again and again. (5/5)<BR>7. Faint - Simply, its a brilliant song with great rapping lyrics. (4/5)<BR>8. Figure 09 - Strange title, gr8 song, with a good beat. 4/5)<BR>9. Breaking the Habit - Deep thoughts gone into this song, so a difinite winner. (4/5)<BR>10. From the inside - Back to hard rock, although more could have been done on the words. (3.5/5)<BR>11. Nobody's Listening - The unique song on the disk. You gotta hear it to believe that it's by a rock band. (4/5)<BR>12. Session - The instrumental (remember 'cure for the itch'!), great turntable solos, made me learn the turntable myself. (5/5)<BR>13. Numb - Brilliant finish, makes you wanna siong along with Chester. Well Done! (4/5)<br />All over, I'll give the album a 4/5 and two big thumbs up! Well done guys, and keep up the brilliant work!!!!
B000022TSW|4.0|It all boils down to this: only buy this movie if you like foul language and everything South Park stands for. I'll tell you all right now that I enjoyed this movie, but I am a South Park fan, and I can easily see how a great number of people would not (enjoy it, that is).
B00009V8Z9|5.0|I heard him on Carson Daly's talk show late at night one time where he sang Chariot and a cover of another song.  I fell in love with his voice.  I got his cd two days after it came out and have listened to it religiously ever since.  It's amazing and I would highly reccomend it.
B00009YXAD|5.0|In my opinion this is Neil Young's best recording ever.  The remastering of this disc brings forth every note (and then some) that I remember as a young teenager when this album was first released. This imported limited edition contains a replica of the original album cover, the original record sleeve and also has the same multi-colored floral design inside the album cover. If you liked this album before, then you'll love the cd version even more. If you're a fan then you won't be disappointed.
0345457684|5.0|This is one of the best new SF novels I've read in the last ten years.<br /><br />It's enough of a treat that Richard Morgan can _write_. The author bio indicates that he taught English as a second language for some fourteen years; he can teach a thing or two to us native speakers as well. His narrative and his dialogue are clean, crisp, and focused, with that sense of heightened reality you get from really good fiction; there's not a word out of place, and there's none of the mannered artificiality of e.g. Frank Herbert's _Dune_.<br /><br />But it's even better than good writing. Morgan has applied his craft to a brand of fiction that one of the cover blurbs describes as a cross between hard-core cyberpunk and hard-boiled detective fiction. That's an odd description of the genre and makes it sound newer than it is, but it's true that there hasn't been a lot of SF detective fiction. And Morgan's contribution advances the ball considerably.<br /><br />If you're at all familiar with the genre, you're already thinking of Larry Niven's ARM stories (and maybe, though less aptly, of Asimov's _The Caves of Steel_ and _The Naked Sun_). Well, Morgan's world does owe something to Niven's, but he's got very much his own spin. His main character (Takeshi Kovacs), though arguably more Mike Hammer than Hiro Protagonist despite the snowcrashy backdrop, will remind longtime fen of the wisecracking tough-guy heroes that have populated SF since at least the days of Keith Laumer (not to mention Harry Harrison's Stainless Steel Rat). But he's not just a carbon copy (even an altered one).<br /><br />And Morgan has found a very interesting way around a problem that has plagued detective fiction since its inception: when your narrative is written in the first person, how do you keep the reader from figuring out that the narrator doesn't get killed? Oh, you can do a Jim Thompson and have the character narrate his own death, but otherwise there aren't too many possibilities.<br /><br />Morgan has discovered one. As you'll learn within the first few pages, Kovacs has _already_ died at least once, and there's nothing to keep him from dying again, perhaps repeatedly; for reasons that will be clear early on, his death wouldn't keep him from narrating the novel.<br /><br />The plot is ingenious: it seems that one Laurens Bancroft has committed suicide, but Bancroft himself believes he was murdered and hires Our Hero to investigate. (Yes, you read that correctly; the alleged murder victim wants to know how he was killed.) Beyond that, I'm not going to tell you anything that might spoil your fun.<br /><br />I _will_ tell you to keep your eyes peeled for a huge number of incredibly cool background details. Like Heinlein, Morgan drops you into the middle of the tale and introduces you to its world in the natural course of the narrative, rather than calling attention to it tourist-fashion.

If you've spent the last decade or two wondering where all the really good SF has gone, check this one out. It's already on my best-of-recent-SF shortlist, alongside some Alastair Reynolds, China Mieville, Neal Stephenson, and a very small handful of others.ithin the first few pages, Kovacs has _already_ died at least once, and there's nothing to keep him from dying again, perhaps repeatedly; for reasons that will be clear early on, his death wouldn't keep him from narrating the novel.    The plot is ingenious: it seems that one Laurens Bancroft has committed suicide, but Bancroft himself believes he was murdered and hires Our Hero to investigate. (Yes, you read that correctly; the alleged murder victim wants to know how he was killed.) Beyond that, I'm not going to tell you anything that might spoil your fun.    I _will_ tell you to keep your eyes peeled for a huge number of incredibly cool background details. Like Heinlein, Morgan drops you into the middle of the tale and introduces you to its world in the natural course of the narrative, rather than calling attention to it tourist-fashion.

B000002J20|1.0|Quite surprisingly, there was a mistake with the cover when I bought this record. Besides, why did the band replace Peter Gabriel with a clone of Jon Anderson? Apart from that, you can clearly recognize Steve Hackett's guitar play and Phil Collins' drumming. Mike Rutherford has a rawer sound that usual, but that's him with no doubt (basic but efficient bass lines) and Tony Banks is still the same great virtuoso, although his Minimoog sounds a little cheap. But why the hell do they only play one after another on this record? And why these hippy versions of Supper's Ready and Watcher Of The Skies? This album is supposed to be experimental, not only because of the tracks' running time - so why do I feel that it's been done before (and better)? <br />OK, I think you got the point.
0783222955|5.0|The source of the movie is the Pulitzer Prize novel of the same name by Harper Lee, one of the most beloved works of literature.<br /><br />What is the film about?  Its themes cover a wide range -- race, parenting, morality, and justice.  However, all these issues can be summed up in one concept repeated over and over again:  seeing a situation from the perspective of another person.  Atticus says to his children that it is a sin to kill a mockingbird, because all it does is sing.  Through Atticus, the children come to see the mockingbird in an unjustly persecuted black man as well as in the ghostly-white neighborhood bogeyman.  But in small ways, we see the mockingbird in a poor farm boy, a querulous spinster, even in a man involved in a lynching attempt and in a woman committing perjury.  (One criticism:  the movie does not have time to explore the surprisingly noble qualities of two of the least appealing characters in the novel, Mrs. Dubose and Mr. Raymond.)  Imagine how different our world would be if we treated everyone with the dignity afforded them by Atticus Finch.<br /><br />Alan Pakula gives every detail of his production exquisite attention.  The screenplay by Horton Foote deftly trims details and enhances other aspects of the novel without changing its spirit.  The score by Elmer Bernstein moves the heart, especially in the opening sequence that perfectly captures the playful wonder of a child.  The direction by Robert Mulligan brings out the very best in his actors.<br /><br />Cinema has rarely assembled such a talented cast.  After MOCKINGBIRD, Gregory Peck was defined by his portrayal of Atticus Finch, the widowed lawyer explaining the complicated issues of life to his two children, leading by impeccable example to do right no matter how difficult the circumstances.  Mary Badham and Phillip Alford are two of the best child actors ever.  Robert Duvall, in his Hollywood debut, gives a riveting performance as a shy recluse, even though he barely speaks.<br /><br />TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD tells us that even in the confusing complexities of the real world, one can still persevere and make the world a better place.  This movie is cinema at its finest.D tells us that even in the confusing complexities of the real world, one can still persevere and make the world a better place.

0783226063|4.0|You will either love or hate &quot;Dune&quot;. If you have read the book, then it is likely you will enjoy the film - the actors are fabulous, the special effects are fine for 1984 and the imagery is accurate. If you have not read the book, then you will probably find the film confusing as the novel is quite complex.<br />I always enjoy watching David Lynch's &quot;Dune&quot; but have never seen the 'Smithee' version, so I can't compare them. I would, however, love to see Lynch edit this movie again. I'm sure there is quite a lot of film on the cutting-room floor that could be inserted into the original. Fans would love to see it. I also believe Lynch's version is far superior to the mini-series starring William Hurt - for many reasons, least of all faithfulness to the novel.<br />Despite its poor reviews, &quot;Dune&quot; is a classic. One must understand the complexity of the novel and the difficulty in translating it across media. Take this into account and enjoy it.
6305841861|5.0|No, Gorror is NOT a real word.  It is a word I use to describe awsome, gory movies.  If you are into gore, and perhaps a little comedy, you should view this fine cinematic masterpiece.  I don't want to give away any details of this movie, like countless other reviews have done, but I must say, this is probably one of the most entertaining movies I have ever seen.  If you are not a big fan of Gory movies, you should check out the excellent sequel to Evil Dead 2, titled &quot;Army of darkness&quot;.  All three titles in the evil dead trilogy are entertaing, each in a different way.  The first one is a Horror movie, The second on is horror/comedy, and the third one is action/horror/comedy.  But if there is one thing that all these movies all have in common, it is that they are all excellent, and all have Bruce Campbell in them.
B00005JLZN|4.0|The Life of David Gale is now among my favorite movies ever made.  As a high school teacher, I have every intention of showing this movie to my U.S. Government class when discussing public policy and an example of a classical controversial issue - the death penalty.<br />This movie truly hit home for me!  Although I have already long held the position of being opposed to the death penalty, this movie only reinforces my stance and proves that the system is not always right, hence justice is denied to those that fall victim to the system's flaws.<br />Kevin Spacey and Kate Winslow should have received Oscars for their performances in this movie, because I truly believe they did a superb job!<br />A must watch for all....
B00000G3Q4|5.0|Evil Dead is probably the most grusome of the Evil Dead Trilogy, which consists of Evil Dead, Evil Dead 2, and Army of Darkness.  You will enjoy Evil Dead if you like seeing people get eyes gouged out, stabed with pencils, hacked to pieces, and rotting corpses exploding.  I definantly enjoyed this modern masterpiece, and director Sam Raimi, though on a tight budget, still manages quite good special effects (i've seen movies made after this on a bigger budget that have worse special effects).  Get this movie if you enjoyed George Romero's Night of the Living Dead.  Awsome.  Five stars

B000092ZYY|5.0|Just returned from watching the HTTT tour in Vancouver...AWESOME! Easily the best album since ok computer.<br />now it took me about 10 listenings to really get to like the album (with a few exceptions), so i'm glad I waited before giving it 5 stars.<br />dense, lush, moody and sometimes incomprehensible, a very complex album. And for all the yokels complaining about the left leaning slants of their lyrics-don't buy the album!<br />The beauty of Radiohead, is that THEY DON'T CARE! Like real artists, they do what they like, and if you love it great, if you hate it, that's fine too...they are brave enough to write the music they like and to hell with anyone else!<br />killer album, that will be remembered loooong after some of this other trash is forgotten....
B000001Y5J|4.0|This is a pretty good album. This is one of the better idustrial/Metal albums I have heard. I bought this because I like the song 'Last' and I listened to the whole thing and thought it was really good. Trent Rezner wrights some really good lyrics, and his lyric ability doesnt fall short here on Broken. I cant belive Trant plays everything on the record but like two guitar parts. He is really talented, though he is not as good as Maralen Manson, he sure can wright a better song. This album is full of great songs, you wount be dissapointed in buying this record. If you like Manson, or Ministry, then trust me you will like this it has everything a good Industioal/Metal album needs. The guitar is good for this genra, and the beats and rythms are great. For someone new to this genra or to NIN I would recemend This or The Downward Spiral, both of with are by NIN.
B000003TSP|5.0|The second album by one of two signature bands of trip hop. (The other being Massive Attack. And the two bands are actually closely related: Portishead founder Geoff Barrow was an early Massive Attack collaborator.) Portishead's first album, Dummy, helped define trip hop, adding sexy tragic singing that's more reminiscent of cabaret than rock, and space-age retro sounds like theramin and early synths, to the beats and DJ mixing that had identified the genre, and slowing the beats down ever more. But this second album, which came out three years later, is a more mature, better crafted, and actually much more bleak album. This is one of the most depressing records ever made, but done so beautifully that you are enraptured. (Have you noticed I like sad music?) Some music snobs complain about the poor sound quality of Portishead records, but that's worse than silly. It's part of the ethos. Barrow goes for a sound, not perfection. The result is electronic music that is entirely real and accessible.
B00008OWZC|5.0|Its no secret that Led Zeppelin was one of the best live acts in rock history! How The West Was Won lets you know why. Jimmy Page's solos are even better then that of on Zeppelins albums, Robert Plants voice sounds nice and flows great. John Paul Jones, plays his bass and Synth's like a mad man. But John 'Bonzo' Bonham plays the worlds greatest drum solo on 'Moby Dick' its like 10 minutes long, and when my dad told me that I was like that will be boaring, well its not, it is just down right mind blowing, there is no other way to put it besides mind blowing. About 5 minutes through the solo 'Bonzo' still shows no signs of being tierd and then picks up pace and does double time! A few songs on this record are 20 minutes long, but its great, because you get a medle of songs in the mix, like 'Dazed And Confuesed' mixes the 'Crunge' form Houses Of The Holy in their. These recordings were made before PG so this is just the first 5 Zeppelin albums, but its all the good stuff, you will not be let down this is truly one of the best, if not the best live album you will ever listen own, and listen to in your whole life!
B00005B4GU|5.0|Amnesiac / Kid A - first, in defense of combining the two albums: they are part of the same recording sessions. The Amnesiac material simply had a somewhat different tone and didn't fit on the first album. I happen to have a less popular preference for the second release, Amnesiac, and would choose it if I could only pick one. Kid A was a wonderful shock for the many Radiohead fans and college radio listeners who had never heard ambient music before. But I trace my ambient music listening back to the 70s, so for me it was not a watershed event. Also, many of the trademark ambient sounds on Kid A were, if anything, perhaps a little too close to contemporary work by the likes of Aphex Twin, Autechre and Future Sound of London, which I was very familiar with. Nonetheless, these two albums are the best of 90s ambient because Radiohead brought a masterful level of songwriting to an often incoherent genre. Technically, Radiohead doesn't do pure ambient, but combines it with drone-like strumming guitar soundscapes and structures it into songs. The result is a lot more listenable than most of the genre.
B00004XPP0|5.0|These movies have it all, action, adventure, love, and one hec of a PLOT! It is a wonderland for the imagination.  It is a classic tale with a space adventure twist.

B00005176F|5.0|I had purchased their self title album before this one, and was so pleased with how good this one was that I now own all of the blur albums. I can see that there is some debate to whom is better, blur or oasis, the answer is clear, blur. Oasis continues to write good songs but they all sound the same, blur continues to write amazing songs that sounds very much different, but they are consistantly good, plus blur has much more instrumental diversity, such as saxophones in their songs. Oasis is about a B grade band, but blur no question is an A+!
B0000256KE|5.0|The second, and best, Roxy album, and the last before Eno left the group. For me, this choice is the most rooted in personal nostalgia. While I do think it stands worthy in a top 10 list, its presence here is admittedly partly because Roxy Music was pivotal for me, and this album more than any other. As an early teen, I was blindsided by this lush, complex, and defiantly sexy sound. Half from Brian Ferry's James Bondish presence, half from the experimental rock backing him, I was changed. I would lay in my room at night with headphones on listening to Roxy Music for hours. In Every Dreamhome A Heartache is simultaneously beautiful, silly, sexy, absurd, epic. It just dares you to not smile, and swoon.
B00005176F|5.0|blur is a much better band than oasis, they have much more diversity in their songs, unlike oasis which every song consists of &quot;la la la la la i love you girl&quot;
B00004RD54|5.0|This live album should be credited more to the band behind Lou Reed. It stands as one of the most influential guitar albums in rock. The mixture of raw artistry and clever jamming makes it just as fresh on the thousandth listen. And it beautifully captures the sleazy decadence of glam better than any other record.
B000099T2L|3.0|Beyonce has a nice cd. There are only a couple of songs that are great...of course Crazy In Love,Baby Boy, Id Rather Be With You,Dangerously in Love 2,and Signs. Yes and Naughty Girl are ok but the rest suck..and Im sorry Beyonce cannot dance she tries but thats all she can do
B00004STPT|5.0|As much as I adore all the work of former Dead Can Dance cofounder Lisa Gerrard - I think she's one of the best talents in music today - much of it is quite dark and ominous, great for the right mood, but not too often. In this album, though, her collaborator, the veteran film composer Hans Zimmer, fills the role previously manned not very well by Dead Can Dance partner Brendan Perry. That is, he adds melody and lightness and some coherence. While Perry drew from corny 70s Greg Lake-like prog rock, Zimmer brings more classical tones into the mix. Except for the \\"pop\\" closer duet with Enya, the entire work is without lyrics, instead just Gerrard's lyricless chanting. I would have liked more of her singing, but the result is timeless. But the point here is not what was wrong with Dead Can Dance, it's what's right with this album. A beautiful flowing magnificent work that takes you through a range of emotions and styles, with strong recurring themes, like any great film soundtrack - or for that matter classical work - it mixes Gerrard's ominous chilling sounds and themes with Zimmer's grandeur, taking you through tensions, then closures. Immensely satisfying.
B000062YB1|5.0|This is the third Slayer album i bought and it is now one of my favorite of all time. Its classic thrash metal, but not up to scale with Reign In Blood. It is very good, but not as brutal as Reign in Blood. The songs on Seasons are longer than on the previous two albums. And this albums is still fast ... thrash metal from beginning to end. The brutal opener War Ensemble already lets you know how good this album is. Other standouts are Expendable Youth, Hallowed Point,and the title track. Tom Araya has covered controversial subjects before on other albums like \\"Angel of Death\\" which documented atrocities performed at Auschwitz by Nazi SS Surgeon Josef Mengele, which you can find on Reign In Blood. Another one is \\"Silent Scream\\" which is about the horrors of abortion, which is on South of Heaven. But Seasons also has its own song the chilling \\"Dead Skin Mask\\" which is about serial killer Ed Gein. Over all, Seasons in the Abyss is always going to be my second favorite Slayer album. If you dont own this one already, you have to buy it. Trust me on this one.
B000006045|5.0|The definitive album of trip hop. There are several distinct versions of the trip hop sound and Massive's work is in the dub-based vein. It doesn't have the pop accessibility of some, or the lo-fi aesthetic of DJ culture. (Mezzanine is a production masterwork.) The unlikely pairing of English alternative folk and electronic music made beautiful music in the 90s, though it never caught on in the States. Mezzanine is the greatest expression of this genre. Massive dates back to the 80s as a collective linked to Soul II Soul that also spawned -- besides Tricky -- Portishead, Smith & Mighty, and producers who crafted many of the other definitive electronic records (like Sneaker Pimps' Becoming X and the mid-90s work by Madonna and Bjork). It's hard to say whether trip hop would have happened without them. But their own records are uneven, probably reflecting the internal tensions and committee-style decision making. This one record, Mezzanine, finds them at the peak of their game, and teams them with one of the best of all British alt-folk singers, the Cocteau Twins' Elizabeth Frazier. The result is a chillingly beautiful masterwork.
6301174240|5.0|As a huge MJ fan i know that Michael likes to create mini movies through his videos (thriller). Followng a few other videos (badder and speed demon) the best part starts. The storys plot is centered around an evil drug supplier who wants to get kids hooked on drugs all around the world.Its up to Mchael to save the day, encluding an AMAZING smooth criminal performance that never gets old. The story ends with Michael singing &quot;come together&quot; and put a spectacular finish on the whole thing. IT IS WORTH EVERY PENNY YOU SPEND!! YOU WONT REGRET IT!! michael's talent will astonish you!!
B00005R87Q|2.0|Basically POINT BREAK with souped up cars instead of surfboards.  Not much in the story and action dept., this flick has the momentum of a tricked-out pedestrian.
0553212478|4.0|This book was so close to being the best horror novel ever written.  It just lacked a couple of things.  The most important being a good description of what the monster looked like, granted it was fun to make up the image yourself.  One of the reasons why I personally think it is a bit on the short side and does lack some description is that it was written for a friendly writing contest by Mary Shelly, her husband and some friends.  However anyone who considers themselves well read even if they are not a fan of horror should read this book.  It is very good and at only just over 200 pgs (most editions) it is not a time consuming book.
B00009RDG9|4.0|For the most part, when you catch a trailer like the one for THE HUNTED, you expect a run of the mill yarn with a plot that is predictable aand slow.  This is not the case, however, THE HUNTED is a mature and stylish action potboiler with no fluff and some good old american violence.  What transpires is a taut cat and cat game (forget the mouse) that culminates to a great showdown.  Both leads are cooly effective, especially TOMMY LEE JONES who shines in a role that is thankfully a lot different than his turn in both FUGITIVE movies.  At just under ninety minutes, this film is a nice change from usual Hollywood fodder.  Most of the thanks goes to director WILLIAM FREIDKIN who, given a good script, knows how to craft an enjoyable movie.  The disc features great sound and picture as well.  If you like a good grounded action thriller hunt down this DVD.
B000059XUO|4.0|This is by far the only one in the entire series that is worth watching.  However it is very good and stands by itself as a cult classic.  The visuals in this movie are great the story is a very haunting one.  Brandon Lee was taking from us too soon as this movie proved he was going to make great films.  A great edition to anyone's movie library.
6304025831|5.0|Another great Scorcese Picture. Deniro is back as Sam Rothstein, the man who runs the Tangiers Hotel and Casino, and the mobs operation of skimming the money. His backup is Joe Pesci as Nicky Santoro nuch like Tommy( his role from Goddefellas), he is a ruthless s.o.b. who will take anybody out. In this film he stabs a man with a pen, shoots a woman in her own kitchen and puts a guy's head in a vice grip. Also in the film is Sharon Stone as Ginger, Sam's wife who betrays him. This movie is about a different Las Vegas, the one the mob ran. But in the end, what goes up must come down. The glitz, glamour, and great cast which also includes James Woods, Frank Vincent, Alan King,and more add up to one thing..... a great film. One of my favorites
0767817478|1.0|Here it is, what every Godzilla fan wanted. Hollywood and a big budget, and this is all we got? First off, the French? The French saves the day? Please, my mother can beat the French. Second, a lame storyline, it is like Jurassic Park in NYC. Babyzilla's that look like raptors. The king of all movie mistakes, you have a product that fans all around the world know, and YOU CHANGE IT? Give me a man in a rubber suit that looks like a T-Rex than a CGI iguana on steroids? No radioactive fire-breath, no one running thru the streets of NYC screaming Godzilla! Thank God, Toho came out with Godzilla 2000 and basically said \\"Forgive us for letting Hollywood make that horrible movie! Here is what you wanted!\\"
B00009Y3L4|1.0|I too had great expectation of this reissue and the main reason I purchased it was for the stated anamorphic enhancement which it definitely is not. With all the interest in Kander &amp; Ebb at the moment, this was a perfect opportunity to revamp a truely classic movie and address the poor transfer of the original issue. Warner are clearly just jumping on the promotional bandwagon with little concern for the value of the movie itself. This is Liza's finest moment and a critic's dream of cinematic metaphor and construction- it deserves better than this. It saddens me to think that it is unlikely  to be issued again- the best Warner can do is recall this rerelease and do the job properly. I now own three versions on DVD- the region 2 uk release is even more washed out than the USA issue!
B00004VXF2|5.0|i found this album in a used bin at some weird record store. after reading the description on the back of the cd, i had to hear it. of course, the cashier warned me &quot;you knwo this isnt music right?&quot; i replied yeah. i have since listened to it once through, and am in the process of doing so again.  this is an album to take your mind of things. just try to listen to each individual &quot;instrument&quot; (read: sound reed gets from guitar feedback) being a noise enthusiuest, this is now my bible of weirdness. the way i described it to a friend is &quot;if you wanted a soundtrack for a journey through a lunatic's mind, this is it.&quot; just sit back and listen, and let the harmonic hallucinations take you over. this is THE SOUND of chaos. and chaos is beauty.
0385504209|3.0|This is not a deep book. It reads more like one of the Hardy Boys meeting up with Nancy Drew in adulthood. The writing is on the same par. We have our two super sleuths, a paternal grandfather, the British \\"professor\\" (Teabing), bumbling police, good and evil secret societies, the ever-popular albino hit man, indecipherable codes (Quick, get me a mirror -- it's reversed text!), etc. The shortwave radio has been replaced by black light pens, transponders and GPS tracking. There are many chapters. But no fear, they are all short. And though each one ends with a cliffhanger, this technique becomes tiresome. Brown, via his cartoon characters, starts out very well explaining symbology in historical art, and the way the Holy Grail plays into it. And though it is interesting, it tends to become a real stretch. (I mean please, Leonardo Da Vinci is farther removed from the days of Christ than we are to Leonardo. What would he really know? Oh, that's right -- he's part of a secret society). This subject though would incline one to read more serious books on the matter. But then Brown really sinks into absurdity, when he protracts it to Walt Disney and the \\"real\\" reason for his choices of animated stories; and further still, after Walt's death, to The Little Mermaid...and friends. (Give me a break, OK?) And later he infers, modern day pranksters flashing V-signs behind their buddies heads, when being photographed, are really unwitting participants of some ancient fertility god and horn symbology. (No Mr. Brown, trust me; those are simply bunny ears...b-u-n-n-y...not horns). If Brown believes rabbit ear pranks are serious forms of symbology; then what does that say about the rest of his \\"learned\\" hypotheses? Anyone can see any sort of symbol in anything. But Brown sees more than horsies and duckies when looking at cloud formations. Way more. This is ripe material for the all-night paranormal radio shows with their pseudo-science \\"experts\\" and conspiracy kooks. Well, I could go on and on. This book won't enhance your life, but it won't hurt it either. It's reminiscent of adolescent detective books from our past, and it was fun to go back there for a short while. It's full of cheap thrills and empty calories and therefore...a guilty pleasure. At least Scrappy Doo doesn't make an appearance.<br />I need to mention, thanks to the publishers for offering this book as an \\"ebook\\". More publishers need to wake up to this type of reading device. I normally do not read popular fiction; and if this book had not been offered as an ebook -- I NEVER would have wasted the time to purchase it.on and on.

0790733226|4.0|Though not a perfect adaptation of Sagan's book, this is fairly loyal and ends with an effect similar to the novel.<br />The cast is definitely on top of things. Jodie Foster makes an impeccable Ellie Arroway, Matthew McConaugheh an effective, if somewhat youthful Palmer Joss, a reverend and Ellie's intellectual equal; Ken Der Heer's role is significantly downsized, but for his part he does well; Tom Skerrit is a perfectly pompous Dave Drumlin; James Woods a properly militaristic Michael Kitz; and, perhaps in the film's best performance (though he certainly did not have as much work as Foster or McConaugheh), John Hurt is a KNOCKOUT as S.R. Hadden. Oh yeah, and Rob Lowe has a nice role as the Reverend Billy Joe Rankin.<br />The technical aspects are definitely all there; the opening shot is beautifully done, and the special effects are stunning throughout. Though at first I thought the idea of Ellie and Palmer getting together would ruin it, I found it did not have much ill effect. I like also how they chose not to dwell on the hypocrisies of Mr. Rankin.<br />What is missing, and I think fans of the novel will agree, are Ellie's traveling partners, particularly Vaygay. C'mon, Zemeckis, you should know by now that any movie of this sort needs a smart alecky Russian to carry it in the slow spots.<br />Still, the thought provoking story remains intact, and the film was dedicated to Sagan, whom I'm sure would have been pleased with the outcome. Well Done.

Not only is this their BEST tour (saw Music For the Masses tour and the Violater tour its their tour for their most amazing album. <BR>Aside from them being at their best, its the most beautiful shot and directed concert I've ever seen. Ive been searching high and low for this on DVD cause I lost my VHS copy and its not availible.<br />Thats a damn crime. As an act of protest I will not by the vhs cuase im way too into dvd sound now. I'm just gonna pray this comes out on DVD.
0380977788|4.0|Yes, this book is spookier than most kids' books these days.  That is a good thing.  Kids have always liked Brothers Grimm style works, and the trend of the last couple decades of sugar-coating fairy tales have only appeared to increase the violence of teenage horror stories (witness the Friday the Thirteenth flicks, for example).  As a story about a smart young girl who battles a fully imagined and quite frightening storybook villain, Coraline is top notch; and, as far as I am concerned, such stories should be far more common than they are.<br />For a funnier, yet comparable, take on the same subject as Coraline, try The Wee Free Men by Terry Pratchett, a former collaborator of the author's.  Coraline and The Wee Free Men are two different takes on the subject of one young girl fighting a particular kind of reality-altering villain.  Both books are excellent.
0380789019|4.0|Neverwhere by Neil Gaimen. Great &quot;fantasyish&quot; book about a London resident who gets caught up between two worlds. Upper London is the world we live in, ATMs, science, sunlight, etc. London Below is a world of magic, darkness, squalor, and heroics. He helps a young girl in need and gets caught up with events (in a world unknown to the rest of Upper London) that causes his identity in the &quot;real&quot; world to be erased, he has no choice but to join the world of London Below and help with a quest involving two methodical (and unstoppable) killers, a fallen angel, and a girl named &quot;Door&quot; that has power over her namesakes. Very interesting and worth a borrow from the library (or paperback purchase). Sort of fun. Great concepts and refreshingly understated (doesn't bash one world to define the other).<br />Loved the main character's decisiveness at the begining and ending critical junctures.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|You've got to give this guy credit for going on tour with a 30 year backlog of great tunes and playing his new Album front to back. I could have listened to these songs and many more like them all night long. Too bad some of the folks at the live shows just didn't get what he was doing at all (Probably the ones that shouldn't be Neil fans in the first place). Granted Neil is always better live, but Greendale is not only a given to any Neil fan, but testiment to one of Rocks greatest performers. This is just plain great music, and a great story.
6304508611|5.0|This film was a huge blockbuster when it came out. The fact that it was viewed mainly as a Teen/Slasher kind of flick tended to obscure the artistry in this film. Though primitive by today's standards, and a little amateurish around the edges, it has become and remains a classic horror film. For a generation of those who were never asked to the prom, and were nerds, geeks, etc...this film provided a cathartic come-uppance to all those who abused the \\"less-than-populars\\" in the horrific and superficial high school hierarchy. How many of us dreamt of being Carrie??!!, exacting revenge on the jock who beat the crap out of us, and the snippy prom queen who wouldn't give us the time of day? Never mind that we can now take pleasure in that the aforementioned privileged ones are more than likely overweight has-beens , while we that were abused are just coming into our lusciousness. No, we wanted BLOOD! and \\"Carrie\\" gave us all the revenge, and then some, that we would have carried out, had we had the ability. The success and power of this film is due largely to the intelligence and skill in the performances of Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie. Sissy Spacek was relatively unknown before this film, but it was a star-making role for her, and what a carrer she has forged since then. She is one of my favorite, and, I feel, most under-rated actresses. She gives Carrie a quality of such humanity, but such other-worldly strangeness, for someone with such a then very young acting career. Then, as now, it is hard to imagine anyone else in the role. And then, there's Piper Laurie, as \\"Mrs. White\\", Carrie's religious fanatic mom. Formerly a  beautiful ingenue of the films of the 1950's, Miss Laurie's career was mostly forgotten when this film came out, and, her performance, though over-the-top, was totally believable and awe-inspiring, and surprised many. A classic tour de force performance (\\"Eve was WEAK!!\\")...  She conveys all the fanaticism, guilt, and, insanity of such an extremist, and, what a wild ride she provides! She is so perfect in this role, for which I believe she was at the very least rightfully nominated for an Academy Award, that I consider her performance , at once unbelievably eerie and at times comical in its outrageousness, as one of the most brilliant in film history.  Everyone knows of the cast including then unknowns John Travolta and Amy Irving. But, it's the remarkable portrayals of Spacek and Laurie that make this film. The famous prom scene has entered film folklore, and the finale is horrifying, visually flawless, and ultimately very moving. This film was basically produced as a \\"B\\" movie. It is not a \\"big\\" film, with tons of special effects, which I never find truly \\"scary\\" anyway, I always feel they render a film sterile, with very few exceptions (Aliens.) No, it's great acting that make a memorable film experience, and  because of two wonderful portrayals, this one has become a timeless classic.and, what a wild ride she provides!

B00005JMD3|1.0|this movie was so lame. I thought it was an action film. Well lets see, its under the action category. Lets see, NO action what so ever. This moviewas soooo long and so friggin boring. I sat there in the theature hoping the god Da#$ movie would get more exciting. DONT SEE IT, THIS MOVIE SUCKS, ITS BORING AND STUPID.
B00004SYWZ|4.0|It's about TIME!!!! After seven years without word, A-ha drop back by with a third consecutive awesome set which more than makes up for the lagging STAY ON THESE ROADS. In some ways this brings back the A-ha of 1985 &quot;Take On Me&quot; fame with a bit more lush production, though tasteful. Songs like &quot;Minor Earth   Major Sky&quot; and &quot;Thought That It Was You&quot; show a bit of that poppiness that A-ha has always shown to be capable of (only being dangerously close to overdoing it in 1988). They still cling to that band sound though with &quot;You Will Never Get Over Me&quot; and &quot;Mary Ellen Makes the Moment Count&quot;. Great album which begins bogging down in the middle, but quickly picks back up. All in all, it's good to have the guys back for another round.
B00005JLEX|5.0|I live in Buenos Aires, Argentina and Im still looking for the Soup Nazi. In the Soup Nazi episode somebody said that he came to this country after Elaine screwed his business once she found those recipes. I wonder who would said such a lie...Newman !<BR>What in the world are they waiting for ???!!!. Deliver the Seinfeld whole collection, damn it!!!. Its unique !! I want to see George sleeping under his working desk, want to see Kramer getting his ass kicked because he was not \\"wearrring the rrribbon\\". I want to see Jerry trying to get a discount for a Saab thanks to Elaines boyfriend or explaining to an employee that the main part of a reservation is the \\"holding\\" of it. <BR>All episodes are created from simple things of life and turned them into something hilarious.
B000009EUM|5.0|From the first eerie notes of &quot;Scoundrel Days&quot; I knew that this was going to be vastly different than their first album. What is this? All these songs are dwelling on murder, on fear? What else is this? They are making use of a real drummer! Kudos for that! The songs are like no other the band has made. I'm not sure what led the band into the outer rim of hell, but they certainly came back with a macabre, dark treat. Each song has some underlying darkness (if it isn't obvious), yet they pull it off without making you want to off yourself in the end. From start to finish this is a great great record. High points: I'VE BEEN LOSING YOU, OCTOBER, THE WEIGHT OF THE WIND, THE SWING OF THINGS.
B00006RU5B|5.0|I stared out a rage against the machine fan, I didn't even know one Soundgarden song, but one day I heard cochise on the radio, and it blew me away. I then got the cd the day before it came out.  I play the guitar, and this is only one of of two cds that are great enough for me to learn every song, the other being Human Clay by Creed, which is the best album ever. Now I love Audioslave, I saw them twice, and they are the best live act right now. If you like even one Rage Against the Machine song, or one Soundgarden song, or even if you like music, you have to buy this, I guarantee you will love this cd, the range from Chris Cornell is better then ever, Tom Morrello took his guitar playing to new levels, and there are songs that you wouldn't belive that it's the same guys from Rage Against the Machine and the singer from Soundgarden
B000002L7Y|3.0|Don't the opening beats of \\"Take On Me\\" get you every time? I know it did me. This album is quite listenable from start to finish with nary a lagging moment. The way it seems, \\"Take On Me\\" is a pop disguise to something far more literate. What we have here isn't just your stupid kiddie pop of modern day. These songs were well crafted (by the group) and well executed (by the group). The low point however is a bit of the over-riding poppiness which I suppose is a matter of taste. High points: TAKE ON ME (of course), HUNTING HIGH & LOW, THE BLUE SKY and HERE I STAND AND FACE THE RAIN.
B000000H57|4.0|Incredible music/lyrics for most of the LP but, unfortunately, a fair amount of filler included will keep your hand near the fast-forward button.  When TON hits home on October Rust, they hit deep.  Wolf Moon and Haunted are my favorites.
0800141660|3.0|Sense & Sensibility is my favorite Jane Austen novel and this film version was very well done, but it is also very abridged.  Obviously the story had to be edited to fit into a two hour movie, but several important plot points seem to be omitted. If someone hasn't read the book certain parts of the story seem vague, such as the relationship between Edward and Lucy.  The performances by the cast, especially Winslet and Rickman were top notch.  In my opinion this has been Kate Winslet's best performance yet and she should have won the oscar.  I usually like Emma Thompson, but to put it blunt, she was about twenty years too old to play Elinor. All in all this was a enjoyable film, the production quality and the performance by Kate Winslet is reason enough to watch this movie.
B00008MZ0N|4.0|The movie is still the same. Nothing was changed. The movie is pretty good, but I've seen it a million times. The new bonus features are awesome, though. This tricked out edition has a prelude for 2 Fast 2 Furious, deleted scenes, behind the scenes of 2 Fast 2 Furious, trailers, and a feature called Trciking Out A Car. It shows you how to do tricks and how to drive fast. That one is my favorite feature from this DVD. The rest are good, too.
0316666343|3.0|This book was quite interesting at the beginning and mostly throughout the book, but the end lacked a strong resolution for the main character's family.  Overall, a very good book.
B00008IHN1|4.0|This DVD is better than I expected. I saw this movie in the theater, and I liked it. But I brought the DVD for the bonus features. Nick Cannon plays the starring role as Devon Miles. His incredible talent of playing drums gets him a scholarship to the marching band at A&T University in Atlanta. He is easily the best drummer in the university, even better than the captain of the marching band, Sean, who then becomes jealous of his talent. Devon's ego about being the best causes problems between him, Sean, and their coach, Dr. Lee. Eventually, Dr. Lee goes back and forth about firing Devon and letting him back on the team. As the movie goes on, Devon learns that it takes more than talent to be the best. This is my favorite musical of all time. Besides the wicked drumming Nick Cannon does, the DVD is good. <BR>The DVD has a director's commentary, the making of the movie, 2 music videos (I Want A Girl Like You by Joe & Jadakiss and Blowin Me Up by JC Chasez from N Sync.), and 10 deleted scenes you won't wanna miss. This movie has comedy, drama, and lots of music. I didn't give this a 5 because some scenes are boring.
0440213525|4.0|The Client is my second reading from John Grisham, and I was a bit disappointed. However, after the incredible novel \\"The Firm,\\" any reading by this spectacular author seems second-class. The client was, however, a great read. It was, like the Firm, an incredibly hard book to put down. The main character, Mark, has witnessed a suicide, and prior to the killing, the victim told Mark something that he should not have told any sole. Even though Mark has a loving, caring mother, the reader cannot help but notice a mother-son relationship develop between Mark Sway, and Reggie Love. Reggie is one of those characters who you love to read about, and who give you the hope that there are truly some people out there in our crazy greedy world, who do not care about money, and just want to help people. Another main character, Roy Foltrigg, is someone you \\"love to hate.\\" It is with these vivid and realistic characters that make this book, and probably any other book by John Grisham great. Read it, and you will not be disappointed.

B0000584V3|5.0|Due to Opeth's emphasis on melody, many people want to call them black metal, when in reality Opeth is a death metal band that adds a very progressive influence.  Mikael Akerfeldt, the band's guitarist, vocalist and songwriter, shows off his almost inhuman abilities to write music and vocalize in a way that none other can.  The instruments cause a sort of brutal yet dark atmosphere, which sets the tone for Akerfeldt to choose what vocal style he uses-- ranging from a death growl as gutteral as the best to a clear singing that at times almost brings a tear to the eye.  The band ranges from all-out death, in songs like \\"The Leper Affinity,\\" to all acoustic in \\"Harvest,\\" then round it out a bit with the atmospheric \\"Patters In the Ivy\\" which sets a somber mood through the use of a piano.  The hardest part to get used to with Opeth is their song length-- \\"Patterns In the Ivy\\" is less than 2 minutes, but \\"Harvest\\" is over 5, and the rest never drop below 8, with some ranging as long as 12-13!  But if you're looking for powerful metal that pushes the limits of musical boundaries, Opeth is the band to try.
B0000A1RJI|4.0|ok, did any one else notice that in the credits there was 2 songs. and they managed to put the second one on the soundtrack. but not the actual pirate song? dont get me wrong, the soundtrack is brilliant. but i wanted that song on there

B000001GRE|5.0|Boulez is in my opinion one of the best Mahler conductors.<br />Many conducters lose themself in over-interpret the score at the cost of some natural musical flow.<br />Boulez (almost) always picks the right tempi.<br />Yes his first movement is slower than many other, but he builds this movement more logical and natural than say Solti or Inbal, without losing its tension.<br />I like the tempo choices very much: less contrasts in this movement than usual means a bigger tension throughout.<br />Emphasizing these contrast wears the listener out or the conductor himself.<br /><br />Solti sounds spectacular at first, but the playing in the first movement is definitely tiresome, sometimes at the level of sheer noise - the direct recording is blamed but also Solti's conducting wich emphasizes brilliance too much.<br />I like Boulez' introvert approach much better.<br /><br />The first nachtmusik is quick and light, just like it should be played (to my taste). The same with the second, why do most conducters play these pieces as if they are grand enigmas???, giving too much drama to the score, as if Mahler was unlucky and troubling all the time.<br /><br />The scherzo is beautifully delicate and intense played.<br />Solti, however impresses me more in this piece, his reading is more \\"schattenhaft\\", played with more attack, the spooky elements are somewhat better accentuated.<br />With Boulez these are a tiny bit underplayed, but musically you can't fault Boulez and the delicate approach fits his introvert view of this piece better.<br /><br />Listening to Boulez is always listening to music only, not listening to the conductors decisions.<br />His phrasing is so natural and the music has its drama, spirit and warmth itself; it doesn't need an extra boost.<br /><br />The finale is perhaps the most difficult piece of Mahler to listen at.<br />Not with Boulez, his approach is again natural and therefore I finally understand this piece better.<br /><br />Complex music becomes easy listening in Boulez' hands and this doesn't mean the music sounds cold, on the contrary: I never heard the first movement played so lyrical<br />Just \\"playing the notes\\" seems more melodic than struggling with them.<br /><br />This record is a must have next to Boulez' other great recordings of Mahler, Bartok, Ravel and Debussy (perhaps only his Bruckner 8 misses some spirit)n the contrary: I never heard the first movement played so lyrical  Just \\"playing the notes\\" seems more melodic than struggling with them.

B00008J4P5|1.0|The White Stripes are an admirable rock band, but painfully overrated. &quot;Seven Nation Army&quot; is a very good song, but the rest of the disc is the same repetative lo-fi noodling. This is far from groundbreaking. You can grab any garage rock album from as far back as 1968 and find the same thing.<br />If the music scene wasn't so vapid and lacking of good bands, The White Stripes wouldn't get a second glance. Think about how much attention they would get during the early 90's grunge movement. <br />A band needs to blend its influences into something new and unique, not rehash what others have done before it. AFI is a great example of a band that has melded influences of punk, goth and even metal into a new cohesive vision. I heavily recommend their new CD, &quot;Sing the Sorrow&quot; in place of &quot;Elephant&quot;
0385512104|5.0|A brilliant and touching novel about a 15 year old boy who is unjustly accused of killing a neighbor's dog. The child, Christopher Boone, is autistic. He is supremely logical but unable to understand simple human emotion, and, against the advise of his parents and neighbors, goes about trying to solve the crime in his own way. <br />The book, which is written from Christopher's point of view, will have you laughing out loud one minute and will have you wiping your tears the next; you will see parents who want to hug their child, but cannot, because he can't bear to be touched; and you will see parents struggling to do what is right for their child and the immense toll it takes on their lives. You may love the characters and you may hate them, but you will not be able to put the book down. It is full of wonderful details and facts that have nothing to do with the story, but make the book that much more fun to read.<br />Let's leave Harry Potter for the kids. I want a sequel to this book. I want to know what happens on Christopher Boone's next adventure. I want to know what happens on his first date. And I want to know what happens when he goes on to college. Mark Haddon, are you listening?

I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a great movie.
B0000669JL|5.0|I must say, I've prided myself on being only 22 and having an appreciation for music of my parent's generation.

B000000YG5|4.0|I bought this CD a few months ago and though I liked it immediately, it took some time for it to take its place among my favorites.<br />It's there now, though I can't say what was responsible for the delay. I was not too familiar with Sonny Rollins' work before this, and perhaps it seemed a bit predictable when compared to the fierce music of someone like John Coltrane, which I loved immediately. But eventually the roundness of the sax and the overall quality of the sound won me over.<br />I have also noticed that this is one of my jazz CDs that even my non-jazz-loving friends seem to appreciate, something tells me that it would make a great introduction to either the genre or the artist.<br />Once you get your copy, pay special attention to Blue 7 (track 5), which I think is the best on the CD. Also, if the wonderful track 4, Moritat, seems familiar, you may have heard a very similar version of the song done in the past with the name Mac the Knife.

0684800713|4.0|I would put this book with Catcher in the Rye for books for the disenfranchised.  The characters in this book talks about a &quot;lost generation&quot; that felt a sinking in their souls after the First World War at that time referred to as the Great War.  I would argue that there is a lost generation in every generation which comprises a subset a people that feel no need to mature and live life as a vagabond.  This book brings those types of characters in the foreground with good characters.  It includes a character with low self esteem with a weakness to be loved by a woman who gives just a little attention to him, a character that acts like a jerk whenever he has the excuse to be one, a character that can't make up her mind on who to be with at that moment and a thoughtful character that puts all of this into perspective as the first person narrator.  The book is a nice one for singles to read as it give similar types of interactions.<br />It was hard trying to identify how Paris might have been like or Pamplona because there was some but not much description of the scenery of the two cities.  I mainly wanted to know the sights and sounds of the running of the bulls but the running of the bulls was mainly a background to the main plot of the story.  But I wasn't really disappointed with that as much as the ending.<br />What I got from Hemingway's style was that his stories are best when appreciated in the moment.  You shouldn't try to find a logical progression from chapter to chapter about plot and where you should see the characters going.  The beauty of his writings dives into the psyche of his characters and gets involved in how personal flaws can lead to bad situations and bad outcomes.  It doesn't try to answer how to live or how to fix them but merely seeks sympathy for them.

B00005JLSE|4.0|The movie musical was a popular form of entertainment, as well as a dependable source of income for studios, from the advent of sound in the 1920s until the late 1960s. The genre's zenith, at least in terms of financial results, was achieved in 1965 with the release of the wildly successful \\"The Sound of Music\\". Afterwards, there were a few big hits, [notably \\"Oliver\\" and \\"Grease\\"], but changing times and audience tastes forced movie musicals into virtual extinction by the late 1970s. <br />The genre returned with a bang in 2001 with the release of \\"Moulin Rouge\\". This was not your mother's musical. The pace was frantic, and the style was closer to MTV videos than to \\"Singin' in the Rain\\". Here was a movie for the 21st Century - frenzied, yet still stylish and vastly entertaining. Now comes \\"Chicago\\", which, though more traditional than \\"Moulin Rouge\\", is a fresh, inventive movie that is quite in keeping with today's tastes in entertainment. <br />The movie is based on the hit Broadway musical, which itself was based on an old play about flappers, showgirls, murder and music in late 1920s Chicago. Roxie Hart [Renee Zellweger] and Velma Kelly [Catherine Zeta-Jones] are arrested for different murders and sent to Cook County Jail. Both are defended by suave, cynical Billy Flynn [Richard Gere], who sees them less as clients than as great publicity tools for his burgeoning legal career. Velma has a singing and dancing career. Roxie dreams of one. The movie cleverly uses Roxie's dreams and fantasies to introduce some great musical numbers, some of which are real showstoppers. <br />One of the best things about \\"Chicago\\" is that none of the performances are faked. Everyone does his or her own singing and dancing. That's no surprise when it comes to the marvelous Queen Latifah, who plays the conniving Matron `Mama' Morton, or to Zeta-Jones whose career began on the musical stage. But who knew that Gere is a great singer and can even tap dance up a storm? Or that Zellweger is even more talented than we already thought? Or that the amazing John C. Reilly, who plays Velma's naive husband, sings beautifully? <br />`Chicago' is a real treat. Whether the movie musical is experiencing a true revival remains to be seen. I, for one, hope that it is.
B0000026KQ|5.0|&quot;As far as rock guitarists go he's got to be my all-time hero,&quot; says Pink Floyd's keyboardist, Richard Wright, in Record Collector magazine, when he named this album as one of his favorites.  &quot;He started as a blues guitarist just like Clapton, but he's investigated the possibilities of the instrument much more.  You probably won't know this, but when Syd left Pink Floyd we actually asked Jeff Beck to join, he was our first choice. He was doing OK at the time so he turned us down.&quot;  Given that Mr. Wright is in a band with a guitar great like David Gilmour, this certainly constitutes a ringing endorsement.  Indeed, Jeff Beck is the only guitarist capable of putting a chill down my spine like Mr. Gilmour can.  I first heard him play on Roger Waters' solo work Amused to Death and was deeply moved.  This album comes from around the same time period, so if you like that style and want more, this is a great place to start.<br />&quot;There's one track on Guitar Shop called Where Were You? that's just this beautiful, melodic guitar sequence. I loved it so much that I took that feel for an instrumental called Sweet July on my new solo album [Broken China--1996].&quot;  How correct Mr. Wright is!  This is most definitely the highlight of the album.  Mr. Beck seems to sing and cry through his guitar as naturally as if it were his own voice, and how well he pulls at the listener's heartstrings!  If you like Pink Floyd's song &quot;Marooned&quot;, you should have excellent luck with this track, which I consider to be worth the price of the entire CD.<br />The rest of the album also amazes me, thanks to how little Mr. Beck uses to create his tone.  Rather than relying on heavily in effects the way David Gilmour does, Jeff Beck's strength is pure technique and creativity.  Who would think the sound of a guitar (seeming to be) having its strings put on and tuned up could be turned into something innovating and entertaining?  Yet this is part of what happens on the title track.  I will say that although heavier in parts, listeners should not expect an extremely serious album--there is some definite and quirky humor in places.  &quot;Guitar Shop&quot; most certainly, but so is the track with the repeated line &quot;Nothing--nothing is being done!&quot;<br />Yes, the sound can be rather 80s in places--but Jeff Beck's guitar work is quite simply too mindblowing, too heartwrenching, to turn down.  Guitar Shop is certainly a must-have!
0553208845|4.0|that happened to be the comment that a woman friend of mine made when she saw me with the book, as in 'god, what's with you men? all men seem to relate to and own this book!' and that really got my attention, so when i read it again (about 5-times by now) i felt that hesse had in reality given short shrift to kamala the female lead. hesse has used kamala to epitomize the eastern woman (she's a courtesan!) and has somehow left her completely shallow. if he were around and given the modern predilection for sequels, prequels et al, i'm sure there was enough in kamala to merit an even longer book.<br />i've subsequently bought narcissus &amp; goldmund and that too is about men. and even in the early part of the book, the women seem to lack depth. will be more informed when i finish.<br />nevertheless, siddhartha does make very involved reading with many layers of personal meaning. it has charm as an eastern novel and also depth if you're introspective. enjoy.
B00006CXXU|3.0|I bought this album thinking it would be somewhat like Christina's first. I was very wrong! I must say that her vocals have definately improved since she recorded and album. Although her voice now has a different effect on the songs she sings, the songs themselves are a little on the boring side. I got this cd and listened to it when it came and I thought \\"This cd is ok.. it could probably be better.\\" I think it is a little boring but she did do a great job, which is why I give Christina Aguilera an average star rating on her album. I do, however, hope that she will continue to sing and create more inventive albums along the way. =)
B0000A1RJI|4.0|The music for &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; is strikingly bold and energetic, and leaped from the speakers in the theater. This soundtrack CD presents a brief and brash synopsis of the overall score. The music is perfectly matched to the film -- alternately fun, rollicking, corny, sweeping, creepy, and heroic. It has been in my car's 6-CD changer since the day I got it, is played often, and probably won't be rotated out for a while.
B000002UDB|3.0|I really enjoy this cd. I think it's underrated, and there are some great songs in it:Hello Goodbye, Magical Mystery Tour, Your Mother Should Know, Penny Lane...and then there's All You Need is Love. All You Need is Love has a lot going for it: nice instrumentation going in, beautiful harmonies, a great message. But then the elephant strikes. During the chorus every time after they say &quot;All you need is love,&quot; there's some circus-inspired tuba elephant noise, that does nothing but detract from the song. It breaks the soothing quality of the singing with a jarring elephant noise that gets progressively more irritating as the song goes on. It really bothers me.

1577311523|5.0|I said that Eckhart essentially describes two levels of experiencing reality available for humans (please see my previous comments in this website for clarification}:<br />Higher level: Stillness.<br />This level can also be reached through mindfulness.  In fact, mindfulness is the Buddha's way to reach the higher level.  In short, mindfulness consist in focusing your complete attention in wherever is in front of you in the present moment (like washing dishes, or tasting a meal).<br />Alan Watts also mentions these two levels when he stated that the human problem is to get from the abstract level (lower level)to the concrete level (higher level).<br />Zen tells you that there are two ways of knowing reality: one through concepts (lower level) and one through direct contacting reality with your whole being (higher level).<br />Ken Wilber talks about \\"rational\\" (lower level) and \\"transrational\\" (higher level).<br />Peace is reached with stillnes (no thinking), as Eckhart states.  However, there is much more than peace in this level.  To start, you contact God at this level.  Not just a theoric contact in your mind but a concrete experiencial contact.  This level has not limit. Spiritual traditions describe the higher level with many sub-levels in a somewhat ladder fashion.  In this level you climb the sub-levels with God in your side and inside you, reaching to infinity. <br />Lower level: Thinking<br />This level was explained in my previous comment.<br />Note: Eckhart states that there is not much you need to know to enter the higher level. You do not have to read hundred of books (sorry Amazon).  Eckhart is right.  You can spend your whole life looking for the conceptual explanation that would get you to the higher level.  This is an illusion.  Concepts would not get you there.  Becoming present in this moment is the starting point.
B0000AXE8I|3.0|In Matrix Reloaded the FX were better than ever, characters were still cool (usually), and we were treated to some new and interesting characters. But where were all the pithy comments from Morpheus, as in the first movie? All we get is (in response to \\"But you told us going on the freeway is suicide\\") \\"Let us hope I was wrong.\\"<BR>The main characters don't even have time to slow down and make their jazzy idiosyncracies, like the way Morpheus snaps his mirror pince-nez on his nose with one hand. Instead we get a Spielberg- or Lucas-style mishmosh of never-ending action and change of scene... except, of course, for the embarrassing, lame alternating love scene/dirty dance scenein Zion...  That scene could have been half as long and still be too long.<br />Then, how about \\"I just love you too damn much!\\" Did the first Matrix movie have ANY stupid, useless lines? Just heal the girl already and be done with it.<br />And then there's the Superman routine, dumb to begin with and made worse by constantly shifting back to a couple people on the ship, watching and making comments. Dumb and dumber.<br />The architect came across as a crabby old know-it-all with prostate trouble. He was supposed to be an impatient, dictatorial figure (I guess) but instead came across as Jay Leno's Mr. Brain character in his Geritol years.<br />How about the whole sequence visiting the Merovingian? No rhythm there, no structure, but there certainly was plenty of cheap sexual innuendo. Not the type of material that brought me to love the first Matrix film.<br />The highway scene is fantastic -- really raised the bar on chase scenes and action scenes. The multiple Agents Smith started out interesting -- then got old. And why is it, in the building where the Architect sits, every time a door opens there's another agent behind it? Corny! I've seen Lost in Space episodes with deeper content!<br />So, was the best thing in this movie Carrie-Ann's vinyl-clad caboose? It certainly wasn't the story or the lines.
B000002GHH|5.0|Hiatt produced his best album under less than ideal circumstances. I saw him perform much of this at McCabe's solo acoustic and was blown out by the songs and performances. While it took him awhile to discover his true voice and sound as a performer, it was better late in this case. Thing Called Love became the big hit for Bonnie Raitt but it's just the tip of the iceberg on this great album.<br /><br />I recently heard a fairly mundane remake of Have A Little Faith In Me (it recalled Hiatt's remake for Glenn Ballard in terms of the arrangement)by a teen singer. Nothing can touch the power and emotional honesty of the original. This is a song that needs to be performed simply.<br /><br />The band and production are top notch as well. Working with the amazing Ry Cooder, Nick Lowe on bass and legendary Jim Keltner on drums, Bring the Family had a bluesy, roots rock sound missing from much of Hiatt's overproduced material during the 70's and early 80's. The style here recalls his first album more than any other but it's, well, about as naked as can be.<br /><br />Now if we could only get John to add a bit more cajun flavor to his sound....
B000059HGY|4.0|Tora!  Tora!  Tora!  is a highly historical film that made an attempt to cover the entire ground of what happened on December 7th, 1941.  And I think they succeeded in doing this, giving us an education on how Pearl Harbor came about, why the Japanese bombed us, and what went wrong. I was very pleased with how this film was molded and crafted and how real the movie was.  <br />Reading from other people's reviews, I have found that some complaints are about the length of the movie and that it is boring.  Well it is boring if history being converted to film bothers you.  But if you like to get down to the skinny of things and kinda find out why things happen, why 12/7/41 occured then this film is fascinating not boring.<br />Another complaint is how the Japanese are shown as smart and wise and the Americans as stupid or slow.  Well, to be honest, history says that is a correct analysis of the way things were.  Our command at Pearl Harbor was inept, they did stupid things, they made poor decisions, the White House made serious flaws that made way for the attack to become imminent.  And the Japanese were very determined, very ingenius on their planning of this attack.  They had a lot of time to think about this raid, so naturally when one is well organized that person is going to be portrayed as smart.  The Japanese out smarted us on that day, or as the film shows, that year of '41.<br />I liked how this film led up to the attack on Pearl Harbor, beginning several months prior to the raid.  This gave us an idea what was going on in both sides' minds.  It gave equal time to the Japanese strategists and to American high command and intelligence.  If anybody has a problem with a war film giving each side an equal balance in a film, as far as point of view, then don't watch this film.<br />My only concern for this film, that costed it one star, is that you never get to know any of the characters.  They are kind of distant characters, obviously just imitating historical people long gone, but even then I think the viewers would like to get to know the characters.  Because there were so many characters, and the point of views switches so often, I can see where this is a problem.  But it's the sacrifice you give when you have lots of characters you want to give equal perspectives to.  Still, one character you could really get to know in this film is something I still expected.  <br />As a result to no real deep character you can follow in this film, this movie is nothing more but a historical documentary with movie drama and sequences.  And this is OK, it's a good 4 star war movie.  But it isn't the most entertaining either.  I do recommend this movie, but please don't watch it with the expectation of being entertained with action.  Watch it because you want to know more about what happened before and during December 7th, 1941.<br />Grade: B-
B00005JKNC|5.0|This is truly one of the best movies ever made if you like thinking/changing/thought provoking movies. It reminds me of a wonderful dream that lands in reality and teaches us all by its innocence and beauty. If you liked \\"Groundhogs Day,\\" you will love this. <BR>It starts slow and builds and changes telling a story about people and ideas. It weaves through small town life and large government politics. This is a movie that you should sit back and let come to you. You are lucky if you have not seen it yet.
B00003CXD5|3.0|This movie is good, but surely not a classic its made out to be.<br />The transformation of Humphrey Bogart from a decent, hard-working<BR>guy in to a greedy, blood-thirsty man who wouldnt think twice about betraying his close friends is too abrupt.Its like you missed an important section of the film, I watched it again to make sure I didnt.<br />A fair amount of the film is in Spanish with no sub-titles.<br />Good for one watch , might get boring after that.
B000065U1N|3.0|If you're looking for just action, this is a decent enough film, but if you're looking to learn anything about why US troops were in Mogadishu as part of a UN operation and the factors that led to this battle, you need to look elsewhere.<br />The opening minutes of the film only begin to touch on the situation the US Rangers are facing in Mogadishu by showing Mohammed Farah Aidid's men taking food from the local population while a US helicopter watches powerlessly.  After a few minutes of obligitory character setup which seems to exist just so you know the pecking order of the characters, the film rapidly moves on to setting up the mission and getting to the action. <br />From this point it's typical Hollywood fare, using the special effects first seen in Saving Private Ryan to wow the audience with visual effects.  While it certainly includes the salient issues of the story and does a wonderful job depicting them in the high standards of Hollywood special effects, it doesn't touch on any of the issues surrounding this battle. <br />Who is Aidid?  Why is the UN there?  Why is the US there?  The Army's Ranger units are elite units unto themselves, yet this film makes them look like nervous adolescents who forgot their training and don't know what to do and are saved only by the presence of Delta force members. <br />While the movie is a great action film and does a good job depicting the events of this particular engagement, it's placed in a void that most viewers probably can't fill in themselves. If you just want a film to sit and watch some action while eating popcorn, this is a good film.  But if you want to understand anything about the situation these men were in, you'll need to look elsewhere. I'd suggest A&amp;E's excellent documentary entitled The True Story Of Black Hawk Down. Through the stories of the men who actually fought in the battle you get a much better idea of the situation and it actually makes a better story with more tension than this film.
6305508550|4.0|This is one crazy movie I thought the guy in the movie with the thick glasses and the monotone whiny voice was the funniest. (he is on the cover of the dvd). The rest of the actors were decent. See this movie has to do with work and hating your job in which i can really relate to. The guy in the movie though is hypnotize and just up and tries to get fired no longer having any care or stress about what happens to him. ( I so feel that). Its funny as he just ignores his boss and does what he wants whenever he decides to go to work.!!!!!!  The dude on the cover i'm tellin you makes the movie watch it you will trip everytime you see him.
B00005JKZV|5.0|Simply put, \\"The Two Towers\\" lives up to the standards the filmmakers set for themselves in the first film. It is remarkably faithful to the books, and it is an excellent film in any estimation.<br />The style established in the first film is maintained rigorously in the second. Colors, sounds, dialogue, effects, acting... all excellent, all used well. I cannot think of a single element with which I was disappointed, but there were a few things which stood out as particularly impressive.<br />The achievement and realization of Gollum as a character was better than I think anyone expected. Very quickly, I forgot while watching the film that he is essentially a virtual character, and what we see on the screen was created by digital artists (along with the incomparable Andy Serkis). Far from suffering from Jar-Jar Binks syndrome, Gollum becomes as real a character as any of the actors on-screen, with depth and feeling and even sympathy. I didn't expect to be given a Gollum I could believe in, but Jackson and his team surprised me here.<br />Even apart from Gollum, the effects of this second film were even better than the first. I can see that, as good as they were when they started the project, the artists working on Lord of the Rings have already begun to improve their talents, and it shows in the work. The massive battle sequence at Helm's Deep is only one example of the fine work they are doing now.<br />Howard Shore's music for the film has once again enchanted me thoroughly.  Shore is a talented composer for just about any film, but for Lord of the Rings he has clearly pulled out all the stops and created something completely new for him, but utterly perfect for the films. His epic, sweeping, emotional score is ideal for capturing the essence of the story. It's gotten to the point that listening to even a small portion of the music invokes memories of the films for me.<br />The actors chosen for Lord of the Rings could not be better, and in this movie they prove it even moreso than in the first. Driven to extremes of desperation and hopelessness, and still coming out the other side intact, they show their basic humanity and maintain a sense of who they are. Whether siding with good or evil, all the characters are essentially believeable, and that is a rare achievement.<br />The changes that were made for the film version of \\"The Two Towers\\" take a little getting used to for someone who has read the books, but they don't really detract from the story at all. Many of them actually seem to make the story more accessible, and to establish some plot point a little earlier or a little more clearly.<br />In many ways, \\"Fellowship\\" was an easier film to watch. \\"The Two Towers\\" seems somewhat depressing and dark in comparison, as well it should. This second film is a story about finding hope in the face of hopelessness. As each part of the story progresses, the characters progress deeper into the darkness that is engulfing the world. Sam expresses this explicitly near the end of the film, when he says that it gets to the point where you don't want to know what happens next anymore, because it seems that it can't possibly turn out well. These are people presented with insurmountable odds, but what makes it so compelling to watch is that they try anyway -- \\"because there's some good left in this world... and it's worth fighting for.\\"<br />A few words about the DVD: it's a good-looking presentation, and the extras are fun and all worth watching. Sean Astin's short film, \\"The Long and Short of It,\\" is presented on the second disc, as is a 10-minute behind-the-scenes preview of the third film and a sampling of scenes that will be seen in the Extended Edition of \\"The Two Towers.\\" Just as on \\"Fellowship,\\" the extras on \\"The Two Towers\\" are almost long enough to be a film in themselves, and they are all well-produced and worth watching.<br />All in all, a very well-done film. Peter Jackson's film version of The Lord of the Rings is (so far)the best fantasy epic ever committed to film. Perhaps the only drawback to watching \\"The Two Towers\\" now is that it makes me even more anxious to see \\"The Return of the King.\\"the best fantasy epic ever committed to film.

B00005JKHP|5.0|To me this one is the best Star Trek feature of all time. I still am hoping that someone will have a vision as powerful as Robert Wise and to do even better.<br />I remember when I first saw it on TV, I was about 8 y.o. and I already was a great fan of the series, it was my favorite movie and I didn't even understand what it was about. But the visual poetry was enough to fill my mind with wonder.<br />Now that I am over 30 I realize, watching it over and over again, that what Mr. Wise brought to Star Trek is a lot more than just an underated piece of Sci-Fi, but a vision of the magnitude of what the world could be in the future. Not just a couple of astronauts trying to free themselves from the grip of Apollo, but the feeling of actually being there, sizes of stellar objects, distances + reaching the boundaries of human imagination. Something that has been lost in the last 3 films (First Contact, Insurrection and Nemesis).<br />I think that Star Trek the Motion Picture is the most significant contribution to the Star Trek Universe.
0792833201|4.0|It may be hard to believe, but I still get a chill watching this movie after twenty years. I hope eventually the studio will release a director's cut, or at least a special edition DVD with deleted scenes, documentaries, etcetera. The remastered Dolby 5.1 sound is excellent, but the aging and non-remasterd picture could use some help. Poltergeist incited the Motion Picture Association of America to create a new PG-13 rating.

B000002J09|5.0|It makes me sad at times reading reviews for albums of some of my favourite bands ever, some people just don't get it.<BR>first of all led zeppelin are one of the greatest bands of all time and second this album although in my humble opinion not there best is a masterpiece. Of course the focus of this album is always centered on stairway, it is a great song a remarkable piece of work but people should look at the album as a collective of songs that are of the same calibre.<BR>It made me so angry when i read a review saying put john bonham next to a drum machine and you won't be able to tell the difference, because if they thought that they obviously are tone deaf due to the fact that the rhythm of the drums on black dog are so complex and compliment the skill of jimmy pages guitar work.<BR>Rock and roll is a good raver with some roaring guitar work from jimmy.<BR>The battle of evermore is an epic take on another of my favourite things besides listening to rock music and playing my guitar, this track creates an image of middle earth and the epic struggle written in the lord of the rings.<BR>stairway to heaven is great as we all know so i'm just gonna give a musicians insight into the recording of the song. The solo was recorded on a fender telecaster the same which jimmy used on the first album and once belonged to jeff beck.<BR>misty mountain hop is another song inspired by tolkien and has some great guitar work.<BR>four sticks is a favourite track of mine.<BR>going to california is a great acoustic number very mellow jimmy really shines on this track merging with robert plants lyrics to create a great piece of music<BR>when the levee breaks is amazing, it is an old blues song but zep has turned it into something epic john bonham is amazing on this track and the interplay between him and jimmy on guitar is what makes this track so good.<BR>All in all this album is amazing and the guitar-work is immense anyone who wants to listen to good classic rock should by this album.<BR>P.s That review entitled jimmy jim jimmy or something of that nature is so wrong don't read it because they dare to mention a band as bad as slipknot who display no musical skills at all in the same sentence as  led zeppelin plus they say slipknot is a better band altogether THIS IS NOT TRUE AT ALL
0385486804|5.0|The person who gave me this book said they couldn't put it down, but I found myself having to put it down every few chapters because sections of it were so emotionally intense.<br />McCandless, the young man whose story Krakauer pieces together, is both admirable and exasperating. On the one hand, he embodies a great many American values: idealism, a willingness to take risks, a wish for personal development and spiritual fulfillment, a love of nature and the outdoors, a romantic attachment to the open road, an egalitarian openness to the common man, a respect for hard physical labor, honesty, trust, loyalty, commitment to one's own vision. All of these attributes are wrapped up in a precocious, thoughtful, bright young man who charmed the strangers he met on the road, made them care about his welfare, and was even deeply loved. He is in many ways a modern-day Thoreau, a hero in the style of Joseph Campbell, following his bliss.<br />On the other hand, McCandless is willful, heedless, self-indulgent, reluctant to become emotionally attached to other people, vindictive toward his parents, and unaware of the pain that his potential death could have on those who love him. In short, he is a fascinating psychological mystery, full of contradictions he seems unaware of. Many readers will dismiss him as a weirdo and the book as a waste of time, but I believe the best way to approach the book is to suspend judgement and simply read it as a character study of an amazingly complex human being. Ironically, like many a young man, McCandless puts his life on the line for the sake of adventure and one day may have written his own best-selling book about it if he'd only had the good luck to survive.<br />Krakauer tells a wonderful story. The many people he interviews breathe with life and feeling, and the places he travels to are vividly described. Looking at his subject from many angles, he includes cameo biographies of other men who have met untimely ends in the wilderness, including Everett Ruess, another young man very similar to McCandless, who disappeared in the canyon country along the Colorado River in Utah in 1934. And he uses himself as an example, describing a youthful attempt to scale a forbidding Alaskan mountain in the dead of winter and capturing the nearly mindless devotion to an impossibly risky objective.<br />If deliberately risking your life in a long-shot gamble at self-realization is your idea of something totally stupid, then you probably should stay away from this book. But I recommend it as a mesmerizing, haunting psychological study of an adolescent rite of passage. I also recommend it to anyone who is fascinated by wilderness and living off the land under conditions that are hazardous, forbidding and transportingly beautiful.luding Everett Ruess, another young man very similar to McCandless, who disappeared in the canyon country along the Colorado River in Utah in 1934.

B00005JLEU|5.0|Hayao Mayazaki's stunning work takes the boundaries of traditional cel animation and stretches it to a point no Western animated movie has in quite some time now. The film owes a lot to Lewis Carroll as much as it does Osama Tezuka. Chihiro is a reserved apprehensive girl who is transported to a world of large fuzzy gods and old Japan-style theme-parks turned marketplaces and bathhouses. Transformation is a large theme in the film: river gods transformed by human pollution; humans transformed into pigs; Chihiro transformed by her domineering employer into 'Sen'.<br />Like Mayazaki's eco-fable 'Princess Mononoke', this film's Romanticism allows for morals to play through in very clever ways. Characters are more complex than first glance and each has a redeeming side no matter how grotesque. The imagery is stunning at times. Rich Mannerist color schemes with elaborate set designs unfold for the nearly flawless animation to take place in. <br />Having said that, the only flaw in this DVD package is the credit Disney tries to take for some of it in the Bonus Footage. As usual, the Mouse talks down to their audience in their sophmoric and superfluous explainations. English-Version Producer John Lassater comes off like a big dope that (thankfully) Mayazaki can see through. Who cares about Kirk Wise or any of the other Disney directors that had almost nothing to do with the film itself? Skip instead to the Nippon Television documentary that takes you through Studio Ghibli and the final tense months of production. This segment where the animators and staff work round the clock offers a candid view of the animation film process. The film itself transcends its Western distributor and shines as something very distinct and touching.

0385504209|3.0|After finishing &quot;The Da Vinci Code,&quot; my wife asked me to read it in order to get my &quot;professional&quot; opinion.  I guess she wanted to feel like she was getting something for all those years she helped put me through graduate school.  So, I was already reading it with one eye on historical detail, even through I realize it's a novel, it's just a story.  Just because Indiana Jones isn't really archaeology, or Men In Black isn't really science doesn't mean you can't have a ripping good yarn.  So, although it's &quot;facts&quot; are an incoherent mishmash of tabloid conspiracy theory, half baked higher criticism, and new age mush, it's still a passable airplane read.<br />  When I had finished it, however, that's not what she asked first.  She wanted to know, did I like it?  And that was a more complicated question.  On the one hand, a tale of a middle aged humanities teacher who suddenly finds that his studies actually have some real-world relevance and is off to high adventure with an attractive young French woman . . . . I mean, what's not to like (says the middle aged humanities instructor . . . .).<br />  But throughout the book there was another element that I found a bit more disturbing.  Yes, we're used to the standard conspiracy theory;  from &quot;Three Days of the Condor,&quot; to &quot;JFK,&quot; to the &quot;X-Files,&quot; to &quot;The Bourne Identity,&quot; . . .  it's always the establishment that is the true villain.  In this particular instance the establishment is the Roman Catholic Church.  True, there is a bit of posturing that permits the author to say that it is actually a rogue element within the church that is at fault (to go any farther as to the actual villain would interject an unconscionable spoiler into a review).  But that was not the troubling part.  Rather it was the breezy, off-hand way with which the author tossed out scurrilous accusations against Christianity itself.  None of them are new or particularly insightful but, nevertheless, in the guise of his academic protagonist, we have Mr. Brown pontificating with feigned piety, that the &quot;noble teachings of the simple Galilean teacher&quot; were seized upon and bastardized by a greedy, violent, psychotic bunch of misogynists who have knowingly misled the gullible masses through all these centuries for their own evil ends.  That's pretty ugly stuff.<br />  I was reminded of a statement from Albert Schweitzer as he documented the &quot;Quest of the Historical Jesus.&quot;  &quot;Lives of Jesus&quot; had become something of a gladiatorial entertainment in the post-Enlightenment period.

B00005RHGK|3.0|Any movie that has once Oscar nominated Eileen Brennan (Private Benjamin) offering a five minute cameo as a crazy old lady with zillions of cats can't be all bad.  And it's not.  While it is short on plot, long on stupidity, and poorly lensed, JEEPERS CREEPERS is a scary little movie.  Patricia Belcher as the psychic also is so bad she is good, does that make sense?  The kids (Gina Phillips &amp; Justin Long) try hard to be brother/sister, but they do some incredibly stupid things and their looks of shock early on are definitely high school thespian at best.  However, towards the end, especially in the scenes at the police station, Phillips and Long show signs of being really capable performers.  The ending in which Gina offers herself in place of Long is a very unusual anti-formula one, and its resolution quite shocking.<br />I have to say, too, the early sequence in which the truck is harrassing the younguns is pretty effective, too.<br />Not a cinematic gem, but it is a scary one.
B000002HHB|4.0|I love a lot of this album.  There are some songs that I could do without:  'Cowboy Romance,' 'River,' 'The Letter,' 'Where I Go,' and 'Wonder.'  However, these are made up for by the brilliant works 'Seven Years,' 'I May Know the Word,' 'Carnival,' and 'Beloved Wife.'  The rest of the album is above average, but those four are my favourites.
B00005RY7X|4.0|My friend Karen introduced me to Andrew's music and I'm glad she did. She told me that fye.com had \\"I Love NYC\\" for download so I checked it out and liked it. That wasn't enough for me to buy the album, but after she let me use her's I was hooked. I went and got my own after I got paid lol. I've had I Get Wet in heavy rotation for a while now. I love music that's fast and loud. My favorite tracks are \\"It's Time To Party\\" and \\"Party Hard\\". <BR>This album is definitely worth checking out!
B00003CXSM|5.0|Jennifer Lopez and Matthew McConaughey are perfect fits for the this movie.  It's an all around feel good movie.  It makes you imagine... Matthew is very sexy as Steve Eddison and J.Lo suites the part.  Highly recommended!
B00003CXE7|5.0|this is one of those movies that when it ends you sit there and think about it and how amazingly good it was. most movies you leave the theater with your friends and forget the movie 5 minutes later because there are more important things there like girls and food. anybody who gave this movie under 4 stars was probably sidetracked when they saw it or was some history teacher that cant stand innaccurate movies. and theres always the people that are obsessed with chickens and whatnot who should be ignored anyways. this movie  just seems like its on a different level than all the movies being pumped out today for cash.
B00008EY9G|4.0|It's nearly impossible to review James Mangold's latest film, IDENTITY, without revealing the plot twist that makes this very enjoyable thriller 'work'...and since the director chose not to reveal it, himself, until the film was nearly over, I'll respect his vision, and not give it away!<br />Two story lines unfold; in one, psychiatrist Alfred Molina has a final session with convicted serial killer Pruitt Taylor Vince, before execution. Despite the defense claiming insanity, the court ruled against it, and the bitterness towards the murderer, and satisfaction the prosecution feels about justice being served are clearly evident, making Molina's task a nearly impossible one.<br />In the other, a chain of events strands a group of motorists together at a seedy motel, run by John Hawkes (who is excellent as the sleazy manager) during a storm. Composed of a hooker (Amanda Peet), who, with a lost shoe, began the chain; a nerdish husband (John C. McGinley), his wife, seriously injured after being struck by a car, and his stepson; the chauffeur (John Cusack) who struck the woman, and his passenger, a fading movie star (Rebecca DeMornay, who is nearly unrecognizable); a bickering young couple (Clea DuVall and William Lee Scott); and a marshal, transporting a killer (Ray Liotta and Jake Busey). With the roads flooded and phone lines down, the group is isolated...then, in a fashion similar to Agatha Christie's TEN LITTLE INDIANS, people begin to die! It becomes a race against time to discover who the murderer is...<br />The two story lines intertwine in a very surprising manner, making IDENTITY far superior to the 'by-the-numbers' gore-fests that pass themselves off as 'suspense', with the climactic twist a stunning revelation that is VERY effective!<br />If you like your films challenging, you're in for a treat...IDENTITY delivers!
B000008JUM|5.0|This CD is one of my absolute favorites! It is so easy to listen to over and over again. I love the originality of the artist's interpretations of Cole Porter's songs. The order and artist's renditions of the songs flow nicely together. What a great way to enjoy some classic songs all over again! You should really buy this CD if you enjoy cool, funky music!
B00005JKZV|5.0|Two Towers is buy far the best 2nd act of a trilogy ever made.  This movie is incredible, and actually builds on the first.
B00003CXTG|1.0|The cinematography was beautiful and the sets were beautiful, catching the time period perfectly. What a pity that they had to be wasted on this pitiful excuse of a movie!<br />Much like \\"Titanic\\" which preceded it (for which the above paragraph could apply in its entirety), \\"Pearl Harbor\\", rather than being a great movie about a historic tragic event, offended the viewer by using the event merely as a backdrop for a \\"chick flick\\" plot...and a very POOR one at that. <br />I truly looked forward to this movie, believing the writers and producers would show this event the respect it deserved. So sad that the remaining WWII vets get THIS as a \\"tribute\\". What an insult! One can only envision the next step being a romance story called \\"9-11: The Twin Towers\\".
B000002KFJ|5.0|Black Sabbath changed their sound on every album.  The first song on Sabotage, Hole In The Sky, continues the move away from the deep, moaning guitar riffs found on albums preceding Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, replaced by a crisper, metallic sting.  Where in the past, Iommi's bar chords resembled the strike of a single, heavy string tuned very low, there is now a discernible blend of notes.  Though the tone of the record is dark, the sound is relatively bright compared to past efforts.  The production is analog perfection.<br />Am I Going Insane was reportedly slated for Osbourne's ill-fated solo project.  It was clearly produced with hopes of radio airplay, but it was Symptom Of The Universe that made its way to the FM airwaves in nineteen seventy-five.  Its simple downstroke and three-chord progression might draw comparisons to Paranoid, but both guitar and voice are less melodic and more intense.  The song caught the attention of DJs but never captured the hearts of the jingle-happy Top 40 fans.<br />Megalomania finds Ozzie once again exploring his neurosis.  The theme shows up often in his lyrics.  Duh.  Like many of the songs, you have to listen for subtle but creative fills and changes.<br />On The Thrill Of It All, Iommi demonstrates a lead guitar proficiency that had been in hiding since the first album, while Osbourne seems an infinite source of vocal licks.<br />The Writ will cause your jaw to drop.  The song lures listeners in with an eerily tranquil bass line and then shocks like a horror movie that makes you jump back in your seat.   It is truly awe-inspiring. <br />The fact that this album has not received mass radio airplay speaks volumes about the sad state of that medium.  One of the most influential and enduring bands in rock and roll is virtually nonexistent in the stale, repetitive environment of classic rock radio.  How 'bout another helping of Baba O'Riley?  Yeah, another deep cut!...or is it a lost track?
0385504209|5.0|Normally I am not much for books on bestseller lists but this one intrigued me.<br />Dan Brown most certainly did his homework with this book. His details are so exacting. I found myself actually getting up and cross-referencing some information in the book, which 90% of the time...seemed to be right on the money.<br />This is a smart book that could have taken a turn into the world of hack-writers like Grisham but didn't.  You get the sense  that Dan Brown really wants to write these for the sake of writing and because the subject matter truly interests him. He gives enough detail so that you can visualize where you are and what you are looking at but not too much so as you cannot use your imagination as far as the characters go.<br />As I said,I usually stick to classics but the intrigue and the subject matter made me give it a whirl and I wasn't sorry at all...I am always telling other people to read it. I found it that compelling.<br />Cheers!
B000000OAC|5.0|Come 1977, the rock music world took some drastic turns. We witnessed the glory days of progressive rock, which started around the late 60s, and the creativity exhibited in that period seemed to only blossom and intensify up until the mid-70s. Ambitions were the order of the day, and it seemed like many bands - more or less - were trying to outdo one another in terms of technical prowess, intelligent lyrics, orchestral ambition and/or originality. However, the hyper-ambitious, long-winded, intelligent (some would say pompous) art that was popular shortly before began to wear thin, as many music fans wanted things to return to it's raw, dirty (and simple) roots.<br /><br />The punks seem to appear on the scene at the right time to bring rock back to it's dangerous and dirty roots. The Sex Pistols seemed to be the band who led the charge, and guys like Johnny Rotten (frontman of the Pistols) and Joey Ramone (The Ramones) have verbally attacked Yes, Pink Floyd, Queen, and several others of the art-rock ilk for their long-winded arrangements, grand ambitions and fantasy/cosmic/literary material. (One of the members of the Sex Pistols wore a t-shirt that read the words, \\"I hate Pink Floyd,\\" while another member reportedly had a brief bit of words with Queen frontman Freddie Mercury, as a few reviews below state.)<br /><br />1977 also saw genres like disco, and what many call \\"corporate\\" rock, running wild. While bands like Yes and Pink Floyd continued to release \\"long-winded\\" material, Queen took an entirely different approach. Making art-rock albums since their inception, their creativity culminated with the ambitious, diverse and operatic A NIGHT AT THE OPERA (1975), and it's stripped-down, but no less ambitious companion A DAY AT THE RACES (1976). So, on NEWS OF THE WORLD, Queen wisely chose to cut down on the sophisticated operatic arrangements, and focus their attention on a more straightforward, harder-edged album -- with attitude. They basically dropped the \\"art\\" rock, and made more \\"hard\\" rock this time out. Complex arrangements are still present, but are so subtle, some may not recognize them.<br /><br />But Queen's well-known diversity still remains intact. You get Latin-infused, elegant numbers like \\"Who Needs You,\\" bluesy workouts like Brian May's \\"Sleeping On the Sidewalk,\\" in which he also performs the lead vocal, sophisticated piano-driven pop numbers like \\"All Dead, All Dead,\\" a song written for Brian May's deceased cat I believe, and an elegant late-night jazz workout on Freddie Mercury's \\"My Melancholy Blues.\\" The versatility of this band was simply awe-inspiring, and possibly the envy of many.<br /><br />Now that all of that's out of the way, Queen ROCKS with the rest of the tracks. Everyone knows \\"We Will Rock You\\" and \\"We Are The Champions.\\" The latter exhibits brilliant arrangements - not to mention the apparent 12/8 time (7+5?) - which may be obfuscated for it's overplaying time on the radio. \\"Sheer Heart Attack\\" (not to be confused with the album of the same name) is just a lethal super-heavy monster. A fast-paced, supercharged heavy-hitter which may be able to induce a heart attack if played too loudly. There may also be a biting jab made toward the punks in one of the lyrics (\\"I feel so in-ar, in-ar, in-ar...ticulate.\\") Written by drummer Roger Taylor, he shares the vocal with Freddie Mercury, as well as contributing bass and rhythm guitar parts, which give the track it's extra heaviness. The prog rock epic of the album, however, is \\"It's Late,\\" a love tale written by Brian May, and written in three parts (or scenes), and features an explosive John Bonhamesque drum solo at the end. I'll be the first to mention that the comparisons some people (and critics) make between Queen and Led Zeppelin are atrociously ridiculous, inaccurate and shallow (Queen sounded like nobody but themselves to me), but this part of the song is the closest Queen ever got to resembling Zeppelin.<br /><br />With this album, Queen would abandon their unique brand of art rock for good. Is it ironic that the cover art of this album shows a gigantic robot killing the members of Queen? Was it a symbol that the operatic, original \\"queen\\" was no more? Or, was it purely coincidental? They would not make music resembling their 70s material for years to come (even if the small resurgences were slightly transformed.) NEWS OF THE WORLD is 70s Queen at their most straightforward and heavy. Highly recommended.rock for good.

Her voice is like none other of the female artists today. She is in a class all by herself!! Her ballads are beautiful!! This is definitely an all-purpose album.

0790729709|1.0|Most of the DVD review Web sites blasted this release  for the lousy quality of the transfer.  Somewhat odd for Warners to give it so little attention when you consider what a hit it was.  But I  guess  they are doing the usual  &quot;double-dipping&quot;  of releasing a lousy  version first and then making fans purchase  a new edition that is cleaned up down the road.  Most strange of all is that it's a full-screen cropped pan and scan transfer.  I guess there are some people  who will consider buying  full-screen movies  with  part of the image chopped off (not to mention what they'll be stuck  with  when HD wide-screens come into wide use by 2006.  But  it's a  real shame that they don't offer a widescreen alternative.  Though to be honest,  until they produce a less grainy version, I won't be buying it.
B000066NW0|1.0|although i did not buy this cd, i have heard the whole thing... unlike people who just get on here to bash avril lavigne.  i will admit, i do not like the girl... but when i first heard about her, i thought it was pretty cool that there was actually a famous girl who could also play the guitar, and skateboard just like me... however i was wrong.  according to her liner notes, avril does not play the guitar (nor does she skateboard...) on any of her songs  except for &quot;complicated&quot;.  this cd was completely pop in my opinion except maybe losing grip and unwanted.  i will admit, that those songs are not that bad, but if you tried listening to my local modern rock radio station, you would never hear them on there... (not like i listen to the radio though...).  avril's cd is quite disappointing to me because i would have expected that her songs be &quot;hardcore&quot; as she made them out to be.  i would have also expected her to at least play her guitar more since that is what she was advertised as.  her song &quot;nobody's fool&quot; is extremely annoying because she tries to rap in it.  her unsuccessful attempts also show in her lyrics as well.  avril does not, however, write the songs on her cd by herself.  so for all the people who say she has talent, read the cd notes yourself and you will see that she did not in fact write all her songs &quot;on her own&quot; as she claims.  what talent is there?  anyone can co-write a song.  add a few words or two.  claim that it's yours.  maybe if i were in the pop scene, i would enjoy this cd.  but however, i am known to listen to good music, and if you want to want to waste your money... go ahead.
B000083E79|5.0|This is the best greatest hits collection I've ever heard.  It includes all her old and new hits and the sound quality is AWESOME to say the least.  This is a MUST HAVE for any Cher fan as well as those who just know and enjoy her hits.  If you don't know many Cher songs and want to give her music a try, this is the CD to buy.  INCREDIBLE and worth every cent.  Don't let this one slip by.
B00005JL96|5.0|Lilo &amp; Stitch is one of the best animated motion pictures of our time, right up there with the Lion King. I loved this movie. It had great characters, great plot, great music and great animation. Trust me this is one adventure you won't want to miss. It entertains ages from little kids to adults.<br />Get this one because there aren't many movies out there like it.
B0000A02TZ|3.0|Everyone else seemed to cover the content of the DVD, but I'd just like to rant about a new device that Universal has forced on the DVD buying public where everytime you want to view the disc you have to sit through several promos for upcoming releases. It took about 8 minutes before the main menu would come up and, at least my player would not allow me to forward to the menu earlier promting the warning &quot;Not Permitted&quot; when I would try. But thankfully, I only rented this, so I'm only slightly bitter.:-)
B0000A02TZ|1.0|I  purchased this and then returned it after learning of the five minutes of previews and commercials  that are required to be played before getting to the movie.  Universal, long the worst DVD  producer in Hollywood, has outdone themselves with this one.  Who would consider sitting through five minutes of junk  that cannot be forwarded past  every time they  want to see this film? Ridiculous.   After their problems  with  the Back the Future II and III recall and the Jurassic Park disc mail-in,  you'd think  they'd try  harder  not to  inconvenience their fans.  They clearly don't care.  So I don't care to buy their products.
0375703764|5.0|Danielewski is either a genies or insane, perhaps both. This book is the most involving, deepest, scarriest, and saddest book I have read yet.<br />The book is a sort of story wihtin a story within a story. Danielski uses a mix of prose(which apparently someone related to a text book... its actual much more of a scientific finding/theory, not at all text book like, not very many parts of the book are like this, but its neat and intresting to say the least...) narration, and notes to increase the depth of the novel. Many times I found myself asking, is this really jsut fiction, is there no actual basis; other times I found myself wishing some of ti was factual, some part of it somewhere. For all of this to be from one mind is simply amazing. This book was very fun to read as well, not only in a comedic sense form part to part, but also getting to flip the book around, and trying to tie in connections.<br />the 700 pages may seem a bit much at first, but once you get going... you find youself wishing it were even logner... at least I did... and I'm used to reading things at max around 400 pages...<br />I'll be buying his next book for sure.
0345350499|5.0|This book is a classic.  I have read other accounts of Arthurian legend, but this book has remained, in my mind, the quintessential archetype and the standard against which all else, be it modern or ancient, must be judged.  Check out her book the Firebrand, in which she tells the Trojan war through the eyes of Kassandra.  It's not as good as this, but still good.
B000002GYN|5.0|Here is another classic album where there are a lot of songs on the album do not get FM airplay, but really should.  Great Songs like &quot;Nightingale&quot;, and &quot;Train Leaves Here This Morning&quot;.   These are wonderful songs.   I love listening to them and singing along while driving my car.
B000063DIR|1.0|Simply put, I had to give this a one-star review because there is nothing lower that I could have given it. While Robert Trujillo does an admiral job in recreating the sounds of Bob Daisley's bass lines; the mockery that Mike Bordin makes of Lee Kerslake's drum tracks is a disgrace. <br />The only reason I can think of for wanting to buy this re-master would be to gain a greater appreciation of the work of Misters Daisley and Kerslake. From a purist's point of view, this release is pure rubbish.

B00009V8Z9|5.0|I actually got an advanced copy of this CD back in May, it was only four songs long, but I kept listening to them over and over again. I'm a big fan of singer/songwriters. Rufus Wainwright, John Mayer, Jason Mraz, Amiee Mann -these are great writers of songs and they sing them with a passion you can't get from pop music. This album is wonderful in many ways, from begining to end, with Follow Through, Just Friends and Chariot easy to sing along with. When I met him at a recent House of Blues concert here in Chicago, I was as giddy as a school girl. He signed my CD's and his smile will melt any girl (or gay boy's) heart. Not since Rufus Wainwright's debut album have I found a CD that I thought was this good. I proudly wear my Gavin DeGraw T-shirt and tell people to buy this album, you'll not be disappointed.

I checked out the album and it overwhelemed me, these guys can bring the noise, and they bring it hard and heavy. If you're into fast, loud, blow speakers up music, this is the perfect album.<br />standout tracks: psycho, prison song
B00006M183|4.0|Pearl Jam's 7th studio album is a hard album to review. Buying it I wasn't sure if I'd get another great Vitalogy or a disappointing Binaural. Riot Act proves to be neither great nor disappointing. Overall it is a good album by Pearl Jam and it is much better than most rock out there today. Sure they have been eclipsed by great bands such as Creed but Pearl Jam are still great themselves and very relevant. Their guitar playing is still fun and lively. Matt Cameron is great on the drums. Eddie sings great and has nice lyrics. I think some people have been turned off by their politics and it is their loss. I love Pearl Jam and respect their views. I think they should be applauded for making heart felt songs and saying what they believe. At least they are true to themselves and make uncompromising music for their fans regardless of trends.<br />1. Can't Keep 8/10 Good drum begining and very good song.<br />2. Save You 8/10 Good fast rockin song.<br />3. Love Boat Captain 8/10 Starts slow but then rocks nicely and has great lyrics. <br />4. Cropduster 8/10 Good rockin song sounds like it is from No Code.<br />5. Ghost 8/10 One of the better songs on the album.<br />6. I Am Mine 8/10 First single that starts off like a Creed song.<br />7. Thumping My Way 8/10 Good soft acoustic song sort of like Off He goes from No Code.<br />8. You Are 8/10 Most different song they have ever done. Really electronic sounding. Good lyrics.<br />9. Get Right 8/10 Fast, with good riffs and drumbeat.<br />10. Green Disease 8/10 Good song with a mechanical sounding drumbeat.<br />11. Help Help 3/10 Slow, boring song.<br />12. Bushleaguer 8/10 I think its funny. The moment you can't criticize your leader you might as well want to live in Nazi Germany.<br />13. 1/2 Full 7/10 Sounds like Dissident from Vs.<br />14. Arc 1/10 A minute of nothing special.<br />15. All or None 8/10 Good slow, acoustic song to close the album.<br />Overall a good album. None of the songs are great per se but they arevery good. All Pearl Jam fans should get this album. those interested in Pearl Jam should also get this album they won't be disappointed. Get some of their concert Cds that feature these songs and hear them take on a whole new life played live to a crowd. Pearl Jam are a great band and have stood the test of time and will continue making good/great music regardless of trends.
B00008H2LE|5.0|Approaching the release date of Linkin Park's sophomore album I'll admit a die-hard fan such as me even had my doubts about repeating the spectacular debut in Hybrid Theory and the success it became. It earned them many more fans and introduced a unique style in which they blend a touch of hip-hop with hard rock. But I was surprised when I first heard this album of just how amazing this band really is. In my opinion, it not only equaled Hybrid, but is better. They have become more mature lyrically and all songs are held with deep meaning within those words that people can really relate to with songs such as Easier to Run and Numb. Just like Hybrid Theory, there isn't a bad song on the album. <br />1. Foreword: Only 13 seconds of pounding to introduce the album's first song \\"Don't Stay\\".  5/10<br />2. Don't Stay: This is a great hard rock song that'll get your adrenaline pumping rite off the bat. The bass in this song is probably the most intense and best in any LP song. 9/10<br />3. Somewhere I Belong: First single off Meteora, has that very much \\"Linkin Park\\" sound to it and is about finding your place in life. Great single to kick off the new album. 10/10<br />4. Lying From You: First taste of the hip-hop/rock genre fans are used to seeing from LP. Again, they do it rite and the song comes out really good. 9/10<br />5. Hit the Floor: Kinda song you wouldn't ever expect, with hip-hop verses and a slamming hard rock chorus filled with intense screaming to the core. It's decent but there are much better songs. 6/10<br />6. Easier To Run: In my opinion, this is one of the most powerful songs lyrically on Meteora. I can't describe it, you need to hear it to get the real feeling but it's about escaping pain from your past and how to deal with it. 8/10<br />7. Faint: Second single which starts off with some strings that work great with the song. I love the chorus in this which climaxes at the bridge where Chester gets into some more of his heavy yelling. I would say probably the most popular song on the CD...and for good reason. 10/10<br />8. Figure.09: More hip-hop verses with singing chorus with rock music as the background. Nothing more to say about it except it comes out awesome. 9/10<br />9. Breaking the Habit: Just for those of you who don't know..6 years in the making for the finished product of this song. The vocals are unbelievable that are sang by Chester with the deep meaningful lyrics written by Mike about turning your life around by breaking a serious habit someone has. All this to a tune of a some-16 piece live orchestra featuring a piano and strings. Very unique song, another album favorite. 10/10<br />10. From the Inside: Excellent keyboarding by Joe Hahn starts off the song about being lied to and not being able to trust anyone after being deceived. Song progessively gets into more yelling as it goes on with a concluding repeated, \\"I won't trust myself with you!!\\" 9/10<br />11. Nobody's Listening: Song is different from the rest of this album. This proves LP is into trying new things, as this track features a rare Japenese flute as it's background beat to compliment Mike's dark rhymes about pain. 7/10<br />12. Session: Cure for the Itch Part 2...Hahn once again goes to work on those turntables and creates a sick track just like on Hybrid.  7/10<br />13. Numb: The final track on Meteora reaches back to the rock feeling, only this is a deep song with a slower style. Absolutely impossible not to like, it's my favorite Linkin Park song. It relates to the idea of when your little people envision you as what they want you to become in life and to meet their expectations of you. So it's about finding yourself and to do what you want to become. The bridge in this song is outstanding, it gives me goosebumps when I hear it. 11/10
0375703764|5.0|Danielewski is either a genies or insane, perhaps both. This book is the most involving, deepest, scarriest, and saddest book I have read yet.<br />The book is a sort of story wihtin a story within a story. Danielski uses a mix of prose(which apparently someone related to a text book... its actual much more of a scientific finding/theory, not at all text book like, not very many parts of the book are like this, but its neat and intresting to say the least...) narration, and notes to increase the depth of the novel. Many times I found myself asking, is this really jsut fiction, is there no actual basis; other times I found myself wishing some of ti was factual, some part of it somewhere. For all of this to be from one mind is simply amazing. This book was very fun to read as well, not only in a comedic sense form part to part, but also getting to flip the book around, and trying to tie in connections.<br />the 700 pages may seem a bit much at first, but once you get going... you find youself wishing it were even logner... at least I did... and I'm used to reading things at max around 400 pages...<br />I'll be buying his next book for sure.
B000067CPX|4.0|The last album they did had some great songs but this album, ALL of the songs are great. The first couple of singles came out and were excellent so I got the album and was glad that I did. They're very melodic and at times funky and in my opinion this was one of the best rock albums of '03.<br />standout tracks: dosed, minor thing
0375432302|5.0|Those christian readers that take the bible literally, believe everything they are told by their church, and are not used to critical thinking should stay away from this book. You will waste money on a book that is going to cause you anger and frustration (see some of the reviews here...).<br />To all others I really recomend this book. It is both enlighting and entertaining. Remember that it is fiction, but you will read about a lot of facts that you probably didn't know.

I really would like to know what happened to the band because they didn't sound like this before.  This CD is just dull.  I just don't like it that's all.  I would recommend their earlier CDs though.

B00005JKZV|5.0|Anyone who complains and quibbles about Peter Jackson's version of The Lord of the Rings, especially the Two Towers, needs to pause and reflect on where we were only 2 years ago....with the exception of endlessly reading the books or listening to the very good audio version produced by the Mind's Eye, what else did we have? Well there was Ralph Barkshi's 70's animated attempt which, though it had it's moments, was a disaster and left incomplete. Then we had the animated TV version of The Hobbit which was fairly good considering the confines of time. This however was followed up by the rather pathetic Return of the King. Throughout all this time, we would read little snippets of news that director \\"so and so\\" was interested in producing a film version but it never would come to fruition.<br />Along comes Peter Jackson..not only does he tackle a work, that for some people, ranks higher than the Bible for scholarly interpretation, but he has the foresight to produce all three movies simultaneously and provide us with high quality entertainment for three consecutive years. I shudder to think what George Lukas would have done with Tolkien. Know one thing, like Star Wars, Lukas' Ring trilogy would have taken 12 years or more to complete, so let's be thankful that he did not get his hands on it.<br />Tolkien purists who complain about sections missing or changed need to put their egos on hold and realize that this movie was made for ALL audiences, not just for them. Sure there were things that annoyed me but, with a shrug, I realized that Jackson knows what he's doing and who am I to question him... how Faramir is handled is a perfect example...there was no real conflict in the original Frodo-Faramir encounter so Jackson probably realized that, since conflict propels a story forward, he needed to have Faramir behave like most Humans would when faced with the chance of taking the Ring. That is afterall, the centerpiece of the Ring, namely Man's lust and greed for power. Andsince Faramir does redeem himself at the end, he now is more align with Tolkiens original intent....Remember, this movie wasn't made just for Tolkien afficionados though they are the ones acting like monday morning quarterbacks regarding this film...it amazes me how short sighted some people are...So, everyone take a deep breath and relax and enjoy what is no doubt the epic masterpiece in fantasy film making...the extended version trailer shows great promise and the Return of the King featurette makes you long for winter's coming....
B0000B1OE7|4.0|wow, Ninja Scroll, tenth anniversary wow. Sorry.<br />I watch Ninja scroll religously, but feel guilty about it because it has very small amounts of redeeming Value. Between rape scenes and people getting stung to death, There seems to be very little time for Psychological chit chats or any other type of something that makes a movie worthy watching.<br />So why do I like it, you ask?<br />A good question. Maybe because it's so... so... COOL. Kawajiri Directs with style and originality, The way he can excecute any type of fight scene completely flawlessly is beyond me. He can create characters that you end up actually CARING about. PLus the animation is cool.<br />I'm sure the 10th anniversary version will have tons of reasons to buy it in the special features section, But since I don't own it(yet) I am unable to tell you about them.<br />Thank you for reading my endless Amounts of babble, I wasted 30 seconds of you life.

0393317552|5.0|This intriguing and expansive book gathers knowledge from a number of fields (archaeology, anthropology, ecology, evolutionary biology, horticulture, and more). Its novelty is not in the details, any of which can be found in other books, but in the synthesis of 13,000 years' worth of human history. Diamond argues that many (but not all) of \\"the striking differences between the long-term histories of peoples of the different continents have been due not to innate differences in the people themselves but to differences in their environments.\\"<br />Diamond covers so much material that any attempt at summary would be imprecise. The sections I found most compelling dealt with agriculture and animal husbandry--two topics that would have probably induced sleep if covered by another author. For example, he presents the fascinating background that the dominant five \\"large\\" domesticated mammals--sheep, goats, cattle, pigs, and horses--originated in central Eurasia (and that no easily domesticated, large mammals were available, for example, to North Americans or Australians); that these animals include the world's only widespread \\"beasts of burden,\\" giving their human handlers additional advantages in mobility and farming; and that most of the world's lethal diseases resulted from proximity to the barnyard, gradually providing Eurasians with immunity to illnesses that later wiped out entire societies upon first exposure. The minor mammals (camels, llamas, reindeer) were too limited by geography and climate to affect the course of history outside their confines. As for zebras, bears, giraffes, tigers, hippos--to this day, nobody has been able to domesticate them. While this seems intuitively obvious, no writer has so clearly and irrefutably connected the dots, showing how access to these animals gave early chiefdoms an insurmountable advantage over those human societies without them and allowed them to develop surpluses and commerce that supported the world's most enduring civilizations.<br />Comments made by the author's critics, while few in number, nearly prevented me from reading this book and need to be addressed so other readers won't be similarly discouraged. A few readers seem offended by Diamond's self-mocking and somewhat tongue-in-cheek assertion (in the Introduction) that the natives of New Guinea have certain advantages that make them arguably more \\"intelligent.\\" Yet these commentators are willfully ignoring the context: Diamond admits that \\"New Guineans tend to perform poorly at tasks that Westerners have been trained to perform since childhood,\\" yet he is quite aware of how \\"stupid I look to New Guineans when I'm with them in the jungle.\\" That is, if one defines \\"intelligence\\" not as the knowledge needed to use a computer or write a book review but, rather, as the ability to survive in the wild (\\"following a jungle trail\\" or identifying poisonous mushrooms, to cite two of the author's examples), then the New Guineans win hands down. To make a similarly lighthearted argument: when the house of cards we call \\"civilization\\" is threatened by the least misfortune (economic recession, power blackout, bad weather, the death of a British princess), a frightening number of otherwise \\"intelligent\\" people, instead of relying on their wits and survival skills, rush straight for their therapists.<br />Likewise, anyone who accuses Diamond of \\"geographic determinism\\" cannot have read the epilogue, in which he clearly rejects such an extreme position. He admits that individuals and cultures--and, for that matter, pure chance--can also influence history, but \\"that some environments provide more starting materials, and more favorable conditions for utilizing inventions, then do other environments.\\" The author's argument is unambiguous: while culture, as well as individual inventors and rulers, certainly influence history on a microcosmic level (during spans of centuries or millennia), there are larger factors, such as geography and ecology,at play when human history is considered as a whole over the last 13,000 years. Diamond is looking at the forest rather than the trees; thus, to fault the author for ignoring such factors as religion and politics is off the mark, since such belief systems didn't exist in anything remotely resembling their present form for most of the period under discussion. Furthermore, to identify human advances in terms of culture still fails to explain how differing cultures arose in the first place.<br />Finally, and more easily dismissed, are those hecklers who howl \\"political correctness.\\" Such critics seldom identify flaws in the author's arguments or even tell us what they insinuate by this increasingly meaningless term.<br />Since the book's span is so sweeping and since many of Diamond's hypotheses are offered tentatively (as suggestions for a new \\"science\\" of history), there are bound to be statements or implications that may eventually prove inaccurate or too simplistic. I strongly suspect, however, that his overarching thesis will withstand the test of time; at the very least, \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\" will inspire open-minded thinkers to consider human history--in its broadest sense--in a whole new light.at play when human history is considered as a whole over the last 13,000 years.

B00005JKZV|4.0|You've got action, angst, humor, romance, and Gollum. It all makes for a blockbuster. <BR>But not all is well. Now don't get me wrong, I'm not a purist. I know the book and movie can't be the same, or else it'd take forever to tell. But some of the changes made by Jackson and crew were really unneccesary. <BR>[begin rant]<BR>-Why did the Elves have to march into Helm's Deep? The Battle of The Last Alliance is called that for a reason.<BR>-Why was Faramir such a prick? Having a 'good' Faramir was a gamble, yes, but one that they should have still tried.<BR>-Why did Merry backtalk to Treebeard, and why did the Ents seem like such boneheads?<BR>-Why was Gimli scraping the bottom of the barrel for humor? Poor Gimli. I felt sorry for his character.<BR>-Why in the name of Hades was Legolas using a skateboar..Okay, I'll stop here.<BR>[/end rant]<BR>They say for the movie to work, changes were necessary. The movie could have still worked, I say, had they not changed SO MUCH. Jackson and crew would have still been left with a mega-blockbuster. FOTR was about as good as a movie adaptation could get. Where did this go wrong?<br />Forgetting the books for a minute: The movie, even to someone whose ever read the books, is not seamless. Not everything flows well. Some scenes are totally out in the left field (all Treebeard scenes). Perhaps the movie is flawed because it had to be chopped up due to time constraints. Let's hope the extended version fixes it. (That said, it's a wiser move to wait and buy the long version only).<br />However, there are many good points. The acting was pretty decent. Gollum was fantastic. Many of the battle scenes rocked. Special effects were seamless. The ending shot (of Mount Doom) was inspired. And this is just to name a few.<BR>Note: The best scenes of the movie, in my opinion, were the 'Arwen' scenes. Yes, of course this veers from the novel, but I loved this change. These scenes were perfect, and kept 100% in the 'feel' of the books. Had all thechanges been as good as this, then this movie would probably be untouchable.<br />To the average joe whose never read the books, this movie is an absolute mega-hit. An all-time favourite.<BR>But to others...they must still wait for the definitive adaptation of the 'The Two Towers'. Though, I'd say this comes extremely close. But given the bar that was set by FOTR, it's comes up short. So don't be tempted by the 10 minute preview of Return of the King, wait for the Extended edition.<BR>
B00008J4P5|3.0|A nice return to 70's punk roots here. I found the vocals good and the lyrics relevant. I listened to Stripes' earlier work and they have morphed a bit here. This is a good mellow punk CD. It is melodic and ranks near Siouxee. BTW - there is one absolute kickin' blues track with Holly Golightly. It doesn't fit anywhere on the CD, but it is just awesome.
6300215741|4.0|This is probably Hitchcock's most beautiful movie.  Grace Kelly is well (but of course decorously) displayed in delicate and perfectly fitted summer dresses and evening gowns (designed by Edith Head) that show off her exquisite arms and shoulders while accentuating her elegant neck and jaw line--and, as she turns for the camera, the graceful line of her back.  Opposite her is one of Hollywood's most dashing leading men, the incomparable Cary Grant.<br />The cinematography by long-time Hitchcock collaborator Robert Burks was shot on location in the French Riviera.  The style is daylight clear and sparkling, bright as the dream of a princess to be, always focused without a hint of darkness anywhere.  Even the scenes shot at night on the rooftops seem to glow.  The houses on the hills overlooking Princess Grace's future home and the narrow cobble stone roads with the low-lying stone walls suggest a refined and elegant lifestyle to come.  Even though she drives too fast, one is not worried that she might crash...<br />Cary Grant is John Robie who fought with the French resistence during WWII and then became a jewel thief, dubbed \\"The Cat\\" for his ability to slink quietly in the night over roof tops and to steal into the bedrooms of the rich and take their jewels without waking them.  As the movie opens he is retired from his life of crime and living comfortably in a villa in the hills above Nice.  The complications begin immediately as the police arrive at his villa to question him about some recent cat-like jewel robberies.  Robie is innocent of course (we are led to believe) and to prove his innocence he is motivated to find the real thief.<br />Grace Kelly plays Frances Stevens, the slightly naughty nouveau riche daughter of the widow of a Texas-style oil millionaire.  She is used to having men fall all over themselves trying to court her, but Robie seems uninterested, and this excites her fancy and she goes after him.  It is interesting to note that by this time Cary Grant (51 when the film was released) had become such a heart throb that directors liked to have the women (who were always noticeably younger; Kelly was 26) chase after him.  Audrey Hepburn does as much in Charade (1963).  One notes that here, as in Charade, the women kiss Cary Grant first, not the other way around.  Here it is nicely done as the previously demure Frances takes a surprising initiative at the door of her hotel suite.<br />The story itself is rather bland and predictable, reminding me of a James Bond flick from, say, the sixties as though toned down for an audience of old maids.  Notable in supporting roles are Brigitte Auber as the athletic Danielle Foussard, John Williams as the British insurance agent, and Jessie Royce Landis as Frances Stevens' mother.  Hitch makes his de rigueur appearance as a passenger on the mini-bus that Robie takes to get away from the gendarmes early in the film.<br />See this for Grace Kelly whose cool and playful demeanor and statuesque beauty form the heart of this somewhat languid romantic thriller.y Grant (51 when the film was released) had become such a heart throb that directors liked to have the women (who were always noticeably younger; Kelly was 26) chase after him.

0452282152|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this story. Maybe this has been done before, I don't know, but it seemed like a very creative idea to take one painting and write a whole story around it. The calm and clever Griet balances the characters in the household where she's a maid, making for a perfect balanch in the cast of characters. I did find it helpful to get a book from the library that had Vermeer's paintings in it. About six or seven different Vermeer paintings are mentioned in the book and it helped to be able to see them...
B00005JM02|5.0|This is a really brilliant movie! Believe me, I don't easily like movies, even if I am a cartoon fan. But I was bowled over by this one! I thought Shrek couldn't be outdone, but I had even more fun watching this one than I did watching Shrek. The verbal humour is so slick, flows so thick and fast, you'd want to see it a couple times just to make sure you got all the jokes :). And of course, the animation is great too -- water is one of the most difficult mediums to rend well, and they've done a great job of it -- not to mention the fish, which are gorgeous as well.<br />This is a great family movie -- everyone will find a LOT to enjoy, across age levels.<br />Kudos!! I'm anxiously waiting for the DVD to come out!
B00005JKZV|3.0|Re: Carl Haas, berserkerwhatever who is laughably blind, deaf and more dumb in ways i didn't imagine possible in movie critiquing... OH PUH-LEEEEZE... you sit around and talk about \\"lightening up\\" and \\"getting a life\\", that it's \\"just a movie\\" but you're so riled up with a difference in opinion from a couple of ppl that prefer the book more to the movie because they've probably been devout fans for ages (this ISN'T just a book you know - it actually has become a LEGEND that has spurred on countless conventions, experts and nearly-cult-like attention before a movie of it was ever even dreamed of being made). Naturally there'd be a few disgruntled ones out there. What's the big deal? Some ppl don't like the direction in which the legend was taken and some of them have just as much valid points as you. Yes, they may not be experts at film - but neither are you but does that make it justifiable to just accept a much popular epic story being shredded unnecessarily at least according to the opinions of some?? My personal opinion - the movie definitely didn't shred the entire PLOT but the whole core of the idea Tolkien was taking with his story which NATURALLY does not need to be translated in \\"15 hrs\\" of footage or dictated \\"page for page\\" was altered at some times unnecessarily.. and well, not for the better. As one reveiwer put it, it was simply not helpful.. if it's anything it may have made things a bit more complicated. Now while I slashed the anti-purists i do have to admit that some of the purists can be a bit anal-retentive.. yeah, it would have been nice to see certain things in the movie done the same way (like the whole brooch thing with Pippen) but that shouldn't allow you to ruin your whole experience. Truth be told: Peter Jackson is the director and of course that gave him the liberty to interpret things in the book differently to what the fans did and really we all have different interpretations of things. Some of it I didn't like, some were ok but in the end I liked it for what it is and we all need to admit converting a plot like this to a movie is an immensely difficult task and it's not easier with mounting pressure from as I say, cult-like fans. I walked in knowing there were things i wouldn't like, as I will with RTK. I didn't care much for the choppy editing.. i think transition from scene to scene and character crisis didn't flow in the least bit but I do feel for PJ because he had to work with the outline of the story which was originally a written thing (kind of like thinking in and out of a box at the same time). When I watch the film I usually skip to just Helm's Deep because as I said I appreciate the movie for what it is - great action which is where it all starts (though not great set work, CGI input and don't get me started on the script). Yet despite all these complaints I liked some parts of it, particularly the battles. My suggestion: the movie is definitely worth watching and you will like some parts but I wouldn't go overboard calling it excellent and breathtaking.. frankly I felt the first one was more of that than this one.
B00005JM02|5.0|This movie is not your standard summer movie.... instead, it is a fully entertaining movie masterpiece. Finding Nemo is perhaps the best Disney movie for kids since Toy Story 2, and it delivers for the entire 2 hour length of the film. The basic premise is that an overprotective clownfish loses his son Nemo when he wants to escape the rules and regulations of his father. The result is a fun, comical journey featuring true dedication of a father for his son and the eventual trust that a parent must place in their child as they let them make decisions on their own. A cast of colorful (literally) characters and many funny moments make this surprisingly good movie even better. Several of the fish act like they are on a permanent sugar high, but they are funny and not unbearably annoying. If you thought that Hollywood was going down the tubes with hackneyed slasher fics, action-driven sequels with no plot (The Matrix Reloaded *ahem*), and other vapid movies, think again! I am not yet an adult with children, but I enjoyed Nemo thoroughly. Parents with small children will not mind this movie at all, though some moments are frightening or sad to children under 7. This movie is quite simply a triumph. It is interesting, simple, funny, and beautifully animated. Best of all, it's original and doesn't need a sequel, but knowing Disney.... watch out for Finding Nemo 2: Nemo's Kids.... ugh.
B0000039PW|5.0|One of the best albums all time from any genre. While he may be rapping about crude topics witnessed on the streets, Biggie still expresses a great intelligence and creativity that is unseen in the rappers of today. I've never met a person, white, black, male, female, whatever, that doesn't like this album. Albums like this, Illmatic, and some of Pac's releases showcase what makes rap great. Hopefully in the future we'll see more albums like these. But back to the album, it's great, go pick it up.
B00006CXSS|5.0|BAND OF BROTHERS (2001)    Aspect ratio: 1.78:1  Soundtracks: Dolby 5.1 / DTS 5.1    The trials and tribulations of Easy Company, 506th Regiment of the 101st Airborne Division, from the D-Day landings in Normandy to their capture of Hitler's Eagle's Nest in Austria at the end of World War II.    Co-produced by Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg, HBO's epic 10-part miniseries (based on a terrific bestselling book by the late Stephen E. Ambrose) was the most expensive TV undertaking of its day, costing a massive $120 million to produce. And, as the old saying goes, every penny is up there on the screen. Borne from the success of Spielberg's SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (1998) - with which it shares a similar dramatic and visual style - BAND OF BROTHERS' recreation of a glorious (and hard-won) chapter in American history assumed an even greater patriotic significance during its initial US broadcast, when it coincided with the horrific attacks that destroyed the World Trade Center in September 2001.     Written with economy and grace, and directed with emotional intensity by a series of directors (including Phil Alden Robinson, Richard Loncraine and Hanks himself) whose combined efforts achieve a genuine aesthetic uniformity, the movie is a masterpiece of storytelling and historical documentation. Punctuated by horrific battle sequences, in which the camera is placed within mere inches of the death and destruction, the film manages to transcend its educational remit by its relentless focus on the human cost of war. Almost every episode opens with testimony from surviving members of Easy Company (none of whom are identified until the end of the series), which further strengthens the emphasis which BAND OF BROTHERS - book and film - places on the bonds which drew them together in times of conflict. And, because it's a true story, there's no telling from one episode to the next which of the 'characters' will live or die, which makes it all the more potent and visceral.      The entire production represents quality writ large: Beautifully filmed on various European locations (including the UK and Austria), the movie is noble without being the least bit pompous or austere, and it manages to humanize a large cast of essential characters with small touches of humanity and humor, all of which serves to heighten the sense of terror as they descend into the maelstrom of conflict. The first - and longest - episode is deceptively staid, featuring David Schwimmer (a long way from TV's 'Friends') as the bullying, cowardly commanding officer Herbert Sobel, whose tyrannical methods nevertheless shaped Easy Company into a fighting force which eventually cut a swathe through the heart of occupied Europe. Brit actor Damian Lewis takes the spotlight thereafter as Easy Company's most respected platoon leader, Richard Winters, with Ron Livingston as his right hand man, Lewis Nixon. Other standout performances in a flawless cast include Matthew Settle as battle-hardened platoon leader Ronald Speirs whose wartime career was distinguished by numerous acts of bravery (fuelled by a unique - if morbid - personal philosophy), Shane Taylor as company medic Eugene Roe, Neal McDonough as 2nd lieutenant 'Buck' Compton (laid low by his horrific combat experiences), and Donnie Wahlberg as 1st sergeant C. Carwood Lipton, who maintained the morale of his fellow soldiers, even when the odds seemed stacked against them.     Every episode has its merits, but stand-outs include David Leland's 'Bastogne' (ep. 6), which recounts the horrendous circumstances surrounding Easy Company's involvement in the Battle of the Bulge, and David Frankel's 'Why We Fight' (ep. 9), in which the full horror of the Nazi regime is uncovered in a German forest. Additionally, the closing moments of chapter 10 ('Points', directed by Mikael Salomon) are truly heartbreaking.    Like the movie itself, HBO's region 1 DVD is magnificent. Housed in a beautifully embossed metal case, all ten episodes are spreadacross five discs (running a total of 624m 23s). Crucially, each disc contains biographical information on the soldiers represented in every episode, which allows the viewer to keep track of an extensive array of characters, and there's a useful glossary, map and timeline of Easy Company's advance across Europe. Perhaps the number of chapters per episode could have been doubled (as it stands, there are six for each instalment), but that's a minor glitch in an otherwise exemplary presentation. The sixth disc in HBO's package contains a fascinating, feature length documentary on the real members of Easy Company (essential viewing), and a series of video diaries by actor Ron Livingston of the boot camp to which many of the cast were subjected in preparation for filming, during which the actors seem to have cultivated the same bonds of friendship experienced by real soldiers in combat situations.     It's doubtful that a more fitting tribute to the men of Easy Company could have been devised than BAND OF BROTHERS, a truly remarkable experience, given the Rolls Royce treatment on DVD. By turns engrossing, provocative and deeply, profoundly moving, it stands as a testament to those who fought and died for our freedoms, almost a lifetime ago.
B000060MWU|5.0|Pigeon-holing Lynch as a noir director is perhaps a mistake, given the cramped definition many want to hang on the genre.  But with Lynch, you have a talented director showing just what is possible. (Polanski did the same with Chinatown.)  But with Lynch lines are blurred as image, dream, and story converge, and then flip and twist in unexpected ways, assisted by the director's use of both wondrous and disturbing imagery. To add to the layering is one of the best soundtracks for a movie I've heard in some time. Thematically each song (Lou Reed, Smashing Pumpkins, David Bowie, others) plugs into the movie, with all of its twists and turns. Partricia Arquette turns in a superb performance as the femme fatale(s). Her audition for Mr. Eddie to the crunching sound of Marilyn Manson's &quot;I Put a Spell on You&quot; is one of those scenes that burns into the mind as an unforgettable and dark tableu rather than as a piece of film. Arquette's moment, which is mostly visual, is as effective as Jane Greer's appearance in &quot;Out of the Past&quot;, but more dangerous since the stakes are, if possible, higher: a man's mind and soul as opposed to simply his life. She is the object of obsession, she is archetype, and she is, as she tells her lover, unobtainable. Indeed. But she makes for one gorgeous nightmare.<br />Lost Highway may, given time, be viewed as the perfect distillation of Lynch's vision. (And I'm a big fan of Blue Velvet.) It is certainly one of the darkest rides into the American night.  Though the journey is a psychological one, Pullman's (Fred's) electrocution death at the end pulls all the dark threads, internal and external, together.
078062999X|5.0|Elegant and artful without going over the top. Obvious care in adapting the play into a movie is evident throughout the creative process. Amazing cast with Jack Lemmon and Robin Williams among others included. Terrific, totally successful effort that looks all the better when compared to Mel Gibson's strange 1990 version of Hamlet. A must buy!
B00005JKZV|4.0|I love these adaptations of LOTR, and they are very well done. The acting and direction is all superb. Ian McKellon shines once again as Gandalf the White. The effects department has both the Balrog and Gollum pegged dead on, and the Ents are at least valiant effort - I'm sure all readers have them pictured differently.<br />Many \\"changes\\" form the book are necessary in a film version to compress time and to show things that cannot obviously be read. One example is the removal of the highly entertaining time Pippin and Merry spend with the Ents. Instead, it is replaced with a hasty attack on Isengard. Another example: we see Aragorn being uncertain of his destiny, doubtful, etc. in the movie when all readers know that by the time the books begin, he is quite sure of it and has planned it (with Gandalf's aid) for years. Some would call this an \\"existentialist reading\\" of his character, showing a depth that we don't see in the book, but which can be gotten from the appendix of ROTK.<br />I was irritated with what they did to Faramir's character, making him a miniature Boromir as well as the partial reduction of Gimli to comic relief duty. The first is an example of a large departure (Faramir's character is practically opposite of Boromir's), the second a small one; neither was required by the film medium. These gratuitous changes represent bad choices by the writers and directors who are often tempted to wander from the original. However \\"not all who wander are lost\\", and these changes do not detract greatly from the movie as a movie and should still be enjoyable by Tolkien fans.
0399215980|5.0|As a early childhood speech pathologist and special education teacher, I love this Eric Carle book.  It allows the children to \\"tell the story\\" and provides a great foundation to discuss friendships.  We read it every year in my classroom.
6305897786|1.0|This is the second Roman Polanski film I've watched which had a good beginning, extremely good plot development and then, NO ENDING!  What a let-down!  As other reviewers have said, &quot;The Girl&quot; is never explained, &amp; neither is whatever is supposed to be going on when the camera zooms in on her eyes.  Her behavior at the end of the film is never explained.  The clean sweep where Frank Langella re-enters the film shows absolutely no thought or creativity.  The elderly twin book-dealers disappear but, again, no explanation.  And then that ridiculous finale which comes out of nowhere!  Johnny Depp is totally wasted in this film.  His character is never developed in a direction which would make the ending make sense.  No more Roman Polanski movies for me until he hires someone who knows how to create  satisfying endings to good stories!
B00008AWOD|5.0|I'm a Placebo fan since 2000, when I heard Without you I'm nothing and was instantly hooked.<BR>Although I liked WYIN, I thought that Black market was their best. So my expectations were really high.<br />The first time I heard this CD, I was a little disappointed. I didn't expect album to open with instrumental, I didn't expect 'I-need-you' love songs and I didn't expect the piano closer (my girlfriend almost thought it was a Nick Cave's music! :) ). When you -expect- something, the thing usually goes the way you didn't expect.<BR>However, the album is excellent and that was expected and proven! This was the first Placebo CD where I had to give album a try (I don't count their debut, as I don't quite like it). That's because the songs are now much more sophisticated and takes time to fully understand or appreciate them, unlike their earlier pure energy, instant-hooker stuff. The pure-energy rocks, of course, but this adds more depth. And oh yes, many of the songs are heavily layered - which means loads of sounds and electronica! I didn't even dare yet to hear it on the headphones. :)<br />I LOVE this album as a whole and my favourites so far are: English summer rain, This picture,  Sleeping with ghosts, Something rotten, Special needs, Centrefolds.<BR>One side note - I really think they should've used that ending part of Special Needs as another song. It's just amazing! I was sad when I saw that was the same song. Sniff.. <br />Every Placebo (or electro-rock) fan -must- have this CD. Some of the best Placebo songs ever are here and it is also their most mature and emotional record to date.<br />P.S. Their concert in Serbia was just AWESOME! The crowd, the group - we all had some memorable time together! Thank you guys!
B000099T2L|3.0|I like a few of the songs, but I have to express how disappointed I am in her image lately.  I never have liked her sense of fashion or singing style, but at least when she was a part of Destiny's Child she wore some clothes. I am so, so sad to see her come of age like this!  Taking off one's clothes does not make one a woman! She was already pretty before she decided to become another commercial statistic. And to think she actually used to talk about not showing too much skin..now all you see is her using Jay-Z as a pole to dance on with her behind hanging out of everything.  The industry sure does change the values and morals of the young girls who enter it.  Yuck! What's up with that? It's so contrived and unnecessary.   Save the skins for the bedroom and focus on the talent girl!
B00009V7RF|5.0|Not only do I recommend \\"Elephunk,\\" but \\"Bridging the Gap\\" and \\"Behind the Front!\\"  I own all three and I have to say that BEP just keeps getting better and better.  If a person just listened to what they have to say, they may find the BEP worth listening to.  They are not your average, \\"shoot em up...where's my b*tches\\" type rappers.  They rap about life, the world and what's happening in it.  I just wish there were more rappers of substance these days, I'm just tired of the constant influx of \\"gangsta\\" and \\"ho's\\" and appreciate BEP for what they stand for.  Give them a try, you may be pleasantly surprised! I know it is a constant item in my cd player and my car and my mp3 player!<br />A faithful fan and listener of BEP (forever)
B000059XVS|5.0|For me to say that \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" is a masterpiece is like saying water is good. It should be common knowledge. In fact there's no need at all to make that statement. I'm not telling you anything you don't already know. Actually there's nothing I could say about this movie that hasn't been said 100 times before. I can't offer anything new or insightful. I can merely join the hopefully (?) hundreds and upon hundreds of people who love this movie.<br /> Released in 1962 and directed by David Lean, the man many people think of as the master of the epic through such films as \\"Doctor Zhivago\\" and \\"Bridge on the River Kwai\\" (Which also won \\"Best Picture\\") \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" is perhaps Lean's most popular and influential film. It is a piece of great story telling. And to think this was one of Peter O' Toole's first roles (In the credits it states \\"introducing\\" which usualy means an actor\actress first film. But if you go on IMDB.com it states it was his third movie.). It is a tour-de-force performance. Truly amazing and it honestly should have gotten him the Oscar. It's a shame he's never won, except for the special Oscar that he was awarded.<br /> \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" is based on actually writings of T.E. Lawrence. The screenplay by Robert Bolt abd Michael Wilson does in fact remain truthful too many moments. Which is unusualy for a Hollywood movie.<br /> Also part of this all-star cast is Alec Guinnes, Anthony Quinn, Omar Sharif, Jose Ferrer, & Claude Rains.<br /> Like I said before I really can't offer anything new to say but, just please make an attempt too see this film if you haven't. It will turn out to be a worthwhile experience. This is one of the greatest films of all-time. Nominated for 10 Academy Awards the movie won 7.<br /> Bottom-line: One of the greatest films of all-time. And one of many masterpieces to come from director David Lean.
B00001NFCY|4.0|In contrast to &lt;My Own Prison&gt;, Creed's second album, &lt;Human Clay&gt;, is not as uniformly strong.  But its highlights come close to eclipsing the genius of their former album.  Among these I would place: &quot;Wrong Way&quot;, &quot;Beautiful&quot;, &quot;Wash Away those Years,&quot; and (yes I know its overplayed but) &quot;Higher&quot;.  The cd bonus track &quot;Arms Wide Open (remix)&quot; is nice surprise and crushes the radio version like a grape....  proof that orchestral sounds are not a problem for those whose masculinity is secure.<br />As an album from start to finish, however, &lt;Human Clay&gt; is not quite as satisfying a listen as &lt;My Own Prison&gt;.  Notable low points for me are &quot;Say I&quot; and &quot;Never Die&quot;.  Still... well worth the time and money for one of the world's greatest bands.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina Aguilera finally shed the teenpop skin that she had formed when she came out with &quot;Genie In A Bottle&quot; with this album. Not only is her look more edgy, but her vocals are more powerful. Her voice absolutely shines on the ballads, sending chills up and down your spine. She has definitely grown up, and this album proves it.
B000069HKH|5.0|Although it is probably sacriledge to say so, I am convinced this is Bruce's best.  More creative than ever, more variety, more &quot;world music&quot; sounds.  The only track that I consider filler-esque is: &quot;Let's be friends&quot;, but only because its laid next to 14 other tracks of complete genius.  He and the E-street band have lost nothing with age.<br />For a band known for big sound, this album showcases some of their biggest ever (e.g., &quot;Lonesome Day&quot;, &quot;Countin' on a Miracle&quot;, &quot;Waitin' on a Sunny Day&quot;, &quot;Empty Sky&quot;, and of course &quot;The Rising&quot;).  But what sets this album apart from a lot of their records is the quiet places and small sounds: &quot;Nothing Man&quot;, &quot;Your Missing&quot;, and &quot;Paradise&quot;.<br />When 9-11 fades into a distant memory, tracks like &quot;Into the Fire&quot;, &quot;Your Missing&quot;, &quot;The Rising&quot;, and &quot;My City of Ruins&quot; may grow tired and trite--in the meantime (for the next 1000 years or so), they will continue to bring tears to all but the hardest of hearts.<br />If your a Springsteen fan, then you already have the album.  If you're not,  don't be embarrassed to make this one your first of his.

0060254920|5.0|My first enounter with this book was actually on a VHS tape of Sendak favorites.  Therein, Peter Schickele (aka. P.D.Q. Bach) was narrating (also wrote the music, BTW) this story, in addition to \\"In the Night Kitchen\\".  He reads it so rhythmically and so musically that it is an absolute joy.<br />Ever since, I always try to read it to my kids in my best Schickele imitation voice...  and they love it.<br />Surely one of the best childrens' books ever written.  (PS: Although nothing can replace mom & dad reading to their kids, buy the Sendak collection video too...)
B00001OH7P|5.0|It was a cold February evening in South London in 1972. I was a skinny 19-year-old, employed by my grandfather to collect the empties in his jazz and blues club. I had a call to deliver drinks backstage to the band. On arrival with a tray of brown ale, I was met by a bloke in army combats and wrestling boots. &quot;Thanks mate&quot; he said, taking the tray. I did my usual &quot;Any chance of an autograph?&quot;, and offered him a slightly soggy beermat and biro. he obliged, signing &quot;Rock on, Ziggy Stardust&quot;. I thought his name was David something. No matter.<br />The band took to the stage and played most of the &quot;Ziggy&quot; album to a crowd of around 50 youths, who witnessed the first ever public performance of Bowie as Ziggy. I think we all went out and bought the album. In the thirty-plus years since, the hairs go up on the back of my neck every time I hear Mick's opening riff.<br />If you don't have this album, buy it now. It stands as the pinnacle of glam-rock, and launched thousands of imitators (my brother and I included, for a short while).<br />That autographed beermat? I threw it a way a few months later - bit of a shame, in retrospect.
0066620996|5.0|This book has come highly recommended by several of my colleagues. I thoroughly enjoyed Built to Last, so I was looking forward to this book as well, and I was not disappointed. Mr. Collins has another winner on his hands.<br />A key message in this excellent management treatise is that true leaders build organizations that will last long after they are gone. They put excellent people together first and then figure out what the company will do. If the company already exists, they put the right people in the right jobs and then make sure that the company is headed in the right direction.<br />This is right in keeping with what I have been suggesting to those attending my Ethics as a Business Process seminars. We need to make sure we are building human resources and processes for the long term and not be focused on the short term (quarterly) results. Focus on those short term results forces managers to make incorrect decisions for the STAKEHOLDERS.<br />Another key point is that we need to account for the stakeholders not just the stockholders. When we are concerned about all those in our business chain, we do not make decisions that make only one group happy at the expense of others. So customers, employees, stockholders, and those in proximity to our physical plants and services must be taken into account as well.<br />Collins presents the &quot;Hedgehog Concept&quot; and the three circles as a model to make his points. One circle is &quot;What you are deeply passionate about.&quot; A second circle is &quot;What drives your economic engine.&quot; The third circle is &quot;What you can be the best in the world at.&quot; The intersection of the three circles is where we need to spend our time and energy. The Great Companies are more like hedgehogs--they know one big but simple thing and they stick to it, at all costs. They aren't the flashy technology companies, they are the tried and true long term companies that keep producing sustained great results.<br />Collins also presents the concept of the Level 5 leader. Level 1 are highly capable individuals, level 2 are contributing team members, level 3 are competent managers, level 4 are effective leaders. And then there is the level 5 executive or leader who builds enduring greatness through a paradoxical blend of personal humility and professional will. Level 5 leadership is not just about humility and modesty; it is equally about ferocious resolve, and almost stoic determination to do whatever needs to be done to make the company great. Level 5 leaders are fanatically driven, infected with an incurable need to produce results, and they work at the intersection of the three circles.<br />The book is documented with the Collins trademark studies, surveys, and interviews. He gives us a periodic view of how his research team argued over and hashed out the details which resulted in this excellent book. And the surprise? The surprise is that this is not a follow on to Built to Last but rather it is best positioned as a prequel to that book. If you haven't read Built to Last, read Good to Great first and then read Built to Last. Both are excellent and by reading them in the suggested order, the puzzle pieces will simply fall together. Definitely a five out of five on my scale.also presents the concept of the Level 5 leader.

B0000AI44Q|5.0|I bought tickets to Neil's latest concert before I knew about the Greendale concept album.  Like many I suppose, I went searching for the album so I would have an idea about the songs Neil was going to play.  Not for sale till August.  I thought that was a new one.  Someone is hawking an album that even wasn't for sale yet.  Next, I read those scathing reviews saying concert just sucked.  Neil has never gotten that much critical acclaim, but I must admit I was a little worried.  Nonetheless, I showed up at Camden NJ with an open mind.  Boy, was I blown away.  The music was awesome and the Horse and Neil were having a blast.  I also appreciated the genius of playing music no one has ever heard before.  Rather than sampling it own my own crappy stereo, I got to hear it live.  No doubt that I love this album much better cause I heard it first live.  As far as the concept part of the album, it makes some sense but there are some definite plot holes (Why did Jeb kill Carmichael? And how lead to Bad Media and Killing Mother Earth?).  The DVD that accompanies the album helps clear up a lot of the confusion but in the end if you are looking for the meaning of life from this CD you are going to be disappointed.   <br />I love watching Neil perform solo but this album definitely needs Crazy Horse and it would have been better if they would have shown a live performance with Crazy Horse (however I feel a little bad complaining about something that was free and very enjoyable to watch.).    To summarize,  if you love Neil with Crazy Horse you will love this album and don't let those jerks who write reviews for a living tell you otherwise. <br /> Neil, it is time to get back to the Country.
B00005JMD3|3.0|Jackson, Farrell, and the others make this a watchable movie.. They add depth to a shallow story-Now a shallow story in an action film is not in and of itself a bad thing. SWAT had tremendous potential. Jackson is commanding and eminently watchable, Farrell has enough charisma that you could watch him talk on the phone for an hour and a half (wait-I have watched him on the phone for an hour and a half)...The rest of the cast is pretty good for mostly flat characters in a typical action movie. <br />What goes wrong here is very screwy direction, a painfully long and dull \\"training\\" session, and an idiotic fist fight in the dark which you cant see and dont care about, and already know the outcome. Farrell's \\"badboy\\" character is never developed and never does anything bad, his ex(?) girlfriend is introduced and one of many subplots is left dangling (not that you care). This is a messed up movie...for a B-action flick, and to watch Farrell charm the world, and Jackson as a cardboard hero-it is fun-but both actors deserve so much more then they have been given here or in other movies they have done of late.
1577311523|5.0|Tolle give the tools to enter into the eternal--NOW, where there is no time. You will find that the &quot;Presence&quot; is the Eternal Creator and His wonderful Love for you, His creation. Forget religion that tries to put God in a box.

0345403959|5.0|I always like Belegarath from his sense of dry humor to his ability to tell great stories. Well this book was his greatest of all his stories and helped fill in alot of gaps which where left out previous to Pawn of Prophecy. I hope Eddings writes Beldin the Hunchbacked or something like that I think that would be the best individual personal history story ever. I would like to see from other people who write reviews after me name a Sorcerer they would like to have a book written after.
1577311523|5.0|This book is great because it emphasizes the POWER of the present moment.  It shows you how to stay in the present moment by letting go of the past.  I learned how to make the MOST of the present moment and completely master my thinking and feelings in another book called OPTIMAL THINKING--HOW TO BE YOUR BEST SELF by Dr. Rosalene Glickman.  Optimal Thinking is the best book I have ever read and this book comes second.
B000002J0B|5.0|While every single other album by Led Zeppelin has at least one song that isn't exactly great, this one is an exception. I can listen to it all the way through in any mood and it's still a great experience.  Sure, there's nothing on here as great as &quot;Stairway to Heaven,&quot; but all the songs are still of 5-star quality. Each one is a journey in itself; there's no two songs that have the same sort of feel and are played in the same style. While some of their other stuff sounds a bit dated, this album sounds like it could have been made several years ago.<br />Reccomended for any fan of rock music, or music in general. If you're new to Led Zeppelin, start with Zoso or How the West Was Won. Make this one of the first albums you buy, though!
B00009V7T2|5.0|This is without a doubt going to be the best album of 2003.  Every single song on this masterpiece is amazing, transitioning and blending together perfectly to create a modern work of art.  The musicianship is apparent in all aspects of this record, never ceasing to take any breath away.  Based on the life of the band's long time friend Julio Venegas, De-loused is a concept story that is nothing short of astounding. If you don't have it and/or you fully appreciate life and mind-opening music I suggest you order this NOW.
B00008DDXC|1.0|Okay, this movie was a huge disappointment.  I'm a fan of the books, and I thought the first movie did a decent job of modifying one for the big screen.  But this...ugh.  The child stars, rather than improving, have gotten much, much worse.  The kid who plays Ron has the same horrid facial expression for the entire film.  Daniel Radcliffe couldn't act his way out of a paper bag.  And Hermione, strange as this sounds, is too pretty TOO SOON.  And Malfoy has an insufferable lisp.  Why?  Unfortunately, the kids' contracts aren't up 'til the third film, so they'll just have to work around that.  The adult class is terribly talented, but were reduced to attractive props.  Rickman was sorely underused; all he does is whimper and whine throughout the movie.  And then they took so many liberties with the plot!  Was that drawn-out Quidditch match really all that entertaining?  No.  And did the Whomping Willow look like it was made of play-doh to anyone else?  All in all, this movie failed miserably to capture the spirit of the book.  It couldn't even get the fundamentals down: believable characters, plot translation...so how were they confident that they could tweak the story and still have a decent book-to-film title to offer fans?  Highly disappointing.  I look forward to the third film only because it has a different director.  Hopefully he'll make a difference (although already I fear one of the main characters was miscast).
B00009XITP|5.0|I loved this movie. It is a movie that any age can watch and not be offended by scenes or language. <BR>Colin Firth is my all-time favorite actor, and he was especially adorable in this movie. I have collected several of his movies but this is my favorite. I hope he will do more of a similar type because my teen-age grandaughters also love him.<BR>Amanda did a terrific job in her character. She is cute, and has a very &quot;sweet, fresh, clean&quot; look.<BR>Kelly Preston is as pretty and talented as ever.<br />I would strongly recommend &quot;What a Girl Wants&quot; to anyone who wants to sit back, relax and really not want to have to endure vulgarity and promiscuity. I would give it 10 stars if possible!
B00005JKQZ|5.0|A Beautiful Mind is everything a movie should be.  It's plot is nearly flawless.  The cinematography fits perfectly with the film's mood.  The acting is great.  And it warrants many additional viewings, even after the plot twist is revealed after the first viewing.  I've never been a big fan of Russell Crowe, but he is great in this role.  You'll find your self going back again and again trying to pick apart the details that you have missed before.  I couldn't recommend this more.
B0000AXE8I|3.0|I have to be honest here.  I had to see this movie twice, NOT because I liked it, but because the first time I fell asleep in the theater, My girlfriend woke me up a few times, when she thought something was good (she only woke me up like 2 times).<BR>When I saw it the second time I went to the IMAX theater, to see it again (but for the first time, follow me) I didn't like the movie at all.  But give *** stars because The special effects were good (nothing compared to LORD OF THE RINGS), I give credit to the creators of the movie.  This is one of those movies you go watch NOT because you really like it, but because for some reason People try to get you involved...
B00005JM1F|5.0|This is a great movie. Bag full of laughs. Movie for teenagers and older.
B00005JKZV|5.0|I don't like when people say that thsi movie is better than the first or that they wish that the third movie would be better than the first two. Isn't it just one story? one movie as the director says it...<BR>This continuation of the movie is bigger and darker, I can't find words to express the emotion I get from watching these movies.  I just CAN'T wait to see the end of the story (Return of the king). I guess these movies will be around for decades. They're the best movies on the universe.  These movies have changed my life. The music score is the most fascinating one I have heard in my life and the special effects are magnificent.<BR>I guess I fell sad just like everybody else: After the December 2003, what next?
B00005JKZV|5.0|I haven't read the books myself so my review is based on strictly the movie itself...  I also read a few reviews and know about the deviations from the book...<br />I give it five stars because of Gollum basically and just the sheer fact that this movie is being made and the organization, it takes to film in the locations with so many extras and have the special effects this movie has, and the CGI involved and the balancing of the book and screenplay.... just thinking about what it took to make three movies at the same time just boggles the mind, and to pull it off with this much of a seemless job to me is amazing.<br />But back to Gollum, not only is he amazing as a CGI charater, in that he works and looks flawlessly within the scenes. You forget he's totally computer generated and just pay attention to the acting of  Andy Serkis.... truelly a great job on the character.<br />I think the flow of the movie is better suited when seen with all three movies, as this seemed to be part of a trilogy, rather than a \\"whole\\" movie by itself.... besides this minor quibble... I am greatful to Peter Jackson in bringing this amazing world of middle earth to film.... Bravo!!.
0316666343|5.0|Though I seldom read fiction, and I'd heard the hype about this book I didn't believe, it was the only thing that looked at all good at a small airport bookstore when I needed some in-flight reading.  I was pleasantly surprised by this wonderful book, and recommend it highly.
B00005JKZV|5.0|The Two Towers, Peter Jackson's second of three movies based on J.R.R. Tolkien's novel The Lord of the Rings, isn't a sequel to The Fellowship of the Ring.  Instead, it is the continuation of a single storyline that, like its literary source, was broken up in three parts for manageability.  (Tolkien never envisioned his tale of the War of the Ring to be a \\"trilogy\\" of related books.  It is, in fact, a one-book narrative that publishers wisely broke up into three volumes for economic and practical reasons.)<br />With this structural concept in mind, Jackson doesn't resort to a Cate Blanchett-narrated summary of The Fellowship of the Rings to bring viewers up to date.  Instead the director takes up the plot where Fellowship left off, with Hobbits Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) and Samwise Gamgee (Sean Astin) making their way to the evil kingdom of Mordor, where they must climb Mount Doom and destroy Lord Sauron's powerful Ring.<br />Lost and tired, Frodo and Sam are wandering in the dangerous regions just outside Mordor when they are ambushed by Gollum (Andy Serkis), a twisted and tormented creature that had once been a Hobbit-like creature until, centuries ago, he found the One Ring.  Enslaved and transformed by the Ring's power, Gollum lives only for the possession of \\"the precious.\\"  After a brief scuffle with Frodo and Sam, Gollum is apparently tamed and reluctantly agrees to take the two Hobbits to the Black Gate of Mordor.<br />Meanwhile, the rest of the now broken Fellowship follow separate paths.  Frodo and Sam's fellow Hobbits Merry and Pippin (Billy Boyd, Dominic Monaghan) have been captured by Uruk-Hai who serve the traitorous wizard Saruman (Christopher Lee).  They are being taken to Isengard, where Saruman has built Orthanc, one of the titular Two Towers (the other being Sauron's Barad-Dur in Mordor).  There, the evil White Wizard hopes to get his hands on the One Ring.  Pippin and Merry are seemingly doomed unless Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), the Elf Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) can catch up to their captors and rescue them.<br />Of course, events intervene and things become far more complicated as the War of the Ring begins.  Saruman strikes first at the kingdom of Rohan from without and from within.  His armies of Orcs and Wild Men attack villages in a violent rampage of sword, wargs and fire.  Meanwhile, King Theoden  (Bernard Hill) has been weakened by Saruman with the aid of Grima Wormtongue (Brad Dourif); the once powerful warrior king is a half dead shell of a man who can barely lift his head while sitting on his throne.<br />But all is not lost, for Gandalf (Ian McKellen), thought to have perished during his battle with the Balrog in the mines of Moria, has returned, and although there will still be many challenges for the Fellowship to overcome, hope still lives on in Middle Earth.<br />Jackson, along with co-writers Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens and Stephen Sinclair, did take creative liberties with Tolkien's established storyline, but not to the film's detriment.  Now that the expository material has been dealt with in The Fellowship of the Ring, the movie seems less ponderous and a bit more action oriented.  The introduction of Rohan's shield-maiden Eowyn (Miranda Otto) adds poignancy to the romantic subplot of Aragorn and Arwen (Liv Tyler), and we clearly see the effects of the Ring's power on Frodo.<br />Also notable are the special effects, particularly the CGI renderings of Gollum. Taking their cue from actor Serkis' amazing performance, the computer artists create a totally believable digital character.  Imagine a malignant and insane Dobby from Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets and multiply that image by a factor of 100, and you have Gollum.  The result is a totally believable character with all the shadings of a well-written role.<br />The Helm's Deep battle sequence that is the films effects centerpiece is equally impressive and rivals anything the effects wizards atLucasfilm have created for the Star Wars prequels.<br />The New Line Home Entertainment DVD (in both Wide Screen and pan and scan formats) contains the original theatrical version (the Extended Edition is due in November 2003), with English audio tracks in Dolby Digital EX 5.1 Surround Sound and Stereo Surround Sound, English subtitles and closed captions, and Spanish subtitles.

B00009MGQL|4.0|I really hope Jeff realizes that his producer/mixer is killing Jeff's work. What in the hell was he thinking when mixing track #8. Arguably one of the strongest tracks on the album completely killed because some Yahoo decides that fading the treble in and out on the drums and cymbals was a good idea... Did the producers' 5 year old kid sneak into the studio and mess with the controls? That said, the more I listen to the album, the more I like it. It is very complex and needs to be listened to multiple times to be fully appreciated, but the cutesy mix still has me ticked off. I am very happy that there are fewer B.S. electronic drum loops on this album vs. his other recent releases... Who Else is still the best of the last 3, with this release coming in 2nd. I'm still trying to figure out what happened with YHIC...
B00005JKC3|5.0|The Hulk is a great film, but it definitely won't appeal to everyone.  The message that Ang Lee tried to deliver, repressed rage being a quality in all of us and the dangers of it being released, was missed by those seeking a 2 hour smash-athon.  Ang Lee's painstaking attempt at evoking pity for the Hulk, evidenced by aptly placed close-ups of the Hulk's face displaying various emotions OTHER than anger, is clearly lost by most of the audience.  The film is dark and takes some time to develop.  But, your patience is well rewarded by a \\"comic-book\\" movie that has real emotional depth and artistic flair.
B00004UEDR|5.0|Most people haven't seen this movie, which is a shame, since it's one of Sandra Bullock's best movies, and also features Viggo Mortensen (of Lord of the Rings), who is almost unrecognizable, but definitely hot, as baseball player Eddie. The other actors are wonderful too, even the minor characters shine. This movie has some great moments of humor, but also delivers some great life lessons. It's also interesting to see Sandra Bullock do drama, which she pulls off wonderfully. I would highly recommend this film to everybody.
B00003CXDU|4.0|There are so many bad Sci-Fi films out there producers may want to take note and think about making more Sci-Fi spoofs. They could definitely learn from Galaxy Quest (GQ) which takes true-life scenarios (Sci-Fi shows, actors, fans, & conventions) and create a wonderfully funny movie. What makes GQ succeed are excellent writing, unique storyline, great special effects, and wonderful casting. <br />Six members of a fading Sci-Fi show (a la Star Trek) are relegated to making public appearances and signing autographs at popular conventions. Faced with no careers and never ending lines of GQ maniacs, they are simply playing out all they have left. Lo & behold, a group of actual aliens ask the Captain & crew for their help in battling an evil general bent on their extermination. <br />What results is a fine example of comedy acting from those we never expected, namely Sigourney Weaver and Alan Rickman. Tim Allen, who plays the Captain, excels at comedy but I was surprised by both Weaver and Rickman's performance. In particular Rickman who plays a talented actor fallen into the typecast dust bin and forced to utter his famous line over and over. Was also impressed by Sam Rockwell playing a one episode cast member who has the unlikely role of being like one of the, Star Trek Red Shirts (expendables).  The aliens are also all well played with their intriguing accents and body gestures especially Enrico Colantoni and Missi Pyle.<br />I was blown away by the special effects from the visuals of space to the spaceships and the evil general Saris. I guess I was expecting something low budget. However, the strength of GQ comes from the writing and acting. Great lines delivered by great actors in a compelling story. Sci-Fi cliches abound and our familiarity makes them all the more hilarious: from the heroic womanizing Captain; the highly intelligent yet under-appreciated alien; and blonde but useless bombshell for the young lads. There is nothing cerebral here but knowing how difficult comedy can be, means that someone was using their brains when they crafted this very funny and uplifting gem.  Brilliant!
B00007H1Y2|4.0|I was fortuante enough to experience Cuba's music first hand this year.  On the island one understands how Ry Cooder fell under its spell.  This is no rehash of the ground covered with Buena Vista.  Perhaps a bit more Anglo, but it's fresh and lively and lovely.
B00004XONN|5.0|For those of you who read my Amnesiac review...), I wrote that although OK Computer is very good, it is not Radiohead's best as most say. That title should belong to this album which has become my favorite album, period, let alone Radiohead. Not a weak link on this album (though I have not gotten into\\"Motion Picture Soundtrack\\" at all).                                                                                                                               \\"Everything In It's Right Place\\" gives the album a strong opening, in credit mainly to the best vocals Thom gives in the entire album. It then moves on to \\"Kid A\\", which competes with \\"Idioteque\\" as best song on the album. Other highlight tracks include \\"Morning Bell\\", a rock-like structured and sounding electronic piece, and \\"The National Anthem\\" led by Colin Greenwood's continuous bass line and reckless jazz horns. Guitars as a main instrument can only be found on \\"Optimistic\\" and \\"-Dissapear Completely\\".                                                                                               <BR> One non-musical suggestion is to take a look at the artwork found in the booklet and a pamphlet found under the disc holder before or while listening to the album for the first time. It's haunting and abstract images will help you unsterstand how to approach the music and therefore making it more accesible. <BR> Radiohead really outdid themselves with this one and while mainstream listeners may not appreciate it's instrumental bridges and low-key tempo and feel, most music fans will definetley enjoy the nirvana that comes with the amazing climaxes, strange twists and turns, and the endless new noises that you will hear in each listen. The most amazing aspect of this album is the somewhat plucky, sarcastic attitude that you can feel in it, but the way that that is just another factor that makes this album feel more meaningful than OK Computer, though not as accsessible.
B000089RVX|5.0|Evanescence has to be one of the best new bands to hit the market in recent years.  Its combination of great melodies, haunting lyrics and a female lead singer with an unbelieveable voice give it something to separate itself from other rock bands like it.  I would recommend them to Tori Amos, P.O.D, linkin Park, Metallica, or just rock fans.  Buy this album, you won't be disappointed.
B000001ESN|5.0|Pretty much every song on here is killer. If you want to start somewhere as a beginner Rush fan, this album along with Moving Pictures are the best choices for first buys because of their accessibility. That said, this album along with MP is two of their best if not their best because of the quality.
0385504209|5.0|This book on it's very surface is an entertaining thriller, well thought out, and with complex characters. On top of all that there is a serious bit of history lurking about. The kind of history that you don't get to read about much, and the Catholic church wishes nobody knew about.<br />Presented as a mystery - the book may seem uncontroversial but it speaks of history, people and organizations that actually existed. It is also richly filled with symbolism.<br />Hidden amongst it's pages are tons of fun little secrets as well. There is a coded message on the front and back flap of the dustjackets. I won't reveal it - but here's a hint: look for letters that are slightly bolder. There are hidden anagrams (notably a character whose last name is an anagram of Baigent and who's first name is Leigh - referrings to the authors of Holy Blood Holy Grail). The fictitions publishing company of the main character is called Doubleknight - a reference to an old Knights templar crest. Fun stuff to discover.<br />I had loads of fun reading this book and couldn't put it down. Important lessons are imparted through the allegory of teh story that require some deeper inderstandings of the &quot;great mystery&quot; to work out - but please get this book and read it.
B000066NW0|1.0|This is a pop album, not rock. Deluded fans take note! I would call it humorous but it just annoys me. Can't sing, the voice is singing and beyond tuneful. <br />The songs are horrid and cringeful. Who would call a song sk8er boi with serious face? The lack of dignity is shocking. <br />I can't beleive someone would put a song as bad as 'naked' on an album.  And i'd be embarassed if 'mobile' was on my album. <br />Though I must praise Avril for starting the craze of long straight hair and tomboy clothing for teenage girls, it means I can wear my fairy clothes without embarassment. I love my fairy clothes.<br />A girl living opposite my house loves this album. She plays it loud sometimes. Pity me please.
B00009V7RF|4.0|Black Eyed Peas have produced an album sure to appeal to mainstream hip-hop audiences, with smooth beats and funky, jazzy instrumental riffs.  Lots of the songs are about dancing, funky music, romance, and generally having fun.  This is music for moving your body, and is better than most commercial hip-hop.  Let's get retarded is NOT about insulting people with mental impairments - it's about letting go and having fun, releasing one's unhealthy inhibitions and just acting naturally, like a \\"stupid\\" person who hasn't been culturally programmed otherwise might do.  The catchiest and most thoughtful song on this album is Where Is The Love, which seems slickly produced and aimed at radio & MTV play.  Hopefully people may learn something from the lyrics (such as that the \\"War On Terror\\" is actually being run by gangsters and terrorists, including people in the CIA, who helped arrange the 9/11/01 events).  Go out and buy this CD before Bush & The CIA ban it for the song which criticizes the fraudulent war on terror and mentions the CIA together with the bloods & crips and the KKK.

B000065V3H|5.0|Whoever went to high school will relate to this movie....especially if you did so in the 80's!  This movie was true to life back then and it's certainly still true to life now.  How far would you go to popular?  Well, this movie definetly shows how far some people would!!  It's funny, heart warming, and of course it ends as most 80's movies did....with the guy getting the girl!!
B0000A1RJI|5.0|First, I thought this was an awesome cd, the music takes you places. When listening to this cd I could close my eyes and see Captain Jack Sparrow swinging from a rope or Elizabeth seeing the undead crew for the first time. This is the only soundtrack that I have heard in which I can pinpoint exactly when the song came on in the movie. Even people who haven't seen the movie will appreciate this soundtrack. I have seen the movie four times and am so glad I can listen to it whenever I want since POTC has left the theatre in my hometown. I can watch the movie again and again in my head with out leaving my chair, or paying to get in to the theatre. It also works as great music to listen to while doing homework, or just surfing the web.<br />Now for the things that could be improved: There was not enough music! Last time I went to the movie, I payed close attention to the music and yes there were some parts where no music was being played, but there was definetly a big chunck of music missing. Also, when listening to this cd for the first time, parts of songs sounded so much like a track before the one I was on, I had to make sure it wasn't on repeat.<br />All in all, the music is fantastic, and I still give it 5 stars!
6305280762|5.0|This movie is the kind of film which was in vogue in Hollywood in the 1970s - the disaster film. Get a huge all-star cast, put them in the middle of a terrible disaster and watch them try to get out. This film is probably the ne plus ultra of the genre. Although it is certainly a special effects film, this movie says something about the way movies were made then as opposed to now. The filmmakers felt obliged to develop the plot and characters before blowing you away with special effects. The film starts off with a long opening credits sequence of a helicopter flying over the Northern California coastline towards San Francisco; John Williams' excellent theme music swirls and arches as the helicopter flies over cliffs and waves and rolling hills before reaching San Francisco and landing on the top of the 130-storey tower. The fire builds slowly, from an electrical short in a utility closet to a full-on blaze which envelops the entire building and threatens a party full of VIP's on the top floor. <br />What amazes me is how great the special effects are, nearly 30 years later, all done with models and without computers. Irwin Allen knew how to build tension up slowly and gracefully. He fills the screenplay with \\"little victories\\" such as rescuing a child before the climax. <br />This was one of Steve McQueen's last big movies. Well into his 50s at the time of this film, he exudes the quiet, competent macho, free of bravado or swagger, that characerized films stars of his era. Capt. Halloran is a quiet, competent everyday Joe, not particularly handsome or well-built, who simply goes out and achieves the impossible, without the sarcasm or self-conscious humor that action films have had since the 1980s. McQueen died in Mexico in 1980 while being treated for cancer. Paul Newman is great also. It's interesting to note that Hollywood in the 1970s felt that it could build an action film around 2 fifty-something stars without a lot of sex or nudity or profanity. <br />At the end of the film, Capt. Halloran gives a speech telling Doug Roberts (Paul Newman) that it's just impossible to fight a fire effectively in such a tall building. Then he gets in his car and drives away. The year of this film's release, 1974, was one year after the World Trade Center was dedicated (I know this because I worked in 5 WTC for many years). Although I hesitate to take moral lessons from Hollywood, clearly we don't know any more about preventing such disasters in tall buildings today than we did in the early 70s. <br />I saw this film twice upon its release as a 6 year old in 1974. It thrilled me then - it was the first big adult movie which I clearly remember. <br />All in all, a great and memorable film.
B000006NPY|5.0|I must be one of the very few Smashing Pumpkins fans who prefers Adore/Machina over earlier efforts such as Gish and Siamese Dream. Adore is the sound of a man (Corgan) at his creative peak, his most inspired. It was a blatant refusal of the popular music climate of the time. But then again, the Pumpkins are renowned for that- who would release a sprawling 28 song 2 cd album when all the market really called for was Siamese Dream part II?<br />This album emphasises keyboards, electronic drums and guitars used to compliment songs rather than dominate them. In fact the album shares more in common with such bands as The Cure than any of the Pumpkin's grunge peers. Gone are the self-loathing stadium filling rockers, replaced with toned down, sweet, soothing harmonies. The album has it's dark moments (Tear, Crestfallen, For Martha, Behold! The Night Mare), it's gorgeous little lullabies (To Shiela, Once Upon A Time), and other catchy, electronic drum-driven songs (Daphne Descends, Appels + Oranjes)...Not to mention (no Pumpkins album would be complete without) the radio-friendly songs such as Ava Adore and Perfect. <br />As an album, it flows perfectly. To my ear, there are no weak tracks at all (hence 5 stars). Not a dull moment to be heard. Some would refer to this as the beginning of the end for the Smashing Pumpkins, which is perhaps true COMMERCIALLY. However, for Billy's maturity and inspiration as a songwriter, it was just the start. If Billy has released this as a solo-album (after all, it was primarily HIS work) it would have fared better and been far more respected. Fans such as myself hope for a solo effort from Corgan resembling this one day. Zwan is okay, but Corgan is capable of so much more, as shown on this album.
B000001GRZ|5.0|The 6 cello sonatas are not as technical (i.e. dry) as, say, The Art of Fugue, yet they do not make for facile listening either. With this in mind, I would describe Fournier's interpretation as the most suave on record. If painting were used to locate the Bach/Fournier 6 cello sonatas in the spectrum of interpretations then this rendition comes the closest to impressionist. Then Rostropovich's would would be constructivist and Casals' would be expressionist.<br />So, in case you either want to temperate the harshness of this more technical work of Bach or like everything impressionist then Frounier's rendition is a must have.
B000068IEU|2.0|Back in 1972, the advertisment for this movie created a long line at our local drive in. The ad claimed to be so scary that to avoid fainting you had to keep repeating it's only a movie, it's only a movie. After it was over, we all felt cheated because the movie was not  scary and did not make  sense. Apparently, we saw an edited version back in '72. The new DVD has the restored version and lived up to it's orginal advertisement. I'm a fan of horror movies and not easily shocked but I had a hard time watching \\"Last House on the Left\\". The first part of the movie concerns the kidnapping, humiliation, tortue and brutal death of two teenage girls. The second part concerns the revenge exacted on the thugs who killed the girls. The brutality seems so real that it's difficult (for even jaded me) to be entertained. I'm giving it two stars because I can recognize it is well made but it's extremely difficult to watch; and being a gore hound/horror movie buff, that's saying alot.

B000060P79|1.0|what i am about to write is only my opinion. this review could be helpful if you choose it to be.<br />simple plan is the poppiest pop band that should be headlining with the likes of nsync or avril lavigne.they are an nsync with distortion on their guitars. from the 3 or 4 songs ive heard from them i can say is that all of this has been done before and its nothing new or exciting or different for that matter.<br />let me take for example the song, &quot;im just a kid&quot; yeah its a really catchy song but man grow up. youre like in your late 20's or something please sing about something more mature or different. youre not a kid! you are an adult! and all i here are these simple 4 chord progressions, i mean come on play some cool riffs on your guitar or something. dont just play power chords over and over. and his voice man i hear that same tone of voice in pop punk music everywhere. <BR>i just seriously dont see the big deal in this band. there are other more talented bands out there that should be recognized but theyre not simply because theyre not catchy enough or &quot;cute&quot; enough to the public eye. there are just so many darn kids listening to simple plan and good charlotte hooked on to these simple catchy lyrics that a 3rd grader could write.<BR>to simply put it....im just not a fan..but if your just looking to have fun with music and like repetetive lyrics than simple plan is for you!
0385512104|5.0|This is a brilliantly conceived, extraordinarily moving, and vividly written novel. The story is told by a fifteen year old autistic savant who is brilliant at math and logic. He resolves to find out who murdered a neighbor's dog and in the process discovers truths about himself and his world. He also uses the skills of Sherlock Holmes, his favorite detective, to unearth clues that the rest of us would overlook. The word &quot;novel&quot; originally meant new, and this original book is certainly that.
0440237688|4.0|I read this book along with my 8 year old son.  After spending the summer reading the 5th Harry Potter book, this little 180 page book gave us something more meaningful to reflect upon --i.e. how memories affect our lives.  My son cried in the end, but overall, he loved it.  He wanted the book to continue or to have a sequel.  We also loved the author's Number the Stars.
B00005JKZV|4.0|New Line has released a huge batch of defective discs with this film. On certain older DVD players (mostly SONY players, but occasionally others), \\"The Two Towers\\" will halt, pixellate and sometimes backtrack to a point approximately an hour and a half from the end when Gandalf begins his \\"fight for Middle Earth has yet to begin\\" speach at Ch. 51 of the disc. There is literally no way to tell whether your disc is defective simply by looking at the surface of the DVD.  Only by bringing it home and watching through Ch. 51 will you be able to tell whether you received a clean copy or a defective coaster. Please BEWARE when purchasing this disc.
B000062Y98|5.0|Simply an epic masterpiece.  The operatic neo-classical music on this album has a diamond finish and adamantine polished production.  The songs have a very hard and sharp reality edge: lyrical content is historical/non-fiction.  To me, the orchestral accompaniment seems perfectly logical for these epic pieces reflecting the history of mankind's plight; the orchestral arrangements are not at all overbearing.  The writing is incredible, creative, and always leaves you guessing; with one surprise after another.  I think Blind Gaurdian's first-class music rivals some 20th century masterpieces, maybe even a few by Gershwin.  Did I say that? Full-throttle Metal, honest vitality, and overwhelming passion! MAGNIFICENT!!! MAGNIFICENT!!!  MAGNIFICENT!!!
B0000AI44Q|5.0|I do not get excited about many new music releases these days, Neil Young being one exception.  Greendale is perhaps the best work that Neil and Crazy Horse has ever done.  The CD consists of 10 amazing new songs containing over 77 minutes of music and politics.  As if that were not enough, this set also includes a DVD of solo Neil live in Ireland performing the story of Greendale.  Double your pleasure double your fun, and what fun it is.  The story of Greendale and the Green family, Edith and Earl, Sun, Earth, Jed Green and the Devil brings a smile to this face.  Don't look for any hard rockers here though, just slow, steady grooves, just incredible.  Grandpa's Interview goes on for over 12 1/2 minutes but it still seems to end too soon, it is that good.  There is not one weak spot in the entire set. I cannot wait to see Neil and Crazy Horse perform Greendale live in September.  Needless to say, I highly recommend this latest release from Neil and Crazy Horse, in my opinion the best band around today.  Can I give it 10 stars?  Thanks Neil.
1402555989|5.0|Wonderful!!  Mark Haddon masterfully captured the logical mind behind the mask of an Asberger's sufferer, that we often cast aside as &quot;slow&quot;, instead of trying to understand.  By having the story presented through the eyes of Christopher, it allows you to slow down and think about things the way he does and see that he is anything but slow.  His logic clearly makes sense.  Tragically, it also makes very clear, the lack of ability to exhibit deep emotions.<br />I enjoyed the way Christopher viewed the differences in his relationships with his father, his neighbor, and strangers.  His boundaries were more steadfast than most children we see who are so quick to trust strangers.  By taking us through his memories and giving good examples, we get a &quot;map&quot; of how and why his mind works the way it does.  Thus, Christopher cared that the dog had been killed, simply because he liked dogs.  Innocent and logically brilliant!
0805062971|5.0|I HATE TO READ but this book changed my life. We're gonna go on vacation so my mom says \\"Pick out a book to read for the trip.\\" Well I had noticed that the movie Fight Club was based on a book by some guy named Chuck Palahniuk. So I get the book and I am just in shock. This book is AWESOME! There are so many differences between the book and the movie. The book, in my opinion, is A LOT better. I don't wanna spoil the book (auctually I do, but I won't) but one thing thats different is that Tyler makes soap out of Marla's mom. Also Joe (As in: I am Joe's flaring nostils) beats himself up in front of the manager of the hotel instead of his boss. <BR> From that fateful day forth I'm hooked on Palahniuk books. So if you know a teen that hates to read tell him one word PALAHNIUK (Paul-a-nick) or (Puh-law-nee-ack). Well maybe you should explain it a little more clearly but anyway \\"In a world of Sick Puppies, Palahniuk is Top Dog!\\"
B000022TSW|4.0|South Park:  Bigger, Longer and Uncut is surprisingly one of the most intelligent animated features to be released in a long time.  It manages to combine Disney-quality musical numbers, unbelievable strings of profanity (I still remember the feeling of utter shock while hearing Terrance and Phillip's tune when I first saw the movie in the theater), and a valuable moral (made obvious during the movie's first song when the kids sing \\"Off to the movies we will go, where we learn everything that we know, 'cause the movies teach us what our parents don't have time to say!\\") into a film that will either a. have you laughing uncontrollably or b.  offend you so much that you write your congressman in an attempt to ban the movie.  South Park:  Bigger, Longer and Uncut just proves how ingenious Trey Parker is- after all, who else could have visualized Satan having a gay relationship with a sex-crazed Saddam Hussein?  Or that \\"Barbra Streisand\\" could quite possibly be the most powerful curse word in the English language?  Bottom Line:  If you want to see an insanely funny, unbelievably profane movie that actually has a message to its madness, you can't go wrong with South Park:  Bigger, Longer and Uncut.  The only thing that kept my rating at a 4 for the DVD was the absence of special features.
