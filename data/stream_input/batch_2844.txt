B004GHNIRK|2.0|My favorite character was Eponine for sure, but I would've liked to read more of her.<br />It was so long it took me months to read it, I loved the 2012 movie so that's why I read the book, but it was nothing like the movie at all, so it wasn't really good...<br /><br />R.I.P. Eponine <3 :)
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I really like Collins writing style, she did a good job coming up with a story that hasn't been done to death a million times (as is so common in the literary world). The only think I didn't like is that the ending is a little predictable because she wrote the story in the first person. Generally speaking, the &#34;I&#34; of the story doesn't tell their story from the grave. Because of this, it was fairly easy to figure out how the story was going to turn out. If I had written the book, I would have written from an omniscient third person or switched perspectives throughout the story, that way it wouldn't be that predictable. I am looking forward to reading the other two books though :)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is really great for little kids. It is easy to learn how to play. The game is.fun and does not bore kids easily.
B00005TQKQ|5.0|seems to work OK
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This book gives an entire new way to look at the New Testament and also the Gnostic Gospels (although the author did not rely on them for the book).  As a kid I didn't learn in Sunday School or from church what the historical context was in Jesus' time.  Adding that perspective helps us see Jesus and his followers in an entirely new light.  I never could figure out why exactly Jesus was executed by the Romans.  Was it jealousy on the part of the Jewish religious leaders?  That seems to have been the narrative used throughout the last 2,000 years to indict Jews, causing unthinkable repercussions.<br /><br />Who was this person Jesus?  Was he God incarnate as proposed in John's gospel?  Or was he someone other than that, an enlightened one who nevertheless didn't suffer fools gladly or take a passive stance toward the crooked and greedy?  And wasn't he showing us how to live a life of integrity without fear?  I like that guy.
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|This was one of the lamest movies I've watched in a long time.  I do not recommend it. the end
B00915G6WQ|2.0|In Season 1 Dexter was a good guy, now 7 years later he seems kills anyone who gets in his way. Debra now joins in this too and is now a cop killer - killing Maria in the season finale to save her brother Dexter from being arrested. Dexter falls in love with a poisonist - even going as far to kill her father. I think it ran too long.  I used to like it, now it needs to end.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is great for passing time and sometimes frustrating because each level gets more difficult but it's still great fun!
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|I enjoy seeing how the rich people of England passed their time and bossed the servants around. Always waiting for more chapters to arrive.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is lots of fun but be very careful it can be very addictive. But you will enjoy it.
B000XR4OC0|1.0|I was so excited to get these shoes, but then the heels on both shoes tore after just a few wears. Amazon was great--they gave me a full refund. I'm going to buy a pair of Keds.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|I like anything by Nelson DeMille and the end was worth expending and expanding a little gray matter. I would recommend this book to anyone especially those, who like me, are in love with John Corey. I liked THE LION and THE LION KING even more, but this book will definitely keep you turning pages … into the night.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|If you enjoy good stories with a bit of mystery and action, sit back and enjoy this movie.<br /><br />This is a well told story that takes its time, the actors are good, the story and plot is nice, the effects are well done but do not overshadow the story.  This is a movie more for adults than tiny kids.  This movie does not spoon feed the audience every detail, the movie drops you into a situation and tells a story.<br /><br />On the actors... great job!  Some of the actors just weirded me out and I never quite knew what they were going to do.  Others were just solid performances.<br />On the effects... I loved the drones.  The way the movie portrayed them, I felt nervous when they were in a scene.<br />Overall..  this movie is head and shoulders above much of the utter crud that is out there.
B007ZXK08C|1.0|Enjoyed reading it but found the ending pathetically thin n abrupt! Don't think Gillian Flynn is my kind of author. I gave it one star and that is with alot of grace!
0345525558|5.0|I loved this story and was quickly drawn into the life of the main character.  It was a survival story of a girl who found an older foster lady who accepted her warts and all .  She learned so much about the language of flowers from her foster mother and this carried her through in unusual ways.  I loved the book so much that I hesitate to loan it out..
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Candid humor we can all relate to, so nice to hear a female comedy writer's story!  She has paved the way for future women comedians.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|The acting, cinematography, narrative structure and soundtrack all work very well.  As one of the Bonus materials says, it also helps humanize commonly shared mental health problems.  Terrific movie.
B00COHAUD4|2.0|There is a lot of stupid horror movies our there .... It was ok the end kinda of sucked ... Anyway . I believe unless the movie is REALLY REALLY BAD , you have to judge for yourself

B003M70O5O|5.0|Love the Sons of A!!! Love even more its Prime! Picture quality was great streamed it from my kindle fire with a HDMI cord!  Worked great!
1476733953|1.0|I recently went on vacation and was looking for a good book for the beach, and I bought this based on all the positive reviews.  This really is not worth all the hype.  The first chapter - which apparently is the original short story that started the compilation - is interesting and engaging.  And then it all goes downhill after that.  I didn't find any aspect of this really worthwhile - the characters have little depth, the plot barely qualifies as science fiction (except for the premise and setting), and the events that unfold are slow-paced and not even that interesting. Not worth the money.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|Yes, there are many many many great films out there.  There are films that most people would much rather watch, however Edgar Wright is just awesome.  Every film he's ever done has been great but this one is special.  This movie touches the hearts of video game nerds and plays on many pop-culture references.  Recommend watching this, over, and over, and over, and over, and over.....
B00555X8OA|5.0|If you like behavioural economics topics. Very clean and simple approach. Highly recommended to explore further how humans rationalize decisions.
B0051T46XM|4.0|Troll Hunter is nothing new, except for the troll part.  This handy-can style is nothing new, but once you add trolls into the mix, it's different.  The story takes many theories and folklore and incorporates them into a modern setting.  At times, I found this to be funny, but in a good way.  The intention behind this movie is for it to not be taken seriously, but they incorporate the serious tone to the movie to make it feel more organic.  This is a great flick.  I recommend purchasing, but if you want to give it a try first, you can view it on Netflix streaming at the time of this review.
B000TETM7Y|5.0|Just love this album from start to finish. Smooth listening. Had to have this album on my phone for Mondays where i need to say Sh--, Damn, MotherF---er.
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|One of few books describing II WW on the other side, showing the story of people fighting for the Country, not politicians.<br />Esp interesting for propeller heads like me.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I like this KJV and can use it at church; on your Kindle Fire or phone and you can use it for witnessing to others and showing them the WORD of God.
B00CL0J99K|2.0|This film was fun but lets be honest we wanted a awesome villain the trailers always fool you this film was like awesome in the first 40 minutes then slaps you in the face and makes you feel unsatisfied and for others this might have been a great film and thats fine but it wouldn't be something i would rewatch or brag about anyways theres a lot of laughs when its all said and done i feel the tone of film was fine but it really does a 180 for the worst in my opinion.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I don't play too many games, but this game is fun to play. It remains me  of my younger days.
B000001GAE|5.0|In the wrong hands, Liszt's sonata can be boring;  through his well known clarity of balance and execution, Pollini gives the music the right forward thrust, contrast in dynamics, and structure to create a compelling performance recorded so that the piano resembles a piano.  He knows how to play softly and his loudest passages are dynamic without being forced with a sense of something left in reserve.  All of this is also brought to the late pieces which are sparse in nature and require exquisite pianism to sound more than something merely played.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I love this series. They are all page turners, I recommend this series to everyone. Can't wait to read the next
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Great time killer game works grat on my galaxy tab 2 not so much my android max due to the small screen
B00DRPVE3M|1.0|does not connect and freezes up have never been able to use deleted off my kindle. thank god it was free!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|A bit depressing of a book -- spans many generations with mostly heartbreak, war, and duty. Well written but overall melancholy and depressing.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I started playing this game so my mother would have someone to send her gifts and the like. It's not really my style of game, but it's not bad.
B001FB4VZS|5.0|Great plan but sometimes they take too long  or prevent Clark from becoming who he was meant to become. As great as his intentions are, his character frustrates me when he keeps hesitating to &#34;get rid off&#34; the bad seed.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Passes the time good time would like it more if you hit bingo on the last number you get credit
B00B7Y0206|4.0|Sorry I just dont do utube enough to give a great rating.  Utube is maybe more for those who are younger and need entertaining.  I use it to find music and learn sewing methods.
B009WUBERW|3.0|Good movie love seeing the older tough guys they don't have anymore like threm they. Need more movies like this
B002LFPAUC|5.0|I love John Cleese. He does physical comedy so well and he is hilarious as Basil. Everything that can go wrong.....does. Love the predicaments basil gets into and how he deals with them.Manuel is pretty funny too as a foreigner bellhop who doesn't understand what basil wants him to do. Love this series!!
B003V1WTMM|3.0|Poor transitions.....choppy...didn't flow well or transition smoothly.  Found it a bit disappointing.  Would have liked a stronger and more in-depth characterization to match the descriptive passages on the surroundings.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|It's keeps me interested by changing the type of play but isn't timed so that if necessary I can stop and go back to it
B006G3JQ78|4.0|Kids really enjoyed it and it's great to share a classic with them!  Dick van Dyke and Julie Andrews have real talent and this movie really showcases it.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I enjoy playing games when I am trying to relax in the evening.  Now that I have completed a room I seem to want to play more just to complete another room.  I love to play.
B003DFLZB2|5.0|Amazing music. Epic, minor, sweet. Hans Zimmer and James Newton-Howard have combined to create the music that just defines the batman series. It is so fitting with the theme, and you just imagine the bats flying around.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|One of the best action games I've played ... I really hope there's a DH5 anytime soon .... unless there's one already.... but overall, it's a great game!
B003TKYAVI|5.0|Pretty good soundtrack. Epic yet not your normal orchestra sounding music. It has that spacey sound that fits the game. A good, fitting selection of music.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|This game is epic the  story was so well put together the game always kept me on edge  it was so hard to beat bosses and levels but after all of the hard work was rewarded with a epic cut scene it was worth it this game is a must have game for those people who love  role playing games<br /><br />I do have some complaints though I am bummed about saint items being remove I was working so hard for them also I have a problem on  multiplayer  my character gets frozen in place  and can't move attack or use skills until he dies  besides that this game is over all pretty dam epic
B00CRR5YA0|5.0|Michael Giacchino has created a masterpiece - I think it was even better than the music from the first film. With the combination of glorious crescendo's and epic music with softer piano pieces, it has a wide variety of music that fits with the genre. A great work!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This is a fun take on the classic version of the game. A great diversion. Worth the price, is fun, and I highly recommend it.
B009X01ELC|4.0|This case was more than expected.  it's very sturdy, has to be since I keep dropping my kindle.  Was a little difficult snapping it into the case at first but once the secret revealed itself it was a done deal.  I like that you can turn it around to suit the app or your taste.  Only 2 things I would suggest the improve on is somehow add a holder/slot to put the stylus in and maybe make the sleep/on/off button a different color.  Would make it lots easier to find.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|My wife has gotten addicted to this game.<br /><br />She likes plants.<br />She likes pretty colors.<br /><br />Basically, you can play in short time increments, several times a day and build a reef.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love this app. Love the game and being able to play bingo and slots all in the same app. Plus you have the opportunity to meet people from all over the world. Maybe you want a quiet game by shutting chat off. Also like that you can report abusive behavior. Still really like this app.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Much like Missile Command, but without track ball &amp; buttons. It's all finger touch, which gets difficult to see. I'd like to see game points increase upgrade points.
0811876373|5.0|nice books and yummy recipes for all occasions! My favorite recipe or cake pop was the cupcake cake pops or any of the cute animal ones!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Addicted to Coin Dozer. I am totally ADDICTED! I love coin dozed. It's the best. Woah YEAH! ha ha ha lol
B00CSR2J9I|2.0|I had this game for a month and everything was fine until the update came out it wont let me play it anymore please fix
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Further, after looking at some of these reviews I thought I'd explore on my own.<br />I use Avast and it found NO trace of any malware or adware or anything else potentially malicious.<br />I say great game, developers!
0743270754|5.0|This book is very readable. If you are truly interested in Lincoln and the Civil War, this book will not disappoint. This is a large book and will take some time to read, but I thought it was well worth it! My only criticism is Goodwin's focus on the social life in Washington. I felt some of this was unneeded, but some readers might enjoy those details. I'm not going to write a long review because other folks have already explained why this is such a fantastic read. Buy it! Read it! You will learn so much about politics, Lincoln, and the culture of those hard times. This book deftly describes the United State's epic struggle to remain a Union--one of the greatest stories in all history.
B0083Z614S|5.0|Wonderful l should have read it years ago. Excellent example of the power of positive thinking. One of my new favourites.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|A fantastic movie with wonderful costumes and fabulous singers! I've seen Phantom so many times as a musical that its nice to actually feel like you are sitting in the audience when watching this movie.
B004T4KQJS|4.0|Early man could not understand how the world always was, so someone came up with the idea that God made it.  But God was posited as having always been.  Not much progress here.  Krauss explains in fairly plain language why it is reasonable to believe the definition of empty space is not truly empty.  In part: since energy and matter can interchange, things can arise from empty space because of the massless energy contained there.  We have long known that the gods do not cause lightning, thunder and floods.  They are also not needed for sub atomic particles and the strong and weak attractions.  There is something rather than nothing because it is just there.  We have found it, measured it and work with it every day.  It is very likely eternal...but in changing forms.  Much simpler than a pantheon of gods and saints who initiate and control it.  All you have to do is study it.  Much more reliable and predictable than supernatural beings exercising their whims.
B008FYZIVY|4.0|At the end of Season 1, I was okay with that being the end of the whole series. There were definitely questions unanswered, but some hints as to how they would turn out. After all, isn't the modern world about ambiguity?<br />Season Two... soap opera-y. It's lost its charm for me. Not sure I'll go on to Season Three...
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This app does the job; it's a calculator.  The nice thing is its larger than using an iPhone.  It definitely serves the purpose.
B0082RHRHC|5.0|To me, &#34;timeless classic&#34; means a work has been revered not only across different time periods and cultures, but also has significance in different time periods of my own life. I read this the last time about 10 years ago in grad school. As budding feminist scholars, we castigated Mr. Rochester, reading him under the influence of Jean Rhys' Wide Sargasso Sea. He cruelly used and victimized the women in his life, we pronounced indignantly! A modern, self-assured Jane Eyre would never fall for his lies. I read it again, this time on a whim after seeing the 2011 movie version. I was struck in this reading by Jane's strength: her development and negotiation of power. For a girl of almost no resources and very few sources of power, she has an amazing inner strength that helps her not just survive, but thrive--from confronting her aunt's failure to live up to the promise of her dead husband, to walking away from Mr. Rochester when it took every ounce of self she could muster. In the end, it's not as significant that she finally acquired worldly good, but that she had such a strong sense of self and stayed true to it. And as for a feminist reading? What's poor old broken-hearted, well-meaning-but-misguided Mr. Rochester compared to the cold, manipulative, calculating, emotionally abusive, downright creepy Saint John? Give me an Edward Fairfax Rochester anyday!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|The writer does a fantastic job explaining the concept of metaphysical manifestation!  Wow, what an experiment.  Loved the results I received.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|It is an awesome movie and the special effects are really good. Definitely recommended to anyone we is into science fiction....
B005L38QHA|1.0|I tried this after using a Razer Naga for over a year and it worked at first but eventually became unusable. The cursor would look like it was having a seizure and move around in by its self. I cleaned the mouse by the laser, uninstalled and reinstalled the software, tried different pointer speed settings, tried using the mouse without the software, but nothing would fix the issue. I tried several other mice that I had and none had a similar issue. I will never buy a mouse from this company again.
B00005R62N|5.0|Why in the name of God did record companies decide, when putting albums on CD, to put the intro to a song AT THE END of the previous song?  Why?  I don't get it. Man,  some people, if you let them make a \\"one or the other\\" decision,  will ALWAYS get it wrong.  Uggh.  And they've now had 20 years to fix this and...nope. What is it?  Just in case a radio station is using the CD and doesn't want the intro?  Don't the give FREE copies to radio stations?  Make THOSE copies \\"NO INTRO\\" if you want! It'll make you crazy.  Judas Priest rules! Buy the disc anyway.
B00DURILJ2|4.0|Decent movie.  We watched on a relatively calm night.  I was entertained.  Would recommend watching it again.  End is kind of a bummer.
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|The band has a new singer.  This album is one of AIC's best albums, it has solid songs from start to finish.  I highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a creative sound and good music with meaningful lyrics.
B00DFFI7K2|4.0|Saw in theatre first.  Did love movie, but all my boys were instantly offended that they kill off a main character.  That is all I will say.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This novel was a wonderful read just as the Kite runner had been. The culture that Khaled Hosseini describes is rich and sad and relevant. We come to understand the life of the people in the are of Afghanistan. But more importantly we come to know the characters and care about what happens to them.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love it it is awesome u have one hundred and one games in one and u have to try to unlock the games u want. and it takes op less space then 101 acctual games.
B00CW7KK9K|5.0|If you already have either of their scales, this is a must have partner accessory for any person looking to measure activity.<br /><br />Simply to use, features all work as intended and so easy to setup.<br /><br />The charge last for multiple days, so you hardly ever have to recharge.<br /><br />BUY IT!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Time flies by cuz your sucked into this game it's fun I would definitely get and recommend this game to anyone with time to kill or bored
B008K8VDPU|5.0|This app is so much fun for a child plus for me we play on it all the time it's a good thing to have for some learning and fun.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love hill climber, the graphics are decent. The levels are a challenge and the best part is that you can choose the level and vehicle.
B008X9Z37A|3.0|Should have shopped a little more.  Serves the purpose as a dust cover and a good price.  Still wanted something a bit stronger and classy.
B006ANJ4BW|1.0|Three minutes and thirty-two seconds. The shortest time I've ever given a movie to entertain me. Really? Mom to be wants to see her baby so it gets cut out of her? Well, I assume that's what happened, I turned it off when the knife was drawn. NO THANK YOU! Sorry about the spoiler.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|it is a good game. i will play this game again. u can tell it was created with high replayability.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|I . Simple but fun. Very enjoyable game. Would definitely recommend to others. Thanks developers! Keep it coming. Love the arcade style, fairly refreshing for a mobile game. Would be cool to see integration with Google games
B000VYX8PE|5.0|A series of unfortunate events is so very very awesome I love the book very very very much you should read this very awesome book
B00499NHLC|5.0|This show if fantastic. Acting is superb, story lines are amazing. Benedict Cumberbatch should be in a lot more things. Excited to start season 2.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|A good lesson for us as parents to know how important it is to tell our kids how much we love them and to help them not only have roots in that love, but to encourage their dreams so they can grow wings.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|This show is a great combination of suspense,  action,  and comedy.  The characters are relatable and lovable.  I definitely recommend this show.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|Wonderful book as usual from Kate Morton.  Hope there is a new one soon, as I have read all her books now and enjoyed each and everyone.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|buy this product if you are a beatle fan you will likeit very much and it is a great gift too!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Very fun game. Lots of features. Plays very well on my nexus 7 and my galaxy S3. Worth the download.
B00DV2D0JC|4.0|I love these games, they are a lot of fun. This one could be a little longer but overall it was fun.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This app is pretty fun. Gets a little bit repetitive. Try it and I think you will like it. Have fun.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Fun game, easy to pick up and play, not complicated. Price was right too. Great take on a classic game.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Fun, fast paced game. Just stared. Having fun. Looking forward to see how well it goes. I hope it gets better. Able to upgrade defence quickly at first.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I only wish I could play more games! I run out of credits too soon. I don't spend money on games so I just wait till next day
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This is a great game yet challenging for the eye you always have to be looking. I advise people to play
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This game is simple and becomes very addicting. The best part is it reminds one of the first generation Atari. Being for free is just a bonus.
B00000F566|5.0|Decided to add Dirty Dancing to my video library because I always liked it.  As I said in my headline, it has great music.  The songs are all from the era I grew up in and went to Junior High and High School.  Love it.  The only music I listen to today.  The dancing in great too.  Jennifer Grey is wonderful and of course Patrick Swayze is tops in this film.
B00DXP7L88|5.0|Among all the cult/Serial killer films or shows, Dexter makes you root for a side in life you normally wouldn't.. I hope that the writers would maybe create a spinoff with some of the characters.. Something tells me that Dexters code has finally made full circle back to him.. I recommend this series to everyone thats over 18.. Parting is such Sweet Sorrow..
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is a great game except my phone freezes during play all the time.  Good concept for the kids to play. Newer phone stopped the freezing.  5 stars now.
B0054YH8VQ|4.0|I am sure that most people buying this record already know it well. I am forty, so this record was really a bit before my time, but it was a staple on the stereo in our house (we listened to a lot of music in our house when I was a kid). If you are younger and interested, this is a good one, Billy Joel is often overlooked and underrated. Billy is in a class by himself, while everybody else was either going with Hard Rock or Disco, Billy Joel was doing something else, and he did it well.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Buy this!! I love it! It is hard, there is a lot of jumping on getting on the floor. Something I can't do it but I try my best. I had a stroke a few years ago. Some of the thing in the dvd, my physical therapist have had me do before. Doing this workout, my balance is so much better, I'm getting so strong, and I'm losing weight. I have only had it for three weeks!!! I wish I could give Jillian a hug and thank her. I'm telling everyone about this dvd!
0345529057|5.0|I have not been able to put these books down since I bought them.  They came in a speedy time and were exactly as described. I am extremely pleased with this purchase.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|This is a fun game. It also makes you think. Some of the puzzles are actually pretty hard. But over all it is fun
B000002KHB|5.0|Highway Star, Space Truckin', and Smoke on the Water are classic Purple songs, but this album is outstanding even without them. That says it all when it comes to Machine Head- Deep Purple's signature release. One of the very first incarnations of heavy metal, this album highlights the guitar riff and hard-hitting high-pitched vocals that fit the genre. It is simply a sin that Deep Purple haven't been inducted into the Hall as of yet; this injustice has got to end very soon, because this band is a trailblazer and a heavy influence on other great bands over the years. If you want to hear the perfect early 70's heavy metal album, look no further than Machine Head.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is great. You get 132 games in one. I am 9 years old and you should listen to the kid. You will regret not getting this application.
159448385X|4.0|Very good book....A lot of people that I know are reading this and we all like it as well...try it
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Awesome, so much fun and realistic! My 4 year old daughter loves it and we r working n g hard to get a rainbow horse!
B0010YPTGU|5.0|This CD has wonderful music for all.  It is always nice to have the DVD along with the CD......  very clear sound.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Really fun old school game with better graphics than the original, but that goes without saying these days. Lol Better because it was free.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Super fun and addicting I recommend it . Sets a challenge and gets your mind working hard DEFINITELY WORTH IT
B000N4S86Q|2.0|purchased on the recommendation of  friend.  Just not<br />my type of entertainment.  I am against all types of violence<br />and have a difficult time watching it.
B00821OX98|5.0|Love this show; such a twist from regular network viewing and with the edge-of-your-seat quality only Spielberg can bring us. So great to see Noah Wyle in this edgy role, too!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Just the right tone and moral values to help us<br />all want to stay the course and try to always do<br />the right thing.
B0014EU5XI|4.0|This collection has the songs most are familiar with and some that are not well known. I think it is good for a casual fan like myself. I saw the band in 1980 but never owned any of their albums.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Nice diversion good break from the birds! Remember playing this on old system. Glad they revived a classic! The graphics are better than the white line buildings we used to defend. This has been good fun. I'll continue to play this game.
B0067LY4WG|5.0|Music reviews are totally subjective. I think Leonard Cohen is a very gifted songwriter, and his voice goes well with the songs he writes. In addition to this CD, I have the box set of his 11 studio albums.
B008YZXYY2|3.0|if your a real SlipKnot fan this cd is not for you comes off a bit weak and does not have the same feel but that is ok because it is not SlipKnot just some ones from SlipKnot trying something else.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Easy and fun to use. Get stuck and you can see if you are missing a move. You win enough to keep it interesting. Good way to pass a little time.
B008602KQI|5.0|Great movie! Easy streaming. Excellent picture quality. Definitely planning to watch many more movies in the coming weeks and months.
B005723JSQ|5.0|Excellent book. I love Sophie 's quick witty banter between characters. It is such an easy read. Light and delightful.
B00A81NFAS|5.0|Really don't know what to say here...just a fantastic, nothing like it movie! Loved it, and own it! You'll love it too!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|OMG!!!! This is a reminder of how fun classics games were. Simple graphics, great concept and intuitive<br />Game play is a  sure formula for fun!
B00640UICA|4.0|To sum it up, The game involves you rotating and moving these creatures so that all their hands are connected together. Those without connected hands are sad, Those with are happy, so it's easy to tell them apart and who you need to connect. It's simple yet challenging at the same time and it has plenty of levels to play as well. It enjoy playing it and would recommend it to those who love puzzle solving games.
B00DUGCLY4|3.0|Some of them I knew immediately, but others I had to bask my dad. So prob not for young people.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|this is the best game ever. I cant stop playing it. if u add like a Nike for us like only 5 a game that would be awesome
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Great but I couldn't help but get confused that different people were in other chapters<br />It had a great story line with each chapter as well
B002U0KHMY|5.0|Usually it takes me about 4 or 5 episodes of a show to get even remotely interested but I was hooked by the 2nd episode of this show. I'm on season 4 now but have been acting like an addict with this show. The writing, story line, characters, acting, actors... all of it is amazing. You start to care so much for these characters and you can't help but keep watching to see what happens next. A very balanced blend of humor, romance, suspense, mystery and drama. This is my new favorite show!
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|This game I very easy to understand and play. It's very fun.<br />It has the adventure and the amazing shows.
B008JFUO4U|4.0|I personally don't understand why this movie got bad reviews in the beginning. This was really a very intelligent and well done Sci-Fi Affair . No, it wasn't a action movie and I loved the fact it wasn't. In Fact it was a very intelligent complex well written story. I thought Tom Cruise's perfomance was one of the best he's had in along time. He actually had emotion and did seem vunerable and unsure of himself. I think any person that is intelligent and like challenging stories should see this. What it basically comes down too everything he knows is wrong. And why is everything in the state that it is in today is one big question. But as the movie progresses it give us all the answers we are looking for. The film isn't set up in a heroic type nature or action adventure type. Its about a man that is a technician and honestly just has bad days at work. And his quest to find the truth and to deal with the situations as they come up. Which is a rare style in this day in age for cinema. M83 did a great job with the music score it brought the film out. Instead of just playing as background music like most films. The score made the scenes more emotional and important. The visuals were astonishing and very uniquie like a tron or ridley scott affair. Joseph has his own style like Ridley Scott which is rare in the industy of todays american cinema. I really can't wait to see what he comes up with in the future as well as the next Tron adventure.<br />----------
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this game and it's the best horse game out there!! The ads do get a bit annoying but it's still a wonderful game and beautiful  graphics.
B000B5OD4I|5.0|Bought this timepiece from Dexclusive and the movement is perfect. I have not been monitoring the timepiece for a day yet, it's been several hours and I have not noticed even a slightest loss or gain in minutes. Highly recommended timepiece and the seller Dexclusive is also a recommendation from me. I have just swapped out the jubilee band for a 3 ring zulu strap and the timepiece with it looks flawless. The timepiece itself is a classic and is very elegant with quite a bit of sportiness to it. The lume is not bad, yet I noticed it requires quite a bit of light to beam on it for it to light up in the dark well. Best value for the price.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Good game it has nice grafics and it has the basic characters of despicable me<br />Pie pie pie i i
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Just like I said. Fun time waster. I guess I need to write a bit more so it will accept this review. . .
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This is a very fun fast pace game. I wish I was able to keep up with the game but some people's brains function slower than others.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Fun but way too easy<br />Barely have to try they come in kind of slow and they give plenty of time to react
0345803485|4.0|I was bored so bought it . its good for passing time . I like it . its a good read book.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|I love both performers and musicals and I felt this movie really wasn't given the proper chance it should have been given! The plot was great, the singing amazing, and it really captures the old Burlesque days of performance! Ignore the critics and watch it today!
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Awesome read. Complicated story line thar required two good reads. I have been following this series since the beginning and it was awesome to see how the dots connected. Can NOT wait for the next book.
B0000U0X1G|5.0|I had to get this movie because someone stole my original copy but I love this movie it's so awesome and I just totally love it!!!!! This is one of my all time favorite movies!!!! Great plot, great character development, great acting, and just an all around great movie!!!!
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Really excellent. Just witnessing the magic that can happen when truly talented people get together and make music is part of what makes this film so special.
B00338QENI|5.0|This is an incredible story about a brave lady.  Although I'm sure her family would rather she had lived a long life with them, imagine the millions of people allowed to do so because of the miracle of her \\"immortal cells\\".  An interesting, smart read.
1596438274|5.0|This detailed look at a great, though not well known physicist will be a hit with the middle school-high school crowd, especially since the author chose a graphic novel format. Richard Feynman is shown in a positive light with a both humorous and poignant look at an extraordinary man. His scientific achievements are mentioned with just enough detail to entice a younger reader with little scientific background.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I love it! Simple to set up ... it sets itself up really. You should download chrome browser. I use safari on a mac but that isn't supported. I just use chrome for the chromcast dongle, not for anything else. Anyway, it gives you the option of netflix or youtube, or google play. There are more options promised. What I like about it is that it 'casts' your movie or video, or whatever to the device via the cloud so you're not dependent on the device your casting from ... like your laptop. When it's finished casting which is like 20 seconds for a whole movie you can shut off your laptop and watch the movie. Whenever I set up my laptop to the tv with cables in the past I had to keep my laptop on and open and would get quite hot after a 2 hour movie. With the chrome cast - no wires. I can't use it with my iPhone, ipad yet. They are working on apps for that. It does work with Android though. I read it somewhere. I must say that you have to have wireless, but most have that anyway these days. I'm glad I bought it... and it came with 3 months netflix which is a good incentive ... paid for the dongle actually. I will certainly carry on with Netflix. It can also also stream your screen while you're working on it. Not much point I know but I guess you can share games and stuff doing that. I can go to crackle.com on my laptop and cast a movie from there onto the dongle too. Anything. Another thing I like is that if someone wants to watch a movie, and I don't like it or get bored, I can work on my laptop while it's playing on the tv. Google is really the way to go and it can only get better. I have Roku and wdtv, but I'm going to sell those and keep things simple. You won't regret getting it. OBTW I had to wait a while for mine because they are selling like hot cakes on a cold morning.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Nice clear app on my old kindle. It works pretty well at picking up the location that you are in.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I don't play game's that cost me money and Uno is a great one! Fun,fast and addictive! Love it! Will recommend it to all of my friends!
B007H7XRLI|3.0|The movie is typical of the genre and provides decent rainy Saturday afternoon entertainment.  Not too exciting, nothing unexpected happens.
B003UPPO2G|3.0|love the content of dvd, have seen it before, but has two skips on this one, will keep, because I love the Bee Gees..great service..
B00DP3IGJ6|4.0|The movie had some surprises, decent action and interesting plot.  The graphics were well done and the actors all played their parts well.
B00005N83M|5.0|I think this is one of her best albums to date. I have plenty of favorites on this CD. My favorite is the Latin track &#34;Ain't It Funny&#34; and the Murder Remix of &#34;I'm Real&#34; Also &#34;Love Don't Cost a Thing&#34; is a great song. Love it.
B00BB3UYS8|4.0|When I started reading this book I thought it wasn't my bag but then the story became a little more and I began to enjoy it. The way the main character kept having 'outviews' was different. There were times, however, when I felt I was no longer a reader but a listener...but I still liked it, though, well-written, with twists and a good story. Recommend it for any reader of YA fantasy.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|If you've ever wondered what was going on in 1st-century Jerusalem, Nazareth, or Galilee, this is a book that with some credibility answers that question. A great read.
B002QCAXOS|1.0|This was such a waste of time.  I watched it to the end just to be sure it did not have something to salvage it.  But, sadly, it did not.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Lots of fun........ I like it to pass time and keep busy I highly recommend for anyone who remembers missile command.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Really cool graphics and story but defenetly not hours of play. I would be a lot happier with it if it had more sub plots
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game really makes you think and exercises your memory. One of my favorites so far. I would definitely recommend.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I was thinking it was going to be just another boring defense game where i would just have to shoot rockets out of the sky but i never knew that there would be upgrades! And it gets harder as you go. This is great game
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|I like all the jumping. The cars are so realistic. I could play this game forever. I love the new infected
B00CWY76CC|5.0|From the first puzzle to the last I was amazed at the complexity and cleverness of them all.  I found myself thinking about them even while not actually playing.  I can't wait for the new scenes!!  Great Job!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I bought this set for my mother because she hadn't seen season one and didn't know what we were all raving about. She loved receiving the set and has enjoyed it so much. Beautifully packaged, very collector-ish.
B008JFUN6E|2.0|The movie was a cool for its special effects and its action.<br />but it turned out to be a propaganda film for health care illegal aliens and racism.<br />to bad they wasted an opportunity to make a great film.
B007MB5OCE|3.0|I enjoyed the early situations but after a time, the silly stuff became tiresome.<br />Our hero seems to lead the ultimate charmed existence ... for over 100 years!<br />During his long life, he meets and somehow charms most of the 20th Century<br />Leaders. I'm surprised that Adolph Hitler was missed. Hmmmm!<br />This is truly silly stuff and you find yourself saying \\"Oh come on ...really ???\\"<br />a little too often. The elephant, the world traveler, and the situations become<br />over the top too often as the tale unfolds.<br />An unbelievable imagination is needed to enjoy the yarn. My difficulty with the<br />story is not being able to identify with any of the characters.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I remember playing this on the old Intellivision.  It was a favorite then, and I'm loving it now. It plays well on the Fire HD 8.9.  Gotta be fast or be blown to bits. Really like it.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I  was disappointed after all the hype this book received. It was boring and redundant.<br /><br />I will not be buying the next book in the series.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Excellent casting, fantastic characters, plot twists, writing, acting, magnificent costuming, photography, sets.  It was better than a great book.  I never wanted it to end. The pronunciation never interfered with my understanding of the words.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Defending Jacob is not just a legal or crime thriller.  It is also a psychological study of parental love for their children and the lengths they go for protecting them.  I'm not usually a fan of crime novels but Defending Jacob is where I make an exception.
B0063M22QO|5.0|So easy to see and lots of fun. I recommend this for all ages. I like this version better than all other s.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|In this novel you enter a nightmare which is hard to get out of your head even when you finish the book.<br />The story happens in present day North Korea and depicts the unbelievable horrors of a police state at its most.<br />It is masterly told and deserves the Prize it received.  A great read but one that the weak in heart are best to avoid.
B00000J7JO|3.0|I'd like to start by stating, I'm not a Chili Peppers fan.  In fact, this is the only one of their albums I like and that's a shame because the sound quality is horrendous.  The volume level is extremely loud, has an absurd amount of sonic compression, and is highly distorted.  I'm flabbergasted that a major record company would release an album of this poor quality.  The sound quality is tolerable if you reduce the volume on your media player by at least 40% and sadly, sounds better as low bit-rate mp3's.  I don't rate this 1 star because the album is a good listen start-to-finish if you can get past the poor sound quality.  I hope in a few years they will release a remastered edition of this album produced by anyone other than Rick Rubin.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|Can't say I enjoy my 6 year old asking me to spell words every 5 minutes is fun but he sure does love this game. Lol I also have a 10 year old who loves it, heck I love it. Fun and addictive! Anything you type comes to life in this game. Takes your kids imagination to a WHOLE new level. Love it!!!!
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|I like this game a lot. It could be a little bit more complicated but the game play is good.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I absolutely loved it. It's fun new and creative. My niece enjoys playing it. I recommend it for everyone! I'm 13 and I love playing it. Download it!!! :)
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Not Bad It Is Fun. It Is Ok. Not Quite Like The Atari But It Is Good. Can Get Old, But Not Bad.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Fun game, don't think I would buy it. But so far no problems. I think it's a great time waster and its super easy to play with very clear instructions.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Are you kidding me... This was the last book of The Clifton Chronicles and it left me hanging. Please tell me he's going to write another book in this series. I read all 3 in a week and they were absolutely fabulous. After 40 years of reading his books they are truly the best. He may leave you hanging but he will never let you down!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Great game for free hours of fun not too easy.gets easier when you understand how to get best out of game
B00ECU2RGY|3.0|This movie was entertaining in a whole, but it had some dry parts where it could have moved along better. Tom Cruise was typical Tom Cruise and I think his best movies are behind him. If you are looking for a relaxing sci-fi movie, this one is alright.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Love this game, nice and old school, I've been waiting for it to be redone and it was done well. Start with a nice amount of points and it makes me reminisce about playing it back in the day. If you liked the original you'll love this version. There are almost Times when it seems too easy but thats probability cuz I have experience with it.
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|Seriously, some of these pets and houses would cost hundreds of dollars and you can't even touch them or resell.  I think they should sell the &quot;bling&quot; for about a tenth of what it currently costs.  I'm not planning on buying any because of the high cost.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It keeps the kids busy and very happy.  This is for short periods of time when I need it.  Love it for long trips.
1623360277|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone, who wants to regain his/her health and lose weight, if needed or desired. Since implementing The Starch Solution principles and practices, specifically the section on maximizing weight loss, I have found that my excess weight seems to be sliding off with ease. I have been attempting a whole-foods plant-based eating approach for some time, however this book gave me a needed jolt of rejuvenation toward regaining my overall health.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I love little pet shop it is fun for all ages there is a lot of pets you can play with and it is okay
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|It is a fun game and it is a good challenge for people who are bored or looking for something to do
B0091I7FEQ|5.0|I purchased the first edition of this book a few years back when it was one of the only books available. It has only gotten better with time as the language has become more complex and nightmarish.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This game is so fun to play with friends and family. I love this game. Even though this is the free version it is a blast to play
B00B8BR1YS|5.0|This has become my new favorite movie, replacing The Princess Bride.  Joseph Fiennes, Gwyneth Paltrow, Tom Wilkinson, Geoffrey Rush, Judi Dench, Colin Firth, all performances to be viewed with awe and to a script that is engaging, entertaining, and fun.  It doesn't get any better than this if quirky and clever is your cup of tea.
B003QS9WIE|5.0|Movie had you on the edge of your seat for the whole time! Ending was great and really made you think!
B00DL47ORO|5.0|\\"Blackfish\\" (2013 release; 85 min.) takes a critical look at killer whales being kept in captivity, and the devastating effects on the orcas AND their trainers. The movie opens with the news in 2010 that veteran orca trainer Dawn Brancheau has been killed at an incident at the SeaWorld water amusement park in Orlando (we don't see any footage of it). From there the documentary goes on to show the beginnings of orca whaling to bring them into those water amusement parks. In the early 90s a young but rapidly growing orca named Tilikum is involved in \\"an incident\\" at a small park in Victoria, BC, after which the owner decides to shut down the park, and Tilikum is bought by SeaWorld in Orlando. I won't tell you how it all connects to the tragic death of Brancheau, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br /><br />Couple of comments: first and foremost, this is a shocking and yet riveting documentary, one of the likes you don't get to see very often. Second, the movie interviews a bunch of former SeaWorld orca trainers who, with years of wisdom, now decry the multi-million dollar industry that has become these water amusement parks with killer whales putting on a \\"show\\". Their point of view is clear. Third, there are no reposts from anyone at SeaWorld in the movie (in the end credits, we are told that \\"SeaWorld did not respond to multiple requests for an interview\\". Last, but certainly not least, towards the end of the movie, we are shown a number of graphic videos of \\"when orcas go wild\\" and viewer beware, they are not for the faint of heart, but at the same time, they bring home the point that keeping these killer whales in captivity is just wrong, and can lead to disastrous results.<br /><br />This documentary made a huge splash (pardon the punt) at the Sundance film festival earlier this year. It just opened this weekend at my local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati, and the showing tonight where I saw this at was PACKED, I am happy to say. This movie proves once again that \\"facts are stronger than fiction\\", reason why I love well-made documentaries like this one so much. Bottom line: this is a shocking and revolting documentary that is simply a must see. \\"Blackfish\\" is HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!s movie proves once again that \\"facts are stronger than fiction\\", reason why I love well-made documentaries like this one so much. Bottom line: this is a shocking and revolting documentary that is simply a must see. \\"Blackfish\\" is HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B0063M22QO|5.0|This is a great game!  The app for kindle functions quite well.  Great price!  Watch out the game is addictive.
B00006AW2G|5.0|While others argue about the sound quality of various re-issues, I'm very happy with the 2002 version. I don't take the advice in the booklet to play it loud, because I live in a house of multiple occupation and not all of those who would hear it if I did are Stones fans. But I love the album even at normal volumes.<br /><br />The set opens with Gimmie shelter, a song that should be familiar to most people, which is followed by the only non-original song on the album. Love in vain, a cover of a blues song by Robert Johnson, features Ry Cooder as guest musician playing mandolin.<br /><br />Next up is Country honk, a song better known as Honky-tonk women, under which title it is the most famous song here. Byron Berline is the guest musician here, playing fiddle. The remaining songs are all great, wiith my favorites among them being Midnight rambler and You can't always get what you want.<br /><br />This is a great album from 1969 with plenty of variety among its nine tracks.
B0051OZ564|2.0|I wanted to see hot girls kick ass, but the graphics were corny and the fight scenes weren't bad ass at all. I gave this movie 2 starts because the fight scenes suck and that's what the movie is seemingly built around. Not an interesting enough story line to save it
B00A3NQNUU|2.0|After Dragonvale updated it keeps crashing when i try to move my habitats and edit my pathways. Please fix this ASAP. I love the app and dont want to get rid of it.x
B003TOMAPC|5.0|The fight scenes were actually really bad ass, zero corniness! The story line was really well put together and it hilarious as well
B0063IH60K|4.0|typical solitaire, not better or worse than any other. good for quick entertainment when you are bored. rotes worth downloading
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Good game nice n quick with some good graphics and upgrading is always nice so overall i would say it is quite nice
B005XQLBU4|4.0|pretty fun hahahahahha though it'd be better if the app didn't lag or anything and the screen didn't have flahses of black and white
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Super fun game that's not too hard I got it for free but it's definitely worth a few bucks, it's great for passing time!
0201485672|5.0|This is the book I'm searching for, that telling you what kind of coding is right and what is wrong.
0452273331|3.0|One could say a lot about this book. However, talking about character idiosyncrasies (seriously, Dominique badly needs a therapist) and author's writing style (fluctuating between surprisingly good and worthy of mediocre romance novel) would take several pages, so I'll focus on the one feature of this book I've found most surprising - namely, just how critical of capitalism it is, coming from such an (in)famous proponent of capitalism as Ayn Rand.<br /><br />One would suppose that, in capitalist society, the sole measure of worth of an idea would be how much money it could bring. Yet the hero of the book is admirable precisely because he eschews money and fame in order to preserve his artistic integrity. A capitalist would create what sells - but this is exactly what the author rather scathingly satirises.<br /><br />Indeed, the \\"evil\\" in this book is not government interference, but market forces which would drag the artist down to the level of public taste(lessness).<br /><br />As for personal opinion - I loved this book, I hated it and I snarked at it. It was thoroughly entertaining intellectually and, occasionally, spectacularly bad. But also, I wish I had read it when I was younger - it might have saved me the heartbreak of being stuck in the job I hate because that's what I'm \\"supposed to do\\".
B000TGJ7ZY|5.0|This is the best Dracula movie I have seen . It is very close to the book . A little over the top ,but that what the whole thing is supposed to be about . The sets  are beautifully and the costume are beautifully done . the director gives it an edge that puts you on the end of your chair.  I like is movie a lot ..
B008YKGQR4|2.0|Have tried uninstalling and 're- installing , but it just doesn't work on my kindle, very frustrating. Had another version for a long time but it stopped working also for some unknown reason.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|It is a very good and awesome book. I completely recommend this book for a read aloud or a great self selected book.
B000VECAC6|5.0|Just hilarous - laugh out loud outrageous Monty Python at it's best!  May annoy some, sacrilegious - controversial, and it's out thee ... but just sit back, relax, and laugh ...
B009WUBERW|4.0|not a movie I would have taken the wife or kids to see, but I liked the macho man stuff in it.  Story was unbelievable, but the cast was entertaining and held interest.  I think only for the men, but that's my opinion. It was worth the 1.5 hr investment - could be Stallone's last movie.....
1594484805|3.0|This book was recommended in a class I took for being a coach, but the concepts were not new - just packaged a different way.

B001F6ZIXW|5.0|I look forward to the first season. Every frend I know has recommended this show. And not everyone is a rider.
B002BJGYV2|1.0|I bought this season along with 6 and 7 a few months ago as I have been making my way through the seasons.  This is the first set I have ordered from Amazon.  Not only were the leaflets missing inside the DVD that were present in my other sets, but the last disc in the series is unloadable and I tried it on three different dvd players.  Since these are brand new I am obviously not happy.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|good game that helps pass time while enaging in calculated shots. Helps me during those waiting periods between server installs.
0525478817|5.0|I had never come across John Green before and am back on Amazon to buy everything else he has ever written as I think he is a genius. This book made me feel how &#34;La vita e Bella&#34; film did, there is so much humor, but always with tragedy as an undertone, and yet each sad scene is also made to be as light and funny as possible. A phenomenal book with so much heart, absolutely loved it. Thank you John Green.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is the best game I tryed the 2 one I hate it. I love this one. this is the best game in the world
B005544TRQ|4.0|Just happened on this show by accident and started watching a couple of weeks ago. I've enjoyed watching the characters develop and the relationship evolve between Harvey and Mike. Reminds of the show White Collar. I hope as the show goes on that Mike will eventually go to law school and get the degree to back up his knowledge and smarts.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|You gotta suspend belief to enjoy this one. It has some nice twists of plot. Enjoy it if your a Tom Cruise fan
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|If you are serious in studying comparative theology, this book is a must.  I was already aware of it long before the media hype that surrounded it, generally by those trying to discredit the author in any way they could.  Aslan is a serious religious scholar, who does his very best to keep everything in context, without the usual spin to theology we see in these modern times by violence prone groups who exploit religion for their own personal gain.<br /><br />I have the Kindle version of this book, using Amazon's available (free) app for Android on my Galaxy Note II.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This is a great throwback game. Plays well and lots of fun. Reminds me of when I was a kid playing this on my Atari 2600.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Love how as you read you acquire the culture of the book. You have history in the south, but you also have culture. Belief systems that are imbedded within centuries of families
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I can appreciate this app, for the most part. Some of the games seem to be better than others. Nice concept though.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Because of the bad reviews I held off on reading this book for almost a year! What a fool! This book is great! I love the story building, there might not be as much actions the others but there is some great story telling going on here.  A few of the chapters I may have skimmed through but the characters that the majority of us care about we're great. So don't read the reviews.....just READ THE BOOK!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is very cool. I invite everyone to at least try it out. You will love it.Once you start you will not want to put it down.
B008602KQI|1.0|This movie had more logistical and technical issues with the premise & storyline than an m.night shyamalan horror flick!<br />how anyone can rate this pathetic movie above 1 star is beyond me!<br />the writer, director & producers simply stuff a totally unrealistic, unorganized and half thought story down the viewers throat.<br />At no point during the movie is the viewer left with the notion \\"well, this makes sense.\\" - even if you projected the story's reality with common sense logic, you are left scratching your head.<br />This movie will entice simple minded viewers who get caught up in cinematography, bright colors and grand delusions of living in a post apocalyptic society- however, any intelligent person who demands a logic-train relevant to the story's premise will quickly become anxious and annoyed.<br /><br />so- they can heal sword cuts & 3rd degree burns overnight with special magical healing cream, they have levitating space craft and can instantly morph dozens of living breathing evil bulldogs from the dirt by clapping their hands on a table... but some evil dictator demands to take a male & female child from some family and make them fight to the death; pitting tiny little 11 yo girls against 18 yo trained killers in the same fight, just so no one forgets the way they evolved into their current \\"districts\\" and peaceful life? really?<br /><br />only one out of 24 will survive the fight- each man & woman for their own... and they form alliances? what? why? there were so many perfect opportunities for each of them to kill the other- (5 of them falling asleep next to each other for example) and no one takes the shot? This is one of the stupidest movies I've ever watched- there's so many pathetic inconsistencies and holes in the story- it's insulting to the intelligent viewer!  people consider this babblewash movie 5 stars? it's absolutely comedic!
B004CEUEWE|5.0|A great crime thriller in which also has intense emotional depth.  Affleck is a superlative director, even managing to coax out a good performance by Blake Lively!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I don't know what all this malware talk is about.  I have followed the FAOTD since the beginning. This is the second time this app has been the FAOTD.  I have never had any problems with it. I don't think the app or developer would have been around this long if it truly was malware.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|As expected from Hosseini, a beautifully wrought tale of the limitless love of family and the complexity of the relationships that define us.
B00475AYJQ|3.0|After the Five-Star trip Rothfuss took us on in \\"The Name of the Wind\\", I found \\"The Wise Man's Fear\\" to be a great disappointment.<br />Is it a \\"page-turner\\"? Yes, but only because you keep searching in vain for him to get back on track and start getting somehwere!<br />It's hard to describe how irritating this one is. It's tedious for one thing, as it seems he constantly bogs down on minutea details that really aren't necessary, and even with them... He doesn't get you anywhere! It really does seem at times that the Writer walks away from his keyboard, and then upon returning arbitrarily decides to launch into a whole new tangiental direction. It's chaotic, and all through the book he never answers some glaring holes in his storyline.<br /><br />I would hope that IF Rothfuss were going to attempt a finish to this series...which seems unlikely now since it's been since March, 2011 when this one was published, and not a peep has been heard on it... He would exert some story discipline and tie-up the myriad of loose ends he's left unanswered.<br /><br />As before, I credit him with having the capacity for a good Fantasy Writer, but fault his apparent lack of writing discipline & focus on this sequel.<br /><br />*SPOILER ALERT!* Do not read past this point if you do not wish to have the story line revealed to you!<br /><br />Unanswered questions which make the story less believable and as such makes the suspension of disbelief difficult:<br /><br />1) Kvothe's Edema Ruh family was under the \\"protection\\" of Baron Greyfellows(?)- Why is there no mention of him investigating the murder of those under his \\"protection\\"? No investigation what-so-ever?<br /><br />2) It's impossible to believe, especially given Kvothe's outspoken manner, that he never mentioned the incident involving his family's murder on the road from Hallowell to anyone. He would have at least gone back to Hallowell and sought out \\"Ben\\" the arcanist/tinker who had just left their company to settle with a rich Widow in that town. That would have made a much more convincing storyline than to simply have him go bumbling off into the woods. Trauma or no, he was obviously scared and seeking safety and that would have been his most natural impulse.<br /><br />3) Given the fact that it was Abenthy's (Ben) recommendation which gets Kvothe into the University, and the University Masters obviously know him: Why doesn't Kvothe ever approach him about a \\"patronage\\"? He's married into wealth, and being informed of the tragic murder of his family you would think it would be this man's natural compulsion to look out for young Kvothe. And if not Abenthy, why not the Baron whose protection failed his family?<br /><br />These are just three glaring examples of where the storyline fails to convince us of the possibility of it actually happening.<br />It is well said that the best lies are those enshrined in the greatest amount of truths; and so it is with good \\"fiction\\": Absolutely critical to the \\"suspension of disbelief\\" is Readers ability to toy with the notion that these things just possibly could be so. But the only way that can happen is if the story-teller sets the stage with as much common sense truth as possible to disarm the Reader's natural defenses. Remove or ignore too many well-known constants, and fiction becomes crass absurdity.<br /><br />I really do hope Mr. Rothfuss will get it together and return with the discipline of an Adema having passed the test of the blade tree.<br /><br />Cheers.
B005XQLBU4|1.0|I installed this and my Kaspersky immediately told me it was not a virus but was malicious content that criminals could use against me. With many concerns of contaminated 3rd party apps I have read about on news sites, indecided not to keep this on my device.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|It may look worse than others but you will never over sleep again as long as you keep this app!<br />I switched for no reason and I over slept almost every day<br />This app it the better than my real alarm clock<br />Get this app!!!!!
B005XQLBU4|1.0|As soon as it was installed kaspersky flagged it and said it is an adware tool used to push ads to the user.<br /><br />COME ON AMAZON!!!<br />Are the FAOTD allowed without any scanning or regulation?<br />You have just pushed someone elses adware to millions of users by making this the FAOTD.  Uninstalled immediately.<br /><br />Also unistalled the app store due to GROSS NEGLEGENCE on amazons part for allowing this to be the free app of the day.  VERY DISSAPOINTED.
B004O3YGMC|1.0|First, a little history about me:  I've got close to 30 years in IT support as a system integrator and sys admin so I know a little about computers.<br /><br />As part of my regular duties I research, evaluate and deploy software for SMBs.<br /><br />Tonight I was on a quest to find a reasonably priced remote desktop app for my Android phone and tablet.  While I've been a huge fan of Logmein for some time, I didn't want to shell out another 30 dollars for it as I paid for it once for iOS (my previous phones have been iPhones - a 3G and a 4).  So I went looking for a new app and found Splashtop Remote.<br /><br />What I found during the setup and config of this app was astonishing:  as a standard part of network discovery and to \\"find\\" my computer, Splashtop requested and required my Google username and password.<br /><br />I sit here stunned as I just got off the phone with Google.  I called them as that's how alarming I found this.<br /><br />The Google rep asked me to provide feedback in the form of a survey they said they would send out.<br /><br />I tried my best to offer to this Google rep that I wanted to speak to an upper tier support rep as that's how strongly I feel that this method of authentication to \\"find\\" a computer on the Internet is highly irregular and represents a huge security hole.  Google had no mechanism to allow me to do and the rep I spoke with seemed insistent as this being the only method for me to pass along my concerns.<br /><br />Other people here on Amazon have expressed similar security concerns over similar issues with this application but what bothers me even more than simply this application's problems is the process by which Google vets an application as there is most definitely something wrong with this process.<br /><br />Arguably, one of the reasons people choose Android over iOS (Apples iPhone operating system) is that Android provides much more latitude towards developers and their applications which results in giving users more freedom than what Apple allows for and there is a case to be made for this.  There is a dark side to this and you're reading about an example of exactly that.<br /><br />This is one case that I can point to where Apples process to scrutinize applications certainly excels over Google's.  For an app to use another system's username and password as a means to locate that computer is so incredibly insecure and ludicrous that I find it hard to believe.<br /><br />The bottom line is this:  stay very far away from this application.<br /><br />I have had many issues with Google and Android since I adopted it over a year ago now.<br /><br />My concerns at this point is that Android is very far from being a secure operating system as to allow these types of security issues to go unaddressed is extraordinary.  This isn't a minor oversight, by the way.  This is how this application functions - in other words it's not a bug or isolated and obscure incident.  Every application has these issues as does every operating system.  But to see such a complete and blatant disregard for security I, again, find it simply astonishing.<br /><br />I have another year left on my AT&T contract before I can purchase a new phone and I will be running - not walking to get away from Android and back to iOS.<br /><br />I have other concerns outside the scope of this particular issue and these lie with performance and operating system stability - but that's a whole different story for another day.re freedom than what Apple allows for and there is a case to be made for this.

B007A4SDCG|5.0|A smart and brutally honest book about the resistance faced by anyone trying to be their larger self through artistic expression, entrepreneurship, or spiritual practice.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Rating this soon because the game offers repair points to do so.  It's a straightforward version of missile command with the addition of upgrades to missile speed, size, storage number.  Fairly well done.
0783240287|5.0|Wonderful production. Beautiful score, fabulous costumes, terrific choreography and sensational cast.<br />Highly entertaining. Buy it. You will love it. It is a winner!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Thus game is fun to play when you have spare time and is great fun for all the family<br />So have fun playing and interacting with your own virtual horse
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|WOW! THIS app works exactly like it says! I can finally download files to my Kindle Fire from my computer quickly and over WiFi.  Using the cable to computer isn't as easy as this is to use. I was actually looking for something for my iPhone when I came across this for my Kindle. Thank you for a most awesome app!  Also, like others have mentioned, just exit through the menu...the three vertical dots at the top.
B005D9MUWY|1.0|How hard is it to put an OPTION to disable the auto space? Our natural instinct is to type space after a comma and period. Why are you programmers so stubborn? Are you trying to turn us into incompetent people like you who think pressing an extra key will kill humanity? This problem has been here since 2011! I wouldn't trust these stubborn people with the cloud service. Who knows what they'll do to the messages we type. You know where I'm going with this? Yeah, I am now disabling the cloud backup service. And I am also going back to stock android keyboard until these stubborn people start listening to the population.
B004XANKVO|5.0|I'm a Dj and this bag has been very handy! I haven't run into any problems! I use it every day (especially on the weekends with a busy wedding season). I love all of the compartments for hard drives and cords/ protective case for your phone or sunglasses is really nice too! I like the fact that it also has an Ipad pouch.<br /><br />I would recommend this bag for anybody who plans on transporting their computer gear around on a constant basis! No regrets with this purchase! :) It's also very professional looking. Great Backpack!
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I'm 71 and my wife and I have been married for 46 years. We read the book together and worked on the exercises together. Even after 46 years we learned a lot and really enjoyed the book. I highly recommend it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|its a good way to entertain the little ones. great for long car rides. gives then a sense of responsibility
B007N8RULO|5.0|Great game. Works well. I like how you can just tap a card to move it instead of dragging it over. The ads are annoying but they're only between games. Unfortunately, I think all free games have ads nowadays, so that's unavoidable.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Simple, enjoyable, fun - nice throwback to retro arcade gaming. An s-pen helps a lot! Ability to reassess point distribution would be nice.
B00640UICA|4.0|I just downloaded as free app of day. Not sure yet. Don't feel I love it b it I keep playing. Still too early in game for me to know for sure. Think it has possibilities. Lol
B003UESJHY|5.0|Thought this was well thought out and excellent!  I wish he would still be batman in the new movie!  Highly recommend it!
B00A8ECU24|1.0|was a cute game at first. then you reach a point where you can't advance without spending money. and after the update yesterday it wont even open.
B003INBNXO|5.0|Love the action in the movie and needed to increase my DVD collection!  Nothing like some good martial arts to make the day go by!
B0083I90HU|5.0|This book was incredible.  It made me laugh and cry and there were many, many times when I was so caught up in the action that it was very hard to put it down.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|Love the action in the movie and needed to increase my DVD collection!  Looking forward to the 2nd one when it comes out!
B004J4WKTW|3.0|Seems redundant. An unusual imagination but is a little far fetched,unrealistic. The plot is dragged out too long and the characters are vague.
B003FXXNH6|5.0|Love the action in the movie and needed to increase my DVD collection!  Nothing like some good martial arts to make the day go by!
1401235417|5.0|Great book, An enjoyable read. Was expecting something great and got it. You really can't beat a good batman story.
B004I1AGTM|5.0|Love the action in the movie and needed to increase my DVD collection!  Nothing like some good martial arts to make the day go by!
B00AO2P3GA|1.0|i don't like this game because for some reason i can not purchase anything in it. it's so frustrating and weird?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Love the action in the movie and needed to increase my DVD collection!  By far the best Marvel movie in a long time!!
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|This book confirmed what I always suspected.  Jesus didn't intend to make us Christians.  He just wanted to make us better Jews.  It was St. Paul and all the good converts around Rome who set up our religion.  However, Jesus must have been something special to God; otherwise, he would have been forgotten along with all the other &#34;messiahs&#34; who were preaching at the same time.
B005DJREJS|4.0|It reminded me of Glee, a little -- these really worldly-wise high schoolers who seem to have no moral direction living through awkward situations.  The acting was good and Jenna was funny.  If I had teens at home, I wouldn't allow them to watch it as all the sexual freedom just looked like normal teen behavior and I really hope that is not the case.  Still, it was entertaining -- a good show for an adult who is mature enough to understand the difference between mindless entertainment and acceptable real-life behavior.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Fun game. Simple controls. Easy to understand. Takes longer to write review than learn how to play. Needed three more words.
B004H4XI5O|5.0|Very entertaining and enjoyable--envelopes you into the world of memory experts. I have learned a lot about how to keep from forgetting important information.
0385523394|5.0|After watching the first season of the &#34;Orange is the New Black&#34; TV show on Netflix, I simply had to purchase and read this book. The show's plot is incredible and intricate, and this book did not disappoint. Kerman has storytelling down to an art, and her descriptions and feelings jumped off the page. She truly captures the raw emotion and experience of prison life and sporadically addresses prison reform in a way that doesn't feel like you're reading a persuasive essay.<br /><br />I had some experience with prison life prior to the show and the book -- as a young journalist, I interviewed female inmates in a federal prison in Missouri for a story about recidivism, and my uncle did seven years in federal prison on the same type of charge Kerman received. The book's narrative helped me better understand their plights, and the fears and frustrations associated with doing hard time. Perhaps these reasons are related to why I enjoyed the book so much, and why it stirred such powerful emotions in me. Regardless, I think anyone who reads this will experience similar feelings.<br /><br />The book, although a quick read, will stick with me for a very long time.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I found that this calculator is very handy.  It has large numbers and the great memory feature is very helpful.
B000OVLINI|5.0|Having just returned from a trip to Barcelona, this book really captivated me. It is a wonderful story. Held my interest throughout
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game! If you like bingo and playing the slot machines you will love this bingo blitz game!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game has really good animation, keeps you playing for MORE bananas! It's quite addicting. There are levels for everyone :)
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|A great overview of the events surrounding the life of Jesus.  Great historical perspective. ...This is a very informative and engaging book which makes the reader vividly picture the time of Jesus and circumstances that led to Christianity
B0012NO316|5.0|This movie is a Must See. In a time when most \\"modern\\" movies find the plot and acting taking a distant back seat to overwhelming effects and digital wizardry, this classic relies totally on the extraordinary performances of 4 artists and very skillful directing and editing. With no huge cast of thousands of digitized androids and the lack of an ear shattering soundtrack to numb the viewers mind, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf draws one into the complicated and dysfunctional lives of four characters, each fighting their own demons while verbally and at times physically, flailing on each other. It is not light, mindless viewing and can extract an emotional toll from the audience which in itself is a testament to the superb work of the principles. While there are many very talented actors in the industry today, it would be an impossible task to select a cast equal to these four stellar performers from among them.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This game was both fun and as I progressed through levels it got quite challenging as well. It brought back good memories of many long hours spent at the arcade.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|this book is great! everything works and its true! I highly recommend it. we should all study this stuff and practice it in our lives
B0094K1MH2|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. It had lots of action and suspense and the animation is superb. It's not just a cartoon and everyone in the family can enjoy it.
B001BANK32|5.0|I liked it.  Thank you,  much different from the movie which was good.  Definitely going to read more Steven king books.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|My kids love this game and play it often. I think games like this challenge their minds so I feel it's a good way to keep them alert and thinking.
B005UDD1R6|1.0|I installed this app in order to display a slide show created as an MP4 video file by Windows Live Movie Maker. It complained that it was unable to display the video format. I immediately uninstalled it as it was at that point worthless to me.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Reminds me a bit of Sports Night, not in topic, but dialogue and pacing.<br /><br />A mix of comedy and drama, well balanced between the two.
B00000J7J4|5.0|This is one of SANTANA'S best CD's. You can tell why it was a GRAMMY winner. They distinctive style shines at its best. For the SANTANA fan or for those who want to become one. I highly recommend this CD!
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|My husband and I were pleasantly surprised when we sat down to watch Dr. Who with our three sons. We thoroughly enjoyed the entire first season and are on to season two.
0131988425|4.0|I didn't look into the content of this book too much. It was a required textbook for one of my auditory classes but as for the paper quality of the book it is OK. The pages smell a little bit but acceptable.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very realistic .  Good family fun.  Time killer.  I did get stuck in the app.  Had to delete and reinstall and that was no fun.  I am writing this to get 3 gems.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|By this time, I don't think there would be anyone who wouldn't know about Sherlock Holmes. This book encompasses the first adventures of Sherlock Holmes and is quite a good read.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Game is absolutely amazing, especially today when it's free.I spent whole night playing it. I really prevent it, when it will cost 99c too
0062278096|5.0|When I lived in US,I couldn't get it. And I couldn't find it in any book stores where I could go.<br />So I bought Jpanese version on net,howwever it wasn't fun for me.<br /><br />When I found it ,I felt happy.<br />Finally I got it !
B00BR0SGN0|4.0|Having loved Deep Purple for decades, I was heartened to hear the new release.  I dont write many reviews, but because of my affection for the band and their return to form, I wanted to plug them.<br /><br />Great album.  Buy it.  Can I give you the message any more succinctly.
B001NFNFF8|4.0|While it doesn't do justice to the book, it is still a very good watch. As usual, Tommy Lee Jones does a great job, without him it would have received a lesser rating.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|Utterly addicting, once you start playing you become hooked forever. You want to build each section as quickly as possible so the Fairies can finally have a complete home.
B0029F21BA|5.0|Clint Eastwood does it again. This is a great flick, with a stellar cast. Everything about this was done right - from the story line to the direction. The cast hit their parts perfectly without overdoing it. One super movie!
B00CDT41RY|5.0|This was a funny movie.. I couldn't stop laughing at the gore. it seem like just every gun shot exploded. Entertained me well
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Deleted all my data on the recent update, just like Subway Surfers.<br />Giving this a low review for this reason.<br />This is arse.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|As a nurse, I loved the story and do so agree with a patient's right to decide when he or she has had enough.
B00064VR0W|5.0|I love it from beginning to the end<br />a nice selection of songs<br /> I really enjoy it I play it about once a week
B005XQLBU4|4.0|My kids love it. Game play is good for them gets a little hard for my youngest though then his brother takes over keep them coming.
B002PEP4U0|5.0|This book will change the way you will look at the hardships in your life. In the end hard work and determination come out on top as author William Kamkwamba tells in this inspiring story of his life. Overall a very good read and well worth your time.
B000VYX8PE|4.0|I think that this book was very interesting. And that it is never gonna have a good ending which makes it even cooler. And if you don't like books where terrible things happen to them don't read It.....
B006QLH7O4|5.0|Dvd review<br />great condition and quality was very good very satisfied would recomend to all..i loved it...also a great movie to waych
B0034EEE2E|4.0|I heard this while road tripping with my brother. Got home and bought it. Its good...but it is not great.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I can't get enough! Fun to play and fun room themes. New credits to stock up on everyday. One of my favorite apps!
B00138F080|4.0|This is a good album, although there are a couple of songs that are a bit obnoxious. Still like it.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|The story line itself is quite clever and engaging.  The characters are fairly well constructed and believable.  Kind of a page turner -- at some parts of the story I found it difficult to put it down.  The ending (or I should say, the run up to the sequel) was a little disappointing and abrupt.  But a very nice effort from a fairly unknown author.
B006Z1XY7E|4.0|This album is good.  I bought it for &#34;somebody that I used to know&#34;  I coulda just turned the radio on because its always on
B005HJWWW8|5.0|Unbelievably Great Sound when using<br />Sennheiser HD 598 Headphones (Burl Wood Accents)<br />and Sansa MP3 Clip.<br /><br />I just ordered another to give as a gift.
B0058VW36U|4.0|I recently downloaded this for my six year old son.  He REALLY likes trying to figure out how to solve each level on the game.  I give it a four simply because it is one of those games that can be repetitive after he's done it for a while.  He still thinks it's fun and will go back to it time and time again though.<br /><br />Since we don't have the account backed up with payment (it's on a wifi only device), we haven't run into the purchase problems that others have noted.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Reminds me of the Atari classic.  Much more enjoyable on a touch screen. And at a great price (free) as the app of the day.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I didn't think much about this app when my son asked to download it.  I checked to make sure it was fine...yep, just a running game.<br /><br />A few weeks later, and we are both seriously addicted to this game.  While there are in game purchases available, there is enough you can buy with the coins you collect while running that it doesn't feel like you are being restricted (looking at you, Candy Crush Saga).<br /><br />Premise of the game;  you're being chased by a security guard and his dog after tagging a train car.  I'm glad my son is too young to realize that's what's happening in the beginning.  Otherwise, you simply run and jump and try to go around obstacles.  You can also buy hoverboards and work through challenges to earn extra abilities and point multipliers.<br /><br />Overall, great fun!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Very beautifully written story of family, friends, time, struggles and re-connections.  The weaving together of main and minor characters across time and geography creates an intricate pastiche that keeps you engaged and involved in the story.  I wish there had been a family tree to remind me of some of  the players.
B008MEM24S|4.0|My son LOVES this game! He's a huge fan of Phineas and Ferb (which I think has to be one of the best shows for kids going, btw), so we got this to try it out. We ended up buying the full version because he loved it so much! He also has Where's My Water (we got that after this one), so he has lots of practice. He also loves the comments that the characters from P&F interject while he's playing the game.
B00004XPPC|5.0|I have had this movie given to me a few years ago and my father asked to borrow it. I found a copy on Amazon and ordered it for him. He was very happy when it arrived. Now he can watch it whenever he wants.
B000ZLFALS|5.0|This movie has it all a great story, great music, great performances it even has some action and some romance! It truly is just a great movie!!!
B008EKMB82|5.0|This novel engages both your heart and mind. It's a wonderful journey of discovery as you get to know the two narrators and try to envision how and whether their stories will converge. It really makes you think about living your life and caring for those around you. You should so read it!
B005XQLBU4|1.0|This looks like a game I would love to play, but when I install it, I get a virus threat alert! Fix this, and it'll probably get 5 stars after that!
B0058VW36U|5.0|My daughter really likes this game and it is even challenging for me! It makes you think about how to maneuver something in order to obtain the goal.
B009LQKHIO|1.0|Unfortunately, this book reads as if it were written by semi-literate seventh grader. I made it about a tenth of the way through the book when I just couldn't read further. The story was broken, choppy and completely uninteresting. If that wasn't  enough, it was also either not edited at all,  or edited badly. I'm just glad it was free. I'm not a writer, but I'm pretty sure I could write a better story while drunk, sleep-deprived, and after having been lobotomized. Sorry, but don't waste your time on this!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|She enjoys &#34;winning&#34; new characters when she gains a lot of points. I liked having the free points to get the game!
B000IKQK7E|5.0|I had forgotten how entertaining this movie was, if you have not seen it recently ikt is a must watch.
B004RJMUJO|4.0|This is really a blast especially if you play against each other.  Kids love to make a mess and this game makes that happen when you slice up all of that fruit and it gets plastered against the wall!!
B000W453KQ|5.0|Awesome movie. Saw it for the first time in 2013 and although it's very old it's still a great movie. I'm a guy.
B003M6EAXM|5.0|Ended up better that I thought is was going to based on the way it started - Jack gets sucked back in, just when he thought he was out.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I loved this book! One of the best YA fiction series out there! I couldn't put it down!<br />Didn't see a lot of the shockers coming so it took me by surprise! I loved the character development & how well written it was.
B004LROUW2|5.0|Don't know the genera of this book, but its another well written thought provoking work by Murakami. Don't miss it.
0399162097|1.0|The author appears to not really be a part of the story.  The thought process of the author appears very confused.  Why would such a badly written book appear on a \\"Best Seller List\\"?  It appeared to me she felt above the reader in wit and intellect.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This game is awesome I recommend it to all minecraft lovers!<br /><br />Pros:<br />Multiplayer<br />Hackable (pocketinveditor pro)<br />Chat<br />Fancy graphics<br />And all sorts of other jazz<br /><br />Cons:<br />Slow updates<br />Bugs<br />Still missing LOTS of blocks<br /><br />But still a great game so I'll give it a 4 star
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I don't get as many bingo's since l updated, and the jewels in daily tournament are impossible to get. Other than that good game.
B007AL48UK|5.0|I play Mahjong so it's nice to have a variety of layouts and designs. Love this game! It's very addicting.
B0037Z8SLI|3.0|It's a great idea but I don't feel like this should be a book. Maybe a paper? Nevertheless it is well written and the examples of the checklist working and not working really drive the point home.
B001AUEMFS|5.0|I really love this song but I love it with the video even more!  Coldplay rocks!  See the video on youtube.
1476733953|4.0|I don't write a whole lot of reviews, but this particular book stood out for me. I'm an avid reader, and I'll read most anything that tells a good story...  but my favorite books are those that are dark, that focus on the human element of desperation, that don't sugar-coat things and don't talk about flowers and have everyone live (and not die) happily ever after. This is one of those books. It's so poignant you can taste it.  If you like the introspectiveness of Chuck Palahniuk books, if you like the worlds and characters of Neil Gaiman stories and just a hint of H.G. Wells (and Orson Wells, for that matter) this is a book for you.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|A lot of fun. Brought back a lot of memories from my childhood. I suggest upgrading middle capacity, speed and duration.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is an awesome game. I can express my creativity and I can build almost anything I want! Its just awesome(:
B008QE9XD2|5.0|I saw this movie on cable several times already. The movie is quite entertaining. Johnny Depp was spot on and hilarious as stiff dry Barnabas. And for once, the freaky makeup worked. He isn't supposed to look robust and healthy. Eve Green was terrific and sexy as evil witch Angelique. In spite of the violence and some scary moments, the movie was relatively light. There were a lot of deadpan funny scenes as Barnabas adjusts to life in the 1970s. I wish there was a scene in which Barnabas interacted with Alice Cooper. Other than that, the movie had a nice soundtrack, looked great and had some genuinely funny moments.
0553582038|5.0|Loved the books, love the TV version so far.  However, I was disappointed that it would cost me $2.99 for every episode.  I believe the price should include the whole season.  I have decided to add the DVD option to Netflix so that I can watch the series for $7.99 per month.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|This was an excellent installment of the Star Trek series that brought together some of the plots and situations from the earlier films but with a fresh approach that kept the film moving along and never boring or contrite. Would recommend it to anyone!
B004DMIIOG|5.0|This is a great anime and brought faith that you can make one that is family oriented where the family seems very real they have problems but there doing the best they can not everyone's bad or good it's just life and what's truly important. This anime gets my 5 star seal of approval which doesn't happen much anymore.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|I love this show. It is like an X-Files for the next generation. I haven't been able to stop watching it!
B005WMQ5R8|3.0|I got redline cause of the price and curiosa about it it has good elements great animation but doesn't deliver I would love to say this is like a wanna be Akira but it's not still worth a watch but you'll see more potential the substance.
B005H9B2CE|5.0|Only issue is Amazon prime wouldn't allow me to stream HD.  My brand new Mitsubishi television wasn't on the eligible tv list.  What's up with that amazon???
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I knew this would be great and I'm not disappointed!!  The creator's have done a fab job again.  I love them all so keep them coming!!!!
B0063IH60K|3.0|its pritty good but to Manny aaadddsss if it was my game there would be no adds at all not even an inch
B008RA3X5E|5.0|As I always have my kindle when I travel and this is great to take no matter were you go. The alarm is easy to set and having the weather for the day helps me plan out some of my days activities.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Easy to start gets more challenging. Fun and addictive minimum words why ehy hhh and addictive the first gets more than a year ago by a year ago by an average of the first time in the first time in the first time in the first time since
B004DLPXAO|3.0|Its really pretty hard to read on a phone. But I guess in a pinch. Kindle is reliable! But I like it on my apple better!
B00CWY76CC|1.0|No instructions on how to start.  Too basic and boring.  Played it for less than 10 minutes.  Not really impressed.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This app is nice to listen to when falling asleep or just relaxing. Also great when you are reading or doing active meditation! Its well worth the purchase!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|fsawesome game real dummy six yr old sis loves it<br />fun fun fun fun so fun I play in the. bath plus baths r boring
B001GCUNYO|5.0|The storyline will keep you on the edge of your seat! The Characters, the story, the chase and the excitement makes you feels as if you're right there amidst the action!
B000ZP9PYM|5.0|I have owned several crocs, from the fleece lined crocs to the sneakers, but these are the most comfortable crocs. They are accurate in their sizing but not too tight that I cannot put on a thick pair of socks in the winter months for warmth.
B004KPLVW2|5.0|Stop to think of the year in which this movie was made. Years ahead of it's time! The FX are comparable to the movies of today with all the CGI magic!
B004YW4L5K|5.0|I loved the adult descriptive writing!!!  The theme of lost souls (translate gods) looking for their previous adulation was enthralling.  One of the very best SciFi reads ever.
0064471837|5.0|A wonderful introduction to the Abhorsen trilogy, Sabriel contains wonderful world building, a tightly plotted storyline, lovely pacing, and memorable characters. I consider it one of the best in the young adult fantasy genre, and it is a great read for anyone who enjoys fantasy stories with female heroines.<br /><br />This is a novel which contains a female character who is strong, but still retains her femininity. Too often a work that contains a strong female lead focuses overly on her doing \\"manly\\" things. Sabriel does not fall into this trap at all, but rather contains a strong leading character who happens to be female, who does things that are suited to her talents and isn't overcoming her \\"physical weakness\\" to become better than men (looking at you, Tortall trilogy).<br /><br />All in all, an often overlooked novel that deserves more attention than it gets.
B003UMW68Y|5.0|I would say that the title of my review should pretty much sell this movie to anyone, but I have been wrong before. If that doesn't do it, then the songs, animation, or voice-acting should pull you into this almost legendary movie.<br /><br />Also, if you grew up with it like I did and now you have kids, get it for your kids and keep the legend growing.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Got it on the free app of the day. So far so good. Fun throwback. No ads every five seconds. Cool so far. Good timewaster
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My children and I love this game!!!!!!! So addicting!!!!! Love how there are tons of missions to complete. Keeps us occupied for hours!!!!!!
B0046B3QTG|5.0|My husband and I decided to watch this movie after watching several Despicable Me 2 trailers. It is a great family movie and we can't wait to see Despicable Me 2!
B0035LGXXO|5.0|cool movie to watch it brought back memories.  However I hope I didn't purchase anything, I thought it was free.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is awesome. It is brilliant, with awesome villains,cool costumes, and awesome places like El Macho's liar, residential area, and Gru's lab.
B000WEMH3C|4.0|This is a standard cove nothing fancy.  If I get 2 years out of it I will be happy.  It will serve its purpose and that is to stop the rain from turning this into a rust bucket.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|The kind of book you read straight to the end! Good read, real truth! For me, I will sum-up this book like an artist, in a Jim Rohns words: &#34;Work harder on yourself, than you do on your job!&#34;.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Very Smooth Game Play, Upgradeable Missiles, Better Than The Original.  Pleasant Graphics....All OF Which Work Much Better ThanThIs Stupid Amazon ReviewInterface.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|It's the funniest defender game I've ever played on the kindle fire my sisters might get this game too so I think they will enjoy it too
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I love how easy it was to setup. Literally in less than 5 minutes I was streaming from my tablet to our Sony TV. We don't have a very fast internet service either, 10 Mbps download and 2 Mbps upload and the movies stream perfectly, no hiccups or buffering.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Oh my goodness I love this game it is so addicting! It seems so life like....everything is just so pretty and I just love it!!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Good game. I didn't know how I would like it. Now I can't stop playing it any time I get the chance.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|This Doctor Who Tenth Sonic Screwdriver is simply amazing!<br />I had recently got into Doctor Who, and watching the show, and when my friend, who also watches Doctor Who, comes around carrying the eleventh Sonic Screwdriver, oh boy, did I want one!! I really favored the Tenth Sonic Screwdriver, so I looked if they sold some, and sure enough, they did!<br />so after purchasing this product, I was thrilled of how much detail went into it!<br />I had been running around the house, blazing my blue light, and enjoying the noise it makes!<br /><br />Pros<br />-the blue light is very bright!<br />-the four noises it makes are spectacular!<br />-invisible ink is very well hidden, and well, invisible until you shine the Screwdriver's light on it<br />-interchangeable pen and invisible ink nubs<br />-LOTS of detail!!!<br />-the Sonic Screwdiver extends!<br />(to extend it you slide up the button on the side)<br />-comfortable to hold!<br /><br />Cons<br />NONE!!
B008XG1X18|3.0|I love pinterest but pinterest app on kindle fire is frustrating! keeps force closing, freezes and stalls. I have uninstalled and done factory reset didn't help. please fix!
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Started playing the game walks couldn't put it down. Have good times challenging family and friends to get the high score.
B007O4XX9K|5.0|As a fan of Joe Walsh from the old James Gang days in the 60s, I recognize the superior quality of analog when properly applied by an analog man. Nuff said.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I very much enjoy game this game. Fun for the whole family. If you enjoy playing SIM games. Then you will enjoy this. Turn you city into your masterpiece.
B006PZBR8S|5.0|This is the ultimate popcorn movie. It is 100% entertainment. There is nothing challenging about this movie. It doesn't require much, if any thought and it is colorful and exciting. All movies should be like \\"Real Steel\\"
B005ILYWN2|5.0|This is one of those movies that you either love or hate,  Granted, it looks like it was filmed with very cheap equipment, but it's a lot better than The Blair Witch Project!  If I had to classify this strange little film, I would call it a comedy.  There are two places I will never forget because they made me laugh out loud!  I watched it again with my daughter and my grandson and they guffawed at those two exact places.  So.  Two things to laugh at, eh?  What good is that?  Here's what else you get:  A great plot, a great cast, a director/editor team who know exactly how to keep you on the edge of your seat even though they have already made it clear that this is not a monster-movie per se.  To really enjoy it, you have to have a keen sense of the bizarre.  And a sense of humor - oh my yes!
B009C7ZQM4|1.0|I used this app and I can no longer watch YouTube seeing as the clean matter cleaned out the video player thing, it messed with my kindle fire and I can no longer do certain things anymore=((
B003Y5H4SO|4.0|Quite a sleeper.  Every twist and turn is pretty much unexpected.  It's most assuredly a one butt cheek movie, as you will end up on the edge of your chair!  Very well done.  Someone obviously put a great deal of thought into the making of it.  Highly recommend watching it if your into scary.  BTW, it is not a blood, gore, guts and special effects type scary movie.  They did a real nice job without having to rely upon all of that superfluous nonsense.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|I really enjoyed this game puzzle if I could not figure it out I would come back later and get it so am sad it is done I want more.
B005K01VZS|5.0|Could not put this book down And to think it is all true  looking forward to his next book. The stories touch your heart and leave you thinking
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|Great graphics, constantly something to do and goals to achieve. Can't believe it's free! You won't regret down leading this game
B00BQI4AU6|4.0|Tom Keifer has not lost a beat.  He has always been a great song writer and his singing not changed.  Him and his wife great team.  The songs although ten years in the making are great.  Loved listening to it and worth buying and hearing over and over.  Now if he and the rest of Cinderella can bring on a new album/
B0050DZ8J0|1.0|It's not possible to update your profile, post company updates, add services,share an update with your groups.A full app like Facebook full would be appreciated.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|A really great game.  It's super fun for everyone and much better then the other versions. Definitely a great game to play.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|Great game i enjoy playing it , it gives me a challenge and its good to know what you might be good especially of you wanna know your emojis
B005KITK6C|5.0|My grandson loved it. I would order it again . It is easier than shopping at the store and not being able to find what you are looking for.
B00CA4S37Q|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies.  If you love the first boondock saints you will love this one.  Highly recommend.
1401941893|3.0|Miranda has a lot of good thoughts in this book and so this book is good for someone looking to improve their thoughts.  The second half of the book is made up of affirmations - one quote per page.  I would have preferred if these affirmations were removable so I could tear out the cards and take them with me.  There is also nice artwork in the book - flowers and animals.  The book was a good self-help book but not my favorite.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I cant put this game down i love it it is totally worth getting it is intense prob a little hard for a kid but hey you never know
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|It was a great lesson and the story line was great overall I have enjoyed reading this book thank you
B000BCE918|5.0|If you don't totally adore Jurassic Park then...well. I don't know what to say! These are nostalgic trips down memory lane. The original film was absolutely groundbreaking and has proven itself to be a timeless classic. NEVER gets old- and it's just as exciting the next ten times you watch it. The second and third films are a lot of fun for when you need some more raptor chases- of course. Plus Jeff Goldblum and Sam Neil. What more do you need in life?
B005ZMUXDC|5.0|Now we have on our Kindles and they can watch it anytime. It was so easy to download and to share.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|It kept me at the edge of my seat. I never knew what to expect next. I just couldn't pt it down and i immediately purchased the second book. I just have to know how this ends!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love playing bingo blitz. I play several bingo games,and this is by far, my favourite. I only wish we got more credits so I could play more!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Simple but brought back a lot of good Atari memories.  Missile command 2.0!  No problems with any malware or virus notices yet.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Good Missle Command clone.  The touch user interface is perfect.  It's a bit on the easy side.  Easily worth the price.
B001AQO3QA|4.0|Good quality packaging. A few baubles of extras. (Though the director's commentary soundtrack deserves mention). Good quality picture and sound. And an excellent series to set on your shelf for an evening when you want to remind yourself why you spring for those big speakers and that flat panel the size of a corner office window.
B005XQLBU4|1.0|Free on Google Play, without the possible malware add ons. (at least so far). It looks like the same thing. These are extra words to get beyond the minimum 20 words.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Good story and even though there is some drama, there are funny parts and good ending. Loved the Kenny G  part, poor Kenny.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoyed playing this game alot. It's  one of those that are not too easy and not too hard either, just one that is fun, relaxing and a rather enjoyable game to play when your wanting to wind down at the end of your day.
B0046B3QTG|5.0|This movie was fun for kids and adults alike.  The streaming quality to my TiVO Premiere was fine.  Highly recommended.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Great game.  It has good graphics and good hidden object.  It is a very good game to play.  You need to play this game.  It is also a free game.  If you want to play other games stick with G5.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|Great thought provoking book. I recommend it to every college freshman. Gives you a new spin on what dedicated life's work is really about.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Nostalgia revamped. Feels right the speed of the missiles and your despair when you see your buildings going down, just like the old one.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|hours of fun for the entire family, downloaded for our son, but I found my husband plays it more than our 6 year old
B00CX7OX6U|4.0|Terrence's movie has this quality that is mesmerizing when done in the right context. The score, the inner thoughts, it usually works. But in this version, I couldn't stop thinking of those Calvin Klein commercials. You know the one.. ETERNITY...The long version.  I was tempted to give it a lower rating but out of respect for Terrence, I give it a 4 stars just in case I come back and watch it again and might actually like and understand what he was trying to do in this movie.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Fun, great game play. Very addictive, can't put it down. Glad it was a free app for a day. Thanks amazon appstore
B004HWYTP4|4.0|I enjoyed this movie overall.  Kept me entertained throughout.  Good cast of characters, with decent humor scattered throughout.  In the beginning, I was wondering if this was going to be a long drawn out movie, as it opened very slowly.  But it didn't take long to take off.  From my perspective, I was entertained.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|A simple fun game with no bugs glitches or adware present but this first day of play. Works exactly as advertised
B007SGLZP8|2.0|If I hadn't been the type to have to know what happens at the end of a book I would have given up on this not even half way through it.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|once you get invested in the characters you will end up reading far into the  night and the next day.  Enough accurate historical relevance to see the entire picture--and even though you know the good guys win; it's fascinating to watch it unfold.
B009NY43NY|3.0|I'd put off reading this bc of all the awful things I had heard about this book. While it was entertaining sort of, it just didn't follow in line with the other novels. And the end... Seriously if anyone deserves a totally and completely happy ending its sookie and we don't get the satisfaction of that. I just feel really blah.
1433535734|5.0|This is an enormous study bible.  The print was not quite large enough so I passed this to my youngest daughter and bought a truly large type.  Hurts admitting to be older.  Comes with an online ESV study bible (which I use religiously) which gives you all the references.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love to play bingo and this game keeps me interested. Can collect items everyday and daily free tournaments. Very addictive.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I heard the movie is really good.  I like to read the books before I watch the movies.  I was not disappointed.  Can't wait to read the next two books in the trilogy.
0812982622|1.0|BECAUSE it was a Pulitzer winner, i bought this book.  What a huge waste of time.  I once saw a post that read<br />\\"TOO MANY GOOD BOOKS OUT THERE TO WASTE TIME ON A BAD BOOK\\".  This is a bad book.
B0099TJ4YQ|5.0|My new favorite Christmas cd!  Nice, easy listening with a little blues on the side.  Great addition to my holiday music.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|Survivalcraft is the best game ever!! I have played it on my mom's phone(Mary is my mom). I like it more than Minecraft because 1. you can spawn animals 2. there are no monsters and 3. you can save worlds. The only bad things about it is 1. time trial 2. no pets 3. can only ride 2 animals and finally 4. there are no ocean animals you can ride.  The changes needed are 1. longer or no time trial 2. you should be able to tame wolves and coyotes into dogs. 3. add orcas, whales, and dolphins, 4. add mating/villagers and finally 5. add multiplayer
B000WACTCK|4.0|Very interesting so far, haven't finished book. THIRTEEN MORE WORDS? gimme a break. Deven more now. now 4 more. Hmmmm.
B009AMANBA|5.0|I was a great DVD and  was in great shape.  I loved it and saw it at the theater as well.  A  most informative part of our American history.  Catherine M.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|I been playing this app for 2 months and when it updated just yesterday it told me string not found, what does that mean? And it doesn't let me play! If you could help me please do.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Supremely well written. This book says things that I have thought of before about relationships. I love a good mystery and this isan interesting one!
B005OZE9SA|5.0|Since I needed to be out of the country for a while and all I would have was my laptop, I had to get an external sound card in order to do full 24-bit/192kHz DSP. This fit the bill, bought it, and it performed excellently, even the included ASIO drivers (big plus) without having to go to ASIO4ALL. Sadly, no MIDI inputs which I know is kinda meh, but for the purpose I needed it for (which was just DSP processing since my MIDI keyboard had USB support as well) it was brilliant.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I find this game fast paced and fun to play.  It is very addictive and I can't seem to put it down :)
B008J34466|5.0|Great CD and the first I ever bought by this amazing artist! She is simply wonderful<br />Rick in San Diego
B00992CF6W|5.0|mine craft pe : I don't have Pc or xbox so BOOM pops up in the app store baby 7 bucks .
B00C061I3K|5.0|Amazing album and not just the Mexican Lucky song. I even heard anothe song from the album on a San Diego station - really good!<br />Rick in San Diego
B00CWV8TIU|3.0|I thought the idea was good but a few parts were just too unbelievable for me (I won't say which parts cause it would ruin the movie).  It was still entertaining though, I just wouldn't spend the time to watch it twice.
B000007MVU|5.0|Ringo was 30-some years ahead of everyone buy releasing a standards LP. Wonderful arrangements and production by a very impressive list of producers and musicians. Ringo's humble vocals are great for the songs.
B00640UICA|5.0|Silly fun game that even my four year old can play.  He may not be able to solve the puzzles but he can have fun moving the guys around.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|mine didn't work right out of the box.  i tried setting it up several times and no go.  called google - the rep there told me that it was 'hit or miss' whether it would work with a mac which struck me as odd since it said on the box that it would.  he said until they come out with an actual mac app that it worked on some and not on others.  that seemed very odd to me but that's what he said.  rather than wait for an app to come out, i returned it immediately.  maybe mine was just defective?  i'll try it again later.
B00DU74U74|2.0|I know the subject line (not as good as the book) is very common, but in this case it's not even close to the book.  It's a different story, and not as good.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Love this.  I enjoy the time period, clothing and sets.  It has a sense of history.  Everyone is talking about season 3 on FB
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|Very silly game.  Fun if you have just a minute or two to kill.  I've only played 10 of the 50 levels but I can tell the challenge is increasing slightly per level.  I plan on playing the rest gradually.
B0033807E0|5.0|It was is the best book so far. Very interesting and intriguing. It was also very inspiring. There are diverse stories.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This game is pretty much a reskinned Missile Command from arcades and consoles of the early 80's. The only real difference besides the graphics and the touch controls is an upgrade mechanic that lets you increase your antimissiles' effectiveness.  Good game both as nostalgia and fun in general.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Not as good as book 3, but Berger than 4. Set up really well for everything to go down next book
B00CP2Z5TC|4.0|Pretty good sounds on this CD.  It is a bit different from their other music but it is still good.
B000EHQTZO|5.0|Another one of my favorites...so happy to find it on Amazon in the DVD format.  When I was young, I wished I were the damsel in distress with Kong...I'm such a sap :)
0425263924|5.0|WONDERFUL BOOK, LOVE THE DEPTH OF IT AND THE STORY BEHIND IT AND THE TWISTS AND TURNS OF IT ALL
B0055SWM08|5.0|very enjoyable game - challenging - always looking forward to the next brainbusting move :)<br />never boring - even leave the background tunes on sometimes - haven't had a problem with it<br />I already purchased another quell - cant get enough of it!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Loads of fun. I really enjoying this game. I loved the movie also. Excellent graphics. Like the way to add friends without having to know their I'd.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Nice game.  Graphics are decent.  Starts off easy and gradually gets more difficult.  Allows you to upgrade your defenses.  Recommend this game.
0823013626|5.0|Fantastic for begginers and for all. Show texture, painting, surfaces, finishing pieces... Take your time to explore all the tecniques and go further.<br />Absolutely recommended.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's loads of fun to play n the lil guys r super cute .so glad I got this game .
0823015017|5.0|I am not a very confident with colors because I have never painted, so, there was a before and after, since this book arrived to me. Fantastic, for the color explanations, for techniques, for finishing, for everything. I bought it long time ago, and I go back to it time to time. About a year after to buy the book, I had the chance to participate at a workshop with her. It was amazing.<br />Absolutely recommended.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Easiest way to keep up with the news and blogs that interest you. Good integration with social media. I use it ever day.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Played first time for about 30 minutes before I had to wait for more coins. At the carnival, that was the equivalent of spending $10 that wouldn't have lasted that long and your coins AIN'T gonna regenerate there...lol  Get this app if you like the games at the carnival!
B00E8TVHBA|5.0|My daughter absolutely loves this movie. She made me watch it too and I enjoyed it also.  Great songs! Recommend!
B00CW665VI|5.0|Great, great, great....I really enjoyed this book!!! I would recommend it to anyone that like a funny and well written story...
B005XQLBU4|4.0|It is just like the original Atari game from back the day but better.  Upgrades for weapons and you can repair your cities.
B00BVMXBVG|5.0|I was dying to get this DVD set and even got a little of my money back on it, thanks to Amazon! I love this series!!!
0679412719|5.0|Bill Clinton's favorite book and rightly so.  Meditations reinforces feelings of those ground in Stoicism and Self-Reliance.  Live a good life.  (At minimum) your accomplishments will be live and be passed on through your loved ones.
1568363931|5.0|Love this item, it's useful and helpful and has worked out great for me. I did not have to wait long to get it!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I used to play a game similar on the Atari. The game is practically the exact same game but faster.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|Love Friends! Arrived quickly, and in perfect condition. I've watched Friends for years, it just is one of those shows that doesn't get old. I am so happy to finally have the entire series!!!
B0091REZMW|4.0|I love that the items aren't always in the same place in the rooms. Makes for an actual challenge each time.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Fun<br />Fun<br />Fun<br />Ok<br />It f u n<br />Hahahahahahahahahaha in so many words I just want my 50<br />Free repair point s
B009LQKHIO|4.0|I chose this rating because I really enjoyed the book. The story moved fast and was an easy read. Sounds like a great town to live.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I bought it to take with me on a trip and devoured it before the trip began.  Enjoyed it very much.
B005XQLBU4|3.0|Good take on missile defense, and I really like the upgrade aspect of it. Being able to repair is cool, it would be neat if it was possible to unlock new foes and not just faster ones. It would also be nice to introduce a bit of variety. I played through until I died 2 or 3 times (got up to night 27) but by then it's just really repetitive - nothing changes except the speed and number of enemies and the onset of carpal tunnel.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I got this story as a gift from my son. I kept putting off reading it because I thought I knew how it would affect me. I was wrong..it was worse. Beautifully written and very moving. I would recommend this to anyone and cannot wait to read something else written by John Green.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|A tearjerker! Being a mom with two daughters makes me feel scared but cautious with day to day life... Good job Jaycee and good luck! You are an inspiration ! Tough lady...
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|A well written novel depicting the life in rural Ireland during the second half of 20th century. Just wondering whether the cruelty shown towards orphan children by the church is bit of an imagination or not. However the Author says that what is described is a true representation of the condition prevailing in Ireland.
B00EEXST2K|4.0|This movie surprised me. The structure is unlike a lot of biopics out there, which is a big reason I would encourage people to watch this movie.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Well I love the game it's amazing! ;) It's very addicting to. xD I rated 5 starts because..... if you rate one two or three stars what are you thinking? I'm only 9 years old. I have a email.. it's princessgir2004@yahoo.com! IF YOU WANNA know how to get a sun dragon... e-mail me right away!! (:
1781162646|5.0|Definitely you can never be wrong by buying a Stephen King book. This story is great; it made me nostalgic. Great to read.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|GREAT game of my life<br />I love the armors and how you can get I  China<br />And I love the war machine
0307346617|5.0|This book is great, definitely a different approach to zombie-stories from what I have read before. If yow saw the movie you'll know it doesn't have much to do with the book, just the title and a few anecdotes. If you haven´t seen the movie you should, cause it's good too. Just don't expect it to be related to the book. I'll be waiting for the next Max Brooks' novel.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I especially enjoyed this trilogy, though at times it felt very Twilight-like, without the vampires and werewolves and plus lots of sex and then some!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|plays just like missile command, but with upgrades! download this ap now! woot woot! Hump day! blah blah blah blah
B009C7JS14|4.0|I just got the app going to try for a while I 'll try it for the week and give it probably give it a 5 star will see
142314189X|5.0|I loved the series. I recommend the book to everybody, but especially people who love mythology and fantasy books.  They are great for kids as well adults. My teachers and parents love the series. I gave it 5 stars because they are incredible books.  I honestly don't know what i would do with out them.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This second book of the Hunger Games is another great book by Suzanne Collins. I love the part where Katniss tells Finnick that she found a way to make him pretty again.
B00BJ64FU0|4.0|having read many of these earlier in my life it is exciting to read them after the viewing the current BBC productions.
B005XQLBU4|3.0|The game does have the look and feel of the original, although the game play is different. Upgrades and repairs makes it easier. Touch screen and the ability to use two hands and not a trackball makes gameplay vastly different from the original. I guess trackball control would be challenging on a touch screen. Overall, a decent game.
B00BB3UYS8|4.0|This book kept me wanting to read more... find out what was going to happen next. A good read for everyone.
B00A27X972|3.0|This is a nice easy read but I expected more in regards to how an alien would compare our culture, technology, economics, morals, etc. to his culture, technology, etc.  Mr. Haig does make some fleeting, thin comparisons between his world and ours but far short of my expectations.  Perhaps Mr. Haig intended this novel to be so shallow in which case my approach to this read was way off.  I can't help but think of &#34;My Favorite Martian&#34; of 50's television fame when I read this novel.  In fairness, I haven't completed the read, but I'm quickly losing interest.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|Great game. Really fun and intresting. I loved how the game lets you play online with other people around the world
B009KS4XRO|4.0|It doesn't need a constant supply of money in order to enjoy a little amusement with accomplishments and rewards for continuing
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I absolutely love supernatural. Sam and dean are funny and intense. Highly recommend this for others. But make sure you watch it from the beginning or you won't understand.
B002WY64HA|5.0|In my opinion their best album. The lyrics are so well written that the fact that their very personal works as well. It is very easy to identify to every song, since the subjects are very simple (love and death) but universal. All the instrumentation in the background makes for a very easy listening, but brings pleasant surprises when listening very closely. Pressing is not perfect, but it is very good. Definitely worth buying on vinyl.
0321934318|5.0|This is an excellent product. I knew this before I ordered the book. Easy to understand, and full of killer tips.
B007GE2H3G|5.0|Even though this was an animated movie you soon forgot as it was a very well written movie and the characters were very well displayed!  I enjoyed it immensely!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|If you decide to include a knife in your EDC it makes sense to have a sharpener for it.  Smith's has been making knife sharpeners since 1886 and knows their business.  In my EDC bag I carry their compact sharpener to make sure that my knives always have a sharp edge.<br /><br />This is a must have if you valuse having a sharp, ready to use knife.<br /><br />That's why I recommend it my book [[ASIN:B00DW99VYM Duct Tape and Paracord - a DIY Disaster Survival Guide]].
B009WUAK2M|4.0|I enjoyed this action packed movie from start to finish!  It kept me involved and each character captivated you including the woman!  Very impressive!
B00CATSONE|5.0|I have always heard the name 'Tesla ' pop up in conversation. Not knowing his story, I wanted to learn who he really was. This book did more than tell his story. It helped me understand how to inspire my two (very smart) boys to aspire to greatness. Thank you for the inspiration and imagination.
B0063GORYU|3.0|I have not won a game yet but keep trying. It is an unusual game and I probably need to keep trying.
B00APYKXFS|2.0|To me this app is boring, and I don't see the point in why they made an app like this, seriously, techno trancer?
1452101248|5.0|This book is so thoughtfully indexed, laid out, and photographed.  The recipes are superb.  As an avowed foodie, I couldn't be happier.  It's like reading and relishing a great novel.  I highly recommend it.  It's top quality on all levels.
B007D2XSW0|3.0|It's a good app but I think they should add more to it, it's good with changing pictures and removing any blemishes, sort of like Photoshop but a little different. It's a good app and I think that anyone who is interested in photography should get this app.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Game was enjoying while still challenging at the same time. Would recommend for anyone who likes these kind of games.
B009ME47H2|2.0|When you record your voice it sounds like if you used  a camera to record your voice. It's an okay app.
B004KBSQBA|5.0|Paul Simon did it again. Every song he writes, every album he produces is just fantastic. The man is a musical genius.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|As any other calculator I think this one is great as well. It records any past calculations and helps you with any mathematical problems.
B000WAEJZ0|5.0|I have always liked Whitney Houston's music but never owned any of her albums. After she died, I purchased her &#34;Ultimate Collection&#34; so that I could appreciate her exceptional talent any time. This album does not disappoint; it contains tracks of her most memorable tunes, recorded when she was at her best.<br />I recommend &#34;Ultimate Collection&#34; to anyone who appreciates Ms. Houston's melodious voice.
B00DIFARQ6|2.0|When I tried flying through the hoops the wind kept pushing me the other way, it's easy to control on the first round but not so much on the second.
B004TPJMLA|5.0|I bought this CD to replace the cassette tape I owned because cars no longer come with tape players. I love Paul Simon's music so I may just be prejudiced in my review. My advice is, buy music you like.
B009GXHOW4|2.0|I did not like this app at all because as soon a  I got it it ruined the whole minecraft experience for me. Sure it can give you unlimited things in survival mode but I didn't like it that much.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use Evernote daily for personal and work stuff I want to keep track of. Its well designed and makes it easy to create or edit content on one device (pics, screenshots, writing, web pages) and then retrieve and use it on another. You store stuff in &quot;notebooks&quot; that can have sub notebooks. Pretty usefull especially for capturing random thoughts and keeping them organized.
6305212112|5.0|I had to own this movie instead of catching it on TV with interrupting commercials.  It is just one of the most touching, funny, and lovely films I can think of.  All were amazing in it, and it is not just what many would think of as *a woman's picture*.  It is much more, and so well adapted from the novel.  Its one of my favorites.
B006BDHAX0|3.0|The reason I say that is because after paying for the full version it still puts up advertisements for other games.  If I pay for a game I think it should take out the advertising.  It also seems to require me to have wifi access to play, so it can make the advertisement available.  I like the game otherwise, it's a nice game.
B002VH7P4O|5.0|Buy this for Abbey Road if nothing else. The sound quality from the 24 bit is much better than that of the CD. A broader soundstage with less compression gives the listener more of the actual recording than the CD does. It is truly noticeable. You hear more of their voices, fuller notes from the piano, guitar, etc. I was skeptical that 24 bit FLAC could much sound better than the 2009 remastered CDs which I think are excellent in their own right, but it does. If you demand the best sound quality, you owe it to yourself to buy this.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This novel has become one of my favorites.  I stopped reading it because I didn't want it to end, so I paced myself.  Now I can't wait for the movie.
B00338QELU|4.0|The author knows a lot about what China's been up to in Africa. The story line seemed to be there just to sugar coat the history lessons. If he is right, and I get the feeling he is more right than wrong, we, the US, have been making the lives of Zimbabweans miserable because they don't have a democratic leader, not because he or they pose any real threat. Americans are well meaning and we assume our policies are, too. Evidence to the contrary has been piling up recently. This book is one of the few to have slipped into our consciousness that doesn't agree with Rupert Murdoch. There is also a lot of information on China and how it's run. If you can't take your history and current affairs straight, This book will help you choke them down.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Excellent straightforward game to just pick up and play. Some degree of strategy required to spend your upgrade points wisely. Starts of simple but soon gets frantic just like the old cabinet game with roller ball control.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|it is an awesome game you should play it. its addicting also and its fun for all ages. love this game:)
B000002KHH|5.0|The architects of heavy metal. Listen & learn. It's a lot more than just the Ozzy people know from the reality show.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|My 12 year old daughter is in love with this app! she plays with her friends all day on this app! thank you OMGPOP! :)
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|It's a great app-it accomplishes what it promises! Freed up a good bit of memory &amp; I definitely recommend it.
0439023521|4.0|My daughter and I both read this as well as the whole series.  I thought it was violent to start the series and then just petered out by the end.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is a lot of fun the only thing is you have to earn g points to get a lot of the costumes.
B00000D9TQ|5.0|Great to have all his great music on one disk.  Didn't realize how many of them I knew and not who sang them.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|I love this CD more each time I listen to it. The &#34;Guys&#34; are fun to watch, so you might want to think about the DVD version. But I play this all the time--in the car, in the yard, while entertaining friends. It's everyone's favorite music on the iPod.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Though this new app gives more information than the previous one, it is really more than I need. The previous app was much easier for me to navigate.
B005XQLBU4|3.0|I got this the first time it was a free app of the day. Lame that they are doing it for a second time. The game is fun enough but I only played it for a week before I moved on to other stuff.
B00AYXNKIC|5.0|Looks great and great challenging gameplay. A great time killer trying to get 3 stars and a trophy on each run.
B003FVI2KQ|5.0|This was probably one of the greatest buys around on the market if you're upgrading or not definitely grab a few.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I saw this Broadway show for the first time in New York in June.  It was more than I had even dreamed.  I hope it tours the Midwest so I can see it again and again.  The music is great and I would recommend this CD.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Very well written. Sutter throws in twists that catch you and get you saying &#34;i didn't expect that.&#34;. Can't wait for the new season.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Reading a book where a person with Sheryl's education, high-level experience, and global impact reveals her challenges and the realities all women face as it pertains to gender inequality, and misconceptions of how women and men work alongside one another, was enlightening.<br /><br />Sheryl says what many professional women think; she has experienced what many of us have (even though, coming into this book I never thought these kinds of things happened to women at her level--such as meeting a man you truly looked up to (congressman in her case), and having him pat you on the head...what??).<br /><br />Great book, honest voice, real-world examples....read it!
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|I like this game. Fun, cute graphics. Challenging but not so much so that I get tired of losing. Good overall game.
0345803485|1.0|Very poor writing.  No story development thus not much interest in the characters.  It would take much patience to read the trilogy.
B004LWZWGK|4.0|I enjoyed TDKR more than some people did, but I didn't love it. It's the worst in the Nolan series, IMO, but it's still a very good entry. I actually watched it recently while exercising, and it's very good for that. I watch it in about 30 minute chunks, and it keeps my mind off of how much time I've been on my stationary bike. What I love, though, is the Second Screen system. If you buy this movie, it's best played on a blu-ray with wifi and in conjunction with a tablet or smart phone. I use it with my iPad, and it's awesome. It syncs up with your blu-ray player, and as scenes go by on the TV, the blu-ray gives you quotes and information about the movie. Freakiest of all, if you start a video on the tablet, the blu-ray pauses without you doing anything, and it starts back up when you are done with the video. This has got to be the future of blu-ray technology. Very cool.
B004LUS390|5.0|This app is AWESOME! I purchased this one instead of the full one because I wasnt sure if it would be worth it, but boy was I wrong! I love all the features I have access to with only buying the $1.99 version! I will be purchasing the full version shortly just because I am curious to see what else this app could possibly do! And I by no means am an artist, but with this app I feel like a pro. Go ahead and buy, you wont be disappointed!
B00915G6MG|5.0|What can I say -- NCIS -- Gibbs -- Abby -- Ducky -- and all the rest of the characters that we have grown to love.  Have to keep up with them all.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Very fun to play and a little hard at times.  Some games are over too fast, this one has tons of gameplay time!
030758836X|4.0|good read, nothing 'brilliant' as far as I'm concerned..but worth reading. it did keep me reading which i usually bale after the first 100 pages if it's boring. however,i did not like the ending.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|It's just like in remember when I use to play this kind of game on the atari when I was little. Thanks great app
B00746TURW|3.0|Homeless!  The struggles of a brother and sister who at a young age had to fend for themselves.  Their somewhat feckless parents did not really prepare them for the consequences of their (the parents') actions, although the Mother endeavoured to later for the son. The boy's life was very remarkable and it was amazing that he succeeded.  It was written from his point of view and in a most detached manner, which left one rather uninvolved.  His sister, on the other hand, did not fare so well.  Whilst I was interested in in his progress the tale did not really touch me.  Maybe because it sounded so cold!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Reminds me of the old Atari game.  Has good game play too. Probably gets too difficult to quickly for younger players.
B005HEPN06|5.0|Awesome season. Lots of fun to watch. Good story lines and the plot was consistent throughout the entire season. Very good.
B009PK9SB8|5.0|Excellent device. I can see what I am taking photo now. I can play photo and video on the camera which is excellent feature. I recommend this screen.
B006M9NJFG|3.0|It is what it is.  It is a canteen, but it arrived in a really unprofessional shrink wrapped plastic and it didn't look particularly clean.  It didn't appear to be used, but I wonder.  Everything seems fine, but typically I expect something I order to arrive in pristine shape.  This wasn't pristine.
0812931017|3.0|It was a good book. A bit disappointed to know that he didn't start from nothing. Parental loans are not possible for everyone. So I can see how THAT catapulted his business. The story itself was entertaining and seemed very down to earth.
0812550706|5.0|I can't believe that it took me so long before I read this book. I've had a lot of friends recommend it to me but I never got to it. I tore through it in two sittings. Wonderful book. Great characters. If you're a fan of the Halo franchise this is a direct relative to that world. A must have for any sci-fi fan.
B000W93CHC|5.0|Easy read! Now i am very interested to go to europe to see those churches and their architecture. The nuns and monks are oh so real!
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Wow! Good to see a great sci-fi/futuristic movie. Tom Cruise is actually good in this one and Morgan Freeman is always good..so not suprising they work well together.  Lots of action, but believable action.  Good story and writing as well. Reminds me of Tom Cruise in his earlier days...before fame.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|This is the collection I have been waiting for for years. I had the cd's but not in bluray. It would have been awsome in 3-D.
B002O2THVA|5.0|Jimmy Stewart, John Wayne, Lee Marvin and numerous other stars you'll recognize. All directed by John Ford. Excellent Western film.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Good stuff if you got skill son..... it takes a bit of time to get the controls down. Good challenge. I like the graphics. Could use some on the ground fighting.
1932100385|5.0|This book contains the actual research while also explaining the research for those who would rather read it in layman's terms.  I like that you can also go back and track down who funded what research.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|I thought this rendition of missile command was going to be awful boring. I love the upgrade aspect of the game!
B000RGUM1Y|5.0|I seen this movie when it first came out and forgotten most of the details of it. So when I found out I could buy it cheapefrom Amazon than I could rent it..I knew I had to add it to my collection.  Thanks Amazon
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Good 80's fun. easy to learn fun to play. I recommend this game to kids of all ages. Have fun
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|This game is very addicting. Absolutely love it. The only reason I am giving this 4 stars is because you have to buy coins if you want to significantly progress in the game. Some of the levels are almost impossible without some type of powerup.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Great app. Use it all the time. Makes finding what I need on ebay easy. Recommend it for anyone with a tablet that likes ebay.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love this game!!! Dave is the best minion and he always will be!!! He is so cute and so much fun to follow throughout the game.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This is good to past the time.  Easy to play. The graphics are better then the original game.  Would recommend.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|A quick hearken back to Missile Command that moves fast and furious.  Go and protect your city from missiles and aliens.
B005J6LKVI|5.0|I have watched the movie several times now.  I remember the racial war of the 60's.  This movie opened my eyes to the discrimination against people of a different race and color.  How they were treated.  Very thought provoking and moving film.  The actors were marvelous!!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|I love this game, it is fun,quick, and a blast to play. When you need something to play I would play this.
B00992CF6W|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER BUT NOBODY CAN CONNECT TO MY GAME ON KINDLE FIRE BUT I STILL LOVE THIS GAME AND ALSO YOU CAN'T PLAY ON REALMS BECAUSE YOU NEED A APP CALLED POCKETMINE WICHNIS ONLY FOR I PHONES BUT BUY THIS GAME REALLY WORTH ALOT I'M SERIOUSE SINCE MY UNCKE WORKS FOR MOJANG HE TELLS ME EVERYTHING THAT WILL HAPPEN I HOPE YOU ENJOY also get minecraft pc go to [...]
B003WE9TU8|5.0|Such a different perspective on a pretty traditional zombie theme... I'd definitely recommend this book to anyone. Now to the movie!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Super adictting gAme you need to get super fast missiles and big explosions and stuff you k n ow great game very fun
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Its the best occupier for kids who sit with me on a school bus while my friends are sitting with me! And I even play for some updates so the kids will have a more fun time on my Kindle! (although I have to charge it when i get home) I suggest you definetly get this game!
B00992CF6W|4.0|My brother has got me into minecraft and he has it on his Xbox and he just got an update
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator is very handy, convenient, and easy to use! It has large print so it's easily seen, I would recommend this application for all ages! It's free and handy, no fuss, is a must!!! Thank you!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Those 3 words say it all as fun as the old game with little perks of upgrades mst get and enjoy
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I.LOVE.THIS.BOOK!!!!!!!it was soooo good!!!i love the end where peeta says you love me real or not real katniss says real its so sweet!!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|It is a lot of fun. Old-style , basic.  Passes the time with short rounds.  My kids are enjoying it too.
B006ZNRD06|5.0|I love this app, i just cant find it again on the app store. I had to delete it once and now i dunno where it is.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|The script was murky with poorly developed subplot thread. Like a cloud, the movie was present, but meaning vaporous. There are plenty of movies with better acting and better effects. This is not an experience movie. I seldom write reviews, but in this case, I want to virtually extend your life by two hours by helping you to avoid this movie. Rewatch your favorite movie instead if you must watch a movie and can think of nothing else.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is awesome you have different places you can run they got a unicorn that you can ride on its so cool but you got to download so you won't think I'm lying.
B00A7KKPDK|1.0|This is a terrible book. Do not buy!!!! Pick from garbage can if you must read a book by this nitwit. She has 3 pages that serve as a coloring book, a chapter she and I both regret she wrote.
B00CEZJT2E|5.0|Totally happy with this purchase. Nice gadget to have. Really convenient. Worth the $36 and $6 shipping and handling. Well made product. Here's the nitty gritty, this external battery will charge your phone at the same rate as a wall charger. No lack of charging performance. It will charge your device at the same time you are using it. You can charge a phone about 3 times and a tablet once with this external battery. Great product to have.<br /><br />Areas of improvements for the next model: This external battery takes 7 hrs to fully charge. No biggy just plug it in before you go to bed. And as far as I know it shuts off after a full charge according to the led display. Not sure on that but when it's fully charged the indicator led lights go full on then shuts off. But still it would be better if this could charge faster. It would be that much better. And the micro usb that is built in the head is too bulky if you want to use this on a phone inside a protective case. Yes they provide you with a short usb wire to use the other port but it's something else you have to carry around with you. Or you can remove your phone from your case every time. Not. And a retractable cord would be kinda cool with different levels of extension like what is found on a music bullet.<br /><br />FYI: Although the built in micro usb head is bulky it will fit even a galaxy s4 active that has a flap that covers the charge port. But as previously stated it will not fit when your galaxy s4 active is in an Otterbox. Other cases may differ.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Good Cassandra Clare has now came up with attentively New book that is so exciting!!! Can't wait for the next one!
B00AEFY5TI|5.0|item arrived in good shape and got it on time.  I wrote a review about Grease movie I just got with this one. It arrived fast and in good condition
B002VXGW2E|5.0|A wonderful story about how Julia Child discovers her passion for fine French cuisine and writes. Groundbreaking cookbook and a blogger who will cook Julia Childs dishes from her cookbook everyday for a year. Meryl Streep in one of her best roles portrays Julia Child in the late 1940's to the mid 1950's when she and her husband lived in France and discovered her passion for French food. Forward almost 50 years later and a blogger (Amy Adams) decides to cook every one of Julia's recipes in her cookbook. It has a charming story and superb acting by all. Stanley Tucci is Julia's loving and supportive husband. Jane Lynch is Julia's sister Dorothy who is just as fun in the role! What a great story that is light hearted and interesting! A great movie that I highly recommend and say....Bon Apetit!!!!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I like this game! Totally addictive simpleness. I am a mom without hours of time...so I don't need an RPG game
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book was soooooooooooo  amazing I read it  ten spanking times because  Greg is so funny I read it a lot
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|why on earth don't you have the real candy crush game? We pay $200 for this tablet but cant get the hottest game on the market right now! Why on earth would you want to help us play the game without giving us the actual game to play?
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Fun game but not much of a challenge. Would benefit from some kind of bonus weapon or upgrade.<br />G g
B0090X4GLW|5.0|I bought this CD for my mom because she she loved the movie so much. She loves the CD just as much! Its fun and dancey perfect for car rides and my younger siblings love it too. We all can sing along. its alot of fun!
B00AHSLU2C|5.0|My kids loved this movie.  Very age appropriate for small children.  I would highly recommend this movie to anyone with small children.  Also found it educational in some aspects for the kids to learn more about the sea.
B006F8HZYK|1.0|I ordered this for my kindle expecting it to have the beautiful paintings and drawings of the illustrated book version. Instead, all I've found was one page of pictures of typewriters. The written content is all the same, so I guess it serves the purpose as a writing manual (which I did want), but I was hoping to have a little something more than just informative text. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS if you were hoping for a kindle version identical to the paper illustrated one. It's fine if all you want is the classic E of S content.
B004ADF7RO|4.0|Classic movie, I am afraid to say.  This was THE movie you had to see when you were 10 and still is!
B006GWO5NE|1.0|I was sent this cord to replace my old one and it has failed miserably. My old xord honestly does much better than this one does and is much easier to manipulate
B00CEF014E|5.0|This fictional mystery thriller starts off ordinarily enough. Dana Barnes the protagonist...has a good insurance policy with her present employer and decides to voluntarily commit herself to a five day stint at Expedition House, a psychiatric facility to help her overcome her bout with severe depression.  She is being treated by Dr. Hertzig, who after the required time, releases her with a bag full of prescription drugs and sends her on her way.<br /><br />Tyler...a temporary worker/new boyfriend at the facility picks her up on the day of her release to drive her to Thornhill House, Home of the Rainbow Collective. This gated compound is run by her sister's fairly new husband, Clive. He is a charismatic leader who has a son by the name of Conrad from his first marriage that Zoe is yet to meet.<br /><br />On the drive to Dana's destination, Tyler mysteriously disappears and then all hell breaks loose. The roller coaster ride of a series of the oddest and most unpredictable events ensues. Something very weird is going on in this compound where Clive, with his eerie personality and haunting eyes, manages the affairs and orchestrates the preparation for the yearly Solstice Fair. It has been a very dry year. Much rain is needed to correct the drought situation that is similar to four years ago when the Marsh's nineteen year daughter also lost touch with her family and friends. Dana, even in her fragile mental and emotional state, is wondering if there is some kind of connection. What macabre events has this cultish leader cooked up to honor this annual event and satisfy the demands of nature earth in order to get that much needed rainfall...<br /><br />Any reader who enjoys a mystery thriller with many unexpected twists and turns is bound to be captivated by this quick and unpredictable novel.  It is a real thriller and will keep you on the edge of your seat...Damian Stevenson is one creative author!<br /><br />Inspirational Author & Book Reviewer ~ Dolores Ayotte<br />[[ASIN:B007K8QO28 Up The \\"Down\\" Ladder]]ASIN:B007K8QO28 Up The \\"Down\\" Ladder]]
B005CGI4EG|5.0|First of all, I have to say this is one of my favorite shows of all time.  Second, Amazon has an excellent price for this collection.  I do have to say however, the packaging is horrible as far as the box that the DVD's are stored in.  All of the DVD's are stacked on top of each other in two stacks.  So in order to find what DVD you wish to watch, you have to go through the stack of DVD's and they are not packaged in any sleeves so you can really damage the DVD's if you are not carful when handling.  Other than that issue, everything else is perfect so I am giving this 5-Stars.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I come from the Atari age playing this game... the touch feature makes it all the more addictive! Well worth to have to kill time with... and aliens and missile with too! :)
B00BUADSMQ|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie. Bruce Willis is one of my most beloved actors. I have all of the Die Hard DVD's.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Once we started watching we couldn't stop!  Suspense, drama, great plots! Can't wait for Season two to be released in a few weeks!
B00CKZX0AA|3.0|Hans Zimmer was actual able to make a superman score work on its on merits without any hint of the John Williams iconic theme. Each track is haunting and full of the multilayer percussiveness that Zimmer for which Zimmer is known. Down sides to the soundtrack is how dark it is. It is even darker in tone that batman the dark knight. Superman as a tortured figure is shown throughout the movie and this score reflects that.<br /><br />Also as in the movie, it goes on for too long as does many of the tracks.<br /><br />If you are a Zimmer fan then you will enjoy this soundtrack.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Love the movies and the game is great too for any age. It's hard to move fast and get through the levels
B00395ZYVS|5.0|This was a wonderful story with a heart wrenching theme. I loved that it did not have the anticipated ending. It was very well written!!
B008K9SG9K|5.0|Item arrived quickly from seller and is in perfect/new condition. I did a full listen through to make sure quality was perfect, but the first few  songs are so amazing i havent been able to even listen all the way through since then. i start over from track one every time... lol... great band and great seller/shipper....
B005XQLBU4|5.0|A nostalgic trip back to middle command, same fun sense of urgency to defend your city. Developer gets bonus points for not including unnecessary permissions to access our contacts or personal info!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I've only had it stream one movie successfully out of about 100 tries.  It gets to 25% on the pre movie loading screen then sits there till it errors out.  Error AIP-701.<br />The chromecast updated its firmware so it is running the latest updates.  Youtube isn't much better.  What was supposed to be an entertaining device has amounted to nothing but frustration.  Backordered for months, it finally shows up and doesn't work at all.  Buyer beware.<br /><br />\\"We're having trouble playing this title right now.  Please try again later or select a different title.\\" AIP-701 is all I've managed to view 99% of the time.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I remember playing this game as a kid and when I saw it as the app of the day I knew I had to grab it.  It does not disappoint.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|I downloaded this game and it's pretty interesting to play using the s pen kinda makes the missles more accurate
B0035XVVDY|4.0|Good acting they through some surprises which was nice but the end was predictable. The way the story moved was interesting
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This game is fun for me for many reasons. Playing this game can be a great time. I just played it and wow!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Its a great idea and I was really excited about this.  However, it appears that it doesn't work with all makes and model TVs.  Do a search of chromecast and your TV make and model before you buy.  For me and many others it shows up as an excessive amount of purple on the screen.  So I guess it is usable if I want to show some text but that's about it.  With any luck, slim chance but I will try, I can get a refund.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|A go-to game that will keep you at it until you've been fully upgraded! Whether you're playing on a long trip or a short one, you'll be satisfied!
0793563836|5.0|This book is very well organized, clearly written, and has a lot of practical exercises.  It is a compilation of three books with three CDs containing a band playing the exercises so you can play along. The book starts with the basics of reading bass clef notation and tab, but the emphasis is on practical playing exercises that progressively incorporate more complex aspects of technique and theory.  If you stick with it, you will definitely be a better player and be comfortable with reading bass clef at an intermediate level.  I definitely got a lot out of it and recommend it to anyone wanting to learn bass guitar or who wants a good refresher.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|I feel like I'm cheating. I get points and I can use them to repair the city's and make the missiles more deadly.  It's OK

B008O51872|4.0|I have been creating / recording music for a few years now, and have used my fair share of nice studio grade equipment. If  you're looking for Studio Grade recording / professional mixing... This is nowhere near that mark. However, for an enthusiast such as myself that has music production as a near and dear hobby, it's (in simple words) perfect.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Features, Features, Features!!!<br />- USB Interface<br />- Equalizer<br />- FX Processing with 100 Presets<br />- Compressor<br />- Phantom Power<br />- 9 Stereo Inputs / 5 Outputs<br />- It even looks great on my desk!<br /><br />This thing is such a great value for what you get its unreal. Its perfect for a up-in-coming artist or hobbyist, or beginner testing the waters of music. USB interface was recognized right away, I use Audacity because... its free and simple and most importantly is a solid program to be recording on. The EQ on this board consist of a High, Mid and Low knob. Simple and gets the job done. This is the selling point for me, The FX on this board are really neat. They add perfecting to any track. The presets Categories consist of: Reverb, Delay/Reflections, Modulation, Multi(Combos of two presets together) and Special FX. The Compressor is awesome and works flawlessly, and saves me money on purchasing a peak limiter/compressor for the rack. Phantom power to supply 48v to mic's that require it. Tons of inputs and outputs. And looks great on my desk! The side pieces for reference are silver and not white as appearing in the picture (Super Happy about that).<br /><br />CONS:<br />- No Power Button...?<br />- Power Cable is a bit odd but not terrible.<br />- Flat on the desk.<br /><br />Though so many positives, there are three flaws. One being there is no power button... Why? I'm not entirely sure. You have to unplug the unit to turn it off. Kind of a pain but i'm not using it every second of the day so its fine. I've read reviews criticizing the power cable end and understand the concern however it's not that bad and if you are careful and treat your equipment right and with care, things don't break. The last thing actually is more tailored to me and my situation however, depending on circumstance, yours may be different. This mixer is relatively flat on your desk. Me sitting in my char i can't read or see the dials all that well unless cropped up at an angle. I did this with a little tape box lying around but it would have been nice to have the machine built on an angle.<br /><br />All in all a great little mixer / processor / USB interface device and I would HIGHLY recommend it to any beginner, hobbyist,and a raising artist!oncern however it's not that bad and if you are careful and treat your equipment right and with care, things don't break.

B0064X7FVE|4.0|This is probably the most used app that I have and will continue to be. The weather is usually the first place I go.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Love this game, keeps you going for hrs<br />Tutorial is very good to have been on a few hidden games and unlike this some have been boring
B008K6HN8I|3.0|Use it when I forget if I have something on My tablet and I don't know where it is at

B00ARI9CDQ|5.0|Read it on my kindle fire every day.
B009NY43NY|4.0|the series was great, they always left me wanting more, didnt find the ending that great, although i should have seen it coming. I still would recommend the book!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Handy for an old person who sometimes has a little trouble getting the multiplication and division going for percentages when I can't find my calculator.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I enjoy playing this type of game it is very addictive and enjoyable. The act of looking for object and solving puzzles is fun for me. The graphics are really good.
B006N0YWGY|5.0|Mindless entertainment.  Nothing too it but to steer.  You don't control the gas or breaks you just crash over things.  So if you're looking for something quick to do that doesn't require thinking or remembering where you left off this is it.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Good fantasy with exciting twists!  There have been lots of stories lately about the unseen world all around us but this one was special.  It was well written, the characters were intriguing & overall it was just Good.<br />I t was intended as a young adult book but I think it has appeal to readers of all ages. Looking forward to next in series.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|First off when I loaded it everytime I'd try to play a video I'd get the message &#34;The video has not been authorized to play in your country&#34;  Not sure where this is made.  SO I noticed I wasn't logged in so it must use a default address.  SO I log in using my Youtube account.  Problem solved?  NOT SO FAST.  Try to load a video NOW I get the buffering of death circle and the message &#34;this video may take some time to load&#34;  REALLY?  a four minute video I wait AND I wait AND I wait.  At one point the audio starts to play, any video?  Umm NO this file played ALL the way through the 4 minutes and never did load the video.<br /><br />I log onto youtube simply using the built in browser and all the video play fine.  Was of time to use this app just load via the web browser and save yourself the trouble.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|love these type of games.  a great way to pass time and make you think. clever. blues and sometimes frustrating.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Pretty much like Mario for the nintendo BUT still a very fun game and if like Mario you'll like this.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|A very fun and quick missile command game, love the upgrades and how it really changes up the gameplay. A must have for missile command players.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Great game. A real throwback to the original game. Minutes of fun for all ages. Needs more weapons. Like flying squirrels or bats. Now you too can feel like Israel.
0894803123|5.0|Our daughter suggested buying this book for our new machine.  The recipes are easy to follow and turn out great!
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|I had some kindle coins to blow in the app store, wanted to find a good game to keep me interested and my mind working at the same time, and happen to come across this one. I really don't play any video or computer games, except for the occasional word or Angry Bird types when killing time, however, I saw the ratings and read the description and decided to get it.  This is what I have been looking for!  I love the puzzles. I am now addicted to a computerized game. This has not happened since Super Mario 3 and Sonic the Hedgehog (original NES & Sega systems, people)!<br /><br />After writing the above review last night I completed the game...... in its entirety.  THAT'S IT???  I get hooked and its over, just like that????  Major Bummer.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Entertaining and great way to spend some time. Did not know what to expect but I can say that this game is fun
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|the movie may have been great, but how would I know?.  Amazon started &#34;loading&#34; and &#34;loading&#34; again every few minutes.  I never got to watch the movie.  What the heck Amazon? I may go back to Netflix.
B0063IH60K|2.0|It's just okay - touch screen cards do not always move easily. Not many options for play - but what do you expect for free?
140006922X|5.0|amazing book.  written without religious bias.  I was completely into this book when I had only finished the introduction.  Makes one think and think in the best way possible.  Deeply moving and riveting.
0064471837|5.0|I first read this book in junior high and I seriously could not put it down. The series was mind blowing and I just could not wait for more. Its so mystical and mysterious, it really leaves so much to the imagination and there's so much potential coming from this world. It's small side stories are just as great too, it's really an awesome book series for the fantasy lover.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|As a free app of the day, this was worth what I spent on it. It is good for killing some time, nothing earth shattering, but fun none the less.
B00D2ZF3GQ|1.0|This is a waste of time.  His son can't act and would never get a job unless his dad gave it to him<br /><br />Don't waste your time and money
B0016OMFNY|5.0|Put Bob Dylan, George Harrison, Tom Petty, Jeff Lynne and the late Roy Orbison together and what do you get? Great music, that's what. These songs are so catchy, it's scary. These guys are all pros and it seems they checked their egos at the studio door when they recorded this album. They swap lyrics like they'd been doing it for years, like the Beatles did. No one tries to steal the show. Also this is one of those albums where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, this CD should definitely be played straight through.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I love this game so much and am happy for a game like this to exist I played it on my sister's and happy it's for the kindle hope u add the update
B0000028WD|5.0|I really liked this double CD, found it worth every penny, would recommend it highly. There is some stuff on these two discs that is just simply too good to describe. Tracy Chapman's rendition of the \\"Times They Are A-Changin'\\" shoots straight to your soul. Richie Havens version of \\"Just Like a Woman\\" gives the song a whole new dimension. Eric Clapton's two songs are eerie. Mr. D performs admirably on \\"It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding),\\" and surpasses himself on \\"Girl from the North Country.\\" But the real outstanding song on this set is the version of \\"Absolutely Sweet Marie,\\" performed by the late George Harrison.
B000TEUSJK|4.0|I saw this movie many years ago but I still enjoyed it this time around I know I will watch it over and over
B002MW50KO|5.0|When I bought this record I was pretty skeptical. I've been a Bob Dylan fan almost as long as I've been alive, something I inherited from my dear old dad. I wavered before getting it, because it almost seemed like Dylan was selling out. But in the end, I had to have the record.<br /><br />And from the opening bells of \\"Here Comes Santa Claus\\" to the closing note of \\"O' Little Town of Bethlehem\\" I was overcome with joy as I listened to this record of Christmas Classics. Not since the Jimmy Buffett Christmas record have I enjoyed Christmas songs so much. Okay, Okay, Neil Diamond has an excellent Christmas record. Dylan's version of \\"Little Drummer Boy\\" is outstanding, but Neil Diamond's is the best. But Dylan's is almost as good. He nails the song, as he does all the others on this record.<br /><br />And if I haven't helped you decide to buy this record (CD really) then maybe this will push you over. All of the money from \\"Christmas in the Heart\\" goes to help feed the hungry, so not only do you get a terrific Christmas record, but you can help out someone in need.
B002ZG976U|5.0|Shipped fairly fast..  I enjoyed the movie even though i don't like musicals ..  But, then again anything Cher and Christina play in is normally a good flick. Just wish they would had done a gig together..
B00D2K40WY|4.0|I loved the game . When I was bored it really cheered me up. It was so fun picking out her hair,makeup and outfit.
1421550644|3.0|Item delivered on time but wasn't as described, I asked for a new box set and when it arrived, the box was broken on one side, fortunately the books were in good conditions
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is really awesome and I think Mojang should add flint and steel to creative mode though. Anyways, this app is really cool and I think anyone who has a mobile device should get this game
B009RH9HDS|5.0|I am 100% happy with my new case. After getting my kindle fire as a gift I spent 2 weeks trying to find a case that wasn't too expensive. When I came across this malware listing I saw the Orange was listed with good ratings and under $15. I  am not a huge fan of Orange but took a shot, and even bought a used one that stated its only problem was no original packaging. The shipping was on time as advised in the order. Also I could never tell it was used, perfect condition. The Orange is growing on me, and is even helpful when trying to look for it in my large bag. If you don't was to spend a lot but want a case with a nice soft and padded cover, that stands, and has the sleeper mode for when the cover is closed, order away!
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|Really good game. My daughter loves it. Also a great family game some can be really hard but for the most part REALLY easy.
B00DHRLK84|4.0|This may not be the most popular take on this movie but I think it makes a pretty good prequel to the book.  The way this movie was ended could very easily lead right into a second movie that could follow the book.<br /><br />The book takes place AFTER the Z war is over and is an account of those that survived.  This movie takes place at the beginning of the war.  The movie goes into some of the tactics that help win the Z war.  It would be very simple to continue this story in a second movie that follows the book almost to the letter.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I was really hoping to see the battle of Yonkers played out.  Maybe someday we can.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Nice and fun little missile defence game to burn a little time with in my opinion. Upgrade missiles as you go to be faster, and more powerful.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|If you're a fan of tcg's you'll like this game. The mechanics are simple to pick up, but there is a lot of depth for strategic play. One of the best games I've played so far on android.
B009O07NMA|5.0|Amazing album! I saw them live and bought their CD immediately afterwards! These guys are great and I know they are going to get HUGE.  Can't wait for their next album!
B00EEDJM2Q|4.0|I love this game! Simple, not too difficult, addicting. One MAJOR complaint brings my review from five stars down to four: this stupid, intrusive Game Circle thing that pops up after every single level to tell me I got a new high score. Of course I get a new high score every time I beat a level! That's only logical. I paid for the pro version of this game specifically because I did not want pop ups, and there seems to be no way to get rid of them. Even turning off the Game Circle notifications would be a huge help. Amazon, this is ruining your app store apps for people like me who just want to play a game and don't care about sharing scores with friends or about worldwide rankings or any of that nonsense. Please, PLEASE provide the option to opt out of Game Circle in this game and others like it! Thank you :)  n
B00E5Q1HJS|1.0|The movie was great. The sound was terrible. The movie had frequent lapses in the sound where words and/or music failed. These frequent sound burps were distracting. I could not endorse the digital download.
B003UBTX72|5.0|Looking at Richards life the deepest thoughts and his friends comments make one try to think of one word to capture this book. Intense!
B00E8B1P9M|2.0|With a lot of flash-bang SFX thrown-in, this movie contains a lot of corny, predictable dialogue. While the cliffside fight was very exciting, it was the highpoint of the entire film. I was never on the edge of my seat during the entire movie and the ending was completely expected.<br /><br />If you're not hard to please with an action film, you might like it. But, this film seemed to want to win over its audience with lots of explosions and a few well-known actors. Unfortunately, I found myself so bored that I paused the film so I could wash the dishes piled-up in my kitchen sink. I was more involved in that than I was watching the movie.<br /><br />I don't even care if they catch Cobra Commander in a sequel. I'm giving-up on this franchise.
B00BXUA7G8|3.0|The Particle at the End of the Universe  by Sean Carroll<br /><br />This book covers the work and ideas of numerous Nobel Prize winners.  It is not surprising that much of the physics requires considerable attention and new vocabulary to understand. Carroll spins his tale as personal stories of scientists taking enormous career chances to be part of the building and using the Large Hadron Collider, LHC. He varies this with the physics that is being studied.  These individual stories show very interesting people solving technical, scientific, economic, and political problems to get the LHC built and useable.  It is particularly of note that many scientists are looking forward to being proven wrong so they can invent new ideas and theories. The scientific explanations are less familiar and are tough going if you are not a particle physicist.<br /><br />Symmetries, as in a circle is more symmetric than a square, are fundamental. Powerful symmetries give rise to the forces of nature, they are important. In particular they are sometimes hidden and invisible, then they are said to be broken.  For instance many elementary particles have mass. If the symmetry of the weak nuclear force is not hidden or broken by the Higgs field, the W and Z bosons would not have mass.<br /><br />Gauge or local symmetries can be done at every location and are more powerful than global symmetries that have to be done uniformly, everywhere at the same time.  Each symmetry is related to familiar forces and has a connection field. For instance: gravity-gravitons; electromagnetism-photons; strong force-gluons; weak force-W and Z bosons. These are the connections fields, or gauge bosons.  Changes in the connections fields lead to the familiar forces in nature, which are originally related to transformations in symmetry.  I find it helpful to consider symmetry being hidden as much as broken, it is still there just not observable.<br /><br />The main measurements made at the LHC come from two different groups using different techniques to find the Higgs boson and other particles. The results of the experiments are more robust since they are being cross checked by these two competing groups in the areas they overlap.  The proton being accelerated is a mix of gluons, quarks, antiquarks that Feynman called partons.  Collisions between protons are actually collisions of partons- a whole bunch of particles that can collide in any combination and produce many results.  It gets complicated discerning what is actually happening.<br /><br />Separating meaningful data supporting new particles from the huge amount of information collected requires using special statistical methods and computer programs. Events that are 1 chance in a thousand are of interest (3 sigma) while 1 in a million (5 sigma) may be new discoveries.  Most of the huge amount of data is not of interest, and separating the interesting data out is very challenging.<br /><br />Quantum effects are always interesting, for instance we cannot define the exact position of a particle or the exact configuration of a field (Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle). So there is some basic uncertainty in measurement no matter your measuring instrument. The question is when measuring the most basic entities are they particles or fields?  Carroll's answer p. 130, \\"Matter is really waves (quantum fields), but when we look at it carefully enough we see particles.\\" Help a lot?<br /><br />A fermion, such as an electron, can be identified according to quantum mechanics using 4 quantum numbers. These involve its momentum, location, energy and spin.  The Pauli exclusion principle basically says that no two fermions can be in the same state. For electrons this means no two of the electrons in an atom can have all 4 quantum numbers the same, at least one quantum number has to be different.<br /><br />You can also have virtual particle or fields. A Higgs boson can cause a vibration in the Higgs field, which can cause vibrations in other massive particles, which in turn set up vibrations in another type of field that might be an electron.<br /><br />To explain superconductivity in the magnets that control the protons in the LHC, he uses Cooper pairs. Electrons usually interact with surrounding atoms and don't flow readily through a normal conductor. In Cooper pairs they combine so every interaction that pushes on one electron causes an equal and opposite effect on the other electron. There is no net interaction with surroundings and the electrons glide through without electrical resistance. An electron pair behaves like a boson.<br /><br />It turns out that the spin of particles like electrons with mass, appears to change when we change our velocity along the line of motion (helicity).  A number of steps shows that weak interaction can choose between the two spins and hides the symmetry, this results in fermions having mass.<br /><br />I needed all the help I could get to follow Carroll's story.  To better understand and see connections between the many particles it was worthwhile to bookmark the Standard Model Flowchart on the page before page 215. It is not p 214 since it is the last page of the second set of glossy pages that are unnumbered. The tables on FERMIONS on p. 294, and BOSONS on p 296 are useful, none of the tables or figures are numbered.<br /><br />If you are not used to using electron volts (eV)  to measure mass, temperature and energy, then the Scale of Energies, p. 59, is useful. On it room temperature is 1/100eV, the temp of the sun is 1000eV, the energy of a flying mosquito is a trillion eV(1TeV), the Higgs mass is 1/10 TeV , the LHC  energy is 10 TeV. It takes some getting used to using the electron volt for measuring mass, temperature and energy.<br /><br />Further background on symmetry can be found at:<br />[...]<br />[...]<br /><br />For relations between particles:<br />[...]<br />[...]ticles:<br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_particles<br />http://io9.com/5639192/the-ultimate-field-guide-to-subatomic-particles
B000ZOXDG4|4.0|It hits most of the bases, but the settings are problematic and it is all a little two arty.  I think the series starring Helen Mirren is the best and most authentically done.  Cate had the substance to carry of the young Elizabeth, but not the mature and older.

B000W00Y0Y|5.0|Queen was one of the best rock live band ever.<br />The charisma of Freddie Mercury on stage is incomparable,Brian May's guitar style is rich, powerful and unique. John Deacon on bass and Roger Taylor on drums were excellent performers and composers that complemented the band in a perfect musical union.<br /><br />The band had unique performers, excellent song writing abilities and powerful stage skills. In this Blue-ray filmed in Montreal you see all of this come together with filming and sound quality that make it hard to believe this is from the early 80s. The song list is solid and the only thing lacking here is some more energy from the French-Canadian crowd.<br /><br />A must have if you like Queen, live performances and good rock.
B00B22ASUM|5.0|Well written. Could not put it down. Can't wait to get the sequel. Bob is clearly a furry little angel for James.
B009LDD590|4.0|Reviewed by Antonio Toledo<br /><br />If you are considering shelling out nearly $40 (Amazon's price; $80 retail) for Season 3 of HBO's gangster drama, then you already are a fan and already know \\"Boardwalk Empire\\" is some of the finest story-telling on television.<br /><br />And, Season 3 will not disappoint you.<br /><br />It opens 16 months after the end of Season 2 with a bang -- a senseless killing by bootlegger Giuseppe Rosetti (Bobby Cannavale), who is Enoch \\"Nucky\\" Thompson's (Steve Buscemi) new rival. Rosetti has a plan to cut Atlantic City, and Nucky, out as a supplier of booze to Prohibition-era New York City. And it ends with a bang as full-scale war breaks out between Atlantic City, New York and Chicago gangsters.<br /><br />The body count is high in Season 3 as the scriptwriters send real-life gangsters Lucky Luciano, Meyer Lansky, Bugsy Siegel, Al Capone, Arnold Rothstein and Joe Masseria to war.<br /><br />No drama set in the Roaring Twenties would be complete without a flapper, and Season 3 offers the beautiful Billie Kent (Meg Steedle) who steals Nucky's heart as his marriage to Margaret (Kelly Macdonald) becomes a sham. Even as the marriage falters, Season 3 continues to use the Nucky and Margaret characters to tell a differing slice of the Irish experience in America.<br /><br />Season 3 offers the expected outstanding performances from Buscemi and Macdonald. To that, add Cannavale's unforgettable psychopath, Rosetti. Also, in Season 3, Gretchen Moll and Jack Huston get to expand the storylines for their characters Gillian Darmody and Richard Harrow, respectively.<br /><br />Bonus features include actor and director, including Martin Scorsese's, commentaries of the season; newsreels of the historical gangsters; and Creator/Executive Producer Terence Winter's recap of Season 2.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B009LDD54K Boardwalk Empire: The Complete Third Season]]

B005XQLBU4|5.0|just like the original with upgrades easier to aim with the tap interface challenging to play and a good overall time filler
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This is a simple yet fun game.  I was addicted within minutes.  You have to be fast with your fingers.
0316078913|5.0|For the Santaland Diaries, alone, you must buy Holidays on Ice! David Sedaris is a brilliant wit, and I'd have no problem comparing him to Mark Twain. How can I best describe the quality of this book? Well, I was sitting alone in a coffee shop, reading Holiday on Ice. I began to laugh so hard, it was at the point where strangers were staring at me, no doubt assuming I was drunk. The more I tried to stifle the laughter, the stranger the snorting noises were that I made. I was mortified, but could not stop reading! The only other thing I could compare this to is a book of essays by John Waters.<br /><br />Be warned: You may not want to read this in public!

B009MYARIK|2.0|I generally devour any Sophie Kinsella book in one gulp. Unfortunately, this one was a tough story for me to swallow. The transitions between characters was not smooth and I never felt invested in their plot lines. Seemed there were too many \\"zany\\" stories added after the fact to try to lighten up the sagging story. Sausage in the cupcake grew tiresome after the fifth mention. Having a bit of fun with the room keys is where I had enough.

B002AKPECW|4.0|I read on the recommendation of Steve Gibson (@SGgrc). It was a very good SciFi Space Opera. I thought the scope of the story and depth of the universe were outstanding. The characters were also well drawn and very believable. While the science was detailed and consistent, there were a couple of things that I thought were contrived only to move the story along and that bothers me a little. I don't recall the specifics, so they were minor. The ending was also not as fulfilling as I expected. This was also minor. I definitely recommend it to anyone who likes good Space Opera and I'll be reading some works of Alastair Reynolds (this was the first of his works that I have read).
0770437400|3.0|While the book was interesting, I now understand why there were two choices. I would have rather had the story rather than an interview account as to how this came to be.  Not finished yet, but I think I will enjoy it none the less.
B000KIPD5E|2.0|The concept of this product is great: your choice of either two inputs and one output or two outputs from one input, with gain controls for both channels. I ordered one of these, got it and discovered that one volume control applied to both channels and the other volume did nothing at all. I returned it, hoping that there had been a one time manufacturing glitch. Yesterday I tried the second one, with exactly the same result...guess this one will be going back too.
B00EAH3GHI|5.0|I'm 30 now so was 13 when this aired, and with Kurt Cobain's very untimely and unfortunate death I was never actually able to see them live in concert outside of on TV, and now through DVD releases. Grew up as a huge fan of Nirvana and still am, GOD was I hoping for Nirvana to be the band to finally get people to consider a band besides The Beatles as the greatest band, most influential, most innovative, or most anything (I do think Radiohead has at least finally given our generation a band to make an argument for). So, yeah I have high expectations for any Nirvana release.<br /><br />When seeing this my first thought was that it would make up for the blu ray compatibility problems which surround 'Nirvana: Live at the Paramount', I personally own the DVD of 'Nirvana: Live at the Paramount' because I just didn't want to chance buying the blu ray and than being having it be incompatible with my blu ray player. So, to an extent, am a bit disappointed, that their will be no blu ray release of 'Live and Loud' (at least no announcement yet). However, after reading from another reviewer that 'Live and Loud' was taped in standard definition really isn't possible as it wouldn't ever be able to meet true HD quality standards. So, actually, it's also kind of a relief that production company for 'Live and Loud' isn't just releasing a concert \\"HD\\" Blu Ray even though the concert audio and video quality don't meet, or preferably, exceed HD standards. Especially since SO SO SO SO many bands do this, LOL, do an Amazon search for Blu Rays for bands from the 1960s and 1970s tons of them that are notorious for poor quality \\"HD\\" Blu Ray concert releases.<br /><br />Okay, now my second hope or thought:<br />I have a bit \\"odd\\" favorites regarding Nirvana, my favorite Nirvana \\"album\\" is without a doubt 'Incesticide' (used album because, yeah it's not a studio album). Actually only met one other Nirvana fan whose favorite is 'Incesticide'. So, was scrolling down as soon as the page loaded hoping to see tracks like \\"Turnaround\\", \\"Molly's Lips\\", \\"Son of a Gun\\", and especially my all time favorite Nirvana song \\"(New Wave) Polly)\\". Well, obviously this isn't the case with the track list for this DVD. Still though, gotta love that it's not like so many other bands whose DVD release track listings all look exactly the same, so gotta say definitely more than happy with it.<br /><br />Regardless of these two above things, I am grabbing this, already per-ordered, and cannot wait to get it.hoping to see tracks like \\"Turnaround\\", \\"Molly's Lips\\", \\"Son of a Gun\\", and especially my all time favorite Nirvana song \\"(New Wave) Polly)\\".

B006CHML4I|4.0|The Seiko 5 is an excellent watch for the weekend. It's a handsome watch that's so cheap you don't have to worry about damaging it. That doesn't mean it's low quality. In fact, it has many of the features of a higher end watch.<br /><br />I do have 2 minor complaints. The watch cannot be winded manually - you have to rock the watch from side to side. This is an issue if this isn't your daily watch. Secondly, when setting the time, the second hand continues to move. This makes it more difficult to set the time exactly. Overall, these disadvantages do not cause me to regret the purchase.

B007SOQBCM|3.0|I can see how this would work for people that are just looking for streams, but if your looking up a specific channel, you 're out of luck.

B00DC8O6T8|5.0|It was going to have to happen sooner or later. What apparently happened was two LA jingle writers Ryan Merchant and Sebu Simonian met each other via Craigslist. Today the most common ways for many creative minds to meet is via some form of online social media. I am not exactly sure if I am correct,but upon hearing this album there are some possibilities as to the origins of their musical style. Jingle writers have,as far as I've known,usually have a number of synthesizers and musical computers at their disposal-common today for making promo commercial music. Also much of that music somehow ends up being based either in boogie funk or 80's new wave. Intended obviously as a gimmick in those cases, these two seem to have found a way to allow this ethic to blossom into an authentic art.<br /><br />  \\"Safe And Sound\\" is the hit and,very much in the flavor of  the more musically spare \\"Patience Gets Us Northwest Fast\\" and \\"I Sold My Bed But Not My Stereo\\" are very much in the synth dance/new wave vein somewhere between Human League and early Prince in orientation. \\"Kangaroo Court\\",\\"Center Stage\\",\\"Chartreuse\\",\\"Origami\\" and \\"Tell Me How To Live\\" are all equally excellent songs-all wonderfully melodic boogie/post disco funk revivalism with a few important electro-pop touches. \\"Farrah Fawcett Hair\\" brings in Andre 3000 for a heavy funk jam that features NPR announcer Frank Tavares speaking about \\"listing to [[ASIN:B00000J7SS Bitches Brew]] as recorded by Miles Davis and the joys of Michael Jackson's [[ASIN:B00005QGAZ Thriller]]. \\"Lazy Lies\\" has a very spare,organ type backdrop with an almost psychedelic soul flavor about it whereas 'Chasing You\\",with guest vocalist Soseh has an uptempo 70's soul/pop flavor.<br /><br />  The album ends with \\"Love Away\\",a harmonically unique pop/funk number with some inventive use of modern synthesizers. Musically this album totally revels in its appreciation of the 80's boogie/post disco musical arena. Very much in the spirit of France's Daft Punk though,these two very spiritedly revel in their genuine interest in 80's pop culture. They focus on their love of funk,soul,disco and all of its various hybrids during that era. And with their mixture of a bass/guitar oriented funky rhythm section with modern electronics,they really go far with their intent to explore new directions with a music that (in its time) may have been cut off a bit at the knees. The end result is likely to be one of the funkiest albums of the year...that your liable to find in the pop/rock area of a website or record store.Punk though,these two very spiritedly revel in their genuine interest in 80's pop culture.

B0094BB4TW|5.0|I like it better with the browser but it is more convenience when you use it with a smart phone or a tablet.
B00C061I1M|5.0|It would seem that for the preceding three decades or so, the genre of soul/R&B has commercially steered very clear of anything close to Americana roots music such as folk or country/western. The closest anyone would ever come to such a sound would likely be Ray Charles' \\"countrypoliton\\" sound in the mid 80's and the late 90's roots blues revival of artists such as Ben Harper. Very recently,and seemingly rather out of the blue,a new singer/songwriter/instrumentalist from Jackson Tennessee named Valerie June has begun to change that with her music. Instead of trying too hard to find the soul in Americana roots music, she correctly assumes it's presence and focuses on the music for what it is.<br /><br />  \\"Workin' Woman Blues\\" epitomizes her entire approach-a hard driving rural blues stomp with a quick tempo and some blazing horns just before it fades out. \\"Shotgun\\" returns to a similar idea with a more prominent electric rhythm and blues sound (not the brand name,the real deal R&B music by the way) nearer the albums end. \\"Somebody To Love\\",\\"Twined & Twisted\\",\\"Tennessee Time\\",\\"Trials,Troubles,Tribulations\\" and \\"On My Way\\" are very down home country/blues ballads-very real and honest in their approach. \\"The Hour\\",\\"Wanna Be On Your Mind\\",the title song and \\"You Can't Be Told\\" all have a heavily reverbed retro 60's doo-wop/soul rhythmic bass but June comes in with her very jazzy soloing on various instruments to an a different dynamic.<br /><br />  As with much music I find myself listening to,it's next to impossible to classify what is found on this album. And there's really no need to. In basic creative terms,its representative of June's own possible musical environment. Folk,country/western,blues,soul and jazz of several different forms emerge on this album-all having the commonality of being born in some fashion out of the music of the American south. And that is the ethic that sweeps across this entire album. While at one time being a country oriented African American person was considered sociopolitically out of step with the times,the change in the viewpoint-born out of the 1970's, is re-emerging with artists such as Valerie June here managing to embody that spirit in new and meaningful ways.can person was considered sociopolitically out of step with the times,the change in the viewpoint-born out of the 1970's, is re-emerging with artists such as Valerie June here managing to embody that spirit in new and meaningful ways.

The actors all gave great performances and came across as very believable characters, especially Jeff Goldbloom. Rachel McAdams was just great acting along side the veterans Diane Keaton and Harrison Ford. This is a movie almost everyone can watch and is welcomely devoid of political preaching and pushing of any current trends. Basically, this movie is a great representation of the type of Hollywood entertainment of which a lot more is needed. I highly recommend you watch as you will enjoy.

B000FP2OPY|5.0|I never watch horror.  I never watch paranormal shows.  I made an exception for Supernatural!<br />So many things could have been wrong with this show...how do I even start?  The special effects could have been crappy, the dialogue could have been flat, the plot twists could have been unnatural...BUT none of them were!  I was so impressed with the cunning cinematography that offers just the right amount of horror and tension without depending on CG animation for a scare factor.  I love how the premise of two brothers chasing demons was only the beginning of the show, not the audience's final conclusion.  The audience can actually feel smarter for watching Supernatural, because it is so much better compared to countless other shows.  It is simultaneously heartfelt and comedic, dangerous and fun, suspenseful and tragic.  How two guys in a cool car can make that kind of show, I don't know, but I wish I could meet them!<br />This show is mix of the Hardy Boys and Harry Dresden.  The main characters are two who could have been normal guys, but chose not to be.  They may be on the wrong side of the law, but their mission is to help others and bring justice to evil monsters everywhere.  These guys are all-American patriots with a bit of a bent on solving the unfathomable.  Both leads in this show are rich in character; Sam's energy and Dean's endurance sustain them through countless tough situations, but as they learn to depend on one another, the more they come to value each other's unique skills.  Sam's character instantly won me over with his smart initiative, and I sympathized with him: The younger brother who struggles to find his place in a world gone mad.  But it was Dean's character that became my fast and definite favorite and I particularly enjoyed how it was revealed through the first season.  He is unflinchingly brave and tough as nails, but under his rough exterior is a more sensitive man who struggles with showing his true emotions.  He is the older protective brother who will do anything humanly possible (and a lot that isn't) to keep his family safe.<br />Please do yourself a favor and watch this show.  It is the most moving and understated bit of television on the market right now and it deserves as big a following as it can achieve.<br />The only thing I regret about this show is that I did not discover it sooner.  Fortunately for me, I now have six seasons to catch up on before the next one begins airing!  Here's to a long life, Supernatural!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Easy to fun to play but gets very challenging.  I highly recommend checking it out if you have time to kill
B000JML90Y|4.0|Found it very interesting. I can not see how anyone could come away from reading it and not see the logic behind its theories..even after 150 years.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Super fun game good way to kill lots of time. I played for like 2 hours upon downloading<br /><br />. I can not say enough for this game
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This Is a mixture of the two movies and its mad funny like totally I mean like everybody should play it from toddlers to seniors
0399255370|5.0|Our boys love this book!  It's such a cute story with letters from each crayon color to their child owner expressing their likes and mainly dislikes.  The &#34;story&#34; is very cute and our boys love holding up each color crayon for the corresponding page and the ending is adorable.<br /><br />This is a great buy for preschoolers and probably even older kids.  My 2 and 4 year old love this book.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|It was a great book. Loved how August goes through middle school like this. I would recommend this book to someone like August
B005H9B2CE|5.0|Was wondering how they would script the &#34;domain of the Gods&#34; relationship with our world, and they pulled it off with credible concepts and notions of our laws of physics and our understanding of our place in the universe. I was able to buy into the movie's connection between our worlds without any major objections.
B0001KO9QA|3.0|I bought a supposedly new product but the product had some ripped shrink wrap.<br />It doesn't bother me as much, seeing as I would have opened it anyway. But still, this should have been in the description and the condition should have been Like New.
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|In this WWII landscape, we are able to appreciate an American hero through the colored lenses of a bygone era. During the time frame of this movie, we didn't have drug addled radio pundits, earning over $50 million a year, convincing us who we should hate and why we should want to kill them.
B00DH1G7DS|3.0|The game is to slow.<br />I would rather play the regular sudoku.<br />My time is much faster.<br />Diferent game's keep my interest longer.
B0055SWM08|4.0|I'm enjoying Quell, though sometimes it feels like work. I don't know if that's bad thing, necessarily, since I love puzzle games, and it never hurts to be a little challenged, right?
B0063GORYU|5.0|This game is very good. It is very time consuming. Everyone will love this. You can also do this any time of the day.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Further proof that a good movie doesnt need a lot of dialog if the story is excellent. While very funny and entertaining there are intentionally ever present sobering messages. I won't go into detail and spoil anything. But one thing I was unsure of from trailers and general descriptions .... this movie is in fact not all about robots, its about the environnment, digitalzation, mass production,  humans and responsibility. As well as two lovable robots ;) enjoy!
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|I love this it is so great I thought it was  going to be boring it's not if your reading this get It right know lol.soooooooooooo fun
0425166805|4.0|somehow I thought it would be the larger size not the condensed version; but I read it and am satisfied
B00BRUQ7ZY|2.0|I am well read in the search for the historical Jesus. I recognized Aslan's sources. There are no footnotes. He tries to present Jesus as another violent Messiah and King of the Jews without evidence. Aslan is a light weight and reading this is a waste of time.
B001NLL93W|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Had to read all the books back to back to back. It's going to be interesting to see how they portray it in the movies that are now coming out.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|Bought this for my husband who had recorded all the episodes and then discovered that most had been erased. Now he does not have that problem and loves this series.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Read the whole series within a couple of weeks. Didn't want to put them down! Written for young adults but if you like fantasy, they are a fun read!
B001AX9DT0|3.0|I had sampled this album on Amazon and thought I'd really like it, but it's not as good as I thought it'd be.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Read the whole series within a couple of weeks. Didn't want to put them down! Written for young adults but if you like fantasy, they are a fun read!
B005CGI3ZG|5.0|Our kids loved this - now our grand kids love it.  It teaches kids that they don't have to be stupid to be cool, and it teaches that stupid isn't cool.
B0018CMJSU|5.0|I was deliriously excited when I ordered this dvd collection trilogy! When it arrived when AMAZON said it would, it did, and I watched the whole thing in one night! IT WAS PERFECT!!!!!! Played beautifully and the 5th disc was full of all behind the scenes and interviews from the actors, and whole lot more! Best bargain I ever made because I loved the whole Godfather Trilogy, and it is the classic of all movies! Great Deal!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This was a great book!  I loved that I could read the trilogy straight through.  Wonderful story line, I couldn't put it down!
B005FISBTO|5.0|Been a Dexter fan from Day 1.  This does not disappoint.  Michael C. Hall never ceases to amaze me.  One series you wish would never end.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|This is one of the best shows that was ever produced. I  wish I had known about it when it first came on the television, I would have watched it from day one. The acting was wonderful, the characters were amazing , the casting was the best I have seen in many years. The writing was beyond good. I have seen these actors on other venues and yes, they are good  doing other characters, but I will always miss the characters from Firefly, they were simply the best. I will also say, the music was amazingly good with each episode, especially the one called  &#34;Message&#34; . You cannot say enough about this series, I wish it was still on the air, would have loved to see where the characters would have gone.
B001NR8F2O|3.0|What was failed to be mentioned in ALL the previous reviews is the fact that there were ads ran for Alive IV(The Millennium Concert) in rock magazines at the time it was supposed to be released. The aforementioned Detroit Rock City along with Hard Luck Woman,I Was Made For Lovin' You,and Calling Dr. Love were featured in the ad track listing.Someone mentioned Cold Gin and Shock Me as well and with the \\"bonus\\" tracks 2,000 Man and God of Thunder it would bring the total number of tracks to 23.That's 8 tracks shy of what's on the Alive box set release. Nevertheless this download does have 17 of the tracks.It would be nice if Gene and Paul would release this as promised originally.Hmm,maybe I could ask them about this during the Q&A session on the KISS Kruise!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This is a great free game of the day they had a really great choice now I am addicted to this game
B006TF6WAM|5.0|A very touching book. I really enjoyed it. I have recommended it to a lot of my friends and they have enjoyed it equally.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|I play your game for the presentation of the game however you cheat us out of bingo points. When the 5 free games are played and we get bingo we are given coins but not bingo points. That defeats the purpose of winning. Plus your games freezes all the time and when it unfreezes we lose our points. If this doesn't improve you are going to lose fans of the game.
0062255657|5.0|I picked this book up on a whim and was transported from the first pages.<br /><br />As I read, I could touch and see and feel the world Gaiman created...<br /><br />... and weeks later, it stays with me and probably will for a long time.<br /><br />The tale is so fresh that it made me feel like a child again...<br /><br />It was like reading a Miyazaki movie, but more profound and rich and subtle...<br /><br />evoking not just the wonder and innocence of being a child, but also the terror.

0897500482|5.0|I love this book for the philosophy within it. The Tao of Jeet Kun Do has centered me and I love life due to the spiritual awareness that the words have inspired me to attain. Thank you Bruce Lee, may you rest in peace and may your words and impression on the social conscious continue to inspire others.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Great apps, not much to say because I'm enjoying it. Almost everyday I played it just trying to get all the items required in each location, very entertaining...
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Only just started to play this game but already addicted!!!!<br /><br />Easy to play and understand. I like the variety to which not all games give you.<br /><br />Great game, would recommend
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun to figure out!!!  Stumped me at times, but couldn't quit til. I figured it out!!!  Have fun working up the levels!
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This game is totally fun and easy to fall in love with. It had me thinking of things that  I never would of guessed. Overall excellent game! :)
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Great series of books!!  I wish there were more. Stephenie Meyer is an excellent author. Now I have to read others she wrote.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I used to be an UNO fan, but didn't always get the chance to play. But with this app I can play at any time I want. It's great. But you have to have the token in order to play, need to try to earn the token. Anyway, it's still my favorite.
B004FK8RKG|5.0|They work like I expected.  Sound quality is good and the volume is fine.  I would buy them again.  They fit well in the helmet also.
B00640UICA|4.0|So far I am enjoying this game.  It can be a bit aggravating not being able to get the hands turned just so, but it's a good way to pass time . Download it while it's free!
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|These are awesome characters, I would watch this movie again -  It has a nice story - interesting and easy watch.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. I love the trains. The boards are really my favorite. It is so addictive. I can't stop playing it is so amazing.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|It works good on kindle, no ads so far. Hopefully game saves if you die cause this might get old quickly
B008JFUO4U|1.0|Got the long-awaited pre-order.  Then BR would not play past the opending Universal logo.  Black screen!  Called Amazon, got a replacement and having same problem.  Looked around for forums online and found lots of chatter about the problem on a couple of players.  Seems to apply to the first issue of Oblivion BR products by Universal.  Maybe someone in Amazon should train on tech problems.  Or at least include a warning for pre-180GB PS-3.
B00009YOQW|5.0|This little drum as various tones and is virtually indestructible! I bought this for a one year old and he loves it!!
B001BZE82E|4.0|It fulfills my needs for a watch, are comfortable, attractive, and keeps good time.  I would recommend it to others.
B00BC24NT4|3.0|i found some of it was a slog ,and had to put it down few times to rethink the plot i was reading ,but very interesting ,especially about rendition
B005544TRQ|5.0|While this is certainly not a realistic shoe, it is just a fun show that sucks you in and makes you wan to watch more.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|I love this app. Its really awesome. But it is really challenging too! It keeps me busy. But i just wish they would make the cheat/hint fees a little lower like 5 coins
0143122916|5.0|This book is well written, and hard to put down, but it is still hard to read simply because of the subject matter.  But it's about time the truth of this nation be brought out for everyone to see.
193700788X|5.0|I love all of the Sookie Stackhouse books, and I've been following the series for several years now. It is sad to see it ending, but the ending was perfectly fitting for the series. I don't want to say any more to not give away any spoilers. Just read the book.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Interesting. Complex. Simple. Intuitive. Free. What more can you ask from in a free game? You look around the room for clues to help you open the elevator door. Much like 100 floors.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love it!<br />Keeps your mind busy. You keep wanting to play!  I would recommend to anyone!  Fun to do as a couple because what one might not think of the other does!
B004ZN9W5M|5.0|All Pink Floyd albums are great, especially the early ones.  I bought the vinyl when it came out, later got the cassette and had the CD (which got lost).  This is just a replacement!
B0058SNKM4|5.0|This shoe is very comfortable.  Love the way I can just wash it when ever it gets dirty.  All in all, I would purchase another.
B00005NMVP|4.0|The Title song brings back great memories for me.  So, I'm into nostalgia, and the rest of the album ain't bad!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This game reminds me a mix of the old Atari's Missile Command and the Intellivision's Atlantis, but with better graphics and easier to use controls (because of touch controls). Fun little game for kkilling some time.
0064471837|5.0|There's a reason there are nearly 1000 reviews of this book and it has 4.8 stars. You can't not like this book. It's funny, touching, well-written, and, trust me, really ridiculously engaging. I first read it in about 2001; I've read it basically annually ever since, and I don't reread books. You need Sabriel in your life, need Mogget and, later, the Disreputable Dog. You haven't read it yet; you don't know what you're missing. When you're done you won't know how you lived without it.<br /><br />I've read thousands of books in my life. I love them all. This one is my favorite. Beyond that, I could never choose.
B009I2UH2W|1.0|LifeProof has a case for iPhone5.  I just bought a 5 few weeks back and got a new LifeProof case for it.  That said, I also bought this car charger and it does NOT work with my iPhone5.  Every time I plug the phone into the charger, i get a message that \\"device is not supported\\" by charger.  Just to make sure it wasn't the LIfeProof case causing a problem, I took the case off but the same problem continued.  I foolishly didn't save the box and will end up throwing this cord away.  Going to Apple store on Monday to buy a car charger that actually works.
B005544V6A|5.0|Great show... Mike is a terrible actor! But Harveys character and Jessica are great!... Lois que se awesome lol! Great dramedy Donna is fantastic and would take her as an assistant any day!
B005XQLBU4|1.0|Just downloaded and installed app. &quot;Trust Go&quot; pops up and says malware detected. Details reveal that &quot;this app can archive payment via sms&quot; &quot;Recommendation: uninstall&quot;. So I did.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I need a calculator on every thing I have, you never know when you need one.  This calculator is not only accurate and handy, but it's free! I would recommend this to everyone.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I love this. ggame. I always an on this its even perfect when its a long trip some where so get this app
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|this game is very interesting. it is addictive and gives the mind a challenge. I would highly recommend people to downlaod and play this cool game
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Easy to play, simple but addictive. This is a good missile defend. If you like the style , dont hesitate.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|A very fun and addictive game. I would recommend playing this. No ads so far. Very stress relieving. Great time killer.
B004JN1D2I|1.0|THE BOOK<br /><br />This is a soap opera.  I first heard of this series when I saw the show on HBO.  It really got my interest because it had all those commonwealth actors in it, not famous in the US, but *really* good actors.  The story telling seemed solid, and the content a little unusual, ultra-realistic fantasy.  However, it just seemed a little scattered, a little too much seemed to be going on, and there were too many main characters, maybe 10, or 20, depending on how you count \\"main\\".  I figured the book was a densely told tale, and it was just one of those things where it couldn't translate to the screen, even a recurring tv series as opposed to a one-off movie, so I got the books.<br /><br />Well, this is one of those rare cases where the movie (or tv show) is better than the book.  For the first book in the series, there was very little difference from what was on tv.  It was almost a script for the tv show.  I learned the author used to write tv scripts, and it really reads as something ready to be made for the screen.  This is one reason the show is better- the good actors they found bring it alive.  It really reads like a soap opera.  And this brings us back to that problem, too many characters, too many plotlines, and not enough substance.  One bad habit the author has is he keeps killing main sympathetic characters.  Someone will tell you \\"It's dark\\" or \\"It's realistic and not a happy end easy story,\\" but I don't mind those things.  In fact I like dark stories and and realistic stories.  This is not that.  This is characters getting killed for no reason, except  the author wants to try and be shocking, or maybe he ran out of ideas for that particular thread.  And with so many it is hard to really keep caring any more.  A new chapter begins, bouncing back to some character you have not heard from in 150 pages, and you are like \\"Who?\\"  In some cases I couldn't remember what they had been up to.  As the series goes on, especially in the fourth book, (but all throughout the series) he starts introducing whole new casts of characters for some very peripheral subplot that takes place miles from where the main thing is happening.  Subplots- fine.  A little color and characterization- fine.  But do we need to be introduced to each of the subplot's principal's underlings and family?  Do we need to learn all their names, and little childhood memories and flashbacks to yet other stuff that has nothing to do with anything?  You get dizzy and you just don't care anymore.  I began to wonder if the author had fired all his editors.  Very few of the ppl from the first books are left anymore, and your motivation to find out what happens to even them begins to recede.<br /><br />The faux- (and sometimes genuine) archaic English expressions and spellings was forced and tiring 80% of the time.<br /><br />Despite that it is overall very readable, and many chapters end with cliffhangers, which is what keeps you interested in the first book or two, despite lack of depth or focus.  But in the end, too many details, too many characters, too much death with not enough of a connection.  I kept reading long after losing interest because I have a 15 min subway ride to work not enough time to read anything substantial and a soap opera is perfect for that.  But in the end I can't recommend it.  I will not buy book #5.<br /><br />The TV series however, had those good actors in it, really bringing it alive.  I imagine in the third and fourth book, they will naturally act as an editor and cut out the useless extraneous information, and keep it to something digestible.  Though they have their work cut out for them!<br /><br />KINDLE<br /><br />The kindle one is fine and easy to read.  Only thing is this is a book with maps, and you might prefer to have a print edition for that, the maps are readable but a little small.  I don't find it a problem, but when I was a kid, I was really into the maps in books and would not have liked it on the kindle.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|One of those games where you have to think in a logical order but it hasn't been too hard so far. Very enjoyable.
B0091VTISO|2.0|I like movies that even if they are fiction don't go away from reality. Yes this statement contradict both. But for example when you have thousands of arrows flying down and hits every soldier including the ones with shields but you have a kid running around and not a single one hit him. Thats not logical. I stopped watching the movie at the first 15 minutes.
0061537934|5.0|From the first page, you believed that a happy ending was not possible.  I read the book with dread thinking what the end would bring.  What a delight to see the many twists of plot and situations that led to a satisfying conclusion.  I don't always need a happy ending but I own an 11 year old retriever and this book gave me pause about that difficult time that will some day come.<br /><br />The Formula 1 racing was a huge bonus.  I bought a copy of the book for my son-in-law who is a big fan of Formula 1 racing (and an animal lover).  My daughter is now reading the book.<br /><br />It is definitely a &#34;family read.&#34;  Masterfully done and worth any one's time to read.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I had one glitch in the 2nd level but otherwise the game works great. Gets difficult quickly. Brings back memories to the good old days.
B00CHI5B7A|3.0|I really don't know how to describe this movie, however, I will give it a try.  It was sort of cartoonish and corny at times. Great actors, however poor character development/screenwriting.  Ryan and Emma's love scene was interesting. They always looked as though they were going to burst out laughing any moment while saying their lines. I think they get along a little to well. :)<br /><br />I am glad I rented versus purchasing.  Entertaining enough to watch on a rainy day...and it happened to be pouring on the day I rented it, so that worked out well.
B00634GHJA|5.0|Very easy to use. I love it!!! Transferring picture from my cell to my desktop never been easier. I have had no problems with this app.
B000OLROWC|5.0|One of the best 80s movies in my opinion.<br />This was the reason I started training and competing in martial arts as a kid and through my early twenties
B00ECUARO8|3.0|Purchased this because of a review I read on Internet (not on Amazon) that called it a &#34;timeless adventure&#34; which made me think it was something light like a remake of Huck Fin and Tom Sawyer. Not hardly, and with a lot of cussing where it is not needed and adds nothing to the script.
B008TRH5N6|5.0|Loved it. I had wondered for years if the subconscious mind had to with a higher power and loved how he explained about this. He discusses why its important to have a positive attitude with faith. he talked about the sleepy state which i think is the same as the &#34;alpha state&#34; that I learned about in other programs. Loved the way the book was easy to read itch easy steps.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This is fun. Why oh why do i needed to your more? Mr Dobbolina, Mr Bob Dobbolina. You would get more ratings if they could be short.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This classic old game is great. Loved it as a kid love it as an adult. Great fun and entertainment for all.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|It's pretty fun. I enjoy it, but wish I could get more repair things. Overall, good though. I would recommend it.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Crisp graphics and challenging puzzles.  Wish it lasted longer though!  I will play anything similar to this.  The designers are brilliant!
B005DI66N4|5.0|This is a book I would recommend to anyone interested in what humans are capable of withstanding as well as anyone interested in WWII and USSR under Stalin.  It is both very disturbing to learn how incredibly horrible prisoners were treated and inspiring to read how some of them escaped the gulag and survived an amazing trek to freedom.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This book is empowering to women in helping them assess their own attitude toward approaching their life's goals.  It is equally important that men, especially in managerial positions, read this book and reflect on how they have viewed the women in their work environment.  I recommend this be added to any book club read list.  It will surely spark a lively and interesting discussion from the perspectives of career women, working mothers, stay at home mothers and the role of men in their lives at home as well as at work.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|A great game and worth the dollar! This reminds me of the original missile defense.  Also nice that you can upgrade without actually having to spend real money.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Sweet Obie wan kenobi. I Loved it, it was much better than cats. I'm going to see it again and again
B000GGSMB2|5.0|If you want to learn how this man makes it to the top in Miami in the 1980s or if you like mob movies, this is a classic.
B00CEB5QU2|1.0|I bought this months ago, and fell in love with it, recommended it widely.<br /><br />Then, today, it struggled to load an SD card full of great sailboat images. I had the write protect tab engaged, so after 5 minutes, I stupidly removed it and tried again. Nada, Oh well, I will load them directly onto my iPad.<br /><br />But the Camera Connecter got me a \\"cannot read this device\\" message. Tried it on MacBook Pro - unreadable. Popped card back in camera -unreadable.<br /><br />Bad card? Camera? Shot images on 2 new cards, a Transcend and a Sandisk (I use only Class 10 cards). Read perfectly on MacBook Pro and iPad through Camera Connector. Neither could be read through the MobileLite. And afterwards, neither could be read by the iPad, MacBook Pro or camera.<br /><br />This is q fatal, inexcusable flaw in the design of the product. It's past return to Amazon, and I sure would never trust a replacement from Kingston. Had this occurred on my upcoming monthlong EU trip, I would be livid.<br /><br />I don't believe I've ever given a 1-star rating to any product, but this device richly deserves it. It worked fabulously right up to the point where it destroyed cards. Perhaps it was one-off event. But as a paratrooper friend told me, a chute failure is ALWAYS a one-off event, and the customer never reorders.<br /><br />UPDATE: When I got home from my weekend sailing, I reloaded Cardrescue for Mac, and it recovered all the files on the card (actually, not just the files lost this weekend, but any that have not been over-written).<br /><br />Apparently, when the MobileLite turns savage, it destroys the file access table on the card. CardRescue can recover the files without the FAT.<br /><br />For those who don't understand, let me explain. When You \\"erase\\" or \\"format\\" a card, you don't actually destroy the files on it - you just destroy the information a computer or cameras needs to show it where the files are. That's how many politicians and criminals are caught when they mistakenly believe they can destroy evidence on a hard drive. The files are still there until a new file over-writes part or all of the sectors where data from a file is stored. The MobileLite I own has suddenly begun destroying the file access table of each card inserted into it. If you didn't have the technical knowledge to suspect the files could be recovered, you would have considered the images \\"lost.\\"<br /><br />Nevertheless, designing a product that could destroy a file access table is inexcusable. I would NEVER trust any device with this possible destruction - and neither should you.<br /><br />UPDATE #2<br /><br />I received a comment from Kingston that led me to re-test the MobileLite, and I could not replicate the problem. I post here that exchange, because many readers of reviews don't read the comments, and I believe potential purchasers should read this exchange - so I am posting it here:<br /><br />Initial post: Aug 26, 2013 10:29:20 AM PDT<br />Kingston Technology says:<br />(MANUFACTURER)<br />Hello, I'm Jewel with Kingston Technical Support. We apologize for the issue that occurred with the MobileLite Wireless. This device should not corrupt the FAT, there are several different events that can cause this to happen. Most commonly, if a file did not write properly to card that will corrupt the FAT. In instances like that it is easy to recover files as you indicated with sw recovery tools and the card can be then reformatted and used without issue. We are here to help and can troubleshoot with you to determine if the MLW221 is truly the culprit. Please call us at 1-800-435-0640 (USA and Canada only) M - F 6am - 6pm PT and I or another available Technician will assist you. Please be sure to have the part in question on hand when you call.<br /><br />Thank you for selecting Kingston as your upgrade partner.<br /><br />Medical Marketing Maven says:<br /><br />UPDATE #3<br /><br />9/20/2013. I'm absolutely finished with the MobileLite. Here I am, second dayinto a 3-week trip through Switzerland and Eastern Europe, and sure enough, the MobileLite has crashed again.<br /><br />This is, bar none, the most frustrating piece of junk I have encountered in more than 30 years of computer hardware.<br /><br />I won't let it destroy SD cards as it did 3 times in the past, because I now write protect the cards before sticking them into this wretched device. For the past two evenings, it has copied just a few files off an SD card, then stops.<br /><br />Tonight, it can't read SD cards. Can't read them? - hell, it can't even SEE them. Sees my USB drive fine - but not the SD cards.<br /><br />Not only that, but - jeez, you know how Apple just sprung iOS7 on the world without warning...NOT? Well, just about the only app not updated correctly for iOS7 is MobileLite. Under iOS7, it offers you the chance to create a new folder on your USB drive - but then, won't let you actually create one. Just one more example of customer-insensitive Kingston practices.<br /><br />Here's the bottom line, Jewel - Your company has produced a flaky piece of hardware that sometimes works - in fact, OFTEN works - until it doesn't. It doesn't regularly destroy SD cards, agreed - but when it does, no one gives a damn that the card car be reformated - for most people, and all on the road, no one cares about a $10 card - it's the images.<br /><br />Fortunately, I was not so stupid as to trust the MobileLite - I brought a ton of SD cards with me, and will just protect them on the trip. No, I don't want to talk your support people again, so they can apologize and tell me they can't understand how their product could fail, but how I shouldn't worry, because I can reformat the cards. And no, I don't want my money back, don't want a replacement device.<br /><br />I just want to warn others that despite the best of care, and the best of early experiences, this is NOT a dependable piece of geear they want to own. It is an abject failure as a backup device.<br /><br/>Note prospective purchasers - you were warned.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|It's got netflix, youtbe, and google music. All of them work as easily as if you were playing it on your phone or table since the interface is the phone or tablet. I can't wait for more services to add this. More simple than this I doubt is possible. If you know how to use Netflix on your phone for example all you need to do is then press a button. AMAZING!
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|It's okay I still have not quite figured it out I put it on my kindle as my son-in-law put it on for my son on my son's kindle they enjoy it I might like it better later
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app is much nicer than the Weather Channel or the Weather Bug. Radar works great!<br />The graphics are terrific too.
B00BEXB18M|5.0|Megadeth's best in a while. Great songwriting. The sound quality is roast your speakers and make your ears bleed. True metal fans will not be disappointed.

B000VK99Z6|3.0|This may sound strange but to me these guys try to copy Monty Pythons too much.  What made MP good was the extreme visual with the average comedy.  These guys are actually funny and they do not need to make stupid story lines to be funny.<br /><br />If you like british comedies you will like these guys and this film.

B00AAX68HG|5.0|The animation is so good.  QUESTION: is it mutant jello?...  Fun and cute. I definitely think anyone reading this should download this app.
1452110581|4.0|This book was a fast read and quite cute. It's written in prose by the cat.  It sounds like some things a cat would say if he could. Most of the book put a smile on my face.  I enjoyed it......but then I really do LOVE most things about cats. This puts a new twist on how a cat kinda thinks.
B000O179EA|5.0|This is a no-brainer!!  Anyone who loves Michael J. Fox will enjoy this movie.  Not like his usual comedic ventures, it is still classic and Michael is just wonderful.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|this game is fun but its a huge waste of money for a free game. not only are the prices to buy more gems and coins pretty bad, but they make it almost imposible to get all the ponies and buildings you need without spending real money because at the rate of coins you get in the game it would take you weeks to save up enough coins for one pony. and when you take the train to Camo. the prices get even worse. how exactly do you expect a child to enjoy this game if they cant even properly play it because of money hungry game creators. there is way better games, free and not free, that deserve their 4or 5 star rating, but My lttle pony friendship is magic does not.
B00A3XQVKW|5.0|I loved this book.  It is easy to read and full of spiritual truths. I know have the daily meditation, &#34;Embraced by the Light&#34; that I read daily.<br />I highly recommend it for people with and without faith.<br />Lorrie

B002C6A6N6|5.0|I love this show.  The only thing I disliked about this product is that some of the seasons were packaged oddly.  I don't like that you have to remove a disk to get another disk out.  They should package them more like the first season.  But other than the packaging, everything was awesome!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|bought this for my son who loved it! Great collection of movies! The family enjoyed watching them also! Good packaging too.
B007ME5BUG|5.0|I would recommend this book highly to anybody interested in learning about World War II. I really enjoyed reading this book.  It gave a very interesting perspective on a subject that is very interesting.
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|Great networking connections! I have learned so much about so many others!<br />I appreciate the opportunities to share education & work experiences with so many others.
B000JMKTLO|3.0|Not great, but an easy beach read. I think this was her first novel, so that might explain some of my feeling it was a little rambling or loose at some points. Love her other books, this one just didn't do it for me
0553801473|3.0|It's getting old. I'm starting to wonder if Martin ever wants the series of books to end. I mean, if he keeps up at this rate, he may neever finish, which may be his purpose. I LOVED the first 3 and A Feast For Crows, was decent, but in A Dance With Dragons, I'm beginning to wonder if they will ever finish; maybe they'll just be a fantasy soap opera???
B003LSTK8G|5.0|And writes beautifully. It's an amazing story of outsiders who understood how crazy the real estate market had gotten in the early years of the 21st century. These guys -- particularly an obsessive compulsive with borderline Tourette's and another who discovers in middle age that his problem with people is that he's got Asberger's Syndrome -- just didn't get it. What it turns out they didn't get (and most of the &#34;smart guys&#34; did) was that you can't keep selling the same mortgage-backed security over and over and call it an investment. Turns out it was a highly leveraged bet -- a really bad one that drove the country into the worst economic recession since the Great Depression. I like the happy ending, too -- they made many millions. If only all the bankers had gone to jail, it would have been perfect.
B00001QEE5|5.0|I am replacing my vcr's with dvds and this is one of the films that my grandchildren have always loved
0780619587|5.0|This film was outstanding.  I have watched it many times and still enjoy.  Geoffrey Rush was outstanding with his performance as the very sad David Helfgott who could have been a world renown concert pianist if his father hadn't been so possessive.  The sad thing is this is a true and heartrending story and won the academy award along with Rush.  It's a must see.
B00DQBWLSO|5.0|I love all of john mayers albums, I kinda miss him when he sang blues but in the end I am still his fan, and he is the one who inspired me to be a muscican. wildfire, something like olvia, and paper doll are my favorite
B00CKWQN9S|4.0|I enjoyed this music except for the rap music which I'm not very fond of.  The rest of the music on the CD is very good.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|It works perfectly with my Kindle and its easy to watch videos.The only thing  is that you cant download them there.But its still a nice app.
B004SIP7F8|5.0|This is another academy award winning film that I can watch over and over again.  The story is wonderful that contains so much intensity and passion.  Ralph Fiennes is wonderful in this film.
B008MM9630|5.0|Love it<br />It's addictive<br />need items to be cheaper n less crystals<br />More quests<br />More items given when using crystals
006212725X|3.0|A debate has gone on in some of these reviews about whether there is too much name-dropping in this book.  Yes, there is.  Another reviewer protested that, of course, Townshend will drop names, because he's talking about all the work he did with various musicians over the years.  That's not where the problem is. It's throwaway statements such as, \\"Madonna was in the audience that night.\\"  Who cares?  And there is a ton of that commentary to slog through.<br /><br />For some reason, this is common in celebrity autobiographies. It makes me wonder if the publisher orders the author to do this. Stories begin fascinating and continue through 1/3 to 1/2 of the autobiography, after which it deteriorates into dozens if not hundreds of quick mentions of other celebrities this person has encountered over the years.<br /><br />There is too little exploration of some of the meaningful relationships. Paul asked Pete to speak at Linda's funeral. Why?  Wouldn't this relationship be worthy of at least several paragraphs, if not several pages?  Perhaps I missed it, however, as I was skipping through the casual mentions of which pop star happened to be in the audience on a particular evening.<br /><br />In any case, I gave the book three stars because a great deal of it was very interesting, particularly the discussion of the earlier years of The Who while Keith Moon was still alive. Also interesting to me was Pete's discussion of his later years, through recovery and finding his way.

B009GX6TQ6|5.0|Back from the days of JAG, I love these type of legal/military series.  The writers of NCIS and NCIS L.A. know how to grab your attn. And provide great one-liners that make me laugh out loud.  Season 4 for L.A. ended in a great cliff-hanger...can't wait for sept. 24 to watch the season 5 premiere!

B000BBOV8U|5.0|One of the best albums at a really, really good price (paid around $12 for the CD version and got the digital version for free with the purchase). There's not a song on here I don't like. I've been listening to it for a couple of days, and it's just really good music from a great musician.

1476734941|5.0|I confess I didn't read the whole book because I saw the author's PBS special - which is what led me to buy the book for my wife, actually. The idea is excellent, however, and although my wife and I are only two weeks into the plan we have already lost a number of pounds. The really great part about it is that the &#34;fast&#34; days aren't really fasting, just smaller portions of nutritious meals. It is a plan one can use over the long haul without feeling at all deprived. I am looking forward to losing about 50 pounds (make that about 45 now) and hope to improve my LDL and lipid levels as well (without medication). I would love to surprise my physician at next year's physical. He's been trying to get me on statins for about the last 15 years! I'll try to write an updated review in about six months.

B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Just got the chromecast after ordering it almost 3 weeks ago. The setup and connection is really smooth and impressive. There ends the positives.<br />I started playing a movie on the chrome browser on my OSx 10.9 (developer preview). 40 minutes into the movie, and I have had at least 5 instances where the screen simply froze on my TV. The movie was however playing as usual on my laptop.<br />Every time I minimize my chrome browser, the video simply mutes and I can hear nothing. I have to then maximize chrome to get the volume back. Minimize the browser again and sound does not work once again.<br />To be fair to google, I am running it on a 10.9 developer preview edition. There maybe some OS related issue with chrome that google is yet to address. However, given that this is google, my expectations were really high and it has been a let down.

0061950726|5.0|Kline has managed to write a book that is multi-faceted in its themes and yet keeps you in its grips throughout.  While the story is mostly told of a young orphan girl who is sent from New York to the Midwest on an orphan train, she also weaves in a modern day \\"orphan\\" teen into the tale.  They have loneliness and the lack of being loved in common.  They are isolated, even in bustling places.  They are made to feel ashamed over circumstances beyond their control.  And, the bonds of understanding between orphans are so strong that it spans generations.  It shows the depth of how people need to be understood, accepted and loved.<br /><br />This novel would also be great for young adults.  Since part of it is told from a teen's point of view, you feel the turmoil of her life.  It also weaves in the historical fact of the orphan trains.  Between 1853 and 1929, 250,000 children were sent off from the east coast to the Midwest, oftentimes to be merely indentured servants to the parents that took them in.  Kline was able to provide this history, weave in a gripping, believable plot and still provide a human truth, without being \\"preachy\\".

B002SJIO4A|5.0|District 9 is a new kind of sci-fi with a surprising delivery drawing as it does on a political and sociological allegory of the apartheid system in South Africa and the aftermath.Good sci-fi tunnels into present topics and concerns,fleshing itself out with ideological meat. First the idea of aliens as not invaders, occupiers or overlords but immigrant underdogs herded into sprawling slums on the outskirts of Johannesburg.The use of news channel reports and shakey docu footage to loosen up and make familiar the somewhat incredible idea of a stranded alien spaceship that is far from its mother planet and fleet,forced to hover above the South African townships due to lack of fuel for the last 2 decades. The image of these aliens downgraded as`prawns' with half humanoid,half invertebrate features further adds a spoof,comical effect until one realizes they stand for the displacement of refugees,asylum seekers.Their way of speaking is effective and almost believable.<br /><br />Included in this are the Nigerian black marketers,gunrunners, who along with private corporation Multi-National United(MNU), are exploiting the aliens. The non-humans are found starving after humans burn through the walls of their spaceship,then quickly confined to an area called District 9, a makeshift refugee camp they must not leave under any circumstances. Despite being monitored by MNU's agency, the extraterrestrials begin to break the rules,leaving the confines of the camp,committing crimes and clashing with the authorites.The human population begins to feel increasingly threatened by the visitors-and resentful of the money being spent on maintaining District 9. These `immigrants' are treated like the segregated natives under apartheid.<br /><br />The masterstroke is to have the middle manager,Wikus Van der Merwe(Copley), portrayed as a naïve,self-satisfied comic fool who is responsible for leading MNU in the township clear-out. They must be evacuated to a more isolated area. Wikus is infected by a spill from an alien object while searching a homestead and his DNA gradually becomes morphed(shades of The Fly).His arm becomes claw-like..He becomes hunted, captured and experimented upon as he is able to fire the aliens' weapons. They are literally about to harvest his body parts so they can develop the alien weaponry themselves, by using his DNA. Before the operation he escapes and is pursued like a fugitive.He allies himself with the alien Christopher and his son who have collected fuel to get back to the main ship to alter his DNA to what it was.Wikus due to his vulnerability and suffering enlists our sympathy as do the alien survivors.<br /><br />There follows a more conventional shoot-out as he gets into an exoskeleton machine and the hidden ship under the ground takes off lifting to the mothership.This film is grounded in such historical facts as `the group areas act' which enabled government agents to forcibly remove entire towns using force and intimidation,even the symbol of an alien crossed-out sign takes us back to `whites only', plus the fact there was a `District 6' slum area.I can't praise this film enough for its mastery and low budget techniques and being good sci-fi and avoiding Hollywood.Be thankful there are no stars in this film and the indie methods of filming make it so refreshing. Maybe the future of the cinema rests outside of America in lands far,far away.I think I walked away with a smile on my face thinking director Blomkamp pulled this off through talent alone and his main actor Sharlto Copley (one to watch for) and the fact it was South Africa (not America or Europe) where the aliens landed. The aliens are depicted as a race of dislocated beings who earn our sympathy.The distribution was helped because it was produced by Peter Jackson.Better than Star Trek?
B0010SKUYM|5.0|In book one of this imaginative trilogy, a magically gifted intelligent man shares his memoirs with a \\"chronicler\\", a scribe by trade.  In true sci-fantasy form, his story has many twists and turns as his adventures unfold.  This very gripping tale was very difficult to put down and I can't wait to begin book 2 in this excellent trilogy.
1439110123|5.0|I bought this book for a college course. We did not read through the whole book, but what we did read was very interesting. I did get bored of it at some places, but it is definitely worth the read.
0470638842|4.0|this was one of the first social media books that i read - worth the read.<br />Erik has a great understanding of this business.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|What a great love story ...great acting that does the classic novel some justice! I definitely recommend!!! If you haven't seen this movie... you are missing out!
B00AA7O22U|4.0|The expendables 1 was a better movie but if you are looking for explosions and a good lineup of action actors  you have to watch it!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is by far the BEST show on TV in a very, very long time.... I held off watching the last episode because I just didn't want it to be over!
0140157352|3.0|I'm in sales and have had tons of sales training in the last 14 years - the book is ok but there's nothing new or amazing about it.<br />if you are new to sales go for it.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|really fun way to pass some idle time and challenge yourself to get higher and higher scores.  I play it on my cell phone and Kindle.
0071762345|4.0|i have read a few books related to social media and online marketing and i enjoyed this book.<br />If you are in the business of marketing it will be a great review of the fundamentals of digital marketing.<br />If you are new to this space this book will really help you get a good foundation regarding digital marketing.<br />Dave Kerpen is well known and respected in his industry - worth the read.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|Blu-Ray quality is phenomenal - seldom does a movie take such fantastic advantage of surround sound as this movie does. Video quality is quite possibly one of the best I've seen. The digital copy allows for Ultraviolet or Flixster, AND iTunes or Amazon Video. BONUS: The iTunes copy (which is what I chose) is actually in HD, not SD.<br /><br />I won't review the movie itself here, other than to say that I thoroughly enjoyed it. YMMV.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Love this game this game is gear very addicting will never so playing can't wait to party Sharon so assistive
B005XQLBU4|4.0|it is fun but it is not to challenging yet. I hope it gets there soon my city hasn't been hit once
B00A285OOW|5.0|If you love Philippa Gregory books you will love this one. If you have never read her before please start now! If you have a love of old English history she has a way to weave facts and fiction that puts you right at the scene.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is the series I've ever read, and I think it couldn't have been anymore perfect. I can't wait to see what they come up with for the movies!!! 💖💕
B008MEM24S|4.0|Fun game. Challenging at times, maybe too much so for a six year old. Worth the cost for full version, many levels.
B0000844MR|5.0|This disk has no special features whatsoever; no previews, no commercials, no commentary, no behind-the-scenes footage.  It has selectable subtitles in Spanish and English, and offers DTS stereo or Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound.  Instead of cramming the disk with extras, the film is encoded at a 50% higher bit rate compared to standard DVDs, making the Superbit Collection edition the best quality available to standard DVD players.  It comes with a bit of campy &#34;Superbit&#34; branding in the DVD menu, but the picture quality of the motion picture is tops, and doesn't over scrutinize the production quality with HD resolution.
B0014JLYPQ|5.0|I highly recommend Crocs Clogs to anyone.  They are very comfortable for working inside, or outside, even in the rain.

B006GECE9Y|4.0|This browser is way better then silk as far as browsing. You can also get some games and GIFs on here... however it crashes constantly on the Kindle fire and I'm always needing to restart my Kindle to get it working again.<br />And if it doesn't work on your Kindle fire it's because you need to download ES file explorer and download it from there.<br />In all its a great browser.... they just need to make it more kindle friendly so it doesn't give everyone such problems.[[ASIN:B008K6HN8I ES File Explorer]]
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This is a nice game because one is on a mission and you get to collect coins. One has to stay away from the electricity. There's artillery for every situation the character enters into.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Needs updates  but fun to vBulletin play and very interesting reminds me of the movies just wish it was easier to get acorns
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great because you never have to pay anything unless you want to. There is a daily challenge and coins, keys, and mystery boxes to collect. The more coins one collects one has the opportunity to open up other characters.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|Great game a . Little slow might need some updates but still fun to . Play  even for a little while
B00CAZOHDO|5.0|Sort wanes in some parts. Still a good cd. Definitely embodies summertime music to groove to on a hot day.

B009XIXVU6|5.0|If you are fan, its a must read, if you have never read anything he has written, be prepared to get hooked. His stories transcend time, and encompass life, its brutality, its wonder and its enigma. All they while, steeping you in the fragrant tea of the Afghan culture, opening your senses to its complexity!
B009WUBERW|1.0|WAY too campy for me, I expected more of the action from the first movie but instead it was a collection of movie trivia for the actors and reliving their old films. Not anything like I expected from the first movie which I really enjoyed.
B00640UICA|5.0|Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful! This is one of the loveliest game.I played ever. Nice musical theme, easy game at the beginning. Characters are more then cute. Easy? I am at the same level second day, but I enjoy in it for the very first moment.<br />It looks like the game for the kids, only.,,, if you bay it to your child, you will play .<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
B008RXYOKY|5.0|exactly what I was looking for really sped up the transfer to my firewire devices. good quality, easy to install
B005XQLBU4|1.0|Once more there are virus in the Android applications. Do not install it. I do not even try to play this game.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I had just bought a Kindle Fire HD 32 Gb from Staples and my wife wanted to try this free app out.  We were in McDonalds and had a ask a young fellow how to connect. Once we were connected, we played this for almost an hour.  It stops at a certain point but was easy to add see life and watch the fish swim around.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|This is Must see TV. Very addictive show.  A friend recommended it to me, and now I'm recommending it to everyone.  You won't be disappointed.
B00DRPVE3M|1.0|I could play this with the computer or system, but you have to have someone else out there who plays.  I did to remove this apps, since I can not use it.  Bad move.
B003ELY7PG|5.0|Freaking awesome. Love the examples and the similarity with reality. Worth more than every penny spent to buy the book.

B00C7JGDBW|3.0|The movie is very good, worth a couple of watches at least. The DVD format was such that it was a small picture in the center of my TV. I've never run into this before. I hit the zoom on my vizio TV and it still had a black border. My LG DVD player had a zoom also and this filled the screen, sacrificing HD  high resolution. Maybe I bought the wrong format. Any input to this problem would be appreciated.

1401941893|4.0|**This book was written for Miranda's \\"generation\\". I am 28 (Miranda's generation) and though I liked the book, I think it's a better match for teens**<br /><br />I really enjoyed the book! It is relatable. Miranda did not say anything new, but added a fresh twist to the way I saw things. I liked reading Miranda's perspective on life's lessons. She talks about love, acceptance, jealousy, true beauty, inner strength, confidence, gratitude, optimism, good health, faith, loyalty, passion, perseverance, charisma and even touches on grief. It is not a huge book, but it covers many topics. I love that.<br /><br />There were two lines in the book that really stood out to me. The first one is: \\"Some people are taught to believe that it's better to be silent than to rock the boat. But in my opinion, you are worse off if you remain silent, because you can find yourself squashing your own desires to accommodate others, especially those whom we value\\". The second line that I loved was: \\"Doing things halfheartedly because someone else thinks you should means you're robbing yourself of achieving your desires and dreams\\"...unfortunately I could relate to those lines and if I had a book like this as a teenager (when I needed it), I would've realized my dreams, not my parent's dreams for my life. Parents mean well, but sometimes they can hinder their children's growth by telling them what to do instead of allowing them to learn on their own. You can put love, happiness and talents on hold for their approval and comfort. I did. Now at 28, I am having to start over. Thanks to Miranda's book, I have a new perspective and I am ready to fly again! Speaking of flying, I love that butterflies are illustrated in this book, and there's a lovely story in the beginning about a butterfly's strength and growth (and humans).<br /><br />Miranda talks about her life's lessons as well as lessons she's learned from others. There is a section that features pictures of her throughout the years with family and friends. And the second half of the book has affirmations that Miranda uses in her daily life. This book is filled with positivity and love-two actions we should all strive to possess. Overall, if you are a young woman, you can gain some knowledge about life's lessons in this book. If you are 25+ it is still a good read, but more of a mental boost than a learning moment. This book will not only help young ladies, but even adults who are looking for a fresh new start.ily and friends. And the second half of the book has affirmations that Miranda uses in her daily life.

B005WUHAX8|5.0|Love it! I am just so extremely please with the product in how it protects my iPhone! Amazingly wonderful! Just wow
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|There is much controversy about the author, mostly stirred up by those who question whether a Muslim can write about Jesus. But this is a book by an eminent biblical scholar about the historical Jesus. Ultimately, I found it confirming my faith in the Jesus who lived and preached, who was crucified, died, and resurrected. The chaos of the times and the transformation of Christianity from a Jewish sect to a religion of its own make a compelling story.
B005XQLBU4|1.0|This was a FAOTD January 15, 2012.  That's ridiculous to make it the free app again.  If that wasn't enough to gain popularity then Maybe it was time to forget it.  Why would I want it this go round?  As well, some of the later reviews stated that 5 days later ads were added to the app.  I am tired of FAOTD being a paid app just prior to being a FAOTD then going back to a free app with adds a week later.  My virus scanner didn't warn me of any issues but it still doesn't mean it's safe.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|My son introduced this movie to my grand babies and they loved it, so of course I had to buy it for them.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|Excellent show, the actors are great and the storyline is good too. I recommend this shoe to anyone that liked this type of period piece with drama.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I had purchased this book as my summer read----imagine my surprise when I finished it a week!!  I could not put it down!!
B009IU6BIS|5.0|This movie is an all time favorite to watch if you love Christmas and enjoy a real good laugh. You won't be sorry if you rent or buy this one it never gets old and you'll look forward to the holiday season just to see it again.
B00C7NKPPS|5.0|Had the copy on lp years ago  when it first came out now I have it on cd!!  Thanks Paul for the memories!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|The game is easy to understand and a lot of fun.  It becomes addicting very quickly.  The game reminds me of old school Atari games with a touch screen twist.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a well-done challenge. Takes some time, but not impossible. After a few levels you start catching on to a few ttricks, but those get more involved too, as you go up levels. Looking forward to more levels to be made available.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|I never saw the original episodes, so I couldn't tell you how the original music affects the episodes, but I never noticed. The wife loves this show, and was happy to have it on DVD.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Fun game.  Fairly simple but with enough depth to be a good quick test of your reflexes. Definitely worth a DOTD, probably worth the dollar price as well.
0060730552|5.0|This book is absolutely incredible. I literally could not put it down. So I stayed up until about 2am until I had read it cover to cover, the only time in my life I have been so spellbound by a story that I have read a book in one sitting. Amazing. You will stay home from work to read this book, ignore your family, forget to eat or go to the bathroom. It is like that.
030789701X|5.0|i used the book to create my character before i started, and to get an edge on my play. besides, it's nice to me to have a little bit of a story to a game like this, especially if you don't start from the very first edition of the game.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very addicting and it takes boredom time right away and keep you motivated by the game.<br />1.This game is just like temple run, but I prefer this game to play because it's fun, and 3D.
B002RI9MWA|1.0|My one BIG dislike is the singular narrative by the main character. It was infuriating having to read the story solely from his words. Apart from that it does highlight the perception a vast majority of people's who are not citizens of the USA have toward the way that country influences other nations and how quickly they are to cast similar ethnic people into the same boat.
B00CW7KK9K|3.0|I have compared the Pulse with my Fitbit One over the last couple of weeks. I love the way Withings hardware are all compatible with the apps and mesh well. Unfortunately, compared to the Fitbit One, the Withings falls short. There are several Health apps I use that incorporate stat from Fitbit and Withings hardware. As of this writing, most of the apps I use accept the Withings scale and BP monitor but do not work with any data from Pulse. On the other hand, all these apps sync perfectly with the Fitbit One.  To Withings credit, I have had a repeated battery life problem and they are in the process of replacing my unit. Until there is more integration between the Pulse and the numerous Health apps I use, the Pulse is being relegated to my back up unit and Fitbit will remain the primary activity tracker.
B00CW7KK9K|4.0|I like this little monitor. The only reason I rated it a 4 is that I wish it could monitor heart rate all day and not only when I place my finger or wrist on it. I've been using it for 2 weeks now and it has given me a better idea of my sleep patterns which is the main reason I purchased it.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|The movie was entertaining, the actors gave stellar performances in their various roles.  The movies plot, held my attention throughout the entire viewing.  I feel it was money well spent.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game.  I met people from all over.  Love trading and giving gifts.  Love receiving gifts too. Still addicted
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|This rendering of Hansel and Gretel with a twist, is well worth the viewing.  If you like good graphics, and lots of action and bizarre happenings, then this movies for you.  The acting was also adequate,  I wouldn't recommend it for very young viewers though.
B0017HEYEI|1.0|The description indicated the language was English and Korean.  There was &#34;some&#34; English writing when the DVD first started.  But most was in what I can only describe as &#34;Korean script&#34; (letters).  And when I started the DVD, what are normally the &#34;Play&#34;, &#34;Scene&#34;, and &#34;Language DVD commands were in Korean &#34;letters&#34;, with the audio also in Korean. I did search around and found an English audio version on the DVD, but I had to go through the &#34;Korean&#34; DVD commands to do so.  And even then it was trial and error finding the English audio version.  I've always had good luck with the items I bought through Amazon.  But this is one I had to return. And to Amazon's credit, I experience no problems doing this.  I thank Amazon for that!
B000JJS8TM|4.0|I enjoyed it very much. Very Interesting mashing of songs. It got better as it went on. It seems to build as it goes along.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I got this mouse as a temporary for a better mouse in the future, but now I realize that there's absolutely no need.  The pics don't do it justice, I thought it was going to look hideous and I was pleasantly surprised.  It actually looks good and not gimmicky.  Quality wise it's just OK, nothing special and not bad either.  I would have rated it as high quality if the side buttons didn't feel kind of cheap, the rest of the mouse feels solid though.  Also, the thumb grip is very useful.  I love how you can program different profiles and program each button it's great!  And the fact that there's so many buttons makes it even better.  The buttons behind the wheel though are a bit unreachable, but no big deal, just assign a rarely used function.  I wish you can choose to make the wheel free-spin like my old mouse, it makes it so much easier to get through lots of pages.  I knew it didn't have that before I bought it so I can't complain, but that's one thing that would greatly improve the product.  I haven't had any problems with the mouse thus-far, but I've only had it for a little bit over a month so it's still pretty new.  It's extremely ergonomic, I have large hands in glove size (not huge, I'm 5'10).  The mouse is also extremely precise and very smooth.  This mouse is really really good for the price.  The only difference between this mouse and ones that cost more than twice as much is that they use better plastic or metal.  This mouse is great and if you're looking for a mouse in this price range or even twice as much stop your search and buy this, you won't regret it.  This is definitely the best mouse I've had and I've paid much more.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Retro missle action at its best. just like middle command but better with tap to aim and upgrades you can get without grinding for points or spending real money. Maybe they can do a remake of defender.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Certainly wasn't the ending I expected to read. Can't wait to start book three. Hopefully there will be more to this tale.
B008QMMEOE|2.0|this game is 4 puzzles and then you have to buy the full edition - it's not worth the download time
B00AQL8VU4|5.0|great way to shop with my acct, and my faves while I'm on the go. I like that I can save items to my favorites for me to check out later, or just buy whenever.
B00133KFGW|5.0|Loved the movie.  Its one of my favorites!  will definately watch it again. I like older movies and I have my favorites and its one of them.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|this game froze up every time we played it. This was very unfortunate because the whole family seemed to enjoy it. Got tired of hearing my child cry about having to start over every time she got to the same place on the game.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|Great remake of a great classic. Similar to Downton. It illustrates the relationships between the staff and their employees during the time period.
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|Family favorite, just wish there were character options. we bought the full addition, but you still have to purchase players separately.
0316247545|5.0|My daughter loves this book! She reads it over and over and takes it with her where ever she goes! The price was right too!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|easy read, great book. I love romance and could not put this book down. I wish the movie would have followed the book more closely in the beginning.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|Since we are Breaking Bad fanatics, I just had to send this poster to my sister. She loves it! May get one for myself....
B00ECU34ZM|1.0|This movie skipped  for long time didn't  know why call Xbox just what to know because it was a waste of money they said they called you but I didn't know if you fix the problem yet?
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed RED.<br />It is really good action entertainment.<br />Not overly foul mouth. The movie is very fast paced.<br />Well worth the price.
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|This never skipped and I like this movie from the begging this movie caught my eye but the other movies I rented was very bad because they skipped.
0679805273|5.0|I got this book as a gift for my newborn son about fifteen years ago and love it.  No other book out there tells the you how to deal with life's ups and downs in such an entertaining way. It's the best, most succinct and funniest self help book ever written. I read this to my two sons thousands of times and I never got tired of it unlike like some other children's books. When they were babies they enjoyed the colorful pictures and rhyming words but as they got older they got the books positive message, your smart and talented and the whole world is out there waiting for you but it won't always be easy and in fact sometimes it will be really hard, still you have to keep moving forward.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love, love, love this game!! Play all the time and everyone is very helpful. Very challenging...always lots of fun and New games. Can't get enough
B0094BB4TW|4.0|If you are running a page however, this app will not be for you. There are some functions which work for page managers, but if you want to edit a post, you will need to delete it and re-write it. Alternatively, use Page Manager for FaceBook - but nothing beats a web browser for pages.
