B005DOKM9M|5.0|I have my Kindle Paperwhite in it and it holds it very nicely and protects it. Looks good, easy to use.
B005OZE9SA|5.0|This was recommended by a friend who owns his own recording studio and I couldn't be happier. The Scarlet allows me to run two instruments, two mics or a combination of the two at the same time. As an added bonus it enhances the soundcard in my laptop for playback (and even listening to MP3s and such).<br /><br />It also comes with a bonus Ableton Live recording software demo disc, so you can be up and recording quickly, even if all you have is the instruments and zero computer interface or software.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B0070NSPCU|5.0|This book has it all-gripping story, interesting characters and a unique world.  The best book I have read in a long time. I can't wait for the next book.
B000PMG16U|5.0|Bought this for my grandsons who watched the original three last year. They asked Santa for lightsabers......the tradition lives on!

B00846REIS|5.0|What a book! Characters developed much better than Fifty shades series. I was very disappointed in the last book of that series. I Can Hardly Wait for the 3 rd book , Entwined with you . I preordered!!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|pintrest is the best app.<br />SO addicted to this app.<br />great ideas on there, some great recipes and cool crafts!
B001AQO3QA|4.0|I ordered this because I love the Alien series and wanted to get all of the movies on blu ray.  I am pleased with the quality of the movies, however, the packaging seems to the be the way most multi disc sets are going these days.... Cheap. It gives the feeling that when you pull the discs out they will be easily scratched and scuffed.  I would recommend this product with one warning, check your discs when you get them... And check them carefully!! also, when taking them out of the sleeves, use extreme caution.  Other than that, this is a great deal for all 4 very awesome movies.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I can play this endlessly and have had no problems with it whatsoever. A great free version, I highly recommend it.
B009HEP41A|5.0|This CD is wonderful.  The music is lush and glorious.  I love the resonance and the depth of sound...the Russian baroque.  It's a beautifully made piece of music.  I've been listening to it for hours while I read. Very worth the purchase.  5 stars
0765325950|5.0|Amazing finish to the series, with far more of the book written by Jordan than the previous couple of entries. Ignore the 1* reviews, they are people complaining about the e-book being sold at a later date.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|His is a complete copy of minecraft but worse.worst game I've seen controls are stupid and confusing.I'm very disappointed in this game.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|Ted was a great movie.....adult movie only, though.  It's very funny!!  I would recommend this to adults that like comedy movies!!
B004GXL8GC|5.0|My nephew loved this toy.  Although the picture online looks a  lot bigger than the actual size.  It was very small.
B0042AEOG0|5.0|Great combination of Christmas music by Mariah! Love it! Suggest to anyone who like traditional combined with new to get
B005KELQEU|5.0|I would recommend this Kindle sleeve , great quality and well worth the $.  I had planned to make a sleeve but this price was affordable and I love that my Kindle is well protected when not in use.  Very satisfied.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|The alarm clock feature works exactly like it should. It also offers a lot of variety for wake up sounds.
B005LAII8K|2.0|If you have not seen the movie yet, this review does NOT tell the storyline but serves as a cautionary review if you, like I do, despise movies that abuse the innocence of children especially under 12 years of age.<br /><br />First of all, I must admit that I have been a fan of Bruce Willis for a long time.  We're about the same age; his use of firearms (e.g. \\"Tears of the Sun\\" others) are credible, and; most of his movies have a positive theme of good combating evil.<br /><br />But I am surprised that he took a role and allowed the blatant child exploitation that is in the movie \\"Looper.\\"<br /><br />The movie had great action, great special effects, and great acting.  The greatest and most notable acting was actually done by the child that developed into a primary antagonist in the movie.<br /><br />Killing a small child?  A small child depicted as Evil?  SUBSTANTIAL Blood splattering on the small child? If we as a nation continue to portray our children in evil roles, then evil is what they only will know, and evil is what they will become.<br /><br />If it was not for the aforementioned on the abuse of children this movie would have obtained 5 Stars.<br /><br />Brother Bruce, what happened, man?  You are better than that!<br /><br />Blessings,<br /><br />...Chappy (aka GhillieMan)
B006LSZECO|4.0|Great story that keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time. My only complaint is that it was impossible to like either of the main characters and the ending left you hanging a bit...
B0076DELIG|4.0|I can't say anything different from other Bosch fans who are not as excited about this book. For quite a few chapters I was interested but at the same time I could read the ending coming. What I thought, was and that's unusual for Connelly. I have been, since his first book, a fan and will continue. Think I'll chalk this up to, oh well, even the great ones don't always score big. I give this book four stars because no matter how you look at it, Connelly is one heckva writer, love his style and is still a King of cop mysteries!
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Loved the entire book...up until the last 30 pages. I felt like the end was rushed and she just wanted to get the book over with.  Wonderful characters and story line.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Started off a little slow but had a lot of good twists to the story.unfortunately the ending was very anticlimactic and I was very disappointed.overall an okay read, it kept my attention going it would have more of a happy ending
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This book is great. It isn't one off those predictable love stories. I was literally saying oh my god while reading it because of 'the plot twists
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|I would recommend this movie to people who like Lee Pace as an actor, and who like artistic movies with a heart.  It's one of those movies that I needed to go back and watch again once I had worked my way through the mysteries.  It's visually stunning and Lee Pace's performance is heart wrenching.  His relationship with a little girl he meets while recovering from &#34;the fall&#34; is lovely.
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|This was an awesome book wait till you see the movie<br />Looks like I'm out of paper the end. Keely
1451696191|5.0|I've read this book time after time and it never lets me down. If you've only seen the movie you must go out and purchase this book. It won't you let you down.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Can't beat the price. It's Blu-Ray delivering an incredible Batman experience. It's pretty simple and straight forward, nothing more to say.
B00005JO9J|2.0|WHAT THE HECK HAPPENED TO THE ORIGINAL STORY LINE OF THIS SHOW..IT'S NOW ALL ABOUT SEX, SUICIDE, AFFAIRS, BLAH BLAH BLAH....SOAP OPERA DRAMA.!
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|I haver aways enjoyed the music from Les Miserables.  It is somewhat different than most recordings I have enjoyed.  It is not my favorite but I enjoyed it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great app. Lots of fun... I love it my kids love it... And its free. How much better does it get?
B003SHYVO8|4.0|This movie makes you want to get up and dance with them. The people are really good at the parts that they play.
B009CG3M1C|4.0|Great movie, especially in HD! Another added bonus is seeing the beautiful Brooklyn Decker on film. She is one of the most beautiful models ever! The movie is far fetched but a great visual experience.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|I like this and my kids love it. the only thing that I don't like it that you have to get 3 stars to get into some of the levels that are higher or you have to pay more money.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Love playing Angry Birds.  It fills empty minutes....can leave the game and come back...love it.  The red birds seem to be useless.  They don't have any other action than just landing.
0385484518|3.0|Yup, the things we can learn from hardship.  Not that we would chose it, but great reality check.  Makes me appreciate the twists and turns of life that depend our character and reform our values.  Tough going to actually step by step accompany a friend to death's door.
B004GVUPFE|3.0|I'm on the Novice level and the game gets difficult quickly.  I can't get passed certain levels and I'm stuck.  Can't tell you how many times I've started over.
020530902X|5.0|Recommended to me, and great for anyone who is unsure of some of the intricacies of grammer and usage.  Used it to answer questions for my daughter's college writing.
B009X01GJ2|3.0|I like the looks of the product...love the purple color BUT it's heavy.  I like to use my Kindle Kire in bed and it's hard to hold up...not very good on my wrist.  Quality of the case seems good.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Definitely read.  Life changing if you want to think clearly, if your head is going to work right.  Makes you really think about the way food gets to our table without really being known if it is safe for consumption, and the most basic foods that we take for granted.  So who says the farmers aren't out to make a buck like everyone else.  They sure look like the salt of the earth, and would tell you they are, but maybe they don't even know what they are growing.  In other words, what has happened to the seed of long ago?  A question that is worth examining.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|Love my Angry little birds.  I like playing the free version so much that I am considering getting the pay version just to get rid of the ads.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|The read is a bit ponderous, but there are some brilliant parts. Unfortunately, there are lots of parts that are difficult to read and I tended to skim over them. I found it timely to read now, with the cinema production just released. Having said that, one has to be disciplined to read this book, but the occasional diamonds in the rough make it worth it.
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|Can't figure out how to play the game.  Maybe there's a tutorial that I'm not seeing.  I had hoped I would like it.  Thinking of deleting the app.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|It had a great mix of humor and singing. Lots of light heart drama. The male love interest was rather obnoxious but overall i enjoyed.
B005QSS53U|4.0|The movie was great with lots of old fashioned spookiness.  This is a good lights out popcorn eating movie that works for the whole family.  Maybe 12 and up, there were a few blue-ish moments.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|A very good read. Lots of action and techno warfare that could really happen. If you like thrillers you need to read this one.
B001UV4XFG|3.0|The entire &#34;Twilight Saga&#34; plot was interesting but the Actors? There are other Actors and Actresses out there which could easily have made it a winner. Thank you for your attention.
B0081L37Z0|4.0|I had no issues streaming or renting the movie, worth watching on Amazon, would consider watching more on the site
B0028RXXE8|5.0|I gave this DVD a full five stars. The writer must have studied many of the Roman Historians and Philosophers - Like Tacitus,<br />Cato and many others.
B0090EJR1K|3.0|I had high hopes for this movie being recommended by a slew of people. My wife and I watched it and were shockingly surprised of how dull this movie was. The trailer pretty much shows all the funny parts in my opinion while the rest leaves you wanting to laugh at the offensive jokes. Others will find the complete movie hilarious, we didn't.  If you completed and laughed through the Hangover series, you'll enjoy this.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|I gave this a full five stars. This DVD definitely added to One imagination. The plot to some thinking and then is began to unfold and One's attention continued on until the end. The Writer did an excellent job by making good use of Austro-Hungarian History/Fiction.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This was my favorite of all 3 books.  Really delved into their relationship and both of their histories, especially Christian's.
B00009ZYBY|5.0|I gave this a full five stars. The Writer definitely made good use of Roman History. Thank you for your attention.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This really ties up all loose ends of the story.  Must read to the end to really understand it all.
B0018CMJSU|5.0|I rated this DVD a full five stars. Coppola's Addendum answered many questions and I can now understand his excellent ability to put together all past facts about the Cosa Nostra. Thank you for your attention.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have never read another book like this before!  It is definitely very descriptive and brings you right in, but it is also a love story.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This app is free, easy and fun. I've experienced no pop-up ads like with some apps.  I recommend this if you enjoy solitare.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|There are so many great story lines going on it this series and they all have me on the edge of my seat!  I love that even the characters who appear to be unlikable grow on you and you begin to have simpathy for their character as you get to know them.  From the upstairs story lines to the downstairs servants lives - it all is interesting and how they work together is amazing.
B0030Y11XS|5.0|When I watched this movie, it was like reliving parts of my lifetime. So many of the things that happened  . . did so when I was working and I experienced so much of the same thing that made up the movie
B002APU580|5.0|I love period films but this one is my favorite of them all!  The chemistry between Knightley and Macfadyen is amazing as well as the spirited dialogues that they share throughout the movie.  I have watched this film over 10 times and still love seeing it all unfold.  The directors commentary is fun to hear as well - and very satisfying to hear that things I saw and imagined whilst watching it were in fact true.  They took a few liberties but bravo for them because they worked splendidly! For those who might be on the fence about buying this dvd - go for it!  You won't be sorry!  Even my husband who is not the biggest fan of period films loves this one simply because of the amazing dialogues!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was absolutely amazing.  This is my first review and I can't even put in to words right now how heartfelt this book was.  I couldn't put it down.  It's difficult to read while taking care of a house full of kids, a husband, taking care of the house and working but I managed to get this book read in 2 days.  I was so captivated by the characters.  They felt so incredibly real to me.  In all the books I have read I have only ever teared up reading the slammed series and hopeless.  I am dying to read your next book!
1118109791|4.0|The practice problems are great and a wonderful resource. That alone is worth four-stars.<br /><br />But I literally did not look at any of the instruction or tips (except for test-taking procedure). For that, I used the Manhattan GMAT set of study guides.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and buy this book. It's cheap. Do the practice problems in a methodical way and study them. But you're probably going to want a more comprehensive study guide. Don't expect the OG to teach you much.
B00992CF6W|3.0|needs caves hunger bar and skin's and everything PC has that would be a five star game but I'm going to give it a 3 and a half
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was a wonderful conclusion to a wonderful series!  It was heart wrenching and orbiting both at the same time.  I read all 3 books straight through.
1881273873|5.0|This book is wonderful, and it arrived to me in great quality! Even read the book twice and was in a book club about it.
B002QKZLZ6|2.0|1. No clip or a hook for attachment to a belt, or pants.<br /><br />2. Not leather.<br /><br />I do not recommend this product.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|It's a lot of fun. It's a great game to pick up &amp; play even for a few minutes. I love how the coins regenerate.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|Thanks to you I got a chance to read this lovely book I appreciate apply writing it for me so thank you
1451696205|5.0|Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.<br /><br />I'm going to be completely honest and say that the only reason I decided to check this out was because of the film adaption. To tell you the truth I had never heard of it prior to me seeing the first trailer for the film, but I'm glad I did. Leading up to the film's release I told myself that I was going to read the book before I went to the theater so a week before the movie came out that's exactly what I did... three times. In one week I managed to read this book three times and I have read it three more times since then. It's fantastic.<br /><br />For those of you unaware The Perks of Being a Wallflower is an epistolary novel following the life of a young boy named Charlie through his first year of high school. The book is written in the form of letters where Charlie keeps you updated about what's going on and gives you a little insight into his past along the way. He starts the first letter by letting the reader know that he's changed the names of the people and he hopes that you don't try to find out who he is. He just needs to know that someone like you exists in the world.<br /><br />Now many people, including myself, were expecting to find out who exactly he was writing to at the end, but that's not what happened. Upon doing some research after I first read the novel many people are under the impression that Stephen Chbosky, the author, wanted the reader to be the recipient. That's why Charlie never gave specifics as to who you were because the reader could be anyone in the world. It could be his neighbor or someone that lived on the same street as him in the past. Once you go into the book with that kind of mind state it makes the experience even more enjoyable. It makes you feel that you're connected to this character.<br /><br />I only have one complaint about the story. I've read some other people mention this and I completely agree. While I was flipping through these pages it felt like Chboskymade it a point to pick out every major topic he could think of. Just to have a brief idea of what I'm talking about Chbosky includes: abortion, underage sex, underage drinking, homosexuality, rape, molestation, and abusive relationships. That's just a handful of things, there's more. Now I don't have a problem with any of these subjects, but it's highly unlikely that any high school student is going to experience all of this during his or her short life. It doesn't feel overwhelming, it just doesn't feel extremely believable.<br /><br />As a whole I felt this story was phenomenal. It's filled with good times and bad times and it's just about a boy trying to survive high school. I'm sure everyone can relate to that. Throughout these 224 pages you'll meet, and fall in love with, many characters each with their own individual personalities. What's even better is these characters, just like Charlie, all feel like people you would meet in real life. No one is made out to be some extraordinary member of society. They're just normal people in a normal school.<br /><br />Overall Score: 9/10 - The Perks of Being a Wallflower is truly something special. You feel a real emotional connection with this character and the other supporting characters that you meet along the way. Even though I did have a small issue with the author's inclusion of so many huge topics in such a short novel it doesn't ruin the book and I would definitely recommend you give this a read. If you're a fast reader and you have some time on your hands then you could probably knock it out in an afternoon.
B003O86FMW|4.0|The second installment in the \\"Hunger Games\\" trilogy, continues to chronicle the misadventures of our teenage heroine, Katniss Everdeen. Growing dissent throughout the district's culminates in dramatic fashion at the announcement of the 75th hunger games. Drama and carnage to ensue. Delightfully written with much of the original cast plus a few new players and a fun twist at the end. Really builds suspense for the climax that is the final novel.
B008F9E306|4.0|Over the past four-five years T.I. has kind of made himself the train-wreck artist in commercial Hip Hop. He would do something stupid, get arrested  and then make an album full of \\"apology\\" songs. While the formula worked with 2008's Paper Trail, it lost some of its power when he used it yet again on 2010's No Mercy. Thankfully T.I. has decided to ditch that formula and, instead, is embracing who he really is. While I thought this would be an album about him admitting he has some personal issues, it turns out he doesn't really take the blame for anything that's happened. Even going as far as saying trouble just follows him around.<br /><br />While I may not agree with his ass-backwards way of thinking, Trouble Man winds up being somewhat enjoyable. However, the problem I have with this album is its inconsistency. Not only as a whole, but individually these songs are inconsistent with themselves. Some songs have a good beat with some good verses from T.I., but they suffer from a terrible hook. Some songs have a terrible hook and guest appearance, but T.I. completely dominates on his verses (see the A$AP Rocky assisted \\"Wildside\\"). Then there are others that can't seem to do anything right (see \\"Cruisin'\\" and the album's first single \\"Ball\\").<br /><br />Another thing is that this album is severely lacking in the trap music department. I'm talking about that old school T.I. that made you feel you were working a corner  in the A. There were a few songs on here that tried to fill that void, but it just wasn't the same. You could tell they didn't come as easy as they have in the past and there just wasn't enough of them. Instead, this album is filled with a lot of songs where T.I. gets serious and makes some personal music. The Andre 3000 assisted \\"Sorry\\" and the P!nk assisted \\"Guns and Roses\\" come to mind.<br /><br />The guest artists on here leave a lot to be desired. When I first looked at the tracklist the only guest appearances that got me excited were Andre 3000 and Akon. You also get a verses from Meek Mill, A$AP Rocky, and Lil Wayne. Then you have R. Kelly and P!nk lending hook support on \\"Can You Learn\\" and \\"Guns and Roses\\" respectively. While I'm not really a fan of R. Kelly or P!nk I have to admit they both came through on their songs. If the label decides to push \\"Guns and Roses\\" it has the potential to become as big as Em's \\"Love The Way You Lie\\".<br /><br />Standout Songs: \\"Trap Back Jumpin'\\", \\"Sorry (Feat. Andre 3000)\\" & \\"Addresses\\"<br /><br />Overall Score: 7/10 - While this definitely isn't T.I.'s best effort it isn't terrible. However, just like his last album, most of the songs on here never excel past the level of \\"good\\" or \\"ok\\" and it winds up bringing this album down. Still, if you're a fan of T.I. I would recommend giving this a listen.
1402270275|5.0|Odered this book based on \\"steampunk\\" romance search - and really enjoyed it.  The world the author creates of the \\"haves\\" and \\"have-nots\\" is excellent and the paranormal (vampires, werewolves) excellent (but not all-encompassing).  The romance is first rate -- looking forward to the next in the series.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|i knew that when I looked at the game I would love it I already have 25 prices and my brother has 13 :) &lt;3 _ _
B009LHWEKW|4.0|For a while there I thought the show had jumped the shark.  Everything seems to be back on track now.  Can't wait to see what's next!
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I can't wait for the season to begin. This needs 12 more words. I'm not sure what else to write.
B00A9C3RB8|2.0|This movie is sad. It is geared toward the nursing home crowd. It was painful to watch. I don't recommend it unless you are having trouble sleeping.
B007MC0IAG|5.0|A very well written  & informative book.The book outlines a lot of  basic and elementary phenomena related to Darwin thinking!
0385536828|1.0|The book is dificult reading.  Very British so you really have to think a lot about what is being said.  Its written like a diary in terms we in the United States who are not from England are not readily familar.  I am into it about 50 pages and will finish it, but it is not fun nor very interesting.  So far all I see is a young woman, daughter of a Bishop who is enjoying numerous affairs but somehow is being recruited as an agent.  (I think)  Hopefully the story line gets better.  Wish I had not spent the money.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|fantastic fun. not really into arena genre but this one is quite enjoyable and playable without hero purchase! go ahead its free!
0316069434|5.0|Excellent book.  Couldn't wait to finish it and then was sad when it was over.  Recommend highly.  Great story line and you learn a bit more about what makes Harry Bosch tick.
B001VNB54A|4.0|We loved Band of Brothers, so we went ahead and got a copy of The Pacific, expecting something along those lines. It was made close to ten years later when the HBO viewing public expects more gore, more cussing, and more sex. A lot of it was unnecessary, especially the unnatural amount of blood and guts (literally) toward the last few episodes. All that being said, it was very entertaining and told a story not often heard... but more in a drama setting and less of a docudrama.
B009E3EWPI|5.0|love, love, loved it.awesome cd and dvd. wish we could have been there live. we are huge led zeppelin fans.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Great app--I use it all the time on my kindle.  The descriptions and reviews are easily accessible, and much easier than reading on my phone!

B001GKJ2FW|5.0|I liked this movie because it made me want to get up and dance.  It's fun to watch periodically, by yourself or with a group.
B0095R64AO|4.0|Starts out great, then SOOOOO SLOOOOOW in the middle.  The end was cute but it took a little too long to get there.
B004FEFS5E|5.0|This book was recommended by the author of another photography book, and I will say that for me it resulted in a quantum leap in the quality of my shots.  It's told in folksy fashion with lots and lots of comparison photos, so it's an easy read.  Plus, the author throws in lots of tidbits about techniques and anecdotes that also help enhance the photo output.  I'm very grateful that I found this guide.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I was drawn in again almost from the first moment. Loved it!  I always appreciate a good book ,that keeps you entertained without anything that I find offensive. Just good quality reading and now onto the next book.
B00AA0TJO8|3.0|Fun Concept.  There is a bit of a learning curve on how to use each new tool.  Its also difficult to accurately draw on smaller devices.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I used to live in France and I am missing french radios. Tunein Radio Pro allows me to listen to them in addition to record them while I'm at work using wifi and listen to them on my way home. Iphone and Android versions are identical. The pro version allows you to record while the standard version will not.
B000F1IQNM|5.0|One of the all time best family movies out.  Even though it has been on the market for a couple of years, it is still a great movie for the whole family to enjoy.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This app has outstanding graphic and gives you all the info that you need to maintain your Kindle Fire HD. It is well worth two dollars!!
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|Love, love the classics and this is one of my favorites.  It was such a wholesome time and the little things brought such pleasure.  What happened to those times.  Great way to get lost in the past.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Good graphics and interesting twists to storyline.  Game was priced fairly.  Only complaint is that it only took about 4 hours to complete.  Way to short.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Written so well it's almost believable.  The characters are deep.  The \\"dogs\\" added suspense, but were hard to imagine as being real.
B00846REIS|5.0|I couldn't put it down! So much better than Fifty Shades. The story line is so much more thought out! The characters are even better! Cannot wait to read the next book! Buying it now!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is a must-read!!! I read this book in 3 days and couldn't put it down! I will read it again and again
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I LOVE this show.  It is the best thing on TV right now, and each week is fantastic.  Start with Season ONe to get the<br />whole story.
B0047WJ12K|5.0|I've always loved the \\"Alien\\" series  for their suspense and intense action. Inception is now in my collection right beside them. It should be a favorite of science fiction fans. Many of the concepts of the movie incorporate the experiences of everyday dreams that people have such as a sensation of falling will wake a dreamer up or that pain can be experienced in dreams. If you can surrender to the concept that a machine can be built to gain entrance to another persons dreams for the purpose of manipulation and industrial espionage then \\"Inception\\"  becomes all to real. A nail biter and edge of the seat movie that I'll watch over and over. I was pleased with Leonardo Dicaprio's performance. Since \\"Titanic\\" he has become a very mature and superb actor. He turned in a stunning performance. Way to go Leonardo. The $9.00 I paid for the DVD was well spent.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was very good read,I loved it! I'm looking forward of what happens in the last book of the trilogy.  Awesome book!
B00003CXA6|5.0|I was a &#34;background artist&#34; foe this movie.  Spent 2 weeks on set.  Although there are some flaws, it gave a good depiction of the struggles of this terrible war.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Beautifully engaging. What I find so incredible about this show is the vastness of its appeal. My father who basically hates anything that is remotely like Jane Austin, loves this show.
B007FJFDXS|5.0|This game is awesome! challenging to me. Sometimes i play it at work to relieve stress! I would definately recommend it!
B00785P2QC|5.0|I am hooked on this. Lots of fun to kill some time with. Runs smooth and has decent graphics. I recommend this for all ages.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I love this game. It is a very simple way to relax and keep your mind busy. The music is beautiful in which case the game is more relaxing with the sound on lol ... perfect game not to hard and not to easy and for those who find a few of the puzzles to hard there is a hint button defiantly worth buying .
B001EN71HC|4.0|This pack contains all three full length movies in Blu Ray format, but contains absolutely no extras.  Not a big deal to me as the price I paid was a steal, but if you're looking for extras, they aren't in this set.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I thought I could predict this novel, but it surprised me at every turn!  Very fun vacation read!  I highly recommend it to people who like a complex, entertaining mystery.
B002NXSRX4|5.0|The Blue-Ray edition was just Awesome very much recommended!  The digital copy of this disc works flawlessly on mobile devices.
B0065CCM76|5.0|Bob Seger has been one of my absolute favorites since I was a teenager in the late 70's.  The music is just as alive today as it was then.  Great stuff.  This collction has all of the hits you would expect in a Bob Seger greatest hits.
B004J4XGN6|5.0|This book is an excellent resource for Entrepreneurs.  Updated for the modern business environment.<br />Here's another one, a good summary of this book.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0092QUNSC Summary: The Lean Startup ...in 30 Minutes - A Concise Summary of Eric Ries' Bestselling Book (30 Minute Expert Summaries)]]
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Could not put this book down! <<<<<<<(Eagerly buying sequel) Surprisingly easy to identify with characters and become engulfed in flowing story line, like riding on the world's greatest roller coaster (blindfolded, of course!!!).
B0011Z3334|5.0|LONG LIVE THIS BAND!!! This is one of those albums that you buy where EVERY song on it is your favorite (as apposed to some band's albums that you get just for the 2 out of 12 good songs on it :)
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was a page turner and in true Nicholas Sparks fashion he made you fall in love with the characters. I didn't want to put it down. If you have read any other of Nicholas Sparks books and liked them even the slightest bit, this is well worth your read
B0055OG2BC|1.0|Whilst I love this movie for all its quirkiness the quality of this Blu Ray version is no better than my standard DVD version I have had for a number of years. There appears to be no remastering undertaken other than the menu details.<br /><br />Save yourself money and get the standard DVD version at a cheaper price.
B000I0QM04|5.0|Seeing this movie in Blu-ray makes the action and special effects jump out and the sound quality is geat making it that much better.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|This movie is OK.  Not one of Bruce Willis's best but i was entertained.  If you like Bruce, keep in mind that he is not the main character in this movie...
B008WCP2KG|4.0|Okay, I'm no young thang but I loved watching Channing Tatum in this movie. I loved the dancing and the fine men.  Maybe the acting and plot weren't Oscar worthy but I didn't expect that when I rented this movie.<br /><br />Yes, I rented it and felt like I should be wearing shades and a disguise.  After all, Grandma renting a stripper movie. Oh well, I did and I enjoyed it.<br /><br />It's about time there was a movie out there for us women to enjoy.  I felt like I had the Chippendale dancers in my living room.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Really enjoying this reboot of the Sherlock Holmes story: Jonny Lee Miller, Lucy Liu, Aiden Quinn are all in top form; chemisty between the leads really makes it worthwhile.
B004ZGI1V0|3.0|This movie (like Safe House and some others) are ok if you haven't already watched the Bourne trilogy. These movies seem to be spin-offs of the Bourne trilogy and just have a feel of a cheap knock-off. If I hadn't watched the Bourne trilogy, I probably could have rated it higher, maybe.<br /><br />What I didn't like was that almost all the flashback scenes are &#34;steamy&#34;. Really? That's all the character can or would flashback to? Those are the most important &#34;memories&#34; ?? Laughably, but at the same time disappointingly, stupid. Just dumb and an example of more of the same - gratuitous, useless sexuality. At least it wasn't fully explicit or overly frequent (still disappointing).
0765325950|5.0|I haven't yet read the book as it won't be available in my country until next week and it would've been great to get hold of kindle version. But that doesn't mean I'll go out and give it the minimum rating in what amounts to a misdirected attack.<br />This 5 star unread review is in response to the fans who gave 1 star because of non-availability of kindle version. Driving down the rating of actual product because you didn't like the medium is very harsh on the author and quite unfair.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|I really enjoy these types of games that you have to find items and do other mini games. This game plays well. Hopefully they'll add more levels in future updates. Another thing that's missing is the ability to zoom, but it hasn't been a problem.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I just wish the third novel was available right now! I can't wait to see where these two functioning dysfunctional will go next.
B005ZMUXDC|5.0|This is my little girl's favorite movie so it was a must to have it downloaded on the kindle for those times when we have to have a quiet 2yr old for an extended period of time!!
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|really enjoyed this movie! Very different story line than most holly wood movies of late. you should rent it tonight
B00A757EFW|3.0|Using my finger to manuever I cannot keep track of Pac-Man to see where I want him to go.  Should be able to use a thin stylus.
B008Q0DAXK|5.0|I have loved this movie for as long as i can remember! It never disappoints! Will keep this movie forever!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Don't use it often but like having it available when I need to use a calculator especially when I am not at home.
B008F5YDRI|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. Simple and sweet. The actors were great and a very nice storyline. Would highly recommend
B005PK553C|5.0|This show was like a great Stephen King novel, with a little more gore.  Story line was superb and enthralling, got you to tune in each week.  The way the show interacted different characters from the past and from prior episodes was really cool.<br />The actors on this show were very good, very believable, and Jessica Lange is in a class of her own, fantastic actress.<br />Really great surprise ending!
B000V8A95C|5.0|Fantastic music--clever lyrics for fun, catchy tunes like &#34;Popular&#34; and &#34;The Wizard and I&#34;. My favorite song is &#34;For Good&#34;, which is just lovely.
0553278398|5.0|I bought the complete series of the Foundation for my husband, because he hadn't read it before. There are 7 books, not three, and I can say that Isaac Assimov is one of the great brains of the past century. His story about the History of the future is so awesome!
B005HI4LMS|5.0|I'm a huge horror fan. I came across this movie kinda by accident. It is hilarious!!! I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good laugh. This movie is awesome!
B007ZGO7EM|2.0|Good calculator, but does not give you many options. I am an algebra student in eighth grade and need to use a lot the square root button.
B00A9X9TIW|2.0|This was a very strange movie with violence aimed at and from children. This seems most inappropriate considering the horror that this represents when it's actually played out. I like dystopic and sci fi movies but even there I think there should be some boundaries which this movie grossly overstepped.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|Really enjoyed this book. So well written!<br />Kept my interest from beginnig to end and stayed with me for a long time after.
B0058VW36U|4.0|The game of &#34;Cut the Rope&#34; is a great mind game; for young and old alike. My grandson delights in helping me play and usually cuts just the right one.
B005LAJ1H2|5.0|Love this series.<br />The stories are so well written and the actors are so well cast. Can't wait for season three to go on sale.
B00A9X9TIW|2.0|The trailer I saw portrayed a lot more action. I also felt as they didn't really bother to explain a lot of what was going on, I feel as a lot of the movie could have been cut out all together while adding to certain elements, the best way I can think to describe it without giving away plot is to call it a long-short film. It was drawn out in many parts that felt unnecessary while key plot points where barley touched.  I didn't like it.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Love the series. Love the actors, the story and everything about it. Can't wait for the next season! Katey sagal is amazing. Awesome writing by her husband.
0307272702|4.0|A very good read.  I hope to add it's lessons to my life so that I can lose about 30 pounds.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I absolutely love this series. I can't wait to get season 2. Claire Danes is aweome. It is exciting , and a great action filled series.
B006CQLGXG|4.0|Great classic read. This book is wonderful to read time after time.  Charles is an amazing writer and his book is hard to put down.
B00849D5ME|5.0|[[ASIN:B00849D5ME We Need to Talk About Kevin: A Novel]]About Kevin, Relevant, From an entirely different perspective I found Fascinating & engrossing.  Must Read.  Definitely her best work!  A mothers own unfiltered realistic look at her own child, a father's love & it's blind spots.
B005DOKM9M|1.0|I ordered this for my 7&#34; kindle that I got for Christmas, but the kindle does not fit in the sleeve.  The sleeve will not zip at all with the kindle inside.  I found this very ironic due to the fact that this is an amazon product (who makes the kindle)!
0070511136|5.0|My son spent much more for his new book for a college class. This book is in mint condition and was a fraction of the cost of a new book. I can't wait to get some down time to read it.
B00AEFVRB2|4.0|My son recommended this movie to me, and I found it dark and violent. Later he told me about the author and some background, so I appreciated it more. It's a difficult story, but so well acted and directed that I'd recommend to anyone who can deal with violence in movies.
B008EK91XU|5.0|Great read.  This very private person must have dug deep to write so openly about himself.  Hope his dreams come true
B00APUQT7I|5.0|It is a fun, entertaining movie. The grandkids had seen it at the movie but wanted to watch it again. It gave me a chance to see it and enjoy it with them.
B006CQLGXG|4.0|A classic, what else does one need to say. Amazon says I have to say 11 more words to submit.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I love this movie. The book was also fantastic.<br /><br />I think Katniss is a very positive role model for young girls
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I couldn't put it down!!!! Wonderfully written with careful precision to have you wondering what is next to come. The best!
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|I thought this is was surprisingly good movie. Very creative plot that provoked very cool converations. The acting was good as well.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is my second day reading hunger games, and second book done. Can't wait for the next! Team peeta or gale?
B005H5H3LW|2.0|i bought this because i'd been a big fan of the animated television series as a child.  the film has its moments, and starts off well-enough.  the forced trailers, etcetera, before the film begins, are horrible to endure - and you can't skip through them at all.  honestly, having only watched it once, i don't even quite recall how it all wraps up in this film version.  and i could never muster the enthusiasm to watch it a second time.
B000LGZHDS|5.0|My daughter loves her Gary beanie! I bought the spongebob beanie the same time I bought Gary and when I opened the box, I couldnt believe how big Gary was! He looked huge compared to spongebob (they are about the same size though), but for some reason Gary looks bigger. Excellent beanie baby!
B00337KMAA|4.0|I like the premise of the movie and the three leading characters have great chemistry.  I love how they took a mundane occupation and gave it some spice.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|especially the liberal media and politicians who would not be here if it was not for these brave Navy Seals
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Intense and engaging from the start, this book doesn't let you put it down. Excellent end to a masterful trilogy
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Over the past 10 years i have purchased several Rod Stewart CDs for myself as well as my Mother.  She loved him way back when, and loves his new standards.  She takes the CDs to the retirement home that she works at and shares with the residents who really enjoy them, this Christmas CD was no different - it was a huge hit with the over 60 crowd!
B00123AYNM|5.0|Porcupine Tree is the real deal - thoughtful, interesting progressive rock that isn't 30 years old. This is a great album, but then all their music is great. Recommended.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I usually don't like games and I am very picky about games but this one is just so interesting! I don't get bored and I keep coming back to get more and more challenges

B000BTC5LW|5.0|The other reviews here are pretty much spot on. I was amazed by the quality of sound this DVD version provides. Now I think I understand all the delays that were involved in getting this DVD version released. I watched it start to finish today and was taken aback. Having witnessed the Delicate Sound of Thunder at Texas Stadium back in '87, under the influence of hallucinagenic fun time stuff (dont get all hoity toity on me, David Gilmour even admitted that show was designed to &#34;enhance&#34; the trip, plus most of you old farts were tripping right there beside me), there will never be an equal to that experience.<br /><br />That was one of the last times I dropped Acid so I didnt get the full-effect that this DVD probably has to offer. If you happen to dabble in that stuff still, I suggest a four-way fighter pilot harness attached to your couch. This concert is incredible. Excellent performance.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|This was a fantastic purchase, you get both formats DVD and Blue ray so you can watch however it fits your needs
B0062KMDZ2|4.0|Certainly not an \\"A\\" class movie, but it's a good escape \\"B\\" movie. There's a good mine car sequence, very reminiscent of Temple of Doom, but it pops in 3D.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I'm speechless. This book keep me on the edge of my of seat. I didn't know what to expect to happen next. All the ladies I work with told me to read this book and now I'm passing it on. I can't wait to check out all the other books by Jodi Picoult.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Best book ever. Done. Decided. No question. Wonderful close to the series. Just be sure not to skip the epilogue.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Once Upon a Time is one of the most creatively written shows I have watched. The spins they put on the old fairy tale stories are interesting and captivating. The stories always tie characters together even when you don't think they would fit. Great show. Worthwhile to watch from season 1.
B00ACBN9CI|4.0|You beter be on your game!! Fast, fun, good graphics, don't forget to lead your target and save the ammo, short bursts.

B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Just the start of the game alone was one of the coolest starts for a game that didn't cost a lot to get and it just gets better and better after that
B0097NGUJG|5.0|Please do yourself a a favor and buy this album now! I have been obsessively listening to this ever since i first read about the band on NPR. The music is ethereal and sensual at the same time, sort of a cross between Radiohead and Fleet Foxes in my opinion. The use of synths and acoustic guitars plus the peculiar voice of the lead singer make  for a fascinating electro-pop/folk hybrid album. There are lots of little surprises and twists in every song that keep you coming back, so please give these guys a listen!
0375851569|5.0|Bought this as a start for my granddaughter's library. Can't wait to read these with her. My kids loved to read all these books each night before bed.
0857860801|5.0|It is fun to see more of Simons cat(s) in so many different environments ... Simon does a great job of setting the scene and adding hilarity at the same time. It helps that I have a cat just like Simons. :-). If you like Simons cat, you will love this book!!!

0345803485|1.0|Oh my. Oh crap, and double crap.<br /><br />I hesitated before writing this review because I don't really want to admit to the wider world that I read this book. So first of all, let me explain why I read it: I'd been taking a firm stand against reading it to all the so-called, possibly former friends who insisted I should read it, so I finally decided to read the damn book so I could criticize it properly.<br /><br />I think it's the worst addition that's ever been made to world literature. Why? I've read books that are even more poorly written (shocking, but true) with weaker plots and less compelling characters. (Of course, even those books had characters and storylines that were at least original, not ripped off and bastardized from another best-selling author.) But here's the difference: Those books have not become a worldwide cult phenomenon. They've not reached best-seller status. They're not inspiring Hollywood. (Which, reeeallly? How could this crap-and-double-crap be made into anything but a porno film?)<br /><br />In a society whose culture has gone down the toilet, the popularity of these books is the lump that's clogged it and caused excrement to stream down its sides.<br /><br />I think my biggest surprise in reading Fifty Shades of Grey (and I'll admit, happily, that I haven't read Fifty Shades Darker or Fifty Shades Freed, and I don't plan to) is that it didn't shock me, not in the way I expected to be shocked. I knew going in that the book was poorly written. I'd read a Kindle sample more than a year ago, while it was still e-pubbed and cheap (before it was picked up and edited by a division of Random House), and I'd promptly clicked \\"Permanently Delete from My Device.\\"<br /><br />I knew the book was heavy on sex, light on plot. I knew it was classed as BDSM. However, what E L James has done here is a BDSM cliché. I've never read the genre and I don't know anything about the world of sub-dom sex, but if I were going to try to write about this worldwithout doing any research, Christian Grey's red-walled \\"playroom\\" is exactly what it would look like. Somehow I doubt it reflects the true, dark underbelly of sexual dysfunction.<br /><br />Now for the writing:<br />Oh, oh, oh, where to start. The characters are not well-drawn. In fact, they're not drawn at all. E L James has taken Stephenie Meyer's entire cast of Twilight characters and watered it down to a 1-D, cartoon-esque version of the original.<br /><br />The main character, Anastasia Steele, is particularly flat. Her decisions and emotions aren't ones a rational human, or any human, would make or feel. Her relationships with other characters -- and the ways other characters view her -- don't make sense and aren't backed up by the author's showing and telling. (Oh, the telling. And the telling and telling and telling.) I won't even go into Christian Grey. Really. I just won't.<br /><br />Possibly the most well-drawn characters in this book are Ana's Inner Goddess and her Subconscious, and I just wanted to shoot them each between the eyes with a BB gun to make them shut up. Note to author: Personification of the subconscious = not a good idea.<br /><br />I could go on for days about the characters and the reasons they don't work, but I'll boil it down to this: They. Are. Not. Believable. Not one of them. That's what happens when a writer doesn't put any work into developing her characters, but rather steals characters from another author with no understanding of what made those characters tick. It's one of many reasons this book falls flat. Plot? Same thing. It seems every time the author wasn't sure where to go next, she read the next few chapters of Twilight and put her characters in flimsy recreations of the other book's circumstances.<br /><br />Oh, wait, right. This was written as fan fiction.<br /><br />Now for the mechanics of the writing:<br />If repetition were the way to produce good fiction, whoa, baby, would EL James have hit the mark.<br />If repetition were the way to produce good fiction, whoa, baby, would EL James have hit the mark.<br />If repetition were the way to produce good fiction, whoa, baby, would EL James have hit the mark.<br /><br />That's pretty much all I have to say about that.<br /><br />Now for the use of setting:<br />News flash, EL James: Your characters live in the United States. Americans don't wax poetic about the way we take our tea, we don't use the phrase \\"smart\\" to describe someone's appearance, and we don't know what a \\"marquee\\" is, at least not in the context of a college graduation venue. Ever heard of research? You know, you could have set the novel in the UK and spared yourself some embarrassment. But wait, Twilight's characters were based in northern Washington.<br /><br />Right.<br /><br />In conclusion (thank heavens), I go back to what I said earlier about not being shocked in the way I'd expected to be shocked. I'd heard enough people sing this book's praises that I expected to at least be entertained. I wasn't. The only thing that kept me turning pages was an intense desire to get this book finished and out of my life. My advice to you? Don't read it. Don't even read it for the reason I finally gave in and read it. There is nothing about this piece of trash that makes it worth the time you'll spend turning its pages.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|Christian Bale excellent job.  I'm a big fan of any Batman movie but this one was just awesome. Thank you
B0099TJ4YQ|5.0|I have loved James Taylor's music for years and will continue to. This is a great CD. I would recommend it to long-term JT fans or someone who is new to his music. If you get a chance, see him at a concert. He is amazing.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|Be a fan since the first one.  Just had to have it.  Are you kidding!  Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones the best combination ever!!
B00APUYWYA|4.0|I wish it was made PG, though, because my pre teen would have loved it!  I get that they were trying for an older crowd, but I ink they missed their market. Ah, but what do I know? :)
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I have it on my i-phone and use it often.  I can also check the weather at my traveling destinations.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|These are just like the computer games only easier to navigate with touch screen. I cant wait for the next part to come out!
B0063GORYU|5.0|Helps to kill time while you are waiting.  Larger on the Kindle than on my i-phone.  What else can I say.
B000NYT1M6|4.0|I love the fact that this truck looks so real.  What great detail!!  That is great.  The reason I rated it a 4 is because it is a little cheaply made.  We have had doors fall off already.  With 2 rough boys I don't know how long it will last...which stinks because this was an expensive truck, but it by far their favorite truck to play with.
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|I usually use my calculator on my i-phone, it's handier.  Sorry I don't have any thing else to say about it.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Of course I love pinterest, but this app makes pinning original pins a bit harder than on the computer. I wish it had an easier pinning method.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Easier to play on Kindle then on your cell phone (the screen is bigger) but you may not always have your kindle with you.
B00908DDZM|5.0|It just is.  I can't get enough of it, and it's already been months of listening.<br /><br />There might come a day when i get tired of it, and even then it will still be at the top of my list.  So underrated.

030758836X|5.0|Read this book after seeing it on several Best of 2012 lists, and after a recommendation by a close friend. Aimlessly skimmed the first few paragraphs and was immediately hooked. If you find yourself watching \\"Dateline\\" on Friday nights with a bowl of chocolate ice cream then this book is definitely for you. I for one had no issue with the ending. In fact, whenever I hear someone gripe about how \\"awful\\" it is, I can't help but wonder exactly what kind of ending they expected, having come to know the two main characters throughout the book. I will definitely be checking out the rest of Gillian Flynn's books!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this. It is designed well and addictive! Waiting for more levels. I Highly recommend this for anyone who likes puzzles.
B002Z58GQS|4.0|I really like this little flash drive.  i choose it for its price and its others reviews.  I love that I am able to attach to my key-chain so I always have it with me.  I use it for transporting documentation from work to home and back.  It transfers files in a decent time. i think the only thing I would have like to seen on device is a little strap to keep from losing cap other than that great item.
0525958002|5.0|Great book by John Taylor. Has very much info on the beginnings of Duran Duran, the breakups, the reunion. if you're a DD fan, this book is a must read.
0525953728|5.0|this book was great and i usually am not into books like this. i originally got it for my hubby and he told me i had to read it thats how good it was so i did and i was hooked by the first chapter.
B00AWTTUHI|5.0|Definately as good as Part 1 if not better. I am a huge Batman fan and, although I might be in the minority here, I didn't really care to much for Frank Miller Batman comics because they were hard for me to follow. After watching both movies, the comics completely make sense. Bottom line, I would recommend Parts' 1 and 2 to anyone especially if you did not like the comics. Perfect follow up to Part 1.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Definitely lives up to Cornwell's tradition of excellent reads. Waiting impatiently on the next! Through research great character development. Enjoyable read.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I never thought that I would enjoy zombie shows, but the writers, directors, makeup people, etc. have taken that thought right out of my mind.  I'm looking forward to the second part of Season 3 !!
B0000C3I6U|5.0|This is the phenomenal cult classic that propelled bodybuilding into the lime light and launched the bodybuilding craze in America as well as transforming Arnorld Schwarzenegger into a household name.<br /><br />Primarily revolves around body building competitions, with the main focus being Arnorld's attempt to secure a six win for the Mr. Olympia competition, his training regimen and the posing routines he develops with the assistance of a ballet coach, and his major competition from Lou Ferrigno and Franco Colombo, with highlights on the fierce nature of the competition between Arnorld and Lou, as the latter is shown training equally hard, and going through posing routines with the help of his father.<br /><br />Also features interesting exchanges between the two, delightful tete-a-tete that is infused with subtle psychological attacks on one another in an attempt to undermine each other's confidence prior to the competition, sprinkled with humour.<br /><br />Also includes footage of Mike Katz as he prepares for the Mr. Universe competition, in a bid to unseat the current Mr. Universe, as well as an interesting expose on his background and personal life.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|There is no denial in the popularity of this show.  I didn't really get into the series and missed an episode or two in the beginning.  The only criticism I have is that season 1 is only 6 episodes.
0307592731|5.0|Just finished reading \\"Wild\\" by Cheryl Strayed.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|What a GRAND showing of the past! The actors, the costumes, the sets - all so wonderful! I love to &#34;lose&#34; myself in this show!
B009XHAM8G|5.0|I read this book a long time ago when my kids were little and now I am reading it to<br />my grandparent! Absolutely perfect!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Pitch Perfect was awesome!  I was laughing my butt off the entire time and the singing was amazing.  I plan to buy the DVD and make this a regular in the rotation.
B009B4ZEKM|4.0|Most of the songs were good. Didn't think the &#34;explicit&#34; one added anything to the Cd. Her voice is as usual unique. I would like her to try something different.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|It took me forever to figure out how to beat it on normal the first time, but the game is great and very addictive. Definitely worth the 99 cents!
B00005JKDR|5.0|Seriously, what is not to love - this story gets better every time you watch it.  As for the DVD, it's a DVD, works well and shows the movie, lol.  This was a novel story during a time when movies are just being rehashed or reformulated.  I love the concept and the solution at the end.  Love love Boo!
0470913029|5.0|I wanted to buy the Primal Blueprint and just to learn of other ideas for the diet I purchased this book.
B008L1VZS6|4.0|Great Verdi it ain't - therefore my 4 stars only - but not bad if you like Rossini and Donizetti !!<br /><br />On the other hand, the singers were wonderful, especially my all-time favorite Anna Caterina Antonacci. Not only can she sing but her total performance was a sheer delight. One wonders why she has never been engaged at the Met. A great sin of omission.<br /><br />The traditional staging and the production in general were undemanding but totally appropriate and I found the whole 119 minutes extremely well spent.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I have looked at every store and website this product was cheaper than the regular DVDs. This is a heck of a deal all three movies on blue-ray
B004ZGI2KK|4.0|I first saw this movie a couple of years ago and finally decided to add it to my collection.  If your not familiar with this film it's about a town that made a packed with a werewolf and for years things have been going as well as could be expected until the wolf changes the rules by killing &#34;Red's&#34; older sister.  I liked this film because it was different from most werewolf movies as the main female charcature &#34;Red&#34; was underplayed by Amanda Seyfried so the viewer wasn't just thinking don't go in the woods.  This is a combination love story, creature film, and whodonit, I think it would have done much better on it's original releas if it wasn't lost during the &#34;Twilight&#34; hype.  IMHO It is a much better film than any of the twilight films because it has a more adult theme, it's not filled with graphic gore and has an old school feel.
B0053TMP24|5.0|This is one of my favorite books of all time. It was wrote perfectly well and look forward to reading the next.
B002RI9UBS|4.0|LIFE OF PI:<br />  a perfect conundrum  (sorry, I don't review books, but you might find the review of the faithful film interesting).<br />  4.5/5<br />  Film director Ang Lee's<br />  adaptation of Yann Martel's<br />  extraordinary novel is,<br />  similarly, thematically<br />  challenging, but delivers the<br />  ride of a lifetime.<br />For those who've read the novel, which presents the reader with two versions of the main narrative, they may be well prepared to encounter the same ambiguity in Lee's faithful film, Life of Pi.<br />Some will express frustration at this open-ended conclusion.  However, the element of choice is integral to the source material, being, substantively, about truth and faith which, it is contended, are both essentially elusive and, ultimately, subjective.<br />Martel and Lee are on well-trodden ground.  Following, for example, Kurosawa's landmark film, Rashomon (1950), which explored a woman's rape/murder from the viewpoint of four different witnesses who failed to establish a consensus, it has been fine for a film to ask questions of an audience, rather than to provide answers.<br />Most people will be aware that the protagonist's name is the symbol for an unresolvable mathematical conundrum, making it an entirely apt appellation.  So, with the only major difference to the book, being the inclusion of an author, to whom the story may be related, we can now turn our attention to this extraordinary tale of survival.<br />After closing their zoo in India, the Patel family, accompanied by many of the animals, embark on a ship bound for Canada.  One night, in rough weather, the ship sinks and Pi finds himself in a lifeboat, the sole human survivor along with a few of the animals, the main one being a Bengal tiger,  humorously named Richard Parker.<br />The tale of Pi's battle against the elements, adrift for over two hundred days, is one of ingenuity, deprivation and virtual starvation.  However, above all, it centres on the extraordinary relationship which develops between Richard Parker who struggles for supremacy, and Pi who simply struggles to stay alive.  Eschewing several opportunities of ridding himself of his lethal companion, Pi insists on keeping the tiger aboard, a product of his own deep humanitarian and religious beliefs.  So develops an almost unbelievable symbiosis which goes far beyond the earthly, delving into philosophical and spiritual areas which question the essence of Humanity itself.<br />What Lee achieves, in having the human and animal protagonists at `close quarters' is nothing short of awe-inspiring. Not for a moment is there any doubt that Pi and the deadly Bengal tiger are together in the lifeboat.<br />In Hugo, Scorsese achieved a level of skill in the use of the 3D format, previously unseen.  Nowadays, it is almost de rigueur, that a prospective blockbuster be made in this format. Many such films, though, simply use 3D as a `shock tactic' which embroiders some cheap thrills into the action sequences.  Life of Pi takes this technology to a new level.  In fact, so intrinsic to the narrative force is this `extra dimension' that it would seem pointless to see it in a 2D format.<br />For the first time, I watched a film which seemed to occupy the entire space from my eyes to the screen.  Schools of fish swim before me, the night stars stretched to infinity and, when Pi's tiny refuge is struck with a tidal wave of flying fish, it is hard not to duck for cover or not to feel the sting of their impact. In the storm scenes, the sea, in all its savagery, has never looked so terrifying.<br />Lee has brought a degree of understanding and skill to the 3D format that will serve as the benchmark for years to come.<br />Above all, the main star of Life of Pi (and chief beneficiary of the marvels of 3D) is the natural world.  There are sights, so wondrous, so ravishing, that your emotions will endure an exhausting workout.  In fact, some scenes are not just achingly beautiful - they will, more than likely, be impossible to erase.<br />As far as human stars are concerned, Suraj Sharma, as Pi, is a revelation. It is almost unfathomable that this young actor, who has never been in front of the camera before, whose face often occupies half the screen, could display all the fear, hope, desperation and love that he does.  The scene where both he and Richard Parker are nearing death is heartbreaking.<br />Life of Pi is an outstanding achievement.  The visuals will hit you between the eyes but it is the deeper resonances, the meditation on Humanity's place in the Cosmos, which will probably stay with you forever.<br />Phil.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Liked all of the action in the book and all of the excitement<br />I think you should read the hunger games
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I am not a fan of books that glorify war.  Had I not heard an interview with the author on the Diane Rehm Show, I would never have considered reading this book. I am so glad that I did.  Took me less than 2 days to finish as I could not put it down. This book fascinated me as it was not glorifying war but instead focused on humanity and the prospect that we all can be better.
0316227706|5.0|Great book. Unbelievable pix (how DID they do that?).  I bought this as a gift for a dog-lover.  (She loves the book too.)
0984536159|4.0|I've said for years that I wanted to read this book, and I finally found it on Amazon at a great price so I purchased it. Hitler was a very interesting character, and in my opinion a lot of his struggles and triumphs throughout life go unnoticed. If you're a history buff, or just want a book for an interesting read I'd definitely recommend Mein Kampf.
B0098460O4|5.0|They are just SO GOOD! I have followed the news about them since I heard about the &#34;audition&#34; that went viral on you tube and looked at it. Jonathan, of course, as Simon Cowell said, is just &#34;unbelieveable&#34; - it will be really interesting to see where his talent takes him. We always knew Charlotte was good, too - it's just that she was outshone by Jonathan - who is a once-in-a-lifetime talent. On this CD, Charlotte really has a chance to show her range and talent. She is just luminous and she absolutely holds her own. I am looking forward to their next efforts - either separate or together - and I guess because I got the tape near the holidays, I would love to have a CD of Christmas music from them.
B0007Y08IS|4.0|This movie is hilarious! It's not something I'd watch over and over again, but I occasionally put it in and watch it and still get quite a few laughs!
1400069289|4.0|I found it very interesting and certainly useful. As I was reading it brought to mind a book I read something like 50 years ago and that was Vance Packard's &#34;Hidden Persuaders&#34;. It was very interesting realizing the tremendous evolution the &#34;persuaders&#34; have gone through in all these years.<br />At this point in time, being well over 70 years of age and almost retired, I was somehow disappointed by the book because I was expecting it to be more oriented to personal habits than to professional or corporate habits. Anyway I still would recommend it very highly, specially to whoever is changing jobs, running a corporation, revising strategies and so on. Your record should show the I have bought two books. The second one I gave it as a Xmas present to a client.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|First I want to start out by saying WOW. I have never read a book that had me hanging on the edge of my seat. Reading this book I felt like I was the main character. Sky and Holder wow. Holder sounds amazingly HOT and Sky was lucky to have someone like him in her life. This book had many twist and turns. I was excited, turned on, and wowed all in the same second. You will definitely be experiencing many emotions while reading Sky's story. Best story seriously ever. I was so sad when this book came to an end. I HIGHLY recommend reading this book and all books by this author. She is truly an amazing talent. DID I MENTION ITS STEAMY.
B00A8KJK7G|5.0|FRANKENWEENIE is a delightful film, Tim Burton's homage not only to FRANKENSTEIN but to other classic horror movies like GODZILLA and GREMLINS.<br />Filmed in stark black and white, Burton takes his original short film to a broader scope, engaging the viewer in the basic story of a boy and his dog.  There's lots of humor and tenderness in FRANKENWEENIE and the voice acting is perfect:  Charlie Tahan, Martin Landau, Catherine O'Hara, Martin Short and Winona Ryder.<br />Despite its grim premise, I think kids should find it harmless fun.  I heartily recommend FRANKENWEENIE.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I have been searching a while now for a book that made me go \\"woah\\" and then want to share it with all of my friends, and \\"Hopeless\\" by Colleen Hoover is finally that book! The ending of the story left me with goosebumps it was that riveting. Definitely buy this book!!
B004J4WKUQ|1.0|The critical reaction to this novel led me to expect something on the order of an update to Gibson's \\"Neuromancer,\\" but the story turned out to be far too shallow.  The unidimensional and hardly sympathetic protagonist, Wade, plays a massively multiplayer online game and solves a puzzle upon which the whole plot rests, progressing predictably from one game level to the next.  The art of suspense is completely lacking in this story.  Other characters help and hinder Wade, but really they all are cardboard cutouts.  The imagined online universe is not remarkable.  The total experience of reading this book is very much like watching mono-clever adolescent boys play XBox Live, and at about the same literary difficulty.  I had thought that perhaps I had missed the young adult designation for this book, but, no, this trite tale seems to be intended for the adult audience.  I also now consider reviewers who supported this book to be of diminished reliability.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I wasn't expecting anything amazing when I decided to download this, and I also hadn't played any of the other &quot;series&quot; games from Disney. As a disclaimer though, I am a fan of Phineas &amp; Ferb.<br /><br />Anyway, it is addictive, challenging, and way more &quot;scientific&quot; in logic than I would have guessed. Glad to see something reviewed with high rankings that I actually agree with!<br /><br />Lots of play time/levels, enough variation to avoid being boring at any given point, and filled with random bits of the oh-so-enjoyable humor we expect from the characters on the show.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B003QSMC18|3.0|Viewing the video online was a quality experience once I figured out what I was doing. However the storyline of the dvd was weak. I think some of the content may have been a little intimidating for small children. I rate it as mediocre at best.
B006MW3V6U|4.0|I like it. Has enough mystery wrapped around some key story lines to keep someone interested. And many women I know<br />talk about it a lot.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|This movie was entertaining and engaging.  It was very fun to watch. I bought it as a gift for my adult nephew.  He loves it.  This one is a winner for all ages.
B0049WHNLO|5.0|Duke Ellington, The Buck Clayton allstars and the Neuport Jazz Festival. It almost can't get any better than this. Really is a must have for a serious Jazz collector.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I enjoyed this book. Although for me personally the section on religion made me want to put it down, I didn't understand what is had to do with the story. Apart from that I really enjoyed it
B004S9AK3G|4.0|Up to Ken Follett's usual high standard and a brilliant follow-on from Pillars of the Earth.  The characters seem real and the reader can feel an emotional link to them.  can't wait for the 3rd book in the trilogy.
B0031RS2HC|5.0|Loved the book, can't wait to read the next one. Gripping and kept me on my toes the whole time.
034580404X|3.0|This is easy reading.  The story could have been told in 2 books instead of 3.  I'm in my 70's.  People younger may have enjoyed it more.
B0084BMUFA|4.0|Reading this was a lot easier than I thought it was going to be. It is a recommended read for sure, only about 100 pages. Don't be scared because it is authored by Charles Dickens.
B0027MJU00|5.0|All I can say is WOW!!!  Such a great book, one could not put it down. Up till the very end you are at the edges wondering who did what. I can't wait to read Flynn's other books!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Love it!!!  My kids & I enjoy this movie.  It's funny, sweet & creative.  Steve Carell is at his usual best!!!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I just love this game because my daughter loves it. she cannot stop going on it every single day when she gets a chance.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this book so much. There is great humor and very sad abuse.  I would recommend this book to anyone, it was a great read!
B000VNMMQG|5.0|I love this movie. I first saw this movie in high school and Fell in love with it from there. My favorite quote comes from this movie, &#34;We are too young to realize that certain things are impossible.&#34; I find this quote to be super encouraging and I find that it makes me a more confident person. The whole time you watching this movie you will be cheering on the main character and his group of individuals that he has assembled. I would recommend this movie to anyone. It is educational but entertaining at the same time. Please give this movie a chance, you will not be disappointed!
B004DK5CW4|3.0|I got this movie for my 9 year old son, because he loves horses. He did not even sit still while the movie was on. He got bored. It was ok for adults. Not interesting enough for young kids.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Excellent show with many subplots and interesting and unexpected twists.  Can appeal to a wide range of people.  Interesting historical setting.
1419705849|5.0|My 9 year old son got this book for Christmas. He takes it everywhere with him. He thinks it is so funny! He loves it as much as the other Wimpy Kid books.
B003SI9WYG|5.0|Can you remeber your frist time seeing this in the theatre? can you remeber the 1st copy you brought home?  If yhes to both any wonder why its so BIG!!  Tim Burton thank you for all you have made and done but thank you the most for this !
B00A8Z6KN8|5.0|This soundtrack picks up where the LOTR trilogy left off. It's like you never left, the music is just beautiful. You can put this soundtrack on in the background or when you go to sleep and it is great from start to finish. If you were a fan of the first 3 movies/soundtracks...I'd highly suggest picking this up, you won't be disappointed
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|I love this movie so much!! For Christmas, I got my staff all a copy of the movie. The only shipping issue was that the plastic piece that holds the dvd in broke on one DVD. That was the only issue.
B000E1MXSW|5.0|A must have for any true Audrey Hepburn Fan.<br />One of her finest performances. Even in the nuns habit,her true beauty shine throw.
B005SLS3ZU|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book and would recommend it to all those interested in this genre.  I wil be purchasing more o this authors books in the future.
B003AO1SVS|5.0|I bought this CD for my 24-year old daughter and we listened to it repeatedly over the holidays before she returned to school.  Although I am stuck in a bit of a rut listening to the 60s and early 70s, I enjoyed this music.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Just the right amount of story, mystery,hidden object and puzzles. Graphics are good too. A little to much back and forth that is.why only 4 stars, but well worth the money!
B000000WA4|5.0|I bought this CD to replace one that my daughter lost when it was playing in her car's CD player, the car was totaled and the CD could not be retrieved.  She's had this CD since early high school and we've always enjoyed it.  Hearing it again brought back some real memories.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|I bought this movie to show my class and they loved it! The movie follows  Dicken's story to a T and the music is great to sing along to. Defininitly a classic worth owning.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|If you haven't followed this series you should start at the first season and move forward .One of the best series ever,even my wife is hooked and she doesn't watch this kind of stuff normally.
B007NUP5OG|5.0|The record came in perfect shape and my brother, who is a huge Madonna fan like myself, loved it!:) I highly recommend this product!
B00AFROVQC|2.0|I'm not going going to be negative or disparaging reviews this is one of the poorest books I've ever read that had good potential. It follows the common theme which is great, has some interesting characters, but they're never fully developed in this story. the plot progressions are almost unbelievable in their simplicity and lack of depth. Good start if you were writing fiction for the 11 to 14-year-old crowd but a very very disappointing book for anyone older
B009K0P10K|4.0|This is a great evening soap. Never know what is going to happen next. Give it a watch and see.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|What an amazing way to end the series. My only sadness I  that it is over. An awesome book and and awesome series.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love the cast, the story line, the clothing and the grandeur of Downton Abbey!<br /><br />Clean TV at its BEST!
B002BU0DPE|5.0|They sound amazing. And I love the incredibly long cord, very convenient. The mic sounds great as well. They fit very nice and snug and don't move much. The only con is the volume control. But, those are always aggravating, so I don't think that was worth a star loss. Overall, recommended.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Great to have such a large variety of progressive games.  Am finally on Arcade No. 83.  My husband and I play together.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I was so happy when this app came out. Any others I had found were just spam or not quite right. I really enjoy this app as it make it easy to navigate pinterest!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The book fifty shades freed book three of fifty shades of grey by e l James is a fantastic book
B005ZUR724|5.0|Wanna play WoW on the go? Now you can get your fix anywhere.<br />I'm impressed they made such a large game for mobile.
B00328G4V6|2.0|The obvious consideration here is that there is no way of knowing what, if anything, Jimi Hendrix would have altered, built upon, etc. in regard to any of the music presented in this collection. In interviews done at the time VALLEYS was released, long-time Hendrix recording engineer Eddie Kramer went to great pains to say that this was not a \\"proper\\" Hendrix album he and Experience Hendrix (the estate overseeing the JH legacy) had assembled...it was meant to be seen as a slightly fine-tuned sketchbook of what Hendrix was contemplating in the two years between  his last official album, ELECTRIC LADYLAND, and his death in September 1970. How much of what is here would have seen a final release while he was alive is something we'll never know. Some of this material saw release on the three controversial Alan Douglas-produced albums, CRASH LANDING, MIDNIGHT LIGHTNING and VOODOO SOUP, where in many cases Douglas had replaced backing tracks and added additional guitar parts and backing vocals, to about equal numbers of cheers and jeers from listeners. Kramer and the Hendrix estate have mostly chosen to leave such tinkering alone, except for some re-recordings of bass and drum tracks by Noel Redding and Mitch Mitchell (the other members of the Jimi Hendrix Experience) that were done in the late Eighties. They've opted instead to do fresh mixes of the existing tracks, so what you really have here is as close to an unadulterated snapshot of non-bootleg Hendrix in the studio as we're likely to get these days.<br /><br />So is the collection any good? Yes and no. The re-recordings of \\"Stone Free\\" and \\"Fire\\" seem rather pro-forma, almost as if they were soundchecks Hendrix was doing prior to playing an evening gig. The title song is quite good, although it peters out towards the end (a lot of the material presented here does). \\"Lullaby for the Summer\\" and \\"Crying Blue Rain\\" sound like they started existence as extended jams and gradually developed and grew from there. I've heard better versions of \\"Red House\\" and the Albert Hall recording of the JHE tearing into Cream's \\"Sunshine Of Your Love\\" cuts the version here to shreds. For my money, the best track is a BONUS track available as a download: \\"Trash Man,\\" restored to its original form after it's made-over debut on the Douglas album MIDNIGHT LIGHTNING. On this one, Hendrix lets fly with the fretwork we all know him for and his leads really do soar upwards. This and the download of Hendrix' \\"Peace In Mississippi,\\" (also restored to its original form after Douglas mucked with it for CRASH LANDING) will give you Hendrix the guitarist in fine fettle beyond those first three Jimi Hendrix Experience albums, FIRST RAYS OF THE NEW RISING SUN and SOUTH SATURN DELTA.<br /><br />This has its moments, to be sure. I wish there were more of them, but, well, how could there be, given the circumstances?rd better versions of \\"Red House\\" and the Albert Hall recording of the JHE tearing into Cream's \\"Sunshine Of Your Love\\" cuts the version here to shreds.

B007L6VR12|5.0|despite the christmas rush, this product was sent to me on time and in great condition.  thanks for taking such great care. this was a present and they loved it! thanks again! would highly reccommend.
B009JBZH54|5.0|This was a great trio and made more sense then buying even just one at the price for the set.
B000003TBP|5.0|despite the christmas rush, this product was sent to me on time and in great condition.  thanks for taking such great care. i would reccomend this product and love the cd.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was so awesome, and there was never a dull moment. Good from the start kept me captivated the whole time
B0016CRZJA|5.0|thanks. i love the digital options now available through amazon.  thanks for making these so accessable along with the other music that I have previously saved to my devices.  i am looking forward to adding the advanced import music option and getting all of my music on the cloud.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|I wish I had seen this on the big screen - Christian Bale is in top form for this movie and the conspicuous nature of the plot happening to coincide with the Occupy Wall Street is intriguing.  No wonder the Corporate Controlled Media did everything they could to shut OWS down and ignore and promote violent provocateurs, bribe the NYPD with $million &#34;donations&#34; from the Banksters .... the .001% should pay attention to this movie.  Thank you Mr. Nolan, Bravo!  Every moment is an opportunity to choose between Love or Not Love.
B00AMSLRAC|4.0|Good little program but it does not have as much as some of the other Dr Panda programs we have purchased
0792844890|5.0|Look, if you're a Mel Brooks fan, this is a must have.  It's hilarious, and good for a fun family movie.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|As soon as I started reading I was hooked. This is the type of romance and passion a woman dreams of captured into a book. I highly recommend this book. It is  a must read!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I could not get enough of this book! I cannot wait until the second book. This is a must read.
B005LAIH4A|1.0|I was very disappointed in this movie....it turned out to be a polemic of being very anti-big business and pro-environmentalism....typical liberal propaganda at its best. We need cotton to make our clothes. We grow the cotton, pick it and turn it into clothes, and then the Cotton grows back and the process starts all over again, but not in this world apparently. The trees once they're processed die off for whatever reason. Again, typical liberal propaganda. Aside from the 3d modeling, I have nothing to recommend for this movie. Im just sorry for all the schoolchildren who are no doubt going to grow up brainwashed with this piece of tripe. They should however, made the grinch using 3d computer modeling as well as the Cat in the Hat, instead of having actors embarrass themselves in rediculous costumes.
B004OC07GM|5.0|A fast read and very interesting book! Christensen's way of explaining and reasoning is to-the-point and the contents of the book can readily be applied to business analyses. Should be a part of any strategy or marketing curriculum.
B003QP4NPE|3.0|Would love to read this on Kindle, but just cannot abide by the price!  Why is it that that I can buy it in hardback, cheaper than digital delivery?  That is just not right, and feels like gouging.  No Thanks, I'll read someone else.
B005UDD1R6|2.0|Would not work on my device. It would not play my needed video. I removed it after 3 attempts to make it work
B00A0SJWQU|4.0|Great movie! It stick pretty close to the first ones, but has some great special effects added. Everyone did a great job in it! I'll probably watch this one again!
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|I love the hungry shark games and its super cool to find a version that is free and full. You have to pay for content and that kinda sucks but the graphics and challenge you get kinda out weigh that.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I saw the movie on theater and was good, but see it at home on my own theater system is better. The sound is spectacular. The Ultraviolet thing is a pain in the ***, but that doesn't matter when you have BD and DVD package.
1451695195|4.0|I saw Dr. Alexander on Fox News before I bought this book...while I know there is a Heaven (and hope to go there) it is a happy thing to know someone has previewed it and validated it for others....
B008O69SZ0|5.0|Ian Hunter is one of the best song writers of our time. Another stong performance writing and musically, Like all true &#34;Ian&#34; fans we will always miss Mick Ronson and on this new album Andy York, but it rocks when it needs to and soft ballads to even things out. I've seen every tour since 1978 and at the age of 72 he's still able to rock with the best of them.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|The description in the store describes the application perfectly. It does exactly what it's supposed to do, and works great. Thank you for the amazing free application.
B00005N6KG|5.0|LOVE these headphones.  I use them for running. They are super light, fit so well around my head and do not move at all.  5 stars for sure.  Well worth the price.  Works great with my iPod!!!!!
B004UJAOLM|5.0|This may be my most favorite book ever!!!!! At first it was confusing but once I got through the beginning it was very intense
B005M0X078|4.0|Almost, but  not quite as fun as seeing the show from the fifth row center seats. I have seen the musical a total of 3 times now.
B0038AL7EW|5.0|A very touching film about a very heart wrenching end of life story,and the respect and tenderness with which it is portrayed.
B008M87GJK|5.0|I don' t why, but the BBC news seems to be unbiased when they report the news. And I MEAN the straight news.
B004CFAWK2|5.0|This was a very well written, fun, heart-touching story. The characters were so easy to connect with, and despite the nonlinear plot, it was very easy to follow. I was sucked in from start to finish. No complaints, this was a great read.
B004QOB8SY|5.0|Season 2 of this amazing series is just as good (if not better in some places) as the frist. The actors are amazing, the reworkings of these classic storys are spot on and the humor used breaks the tension is just the right ways. I would highly reccomend this for any fan of Sherlock Holmes or of mystery tales in general.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|The graphics. Are very good and I have enjoyed the game very much.I will most likely buy more games.<br />The little monkey is very helpful when you are not able to reach things.
B004132I20|5.0|Bringing Sherlock Holmes into the modern centruy may seem like a perpostrous idea. With the new technology how could Holmes possibly survie the transition? Easy, by using it. This merging of the classic detecitve with the modern day era of places and technology is astounding.  Cumberbatch and Martin are fantaisc in the lead roles and play off each other well. The mystery and the humor are perfectly blended together to make for some exciting viewing.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Read both one and two consecutively and definitely worth the time. The unpredictable happens often enough to keep you engaged.
6305212112|4.0|had a few scraches, but it played good.. i've watched this move for years and wanted a copy on DVD..
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wow. I literally could not put this book down. This book will make you laugh, cry and everything in between. This is such a passionate story of love, friendship and the unfortunate sad  reality that some experience in life. This is a must read!
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|Well I had to rent the movie on Verizon Fios because Amazon prime was stopping every 4 seconds. Its not my connection. The movies play great at off peak hours, but at night it is terrible. the movie was great....on Verizon
B004W2UBYW|4.0|By reading this book I learned about balance, leadership and execution.  Not only a great biography but also a fantastic business book.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Tale of a sociopath. Typical lies and maneuvers with disappointing ending. Expected more after all the good reviews. Overly long.
B0039YZPZ4|3.0|I love Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law, but I expected a little more from the movie. The action was great and it was refreshing to see these literary characters in a new light. But of all the potential scripts to choose from to debut the characters after all this time, why such a dark plot revolving around black magic? And it all was explained so quickly at the end. Just a little disappointed.
0765325950|5.0|I have been waiting for this for years and am not disappointed! Full of action and excitement, years of reading all the characters stories are coming together in an amazing finale!
B007L6VR12|5.0|This movie DVD purchase was a gift for my sister-in-law. I'm told she loves the movie, so I am giving it 5 stars!
0765325950|5.0|I neither own the book nor have I read it yet but apparently that's not a requirement for rating this. 5 stars!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This is an amazing book - yes a little of the Robinson Crusoe - but .... better in almost every way.  Imagine being marooned on Mars with only your wits and modest resources at hand to shape your destiny and survival.  This was a book I could not put down.  A little Reminiscent of &#34;Red Mars&#34; - the movie - but again, so beautifully crafted and introspective.  Some pretty good science in it too.  This is a must read/addition to a SF library.  Sweeping adventure.
B00AMBM9MO|2.0|some funny lines...but not worth the money. It just seemed to drag on & on & on. Not for kids ears.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It took my granddaughter to convince me that this was a good book and I would enjoy reading it.  As usual, she was correct.  Well-written, action packed and I don't care if it considered a young adult read...I'm a young 68 and I loved it.
B005QUQ99K|4.0|I purchased this as a Christmas gift at the request of my nephew. It was a great addition to his huge Legos collection.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I really appreciate being able to wake up gradually to music that I want to hear. I also like the large snooze button because you don't accidentally dismiss the alarm before you want to.
B007SWZVBQ|5.0|My 21-year old daughter chose this as a Christmas gift for me to get for her.  She loves Glee and so do many of her college friends!
B004LROUNG|5.0|Humorous, easy to read ( in a good sense) and entertaining. laughed a lot and enjoyed thoroughfuly, most plesant pastime
B00A3ATW4M|5.0|Gift for my 21-year old daughter.  Loves Glee.  Will enjoy this very much at college while watching with other Glee fans!
B00AKKGX4W|4.0|Nice, and somewhat different from the run-of-the-mill Regency romance. I enjoyed both the plot and the characters--it was very well-written.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|This is one of my Favorite Love movies and the perfect movie for the happily married couple. 5 star movie
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|When I began reading this novel, I thought, \\"ugh, not another teen angst romance\\".  I thought of all the cliche' s and same old, same old....girl meets bad boy who changes for her, etc.  But, I gave it a few pages and I am so glad I did!  This book really has you drawn in and the twists and turns keep you turning the pages.  I won't give anything away, but this book is well written and entertaining. I highly recommend this book!
B0083SBMBM|5.0|You know how off bananas look all black and grody and you get that off put sad face when you find out your nanners went south? Then you turn them into banana bread and you're munching on it and you're like &#34;whaaaat? This is awesome!!&#34; Well this movie is like that but with boredom instead of bad nanners. Unless you don't like bananas. Then well just watch the darn movie.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|One of Kings best lately. Story keeps moving making it a pare turner. If your as Stephen King fan, you'll love it. Not the typical horror story but a good one none the less
B009WO7NQO|4.0|Great meshing of my favorite movie saga and Angry Birds I play it everyday hoping to crush the piggies into pieces of bacon!
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Great game.  Addictive! I downloaded it for myself.  But rarely get to play it because my roommate is always playing it.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|It is very fun to purchase new gadgets and jetpacks.  I like to see my person face plant.  It's also fun to see the highlight of the game picture.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I love the unexpected and that's exactly what I got with this story, but I'm not going to give anything away and spoil the fun for others.
B0054SMID0|5.0|A great cast and well-written script make this movie excellent. I would happily watch it again even though I now know what happens because it was that good. It made me laugh at several points as well. A+
B003XRELGQ|4.0|Easy to read short story reviewing religion and society.  A lot of things to consider through easily digestible format.  I enjoyed it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great period piece, with wonderful storyline.  Awesome cinematography, just breath taking with Can't wait to see Season Three. PBS has done it again.
B009SJ3GUK|2.0|I really wish the directors would of kept up with the characters and theme of the first house. I was kind of disappointed with season 2 but I'm a sucker for horror and overall the show is entertaining to watch.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Amazing book. Easy to read and great starter for a series. Glad I bought it and about to buy the second book....
B003E8P9G0|5.0|It was the best book I've ever read in my whole life so far I want more of the series
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I am glad that this series of books did such a good job of capturing the human spirit. Not many of us remember what real war was like, or how people dealt with it. The characters seemed real because they weren't perfect. They acted as humans.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|I recommend it with the movie collection of all avengers!. This is the better cinematographic adaptation of this hero! Congrats!
0385341075|5.0|Although some of my friends were not as enthusiastic as I was, I thought this was one of the best books I have read for ages.
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|This game is very fun and challenging. I like how there are different paths you can take and very fun achievements to unlock. The only problem i have is that if i am playing and then get a call in the middle of my game, the screen screws up and i have to force close it to get it back to normal. Other than that, great game.
B008469DGY|4.0|AND NEW TWIST on golf. It takes some getting used to but it is a lot of fun. The graphics are spectacular and very realistic.
B007EECSFA|4.0|Kate Morton has a way of intertwining the past and the future seamlessly.  I enjoy the way she brings her characters alive, she understands the human emotions.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|A must have!! So easy and lots of features!! Has nice big numbers which is great at the store when I forget my glasses at home!
0060254920|5.0|After recieving the movie as a gift to my son I purchased this book. He repeatedly points to the monsters and growls, &#34;wid tang&#34;. I love reading this with him.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I was surprised to read such an inspiring book by a Doctor! They don't usually believe in an after life. I would recommend everyone who believes in God and Heaven to read this book
0920668372|5.0|I read (actually sang) this book to my children when they were little and it was always their favorite!  Now that the grandbabies are coming, I bought it for them.  Such a great story line of unconditional love throughout the lives of our children growing up and in the later years the children loving the parents.<br /><br />A must read for all children!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I first read this book in 10th grade and it changed my life. Now at 25 I am transported back to that time and all of those emotions I felt at 16.<br />Chbosky does a wonderful job of keeping you enthralled by Charlie. I can't wait to read it again when I'm a thirty something and rekindle all of those feelings again.<br /><br />Love this book.
B009NPKTN6|4.0|Really enjoyed it right from the beginning. It was funny, the music was good, enjoyed hearing the old 80's rock in that format.
B006O6F932|4.0|Grandson was thrilled with the monster high school playset.  Has played with it quite often and loves all the different dolls that you can purchase.
B002P79KAC|5.0|I like this shrrow very much its a classic and very funny comedey.  I missed the first seasons and now I can catch up
B005KGPVR6|5.0|The item showed up nice and fast as well as the price was good, In the end it turned out to be 5 movies, one of the disks has 2 movies on it, bonus, thanks.
B000IYU9HW|5.0|I had seen this movie in the early 1970s and was so glad to rent it via Kindle Fire since I was in my teens then and now I am 56 years old and loved the way I was able to appreciate it and it really is a Love Story.  A must see for anyone who hasn't and after 40 years the movie still is so real and heartbreaking and loving.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I was iffy at the beginning of this book but as I got further I fell more and more in love with it! Such reality of a teenager I loved it so so much and cannot wait until I go see th  movie!!
B009HEJXFS|3.0|I can honestly say that my favorite was MIB 1.  This one was a little bit of the same but not as moving.
0765325950|5.0|The story is fantastic.<br /><br />Sanderson's three Wheel of Time books are far better than the previous 3 or 4 written by Robert Jordan.  I've loved this series for 17 years and am pleased with how it turned out.<br /><br />Ignore the one star reviews.  They are trying to make a point with the publisher over ebooks.<br /><br />I love ebooks too.  I've been reading them since 2002 on a Palm m500 in .pdb format.  Review the book, not the decision of the late author's wife.
B001NKI60W|3.0|I was thinking it would be better but i still enjoyed it.  Meryl is fantastic.  I love the way the ABBA songs were used.  But my best ABBA movie is still MURIEL'S WEDDING.
B003U6BE8I|5.0|Great movie for all ages. Action and heart as well as great information about Greek mythology. We had fun watching it and will watch many times.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I like this game and am on it a lot but I don't think that the graphics are good. I don't like how it is pixels and the stuff is blurry(: Other wise it is ok(:
B008YWY0HK|4.0|We bought this for our daughter who loves the film. It is probably for 7-8 years or older due to some of the violence, scary attacking bears and witch/sorcery. However, it is a very cute film with an excellent morale.
B003XF1OJK|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I have been a long time fan of the franchise and sci-fi in general, but I have never tried reading a book like this before.  It was very entertaining and fleshed out some history of the master chief and his fellow Spartans.  This helped fill the suit with a person instead of the MC just being a driven war machine.  Recommend it highly to anyone that is a fan of the game, or just a fan of fun sci-fi in general.
B009157BWU|5.0|This movie captured an amzing event and its resolution. I would recommend this to anyone. I watched this movie with my 6th grade class.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was amazing!! It was intellectually stimulating and the storyline was captivating. I'm a nurse so it was nice to understand the references and to get a glimpse of the life of teenage cancer patients. Illness does not define you as a person so it's admirable when people struggle with sickness and can find humor in it, that's living! I highly suggest reading this book...it struck a variety of emotions for me and it will resonate with you as well=)
B008MEM24S|4.0|cool game I like this better then weres my water but cooler, it has gadgets and other cool stuff.  so fun
B00ADS98FC|3.0|The movie itself is great...5 stars.  But being an apple user, I definitely should have gone with iTunes.  In order to watch this on an iPad, you've got to rely on an excellent wifi connection in order to stream, or wait hours for it to download to your device.  For AppleTV users, don't hold your breath because Amazon Instant Video does not support AirPlay.  This of course means even once you've gone through the trouble of purchasing and streaming (or downloading) the movie, you cannot &#34;push&#34; it to your TV.  So now you're limited to watching it on your ipad...sitting at your huge expensive TV watching your nice new movie on...an iPad.<br /><br />But again, the movie itself...GREAT! Fat Amy is the best.  You will laugh and sing the whole way through.
B00008YJHC|5.0|Plays well, good group, good is the word here.  Look at the title, what more can I say. Good, good.
B0067R0APK|5.0|Gives me a quick review of current weather points for several days at a quick glance! Love it! I can always follow up with specifics if needed.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Satisfying ending to the series.  I would love a prequel that would explain the history of the world.  I can't wait for the next movie.
159420411X|5.0|Nate Silver does a great job bringing the world of forecasting alive, making what would be arcane information for most be relevant and interesting. A few sections dragged, but overall was interesting and engaging. Thanks Nate!
B008X9Z37A|5.0|Nice and durable. It is easy to put my kindle in and out of it. I can even use the case as a stand.
B000SGRONM|2.0|I bought this for the Santaland Diaries, which I'd heard was very funny. It turned out to not be much of anything. I don't know, I guess I expected the shenanigans to be more interesting than &#34;Look through this window and you can see Cher!&#34;  I read a couple of the other stories too, but they likewise failed to hold my interest, so I gave up before finishing.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I couldn't put it down. It is an intense book about real life pain, sorrow and happiness and a real, intense love. Definitely worth reading.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|This entire album is worth listening to! I don't have a more or less favorite song, every song is good.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was truly awe inspiring. It was incredibly well written and emotionally trying. I'd recommend this book to anyone.
0765325950|1.0|Have publishers not paid attention to the number of e-readers sold over the last 3 years? Not releasing the eBook version was a major mistake!
B00992CF6W|5.0|if you are interested in mining,building and fighting and killing mobs while still having the chance to die and lose what's on you unless you retrieve your inventory  from the spot you have died at before.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|This is a really fun game.  The only downside is it only has 4 heads of hair to style.  Also, I find it near impossible to do an up-do on the head.  It is fun to watch the avitar's facial expressions.  They are entertaining.  There isn't any kids avitarts, just 2 women & 2 men.  The game has a place where you can add accessories to the hair.  My 11 y/o gr daughter loves it too.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I am an almost 40 year old woman who is disabled and totally in love with team lava games. I play on my kindle fire. I have no problems with any of the games. yes you can use real cash but there are very easy ways of preventing that to happen. my storm id is nysara. thanks for awesome games and keep up the good work!
B000092T6M|5.0|We received this DVD in a timely manner and at a good price.  It works good.  We have enjoyed watching this movie on our clearplay player.

B00004U8JV|5.0|I have enjoyed this DVD.  It was received in a timely manner and it works well on our clearplay player.  It was purchased at a very good price too.
B001EYU1VO|5.0|Love this product, very easy to use and it is well made and seems far sturdier than other models I've owned.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I was having a great time making clever drawings and wishing I could save them. Then I learned the iphone/ipad app has a save button. Come on android/kindle fire developers. Update our app with save.
B007SGLZP8|1.0|Lazy writing by Grisham. What a shame. I was expecting something different but the ending didn't disappoint. Average to below average writing from a master.
B008AK8FHM|1.0|The book did not hold my interest ,I have read many books on this subject and could not  get into this book.<br /><br />  L R Lutes  ( Illinois)
0061780308|5.0|Being both a race fan and a dog lover, this book was a perfect fit for me. I was delighted to see it in audio format so that I could share this wonderful story with my blind mother in law. Evokes true, deep emotion.
0060775858|5.0|This is a wonderful children's book, a classic that endures.  Great for a bedtime routine for your youngest or even beginner readers.
B002361MLA|5.0|this is a book that will help you to understand that there is only the present, the NOW.  Live well!
B0091VTISO|2.0|This is a very bad movie in almost every aspect, not worth watching it. The original movie was much better.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I'm strictly rating this on bang for the buck.  It was a $25 Gold Box Deal of the Day, then dropped down to $20 later on!  I actually thought they would sell out.  It includes Alien 1,2,3 and Resurrection.  Plus 2 bonus discs on the making of the movies.  All in a quite excellent little book set of high quality.  This DOES NOT include Alien vs. Predator, which I did like quite a bit.  What a deal!
B0043KK4N6|5.0|Great movie! I can't believe why it din't do better in the theaters. Cher and Christina were awesome. Highly recommend this movie!
0765325950|1.0|As a lifelong wheel of time fan I'm sure this book wil be amazing...  BUT no eBook is massively short sighted and disrespectful move to the fans that have stuck with this series, re-purchased it on multiple formats (ironically including eBook) and helped expand the readership through word of mouth etc.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|The Hubs loves Star Wars.  He also loves Angry Birds.  He seriously could not wait to get his hands on this.
B009X01GJ2|5.0|Ordered this as a replacement for the Belkin Dot Cover and was pleasantly surprised. It holds the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 very securely, but will rotate easily between portrait and landscape views while also allowing the cover to close with charging cable is in use.  I prefer to use a stylus and mine clips nicely to the cover. I also like the elastic strap that can secure the cover in the closed position when I throw it in my bag, a great feature since the Kindle awakes when the cover is opened and closed. I would love to have a wider color selection.
B003YCIE68|5.0|My family really enjoys this movie and we watch it as a family every christmas eve. Very pleased to finally own the dvd
B003Y5H5AG|5.0|Great entertainment, especially for children.<br />I would recommend this movie to anyone who has children or who can simply appreciate &#34;bue humor.&#34;
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Oh yeah! that funny.  Boy and Girl are laugher and funny.<br />that good.<br />very good movie art, wow! thank you
B00000IQW5|5.0|I love this movie.  It is entertaining and makes you stop to value the love in your life.<br />I received the moving quickly and in excellent condition<br /><br />I recomment this movie to anyone who likes a good love story as well as to anyone who has lost a loved one and feels the need to move on with their life.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The Racketeer I found the book interesting and a fast read. I have read meny of John Grishams book and this one is one of the best.
B006LR0XLM|5.0|I no longer have to carry a thumb drive with me between home and work ... wonderful! I simply save my file in the drop box, and after it is installed on my home computer, work computer and tablet, I have the same document no matter where I am ... the most UPDATED document. I have also just discovered the &#34;share folder&#34; which is so convenient! I am on a committee where multiple people need to contribute to a spreadsheet. One person sets up the shared folder and sends an invite ... as soon as the other people have a free drop box account, they can view the shared folder from the e-mail invitation and contribute! Everyone always has the most updated version.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love the world that Suzanne Collins has created, but I suppose we all should since it is just a slightly more extreme version of the reality we live in.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I use this for my daily devotional, for which it sends me a reminder at the time I designate. Also, I have a widget on my phone showing me a new Bible verse every day. Wonderful!
B008FRFN7A|5.0|Finally can print from my Kindle....can print my PDF that I download,  or documents from Dropbox that I access from nh Kindle. Its all good. Now just need to prevent the printer from having an issue and its all good. No need to turn the desktop on.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|A little slow at first but the last few chapters are amazing and totally worth the investment. Can't wait to see the movie.
B0078XFYDA|2.0|I wasted my money on this book.  I would not recommend this book.  Some worthwhile facts but mostly a denial of God.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|One of the best Tom Clancy books yet !  I cant believe how fast it read. Threat Vector will go down as one of his best
0765325950|1.0|Harriet claims it is to protect the legacy, but all I can see it as is hurting his legacy.  This will be something the legacy will be remembered for.  In a world where publishers are seeing huge value in e-books, this is one of the dumbest mistakes I've seen, and is dinosauric.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|This was my recommendation for our bookclub when it first came out. We all loved it - you can never predict how it will end and a book where no one really liked any of the characters!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is a great game. I wish this wasn't so difficult.<br />Really this is hard to set up the kindle fire.
B005KELW26|2.0|I actually do like it and love the color, but it is too tight a fit for my fire so I can't use it.  What's up with that?
B000VT6FAO|5.0|Dave Gahan is one of my idols and I was pretty excited when this arrived, best cd for my collection =]
B004IAIXWK|5.0|love any movie with this man!  i watched this on my kindle fire hd 8.9 and the pic was better than on my hd tv.
B00008EY7H|4.0|I've always wanted to see Cirque live but have not done so-----now I definitely want to see a show.  It's on my bucket list!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Once you start reading it is impossible to put down. Love the triology! Buy all the books together, because once you read once you will want to start the next one.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|I can't think of a better mystery book to give 5 stars to! The richness of the details helps the reader bond with characters, items in the story, and especially the place. The story line is a little slow, but that's the price you pay for stopping to smell the roses, and you really don't mind being asked to look away from the main story for a little bit because Craig Johnson makes it worthwhile with great detail, explanations, and a little humor. If you like mystery, some suspense and action revolving around a modern day western background, here's the book for you!
B0052REUW0|5.0|Steven Pinker writes about the Important topic of violence in human society.  His book is well documented, well written, and offers concrete hope for our species.  If you care about humanity's future, this is a book to read.
B000FC10MU|4.0|Good book, but sometimes a bit hard to follow. I was recommended it by a friend and it was worth it.
0765325950|1.0|I'm sure the book is great but no Kindle format on release date?  Come on... Seriously?! I'll wait and purchase it when it comes out.  One star for lack of availability.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Great show!  Can't wait for season two to be released!  The acting is impeccable and the story line keeps you guessing.
0385523912|5.0|I read this book on my spare time and I am so grateful I did. What an incredible read. I suggest it to anyone who is curious what lies beyond our little corner of the world.
0399160450|5.0|As always a great book.  Deals with possible future troubles that may happen in the world. Good plots keeping you guessing through the whole book.  Can not wait until the next book.
0810994739|5.0|Great books!  Both of my kids have read all of these.  Books are better than the movies (and the movies are very good).
B00008OE4W|5.0|Great Characters. Plot is full of surprises. Every computer geek should catch this one.  We have watched it several times.
0810970686|5.0|My kids love the whole diary series.  The books are way better than the movies.  I ready the first book myself.

B00A9C3RB8|2.0|I thought it was a depressing view of marriage!  Acting was good but the story not so good.  No wonder so many marriages end in divorce if this is what life ends up being like!
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|This product was easy to assemble and the directions were easy to follow.  The first couple of bottles I cut did not come out perfectly, but they came out pretty well, and I think the cuts will get better with more use.
B00006EXDM|5.0|What can I say; this is a great album!! Apparently I need to say more, as there is a minimum word limiter on this site.
1442346949|3.0|Enjoyed what I've read so far, but haven't finished it.  Steve Jobs was a marketing genius with a big ego.
B009B4ZEKM|5.0|She is one of my favorite singers and I love the new cd.  It stays in my cd player in the car.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I play this game about once a day or so for a few minutes and then put it away. Without paying you won't be able to get many coins so you won't have many other options than this, but it's still fun and plenty of coin dozing for your needs. Any more would probably make the game lose its appeal. I like to try and get all the pieces and just to level up. It's a fun five to ten minute time killer a day.
B00A757EFW|2.0|I really didn't like it.  I have already deleted from my kindle.  I just thought it was going to be a good game, but it wasn't.
B00005OOQ5|5.0|THIS DVD  WAS  REAL  GOOD  BUT  ITS  NOT  THE  ONE  I'M  LOOKING  FOR  STILL  LOOKING  TO  FIND  THE  CIRQUE DU SOLEIL DVD  THAT  I  SAW  YEARS  AGO  IT  HAS  A  SCEEN  WHERE  THERE'S  TWO  WEIGHT LIFTERS  DOING  GYMNASTICS  AND  OTHER  ACTS  CAN'T  REMEMBER  WHICH  DVD  IT  WAS .

B009X01C64|4.0|The case is adequate, but could be more sturdy, especially when used as a standing case. However, this case was purchased as a gift, which was sufficient for its purpose. Overall, it's a nice case.

B000OZ0NXA|4.0|A great read! I can't wait to start book 2. Neat plot twists, very cool story. Four stars only cause it's a first in a series and character development isn't quite there yet.
B006Z00M9I|5.0|I had an absolute perfect experience all around. great product, not as good as the first two but nice to see where it all began!!! THANK YOU VERY MUCH!
1938469011|5.0|Stan Hieronymus has done his homework.  He has distilled volumes of information down into this one book.  While it would have been good to take the trips and visit where he went in this book, it would not have been fun to pour over the massive amount of information that he gathered in order to write this book.  This book reads like a text book and is excellent for pro as well as avid amateur brewers.
B001CTGQBK|5.0|I had an absolute perfect experience all around. great product, brings back a lot of memories!! THANK YOU VERY MUCH!
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Have just started this book.  So far, it is very interesting, although it's a bit abstruse (that's a word I found in the book).  Am looking forward to finishing it.  Would recommend it to anyone who is interested in reading a literary classic.  I give it only 4 stars because I have not yet finished it.

B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Other ones were better but this one was darn good. I felt it was a little slow and could have had more fun action parts or introduced new robotic weapons or cars or something.

B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I loved this book!  Got it for book club and couldn't put it down.  Suspenseful, fanciful, fun!  You'll love it.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I've never read anything else like this! The story is very different and very creative. I loved all if the old photographs and thought is was a great touch. If you're looking to read something different, exciting, creative, brilliant AND see images as you read this book is perfect!<br />I'm not sure how I feel about the ending.....I wanted more. I think the end is left wide open for a second book.
B004XWMXW4|5.0|I first heard 2 Cello at a friend's home.  Ordered the CD immediately.  The entire disc is a discovery of contemporary and classical music - and makes current pop sound tawdry and tarnished.  I like genuine and authentic and these two fellas are the best out there.  Fast shipping. A++
B000PC0U1W|5.0|Very entertaining and thought provoking movie.  Not the typical predictable outcomes, which adds to the intrigue. The quality of the blu ray is excellent.
B004QX07G4|5.0|I am not surprise by liking this book. It is ELLEN after all, she if funny doing stand up, and she is funny when she writes. Enough SAID!!!!!
B007OLYQ4E|4.0|If you've never read Truman Capote, this is the place to start.  The included short stories are quite wonderful too.

0765325950|5.0|I have been reading this series for the last 13 years or so and it has been a pleasure. A Memory of Light was a fantastic ending to an epic series. I was kind of annoyed that is wasn't available in e-book format and I might have subtracted one point for that lack but it seems that enough people have given only one point just for that.  I think that people who have not read the novel should not review this book just because they are upset to have to read the book in hardcover.
B009H442DG|4.0|Really fun to hear these 2 icons back together again!! Always enjoyed Travolta's voice! Proceeds go to charity also!!! Win / Win
159102594X|3.0|I rarely write reviews, but sometimes I feel compelled to share my honest opinion for some like-minded people.<br /><br />Wikipedia state that \\"The Blade Itself was released to very positive reviews\\" while it's sequel \\"Reviews for Before They Are Hanged were more mixed\\". I find these statements to be backwards.<br /><br />I must admit I barely enjoyed The Blade Itself.<br /><br />I was easily well past halfway through a pretty long book before I started becoming interested.<br /><br />Simply put, this novel is 100% setup. Almost nothing happens.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, the characters are fantastic, and the character development is really well done; but that is what the entire book is.<br /><br />I don't think I'm off base in saying, you could give somebody a 5-10 sentence summary of The Blade Itself, and then have them pick up Before They Are Hanged without any issue whatsoever.<br /><br />Without spoiling Before They Are Hanged, I'm just over halfway through and I find it WAYYYY better than The Blade Itself. There is actually some interesting plot lines, rather than straight character development, with no action whatsoever.
B004SIP6WW|5.0|Sly Stallone plays meek in this film and shows this many acting talents, but as always shows good guys do finish first!!! A great movie!!!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|It was a great love story with an eye-opening look into life of an abuse victim.  Had me alternating between tears and smiles.  And the ending had an interesting twist.
B008XG1X18|4.0|arrived on time.  packaged well.  works well.  i am very satisfied.  i would recommend this  purchase to my friends ...
B0015DYIH2|5.0|This is really the only book that was different than the movie! I guess it's up to you which is better. Reading all the books helped me understand a lot of issues that I had about the movies. I'm so glad that I went to see the movies before reading the books, because it is usually the other way around. Seeing the movies and reading the books are well worth it! Hope that maybe a new series of books will continue soon!
B004GJDQT8|4.0|arrived on time.  packaged well.  works well.  i am very satisfied.  i would recommend this  purchase to my friends ...
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is the first book I ever read by John Green and I was a little skeptical about it but once I opened the book and started to read I was completely captivated by this book ! His writing style flows nicely and it keeps you intrigued without getting bored to where you feel like skipping chapters . The book was phenomenal and I recommend that everyone takes a chance and reads it.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I thought the book was interesting.  I had not previously read either Stephen King or any &#34;alternative history&#34; stories.  My daugther had not yet read the book, but suggested I at least try it and I could always quit if I did not like it.  I found myself caring about several of the characters and wondering how the story would end.  I did think the book was too long--the middle dragged a little for me. I don't want to include any spoilers about the ending, but I found it satisfying.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Great time piece series.  The drama is gripping, well done and it is a PBS production!  Downton is sure to capture anyone who remotely likes Austen, Dickens or Bronte
0446585041|4.0|Seriously...I'm Kidding is Ellen's newest book. Some chapters are autobiographical but most are Ellen's trademark random, sometimes absurd humor and observations on life. There were a few laugh out loud moments but it was mostly amusing, not hilarious. I think that it would be a lot funnier I were listening to Ellen herself read this book out loud. Her delivery is half of what makes what she says so funny.<br /><br />This was a relatively short book and a really fast read because some chapters were just a paragraph or a list of things. I kind of felt like these short chapters were filler; the longer chapters were definitely the funnier ones. Ellen fans (so most everybody - who's not a fan of Ellen??) will like this book but you might check it out on audio, it's probably better in that format.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|This series by Aaron Sorkin is so well done.  The characters are all developed, the dialogue witty (true to Sorkin form) and the issues are real.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|\\"Pines\\", by Blake Crouch, is a wonderful little genre-buster of a novel.  Not having read anything by Crouch before (except for \\"Draculas\\" a team-written (including F.Paul Wilson and Jack Kiborn among others) vampire gorefest that is wonderful), I wasn't sure what to expect, but at $3.99 for the Kindle download, I  didn't have much to lose.  Pines is roughly 2 parts Rod Serling Twilight Zone, 2 parts Harlan Ellison Outer Limits with a dash of Lost and Twin Peaks thrown in for seasoning.<br /><br />It's a very quick read, well-writtten, and had me guessing (incorrectly) until very near the end.  The very familiar set-up has Federal Agent, Ethan Burke, regaining consciousness in a small, isolated Idaho town, Whispering Pines, with no money, credit cards, or ID, or any idea what happened to him, other than he'd been rather badly beaten.  He'd been sent there to search for a couple of missing agents and... something had happened to him.  After rather quickly regaining his bearings, he meets some townspeople, talks his way into a hotel room and a hot meal and we're on our way.  Whispering Pines turns out to harbor a lot of secrets and some strange folk, as well as a few nice ones, and a rather oddly sinister sheriff.  Things just keep getting stranger and stranger, as Ethan tries to figure out what has happened to him and what or who is responsible for all the weirdness that seems to surround Whispering Pines and its every so slightly \\"Stepford Wives\\" inhabitants.<br /><br />A fast, fun read, with nothing to offend anyone (who lives in or near a 21st century metropolitan area), but lots of tantalizing clues and a Twilight Zone-Outer Limits mystery to decipher.<br /><br />Recommended.<br /><br />Update: A there was a sequel (\\"Wayward\\") that will be released in September.  I got an ARC from Amazon Vine.  It's good, but not as good as Pines, mostly because it's the middle of a trilogy. I expect that the last one, presumably to be released sometime in 2014 will tie everything together. But this post script is just to let you know that PInes is actually the first of a trilogy, and I think that is helpful information if someone is deciding whether or not to invest.  My recommendation is, of course, yes.<br /><br />Update2.  Maybe I'm the last to know, but \\"Wayward Pines\\" is a definite for Fox TV in 2014 as an extended miniseries directed by M. Night Shyamalan.  From what I've read, it sounds like it will adhere pretty closely to the novel (Unlike CBS's Under the Dome which has already drifted pretty far afield and has just been renewed for another season).<br /><br />J.M.

B00AMBLXP8|1.0|I thought the premise interesting, but that damn bear was not cute. He was a force for selfish lack of control that was beyond childish.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest and the app makes it a little easier to access on my kindle.  Pinterest is full of ideas.
B0000AYJXR|5.0|Space Jam is one of the greatest movies invented if you're a Michael Jordan fan. Plus, the cartoons make the movie funny and entertaining even if you don't like basketball.
B009MO57H6|4.0|My sister was disappointed by this movie so I had low expectations going into it as we have the exact taste in movies. Although I do agree with her the 1st half was better than the last half, it was still a good addition to the series. This one was very much like a video game - with video game acting and all (haha), but that's what it is meant to be. I thought the ending fight scene would be better (I dont know, more weapons, explosions or something) but it was just a big nasty fist fight which was ok I guess because there were plenty of guns and explosions throughout the rest of the movie. I look forward to the next one for sure.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I was so skeptical about this book, chosen by my book club. I didn't want to read about cancer. I didn't want to be sad. But like teen pregnancy in the movie Juno, cancer doesn't seem to be the main point, but rather the instrument the writer uses to get you to understand so many other life lessons, philosophical notes, etc. I couldn't stop reading it - not because it was an easy beach read, but because it haunted me. I thought about the sentiments the characters discussed all the time. The topic seems sad, but I couldn't stop smiling at how beautiful it all was - from the rich story and understated, intelligent characters to the poignant quotes and layers of underlying thoughts. I can only hope that if I ever write a novel, it measures up to this one.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|DVDs Arrived quickly, and were exactly what I was expecting.  Recommended for anyone wanting this box set.  Nice and compact.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|Love this writer. Again she has written an international best seller. I never cease to be amazed that someone so young can write so well about life and times during World War II etc. Very accurately too. I've loved all her other books and look forward to the next!
B009GIPDQS|4.0|I found this a really good read, hard to put down like all John Grisham books. It had lots of twists and I read it in just over a day.
B007TK77QE|4.0|From wizards to parish councils - there couldn't be a greater divide. As a Harry Potter fan of course I had to read this book and I've bought both the Kindle version and the hard cover to collect. Its raw and emotional and about real people. I don't think its going to be universally appealing because of the subject matter but if you're like me and think that JK Rowling is a brilliant writer then you'll enjoy her latest offering.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I enjoyed the book. It left me wanting more, so either that's a good sign because if peaked my curiosity, or it's a bad sign because it did not satisfy my curiosity. I definitely recommend reading the book as it is very interesting and well written.
B008JFUUIA|4.0|This movie is a partial spin off from Glee but with a fresher script.  The film is part comedy, music, promiscuous and entertaining. Beca (Anna Kendrick) is just starting college where her father is a professor.  She is an audiophile/DJ who is attractive and she finds out that she can sing.  She is invited to join the Barden Bellas which is an all-female a cappella group.  They are striving to become the national champions and their toughest competition is the all-male group the Treblemakers who are also from Barden College.<br /><br />Can Beca get the group to liven up their act and get out of their old comfort zone?  If so they may just have a chance to win....<br /><br />I liked this movie and I found it entertaining and funny.  The cast is very good and this movie is a combination comedy and musical presentation with some great choreography thrown in for good measure.  If you like this type of movie then you will like this film.  The talent in exceptional and it is worth watching.  I recommend it to you.
B003ZHQVJO|5.0|This cd is everthing we thought it could be. We listen to it all the time.<br />Kid Rock is just a real guy singing real songs.

B009YQJ322|4.0|Let's get one thing out of the way up front. The only thing 2012's \\"Dredd\\" and 1995's \\"Judge Dredd\\" have in common is a name. For those who have somehow escaped seeing a trailer for the new take on the futuristic lawman, let me just say there's no comparison between the two. Sylvester Stallone's adaptation of the character boasted stylish clothing, props, and special effects. Karl Urban's has style, but it's in the form of an interesting combination of artsy cinematography and violent grit.<br /><br />The America of the future has been reduced to a desolate wasteland known as the Cursed Earth. The only civilizations left are overcrowded metropolitan areas called Mega Cities. Inside each of their walls, hundreds of thousands of citizens fight for some semblance of a life amongst the decay and crime.<br /><br />The only thing standing in the way of the gangs and other lawbreakers taking over the cities are the Judges. They act as judge, jury, and executioner when they encounter \\"Perps.\\" Joseph Dredd is the most notorious Judge in Mega City One. His skills are put to the ultimate test as he and his new partner, a psychic named Anderson, are commissioned to take down a drug kingpin housed atop a sealed-up tenement where everyone is on the hunt for them.<br /><br />Screenwriter Alex Garland and director Pete Travis did a bang-up (literally) job of delivering a satisfying vision of 2000AD's legendary comic book character. I don't think Dredd fans could have asked for more. All the graphic violence and cynicism readers came to enjoy on the printed page is brought to vivid life with plenty of splashes of bright red to quench the bloodthirsty hordes.<br /><br />I'm extremely impressed with director of photography Anthony Dodd Mantle's work.

B0080XN3C6|5.0|I've had this album on replay for a few days now. I really don't know how Kimbra comes up with her music... every time I listen to a song over again I notice something different. You can tell how carefully crafted all her songs are. Overall, her music is addictive and her live performances are captivating (go on youtube if you haven't yet). Extra bonus songs are great- I especially like \\"Warrior\\".

B000AYQJ3I|5.0|This is a wonderful re-mastered DVD of TheConcertForBanglaDesh from 1971 by GeorgeHarrison&Friends!  The re-recording quality is superb, the music comes alive & the picture quality is at it's best.  This is a very 'honest' remastering and is a 'must-have' for any GeorgeHarrison fan.....plus you gotta love Ringo.....
B000002JSR|2.0|Zep fans, as I, probably expected more here and after years of waiting to purchase, it was a letdown...the band was going through the motions I felt and not exploring.
B00006LSM3|5.0|Sadly.....this is the last GeorgeHarrison record.  Finished after his death by son Dhani & JeffLynne, this is certainly a must have for everybody.....even if you don't know who George is.....buy this one!  This is George at his best!  This record moves from the get-go.....I love it!!!!!
B000002JSJ|2.0|Ok, based on Coda and this album, I am worried about completing the rest of my Zep LP listening, this must have been an obligation to the studios.
B008G12ERC|5.0|Damn.....I love this band!.....this is Matt & the boys with another powerful offering.....likely for Muse fans, but if this is your first Muse record, then enjoy.....then check out the other lp's.....you will be greatly satisfied.....been following this band since their first record (ShowBiz) and this one has only progressed to levels that no one could have guessed.....so crank it up & enjoy.....rock on!!!!!

It's so easy to navigate from book to book - that was the one thing above others that make this so useful for me. One doesn't have to hunt around and try to find a particular book or chapter ... one click and you're there. I recommend most highly!
B006LSZECO|4.0|HaHa- you do not know what is going on here for a while. Then the end twist is mind blowing because you have to think- could I do that??? It calls into question what we will do for love. Parental, romantic, friendly, philo, eros...Sorta mystery but with a deeper level of commitment to the cerebral.
B008M0NDOK|1.0|I received this Duo Gamer for Christmas and was very impressed with it and wrote a great review. But now 6 months later, I'd like to revise my review.<br /><br />The Duo Gamer is no longer being made and Gameloft is no longer going to be making any games work with the duo gamer. Therefore, the eight older games that worked with the Duo Gamer is all this controller is good for. To that end, I say, DO NOT GET THIS!<br /><br />I got the impression that the makers of the Duo Gamer and Gameloft had a falling out, and now what could have been a wonderful marriage of companies has now become a harsh divorce (with Gameloft getting the house, the kids, the bank accounts, and Duo's dignity).<br /><br />If you notice other products by Duo have the same exclusivity product issues where that product only works with one producer of games. This is a bad business plan and it seems other game manufacturers have dumped Duo as well.<br /><br />Now I will never buy another product by Duo, and will never buy another game from Gameloft. They have ruined iPad games for me.<br /><br />Old review:<br />I'm an occasional to moderate user of console systems and games. The problem for me now with console games is we have only one tv, and I have young children. This is a problem because many of the games I would like to play, I can't play because I don't want my children seeing anything on the tv but \\"Good luck Charley\\" and Veggie tales ( if you catch my drift. There are some great games on the iPad (that I can play as long as my kids haven't stolen it from me to play their own games), but I really don't like the feel of touch screen console type games, with the invisible buttons, crazy controls, and my big clunky thumbs (big boned, not fat).Gameloft seems to have all the most graphic and detail oriented games around and I jumped at the chance to try this controller (by recieving it for Christmas).<br /><br />First thing you notice is the controller seems very well made, is very comfortable (even though it looks like it wouldn't be), and has feel of a more expensive PS3 controller. The game play with this controller is awesome. It works great. At least great on the games it works with, but it is pretty new and I'm confident Gameloft will gradually update all of their games to be compatible. I'm loving it. In fact it's so easy to work, conect, and play that my six year old loves to play it too (although kids seem to come out of the womb as full fledged computer programmers these days). He and I play Asphalt racing 7 on this and it's perfect.<br /><br />Don't waste your time with those other sticky gel buttons, cheap controllers, or any of those other products. Been there, done that, couldn't buy the T-shirt because I spent all that money on that junk. Get this controller, it's worth it.en though it looks like it wouldn't be), and has feel of a more expensive PS3 controller. The game play with this controller is awesome. It works great.

0451205766|4.0|Puzo has admitted repeatedly over the years that this classic was just a quickie melodrama he wrote to get some real money so he could then write the stuff he really wanted. Perhaps. And Hitchcock's &#34;Psycho&#34; was a spoof of B grade noirs shot with his television crew, and the Mona Lisa began with another woman's face on a body template, and the design of Fallingwater was slapped together in four hours by Frank LLoyd Wright when he heard the client was heading out to his studio, and...

B000W9399S|4.0|I have loved Pratchett's books for years and I've read many of them. I decided to go back and read the whole series in order, to pick up those I might have missed, and to again enjoy those that I've already read and loved. As the first book in the series, this is a good introduction to Discworld and to some of the characters you'll see repeatedly in future stories--Rincewind, Twoflower, and The Luggage--along with some characters who are recurring personalities in other books.<br /><br />Perhaps because Rincewind isn't my favorite character in Discworld, this isn't one of my favorite books in the series, nor is it my favorite of the Rincewind stories, but it is a good book. It introduces Discworld and the magic that envelopes it. It's fast-paced and entertaining with its broad humored Monty Python type situations. It just doesn't somehow give the less enthusiastic reader a compelling reason to read the second book in the series, and that's a shame. The books get better, and there is a whole world ahead, filled with characters to meet and love. If this is the first of the Discworld series you have read and you find yourself shrugging, pick up another. Discworld is just too enjoyable to miss. Here be laughter.
030758836X|4.0|I love the way Gillian writes. Her descriptive writing is spot on and at times makes me laugh out loud or look over my shoulder. For me the ending really made me think about who is crazier. My kind of book, and will have to read the others.

B007W8S2MG|5.0|First time playing P4, put 80 hours into it.  Fantastic RPG, really fun.  Good voice acting, addictive gameplay.  The dungeon crawling can actually be the more boring part of the game on the first playthrough.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|From Start to Finish this book was incredible. I was torn on whether to stop reading & make it last - or to devour the entire book in one sitting. My heart actually hurt at some points & I had Butterflies most of the time. Beautifully written. I hope we see many more wonderful novels from this obviously talented author.

1475143389|5.0|This book gives great practical advice for adding lean mass. As a sports and exercise science major I am familiar with most of the priciples behind muscle growth, strength gains, and nutrition, as well as how all of these variables affect one another. Personally I have achieved pretty good results from my workout programs in the past, but I never quite achieved the look I was going for. This book pointed out some key omissions I had made in my training, such as not keeping a workout log for each workout. How many guys do you see in the gym on a daily basis who never record their workouts? Are these men blessed with a rain man like ability to recall the exact number of weight, reps, and sets of their last workout? Probably not. As a result they come in every day and do the same workout with the same weight, and guess what else stays the same, their physique. If you want a practical approach to packing on lean mass then this book is for you. Its not pitching some new miracle program, its giving you a tried and true outline for success that others have followed to achieve results. It takes hard work to achieve the body you want, this book acknowledges this, but it also points out the importance of having a scientific method to track your progress. It also covers the importance of your mental attitude towards your training. I wish I had this book when I was beginning my training journey because it lays out facts that many experience lifters have learned through trial and error. I would recommend this book to new lifters because it will save them from getting sucked into the hype of the supplement industry, whos suspect claims, and endorsements from juiced up body builders, trick young men all around the world into waisting their money. I also think lifters who have been in the game a while, and who are looking to break through to the next level will get something out of the practical advice in this book.I've noticed a change in body composition over the past three weekswhile applying the principles taught in this book. I'm getting more out of my workouts, I'm lifting heavier weights, and my muscles are noticeably denser.This book gives you the gameplan for success but its up to you to follow it.<br /><br />Oh also, Mike is great about answering questions. He personally emailed me out of the blue and asked how things were going, and has continued to answer all of my questions. Well worth the 10 dollars or so.

I highly recommend this book.  I would have finished it in one sitting if I could, but alas I had to go to bed so I could go to work the next day.<br /><br />Brandon is once again proving why he was the right choice to finish this series.  Had Robert Jordan lived I don't think this series would have ever been finished.<br /><br />I would prefer to wait to write this review until I'm finished, but I'm a little fed-up with the unhelpful reviews and wanted to offer some counter balance.

030759565X|5.0|I am incredibly late to the game. I didn't learn about the Smitten Kitchen blog until December. I instantly subscribed to it, and hours later I still hadn't surfaced from reading old posts so my poor, abandoned husband ordered me this cookbook as a Christmas present.<br /><br />I think of Deb Perelman as the very witty and opinionated friend who I run to for sure-to-be-a-hit recipes. She cooks all of them over and over until they're perfect in a tiny apartment kitchen in New York. No longer can I insult the small kitchen in my first home--if Deb can perservere and win with limited space, then so can I. These recipes are splendid, the kind of foods you have random cravings for and see in magazines and want to make. She effortlessly bosses you through each recipe while telling amusing asides about her family, herself, and her husband's family.<br /><br />The chapters are divided into breakfast;salads; sandwiches, tarts, and pizzas; the main dish: vegetarian; the main dish: seafood, poultry and meat; sweets; and party snacks and drinks. You also have sections on tips, measurements, and building your own smitten kitchen. I like this author. It is obvious that food is her first love and she spends inordinate amounts of time daydreaming about and then revamping recipes. Her blueberry cornmeal butter cake is the result of wanting to cross blueberry buckle with the kind of sweet cornbread that would \\"make Southerners shudder\\". It's a marriage made in heaven, certainly, but the author knows to poke a little fun at herself and warn readers that she's treading on sacred, controversial ground...cornbread recipes are sacred stuff.<br /><br />The true test of her cookbook was when I tried her tomato glazed meatloaf recipe. She thought she was a meatloaf hater. I thought I was a meatloaf hater. Hers sings with dijon, worstershire, and smoked paprika. It's formed in large glazed meatballs to trick those of us with a bias into thinking we're eating something else. And you know what?It reformed me. My spouse (who is also a meatloaf hater) groaned  happily while eating it. A very picky toddler in our home lapped it up.<br /><br />The book is a gorgeous hardback filled with her expert photography done in her postage stamp sized kitchen. You get familiar with her refreshingly normal countertops and everyday plates and serving pieces. It's consoling to see someone with kitchen equipment and servingware as usual as your own turning out such satisfying, pretty foods. It makes me a little envious that she's a gifted cook, writer, and photographer. She includes some favorites from her blog, but most of these recipes are new. She is a former vegetarian and has given me lots and lots of ideas for our csa subscription starting in the spring. I also want to say she is honest and has no problem telling us where she adapted her recipes from when it is applicable.<br /><br />My only complain about this book is that it isn't three times as long. At 321 pages, it just succeeded in leaving me ravenously hungry for more.
0307405095|5.0|I REALLY LOVE COOKING BOOKS. I HAD PIES AND TARTS OF MARTHA STEWART ANOTHER EDITION, I LOVE TO MAKE A LOT OF PIES OF THAT BOOK. THIS ONE IS ALSO VERY NICE, I MADE 2 OR 3 RECIPES AND ARE VERY WELL EXPLAINED AND DELICIOUS. THANK YOU
B003CSV7TK|5.0|Quality stands the test of time and this one is definitely quality.  Well acted and never slips in sloppy sentimentality.  It is also a welcome relief to see the child star (Natalie Wood) do a professional job and not weep her way or cute her way through her part.  The balance of the cast is outstanding (in my eyes) for their professionalism in handling what could have been a sloppy sweet telling.<br /><br />Bought this to keep and share with family and friends over the coming holidays.

I tried the sample and found it to be intriguing, so I spent the enormous sum of 99¢ to get the entire book and just couldn't stop reading it.  An intelligent, captivating read.  This book is easily worth many times the price, and I am looking forward to paying any reasonable price for whatever this author produces next. GREAT book!!!

B00746TURW|4.0|If one expects traditional thriller or humane story...forget it. This a bleak, desolate intriguing tale of actions and consequences. It goes to the theme of existentialism and human resolve/acceptance. Written in the 1st person, which in itself is a different take, it also explores the equal weighting of actions (in this case parental), and the unequal effects and consequences. The barren Saskatchewan tundra is a perfect setting for a tale of physical survival and a &#34;numbing down&#34; emotional survival. It won't cheer you up. It won't make you feel good. It will definitely make you think and feel. Great work!

055358202X|3.0|NB: You should have read the first three books prior to reading this review.<br /><br />Summary: The weakest book in the series, though not necessarily a bad book. Lots (too many) of new characters, many of whom seem redudant/uninteresting. Pages per chapter rate is too high. The book gets better as you move through it, but does not come close to Storm of Swords.<br /><br />Even before I read into this book's development, I could tell that it was a poorly planned book. In the previous three, Martin's writing always feels as though it has a purpose. You can tell the story is going somewhere, even if you can't tell where. The twists come, but they are not cheap twists. They fit into the context of the story and you can understand characters' motivations. In this book, several twists come to mind that make me think, &#34;why?&#34;. Perhaps I will find out in the next book (I have not read it yet). In general, though, the chapters and the story seem to be moving without purpose. Sure, things happen, but they are not especially exciting.<br /><br />Part of this problem can be traced to the characters. About 2/3 of the perspectives are new; this would not be a problem if these were perspectives of characters we had seen very often. Three of them, I believe, have never appeared in the books aside from descriptions or references. Several others we have met briefly. Too many are unfamiliar. Some are introduced and then disappear for long stretches of the book. And then there is Cersei. By far, she takes up the most room in this book. Martin has done a good job of casting unlikable characters in a sympathetic light once we are introduced to their perspective. We may still dislike them, but we understand their motivations better. So, I was interested to get a look into Cersei's mind. Unfortunately, she is just as one-dimensional in this book as she is in the others. The big reveal, where we learn what motivates her, comes slowly and isn't fully realized until near the end of the book, but it's fairly disappointing. That's why she is how she is?<br /><br />Martin also uses this bizarre naming convention for his chapters, whereby some characters are referred to by their name, some by their title, some by their alias, and some by a random descriptor. So, Arya has assumed about 10 different names throughout the books thus far, but suddenly her chapters are renamed to fit the name she takes in this book. You'll meet a new character in Dorne, the captain of Prince Doran's Guards, so he is called the The Captain of the Guards. Meanwhile, Jaime, who is now the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, is still just Jaime. Then there is another character is described at one point with a reference to her current situation. That is, every other chapter name (alias, given name, title) could be considered a proper title to be used in greeting the character, with one exception. Why? I don't know. Oh, they change throughout the book. So, you meet a ton of new characters and then when you reach their second or third chapter have to spend a paragraph discrerning who this chapter is about. The most glaring example of this is found in the second half of the book when the alias used as the chapter name fits two different characters.<br /><br />And yet the book is still good, as far as books go. Some of the new perspectives are interesting, picking up storylines from book three that you hoped would not be dropped. I have heard people say they do not enjoy Arya's chapters as much in this book, but I still found her to be as interesting as ever. Meanwhile, and this is a testament to Martin's writing as I wouldn't have imagined this in the first book, Sansa is starting to rival Arya as one of my favorite characters. The book hits it's high water mark near the end in a quite unlikely place. You will know it when you get there as a smile might creep across your face.

B003O86FMW|5.0|Wasn't sure I wanted to be caught up in the phenom at first. Now I can't put them down!!! Such strength of character for s young girl and what she represents. If only adults could realize what it means to be selfless, to think of others before yourself. Great book!!! Kudos!!!!
B0099114WO|5.0|I loved this movie.  Some parts I laughed and some parts I cried.  It was very true to life.  Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones did a wonderful job of portraying a couple struggling with communication after 30+ years of marriage.
0679805273|5.0|Such a motivational book. I absolutely love it. I wish I had purchased it years ago!  I love reading it to my son and will continue for years to come!
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|Good all round movie with some good action scene's. Plot line is quite original in my opinion. Worth watching for sure if you like any of these two actors.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was very good, but if you are going to read this you need to read the rest of the series. It is perfectly paced and interesting if you like books with adventure and it may be a little violent for most people though. As soon as I started reading I couldn't stop reading. I give this book five stars.
B000I9YWDO|5.0|I bought it as a gift for my dad, he used to have it on vhs and had to get an update since we laugh at it so much.
B009VSW15Y|4.0|This Camera compliments the Kindle very well.  The camera that is on the Kindle is very basic and doesnot take the best photos or does not take videos.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I felt weird reading these books, especially so in the first book. It's often disturbing. But as Fifty Shades uncovers his wounds and falls more in love with Ana, it begins to feel less disturbing. And so I continued to read books two and three. I loved the way the story winds up as Christian heals and is freed. Oops. Have I given away too much? Just a little encouragement to others who may hesitate to read the whole series because it makes them uncomfortable. Go for it.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I love playing Solitaire and wondered if I could on my Kindle.  So glad the App Store had a free version.  It's easy to use. The auto-fill feature is nice as is the hint button.
0765325950|5.0|Everyone is commenting that there was no release on electronic format. What's that got to do with the actual book? Was it well written? Did it had any pages missing in the printing? Did Brandon Sanderson include Kaladin from The Way of Kings? (uhh?)Its so annoying that people give it a bad rate for something totally none related to the product.<br /><br />Please people, THINK!! Should I give it a bad rating because there is no Paperback edition?
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was unsure about this book after reading the description. The popularity kept growing so I thought I would give it a try. Once I started reading I was captivated and did not want to put the book down. I had the entire series read within the week.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Graphics are simple and clean movement isn't choppy. Don't like ads but they're easy to get passed. All in all a decent game
B008B3H4VQ|3.0|At first I wasn't impressed with this a album at all but it does has a couple of good songs,  but lacking the completeness of earlier albums
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I enjoyed the fast pace of the story line. The author kept my attention even in the predictable sections. I was surprised by the last few chapters but totally enjoyed the ending.
B005ZMTYBY|5.0|Love it!<br />Tim Burton is a master. If you like his animation work you will enjoy this.<br />A Must for Halloween and Christmas
B005CRQ4OW|4.0|I that it was a berry good book so read on opp<br /> Hangman style like a boss and like it
0765325950|5.0|Last I checked this space is to review the book, not tell people how \\"horrible\\" they are for giving one-star reviews because an eBook is unavailable. No one has that right as these reviews are to help others to decide if they wish to purchase this book in any form. There are many reasons people are asking for the eBook version which is scheduled to come out in April when the book will be ruined by anyone who has bought the bound version and couldn't keep their mouths shut while around those who wait for an eBook. It's like not going to see a movie and instead waiting for the DVD. You do not know these reasons so here's an idea. Use the space for an actual review on how much you love (or hate if that's possible) this book. Maybe people will stop treating this as a place to bitch about how others choose to tell the publisher's how remarkably silly they are on the lack of eBook as this doesn't reflect on the authors as it does on the publishers and anyone who can read reviews can clearly see why there are so many one star reviews. Just because people give a one-star doesn't mean they hate the book or the authors or even the publishers, they're just upset. There is a difference between being upset and hating. So now on the real reason a person should be writing a review; the REVIEW!<br /><br />So far it is wonderful. Since I have full days during the week I cannot read this in one sitting and can only read a little at a time, hopefully by the weekend I will have finished all 900 + pages. It is up to the brilliance of writing us FANS have come to expect from this series and it is sad that this marks the end, but it seems to be coming out beautifully.<br /><br />A real fan couldn't ask for it to be better (maybe longer, but....) and I could probably finish this faster if it was an eBook as it is one heavy book so I don't take it with me. I would have preferred the eBook for that reason, not to mention my personal library is going to need expanding soon to fit more books.
B004LWZWGA|4.0|The trilogy comes to a close leaving fans with a desire to see the franchise rebooted with new energy and thrills. The story is somewhat flawed in that we are led to believe that a battered and broken Batman can return to a major league level of fighting and action despite substantial orthopedic injuries. The fight sequences with Bain are tiresome. I still like the Indy Jones solution to a threat -- just shoot him. Gadgets are fun, motorcycle is awesome and supporting cast is attractive and good for the story. Don't miss the opening sequence waiting for the popcorn to pop -- you must see this opening act!
B008YWY0HK|4.0|I got this for my 10 year old daughter for Christmas.  When we watched it together I teared up at the end, while my daughter sat there stone faced lol.  It's a cute movie thats good for slightly older kids.  The evil bear might be a little scary for some younger children, although he really wasn't in most of the movie.
B00931JMRE|2.0|I guess I must be getting old and jaded. Songs sound like a rehash of 80's hits and lack the electric nature of inspiration. If you are a pure ZZ Top fan like myself, you'll tolerate the session. But, if you want the explosiveness of sound and originality, go back a couple of decades and revisit the songs that would make you shout.
B009GESJH2|5.0|While I am a Kid Rock fan, there were a number of songs I like on this CD, but as a whole...this CD did not really live up to my expectations. It's not a bad CD...just didn't really have a WOW factor to it in its entirety.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|You said it wouldn't work on my 2nd Kindle.  Well, fine, but I was looking to download it for my Nexus 10!  I previously returned a Kindle Fire to you and now own exactly one other kindle product.  So, your problem.  Guess I will try Barnes & Noble for their Nook app.
B009LDXQGC|5.0|One of my favorite bands and has great compilation of my favorite songs from previous CD releases, as well as a couple new songs. If you are a 3 Doors Down fan, you won't be disappointed.

B00005NG9Z|2.0|The DVD was shipped and arrived in a timely fashion and in good shape.  However the DVD content was too much of a documentary style (with some language) whereas I'd hoped for just music videos.  I'll just regift it to a die-hard Alice in Chains fans and I'm sure they'll be excited.
B007SGM084|3.0|Like everyone else I had a hard time not reading &#34;just one more chapter&#34;. However after the second book I found myself still hooked but eager for it to be over. I got tired of the same thing again and again.  Just like watching a soap opera I realized I was yelling in my head all the things that this young lady should have done differently and been aware of!

B007IXWKUK|5.0|I chose to give this 5 stars because it is so well written and its always keeping me interested and wanting more.Definitely a page turner,I find myself getting lost in the books and falling in love with Christian and Ana,always wondering what's gonna happen next.I let out a gasp or a laugh every once in while and my husband gives me the funniest looks.I would definitely recommend it to people who want to boost their intimacy with their significant other,or people who enjoy the \\"fantasy life every girl dreams of having\\",just reading about their lives almost makes me feel like I'm involved in it,I love these books and will reread them again and again!
0765325950|1.0|Found a used copy of Eye of the World in 1990; it caught my attention as the book was almost size of hardback but softcover. Since then I have purchased each new book on the date it was released.  I will not purchase this book though.  I had planned on repurchasing all of the previous books for my Kindle as easier to store, but I will not do this as I would not be able to complete the series now.  I instead will search internet when I get home and will be paying the first industrious individual that has scanned the book and offered for sale.
B00846REIS|5.0|I can't wait for the third book to see what happends. I enjoy reading the book i'm getting ready to read it again.
B009JZTOG8|4.0|I loved Season 1, and I am enjoying Season 2 - there's something wonderful about seeing the stories you grew up with transform into tales that still entertain you after you've become an adult.  I've been made to care about these incarnations of characters, but I am hoping that there will be some more growth in their personalities.  Right now they seem a little 2-dimensional, because so much has happened over the course of the last two seasons but only Emma seems to have really changed.  I think the appeal of this series was that primarily one-dimensional fairy tale characters could be turned into people that really change and evolve according to their experiences, but I haven't been seeing much of that in the last few episodes.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Beautifully written, Charlie's story and personality sucks you into the book and makes you love him and the people around him. Being able to relate to the high school scenarios made this book an easy read. Definitely one of my favorite books I've ever read.
B005LAII80|4.0|I won't recount the plot of Dredd, there is plenty of that in the product details. I will briefly say that this is a solid action film that I wish had done better at the Box Office (and I find myself partly to blame for this)<br /><br />Karl Urban is great as Dredd, delivering a gruff hardass anonymity to the role. Olivia Thirlby is pretty good too, mixing a vulnerability with a hard edged confidence as well. She plays a psychic with a magical realism that you don't often see in these characters and has a great psychic standoff with a criminal. Lena Headey could have been given more to do.<br /><br />But let's be real, it's not meant to be a thoughtful and intriguing rumination on government and police (although there is a lot of potential for that) It's an action film. It's a low budget high violence B movie action flick. Fans of anything done by actors who could appear in the Expendables should enjoy this.<br /><br />I'm not saying it's brainless, and I'm not saying it's dumb. But it is simple and straightforward and I say that in a good way. A very enjoyable action film with a killer soundtrack.<br /><br />Enjoy the Judgement.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|As usual, Streep is unrecognizable as anyone other than the character she plays and Steve Carrell holds his own. Pieces may seem familiar to the long-married in the audience. Husband of 30+ years and I watched together and both enjoyed.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book wasn't at all what I thought it was going to be but it turned out to be a really good book. Dean and Sky have a great connection. The twist and turns leave you wanting more. Good read and definitely recommend.
B001JIFYSA|5.0|Sweet, charming, and easy on the eyes. Bill Nighy is a hoot. Keira Knightly is featured but isn't the ficus, for a change.
B004VQK9XW|5.0|James, Nikki and DJ have created yet another album that will stand the test of time.  Every track is a potential single, which means you aren't hearing most of the great music if you only download the singles.

1455502758|4.0|Christopher Hitchens is dead, but he lived long enough to tell us of his dying. Reporter extraordinaire, atheist provocateur, prolific author, and acerbic commentator and debater, Christopher Hitchens died in 2011. His dying was (quite fittingly) a literary morbidity: he wrote of it in a small, posthumously published book called Mortality.  (The book also includes a foreword by Graydon Carter and an afterward by Carol Blue, Hitchens's widow.) Unlike most, who die un-narrated deaths, he knew of his impending demise, retained his writing prowess, and lived long enough to tell us of his dying.  In so doing, he reveals how one very articulate and intractable atheist came to terms with his imminent demise. Hitchens was an iconoclast (even writing a book against Mother Theresa called, in bad taste, The Missionary Position), a masterful conversationalist, and intrepid enough to write on some topics he was not fit to pronounce upon. Consider his best-selling and embarrassing harangue, god is not Great (2006). This anti-religious sentiment pops up throughout the book, hurled more as hand grenades than laid out as arguments. I will address a few of these below, particularly the question of the logic of prayer. (Hitchens's lack of philosophical acuity is painfully obvious in his debate with Christian philosopher, William Lane Craig, which is available on line.)<br /><br />In the middle of a book tour for a memoir, Hitch-22, Hitchens came down with severe symptoms that were later found to be esophageal cancer, a rapid and rarely curable form of this perennial plague on humanity. Hitchens tells his story without self-pity or lugubrious detail. In fact, he writes with a kind of detachment--here are the facts; here are my reflections on them--but not without some pathos. This slim volume is a less a lament than a report, which is apt enough, given Hitchens' vocation. But it, nevertheless, discloses something of the sting of death, inflicted on one without the hope of the gospel. Hitchens remains a naturalist to the end: everyone dies; there is no afterlife; that is the way it is--and I might as well write about it.<br /><br />Hitchens does his best to defeat the Grim Reaper, but progressively realizes that his chances of recovery are slim and finds no reason to hope against hope. So, he submits to whatever may slow his death, ameliorate his pain, and give him more time to write and speak. He is never sentimental, and offers some astute insights into dying, albeit dying without hope in the world to come. Nevertheless, Christians have an entirely different perspective on mortality, as Paul says, \\"Brothers and sisters, we do not want you to be uninformed about those who sleep in death, so that you do not grieve like the rest of mankind, who have no hope\\" (2 Thessalonians 4:13; see also vs. 14-18).<br /><br />As he dies writing, Hitchens considers some clich&eacute;s on the matter, such as Friedrich Nietzsche's often-invoked-but-seldom-thought-through aphorism, \\"What does not kill you makes you stronger.\\" Hitchens once thought this profound, but changed his mind in the grip of mortality. Yes, suffering can strengthen one, but it also tears one down. He says, \\"In the brute physical world, and the one encompassed by medicine, there are all too many things that could kill you, don't kill you, and then leave you considerably weaker\\" (60).  Hitchens then goes on to reflect on the truth of this statement as illustrated in the life of Nietzsche himself (60-63), a man much enfeebled--especially in his intellectual judgments--through certain turns of circumstance, particularly the debilitating  mental illness that closed out the last decade or so of his tragi-comic life.<br /><br />Of course, Hitchens had no recourse to the concept of the fall of humanity is space-time history, but Christians realize that \\"life under the sun\\" (Ecclesiastes) is replete with suffering, pain, and unfairness--much of it seemingly meaningless, as the Preacher said:<br /><br />I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all (Ecclesiastes 9:11, KJV).<br /><br />East of Eden (Genesis 3; Romans 3) and before the New Jerusalem descends on to the New Heavens and New Earth (Revelation 21-22), we live in the time between Christ's resurrection and the consummation of all things at the Eschaton. What does not kill us, may or may not make us stronger. However, if we are \\"in Christ\\" (as the Apostle Paul so often says) we can know that our suffering (even when not understood) is not wasted or finally absurd, since Christ himself ensured the final victory over sin, death, and hell through his Cross and resurrection (1 Corinthians 15). Therefore, we soldier on, bruised, bloodied, betrayed, benumbed by the scorched sorrows of this groaning world (Romans 8:18-26), and yet with a hope that \\"does not disappoint us\\" (Romans 5:5). Sadly, in Mortality, Hitchens reflects, instructs, and rebukes, but he could not hope that the final enemy of death would ever be defeated. In fact, in his demise he continued his apologetic against religion and Christianity. Consider his contemptuous argument against prayer, which is a staple of the Christian life (1 Thessalonians 5:17).<br /><br />After writing of Christians who told him that they were praying for him, Hitchens attacks the very logic of prayer. He gets off to a snickering and clever start by quoting Ambrose Bierce's Devil's Dictionary: \\"Prayer: A petition that the laws of nature be suspended in favor of the petitioner; himself confessedly unworthy\\" (21). Hitchens dilates on this by explaining the apparent absurdity of a mere mortal informing the Immortal Sovereign on how He (God) should govern the universe. One could set up the argument this way (although Hitchens does not put it in an analytical form).<br /><br />God is sovereign and all-good.<br />Humans are mortal and sinful.<br />Therefore (a), God has no need for prayer by mortal and sinful humans, given his character (1).<br />Therefore (b), Humans have no need for prayer, since it would be superfluous at best and presumptuous at worst.<br />But this line of argument commits the straw man fallacy by misconstruing the nature of prayer, biblically understood. First, there are many dimensions to prayer besides intercession (asking God to do something in the world). The Bible is graced with many prayers and many kinds of prayer, including praise, lament, confession, thanksgiving, and more. Second, intercession is not meaningless or illogical if God is sovereign and all-good. Consider this counter-argument:<br /><br />God, who is sovereign and good, has instituted intercession as one means by which he rules the world. That is, God ordains both the means (including intercessory prayer) and the ends (the final result of his sovereign will).<br />God instructs us on how to engage in intercessory prayer in the Bible and enjoins us to pray accordingly.<br />Therefore, we should intercede with God according to biblical truths, as best we can ascertain them as fallen mortals.<br />There is nothing illogical about the above argument; it makes perfect sense. To those who say, \\"If God is sovereign, why pray?\\" one can retort, \\"If God is sovereign, why eat?\\" (This is from a lecture given by the late philosopher and theologian Greg Bahnsen.) God has set up the world in such a way as to make prayer meaningful. Further, prayer can shape the character of the one who prays, whether or not our requests are granted. Spirit-led prayer changes us for the better, whatever other effects it may have. Christians can and should hold firm to these truths, Hitchens's (well-written) banter to the contrary.<br /><br />Sadly, some Christians responded in an ungodly way to Hitchens's disease. Hitchens quotes a statement from a web site that gloats over his malignancy, since Hitchens was such an ardent atheist and cutting critic of Christianity.<br /><br />He's going to writhe in agony and pain and wither away to nothing and then die a horrible agonizing death, and THEN comes the real fun, when he's sent to HELLFIRE forever to be tortured and set afire (12).<br /><br />Orthodox Christians should, on the basis of the Bible, believe in an eternal hell and its divine justice (Matthew 25:31-46); but this website's manner of exulting in eternal torment is both unnerving and unbiblical. Jesus himself lamented over the rebellion of his own people.<br /><br />O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing (Matthew 23:35).<br /><br />Or ponder God's statement through the prophet Ezekiel: \\"For I take no pleasure in the death of anyone, declares the Sovereign LORD. Repent and live!\\" (Ezekiel 18:32).<br /><br />The death of Christopher Hitchens at age sixty-two robbed the world of a brilliant wit, a flamboyant character, and a larger-than-life life. But living larger than life--apart from Christ, life itself (John 10:30)--does nothing to defeat death. We should lament the loss of Hitchens's gifts, but lament even more the loss of Christopher Hitchens himself, given his unrepentant rebellion against the very God who gave him those literary gifts.is sovereign and all-good.<br />Humans are mortal and sinful.<br />Therefore (a), God has no need for prayer by mortal and sinful humans, given his character (1).<br />Therefore (b), Humans have no need for prayer, since it would be superfluous at best and presumptuous at worst.<br />But this line of argument commits the straw man fallacy by misconstruing the nature of prayer, biblically understood.

B000002LAC|4.0|I'm glad I bought this CD.<br />The way they harmonize on &#34;To Know Him Is To Love Him&#34; is reason enough to buy this!<br />The strong voice of Linda Ronstadt blends so well with Dolly Parton's unmistakable one and Emmylou Harris' voice makes you sway. Each voice makes you feel, and isn't that what music is?<br />If you like any one of these three ladies, you'll want this CD!
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|Bad acting, Too Long, Poor Character Development, Mediocre Story, The only redeeming factor is the special effects were pretty good.
B000P0J0A6|4.0|We watched this with our children when it first came out and loved it. I've been meaning to buy it for years, just never got around to it... I finally HAD to buy so our grand children can enjoy it. And they do!!!<br />The five and six year old boys started to get a little scared at one point but we reassured them they would like it, and 2 or 3 minutes later they were laughing again and have watched it many times since.<br />I am so glad I bought it!<br />It is really well done and from an original idea. (That doesn't happen often anymore!)<br />It's 28 years old, but if you didn't know that you wouldn't guess it!<br />I recommend this to everyone with or with out kids of any age. Just make sure you have the popcorn ready!
0670026603|5.0|At 26 years old, Louisa Clark is a friendly, sensible, ordinary girl with a flair for unconventional fashion and a desire for something more. She is still living at home, plodding through a dull relationship when she unexpectedly finds herself unemployed. With few skills, fewer job opportunities and her family's desperate need for her financial contribution, Lou reluctantly interviews for a position as a well paid day time care giver for a quadriplegic man.<br /><br />Will Traynor is a wealthy 35 year old man on top of the world until a freak accident leaves him with severe spinal injury. This once independent, active man is now humiliated and embittered to be dependent on others for his most basic of needs. Will struggles with continuing to just exist when he can no longer participate in life the way he so desires. He has decided a plan for himself but what he doesn't anticipate is the girl hired to keep him company giving him a reason to love. Lou bursts into Will's life and forever leaves everyone involved changed.<br /><br />I LOVED this page turner of a story. It completely caught me off guard. There were moments I laughed out loud and times where I wept relentlessly. Me Before You has an entertainingly dysfunctional ensemble cast that reminds us love can be difficult and complex, but we are always better because of it. This story made me remember the old saying, \\"Never judge a man until you've walked a mile in his shoes\\". It is a wise story of love that captured heart and left me feeling powerfully moved.  - Wendy
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This book was good... Kept me hooked. But I was surprised by how the ending really caught me off guard!
B0069G5Z9K|2.0|A really fun game, but the &#34;nerds&#34; hiding and ducking thier heads when he flies over is horrible. Canceled the game because of it.
B001NT057K|5.0|Just a classic. This is appealing more for a certain generation, but I would guess a lot of younger people know the words to most of these songs.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|Soundtrack is exactly what you hear in the film, including the option, tears and sobs from the actors. I just wish it was longer and included more than the main songs. Probably best if listened to after seeing the film ( so you understand some of the breaths and sobs from the singers). Overall excellent, just wish it wasn't over so quickly.
B00A757EFW|5.0|Have been looking for the old classic games. This was a family favorite. It is different than having a control or joy stick.....practice is the key!
B0090EJR1K|3.0|Some good laughs, but not as edgily funny as Borat. A decent renter. Some good fun poked at sexist mentality!
B005HSL626|4.0|If you want to keep the kids occupied (younger children) good. It is more like playing a game than some of the others.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|From the beginning I was engrossed into the story . It was hard to put the story down every night.
B005P5TQPU|5.0|I'm glad this show has been running as long as it has. They do a great job of coming up with new stories. Just when you wonder how many more story lines they can think up.....here comes another season. Acting is great & story line is great. I do suggest if you have never seen this show before, watch some of the 1st season so you have a good idea of what started this story.
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|Probably the most predictable book I have ever read. I hate reading books when you know more than the characters know about themselves. I could have told you almost everything that was going to happen in this book by the time I was 25 pages in.<br />Don't waste your money or time. I am never getting it back!
B004TI1WME|5.0|This is the best calculator I have used on any device. I love the running tape that is almost impossible to find anywhere else. I don't care what calculator comes pre-installed on any of my devices....I will boot them out & change to Office Pro. Thanks guys great job!
B00ARF92HK|2.0|I tried to watch the movie, and it was so bad I could not make it to the end. Bad acting, bad action, well just bad everything. I would rather watch the Stallone version, even with Rob Schneider.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|I enjoyed this movie even though I had never seen any of the previous movies. My husband said I should go back & watch the first 2 so I knew what was going on. But I didn't find that I needed to do that. I was already half way into this one so I just kept watching. But this was good enough I will be backtracking to the first 2. And although I instant streamed it...I will still by a hard copy.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I absolutely loved this book! I read the 50 Shades trilogy and did not think I could find another that was better.....but I did! You live and feel every ounce of pain and joy with Gideon and Eva. I gave this book a 4.5 out of 5 because the most annoying part of this series is how Eva acted so childish and immature and it became very frustrating at times. Even with that, this series is amazing so far and has me anxiously awaiting the 3rd and final book!
B005DOKIYG|1.0|I do not understand why this product is sold!  I ordered one, my brand new Kindle Fire would NOT fit into it!  I tried every possible way, but the Fire is just about 1/4 inch too large  and the sleeve will not zip, so it is useless.  I thought I had a faulty sleeve, so returned it, another one was sent, but it had exactly the same problem.  My Kindle Fire just doesn't fit into it.  Hasn't anyone else had this problem?
B000001EGA|3.0|Loved the music but realized when he made this it was a poor recording. Still happy to have a copy though.
B000AAF1U4|5.0|This movie is hysterical. My husband wanted this movie for Christmas and I had such a hard time finding it in stores.<br /><br />I bought the movie online and it was shipped quickly (got it before Christmas!) and in the exact condition described.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|I downloaded this Christmas day and almost immediately started playing chess with my grandson. It is a slick looking program, the moves are crisp and pleasingly clear.<br /><br />The control interface is intuitive and easy to set up. I almost beat the program on the medium level and I'm not that good a player, just sort of randomly aggressive I guess.<br /><br />I couldn't ask for a better chess program.
B004DI7HZ6|1.0|This book was horrible.  It was so bad that I quit at 93%.  I was so close to the end, but had reached a point where I couldn't care less about what would happen to these characters.  If you feel that way HUNDREDS of pages into a book, there's a problem.
B0097NGUJG|5.0|This is an album that can be listened to all the way through. Every time I listen to it, I'm disappointed that it's over! Sample the songs, buy it, sit back, relax and enjoy your next hour or so.
B001NKI60W|5.0|if you love music.  this is the movie.  I can watch it over and over again.  but you have to like music.  I love the part that I can sing with it too.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|Didn't quite meet my expectations. Still a pretty good story for Scifi buffs waiting for more and better movies... especially those tired or Batman and the LOTR remakes and other graphic novels come to screen. There are so many good Scifi books to make movies from!
B00A8ECU24|4.0|This is a cute little game. I just got started and so far I love it. I recommend this too anyone who enjoys this type of game.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|I have to say, no Matt Daemon... I waited until It came to rental. But I really liked it. I'm glad they didn't try and replace the borne character, but rather paralleled the plot. I haven't read the books... not my kind of reading. But the movies are great so far. I hope they make more. Still, I miss Jason Bourne! Maybe both characters can play together! That would be cool.
B008DM4OTA|3.0|Once you make a pet better, it just goes back, but nothing builds up...so no motivation to continue to other levels.
B009LUBA7M|5.0|Fun, peppy, a joy to to listen to!  I see great growth in his work.  The lyrics are fantastic as well.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|I got this for her on her new Nabi Tablet and she loves it.  Plus, unlike Magic Piano, she can actually learn what keys to press to play the songs on a real keyboard.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|All movies were included, Shipped fast and great price,  i like having all the movies in one box set instead of individual movie sleeves.
B008K8VDPU|4.0|I love this app! I play it, my grandkids play it, and my dog loves hearing it. I font know I'd there is a modern songs version, but if so I will be getting it. The tones are very true and the ability to listen, or play in three different levels is wonderful! Get it and have fun while learning!
B0090EJR1K|3.0|Good comic pairing with Cohen and Anna Faris. They have some of the best scenes. The more &#34;political&#34; side was, eh.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I Love being able to buy this type of product right to the device, no trip to the store, Bonus!
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Gave it to my 20-something daughter for a present and she was thrilled. Feminist, heroic, dramatic, all those things. She'll have to bring it home so I can see it.
B005CRQ4GU|1.0|This book was pretty good. I liked reading it because it a journal of a kid that is in middle school. Which is my grade
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Very cute game. A bit on the easy side,but a fun way to pass the time. Can't wait for more in the updates.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|The account is clearly written and easy to read.  The author provides and describes his experiences and lets the reader draw their own conclusions.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|My 3rd grader is an avid reader. We were excited about purchasing e books for her to read using her nabi 2. The app worked for about a week...it now crashes constantly. We purchased books that she is not able to read on her nabi. Very dissapointing...please fix!
B003TSEEDY|4.0|While it wouldn't qualify as my favorite book ever or anything, it was quite the page turner.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love the book it was the best book I've read since I've got my kindle I hope the next one is as good as the last one was ;)
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a mind game that will require to think and have fun at the same time.  It is a game the entire family will enjoy playing.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Can't wait for Season 3 - have it taped and this was just what I need to catch me up.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I'm pretty picky and this was a great read. You connect with the characters and there are tons of twists that you don't see coming. Unlike most YA novels where there is one main conflict in the book, this one is filled with tons of unexpected twists and keeps you glued!
B000OZ0NXA|2.0|A nice read, but you figure out the big mystery before the main characters do. Action scenes were not very vivid. All in all, still a good read. Went by very fast. I am not sure if I will read the rest of the series. May not even see the movie now. Not a very believable hero.
1400069289|5.0|Its already making a difference in my life.  Especially with the new year, many people are skeptical of making resolutions to change because habits are so hard to change and this book gives you the tools to do it.
0765325950|3.0|A satisfying conclusion to an epic series.<br /><br />The hard truth is that the book is utterly predictable.  In all of our conversations not a single person has said \\"what really surprised me was when...\\"  It's far more common that we go \\"oh, and when <something> happened, it was just like I'd imagined it would be!\\"  My brother who was enamored with looking closely at the prophecies and the subtle hints finished this book feeling thoroughly vindicated in his predictions.  The difficulty with the book, though, is that feeling vindicated and satisfied isn't the stuff of a five star book.<br /><br />I understand the drive to slap 5 stars on this book and walk away satisfied.  I've been reading these books since the third came out (took a while for my brother to talk me into picking it up), and the series has been a part of my life for quite some time.  It shaped the way I looked at other works in the genre and was the benchmark against which all other books were measured, at least for a time.  I understand the drive to see this as the crowning jewel of the series.  But the hard truth is that it isn't.  This book will leave long-time readers feeling satisfied, as it should, and maybe that's enough for a four star rating.<br /><br />But there are some pretty glaring problems the book.  One problem, which has also been mentioned by other reviewers, was in the long battle passages.  What should have been exhilarating was frankly somewhat tedious (and the majority of the reading I do is in professional journals, so I have a pretty high threshold for tedium).  It's hard to give a book a four star rating when you have to slog through whole pieces of it.  This is indicative of a larger problem with the book, in that the sense of mystery, wonder, and adventure was not present in the same way it was earlier in the series.  Even during some of the more frenzied portions you still have the overarching feeling that these are things winding down and not events building to a conclusion.<br /><br />So three stars.  Hopefully this review will be a kindness.  You're going to read it either way (whether you buy it now, wait until april, or borrow it when your buddy's finished with his/her copy), and you will feel satisfied with the experience (for the most part, though two of the people in my little reading group were outraged over a few dangling plot points).  It doesn't need to be a five star book to give you closure on a series that has been a huge part of your life, but don't expect the same thrill of discovery and rush of adventure that were hallmarks of the series.<br /><br />Finally I want to mention that I was among the angry one-star reviewers upset about the ebook missing.  I'm a casual fan, and don't follow any of the countless blogs so I didn't see it coming, and didn't know it was the widow's decision based off of the author's wish.  In wanting to make sure her deceased husband's book found its place on the best seller list regardless of the poor way those lists handle e-books, she made the unpopular decision in order to safeguard his legacy.  I don't agree with the decision from a consumer standpoint, but I respect the decision as a human being, and so I regret that reaction and (obviously) removed that review.  I apologize to the community at large in being a part of all that vitriol and negativity.
0061801313|5.0|My daughter is in 6th grade and hooked on this series!!  she is usually not much of a reader, but won't put these down!!
B00006CXSS|5.0|A Christmas present for my boy friend. He has watched it twice already. It is a great guy gift. It is a well made movie.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This movie had many memorable lines that you can repeat with your friends over and over. I recommend watching this with a group of people so you can all laugh together. This movie reminded me a lot of the same comedy you can find in the original Bring It On. Very rememberable.
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|I really want to adore this game, just one thing keeps this from bdeing a 5 star game, and that is how he app takes enormous amounts of internal mem space. 1st gen kf do not have enough room for a 250 mb file. it starts low at approxamately 20 mb, but increases at a alarming speed. good for the person who doesnt have many games, but fpr me, i dont have room to spare
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I read this book because I try to pay attention to what my kids are reading, but I really enjoyed the story and the writing!
B000W7JWUA|5.0|My nephew loved this game! Was kind of pricey but I got my money's worth since it is a nice game and good quality. Plus was shipped fast.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I dont write reviews butttt ... This book is very well written. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time!!!
B0072KZ0Z6|5.0|It was great!! Brand new in package and I was able to re ship it to my brother in law.
1400064287|5.0|I rarely give 5 stars. This book tells you how to present your ideas so that they will be remembered. I liked this book so much because as a tutor I could start using the suggestions right away.
B0095R64AO|4.0|Predictable but worth watching. Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.
B001E9641K|5.0|Love games from this company.  They do good work and this one is another great game.  It is only for 3 players which is limiting but is still fun.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I recently discovered this adaptation of Jane Eyre.  It is very well done.  I love it, second only to the version with Timothy Dalton.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|The only regret I have about reading this book is the fact I had started it right before bed. Every time I would try to put it down, I had to pick it right back up to see what happened next. Most of Nicholas Sparks books are very predictable but this one was more than just a love story. The personality he gave each character truly left me attached to them, at one point I even felt sympathetic for the \\"bad guy\\" of the story. A really well-told and heart felt story that portrays the strength and courage it takes to truly \\"start over.\\"
B000784WMW|5.0|I have seen every adaptation of Jane Eyre on the planet. I have no idea how I missed this version. THIS IS THE BEST JANE EYRE EVER!!!  The beautiful Timothy Dalton is perfection. Bravo!!
B0059XTTW8|2.0|WARNING:  This is what happens when the dunderheads in Hollywood 'remake' perfection...<br /><br />What would be the critics' response to re-butchering The Godfather, Citizen Kane, or Casablanca?  Unfortunately...that's what we have here with Tinker, only worse.  The BBC's six hour masterpiece was inimitable, the casting a dream team of acting super-talent.  One of the best things ever put to film.<br /><br />Of course, therein lies the real problem--comparison.  As a Le Carre junkie you'll find little to appreciate after the brilliant work by Guinness, Bannen, Hepton, Richardson, Ackland, etc., and as newcomer you'll be dragged about by the cloak tails trying to figure out what the HELL is going on.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I have to give two stars to Gary O.  He stole the show, and his sincere effort/attempt at Smiley was refreshing.  The others were atrocious, instantly forgettable.  Compare to the BBC, where acting legend Guinness was my THIRD favorite in the series.<br /><br />Considering the plot's complexity the producers were either incredibly bold or incredibly stupid to try this.  You can decide, but so far the amazon ratings are pointing to the latter...
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|Has enough action, but also too much sience fiction. But enjoyable for what it is would rent again even would buy.
B00A757EFW|4.0|It's really nice to play one of the &#34;old&#34; games we used to play in the video arcade.  I do have some trouble controling pac-man on the screen.
B0052GACNM|5.0|Love Tony Bennett and this album is really really nice.  Love to have it on when doing housework, reading a book and just relaxing.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|getting to the difference levels makes you think,I can't stop playing, you won't be sorry for buying this game it is fun
B009JBWOU0|5.0|I was extremely pleased when my copy of the trilogy came in the mail. First off, all three movies are fantastic. Second, the packaging is great! On top of the three movies, you get a 64 page excerpt from &#34;The Art and Making of The Dark Knight Trilogy&#34; which I was not expecting. There is a fold out for the discs that I think is a nice package. The front of it is a holograph type affect which you can see partly from the product photo, but it looks very nice. I am a huge fan of owning packs like these for trilogies, etc. Overall I was very excited and pleased with the product. Definitely worth the money.
1592537251|5.0|Every page is inspiring me to be a better artist, and every page is amazing.  I'm very pleased to have found it and it was delivered in no time at all.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I loved this (these) books.  I was drawn in to the character's world and experienced their trials, tribulations, and triumphs.
B007SXB498|5.0|I have seen every movie version of this novel and loved each. But finallly reading it was the best yet. I love the language and the ability of Elizabeth to live right on the verge of inappropriate. I know I will read this again and again.
B0055Q5F36|5.0|I really like this case. really protect my phone for &#34;standard&#34; usage. This is an excelent protection for my phone when you are regularly using this under regular conditions. It is not so diffcult to install and it is not heavy reason why I am really like this.
B0055PGUYU|2.0|The first 20 pages were interesting. The  relationships between cues, craving and reward made me realize why we do many things. However, after the 20th page only references were mentioned about various studies and articules. This was a waste of time.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I love the visual of the bubbling battery, and all the detailed info about how long your charge will last in a number of activities. I bought the Pro because I appreciated the thought and attention to detail that went into the Free version. These guys are good. Support them!
B00AE6SS5O|3.0|There is too much dialogue. Easy to find the items though. It is a cute idea but the game is a little dull.
B008K8VDPU|4.0|This is a much better app than several others I tried. Nice response, and good quality sound. Give it a try!
0545265355|5.0|This is gift that both surprised and pleased my 20-year-old son.  He has already read book 1 and had wanted to read the other two in the trilogy.  Now he can.  I was so happy to find a gift-set of books that he was actually excited to receive!
B005P4PAVK|5.0|This is perhaps the funniest sitcom ever written. Heavy on the sexual references, so parents use judgement. Characters are superbly portrayed, and the writing is genius.
0765325950|1.0|I purchased a new e-book device late last year anticipating the release of A Memory of Light. I've been waiting 20 years to finish this story and I'm very disappointed. Looks like I will not bother to purchase this e-book even when it becomes available. I'm that mad.
B00846REIS|5.0|I fell in love with fifty shades but this one by far takes me away ! Awesome book !!! Love it .....
0316069434|3.0|Good ol' Harry... I always love to revisit a character I've followed from their debut. Sometimes I wonder what it would be like to read a Harry Bosch story that didn't include him fighting some inter-departmental battle to keep his job. Maybe there has been several like that and I'm just overlooking them right now. I really enjoy this series and I won't stop reading them but it does get a little repetitive-his constant fight to keep his job. I mean how many people can really hate a person that much to try and get him fired all the time? My mind kept wandering during the crime solving bits; I couldn't seem to get into the mystery deep enough to stay there. I did snap right to when the story circled back to Harry's daughter. I like her character and I'm curious to see where Connelly is going with her. Harry's getting up there; will Maddie be taking his place as Connelly's leading detective?
0156030306|5.0|This book is about a mentally retarded 32 year old man named Charlie Gordon who is chosen by a group of scientists for an experiment to boost his intelligence. Charlie is to keep \\"progress reports\\" as a sort of journal during and after to surgery. He tells about his life and feelings in it. At the lab he always does tests, like the Rorschach test, and mazes against a mouse named Algernon who always beats him. After the surgery, his intelligence gradually increases and he finally begins to understand things more and beats Algernon in a race. Charlie is let go from work because the co-workers are uncomfortable with the new him, Charlie becomes attracted to his teacher, Alice, and he begins to gain memories of his early life. His intelligence, still increasing, soars past the scientists who did the experiment on him. At a convention in Chicago, Charlie feels treated like a lab animal by his scientists. He then decides to study this subject on his own. At the lab, Algernon's intelligence gradually decreases and Charlie is worried it is going to happen to him. It does and his memories fade as he goes back to his old ways. He then goes to a home for retarded adults, and his last request is for there to be flowers sent to Algernon. I was very involved in the story and it is very exciting and believable. The characters are all realistic. Most of the science it seems is realistic but some definitely fake at points. I really enjoyed reading it and give it 5 stars. I got really into it and it was hard to put down. I recommend this book to anyone who has the ability to read. It's excellent!
B00005LOUP|5.0|Not as good as the original but, I do love Christmas movie and so I love this one too.  Great buy.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|i love this show!! we order it after each season goes off and the price was really great also...we recieved it on time and very quickly..no problem just as described perfect!!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I love all of the Angry bird games, but enjoy trying to get past Darth Vador to get to the next level.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I don't know why people were saying this book was boring or hard to get through, I liked it! So John snow and daenery aren't in it. This books gives u so much insight you don't even notice!
B00AJRQLTI|2.0|There are some good songs and some decent performances, but to be honest, listening to the album has made me less likely to see the movie; which is a shame - I have been looking forward to the movie for a long time. It seems that some of the key songs - namely, Master of the House and Stars - are very flat and lifeless. This is a powerful musical, and Hathaway's performance is great, and hearing Colm sing the role of the bishop was quite refreshing (long wanted to hear his take on that role). But Hollywood stars - great actors they might be - are not always the best choices to put heart and soul into a musical performance.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Great game, even the music is not annoying.  Will definitely try other titles from this company.  One of my all time favorites.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|It is my opinion of intelligent and accomplished introvert that for many people the knowledge gained from this book will be life changing.
B0047WJ11G|5.0|Inception is a great movie full of action, intrigue, and great filming. The special effects are superb and the acting is even better. I highly recommend it!
B005KJZDXK|5.0|I had trouble getting the cd in good condition(the first one arrived in many pieces) but I persisted and it was replaced! I was delighted Amazon reacted so quickly because I still had time to play the Christmas tunes which I loved!
B00846REIS|5.0|Excellent book and the second one is even better. Has similarities to 50 shades but is really quite different. Highly recommend this book!
B005LAII80|5.0|It's kind of sad to realize that this may be the only Dredd movie we will see in a while. I loved this movie. It was probably one of my favorite movies of 2012. Everything about it was great. The actors, the story, the music, the set design, etc. I really hoped that this movie would make enough to warrant a sequel, but it's probably not going to happen. Karl Urban throws it out of the park with his performance. This is quite literally the best performance I've seen from half a face in my entire life. Olivia Thrilby as Judge Anderson is a great counterpart to the grim and morose Judge Dredd. Lena Headey is brutal as Ma-Ma. What made this movie great, ultimately ended up hurting it. The dark, gritty, story line with scenes of some pretty explicit violence is what made this movie stand out. But, it also deterred movie goers from watching it. Not to mention, many people still have a bad taste in their mouth in regards to Dredd because of the previous adaptation with Sylvester Stallone. That movie was embarrassing and campy. This movie was anything but.<br /><br />One could also make the argument that movie goers are expecting a certain type of movie when it's based on a comic book. I personally also loved The Avengers, but I recognize that that movie is pretty much a fluffy joyride when compared to Dredd. Dredd is a proper action movie, with action scenes that have tangible consequences. People die, sometime in gruesome ways. In The Avengers, we see only one character explicitly die with blood, and even then it's a little dribble. Dredd is the anti-comic book movie. And I really appreciated that.<br /><br />I hope that this movie makes enough money in home video sales to justify a sequel, because that would be great.
B004AHW8MW|3.0|Purchased to replace a lost book.  Story is fantastic but was disappointed that it was not clear that the book was a withdrawal from a library.<br />Got an email stating that shipping may take longer than expected.  I sent a reply asking if I should print a dummy cover and never got an answer....came in a nick of time.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I downloaded this on the Kindle Fire HD 7 and love the clarity of the screen for reading for a long period of time. There is no glare, I love it,.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game to ever play. It destroys any attempt to word Temple Run is the best strategy game. 1,000 stars. Kiloo and Sybo's best game yet.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|The first person narrator of this novel takes on the subject of what all parents fear - what if my child turns out to be a killer? Very moving without being maudlin. Also tackles the subject of what the trauma does to a marriage.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|Not persuaded or anything, I just decided to tell how great this game is. Graphics make me smile and the different animal combinations keep it interesting. Not hard to grasp and its easily for all ages :)
B004U52VPS|5.0|What you see is what you get.  Little cards are provided to illustrate building options/challenges, so I guess you could say it's the next generation of Lincoln Logs.  Purchased for a 12-year-old boy and he liked it a lot, had fun building and then destroying.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|You feel like you are either part of the household or part of the staff. Wonderfully done with an amazing cast.

B007KCG7MQ|5.0|Joe walsh an Analog Man is the best Album/CD Joe has ever made. I have many friends who no Joe and they say when he is introduced on stage at the Eagle Concerts Joe gets the loudest and  longest applauses of all of them put together. I think when you are the best at what you do it's easy to see why. Joe Walsh is on target on this Album/CD. Enough said get it, listen to it, and enjoy it. Thanks Joe...
B0083Z614S|4.0|Normally I read the book before seeing the movie, but in this case it was different since my first viewing with Dean Stockwell as Colin.  As always the screenwriters didn't feel the book flowed enough to make a good movie, but in this case they were wrong. Although both movie versions were good as well as enjoyable, the choice of the screen writer to overplay the \\"mystery of magic\\" instead of allowing the flow of the beauty of magic to be explored.  I highly recommend this fascinating and colorful journey into the recovery of madness by way of the healing beauty of nature.
B0000640VO|5.0|This was thoroughly entertaining.  We just love Audrey Tautou and this movie is certainly a great one to showcase her talents.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I am just completely and utterly addicted to this show! Trying to play catch up so I can start watching the new season!
B001PPGAIA|5.0|This was not what I was expecting, but it was an interesting movie nonetheless.  Not sure if I would watch it again, but was glad to see it once.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is so much fun and a challenge of where to drop the coin. It's just like the large coin machines in arcades on the boardwalk!
B0091REZMW|4.0|So far so good. I haven't had any problems and have Bern able to play until I'm tired of playing
B00A757EFW|5.0|This is the best game that mankind could have ever came up with. It's just that amazing. I would recommend this game to everyone who loves classic games that have been out for a long time ;)!!!!
B0091REZMW|3.0|...so progress is s l o w going. I play until my energy is gone. The next day there is always a notification that my energy has been restored. I do enjoy this game. If you are impatient and/or  unwilling to spend - then this is not for you. I do not fb or invite &quot;friends&quot;. I am on lvl 10 &amp; have 5 rooms to explore....so far...
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|I quit watching about half way through.  Not my kind of humor, not funny or clever to me.  It might be funny to &#34;Family Guy&#34; fans.
B00AMBM9MO|2.0|Definitely NOT a family movie. Could have been a better movie without all the \\"F\\" bombs. It said in the ratings that it had crude humor, just wasn't expecting it to be that crude.
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|I think that this was a good book because it was well written and funny.<br /> I HOPE YOU AGREE TOO
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|On the first listening it is obvious that you are not listening to Colm Wilkinson, Michael Ball, or Lea Salonga.  This lead to an initial disappointment.  On my second listening, I became a fan!
0446572993|3.0|I have read all of David Baldacci's books and he's one of my very favorite authors.  I have to admit that I was disappointed in The Innocent though.  Just not as good as I had expected!
141659521X|5.0|Another fast paced & action packed book about Mitch Rapp, the bad ass black-op who serves at the pleasure of the POTUS.
B008J34466|5.0|Pink does it again, she is so very talented,<br />All of these songs have meaning to live by<br />listen again and again
B005723JSQ|3.0|I've read all of Sophie Kinsellas books and short stories and this is not my favorite.  It felt like it dragged on and wasn't as witty as her other work.
B006GWO5NE|2.0|everytime our battery gets low , we charge our kindle but the kindle has a hard time charging.  this is the second kindle and 2nd chatger and its a pain, the kindle just doesnt charge right
B0013N3DSE|5.0|I was Amazed how well they did this .. looks awesome on Blu Ray!<br />I had been looking for this for my hubby.. was so tickled to fine it here<br />Thanks For Having It!!
B008FIATBE|5.0|Chris Brown never fails me. This album has it all. Club bangers, babymaking music, and of course love songs. I've been his fan from day one. You wont be dissapointed
B005LAIHZY|5.0|This was so cute.. she had wanted it... so of course I bought it for her lol<br />Was very good!<br />She LOVED it!
B0047Y17P2|5.0|This book has lots of creative plot twists and an excellent surprise ending. Don't want to be a spoiler but I think Connelly is letting in more light for all of his characters.
B0091REZMW|5.0|hard to make friends and earn diamonds but love it any how. I am starting to get the hang of this game just learning how to play it better
0743277465|5.0|Well written, careful development of the basics and then a dramatic telling of the application.  Shows general applicability of learning fundamentals.
158270208X|5.0|I bought the Kindle version of Rhonda Byrne's &#34;The Magic&#34;. It really infused me with enthusiasm to really look at me and practice living with Gratitude consciously....so much so that I ordered 2 copies.....to use, mark, crease, and give 1 to a daughter, who is also living gratefully because of lessons learned from trials. I've always grown thru journaling....and HAD to get this.
B009MCRHH6|4.0|My four year old loves this game and I find it fun too.  only six more words before it will let me stop typing and save this review.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I read this as part of a book club. I wasn't sure what to expect at first but was very moved by what I took in. This book made me look at the life moving around me and stop and take a moment for myself.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|I had never seen the movie in color.  It makes me never want to watch the movie again as black and white.
B001NLN07K|4.0|I love this movie.  It seems to get such a bad rap and I don't understand why.  Colin Farrell was excellent as Sonny.  Jamie Foxx should have been replaced by Terence Howard, but he was adequate. Great way to kill a couple hours!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love it. When using your kindle you can can take your pins on the go. I use it for craft projects.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I truly enjoyed reading this book. It's well written and shows another side of Nazi Germany through the eyes of honorable Luftwaffe pilots who loved their country but also charished life. \\"You score victories, not kills.\\"<br />Brian
B0063IH60K|5.0|it is easy to load and play. very addicting because it is so easy.  i would recomment it to anyone.
B00846REIS|5.0|Great book I couldn't put it down!! Can't wait to start the other books. Needed something to read since I finished 50 shades
B000AMJC2K|4.0|The Ergotron Neo-Flex LCD monitor arm is a great product so far with only one small issue.<br /><br />The arm installs pretty easily. You can install it with the included clamp mount or with the also included grommet mount. If your desk allows you to use the clamp mount you probably want to go that route as it's quicker and easier. The grommet mount requires removing the clamp from the base, drilling a 1/4\\" hole and then attaching the mount to the desk with the nut and washer plate that are also included.<br /><br />The arm has all of the advertised movement capabilities and the adjustments are pretty simple to make. However, the included instructions DO NOT describe how toe raise the height of the arm. The main arm has two large discs which look like they should allow the arm to raise and lower. The trick is that one side of these discs is a button. Press this button while slightly raising the arm and it will raise and lower up to eight inches as advertised.<br /><br />Once again, there is no mention of how to do this in the instructions which are really just a series of pictures. The size of the bolt for the grommet mount isn't described, either. Finding that was a matter of trial and error.<br /><br />In all I would recommend this mount to anyone looking for an inexpensive mount for a monitor.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This is a neat game I found by chance. The only issue I have is when I have exhausted all my coins and having to pay for a readily increase. Still worth the download.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie and my kids were all into to it, i recomend this for the whole family!
B009GEBBNQ|2.0|I am a huge Joss Whedon fan, a huge comic book nerd and a huge fan of the superhero, and especially Marvel superhero, in general.  So this movie was a HUGE letdown.  Nothing really happens.  The villain isn't even that villain-y.  Iron Man has a few good lines, but overall I was left wondering why there was such hype surrounding this movie.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|i really thought it was going to be garbage but Jeremy was really good on this movie..once again good Job Jeremy!!!
B0001IN0DA|5.0|I bought this DVD as a gift for my boyfriend. He loves WWE and has enjoyed the dvd. It was shipped fast.
1591843162|3.0|The quality of the used book itself was excellent, but the book made the same point over and over again.  It was too long for the message it was trying to deliver.  I was required to read it for work, but otherwise would have put it down after the first chapter or two
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This show should run forever. It's so unique and the possibilities are endless when you feature a new ghost story each season. In the beginning, I was disappointed that the original story had ended, but after the first episode of season two, I realized that this was an ingenious plan. The fact that a single story is stretched out over a season allows for superb storytelling and character development. I'd be heartbroken and utterly confused if this one gets canned.
0765325950|5.0|I've been reading this series for half of my life, alternating between exciting action and disappointing and wandering tomes. Ultimately, Robert Jordan was proven to have planned many details from the very beginning. Watching the arc plots of characters like Demondred culminate was intensely satisfying!<br /><br />Well done, and also credit to Brandon Sanderson for picking up the pace in the final three books.
B005PK553C|5.0|When the Walking Dead S3 took a break in the middle of the season, I discovered this gem. This idea is perfect- every season, there's a new story. Everything about this show appeals to me, especially since most horror has become annoying and overdone. It's my favorite genre, yet typically I'm disappointed with the b-level dialogue and unnecessary nudity, etc. People who are offended by some of the references and likenesses need to stick to watching their animated bible series instead and let the grown-ups enjoy this one.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The first book was better!  It's very repetitive. It ends in a way that it makes you want to buy the last book anyway.
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|I read this to my kids many years back, but couldn't remember the story, just that we had enjoyed it.  So I ordered it again and loved it all over again.
B000FA5TTW|5.0|Great book!  Creeps you out.  I still need to see the movie.  Couldn't put this book down until I finished it!
B008XG1X18|5.0|What a great way to store ideas even if I never get around to all of them.  Even though we live far apart, my daughters and I share fashion, recipes, art, etc  It's like going shopping together.  What fun.
B00AMBM9MO|3.0|I watched this movie because my wife wanted to watch something funny, and we both heard good things about this movie. But, everyone has a different sense of humor, and I didn't find the movie all that funny. Maybe if you like Will Ferrel movies this will make you laugh non-stop, but for me the laughs were pretty far between. I actually got the biggest laughs from the movie using other movies' soundtracks in important moments.
B00632HWOG|4.0|Nice to access my e-mail from my Kindle.  Sometimes it is too small to work with but that's not Yahoo's fault.
B005KELW26|5.0|Its exactly what you think it would be. Only downfall is it doesnt have protection around the corners, so if you drop it and it lands on a corner, you might be in trouble.
B005I4JG80|5.0|Very good read. It is so interesting to hear what it is like to raise a child in France. I would recommend it.
0765325950|2.0|This is going to be a really strange review, because I realized yesterday that.... I was never going to like this book, and there are probably a number of readers that feel the same way. The truth is, that by book ten, the author had written a check that he couldn't cash for his readers. There were too many loose threads, there were too many characters that needed satisfying conclusions, there were too many corners of this interesting world still left to the readers' imaginations. Even if this book had come with its own library cart, I don't know that Robert Jordan himself could have written enough plot-important events in the last three books to give the readers a feeling of satisfaction for the bulk of the unanswered questions. I think it's fine that we leave the series with some of our curiosities still unsatisfied, but there are so many stories that got started early in the series and were left, never picked up again, never made important and that makes the whole exercise of reading this far seem very futile.<br /><br />I don't really feel like any Last Battle was going to be big enough, flashy enough, epic enough to end this series at this time. More questions needed to be answered going into this book than had been answered. I know that Brandon Sanderson was trying desperately to not make anything up and only go on Jordan's notes, and that was probably some of the trouble. He didn't know things that Jordan did, and so he couldn't include them. It leaves this series.... wanting. Actually, the whole thing can be compared to listening to a very interesting story that is told by someone that is slowly getting drunk. It starts off very interesting, it sucks you in, and you pour the storyteller another beer. Then it starts getting a little tangental, but it's interesting still, and you pour the storyteller another beer. The story grows interesting, but there are so many little nuggets, so many little things the storyteller swears he'll get back to, that you buy himanother beer, since he asked you nicely. Pretty soon, you don't know where the story is going, you're a little confused, but there are glimmers of finding out how it ends. The storyteller buys himself another beer, and before he shambles home, he sums up the end after a mighty last draw on the beer. And you never see him again to find out -- wait what about the....?<br /><br />I should have realized that this was a problem years ago, but for some reason, I just didn't. But I know now; I was never going to like this book. And I think for anyone reading just for the sake of an end (I know some folks like that) that this book is not going to satisfy them either. There is no payoff for 15, 20, 23 years of grinning and bearing it. Maybe if I had come into the series a few years ago, and this book is not long-awaited and yet never coming, I could swallow it as a capstone to this series, but as someone that's been in this for the long haul, it's laughable to think that this book was going to end the series with a satisfying conclusion.

B00ABGEFWC|4.0|If you like animal games then you will like Lee this on one. It has fun cute animals and you can play it almost continued n poo husky until you get bored.
B004MARLJ2|5.0|As a fan of Hexage's works and after playing \\"Robotek\\", \\"Totemo\\", \\"Evac\\", and \\"Radiant Defense\\" by them, I sought out their older works. I'm very glad I did.<br /><br />Everlands at first glance looks like a game for a five-year-old with its almost childish and simple art style, but after playing through Everlands myself I must say that even the most veteran gamers will soon find themselves \\"overtaken by the darkness\\" at first. For a five-year-old to beat this particular game, they must be the next Albert Einstein. I was determined to play this game since I love Hexage's art style, music, and gameplay on all their games, so for those who go past the surface appearances I think they will discover the masterpiece in this game. In one sense, the art style is very fitting, and I will cover a few categories in giving this game an honest review.<br /><br />Story & Basis -<br />In Everlands, you guide the creatures of the Everlands to defeat the darkness and save the world! It may sound cliche, but this game is very linear in that sense and you can avoid the story of Everlands entirely since you will only encounter it by tapping on each level's description to scroll. The basis of the game is good versus evil, and unfortunately in this case the Everlands' creatures are subjected to it.<br /><br />Graphics -<br />As I said earlier, the art style at first glance can offset potential buyers, but it shouldn't really. The simplistic design and incredible background design, although partially childish, really enhance the strategy behind the game. Hexage has a record for beautiful games with neon oriented colors, and Everlands boasts this is a much more subtle way. Each of the levels has unique background art, and they are all well made.<br /><br />Music -<br />Signature to Hexage's games, Everlands boasts a unique techno soundtrack that is lighthearted and fits the playful mood of the game!<br /><br />Gameplay & Value -<br />All tiles are hexes that have various abilities, that can only attack on their \\"attack sides\\" shown with yellow arrows. Each tile is a Everlands creature, which are basically regular animals such as bear, frog, and rhino. These tiles all have special abilities based around their actual persona, and as you progress through the story you add to your arsenal of tiles as you convert other Everlands creatures. Your goal is to conquer at least 50% of each level's board, which consists of various arrangement of hex tiles, and the games boasts 20 levels. At first glance, this may seem ridiculously short, but each player will most likely lose each level a few times before beating (or it might just be me...).  Replay value is fairly high as you can aim to conquer more percentage of each level's board, and this adds to the game's length. Since the game is only $1.99 anyway, it's a great deal.<br /><br />Conclusion -<br />This game is VERY much a strategy game, and it has a interesting art style that is something that I've personally never seen before. It takes some getting used to, but if you are willing to try a new type of strategy game and go into with an open mind, you should come to love it. Getting used to each tile and strategies using multiple tiles helps each player formulate their own strategies, and it truly is a game where you can play however you like. It lets you decide how to proceed in each level without giving you much of guidance, although one wrong move can cost you the level in some cases.<br /><br />The outcome of Everlands? Yet another beautiful game by Hexage.
B009KUANWG|5.0|I love Adele's voice and style.  I like the orchestration and drama in this piece of music.  It sounds like a classic soundtrack song.

1401201911|5.0|Twisted versions of all your favorite DC characters in an epic story that will change the way you see them forever.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless by Colleen Hoover is a book that I wished would've been based on true events, just because I want Holder and Sky to be REAL. Their story will make any breathing human being weep, laugh, hurt, and dream.<br /><br />Sky is one of the bravest female leads ever created. Holder right now is in the fight with Noah Hutchins from \\"Pushing The Limits\\" for the title of the most amazing brother, boyfriend and friend. Six, Sky's best friend, it's the best friend that every girl deserves to have.<br /><br />The whole story will captivate your heart to the point that I can assure, by the end of the last chapter, your perspective about love, friendship and relationships will never be the same.<br /><br />Prepare yourself to be blown away...

B000W9399S|5.0|I love the Discworld novels.  I've only read a few of them, but now I'm starting from the beginning and I'm going to try to read them all.  I would definitely recommend this author to anyone.
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|We received Seasons 1 and 2 for Christmas. Best gift ever. Now we have already purchased 3 and 4 and watched all of them..Bring on Season 5.
B007THA4FI|1.0|J.K. wrote a flat boring book. I was very disappointed. The beauty and success of her Harry Potter series was the vividness of description, the pace, and excitment generated by the suspense created. In this book she seemed to be trying to develop characters with deeper psychological issues, but  she failed to communicate these issues clearly, nor did she show any change and development in the characters. It needed more intellectual depth.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|This was a Christmas gift. We watched it 2 nights, then season 2. We bought seasons 3 & 4 and have watched all them. Waiting on Season 5. This is now our favorite tv show and wonder how we could have missed it for so long. Bring on Season 5.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I have already read this book but each time I read it I can't help myself from crying when prim dies:( ;-; best book ever
B002VECMAO|5.0|The fact that this is based on a true story makes it funnier. Great cast, hysterical scenes and a different movie for comedy fans.
0765325950|5.0|Jordan's work is a masterpiece. Those who insist on the last book on a Kindle probably also read their Bible on the Kindle - very lame.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I loved this book series so much that I read it 3 times I hope that you will read this book series and if you do you will realize how amazing it is

B0041D843M|3.0|Ok, I admit it.  I have Attention Deficit Disorder and this book was entirely to much for me to get through. All I need is someone to say &#34;If your problem is *this* then you should be cutting *this* out of your diet and adding *this* to it, and this is why.&#34;  I realize that most people want to research the heck out of everything they are doing or what they are going to do but I'm not one of them.  If you are like me and just want to be given the basics then avoid this book at all costs.  If you are the type of person that needs to know every little detail of the science behind all of the foods you are recommended to eat, this is the book for you.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this story. I read this book in one sitting. It was sad, but it was also very good. Must read!!!
B0025KW29U|5.0|How can one explain the brillaince of this movie? The &#34;evil&#34; villian that you root for and the &#34;hero&#34; played to perfection by Nathan Fillion. The only possible knock on it was that is was too short. If you liked the musical from Buffy, you'll like the songs in this as they are very similar.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Not head banging difficult but just the right amount of challenge for thinking outside the box. Great way to kill time waiting in line.
B004JMSIRC|4.0|Enjoyable, mostly light-hearted superhero movie with great action. Some material not suitable for young children, better for older kids and adults
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I love the story and what it can teach kids. I think this would be a perfect book for parents and kids to read together.
B0070NSPCU|4.0|The book was written with the idea that the main character was narrating his adventures to a scribe, my only quibble with that choice is that he soon makes it clear that he doesn't tell the scribe all the thing that you are reading. Great world building, magic set-up. Looking forward to more adventures in this world.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this story from the first page it's is brilliantly written and on put downable it's happy and sad and every emotion you can think of loved it

Bad form for any loser no matter what excuse, but its all off your chest now so your children and there childre will judge you.. I still think Lydia Chriss has the best Kiss book going round
B003O86FMW|5.0|Awesome!<br /><br />I liked this one more than the first one! Lots of action with twists and surprises. Can't wait for the last book!
B000W01GK6|4.0|I had this CD before but it is stuck in my car changer.  Since I liked it I ordered it again.  Just waiting for it to arrivee.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|It was just an okay book.  The end was expected was expecting a twist but none developed some parts were good and kept your interest.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|Bought this for a family member...ended up watching it. Very good film! Not as good as the book, but followed story line closely!
B00AFEY354|5.0|Since other reviews have already gone in depth about the film, I'll keep mine short and sweet. I thoroughly enjoyed The Perks of Being a Wallflower. I'm almost always skeptical when books are turned into movies since it seems like important things are either omitted or changed, but not with this movie. Stephen Chbosky worked on this movie, so I think that's why it stayed so true to the book and captured the essence of the story. \\"Perks\\" exceeded my expectations, and I'm preordering the DVD as I must have this in my collection. Definitely watch it because if you liked the book, then you'll most likely enjoy the movie. If you didn't read the book, then you'll also most likely enjoy this movie.
B002YOKVU4|5.0|One of the funnest movies I've ever seen. Johnny Depp should have won an Oscar. Again not for everyone but very funny.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I think this is a really good book - great mystery but loaded with all kinds of stuff - very different plot.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This book started put kind of slow, but once it got going, there was no stopping it.  I really liked the chapters as dates.  Helped bring everything into a better timed focus.  This book had me on the verge of tears several times, maybe even releasing one or two with Sky.  A must read for all. Very touching story.
B006WXHJNU|5.0|The film came in on the dot, described just as is, excellent condition not a scratch on the back of the DVD.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I recommend this book to anyone who needs an extra spark in their marriage! For the older crowd- Anyone 30 and younger and experienced, may not think it's anything new
B000VUDSH6|5.0|The movie came in a couple of days earlier. I would really like to buy more movies from you guys.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|Best book ever. I would recommend this book to Egyptian readers or lovers.<br />I love the hieroglyphics in the book
B0055PMJMW|4.0|I've enjoyed all of Connelly's 'Harry Bosch' books and have tried to read them in order whenever possible.  These short stories add to the timeline built within the books and fill out the character of Harry Bosch even more, while entertaining with interesting stories.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|These games start out kind of slow but they go on the games get better and harder. I can spend hours playing from one game to the next and never get bored because it's never the same game twice.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and found it was hard to put down.  It involved the murder of a 14 year old boy, with another 14 year old, Jacob, charged in the case.  Jacob's father was an assistant D.A. who had to step down when his son became the suspect.  The plot involved lots of twists and turns that weren't always what they seemed to be. I became very involved with the family, some secrets in the father's background and how they were all dealing with the situation. It left me wondering right up to the end.  A well-written book I would highly recommend.
B003K16P3M|4.0|I chose this rating because the book deserves it and I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a good read. There wasn't anything I disliked about the book so...
B002WY65VU|4.0|this film is so gooda and funny and also kinda scary but why zombies are running so fast in this film?!:D anyway fun movie
1451695195|2.0|There's nothing worth reading in it for those who already believe in God.  He may be convinced that there's a heaven.  Big deal - you'd better believe more than that.  It is written for his unbelieving, scientific friends/co-workers.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|This album is so good and also the band. i wonder why this album and also It's Time didn't nominated for any Grammys this year. maybe next year.
1470807874|5.0|She's back to her &#34;original&#34; writing style!  This book focuses on Ivan, (and Byerly!) and their mis-adventures.  Great one-liners, and comedic situations.  I was disappointed with CryoBurn, but this book is right on track.  Events take place prior to CryoBurn.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Each season takes place in a different environment and captures the good, evil, and everything inbetween inherent in human nature. Overall, this is a fun show if not addicting.
1451696191|1.0|Granted, I did not finish the book, I only read the first 40 odd pages, but it is not appropriate for young adults. I was uncomfortable reading parts of it & I'm an adult. Too much sex, drugs & adult discussion for that age group. I would not recommend this book to anyone, I burnt it in my fireplace.
B0073RSVMC|5.0|My son loves this dinosaur. Very cool looking, would recommend. Fits in well with the Papo dinosaurs he already had.
1423151054|5.0|Hubby and I (both animators) have had this preordered FOREVER. Today, it finally arrived, and I can tell you that the wait was WORTH IT! This is an incredible set for the true fan, especially if you own any of the other Archive Series books. The quality of the print and binding is exceptional, the books are easy to flip (vital but somehow often overlooked in most flipbooks).<br /><br />Most importantly, the selections are fantastic: some of the animation featured is very famous, like the Lady and the Tramp spaghetti scene, but other scenes are ones you might overlook in the films: the T-Rex versus Stegosaur fight from Fantasia, for instance. Best of all, Pete Docter has selected scenes that demonstrate the unique style of each individual animator, so that even without seeing the name, an avid fan can recognize Milt Kahl's hands, Ward Kimball's faces, Ollie Johnston's pliant cheeks, or a dainty Marc Davis lady.<br /><br />It's hard to say what the real gem in this set is, but there's bound to be something to please everyone! I give this the highest recommendation possible to any Disney animation student or fan!<br /><br />**Edit: As other reviewers have mentioned, there are a few pages that have printing errors (blurry, low-resolution). While this is disappointing and I hope they correct it in future printings, I did not find that this ruined the product for me.**
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I feel in love with this book. The emotional suspense kept me on the edge of my seat and it was nearly impossible for me to put the book down. There was so much detail of emotion that I literally felt what each character was feeling. The description of the healing process was accurate and  believable. Hopeless is a must read for anyone who enjoys books that contain raw emotion. This is one of the few books that I will read again one day. I will definitely recommend this book to my family and friends.
0307719774|5.0|Love this Journal and I can't wait to look back and see how my answers change from year to year. Such a great idea!!
B004GVUPFE|5.0|It brings back memories when I was a kid. I use to play this when I was little. It for sure makes your brain think and that's what makes it fun. You got to think how to move the pieces to get to the box.
B008673ZAQ|2.0|It was not what I thought it would be. But since I didn't read it, I guess it had to be
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|My 4 year old loves this game and she is awesome at it too. She plays with it every day or almost every day.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Very well written. Had my one lazy day so I stated reading and could not put it down. Finished this book in one day.
B005HSL626|5.0|I got this game because my 4 year old loves it. She plays it on Kindle Fire, cell phone and on the Wii. She loves this game and I play it too sometimes.
B007CI81IQ|4.0|It is certainly an excellent reference in literature about poverty through an economic view that every student and policy maker should consult. Is has relevant data and makes good critic upon some general statements that economics has sustain when considering how poverty is created and maintained.<br /><br />It has a excellent bibliography and a lot of references to studies and policies around the world.<br /><br />I disliked the absence of references to other disciplines, as it usually happens to economists, and the exaggerated seek of strong data and evaluations ... the positivist approach to the themes it intends to clarify.
B00992CF6W|4.0|The game is fun but I wish in survival mode that you get to fly and fight deadly creatures in creative mode. But no all you do is fly around with no lives in the game
B00936A0RU|5.0|I thought this movie was going to be just another western action flick, but OMG was I wrong. The story was very interesting and actually held my attention for whet the theme was. The characters are what I think made it, just a great cast for sure. There was this storytelling aspect of it that just made you relate with the characters and enough conflict to make ones head spin, it wasn't all blood and guts drama to, although there's plenty of that. There's little love stories that are sweet and some comedy, which makes it fun.  Very well done.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|this game is dumb and boring and wastes your brain space dont get it or be a zombie and waste your life being a stinking coin dozer addict
B0068THAGY|5.0|Love this movie. I just felt like everything was perfect, I wouldn't have done anything differently. Speilberg's my hero. well executed. Great plot and subplot. Great characters, story told form a kids point of view, and these kids are just very likable characters. This is clean for kids for sure, but it might just scare those that scare easily. Great adventure film for kids, I think. But the nice thing is that it's awesome for adults as well. The effects were real like and awe inspiring. Great job. On my buy list.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|The music is great! I love it actually more than I did the movie. The only downside is that it does not include the whole soundtrack. But it is hard to put in all the 49 tracks that are in the movie and that is how it is advertised so I can't complain.<br /><br />One note is that on some of the songs if turned up... probably a little too loud, it is very taxing for some sound systems at a few points but it is just the pure awesomeness of the music. I just play it in my car cause that one will handle it!
B005LAIGPA|5.0|There are very few movies that I actually buy or even watch twice. This was one that I added on my buy list and watched three times. I loved the raw feel to it, which normally I don't, but I felt like it added so much raw emotion to it. It made the story seem so real, even though it is a make believe concept, I felt like it actually happened. I loved the effects and how life like they seemed for the setting, it was a primitive film with futuristic plot lines and that was refreshing. The actors were very good, this protagonist in this film also shows up in the movie Lawless which is another on my buy list. Very good job.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I would be up for hours at just keep reading this awesome book can't wait to get the last one!!
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|This movie was awesome! It was so much deeper than I had expected. I was thinking it was just going to be action packed, non-plot oriented, but there ended up being a few underlying plots that were really deep and stirred up serious emotion. I cried at the end, and I loved how I almost didn't know whose side to be on till the very end. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is growing as an A-list actor for sure.
B002RI9PHW|4.0|I speed through this book quicker than most books I have read recently as it kept me interested, I quite liked the way it was formatted through emails & conversation a nice change.<br />I kept wanting to skip to the end to find out what was going to happen.<br /><br />Thanks
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Love the game sounds graphics etc. Every time Robio loads their news page it fails to start the game! Can't figure out how to prevent this. I do not have this problem with their free games ...
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I thought this book was GREAT ! I gave it five stars because it is funny for all kids like me . I wold so recommend it for children !!
B009MCRHH6|5.0|A great puzzler with excellent artwork / graphics. I have this on xbox but I like the touch controls on my tablet even better. Well worth it!
B003O86FMW|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  I'm a Twilight fan, and was expecting it to be a little different than it was.  It honestly was a bit more graphic than I thought it would be.  I can see if you like Twilight than you'd like these books.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I love this game! It is an excellent little puzzler with cute graphics and simple game play. Works and plays very well with my asus transformer tablet. Highly recommended!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  I'm a Twilight fan, and was expecting it to be a little different than it was.  It honestly was a bit more graphic than I thought it would be.  I can see if you like Twilight than you'd like these books.
B008L1DNGI|4.0|This is a pretty cute puzzle game. The puzzles are easy to moderately challenging. Artwork and animations are amusing. Works well on my asus transformer. A solid &#34;recommend&#34;.<br />.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  I'm a Twilight fan, and was expecting it to be a little different than it was.  It honestly was a bit more graphic than I thought it would be.  I can see if you like Twilight than you'd like these books.
B0085Z3B2Q|5.0|I had never even read the book before this and I loved it. We bought for our daughter who is 3 and she loves it too. The movie came quick and there were no issues with the packaging. Great great movie
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I played this game millions times.and it's so addicting but my kindle will not download it.I am getting so mad
0439023513|3.0|The third book in the Hunger Games trilogy.  I was really looking forward to reading this to find out what happened in the war between The Capitol and The Rebels and ultimately what happens to Katniss Everdene.<br /><br />I was quite disappointed in the whole book.  It started off well and was very descriptive but I started to worry when I was more than half way through the book and there was still such a lot of ongoing stories to conclude.  I was worried that there was just not enough time left in the book to do so effectively and I was right.  Everything just felt a bit rushed towards the end and most of the stories were concluded by just killing off the person in various manners.<br /><br />There were many parts that I felt could have been cut out and other parts that needed to be expanded on.  A prime example of where an author has a brilliant idea for a story but gets lost in the story and doesn't quite know how to bring it all to an end,<br /><br />I am glad that the ending wasn't the predictable, happy ever after ending that I felt it was going to be apart from one aspect of it.<br /><br />Obviously, you are going to read it if you have read the first two books but do it quickly rather than savouring the wait so that you get it over with and minimise your disappointment.<br /><br />It should make for an interesting movie, though, and I will be interested to see how much, if any, of it they change.  3 out of 5.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|This might even be the best book I have read.  I have now downloaded another book by this author to try.
B007SGLZP8|1.0|John Grisham must have phoned this in. I have enjoyed his other books--some are clearly better than others. The original premise of The Racketeer is good, and I found the first few chapters engaging. But then it just spiraled into a big mess, and I found myself not caring about the protagonist very much at all. The only reason I finished the book was because I was on a cruise and didn't have anything else to read!
B00A77II0U|5.0|This turned out to be a collector's edition. Very close to the PC game. Incredible graphics. I love this game. Kudos to Alawar!
B0058YPG1G|5.0|With the knowledge that Breaking Bad is a five-act (season) play, we get to see more of Walt's fall into the downside.  How far will he go?  Who will he bring down?  How much trouble will he cause.  This is definitely a transformation season for both Walt and Jessie.  This show will make you sit down on your couch and only get up to change out the DVDs.  Sit back and enjoy.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|As soon as I'm done writing this review, I'm going to see if this author has published anything else. I couldn't put it down1
B0081336FO|5.0|This is probably one of the best shows on the TV around the world, period.<br />The Season 2 has three completely different tales - a very confounding espionage, a horror movie, and a true game of personal destruction. It was so great to see the Werewolf from Being Human as a man obsessed with the Hound. My only wish would be that Martin Freeman's Dr. Watson get more prominent part as he did in the series opener.
0547482655|5.0|I was so blown away when I opened up this book. They did an amazing job of turning this already wonderful book into something even more special. I loved this book so much that I bought both English and French editions of it so I could give as gifts for Christmas. Worth the money and highly recommended!
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|Kind of wordy, got lost in the minutiae.  I'm really glad she came out well on the other side, but I'd rather see her live than read her books.  She's too good on stage to waste herself on the printed word.
B00555X8OA|5.0|My son has the book and when he read me a few passages, I had to get it -- which I did to read on my android devices.  It is simply fascinating, the vast array of research that has been assembled on how we think and make decisions.  I am a retired lawyer who wishes I had this book to read 40 years ago.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is a wonderful share network. It is such a great concept, very helpful and informative. I love it and find it very addicting
B007J4T2G8|4.0|this book is addicting. i never wanted to stop reading. however, i did notice alot of similarities to twilight, her desribing words get boring because she overuses them, and it slightly irritates me that there is no real purpose besides sex.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|awesome game cant get any better. like for real.so much to do in this game it never gets boring. yes
B001KQZ7I8|5.0|Every student of psychology should read this at least once.  Victor Frankl's story portrays the importance of putting meaning into your life.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Very easy to use, color of battery in app can change if you choose to. Very informative app, has different screens for time left, usage graph etc... Well worth the money. Fair price for a really cool app!!
B004H1V5RU|5.0|My son was given the Epic Perplexus for his birthday, and it's a lot of fun for both kids and adults.  My son just turned 7 and honestly the Epic version is a little more difficult than he really likes but he still has fun with it, and best of all, he also received the Original from someone else and decided to keep both.  The Original is much better suited for his age.  He has very good math/puzzle skills and is a good technical thinker but the Epic requires a very sensitive touch and finesse in many spots, which makes it more difficult for smaller kids.  Also, having both, the Original seems a bit more solidly built than the Epic.  The clear plastic of the sphere seems thicker and stronger and there are obviously more fragile pieces inside the Epic.  We haven't had any problems with either and they're holding up fine, but if one were to get dropped, I think the Original is more likely to survive without any breakage.  Anyway, lots of fun.  As an adult it didn't take me long to buzz through the original but the Epic poses a considerably larger challenge.  Very addictive and fun.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|This is most certain a timeless masterpiece in which Jane Austen achieved perfection. Pride and Prejudice is a reading bliss with its unique and beloved plot. The unsuspected decisions and changes of plot keep you on your toes wishing for more. The description and personalities of the characters is extraordinary and you feel yourself intrigued within the story, and falling in love with Mr. Darcy alongside Elizabeth. The end is perfect in every way possible, but you can't help yourself wishing for it not to end though. Her vocabulary and formality may at times be more difficult but it makes it all the more interesting. It's a timeless classic which I love and adore, and never tire of no matter how many times I read it! ~A.C.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This Solitaire game is superior to others I've played because it allows an automatic finish once you've established<br />a win.  The graphics are great and it's very intuitive.
B00A1U2SVS|5.0|HUGE ZEPPELIN FAN HERE. I love this album. Now I would have liked them to change a song or 2 on this album but that's just me.I'm sure there are fans out there who love every cut on this album.Bottom line, it's live Led Zeppelin and that's a good thing as far as I'm concerned.
B006LS7DQE|4.0|I like this game.  It's only crashed one or two times and that is after I had been playing it for a long time.  I have played Puzzle Quest in the past on the Wii.  This interface is just as good.  I would recommend it.
B000FBJAEG|4.0|Now I've read all of Baldacci's King and Maxwell series...Always wondered how they hooked up.  After reading most of his books, more or less in order, reading this early work for the first time now makes me realize how much he has grown  and improved as a writer.  This story is a bit contrived and &#34;forced&#34;, but a great read - mainly because this recurring duo is such a likable pair.<br />As always, I was sorry to have the story end.
B0086700CM|4.0|like the description said very fun that is what I think but it is REALLY slow if you have more than 15 apps don't let a little kid play. It game is a little evil and scary
B007PVHAN2|5.0|BOB MARLEY ON BLUE RAY IS AMAZING! GREAT QUALITY. I ENJOYED THE MOVIE AND THE GREAT MUSIC FROM THIS LEGEND.

B009UX2YAC|1.0|am I the only one who dissent enjoy this game?...  Well different people enjoy different things..sorry just not my type of game I prefer Temple Run and or Temple Run Brave which of both I have and play a lot more than this...I kind of deleted this....
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Enjoyed this book very much... ... ... ... .. ... ... ... ... ... ... .. . . . .
B0039TAHMA|5.0|Great movie... as always. The quality is if you are watching it on your PC, but is better if you are watching through your PS3 on your TV. Also, it is cheaper than rentig on itunes.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I love my marware vibe standing case for my kindle fire HD, and I love the color purple ... ...
B009UX2YAC|4.0|the only thing is the shoes that you get and make you jump can work for you or against you. but ultimately i hate the shoes. hahah
B004XZR63M|5.0|For those of us who have been given a second chance to do it right this book serves as a very important guidepost.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|I love this charger.its alot better than buying a car charger.its not too big and it has a bunch of attachments that will fit in anything that you need to charge. My kids use it with their tablets in the car on long trips. It has 2 usb out ports so you can charge 2 devices at the same time. I highly recommend this to one and all.
B008ELUEQC|4.0|Unfortunately, I ordered this at or after Christmas along with another Christmas CD; this one came 2nd. But in new condition and excellent CD.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book was cute and very romantic. I have been depressed with some of the books I have read lately. This book had to be one of the great reads.
B001LF3YQK|1.0|This case is best kept attached to a stoller for one day's use.  It is too bulky to carry around in a bag.  Plus if you leave wipes in it for more than a day, they dry out.
B008Y1KQEW|5.0|Very helpful.  Explains cookie decorating very well for beginners and those who just need fresh ideas. Loved it!! Well written with colorful photos.
0312370849|5.0|The book came on time for the holidays.  It was a Christmas present for my sister and she loved it.
1568363931|5.0|This book is provided to help you make healthy, and tasty looking lunches. While also being helpful on how to make a small lunch, it allows you to not overeat especially if you're trying to diet. This book has tasty recipes that I now can use to improve my diet and try new things.
B00AOMV7VK|5.0|The slightly new sound from violins&pianos create a chilling atmosphere which is balanced by the rock music&Andy's charming voice. The songs transition beautifully and the lyrics are just breath-taking. Definitely the best album I ever heard.<br /><br />The only flaw in an otherwise flawless album, the song \\"Lost it All\\" features Andy's gf (Juliet Simms). Due to Juliet's very raw style of singing, I feel that song lacked the beauty&balance, and (imo) Juliet ruined the song.
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|Jennifer Lawrence has won my heart with her amazing performances in recent films, including Hunger Games.  She is simply a great, young actress!  The film is intriguing and engaging; I am anxious to see sequels.  This is a really good film
B002MQYOFW|5.0|this book is one of the best books ive ever read!!! its definitely in my top 10!!!!! i love it!!!!
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I've only listened to RED throughout once, but that was enough to get me hooked on several songs.  Ms. Swift is a phenomenon, and I've loved her music since her very first hit (Tim McGraw).  She's not only a darling, stunningly cute, but her music and performances are simply extraordinary.  If you're a Taylor Swift fan, your love affair will continue with Red.  And I am 58 years old.  Add this one to your collection...you won't regret it!
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Another great installment in the tales of our Agent Pendergast. The wait was worth it. I refuse to give away one word of the book because each of them are delicious to savour. Prepare meals ahead of time and cancel all your appointments. Then enter the pages and refuse to leave until you've read every last one of them.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in a long time. It is the good,bad and the ugly of life and love.
0440539811|3.0|I read this book about 20 years ago now, and it's stuck with me. So I guess that's saying something.<br /><br />Both the fanboys and the haters are correct and incorrect in their assessments of this book. Just because it isn't super deep or erudite, that doesn't mean it can't also be thought provoking. And just because it's confusing, that doesn't make it profound.<br /><br />It's true the Illuminatus! Trilogy is written like the authors were smoking hash the whole time and thus couldn't keep straight who was talking, whether it was past or present, or what was the point anyway. It meanders and frequently seems intentionally confusing. Nevertheless I enjoyed enough of it to keep plowing ahead, and in the end I'm glad I did. If nothing else it introduced some iconic ideas (\\"Fnords!\\") and showed what can happen when you put a bunch of half-starved philosophies together in a ring and let them fight it out.<br /><br />I gather from reading some of the more negative reviews here that other authors have accomplished similar things more effectively and coherently -- Pynchon being one. I've never read any Pynchon, so I guess now I have another author to try. Others compare it (not favorably) to the Hitchiker's Guide series. I'm a huge fan of Adams and I'd agree that RAW is sort of like Adams on acid, only more rude and less funny. A more favorable comparison can be made with \\"The Philosopher's Stone\\" by Colin Wilson and Joyce Carol Oates, which I enjoyed a lot, and which covers some of the same mythic territory as Illuminatus.<br /><br />Anyway now I'm meandering like RAW did ... if you followed all that then you should be able to get something out of this tome. Or maybe it's not worth the effort, it's your call; \\"Think for yourself, schmuck!\\"
B003WUYRGI|3.0|This book is great but the part that stinks is that you can't search for a specific word hope you enjoy it as much as I did!!!!!!!
0307716546|4.0|And this is very much a story of love, a book I'd have given five stars to but for the sometimes confusing format the author has chosen within which to tell her story.  There's very much a mystery here, so for me to divulge too much of what plays out within the book's four hundred pages would't be fair.  What will pull you in and keep you almost conpulsively reading is, yes, the mystery, but the possibilities of \\"life\\" after life that the author so beautifully explores.  One exchange between mother and daughter says so much about the journey Rosamund Lupton takes the reader on; daughter Jenny says to mother Grace, \\"I'm not that scared actually...I mean, this whole thing, whatever we are now, does make it likely there's a heaven, some kind of an afterlife, doesn't it?  It proves that the physical world and the physical body isn't all there is.\\"  In telling a riveting story, Lupton does explore rather brilliantly just what happens between life and death and what happens after the death of the physical body.  And she does this within her unique format, telling a story, exploring possibilities, all the while keeping the reader within the grips of her storytelling talent.  I'm not saying more.  Read this book.  You won't be disappointed, especially if you open yourself to the possibility of \\"what if.\\"
B004HX4RT6|5.0|My grandson who is 8 is learning the game. He knows how the pieces move but doesn't have a strategy. I like the feature that allows you to get a hint on what would be a good move.  My 4 year old grandson can also play and feel included  because of the feature of resting on a piece and showing where it can move.  He will ask to play.  I think it is a good for all levels of players.
B0086700CM|5.0|This app is a fun app to play to kill time, or on road trips. Adults an  kids LOVE it. I very very very highly suggest u get this app. Hope this helped!
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. It was entertaining and the story was compelling.  I liked that there was a hint button to help me through, as I lack patience, being able to move foward with little effort when I wanted to, really added to the experience for me. I do not regret paying for this game even though I have since given away the tablet I downloaded it on! Thanks G5, you guys do great work!
B005QUQ99K|5.0|This was on his wishlist and his expression told me it was exactly what he'd hoped for, it kept him engaged for days.

B00AQMSJI2|4.0|Fun game especially because he loves playmobil. A little more challenging and harder than I thought it would be. Also hard to understand how to place things etc.

B0063M22QO|5.0|I have Mahjong for my Gameboy, but wanted to play on my Kindle Fire. This game was well rated, decent graphics, and plenty of variations in game set-ups.Only one type of tile style,though. I played it for so long I actually exhausted the battery, and caused my fingers to cramp! I have restrained myself now, but, thanks to the artifact versions, I now only play it when I can't afford to get too distracted,it is easier than with the Artifact versions, which I find downright hypnotic. If you have never played Mahjong before, it's a good way to learn.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|Typical Bruce Willis shoot-em-up if that is your preference in entertainment.  It keeps you lowering the volume for the gun blasts and raising it for the dialog.
0340980508|4.0|This book is facinating as the author goes through a stroke herself and then is able to recall and document every aspect of the experience from a brain scientists view as well as a personal view. Although my husband's stroke was not the same type of stroke that she had, I was better able to understand some of what he went through.
0316069434|4.0|Michael Connelly still tells a good story with this installment in his Harry Bosch series.  I found myself caught up in the plot from the very beginning.  Overall, I think the plot is a good one, though I will say I was disappointed with the surprise help Harry received in taking down the killer--it didn't make sense and no good explanation was given for it.  That cheapened the most dangerous moments of the book for me.  I also am finding myself getting weary of Bosch always taking on his superiors and acting as though his \\"mission\\" gives him carte blanche to do whatever he pleases.<br /><br />I also have some criticisms about Connelly's writing style.  First of all, he has regressed to using simple declarative sentences almost exclusively.  There is little in the way of complex sentence structure to vary this style.  I get the feeling the author is writing quickly so as to meet a deadline for an editor. I also miss Harry's thoughts about life and the world that were present in the earlier books in the series.  It has been a long time since the reader has been privy to some of Harry's world-weary musings about life and loneliness.  It seems to me that Connelly is now telling us what Harry is like rather than showing us by letting us into Harry's mind except in some small ways.  The richness of Harry's character is being lost except as relates to his daughter.  Even his relationship with Hannah seems rather shallow compared to his other relationships in the past.<br /><br />Still, it is fun to barrel through Connelly's books.<br /><br />For more mystery series that may entertain you, check out my website describing and reviewing many series (see my Amazon profile for the URL).
B008KO8KZ0|4.0|Have fun using this Photo Deformer, would recomend this product if you want to have fun with Pictures. Like it pretty much.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Coleen Hoover is the most fantastic author. I am 66.  But, her books still appeal to me!  Coleen writes complex stories about about young adults.  I have loved all three of her books.  I eagerly wait for her next novel.  One of her books should be made into a movie.  I nominate this one...but I LOVED the Slammed series, too.  Buy her books.  You won't be disappointed!!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Really enjoyed the second book of the series! On to the next one! I can't wait!! Suzanne Collins did an amazing job!
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Would definitely recommend.  It's nice to be able to watch and re-watch this series.  There is always something new you learn watching it again.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Mr. Grisham never disappoints.  The Racketeer was exactly what I knew it would be. If not more. I was hooked and hated to see the story come to an end.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Would definitely recommend.  It's nice to be able to watch and re-watch this series.  There is always something new you learn watching it again.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|Wasn't sure what to expect given the title, but Jonasson weaves a fanciful tale of past and present -think Benjamin Button but with added panache. The lead character is instantly likable and full of warmth; enviable support being provided by as host of historical figures. A pleasant surprise of a book full of heart.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|If you like quirky comedies, this is a good flick for you.  It doesn't try to be anything more than it is:  a cute, funny, romantic-ish comedy!  I love all of the characters in the film and the majority of the actors were perfect for their parts.  It's the type of movie I like to watch over and over so I probably should have just bought a copy!
0425252868|5.0|I was a little skeptical about this book, given its title, but for me (an avid WW II aviation buff) it delivered.  The centerpiece, a meeting between a mortally wounded B-17 and a Me-109, is a great story on its own but the back story of Franz Stigler's career in the Luftwaffe and life in postwar Germany was enthralling.  From his beginnings as a civilian instructor to dogfights in Africa to flying in Germany's elite Me-262 squadron (all while dodging and defying the Nazis in charge of his beloved country) his story is an amazing odyssey and a tribute to fighting men everywhere.  What happened to Germany's elite pilots after years of near-constant fighting of a determined and overwhelmingly numerically superior enemy is a fascinating read.
B00A0SJWQU|5.0|Good Movie on its own do not compare it to the first and hope thats what your watching with new and better cgi it is a whole new movie!
0765325950|1.0|I almost never write reviews, but I'm writing this one to express my EXTREME DISPLEASURE that the content owners decided to delay the ebook release by a couple of months. I'm not buying the physical copy. All you've done is chosen to get paid several months later, and upset one of your fans. For shame.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Delusional cross between Cartland, Jong and MH Clark.  Took a lot of skipping to read these three. 2 stars for chutzpah; none for content and writing style.
B007PFD90G|4.0|The extraordinary detail of this book makes it difficult reading, but It does reveal the dangerous fanaticism of Islam. Just as they would not relent in their desire to kill him, they will not give up their desire to establish a world caliphate. We should take warning. Rushdie's book gives us that warning. He is not alone in describing their tenacity as others have done the same, but he does it from a personal perspective of the recipient of a fatwa.<br /><br />William P.

B007TUAHVQ|5.0|My grandson, age eight years loved this Warthog and put it on his shelf so no one would touch it.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|THis might be close to a run on review only because im a huge fan of tarantino's work, you simply cannot find another MAIN STREAM director that can get so close to a NC-17 rating while still slipping under the R rating.  Now to the actual movie.    IM NOT A FAN OF WESTERNS of any type, the style, the dialogue just bores me to death. With that said, this movie changed my perspective on how movies should be done. The dialogue is simply amazing, it seamlessly flows from one line to another and you simply cant wait for the next line to come up. Written phenominally (sorry no spell check). The characters themselves are great and very memorable, sly fox king shulze always wearing a smile but watch out if your a wanted man, especially if your son is farming with you ;). Calvington is actually my favorite out of all the characters, why, not too sure. It might be his tone of voice, his accent or maybe just how certain words slip off the tongue. Django is a statue true to his core, solid foundation.    Now this movie not only enlightens on what the olden days were, not exact but very similar minus the graphics and over the top gun fights. What i found very intriguing was the way tarantino used the degrading \\"N\\" word. He used the actual \\"ER\\" version very little while the \\"gga\\" version was througout and to me this was a very slick move on his part, almost throwin up in all these \\"hoods\\" and \\"ghettos\\" (not only them but also them little cliques in school wanting to be cool) faces to show that when they use this word, thats how degrading it was back then and surely the same these days, in my eyes anyway. So i really liked that.    Tarantino is a monster with movies. Every one of his movies to me is like another GTA title from rockstar, you know your getting top shelf, a+ quality everytime, you might not be fond of the story line /setting / actors / dialogue but the overall movie is hard to deny of worhtyness compared to the s*** we get fed every week from holly wood.    The soundtrack is simply amazing. A wide mix of every genre. Another sign of a great director using every outlet possible and not sticking to one page.  His cameo is patiently awated by someone like me that knows in his movie, there will at least be a 2 min clip of him doing somehting idiotic or being killed. In this case, well i wont spoil it. but i do think his first line in the movie was one of the funniest... Jango - \\"Hey white boy..... HEY WHITE BOY\\"... Tarantino - \\"Shut up BLACK\\". simple but effective and hilarious by all means when you have an open mind just as he did when making this film..  10/10  5/5.  In my eyes its a perfect movie.  Great story line  Never bored  Amazing diaglogue  Amazing actors/characters  Top notch soundtrack. What more can you ask for ?
B005LAII8K|4.0|The movie \\"Looper\\" is a unique and imaginative film at a time when Hollywood often seems content to churn out formulaic productions loaded with special effects, sophomoric characters, and predictable plots. This movie, to its credit, has a plot you haven't seen before; and one where you won't, in all likelihood, predict the story's final outcome. For that alone, it is worth watching.<br />Many may find the film a little slow, but the pace is the result of the moral and ethical ideas being presented: good and evil, the use and misuse of time travel, age and youth and their connection in time, how present events profoundly affect the future, nature vs. nurture, and the importance of a mother's love. The movie also paints a perhaps all too realistic view of the decadent future that may await us.<br />The acting is first-rate, and a lot of hard work went into the making of the film. For this, I want to say thank you to the director, cast, and crew.<br />I also want to note the superlative work Emily Blunt brought to her role. As in her other films, in \\"Looper,\\" Ms. Blunt gives us a class in what really fine acting is. Her performance has an honesty and depth which only comes from meticulous preparation and flawless execution. There isn't a moment in the film where you feel Ms. Blunt isn't completely the character she is portraying. Her skill and absolute commitment to her role make \\"Looper\\" a much better film than it would have been without her. She is, simply, one of our very best actors.<br />So, when you watch this film, enjoy the hard work and genuine effort the director, cast, and crew put into the production. I also hope you are entertained by the story. And, finally, I hope you will enjoy and appreciate Ms. Blunt's fine acting in the film as much as I did.
B000W93CHC|5.0|I was intrigued by the extreme of the characters, either very good or very evil.  Very harsh time to live in.

B008D36INE|5.0|One of the most touching films I have seen. An excellent period piece set in post-war England. Masterful performance by Rachel Weisz . Director Terrence Davis' magnum opus. See it today.
0765325950|5.0|A book with so many different characters and viewpoints that have to be intertwined together has a good chance of falling on its face.  However Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson pulled everything together to tie up many, but not all, loose ends.<br /><br />This last book was the climax to the series that would have made Robert Jordan proud.  Was it perfect? No, it wasn't but it was worth the wait.

B00280LYIC|5.0|When I first read this book I was in sixth grade. I automatically fell in love with it. The thing is, I`m not really a big reader. But when I began to read this book in class, I couldn`t stop reading it. I suggest this book to anyone. Especially those who like the monster-like books.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Best cleaner I've used so far! I've lost count how many I've tried out but this one has to be the best one. It's nice to have control over what you want to get rid of in case you wanted to keep some but not all files. Plus, they update frequently and it's never crashed on my phone nor tablet. Awesome app!
B001GKJ2ES|5.0|the set looks great the movie is a good popcorn type movie...although it does deliver a cool message at the end
B005C9YZPA|5.0|I purchased this for a friend who is very difficult to buy gifts<br />and it was well received.  Thank you for the special packaging.<br />It's a conversational piece that will be kept on display.
B00AWTTUHI|5.0|Olivia has crafted a masterpiece with the second half of this epic. While never forgetting that he was in service to the story, Oliva clarified muddy plot points and streamlined Miller's work while remaining true to the sequence of the story STEP FOR STEP. The voice acting was superb, with Weller's weary, resonant baritone serving well in the place of iconic Kevin Conroy.<br /><br />This two-part feature has become my benchmark for animated interpretation of graphic novels, and has my highest recommendation.
B004LROUNG|4.0|This is fairly interesting and keeps your attention. This book does not compare to the books Grisham first wrote like A Time to Kill or Pelican Brief.
B007PT1PEY|5.0|Arthur Conan Doyle was a genius, just like his famous character. This collection is a fantastic piece to own. Definitely read at least once in your life

B001BEG2LK|5.0|If you are a Maiden fan, this album is required listening. Every song is a classic. If you play guitar, study this album closely because it contains the best harmony guitar parts ever put down on record by any Metal band. I think after this album (Somewhere In time) Maiden kinda lost their way a bit. The addition of the extra guitarist (Janick Gers) was just unneeded weight to an amazing lineup.
