B00821OX98|3.0|I liked the story line, which for me usually keeps me hooked on a series. The acting and character development was decent but for some reason I just couldn't finish it.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|The two writers who pitched this HBO series to the creator of the original story prove most adept at juggling hundreds of cast members who recite their passionate lines as the camera whirs through 5 countries.  Watching this movie after listening to the audio book of the original source led me to the HBO &#34;Insider's&#34; book and on to the second and third seasons.  I'm hooked.  My curiosity is never fully whetted.
B009WUBERW|5.0|All very moving and exciting action film. True to Stallone's ability to come across with a well acted and produced super heroes movie. Plenty of astounding and finger gripping scenes -- with all your super heroes from past box office smash hits to keep you entertained and wanting more.
B000BNI99K|5.0|This is an extraordinary collection of the wonderful songs I grew up with.  Rod Stewart's arrangement of each one is a delight.<br />I play the CD's all the time in my car, afraid of wearing them out.  The backup strings are really great also.  I play Rod's rendition of \\"My Foolish Heart\\" a lot from the movie with Dana Andrews and Susan Hayworth.  Rod must have seen that great movie also because he sounds like he is in love all over again.  I can still see Fred Singing to Ginger \\"The Way You Look Tonight\\"...You nailed it Rod, and thanks so much for caring about the old and great songs.
147674355X|1.0|I am in the minority on this one, because I didn't like this book. As a matter of fact, I hated this book. It started out okay and I liked Sky at first, but then everything quickly went downhill and it just kept careening down the hill.<br /><br />The four things I disliked the most about this book:<br /><br />1. Sky and Holder. They are both so unlikeable. Holder is a bit of a psycho and a complete control-freak. And then there is Sky, who faints because Holder is so attractive...literally faints. That is the heroine I am supposed to root for, a girl who faints at the sight of Holder's gorgeous eyes. I should have stopped there...why didn't I stop there? It also annoyed me that she constantly forgave Holder when he would act psychotic, violent and controlling. She had no backbone with him. And the romance between them rang false to me. The dialogue was cheesy and over-the-top, with long, emotional monologues to each other. Even the sex and make-out scenes were boring and unrealistic. I found myself skimming the sex scenes...and I never skim past sex, or at least I never have until this book.<br /><br />2. The plot twist that anyone could see coming from a mile away (SPOILERS). At the halfway mark in this book, I could see exactly where the plot was going, and I mean exactly, not vaguely. I knew exactly what Sky's father had done to her. I knew exactly what had happened to Lesslie when she was young that contributed to her depression. I had a pretty good idea who Karen really was. Knowing exactly where the plot is going halfway through the book sure kills the suspense, and from then on I just found the book tedious and boring. Additionally, the characters seemed to have no clue where the plot was going, so they just seemed like idiots during the second half of the book, being surprised over things that were so obvious. I began speed-reading, just so I could say that I finished it, but without that pesky problem of actually wasting anymore time on the book.<br /><br/>3. Irresponsible message. (SPOILERS) This book deals with sexual abuse of children, a subject that should be approached with care. However, the characters who are abused never go to therapy (even when the adults in their lives know about the abuse). Additionally, one of them has sex with another guy in order to \\"wipe away\\" the abuser's touch, and the sex scene is treated as romantic. Riiiiiiiiight.<br /><br />4. Lame plot dropping (SPOILERS). At one point in the novel the lead character gets to finally confront the abuser, and the story is about to become complicated, for instance an ensuing custody battle, a kidnapping trial, a child abuse trial, etc. Obviously, those realistic plots didn't fit into the author's plan, so (MAJOR SPOILERS) the bad guy conveniently kills himself because he is so torn up about being a bad guy.  Riiiiiiiiight.<br /><br />So, I guess I'm (mostly) alone in this opinion, but I thought this book was over-the-top, unrealistic, and extremely predictable, with two main characters who I didn't care about.
B007ZXK08C|3.0|See my headline i.e  it was quite interesting, enthrauling  and engaging....then it really got drawn out! I suppose so does marriage!!!
B004DMTCNM|5.0|What Can I say? Con Air is a great movie. Plot, actors, story - comedy, all very good. Have watched it at least a dozen times.
B0046B1KHG|4.0|Great movie for the whole family - its a great movie even adults will enjoy. and those minions are hilarious!!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I had never read the books when I saw the first movie. Saw the movie then wanted to read the series. I was not disappointed by the series. Great books (right up there with the Harry Potter series in my book. Pun intended.).
0679805273|5.0|This is my favorite graduation gift.  I give one to everyone of my children who graduated high school and personalize it with my own additions inside.  It is one of my favorite books!
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I use Google search at least two times every day and find the information I receive spot on!!<br />Google search on my Kindle Fire is wonderful.
B0078X2LKY|5.0|The most wonderful interactive book I've come across for the wee ones. More than worth the money to see the look in their eyes as they are dared to turn the page against your teasing protest. Not only an experience no child should do without, but no parent, either!
0738212415|4.0|I am no artist.  This is definitely a beginner's book that I needed.<br />I recommend it if you are a novice.
0375413405|5.0|Julia should have entitled this, French Cooking for Dummies.  It is so easy to follow, The instructions lead you through the preparations by steps, and will tell you if a portion can be made, and completed later. Her updated edition incorporates the use of blenders and food processors where possible. It is without a doubt the most complete cookbook I own.  What a joy just to read and imagine how her wonderful pate's and sauces are gong to taste when you are finished.  Love it.
B001Q4Z5UY|4.0|This movie is not for children.  There is a lot of bold language, blood and killing.  That said, it is entertainment on the dark side of humans and our existence.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|We will watch it again it was so good! We have also told friends to be sure and check it out!
B000BISBDY|5.0|Met my expectations for the price.  I am basically a \\"classic Rock\\" fan except for a few exceptions. Johnny Cash is one of those.
B00EBBQXZ0|5.0|If something has ultimate in the title, it better deliver and boy does this one do just that.  A must have for any die hard Scarface fan.  It's not something you read just once, I find myself going back over and over again looking up specific scenes and little known trivia.  Can't wait to see if the author has another ultimate guide for my other favorite movies.  Might i suggest the Ultimate Shawshank guide next??
B00BB8V2V6|5.0|I've always liked this movie, and I've watched it more than four or five times. This is rather odd for me, as I'm a guy and I love action movies and crime thrillers, and this is more or less a drama.<br />For some reason, this film just makes me feel good. Maybe its because of the characters, and their own problems. I can forget mine while watching this. Another thing that this has going for it is the actors. The entire cast is made up of movie stars, although a couple of them were popular only in the '90s, many of them remain favorites, such as Matt Dillon, Natalie Portman and Timothy Hutton, to name a few.<br />If you gals out there are looking for a fairly modern movie (released in 1996) that you and your guy can both enjoy, this might be a good choice.
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|This is a fun app that I have really enjoyed playing...  Fairly easy to learn and a lot of fun to play...
B009CF7GRY|4.0|I like Julianne as an actress. Not sure I like the rebellion attitudes for younger people to be watching in this movie, but overall, it had a good underline message.
B0024FAR5M|3.0|I love the show, I am planning on purchasing the entire series. However I was sadden when I started watching the first season...the very first disc did not work, it skipped horribly!! But all the others were fine.
B000FCKIFU|5.0|I love all the &#34;camel club&#34; series, I hope Mr. Baldacci keeps the camel club saga going on & on!

B0044C5SCU|5.0|Exiting and interesting from the first episode. They have put together a great series with and ever-evolving plot and exciting events.
B00942Y4IY|4.0|Simply a timeless go to movie. As long as it's available I'm pretty sure I will watch it more than ten times.
B005PK56TA|4.0|I liked this series enough to watch all the episodes within two nights!! It has some racy sex scenes not appropriate for younger viewers though.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Liked this game. I love this game because I love horses and all other animals. My favorite horse is probably a black or a white horse.
B00EDF43MY|3.0|I see that there are many Dr. Panda games and they are apparently dearly loved by many. Being new to them I'm seeing some really good stuff here with some unwelcome demands for ratings and unguarded links to the internet (Facebook, Amazon website, more games by TribePlay) mixed in.<br />Note: If you don't care about the annoying things, feel free to skip down to my \\"Review of the Actual Game\\" section.<br /><br />The Good: There's a Child Lock on the game. If you select the \\"For Parents\\" icon you're told to tap a picture of a lock 4 times(# varies) to continue. That's good. You'd think so wouldn't you.<br /><br />The Bad: Next, on a nicely laid out full screen with sweet, sweet music playing in the background I see: (ugh)<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />1. Like our game? Please, give us a review!  REVIEW US<br />2. Subscribe to our newsletter and stay tuned!  SUBSCRIBE<br />3. Show promotions screen  ON<br /><br />--- Like us on facebook!  Like<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />I press \\"X\\" to close the screen without doing anything and I can play the game. When I leave the game it continues to run in the background. I force close it. When I restart it I see the same screen (as above) again.<br />My interpretation: \\"You Shall Not Pass\\"--quote from Gandalf in J.R.R. Tolkien's \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\".<br /><br />Frustrated, I now hand it to my granddaughter who just woke up. I'm curious to see what she will do from here while I finish making lunches for morning. When I return she is giggling and I sit down to see what's up. She's watching a really cute Japanese YouTube video, \\"The Sushis! Mawaru Rumba\\" and singing along with it. The Good: Nice, I think she's learning Japanese! The Bad: She's now roaming free on the internet. So much for the CHILD LOCK on this game(See UPDATE below).<br /><br />So I decide to continue testing out the app. I now get a message \\"Give us a 5-star rating! Having fun with Dr. Panda? Rate us 5 stars! Options: Rate it 5 star, Remind Me Later, Dismiss\\". I choose \\"Dismiss\\" and now I'm back to that screen (see above) again--\\"You Shall Not Pass\\"! Wow, they really mean it!<br /><br />Review of the Actual Game:<br />-------------------------------<br />Anyway, now to get to the actual game. If you look at all these Dr. Panda games you can see why they get such good reviews and this one is no different. The graphics are top notch, there's goofy looking cartoon characters, the music is catchy without being distracting or annoying, and the game runs smoothly with no bugs or problems I have found.<br /><br />There's a really good variety of things to do in the game. Within the theme of an airport there is a simplified find the hidden objects, matching like items, number/letter/shape recognition, hand eye coordination, maze puzzles, how to use a pay telephone that uses coins and more. You even learn how to form a queue. Success is rewarded with cheers by the crowd and a rain of pretty colored falling stars. This game is good enough that even I was entertained by it all. The only confusing thing to me is why I kept, quite often seeing an airplane taking off on the runway. Silly adult that I am, I kept trying to make it do something until I realized that it just meant the game was loading and switching screens. (obviously I have never played a Dr. Panda game)<br /><br />The game is fairly intuitive but very young kids will probably need some help. For example, you see words like \\"Departures\\" and \\"Baggage Claims\\" and even I had to wonder what you're supposed to do next. The answer is simple. You just touch the any character and it leads you into the next game. Confusing for an adult but probably a no-brainer for many kids. I'd say the target age group here is probably around 5 years old since logic/reasoning and letter/number association is involved.<br /><br />I could nitpick and say some things are not quite right like, for example, when you use the telephone you enter an 8-digit number (instead of a typical 7-digit local phone number. I think China has 8-digit phone numbers). And have kids ever even seen a pay telephone let alone one that uses coins, do they even exist--just kidding(sort of). I'm sure they do exist and an airport might be just the place to find one. When you go through airport security some of the items that I saw passengers stopped for were cigarette lighters, a men's electric razor and a razor that uses blades. I guess this is OK for kids considering the world we live in; at least there were no knives or guns. You decide.<br /><br />So yes, overall a very fun and polished game that promotes learning for kids, isn't too difficult, and doesn't require Wi-Fi. This app really eats away at your battery though, but just make sure to force close the game(at least on a Kindle Fire HD) when you're done or your device will be dead by morning. Dr. Panda fans should not be disappointed with this game, especially with it being free today.<br /><br />UPDATE 8/29 at 3 PM: After reading a somewhat conflicting review posted after mine by Thomas Recely, I went back today and looked at the game again. What I thought was a Child Lock is actually sort of a Parent Trap(and that's a good thing). At the beginning of the game you see what look like 3 icons to choose from. The first is a round icon with a footprint on it, the second is a rectangular icon that says \\"For Parents\\" and the third is a round Airplane icon in the middle of the screen. If you select the footprint icon it does nothing(purely decorative, part of the scenery). If you choose the \\"For Parents\\" icon you DO get stuck in the review, subscribe, promotions, facebook screens as I explained above. If I had selected the big Airplane icon (which I thought was also just decorative, duh!) I would have been able to play the game without interruption.<br /><br />If you just ignore the \\"For Parents\\" icon you won't be nagged for reviews or anything else. If kids just tap the round Airplane icon(&lt;--CORRECT CHOICE), they can start the game themselves, play quite safely, and not get access to the internet(or YouTube). Sorry for any confusion.y some things are not quite right like, for example, when you use the telephone you enter an 8-digit number (instead of a typical 7-digit local phone number.

B005OYKI1I|5.0|I really liked it the grafic were really good the cars were really nice and it is a good movie for people who like cars
B00871C09S|5.0|Love Hitchcock; love Grace Kelley, love suspense.  Kept wating for it to come on TV to record, tired of waiting.  Glad to own it.
B009G78EE2|5.0|When I first saw Macklemore, I thought he was a bit of an Eminem ripoff and did not expect much.  I was very wrong.  He is an intelligent and skillful rapper, delivering thoughtful lyrics and smooth rhymes.  The hooks in each of the songs are spot on - I think this is the Ryan Lewis influence.  I've listened to the album about 6 times in the last 2 days - its addictive.
B006O6F932|5.0|My daughter loves this and it is easy for her to take out, put together and put up on her own....she is 9.  All big bonuses for me.  My son is 6 and needs help with it so it depends on the age if they will independent on it. Seems a little cheap but does the job that it was made for.
B0055B7IPE|5.0|A great love story with a fantastic message! I would highly recommend this movie to anyone out there. Rent it!
B001ENS0BI|5.0|I discovered Prison Break by accident and have been hooked ever since then. This show always keeps me captivated. I'm sorry it is only four seasons.
B0046UGSNS|2.0|The whole premise is too weird to comprehend. Why would kids want to meet their sperm donor father, and what kind of creep would sleep with their mother?
B00CV1PGUK|4.0|If you liked Cinderella, you'll love this new lp by Tom Keifer, if you doesn't maybe you'll also like this new effort, that is full of rock and soul.<br /><br />The songs are all very good, most of them mid tempos & ballads and a few rockers, with the soul that Tom's voice add.<br />About the product itself, one single black lp, with colour inner sleeve with the lyrics and also a cd. I'm not an expert myself but the vinyl sounds very good, not compresed<br /><br />When I preordered this, it was announced like a 2 vinyl discs product, I feel a little cheated by that, because I was expecting a gatefold cover and two vinyls, but the quality of the music and the inclusion of the cd, makes me feel a little better.<br /><br />Best Songs.<br />Cold Day in Hell<br />The Flower Song<br />It's not enough<br />Thick and Thin<br /><br />Music 5 Stars, Product: 4 Stars I detract one star for the two vinyls issue.
B009NLC1D6|5.0|The story of Gandhi is both uplifting and depressing.  Man's inhumanity and tendancy to waste human capital is the focus of this well-acted movie.  Histortically pretty acurate.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|Fantastic, lets hope we get round 3 to complete this epic journey in space that started so many years ago!
B002EMESSM|5.0|This film was worth waiting for and well worth watching again.  Although the special effects are a bit dated, the powerful legacy of the Enterprise crew survives.  Gene Rodenberry's style in addressing the conundrums of our time is both entertaining and throught-provoking.
B005D63ICI|5.0|Nothing like riding along with Dexter and his &#34;Dark Passenger.&#34;  Probably not the best man for the ladies to have a relationship with, but other than that, what's not to love about the Serial Killer with a black but lovable heart?
B001NLL93W|5.0|This is such a great book series! I could not put it down! The story just keeps getting better page after page!
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|Love this show! Very intense from the get-go and always keeps us on the edge of our seat. Can't wait to see the third season!
B00ECU2RGY|3.0|Lots of action, good special effects, weak story, weak acting.  Glad I didn't see it at big screen prices. Not Tom's best!
0307279189|5.0|This is a wonderful book for athletes or anyone wanting to be like athletes.  I recommend it especially for teenagers.
B00389XV42|5.0|I love Chuck and wished they didn't cancel it. The right mix of humor, drama and spy antics give everyone a treat.
B00ECU2SGS|2.0|HE FILM SHOWED A LOT OF PROMISE DUE TO THE INGENUITY OF THE TWO BOYS AND THE WAY THEY INTERACTED WITH MATTHEW McCONAGHEY.  HOWEVER, ULTIMATELY WAS NO REAL PAYOFF AND THE LAST THIRD (OR SO) OF THE MOVIE WAS A DUD.  THE ENDING LEFT ME SAYING &#34;WHAT THE H--L?
B0013TXA5Y|1.0|As I was reading this book, I kept thinking, &#34;gee, this reminds me so much of Harry Potter!&#34;  Then I learned that the author got her start as a writer of HP fanfic.  Well THAT makes sense.  Sadly there is nothing original in this story.  It's basically just Harry Potter with the names changed, and a bit of incest thrown in for good luck.<br /><br />The writing is also really bad.  As other reviewers have pointed out, the author does way too much &#34;telling not showing.&#34;  For example, the narrator says things like &#34;his eyes told me not to ask about his past, because he was so wounded by it and didn't want to open up.&#34;  Um, no one's EYES say that.  That is lazy writing right there.  There were a lot of parts of the book where Jace's &#34;eyes&#34; or &#34;face&#34; said something, or &#34;he looked at me as if to say...&#34;  Unfortunately I really can't stand to open the book again to find specific quotes, but trust me, those sentences will start jumping out at you after a while.<br /><br />The heroine was yet another &#34;Everywoman&#34; who doesn't know how beautiful she truly is, and the dark and mysterious supernatural love interest has to convince her that she is special, blah blah blah.  I am so sick of reading these dull, pathetic heroines.  I expect better from a female author.  Can we get some real heroines that young women can actually look up to?  (Books like Mortal Instruments and Twilight make me appreciate Katniss in the Hunger Games that much more!)<br /><br />I am usually a fast reader, but this book was really slow for me because I would find myself having read an entire page or two and I couldn't remember a thing about what had just happened, so I had to go back and read it again.  The story was so boring that my brain didn't even pay attention to the words any more.  I finished the book out of a sense of obligation, and I was sorry I did, because the big &#34;plot twist&#34; (which was super-predictable) was pretty oogy.<br /><br />I wish I could say that I don't understand why they made a movie out of this book, but alas, Hollywood, and unfortunately the girls who pay to see these movies, don't care about a lack of originality as long as the leading man is hunky enough.
B0091REZMW|1.0|This game is incredibly frustrating! It is slow. Very, VERY slow! You either have to use real money to &#34;buy&#34; jewels to get things you need, or leaves you progressing at such a slow rate, that after 5 MONTHS, it's almost torture!<br />You HAVE to have &#34;friends&#34; to do some &#34;quests&#34;, and if you don't sucker your friends into playing with you, you are just plan out of luck to do some things.<br />It also doesn't seem to have a point! Just WHAT is the reason I'm at this &#34;Mystery Manor&#34;? And why do I care to spend my money, time and effort to &#34;find&#34; the same 50 items over, and over, and over, and over, and over........? And WHY in the world can't I get into the other rooms and the basement? What's with that? Some of the &#34;quests&#34; are SO LONG, and require so MANY &#34;items&#34;, that you might as well forget EVER getting them done!<br />In short, it's fine if you want a mindless &#34;object find&#34; game to play for 5 minuets a day. But if YOU want to control ANYTHING in the game you are playing, (amount of time playing, how much you want to spend, having a plot, progressing through the game, excitement, speed, meeting goals, doing quests or GETTING FINISHED AT ALL) this is NOT the game for you.
0345479092|3.0|I didn't like the author's &#34;folksy&#34; writing style very much, but I gave her EASY (Eat Activity Sleep You-time) method a try.  It worked pretty well when the baby was super-young and sleeping a lot.  But it doesn't really work for growth spurts when he is eating all the time.  Also now that he is older (and he's only 4.5 months old), his naptimes are way shorter and his playtimes are way longer, and the system really just doesn't work for us any more.<br /><br />I have a friend who swears that this book is the reason that her baby slept through the night at 10 weeks, but then her baby hit 4 months and had sleep-regression issues just like all the other 4-month babies I know (mine included), so I don't think this book turned out to the magical panacea she thought it was.<br /><br />I appreciate that the author is trying to be reassuring to nervous new parents, but all the &#34;luvs&#34; in the book just got grating and patronizing after a while.  Plus she has some interesting ideas about respecting your baby as a person (e.g. don't undress him / change his diaper without asking his permission, etc.), but after a certain point -- you ARE the parent and your baby just has to deal; you don't have to treat him like Prince George of Cambridge.<br /><br />When Baby was a newborn and I was totally sleep-deprived and panicked any time that he cried, it was helpful to follow the &#34;EASY&#34; pneumonic because it was predictable and comforting and something that even my baby-brain couldn't forget.  But I couldn't make it through all the &#34;luvs&#34; in the book and my baby grew out of this in only a few weeks, so I wouldn't recommend reading the whole book when you can just Google the EASY method to find out what it's about.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I only \\"buy\\" free books so my choices are of course quite limited, but I've been greatly enjoying these books in the public domain. I certainly don't recommend all of them across the board, but there are real treasures here, such as The Secret Garden. It costs nothing to download them and they are gone with the flick of a finger if I don't care for them. I have read much higher quality books during the past few months because books in the public domain from yearys gone by aren't being produced unless there is something to them. I've discarded a tremendous amount of free modern drivel lately. I am fortunate in being able to get a great many of the pricey books at my local library for free. I'm just saying, give these public domain books a try.
B000LXQVA4|4.0|My granddaughter is 5 months old and is now able to touch the ground. She just loves to bounce and grab on to the toys. So much better than I imagined it.
B00CATSONE|5.0|THE BOOK IS SHORT.<br /> IT IS REALLY ABOUT WHAT IT TAKES TO SUCCEED IN LIFE , HARD WORK AND DEDICATION.<br /> IT ALSO EMPHASIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF IMAGINATION AND HOW THAT, IN MANY WAYS, IS THE ULTIMATE MEASURE OF MANKIND'S SUCCESS UPON THIS EARTH.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|It's the game that never ends. It's super addictive at first, trying to figure out the best use of your coins. But eventually you get enough bonuses to have more coins than you could ever play. I'm currently at level 172 with over 5000 coins! But you never seen to get the prizes you need. I had 15 pink sunglasses before I got my 3rd red whistle! There's no rhyme or reason to what prizes drop.
B005ZC0SYQ|4.0|Interesting that they chose Detroit as the setting of the movie. Kind of sad, really. By the end of the movie, justice is served.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|Escape????  I can't even figure out how to play this game.  There were no instructions available and it was very frustrating trying to figure it out.<br />I deleted it.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|I've worn this watch for the past 2 weeks and have found it to be accurate enough for my needs and I really like the band. Amazon made the price a very good value for the money and I'm glad I got it. I don't know about the long term but the Seikos I've owned in the past were up there in quality.
B002C949AE|3.0|While a lot of Waris Dirie's story was very compelling and touching as well as in parts horrifying, she often comes across as a person who is not always very likable (pushy, nervy, superior, preachy, know-it-all). She portrayed herself different than I had expected. The beginning of her story which took place in Somalia was the most believable. Once she relocated to London there were a lot of very lucky coincidences (practically one after the other) and the biography became less plausible. Perhaps she condensed the actual incidents too much and in reality there was a lot more to the resolution of each storyline. But as is, a lot of it seemed rather far-fetched towards the middle and end of the book.
B001UEBHYS|5.0|So many levels.  My grandchildren had never seen it and they enjoyed it.  Great acting and script!  My Grandson wants to show it to his class.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|Love the game so far, I have only played for a day but it keeps you involved and the graphics are beautiful.
B002U6CJCE|3.0|this movie was ok, not like the first one when it came out, but it could have been a lot better
B009NH6JRE|5.0|I've been watching this since Season 1. It's a great show with awesome characters. Every episode will keep you on your feet.and wanting more. I own all 3 seasons on BluRay and will continue to buy them as they come on.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This game plays perfect on my Kindle Fire, and the gameplay is extremely engaging. This is one dollar well spent. I mean really, what was I going to spend that dollar on anyway? Chewing gum?
B0008KLVG4|5.0|I love Jaws, and this made me happy. The quality is great and there's lots of bonuses. So if you like Jaws, you should seriously consider buying this.
1616202416|4.0|The book was good. No tears or bends in the cover or pages. No writing. I am very satisfied with the quality of the book and shipping.
B002LC2DQ4|5.0|I could not find any XD cards in the local stores several months ago. This is an excellent product and is shipped promptly and reasonable priced.
B0081336FO|5.0|This is an excellent show, the actor's performance is brilliant. The suspense is good and the plots are awesome. 100% recommended!!!
B00BB8OHMW|3.0|It was an ok or so so movie, good stars in it but was only somewhat moving. It was hard for me to get into the Shakespeare mode I suppose. the movie left me a bit empty at the end.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I can't wait until Season 4 comes out.  Season 3 leaves us breathless, with unexpected twists, expecting more of the wonderful characters, story line, and of course, the next chapter in all of their lives.  January 5th, the start of the new Season 4 for the US just can't get here fast enough.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|I love this came I would recommend this game to anyone that is up for a challenge..this game I challenging but easy if you no what the signs are. five stars. I would love this game of the hints were a little cheaper
B00005CDNJ|5.0|Dance, remember, and dance some more...feeling down this will lift your spirits... great production...great sound track. Cannot help but make you happy...buy it...try it...and dance the night away.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Well written. Couldn't put it down; and the ending-WOW. Encouraged all my friends to read it.<br />Can't wait for her next novel.
B000VLE3GA|5.0|It has all the great songs I wanted to hear on it and have no problems with it. Worth the moola.
B004XISI4A|3.0|Enjoyed the 5th book but it is becoming too detailed and long. Time to bring it to a logical end.
B00DQQZNZW|5.0|I have most of their albums, and this has to be one of the best ones in the last ten or fifteen years.
B00E1L9N8E|5.0|The best adaptation of the movie I have seen to date.  I thought the music was look of the movie was exciting and elicited the feel of the Roaring Twenties Jazz Age.  The very best direction and editing was given to the introduction of Gatsby with Gershwin's Rhapsody in the background.  Truly one of the best scenes of any movie.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Yes, I know that this isn't high art, and it's a combo of Bring It On (actually they poke fun at it) and a lot of other teen movies from the 2000's.  But it's HILARIOUS!  The performance scenes are amazing, and what really blew me away was the talent of these already known actresses - Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson, and Brittany Snow specifically.  I was shocked that they were singers as well!  Anyway, there are always going to be nay-sayers who hate everything, but really, if you want a fun hour and a half where you don't have to think too hard and can laugh REALLY hard - plus see some great song remixes - watch it.  It's like Glee except more believable and the characters aren't as obnoxious.
0525478817|5.0|I loved this book. I read it so fast that I regret, because it was an amazing read. The book is just so amazing you will want read more and more until it's done. The story is sad, but beautiful at the same time, and the story is just amazingly written. You get to see the world from the perspective of a teenager with cancer, you feel like you're her in this story. If you're looking for a new novel, try this one. You will fall in love with it! Can't wait for the movie. I hope it's amazing just like the book is.
B007NZ7LIY|5.0|This is a classic, still cool and just as addictive as it was when it first came out. I was surprised that the controls actually worked rather well. There are situations were the controls are prefect and some were the old controller would be a better fit.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Very well written I read all three within a two week period.  The characters are well developed and you feel like you get to know them.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Got this game app for my 8 year old and 12 year old. 12 year old says... &#34;This is a really fun & addicting game!&#34; 8 year old &#34;it's good for all ages. I would give it 5 stars because it is so fun.&#34;  About the same idea as Subway Surfers, and Temple Run.
B002MFULQO|2.0|If you can follow the weird editing of this film and its fantastic premise, it provides some entertainment. But don't look to director Oliver Stone's paranoid vision of America for any answers about the 1963 Kennedy assassination. Kevin Costner is excellent, as are the supporting cast members (even the very creepy performance by Tommy Lee Jones), but the script is a mess. The film is really more like a sci-fi alternative history of the events of the '60s rather than anything of reality.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Nothing like having God's Word at your fingertips and on the go. Love this App. There will never be an excuse now for a young person (or any generation ) to not carry The Bible everywhere one goes.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|This album is a mixed bag pretty much of songs that we've heard other artists record through the years, and so Michael has a challenge to make it convincingly his song.  I didn't care at all for &#34;Can't Buy Me Love&#34; and &#34;The More I See You.&#34;  But I loved the rest--particularly &#34;Feeling Good,&#34; &#34;A Foggy Day,&#34; &#34;You Don't Know Me,&#34; &#34;Home,&#34; and &#34;You and I.&#34;  We see a lot of different moods in this album, and I'm glad to be able to add it to my collection!
B003U4ZQRK|5.0|I was very late on the train to begin watching this. I finally started watching it on Amazon Prime. I was immediately addicted and watched all 6 seasons in a matter of 2 months! It was horrible to be that addicted to the show but it was a great show!
B002KDUDG6|5.0|I love Michael Buble's music.  There are only 2 titles on here that I didn't care much for:  &#34;Heartache Tonight&#34; maybe too rock & roll for him.  &#34;At This Moment&#34; more of a R&B item.  The rest are more his specialty--smooth an/or jazzy.  &#34;Cry Me a River&#34; is very dramatic, but unlike some people, I don't think it's too much.  The song is dramatic, and he pulls you into it and makes you feel it--love it.  It's certainly a contrast to the rock & roll version Joe Cocker did of this song and extreme contrast to the early version by Julie London.  I love his light-hearted &#34;Haven't Met You Yet.&#34;  This is a good album--glad to be able to add it to my collection.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have always loved period shows and this one is one of the best.  I hope it continues for a long time.
B008FRFN7A|3.0|I have to work with the app some more before I could give it a better rating.  Hard to just print from file or photo.  you have to print from eprint.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|\\"Building Your Book for Kindle\\"  helped me publish in a short time, the first time.  I printed it and keep it and use it each time I publish an eBook ~ which, so far, is 3!!!  I would highly recommend this if you are new to publishing for Kindle.  Happy WRiting!!!
B003U6BE8I|4.0|The movie is much more enjoyable than the book and has a smooth flow!  The screen play writer should get a metal for taking a choppy unprofessional book where the characters just stubble around into things and making the material work into a constant flow for the movie!  The characters go to the same places but with meaning and style in the movie.  Caution - the screen play does have scenes that the book does not.
B00CH26TL8|2.0|This game was too complicated. The biggest problem was that it kept freezing up my Kindle Fire. Graphics looked cool though.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|Great to watch because it held my interest throughout the movie.  Matthew McC is great in this movie.  See it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I watched this in 2 sittings...saw first 4 episodes one night and did NOT want to stop and go to bed! Finished it the next day. Now...again, I can't wait until  Season 4....I love these people...this countryside...the music....Just absolutely love &#34;Downton Abby.&#34;
B00DBSZEH2|4.0|Great action and storyline.  The two main characters worked well together.  It's great to see the heroes getting their tails kicked but win in the end.
B008XG1X18|5.0|pintrest lets you share ideas with so many people; its inspiring.  I have now become a little more intune with my fashion and have actually gotten comments about how put together I am. all I had to do was look in my own closet and I was able to put different life's together that I didn't think about before. Thank you pintrest!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love this series had heard so much about the series glad I got the chance to watch all of the seasons!  Can't wait for the 4th season.

B000ZJTPLG|5.0|Had it only a few days now, but it has very nice sound. Very powerful for such a tiny device using 2 triple A batteries (included). No complaints so far. Durability is yet to be seen. It's pretty light. It does not reamp or make louder the aux in, so make sure your aux in source has plenty of juice coming into the unit.
0307341550|4.0|I chose this book because I loved &#34;Gone Girl&#34;.  That one kept me on the edge of my seat and up late hours trying to finish another chapter.  &#34;Sharp Objects&#34; is very unusual and I identified with the main characters.  It has a lot of violence which does not bother me, but might not be everyone's cup of tea.  The main female character is a cutter who has etched words into her body,hence the name and cover picture of the razor blade.  The plot kept me interested and the twisted ending is a big surprise.  Of the two, I preferred &#34;Gone Girl&#34; and used it as a book club selection for my group, but i was not disappointed in this one.  Hoping for more by this author.
B007DIQAXI|5.0|I love this album and I was really surprised to find that the vinyl was hot pink! Very neat, indeed.
B00E5Q1HJS|4.0|Great movie! Really enjoyed this one more than the first one. Visually stunning, written well, and since we didn't read any of the synopsis that were out there surprising as well!
B000I55YV2|5.0|After seeing the original Italian Job with Michael Caine I thought it could not be done again but I was pleasantly surprised! Yes, the second film was updated with new gadgets and lots of action in those fabulous small Mini Cooper cars. This film left the Italian Mafia out of it but with a new twist placed a sneak and a traitor in their happy band of robbers. It is a very well done film and the scenes shot in Italy are absolutely gorgeous! The film like the first is very fast paced. If you have seen the first movie and you see the second then you will have the better of two worlds. That is if you had a library than these two films would be the two bookends that you would feature. I gave it five stars because the cast of players all did a superb job. I thought that Mark Wahlberg was outstanding! I love his films for what he brings to them and that is 120%. Since viewing this film, I have seen it as well as the first one a few times and have enjoyed each viewing. So see it if you want to spend a great evening with an outstanding film!

B00597A4VY|5.0|The Memphis Belle, a B-17F Flying Fortress, is one of the most famous aircraft in the history of WWII. Early in the war it was a very hard time for the Americans whose missions were daylight bombardment over Hitler's fortress Europe. The movie shows specifically what is was like to fly a mission while in formation with attacking German fighters and over the target with the incoming flack of the guns below. Casualties were very high with many flights not coming back from a raid. Morale was extremely low. So high command established the goal of 25 missions. Once you came back from that you were home free. In May 1943 the Memphis Belle became the first U.S. Army Air Forces heavy bomber to complete 25 missions over Europe. It then returned to the United States. The pilot, then-Lt. Robert Morgan, named the aircraft after his wartime girlfriend, Margaret Polk, of Memphis, Tenn.  The film is outstanding as it mixes in real combat footage of what it was like being on a bomb run over the dangerous skies over Europe, as the lead plane would drop the bombs and the rest of the planes would follow suit. The B-17 used a bombsight that was a secret but worked very effective in getting the bomb loads on the targets for the day. The film shows the dedication and the can do determination to place the bombs on the targets as they flew through flak ticker than pea soup. The Memphis Belle after the war was restored to flying conditions and often you could see it at the different air shows around the country. Back in 1993 as I recall I had the pleasure of seeing it in a fly-in at Eglin AFB with other planes of WWII. It was very exciting for the WWII pilot Lt. Robert Morgan brought her in and it landed safely. I gave the film five stars for its outstanding portrayal of what it was like to live in England and fly a daily mission to drop your payloads on strategic targets in Europe to win the war in the skies and gain supremacy. I feel strongly that nobody even today can see such a film and not appreciate the courage and bravery of the aircrews that flew the B-17's over fortress Europe to win the war of the skies.not appreciate the courage and bravery of the aircrews that flew the B-17's over fortress Europe to win the war of the skies.
B00DW5IM9Q|5.0|When I was a junior in high school in 1969, we had to write a thesis; you picked your own topic. I still remember quite well that mine was called \\"Bob Dylan is a Modern-Day Prophet.\\" What I can recall is that my flimsy premise rested on the fact that Dylan kept manifesting himself in these new forms that were initially rejected by the masses who were behind the times, ultimately having the last word, enjoying those naysayers having caught up and gotten the idea. The use of the word, \\"prophet,\\" however, was unfortunate, since it played right into what was apparently the most toxic of Dylan's demons at the time. He had no interest in being a prophet, the voice of a generation, the moral conscience of the youth of today, and so on. He was not flattered that people scrutinized his garbage cans for some ridiculous holy grail. So, when things got too hot, Dylan reinvented himself.<br /><br />Of course, for Bob Dylan, personal reinvention had been accomplished several times already by the late 60s. He began his career with a pack of lies delivered to his Greenwich Village audiences, filled with fictitious biographical date and thereby constructed a false \\"Bob the Rambler\\" type of folk story. He started out with solo acoustic \\"protest\\" and other traditionally folkie sounding material. By his fourth album, Another Side of Bob Dylan, he had begun to write his lyrics less didactically and more impressionistically, a trend that would take him right up to the period covered in this set. His going electric in '65, as has been well documented, enraged the folkie purists. Then, when he moved toward country music - more simple, direct, and personal- starting with John Wesley Harding, all bets were off. Most heads were shaking with disbelief when the change was complete and the in-your-face country character of Nashville Skyline (with its in-your-face title) doused water on the flames of his perceived deity. Much talk focused on Dylan DELIBERATELY putting out rotten material to humanize himself in the eyes of his rabid fans.<br /><br />My own take on this shift at the time was typical. I found little engaging in any of it, hated his new country voice and thought his lyrics had gotten boring and simplistic. I remember rejoicing at the return-of-the rasp that awaited me when I first dropped New Morning on the turntable. (Actually, there was still a bit of the country voice present - in Winterlude, for example.)<br /><br />Self-Portrait, initially almost universally panned, has done quite well for itself over the decades. And a vital key to getting what Dylan was up to can be discovered in his autobiographical Chronicles Vol. 1. It can also be found in his satellite radio show. The beautiful irony is that the heart of this man contains a profound and longstanding love for the American song. His scholarly, near encyclopedic knowledge of blues - Chicago, country, acoustic - Tin Pan Alley, Appalachian folk music, along with practically every other overlooked genre of American roots and popular music reflects the deep love he has for this awesome river of creativity that sprang primarily from the mouths of poor folks, who were footnotes in the official chronicles of American music, if that. So, when Bob Dylan reached the end of his rope as spokesman of his generation, he shed the individual glory and bathed in the obscurity of his beloved songs - not the ones from his heart, but those nearest to it. And looking back, his vision and aesthetics are stunningly on target.<br /><br />If you could figure out that the rules of hip had been discarded and living \\"like a complete unknown\\" actually appealed to the man who coined the phrase, you found gold in these precious songs. Bob's voice is all over the place, too, and it's a wonderful thing to witness. Sometimes it's that molasses country croon. (And incidentally, back in the day, when a journalist referred to his new way of singing, Dylan attributed it - no doubt with typical trickster avoidance - to quitting smoking. \\"Just stop smoking and you'll sing like Caruso,\\" he said.<br /><br />Think about that...<br /><br />The Protest King listening to one-sided, 12-inch Victor 78s of a very early 20th century Italian opera singer? I happen to get a kick out of that image...<br /><br />And sometimes the old Highway 61/Blonde on Blonde rasp is there. He's constantly mixing it up, though, almost infinitely fluid, and never has his vocal style seemed more like it was serving the material, song by song, word by word. I mean, the mid-sixties albums are all classics, but each LP is sung in the same basic voice.<br /><br />In short, Another Self-Portrait catches Dylan seeking solace in the anonymity of obscure old songs and writing newer, more direct, tender and vulnerable ones of his own. Not a \\"protest\\" song in the bunch, nor is he at all obscure or hallucinogenic. The original tunes are pensive, a bit more relaxed and in some respects, wiser. They seem to reflect more emotional connection; he's in a more feeling place. (The absolute jewel in the crown for me is the stunningly soulful and intimate solo piano reading of When I Paint My Masterpiece. It's worth the price of the entire set.)  ASP is one of the most human, engaging and eclectic collections of his career. A few of the early 20th Century songs, which were initially simple and sparse by their original performers, yet appeared on Self Portrait with considerable \\"sweetening\\" have been significantly stripped down. (Copper Kettle, for example...) As a result, their character and subtle dramatic power is given a chance to stand out and be fully appreciated.<br /><br />I can't stop listening to this. Highly recommended!
B003SPCYP8|4.0|This turned out to be a very good and uplifting movie even though it took a little time getting to that point. I also think that it showed some interesting characteristics of ASD that you would not find illustrated in the US movies. This movie is considered a 'Bollywood' movie so it's very long and it also has the musical spots in it unlike the US/UK/etc movies.

B00AHHODH2|5.0|I can see why this novel is a Finalist in the 2013 Reader's Favorite Annual International Awards Contest.<br />I love small towns, I guess it's because I came from a small town. Although small towns usually go at a slow pace - the same cannot be said for jealous feeling and gossip of small towns.<br />This novel is about some unconventional and slightly strange women whose activities involve walking their dogs, among other things. Although they are friends and share some of the same interests - they still have things they do and indulge in secretly.<br />Savannah, Georgia is a delightful place for this kind of mystery. Almost reminds me of Gone With The Wind in a peculiar kind of way.  I believe this author is adept at spicing up the stories with humor and accommodates the reading audience with a desire to keep turning pages. You might do as I did by trying to read between the lines, only to be surprised. I think you will like this mixture - it is a curious and different kind of variety that will make for a beautiful day indeed. It surely won't be a thorn in your side.<br /><br />Jeannie Walker - Award Winning Author - \\"Fighting the Devil\\" - A True Story of Consuming Passion, Deadly Poison, and Murder

B009NFHF0Q|3.0|I only finished the book a few weeks ago, and I Can longer tell you the names of a single character.  It's not a bad read, but it lacks the punch and novel angles that Gaiman's better works contain.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|I watched this movie expecting an explosion filled slightly confusing sci-fi flick, which would have honestly been just fine because I like explosions and science fiction. However; this movie went much deeper than anticipated, the story line is exceptionally well laid out and it went further and deeper than most sci-fi films of today. I found myself placed in the story as if I were a character in the plot, the movie brings up questions of purpose, the classic &#34;Why are we here?&#34; kind of stuff, and it does it in such a subtle way that I felt like a friggin philosopher during some post movie discussion.<br />Bottom line: I'll be getting this one on DVD soon.

B00CQGU9GG|3.0|If you are interested in this box set, I'm assuming you don't need a review to tell you how good the music here is.  So I'm going to try help you with understanding the mixed quality of at least one aspect of this box set.<br /><br />I've been reading the various reviews many of which have highlighted the issue of volume maximising the 10 albums in this pack may or not have been subjected to.<br /><br />The first point I thought should be made clear - It costs no more NOT to subject a new mastering to volume maximising than to do so.  The fact that this is a \\"budget\\" release is just not relevant.<br /><br />But to bring objectivity to the claims and counter claims I checked the Replay Gain levels of the 10 albums, and for comparison, some other versions, including the first three albums transferred from my original vinyl copies, de-clicked and peak normalised (loudest peak set to just reach the max possible level).<br /><br />This is the result:<br /><br />Album - Replay Gain level (dB-Replay Gain scale)<br /><br />Afterburner - 90.9<br />Degüello - 91.7<br />El Loco - 92.7<br />Eliminator - 99.0<br />Fandango - 95.8<br />Recycler - 93.4<br />Rio Grande Mud - 95.5<br />Tejas - 93.7<br />Tres Hombres - 92.0<br />ZZ Top's First Album - 95.1<br /><br />My Fandango LP transfer (de-clicked) - 91.6<br />My Tejas LP transfer (de-clicked) - 90.9<br />My Tres Hombres LP transfer (de-clicked) - 90.5<br />My Rio Grande Mud LP transfer (de-clicked) - 90.8<br />My ZZ Top's First Album LP transfer (de-clicked) - 91.2<br /><br />Fandango 2006 remaster - 96.1<br />Tres Hombres 2006 remaster - 95.7<br />Eliminator 2008 remaster - 99.3<br />La Futura - 102.0<br /><br />Replay Gain is an algorithm for assessing perceived \\"loudness\\", and is offered in a lot of audio playback software to enable listening to music at about the same volume across albums.<br /><br />To introduce some subjectivity for those not familiar with all this, your typical 1970's/1980's albums would, in my well over a thousand album experience, typically achieve a Replay Gain level of between 89 and 92 dB.  Anything over 95 is almost certain to have been run through volume maximising compressors during mastering.<br /><br />So we see on this criteria, Tres Hombres is the jewel of the set.  First time on CD with almost no compression applied.  Brilliant.  Not so good for the other two of those first three albums.  Clearly they have been given the treatment (and yes this is obvious in an audio editor like Audacity), but only lightly.  One wonders why.....<br /><br />One also wonders why Fandango and Eliminator are close but NOT exactly the same as the maximised 2006/2008 remasters?  Surely they come from the same remasters??  Was some final stage of volume maxing not used this time???<br /><br />I've also included La Futura so you can see how bad it gets.  This is state-of-the-art awful.  Note this is the extra track Best Buy version, though the standard version is almost the same.  That the La Futura cd is at all listenable with this over-the-top compression shows how improved the volume maximising software has become over the last decade.  But if this is what they give us - may they go bankrupt as soon as possible.  They ARE idiots.

B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|The game is really fun. Not to hard to learn how to play. ONLY con is that the game doesn't seem very challenging; could be because I have not advanced to higher levels yet.
B000HZGNEU|4.0|While this movie shows its Eighties roots (hairstyles, etc.) its still a great story and one of the better movies in the series (debatable, I know).  Was fun to break it out again!

One of the two is terminal. That's it. That's the main premise.\\" Do the math.<br /><br />I have to wonder about the people that write book sleeve descriptions of novels.  In my last review of \\"Wayward Girls\\" you already had an idea of what was coming.  Well for this one, the description is a spoiler in itself.  That said, I enjoyed this.<br /><br />It's a simply written novel.  By simply written, I mean it's a screenplay which will be a movie by the way, starring Shailene Woodley (good casting there) and some other dude from the Divergent movie that plays Caleb Prior, Ansel Elgort(who?).  I'm doing my usual digressing here.  The writing is simple and to the point.  Not that I've read Nicholas Sparks novels (and don't plan on it), but I'm sure it's safe to say this is nothing like that.  That's not to say that this is bad story telling.  There are a lot of great quotes in this here novel.  If I could figure out how to look at everything  I've highlighted in this novel on my Kindle, I'd share some of them.  And by great, I also mean cheesy.<br /><br />I'm not going to lie.  I got emotional towards the end.  This is no surprise when I get engaged in a novel that I enjoy.  Usually I fist pump or go\\" WTF, are you kidding me?\\" to myself.  This was more of a sentimental feeling.  There were other parts where I grinned, chuckled, and laughed.  No. I didn't cry but I did find myself getting emotional towards the end. And the end...<br /><br />When a main character dies (this is no spoiler, I did mention this is about two cancer patients), it should have ended.  However, Mr. Green felt the need to extend it.  I consider it an epilogue.  He considered it adding more chapters and not calling it said epilogue.<br /><br />If you're a romantic at heart, you can do no wrong with \\"Fault.\\" It's sweet and endearing.

B005LHO274|2.0|If you want a table observatory app for your kindle fire, keep looking!  This is not your point and click app. The Fire is simply not capable of allowing you that option. No matter what I do this app is perpetually facing South until you move the horizon manually. Given that was the sole reason I purchased it and it doesn't do what it says it does, I'd like my money back....like that will ever happen!

B00ADQCBEY|5.0|I forgot how innovative this series was when it was first aired.  The jerky camera work, the music and the way they pushed the envelope with the language and situations.  Lots of drama with just enough humor (albeit, sometimes gallows humor) to make it a fun ride.  If you've never seen this series and you're not squeamish or timid?  You owe it to yourself to watch at least a couple of episodes.

B0000542D2|2.0|Review of the Miramax/Lionsgate DVD<br /><br />Let me say that the picture quality is pretty good to start (1.66:1 anamorphic, abit cropped from 1.37:1) and IS a massive improvement over the rampant interlacing and video artifacts that plagued the MPI DVD release. However, bonus content is kinda measly and the audio quality in the film is the worst part. The MPI release has far better audio as it used a higher quality stereo source. This Miramax/Lionsgate release uses the monaural mix resampled to 5.1, very poorly and sloppily might I add. The whole thing sounds monaural with tininess and warbled echoing coming from 5 speakers, with .1 coming from whenever a song has a drum beat or a stage room with drowned out footsteps.  To assemble the best print of the film, get ahold of the MPI and Miramax DVDs, but sync the audio from the former to the video of the latter with a video editing program, since both releases run the exact same duration. And there, problem solved!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|This DVD collection makes me want to \\"Kick Back\\" and emulate the \\"Power of Love\\", talk about a \\"Perfect World\\".
B0079J28NC|3.0|This interesting tidbit of outlandish animation, Beatles music, and its trippy nature was given a new DVD release and a Blu-ray debut last year from Apple, who's team had just completed a 4K frame-by-frame resto.<br /><br />The first DVD release from MGM in 1999 was a decent effort, but had its problems. While non-anamorphic, its video quality was a mixed bag ranging from washed out color to edge enhancement. There is some interlacing present in a few scenes (mainly the beginning and end credits), but not throughout (see where I'm getting at here).  Audio quality is somewhat inconsistent too, the 5.1 mix had dialog portions quiet as a mouse, but musical numbers were excessively LOUD; almost ear-shattering. But at least the mono track is present (although some parts switch to down-converted stereo, due to lost audio material).<br /><br />The Apple/Capitol DVD from last year uses the 4K restoration the BR uses. It is a massive improvement in visual presentation as far as the source goes. Colors pop, details sparkle, and it looks like one of Disney's platinum releases (but obviously its not, tee hee). While this release has the chance to beat the MGM DVD, it falls flat in the video transfer. For some reason (likely to drum-up Blu-Ray sales) Apple thought it was smart to encode whole the feature film INTERLACED, meaning combing on fast moving images/sequences and a nasty case of staircasing. This is annoying on progressive displays even with 1080P up conversion via the player or scaler, though its not noticeable on CRTs as they are interlaced by default. Strangely, the trailers and featuretts are encoded progressive as most DVD's have them the opposite.  The 5.1 audio is the EXACT same one as the previous DVDs, meaning inconstant volumes. But it is in DTS, which sadly doesn't help much aside from the bit-rate. It also has German & Italian 5.1 tracks which are derived from the English mix, a 2.0 Eng Stereo track (downmixed from the 5.1 track) and the original Mono mix (which still encounters the same stereo switching issues).<br /><br />If you want to see YS in its best (progressive Hi-res), shell out for a BR player and the Blu-ray disc.  Audio and extras are the exact same as the DVD, but the audio is DTS-MA (7.1 & 5.1 tracks) and DD 2.0 224kbs (ENG stereo and Mono).<br /><br />Until next time, Yippie-kye-yay mista falcon!!

B00CL0J99K|4.0|*Be warned, this review contains spoilers*<br /><br />When it comes to Marvel's latest masterpieces, Iron Man 3 has by far the greatest gap in differing opinions.<br /><br />What this movie is NOT; Iron Man 3 is NOT a movie where Tony Stark is portrayed to be an \\"American hero\\" going out to fight \\"cliche terrorists\\", like the promos made it seem. Personally, I am glad for this- while The Mandarin may have been a well written comic character, a \\"terrorist\\" movie has no place in the American media after the previous decade's elections. A terrorist is an insensitive idea, and, quite frankly, the way the promotions were HINTING at a \\"terrorist\\" really put me off. When it turned out that there was no foreign named terrorist, I became more interested. The Iron Man movies are not \\"Tony Stark vs the world,\\" no, each one has been a political statement, a slap to the face- Tony Stark does not go out and fight bad guys from everywhere else, no, he saves America from itself- and Iron Man 3 is the best example of that.<br /><br />I was very glad to go into the theater (I was kind enough to be invited to a midnight release) and see a movie that delved deeper into Tony Stark, himself. This movie shows how Tony Stark is recovering from the events in \\"New York\\"; Tony is even more messed up than before- worse than his initial kidnapping way back in the first Iron Man. It shows the man outside the suit- his life, those important to him, and how Tony is trying to get that back under control. The suits have become a habit, a hobby- he may be Iron Man, but Tony Stark has his own needs, emotional and psychological. Instead of some foreign power causing trouble, the root of the movie's peril comes from within the US, within someone in Tony's own memories. Tony is fighting himself in more ways than one- psychologically and physically, in that Aldrich Killian represents one of Tony's past mistakes.<br /><br />This movie is far better than most people are saying; please, ignore the \\"misleading\\" trailers and look into the product, itself. Marvel has done their characters justice yet again; IM3 deserves praise.
B0082Z447U|5.0|This was rather a long read, and written in the 1800's so it was a bit slow going with Victorian-style writing and length but it was worth it.  It has a lot to offer in a story intrigue, mysterious death, birth, poisoning, romance  it is fascinating, I really enjoyed it.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Wondered where it would lead and it was all around good movie. Worth checking out. The effects were pretty good

B00873GRU4|5.0|Gripping throughout the entire book. Its about humans living underground in silos and their evolution throughout the centuries.The questions left are obviously how and why they are living as they do.Howey has developed the characters as in a &#34;who done it&#34;book as we are left wondering who can we trust? Very well written ,couldn't put it down.
B002MFULQO|4.0|It never did seem right! After all these years the government is finally admitting there had to be more than one shooter. This movie is a great insight into who the others may have been and why. That is something the government certainly is NOT sharing!
B009FRS9CA|4.0|Smaller size but good in details.It's Japanese version I think.It's almost perfect only it's smaller and lighter than I thought.And the biggest  weakness of this figure is the cap,it's too light.
B00DFFI7K2|2.0|We watched it because of our niece and nephew..... it was silly but entertaining for the kids. While t was violent, I was not graphic. There was some good humor incorporated into the movie for the adults at times.... not enough to keep my attention though.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I am not one for reading very many books, or did I think I could benefit from reading a book on marriage considering my girlfriend and I are dating. I was wrong. Single, dating, or married, this book has opened my eyes to a whole different perspective on how our significant others want and need to be treated, including myself. Do yourself a life changing favor, read this book!!

B005ERWYH6|2.0|the CD was great, that's why I wanted it, but it arrived with a cracked case, although listed in good condition, did not arrive that way, but the CD played.
B0040I09RM|4.0|Great plot development and decent characters.  Multiple story lines keep your attention.  A little violence, but this is, after all, a show about a biker gang.  Looking forward to the next seasons.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|For Tom Cruise, better than usual. It had some Sherlock Holmes moments which I like, and Rosemund Pike is always the hottest thing. Not as good as she was in Surrogates, but good eye candy..

B0013TXA5Y|5.0|What a great intro to the movie!  Very interesting book, without reading it I would not have enjoyed the movie as much as I did.  Good beginning to what seems like a great series of adventures.  I can't wait to start the next book!
B005MLOOJA|5.0|Even after watching these lead actors in teach if heir former highly rated tv series, it is still almost impossible to believe they aren't the people they portray in The Good Wife.  Such a well done series. The plots are great too.
B002NNA9N0|5.0|Great acting throughout.  Alan Arkin and other supporting actors added to the strength of the main guys - Lemmon, Pacino, Spacey.

B001NYTUXU|5.0|If, at some point in time after 2002, one was a small child who liked horses, then it is exceedingly likely that one watched a certain movie about a specific animated horse not just once, but many, or perhaps even several, times. If so, than this product is the gateway to reclaiming the joy and wonder one felt when thinking about horses, lost now for many years behind the fog of responsibilities and singers who are not Bryan Adams. This is the soundtrack from a film about an animated horse. That is certainly what it is.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|One of our families all time favorites. Watch it on an HD television to increase the experience.  Our kids sing and dance to many of the musical renditions.

B00BGIBVP8|2.0|watched it, not really funny but was trying to be funny. A little bit of a waste of time. Oh well
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Good game, play-wise.  I started it for the armor - very excellent builds on the armor, very nice graphics and 3D views.  Missions are fairly straight forward dodge and shoot with the speed increasing the further you advance.  Survivability on the early stages is difficult due to low hit points and increasing odds that you'll either smash into something or something will actively try to smash into you.  Increasing experience opens the options on newer armors with more power and greater survivability, which makes it more enjoyable to play.<br /><br />Game isn't too blatant about begging for your money with upgrades, but real money purchases are available if you want to skip the drag on advancement and go right to the snappy armor.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I hope this is the beginning of a long run for this series of movies!<br />Watch this movie; its that good!

B00ARF93AQ|4.0|A lot of action, maybe too many dying and blowing up that took away from story line but overall I liked it
B002SGYPS2|5.0|Has to be seen to understand the scope of this film, We are all to a certain degree live in a bubble without full control of our lives. Trueman's revelation and escape from a forced existance was heart warming and very satisfying. A must see and over and over.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I am so enthralled with this series.  I was completely shocked by the season finale!!!!  If you haven't watched Downton Abbey, I suggest you do so.  You wont be let down.  With the period setting and not just know what is going on with the family but the servants as well keeps you watching through the last minute.
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|The greatest series ever on TV .I love this series and as they go on from year to year and the budget gets bigger and bigger it only gets better and better.
B00932A4XE|3.0|This was a cute, romantic comedy. The whole family enjoyed watching the different stories and situations of couples and what they went though to obtain a child.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I  found this to be an easy read, yet it kept my attention from begining to end.  She did a great job of wrapping up the 3 books and I would recommend this book to anyone.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great series!  Can't wait for Season 4 to start. The opulence of those days plus the interactions of the characters provide several sub-stories of their own.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|Really thought the idea was dumb when I heard about it. What a great story. Quick read. Great anticipation. Really liked this book.  Laughed and cried. End was predictable but satisfying. Would read another of his books

B000W4KSVA|5.0|I had this album as a 331/3 vinyl. My album became too bulky and cumbersome. But the tunes on this cd stuck in my mind ,as did John Coltranes tender renditions of these classic tunes. These were tunes recorded prior to Coltrane\\"s \\"conversion\\" (which I loved also) with his \\"Love Supreme\\" and what followed. I just plain love it.
B0063IH60K|4.0|More to it than I expected.  It is very simple and a great way to fill in time waiting for an appointment.
B00BCZU8WM|3.0|It's just OK.  Heard a lot of good things, so I bought.  Have a bit of buyers regret.  Thought it would grow on me and just hasn't.  Some of the songs go on and on.
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|Pretty good CGI which made for beautiful scenery.. A few funny moments/lines. Overall, just average but it passed an evening well enough.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|Do you know why I loved the music from the movie so much?  Because these were actors, not trained professional singers, that brought the rough emotion of the moment into the songs.  So many have slammed Russell Crowe, but he is one of the one's I loved the best.  Stars is amazing, with his grit and emotion of the moment.  Jackman makes us forget the Wolverine for a bit and there is a reason why Hathaway won the Oscar.  Her rendition of I Dreamed a Dream is so heart breaking, it takes the song to a whole new level.  Amazing music sung amazingly.
B0001CCY7E|5.0|Love it

B00D7Z4GQY|1.0|This book had promise.  I liked that it was written from the viewpoint of several characters.  It was interested to discover their World from their own unique points of view.  However, the main characters just weren't extremely likeable, and the plot.....<br /><br />There is a husband with a secret.  And, it's completely and totally predictable what the secret is.  And completely and totally predictable what the characters will do about it.<br /><br />And about the \\"love triangle\\" in the book - none of that rang true for me at all.  None of the reactions, how it was handled, the end results...just completely not plausible to me.  I was hoping for some twist in the ending just to make reading thisbook worthwhile - it didn't come.  I should have stopped reading and moved on.<br /><br />But I won't give up on this author yet.  The different viewpoints were interestingly done.  I would hope with a bit more likeability to the characters, and a better plot, a good book is in there!
B000000WFZ|5.0|Love it
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|LOVE this series.  Wonderfully refreshing and a much needed alternative to all of the currently popular reality shows.  ENJOY all seasons!!!
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Ok, I am hooked... who did it?...and there are more twists and turns each episode!  When I missed one recording, I was grateful to be able to get it via Amazon Prime!
B002MFULQO|5.0|It's a long movie with some great acting, but it really hits the nail on the head with what is going on in our country then and now.  Cover ups and deception.  I always believed the assassination of JFK was a conspiracy anyway.  This movie was made in 1991 about what happened in 1963 and it really shows what and how our government can do just about what ever it wants regarding what it wants the people in our country to know.
B003Q6D2BE|5.0|Retired & Extremely Dangerous:  The cast was AWESOME!!!  The movie is a lot of fun if you are over 40, I am!  Seeing this all star cast play the good guys, shoot em up and bang bang, love in the making, a good time being had by all, and &#34;grandpaw&#34; still kicking butt in such a playful movie.  Went to see RED 2, just about as fun. I might not have liked it 15 years ago, but I love it now!  I bought it, my kids (36 or 32), I don't know which one, took it home, and I bought it again!  Too funny!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|One of the best TV series that I follow - and i follow a lot. Great cast of characters. I want more! I want more!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Great game! The graphics are beautiful and its easy to figure out how to maneuver around. Glad I got this for my Kindle Fire.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|What 21st century WAR Really must feel like. The fear, the killing, the brutality all of this was portrayed in this book. Thank you Chris Kyle, for giving us such a vivid look at what it is like being a Navy Seal fighting for America.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|Great story line and lots of fun to read.  I really liked the book, though I really doubt some of the thought processes and intelligence the book gave to the dog.  Don't think so, but fun anyway.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Wanted to try something I heard about but didn't know anything about. I chose this show and was happy I did. I like the characters and story line. Now on season 2.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Addictive game and very fun and challenging...I would recommend this to anyone. I loved to figure out the combinations and puzzles.
1401223176|5.0|This maybe one of the best graphic novels ever, not just a batman story. I highly encourage you to buy this and enjoy.
B00ECU2SGS|4.0|the story was a little different, but the acting was good. Glad we decided to watch it. couples will like it
B002HSSAY6|4.0|If you like westerns and Henry Fonda. you'll like this film. With it's  beautiful landscapes. Make you wish you were there.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I stumbled upon this show and from the first episode, it's really good!  Can't wait for the third season to be added to AmazonPrime.
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|A good shot them up blood and guts type movie. I enjoyed it and most like will watch it again,
B00DL47RQ2|5.0|This is clearly one of Woody Allen's best films, and a case can be made that it is in fact his best. It is also among his very best acted films. If Cate Blanchett does not win an Oscar for her lead, it will be proof that acting doesn't count as much anymore as it should in Oscar picks.<br /><br />Cate plays a character that is not ordinarily the object of much empathy or compassion: the wife of a big-time, financial crook (played under Allen's direction with great credibility and balance by Alec Baldwin). Here however, you cannot help but feel every ounce of her pain as she struggles mightily to survive the ordeal of falling from having it all to being penniless by way of being spotted by a close friend selling shoes in a store where they once shopped together. Throughout, the nominally \\"comedic relief\\" does not provide relief at all. Under Allen's script and direction, it sharply intensifies this woman's relentless pain. \\"Pain\\" may indeed be too soft a word for the daily agony she endures from her past, her present circumstances, her choices all along the way, and from the men with whom she comes into contact. While her circumstances are her own, under Allen's script and direction, her intense shame is universally discomforting.<br /><br />Were this the substance of Allen's film, it might be viewed as merely a cautionary tale, encouraging women to better understand what exactly their husbands do for a living. However, there is much, much more going on. Sally Hawkins gives a performance that shows us the plight of another woman in the person of the adopted sister of Cate's character. She is with no particular gifts, tastes, or morals, yet she remains a sensitive and profoundly vulnerable individual, worthy of our compassion. I suspect that Allen uses her character to broaden the pathos from one individual woman to the gender as a whole. The main story revolves around Cate's character, but it becomes so intertwined with the story of Sally's that it appears to be about two very different women representing the foibles that lead to the bad choices of all women, and to their mistreatment by men.<br /><br />This viewer walked out of the film emotionally drained, wondering if this was one of the best dramas he had seen in decades, AND wondering whether it belonged in his collection of best dramas. It is a hard movie to watch for all the right reasons. The characters are tough and well drawn. The acting is superb to the point that you cease to believe you are watching a film (until one scene, when you realize that Cate should have a lock on the Best Actress Oscar).<br /><br />Do not take the kids to see this film, and do what you can to remember that a film of equal emotional weight could be made showing how men are just as vulnerable and just as devastated by their choices, and by their callous mistreatment by women. In the end, we are all made vulnerable by our attachments to the illusory pleasures of life, and we are all victimized by the failure of others to treat us with the same empathy, compassion, and generosity they want from us. Allen may not have packed all this into Blue Jasmine, but on the other hand, he very well may have. See the film and decide or yourself.
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|Most excellent series. If you love space type action adventure movies and shows I highly recommend watching. Over the years I have watched every series at lease twice, And now I'm watching them all fir the 3rd time. They never seem to get old. When SYFY dropped the series. I truly believe they made a huge mistake.
1400052181|5.0|I do not write reviews!!!!  But I loved the book Good book on race in America,  and I would recommend it.  Joyce
B009NLC1D6|5.0|What can I add about a man of Peace and his love for humanity. A must watch movie. read the book first it make the movies so much better.
B00DLKXF3A|5.0|Update after a few days with this album - I wasn't really expecting it but Hail to the King has really blown me away after the numerous plays in my car and home stereo. I honestly can say this is a cd I'll be listening for quite some time. Highly recommend at this point. Buy the deluxe version for sure, St. James is worth it!<br /><br />Original thoughts after a day with the album - I'm a fan of Avenged Sevenfold, really enjoying all of their previous releases. No other way to describe this cd than it being their Black Album. Really, from the change in concept to the sound (understandably, as Rev was a/the main writer), it mimics the changes Metallica made at that time and for the most part it works very well. Speaking of the sound... it's great. Vocals, guitars, bass, drums... they all are extremely clear, tight, and sound excellent when played loud. The songs really do come alive the louder they get on a good system. Buy the album and please use something other than the crappy earphones that came with your phone.<br /><br />I'm really enjoying the cd so far - right now, requiem, heretic and coming home are the faves. The others are no slouches though, and hold their own easily. All across, vocals are catchy, rhythm guitars are heavier than ever, leads are what I've come to expect, but unfortunately for me, while the new drummer is obviously very talented, i feel the style used is a bit too 'boring' for what I'm used to from a7x. Rev changed tempo and direction often, with plenty of fills. Really kept things interesting and was a great compliment to the guitar work. Then they had Portnoy fill in for Nightmare, who easily pushed that style further. Drums on Hail to the King have gone in the complete opposite direction. I understand the songs themselves have simplified and changed in style, but there are too many times that i'm listening to these songs and can hear some nice fills and changes in my head, but they never materialize. I'm guessing this was more of a decision by the band than solely by him - After a bit of reading, this was the case. I'm hoping they can let him have more creative input on the next album.<br /><br />In the end, Hail to the King is a solid release from what in my mind, is one of the most talented groups that has standing mainstream success. Not an easy feat for my favorite genre. There is a lot of 80s/early 90s metal referenced, which i love. Varying by song, you can easily hear the influences from Metallica, GNR, Megadeth, Maiden, Ozzy/Sabbath and i'm sure others. What I'm interested to see is where the band goes from here. Hoping they can find a good mix of the prior speed and complexity with their new heavy. Just please please please do not follow Metallica's path after their Black Album!
B00DPH7QFM|4.0|First of all while the description on Amazon says nothing about this, but the DVD credits state that the picture and sound have been restored! (They even name the individual who did it) This can be confirmed by watching the DVD! Much better resolution than the boots circulating for all these years. So, picture and sound are excellent! (although remember this was 20 plus years ago) DTS Surround is no revelation but is reasonable. You will not be dissappointed in those elements. That said, for anyone who's never seen this show there is some odd strobe lights that are a little annoying and contribute to a bit of a busy effect visually. Surely it was impressive live, but on DVD it's a little bit irksome during the first few tunes. The sound mix is close to perfect.<br /><br />The camera work is good throughout though..no quick MTV style editing. Patient and reasonable with the camera edits.<br /><br />I must say Doogie White is spot on vocally. *Another reviwer took issue for my praise of White's performance here. One can be nostalgic about Rainbow vocalists, as they all had their moments, but it is intellectually unfair to compare Doogie to Ian Gillan and David Coverdale. Doogie represents Rainbow at this time, not twenty years earlier! How would Coverdale or Gillan do on \\"Ariel\\"? or the songs from this era? (For me there's a big difference here from watching Ian Gillan struggle with notes and reading lyrics off the floor many years earlier on \\"Hell or High Water\\" dvd!) \\"Hunting Humans\\", \\"Ariel\\", and \\"Black Masquerade\\" make my point and tell the story of Doogies capabilities on the DVD.<br /><br />The keyboardist Paul Morris is amazing. Rainbow has had some great keyboard players but this guy towers over David Stone in an improvisational sense. Watching Stone do his solo spot on the Munich DVD is sad. I always liked Tony Carey for his sound and aggressive style and Don Airey as well, but Morris is really good.<br /><br />The bassist Greg Smith is excellent on this ,and is the best backup singer Rainbow ever had. (by far)<br /><br />Blackmore plays well but really takes it up a couple notches by \\"Temple of the King.\\" After that he gets significantly more inspired and plays amazing! Especaiily on \\"Black Masquerade\\" and \\"Ariel.\\" *There are no long drawn out guitar solo segments like the intros on the Munich DVD.<br /><br />No extras with the DVD but it is a great long set! (Thus the 4 stars) * Would love to have seen the Japanese TV footage of Doogie and Blackmore with the acoustic guitar doing a promo for the album. That would have been a great bonus feature. If you haven't seen this you really should check it out- really cool!><br /><br />[...]<br /><br />I have no regrets in buying this. I highly reccomend this to any Blackmore fan. Thank you for releasing it and please continue the Deluxe Edition Rainbow CD's!<br /><br />(Two flaws..there is no \\"sixteenth century greensleeves.\\" There's kind of a joke version of Greensleeves about drinking but not at all like the album version so don't count on that.) Also there is a snippet of extraneous audio that creeeps in almost as if the into tape re-fires, but it only lasts like 20 seconds so it's not really that big a deal. Kind of sounds like someone turning on a tv in the backgroud while your watching. Short issue. * I don't recommend judging this DVD by listening to the CD of the show. They recently released a CD version and the problem is that this has show has a very live mix to it. It's ROCKPALAST people! Not exactly stet of the art!I think people are doing DVD reviews here having only listened to the audio. It doesn't hold together well as a CD.is the best backup singer Rainbow ever had.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|it does what its supposed to do and it does it good, installation was a breeze, the only downside is that if you are using Chrome to cast it has to stay in full screen mode to be full screen on the TV, other apps like or websites like youtube don have that problem, overall Im very happy with it.
B009GED3HS|2.0|HIMYM used to be my husband and I's favorite show and around season 5 it started to lose it's luster and comicality. Barney's character seems to be getting more and more disgusting and Ted's ongoing quest to find the perfect wife has gone on WAY too long. They are both pathetic in their own way. It has now become harder to enjoy their once endearing qualities. The jokes just don't seem as funny anymore and it's absolutely degrading toward women. I'm not sure if I even want to bother watching the final season. Which is too bad because I feel like I've invested so much time to the characters and I want to know who Ted marries. I'm just not sure I can sit through another episode of foul jokes and crude situations.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I loved this book. I found myself reading it for hours. She write in a way that makes one identify with her and with yourself.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|It's such a great read. It's so incredible to read her memoirs and I couldn't help but fall in love with her fellow inmates. I thoroughly enjoyed it! The show is incredible too! The director decided to take liberties with her story, but it's still interesting to see some of the things come to fruition on-screen. Again, it's a great read.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Those non-academic types interested in the historical correctness and history of the New Testament will very much enjoy Aslan's book. The information about Jesus' life and times really is pretty interesting, new, and well-researched. Aslan has a concise, readable writing style, unlike the dry, academic prose one usually finds with these kinds of works.<br /><br />Those who have studied the Bibleas-history and as-literature will probably not find much they haven't already known or read something about, but I don't think this book purports to be an academic work. People who wish to explore something of the historicity of Christianity, for whatever reason, and don't want to wade through the lengthy texts of academia, will learn something they didn't know--in fact, quite a bit--with Aslan's book.
B003477DVK|5.0|Great story for children that may feel different, lonely and bullied. Skip was a difference maker for the whole community.<br />Not a real dog lover myself, but the story and skip touched my heart as I watched the movie with my grandsons, Cooper & Bennett.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|This game is challenging and fun, but I was billed for a Truckload of Tokens that I did not purchase or receive.  I e-mailed Gameloft through the ap and was told that they couldn't help me, and that I needed to contact Amazon.  Rather than credit me for something I didn't receive, Amazon told me that they would make a one-time exception and refund my money for an &#34;unintentional&#34; purchase and that my tokens were probably stuck in the developers server. Do I dare play the game again since I've used my &#34;one exception&#34;?
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|I am concerned about being able to watch future segments. Access is unclear.<br />How can get to see the current chapter of this excellent series?
B00D41AJ7G|4.0|fun game.....but I would like to see more levels! Over all the game kept me busy in those dull moments!
B000QUUD60|5.0|It was awesome! No complaints! Just buy it. You'll totally love it i promise. It was worth every single penny!!
B0041D843M|4.0|I liked this book and it has made me seriously consider a plant based diet. I had the Kindle version so I'm not sure if some things that he refers to (in terms of studies, etc.) can be read easier in the paper book. For a book like this, I actually recommend not buying the Kindle version. This book is packed with information and although I love my Kindle, I really felt I needed the book itself to make notes and to put post-it notes on so that I could follow-up on the information and perhaps check his sources. So many books on nutrition today make all kinds of claims with reference to absolutely NO studies. Campbell's study is intriguing although I'm not sure that I am convinced that animal protein causes cancer based on his study alone. That's why having the hard copy would have been helpful. I may still buy it. I do highly recommend this book. Campbell is an impressive fellow and his accomplishments are as well.

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is probably one of the best shows on TV in the last 10 years. Everything about is is outstanding, from the cast to the writing to the filmography.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|This is really a fun addictive game and when you first play it you think it's easy but it's really not
B00992CF6W|3.0|This is a great game it just needs more stuff like more diamonds and there needs to be caves there isnt any one here if there was this game would be great
B004EC5IUW|5.0|Watched the series in less then a week and jumped right in with the new wave of movies. Great retelling of the series follows a different timeline than the show or an alternate universe. Amazing animation over all couldn't be happier.
B00846REIS|5.0|When i first started reading this, i was a bit hesitant. However, this turned out to be an amazing series, that I fell in love with more than 50 Shades. I cannot wait for the 4th book to come out, I couldnt put the other three down!

B0050SYS5A|4.0|Most of the time it works.... It definitely shrinks the area needed in order to play, but sometime i feel like it cuts you off at times.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This is an interesting hidden objects game. You are not doing the same scene over and over but there are a variety of scenes. My only complaint is that some of the objects are small or seem to fade into the background too easily so that I have to continue to enlarge my screen in order to find them on my Kindle Fire. It is a good game and one I will enjoy for a while. It is not a quick one that can be finished in less than 30 minutes but does require patience to play.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I used to be a fan of the Weather Channel app but since TWC updated, AccuWeather is the app for me. It gives me the info I need without constantly giving me &quot;achievements&quot;(read &quot;ads). As far as I'm concerned it's a good place to get the forecast.
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|Trying to hard to be &#34;quirky&#34; (a la Tim Burton movies) but didn't take it far enough for it to be funny or effective.  Too bad, I had high hopes based on the trailers.
B001HN6922|5.0|this was a wonderful present for my son.. he is such a fan and he loves the movie! thanks for the fast shipping
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is not a game that you will rush right through, it takes time, patience and perserverance to find the escape on each level. Thought provoking gameplay, but not impossible by any means.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|A lot better than I expected- I will probably play for quite a few months. The game is pretty cute, and teaches you how to play as you go as well as right at the beginning
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I love the story but someone please tell me when the next book is out. I have been waiting to see how this story ends.
B0079TQHDO|4.0|It's the first book I have read of Jeffrey Archer and I enjoyed the story and will look forward to reading more.

B000AJIF4E|5.0|I know there are a zillion reviews on these headphones and people probably won't get to my review, but I love these headphones so much, I had to write a review.  My first ever \\"professional\\" headphones was a pair of what I believe to be an older version of this model.  I used them for a good 20 years until they finally fell apart. Since then I have tried a variety of cans including Bose, behringer, and JVC.  For the price,  The sound on these 'phones is AWESOME. Big bass sound, but tight and clean.  Nice clear mids, crisp highs.  The cups cover your ears and provide as much sound isolation as you'd want (they're not active noise reducing). You also don't get that weird pressure wave that many active sound isolating headphones have. Here's the pro /con breakdown:<br /><br />PROS:<br />*GREAT sound! I'd put these up against headphones three times this price. Big bass sound, clean and tight, not boomy. Clear mids and crisp clean highs.<br />*pretty darn comfortable (I have a big melon) I've been wearing them for 3 hours straight and have no discomfort, no cauliflower ear, no sweaty ears.<br />*good sound isolation - since they cover your ears, they block out most outside sounds to my satisfaction. you can still hear sounds, but you can't make out details.<br />*Reasonably priced - I paid about $90<br />*comes with a 1/8 plug and 1/4 adaptor for those of you who still have old school a/v equipment that still requires 1/4 jacks (I think that's more for plugging into a console since they ARE designated as \\"professional\\")<br />*The fold up reasonably compactly, for as big as they are.<br />*comes with a handy drawstring \\"pleather\\" carrying case.<br /><br />CONS:<br />*Long dangly curly cord (ok, that's not REALLY a con, but I had to come up with something)<br />*Because of their size and propensity to block outside sounds, I wouldn't recommend these for any kind of outdoor use. These are great for home or work where you aren't moving a lot. I do see people out and about with larger headphones on,(say on the bus or subway) but I wouldn't try jogging with these.th larger headphones on,(say on the bus or subway) but I wouldn't try jogging with these.
B00BW5K5DO|5.0|Good fun, easy to play and understand.  Worthless the small  amount to get the full game.<br />Good for times when you are stuck waiting for someone.
B00BQ1D7BQ|3.0|KWSB Fan Review:<br />10 tracks to this album; Kenny sings on 4, Stephen Stills sings 6.<br />High Points:  Kenny delivers the strongest vocal performance of his career on this record. Frankly, I was pleasantly surprised at how confident and authoritative his vocals sound.  In particular, Kenny handles vocals on the two strongest songs on the album; \\"Honey Bee\\" and \\"Talk To Me Baby\\".  \\"Roadhouse\\" has a nice driving rhythm...not a run of the mill blues song.<br />Best songs:  Roadhouse, Honey Bee, Talk To Me Baby<br />Other points:  All of the KWS guitar work is excellent.  The solos on \\"Honey Bee\\" and \\"Roadhouse\\" are album standouts.  \\"Can't Get Enough\\" sounds very similar to \\"Heat of the Sun\\" from KWS' \\"How I Go\\" album.  Great drums from Whipper Layton throughout the album.<br /><br />Why three stars?  I like Stephen Stills guitar work and respect his musical ability and achievements.  If I hear \\"Suite: Judy Blue Eyes\\", or \\"For What It's Worth\\" on the radio, I'll listen for a few minutes before changing the station.  But, sorry, I'm not a fan of liberal ramblings in song, of which there is plenty on this album.  This album is certainly not a new \\"Super Sessions\\" as it has been tagged in some places.  Just look at the names of some of the cover songs on the album:  \\"Search and Destroy\\" (c'mon Kenny...poor choice), \\"Rockin' in the Free World\\", and you get my drift.  The album closes with \\"Word Game\\" which is nothing more than a rant that sounds at once obnoxious AND outdated.<br /><br />To summarize...I don't regret buying this album because I am a KWS fan and he does not disappoint on this album.  There are 3-4 good songs on the album...I will enjoy it in the future with plenty of track skipping.  Now anxiously awaiting the next KWSB album...

B007BVOEPI|1.0|Sorry. I just didn't like this. The first episode started off great, and then it just went down hill from there. I don't need lots of nudity and incest. I will not be watching any more episodes.
B008ROZAQU|5.0|First saw this when it came out many years ago and I never get tired of watching it. A nice<br />clean movie to watch over and aver again.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|I was expecting a typical brainless sci-fi action schlock film, and that's not what this is. Yes, there is some action, but it is very well thought out and shot. The vehicle design is what really impressed me in this movie. The ship that Tom Cruise flies around in is very practical and is actually something you could see being used in real life. The story is great and I found myself really caring about the characters and what was going to happen. There are enough twists to keep you interested and guessing, and the payoff is great.<br /><br />The visuals are absolutely stunning. This is one of those rare films where you don't think &#34;that looks fake&#34;. Everything looks real, and the locations..my god the locations...A lot of work went into finding the perfect locations for this film. They do such a good job of merging locations with built sets that you forget you are watching fiction. I can't say enough good things about this movie.
B001NLL93W|5.0|This book is no exception to the others, it was well written and the world just jumps  out at you. I will keep reading all of them so far!
B00AEFY6ZQ|5.0|My daughter loves animals. This was a perfect movie for her!  She very much enjoyed watching it with our family.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I think i am going to be obsessed with this series because i can't seem to get enough. I am a normal guy but this makes me into a geek and i can't stop reading and my time fly's by when i read this book.
B00E5Q1LTY|4.0|I enjoyed the story line, action, and music.  The actor who played &#34;Khan&#34; could have done much better.  Yet it was a fun movie just to sit back and watch.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Sure many people would say its unoriginal but i disagree, she has combined some of the greatest types of sci fi writing together in a seamless action packed book that is fun to read and leaving me wanting more I am infatuated with the book series and love the description that makes the world come to life. I don't normally get into books this much but i love it and i may end up reading more than just this series but the books that tie in as well!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I couldn't get enough of this book!  Loved the twists and turns.  It takes a lot to keep my interest and this one I could not put down.  Took it on a cruise and couldn't wait to get back to my room to read it! :) LOL!  I guess I could've saved some money on the cruise and just lounged at my pool with this book!
B0091REZMW|3.0|dont like you have to wait for coins to play the game  oh well its free thats what you get
B0036S4B6M|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this one.  I love reading but it is hard to hold my interest most of the time.  Not with this book!  Piper did a great job narrating the good, bad and ugly of everything she went through.  I couldn't wait to hurry back to the book.  I can't wait to watch the series now.
B005ZB91KY|5.0|The movie has a good story line in addition to the action that you would expect from a Marvel comic book that they turned into a movie.  Some comic book characters that they have made into movies have little substance, with mostly action and not a lot of story.  There is a real plot in this movie that takes the viewer back to where it all began to show how Captain America became Captain America.  If you liked the Spiderman movies, you will probably like this one.
193700788X|3.0|Wow, many reviewed this book! I almost didn't read it. I did check it out of the library. I spend way too much money on Amazon to waste it on a book with bad reviews. I read hundreds of books per year, so I won't even download a free book unless it has at least four stars. There are too many good books available for me to waste time on bad ones. However, I am just as invested in this series as anyone else. I've unfortunately read the series four times. The last time was the killer and true for two other series as well. I guess I kept waiting for the characters to mature, because I loved them. After the fourth time, I sort of didn't like them anymore. Too whiny!<br /><br />I haven't reread the reviews for this book in awhile, so I don't remember much about them except people are pissed that the story is ending, how the story was turning out, and that Charlaine Harris was a lazy writer. I agree with the lazy writer part. She repeats dialog like it's a macro in her word processing program. She can't keep familial relationships straight, or she couldn't in the earlier books.<br /><br />As far as the story goes, this is one of my favorites in the series, I think. Sookie didn't whine so much and seemed happier in her own skin. Did I like the way the relationships were written? Meh! Whatever. Eric was going to have to leave, Bill was old news, every other man she was ever drawn to was unavailable but Sam. I think CH wrote herself into a corner. I never felt enough chemistry between Sam and Sookie for them to hook up in a real affair. Both of them are drawn to dangerous partners but neither are dangerous on their own. They'll get bored and part friendly. I say Sam is rebound guy. Since this is the last book, guess we'll never know.<br />The mystery was good. I didn't know who the worse villain was until he was revealed. Since I hadn't reread the other books in quite awhile, I struggled to remember all of the bad guys, which was a good thing.<br />So many characters from previous books made an appearance I couldn't help but be aware that this was a final book. The ending was not that final, though, so I was wondering if it really was the final book. I liked it, which is more than I can say about the True Blood TV series, which has me constantly saying \\"wtf?\\" Except that this past year, the sixth season, is so Great!
B00D0OR5EC|2.0|I found this book to be quite unfulfilling for a number of reasons:<br /><br />1. There is a distinct lack of feelings and emotions in the writing. It is simply a series of random anecdotes and observations of life in a psychiatric unit. Perhaps this style was adopted to reflect the disassociation that Kaysen felt at the time. However the effect is that we feel no connection with the character and no attachment to the story.<br /><br />2. The writing is extremely simplistic in parts - almost \\"she said this then I said that\\"<br /><br />3. In the final chapter Kaysen contemplates about how she feels she is a \\"Girl Interrupted\\". It turns out to be one of the few parts that is truly self-reflective and insightful. (It is an apt and clever name for the book too!!). However the overwhelming feeling is that the reader is almost abandoned with the abrupt ending. So whilst some self-reflection and analysis is introduced towards the end, it is just \\"too little too late.\\"<br /><br />I would only recommend this book to someone who is interested in a very superficial glimpse of mental health issues and / or daily life in a psychiatric institution.
7119005901|5.0|First off... I won't waste your time in writing a review on the Three Kingdoms - I'm assuming that if you're reading this review, you're already aware of just how important/incredible/enjoyable this novel is.  Truly a great entertaining story and yet so many lessons can be learned from it.  It's no wonder why this is so widely taught in most Asian school systems.<br /><br />I will, however, comment on this specific 4-volume package.  This is arguably the best packaged-set available (at this time) for those that want to read the novel.  It's not a &#34;collector's edition&#34; - there's no leather binding or any other high-end detail associated with it, but rather it is a simple and convenient set.<br /><br />Unlike other versions being sold, it is somewhat smaller (I believe the dimensions are already displayed in the item details) - so it is very convenient to carry around (e.g. read on the subway, train, plane, etc).  It's broken up into 4 volumes (page numbers are continuous - so volume II starts on p597) and the overall quality is actually pretty good.  It's your typical paperback book.<br /><br />Prior to purchasing, I read a number of reviews complaining of how &#34;thin the paper was&#34; and that it made it &#34;completely unreadable.&#34;  I did not find this to be an issue.  Yes, the paper is probably thinner than one would expect... but nothing where it poses a threat of being damaged easily or anything of the sort.  I also didn't find any issues with being able to see the lettering on the subsequent page (as its shadow is visible on the page you're reading).  Yes, it's there and yes, it's noticeable (especially when there a poem - as the poems are indented); but again, I didn't find it to be an issue.<br /><br />I debated back and forth on what &#34;version&#34; I wanted to purchase and I can honestly say that I'm quite pleased with this purchase.  It's good quality, it's packaged nicely in a boxed 4-volume set (each volume has notes at the end - so no need to search for notes in another book; as is the case with other versions), it's the unabridged version (a MUST - please avoid any abridged version - as they often leave out so much), and it's affordable (complete set costs as much as one volume of other sets).  It's also a Moss Roberts translation - something I would recommend.  And it also uses the pinyin Chinese translations (more easily pronounceable - in my opinion).  Nice introduction, good notes throughout, etc... so also a great option for those &#34;studying&#34; the novel.<br /><br />Simply put, if you're looking for a collector's edition that you're going to hand down from generation to generation with leather binding, hand-drawn images, color, etc, etc... obviously this is not the set for you.  But if you're looking for an affordable, compact, convenient, and accurate translation... then this is the one for you.
B005H9B2CE|5.0|Has drama for mom has fantasy for the children and has action for dad!!! It was a great movie night!!!
1609410416|1.0|I absolutely LOVE Ellen Degeneres. I am a huge fan. I bought this to listen to with my friends on a road trip. We were all surprised at how NOT funny it was. We turned it off after about an hour. Don't waste your money! If you want to see something very funny from Ellen try buying her stand up comedy show called \\"Here and now\\". It is Hilarious!
B00BTHV05M|5.0|I've loved Onerepublic for years now. This new album has the quality lyrics I expected and down great and new beats I didn't expect. And for 3.99, it's definitely worth the money!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This was a very fun game to play.I really enjoyed the unique puzzles and how I had to use a lot of critical thinking to get through the game.
B008LVCKH6|4.0|I found this to be a very good read.  The main character leads a Forrest Gump-like existence, rubbing elbows with major historical figures of the last century.  Hard to believe?  Of course.  But that's part of the fun.  Then he gets involved with a bunch of low-rent gangsters, and the comical coincidences start to pile up to great effect.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved this book There is so much to learn from it. It is so well written You are into it from the first page
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great product for simple calculations and the best part is that it is free.  Easy to use.  Try it for yourself.
B006MPKE9O|5.0|Prepare to be blown away by this brilliant crime-thriller-come-mystery novel.<br />It's creepy, funny and organic in nature. You just get swept into the story! One of the few books that made me almost miss my train-stop I was that engrossed.<br /><br />The Good: Thrilling story, wonderful backdrop of Spain<br />The Bad: Bit whimsical in nature<br />The Ugly: The terror and creepiness is thrilling
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|The book held my interest but I wouldn't say I was blown away by it. That is why I gave it only three stars.
B0044KJIHI|4.0|I've been binge watching this show and I admit that is functionally cheesy and over the top. The acting is often ham fisted, the writing is predictable and repetitive. The camera work falls somewhere between utilitarian and lazy. All that being said, as a superman fan I can't think of any other TV show about Supes that is this enjoyable. Of course some episodes and seasons are better than others. I've enjoyed season 10 as we Clark gets closer and closer to putting on the full get up. The episode in which he meets himself in the future is great. Some of the actors do a good job with the quagmire of exposition they're given. Other actors just remind us how poorly written things are with their over acting and wide eyed emoting. I'm looking at you Hawkman. Still it's fun to see superman and other of my favorite heros in action.
B000J159N8|4.0|Great movie that'll humble a person who's never gone to combat or is misinformed about the war in Vietnam.  It is likely to make a person very appreciative that because of these soldiers we will never have to go to battle.
B00006C7G9|4.0|Arrived on time as advertised! It is in Very Good condition for a VHS of it's obvious age. I've enjoyed watching it again..... and you can't beat the price!!
B005LJK3AC|5.0|One of the best movies I have seen in a while. Great humor, GREAT actors, and I would definitely see it again.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|If you like Subway Surfers you'll love this game.  It follows the same format by moving the minion back & forth & jumping & ducking over obstacles while collecting items.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|Maybe because I'm not a huge science fiction fan, I found the story to be less than compelling.  But Gaiman's writing is a pleasure to read, and his descriptions of the supernatural are wonderful.
0385349947|5.0|Research and personal stories makes this a compelling and necessary read for all women. Even if we disagree - it's touches the issues we are all struggling with.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Great product!<br /><br />This is a very useful tool.  It is easy to use and helps to organize notes and reminders.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Real fun game to relax your brain!! Can't wait for new levels! Only had to cheat once. Lol!! Fun times! How will we know when new levels come out??
0345529057|4.0|Arrived before I expected. I'm getting ready for Season 4 of the TV series and wanted to read the book first so I didn't suffer so much, to be prepared.
B00EAIMGDW|5.0|Awesome game, love the controls comical characters and hilarious story this game has something for the whole family to enjoy love it worth the money
031606792X|5.0|It was in great conditions! Arrived on time, and well, I got the other three at Goodwill so I was missing the last one. Worth every penny.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|Let me start off with woooooww great game graphics could be better but the simple controls and fun story line will make u smile
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i taken this game way  far bet if i want to be vet.this is the game for me thanz for making this game
B0055PGUYU|5.0|It is based on experience and experiments from several people, the examples are great, I understood how to change my routines in a scientific maneer and learned a &#34;framwork&#34; to change my habits.<br /><br />Great book, it will change the way you do things.
B00A8GBW3U|5.0|My first Lana Del Rey album. I had high expectations, and it exceeded them. I love most of her music.
0684857219|5.0|Really good condition text is easy to read and I love the book itself, I would recommend this book to anyone into bodybuilding
B002O2THRO|3.0|The styling was lovely and the casting had potential, but it just didn't gel.  Over-directed?  Over-acted?  I don't know, but whatever it was, it was jarring at times.  Worth seeing as a historical footnote, but not as entertainment.
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|this game is very fun how you harvest the plants and water the trees  get to be friends and you can plant them have a jam machine and everything and that's my review about Farm Family Seaside :) .
B0042TV4IW|5.0|This is a very good family show about relationships compassion and tolerance. Characters are well developed and well cast. I recommend it for all ages.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I was quite surprised by how quickly I was hooked on the Good Wife.  Casting couldn't have been more perfect and the writing is superb.
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|don't update it. when I updated it the app wouldn't let me connect to my facebook. I had a whole<br />bunch of rare dragons before I updated it now its useless even playing anymore
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Season one had me hooked, and while I can see where some folks might find the storyline with Will a bit difficult given the title of the show, realize that part of what we're finding out is that there are many different ways to define what makes a &#34;good wife.&#34;  Relationships are messy in real life, too.
B008602KQI|4.0|It's interesting to see what some people think the future could hold for civilizations to come! Hopefully, it will be better than what's portrayed in this film
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am completely, absurdly addicted! It is fun to be taken into such a different world than the one we live in!
B00280LYIC|5.0|This book is over the top awesome so don't make a mistake like I did thinking it was a silly book
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Great little free app. Tells me everything and more than I need to know about  my kindle battery health.  Like it.
B002DEZXOE|4.0|This version on Woodstock has some good additions that the first version didn't have BUT there have been some cuts that the first version had.  Overall, thanks for the new additional material and &#34;why the hell did you cut out material that was in the first version.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Mr. Hosseini is a very talented author who has a knack for developing interesting characters.  None of them are 'perfect' people but somehow endearing and intriguing to the reader.  I found the first two or three chapters challenging until I realized the whole book was a story of from each character's point of view and all wound together in one compelling storyline.  First rate book!
B000E9910W|5.0|AWESOME COLLECTION OF SUPER SOUNDS FROM ONE OF THE BEST BANDS OF ALL TIME. THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST CDS IN MY ENTIRE COLLECTION. SERIOUS ROCK AND ROLL AT IT'S VERY VERY BEST.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|A gripping read, with stories within stories that add to the richness of the tapestry Martin is creating.<br />A must read for all fans of the series.<br />Now to wait for book 6
B00DW39B2K|4.0|They did a good job of acting like they always do and the storyline is very good. Very suspenseful and keep you on the edge of you seat.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Makes you think. Easy, but not too easy. A great way to relax and a nice change from the usual hidden objects games.
B003UAKE9Y|5.0|Love his work. Actually got it for my grand baby....she has good taste in movies ~ got it from her grandma!
B00632HWOG|1.0|the old one worked great! this one locks up ALL THE TIME! I finally removed it and will from this point forward will use GMAIL!
B000OCXI3K|5.0|Love the music and the story. Actors have great chemistry. But who couldn't have great chemistry with Johnny Depp. He is so talented and easy on the eye.
B009WUAK2M|5.0|We all know that with that many bullets and booms everyone is dead. But ignore it and enjoy the silliness.
B00B2QA646|4.0|Kiera knightly does very well and watched this for the great actors and had never read the story.  Wished I had seen on the big screen, the way it is produced, you need the big screen to really enjoy the grandeur of the scenes.  I will watch again... Good, good story.
B00004WEJZ|3.0|I could not finish the movie it started skipping and freezing around chapter 20 could not finish the movie It might be my machine
B007CLSE8K|4.0|This movie was ok. Had some action, some surprise to the plot, great actors...which was the reason I watched. My boys thought it had real good action.
B00005JL0I|5.0|I watched this movie today and it was great I love James Bond movies now I'm working on the next James Bond Roger Moore
B005H9B44A|4.0|Pretty good movie. I've watched all the other super hero movies just hadn't gotten to this one.  Still have to catch captain America to get caught up to speed. Wish I had saw this one on the big screen.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was a great book 2 thumbs up<br />Awesome book that was amazing and now I need to read the next book five stars
1400031001|5.0|I first saw this done as a series on YouTube.  Thought it had a ring of many truths and can see correlations to my life. Well told and moves through the last century telling history from the characters point of view.  To explain to my sister that I share books with, it's like the movie titanic, the main character(s) not real but the history being told around it is. A little naughty in places, but I'm sympathetic to his loss of love and religion. Life as a series of good luck and bad luck. A really good story.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|amaaaaaze omg i loved it sooooo good i totes recommend ! so much drama and action all around great book!
B004UJTG6Q|4.0|While this took place a long time ago, I can see how people could relate to the nonsense and fun that Tom and his friends get into. The drama of his struggles with girls tug at the heart. His various journeys are a trip. There are some lagging parts to the book, but in the end that is probably for the best because they build suspense. With some of the language in the book, it seems to me that it was written for adults who are feeling nostalgic about their youth. It will certainly make one feel young again.
B00AOCLWF6|4.0|I've gotten into this series late into the run but I'm impressed with the story line and production quality. Definitely for sci-fi fans!
B009R54MGW|5.0|Just FANTASTIC!!!! I loved this so much! Writing that pulls you in right from the start, great book to read
B00ENIR864|2.0|Doesn't integrate well with the camera.  When trying to take a picture of the code, the screen is black and unable to take the picture.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This series i mostly historically accurate. It's balanced as far s exploring the lives of each of the characters. The exploration of the servants lives as well as the rich is enlightening. I'm addicted! :)
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|As a child of the eighties it was fun to get immersed back into the memories of the arcade, FM radio, movies, TV and the games and hobby shop! Thanks Mr. Cline and looking forward to your next book.
1476734941|5.0|Who knew i would buy this book for myself and then my husband decides he wants to try the 2 days of lower calories meals. Well, in four weeks he has lost over 6lbs and is thrilled with himself. Lol!<br />This is such an easy plan to follow for busy people.  Eating less for two days of each week is wonderful and we have become so mindful of what foods we now want in our diets everyday. I remind him to drink lots of water in those moments you think your hunger is going to take over. Try it you will like it!
140006922X|5.0|I pre-ordered this book and eagerly awaited its arrival after watching an interview Reza gave to the Daily Show.  It lived up to all the hype I gave it and more.  I loved the context it gave to the bible and think it should be required reading to church going Christians as it gives a wonderful context to the faith and creation of the church.  I love Reza's voice and how the story really propels his conclusions.  Great book.  Super glad I read it.
B000FA5STS|5.0|This book was very complex. I read some reviews that complained that the premise was implausible. That's kind of the great thing about fiction. I had a tough time keeping track off all the players. The good thing about reading on the kindle is the xray feature that helped me refresh my memory of the characters as needed. The story kept me on the edge of my seat until the end. Love this author's stories!!  Gonna look for another one now!
B00358ESI4|5.0|Absolutely a must see. This is as good as Saving Private Ryan.  I though this very well true the the times. Hope you enjoy this movie as much as I did
B003K16P3M|4.0|I can see why people both love and not so much love this series. Me? I adored it! It fulfilled by High Fantasy craving. If I would have read this book at any other time/mood, I doubt I would have liked it as much as I did. :)
B00005R2M3|5.0|Very happy with this cd. Shakira has a great voice. If you are a fan you will like this one.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Pretty typical SEAL book, but a good look into a true American hero's life. Chris Kyle was a great warrior, a loss to our nation, and will be missed by all who love their freedom.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|A delightful and crazy book! I received a free copy from Edelweiss and am very grateful for the gift. Reading it was a great vacation from everyday life. I agree with reviewers who likened parts of it to Forrest Gump only with vodka instead of chocolate. The story moves back and forth from telling the 100 year old man's life story to the present day escape through the window. All parts are full of laughs. Very satisfying ending. Fast and fun read!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game will keep you going for hours....Its so much fun...Love it.. this is most definitely the best running game!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Got me hooked quick. Easy to figure out, funny, n gets challenging. Love it just as my kids do! Great game to have around, thanks!
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|I really like this game, it's alot of fun, holds your in your seat for hours playing!!! So much fun !!!!!!!!!!!!!
B005MLOOJA|5.0|Good acting with lots of interesting characters and on-going drama that doesn't get stale. Interesting court room drama and strategy.
B006IYG5HE|4.0|The unusual plot weaves back and forth between the present and events on the Eastern front in World War II. A little understanding of Norway during that time is helpful but not necessary. The story is tense and holds your interest throughout, and is hard to put down. The book is a translation, but it is smooth and reads easily.
B00ECU34ZM|1.0|Every movie I tried to watch through amazon instant video through xbox has failed to load consistently and therefore un watchable. I would not recommend amazon instant video to anyone.
B00DP3IESY|4.0|This is a entertaining movie. If you are into Sci-FI/action/Adventure movies it's worth the watch. Acting is good and the plot is good.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|This movie is great...you will not leave your seat until its over. The actors make the movie very realistic...what a scary, terrifying event in our history.....done with respect and compassion.
B00EEXST2K|4.0|&#34;Lovelace&#34; is a thoughtful movie that brings you back in time.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  And it was great to see it on Amazon.Com while it's still in theaters!

B005ZOBNOI|3.0|With all the great reviews and emotions on Amazon,  I was expecting so much more , it was ok , that's it
B000YIGNKE|5.0|The dvd in excellent condition and is a great movie. Watched it three times since receiving.  Highly recommend it for viewing and enjoying.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I bought this game for my Samsung galaxy 2 tablet, and really enjoy it. I play it every chance I get. I would definitely recommend it for anyone who likes pattern matching games.
B005PK57IK|4.0|Decent acting and great plots.  I couldn't stop watching.  The characters' profiles are respected to the end which must be difficult to achieve when they all have both good and bad aspects of their personas.
B00DY951RQ|5.0|I alway love \\"Self Portrait\\", was the perfect image of Dylan in this time. Very private music, very close to the bones and very important to know, where was Dylan at this time, and where want to go. Now, many years after everything was clear and everybody knows that this album was really important, and how influenced in his career. If you like Dylan, this Bootleg, nª 10, is necessary to understand him, and this time. The 68 may revolution is ended, and also the flower power is out. Dylan try to connect past and future , and the results is \\"Self Portrait\\". The selection of music includes sessions of \\"Nashville Skyline\\" \\" New Morning\\" and \\"Self Portrait\\". I recommend you the \\"Deluxe Version\\" Why?. Because include the complete Isle of Wight concert and also a super resmatered of  the original album.  This edition included a book with photograph  of this time that can help you to understand the stetics changes in life and music of Dylan. The normal pack with only the two CD is not enough to appreciate this incredible album. Only one thing, why CBS not include the album \\"Dylan\\" in this pack ? Are from this sessions and never was available in CD, I don't know why. Great Deluxe Version.
B004ADF7RO|5.0|Great video and audio quality! Takes me back to my childhood. I love this movie. Watched it on my PS3. Interface is easy to navigate and use.
B005GET448|4.0|Here is a true African of impeccable integrity telling it the way it is - an ongoing tragedy, no less a tragedy despite the well-meaning intent. I won't go into the very persuasive arguments she makes... I will, as a 6th generation African agree that aid has caused far more problems than could have been anticipated. The good news is that there is a far better and more effective way to lift a rich continent out of widespread poverty and share it equitably.
B005544TRQ|4.0|It's a good show, if you like the good wife and Boston legal, you will like this show. The two main characters of the show are likable enough...Harvey, the cocky lawyer, grows on you pretty fast but he's definitely too full of himself and it can get tiresome sometimes. As for Mike, I don't really like the character, he's just ok...the rest of the characters make the show better....story lines are nothing new, similar to other legal dramas...I just started season 2, so far so good
B000ICKPOQ|5.0|I watched the movie and i loved it so i decided to watch the show. The has a good story line that will keep you coming  back for some more.
B00B5P37IG|1.0|Does not work have the time and channels are not what I was looking for!!! Don't waste your time on this product!
B003QSJDZQ|5.0|This movie is great for kids and the adults watching.  It's silly, clever, and the art is very well done.
B0063IH60K|5.0|easy game for spending time and keeping you occupied. Really enjoy card games, they keep the kids focused for some peace and quite time.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Very informative and well written. Story moves along very smoothly, very easy to follow each character. Must read for history buffs.
B00B3N4CWK|3.0|The moral of this movie: sometimes it is okay to break the rules. I was unaware of how liberal this movie was going to be when I started watching it. Be aware that \\"The Cider House Rules\\" is about free-thinking and breaking the law, and it contains adult content (more than I was expecting in a PG-13 movie). I almost quit watching it half-way through, and I most certainly won't be watching it again.
B008KYOCA2|5.0|it keeps every thing organized for me as I am not very good at this. would recommend to anyone with busy schedule
B0091REZMW|4.0|This is a good game , and people who by it can't help but play on it!!!!!  I love Mystery Manor buy it now you won't regret it!!
B004SIIBGU|3.0|looks the same on any platform, whoppidee doo its ebay, if you Must use it on your tablet or phone this is ok. otherwise use a PC
B004KBSQOW|5.0|His sound is so pure that it makes all calm around you.  Too bad he died so young.<br />He is missed.
B004SBULWE|5.0|if you have an android device, this is for you! it kills tasks on the fly to free memory and power
B0063IH60K|3.0|Really love this game/format. The still print ads did not bother me much, but now there are full length video ads that can't be overcome... I'd happily pay for this game to escape the ads.
B005R32L66|2.0|since microsloth bought skype they have been cracking out on rooted or jailbroken devices, so needless to say i dont like DRM at all so i dont like skype, I use Apples Facetime now.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|it is just like I sed in my title, it is a fun game for kids of all ages !
B004EPZ08E|5.0|Lots of twists and turns in this surprising comedy. At first you'll think you know what's going to happen -- but wait, and watch the movie to the very end, including the credits. Several in this extraordinary cast (perhaps especially Jennifer Aniston) step outside their &#34;comfort zone&#34; and display aspects of their personalities and acting skills that may surprise you. I find it difficult to impossible to say which actor is &#34;best&#34; only because so many of them are extremely good.<br /><br />The &#34;R&#34; rating for this movie is for real, and is about the language in particular (when you have a character whose very name can't be mentioned in the trailers and reviews you know you're in that territory). Many qualities of this movie (including the screenplay, the directing and editing, and the superb original score) had to come together for it to be as good as it is -- and they do.<br /><br />This movie is Hilarious. I don't know anything more to say than, if you have not seen this movie you really need to. Especially if you have a Boss who is a Butt.
B00DBQ0AV4|1.0|I was surprised to learn that this is the result of five years of work. In brief: I found AN's latest CD bland, monotonous, boring, and overall unconvincing in the Verdi repertoire. She does not have the requisite Italianate expression, the phrasing is choppy, and the musicianship lefts a lot to be desired. Her top notes are sometimes strained and her low register is seriously underpowered and unattractive. Her voice is getting darker and (to my ears) unpleasantly so. The trills in the coloratura are still questionable. The best pieces are from Lady Macbeth; the worst are Elena's Bolero, Tu che le vanita, and the excerpts from Il Trovatore.<br /><br />For Verdi soprano arias you are better off if you stick with the classics: Callas (for Lady MacBeth), Tebaldi (for Giovanna d'Arco), Caballe (for Il Trovatore and Don Carlo), and Cerquetti (for I Vespri).
B00BCZU8WM|3.0|I like JT But man this has to be one of his weakest albums he ever released. Every song are long and drawn out running at 6 to 8 minutes long. Only one song was good on this album and its mirrors the rest of the tracks were Horrible.<br /><br />I would not Recommend this to Fans Of JT.
B00DRDVHA4|5.0|Great songs and sound. A very powerful voice con ritmo latino que pone a bailar a cualquiera. Soy Boricua y que viva P&#62;R&#62;
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Definitely a soapy series but very addicting!  This season was a little sadder than the other seasons but it will interesting to see where it goes.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Watch all three seasons before it the forth season starts on PBS in January. There are only about eight or nine episodes per season to watch.
B000068PQ0|5.0|Delivered faster than expected.<br /><br />If you are buying this album, chances are someone told you it's good or you know it's good. So stop looking for a funny review to post on reddit and get this album.
B003G4W49C|4.0|A fascinating story.  It took me a while to get into it,  but I really enjoyed the book,  Very good.
B00479SVBU|5.0|I had a cheap FM transmitter from the '90's that worked - but picked up all kinds of additional noise. I had been looking for something I could play MP3s on in my Accord that has an integrated Stereo / dual zone climate control. I looked at all kinds of expensive aux units that would most likely cause me to pay for professional install.<br /><br />For ~$44 I picked up this unit with remote (and a low CR 2025 battery) and it works GREAT. I will provide an update if anything changes.
B00EDF43MY|2.0|Haven't played yet but couldn't play without writing a review first...,I don't understand????  How can I rate something I never played.  With that I give it a 2.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show just keeps getting better.  This season is full of twists and turns, enjoy the ride, but be prepared with tissues!
B00CXVX1OQ|4.0|pretty cool app  funny too did'nt play much but im sure i'll be addicted after a few more times of playing
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Within minutes of receiving this product we up and running streaming you tube and Netflix in the bedroom what at the back of the house
B005LJK3AC|1.0|This was a complete waste of my time and money. I couldn't even finish it. How they got good actors to play in it nobody knows. I wonder if previous reviews that encouraged me to watch are actually genuine.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I love this show. The diogue is witty and the social interactions are great as are the storylines. They keep things interesting without dragging things out for to long.
B002BRRTUO|5.0|This was a lot more entertaining than I thought it would be. If they ever make a remake, Flash Gordon should definitely be played by Ashton Kutcher.
B000CNE092|3.0|Predictable. Entertaining for my day care kids, but they were not glued to it. Characters identifiable from their voices and even facial characteristics.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game! It is soooooo fun!!!!!!!!!!! I love thew new updates! I would totally get this game! Seriously! You really need to get this game if you don't have it. The best part, ITS FREE!!!!!!!
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Great story and characters. A little too violent for me, but we can skip over some of it.  Reading the books while watching series. Books are addicting.
B0051ANPZQ|3.0|I really loved this book and I would tell you'd something about but I just don't want to ruin it. Also if anyone can answer this for me it would really help. Why when Justin is talking all the words are lower-cased? I mean isn't he supposed to be the smart kid like all the other smart kids at the so call &#34;nerds&#34; table that (Via's words, not mine!)? Well I just want to know why, it got me really upset. Well other than that, this book was great. I really loved it and it has a great theme of kindness.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|Not as good as the notebook but worth a view. They did a good job at giving you some background information about the characters as try begin the form a relationship which makes it more believable.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I heard Lindsey on Pandora and wrote her name on my wishlist.  I bought this album a couple of weeks ago and it has played on my iPods daily (I have several, one in every room).  Today, I went and looked at her youtube channel and saw the AGT review and I can't agree with any of it.  I loved her videos too.<br /><br />This is different; it is fusion as so much of the new stuff out there is.  The violin  playing is splendid played over what alternates between a techno hypo flavor and something that sounds reminiscent of Celtic instrumental pieces.  The violin is played fast and modern, a 21st Century version of really good fiddle playing, nothing too high brow or unapproachable.  This is great stuff.<br /><br />I looking forward to more music from this up and coming young woman with plenty to offer us.
B0081336FO|5.0|I wish they had more seasons to be able to watch.  I found Sherlock deliciously annoying and Watson an amusing character.
B000L9IUPM|5.0|I love this dvd and the bonus cd. I received prompt and courteous service and i will use this seller again because the dvd and bonus cd were in excellent shape. I am so impressed because the concert was outstanding and I love it so much. Thanks again. I will watch this over and over again. i love you guys because the dvd and bonus cd were in excellent shape. this is a very special concert. Eagles rock.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I own the series on BlueRay, but sometimes it's easier to hit play on Amazon and watch it from my XL computer monitor from bed.  It's a shame no one knew about it when it was aired because it should have ran at least 10 seasons.  It's almost rediculous looking at it now, that it never caught on soon enough, but that there is a HUGE following of it over the last 11 years.  There has been a Firefly panel at nearly every Comic-Con, Dragon-Con, u-name-it-con, for the past 11 years.  It's crazy to think that even 11 years after the show was cancelled, thousands of people still line up for hours to go to the Firefly panels!!!<br /><br />This is the show that gave us Nathan Fillion.  If only it had the right media coverage, this Joss Whedon masterpiece would have touch millions of more lives for many more years.  At least we have Serenity :)
B004UJAOLM|5.0|Always a great book... love the movie, love the characters ... of course it is Bronte and her writing style is not a favorite of everyone... but I am a fan
B008X9Z37A|5.0|My kids gave me a Kindle and I like it so much but definitely needed a cover for it to protect it and this does the trick.
B00D41H2PS|2.0|This could be a great game, but there are too many glitches. I played it on my kindle, and at times the clues shown are so dark and small you cant really see them. Also, things in your inventory simply go away requiring you to start the game over and retrieve them. I did manage to finish it by starting over.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I love my Chromecast!!  Having the ability to watch something on my computer, but cast to my TV is amazing.  The quality of the picture is great! Only occasionally do I get a delay in the audio matching the video, but that is usually fixed by pausing it and letting things catch up and then it's fine.  You can't beat the cost!  There are many people out there that say they are not going to get it because there is no apps for it yet.  Well to tell you then truth; 1 of my friends said that it doesn't support HBO Go.  There isn't an option that I know of through HBO Go that it has an embedded cast button, but as long as you use chrome you will always have that cast button, so it really doesn't matter.  If you are looking for something that is inexpensive that in essence does the same thing as ROKU, then this is it! Like I said, you can't beat the price.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS!!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|VERY DIFFERENT FROM HIS PREVIOUS BOOKS. Almost like short stories that coalesce in the end.  I love his books but the endings always leave me wanting more resolution.  Guess that is the mark of a good novelist.
B004XVN1T4|4.0|Fascinating story, full of adventure and intrigue.<br />Didn't like this narrator as much as John Lee who narrates several of Follett's books.
B00CFYAT6O|5.0|A great follow up to Revelator.  Susan's vocals are, as always, outstanding and Derek's slide guitar is unparalled.  Do I look Worried is a great blues song.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|This series is addictive. Don't read unless you are ready to not get anything else done for some time. Don't let the length distract you. Gabaldon weaves a rich story that keeps the reader engaged the whole time. The story was written as a trilogy and this book ties the loose ends that can be drug out in trilogies. That being said, I am looking forward to reading the next book.
B000O8OTNC|2.0|Not to impressed with this item.<br />I was not able to get a sharp edge with this tool. I expected a paper cutting edge. Just doesn't seem to work that well. 8/10 draws on carbide followed by 8/10 on ceramic.
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|Could anyone possibly believe that all of the events in this book and all of the movement and all of the repetition of building names and places take only four or five days perhaps??  And did this book need drones which often appeared but never fired a shot???  Would Langdon  really have switched the masks in a room with multiple filming devices.<br /><br />I did take a look at the book Palazzo Vecchio (copyright 1989 in Florence by Scala). You may recall the chase through the attics of the room of the 500 from which the motorcycle lady fell to her death. There is a great photo of these rafters on page 50. Now that is something real and solid and beautifully crafted in this book! The rest is superficial bloat which ultimately fizzles out.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|This game really helps to pass the time. Some of the levels are very hard to finish and you can't skip any levels.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|One of my favorite songs this year. The music video is a work of Art. Much love to Lady Gaga for her creativity and talent.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|It is okay.though I prefer temple run better........NOT SO MUCH BETTER THAN TEMPLE RUN!,plus its free get this and you will become addicted
B00D41AJ7G|4.0|I am not a game player, and when my 6-year old granddaughter got stuck on level three, I was ready to give this game a low rating, since I couldn't figure it out, either.  But she kept at it and before I knew it, she was progressing right through the game and having fun doing it.  It's a good, clean challenge that just takes some mental gymnastics, I guess, though I'm pretty sure not every 6-year old would like it.
B00E8JTSVG|4.0|This book reads like a Young adult novel, and that isnt a bad thing! I loved it. It was cute, different and to me that is refreshing. So many stories now dont take a leap, they are retold stories with their own words and after a while that gets boring and lets face it... not enjoyable at all.<br /><br />This book is nothing like that. It has spirits, love, mystery, magic and all of that with a native american twist. I love it. Inventive, different, fun and just enjoyable. I would recomend this to any young reader and even some older ones as well. Because lets face it, there is a child in all of us.<br /><br />Well done.
B00CEK9OTM|4.0|This app can be challenging to figure out exactly where the ball is suppose to go, on screen builds up to the next.
B0050AV5MW|5.0|So many plots, so much politics, yet so much innocence. Some bits (esp book 4) feel slow but overall a good read.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|Getting the correct combination of colors and placement gets more difficult with each box.  Toward the end it was taking me a couple sessions to get the job done.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|From start to finish, this is a great film. It weaves into the story answers to questions about the originals and develops new storylines based on the \\"new\\" Jim, Spock, Bones, Uhura, Scottie, and more. I can't wait for the next film. And I will watch this again many times. Also, I'm glad J.J. Abrams toned down the overuse of light reflecting off of everything. For those who are migraine sufferers, this makes it even more enjoyable to watch.
B005XQLBU4|3.0|Fairly simple to use, no real talent needed.  Fun way to pass a few minutes away but nothing I would play for long.
B00A27X972|4.0|An Alien is sent to Earth to take the place of Andrew Martin a professor that has solved Riemann's hypothesis. It seems like no big thing to humans but to the aliens they know it is the first step in humans discovering their world and about them. The alien has to find the answer and destroy it. He knows all about humans how they have let war, disease and more ruin their lives. What he learns is there is so much more to these humans and what it is like to be one.<br /><br />The author has written this book in a way that gives it a spin unlike other books you may read. The alien who is a clone for Andrew Martin is detailing you what he is going through on his search. He has to act human to find where the professor has put the answer. You get to see what we would look and act like to an alien. He has several hard times as he doesn't understand us as you see from the start he provides a few laughs as he gets to understand what we are. He learns to bond with Andrew's teenage son and wife and in a way fixes personnel problems the professor has. This book isn't the usual alien book but one that you will either love or hate. I really enjoyed it as the author has a wonderful way with words.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Fun and easy to work. You don't have to wait on energy and there is always something to do! Great game for all ages!
B003ODIZL6|1.0|I can't tape in what I want and the pages shouldn't be black it should be white and the letters should be black or you can pick the color you want it and what like about it is that I didn't have to pay.
B000HAB4KS|5.0|I haven't watched this movie since it first came out. The video playback quality was ok but it is fair for being 13 years old. I really enjoyed the fact I could see on HD on my son's Xbox. The sounds wasn't very good but we made the most of it by adjusting our surround system.
B008Y5UADK|2.0|The part about math was ok.. the rest of the movie was too crazy, the plot was not that good and the black and white made it worst
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|no matter how I tried I could not figure it out..I am sure that kids will have no problem..just looked like a cool free game app
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|is the second time I see it and it is still good... i am waiting for the release of the second part
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is the best horse game that I have ever played and its also in HD and its so realistic I would share this game
B001ENOB8Y|3.0|Seasons 1-3 were FANTASTIC, although I know a lot of this show is quite a stretch.<br /><br />Season 4 is sooooo longgggggg.  Episode after episode after episode of being chased, secret meetings, shady characters, guns, killings, over and over and over again.  On top of that there continues to be amazing feats of escape as the genius lead character continues to perform McGyver-like technical miracles that allow our characters to escape numerous places in the nick of time.  Add to that his ability yet again to decode all those secret codes that appear all over the place.  And it all begins to look more and more like a really bad \\"B\\" movie, complete with bad writing, stereotypical villians and menacing music.<br /><br />However, the last episode redeemed the season, and I hear the straight-to-DVD movie is good and closes up some holes in the story.<br /><br />The 3 stars are only for season 4.  5 stars overall.
B00498YZFK|5.0|This movie establishes Jennifer Lawrence as a serious actress. It is moving, terrifying and defining. I challenge anyone to watch this movie and not rethink their views on poverty and its effects on children and families. One of the best movies of our time
B00338QENI|5.0|The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is a fantastic book.  It's a wonderful combination of science, history, and human interest.  Being a biolgist, I've worked with HeLa cells.  It was amazing to learn about the woman whose cells have done so much for science and the struggles she and her family endured.  This book does a great job of discussing the science/medical aspect in a way that is easy to understand.  If there is one book you read this year, read this book!
0316069884|5.0|This book opens your eyes to what is going on. He is an excellent, compelling, & interesting writer. The author has complex moral sense. He shares his personal stories which is very engaging on an emotional level. Wonderful read! I wasn't a vegan before but this book has changed my life for the better.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|A great story by a master storyteller. This fast-paced thriller had very few tedious moments in it and came with some great twists and turns along the way.
B004UG7RQ0|5.0|This works well with the bose lifestyle v35. Besides this has the wired connection unlike the dockboss air which uses AD2P protocol which does not give out the CD quality sound. You can pair this with the NUForce BTR-100 to get true CD Quality solution and bluetooth wireless. The BTR-100 can also be used with Windows 8 as an external speaker.
B00119ZMKW|5.0|So happy that Amazon Prime carries Stargate. Not on Netflix or Hulu Plus! All time favorite show of ours - never disappoints!
B00BUADSMQ|2.0|Well it is time for Bruce Willis to move on to another type of movie. The movie is the same type of movie, just set in a different location. Within the first minute the story should be over and money should be refunded back to the paying public. Well no, we a just suckers at love to be taken. Well go by Bruce, I will no be buying another one of these movies.
B0088W7VNG|5.0|So happy that Amazon Prime carries Stargate Atlantis. Not on Netflix or Hulu Plus! All time favorite show of ours - never disappoints!
0767020308|5.0|Every time I read this book I fall in love with the characters again.  The characters come alive because of the imagery and vivid descriptions.  A very well written book. Jane Austen's work continues to mold and shape the minds ofloversof literature.
B00BZODDYU|1.0|It did not load right... I did not get to watch it to review the movie.. For some reason it would not work, but I paid for nothing...
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|Reads like a text book. Doesn't flow easy. Didn't make a good case for the conclusions reach. Not an easy read.
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|No one has responded to my E-Mails to their Support site and I lost everything and I don't know why or how to get it back.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|If you're not into critical thinking this isn't for you. I love hard challenges and my 8 year-old enjoyed this, too! !
B00ADQCBEY|4.0|It's a love/hate relationship with the main characters.  One minute they are doing something atrocious and the next they ride in and save the day.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|I actually was laughing out loud at the end of this book. A fun, entertaining, and creative read. Loved it.
B005LAIH3G|3.0|If there is an &#34;adult&#34; who loves this stuff, I am glad I don't know them. I only made it halfway through this, and now I know why it was a flop. Lousy name, unknown actors, thin, thin plot
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I've tried reading other zombie novels, but couldn't get into them. This one was so absorbing in its narrative, it seemed to become real. The other novels in the genre don't measure up. Max Brooks has been compared to Studs Turkel in his writing of this book. High praise indeed. And deservedly so.
B000001FK3|5.0|When this record came out in 1973, My friends and I had just started our own band and we all listened to it ten times a day for a couple of years. It is an inspiration for any music fan or player. The man was a genius song writer and Eric Clapton did  several of these tunes as covers and they helped propel him to superstar status. That good. &#34;After Midnight&#34;, need I say more? A must have.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I think it's a fun game because I like village games and thus ok be is the best I've played!
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|This film is exceptionally well done.  The cast was great.  The photography and costuming were perfect.  However, the content was a little depressing.
B00CATONCA|5.0|What an awesome price for something so great. The best limited edition version of the walking dead seasons yet. Super fast shipping made it even better.
B004TK678Q|5.0|According with my daughter because she was the one tha read it. and she has to to do a summary.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Stephen King is a master storyteller.  This is one of the best books I've read in years.  It mixes wonderful characters and a compelling suspenseful story with plenty of nostalgia.  It also combines two if my favorite things history and science fiction.  In this case, obviously, time travel.  There is excellent use of both the butterfly effect and string theory.<br />A must read for Stephen King fans, history buffs and sci fi fans.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This is a most amazing novel about about life as<br />it must have been in the early colony of Virginia.<br />The characters are loveable, hate-able, self- reliant and obedient, surviving and expiring. The story is woven so perfectly and the scenes worth reading over and over. I am so glad I bought the book so I can reread it many  times over. Its the GWTW before our country was created.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|JANE EYRE IS PROBABLY MY FAVOURITE NOVEL. MANY ACTRESSES HAVE ASSUMED THE ROLE HOWEVER RUTH WILSON HAS BROUGHT A FRESH APPROACH AND TOBY STEPHENS IS THE IDEAL &#34; ROCHESTER&#34; .
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|One of the best and most objective Bible book reviews I've read in a long time. The author showed sensitivity to the beliefs of others without catering to them.
B004XUMMFE|3.0|We enjoy the characters, but the plots are often unbelievable.  It is a good, low effort entertainment.  Actually wish that there was more than one season.
B00BQ1D7X4|4.0|As a man in his late 30's that grew up on 'grunge' I can say that I like this record a lot. No band to my knowledge has produced a record 20 years after their heyday that was 'significant'. But this record is really good. The millennials that went to Yale and studied music history that write reviews for Pitchfork, Spin, etc shouldn't get it and I'm glad they don't. In an age where bands like Arcade Fire and Vampire Weekend get 5 star reviews, I'm thrilled that bands like AIC are ignored in the press. Because they still have hair on their balls. I'd be insulted if Gen Y 'got it'. So if you shave your nuts and your first stop in the morning in your Prius is the Starbucks drive through, forget this record. Those of us with hairy balls will continue to carry the rock torch, with AIC as part of our soundtrack.
B000Z8GZYW|5.0|Just like the theme of the movie, you'll be watching this movie over and over again just as Bill Murray's character relives the same day over and over again!<br /><br />Swiftly becoming a classic, this film follows the recurring nightmare of the sarcastic Phil Connors's life when he travels to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania to cover Groundhog Day as the leading weatherman for channel 9 news Pittsburgh.  He gets there, wakes up at 6:00 in the morning, goes about his normal day, covers the story, and they all head back towards Pittsburgh.  Unfortunately, his weather predictions are wrong and the blizzard hits the area full force, closing down the roads.  They are forced to return to Punxsutawney, where the producer, who also becomes the love interest, weatherman, and cameraman all return to their respective rooms and go to sleep.  However, when Phil wakes up the next morning, at 6:00, the day has restarted itself.  The snow never fell.  They never left.  It never made it to tomorrow.  What ensues is a hilarious string of events where he attempts to buck himself out of today and into tomorrow.<br /><br />Bill Murray plays a great sarcastic role, while Andie MacDowell plays her part over and over again with those key minor changes to Phil's behavior with a convincing ease.  It's a great film, funny, and touching all at once.  This special edition for the 15th year anniversary includes a commentary with the director, an interview with Harold Ramis, a documentary on time, some deleted scenes, and an informative section on, of course, groundhogs.

B0042U94UQ|5.0|I got the movie quickly and it was new. There was no problem getting it sent where I wanted it to be sent.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Kept my face in the book. Characters a little hard to keep straight for awhile but what a good book!!
140006922X|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I loved learning more about the history around the time of Jesus of Nazareth's life.  I found the book to be an easy read and very informative. I highly recommend it.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Love it not much else to say.. It's a great app and use it a lot for planning  an outing.
0194313425|4.0|It is helping me stock pile my books for when I teach ESL. This is a great exercise book. And the seller was very good about his product quality. I am very happy with my selection.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Fantastic cast and plot.  For those who enjoy a truly great scare with plot twists and turns, do yourself a favor and watch this award-winning series!

B003G4W49C|5.0|This is another one of those books where I ask myself where was I when this first came out?  Shamefully I didn't hear about it until this book until this year, now that the movie is coming out!  (Hey at least I read and liked the Great Gatsby in high school)<br /><br />I like dystopian novels, and I like a little science fiction here and there, but when a friend suggested I would love this book, and I read the summary, I really wasn't sold.<br /><br />\\"In order to develop a secure defense against a hostile alien race's next attack, government agencies breed child geniuses and train them as soldiers\\"<br /><br />Sounds very Independence Day to me.  I really only downloaded this book on Kindle because it was discounted in the daily deals, and what a great plan on Amazon's part, because now that I loved the book, I have to buy and read the whole series!<br /><br />Even though this is more of a YA novel, the way they described the alien race, what they looked like, how they evolved, how they lived, it was all kind of believable.  I really need to believe in the plot when I am reading in order to get lost in the story.  I loved the general relativity explanation for Mazar Rackham's part-of course that makes sense; I saw it on Through the Wormhole!<br /><br />This was a great book and I can't wait to read the next one in the series.  I hope Orson Scot Card doesn't disappoint.
B00AU15HPC|4.0|This is another of Justin Hayward's solo efforts, and as usual he does a fine job. Some songs I repeat, just to hear them again, they're that good!
B001UGB1X8|5.0|I loved loved this movie.  It had lots of suspense, and unexpected mystery.Tommy Lee Jones is such a good actor, and this is another one of his greats.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|This is a wonderful book!!! If you like any of Nicholas sparks books or movies you will like this one
B0097C8XL0|4.0|Fun to play would be nice to have different levels, or at least changing the surroundings to give more variety.
B009AY04A8|3.0|it is difficult to make out the objects on a phone.  otherwise I would have given it a 5 star..but because of that reason..3 and that is being generous.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I finally received the package yesterday and was up and running in ten minutes.  So far, it is performing as expected already integrated into my viewing habits.  I too, expected to use my Amazon Prime account and was temporarily disappointed due to MS Silverlight issues.  I uninstalled Silverlight and was able to stream Amazon using Flash instead.  I video stream on another tv using my PS3 and Chromecast is much easier to set up and use.  A few more video choices would go a long way.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I love this book (: I almost cried at the end :`( it had such a inspirational ending and I just love this book
B001NA2NM4|5.0|i love the half boy. he is kind of cute. i would like to own this movie hopefully one day.
B002EDH0FE|4.0|I love this movie, but i have shown it to a few friends and they just couldnt follow the story line. And they didnt think it was a good as i did. I find this movie pretty awesome due to the time period that it takes place. as well as a few other details. i think its worth the watch. ba da bum..
0345803485|5.0|I would highly recommend this trilogy to anyone that is mature enough to handle Shakespeare's Othello. It has loads of passion and suspense. Great Read.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|It really is a great game, because you can customize or change your weapons. It has great graphics. The online multiplayer feature also has guilds.
B004FGMV0W|5.0|A lot of the songs on this album are sad but true, and I enjoyed them all in my dorm room.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|Beautiful graphics and addictive Mario like gameplay, a must play for Fire HD owners.<br />Great level design right out of the Mario series.
B004LWZW4C|4.0|I'm just about obsessed with super hero movies. I've always had a special reverence for the original X-Men film because it ushered in the new era of big budget super hero movies. First Class is arguably the one of the best installments in the franchise. Like the original there are a couple lines that might induce a slight cringe from time to time, but when dealing with such a fantastic premise it's incredibly hard to sell every last bit. The important thing is it sells most of it well enough to allow you to suspend disbelief and enjoy a fun-filled action/fantasy origin story. Enjoy!
B00ECUX7HC|4.0|Love TTB. Made Up Mind didn't blow me away immediately but it has been growing on me. Quite different from Revelator. Would definitely recommend it.
B00064AM6C|4.0|Under the Blackpool Lights gives us a more raw and slightly less dynamic Jack White. It's a great concert and a must have for any White Stripes fan. Keep in mind, however, that at this point in their career they had only recorded albums up through Elephant, so if you're looking for songs from Icky Thump or Get Behind Me Satan you will be disappointed.
B003TJMY0S|4.0|Not huge Matt Damon fan but he does a good job in thius movie that I think flew below the radar.  Plenty of action and a touch of Homelandesqu spy scenarios.
B002KC8BSO|3.0|Army of Darkness is the Citizen Kane of the &#34;camp&#34; genre. This over-the-top, back in time romp is certain to entertain fans of old school horror and cheesy 80s stylings. Here we have Bruce Campbell at his peak.
B00CFYAT6O|2.0|Ya gotta dig all the groupie reviews of this CD, well, It is what it is, ok music performed by a ton of musicians (One reviewer called this a collective? lol hippie BS or a new musical genre perhaps)  Man, hire enough musicians and you can make \\"ok\\" music but Im not hearing any genius at all. Call this what you will, just dont call it \\"Blues\\" please.
B00D23K0MU|5.0|Maysa does it again with such a vigor and grace! I'm not sure why she's not a bigger star, its worth the money!
B005NFJAZS|5.0|There are some movies out there that are simply made to be watched again and again.  You're flipping through the t.v. channels, and you come across one of them, and you think, \\"Oh, this is good - I'll watch a few scenes\\".  And then the \\"few scenes\\" you mean to spend your time watching become the rest of the movie.  One memorably great scene after another, until it's done and all you want to do is go back to the beginning and watch the whole thing again.<br /><br />That's \\"The Music Man\\".<br /><br />And not only are the songs great, the dancing wonderful, the lines truly funny, and the characters exquisitely drawn...it's just one of those movies/stories where, even living in the modern-day U.S.A., you can just feel what it was like living in that small Iowa town circa 1912 or so.  It's almost like you can feel perfectly at home there.<br /><br />So sit back, relax, and give yourself up to it for a while.  If you've never seen it before and this is your \\"first time\\"...I envy you.  You're in for a total delight!
030758836X|5.0|I loved the layout of the story and the different emotions I had while reading it. Never saw the end coming!
B007ZXK08C|3.0|I really enjoyed this novel until a bit past the halfway point, at which it moved in a direction that bordered on the silly. I kept thinking, now it's a bit too much. The book also became predictable, with a predictable ending, and one that was not very interesting given the very interesting buildup in the first half of the novel. Gillian Flynn can write, and her characters are complex, intriguing, unpredictable and human. Nick and Amy seem to have a good marriage, but as Nick finds out over time, they did not. Amy, being the charming sociopath she is, has a photographic memory for all the slights and mistakes Nick has made when dealing with her, and believe me, they are not very few in her view of things. And since she is the jury and judge, she can mete out his punishment as well. I found myself thinking at one point, Ms. Flynn must have experienced a relationship like this in order to write the hate involved so well. Or perhaps not. I guess it's possible to fantasize about punishing a significant other in the way that Amy punishes Nick; but you'd really have to be off the wall to act on the fantasies. When I got to the point in the novel where I understood what Amy was really all about, I thought, just let them get a divorce, it would be easier. Please just get a divorce and spare us. But Ms. Flynn lets Amy answer that question for us, and the answer is no. Amy is not about divorce. Nick thinks along those lines, but Amy has a plan to get him to toe the line and keep him bound to her forever. I was hoping for a different ending, one that was easier to explain, one that was less bizarre. Strangely enough, despite the inexplicable and bizarre ending, it really was predictable and a letdown.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I was very excited of finally receiving my Chromecast, but I rapidly became frustrated with it and would not recommend it to anyone at this point.<br /><br />The video quality is bad, and the audio is out of sync with the images.<br />When casting a Chrome tab from my laptop, the frame quality is so bad that it is impossible to watch a movie or video. When casting from YouTube (from my laptop or iPhone), the video quality is definitely better but there is a delay in the audio portion and it makes the overall experience bad.<br />Overall, Chromecast is useless to me right now. I've tried modifying video quality and such, but nothing improved the overall experience and images and audio are still out of sync.<br /><br />So far I'm not impressed with the product and is no longer connected to my tv: I'm not returning it in the hope that more native apps  will soon integrate the Cast functionality (similar to what YouTube and NetFlix currently do) and that the overall quality of the product will improve soon.<br />If not, it will end up being a $35 paperweight...
B00DY951RQ|5.0|This is such a great release for so many reasons; there is the removal of the muddy overdubs and echo that plagued the original release. There are numerous out-takes and remakes of songs. There is a clarity and sonority never found in these recordings before.<br /><br />Dylan in his prime sang like nobody else...right in tune...seldom in melodic tune but always in tune. His passion and often understated phrasing are inimitable, despite the fact that so many singers adopt a nasal tone and try to emulate him. The fact is, Dylan, probably more than any popular singer recorded, used a variety of voices. His tone and resonance during these recordings appeals to me a lot; somewhere between John Wesley Harding and Nashville Skyline.<br /><br />I bought the deluxe set and had reservations about laying out the cash. Glad I did it! The two books are nice, But in addition to the remixed Self Portrait recordings, you get a remixed original Self Portrait along with the Isle of Wight performance. Another thing - some of the songs, take for instance If Not For You, blow away the originals to a degree where I wonder who made the decisions to release the lesser performances. The horn section in New Morning is a cool experiment that works too.<br /><br />I've had people laugh out loud when I tell them that some of the best singing I've ever heard came from Dylan. But I mean it! When you consider the limitations of the instrument, it's as if a hobo picked up a busted fiddle and began to play music bordering on Stradivarius tones! He does so much with so little.<br /><br />Memo to 'singers' in this day and age:  Play Copper Kettle and listen. I mean LISTEN to the pure, unadulterated soul and emotion pouring from Dylan's lips! Pull off just one performance like this and you're established as an artist. Do it over and again, reinventing yourself a hundred different times in the process, and you stand alone as a burning bright laser does in a field of candles!
B004SBS8LA|2.0|This game is fun for my 3 y/o great granddaughter.  As for me, it's boring.  There's not a lot of room for advancement.
0385344228|5.0|Started reading this book and cannot put it down!  Book arrived on time and in great shape.  Completely Satisfied w purchase now time for a cup a coffee and to snuggle up with my new book!
B00BQ1D7BQ|3.0|This album is a fairly good representation of what I expected it would be.  Some of the tracks are really good and some are mediocre.<br /><br />I've been a big fan of Kenny Wayne Shepherd's music since his first album.  He's one of the best blues (and rock) players out there but the collaboration with Stephen Stills was a head scratcher from the moment I heard about it.  As such, the album goes back and forth from originals to some good classic blues covers.  My preference is the covers - including Neil Young's 'Rockin in the Free World'.  The originals may take a few listens to grab hold.<br /><br />Kenny Wayne's playing is great.  Stephen Stills should NOT be trading blues licks with Kenny Wayne.  His tone is HORRIBLE and his playing is even worse.  Seriously bad guitar playing that only someone of Stephen Still's status could get away with.
B003M6FGTE|5.0|My 14 year old daughter watches this show all of the time, she turned me on to it.  I'm hooked!
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|Non stop action from start to finish!!!  Sad to see it end but excited at the same time. A very good read.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book was so captivating, I couldn't put it down. It has a great story line and surprising twists that keep you guessing. I read the whole book in 2 days and I recommend it to everyone!!!
B002EDH0FE|5.0|I like this sort of movie.<br />I like the weirdness of this particular cast of characters.<br />I liked the action, the plot, the effects, and enjoyed the whole thing.<br />Actors, Directors, all did a bang up job.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|Thoughtful, creative, connecting story that is an easy read and really entertaining. I don't have a lot of time to read and when I get time, it doesn't come all at once. This was a great book that I could pick up where I left off and never felt confused about the pace or the details. There were many times in the story where I couldn't put the book down. Loved the story and the style of writing.
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|I just was sort of bored a lot.<br />And disappointed at some of the makeup and effects.<br />It was a tad corny.<br />It seemed more like a business decision than an artistic endeavor.<br />I like everyone in it. I was not crazy at all about the writing.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I was late to begin watching 'Diwnton Abbey'.  My daughter had purchased the first season and, when visiting, I watched the first episode.  That was it! I was hooked!  I immediately finished Season 1. Moved right on to Season 2 and am attempting to (with difficulty) prolong the viewing if Season 3.  The writing is exquisite, the characters fully developed and intriguing, and the storylines completely engaging.  I'm hopeful there will be several more seasons to look forward to.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I liked the way the lives of the people in this book were all weaved together.  Plus, I loved the tie in to Pandora's Box in the very beginning of the book to how the story ends.  I liked it so much we are going to read it for our book club.
B006YTTVHO|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. I am becoming a manager of a small business and needed some direction as far as communication with employees, this definitely sent me in the right direction
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|I truly enjoyed watching this documentary. Very interesting to see how the music business has changed with technology. Entertaining and worthwhile film.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like this game a lot. I like it because at anytime you can set it down and come back to it.
B004EF8AJA|5.0|I loved North and South and would say that it was a better story and film than even Pride and Prejudice (which I also am a huge fan of.)
1452126607|4.0|Loved it, of course you can't open a calendar before January 1 or it's bad luck.  Grumpy Cat is great.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|...and I loved it!  Having recently lost a dog to similar health issues, it was especially poignant and touching to try to see his life through a dog's eyes.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I just love the game. Just wish I could enlarge screen, some items difficult to see on small screen.<br />This is the only problem I can see with this game
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|Terribly addicting!  Going to play as long as possible!  I am so HAPPY!!!  Wish there were more games like this one!
B00CE004XM|4.0|most songs are very good but they seem too have to slip in 1 or 2 songs that DON'T belong on a blues album, Geeeezzzz what's with that, both have talent galore, it over flows in most songs I am sure you will agree,
B00076NYFK|5.0|I love this album, I love rock and roll,but status quo is my favorite band ,I have  the whole collection
B009Y6UCRC|4.0|Ya'll will like this album if only for the vocals. She is sooooo sweet. they need to get rid of songs that are too west coast, I grew up in the Midwest and just can't connect with that west coast thing, That's me ya might love the whole album , I loved most of it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Lots of fun &amp; addictive =)<br />Just downloaded this great game and instantly lost an hour... I highly recommend that you do the same!!!
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I like the story of this book.<br />It feels almost like a script... as if written to reach the masses.<br />It's not a literary gem, in the sense of polish and depth... but it is imaginative and the story and characters really make you care to keep reading it.<br />A light read, easy language... very descriptive.
B008BQ8VOC|3.0|As time passes they all get softer and softer with the exception of the great priestess! Definitely not as enthralling as the first episodes.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Clary was an unlikely hero and the story kept me guessing. Jace was a very tough guy to figure out ,but it was obvious he is a honorable man.
1452126607|4.0|I like the grumpy cat images with funny captions.<br />Grumpy cat is new so this will be the first year of calendars.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Complex plot but great visuals.  It is one of those movies where you need to watch it from beginning to end to understand what is going on!  Tom Cruise does a nice job.
1452126577|4.0|this was the first book for grumpy cat, as she is new on the bookstands.<br />the captions are humorous, but the pictures are somewhat repetitive.
B00DGMVJAO|2.0|This movie has some good visuals but the plot was so thin you could anticipate every line in the movie.
B00ECUARO8|2.0|Long and drawn out.  Could have done a better job with character studies and relationships.  Child star stole the movie.
B00000IAU3|3.0|This CD had only a few good songs. But for the price it was worth the purchase. Dido has a unique style of music.
B00ECU2RGY|5.0|Would watch it again. Liked the little shuttle Tom rode around in. Great graphics and special effects in Blu ray.
B004LZFWJO|4.0|Candy Swipe is just plain fun!  Friends are saying they like it better than candy crush, Warning though...it can become addictive!
B005XUC398|4.0|I found this film compelling. It gives you an inside look at how big business can make very bad decisions that result in negative consequences for the wrong people. Kevin Spacey as usually does a great job as one of the senior members of the business in question. HIghly recommend this film.
B009AY04A8|4.0|Good fun for all. Nice hidden object game. Great free game of the day. Only wish there was a game on the market that did not involve magic or a ghost.
B000002ADT|2.0|Obviously this is a masterpiece. What I would have liked to know from either 1) product description, or 2) product reviews is that this disc is NOT the original recordings. Someone took it upon themselves to pitch down three arrangements that were recorded sharp. They were MEANT to be played that way!!<br /><br />Would have been nice to know this. I wouldn't have wasted the seven dollars.
B00D6BQPMM|2.0|The trailers gave me the impression that this being a funny movie, but in turn I found it slow and lackluster. The parts that looked so funny in the trailers just fell absolutely flat when in context.
B002NWXRYY|5.0|One of my all time favorites..Loved the story.. funny cute loved the background music  Loved the stars Goldy and Steve and all the rest of the cast.
0307271080|5.0|I don't believe I have read a more thorough novel than Chimamanda Adichie's, Americanah. I was literally on the waiting list at my local library for over a month for this book. I enjoyed every second of reading it. It was well worth the wait and more.<br /><br />Ifemelu, one of the narrators and main character, is coming of age in Nigeria. Life and circumstances align and she is able to obtain a visa and go live with her aunt in America. This opportunity of a lifetime is bittersweet because has to leave the love of her life behind, Obinze. The challenges Ifemelu faces in American drives Ifemelu and Obinze apart more than land and sea ever could.<br /><br />Adichie addresses a variety of themes throughout Americanah and she does this quite seamlessly. Ultimately, Americanah is a love story but not a fairytale. One of the most difficult areas of the book is when Ifemelu is trying to find employment upon arriving in America. Adichie shed light on some harsh realities in life and love. Ifemelu's strength and sheer determination were remarkable.<br /><br />There were several components that made Americanah so enjoyable and a book that I could relate to. First of all Ifemelu was a very successful blogger. There were several blog posts included in the narrative that fit very well. Secondly, she wore her hair in its natural state which had its on share of difficulties. Lastly, Ifemelu worked her way through the ups and downs of relationships all while thinking about the one who \\"might have gotten away\\". One of these relationships was new territory that quite a few women of color may be exploring.<br /><br />Whenever the narrative shifts to Obinze's story, there is a certain calmness to what can be the clamor that is felt reading Ifemelu's perspective. Obinze is the calm to any storm. He is such a graceful and endearing soul. He is faced with enormous challenges but he never breaks and he never gives up on his one true love.<br /><br />I can't give this novel enough praise. As I was reading through the last few pages my heart was racing and I had tears in my eyes. When I finished I just wanted to go back to page one and start all over again.As I was reading through the last few pages my heart was racing and I had tears in my eyes.

B0007LGCA4|4.0|This is my second pair of Keen sandals.<br />(((My first pair were for in-water / boating use and these worked out well - although if you are going to hike in them wear socks or you will have rubs.)))<br /><br />I priced these on-line at several &#34;recreational equipment&#34; sales sites and Amazon had the best price.<br />I bought the Newport model for everyday wear and around the house wear.  I like the toe protection - especially when working in the garage.  They &#34;broke-in&#34; quickly - so that within a couple of days they were very comfortable.  There is a ...bucks about 1.25 miles from my house and I walked there and back last w/end with no socks very comfortably.<br />I usually do not wear socks with them and wonder if I will need to wash them (and how the leather will respond to washing) if they absorb foot odor....only time will tell.<br />Right now I am very satisfied.<br />Gave 4 of 5 as I just got them and don't yet have long experience.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|I really like what JJ Abrams is doing with this series.  into darkness is an amazing movie.  I would definitely recommend this to all my friends.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|It is so hard to find a show where the writers, producers and directors don't assume the viewers are complete idiots. This show is so well done it sucks me in for and hour and takes me away from the crap that is daily living.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Im hooked , The book it very sexual , but very well written  . I think I read it in like two days . im on the second book now .
B00DJWV11I|5.0|I chose to rate this 5stars because it gives you the male point of view . Lots of pointers about the male and the way he thinks,Plus it was funny, sexy and romantic. I like all the characters especially drew and Kate . I felt like I was watching a movie instead of reading a book. Easy reading not wordy  just enough loved it!!!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I enjoy changing the number of suits for a challenge and the change it back to one suit to make a passive relaxing game.
B006BQM762|4.0|I grew up in The E.T, Close encounters era and this brought me back. Wonderful acting, especially from Miss Elle Fanning ( seriously going to go so many places), definitely worth your while
1478951508|1.0|Brace yourself to hear offensive language in this British account of misery, helplessness, and hopelessness.  I made it through the 2 CD set but it was not enjoyable.  If anything, it describes the treatment people receive when the government is expected to provide for its citizens in a socialistic manner.  No evidence of philanthropy anywhere and a statement that life is meaningless without the morals and virtues taught in the Bible.
B005544V6A|5.0|I bought this because I am a huge Boston Legal fan, and was feeling withdrawal symptoms .  This did not disappoint. It brought everything, suspense, drama, comedy.  you fall in love with ALL the characters.  Great Job.  Truly amazing.

B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I read this to my 7 and 8 year old boys and we all thought is was one of the best books we've ever read. They are sitting with me now giving all kinds of positive feedback and asking great questions about kindness and how people who have disabilities are so similar to them. There are so many great themes and I recommend this book to everyone- old and young!
B0014BY72Q|4.0|My 12 year old kid was wigged out by this PG movie, despite the fact he claims he's seen lots of scary moves.  I realised he'd simply never seen a 70s 'dystopian future' movie, where the future doesn't exactly work out to be a great place.  Freaked him out.  Interesting!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I absolutely loved this book, it sucks you in right in the first chapter which many books take time to really get into. I loved the action, the drama, the romance, you fall in love with every single character in the book. I actually used this book for my friends who don't like to read at all to try to get them more into books and every single person I had read this book couldn't put it down. They kept wanting the next book, thankfully I had them all but point is there isn't really even an age this book fits since it fits just about all ages, and its not just a teen romance for girls. All the guys I gave this book loved it. I would definitely recommend it to anyone. I can't wait to read more by Cassandra Clare.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|This game is a lot of fun but screen does lockup sometimes and causes lost points wins ect... overall a good game.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|We absolutely loved this show. I bought the 1st season for my fiance last Christmas and we decided that Asylum is by far the best season of AHS!
B0064MGU98|5.0|I am hooked on this show!  It is so interesting and intriguing!  The dynamics between the actors and actresses make it even better!
B00BGIC4I6|5.0|Move is hilarious! I loved it! Paul Rudd is absolutely the best! Would recommend this to others to watch this great comedy!
B000TGCR38|5.0|This is such a well made film about a very interesting topic. I loved everything about it, the superb actors, the different venues and how the story presented itself. I can not recommend this strongly enough!//Jejja in Sweden
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evernote holds my whole life. Pictures, voice notes, tasks, web clippings.  It can store anything and everything. It's been supremely useful in organising any projects I always have going on.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|After watching the show I had to read the book.  Very interesting to see what a woman's prison is really like.  I enjoyed the friendships she made and what the ladies did to get through their time.  I would definitely recommend this.
B00ADQCBEY|1.0|This series does not show humans with redeeming qualities.  The main character is deeply flawed and often depicts mean spiritedness.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Great condition and great quality. It met and exceeded all of my expectations.  Couldn't have been more happier with quality and price.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|Great story. Love all the twists it takes. The ending was bittersweet - final twist left me wanting more! Already want to read it again.
B009AY04A8|3.0|I found the puzzles a lot of fun but was annoyed by the excessive dialogue between the sections. I found it very distracting. Most other games have an option to skip, I hope they add this feature to future games. Looking forward to it.
B000JMKRKC|5.0|Wow! Jane Austen-sequence in that all the ends tied up neatly in a little bow, but this story is Gothic, rather than Romantic. Much more in line with the Brontes than Austen. Paranormal, madness, tragedy, and a few silver linings. Awesome!!!
0802473156|5.0|This is a book that anyone in a relationship must read! Before anyone can know how to love to another human, we must know how we need to be loved ourselves. I ordered six copies and plan on giving this book as part of a wedding present.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I enjoyed this book as much as the others. Forewarned that it was focusing on different characters, I was content to learn their stories as well. What a wondrous journey we've been given!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I love this series. Can watch it over and over. Hope to share with family and have a movie marathon.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Not just a lawyer show filled with boring cases.cases relate to the characters. Love to see what kind of mischief the borrowers get into!
B004NYQYNQ|5.0|I love her music. I don't know how to critique an album. Music is such a personal choice. The recording is good and it sounds incredible playing from my phone to my headphones. I haven't figured out how to see the booklet but I haven't tried yet. I'm enjoying my new album and aren't too worried about it...
B00946ZOT8|5.0|Everyone was perfect. If this is the doll your are looking, it was great. Came on time and the box was in new condition.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|Probably my favorite Disney movie... and usually I love the old classic kind. Perfect for kids AND adults. See it.
1616551607|5.0|Yoshitaka Amano's artwork is well worth picking this up especially if you are a lover of Final Fantasy.  Came in perfect condition and arrived precisely when it was supposed to.
B00499NHLC|5.0|This is a great fresh twist on an undeniable classic. The setting is modern, including current gadgets, but it doesn't lose the patina of the original. Cumberbatch makes an excellent an very believable Sherlock.  Without being campy or tacky.
B005FISBTO|5.0|very good product I liked<br />I recommend it because it is good and affordable.<br />the price is good and very good shipping fast and secure
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I enjoyed this book.  It was well written and very imaginative storyline.  I want to know what happens next.... hoping there is a sequel that will continue the stories of the main characters.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|very good product I liked<br />I recommend it because it is good and affordable.<br />the price is good and very good shipping fast and secure
B000QRIGLC|5.0|The movie tells the story correctly and not more Hollywood myth and distortion.  This is the &#34;Right Stuff&#34; our soldiers are made of.
B003L77GRO|5.0|very good product I liked<br />I recommend it because it is good and affordable.<br />the price is good and very good shipping fast and secure
B000FQ4M58|2.0|BOOH 1 and 2 were so enjoyable this album missed the mark big time the songs had no catchiness to them, I don't believe ive heard one of them on the radio.
B001CDWFPC|5.0|I have enjoyed this study Bible very much and would recommend it to anyone looking for a long overdue translation of God's Word.
0738737909|5.0|Very fast shipping Item was as stated in description. Will purchase from this seller again. I recommend this seller to do business with.
B00AYB1RGG|3.0|Not bad - and overall I'd be interested in seeing another iteration. As I was watching it though, I just couldn't get out of my head that it was a less entertaining version of Raid: Redemption, which also came out the same year.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love it! Very addictive. Easy to touch bingo bar on the smaller screens. Be careful. Fun to have FB pals to help with coins and prizes.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|it was one of the best series I have watched in a long long time<br />loved the story line..  could watch it over and over..
B004KPQK2S|5.0|Its just a great feel good movie!! With good acting and one that I can watch over, an over again!!
B00C7E3ELE|5.0|great transfer  with many extras  sum are new for this edition.  if you love this film  buy it now .
B00C25TCZ0|5.0|gotta respect the fact they didn't use the &#34; THIN LIZZY &#34; name.<br />excellent cd.  looking forward to the next one
B004GYY714|5.0|Love being able to listen to radio stations across the country. TuneIn has stations other apps don't carry. Love it!
B0095P31L6|5.0|This film appealed to all the members of my family, from 64 to 2 years old.  We laughed together, gasped together and held our breaths together.
B000BYCAJE|3.0|Going along enjoying an old favorite...until I got to the added songs, not original to the album. Spoils the reverie. Disappointed. Wish Amazon would make it clearer that there is added, unnecessary and intrusive content.
B003FM1MNO|5.0|Watched this again with my son...Great movie, even still. one of those timeless movies that is so enjoyable, though you may need to break it into multiple watching sessions.
B005544V6A|5.0|Best show on television! Made me want to be a lawyer. My friend really was thinking about not taking the LSAT and changing his career focus, but then I showed him Suits and it rekindled the fire that he had lost--
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey just keeps getting better with plots and addressing the changing times.  Some of the dialogue is a little stilted, but interesting.
068485743X|5.0|This book has been instrumental in helping me along with my writing.  It gives great tips.  It arrived well within time frame promised and is being used daily.
B00C1S945G|4.0|There is nothing bad you can say about this show. I just plain like it and always well like it!!
B009WUAK2M|1.0|I like action movie and I grew up on these action heroes , But you still have have a story that makes sense, The have fighting scene just so Chuck Norris can come out of no-where and kill everybody.<br /><br />And the use of classic tag line like &#34;I will be back&#34;  litter this move,  acting is fine, editing completely lame, and get a real director
B00280LYHS|5.0|This book was really awesome I even cried in some parts. I think that Rick Riordan is a great author and I can't wait to read more of his books
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Dave Grohl is by far one of the most funny, intelligent in depth soulful musicians alive today. This documentary is enlightening, uplifting and downright genius.
B005K0HDGE|2.0|Not up to King's usual writing.  Thought it dragged out the story in a few places.  You can do better Mr. King!
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|from the edition, the content, all the detail put into a product as safe. All the extra stuff subtitled in Spanish, make this edition a imprecindible, for any fan of bluray.
B00BB8OHMW|4.0|It starts out a little slow, but it is a pretty good story.  I was surprised and hesitant to watch it at first, but it wasn't bad.
B004LWZW24|5.0|It was great to watch a movie again that let the audience imagination take over. Too often a movie dives in with over the top special effects and ruins a good scary story. The back story was used to great effect to build up the suspense until the final moments. The use of the &#34;Tip-toe Through the Tulips&#34; theme music for the demon was perhaps the most twisted part and added a certain sickness that the movie was in need of. This is well worth your time as it does offer an old-school horror feel from start to finish.<br /><br />Insidious 2 is coming soon!
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|If you into action movies and high tech - pretty descent.  I am not, but still enjoyed this movie and the different characters.
B009VIZDLI|4.0|A good read. A different style of story but really got into it and enjoyed the story and did not want to put it down
B003XRELGQ|2.0|I started reading it and sorry to say I just didn't like it.  It didn't grab me up and I haven't gone back to it.  Please don't ask me to rate anything else.  I read what suits me and I don't care about what others think of my critique.  That's why I don't want to be bothered by asking me to rate an author's writing.  Others may have more time than I do but I don't spend my day on my computer or my Kindle.
B0040I09RM|5.0|One of the best series I've watched, my rebel side gets to live vicariously through these wonderfully raunchy characters! Highly recommended for adult audiences!
B003KK65KG|4.0|I am not a great reader though do like to have a book on the go. This is the first Jodi Picoult book I have read. Took a little reading to get used to the authors style of writing, once into it, it held my interest to the end. Would recommend it.
B00AB2NYNC|5.0|I highly recommend this album, the DVD featuring the Gentlemen of the Road tour was so wonderful, we purchased tickets to their Gentlemen of the Road Stopover this year. Great musicians + great music = a great purchase!
B0074Q41LW|5.0|Have owned a print copy of this book for many years. Wanted the convenience of an electronic version. For anyone interested in learning classic sleight of hand with cards it is one of the  essentials.
B000A0GYD2|5.0|The series is very well done. They don't use the sames directors/producers for every chapter so there is some variety to the &#34;feel&#34; of the entire set. If you love the &#34;space race&#34; this is required viewing.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|To anyone who likes a good story and thinks of basic religious truths.  It is also the thoughts of the sadness of parting with ones we love and keeping the idea of how much living means.
B00AGDY4AI|5.0|I would recommend this movie for any family to watch. great humor, showing a great American and a great American way of life.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|So incredibly redundant.  Same events occurring over and over.  Same words and phrases are used over and over.  Seems like author copied and pasted same three pages, changed a few words, and just reused them throughout the book.  Poorly written.  Poorly edited.  Waste of ten dollars, I can't even bring myself to finish the book, starting something else.
B004J713JW|5.0|This was a terrific concert! Billy Joel was very energetic.  There is a great mix of songs. Can't ask for anything more.
B000NMW6M0|5.0|I loved this movie. Amazon offers a great variety of movies! I would totally recommend this to everyone who wants to great movies.
0735204314|5.0|From what I have seen this particular edition is the only book actually endorsed by the Joseph Murphy Trust..<br />Several other editions out there have content that has been rehashed or otherwise altered from the original version.<br /><br />This book is fantastic... and goes into great detail...<br /><br />Many excellent points that will likely stick with me for a lifetime.<br /><br />Do not hesitate to get this book.
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|Tighter storyline than Bourne, with a less generous, but realistic, slice of action.  Satisfying ending which allows for a sequel.  Jack Reacher is a dead ringer for  a mature and hardened Tom Cruise.  You will like him and be entertained by the film.
B009AY04A8|3.0|It would be a better game if you could turn off the dialog otherwise I like it and am a fan of hidden object games
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a fun little game with mini puzzles you solve along the way up the elevator floors. Bought this game to keep me occupied on a flight. Will keep you entertained for an hour.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|A great read! Couldn't put it down! Lots of surprises at the end of the book! Can't wait to read the next book!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Ive been playing this all the time! I love horses but this is by far the best game. I do however wish you could control the gaits ur horse uses. I would recommend it!!!!!!!!!!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|For all the romantics, this book is a must read. I could not put it down. It is a book that gets into your blood.
B009AY04A8|5.0|Good fun. Fills my time needs. Am enjoying it love hidden puzzles. Games find them relaxingand a help killing pain.
B00BAHKQW4|3.0|I wanted to like this game more than I did. After all, they're not that many old school-style first-person RPGs around.Unfortuntely, this game is a bit too frustrating, especially at the beginning. You get killed a lot. I'm used to that in RPGs, but QuestLord's save system is what make's it so irritating. The game uses save points, instead of save-anywhere, and you find yourself slogging through the same locations over and over again. Also, the 8-bit graphics are as pixilated as the game's logo indicates. That would probably be less annoying on a phone than on a larger tablet screen.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|evermore helps organize ideas and the tags help you find what you need. I really like that I can sync it with all my devices so I don't lose anything :)
B008673ZAQ|5.0|My dream man except for the money. I love these books can't wait to read the last one. I wish I could live in the books that I read
B0089OBLDO|1.0|I bought this so I could use my xbox 360 controller on my ps3. First off- you need a WIRED xbox controller to make this work... second (and the seller won't tell you this) you need a MICROSOFT OFFICIAL controller- NO THIRD-PARTY controller will work properly. I have a mad catz controller and every few seconds the system will get a signal from the left d-pad button... EXTREMELY ANNOYING when you're watching netflix or amazon video (it keeps rewinding randomly), or even when you're playing a game... ANY GAME! I would return it if amazon didn't make everything so damned difficult (they ((amazon))screwed up the delivery of this product too...)
B000J10ER4|2.0|I just found it to be boring. Not much action for an action film. The plot was not bad but still kind of boring.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Good little gadget for the price. Easy to use and the apps load up quick. Hopefully soon they will add more apps like hulu and other major ones.
B000002N1E|1.0|Love the album, love the fact the album was available but the box and the CD arrrived broken on the mail.
B00884GR0W|5.0|Block Story is awesome. There are 87 different mobs, including bosses! And the world is infinite, unlike minecraft, where you can die for digging too far.Plus, at least the producers were creative enough to come up with a name that doesn'tsay &quot;craft &quot;at the end. And it's only TWO BUCKS!!! Minecraft costs seven bucks, which is way overpriced. And in the game, in creative mode, you can't die and you can fly for as long as you want! There are many biomes, including imaginary ones like Moria,which is underground, Atlantis, and Hell. But in hell everything that can spawn are monsters, which kill you. There are even floating islands! And you can go infinitely high! Overall, Block Story is not a rip off minecraft. In fact, I think minecraft is a ripoff block story! Thanks for reading.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|These are a little pricey but best quality. I was afraid to take my chances on a cheap eBay knockoff. They work as advertised. I use them for loading photos from 4 different cameras onto my iPad and love the convenience of it. Reviewing photos this way is much better than trying to review them on the small LCD screen on the camera.
B00DC7NNAC|5.0|Wizard of OZ was my favorite movie of all time for many years- it was fun to see it updated.. I love the sory line.
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|When I began reading The Lost Symbol after finishing The da Vinci Code, my expectations were very high.  After completing it, I felt that it left me feeling a little dry.  Lost Symbol was my least favorite book in the series.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My kids love this game! Great for keeping them busy while we are out waiting to eat! Download it now!
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|Good lessons on life and how to lead it. I see the agreements everyday in my life and try very hard to follow them.
074322454X|5.0|Bought it as a present and have not given it to the recipent, the individual requested it  and hope he enjoys it.
B00B9366VO|5.0|I can't wait to watch it again, had no idea so many artists recorded there. It was a blast from the past for sure.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I've never before experienced a story as seen through the eyes of a dog...phenomenal!!! Learned to appreciate racing as well......
B006S086AM|2.0|Not very funny and pretty boring. Go see The Way Way Back instead.  Its a better comming of age story and funny.
B005DJREGQ|4.0|Not much else to say other than what I said above. Funny, drama filled scenarios of high school situations... blown out of proportion of course!
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Loved this book and glad I stuck with it, but it took several months of picking up and putting down to get through the first third of the book, then I couldn't put it down.  Loved the story of Jake and Sadie, fascinating to walk through the sixties in Texas and the assassination, interesting time travel details and a really great ending.  Love Stephen King at his non horror best.
B008YKGQR4|3.0|I prefer the original free version of the Facebook app. For me this one was a little cumersome and I didn't like the interface.
B006BAEQB2|4.0|I'm not done with the book yet - but so far so good.  I love well-written historical fiction and learning about different times and places.  This is well written and keeps my interest - now into about 1/3 of book.
B0095G5AFU|4.0|I like the fact that you can create as many books that you want. Store your data or use it as a journal or for any number if things that you want to keep track of or store. It is easy to use and I have not had any trouble with it when using.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|my favorite of the cut the rope series  by far so i recomend this game to all that see my review
B006N0YWGY|4.0|I like the game because it is a little simple game that can ceep you occupied for hours racing around the swamps.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Started out pretty slow with too much emphasis on the daily activities of the protagonists. That becomes relevant later on, so it makes up for it in the end, so just be prepared for slow start.
B009AY04A8|5.0|This was an interesting game that kept my attention. Most hidden object games are boring but this is an exception. Great story line and looking forward to future games from Nevosoft!
B00CH87HF4|4.0|I loved dh3 but dh4is much better. the best part is.the storyline and the fact that they. give a voice to the character
B005D9MUWY|5.0|spot on prediction and spot on registry... Zero lag on my s3 & s2. Love it. Would definitely purchase again.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Levels change to keep you wanting to continue playing . Colorful back ground and good sounds make the game fun also thank you
B005C0DHEY|3.0|Having spent 20 years in business closely related to the oil and gas industry, it was clear from the start that this film was certainly biased.  But even considering the bias, there is still quite a bit of truth that is hard to ignore.  When a homeowner can light the gas vapor coming from the tap on their kitchen sink, you know something stinks, both literally and figuratively.  Perhaps the only thing George W. Bush ever said that I agree with was, \\"America is addicted to oil\\", and, by George, we'll do whatever we need to do to keep that fix going.  Worth seeing.
B008LVCKH6|3.0|Our book club choose this as one of our monthly reads. There were varied responses among our members. I thought it was a hoot and hilarious , unbelievable in most aspects but overall enjoyable.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Don't listen to those bad reviews. I got the upgrade and still works. This game is sooooooooo addicting. You got to get it!!!!!!!!!!!=) =)
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Love the writing, acting & location. David Tennant playing &#34;against type&#34; = delicious. I'm enjoying it enough to buy each episode here on Amazon. Long live Amazon Prime!!!
B0063M22QO|5.0|I enjoyed this game a lot. It has a lot of color to keep my interest. It has a lot of skills.
B008J34466|5.0|Just love Pink and love this cd.  Especially the duets. Dont know what to say other than love love love it
006097625X|5.0|I didn't really start getting serious with comics until I was in college, oddly enough. This work would be my first foray into the comic art, and it was a great one at that. McCloud's Understanding Comics offers something for both the novice and veteran of comics, giving the layout, history, and nuances of it to the former and revealing new insights to the latter.<br /><br />The thing that really strikes me about this work is that it is clearly a product of McCloud's experience with comics. He offers some really good points about why comics work, why they are popular, and what they say about us humans. With the writing style Scott employs, there is a healthy dose of comedy and knowledge, and he easily strings along the reader throughout the comic. We become familiar with some of the deepest mechanics at play in comics and the different regional variations. In truth, the fact that the book itself is written in comic form is partly why it is so effective. The reader learns about the medium while getting used to reading it in its natural format.<br /><br />The insight McCloud gives about art in particular is something that really stuck with me. His interpretation was something new for me, and, upon further reflection, highlights why this comic is so enjoyable. It is polished, well-founded, fun, and a true learning experience that will stay with you long after you have finished reading it. A must have for any person who enjoys comics, graphic novels, etc.
B00005NKKZ|5.0|I remember buying the album as a teenager.  When I listened to the CD I heard songs that I hadn't heard in years, and they are just as good 30 years later as they were then.  These two men were so talented.
1575666286|5.0|This is a great book with lots of natural ways in which you can overcome various illnesses.  It is not the traditional manner in which our society views illnesses, but I think it is a better way and a manner in which you can become healthy without all the side effects you receive from taking lots of drugs.
B00005JLCI|5.0|Saw this adaptation of the classic play in college, loved it. Great commentary on the makings too! Definitely a keeper!
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Give all the weather information you need.  Very easy to read and understand. A good-looking app for the price. Helps you plan your day.
B00EDF43MY|3.0|I like how u can choose what u want to do but its not as good to be 2 bux
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I can't watch anything else!  Planning on buying the full other seasons.  I enjoy the drama and you will too.
B007THA4FI|5.0|I am BEYOND tired of people comparing this book to the Harry Potter series.  People.  JK Rowlings is a WRITER, which means she will write what comes into her imagination, not just continue the same old, same old to satisfy readers who hold repetition dear.  This same criticism was railed agains Elizabeth George when she stepped back from her Dectective Inspector Lynley character and wrote a novel from a different perspective (although Lynley was tied in at the end).<br /><br />I LOVED this novel of small village life in rural England. The plot took a back seat to the wide variety of complex characters created by Rowlings - her forte, IME - and I enjoyed it immensely.  This book reveals the true lives of your neighbours - perfect family from the outside, but complex turmoil within their four walls.<br /><br />As a fussy reader, I highly recommend Casual Vacancy and am going to seek out The Cuckoo's Calling, which she wrote under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith.
B00BTHWFBK|4.0|Its good to see the Grandfathers of heavy metal back in action! \\"13\\" is the return of the original Black Sabbath line up (except for Bill Ward, who was replaced by Rage Against The Machine drummer Brad Wilk to record the album) A personal favorite track of mine from this album is \\"Live Forever\\". Though the rest of the tracks are enjoyable it is missing those old classic Tony Iommi guitar solos thus resulting in some songs sounding a bit dull or repetitive. I still recommend this album for new and old Black Sabbath fans!
B005ZKYXZI|5.0|this is my grandsons favorite movie we have watches this over 20 times lol :) we even had to come back and buy the toy robots
B00DLKXF3A|5.0|Avenged Sevenfolds latest album \\"Hail To The King\\" is definitely a crowning achievement for these metal kings. With heavy guitar riffs, full sized drum sounds, groovy bass tunes and powerful vocals, this album deserves to be album of the year. In this album you can hear a lot of old school rock/metal influences such as Metallica, Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden, Guns N' Roses and many more bands that these individuals are influenced by. \\"This Means War\\" is a prime example of a clear Metallica influence. The title song \\"Hail To the King\\" is a song that is full of energy and should be performed in a huge stadium. This is the first record the band has recorded without any writing or performing credits from their late drummer Jimmy \\"The Rev\\" Sullivan and I must say he would be very proud of his fellow band mates for making this album. A personal favorite track of mine from this album is \\"Requiem\\" because of the symphonic introduction along with the metal guitar riff verses and solos.  Another favorite track of mine is \\"Crimson Day\\". Crimson Day is a ballad of the album and gives off that \\"Nothing Else Matters by Metallica\\" vibe to it but with their own twist.  In recent interviews the band stated that they studied bands such as Black Sabbath, Megadeth, Pantera, Metallica and many more before making the album to see what they did to make such successful and life long lasting albums.  One thing I always admired and respected about this band is how they evolve and mature with new album they make. They are the current and future kings of metal in my personal opinion. I look forward to seeing them for the fourth time in Orlando on October 16 for the \\"Hail To The King\\" tour.  Like I said before, this album deserves to be ALBUM OF THE YEAR!. [[ASIN:B00EOO55GW Hail to the King]]
B008XG1X18|5.0|YES thank you for getting me started on Pinterest..my friend Kari asked me to join I said there was nothing on it for me..then my daughter in law Ginger set me up and showed me ALL the things it covered.I can safely say there is something for everyone..it has just about everything on it..Im Hooked

B009KS4XRO|5.0|It's a great game and addictive.glad I got introduced into it have been playing a year and like it have tried other ones I like the rooms
630587493X|5.0|i loved this movie when I was younger and now the themes ring in my adult mind. Highly Recommended! buy this!
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|Contains multiple arrangements of the game. Enough to keep interested in continue playing the game without being bored of it.
B004HY9NKI|5.0|Good movie.  Funny and over the top at times but there is a lot of truth behind the themes that are presented. Immigration laws and regulations need reform.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|Does the job for me. Nice feature of selection whether touching the icon on the screen brings light on instantly or just opening the app and then making a choice. You can select any color to show on the display. Haven't had much need for that except for having the screen white for a not so harsh light that uses less battery.
B0095VP8D4|4.0|I do just basic gaming and it handles it well with the built in Radeon graphics. At some point in the future I will probably add in a graphics card to supplement what comes on the processor. All in all a very capable base for a system. Only complaint is that it uses more power than the Intel processors.
B00070DK14|5.0|Just filling out my Jethro Tull collection. I love everything they do so there were no surprises here. very good.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|I love Lady Gaga and am so glad she is back and performing again.  Her VMA performance of Applause was show stopping and I will buy tickets to the next tour when they go on sale.  Quirky Original and a true singing talent!
1932735410|1.0|This was loaded with inaccurate and outdated material, it was returned for a full refund. I'm surprised that Amazon continues to sell Rita Mulcahy books, she has been dead for a few  years now.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Such a good book!  Packed with action and a love story! I have nothing more to say.  20 characters omg
1580176941|1.0|this book was lackluster, there isn't one thing I've liked that I have made. The photos are poor quality, the recipes are typical. I wish I had seen it prior to purchasing.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Of all the bingo games I play this is my favorite. It is fun working on the collections from the different countries
030788743X|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. Once I finished it, I picked it right back up and read it again.<br /><br />I loved the way the eighties and video game culture were mixed together in the book. I've already bought the book for a few friends, and will most likly buy it for those I haven't gotten it for yet.
B002MEW7YY|5.0|Outstanding to great  singing and vocal acting by all.  Attractive production and costumes. One of the best performances of Lucia I have ever seen.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Good movie, hit you in the end with a great twist.  Also a good amount of action. I would recommend it.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|Perhaps the star of the movie, for me, is Paris.  Interesting story, very well acted.  Great combination of fantasy and reality.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I enjoy this game. The rooms are progressively more challenging. They were hard enough to keep me guessing and searching.
B00EEDJM2Q|4.0|Great game. Uses your brain. Sometimes the cursor does not cut all the buttons. Keep trying because it does work!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Really good game but ads do get in the way, even better on kindle fire hd this is a game that really needs clear imagery
B007AL48UK|4.0|Different than other Mahjong games. It is fun for the summer and has neat music! Some of them are very hard!
B005MMY9A8|5.0|Tempering its sweeping scope with wit, humor, and just a little dose of dramatics, Thor is a super-charged fantasy epic that can stand alone in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
B0000DIXDR|5.0|This movie is chalked full of memories, as I grew up in the 60's!  Also, I was so happy when my children loved and embraced it!
B00358ESI4|5.0|A well told war story with great acting.  It kept me glued to the screen till the very end. You may need to have a box of tissues close by.
B005LJK3AC|4.0|Funny actors helped make the movie.  Aniston killed it and cracked us all up.  I know she was just doing the script, but she sounded believable
B00BIPORC8|4.0|The second season was not quite as good as the first and third but it was still a really fun watch.
B000JMKRKC|5.0|It felt like a new approach to writing a story.  The &#34;twinness&#34; seemed a possibility.  Some shocking parts, which added to the story.  Very different read.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|The graphic is good and smooth. The story plot is kind of interesting. It's a good game to spend a boring holiday evening.
B005CRQ4OW|4.0|AWESONE! Funny I love that book Rowly zoo wee mama!<br />I love all of the characters it was so good
B00E5Q1HJS|4.0|I wish that if this timeline is suppose to be from the early days, that the enterprise look more technically advanced then even Jon luc Picard rode around in. Wha-what?
B003WE9TU8|3.0|I gave it three out of five because it was very entertaining and certainly different from the movie. Rather than a big disaster situation it was told in hindsight as a series of oral histories. I loved the way it was the whole world fighting for a cause rather than country against country. I liked the way we saw the beginning, with patient zero. I likes the way we were told about the spread from country to country. I liked the way people tried their own ways to combat and the way they regrouped. It did bug me that we weren't told how the disease died down. May be the virus burned out as zombies were destroyed, I would reccomend this to anyone who likes stories told as oral histories rather than in first or third person narrative. Good read all the same.
B008BQ8YHQ|4.0|The writers aren't as smart as their characters like to claim they are. But there is enough to entertain you. Louis Litt and Rachel keep us coming back.
B00AHQNHSY|5.0|So my kindle fire HD had a bunch of videos and movies but couldn't watch them till I got the mobo player now I finally have all my shows on it and I can finally watch them when im on long trips :) yay!!
B005544TRQ|4.0|The writers aren't as smart as their characters like to claim they are. But there is enough to entertain you. Louis Litt and Rachel keep us coming back.
B000GOUMPI|5.0|This is one of best horror movies I have ever watched. It is well done story and had fatalistic actors.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Karl Urban plays an amazingly good Judge Dread! This is one of the best adaptations of a violent comic I can think of.  It is very violent, and not for the faint of heart or those who distain violence in their movies.  Karl Urban plays a great Dredd, and is quickly becoming one of my favorite sci-fi actors (I think he plays McCoy in the new Star Trek amazingly well).  Olivia Thirlby is great as the rookie Anderson, and provides the perfect character to balance Dredd.  The visuals are really good for such a relatively low budget film ($35 Mil).  They create a gritty, dirty, unpolished environment with a visual styling that matches the Dredd world perfectly.  The slowmo drug scenes are amazingly well done, and provide a great way to show slow motion sequences that are violently beautiful.  They aid in the story vs. just being slow motion for slow motion sake.  I already loved Lena Heady in Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles, and her role here as Ma-Ma is great.  This movie is NOTHING like the previous attempts at Judge Dredd, and really provides at Dredd that dark sci-fi fans should love.  It's a movie that I really hope gets a sequel because they have laid the groundwork with Urban and Thirlby for a great series of movies.  Although the chances of that happening are slim given that it only grossed just over $40 Mil (Worldwide) in its run.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|Everything in this album has to do with the number 8 and octaves in general. There are 8 songs, 8 pages in the booklet, each image has something with 8 on it (such as an octopus), the first song in in 1/8th time, the second in 2/8th and so on. But about the actual music, it's really quite good. Dream Theater always manages to capture a sense on intensity, awe and imagination into everything they do. Every time I listen to this album it sounds better and I hear new things that I didn't catch the first time.
159448385X|4.0|Loved this book - about women.  Tough to read sometimes because it's a painful story, but the writing is beautiful.
B000021XS0|5.0|Truly the best album of all time. Listening to this is really an incredible experience. You are brought into a different world for 117 minutes and the world is amazing. The songs flow together perfectly but each can be listened to and enjoyed separately. The chorus's never get repetitive or boring because each new time one is sung, its sung from a different character's perspective. The whole album feels like a play, and it even has a list of characters and an act break to back this up. Dream Theater is a band that really lives up to their name. Listening to there music is like going to a private theater inside your head. Solo's an instrumental pieces are there for a reason, they add to the story and you can actually picture the characters in action as you listen. If you are a fan of metal, progressive metal, rock or just good music in general I fully recommend this cd.
0743289692|5.0|Reads like a thriller.  Super hard stuff here, but a very honest, critical look at Islam.  Unemotionally told and factual, from someone who has every reason to be emotional about the topic.
B0081JPTCQ|4.0|A variety of nice functions and easy to use, but seems not very convenient on a mobile phone as a result of the small screen. Prefer some other apps rather than this one.
B00DYEN5QU|1.0|Bad script, bad actors! Christopher Reeves is still the best Superman today..I walked out of the movie theater 30 mins into it and was not impressed..
B00AY5B712|5.0|One of the few movies I can enjoy again and again, consistently brings a smile to my face. Ideally cast.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I'm a full grown adult and have this game on all my devices! Although my 3yr old nephew has a better score then me lol
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Didn't think I would like the show and I absolutely love it. You can really relate with the characters and get engrossed in their lives. Who knows what's yet to come
B00DC7NNAC|3.0|Not bad, but not great, maybe a bit too long in my opinion for what it is. Definitely belonging to the recent trend of movies that remake old stories into Dark, Loud unnecessarily intense versions of the original. I don't regret renting and watching it, but probably won't ever watch it again.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I can't live without Twitter. This was easy to download for my device and easy to use. Can't beat that.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Based on what I see has a lot of potential.  The question is how it will show in the long run but it is fun.
B009EELBIS|5.0|My daughter and wife love this movie! I recommend it for any family home movie library. Who doesn't enjoy a good old-fashioned musical.
B001JI5DRC|5.0|You know when you're lounging on the couch, surfing cable, and one of THOSE movies comes on that you've seen a dozen times but HOOKS you into finishing it every single time? No matter what part of the movie is showing? This is one of those movies. As soon as the rocket leaves Earth it's just a non-stop entertainment spectacle and everyone in the family can watch it. It's worth purchasing through Amazon's streaming video service, too ( and no, I don't work for Amazon).
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|We need more time to try all the birds.<br />I don't have eleven more words.<br />Thank you for angry Birds.
B0080SW3CC|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. Unlike Grapes of Wrath, this book moves pretty fast, it's one scene after another. For as short as it is, the characters are well developed. My only issue is that the ending. I do understand why Steinbeck ended it the way he did, and it's very appropriate. Nonetheless, I did want just a little bit more.<br /><br />either way, it's a great read<br /><br />**Edit** After thinking about the ending a bit more, I realized that it was just perfect. Similar to Grapes of Wrath, where I wanted to know what happened after that last page, but in reality it just didn't matter. It the ending expressed 100% what it wanted to express and there was nothing more to add.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Fun and fairly easy to play. Some levels may be a bit more challenging than they seem at first, however.
B000002MFE|5.0|This is an amazing album, it's what made me want to get an acoustic guitar. Nothing else to say, besides it's amazing!
B007EECSFA|5.0|The Secret Keeper is probably the best Kate Morton book I've read.  I also liked<br />The Distant Hours, but The Secret Keeper was even better than that one.  It is well<br />written, well-researched, and it keeps the reader interested all the way through until<br />the fascinating end.
0385349947|5.0|Author of the book Lean In is Sheryl Sandberg, chief operating officer at Facebook and a former vice president at Google.  In August, 2011, she was ranked by Forbes  as the fifth most powerful woman in the world.  Yet, this happily married, mother of two says “I still face situations that I fear are beyond my capabilities, but I know how to take a deep breath and keep my hand up. I have learned to sit at the table.”<br /><br />That’s what she advises women to do in this book which she calls a “sort of feminist manifesto.”  She makes a case for leaning in, for being ambitious in any pursuit.  “Don’t stand back,” she admonishes, “lean in, go for it, keep your hand up, sit at the table. Take risks, choose growth, challenge yourself, and ask for a promotion (with a smile  on your face, of course). Don’t wait for power to be offered , take it!”<br /><br />First and foremost, according to Sandberg, “women are hindered by the barriers that exist within themselves.”  We women, she says, have been influenced by gender stereotypes, introduced in childhood and reinforced throughout our lives.  Therefore, we internalize negative messages such as it’s wrong for women to be outspoken and aggressive.  Being firm and strong violates unwritten rules about acceptable social conduct. Instead be “pretty like Mommy and smart like Daddy.”<br /><br />THE MYTH OF DOING IT ALL<br /><br />Sandberg knows that women can’t do it all, although she has tried.  At Google, she would lock her door and use a breast pump during conference calls.<br />She quotes Gloria Steinem who said it best: “You can’t do it all. No one can have two full time jobs , have perfect children, cook three meals a day, and be multi-orgasmic ‘til dawn.”<br /><br />CHOOSING A HUSBAND<br /><br />Sandberg says that husband “Dave and I have had our share of the bumps on our path to achieving a roughly fifty-fifty split, but I do have a husband who is a real partner.”  She advises that “if you want a fifty-fifty partnership, establish that pattern at the onset.” That partnership will model behavior for the next generation.<br /><br />Those men do exist. My Bob (Stapleton) took personal pride in my accomplishments, encouraged me 100 percent, and sometimes put on a pot of beans when we needed something to eat.  It all started after I had spent all night stuffing envelopes on a mailing for a woman candidate. Next morning, at the breakfast table, Bob said “Sweet baby, if you’re going to spend your life in other people’s campaigns, you might as well run yourself.” With his support, I did run, and won a seat in the Oklahoma House of Representatives, where I stayed for ten years.<br /><br />My Bob has been gone two years, and life is tough without him.<br /><br />In conclusion, I leave you with this thought which, in my mind, summarizes the content of Sheryl Sandberg’s book:  A man of quality is not threatened by a woman of equality.
B00CRS88IO|3.0|I haven't gotten to this novel as yet but being familiar with Ian Fleming's previous work it should hold my interest as well

B002XURC24|5.0|This book is very easy to read and has wonderful and helpful information. I'm starting to read it a 2nd time today!
1932100660|5.0|Conclusive information for anyone serious about their health.  Much technical to slog through, but worth the time to read and understand.
B00E5Q1HJS|1.0|I enjoyed the first one and think they did a good job of blending the old and the new in an interesting way.  Not so this one. At all.<br /><br />If you are in any way a Star Trek fan, avoid this.  The only similarities to any of the characters in this are the names.  The personalities, the feel, and who the characters are in the original episodes bear no resemblance whatsoever to anything in this movie.  It was flat, predictable, and nauseatingly trite; and not in a fun adn campy way.<br /><br />It is like going to a concert by a cover artist of your favorite rock band and they play poorly executed horrible karaoke elevator music versions of your favorite songs.  You can identify what it was supposed to have been, but in the end you are sorry you bothered trying.
B000I8JEY2|1.0|Didn't get past the first 3 minutes.  My ears were tired of the profanity that soon. Just not my thing.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|worth checking out ll<br /><br />worth checking out. you think youve figured out a level but ur left looking for one more clue!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I could not wait to watch Season 3 and now I cannot wait until Season 4 is available in the US.  I was not happy with the ending of the season but I will not give any spoilers away.  This is a must watch for someone looking at finding a great series to watch!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|A good read. Although not entirely believable.  I find it  hard to believe that  none of their luggage was ever sear checked, inspected  or anything. Else. The ending was a let down.  And the authorities just let go.
B009IH0ICG|5.0|This is a good little chimney starter.  It starts coals quickly and is well-constructed.  It is compact so holds a little over half as much as the big chimneys.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Just like the Hunger Games, I'm hooked.  As soon as I finished book one, I purchased book two.  I'll let you know how that comes out!  Can't imagine how they'll do a movie on this book, unless they rate it X!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game is very addicting, played this game all through couldn't  put it down.  Mini games really make you think.
B0012QRPU4|4.0|all very realistic characters, sets, etc.  It is satisfying to see an underdog doing what an underdog sometimes must do
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is incredibly sad, but very well written.  I feel like I knew each character and was right there with them.  A great love story.
B005PK56TA|5.0|You don't see many tv series that are this magnetic! If you haven't seen it then you must! Great job
B000BISBDY|4.0|I'm not really a country music fan, but every once in a while I just have the urge to listen to some Johnny Cash. This satisfies those urges successfully. Some of the songs are too simple to really enjoy, but there are some really great ones on here too. I don't really know anything about him other than Joaquin made a cool flick about the guy so I can't say if this is his best music or not. I like it, so I bought it, and I got a free MP3 download when I did so I'm happy.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|I have no troubles with this app. It's easy to use and navigate, and I'm  able to quickly look up trends and post tweets. If you have a Twitter, this app just makes it more accessible.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|So I bought this device thinking it would work with more apps on my iPad then I expected.  It didn't.  So now I want to return it.<br /><br />To be clear, I bought this through Google Play and NOT through Amazon.<br /><br />I love Google, but now I'm completely rethinking this given the following return process:<br />1) Take 10 minutes searching about how to return the item.  On Google...<br />2) Finally find a phone number, call it, and then wait 10 minutes until a rep answers the phone due to \\"high volume\\".  That's right, in 2013 when you want to return a Google Chromecast, your only option is to pick up the phone and CALL THEM.  No chat, no email, no page to return my stuff, not even from the original confirmation or Google Wallet that can I find.  What?!?!?!<br />3) I then get a hold of a rep, but she's not in the returns department.  So she sends my request over to that department.<br />4)  Wait another 24-48 hours before I get an email with an RMA and shipping label to return this thing.<br />5) Then I apparently, finally, get to go through all the normal fun of returning an item.<br /><br />Oh, and their return policy is 15 days from the day you get the item.  How customer friendly.<br /><br />And yes, this is all when you purchase from GOOGLE, arguably the greatest technology company at the moment, in the year 2013.  WHAT?!?!  Those of you that ordered from someone that understands eCommerce (Yeah Amazon) where you can actually return stuff at the click of a button (literally), and after 5 years of hundreds of orders only call their customer service department once, consider yourselves lucky.<br /><br />And lastly, Google, I hope that you're searching this Amazon page.  Otherwise there's no way you're fixing this problem.  Because when I told the sales rep that finding how to return an item was the hardest I've experienced from an online retailer, maybe ever, she flat out ignored me.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I have season 1 and 2 and now 3.  Looking forward to season 4 with great expectation.  I enjoy British films very much.

B004FDPOHC|5.0|I thought that Tron: Legacy, the love letter to Tron, was spectacular. So of course I was going to like the soundtrack. Basically I see the movie play in my mind while listening to this, which is an observation posted in variations by others. Not much else to add that folks have not already posted.
B008FTAAG2|5.0|The whole album is Great!!! Can't believe it didn't cost more. I saw them live at KC Throttle fest 2013 and it was a great performance!
0307341550|3.0|Although Flynn is an excellent writer and weaves a spellbinding story, ultimately the book was way too dark and ugly for me. Too many vicious, sadistic characters and unspeakable acts of cruelty. Sensitive readers, beware.

0307463745|3.0|\\"Rework\\" is an example of the business-inspirational genre by the founders of 37Signals, a software company. I like 37Signals because they're straightforward, even pithy, and because founder Jason Fried has some right-on things to say about business culture, such as the stupidity of insisting that all workers come to an office and stay for eight hours, whether they are productive there or not. \\"Rework\\" follows the format of a lot of these books, which alternates extremely short chapters with crude page-sized art. Usually this format follows naturally when the author is reworking his blog into a book, which is the case here.<br /><br />A lot of the little chapters pretend to upend the common wisdom. There are chapters titled \\"Welcome Obscurity,\\" \\"Good Enough is Fine\\" and \\"Drug Dealers Get It Right.\\" This gives even completely passive readers the feeling of boldly thinking outside the box. There is a chance, I suppose, that some readers really will be jolted  into changing their way of thinking, and I think that's what the authors are aiming for. But I'm skeptical. You're either ready to be bold, or you're not, and if you are ready, you'll quickly find your own path and won't need this book.<br /><br />Ultimately, \\"Rework\\" is not a lot different from a traditional book of business wisdom (say, \\"Winning\\" by Jack Welch of GE). People are hungry for advice and seek it from those they consider brilliant, and what higher proof of brilliance is there than success in the market? But consider: 37Signals began as a Web-design company just as the Web was becoming a truly mass phenomenon. The company then switched to developing Web apps just as the iPhone came out and apps became a very big commercial thing. These guys are very smart, no doubt, but they're also lucky; like the rock musicians of the `50s and `60s, they were there just as the market demanded their particular skills for the very first time. If they'd been born ten years earlier or later, they would have found much less rewarding outlets or would have faced much stiffer competition.<br /><br />If you've already begun a startup company, this book may be the encouragement you need and may even give you a few good ideas. If you're looking for a book to inspire you to action, look within yourself instead.less rewarding outlets or would have faced much stiffer competition.<br /><br />If you've already begun a startup company, this book may be the encouragement you need and may even give you a few good ideas.

B00C1BU7V8|5.0|I know I'm not the only one to rave about Daniel Day-Lewis and the entire cast.  I love history, and this one got it right.  Excellent... watched it 3 times and still not tired of it.
1611761115|3.0|This is a great book about the fundamentals of selling.  The author also mentions great canonical books as follow-on reads.  However, please do not listen to the audiobook.  The author himself reads it and he will often pause mid-sentence as if he forgot what words came next, lost his position in the book or was baffled by the words coming next.  Great one liners in the book are ruined because of this and the book is nearly intolerable as an audio version.  Authors - please take note, rarely do you have two great talents!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I am grateful to John Grisham for writing stories that reveal the corruption in our legal system. This book does just that, but with a larger-than-life protagonist. The guy is just too smart; it makes me wonder if a person would be capable of planning such an intricate payback, heist, expose'--and carrying it off! But then again, if I had five years behind bars to think about it maybe I could develop something that imaginative. Or maybe Grisham used himself for the model of the smart, victimized attorney...

B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very fun game. Presents as great challenge for anyone. Myself and my 11 year old daughter enjoyed playing it! Would recommend this to anyone who . Likes puzzle games.
B00D7JGL36|5.0|I have never been disappointed in a Vince Gill album but this one is at the top!  I loved Buck Owens and Merle Haggard.  Vince and Paul have done an outstanding job of bringing back just a taste of their music.<br /><br />After owning this CD for a while I had to come back and say more.  My first favorite was 'I 'Can't Be Myself' but after several plays I found myself going back to 'Holding Things Together'. I have played this one over and over, can't get enough. Just when you think this wonderful recording is ending, it doesn't.  What a masterful instrumental!<br /><br />I only wish these two would do this again, maybe pick two more artists from that great period when country music was the way it should be.  If they made a dozen of these I would buy every one.<br /><br />If this doesn't win a Grammy there is no justice in the world.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|great show and Julianna Margulies is so fun to look it. she's hot. it's really great to have amazon prime & be able to watch these shows. B & N nook has nothing like it so I never use it. this coming from a man who has 8 computers, 4 tablets, this iPod touch, 6 portable external hard drives & so many memory cards, I not going to count them all, and lots of Bluetooth  toys to play with they keep me busy. and I'm so pathetic I think I'll get another Mac, how tupid
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Adam Brown's life story is one that every young man needs to read. In fact, it is a book every man needs to read. His live is a testimony to Proverbs 22:6 which states that when you,.. &#34;Train up a child in the way he should go, when he is old, he will not depart from it. Adan's  story is a great example of how God uses the most unlikely people for His purposes and for His glory. After reading this book, I wish that I could have the privilege to meet Adam Brown. His character, service to his country & other,his love of family, and his relationship with Jesus Christ had a tremendous impact on me as I read this book.<br /><br />J.

B008JFLWLE|5.0|This a very cool app. When I need to do quick math it is way more easier to use than the calculators. I can write faster than I can enter on the keypad. The more I use it, the more I love it. It's super easy to revise your calculations as you're working on them. Just \\"write\\" your edits over the existing calculation. Try it out!!
B001OGWY1W|2.0|Too dark for my taste. I am not sure what made me watch it to the end. Guess I thought the ending would help but it left me even more disappointed.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Takes you behind the scenes of the home front before and during the war. Rounds out the picture of WWII.
B005QN3ANK|1.0|This album is absolutely horrible. There wasn't one song that had the same catchy tune style of their previous two albums. And, worse, there wasn't one ballad at all...not even a bad one. This was, perhaps, the biggest waste of $20 I ever had.
B007SGM084|5.0|I couldn't stop reading once I started. Super sexy and erotic yes. But I loved the story of these two people. I thought this was going to be just a smutt book but I was wrong. I laughed I cried.....
B0067RQYNW|1.0|I couldn't figure out how to name word docs, saving was a pain tn the neck, and there was a lag between hitting the keys and the app recognizing it which lead to a ton of misspelling.
B005LVR6ZA|5.0|It's PKD what can one say? He creates his own wacky world where the rules he makes fit. At the same time his incredible sense of humor and snappy dialogue coupled with compelling characters make his large body of work a must-read for everyone who wants to digest the literary &#34;canon.&#34; Although he is routinely called science fiction, which he certainly is as there is plenty of wacky science and fiction, I think Dick transcends genre and should be considered a great literary fiction delight.
B00AQTY3XA|5.0|This is a great movie. They did a good job at re making something that went down in the surf world awhile back. I remember when it happened so its really cool to be able to watch that moment over and over.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|really interesting and gets you hooked from the beginning and leaves you hanging at the end.  Very good and entertaining
B005544TRQ|5.0|Wonderful show, I got hooked and watched the first season in 2 days.  Started Second season yesterday and have already watched the first 4 shows, and no I am not a giant fat guy.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|So fun  I love it I wouldn't want to be the person without it. The only bad thing with this game is you need WiFy
B009POCFTG|5.0|I saw this movie and knew I had to own it.  It is extremely disturbing...the chicken scene was so intense and bizarre.  But Matthew McConnaghy is excellent in a difficult role.  This movie will stay with you and haunt you for years to come.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This a really fun game I use when I have to pass some time. App works well with my Kindle, have not had any problems with it.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Although already a &#34;believer&#34; I found this to be a very facinating read.  The doctor as a neurosurgeon added greatly to the credibility of the story
B009AY04A8|5.0|This is a really awesome game. Hooked on it as soon as I started pkaying it. I highly recommend this game.
1781162646|5.0|Had never read a Stephen King novel before and was really pleased at how well written and captivating he made this story. Have recommended it to many others.
B0067RQYNW|2.0|The fit and finish of this product was very good, and I had high hopes. Alas, it won't work for me because it won't open or otherwise accept .rtf files (rich text format). These are fairly basic files, so I was shocked I couldn't use them. All of my writing files are .rtf, created using WordPad on my PC, and I'm not going through the effort of converting them to something else. This was a deal killer for me.
B000Q66QAG|1.0|It will not play on my dvd player, nor my blu-ray player.  It may be the version that this movie is in.  Junk.
0375703764|4.0|I really liked how this book was very different from any other &#34;haunted house&#34; book or story I've read in a while.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|The cars are awesome and fast the best racing game by far well worth the money<br />Cons the barrel roll ramp makes u wreck so do not ramp.
B00BBI9WD6|5.0|I have really enjoyed the Honor Harrington series. One of the MUST READ series of space scifi. Will buy more!
B001HNE3NO|5.0|This book is a good story and well written.  It contains mystery, history and human interest.  I found the book to be informative of the plight of the Jews that lived in Paris in 1942.  It is a real page turner.
B000H305U0|4.0|I HAD 2 REORDER THIS C.D. I HAD IT ONCE BEFORE BUT SOMEONE WALK WITH IT @ IT NEVER CAME BACK HOME
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|What a flat ending that could have used a few words of encouragement and hope, that one finds in actual life.  I guess the movies may be entertainment but the books were rather a waste of my time.
B004I8WD7S|5.0|Great cheap case by Amazon.  Fits perfect on my iphone 4s and has protected it for months already.<br /><br />You cannot beat this price!
B00B9366VO|5.0|Dave Grohl has done music fans a huge favor by making this documentary.<br />It is really well done and holds up to multiple viewing.<br />It's an amazing story about the dumpy Sound City studio where some of the greatest rock records of the 70s and 80s were made by rock's elite.. It was a studio that catered to musicians who actually knew how to play their instruments and play them well together in a band situation. This is a must-see for music fans.
B003YHSE7W|5.0|Great movie, fun to watch, get the popcorn. This is a dvd for the family and for those who love a super hero.
B00CL68BK2|1.0|Crazy older guy gets saved by crazy younger girl.<br />How this movie was so well-received is absolutely beyond me.<br />Awful.
B0073SPDHM|5.0|I just started making home made ice cream and I have tried many of the recipes in this book.  It is well written and easy to understand.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Really interesting g mix of history and novel, at times it was too involved with details.  You just wanted it to move along.  The characters are all interesting, well developed and so believable.  There are just too many of them.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Love this game! Very easy  to  play. One of the few games that helps you by giving you friends to Visit so you can complete quests.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Loved the realism and revealing the struggles he had.  Don't feel this tried to tear Lincoln down in spite of his mistakes and imperfections.
B007ZCQJOM|5.0|This album will cause spontaneous interpretive dancing and feelings of euphoria. Better listened to at maximum volume.<br /><br />Listen. Dance. Love.<br /><br />You're Welcome.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I sometimes feel that my time is wasted when I watch DVDs.  No so with Downton Abbey.  This is a great series.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|I enjoyed this first introduction very much! It leaves you wanting more..i wish it was longer..<br />Who can blame him? You Go Walt..
B0066WJLU6|5.0|I got tired of straining my eyes in way-to-dark restaurants and trying to read their tiny font menus... Save your eyes the strain - I highly recommend this flashlight for that purpose!!!
B0083GOVLW|5.0|most engaging was the heroine as a little girl. overall, the film is a testament to the poetic power of understatement...especially visually.
B000HKYOK0|4.0|Although dated and very tame by today's standards, Star Trek's first season had interesting and entertaining stories.<br />My favorite episode is The City on the Edge of Forever.
B008HVMQ4W|5.0|I downloaded Brideshead because it's a book I re-read regularly. It's beautifully written, profound with a compelling plot. and Evelyn Waugh's humour is legendary.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|After having watched all of the other Star Trek spinoff movies and TV series, I found this one to be right up near the top.  It was fast moving, contained appropriate amounts of comic relief, and a gripping climax.  Unlike other Star Trek shows, this one did not contain too many funky aliens.  I recommend this movie highly, even though you don't have the rental option.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|I like many have had doubts regarding the teachings I have been exposed to in my life. Mr Aslan has cleared so many of them.  Truly a well written book with believable facts that fit in to my previous musings.  I fell this is a book that should be read by everyone.
B00ATDOVNK|3.0|Even after reading many reviews that it was pricey, i played the free version, I went ahead and paid the 4.99 for the full version.  The game is decent but like most think 4.99 is to high for this game.  I will think twice before I pay that much again.
B003G4W49C|5.0|... title says it all. 15 more words you say? Almost there c'mon lemme post it right about now. Yay
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|So fun and relaxing. I have the other Quell games and have so enjoyed playing them. I am hoping they make more!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is a great book. I can read this book again and again. Suzanne Collins imagination is so well written.
B003U51D58|5.0|Season 6 was a great ending to a phenomenal journey throughout this show.  I really enjoyed finally getting to know how everything ended.
B0055D3EFU|4.0|Good movie. Wish more thought went into the ending though. The sound effects were well done. I will watch the sequel
B007AL48UK|5.0|Simple, good variety of board layouts, friendly hint structure, tracks your best times. Great way to relax and pass some time!
B008673ZAQ|3.0|Great time reading this novel!<br />Nice write, good history ...<br />I recommend.<br />This history is very entertaining.<br />Try it! You could get same great hours reading.
B0012GTZFC|5.0|I read about this book in Phil Jackson's Eleven Rings and decided to give it a chance.  Really glad I did.  It has in many ways changed my way of looking at things and on the other hand confirmed those that seemed instinctive.  If you looking for a different perspective from the norm, pick this one up.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Amazing!!!!<br />I need more, more and more...<br />This is THE book! I read again and ...<br />Three books isn't`enough. Certainly it´s the best  book.<br />I Want more Fifty Shades...please!
B000W453KQ|5.0|I never tire of seeing this movie. Its so full of passionate characters and heart wrenching love. If you haventever watched it, you might want to grab some tissues, Ive seen it and it still makes me weep.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Amazing!!!!<br />I need more, more and more...<br />Three books isn't`enough. Certainly it´s the best  book.<br />I Want more Fifty Shades...please!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I could not put this book down. Meals didn't get cooked, I missed a lot of sleep, laundry piled up , but I didn't care!!!!
B00846REIS|5.0|Great time reading this novel!<br />Nice write, good history ...<br />I recommend and I´m intend to continue reading this trilogy.<br />I loved it.
B00ECU2RGY|3.0|M83 did a really good job on the soundtrack, but the movie itself felt kinda dull. Plus the movie does almost nothing to hide one of it's &#34;big reveals&#34;.<br /><br />Overall it was worth a watch, but one viewing was enough.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Amazing!!!!<br />I need more, more and more...<br />Three books isn't`enough. Certainly this is  the most interesting  book.<br />I Want more Fifty Shades...!<br />I love it, definitely
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The &#34;realness&#34; of the book is heartwrenching.  You truly care about the characters and are heartbroken when tragedy hits them.<br /><br />It is a sad book, as the young characters have illnesses and, as I said, tragedy finds them.<br /><br />I would say this is like reading John Green's other book, &#34;Looking For Alaska&#34;.
B008AIGWVA|3.0|I think this was a pretty good app. I think that this app was really funny when you used the phone.
B006S086AM|5.0|This is an interesting and different coming of age story with a few twists that make it memorable. Eisenberg is good in every movie, I think.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book from beginning to end. could not put it down. I highly recommend this book. you will not regret reading it.
B0053TMP24|4.0|It is a good book. This book has Percy in it but no Annabeth who is my favorite character. Other than that, it is a good book.
0711986746|5.0|I encourage anyone who remains captivated by the late, complex, perfectionist genius, Freddie Mercury, to read this thorough, elegant, data-rich book by Peter Freestone.<br /><br />The author (whom we also see commenting in varying Queen documentaries) starts the book with an invaluable list of \\"players\\" who populated Freddie's life.  He ends the book with updates on as many as he can offer.<br /><br />All told, this is an uncommonly literate offering by an emotionally and psychologically whole, cultured gentleman of true character, caring, and keen insight---an uncommon man with an eye almost as meticulous as that of the man he served for well over a decade and came to understand on many levels, thru the tragic and premature end.<br /><br />The information the reader can glean from each and every event the author chooses to share,  builds a rich, insightful, and so, gratifying portrait of who Freddie Mercury truly was, and often, WHY.  That he was adverse to driving (his mind was far too busy with more important things to waste time having to pay attention to the road); a telling account of one of infinite instances when the author was sent to Sotheby's or Christie's to secure yet another precious item for Freddie at auction (this, time, a painting); Mr. Freestone was first given a limit of 250k pounds, that was then raised to 280.  But, the back bidder kept going. The author, with trepidation, hung in to well over 300K.....and then stopped.  When Freddie found out he did not get the painting, he yelled at the author, `YOU KNOW I WANTED THE PAINTING, YOU SHOULD HAVE KEPT GOING!\\"<br /><br />Would we all might have a friend of this rare caliber!  Freddie had many, from many walks of life, each one...earned.<br /><br />All four members of Queen (in its day, a huge, international entity employing infinite humans), distinguished themselves within the industry, beyond their individual gifts, via uncommonly high intelligence and professionalism.  Happily, we may now say the same about Peter Freestone.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|I bought the book, and after reading it I was motivated to try it.  It's really simple, and they give you a lot of suggestions about how you can successfully do it.  I'm sure I'm fasting as strictly as in the book, but I've still lost 8 lbs., and at 59 that's not easy.  My husband has even tried it and lost a few pounds.
B000I9W08I|5.0|Love this film. Barbra Streisand has the voice of an angel, and quite the actress to boot. Gene Kelly's direction is sheer perfection. Extremely entertaining.
B005NAD6Q2|1.0|I had not read Plum for some time so thought I would give this a go. Do you understand Family bail bonds? Do you care? Sorry chaps, chapter 2 and I have had enough - it's going in the delete bin.<br /><br />Oh I feel so much better.
B0037QM8YA|5.0|Just mesmerizing. Precious was a superb actress. Sometimes it had you on the edge of your chair. Thank God for those in this world who care.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Some books take you a while to get into. This book was riveting from the start. I think I read it in three days tops. The author keeps you invested in the characters lives and paints a picture of wartime Germany many have never thought of.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|great casting and tongue in cheek writing, good story, ridiculous equipment such as flying aircraft carrier makes for an entertaining popcorn movie.
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|Really liked the concept of the book.  I did try the experiments, some worked, and some didn't BUT it made me much aware of what is going on around me and I think that was a really important thing.<br /><br />I do recommend the book.
B001D0DQUC|5.0|I have loved this movie since it first came out. Its fun and very enjoyable. Not heavy, light and fun. An old stand by movie to watch.
B006UUK612|4.0|I fist saw this movie in the theater, When I saw it on prime I wanted to see it again. I have it on VHS but it just don't work as well now a days. It is just a fun show for everyone
B007Z58RLC|4.0|I have read this book before, but this is the first time as an ebook.  I am surprised at the number of typos.  I don't remember that in the hard copy, but it is possible that I am forgetting.  Nevertheless, an excellent book for me. (4 stars bec. of the typos).
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was suggested to me by probably 6 different people, so I finally got around to reading it, begrudgingly. Now, I am NOT the type of person that cries when reading...movies, sure. Books? Nope. But this was a completely different story - I will warn you that I cried to the point of having a snot bubble I think, so be careful! But I still highly recommend it.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Enjoyed seeing all these well known, seasoned actors working together. Enjoyed the plot, the action, etc. and am looking forward to Reds 2.
B0023SDPS6|3.0|Since I like the new TV series :Longmire, I thought this book would be a good read.<br />WRONG! I starts off slow and then tapers off one third of the way through.<br />Lot's of boring dialogue and boring people and a seemingly aimless plot for<br />an ordinary murder.<br />Just didn't light me fire.im
B004EBT5CU|4.0|great voice, i bought this cd as a present for someone who really likes Adele however I enjoy listening to her at times.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I mean what do you expect right? The story is good, the romance so steamy I might burn up. Loved it.now the wait for the next book is on.
B008N2Z1L0|4.0|good sound and l actually ordered this and other wallflowers cds because I initially purchased the two Jakob Dylan Cds and really liked them.  I purchased the first 'women and country' because I was curious to hear what Jakob sounded like as I am a die hard Bob Dylan fan and I was pleasantly surprised as listening to Jakob made me smile just like listening to Bob improves my mood and makes me smile.
B00DBSZT7C|2.0|I somewhat enjoyed the action but I am glad it was a rental and not a purchase. It is not a keeper.
B006ZCWU5K|3.0|a little disappointed however still liked it.  I have a collection of bruce springsteen LPs and cds.  I enjoy listening to the Boss
B007MDB71O|5.0|I purchased JC not knowing what to expect, we watched the film more than a few time something that you cant do with many films.  We had had friends and family using the words Virginia and Tars Tarkas  for months.  I have recommended film to many friends who like myself didn't know what to make of the Disney trailer and 90% feel the same way,  this film was underrated and poorly marketed....
B000SL1RTY|1.0|I am not really rating the product.  I purchased this movie not realizing it was not in English.  The movie name and all of the stars names are listed on the front and of course they are in English, so I assumed I was buying a copy of the movie in English.  I know it is my fault, so I am just disappointed.  I didn't realize it was not in English until I had opened it a put it in a DVD player.  The lesson is to read closer when ordering!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is great! I love the minions, so when I saw this game for free, I had to try it. It is so fun and funny. Highly recommend it for anyone from kids to kids at heart.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|This game is a lot of fun.  Engaging and challenging.<br />Fun for all ages.  I especially like the period form of speaking the characters have.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This is a great game. When I played this on Atari  I always said it would be easier if I cud jus touch the screen lol
B000FC2L1E|5.0|This book just follows right into where it left off.  I love following Jamie and Claire's love story, and all the trials and victories they share.
B0074PNCRM|5.0|I chose 5 stars because this is a book that I couldn't put down I loved everything about it.  The characters were believable and I was right into their lives.  I am definitely going to read more books by John Green.  I would love to talk about this wonderful book more but I don't want to give anything away - I want readers to go into this book like I did with no knowledge except it had been recommended to me to read.<br /><br />Enjoy!
1620404869|5.0|This novel played into all my fantasies of living, and loving, Pride and Prejudice and all things Austen. Definitely a chic-lit novel, so it could have been written a little better, but it was very entertaining and a quick, enjoyable read.
B008602KQI|4.0|This is a very dark play that pits victors against vanquished in the aftermath of an uprising against the central authority by the residents in the hinterlands. It could be about the consequences of a failed rebellion against autocratic federalism in any civil war, but there is added the continued retribution by the victors that creates a modern version of a Roman gladiatorial games set in a high-tech arena of death that selects by a lottery the contestants from the descendants of the rebellious provincial inhabitants. From abject poverty and slavery at the hand of a formerly equal political and social class, a male and female teenager is selected from each former rebel district to battle to the death for the entertainment of the political elite as a punishment and lesson against further resistance. That the young hero and heroine both survive, in a contest where the rule for over seventy years has been that only one contestant emerges from the arena alive, is offset by the senseless death of so many others. The events simply cry out for a sequel to topple the political regime and eliminate the carnage before the next annual games.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Work perfectly and is great for homework , at home , banks, supermarket, school. My kids love it. Great,great ,great. Thanks.
B008XG1X18|5.0|love love love this site I am so inspired by all the ideas and dig hints to save money health and nutrition. I can go on and on
B005LJITS0|4.0|I don't know why this movie was trashed by so many but it was really good.<br />I liked the hero, the villain, the supporting characters, the fx, the story....it was good.<br />Don't get me wrong....it wasn't great but, it was worth watching.<br />It's not Shakespeare but seriously, watch it because you'll like it.
1936608898|5.0|I bought this book after someone at church told me about it.  It explains the science stuff quite well so that even I can understand it.  Also the encouragement they give throughout the book helped me to realize I could do this!  I'm on Day 18 and feeling so much better.  My husband already lost 10 pounds, I'm waiting till the end of the 30 days to weigh myself.  Thanks Whole30 for the life- changing book!
B008GWOVOA|4.0|a very interesting show with a somewhat sad ending...but a plausible exposition of an alien visit. visit visit visit visit
B005VPRET4|5.0|My granddaughter loves playing with it.  LEGO is always a favorite with kids and it keeps them entertained for hours.
1619693364|3.0|I just finished The Panther, and must say that reading the last third of the book was a chore I accomplished primarily because, by golly, I'd gone this far and I wanted to see how it came out. But I certainly could have done without the asides, the history, the geopolitics of Yemen and the surrounding areas, and other \\"stuff\\" that, as a writer, I've come to call \\"look how much research I've done.\\" Sometimes I felt like I could have skipped an entire chapter and not lost the sense of the story. Spare writing this isn't!<br /><br />Another irritating factor, which I either ignored or didn't turn up so frequently in previous DeMille books, is his tendency to insert attributions like \\"he explained\\" or \\"he informed us\\" or even \\"He changed the subject and said.\\" I found these to be a jarring interruption. Obviously, DeMille (or his editor) never read or doesn't believe Elmore Leonard's advice to use only \\"he said\\" for attributions.<br /><br />All that having been said, the plot was complex enough to keep me reading, and the information about that part of the world (at least the first several thousand words of it) was interesting. This one is good, but just barely.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|I really enjoyed it from the perspective of study.  He made the history come alive and filled in some blank spots.  It is clear he doesn't believe he was the Messiah.  But over all I enjoyed it almost as much as the media surrounding it.
B005HS00V4|4.0|I didn't think originally I would like the arrangements of these classic Peter Gabriel songs, but by the time he sang San Jacinto I became convinced I never truly heard these songs at their greatest potential. Wow.<br />turn up your sound system and listen!  Melanie still sings back-up, which to me no one can ever compare to Paula Cole at the 1994 Secret World Live concert.
B006DJ2JSI|4.0|Very easy to use app. Nice to have it loaded while playing word games. Doesn't always have all the words that the game allows however.
B00915G6MG|5.0|NCIS abbreviated for Naval Criminal Investigative Service is very addictive well made, well scripted television. Its tongue in cheek approach combined with its constant character development and plot twists make this series endearing. It combines terrorism, espionage, murder and many other activities into the spotlight of this elite investigation unit where the Navy and Marine Corps are affected.<br /><br />Mark Harmon as agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs, Michael Weatherly as agent Anthony \\"Tony\\" D. DiNozzo, Cote de Pablo as agent Ziva David, and David McCallum as Dr. Donald \\"Ducky\\" Mallard are brilliant, not to forget Sean Murray, Pauley Perrette or Rocky Carroll! But, it is Mark Harmon's restrained, honorable, poker faced agent Jethro Gibbs that is somehow the force that drives this show.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I was looking for a good mystery book for a summer read and this one met my expectations.  There was good character development and an interesting story line.  I did not like the fact that I figured out the &#34;killer&#34; before the end of the book.
B00640UICA|4.0|It's a good game to spend time playing when you are having a boring day, the sequences, the graphics, everything it's really cool...
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Great book. Heartfelt and emotional. Hard to put the book down. Gives you an insight to life in another country.
0064471837|5.0|About four years ago, I came across Sabriel when I researching speculative fiction series that may heal my post-Potter depression. While doing Google searches, since I hadn't discovered Goodreads yet, The Abhorsen Trilogy would frequently pop up as a top recommendation. Since reading Sabriel, which I soon followed with Lireal and Abhorsen, it's been one of the few series I've kept in my top tier YA fantasy/scifi category.<br /><br />So to put in a nutshell, Sabriel is set in a fantasy land where there are two neighboring countries. One is the land of Ancelstierre which is kind of the \\"new world\\" of the two; it's got engines, electricity, and other cultural aspects similar to the 20th century. To the north is the Old Kingdom and is separated from Ancelstierre by a heavily guarded border called The Wall. The Old Kingdom is a land where magic can be used and extremely dangerous dead spirits exist. These dead spirits are corpses that have been reanimated called Dead Hands and also powerful supernatural beings known as Free Magic. These dead beings are raised by \\"Necromancers\\" who can travel into the gates of death and create Dead Hands to do their bidding. The Abhorsen are a bloodline of Necromancers that fight against this by laying these beings back into death by using magical bells that each have their own unique power.<br /><br />It took me almost half the book bit until I fully understood the concept of the magic used in this fantasy land. The magic is referred to as Charter Magic and derives its powers through a network of magic channeled from \\"The Charter.\\" The Charter are a group of powerful objects that were created thousands of years ago; it consists of the Great Charter Stones, The Wall (the one that separates Ancelstierre from the Old Kingdom), and three bloodlines. These bloodlines are the royal family, the Abhorsen, and the Clayr (a large sisterhood of blondies that can see the future). The Charter is meant to maintain order on magic from reigning freeling. Charter Mages or members of these magical bloodlines cast Charter spells by summoning symbols called Charter Marks, and combining the different marks to achieve their desired affect.<br /><br />So Sabriel, our heroine in this novel, is attending school in Ancelstierre at the beginning of the novel. Her father Terciel, who resides in the Old Kingdom, is the current Abhorsen of their time. While at school, Sabriel receives an alarming message from her father in which he sends her his weapons which includes a sword and bells. Sabriel believes her father has been overcome by an incredibly powerful evil entity so immediately leaves for the Old Kingdom to rescue her father. When Sabriel reaches her father's house on a cliff, she finds a creature named Mogget. Mogget is a Free Magic construct who has been bound into a form of a white cat by a red Charter collar which forces him to serve the Abhorsen. Mogget joins Sabriel on her journey to the Old Kingdom to find her father and tells her that she is the new Abhorsen, though she refuses to believe it. The two are eventually joined by another companion who calls himself Touchstone. Sabriel and Mogget find Touchstone in an ancient burial ground where he was magically imprisoned as a ship's figurehead for the last 200 years. Touchstones history is a mystery to Sabriel at first but acts like nothing but her loyal servant. The three of them continue on a journey to find Sabriel's father and discover the greater evil at work.<br /><br />The novel was plush full of innovative magic, creepy dark monsters, wonderful characters, and lots of adventurous trials. The one thing that made this book was Sabriel's incredible bravery and heart. A lot of high fantasy series don't feature female leads, and the female characters that do make an appearance typically aren't very endearing. I think writers should take take a lesson or two from Mr. Nix on how to get into a girl's pysche. She's not written like a uber-tough superwoman or like an over emotional, unreasonable damsel. Instead she's written like an actual human being. She's got real emotions, uses logic, is fearful yet brave, and just down to earth. Mogget was definitely a favorite of mine in the book. He's is very much that smartass, talking cat character and we're never quite sure about him because of the dangerous, blood thirsty Free Magic that resides in him.<br /><br />I love how this book is still labeled a YA book but doesn't dumb itself down for the sake of the audience. It's got a nice, sweet romantic story within it between our heroine and Touchstone. A lot of popular YA novel are written purely for romance, but I like it better when the romance works with the story's plotline. Overall, the book is incredibly innovative and exciting. It had everything I was looking for in a post-Potter remedy. An original fantasy world, unique magic, young likeable protagonists, great characters, lovely relationships, and an exciting plot. My only complaint was it ended too fast. Ever since I got my Kindle, I can't really tell the length of books anymore but I felt like plowed through Sabriel too quickly, but that may just be because I couldn't put it down.er emotional, unreasonable damsel.

B006G4F8OW|5.0|this is my first figure its nice add to my collection the detail was good the box came intact stand workds well
B0083P1QUM|1.0|Too much drama between the the underlying relationships of the main characters. Plot and action were weak, as the reader's attention is too often forced to concern himself with Scarpetta's personal woes and not the woes of the case at hand.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Loved that it actually challenged me mentally and intellectually. Although I do wish that it were longer, I enjoyed the game play, puzzles, and storyline.
B001ILFUDC|4.0|This is just a remastering of the original Disney classic but it is great for anyone who is trying to build a collection of the originals or like me is trying to replace their original VHS tapes with a newer version of the movies.
B006CHML4I|5.0|classic, simple watch. works wonderfully. a super nice mechanical watch. who cares if it is off 10 seconds per day
B008602KQI|5.0|Loved Jennifer Lawrence's performance as Katniss. The movie is a must see for Hunger Games fans and even those that aren't!
B00ENFS0F0|5.0|Don't fret about the current listed price. As with the other TNG Blu-ray releases that came before, the price will come down to $60-$70 closer to release date. Always happens. And, uh, Season 5 is stellar.
B007THA4FI|3.0|Too many characters, some with two names, that are not fleshed out until too late to make this interesting.  I wouldn't recommend it as a must read.
B004WDRT1Y|5.0|So glad to snag this since it's \\"gone back in the vault.\\" Fulfillment was Fast and reasonable. My granddaughters are very happy!
B009YG2ND8|5.0|I love the Final Fantasy Series and this allows me to take one of the games with me wherever I go.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great characters, interesting time period, good set & fun to watch.  I don't know much about this time in England, so I'm learning a little while being entertained!
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|The director was thoroughly familiar with the source material and it showed in every line. The actors were spot-on and their performances were thoroughly competent and subtle. Not much real-world realism, but exceptional verisimilitude. Recommended in the highest possible terms.
B001H9JBW6|4.0|Typical solid British TV series, no surprises there. Interesting story about the intersection of overzealous elected officials trying to protect the people by eroding their freedoms. I liked it but was not Benedict Cumberbatch's best performance, or perhaps I've just seen too much of him and he doesn't wear well?
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I could not sleep until I find the clues....it's hard and easy both ways...makes u think. me and my 6 yr old enjoy it so much.  I wish they can have the other rooms ready.  We enjoy the double room so much

B0050PYNP8|5.0|Paul is an extremely funny movie about an alien that has been on earth since the Roswell incident in the 40s as such he is very human in many ways and it leads to a hilarious road trip with 2 huge sci-fi nerds.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|What a great book, there are several intertwining stories with interesting characters and situations.  FYI:  more than one husband/character has a secret!
B00BR0SGN0|4.0|It's really a gift that this group is still cranking out great music after so many years.  I am quite late to the DP party, only engaging in their classics in the last year or two.  With most of their core well north of 60, they effortlessly create a timeless rock and roll sound.  They certainly deserve much more credit then they're ever been given.  Now What?! is a great companion piece to their most timeless efforts and shows that geezers can rock.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I really love this game I think it is awesome and challenging. I would recommend this game to everyone everywhere
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|After a while, the game will not load and jump back to home screen. when this happens, all collected armors will be gone.
B0087ITBT8|4.0|Have you ever been in touch with a jewish mother???<br />If not, experience this adventure with Barbra Streisand<br />Dont stop laughing and enjoying the perfomances and chemical bond between mother and son
B009G78EE2|4.0|I like this album overall it has some really good music. Some of the songs are overplayed on the radio but I hardly ever listen to the radio anymore so it is ok. This works out so i can hear the ones I want when i want and not have to hear the same 3 over and over and over.
0312641893|4.0|This was fun. And I give it four stars for being such an awesome idea (Cinderella as a future cyborg!), having interesting characters, and a decent enough story pretty decently told. But what could have been a five star book, gets at least one star knocked off because it left me wanting more. Not in the sense of more story. That's obviously coming in future volumes and this one has an ending that is not gratuitously incomplete.<br /><br />No, I wanted more about Cinder as a cyborg. Why does society and her stepmother brand her as such an outcast? Where are the other cyborgs? Are they also outcasts? If this going to be a major issue for the main character, than it needs to be explored so I can understand it. Otherwise, it just seems thrown in as something the story needed.<br /><br />I also wanted more about this future where there are emperors, queens, princes and lost princesses. What social upheavals resulted in governments reverting to a form of monarcy? This seems counter to the evolution of society toward democracy, unless hindered by a tyrant. This element would have felt more natural if it involved some form of aristocracy that didn't involve actual monarchs.<br /><br />I also wanted to know more about the plague, and the lunars, and... Too much here just seems tossed in to give the story the impression of inhabiting a rich and varied world. But the world building left me unsatisfied.<br /><br />On the other hand. Good prose. Good characters. Fun story. I look forward to the next book.
B00CSCJ09K|5.0|David Garrett never fails to delight and this album is great.  So nice they finally released it in the US.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Watched with my wife and 2 teenage children.  Captivating, thought provoking; we're still talking about it 1 week after viewing.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Uplifting, positive, life changing and with a challenging message.  Bible believing, born-again Christian cast and crew. Especially suited for men and boys.
B009FB3W9G|4.0|Great songs sung by different voices and artist in a well deserved tribute to Barbra Streisand...<br />to watch over and over again
B00DUIBZSK|3.0|I bought the albums by Selena for my niece who really likes her music but by me buying them we could give her the music and keep away any of the songs that we thought were inappropriate for her age.
B00364K6YW|5.0|We enjoy this movie, except a scene where the young sister is living with her boyfriend.It is presented as immorality, but I wish we didn't see it. Fast forward through that and it's a good movie!
1592536913|5.0|Amazing photography of some awesomely unique steam punk items. Looking forward to attempting to create my own gadgets as inspired by this book.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is so much better then the original. it has alot more and it looks a lot cooler then the first temple run. The coolest part is the touch abilities where you can use them when the meter is full and you really need it. My favorite on is the boast it speeds you pass the I think it is 250 meters but, I'm not sure. It is a great time killer you just can't put it down no matter how hard you try it's always just one more game a hour later I'm still playing it.
B001GSTOAM|4.0|I really wish this was in an Audio Book format on Audible. Not the most ideal book because of all the lines of code, though the topics covered in the book I'd still enjoy.
B0033AI4PM|5.0|Love the way the movie is remasterized and the quality of the sound and songs<br />Love the performance of all the actors and specially Barbra<br />I enjoy the movie every time i see it
B004XWLN20|4.0|This is a great collection of all the Smallville series. If you were a fan of the show then you should get this it saves you a ton of money if you don't already own any of it but I recommend buying it when there is a deal of the day for it cause you will save even more.
B002UZCJ8Y|4.0|Good Bruce Willis film,Sci-Fi, the future and still shooting them. Has all the elements that make Bruce Bruce and the story line isn't bad either.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|So clever and so much fun.  This should go down as a classic comedy movie although I doubt it will.  Those days of glory for movies are gone forever.  It's now...what's next...forget what we just had
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I love cut the rope and this verson is great because it is going though time and their are new ways to try to get the candy it is a great time killer too.
B009EE4YWI|5.0|Read the book. They left out something's I would not have but over all a great movie. I woul definitely recommend it!
B00821OX98|4.0|The show is pretty good.  A little different take on these types programs. If you like these types of shows or like things like the Walking Dead you will probably enjoy.
B008YU0AOE|3.0|What is there to say about this app that is not said in the description. Nothing. It is a calculator.
B007K3JFUQ|4.0|Downey & Law make an excellent quirky pair. This is a new kind of Sherlock but I like it. Been a Holmes fan since Basil played him. These two are much more entertaining and real. I hope they make another Holmes movie.
B009AY04A8|4.0|Great game. Maybe too easy though. I am definitely hooked. Graphics are ok not great but great story line. Glad there is an option to skip dialogue
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Totally love it! It's so easy to use and I recommended it to my 68 year old mom. Great product!
B00BWJARHO|2.0|After the Lord of the Rings Trilogy I was expecting a great epic. Instead, it was disjointed and insipid at best
B000FC11A6|5.0|An amazing and massive story of code-breaking during WWII and establishing a data haven in the present. Great characters, an intricate plot, and the most hilarious and ironic narrative voice ever, this was a definitive work for the erudite, info-dump loving Stephenson. There are so many self-indulgent tangents on esoteric lines of geek trivia, but this is an integral part of the author's voice. Though one would think a 910 page story would drag, I found myself increasingly drawn by the interweaving stories, and was sad when it came to an end. A wild and unique story unlike any other!
B005LAII4E|4.0|Great G.I. Joe movie. Though it does have some things that any die hard Joe fan will be upset about if they have never seen the film. I really enjoyed the movie but if I was basing it on following the originals or sticking with the original story I must say I was disappointed.
B00DHNJCKQ|4.0|I enjoyed this movie more than I expected I would. Not their best work as actors but still a good movie.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Hard to say its a &#34;good story&#34; since its really about something pretty horrific; but, it is presented in a fashion that makes it difficult to put down.  Lots of insight and feels very authentic.  One of the best non-fiction books i've read in a while.
B004ZY0VHY|4.0|What a disturbing story about unlikeable characters thinking and doing unspeakable thoughts and deeds and yet I couldn't put it down. This tale is brilliantly told.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great season,  a must  watch after the first season...  watched the whole series in two night's Woolworth suffering the lack sleep.
B004K8WPUQ|5.0|I gave the product five starts because it works surprisingly well with DSLR's. However, when we compare it to other professional shotgun microphones, this one is decent. Many professional videographers use it because it is small, lightweight, and has great sound quality! Its noise reduction feature works very well. DSLR's normally have poor audio wiring inside. So when you purchase a mic like the NTG-2 or a high-end one like the NTG-8 along with an XLR to 3.5mm adapter, you get a lot of whitenoise. This mic is prepared for the poor wiring and uses a system that puts out the mono signal to both channels, making it stereo and getting rid of most whitenoise. To even further eliminate noise, you put the settings on High Pass Filter and +20dB. Then you go into your camera's audio settings and manually adjust the volume level to about 20-40%. (with a Canon T3i, that's 4 clicks up from the bottom). Be sure to purchase a wind muff, although there aren't many out there that will work too well, it will at least help. BE GENTLE WITH IT. I'm already having issues with mine. The area just above the hot shoe and just below the actual mount came loose and is getting dangerously close to breaking. To fix the problem, I have to use a boom pole. The battery is difficult to get in because of the stubborn lid. Luckily, if anything breaks, Rode offers a ten year warranty, so they've got you covered. One other small thing that bugged me is that the base doesn't pivot, so it's pretty annoying to get the right setup with a boom pole. To sum it all up, great mic for the price and task, buy a wind muff, High Pass and +20dB, 20-40% camera volume, BE GENTLE, doesn't pivot. Hope I helped and I hope that if this is the mic you choose, it will serve you well.

B009FZHYKU|4.0|This season was my least favorite so far, but I still enjoyed it very much. If only Andrea had died in a much worse manner. I hated her from the beginning.
B00006V9A0|5.0|The best collection of Nirvana hits--just the ones that I know and like so it was perfect for me.  Great CD.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I really liked the story about the strange pictures of the unusual children and what they meant. I felt the ending didn't do it justice.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|What the hell were you thinking? It was great before! Now it is hard read &amp; doesn't give as much info. CHANGE IT BACK!
B002JI94J4|5.0|The remastering of the Beatles classic is fantastic. The picture is so clear and the music, well, that is, and will always be, fantastic!<br /><br />JEJ
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|This is an ok app but don't expect all the &#34;features&#34; unless you pay for the app I just wanted something simple to put on my kindle to wake me up because the power had gone out and I needed something to get me to work on time the next morning.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|As a mom, school social worker and former teacher, cannot say enough about this book.  I read this to my son every night and we bond over this book.  We have character discussions and he gets so much out of it.  This is the first chapter book he has ever enjoyed.  Going to be sad when we are done.  Want more from this author!!!
B008D30K7E|4.0|Dealing with the main character's present and his past, it is a rollercoaster of the bizarre. If you don't have a smile after reading this book, then &#34;climb out the window and disappear&#34;.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This is a great story cleverly woven with the meaning behind classic flowers and what they symbolize when given away.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun easy game. Slow to earn levels but great simple fun. Good details and great natural looking horses. Very family friendly game. Great fun for the horse obcessed girls.
B00E5Q1HJS|4.0|The Into the Darkness was entertaining but predictable.  The CGI and actions sequences (99% of the movie) were done very well.
B004LWZW7O|5.0|This is a great movie about a possible dystopian future where we have gone from using actual currency to using time as our money. You also see how this could become a real problem which is when the movie gets interesting.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|The device seems to have some communication issues while streaming from YouTube, hopefully fixed somehow through an update. Streaming movies from a Chrome browser works well though. Very recommended.
B008LV8TSU|5.0|Howl's Moving Castle is one of my favorite movies and now it is one of my favorite books! Love it!
B000YABS8E|5.0|If you want a truly insightful, passionate, and bittersweet comedy -- you've got to see this.<br /><br />Its about a boy raised his ENTIRE LIFE in a fallout shelter by his parents. Underground, he reaches age 33 knowing only his 1960 parents, and no one else. Finally, he comes to the surface to discover today's world. And wow, has it changed!<br /><br />The &#34;boy&#34; is played by Brendan Fraser. He is a nerdy, geeky man-child. Yet at the same time, he is UTTERLY more intelligent, refined, compassionate, and cultured than anyone our modern society has manufactured. When he asks a store owner, &#34;Please stop using the Lord's name in vain&#34;, the large owner replies, &#34;You got a problem with that?&#34; Fraser courageously stares up at him and replies, &#34;Yeah, I've got a BIG problem with that!&#34;<br /><br />What? What the hell? A man who cares about profanity? A person who compliments you by calling you a &#34;gentleman&#34;? A guy who can dance because his mother has given him lessons every day for the past 33 years?<br /><br />So yes, its bittersweet because it really illustrates how far we've come -- or declined -- in a short time. But its full of laughs, and amazing cultural observations. But best of all is this movie's retro-hero. I think its Fraser's best movie. Even better than The Mummy!
B0089LOG02|4.0|An account of the treatment of orphans in our country's history, and a comment on the foster parent programs of today.
0062255657|3.0|Though very well written, I am afraid The Ocean at the End of the Lane did not entice me the way other Gaiman books have in the past.  The plot involves a young boy who, after the death of his family's tenant, meets a family of women at the end of a lane.  Before long, he discovers that these women are more than they seem, and when they suspect an evil entity has entered the world, the youngest, Lettie, seeks to contain the unwanted presence.  Unfortunately, the creature is more resourceful than the eleven-year-old Lettie suspected, and our narrator, the boy, suffers for her misstep.<br /><br />Though I would rate this amongst Gaiman's best in terms of prose, the story itself failed to deliver any real emotional impact.  The protagonists were likable, but I would not necessarily describe them as charismatic.  The villain of the story, while in human form, proved the most interesting, but that was all too brief a portion of the book.  While not in human form, she was difficult to process.<br /><br />Gaiman wrote an entertaining tale, but I must wonder if the first-person narration hindered the overall story to a degree.  We only got our information from the narrator's perspective, and because he did not truly understand what unfolded before his eyes, we received only a portion of the happenings.  Because of the fantasy aspect of this book, I believe a different perspective may have freed the more magical elements for the reader to enjoy.  After all, Gaiman is amid the best at making fantasy feel real.<br /><br />I understand that Gaiman wanted to explore the disconnect between the child's world and the adult's, but the story should not suffer as a result.  In the end, we have far more questions than answers, and while that is not always a bad thing, in this case, it weakened the book.  The Ocean at the End of the Lane is, from a craft standpoint, a beautifully written story, but in terms of an engaging read, it lacked the charm of previous Gaiman works.<br /><br />~Scott William Foley, author of Andropiacott William Foley, author of Andropia

0761172726|5.0|Great calendar since each person has their own column. You need to use abbreviations for the activity if you feel there is not enough room to write as some have noted. But I can get 3 activities written in for each person if needed.  If doing more than 3 things per day - may need to slow it down! I buy it every year.
1423140605|3.0|I was hooked on this series when I got this book.  However for whatever reason, I stopped reading it half way through and have read several other books in the 6 or so months since I put this one down.  For some reason I just got bored, it didn't hold my attention like the earlier books in this series and the Lightening Thief Series alike.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I really love the unrushed movement of the story presentation.  The care taken with the historical detail is greatly appreciated.
B00A8FXT8M|5.0|Beautifully written...a gentle pace that manages to keep you suspended and engaged, absorbing every nuance and bonding with the main characters resilience, passion and quiet determination. We've all stumbled across the characters and struggles in different shapes and forms in our own lives...
1885167776|1.0|I've been awfully disgusted by the auhtor's brazen attempt to rehash some self-help classics, such as Brian Tracy's fabulous \\"Focal Point\\", or Leo Babauta's \\"The Power of Less\\".  \\"80/20 rule\\", \\"importance of focusing\\", \\"limiting yourself to the essential\\", and \\"extraordinary result out of simple truth(=focusing)\\", etc.  What's not in the Tracy's great book that IS in this poorest rip-off?  Just name it!
B009VLX8FS|4.0|If you like Taylor swifts music then go ahead and buy this it is  good collection of her new work.
B001O03NCW|5.0|Excellent Apalation folk  music from a very fun movie. Ghostly harmonies, great clean acoustic guitar and a generally happy vibe.
B00DAXYNEI|5.0|One of the best shows I've seen as of late.  The acting is superb.  Watch one episode and you will be hooked!
B0029LCJJS|4.0|I liked the historical perspective.  I found the attempt to titillate with the sexual presentation very unnecessary and really annoying.
B00D23GXB2|4.0|I was gifted this short book to review not really knowing what to expect, it was erotic peotry, never been interested normally fifty shades has never tickled my fancy but this, wow i was enthralled and it was quite, quite naughty at points which isn't a bad thing.<br />This has opened my views in more ways than one, that I have read something like this and enjoyed it and also never vividly pictured sex scenes like i did in this book it has the right mix of descriptions comedy at some points make this an exciting read indeed. Give it a try you might be surprised, I pleasantly was.

1878424319|5.0|I think everyone needs to read this book.  I ordered one book for myself and since have order 5 more and given 4 of them to family and a friend to pass amongst any one they choose. Actually for me this book has been a blessing and exactly what I needed at this time in my life. I lost my husband a year ago and had such a hard time with regrets and grief and this book has helped beyond measure. I actually wish I had read it many, many years ago. I think my life would have been different and a lot happier.
0399255370|5.0|This book is very cute and I love the illustrations.  But, I saw this from a manager's point of view.  Each employee is like a different crayon and each employee has complaints or issues.  But if you take the time to listen to each one and use them a little differently than they've been used in the past, you can make everyone happier!  I laughed while reading this book and have already told several others about it.  Must have!!
