B00AQ71FLK|4.0|I loved the game exectp when it would not let me play because it said I had to much data
0920236162|5.0|This book has such a great message for girls of all ages. It teaches girls that everyone is beautiful and they should not care what others think. It also teaches girls that they do not need a \\"prince\\" in order to be a \\"princess.\\" It also contains some comedic relief when the princess calls the prince a bum because he said that he did not like the way she was dressed after she had saved him from being eaten. I would recommend this book as a must read. All children deserve to feel good about themselves no matter what they wear or where they come from.
B006N0YWGY|4.0|Nice combination of driving skills and logic. I'd like to see the final score less affected by luck, and more by skill, but it is very enjoyable as it is.
0399226907|5.0|This is a really good book. I have been reading this book since I was a little girl and as a soon to be teacher and a part time nanny I love reading it to kids now. This book has so many different applications. You can use this book to teach counting, days of the week, and how a caterpillar turns into a butterfly. This book is timeless and well written!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is very useful especially when I am on the go.  very good to have when you are not near a calculator
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Witty with nice mix of action and jokes. Can't wait to see the new one in a couple weeks in the theaters.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This is a very good game, it plays smoothly and graphics r great! I highly recommend for kids n adults for something to do in your free time.
B00881VLCE|5.0|This is honestly my favorite app! I love puzzles but don't like having to take up our table for weeks at a time. Best of both worlds with this app... beautiful puzzles, challenging and doesn't take up any table space! And now that they have fixed it to where all of the puzzles that I have paid for that disappeared are/can be reinstated. I am a forever fan and purchased more puzzles today!
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|I'm Not A Huge Mahjong Player, But This Is Fun To Play. I Found A Bug, But Considering How My Phone Had Been Acting Lately, I'm Not Convinced It's The App. It Works Better Than Swype Does With This Review Text Box! Not Sure Why My Phone Thinks It Needs To Capitalize The First Letter Of Every Word...
B00479SVBU|1.0|For my application. I could not get a clear sound on my radio at all no matter what.Don't buy it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is great anywhere,family game or adult game.it's really intertaning and fun.Also you only get a minimum of keys,but it's awesome.
B000FA5STS|5.0|Once you open this book up you will not put it down, there are so many twist and turns in it that you just want to find out what is going to happens next. I love David's books.
B00AVFO41K|1.0|they provided NO instruction or explanations, it was very confusing.  I just gave up because I could not figure out how to make the rows pop. Sometimes they would pop if I had 4 in a row, but other times???!!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Heart-wrenching but wonderful, according to my 13 year old daughter. She couldn't put it down and it made her cry.
B00AREIAI8|1.0|This is a great game with amazing animals and palaces to go. It is great for ages 6 to 60. NOT FOR THE ORDERLY, there is just to much excitement!!!!. I highly unrecommended this game for anyone who loves squirrels that jump over things.... that's all about it. Hope this really didn't help you! ;)
B008AIGWVA|2.0|As an adult, I don't really like the program.  Also, my Kindle Fire doesn't have a microphone for talking to the dog.  So, it wasn't really a good fit for me.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I really like this game! It's a combination of temple run and subway surfers. I always like those games and I like despicable me so I really enjoyed it
B00005YUNY|4.0|One of the better LIVE Yes concerts and has a great selection of songs(minus some of the newer ones). Skip Jon Anderson's inept introductions before the songs(yes, we forgive him). Unfortunate that Rick Wakeman was absent and some younger Studio keyboard player replaced him and barely covered the basics. The Orchestra was a nice added touch-although the mix was not so good and they were barely heard. The production values are excellent-perfect Video and Dolby surround audio make this a winner for any YES fan. Especially Gates of Delirium from Relayer is a real Gem and rarely seen in concert. There are some extra video effects which can be turned off and are unnecessary. Compared this to the terrible 'Keys to Ascension' Dvd, with sub VHS quality video and horrific adolescent video effects which completely distract from the music, you can't really complain. Altogether, this show is a splendid time for all!
B00CH26TL8|5.0|This game was fun to me. I really liked it. I enjoy these games and would recommend them to people. Thought at first it is easy but then it gets harder
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|I was really surprised by this movie.  Having not read the books, I was not sure what to expect.  Loved Jennifer Lawrence in this and now understand the buzz around this movie and her performance.  Good experience.
B008YKGQR4|5.0|works great. I can do everything from my tablet!  you can enlarge the view, change your profile pic, even create a page!
B00B5AP7NY|5.0|This was a gift for my grandson.  He absolutely loves it! Product arrived in excellent condition and shipping was fast. I am very pleased with this purchase
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|great app that is fun to play. hard at first but you get better the more you play. love playing it!
B002ZG9940|5.0|I can understand the disappointment of the people who watched this film thinking it was just another common-place, noisy popcorn action movie. Well, it's not. It's a dramatic masterpiece that requieres calm and tranquility to be fully appreciated; one that does not hide its heartfelt hommage to Sergio Leone and \\"lonely guy\\" dark westerns of the past. Very slow pace, very beautiful shots, not so much dialogue, so that it builds slowly through sheer ambiance, an amazing color palette, very subtle noises and sensations...and terrific actors. Clooney's dark side is simply breathtaking, not obvious at all. Detailed but not evident storytelling, exquisite compositions, careful editing, all is in the line of some masterpieces of the 70's. It shows how tension does not requiere of the million-times seen repetitive, shaky camera work, but that it can be built through simple, serene but dark beauty, and real sense of film-making. Sorry, folks, the action is mostly inner!! The image and sound of the blu-ray are flawless, by the way, so one can be completely submerged into this rare masterpiece.
0425263924|5.0|was only disappointed there was no info on the next book, but I am looking forward to reading it when it comes out
B00BHU2A7I|3.0|slow moving...repetitious<br />not the love story I expected<br />nothing really revealing<br />would not recommend it to anyone who like action
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great game to play and I really enjoy it. If you are looking for a good game about horses this is it.
B00D1DBO1C|5.0|I ordered this item to help me with my computer and tablet. It has met all my expectations and I hope to do business with this seller again.
B005WTR4ZI|5.0|The analysis on how automatization has gradually change and still changing the labour market by reducing absolute number of job and finally creating unemployment. My view of the becoming result of this development is much more grim than the writers'. The book is very good. What is missing from the picture is the fast development of cognitive computing ( see. IBM Almaden lab SyNAPSE -project). These new &#34;brain machines&#34; will eventually explode this.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This remarkable book demonstrates the power of love, of hope, and the remarkable universality of sibling love, whether in times of peace or of war. It doesn't shrink form describing the dichotomy between blinding poverty and great wealth. Although set in Afghanistan, beginning in the 1950's, the power of the book is its demonstration of the indomitable nature of the human spirit.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love the instantaneous interactive map, and extended temperature forecast out for a couple of weeks.  I can plan on when to open windows and mow the lawn.
B00CA4S27W|5.0|I've been a fan of Ritchie Blackmore's impeccable musicianship since the Mach 1 Deep Purple pre Gillan & Glover lineup. This latest effort by the merry minstrels has more of Ritchie's fiery electric guitar work featured than previous releases by Blackmore's Night. There are still some beautiful acoustic instrumentals & songs in the medieval vein & Candace's voice is both sweet & powerful as the music dictates. I, Baron of Greymatter tip my hat to Blackmore's touching tribute &#34;Carry On Jon&#34; to his old band mate which closes this album. The organist does a good job of conveying Jon Lord's idiosyncratic style & if you're a Deep Purple fan from way back you just may get a bit misty eyed. There has indeed been a &#34;fire in the sky&#34; since his passing a year ago!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I'm looking forward to more levels.  It is a good memory puzzle game, just easy enough to keep one entertained.
B00C7JG0KG|5.0|great movie and the special effects were over the rainbow. This will become a yearly watch especially at Halloween night
0425263991|5.0|Outstanding addition to a great series. Kaleb is such a multi-dimensional charcter, beautifully written. Great to see Vaughan, Faith and Mercy is co-starring roles. I highly recommend this book.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Best show on TV hands down!! Been waiting for a show that captures my attention and this certainly does. Can't wait for season 4!
B001NLL93W|4.0|Book seems like a good end to the series makes me a little worried on how the rest of the series will be. Besides that I have enjoyed this book the most so far in the series.
B007R108WA|3.0|This is not the 2002 film &#34;Perfume&#34; that centers on the fashion industry but rather the 2006 film adaptation of &#34;Perfume: The Story of a Murderer.&#34; This was a 1985 literary novel by German writer Patrick S&uuml;skind. The film is directed by Tom Twyker and is a visually graphic depiction of the development of the serial killer he calls Jean-Baptiste Grenouille. The story begins in a fish market in France in 1738 with his birth in the most wretched circumstances imaginable and follows his life in a rather documentary-style narrative that is dispassionate and adds to the grotesqueness of the plot.<br /><br />This is not your &#34;feel-good&#34; movie, nor is it one with an anti-hero you feel sympathetic toward. The filming is stunning. Actually the whole movie rather stuns more than entertains one. I cannot say I love it or like it but it is disturbing and thought-provoking. It is not something to watch in a depressed state of mind I think and even the exquisite photography does not make me want to return to it. Alan Rickman as the father of a victim of the serial killer is powerful. John Hurt is the narrator and his  marvelous voice carried me along through this &#34;tunnel of horrors&#34; movie. I recognize the power of the production and story but can't view it in terms of &#34;liking.&#34;
B00CLD65X0|5.0|As always amazing... sad turns , but delish story lines..love all these actors and characters highly recommonded ..beautiful scenery as they travel. . LOVE LOVE LOVE
B002W7H3EA|5.0|[Thornhill is wearing sunglasses to hide his identity]<br />Ticket Seller: Something wrong with your eyes?<br />Roger Thornhill: Yes, they're sensitive to questions.<br /><br />Cary Grant plays Roger Thornhill, a glib advertising executive who becomes involved in a dangerous game of mistaken identity. Eva Marie Saint is the perfect Ice Queen. The dialog sparkles and the plot is rich and twisted. Produced in 1959, this is a beautiful example of Hitchcock's best, a the balanced mystery- suspense- humor concoction. There are shots and scenes which are so classic they will remain with you long after you view it. And probably bring you back for repeated showings. The supporting cast is a great collection of character performers too.<br />A personal preference: I like viewing this one with Stanley Donen's 1963 film \\"Charade\\" (starring Cary Grant, Audrey Hepburn, Walter Matthau.) This is the best Hitchcock style film never made by Hitchcock but Donen's homage. It features another fine assortment of supporting players. The two films work well in tandem.
B009B8YZKS|5.0|Halo fans have long wanted Live adaptations of our favorite video game and Master Chief. This web series turned movie is extremely well done. I think it was even done in partnership with 343 industries and Bungie co founder Frank O'Conner, who strives to keep all the Halo games, books and other licensed media in line with the canon of Halo. This is also a great prequel to Halo 4. Looking forward to see what happens with the Halo TV series announced at E3 with Stephen Spilberg...
B00BQ1DAHC|4.0|I prefer the previous two albums over this one, but it is still pretty good.  There is a country twinge to several of the song.  I do not like country music, but the country twinge isn't so bad.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I love Mr. Hosseini's writing but this book was full of confusion for me. The jumping from story to story and trying to figure out who was who and what time made the book less enjoyable for me. I have loved his previous two books, this one, not so much. Perhaps I was the only one confused. I recommend the book, but make sure you stay focused.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game was awesome because it makes you think.And it is kind of a eye spy game.So I love this App.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|This was a very realistic story of life in Afghanistan, with highs and lows. It provided a nice history of all of the struggles Afghanistan has faced over the past decades.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Excellent! Good graphics and the plot really grabs you I couldn't put my kindle down while watching. The director is a genius there is so much going on you have to rematch episodes sometimes to fully make connections.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|easy for kids or adults. was a really great game. just needs lots more rooms can't wait for more to come.
B00BMR5HOO|5.0|As weather apps go this is by far the best one I have been fortunate enough to come across. I believe I may purchase it just to let the developer know I appreciate the hard work, and to get rid of the ads.
B004EPYZSK|5.0|Daniel Craig was great thruout the movie .<br />Wow is Harrisson getting old! But boy he's still got it! Both were outstanding in this unbelievable sci-fi.<br />Great addition to my collection
B009A3NGF4|5.0|Once more, Mumford and Sons thoroughly impresses me. I first heard &#34;I Will Wait&#34; and &#34;Babel&#34; and was impressed, but figured that the title track and first single would, of course, be the best songs on the album. Well, the rest of the album hold right up there with those two. Now I can't stop listening to it.
B005LAII94|4.0|Some role for Taylor to play......but he get it right on the money playing his character to the hilt.<br /><br />this is filed supposedly in Mexico, & Calf. .......this is a film that can be pretty gruesome with all the killing but they all are killing each other that's pretty real in this day so , is it realistic? Only those that are in the business really know?
B009I2UH2W|5.0|This phone charger does one job, charge my phone. It does it well, and does nothing else. It has a nice elegant subtly blue glow to indicate that it is plugged in.
B0060AY85C|4.0|I'm obsessed with Morrison's work, so I generally enjoy everything she writes. This is not her best work, although it is as beautifully written as any of the others.
B00BB22GQM|5.0|Don't get me wrong, I like this album, BUT it seems that the expanding of Vampire Weekends musical style on this most recent of albums came at the expense of the fun themes that we all loved from their first two albums.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I adored Hosseini's other books, The Kite Runner and a Thousand Splendid Sons. This one is good but a bit confusing until almost the end. The characters are all connected but you don't see how quite soon enough for it to make complete sense. The writing and the narration is great though and it keeps you interested despite the somewhat difficult to ascertain overall &#34;plot.&#34;
B00C7JG0KG|4.0|Enjoyable 3D experience.  Decent story.  The cast is excellent with the exception of James Franco as the title character.  He just seems a bit 'off ' for the lack of a better term.  Still an OK job overall, but unlike the other characters, I could not see him developing<br />into the characters we all know they become.
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|I adore this movie. It is a unique and true story about a special man that helps Jews during the Holocaust. It is extremely well acted, well directed, and indeed very sad. I've watched it numerous times and it is one of my all time favorite films.
B00D8JM8FK|5.0|They found a way to take a funny story and make it into two equally yet separate adventures! Not to mention... IT'S WHOOPI!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Grateful for Dr. Alexander to share his voyages to the Om and the higher dimensions. It surely confirms my existing knowledge on the subject and extends with better details. Although this type of experience is often difficult to put in earthly terms, Dr. Alexander did a great job in articulating it to the extent that's both inspiring and tangible. I enjoyed reading this book a lot and highly recommend it. (Some parts of the book get abut too personal which I tend to skip)
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I watched all the seasons of these books already, so decided to start reading the books. As much as I love the HBO series, if its possible the books are even better! The bundle pack helps save some money on buying each individually.
B00BNGFGIQ|2.0|I got this when it was free on the Free App Of The Day and I haven't been able to play it yet. Every time I try to open it on ky Droid Incredible 2 it just says &quot;Chimpact can't open.&quot; And then it does a force close.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I just found out about it and I Love it if you get I know you will love it too
1451695195|3.0|this is a good book and I enjoyed reading it, however I wanted more examples of what Dr Alexander heard from patients he has taken care of and experienced this similar phenomenon.  I will continue to read more on this subject to get a really good grasp on some common themes with this.
0393089134|4.0|As everyone knows by now, when the novel first appeared in 1962, the American edition (published by Norton) differed from the UK edition (published by Heinemann) because it lacked the final chapter, in which \\"Alex like groweth up, oh yes.\\" Stanley Kubrick based his 1971 film on the American text. Norton restored the final chapter in 1987, bringing the American and UK editions into line with one another. Now Andrew Biswell offers a slightly revised text based upon the annotated typescript Burgess sold to McMaster University (Hamilton, Ontario) in 1967. This text, subtitled \\"The Restored Edition,\\" has once again been published by Heinemann in the UK and by Norton in the USA--and once again the American and UK publications are far from identical.<br /><br />Some things of course are the same: most of Biswell's introduction, the text of the novel itself, the notes, and the annotated pages from Burgess's typescript, plus the \\"epilogue,\\" an additional piece by Burgess entitled \\"A Malenky Govoreet about the Molodoy.\\" But otherwise each version offers a very different package of extras. The Norton edition includes another piece by Burgess, entitled \\"The Clockwork Condition,\\" which the Heinemann version lacks. Conversely, the Heinemann version includes Burgess's prologue to his own 1986 stage adaptation of the novel, together with a Nadsat glossary, both missing from the Norton version. The Heinemann version also contains a foreword by Martin Amis and a set of essays, articles, and reviews excluded from the Norton version. About half of these additional pieces are by Burgess himself; the others are by Kingsley Amis, Malcolm Bradbury, Christopher Ricks, A. S. Byatt, and Stanley Edgar Hyman.<br /><br />Probably the main reason the Heinemann text offers more is that Norton published its own \\"critical edition\\" of the novel back in 2011, which contains a large selection of background/contextual materials and critical commentary. Two of these pieces are included in the Heinemann text: Burgess's \\"Clockwork Marmelade\\" (awkwardly retitled \\"'Review' of Stanley Kubrick's Film\\" by Norton) and \\"Horror Show,\\" Ricks's comparison of the novel and film. It is unfortunate that the Norton version of \\"The Restored Text\\" lacks Burgess's prologue, included in the Heinemann version. It is also unfortunate that the Heinemann version lacks \\"The Clockwork Condition,\\" included in the Norton version. These selections, hitherto unpublished and perhaps the most remarkable of the extras, appear to be unavailable elsewhere. If you want both, you have to buy both the Heinemann and the Norton editions. Doubtless this was a calculated manoeuver on the part of the two publishers.<br /><br />As for \\"The Restored Text\\" itself, some of the changes are interesting, but none is really substantive, and all of them seem to reflect Biswell's own preferences, not Burgess's. The only complaint Burgess ever had about the published text of the novel was Norton's choice to lop off the final chapter and to append a glossary; any other editorial changes were either made by Burgess himself or approved by him. While the facsimiles of selected typescript pages are a welcome treat, their chief interest lies in the marginal doodlings of clockwork oranges and the like, not in any textual emendations. In any case, the most significant annotation to the typescript was the comment at the end of part 3, chapter 6: \\"Should we end here? An optional 'epilogue' follows.\\" As Biswell notes in his introduction, \\"it is clear from the 1961 typescript that Burgess's intentions about the ending of his novel were ambiguous from the start.\\" But we don't need a whole \\"restored text\\" to tell us that, and the typescript page containing this marginal note has not been reproduced.
B00BGIBVP8|5.0|An unexpected gem! I expected a sitcom type plot-- but rented for Albert Brooks and light comic fare. Being child-free & never married, I doubted I'd relate to much, but Apatow writes for the human condition, warts and all, in this very fresh, funny and endearing script with outstanding performances. I'm a tough critic, but this film brightened my week--one of the most enjoyable I've seen in a long while.
B002ZTQVBQ|5.0|Mainly bought it for him, although I love Miyazaki films.  It's a very sweet movie about a goldfish that wants to turn into a real girl and the havoc it causes.  It's still not my favorite Myiazaki film, but we all like to watch it.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Good movie, Jennifer lawrence did a fantastic job.  The story was paced well, and I really got into it.  Good flick
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|passionate, inventive, imaginative . . .really great series . . . not sure about the plans fir it but hope it will continue for another year
B00AFROVQC|2.0|This book reads like a poorly written made for tv movie. Character development is largely shallow, one dimensional, and stereotypical.This does not improve in Book 2. Story is ok if often predictable. Really for young readers.
B005LAIIKI|4.0|This is a uncut copy of the movie shown in theaters in my area.  I hope to replay this movie many times.

1932100660|5.0|Excellent read. I had been a vegetarian for 30 years before picking up this book. It gave me the extra nudge to go vegan - not based on spiritual principles or beliefs, but on health considerations. (A benefit of it not being a spiritual 'vow' for me is that, if I want cream on my dessert, that's OK by me! The China Study 'allows' up to 10% of your calories to come from animal products. If 1% of mine do, I'd be surprised.) The data presented are very thorough and convincing, though, as always with a topic that challenges vested interests' revenue streams, you can find 'Bad Science' reviews of The China Study. I've recommended this book to many people. A few have taken it seriously and appreciated the results.
B0063IH60K|4.0|game froze after three months of operation.  unable to reinstall.  while working a very enjoyable experience.  will continuue to attempt to find a similar game.

B00003CXSM|5.0|It isn't my favorite but I do enjoy watching it from time to time. It is great for a little pick me up movie.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This book was so good in so many ways. I love the way it was told with little paused moments where the main character is talking directly to the reader. Everything flowed so smoothly you felt like you there with him the whole time. I found myself laughing out loud often and thoroughly enjoying the male perspective. I recommend this book to everyone.

1840225564|5.0|It contains the best work of Jane Austin. I have had so many friends and family borrow this book from me. My only problem is the book is so big and bulky that it is hard for me to carry it around every where and read it. But it looks lovely in my bookshelf.

B00DU74U74|5.0|Having thoroughly enjoyed the Twilight Saga in its entirety both the books and the movies, I read the book &#34;The Host&#34;, as well, enjoying that, and then went on to the movie.  Although distinctly different in parts from the book, I still loved the movie, and the differences it presented.  I suspect that those who enjoyed the Twilight Saga would enjoy this, as well.
0316187216|2.0|This repackaged western novel just didn't grab me.  Perhaps it's the poor pacing or the author's now-to-be-expected morality gimmick, I just couldn't get past half way of this book before tossing it aside.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|The game itself is pretty fun, but too many challenges involve linking to Facebook and playing with friends. If you are not interested in linking to FB or don't have an account, you reach a quick stopping point. Too bad. I've already deleted.

B00C7KYXHW|5.0|I can't get enough of Hannibal. It's been a long time since I liked any show on network tv. I almost pasted on watching this show because it was on NBC and I figured it would be canceled. But I took a chance and was mesmerized. This is such a great show and I'm so glad it is getting a second season.

B0064X7FVE|1.0|I got rid of the weather channel because I thought it may be draining my bandwidth since it is always running. Later, I decided it wasn't a big drain so reinstalled it to find it has few similarities to the old version.  It wants you to earn POINTS now!  I don't  want points, I want a comprehensive weather app!! I guess its revamped for 8 yr olds now. Good bye Weather Channel!
B00BVYNM4K|5.0|We loved all three seasons, would rate it a ten. Wonderful acting, costumes are just beautiful. Most of all, the three seasons are<br />sitting on the edge of your seat experience.. Its a shame Showtime did not pick it up for the fourth season. Shame on them.

B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Nemo' s reef is a fun creative game. The challenges are easy paced and you have pretty much free reign to create what you want. The fish and reef are relaxing to watch. Great for kid's and adults. The only issue I had is that it is difficult to replenish your pearls, so completing some challenges are near impossible.
B001DCZ4IW|4.0|Harold and Maude is hysterically funny. Ruth Gordon is RUTH GORDON. She is so convincing as this very unique older woman.  Harold's mother too is very much the aristocrat and the funniest scene is when she sends him to speak to her minister about marrying an 80 yr. old woman, when he is just about 21.
B009A87X80|5.0|No one can sing Over The Rainbow like she does.  Wish she was still with us.  She had a unique style and voice was was so haunting.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really makes you hone your problem solving ability by making you think outside the box. Very addicting, you won't want to put it down.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This series is a good look at life as times changed. I love it. I can't wait for season four.
B0060MYK7G|5.0|I<br /><br />compare this series to the Tudors and Elizabeth and also Golden Years.It is history with an edge!Love them!Continue filming
B003WUYRGI|4.0|my son is ok doing what he is doing. Putting the rest on is to hard so I'm just gonna play a game
B004U8VWLE|3.0|Natalie was great in this movie but It just wasn,'t something I would pay to watch. Better if its free.
0694003611|5.0|A great classic!  A must have for your child or grandchild.  Beautifully illustrated story that is perfect for cuddle up bedtime reading...or anytime!  Three generations of children in my family have loved this book.  Helps teach children the names of common objects in their environment as it entertains.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|What a good movie to watch as a family. It talks about being nice to others but I do think it's more for children over 8 years old.
0547391005|5.0|I can see why the Curious George stories have endured through the years.  I enjoyed him as a child, now I can share them with my 5 year old granddaughter, Lily and almost 2 year old grandson, Dominic.  Entertaining to little ones while teaching a lesson.
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|I love Tom but this movie was just ok. The story line was missing parts seems like to much was cut out. I would say wait till its free to watch.
B006IOCPI2|5.0|My son, now 30 yrs old, had a collection of Brio trains.  Some were lost over the years and I've bought new for my sons' son!  These toys are tough enough to stand up to busy hands and minds.  Never any rough edges.  Bright colors.
B0010SKUYM|4.0|The beginning didn't grab me right away but after that it was great. I enjoyed the character interactions and I love the main character. I'm reading the second book now and have not been disappointed in continuing this story.
B0097C8XL0|1.0|This looks so cute but according to Lookout this game is adware. If you're OK with random adware notifications then give it a try, otherwise steer clear.
B004SDEP38|5.0|I have been using this app for the past 2years both on Samsung S3/4 and on an IPhone..all without any problems,May I suggest that you take the full paid version as it does exactly what it claims
B00BR0SGN0|5.0|a wide variety of quality songs and playing.  since i didn't have any choice i will say it was well worth the wait, but a very strong lp and a must for us deep purple fans.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Was unsure about it  but once i got into it I wanted to play more but was able to put down when needed very good game for the whole family.
B005LJKEXS|5.0|ordered cable to use with a tethering program to connect a dslr camera to my computer for remote operation.  shipping was as stated and cable worked fine.  would do business with blue rigger again.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I've seen the movie and now they have a game for it. I am toataly pumped up right now! I recommend this game for all ages who know  how to play. So get it right away!!!
B000P407K4|5.0|One of Kubrick's most brilliant films!  Peter Sellers is hilarious and the satire is rich with irony.  I suggest that anyone watching this movie for the first time, watch the movie &#34;Fail Safe&#34; first.  The satire will make more sense...<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />The playback on my iPad2 was crystal clear.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Pretty fun game. I played it with my ten years old and we stayed up until we finished all levels....would love more
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|VERY CUTE &amp; ALOT OF fun, my grandson loves it &amp; so do I!!  Best of all .... no in app purchases, YEA!!!
B00CHIMG6Y|3.0|it was good movie but i reached a point where i just wanted it to end,  i don't think i would watch it again.
B003Y5H4Y8|5.0|Other reviewers have well drawn out the plot of this excellent film.  Yes, it is formulaic and yes the ending is all too predictable.  However, great acting transcends mediocre material and &#34;The Debt&#34; is no exception.<br /><br />The cast is perfectly balanced and well matched to their roles.  The standouts are Sam Worthington and Jessica Chastain.  Oh my.  Watch, enjoy and you'll see what I mean.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|I got exactly what I wanted.  The Aarm Clock size and color black goes with all my furniture in bedroom.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I got it for my grandson that was  visiting me and he loves it. He and his older cousin play it all the time.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|it was relly fun untill one day it wuldent load, i wuld like help but iyhe problem has not been resolved
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I find this game fun and entertaining. So far it's a great time killer and I'm not bored yet! would highly recommend.
B0095VP8D4|5.0|Great performance and great graphics for everyday home use. I have this paired with 16GB of RAM. Couldn't ask for more for a good fast machine capable of light gaming( no extra graphics card).
B003U4UPHG|4.0|We found the 2nd season always kept us on the edge of our seats, wondering what would happen next. Thoroughly enjoyed it.
B005M5XCZ8|5.0|This is a great movie for blu-ray, and and a wonderful movie altogether. For the price of $10 or less you cannot beat it
B0031YJFCQ|3.0|I really enjoyed the other two brooks by this author  but this on was not griping. In fact it was somewhat difficult to complete...
B00DEG4Z1W|4.0|My daughter really likes this one. Wish there were more options unlocked. But overall for free its worth the download.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|Really great DVD, was priced better then the super stores and came from amazon in record time.  If you enjoy western action movies I recommend this one highly.
B00A6WSTIW|4.0|Decent movie - Good action.  Although improbable story good acting and good actors.  Better than some action films.  Good actors.
B005544TRQ|5.0|The mix of characters and their respective idiosyncrasies permit enough variation in story lines that you don't feel like you're watching the same show over and over again with a different script.  We're halfway through season 2 and still wrapped up.  And watching it on Amazon without the commercials adds substantially to the enjoyment.
B008602KQI|4.0|Nice movie,great for teens also?has adventure,some funny parts ,and sadness. Would watch again and recommedbut not for small children though
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|my code is 121cdb . pleas add me ok and tell me Ur's . have fun. it is the best. game every.
B008BQ8VOC|4.0|Enjoy this series. Season two is not disappointing. Some of the witt of 'White Collar' which I love.. Try it:)
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book has a great story, and is well written. I would recommend it for anyone that enjoys stories of this type.
B004UFEJVW|5.0|A favorite movie, in this grandmother's eyes.  When I find a child's movie that I personally like to watch over and over, you know it's a keeper!!
B00DHSK3RM|3.0|this would be good if I could get the real game. Love playing the game on fb just wish you all get it for the kindle fire. Guide is no good if can't play the game.
B004XWLN20|5.0|I was relieved to find that the discs were all of high quality. I had previously read reviews about this series and others in which some of the discs were defective.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|My boys really love playing this game! I Like to play it also! My 8 year old son said he liked it very much!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It's amazing it's action packed yet filled with romance and drama and suspense and rebellion I have to get catchingfire
B00DGNOMB6|5.0|Great script. Great acting, great music, and Maggie Smith says the F-word for the first time on screen. What more can you ask foe?!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love Spider and this version is as good as it gets if not better. Even in 1 suit it has some challenge to it.<br /><br />Sincereleigh
B005VPRG10|5.0|10 year old son likes it because he likes star wars. Too expensive, though, as all other star wars toys.
1908117230|5.0|Interesting flavor combinations that would trigger the creativity in any pastry chef or home cook pastry maker. Just love him!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|A cute love story! A great story of self discovery and finding the true feeling of love.  Can't wait for more.
B00B4804KS|5.0|This is a surprisingly good 3D remake of the original film.  Thought it might be a disappointing effort, but I am quite pleased with the results.  My grandchildren love it!
B008D36INE|3.0|Slow story, acting was good but it seemed to drag and the ending was confusing.  Not the worst movie I've seen.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Fun game.  Typical mahjong game.  Nothing fancy.  It would be nice to have different tile choices but for getting this game for free it is quite a bargain.
B001UGB1X8|4.0|The movie had a good story line, easy to follow and great characters.  As usual Tommy Lee Jones was awesome.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Very much enjoyed reading this story.  I hope Dr. Alexander and his family find a way to shake the naysayers and enjoy what they now know to be a greater truth.
B00957T6X6|5.0|I am rating the series but I am only about a third of the way through the series.  Easy reading and well written.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|My boys and I loved trying to solve this intricate puzzle. Took us a couple of days, but it was a lot of fun! Looking forward to the next Room.
B00000IQW5|5.0|Saw it the year it came out. Watched several other times when it was on tv. Decided I wanted my own copy
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Keeps me thinking. Love the different variety of hardness in each level, it's not TH  typical hurry up and get each level done. You actuallly have to use common sense when playing
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple Run is awesome. To most people out doesn't seem as good as Temple Run 2 but I think it is better. You should try this app!! If you don't like it, get rid of it. (But you should totally get this app)
B00CDV6WDS|3.0|I can't be too  harsh since this was a free app on my Kindle.  But playing it on the Kindle can be frustrating due to the size of the tiles.  Also, when you run out of &#34;pairs&#34; of tiles, a small blinking notice that says &#34;no more matches, press here to shuffle&#34;.  It takes a few seconds to realize that you are out of tiles, another second or two to press the button to shuffle.  Sounds trivial, but it is timing you and if you have to re-shuffle several times, it adds up.  On the plus side, it does have a lot of design layout choices.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|Great movie for family movie night.<br />Kids love it<br />Enough to keep adults interested<br />So easy compared to going to red box
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I've been looking for a new alarm clock that is, reliable and easy to operate. This function on my Kindle really fits.  Very happy with it Thank you!
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|Somehow, they took several really great actors and made them seem like they were in a summer theater production in East Podunk, USA. I don't get it.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is awesome. This book is rad. I like this book.  I recomend this book to anyone. Really cool.
B00DU74U74|2.0|I didn't care for the representation at all...there were some great actors in this movie, and it all fell flat. I blame the director.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|Had to move one of my top tens over for this is one of the best films I have seen in many t=years, Denzel's best performance ever!
B00DHHWXYY|5.0|It would be a shame to miss out on such a wonderfully put together work of art due to preconceived judgments about remakes. So well done with the perfect amount of a modern twist. LOVE IT. Great acting and a killer soundtrack.
B000LGZHDS|5.0|I really am satisfied with this purchase. I bought it as a present and really liked it. Looks nice and I recomend it to everyone.
B004UID2LC|4.0|I loved being able to so easily down load a video...  I know it sounds so easy to everyone else but even though I've had my Kindle Fire for a couple of years I know that I am still not using it to its full capacity...so I'm really excited for this app!  And I love that it is free!  of course...<br /><br />God bless all your efforts,<br /><br />Betty Anne Casaretti
B005CGI4EG|5.0|Very good.all the dvds. work very clearly there is no freezing up or tileing and its a awesome show<br />And was shipped in good time.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|the most awesome game I have played in a while to be fair I haven't played a game in a while.
B001NLL8LA|5.0|Jack Reacher is the man to correct any wrong doing.  Jack does not bother anybody, but you mesh him and it's on!  He will deal out the punishment for where he see's fit..  I would not wish him on my worst enemy.  I love him.<br /><br />I have read all  of Lee Child's books in reference to Jack Reacher and I am waiting for more.
B009MO57H6|3.0|I understand that this is the 4th or 5th in the series but the story was weak! No new Zombies and although it was great to see all the character who were killed off before again, it just left me bored!
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I love that Merida is a strong female character and the story line of her and her mother was great! The music is good and the whole thing was great! Wish I had seen this one in the theater!!
B005LAIHXQ|4.0|My first Sci-fi flix was Ridley Scott's Alien and I watched it with my Dad at the age of 6. I got to see Prometheus in the theater with my Dad and it was awesome! You don't have to know about the Alien saga at all, this stands by itself. Although, for those of us who have watched the Alien series, it answered a lot of questions and brought up some new ones. Ridley Scott did an excellent job on this!! If you want a classic sci-fi movie, I recommend this one!
B0095VP8D4|5.0|Got this on sale as an upgrade to the A6 dual core. The performance increase is big. A great choice if you don't want a separate Gpu but still good if you do use one. I have Hd 7770 and it is a great card but the A6 was a bottleneck. Games would push it to 100% and the result was that i would have major frame rate drops. Moving to the A10 has solved that problem complete. Games fun smooth and no more bottleneck or fps drops. The A10 isn't terribly overclock able but not bad either. I went from the 3.8 to a 4.2 at 1.375volts. I tried 4.4 and 1.4volts but had instability. Didn't try higher voltage due to heat concerns. Without the gpu you will be able to play most modern games at medium and low settings no problem. As for high settings your millage will very by title but forget battlefield 3 and crysis 3 at high or better settings. In any case its still better than any system without a dedicated gpu has the right to perform. Being an amd chip it preforms better using multi core programs then single core but most users wont really notice the difference in average daily use.<br />  I got this on sale for $109.99 which is why i chose this over the new richland design. But if at regular price I recommend spending a little bit more for the richland over the trinity. Richland is better then trinity but not by a wide enough margin to justify a large price gap (sale).
B008NCSZQ8|3.0|It's unremarkable and that' all there is to say other than comic book and Robert Downey Jr. fans might like it
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I've watched the first two seasons and I live this series because of it's elegance and high morals.  There is enough happening to keep it interesting and I love all the characters.
B00CATSONE|5.0|This was a very good e-book to read and even inspired me to go get a computer science degree. It brings a different approach on what a genius is and how Nikola Tela had such a brilliant mind, even though he was poorly recognized.
0143036424|5.0|I enjoy the Longmire books because each plot is interesting, the characters are realistic yet quirky, and the setting is an important part of the storyline usually. The cold dish is revenge, always a great theme for a murder mystery. Get to know the &#34;real&#34; Walt Longmire (as opposed to the TV version)!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Once I started watching this show I couldn't stop. Can't wait for the new season July 16th. Just a couple more days away.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|Was disappointed that soon into the game you were given chances to buy game bits. As I bought it for my grandchild -who is 7....I ended up deleting it as too great a chance he would end up charging $$$$ to my account.
B00000163G|5.0|IF YOU LOVE TUPAC THEN THIS CD IS FOR YOU. AWESOME CD GETS ME HYPED EVERYTIME I LISTEN TO IT
B000VUCIZO|5.0|The man's life is uplifting. I looked so forward to spend an hour of two each night. He is so original and would be a great mentor to many. Loved it!!!!
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|Very exciting! Each dr who gives his own dimensional twist to the Doctor's character. This Dr. Who is one of the better ones.
B000P407K4|5.0|Aside from the Coke machine spraying Batguano in the face, this is a true masterpiece! Peter Sellers pulls off some incredible performances, and Terry Southern's writing gives the entire cast something to really sink their teeth into.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|It's great the only thing I don't like is that is asks you to rate every time you level up.
B005LAIHY0|4.0|This is one of those movies that a had expectations that it would go one way but it went another.  I was looking forward to seeing how, what, when, and where the alien came from.  Well, it does cover this but it is not the main concept.  After knowing this, I watched it on DVD and really enjoyed it much more.  I have watched it several times now and do hope he makes a sequel.
B005KDWUFA|5.0|THESE GUYS ARE AMAZING!!! LOVE THEIR MUSIC. I COULD LISTEN TO THEM ALL DAY LONG. WHAT A GIFT THEY EACH HAVE TO BE ABLE TO SING LIKE THIS.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love reading your books... Can't wait till the next one!!!! Please let me know when it comes out... puhber75@yahoo.com
B002VPE1WK|2.0|I have the canon backpack and large bag so I wanted to see if I could save some money and purchase his bag.<br /><br />For the most part it works. However if you have a larger camera such as a 5d or 6d the bag is just too small. This bag also feels very cheap. When you are carrying several thousands dollars of equipment you want a bag that feels strong and secure. Which is not this bag.<br /><br />This bag also only has room for two camera bodies and three lens. The only extra room I have is for my batteries and charger. There is no room for extra cables or flashes.  I also can attach a tripod using the outside straps...Only after the first day one of the straps fell out due to its poor design.<br /><br />For the money you pay you get that in a case. Nothing amazing but it will hold some of your gear.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Actually a very fun game. It teaches the importance of investing in vehicle maintenance! I had to spend a little (real) money to get deeper into the game, but it was worth it. Persistence is the key to success.<br /><br />As many have stated, it is addictive. I blew the better part of a beautiful afternoon driving that dog-gone jeep up and down those hills! I can see myself wasting a lot of valuable time if I don't exercise some self-discipline with this app.<br /><br />If you get it, you'll enjoy it. Good clean fun.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game. Good rainy day fun. Pencil and paper is a must. I cannot wait for more levels. Please hurry.
B00DU74U74|3.0|Loved the book, a little disappointed in the movie. &#34;In the head&#34; voice fell short and development of alien/ human romance was was non-exist ant.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Bought this for my 8 year old grandson. He LOVES it! He has created so many mines, homes, forests, ect.
B004CRR9G0|5.0|This is the anime that made me intrigued with Hayao Miyazaki !! Simply amazing masterpiece that I will continue to watch over and over. :)
B0002VFXFE|5.0|I have bought many a tube of thermal compound over the years, and I can tell you there probably isn't a large difference between the $3 dollar bargain kind and the $15 dollar expensive kind.<br /><br />That being said, I am somebody who likes to try different brands and stick with what I like. If it aint broke, don't fix it in a sense. I have been buying Arctic Silver thermal paste forever, and it hasn't failed me yet.<br /><br />That's about it, they make a good product that works and the price is right. That's kind of the winning formula for me.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love figuring out all the puzzles!It's a lot like 100 floors except, even better! I've passed all the levels I hope they make more! Make more levels please!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love this game, much more fun then temple run 1 or 2 and subway suffer. It is entertaining and the minions are way to cute. I love the side missions.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I enjoyed this book thoroughly! I recommend this read! I am ready to read the next book from Gillian Flynn!
B008EEZ64Y|4.0|Very good. Liked the writing. It helps to understand what could happen in the future. I would recommend this book to people who have read the hunger games.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I really like this game. It's very fun but not to challenging. Plus it needs more levels then I'll b even better. S over all its a good game but needs more levels and needs to be more challenge so get it. It won't be a waste of money.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It is really fun to play but is really a different game then most games companies make these days. I think the company could have made the game better.
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|I like the game. I think they should have keep the zombie thing so you can become one of the zombie because that was really fun to do.
B00B7Y0206|3.0|It is ok when it comes to watching videos but doesn't half the time work. I had to delete it because it just wasn't working  right one day and i just never downloaded it again.
B00DMM3WVM|5.0|I am glad that Amazon got this game. I have been wanting to get it for a while and I got it when it first came out on tbe appstore. The only thing i wish they would do would be for the company to add more guns to the game.
1439156816|5.0|When one thinks of Stephen King, one generally thinks of books in the \\"horror\\" genre, but he also has written science fiction, fantasy and mystery novels. All these genres I normally do not read; among other reasons, there just seems to be too much horror in the real world that one has to confront every day, so, why on your off time should you should you further wallow in someone's imaginative work of horror?  It would be like a soldier on R&R, from combat, choosing to watch war movies. At any rate, King has done immensely well with his craft, in his genres, with more than 350 million copies in print, making him one of the few who can support themselves, even well, from writing alone. So, figured it was worthwhile to read what he had to say about his trade, and I was well-rewarded for the effort.<br /><br />He commences with a most appealing image: in the early 90's, he joins a rock and roll band that was composed mainly of fellow writers, including Barbara Kingsolver, and Amy Tan. It was Tan who encouraged him to write this book. Much else resonated as well. For example, in his chapter entitled \\"Toolbox\\" he starts with the lyrics from a John Prine song: \\"Grandpa was a carpenter\\" who \\"chained smoked-Camel cigarettes\\" and \\"voted for Eisenhower, because Lincoln won the war.\\" King says that his Uncle Oren was also a carpenter, who, sure enough, did smoke camels. It is all a lead-in into having the tools of the craft available, including a proper outlook. For that, he says: \\"Good writing is often about letting go of fear and affectation. Affectation itself, beginning with the need to define some sorts of writing as `good' and other sorts as `bad,' is fearful behavior.\\" To write well, one must read well, and that takes time, as King expresses it: \\"You must be prepared to do some serious turning inward towards the life of the imagination, and that means, I'm afraid, that Geraldo, Keith Obermann, and Jay Leno must go. Reading takes time, and the glass teat takes too much of it. Once weaned from the ephemeral craving for TV, most people will find they enjoy the time they spend reading.\\" In terms of the specific tools, he does conduct a fair size war against the adverb, and would like to ban the \\"clearly\\" from all writing. The \\"clearly\\" should be implicit in how one writes. He also encourages \\"knocking out pronouns with unclear antecedents,\\" since \\"(I hate and mistrust pronouns, every one of them as slippery as a fly-by-nigh personal-injury lawyer.)\\"<br /><br />If you got this far, a couple of other choice tidbits include his evaluation of writing teachers as well as his \\"colleagues\\" in the publishing industry. For the former, he says: \\"I'm afraid this idea is rejected by lots of critics and plenty of writing teachers, as well. Many of these are liberals in their politics but crustaceans in their chosen fields. Men and women who would take to the streets to protest the exclusion of African-Americans or Native Americans...from the local country club are often the same men and women who tell their classes that writing ability is fixed and immutable; once a hack, always a hack.\\" In terms of his \\"colleagues\\": \\"But as a young man I did not yet realize that there are people in the publishing world - more than a few, actually - who would steal the pennies off a dead man's eyes.\\"<br /><br />Thoughtful, very informative, witty, even a reference work of sorts, by one of the true masters of the trade. 5-stars.f it.

0307595579|5.0|The first book of the trilogy was hard to put down, once I got through the first 30 minutes learning the names of Swedish people and towns. It is a real thriller, sure to be a classic. The second and third books were just as exciting, so much so that I viewed all three of the original Swedish films on Amazon streaming video. Highly recommended
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|I missed the series on TV and everyone said I had to watch it.  Wasn't sure I'd like it, but once I started watching I was hooked.  Can't wait for Season 3 to become available on streaming video.
B004SDEP38|1.0|After download this software was identified as spyware with Verizon<br />antivirus. Download at your own risk. I tried it twice and both times<br />antivirus caught the threat.

B000JMKQX0|5.0|Ok, I saw the movie first ( loved it ) then had a teenager snub me when I asked him if he had seen the movie. Hah he said read the book then we will talk. I see his point. Read this book. So good. I am sure I will read this book again and again. Umm..do you think maybe there could be a sequel? I could only hope.
B009UNGYHG|1.0|Ok, Plantronics, please tell me why when you are selling ONLY the charge case you put an ear piece in the product picture?  The expectation that the picture match the item purchased seems to be lost on Plantronics.  One star because of this mislead by Plantronics and 0 starts to amazon for having reviews cross referenced with the actual ear piece.  The reviews of this item should ONLY concern the case - NOT the ear piece.
B003JYOFIW|5.0|I'm in awe of groups that have faded over time and then come out with a last gasp album that smokes their previous offerings.  The B-52s did it with their \\"Funplex\\" album (if you don't have it, you should), and now Devo has done it with \\"Something for Everybody\\".  I didn't even know they had a new album out (well, new in 2010) until a college buddy of mine asked if I had heard it.  He sent me a bootleg, and after 3 listens I couldn't get half the songs out of my head.  Did the right thing and ordered an official copy, and now I've listened to it for weeks straight as I find each song becoming my favorite of the moment.  The tunes are very memorable, and the lyrics are catchy (if you're left-leaning; otherwise they might sound a bit preachy for those of you whose political ideas go right).  I know some will trash this because the music is far more accessible than their earlier stuff, but that's exactly what I like about it.  You still have that Devo attitude but it's been polished somewhat.  Do some Google searching on the Interwebz and you'll find a very entertaining set of videos that supposedly highlight the making of this album and the 'behind closed doors' corporate meetings that went on.  Very subtle stuff, but entertaining all the same.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|Kingdom Rush is the best designed and most fun tower defense game I have played, and I have played a lot. The specific choices you make placing and upgrading towers have a real impact on your success, far more so than in other games.<br />The production values (art style, music, and sound effects) are all very high, and the various components work together very well.<br />Even if you aren't a huge fan of defense games or of fantasy themes, Kingdom Rush transcends its categories to be a game with broad appeal.
B00D37UQ1K|5.0|The host is an amazing book and movie. I really enjoyed it a lot. The actors that were chosen did such nice job. they put so much emotion into their characters in [[ASIN:B00D37UQ1K The Host]]. Also i can't wait for the sequel to come out.... i hope they make that into a movie to.

B00AU15HPC|3.0|While this album will not knock the socks off modern day critics, most Moody Blues and Hayward fans will enjoy this offering from one of rock's most recognizable voices. The opening track \\"In Your Blue Eyes\\" introduces us to this (mostly) new set of tunes from Hayward and it is a typical fine opening song from our hero. One Day, Someday has Hayward taking on the persona of an alcoholic who seems to be trying to get out of the hole he's dug for himself and having a great deal of difficulty doing so. I find it interesting to see how Hayward is able to write songs that are character based rather than autobiographical. There's some of the usual spiritualism one comes to expect from Hayward in the next couple of numbers and overall, the new songs are nice and enjoyable, and as I mentioned before, nothing overwhelmingly amazing and nothing bad. I could do without the remakes of \\"It's Cold Outside of Your Heart\\" [1983] and \\"Broken Dream [1996, has it really been 17 years since a Justin Hayward solo album?].\\" While both songs are good, I would rather Hayward made use of other tracks he has probably been working on for years (perhaps these are being saved for a new Moody Blues album?). And I really don't care for the remix versions of I Know You're Out There Somewhere, though the version that's 2:48 is much more tolerable than the 8 minute version. I think if Hayward had taken out the remakes and the remixes, this album would fare much better. That being said, I listened to it four or five times in a row the first day I bought it. Again, if you love the Moody Blues and Justin Hayward, get this. It's been too long a time in between new recordings.

1594746036|4.0|Peculiar, yes - but also unique, engrossing and highly creative. When I was offered this book for review, I was unsure as what to expect; however, \\"Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children\\" proved to be a delightful surprise. I was quickly drawn into the story; the more I read, the more involved I became in the story.  So many books today seem to follow the same plot formula of yesterday's hot seller; however, here Riggs blurs the lines between reality and fantasy and creates a truly \\"peculiar\\" world that is difficult for the characters and the reader to leave. This is Ransom Riggs' first novel, and it is worth reading. A Young Adult book or not, I highly recommend the book to anyone who enjoys an exciting and clever fantasy. My wife just finished it, and now our  granddaughter (15) wants to read it next.  The sequel to \\"Miss Peregrine . . ,\\" \\"Hollow City,\\" is due out in January, 2014.  I am already standing in line to get the book.<br /><br />Monsters come is all types and sizes; normally, we think of them existing in the fantasy world.  However, Riggs reminds us through Grandfather Abe's story that throughout history, monsters exist in and come from us, the human race, as well. Thus, the plot teases us with the thought: \\"Where is the author going with this story?\\"  And, just when you think you get it, you don't!  The plot is unique and clever.  The characters are well developed, even the \\"monsters.\\"  The settings are engrossing and appropriate to the story.  There is no need to retell the story; you can find plot summaries elsewhere.<br /><br />In over 40 years of teaching English literature, I can unequivocally say that \\"Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children\\" is one of the most uniquely, creative books I have read.  It is a very original story; Riggs' amazing blending of the old, vintage photographs with the story creates a higher degree of interest and certainly adds to the \\"peculiar\\" nature of the novel.  I did struggle with a 4 or a 5, but although Ithought it was amazing, I felt I still had to rate it a 4 due to some editorial errors and a few spots which could have been developed a bit more. Still, the characterization was well developed. I especially enjoyed the character of Abe, the grandfather, and I would have loved to have seen his story developed even more.  Perhaps a prequel?  Mr. Riggs, are you listening?
B00DGN51O8|4.0|Enjoyable fast paced family movie from beginning to end . Great cast and very good special effects brought a fairy tale to life
B008393Q2O|3.0|Skinny Note is OK, but it would be nice if it had more features.  I'd like to be able to edit the note on the fly, just click where I want to add, change or delete.  But it comes up to another screen then you have to edit from there.  Just another step that doesn't need to be there.  You can checkmark that the item is completed, but to delete it you have to go to the edit screen and delete there.  Another step.

034580709X|4.0|THE BAT: The First Inspector Harry Hole Novel by Jo Nesbo is the book where readers first meet Harry Hole. Nesbo has made this character famous and his fans love will love this book as well, especially now that it finally been translated into English. The characters and storyline hold your attention but with so many twists in the story, it is really hard to figure out or guess what will happen....which makes for a clever narrative. THE BAT is not my favorite Nesbo book but especially Harry Hole fans will appreciate learning all the background about the character that this book includes. With this information, fans will begin to understand the Hole character a bit more although I am not sure anyone will ever understand all of his destructive ways. Interesting and does stand alone well.

1451695195|5.0|I recommend reading this book. It describes a unique near-death experience in medical terms - one in which key areas of the brain were inactive, and include relevant testimonies of medical doctors on the author's experience. The author's great knowledge of human brain and the unique experience he went through made it possible for him to write a really interesting and novel book about the subject.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|\\"The date for the end of the world... it's in four days.\\"  This quote is the final sentence of the first chapter of James Rollins' latest Sigma Force thriller, The Eye of God. In other words, it's just another low-stakes drama from this master of disaster. This time around, the prologue opens in AD 453 with the death of Attila the Hun. From there, we quickly move to present-day Rome, with our old friends Vigor and Rachel. (Already, things are off to a good start!) Vigor is consulting with his niece about a mysterious package he's just received from an old friend--a priest declared dead more than a decade prior. The package contains an artifact, a human skull etched with Jewish Aramaic. It also contains a book bound in human skin. And these artifacts are pointing towards a coming apocalypse with a very imminent date.<br /><br /> At the same time at an air force base in California, \\"something's gone wrong.\\" according to Sigma's Painter Crowe, who happens to be in attendance. A special camera has been tracking a comet's progress through space, trying to collect \\"proof that the comet was shedding or disturbing dark energy in its wake.\\" After a few pages of fairly sexy physics talk, remote data is retrieved: \\"It displayed a satellite view of the eastern seaboard of the United States, the photo taken as the satellite blazed a trail across the sky. It was detailed enough to make out the major coastal metropolises. Boston, New York City, Washington, D.C. with every city laying in a smoldering ruin.\\" So, you've got your ancient prophecies lining up disturbingly with your weird space-time science anomaly prophesies. Ladies and gentlemen, this is where the fun starts! The Eye of God is a gripping tale of science, history, adventure, and mind boggling theories of how reality, as we understand it, may not be reality at all.<br /><br /> I was going to ding him on a plot element being too outlandish, but as he often does, he followed it up with enough science that I was willing to continue suspending my disbelief. No, this is a strong novel in the long-running Sigma series. The plot is fascinating, and I hope it goes without saying that it moves at a lightning pace. Furthermore, there are significant developments among the major players. And that's all I'll say about that.<br /><br />Now, I've reviewed a lot of Rollins' past Sigma novels in the past seven months ,and the reviews have always been great because Mr. Rollins is so consistent with the strengths of his novels. So please bear with me as I go over the major bullet points:<br /><br />* I have read this type of science/adventure thriller before and I don't think there's another writer out there that can touch Rollins for the complexity of the tales he weaves--and I mean that in an entirely positive way. Above I alluded to Attila the Hun, the Roman Catholic Church, advanced physics, and Jewish mysticism. That is merely the tip of the iceberg. Throw into the mix Genghis Khan, the world's only freshwater seal, exotic locales spanning the globe, magnetic fingertips (So freakin' cool!), St. Thomas, multiverses, and the question, \\"Could the ancient Chinese have had knowledge of events described in the book of Genesis?\\" In every book, Rollins weaves an astonishing number of incredibly diverse, incredibly cool elements into one cohesive tale. And usually it hangs together so well, I wonder if he hasn't stumbled onto some secrets of the universe.<br />* Again, I must commend the author on his strong female characters. I don't think readers are ever disappointed when Rachel and Seichan are both a part of the mix. The Eye of God introduces several noteworthy new female characters as well. (And for those of you waiting for something to happen with Gray... Your wait is over.)<br />* And as always I find Kowalski to be the most funnist character in the novel. This time around he enters with the line, \\"Why does that duck keep looking at me?\\" Which is just so Kowalski. I thought he was funnier than ever in this book. I want to quote all his best lines, but I'll refrain.<br />* Easter eggs! There are Easter eggs in this novel that refer to a non-Sigma book in the Rollins-verse. It's not a character this time around. I`ll have to read whichever book those esater eggs are referancing.<br />* As always he leaves one super-cool author's note at the end describing what's fact and what's fiction, this time there are several of them.<br /><br />The way James Rollins seamlessly includes scientific theories on dark energy, quantum physics, the multiverse theory, and quantum entanglement will draw you in and keep you thinking for days after you've finished the book. It all comes down to a these questions... What is reality? Are we all just a 3D hologram? And what happens to us after we die? Does our energy just leave the universe forever? Or is what we perceive as death not even real? Is it possible that our consciousness just moves to another form of a different reality, to live out the rest of our lives on the other side of the same coin?<br />This book guarantees you will come to question everything it is that you think you know.<br /><br /> I honestly don't know how long James Rollins can possibly come up with these convoluted tales he spins. Surely he's written about every single interesting thing in the universe by now? But apparently not. As long as he keeps writing them, I'm going to keep reading them! I highly recommind this book for anyone who wonders about life and what happens after it ends.ver in this book. I want to quote all his best lines, but I'll refrain.<br />* Easter eggs!

B005CA4SQK|5.0|Kind of pointless to review the show from a content perspective at this point, but in short I really enjoyed it.  The Blu-ray presentation here is terrific as well: the video quality and sound design are both high quality, while the extras on this three-disc collection are definitely worth the extra cash.  There's a fantastic documentary exclusive to Disc 3 that features a great amount of location footage as these episodes are being shot, with plenty of fun and interesting moments featuring the cast and crew.<br /><br />The packaging also deserves special mention: it's a beautiful digipak design  with a nice matte finish and killer artwork.  The three-panel spread on the inside (where the discs are held) is a striking composite image featuring art from the comic blending with a cast photo.  As a whole, it's really aimed at die-hard fans...so if you're one of them, this is the version to buy.

B000JMKQX0|4.0|This book reads like a work of non-fiction.  The fact that it was an oral history (a series of interviews) made me apprehensive about reading it, but it more than held my interest from start to finish.  I felt like I was reading a true historical writing, and that made it all the more compelling.
B00DU74U74|5.0|This movie kept me interested and involved in the story from the moment it started.  The cast was well chosen and the acting was flawless.<br /><br />It was a welcomed rest from violent sci-fi movies with monsters and non-stop destruction scenes.<br /><br />I liked it so much I watched it twice!  I'd love to see a sequel to this and perhaps a prequel.
B003Y7AR4K|4.0|Very nice performance, excellent video quality, but I prefer the Bolshoi Ballet version, which I have seen many time but cannot find in the quality of this version.
B00DM0XXCM|2.0|To begin with the idea behind the central theme wasn't thought out well enough to be believable. The acting was good, but character development was missing.  Too bad I wasted my time and money on this film.

B0007Y08IS|4.0|Keep this on a high shelf away from the kids.  Very adult, but very, very funny.  The depiction of a certain deceased North Korean dictator is particularly 'side splitting.'
B001974DG0|2.0|I was shocked to see that at the end of this book Dean Koontz commented that this was one of his greatest literary pieces and with that revelation I just might not be reading any more of his novels. I had read something of his in the past and really enjoyed it but I found this book lacking and even ended up speed reading and skimming sections of the book. There was LOTS of character development and it sort of just fizzled in the end. As if the author had a word count to complete and stretched it out until that mark was within reach and tied up the book in the end.<br /><br />I wanted to like it, and yes the dog was cute, but each time something happened I had the attitude &#34;now what's wrong&#34; with the dog.

B00CWY76CC|2.0|I did not like this at all. Maybe because I just did not get too in to the game. I gave this a quick try, but quickly got it off my Kindle because I felt I was not getting too much out of it.

B005GY0Y8S|4.0|Fast paced.  Good characters.  I did not care for all the French words (since I don't speak French).  However, since one of the main characters and much of the setting was in France, I suppose that was to be expected.  Enjoyable.
0385349947|5.0|I believe both woman and man should read this book, it helps us understand better woman behaviour in special when we talk about ambition to success. There are many internal issues conditioned by society since women are born that are ignored and, in fact, knowing and overcome them would be the key to a woman to respects herself and understand how great is her ability to lead and achieve success without being &#34;disliked&#34; by the society. I high recommend! Thank you Sheryl

B00BN3DPQ4|2.0|If you've seen the trailer, there's no spoilers here.<br />Arnold and his town cronies were dynamic, had great character and some whispers of conflict.  Then came the criminal transport.  That ENTIRE aspect of the movie felt tacked on as an after thought.  Based upon the characters, it seemed like what &#34;should've&#34; been the story is something like an ex-con arrested by Schwarzenneger's character moves into that sleepy border town to use it for running people, guns, drugs... and then Schwarzenneger makes a &#34;Last Stand&#34; to stop him.  Instead some random Gov't Agent decides for random reasons to move a criminal from a &#34;high security&#34; prison to another &#34;high security&#34; prison by using very &#34;low security&#34; transportation.  Minor SPOILER:  At one point the Gov't agent says, &#34;we're going to go real quiet, under the radar&#34;  Then a convoy of like 20 black Gov't SUVs roar down the road!  Definitely NOT quiet and under the radar.  :-\
B009MF5BXK|5.0|Might be better than the first one. It was great to see some of the new characters added like Chuck Norris and Van Damme (didn't like him as a bad guy though).Great movie.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It's addicting and fun, but a lot of the time the controls won't work and end up getting me killed instead of dodging.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I enjoy having the large gas and brake pedals. The game is well done and I look forward to further progress...
B006LXQID8|3.0|too boring...! surprised . I prefer something more ... it is too many third party statements instead of natural talks
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Who hasn't looked at an anonymous photo as a child and wondered at what the history and story behind the image could be? This novel is the answer to a similar exercise and a grand imagining, indeed.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|This was a good read with some fresh sci-fi ideas.<br />John Scalzi paints a great picture with his writing.<br />I would recommend this to any sci-fi fan.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I really enjoyed this game.  Graphics are amazing, hints are good, couldn't put it down. Highly recommended for persons that like Hidden Objects games.
B003PBB4ME|4.0|Very sturdy, and solid.  I like that you can mount on a tri-pod, although I'm not sure how much I will actually use that feature.  I am using this for my GoPro camera, and have found that I need to add a spacer, or washer under the tripod mont adapter to get a solid fit, otherwise the camera doesn't fully seat on the mount.  I like this product so far, and especially since I got it for 40% off.  I can't wait to do some more filming with it.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have read this book multiple times. I actually own the hardback versions but needed them on my Kindle too. Now I have a complete collection x2 The books are just that good.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Its really good, but more characters would make it better. And it also lags a little so it would be helpful to speed the characters up in time with my fingers :)
B00633W614|4.0|I wish I'd read part 1 first.  Can Amazon show these parts on their listings? Either that or date of publication would help in any of these series books.

B00821OX98|4.0|Interesting premise for the story line. Good acting all around. The special effects are pretty good too. Good SCI FI.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|Good movie for the family. The kids enjoyed it and it was fun to watch! I would highly recommend this family friendly film.
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|I was always a bit lukewarm towards QOTSA.  I liked a few of their songs but never a huge fan.  So a friend of mine picked up this CD and I decided to give it a listen.  SO SO glad I gave it a chance.  It's Josh Homme's best work yet.  I can listen to this whole album, I think all the songs are great.  The album as a whole fits together so well.  And, in my opinion, has one of the best ending tracks (10 ...Like Clockwork) I've ever heard.

1556438850|5.0|This is an amazing book. I could not believe the level of detail on each of the many topics covered. I am in a yoga teacher training a learning how complex this topic is. The author writes very clearly and succinctly...revealing the depths of teaching yoga. There are yoga teachers who I wish would read this book.
B003FZ9AR6|4.0|This is a three and a half star film. I rounded up. When you are dealing with a holocaust film anything that falls flat seems disrespectful. Elijah Wood's character is a bit over the top. As is the grandpa. Then the story turns unbelievable at the moment of illumination. But the movie has lots of good things in it.  I especially like the way the dialog is not translated as intended. It rings true to me when I have suspected that someone is not telling me the full truth about what someone else is saying in another language. I probably would disregard this review after reading that last sentence. There is a sweet sincerity about the whole film. It's a midweek rental.
B00B2OSZIW|5.0|I gave this product five stars because it does exactly what I hoped it would do. It changed the level of holding my X-E1 from adequate to comfortable. I know, it seems like way to much money but after a day in the field my hand is not tired or stressed. The price seems well worth it then. By the way with this size camera I use a wrist strap and hold the camera in my shooting hand 75% of the day.<br /><br />Yes, you do have to remove the grip to access the battery and/or memory card. This is no big deal. When I go out for the day my battery is fully charged and my card is empty. After about 300 to 350 snaps you will need to replace the battery and may be the card depending on the card capacity. If the extra 30-40 seconds it takes to remove the grip and put it on seems like a hassle to you VS the benefit described above. Definitely do not purchase this item.
B004X2M3N8|5.0|Although I prefer David Tennant as The Doctor, the stories in this season have been excellent. Most have overlapping story lines that carry through from one episode to the next. The couple that didn't were the weaker episodes, but they were still enjoyable. I've been surprised at how many episodes were two-part episodes and a little disappointed that it wasn't apparent until an episode would end that I needed to watch a second one to see the story wrap up. This cost me some sleep on numerous nights as I couldn't just stop after one episode and would have to stay up to watch another.
1781162646|5.0|This book held my interest from page one.  Set primarily during a North Carolina summer, it captures the feelings of a young man dealing with his broken heart.  Simultaneously, Stephen King tells a tale surrounding this young man that will keep you wanting for more.  It's a book you will want to put on your summer reading list.
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|I thought this movie was going to be another cliché Tom Cruise flick - well actually I was hoping it would be.<br />But it was not, I think Tom Cruise was stuck somewhere between a retired Ethan Hunt and an unenthused Danny Kaffee - which was not an overly entertaining character...<br />My expectations having been stated, it was a pretty well put together &#34;dramatic&#34; movie that entertained me well once, although I probably will not give it a second chance.
0226443221|5.0|It is almost impossible to believe that one heat wave could kill over 700 people in the city of Chicago.  But that is exactly what happened in the heat wave of July 1995.  And it is even more staggering to think that the city did not want to realize the severity of this disaster and tried to pass it off in a number of ways - although given the nature of politics, perhaps this is not so surprising.  In \\"Heat Wave: A Social Autopsy of Disaster in Chicago\\" Eric Klinenberg thoroughly examines the heat wave and its aftermath and raises questions about social disparity that are impossible to ignore.<br /><br />In July  of 1995 the city of Chicago did not have an emergency plan in place for instances of natural disaster such as the one that befell the city that month.  In fact, the negligible plans that they did have in place were incapable of dealing with the disaster.  As the heat soared above 110 degrees, people were dying left and right and emergency responses were overloaded and unable to respond.  Bodies piled up outside the morgue, with refrigerated trucks being called in to handle the vast number of corpses that arrived daily.  The vast majority of these deaths were elderly people, poor people, people who were isolated and live on their own, those who did not have the resources to afford air conditioning or had no one who would check up on them.  This speaks more to the social disparity that exists in Chicago than it does to personal preferences.  This city full of multimillion dollar highrises has millions of inhabitants who live in poverty, in run down housing, in neglected or moved out of parts of the city.  These are neighborhoods where elderly residents are afraid to leave their houses past certain times or even at all, out of fear of the gangs and drugs and violence on their streets.<br /><br />So why did so many people die?  Klinenberg paints a grim picture of the social breakdown that left so many poor and elderly people stranded in their houses.  He culls an even grimmer picture of a city government that tried to pass the buck, first by claiming that the number of deaths couldn't possibly be that high and then when they could no longer dispute that fact, claiming that all of the deaths couldn't just be from the heat.  When they could no longer dispute that fact, the government took to playing a war of words, using euphemisms to describe the catastrophe to disguise what it truly was.  Klinenberg also examines the media response, one that furthered the government's position or focused on the natural disaster rather than the human element.  Very few journalists seemed willing or able to question why this had been allowed to happen.<br /><br />I have lived in the Chicagoland area for twelve years and have never heard of the 1995 heat wave until I heard the author speaking on NPR earlier last year.  In news broadcasts of blizzards and floods, the reporters always remind viewers of similar past events.  I can't recall a single summer weather newscast about extreme heat that included any reference to July of 1995.  Why?  Maybe because it's been forgotten, or maybe because people want to ignore a very dark chapter in the history of the city.  Maybe it's because the heat wave caused the city to have emergency plans that actually work in place - cooling centers, volunteers who will make phone calls or wellness visits.  Klinenberg has written an eye-opening, clinical examination of a terrible catastrophe  that affected those populations that the city has pushed to the fringes  -the poor, the elderly, the minorities.  Maybe it isn't mentioned because nothing has truly changed in the \\"city that works\\" when it comes to social disparity.an even grimmer picture of a city government that tried to pass the buck, first by claiming that the number of deaths couldn't possibly be that high and then when they could no longer dispute that fact, claiming that all of the deaths couldn't just be from the heat.

B000NTPDSW|5.0|These films are obviously fantastic, which is why one would want to buy the collection in stunning HD - so there were really no surprises there.  My surprise came when I opened my box set about ten days after it arrived and found there were no discs inside at all!(it was even still factory shrink wrapped!)<br />So I called Amazon and after maybe 30 seconds on hold I was speaking with a very helpful representative who laughed with me and apologized deeply on behalf of Amazon.  He told me that it would ship out right away and that I would get the shipping info to return the empty case at my leisure.  And that was that, they were easy to deal with on the phone, the whole call process took less than ten minutes and the best part is it was shipped next day priority!<br />I called with a problem at 1pm on a Friday and had my replacement at my door at 11am Saturday!! 22 hours from call to replacement - Customer Service like that just simply cannot be beat!
B00D8OHPF8|4.0|To put it simply.  I love this album!!! Another great body of work from Joe.  He is an artist who doesn't get nearly enough recognition.
0345803507|5.0|Just a fun read all the way around. It's so engaging you don't want to stop. The characters have their degree of unbelievable-ness, but you get so caught up in the fantasy you can't help but root, and cry and shout for/at Christian and Ana. Grab your e-reader and lock yourself in the room for three days. You won't regret it.
B00821PCJS|4.0|It's a must see series, good story line, it keeps your interest going and you want to see more of this series.
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|I like the game, it downloaded quickly - does somewhat lock up periodically but nothing serious.  I would recommend it to friends.
1439102813|5.0|I have not had a book touch me the way that this book has ever.  The journey that we are taken on with Alice, the main character, is a journey that you will not likely soon forget.  While reading this book I felt guilt, happiness, sadness, and powerlessness.  I wish this book was available to me when my grandmother was still alive.<br /><br />You see, my grandmother suffered from Alzheimer's disease.  It began when I was in college and lasted until I became a young mother myself.  We grew up across the street from my grandmother to I had daily experiences with what she was going through.  Unfortunately, and I am not proud to admit this, I reacted like Alice's colleagues did rather than as a granddaughter should.  I thought my grandmother was crazy and old.  I did not take the time to understand what is was that was wrong with her.  This book gave me the first insight as to what it must be like for person who is slowly loosing her memory.  I just assumed that my grandmother did not know she was loosing her memory.<br /><br />***Spoiler Alert***<br />I could not stop crying long enough during the book when Alice was holding her granddaughter.  The baby was crying and Alice did not know who her daughters were and why there were yelling at the man.  Between the crying baby and everyone arguing over Alice right in front of her, I had immediate flash blacks to living near my grandmother.  When I had my first daughter, my grandmother would sit and hold her for hours.  She would just hold her.  By the time I had my third baby, 5 years later, she could not be trusted to hold a baby let alone walk anywhere my herself.<br /><br />I could relate to Alice's children worrying about whether or not they could get dementia as they got older.  I worry about my own mother all of the time.  She is young, only 65, but Alice was only 51.  Every time that my mother repeats something that we talked about a few days before I wonder if it is starting all over again.  At least now I think I can be more compassionate than I was with my grandmother.<br /><br />Only one part of the book bothered me.  When Anna wanted to get pregnant and she had her embryos tested to see whether or not they carried the Alzheimer's gene.  She made sure that she got pregnant with babies that would not get the disease.  One part of me understands this, but one part is morally opposed to the whole situation.  Should we all start genetically testing our fetuses for cancer and other horrible diseases?  Are we working towards a society that has nothing but perfect, healthy people in it?<br />What if Alice choose not to have Anna because she found out that she carried the disease?<br /><br />All in all, this book is absolutely worth reading.  Keep a box of kleenex nearby and your loved ones close~~~~

B008JFUPK8|4.0|***This review may contain spoilers***<br /><br />I must admit I was a bit leery about watching \\"Man of Steel\\" (hereafter MoS) after hearing rumors that he would undergo some sort of dark, tortured, and psychologically probing \\"Dark Knight\\" makeover, or some sort of Spiderman-like brooding existential angst.  No matter how eager you are to confirm realistically Superman's importance to our modern jaded times, you really don't have a lot of dramatic wiggle room with the legendary Kryptonian.  We must face facts; for over 75 years, Superman has been as close to God as a mortal can hope to get.  How do you reintroduce Superman as a new, fresh character without fundamentally changing who he is?<br /><br />  MoS addresses this unenviable dilemma by, yes, combining some of that Spidey existential angst with the old \\"journey towards your destiny\\" plot, while still maintaining and elaborately explaining the basic elements of his origin.  This time, though, the realization of his Christ-like destiny as mankind's protector and savior is more tentative, erratic, and uncertain.  Superman has all the marvelous powers we know and love, but he must learn to control, focus, and use them at the right time.  The movie's shocking depiction of young Clark's uncontrolled X-ray vision and how it compels him to hide in his school's janitor's room is a novel illustration of this.  Also, his forbearance will be interpreted as wimpiness, so he will be unwisely baited by kid and adult bullies to fight back. Clark/Kal-El (buff but endearing hunk Henry Cavill) will learn from his holographic father/mentor Jor-El (a solemn Russell Crowe) that he is the symbolic AND genetic embodiment of his race and must accept the task of not only setting an example for Earth, but also somehow regenerating Krypton.  Furthermore, he must accomplish this task without frightening the suspicious, fearful earthlings. This is indeed a heavy Herculean burden.<br /><br />  But, was there any real doubt that Superman could bear this burden?  Besides Jor-El, he receives unexpected guidance from intrepid, globetrotting newspaper reporter Lois Lane, no longer the clueless, hopelessly reckless victim of old.  She doggedly follows Clark's odd job wanderings and convincingly pieces together who he is and cares about him as a person first (and not a love at first sight).  Of course Jonathan and Martha Kent (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane) provide the down-to-earth grounding and patient nurturing that Clark needs as an emotional anchor.  MoS shows that Superman will need that guidance when the wild-eyed maniacal Kryptonian General Zod (Michael Shannon) and his troops accidentally burst free from the Phantom Zone due to Krypton's explosion, and make a beeline towards Earth as a platform for his own ruthless resuscitation of the old homeworld.  There's nothing like a planetary threat to help a superhuman decide what he wants to do with his life.<br /><br />  Of course, this will involve epic, world-shattering clashes that would make the Transformers rust with envy.  But once the dust and rubble clears, the iconic, and reassuring Superman (and Clark Kent) personas emerge at last.  That is why I mainly enjoyed MoS - it respects what Superman represents and is while still exploring his thoughts, feelings, and hopes for the future, and challenging his values and morals.  This is a tricky dance, but MoS executed it well.<br /><br />P.S.  As other posters have logically and thoroughly documented, MoS does have its head-shaking inconsistencies and plot stumblings.  For example, we have the infamous tornado scene; Jonathan should have realized that Clark could have saved him at blurry super-speed without revealing his identity.  This could have also applied to the school bus rescue.  Jonathan's obsession with concealing Clark's true nature was also maddeningly baffling. And, of course, the destructive Superman/Zod showdown.  Superman realistically would be facing a tidal wave of civil and even criminal litigation, and the Smallville/Metropolis populace would be outraged and want these aliens gone. Finally, Superman's deadly resolution of the Zod problem was most likely unnecessary.  There were numerous other ways to end the threat before resorting to that uncharacteristic act.  Nonetheless, MoS is both thoughtful, introspective, and just plain rousing, slam-bang entertainment that rates a 4.5al litigation, and the Smallville/Metropolis populace would be outraged and want these aliens gone.

B00CTKHXFO|5.0|What can I say? As a hardcore Metal Gear fan this collection might be the greatest thing to ever come out. I have already previously owned all of the other games individually but I felt that this was a necessity being my hardcore dedication to Metal Gear Solid. Since all of the games are included there is a TON of hours to play, completing the entire game of Peacewalker by itself will take you at least 60 hours! Over all, this is the greatest HD Collection I owned, the artbook that is included is a bonus that is a must-have for all Metal Gear Fans!!! Buy this, and if you don't have a ps3, buy a ps3 and buy this! Worth all $50!

B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|I love the graphics in this game, but it's kind of hard to get to know. There are no real good instructions to help out. I'm not a gamer, but I wanted to try this one because I love the movies, but I can't figure out what's going on and how to work it properly, plus it gets hung up frequently. Oh well, I'll hopefully get the hang of it soon.

0451232852|4.0|The first book I picked up of Ken Follett's was \\"Winter of the World.\\"  After reading a few pages, I decided that it should be worth reading the prequel, \\"Fall of Giants\\".  So I did, and I am glad for it.<br /><br />\\"Fall of Giants\\" is simply marvelous.  To be sure, there are times it gets tedious and a tad too boring --- especially the times when Mr. Follett describes the footings and mechanisms of war.  But luckily, these portions are limited and far more attention is paid to developing the characters themselves.  And these characters do shine through --- the Welsh ones through the grime of mining coal, the Russian ones through the oppressiveness of the czar, the German ones despite their headlong rush into World War I, and the American ones despite their ordinariness and aloofness from what is transpiring in Europe.<br /><br />Almost any kid will tell you that the trigger for World War I was the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand of Austria.  But what most children will not be able to enunciate is why was this area of Europe such a tinderbox that one assassination plunged it into despair for years to come.  The tenuous alliances bolstered by treaties drawn up a long time ago, the conflicts and hostilities among the countries separated by disputed borders and the foot dragging and posturing by other nations, all played a part into lighting the fuse that lead to World War I.  Mr. Follett weaves all of these expertly into his narrative.  I, for one, have a much deeper understanding and appreciation for the causes of the conflict after having read the book.<br /><br />As a lesson in history seen through fictional eyes, this book is simply enthralling.  Mr. Follett has crafted quite a story out of the events and the impressions of Europe that lead to the war. The result is simply astonishing and well worth a read. (June 2013).
0756404746|5.0|Amazing fantasy story. The plot, the characters and the grip this book will hold on you while you read is everything I want out of a book. The same is true for the sequel and I can not tell you how much I am looking forward to the third book.

B007SYWFRM|4.0|the game is easy to play and is a lot of fun.  other than trying. to find the squirrel - it is very easy to play.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|after many years black sabbath is back and there first number 1 album  for their career this cd rocks !
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|OMG, where to next??  I am so glad for the additional characters.  So much more to write about.  I'm excited about the next book.
B004SUWR2C|4.0|I like this game a lot but have had some difficulty navigating it. I like the pace and that it doesn't take too much time to play. It's a good time waster or before-bed activity that can be engaging or mindless.
B000A1SZ2Y|5.0|best choice whit sx50 hs<br />supermacro whit canon superzoon superpictures...<br />rly good take a picture of eye of bugs cool
B00BP4Z8XY|3.0|I still love most animated films and if I think it's good, will pay to see it in the theater (no, I don't have children either). I really looked forward to this one and had high hopes but it was disappointing. It was too much into Sugar Rush and took away any of the edge it might have had. I do like it and would watch it again with anyone who hasn't seen it but this won't be my go-to animated film.Good for a watch to say you've seen it though.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|PLEASE QUIT TRYING TO IMPROVE THINGS WITH FANCY NEWS WAYS TO VIEW THE FORECAST, IF YOU GOT SOMETHING GOOD LEAVE IT ALONE FOR GOD'S SAKE!
B00005T7I1|5.0|This is a classic!  Al Pacino, Warren Beatty, Madonna, Dustin Hoffman and many others--all like you've never seen them--as colorful cartoon characters with outrageous traits.  Pacino is outstanding.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|When your bored and need something to do this is the  game fir you I enjoyed this game a lot because I spend a lot of my free time not doing anything
B0015DWJX2|4.0|A wonderful book about extraordinary people  in a unique corner of the world.  Its a book that I will revisit again and again.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I like this game and all,but I don't like the fact that they keep asking for you to buy things constantly! It's really fun to play though and I never get tired of it. It's not boring at all like most free games.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I have read other books about NDE and it was interesting hearing from a scientific point of view. It is smooth reading until you get to the detailed medical portions of the book which were far beyound my understanding. I am sure these sections were written specifically for the medical community. Nevertheless, it was nice to see that view point.
B00CDSVZHY|3.0|A very dark brutal tale.Good movie if your a Tarrantino fan,maybe not so much if your not.Bloody brutal and lots of swearing,definitely rated R!
B001GCUER0|5.0|I received the dvd within 3 days and watched every episode within a week..loved it. Can't say enough about the season but the product was fantastic thanks to the sender.
B0011E7JBW|5.0|The humor in this movie keeps me watching again and again!  Great for the entire family!  We like to save it for holidays when all ages are around the house!
B0092ZEIN4|2.0|Pros<br />-Well built, not cheap feeling<br />-Easy to sync with my Nexus7<br /><br />Cons<br />-Analog sticks are too stiff and if you are not careful when putting pressure there is too much movement from a push - this makes MANY games unplayable.<br />-Some buttons aren't recognized by any games, namely the back triggers and select. Start does not pause games, it acts like the Home Button.<br /><br />I will be waiting on Google's official controller which will come out with their rumored official console (might be a while).
B0012NO316|5.0|E. Taylor portrays a woman that I have no words for.  But, I've seen this movie a dozen times and will see it a dozen more.  The insanity of relationships and games people play are the 2 things that come to mind.  Just absolutely crazy good!
0553386794|5.0|I mean, of course, being George Martin's epic series the book itself doesn't disappoint. And this particular book was in good condition.
B003DCTC6K|5.0|From the beginning to end, the intrigue starts.  The finish of this film is truly original.  Watched several times!  Love it!
B0015DRPJU|5.0|This is one of the best book from this novels. I have read this book 5 times now lol. I tell my friends to read them because they are great and their will be a movie out soon too. Just love it.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|I deleted this app because it didn't even have the level I was on. It only had a select few. No help at all.
B0077EBWVI|4.0|i like this movie just as much as the first  one what a great eye opener for me well tell people to give it a try
B009ICQ6KO|5.0|I bought this album without having heard any cuts from it.  I like both Ben Harper and Charlie Musselwhite and took a flyer on it.  My favorite cut is &#34;We Can't End This Way&#34;, but there isn't a song on the album that I don't like.  I highly recommend it.
B000FC13Y0|5.0|A classic I think!  Neil Gaiman writes for the child's spirit still present in all adults. His storytelling is beautiful and fun and the story makes you look at the world in a different way.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Move over Perry Mason, Arnie Becker and Jack McCoy - Harvey Specter is the best lawyer in the history of television.
B00A8MGLAI|3.0|I was really expecting more for a movie with Tom Hanks. It is very hard to follow (8 story lines going on at once) and I never got that &#34;feel-good&#34; experience I expect from a movie (which is after all just entertainment).
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Once again Stephen King masterfully weaves a fantastic tale that fully engages the reader in sights, sounds and emotions.  Love it!
B00A81NFAS|5.0|This one very much exceeded my expectations. Great acting and story telling. I bought it on a whim and wasn't expecting much, so I was very pleased.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|My son recently started playing again and wanted me to try. I had forgotten everything, so this is really helping retrain me.
B0087ITBT8|2.0|For a movie billed as a comedy, I have to say I never found myself laughing. If you like more of a dramatic movie about mother/son then you will like it. If you are looking for something to pick you up then look elsewhere (both these actors have made far better and funnier movies).
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I had to read it but I enjoyed how real it was and I recommend it to everyone! Great book!
B007ZBWJXI|4.0|The first few albums that Asia put out in the 80's were three of my favorite of all time. Now, this one doesn't have the hits those had, but for the most part they are making music that hasn't been heard of in a long time. I will admit, the first time I listened to it I thought it a bit slow, but like all good music it does grow on you in time.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I simply whizzed through this book.  Talk about losing yourself in a story, that is exactly what happens. Jojo Moyes is a brillant writer.  I could not put it down.
B00C7JGDBW|4.0|For those expecting something like the original movie, you may be disappointed. However, if you like a modern movie on a classic theme then I highly recommend this one.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|What a wonderful glimpse into life of the privileged and those who served them.<br />I recommend this series to all who love history, human nature, and drama.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|This game is great, it is really good at guessing the person you are thinking of! I know that is the point of the game, but I was shocked to see just how good it was!
B0054R6BFM|3.0|I enjoyed this book very much, quick read. It was a great book to show the connections between people, and the impact it can have on people's lives.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|love the minions......  fun and entertaining for all ages.... a definite must have.  if you like the movies you'll like this game
B006XOBFTM|5.0|Some of the best reviews I've ever read on Amazon have been written about this set.  I can't really add much or say thing better than what has been said here.  However, I will say that I found the Song Of The Earth to really resonate with me.  I love the soloists, the recording quality, everything!  I much prefer it to the 1950 Decca recording.  The M1 and M2 are classics and will replace my earlier CDs of the same recordings. So the bottom line is:  Read all of these great reviews and get this box while it's available--unless you want to wait for a complete Bruno Walter set.
B0050SYS5A|4.0|Good item... no complaints with its performance.  It's been working just fine over the years, so give it a try!
B0063M22QO|5.0|Love the Mahjong game for my Kindle Fire.  It is very addicting but enjoyable.  I couldn't put it down and kept playing for a solid hour when I first got it!  I heartily recommend it if you like Mahjong....the graphics are awesome!
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|I've heard that a new Dregg is coming out soon.  I plan to see it. Onr, two, three, four & five.
B00371XIP8|4.0|The movie was awesome until the ending. There is only one part that I would change, but I won't say so that I don't spoil the movie for others.
B00957T6X6|5.0|I'm only on book 2 so far, but this series so far has been great, it was clearly written to be a TV series or film, it moves never lingers too long on one story.  Just a great read, and some times tragic and heart breaking.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|At first was not sure if I would like book but found it to be outstanding.  What an incredible read.
0061478784|4.0|OK, I read this as a Kindle buck 99 download.  I liked the story and character. It certainly pissed me off when, at 83% the story was over and I got an interview. Don't do this to us Kindle. When I buy a book and it has 398 pages, I expect the story to end on the three hundred and ninety eighth page. Thanks for allowing me the rant. Good story.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Great app, I just wish there was more puzzles to download. Other than that very relaxing, and would recommend thus to others.
B0070DOHQS|1.0|Downloaded it, wouldnt work for my phone and uninstalled right away. If there is a update to make it work I may try again.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love the series and love even more to see them all together one after the other. It is on of those series where you feel that you know each character personally.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|While the first book of the series feels the most well put together to me, the rest of the series is still readable.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|This processor is great and I am able to overclock it to almost 5GHz. I would recommend this processor to a friend.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|Alright, I was not really expecting much from this movie but I absolutely enjoyed it!  The story is a little dark, a little fun and has a lot of heart it in.  I seriously recommend this as a fun holiday film.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|The gameplay is great but sometimes the lag or server connection will cost you a round and frozen rooms aren't unheard of. But when it works its a great game.
B0020PJJHS|4.0|What can I say? A quintessential Bond movie with the fabulous Pierce Brosnan. It has guns, girls and explosions so pick it up if that's what you're in the mood for tonight.
B00CXX8KTA|5.0|Wasn't sure what I expected, but this certainly hit the spot. Admitedly, I am a huge Thin Lizzy/Phil Lynott fan and couldn't wait to get this. Honestly, it was well worth the wait. The band, not wanting to cut into the Phil lynott/Thin Lizzy legacy decided to go with a new name when they decided to release new material. I think they just started the Black Star Riders legacy, though. So many of the tracks here bring back memories of Thin Lizzy and seem as though they could be new Thin Lizzy tracks, but this is all Black Star Riders. Scott Gorham and company are in full form and are rocking until the sun comes up. Whether you are a Thin Lizzy fan, a hard rock fan, or just like great music, it is hard to go wrong with All Hell Breaks Loose. Do your ears and brain a favor and pick it up. Highly recommended!!! Definitely one of the years best.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Judge Dredd delivered exactly what I wanted from it.  It's not deep, or brooding or full of itself.  It knows what kind of film it wants to be, a gritty, hard, action explosion.  Which is more than a lot of movies are doing now a days.  Add in the fact that I didn't absolutely hate the sidekick character and you've got yourself a solid film.
B00CXL6XP0|5.0|Queensryche is back with a vengeance on this new release without original vocalist Geoff Tate. The band is seemingly trying to get back to the glory days and have an excellent sound very reminiscent of the 80's and early 90's. In my opinion, this is a breath of fresh air and shows their is life, talent, and good songwriting without Tate (never thought I would say that). The band seems to enjoy playing and being together again, which even makes them fun to listen to again. It's hard at this time to list favorite songs, since after 4 listenings I still like them all. If you're an old fan you will love it, unless you are more of a Tate fan. 9 out of 10 of my friends prefer this over the Tate release. Listen to the samples and make your choice.
B000SW2F6M|5.0|notice not a single soul show any fear except the cardinal; that thousands of men charge each other to fight to the death! who's kidding who?
B000HL2J0G|5.0|Great TV shows.  I saw it when it came out and see it again in a new time.  I love it.  It is great to see how in a modest way he can create things from thin air.  Not sure it is really applicable but sure it is based on some true ground of phiscs/biology/chemestery base.<br /><br />Fantastic.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|If you like bubbles games this one is one is a good one. Cute game when you want to relax.
B000P407K4|5.0|Manages to be relevant even today (2013), yet it criticizes the Cold War at a time when doing so would have gotten them investigated by the House Unamerican Activities Committee. Also, it's pretty hilarious.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|We started by watching reruns of Castle and are now hooked and catching up on all the shows we haven't seen before.  We bought seasons 1 - 4 and ordered the 5th season for watching in the Fall when it is released.  We watched other shows that ran opposite of Castle and will be recording one of them if they are on at the same time this fall.  Great duo -- reminds us of Bones & Booth -- teamwork, finishing each others' sentences and CHEMISTRY!!  Nice to see just how their relationship has developed and can't wait for the Fall to see what 'the proposal' brings!!
0385335989|5.0|I am in the process of re-reading this series. I love the depth of the characters and the love story.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|The crossfire series is better than 50 shades.  More realistic characters.  Only down fall is the fact that the other books in series are not available yet.
B006885EFE|5.0|Excellent performance in every day.  Roles well chosen, characters well portrayed, realistic scenes, too many accolades to print.  Highly recommended.
B00005LELD|5.0|The rubber lens hood works well and is compact. It is easy to use and folds flat so you don'y have to remove it from the lens for storage. Highly recommended.
B004YW4L5K|5.0|Neil Gaiman wrote this book as a non-American, and I think it provides a beautiful perspective on a bunch of topics, including heritage, beliefs, and living. Neil put an insane amount of work into this novel and I think it easily shows.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Downloaded to both Kindle and S3, addicted already!  Took a while to get used to, especially rolling under items as the swipe goes against your instinct.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|A horrifying tale of some of the people who have managed to escape from the poverty and cruelty of the North Korean regime.  It appears that not even the author could believe what she was hearing so spent more time than she had planned to research this book.  A must read!
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is 100,999 star's! I love this game so much that I always play it!<br />but,updates take to long.
B004OBZWHM|5.0|Writing in Feminist Legal Studies, Wessel Le Roux has contended that the book fills a void in an emerging field of interdisciplinary scholarship and will serve as a central reference point to those working in the field. He concludes \\"At her best, Mulcahy does for the history of the modern courtroom what Foucault did earlier for the history of the prison and the clinic' (p110). Elsewhere in Law and Social Inquiry, Keith Bybee has argued that this monograph offers and extraordinary range of arguments and details that flesh out the idea that communities use architecture as an alphabet to record and express their beliefs and governing ideals.  He contends that \\"Social structure is Mulcahy's Rosetta Stone: she tells us what ideas a given building expresses based on an understanding of the beliefs, practices, and mores of those who erected and used the structure.  In doing so, Mulcahy provides important guidance on how to interpret the meaning of law's fundamental physical manifestation' (p1021).
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I love this game it's just like something like subway surfers or temple in love it...... the movie was great to loved
159562015X|4.0|Good if you are working or looking to be in management.  Wish it had more to it, but alas it is for the workplace really.
B006RA0E5I|5.0|Compact.. Weight is just right..<br />Has great storage compartment for USB piece and batteries..<br />Behaves exactly as a corded laser mouse...
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|I love the CD and it was very fast coming to me.  this experience was great, wish they were all like this one
B0091REZMW|5.0|I've only just started playing but there is a lot to learn and do. I had one issue on my Kindle Fire - sometimes the music would keep playing after I exited the app. This looks like it will be a favorire for a long time.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Let me start by saying that this game is great. The only complaint I have is that glitches often occur that make gameplay difficult. Charms become worthless. Skills will suddenly disappear, making your main attack your only attack. Enemies may stop attacking you, or even appearing in the first place. If they fix these glitches, then I would give it a perfect 5 stars.
B0035Q4AFC|5.0|He is such a talented actor...and this role brings out all his gifts.<br />Wonderful insight to a complex character who gave more to the film industry<br />than many realize. Great story, superb acting!
B0088OINTU|5.0|Epic in scope and superbly acted and directed. Lawrence of Arabia comes as close to perfection as is seemingly possible. The historical basis for much the problems of our present day world are clearly portrayed.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|This is a great series!!  Not for children!!!  Now I might have to read the books.  Husband says they are so much better and detailed!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I would highly recommend this app, if you want just soft background noise to study with, or as stated for meditation.  GREAT
0345803493|4.0|Nothing short from the first book that I read of this series...l can' t wait to read the entire series, I highly doubt that I'll be disappointed.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|I was looking for a setup that included a case as I tired of damaging headsets that I leave on a seat or in my pocket.  This is great and the magnetic charge is perfect in that you just set it in the case and the two magnets grab.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|App has quit working twice. Also, don't know if it's my phone or the app that changed the widget after an update, but I really preferred the old one.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I have definitely enjoyed Vince Flynn's Mitch Rapp series - well worth the read.... Buy it, enjoy it sitting on the edge of your seat...
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Have read  this wonderful story twice now each time having trouble putting it down. Can't wait for the final story to unfold.
B00CDV6WDS|2.0|On several of the boards, when you hit tiles in the upper left hand corner, the game will shut down.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Okay...I'll start by saying something simple&hellip;THIS.IS.THE.BEST.APP.EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Me and my dad are Star Wars FREAKS! When we saw this app, we were like, &quot; OMG OMG OMG DADDDDDD!!!!!!!&quot; so, as you van see, I give this app 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001 stars.
1455527475|4.0|I believe the retail value of the book was about $30 which I would never pay but the price on here plus shipping I think was about $6 cant go wrong. book is ok. a little more fiction than reality. some of the stories are over dramatized but its a great bed stand book .
B004I2K4DY|5.0|This all-star cast, led by the indescribable Alfie Boe, takes the timeless beauty of this masterpiece to an all new level! Am I gushing, you betcha! The only negative is the performance of Nick Jonas - while he may be a pop sensation and a nice person, he is completely mismatched in his vocal capabilities with the rest of the cast. I loved at the end when Alfie Boe, Colm Wilkinson, Simon Bowman and John Owen-Jones sang the Val Jean quartet of &#34;Bring Him Home&#34; -  I have now watched the performance many times and still get chills! I have recommended and gifted this DVD to several people.
0312570740|3.0|cant complain on getting a book that retails for $30.00 for $6 delivered. amazon is great for books they shold stick with this model and not try to rule the universe.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Freely is very user friendly and allows me to quickly skim through all the blog posts I subscribe to. The layout is great and is much better than my old blog reader. Freely is the perfect replacement for Google reader.
B008XKSW7M|3.0|Sometimes you need a movie that you can watch without really having to think too much, so this was that kind of movie.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I absolutely love this game. It is easy to learn, and it is FREEEE! I love it also because it doesn't need WIFI, so I can play it on the go!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|The historical information and the story line in this novel are excellent. It was a book I did not want to stop reading.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Really good season for The Good Wife! Funny, sad, thrilling, interesting, and dramatic. Especially like the last episode. Would highly recommend...
B00DEG4Z1W|3.0|Just not enough choices for models and not easy to work with. But it is still fun to play. It's just okay.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I have enjoyed using the app until their recent update.  Now,  don't like the design or operating features, and, ads are everywhere. Too bad!
B000QRIGLC|4.0|it started slow.  basic training and hell week.  i know i could never make it to the end but after reading about it several times you kinda know  how it will end.  HOWEVER when it started into the mission and what those brave men did and what they had to go threw  could not put it down.  GOD BLESS THE SEALS
B009NQZVKG|5.0|Wow! Another wonderfully frentic ride with James Rollins into incredible new territory. Couldn't put it down, between my Kindle, iPhone & iPad it was always with me!  Thank you for an excellent read which has sent me exploring...
B004SOR4H6|1.0|At first everything was perfect and I was getting new followers and following them back, I could see who retweeted or favorited my tweets. But suddenly that changed. I wasn't able to see who followed, rted, or faved. It only showed me when people mentioned my name. Then recently I wanted to deactivate an account, and even on the help center I wasn't able to do it. My timeline sometimes messes up to where when I scroll down my finger will drag tweets with it and cover other ones so I cant read them. I think the only thong I like about this app is that it allows me to post pictures..
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|thought the movie was good and I liked it. hope they make another cause I might just purchase it maybe.
B00BSWMITK|5.0|I was turned on to Joe Satriani from my dad with Extremist. Wow, that was the first time I'd heard anything like that. Over the years he's put out great albums but this one I just can't stop listening to. Great job Joe!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Fun and entertaining but I still miss handling the cards.  Like the option of knowing you CAN win each time.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|Fun little game here that's worth the purchase.  Provides a lot of fun play.  Character faces are interesting although one is a little scary (the monkey/wolf man) my daughter just won't play with that one.  But I like that the faces are different - and even a little quirky - not perfect little Barbie or Ken faces.  Toca did a good job on this one.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Clean Master is a great cleaner. My Kindle was slow and would freeze during certain games. I would also get apps that would download without me doing anything and install themselves and I would get a message saying app installed and a lot of ads. After running a complete clean up it now starts up faster, no ads and I haven't experienced any apps installing on their own.
1451695195|5.0|I read this book in one night - it was so interesting that I had to finish it.  I'm glad the gentlemen shared his story with the world.
B004SIMNF0|5.0|Your camera will be secure at your hip. Quick access and no straps getting in the way. Easy recommend from me
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love this series! Is so easy to fall in love with the characters. Could not believe that it was over. Season 4needs to come out soon!!!
0770437400|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It was written in a different style which I found kept me looking for opportunities to keep picking up my book to read more.  I'm glad however that I read the book first prior to seeing the movie.  Second, I'm glad that I read the reviews about the movie version and knew before going that the movie wasn't going to adhere to the book.  Had I not done so, I would've probably really crucified the movie for not following the book.  It's too bad that the movie producers and directors couldn't find a way to follow the book better because without any spoilers, I feel that the content in the book would've been great to see on the big screen and I think this book could've been adapted better for a movie.  If you like books about apocalyptic scenarios and/or zombies then this one's a must read.
1781162646|4.0|Don't be fooled by the cover, Joyland isn't exactly a hard case crime story. There aren't many twist and turns to this mystery/ghost story. The book is a coming of age tale. What Stephen King does with the characters he does very well. Once again he shows that he's a master at creating and shaping characters. The three college kids the story focuses on in the first half are very reminiscent of Harry Potter and his friends (Ron and Hermione, duh!). But the story isn't really about them, their relationship, or them solving some kind of mystery together.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />The writing itself is excellent, the plot unfolded with a little too much convenience for my taste. I didn't love it, but I did like it. A good summer read.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Its a great addictive game that both my kids and I love and share... Definitely recommend this game!!! Awesome game!
B003DO13OM|5.0|I hadn't heard this in many years, and when I listened, I cried--in a good way! So beautiful!  It came safe and sound and about 5 days earlier than expected which was excellent!
B0064X7FVE|3.0|Seems to be a good app, no problems that I've noticed. Convenient and up to date with the weather. I just read some of the previous reviews and noticed one user was complaining about the battery usage. It makes me wonder if that is why my Kindle doesn't hold a charge??
B008220BLG|5.0|Zombies. Romance. Action. Comedy. Not to much blood and gore and a little like Romeo and Juliet. Over all a great movie
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game was the greatest, but after a while ads started popping up constantly. I still like the game, and I will continue to play it. It's just kind of annoying after a while.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Love the new updated app, and as always, up to the Weather Channel's usual high standards for accuracy and up-to-the-minute weather conditions and forecasting.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|great game. a bit hard for young kids. fluffy unicorn mini game is cute. its so fluffy. load times are kinds long for me.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I like this game..it is soo realistic and the horses are so real.It is based off of what happens in the real world and I like it.
B002NANLCE|5.0|After watching the series on TV I found out about this book.<br />Off course there are differences compared to the serie, but they didn't bother me.<br />Great read!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a great game. good graphics and very entertaining to play. The game is addicting to play. I recommended to  play
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Haven't seen another game like it. VERY entertaining. Possibly addictive. Well worth the 2 bucks.  I was not disappointed with this one.
B008Y78M60|4.0|The acting is stiff at times, and not all the plot twists and turns are credible, but it's a well-done film with an important theme.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|Even though this movie was PG, my 6 year old and 4 year old both enjoyed it. I too liked it.
B0040T7B2W|4.0|This past weekend I had the good fortune of seeing Belle and Sebastian live in concert for the first time ever (more on that later), so I just had to relisten to their most recent album before the show.<br /><br />\\"Write About love\\" (11 tacks; 43 min.) finds the Glasgow band on completely familiar territory as soon as the album opens with \\"I Didn't See it Coming\\" (with Sarah on lead vocals). \\"I Want the World to Stop\\" is a lovely up-tempo song. The title track is another hard(er)-charging tune. \\"I'm Not Living in the Real World\\" finds the band almost exuberant, and is one of my favorite tunes on here. But honestly, if you know and like Belle and Sebastian, this album will go down very easily like a smoothie. Almost 20 years into their long and rewarding career, the band simply continues its winning ways.<br /><br />As to the show, lead singer Stuart Murdoch commented that this was the band's first show ever in Cincinnati. He was in great spirits all evening, cracking a lot of funny observations. The band played an incredibly varied set, with just two songs from \\"Write About Love\\" (\\"I Want the World to Stop\\" and \\"I'm Not Living in the Real World\\", and actually three songs from \\"The Life Pursuit\\", but also going back as early as \\"If You're Feeling Sinister\\". In all, theirs was a much enjoyable and entertaining set (cut short a few minutes due to pending thunderstorms). Meanwhile, \\"Write About Love\\" is a nice addition to the ever-growing and rich catalog of Belle and Sebastian.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|Possibly the best movie I've ever seen.  Several interconnected, interwoven stories spanning thousands of years which very subtly draws a picture of our interconnectedness and interdependence, of the consequences of our actions.  It is a very rich and multifaceted story with many of the actors playing several roles of both genders and doing so seamlessly with brilliant restraint and understatement.  The film will make you want to see it again.  I have seen it three times and would love multiple additional viewings.  Perfectly balanced presentation of drama, comedy and action.
B00933JL0A|5.0|Of course it's silly -it's a game. But quite well done. The minute townsmen are very adept at their little tasks, such as the guy in the grape vat, smashing grapes with his feet, including the accompanying squishing sounds. He then jumps out and attends the grape vines, gathering more grapes. They express anger when out of supplies or when their stocks are over full. Very cute. The various scenarios give goals to accomplish, so there is something to work towards, thereby keeping the interest going. Well done.
B00C4YZ12C|4.0|I think my favorite part of this game is the infinite restarts. Die and you can start over and over and over. You do start out brand new and underpowered and at later levels that's a real detriment but it's still nice not to have to go all the way back to the beginning each and every time you die. Levels are reasonably well designed. Enemies aren't supermen that you can't defeat. Powerups that fall from things you shoot are random and hit or miss. Nowhere near enough health boosts fall from the sky. Enjoyable game.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Character studies in this book are incredible. Each having their own flaws and each their own story within. Best book in a long time.
B00AK57N00|3.0|I don't play this often. There's not really enough TO the game to make playing it all the time worthwhile but when you've only got a couple minutes and don't want to get involved in something more detailed than this swing and land on the target game with changing wind, gravity target size and height is perfect for filling those few minutes you've got nothing to do in.
B00CVNLK3K|5.0|Ottaviani shows how Feynman worked to make his ideas, and physics in general, more accessible. This is a great primer on the man, but also on his way of looking at the world. The notes at the back of the book are a useful reference. I'm going to add this to my school's library collection.
B006N0YWGY|1.0|It's a race game but you have no control over the throttle. The airboats slip and slide all over the place and are insanely hard to control. Making it worse is the game designer deciding you need to play with the throttle full open all the time. The only way to slow down is by crashing into things. Oh, and your boat takes no damage from any crash. This game is garbage. Look elsewhere for evertainment.
1400069289|3.0|Duhigg uses the rubric of \\"habits\\" to bring together somewhat disparate topics including the neurological roots of behavior, management and organizational theory, marketing and advertising, and social movements. Most of the anecdotes were interesting, and the writing is polished and easily leads from one topic to another. This is not a self-help book, although there is an appendix that contains some advice on identifying the cues, routines, and rewards that make up your habit behavior loops, and on substituting one routine for another one. (Duhigg does warn that changing habits is not as simple as a short flow-chart might make it look.)<br /><br />This is a good book with generally engaging content. On the other hand, only a few of the insights feel genuinely fresh; most are borrowed and repackaged from other sources. It probably deserves 3.5 stars, but I ultimately didn't find it compelling enough to round up to 4 stars.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|The game is fun but it's not awesome................................................................................................................................................................................other rates can fill in the blank because I don't know what else to data say lol and makers of the game you did a good job on this game oh and I'm 10year old not 13year
B00CWY76CC|5.0|its really quite fun always thinking and finding different items making them work to make it out of the room.  Keep them coming.  Thanks
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|A fun game that is kicking my butt!  It's fun though! How can you not love a game with Minions??
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game.I'd play its full day of I was able to anyone.This game is free so it's able for anyone. Enjoy this game. It's free... shhhhhhh
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I liked this book as well as the prequel however each book was a bit costly. Good read, although you wonder constantly if the couple can make it with all their drama.
B00C061I3K|5.0|When I heard an interview about this record I knew I had to have it.  I was not disappointed in any of the music.  The disco related music is how I would imagine disco to be if it were created today. Still very much disco, but in a decidedly Daft Punk way.  Good job!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a fun game that keeps me laughing as you make your minion run through different challenges.  It is fun to do things from the minions point of view.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|This app is perfect! Instead if hoarding a million notebooks in my desk, I have them all on my kindle! I totally recommend this app for everyone!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I'm excited to see where this goes next. Thanks Amazon, for giving new talent a place to shine. This book was recommended by a friend, and he was right. Just good storytelling.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|This is a great addition to any tablet. The game runs smooth and graphics are awesome. It is great for beginners and experienced players. I got the game and was so impressed I paid for the full version before I completed the tutorial. The only down fall is 1.2 Gb download, but this should be expected with the graphics and card base.
B002SSUQFG|4.0|Watch is small and has a very thin band. That is not a bad thing though! After an hour it's like you don't even have a watch on! Keeps accurate time and the movement is very high quality for the price! Overall a great watch! Only down side is it is not very water resistant. Luminous hands work great too!
B0091REZMW|1.0|My first free application, which I new would have ads and such, but was unaware of the trend to make you purchase items just to continue to play.  Immediately removed the application.  I will only look for the ones that cost initial money and don't surprise you with constant requests for more money.  What a joke.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|I have used up my vacation time, medical leave and all personal time off.  I am now paying others for their time off so I don't get fired for absenteeism.  My family thinks I am dead.  If it were not for home delivery of Chinese (top ramen) I would be dead.  In fact I haven't had a normal bowel movement in weeks.  Caveat Emptor.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|So far I am getting use to using my new tablet, this is my first tablet outside of work, it this works for me I will be purchasing another for wife and daughter
B00D3XAA4M|3.0|This book is basically a list of bullet points. It would be helpful if they added a bit more detail to each experience.
B00632HWOG|5.0|now I can view my mail real easy, and on the go with my laptop, with font large than what's on my phone. phones are nice but too small to read at times
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I liked the old version a little better because it was easier to navigate. I like the background and the graphics on this one.
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|Often seems like you die a lot, but maybe it's 'cause I'm bad at it. There is gas peddle and a brake peddle. You have to have gas there is a refill every once in a while. Good luck with the game!
B008602KQI|5.0|Not as good as the book but that's a given, I still think the movie is great! Have a watch
B00821PCJS|5.0|I did not start watching this with high expectations.  Considering this was a TV show not a movie the special effects were surprisingly good.  The story had many predictable points but was still very enjoyable.
B0002ZDVEU|5.0|This movie is one both my husband and I can enjoy.<br />It has action, suspense and a human interest aspect.<br />I have recommended it to several friends.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is a great show....started watching from season 1 a couple weeks ago and now into Season 3.  Amazon prime works great....I watch on my iPad with minimal buffering.<br /><br />Great product and definitely worth having the Prime membership.
B002436WJE|5.0|This movie is one both my husband and I can enjoy.<br />It has action, suspense and a human interest aspect.<br />I have recommended it to several friends.
B009VMN3RA|2.0|I was dissapointed with this book. I feel for Sachi, for all the pain she is carrying, but it does not make a pleasant read at least not for me. It is not because it is negative, but because it offers no resolution, no hope.
B000VWYJ86|5.0|This movie is one both my husband and I can enjoy.<br />It has action, suspense and a human interest aspect.<br />I have recommended it to several friends.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Its so funny, good for children and adults =] i would recommend you watch it, you wont be sorry =]
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|This show is entertaining and well-written. I love the characters and the character development over the course of the 2 seasons.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|it kept my interest from the beginning. it was almost as good as fifty shades of grey. I would recommend it to other friends
B008X9Z37A|5.0|My husband wanted a simple inexpensive kindle fire he case.  This was perfect & he was happy to get it for Fathers Day.
0783225733|1.0|The movie did not work in any of my computers or DVD players.  Have tried 4 different sets.  It looks clean and functional but is not working.  Very disappointed in the product.  Unfortunately I lost the information from the seller to ask for a refund or to send it back.  I love the movie, but this dvd was no good.
B00770KR7W|5.0|We love this toy! We got it for my sons and they really think he's the bees knees! They play with it just about everyday. The quality of the toy itself is wonderful. We don't play Halo (or know much about the game) but I was doing some research for the toys (because I know McFarlane does a great job on his toys) and found these space marines.
B004LWZW4M|5.0|Love this movie.  My son and I watch it once every couple of months.  Good product and good price and value.  I recommend this movie to any parent or families.  No nightmares yet!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|What a wonderful show!!! The actors, the costumes, the scenery, the content!!! Couldn't ask for more!!!  I'm so addicted!!!  Love it!!! Thanks!!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Just a great series that is highly entertaining and intelligent without all the profanity and nudity that the majority of television has lowered itself to include on so much of today's programming.  Truly a gem!
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Works Great. Use for Ipad Mini and Iphone. No problems so far. Will buy a second one if it holds up over time.
B006AZZPCM|1.0|The app is really slow. Do not get it. It worked maybe three times then the videos wouldn't load at all.
B008XTVWHK|5.0|it was more than what i expected. I truly enjoy a good story. so thank you good sir or madam.
B007C4ZJ0S|5.0|VERY GOOD GOOD GOOD VIDEO LOVE Gina Carano IN THE VIDEO AND ALL HER MOVIES<br />Gina Carano Gina Carano AAAAAAA+++++++
B000OLGCI4|5.0|it is truly a good movie especially the funny musicals and also things about the movie you never really knew.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's nice to play because you have divergent perks and this and I think you can change your avatar so that's pretty cool
B008OM0EDO|1.0|This movie was horrible. Ite was not very funny with only a few gag lines that were shown in the commercials. Do not waste your time.
B00ABLJ5NQ|5.0|It's Neil god damn Gaiman.<br />It is not his most academic work (American Gods)<br />It is not his strongest story (Neverwhere)<br />It is not his greatest child protagonist (Graveyard Book/Coraline)<br />It is something else. Something beautiful.<br />Gaiman proves again he is purely and simply a story teller, one the likes of which we see so rarely, one that makes the world a more beautiful place.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Great series. Good actors. Very funny. Good price for what you get. I love all the Star Trek references :)
B00APYKXFS|3.0|okay, but could be better ... boring ends, it is difficult to distinguish what is on the screen at times
B00B7Y0206|5.0|instead to using this through the web its nicer when i have the app quicker and faster loading of videos
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Neil Gaiman at his Neil Gaimaniest. Fantastic novel dealing with life and time and perspective. Definitely worth the read and the wait.
0061438294|4.0|I started reading this book, and I find it very interesting. I currently work in Human Resources, and I find that this book is helpful in my career.

B0063M22QO|4.0|I am enjoying the challenge. Thank you amazon for the app. It is a simple but good mind stretcher and eye exercise.
B00CH26TL8|2.0|The title says it all. You get it for free but fail to pass a level and you have to wait 30 minutes before you can play again? UNLESS I want to pay to play again. So my ability to play a game depends on how deep my pockets go? Forget that! Just to prove them wrong and show them that they will not get any money from me, I did 6 levels on my last remaining life. After that, I play casually and do not sweat not being able to move on for the time being. I have no problem with paying to play a game (I just shelled out $30 for Skyrim and still have $50 to go for my reserved copy of AC: Black Flag) What I do have a problem with is when they advertise something as free and then shove a piecemeal pay to play option in your face when you are at your most frustrated. And no I am not talking about pay to own, you own it for free! You just have to pay to have more lives and get better items for better scores. Finally, i am not much of a score-hound but for this game you need a set amount of points to pass every level! Which you can only get if you are extremely lucky or have the money to pay for power ups!
B00AEBB9FU|4.0|In the 2009 film, Up In The Air, George Clooney portrays Ryan Bingham, a corporate downsizer who travels across the U.S. to fire people. Basically, his corporation sends him in to dismiss employees from their job, so that the employer doesn't have to. As part of his career, Ryan is constantly on the road, or more accurately, in the air for a large portion of his year. He is not close to his family, has a modest apartment that he rarely sleeps at, and has made it his personal goal to ten million frequent flyer miles.<br /><br />His simple life is threatened when his employer hires an enthusiastic, young recruit, Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick) to help cut costs. As part of her plan, Natalie wants to fire people through video conference calls, making people like Ryan obsolete. Fearful that this new thinking will bring an end to his way of life, Ryan argues that Natalie is too inexperienced to fire people, and could never understand what he does on a daily basis. To his annoyance, Ryan's boss agrees that Natalie is inexperienced and tasks Ryan with mentoring her as she accompanies him on his travels.<br /><br />As they begin their travels, we gain a deeper insight into each of the character's personal lives. Through their mismatched personalities and experiences, the two begin to form an understanding of each other. Along the way, Ryan encounters the female equivalent of himself, played by Vera Farmiga, who he quickly falls for. The film then follows Ryan as he tries to find a life for himself outside of an airport, and discover who he truly is.<br /><br />Based on the 2001 novel by Walter Kirn, Up In The Air is one of those rare movies that actually improves upon the source material. Directed by Jason Reitman (Juno), the film consistently entertains while providing thought provoking commentary on economics and the state of American's social lives. While the novel was mainly made of anecdotes about Ryan's experiences, there is a much stronger narrative arch to the film that all leads to a believable conclusion. Equally funny and intelligent, Up In The Air is a timely film that I would definitely recommend.that all leads to a believable conclusion.

B00D5O7BPU|3.0|A while ago I bought the first weaphones app and that is still a lot of fun for fire arms enthusiasts. i still play with that thing to this day and people find it odd that I can find such fun in a simple app like that. Anyways, I am very big on the history of WW2 aside from the revolutionary war, it is the most fascinating time to learn about. That being said I decided to get the WW2 Fire arms simulator and I was interested to learn about the intricacies of those firearms and how they varied to the more modern ones. However, I still have more fun with the original weaphones. If I was you, I would start there.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|My absolute favorite part of this game is the background music because it is a song I LOVED from the movie. When I heard it on this game, I didn't think it could be more perfect for the game. So relaxing and fitting to the game, I was sooooo happy when I heard it. I love the graphics because the colors are so vivid. I love the different types of coral and the cool sea creatures that mozy into my up-and-coming reef. I highly recommend this game, especially for those who adore the movie.
B003VDY7XE|5.0|From the beginning this weird mysterious town caught my attention but once I learned more with each episode each story line had me hooked! Hoping for season 4 of the troubles.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I only downloaded this for my smurfs village. I have used it to follow a few music bands. It is easy to use
B009XIXVU6|5.0|All three of his books make me feel like I am actually in Afghanistan. Lots of great characters from different stations in life demonstrate much about human nature. The interaction between the lives of these characters gave me many<br />positive affirmations about the goodness of mankind.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway sufurs is awsome i win awsome stuff and prizes<br />You should play this game to anyone who reads this
B005544V6A|5.0|I am so fond of this cast of characters.  The ensemble of actors work so well together and I make sure that I record every show so that I do not miss any.  I went back to watch this first season as I had not watched the series from the beginning.  I am hooked.
B00DEG4Z1W|4.0|I thought this game was fun but it wasn't the best game I have got. I liked the games more than most of my games.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|GREAT GAME. I can't believe it's free for Kindle Fire. You should get this if you haven't already got this.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|Fun little game for my Kindle Fire! Love flinging my monkey through the air. I like that you have to search for the diamonds, rather them being out in the open. TONS of secret spots to find!
B00BP0MJ08|5.0|We love this book and have bought several for our friends. It's much better in hard copy as the paper copy doesn't have illustrations. Great for explaining to kids.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Keep you plowing for more prizes and coins, great game for all ages! 5 stars indeed. And lots of fun.
030789701X|5.0|Is a vevry spectacular guide. Perfect price for the size of the work. Buy it if like the skyrim game. Bye.
B00AFPVPDG|4.0|It reads a bit more like a journal of sorts than a book that takes the reader by the hand and goes down this exciting road together... which is a bit of a shame, as the material is awesome.. it's a great great book, dont get me wrong, it just feels unorganized or unplanned when reading it. But it IS worth reading!
B003VANOFY|5.0|Positive<br />Works like a charm<br />Good sound<br />Wireless with long range.<br />Good head and ear fit<br /><br />Negative:<br />Seems a little easy to break
B001EOOQEM|4.0|I would love to give this album, [[ASIN:B001EOOQEM Heaven & Hell]] (H&H),a five star review.  H&H still ranks quite highly on my lifelong Top 100 Rock Album list.  However, this remastered audio CD recording deserves a 3 star review, tops.  The complete Amazon package that I purchased deserves at least four stars because of its great vaiue:  $3.99, with shipping included for Amazon Prime members, plus the AutoRip MP3 album available for instant download.<br /><br />I am, BTW, most thankful that the Sabbath-Ozzie break-up happened.  Listen to this album, Iommi, Butler and Dio sound positively energized and inspired.  Listen to Diary of a Madman and Blizzard of Ozz, but do be sure to take care to listen to the original first issue CD versions - not the ones retouched by Ozzy to remove certain musicians. Ozzy, Rhoads and Co. were also clearly on fire while recording these two Top 100 rock albums, during the same time period as H&H was recorded.  The energy infused into H&H lifts everything up and it does sound less heavy and ominous than the older Sabbath-Ozzie albums.  In the bargain, H&H rocks full tilt and really grabs the listener by the ear.  I'll Keep Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, Paranoid and Volume 4 too, but I am thrilled to have this masterpiece in my collection. Dio does sing about princes, kings, demons, witches, and other \\"D&D\\" like things, but this bothers me not in the least.  The Dio-Sabbath sound does, as another reviewer more eloquently expressed, get increasingly and progressively heavier going on to the Mob Rules and eventually the Dehumanizer albums.  The songs on Heaven and Hell still make me want to get up and boogie, almost thirty years after I was initially blown away by this album.  The AutoRip feature definitely does add good value for me.  However, this doesn't change the fact that I do view and use music for portable listening, e.g. MP3s and music played by my iPod and to some extent my car stereo, quite differently than I use music recordings when I want to listen critically.  When I want to really hear an album clearly and focus on it, particularly when feeling a CD out for the first time, I like to take the time to listen to it at home, while sitting as close to the \\"sweet spot\\" for my speakers as I can get.<br /><br />I do really wish that my original AAD CD audio recording of Heaven and Hell sounded less muddy and that I could hear RJ Dio's voice more clearly.  I am saddened by a Recording Industry that continues to apply a near-standard recording practice that robs music of dynamism and clarity, while simultaneously evincing the chagrin to complain about losing audio CD buyer market share at an ever-increasing rate.  Brickwalling causes listening fatigue for folks that listen to audio CDs, that have been recorded that way, at home - on decent 2.1 audio gear with decent drivers.  When I say \\"decent drivers\\" I mean reasonable home speakers,  e.g. even drivers as mundane as the Klipsch Reference series, or the Boston Acoustics or Definitive Technology home audio product lines.  Brickwalling a recording does nothing for MP3/iPod/Android listeners that could not be achieved, much better, by employing a portable headphone amp.<br /><br />The practice of Brickwalling DOES succeed at making the Recording Industry look short-sighted, greedy and petty.  Worse yet, it completely alienates the community of prospective, serious Audio CD purchasers.  Higher bit-rate recordings, Super-Audio CD, DVD audio, Blue ray audio... those are all gimmicks to get us to buy albums again for more money.  The real irony is that none of those gimmicks contribute even one eighth as much to the clarity, quality, dynamism, general sound quality and enjoyability of a recording as an attentive, neutral, natural sound engineering and recording effort does.  This is true for both live and studio recordings.  We are not talking about song-writing, or musicianship right now, just how the music is recorded, and mark my words, this is critical.  Well recorded music is worth MORE MONEY to me and to most of the remaining audio CD buying audience.  None of those gimmicks are required to achieve a great recording.  If you don't believe me, then listen to the original AAD CD audio recordings of Aerosmith's Toys in the Attic, Talk by Yes, Iron Maiden's Piece of Mind and Crash & Burn by Pat Travers.  Numerous more modern recordings have been properly engineered and recorded and these recordings sound great on a decent rig, reference Stealing Fire by Bruce Cockburn, Enema of the State by Blink 182 and Third Eye Blind's Blue.<br /><br />It is very possible to clean up a noisy recording and lower the noise floor, or theshold, without resorting to sound engineering practices like Brickwalling.  I just hope the Recording Industry, which still has an interested audience of serious, critical CD listeners and buyers, catches on to this fact again, before the audio CD changes from Dinosaur to fossil.  Better recordings bear more real value in the marketplace.  Leverage that, but be fair and PLEASE quit with the gimmicks and the gouging.al.

B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Great game!!! I just think it would be nice to be able to play the other games in the puzzles as well. But overall a great game.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|This is one of the best games that I've seen for Android devices in a long while. The graphics are very well done. The game play is for me is the perfect balance of challenge without being so difficult you leave overly frustrated. There are a few cases where the chimp will get stuck in a limb and won't roll back down. In this case the only way I found to get him unstuck is to restart the level.
B005EHQGTS|5.0|This is the most amazing app I ever try simply the best. I use this from my bed just the way I like hahaha
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I love this game. After the first 2 levels I thought hey I am pretty smart! I am now at level 10 and it definitely increases in difficulty, but is super fun...and addicting! Great fun.
B00BNGFGIQ|4.0|This is a very cute game. I got it for grand kids but I like it myself. It is very cute
B00C7O8MJ8|1.0|Will never match the Original Goldsmith Movie Score!!! = Period!!!<br />Like Giacchino's first Trek effort, there was not even a decent long-lasting memorable theme to it! Pathetic Effort for a Star Trek film!!!<br />JJ, go and get James Horner for the next one, will you!! Like honestly, I could have done far-far better than your weak directing effort here!!!<br />Just to let you know, my regular fee upon hollywood to direct a feature is $100 Million, but for you JJ, it is only a mere $\\"72\\" Million!! ;))<br />Peace, Brother!! :))
B009WO7NQO|4.0|I got it for my daughter and my wife also likes it. The free version was giving me problems and kept freezing up on me so I uninstalled it and got this version.It works fine for now at least. I guess the free version wets your appetite so you'll buy the program.
B00C2U6G7C|1.0|Will never match the Original Williams Movie Score!!! = Period!!!<br />Zimmers effort here did not even have a decent long-lasting memorable theme to it!<br />...Pathetic Effort for a Superman film!!!
B00CH26TL8|5.0|this game is great and you have to figure out how to get rid of all the bubbles with what few shots that they give you. The whole game is fun and enjoyable. You can even help friends out with items that are also playing
B009GEFXLC|5.0|it was a very exciting adventure!!!!!!!  i am so glad we got it. ya for all of us..amen..yall need to get it
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I like mixing different sounds together. There are so many to choose from. I would like to set it to shut off after 1-2 hrs..is that an option???  Look forward to some good night's of deep sleep.  Thanks!
B0064X7FVE|2.0|The original one was great. I was able to see hour by hour.<br />Yesterday everything changed. Less info. Can't get the map to do anything
B0088BSG40|4.0|Yes Yes At the Gate of Sethu is a great Death Metal Album but I'm just not a Nile fan I don't hate them but I'm just not into them but if you all are just get the album its good but im still not into this band all the way.<br /><br />I'd Rather Listen to Septic Flesh or Suffocation
B003O86FMW|4.0|I really enjoyed this one. The ending bomb shell I think could have been handed a bit differently, but whatever, let's get on with the third installment, shall we?
B007U8UBGI|5.0|Been trying to get into something more professional here lately and so decided to start listening to Jack White Ive been a fan for a year now but never really got into this type of music but when all else fells look for a new type of music genre cause the s*** you listen to constantly will get boring sooner or later.<br />Good album Jack Plays really well on guitar and such and is by far one of my favorite singers cause of his unique voice.<br /><br />Really great any fan or such should buy it its worth it.
B00005JKGK|5.0|My daughter and I watched movies the whole summer of 2013.  I picked this one, Ya Ya, and How to make an American quilt.  She enjoyed all of them!
B00BUT5IAC|5.0|Alice In Chains have always been a band that Ive been told to listen to and I will like but to tell you the truth I really never liked them. Just could not get into them for some reason I don't why but just couldn't, but The Devil put Dinosaurs Here is a great F'N album the songs are well played out and you just go with the flow with the guitars and such.<br /><br />yes All N All A good Album<br /><br />don't know why people hate this album so much I actually like this one.
B008K8VDPU|4.0|Good tutorial, many options available, the instrument sounds are a little wanting, but overall this is a nice app for a tablet
B00CH26TL8|4.0|Great time passer keeps your mind going as you get older it helps to have something like this to occupy your self
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I love this alarm clock because of its versatility, reliability and ease  in customizing. Everything fun this developer is well worth it.  ing
B006L9B6TI|5.0|This book reminds you of the truth of our existence and challenges you to live accordingly. It served as an important reminder to me.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|Used double sided tape to attach it to my phone case, and it works great. I was very impressed by the quality and battery life of the little thing. Works exactly how i need it to.
B00CWY76CC|2.0|It has no directions to figure out how to play it, if it does where are they, tell me where to go to get info.
B009GX69RK|5.0|This show just gets better and better with time.  I highly recommend.  I can't wait to see what the third season brings!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This is a lovely, atmospheric short novel, full of magic yet still with one foot in reality. As a fan of some of Gaiman's other works (like The Graveyard Book), I knew that I would be transported to another world. I didn't want this one to end! Highly recommended.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|We've enjoyed every single episode...wish there were more to a season! We are looking forward to season 4 next year
B002NZK5TG|5.0|THERE HASN'T BEEN AND I DOUBT THERE WILL EVER BE, ANOTHER MOVIE THAT CAN COMPARE TO THIS! THE AMAZING IMAGINATION AND MOVIE GENIUS IT TOOK, TO MAKE A &#34;TALKING PLANT MOVIE&#34;, EXCITING AND ENTERTAINING, PROPELS THIS INTO AN INSTANT CLASSIC!
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I love this game truly it is my favorite game I really and truly love this game I almost want to say it's my favorite game of all time....<br /> #awesomeness#favorite
B00CWY76CC|5.0|loved it!! really enjoyed the challenge yet it wasn't overly difficult. cant wait for the next levels to be released. very clever..hehe
B00B9366VO|5.0|It's well a put together documentary about real artist making music... I loved it.  It's  unbelievable how  many great artist made music at Sound City.  I will  be watching it again.  It's that good.  Great work.
B00B8M4IMK|4.0|It is honestly too early to write a review of this product as I've been using it only for the past few weeks or so. But i'm sure will turn into a good pick for me. In my usage so far, I'm happy to give 5 star rating.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|After putting this on my phone I had lots of problems hearing on my phone.<br />Tried it for couple days but did not work.
1401929281|3.0|It is interesting and I'm sure good for some people.  I had never heard of this before so was I was<br />interested in reading about it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love Downton Abbey.  It is a well done historical drama that keeps you interested in the characters, both the servants and the elite.  I have often been inspired to look up the actual events or situations that are in the episodes to see how accurate they are and have always been delighted by the details and handling of the historical information.
B003V4AK8E|1.0|This wireless controller size is perfect...It stays disconnected after 2 mins. of gameplay.  Tried to<br />reconnect by getting up and linking it again via the usb, stays connected for a few minutes, then the PS<br />button starts flashing as if losing the signal, stays like that, got frustrated and gave up
B0067TQQI8|5.0|Ordered one for trip across country. Perfect for charging our cell phones along with kid DSI's and tablets. Charged 2 phones fully in no time and then had juice left for the tablet. Awesome! It's also been great to use while doing long bike rides as an aid to keep connected to GPS charting / activity tracking aps (endomondo for phone) because it still enables to arrive with a fully charged phone.<br />Wish I'd bought this when we got our smart phones. I think until cell phones hold charges for days with out needing a charge, this device is a must for travel, back up for lack of outlet availability. It's fast too. Highly recommend.
B0031QVW2U|5.0|This brad is perfect when used with RS7 or RS5 (I use it with RS-7). This brad holds the position of strap in front and also provides additional support. Now I wont use my 70-200mm lens without this. Though the black rapid products are priced high, it is really worth to hand your costly lenses with these. I would recommend this to anyone with RS5 or RS7.
B0095MVOMC|2.0|This was the free app of the day so I decided to download. Why not?! It's an interesting game. But it's way too easy and short. I finished it in a couple hours. And that's because I went to bed. Maybe they need to add more levels and possibly add numbers. Even change up the location of the numbers in replay. I would have been highly disappointed if I had actually paid for the game.
B001NHZ2KM|5.0|The Who<br />The Kids are Alright (DVD)<br /><br />Having the rare Who Woodstock (1969) footage on this DVD is simply priceless.  It alone makes this a 'must have' DVD.  Yet the entire movie is fantastic from start to finish!  Every bit of it (concerts and interviews) is fascinating.<br />A solid 5 Star DVD<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000059N1T The Kids Are Alright]]<br /><br />Note: The Audio CD version has a couple of songs not in the movie
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I am fan of game of thrones books so I am seeng the HBO serie, this packages is really cool, you have DVDs Blue Ray and also a Digital Copy 1 one.<br />Nice work on boxing, presentation, and options.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|I was not sure about this cover... for my kindle it was perfect... fit perfect... looks great... feels good... I would highly recommend it...
B007Z8ZKS2|5.0|There's not much to be said about this fantastic book other than &#34;if you've never read a John Green book, this is a great one to start with. If you have, this has his imprint all over it&#34;.<br /><br />Fair warning, you will be embarking in an emotional rollercoaster, much like life itself.
B001D07Q9E|1.0|I bought a few DVDs from Amazon, this one came separately, new, nicely wrapped in plastic. However, the first time I tried to use it, it would not play, read 'ERROR.'  Tried in another DVD and same thing, would not start.  Had not anticipated this kind of problem, paid close to $19 for this, so am very disappointed.  Am contacting seller, hopefully they will be able to either replace or refund with a non-defective copy.
B0024DF9MU|4.0|Love this movie and that I could watch it instantly. Would be perfect but there were 2 or 3 little jumps when watching.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|So many negative comments I read but when I finally read the books myself, I found an enjoyable story and couldn't wait to read the next one. I like her style of writing. My childhood ambition was to become a writer. Maybe there is hope for me.
0803726570|4.0|Room on the room was cute but corny. I'd still recommend it. It's a cute idea for Halloween. Cute book! Love illustrations!
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|Was not expecting the entire musical. Presentations by Andrew Lloyd Webber at the end were spectacular.Loved every minute of dvd.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Although similar to an older running, jumping, skidding game, its still fun to play it, specially when Vector comes in !
B0063M22QO|4.0|It's another tile game. It's fun in a board game kind of way. this game has nice colors and is worth checking out.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|This book...i think the best word for it is amazing. There is so much love and hate and passion. It will make you look at the world differently. I know i am. I look at my freedom different and more appreciative. I loved every page and i want to read more.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love putting puzzles together and this app allows me to get my fix on my Kindle.<br /><br />After I complete all the puzzles I got for free, I am going to purchase more.<br /><br />Really like this app!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved this book and the rest of the series. Great read! It grabs you and doesn't let go for the entire roller coaster ride!
1476712042|5.0|This book is fantastic.  Reading this was like getting wrapped up in thier lives.  Read Walking Disaster too and fall in love.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|This game is easy to navigate and works to pass the time.  At first I wasn't to sure how enertaining it would be but it is a fairly simple game and fun.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|It is a great game and it takes focus too.I recommend it because it is fun and active.This games is worth every penny.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great app it is kind of like temple run but it is funnier and more challenging.  This is a pretty good app
B00821PCJS|4.0|I just completed the premier, which is a 2 hour one, and it is quite captivating to watch this !  The concept, alien invasion, is familiar, but it looks promising to go in some different directions!
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|This game is fun and entertaining. You&quot;'ll  never get bored.  Unless you have to wait for the nursery. And then they make you use peanuts. Well they have to make money  some how:):):):):):)
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I'm a displaced Google Reader fan that found Feedly from the many &#34;what to replace GR with&#34; articles.  Feedly always rated high, and I can see why.  Import from GR was easy, even after the end deadline, and organization is easy.  I especially like the mobile app's magazine view.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|As a parent, I could feel the characters anxiety of having a son that you so desperately want to believe in and protect. I liked the unforeseen plot twist at the end.
B0097JYVAU|4.0|Excellent narratives! The author makes some good analogies introducing the world of complex systems in an easy to read format
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It is a perfect combination of easy and challenging. It kept me thinking. Can't wait for more levels to come out.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Fun so far. Hope to improve soon! Love the minion sound effects. can't wait until my 8 year old daughter plays.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love the daily challenges and the weekly gifts. It keeps me busy when I am stressed out. Great for all ages. I'm playing this game on all my devices
0385732554|5.0|Easy read and a very interesting story. I'm not a fan a books and this one caught my attention, now I can't stop reading it. I recommend it.
B0085OEA9U|5.0|Great Movie and storyline, lots of emotion that can be related to in real life. Great job by George Clooney. Fantastic performance and work by the beautiful and amazing Anna Kendrick. Recommend this movie!
B005LAIIKI|5.0|The suspense, the soundtrack and the video quality all combine to make this an awesome movie experience. I watched it over and over again
B009IA9OLE|5.0|This was a great strategic game that kept me thinking how to &quot;outwit the game&quot;! The skills you earn during the game were critical to the last case your in and I have to say, that was a great ending. This is sooooooo worth the $3. This is the best strategy I've played on the Android market yet.<br /><br />Thanks Senri AB, great game.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I love this game. It took me a few days to catch on, but I could not stop afterword! Can&acute;t wait for more!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's a great game that almost everyone will love. If you love the movie you'll love the game. Fun for all ages!
B000LTAY1U|5.0|I love this watch and can't wait to get a new strap for it.  At first I didn't see an issue with the strap, but very quickly the holes started getting messed up from the canvas threads on the strap.  The watch works amazingly though.  I honestly think my watch is an anomaly though, because unlike most people reviewing this watch, mine is holding at about +-1 or 2 seconds every 4 days or so.  That's pretty great for an auto.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|The book was a great read as usual. I have always enjoyed reading her books. Will enjoy reading future books on Amazon.
B000NGTJTY|5.0|I've heard people say they get these two confused it was cute to keep that in mind while watching. Cleverly written.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Fast passed, believably but sometimes shocking.  All around entertaining. Is the law practice really like this?  I need a new career
B004HWYTP4|1.0|Whole concept ridiculous !  I couldn't even watch past first 15 min! It should be listed as a comedy or tongue in cheek!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Intelligent concepts, not predictable.  Every week entertaining. This lifestyle is very complicated and not for me but fun to contemplate
B00CWY76CC|5.0|LoTs of FuN! Some Clues Easy Enuf 4 My SOn While Others R More Challenging So We Play Together &amp; Luv It
B004LROUNG|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this, it was an easy read. After taking a break from Grisham for a few years, I think this was one of his best.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|fun and original. it has the characters you know and love with a boss battle of the girl scout mena and vector.
030014332X|1.0|Though well written, the title is not a good indicator of the contents. The title should be \\"A verbose history of Europe & Abrahamic faiths\\".
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This movie is great for family movie night, especially with younger kid. My kiddos love it and they re watched it several times. It worth for the money!!!
B00AB7HESI|1.0|I saw the reviews and disciption so i bought it and it wont download to my kindle i deleted loads of apps for no reason! It still wont download! Its very frustrating because I was very excited to play it! They need to fix this! If you have a kindle fire 2nd generation listen to me: DON'T GET THIS APP!!!!!!! Trust me I tried downloading it 3 times and im trying it again right now knowing it will fail. I REPEAT DON'T GET THIS APP IF YOU HAVE KINDLE FIRE 2ND GENERATION!!! I am very disappointed and angry. I was looking forward to playing this app. :'(
B00867GJYK|4.0|I was disappointed to find the menu on the Blu-ray to not have the voice-over interplay of characters that my DVD has.  It seems as usual, companies are doing the bare minimum when moving a movie to Blu-ray.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Loved this book as a teen and thought I better read it again.  Glad they are FINALLY going to make a movie of it. :)
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|Although I'm not a fan of the multiple story lines, I do understand its function.  The interplay of deeds between lives is very interesting and the multiple characters each person plays is quite fun.  I find it to have a very spiritual them that resonates with me.  It does require a certain amount of attention and intelligence to follow and understand.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. It is really the best game ever. This game is really fun for my kids. It calms my kids down. They really love to play subway surfers.
B00B7VZN76|5.0|Initially I wasn't certain that I wanted to own TNG on bluray. I own the original DVDs and have watched them exactly once so the idea of putting out money for an HD version of something that I would only watch once was not appealing to me. I was wrong. They're so worth it. The picture quality is outstanding and the presentation makes the show appear exactly how my memory says it looked.<br /><br />Buy it.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|this mouse came in really good looking packaging but the mouse itself feels cheap. yes there are many customizations with the mouse including lights, the nine macro buttons, and the weights, but the overall cheap plastic feel knocks it down 1 star.<br /><br />don't get me wrong, the mouse performs as advertised and is a good value for the price.
B0095XPZBC|5.0|Initially I wasn't certain that I wanted to own TNG on bluray.

B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I know it hasn't gotten great reviews but I still enjoyed reading entwined with you. It was hard to get into it unlike the first books but it did get better. I can't wait for the next one!
0062238868|5.0|Let me begin this review by being honest - Chris Kyle is a hero of mine, so I am slightly biased when it comes to anything he says, advises and writes. To me, this autobiography is fast-paced, well-written (OK, there are some editorial goofs, but that's on the editors), and gives a terrific eagle-eye insight into the making of a true American hero.<br /><br />The parts written by his wife are heart-wrenching and emotional, but essential in understanding what a member of our military's family goes through each day, especially as they prepare to make the ultimate sacrifice.<br /><br />Chris Kyle is now a fallen hero, and America lost one of its best examples of valor and honor when he died.<br /><br />My favorite chapters described his training to become the world's most deadliest sniper and the guns he carried and used throughout his life. I'm looking forward to the second book on the History of Guns! :)<br /><br />If you're not used to military jargon and terms, don't worry - this book doesn't get bogged down with terminology like some military books can. Yes, there are lots of acronyms, but Mr. Kyle made a point to reveal what the letters stood for often, so you don't need a cheat sheet or guide for the government terminology. Even if he repeats himself in the explanations, it's written slightly different each time, so it's not too redundant.<br /><br />If you like military history and war novels (non-fiction or fiction), pick this up for a great read into the heart and mindset of one of America's greatest heroes.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Was able to catch up on the season and get ready for the new season to watch on TV.  Love it!
B009VSW15Y|3.0|For a free product, this application is great.  In the scope of applications, it's middle of the road.  Sure, I might find certain features to have been more thoroughly developed if I were to buy the premium version, however I'm using it on a kindle, not a $1,000 DSLR.  I only needed the time delay function for vanity photos of my food to share with my friends.  Or was it something else?  I can't remember.  It served it's purpose.
B000F6IOC0|5.0|This second part of underworld was excellent I mean there are all sorts of new charactors in this movie.You first see scene of the first vampire martin when he's trying to locate his werewolf brother william and where he is betrayed.You meet william and martins father the first immortal,and how he's been cleaning up his sons mistakes messes.There are humans involved,but most of all there's lots of action and suspencein this picture.
B009O2XY12|3.0|I have this game on my iphone and am up to level 129 (Sharptooth Surf... like stage 22), but this one for my Kindle won't go above level 96 (Skullbubble Lair... like stage 16).  After over a month of trying to contact Team Lava about the problem, someone finally gets back to me and apologizes that they haven't made any levels available for the Kindle past this one.  I think that's pretty lame.  If they're available for other platforms, they should be available for all of them.
B004KA9UXO|4.0|Having been tempted to watch dune but dissuaded  by the awful reviews and even worse special effects, I thought I'd read the sci fi classic. It reads well, dispute the slow beginnings, and despit being written in the 60's the view of the technology of the future is robust enough to maintain the allusion of the story.<br />Worth a read.
B008HTQ28K|4.0|I always enjoy Grisham's books. What a complicated plot.  he must have spent ages figuring that thing out. In any event it was a great read.
0312360258|3.0|I love a good fantasy, vampire/goddesses, etc book just as much as the next person. But I'm a little disappointed to be honest in how many women in my book club recommended this series. It's great...for a teenager. The characters aren't consistent, they're whiny and annoying and just plain dumb. The make decisions that you can't help but think to yourself \\"seriously? This is so obvious a 3 yr old can figure it out!\\" Because the plot points are obvious, you pretty much know where the books will end up before you get there. And the romantic aspects are juvenile. Like I said I would have loved this back when I was in high school but as an adult I found it tedious and silly.
1781162646|5.0|After finishing George RR Martin's &#34;A Song of Ice and Fire&#34; books in a 3-month binge, I was hurting. Two books I'd tried to read after died (A Ray Bradbury and a Kim Newman book) on the table. When Joyland arrived, I knew S.K. would be able to bring me back to center.<br /><br />Joyland was fantastic. Much like &#34;The Colorado Kid,&#34; it's a far more subdued presentation of the supernatural, and instead more a story about a crime and how it's affected someone else.<br /><br />The read is quick, you really enjoy the characters, and there are flashes of the Stephen King we know and love. And, if you're hung up on something (like, say, a fantastic series of deeply-intertwined stories), it's a great palate cleanser.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I'm hooked. I enjoy the story lines, the juxtaposition from upstairs and downstairs. I'll keep watching no matter who they kill off.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|I am on this app all the time because its so fun.Even though I got it yesterday I have alredey fallen unloved with this app.I think you will love it to I bet if your looking at getting this app.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|great show, I had recorded it on the fourth of July weekend but this one episode did not record well and I HAD to see it.
B008OOYALE|5.0|This app is very fun and very addictive. I downloaded it not knowing what it as and turns out it is the most played app on my device!
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|Super cute graphics, very fun, challenging but not impossible, and increasingly more difficult as levels go up. Great game for all ages. Highly recommend this game! Very addicting! :-)
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|American horror story has really developed as a series in season two.  I love that most of my favorite characters have returned and this season still has the same vibe as the last which makes it all that more enjoyable.  Can't wait for season three! I strongly recommend this series to anyone who loves a little bit of lust a whole lot of evil and cute serial killers!
006224454X|2.0|S.J. Watson's debut novel is a puzzler, seemingly more clever than it was interesting, more well-written than it was entertaining. It was a frustrating book about a frustrating subject. After scrounging the interwebs I realize that I am in a minority on not liking this book, but that's okay. London academic Christine had an accident twenty plus years ago and wakes up and sees a lady twenty years older than herself in the mirror and a strange man in her bed. Each morning her husband has to explain to her who she is, about her brain injury, and what her life has become. This has the potential to become a bit GROUNDHOG DAY with fewer characters, however, she discovers that she has been keeping a journal, so any information she learns or remembers during the day she has access to the next day, although she has to read the increasingly-lengthy journal each day to remember. Because there are so few characters the twist is never far from your thoughts. I think for me it's just a personal thing, I have never enjoyed amnesia stories or wrong man stories, and this is definitely the former. However, this book is quite popular with both the literate and blockbuster crowd, so if this kind of suspense novel intrigues you then by all means pick it up! Soon to be a major motion picture with Nicole Kidman and Mark Strong.
0399159347|3.0|I enjoyed What Alice Forgot by this author very much and recommended it to many people as \\"a really good read\\". This new book by Liane Moriarty is ok, but not good enough that I'd push it on others.<br />I saved it to read on a 6 hr plane journey and it worked well for that. I didn't have any other book with me so had no option but to continue with it but It took too long to get started for me and I thought the \\" secret\\" was pretty obvious from very early on. Luckily after page 220 it started to flow well and I read the last 150 ish pages very quickly but all in all not a memorable read.
0062255657|4.0|This book was very easy to get through, being both short and well written. As usual, Gaiman's tale is very creative and a bit weird. The story was both enchanting and, at times, slightly horrifying. In my opinion it is a good read for both adults and youth.
B0018PH3L0|5.0|Excellent movie with excellent actor's for the adventure and classic means of doing a move up north for a Great Life and making a life in the old day's of the Western Era of the United State's and hardship's that followed in every means of life. :)  Great to have if you love Western Films.  So happy to have it in my DVD Collection.
0316044695|5.0|This book is great...at times a tear jerker, but that is a sign of a great book.  Marcus has more courage than I could ever imagine having.  He is a true hero and so are the others that were lost in the battle.
B00425S1H8|5.0|simple install in Windows 7 using the supplied drivers. Worked flwawlessly the first time and supports 38.4 kbps without isssue
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Very simple, useful application. I can tell how many hours of browsing, standby, etc. are left at a glance, and I like the streamlined design. Look no further.
B009HUB40Y|4.0|I really enjoy this game, more than I thought I would. I did have to uninstall though as after a while I got ads that wouldn't load and eventually crashed the game. Still, reinstalled and its working again at the moment.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|nice graphics. sometime will not load on kindle fire. not too many ads pop up. my 7yo loves horses and time on the game.
B002GNDXY4|4.0|I watched this with my 13 year old niece.  She loves it.  It is a great drama for her age group. Good character and relationship development. There is just enough action to keep it exciting.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|I have been just slightly obsessed with this show for years and I thought I would never want it to end. But, like all good things, there comes a time when it SHOULD end before you start hating all of the characters and wishing they would be systematically killed off by a brand new serial killer... just kidding!<br /><br />I thought Season 7 did a good job preparing us all for the upcoming last season of the show. Halfway through Season 7 I found myself irritated with Dexter's stupid choices. In fact, by the second episode I was hoping he would kill off Deborah. I'm looking forward to the writers wrapping up this stunning series. It's finally time... tonight's the night.
B00BUCW54Q|5.0|I have watched this movie about three times within the first week that I purchased it! I'm a huge fan of Tom Cruise and this movie and his acting did not let me down! He is outstanding with this character, and I sat on the edge of my seat all the way thru the movie! It was money well spent!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|It is fun to play but the coins go by so quickly and you have to wait for more coins.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Casual banter while dislocating someones shoulder actually made my wife laugh out loud. Go figure.  She usually cringes during fight scenes.  I don't know what it is about the chemistry of this cast that makes Red so enjoyable, but we both liked it.<br />s.b.
B000002LFZ|5.0|I ordered this after seeing Fleetwood Mac last week...Damn the concert was amazing..so I<br />wanted to listen to some &#34;real music&#34; again and this hit the spot! It &#34;almost&#34; makes sitting in<br />Traffic worth while!
B00BNGFGIQ|1.0|Not only was I not amused by this game, but my 3yr old wasn't either! It wasn't worth the time it took to download.
B00DF0POXA|5.0|This is my first time to listen to Kanye West and I am finding his music endlessly fascinating and intriguing.
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|This movie became to be No.1 in my collection.<br /><br />I respect to make this great movie and &#34;real&#34; to have done these jobs.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Yes some thing's a bit off about the writing, grammar etc.. but it's most definitely something you can overlook... love it!
B00AAX68HG|5.0|I was really upset that I couldn't get cut the rope but then I saw this. It's fun, challenging,and cute!! I would recommend it for all ages!!^_^  ^-^  ^=^
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I loved this game and I can't wait for more rooms. hope its soon. will definitely recommend to my friends.
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|The chemistry of the characters works. The Doctor, Amy and Rory have strengths and weaknesses, but as a team they are unbeatable. I wish they could have stayed longer.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This app is very easy to use &amp; provides a substantial number of ambient sounds for sleeping, rest time or background noise. I love that I can adjust the volume of each individual sound, and the timer function is wonderful fading into silence at the set time.  Great app!
1402770006|5.0|This is a very detailed graphic comic !! Goes in to more details than the B+W movies !! A must for any Sherlock fan !!
B0056TYT66|3.0|As advertised, but does not work with Win7/8 for Raid Striping.  I really wanted to raid my SSD's but it wouldn't let me.  Disappointed with that, but does support my SATA drives.
B00AKOB7CG|5.0|For those of who travel a lot !! This is a great app, to get a great workout with !! Even shows you how each excerise is done !! Check it out, please !!
B0034G4OYA|5.0|Bought for a long car trip, perfect condition! Arrived early and my daughter is thrilled! Didn't want blu-ray, so it would play in our portable dvd player.
B00AQSN7HE|5.0|Daniel Craig is IT, best of the Bonds. After seeing him for the first time in Skyfall at the theater, I had to purchase his two earlier Bond movies so I would have all three that he has starred in. Although prior Bond actors were sensational in their own right, Craig far exceeds their derring-do.
0547848412|5.0|i saw the movie but there's nothing like read the book i love it and really recommend get this book
B007REV4T8|5.0|I viewed this at the theater, which only whet my appetite to view Craig's two earlier Bond movies, Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace. Marvelous....
B0072OFOM6|5.0|it was a great deal and I love it great menu and the quantity on the audio and video is great
B001PPLIEG|5.0|I do not expect to tire of watching Daniel Craig as Bond. After viewing the movie on TV, I HAD TO HAVE the DVD to watch in the future.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I have read and reread the book several times.  Each time I enjoy it more.  Great work! I recommend it wholeheartedly.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|It tells such an incredible story about this muscian .  Everyone will like this.  I had never heard of it until a friend told me about it.  After watching it,  I told another friend and they also were impressed.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|If you like temple run, get this, this game is really fun!<br />You can do everything on this game!<br />Try it!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Typical Angry Birds but the monkeys made me laugh out loud, great fun. Watch out fir the ruddy banana palms!
B001HBYHFA|5.0|I had never seen the series, nor did I even know of one before seeing this movie. I did not find it confusing to say the least in those respects. The plot is easy enough to follow and I found the acting to be good, for my taste. Bought a copy &#34;To Have...&#34;  Old cartoon fans may understand this reference. Conceptually might be a little violent for young viewers, but a lot is not shown, but inferred.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|Quirky and more difficult than you would think, very entertaining though.<br />Good graphics, need to think a bit harder to defeat the piggies!!
B009CG29RK|5.0|A very funny & very sweet movie. A definite keeper ! I would recommend this movie for both adults and children.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|This is the best thing on. I love it and can not wait for season 4. I hope that everyone get a chance to see this show.
B003JH8LPW|4.0|I have read all the Langdon books, and love them, so I thought I would try this older Dan Brown book.  It was enjoyable, and, as all his other books have been, well researched and engaging.  The surprise twist at the end was a shock,  however,  the boom came to a very abrupt end, and I felt we were left hanging a little.<br /><br />Otherwise, I enjoyed this easy, weekend read.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|need to show hints, don't know whether it's working correctly when no item is available to choose, or I'm just missing the item.
B005C8ENI0|4.0|We really enjoyed the movie, especially since it is based on a Grishom novel. There were some great twists but in the end we don't know who the real killer was or if it was a team. Now we'll have to read the novel. Not a bad thing, just a necessity now. Enjoy!
B00CTEP7O4|4.0|I like this show a lot, but it follows many of the USA channel ideas used for everything. Slick mentor, evil mentor to slick mentor, naughty best friend, romantic interest, etc. it's a great show to watch while you cook or clean or walk in and out of the room. The plot twists are cool, but aren't necessary to catch to follow along. I'm usually dinking on my phone whole watching it.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The beginning started boring the middle was good the end kinda flopped but overall ok. A read if you need something to move onto but not a total page turner
B00AREIAI8|4.0|its ok,  i 'd rate it a five if buying new horses didn't  cost so many damn gems, but hey its free
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I really enjoy watching this show. The character development is great and the acting is amazing. The first two seasons were great I had to catch up on the third. So far it's been well worth the purchase and even better without commercial interruptions.
B00BY8DIT2|5.0|This CD rocks with Beth and Joe at their bests redoing some of the old great rockin' blues.  This duo puts their souls into their work and have a great back-up group of musicians, great producers and recording studio.  I'm almost 70 and had Nut Bush City Limit cranked up on my stereo - Have you ever heard a bumble bee growl? that's what part of Bonamassa's guitar work on that piece made me think of the house was shakin!!
0385342039|5.0|The book came extremely quick, and was in excellent condition.  It made it more affordable to purchase this way than from a regular store.  Anyway I can save money is a good thing.
B00DHNBY02|3.0|Nothing new here. There are some creepy effects. Lots of gore and standard renting of flesh. If you like this genre, you will probably enjoy. If you aren't a fan and are looking for a comedy like the original, don't bother.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's a great,fun game for kids ages 14 and under great app and the best part is its free it's pretty much like Temple Run
B000LB4DWO|3.0|This movie was a &#34;nothing to watch&#34; pick so I didn't have high expectations. This retelling of the Superman legend is watchable. Sometimes pretty good and also kind of dull in stretches. If you have nothing else to watch, it isn't a total waste. If you are a superman fan, it is one small step above the Chris Reeve movies.
B001L5U15M|2.0|Well, it does what it is supposed to do--it keeps your cameras and lenses safe--even through somewhat of a tumble.<br /><br />Most people that don't give favorable reviews site the ergonomics and the awkwardness of the shoulder strap.  I'm no exception, it's disappointing and uncomfortable.  No adjustment for the padding and it really only affords you one position to carry it.  Try getting on a plane with it, you'll choke!  lol<br /><br />I have had bags with weird straps, and have made do, but the ONE thing that I absolutely cannot stand and makes me HATE this bag is that you only have access to your top level of lenses when you reach in the top.  Have you ever tried to juggle a camera body, a thick 105mm lens and pry loose a velcro piece to get to your desired lens?  Trust me, you don't want to.  The main users of this bag seem to have two cameras that they like to carry with their lenses mounted, and maybe a back up lens.  If that's the case, this bag might be perfect for you, but if you are thinking \\"oh, a (relatively) cheap Tamrac carry system yay!\\" you could find yourself disappointed.<br /><br />Yes, I know, I know... buyer beware.  The cut-a-way diagram is somewhat misleading, but still... I should have known.  Look at the pictures carefully, there is only one way into this bag, and it's through the top.  Keep that in mind.
B008Y727AW|5.0|This movie is unique in many ways. Number 1 - the animation and effects are seamless, clever and always enhance the story. Number 2 - Silly and funny as this movie is, there is a compelling back story.. Number 3 - Chinese director Chow has delivered a great comedy. This movie is a laugh a minute. I highly recommend it. It is in Chinese though and you must read subtitles. I had to read it to my 4 year old grandson.. But, even then, he loved it. Truly for children of ALL ages.
B00D2K40WY|4.0|this is a great app my only problem is that it is a little repetitive and you have to pay to unlock all the dresses and makeup etc etc other than that it is an awesome game that I love to play.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Everytime you touch the app keeps changing pages and then have to start over again. They should have left it alone!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I really like this game but it won't let me connect to facebook. Maybe it's just a bug? In which case I hope it gets fixed.
B005544TRQ|4.0|I don't know why I like it, after all it's just another show about lawyers.  I'll continue watching to try to figure it out.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|If u want to have something to do get this app is so fun you won't get bored it supplies you with something to do all the time I love this app
B00B2166BS|5.0|Cable is long, cable is quality, stays on really good (regardless of what others are saying). Charging speed are great too.<br /><br />Only downside is that it is not fitting with my current case, but this is not due to the cable.
B00CB4ET0K|4.0|Jus wish it would let you move more freely. And that you could buy weapons easier<br />It would make the game.e a lot better
B00CWY76CC|5.0|There is only one problem with this game.....I want MORE! It really makes you Think...some levels are much easier than others. But overall I really like this game.
B009GXHOW4|5.0|This app is awesome i love it and i highly recommend getting it!!!! Also Its amazing how it automatically synchronizes, if that's the right word,with Minecraft PE!!!!!! Amazing job
1422188612|5.0|thanks Michael - this is a great body of work and your HBR articles very valuable too...excellent read...recommend this book.
3836538725|5.0|This is a must book for any photography enthusiast. In adddition to beautiful images, the quality of the book itself is fantastic.
0425263991|5.0|I was surprised by this one.  I had long awaited to see these two names in a book and was not disappointed when they came together.  I read it cover to cover in one sitting.
B004OZOTSQ|4.0|It does indeed work well on my 1st gen Kindle Fire for file transfer, but especially if you are new to the Android OS, be sure to read R. Wilson's \\"most helpful\\" critical review and the developer's comments that come with it so that you exit from the app properly. By design it starts serving as soon as you click on the app, quits with the back button or the \\"exit\\" command from the menu and continues in the background if you hit the home button. If you want to make sure your device isn't still serving, refresh the browser page that accesses your device to make sure the app isn't still running.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It's a tale that reminds you how tough life was particularly for women. It's a story of love and loyalty of - spouse, family, friends, staff. It reveals that wealth or titles didn't necessarily mean a life of luxury but also the weight of responsibility to the servants and tenants of the lands. Wonderful viewing.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Good story, with lots of twists, great lines and action. Love the characters and can't wait for the release of Red 2.
B001UGB1X8|4.0|Tommy Lee Jones playing the kind of role that he always gets spot on. If you liked US Marshals or Fugitive...
B00A6N8F4Y|5.0|Hold on for the ride... twist and turns, along with a strong empathy for the main characters and you've got a great movie!
B005OCHOZS|4.0|Loved Born to Run, this was a great follow up. Tried the lentil burgers last night, good, just a tad soft inside (like refried beans), but really good flavor. Will try a thinner one tonight. Can't wait for cool weather to try the chili! But it was really a fun, stimulating read. I'll never be a runner I think, but I did find myself breaking into a little jog coming down a hill yesterday just to see what it would feel like. And it felt good!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|This series is about a young man blessed (or cursed?) with a flawless photographic memory that allows him to take and pass the bar by reading the books and skipping the usual steps of actually going to law school. Avoiding capture with a briefcase full of drugs belonging to a friend, he steps into an interview for a position for a law graduate and aces the interview, having read the books and actually passed the bar exam having never attended a class. The interviewer is impressed and offers him a job.as an intern.  Half drama, half comedy and well done.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|Absolutely love Community! Very happy I was able to get them all at such a low price! Community never disappoints and will always watch it again!
0440237688|5.0|My son said he enjoyed the book he had to read it for school.  He rated the book a 5.
B0063M22QO|3.0|It is ok but did not have enough levels.  It should just keep going instead they want more money to keep going.  It should reshuffle and let you keep playing again and again.
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|This app is very convenient for transferring files between your android phone or tablet and your computer. It works by connecting through your WiFi (so you need to have a wireless network at your home or wherever you plan on doing the file transfer).  For this to work, you need to connect your phone or tablet to the same WiFi network that your computer or laptop is connected to. After you connect, it is fairly easy to transfer or view files located on the other device.<br /><br />This is handy for transferring photos or backing up files without having to remove your mini SD card, find the adapter, stick it in the computer, and then have to put it all back.<br /><br />It is a good app that works well.
0307476073|4.0|Like Cheryl Strayed, I already lost both my parents by the time I was in my mid-twenties, so I could empathize with the heartbreak she felt at the loss of her mother.  We are all on a journey to find ourselves, and this memoir is an inspiring story of the power of will, the triumph of determination, and the kindness of strangers along the way.  I truly appreciate that Cheryl shared her story; it makes me feel less alone having traveled along the same emotional path, if not the Pacific Crest Trail.  The writing was well-paced and down-to-earth - perfect for a story about hiking that was ultimately about much more.<br /><br />Author of Finding Felicity
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Would definitely recommend this book to someone.was a decent book for the price and not to difficult of a read
B004GF244K|5.0|I was a Jr. high school trumpet player who also loved the guitar. The Beatles inspired me and four or five others to<br />start and band like theirs and begin to play for the young girls. We did that and got good in some years to follow<br />and three of us became professional musicians as a result. I have now completed 35 years as a performer and college professor of music ----- teaching trumpet and guitar. I just recently wrote an instrumental arrangement of Day Tripper<br />for the Jazz band at my university which sounds great even today.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Great book that all women can relate to! Very helpful to read the different perspectives and have some of my thoughts validated about how women are treated!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|My son absolutely loves this game!  It is probably his favorite app that he plays on the kindle fire HD!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I can not stop playing. Heart pounding action. Reminds me of the first time I played Sonic back in the day.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|Fun game for all ages definitely a 5 star great for kids<br />And anyone who has a kid inside them :).
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Good, Sylvia Day is a great author, wish I could of read this book right after the last one.  It took me a while to remember what the prior one was all about
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I think this is a good game because th graphics are awesome  it has a good story line and the animals are really cheap to bet I am at level 10and the high eat I had to pay for an animal was maybe 2000coins and how you get the animals you drive around the Savannah in a jeep and look for injured animals I'd say it's  the best free game in the world if I could only get one game on my kindle it would be this one:):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):)
B00CS65JS2|4.0|Very different from older album. A lot calmer and slower.. Took a while to get used too.now I love it
B003WUYRGI|5.0|i thought it was butt cheese and smelled like my father i loved it thank u for teaching my what cracks are for i didn't knowthe of butt cheese dip hole until now do u  ir self smell like butt hole cheese dip my cuzs father does ha ha bye bye poo dip
B009C7JS14|5.0|This is the best app a person could ask for. And now I am just being a down right suck up.
0802798225|5.0|Perfect Chemistry by Simone Elkeles...well, I just have to say that this book is one of my all time favorites!!!!! Perfect Chemistry is the first book that held my attention and made me want to read more and more! Ever since this book, I've been reading books non-stop! All of Simone Elkeles's books I've absolutely loved and couldn't put down! I swear I've re-read this book I could probably quote it all day! It's a must read! Once you read this book, you'll want to read all of Simone's books! I have read and I own every single one that she has written and can't wait to read Wild Cards!!! I love how in this book she switches from Alex to Brittany's point of view because it gives you insight on how both of them are feeling! If you love this book you will most likely love the rest of Simone Elkeles's books!! They are all amazing! Get ready to read, re-read, and re-read and re-read, etc.!!!!! &lt;3
1577314808|5.0|A bit difficult to read because of the new concepts discussed, but definitely uplifting and worth reading.  It would also be a great book to give as a gift to someone who is depressed or hopeless.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|It was a good game cause it makes you think I really do like this game it is also a very good pastime in case you get board
B001EBWINQ|5.0|One of the top ten movies of all time.  Great story and terrific acting by all.  And what movie has a greater song associated with it than &#34;As time goes by&#34;?
B0091REZMW|4.0|Enjoy playing Mystery Manor. I have not often very far because I don't get to<br /><br />play&nbsp;as&nbsp;often as I would like. &nbsp;
1451695195|5.0|A lifelong friend passed away the week after I read this. Proof of Heaven gave me the peace to know that he is in the most remarkable place we could imagine. I had one sent to his wife.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|My wife and I immediately fell in love with this series.  What we find intersting is the interactions between the royalty and service folks of the household.  Thy each have their own issues, as one would expect in a soap series, and ways of solving or dealing with them.  This is a fast moving storyline that just captures your attention and keeps it.  I would recommend this series to young and old - it's worth the entertainment time to watch.
B000O77RLE|5.0|This was a gift to my husband who loves history and anything to do with any of the wars!! He LOVED it!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I agree with my hubby it's like porn for moms. However I still liked it. :). Lol.  This book is hot.  Fast shipping .
B0070Z4M4I|4.0|Has the look and feel of the 1982 movie &#34;The Thing&#34;.  There are some technical and story-line points which make you wonder, as did the 1982 version.  This movie is a prequel to the 1982 movie.  Both of these movies could be played back to back seamlessly for a great double feature night.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this app is awesome ..especially because of the minions ..and u can choose costumes and use the freeze ray...its just like temple run..but its despicable me style
B00BEZZBFO|5.0|I have bought many computer casings and computer casing cooler fans over the last 30 years. Noctua is the most quiet cooler fan I have ever purchased.  I have install three 120mm fans in my little beast of a computer HAF-XB computer case and it is quiet. If you want quietness, try NOCTUA it the best. It probably cost twice the amount you pay for a standard fan cooler, it keeps the computer case cool and gets the job done.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I been a angry birds fan for 5 years now and I'm so glad the HD version was 2.99 but for a week it was FREE
0345803507|2.0|This is the tamest of the three books and I don't know where all the drama and action came from, totally unlike the other two. Plus was it just me or was the epilogue kind of creepy with the ice cream and the son's fingers?
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I'm so unhappy with your new app.  It's not nearly as User friendly and the format is crap.  Why didn't you leave well enough alone.  I'm deleting it from my Kindle Fire because it is so frustrating to use.  This is me SCREAMING!
B005IQZB14|5.0|Interesting perspectives on overcoming obstacles in life that are tangible and those that are not. I definitely recommend this book!
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Wonderful game, I just wish it was longer! And the 'free' part is pretty misleading. But the game is still fun and it's a familiar story as, well.
B001CTDH76|5.0|Love this show. Son is in Germany with the USAF, and he watched an episode when he was in for a visit, and wanted to catch up, so we started with Season 1, and shipped it to him. He is ready for the other season sets now.
B00785P2QC|4.0|A fun little game to pass time. I like the goals they give you, they really help you get a grasp for the game. That being said, I don't like the goals that revolve around subscribing to the emails, following their Twitter, etc. I don't want to do those tasks but you can't get rid of them unless you give in and complete them. Definitely a star off for that. Seriously, I'm only writing this review to finish one of said goals.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is a  book I have intended to read for a long time.  Glad I finally got around to it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is an amazing game. I love it. If you don't like Temple Run or Subway Sitters this is not the game for you.
1451695195|4.0|We may think we know a lot but this book raises my awareness as to just how little I really know...  How can an illness happen without an explanation?  How can one experience and remember with out a functional cortex?  How can one recover completely from such a destructive illness?  .....a truly amazing,mind blowing story...  a reminder that with God, all things are possible!
B000FBJAEG|4.0|Baldacci has created another book with a pace that keeps the reader engaged. Never one to skimp on details the reader will have a vivid picture of the intensity of the Secret Service and it work in the field. A good read to start the King and Maxwell series looking to reading more in the coming year.
B008TRUDAS|4.0|I enjoyed this story.. it has its sad parts but has the parts to bring you happiness.  You can feel the emotion from all the characters in the book.  kinda leaves you speechless on how to describe this story......
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is a bit expensive but getting it is worth the money it is the best game ever minecraft Pc is better though they are both really good
B000R7I3LY|5.0|I love this album because it is very &#34;raw&#34; for a debut top 40 album. Her lyrics are smart, her voice is insanely good, and the music is well written. Great album!!
B0079XPUOW|3.0|I had bigger expectations with the basic idea of redshirts being the token expendable crew, but the novel gave much more emphasis on breaking the fourth wall and having the characters deal with being fictional themselves than to the story itself. It's a decent novel, but nothing really gripping.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Best thing I've ever played in the history I've been alive<br />Plus when I got to level ten my brain exploded in awesomeness
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great fun and its nice to have a game that's an actual challenge. Could do with a built in hint function for those blonde moments.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|interesting games with a fair amount of challenge. As many reviewers have said do skip the upgrade as progress is indeed lost. Not too bad overall
0812992784|5.0|It took me over a month to get through Rushdie's memoir, but it was well worth it. I took the time to read it very carefully to savor the exquisite language. I enjoyed the device he used; I had never read a memoir in the third person and it really worked here.<br /><br />Of course the central element of Rushdie's existence is the fatwa after the publication of The Satanic Verses, and I think the following quote perfectly demonstrates what the man went through: \\"To hide in this way was to be stripped of all self-respect. To be told to hide was humiliation. Maybe, he thought, to live like this would be worse than death... To sulk and hide was to lead a dishonorable life. He felt very often in those years, profoundly ashamed. Both shamed and ashamed.\\" And yet he felt the need to defend himself: \\"His attempt to hold the line, to insist that he was the victim, not the perpetrator, of a great wrong was being received as arrogance.\\" But Rushdie is often able to infuse humor into his predicament, reminiscing about his addiction to Super Mario Brothers during his confinement. And he can appreciate the absurdity of the rhetoric posed by the Islamists condemning him and the measures they took against him: \\"Ayatolla Sanei... increased the bounty money to include `expenses.' (Keep your receipts, assassins, you can reclaim that business lunch).\\"<br /><br />The profound sadness he felt at the loss of life due to his ordeal is apparent, one example being the five people killed during a demonstration in Pakistan as fundamentalists stormed a U.S building (ironic since Rushdie was an Indian-born Brit). The notion that the weight of his words caused death was deeply troubling for him. There is much description of all of the protection issues, which may seem redundant, but was a sad reality of Rushdie's life for a decade.<br /><br />There is plenty of name dropping, especially fellow literati like Ian McEwan, but there are some fun pop-culture tidbits that I really enjoyed. Rushdie paints Roald Dahl unfavorably (lecherous and unkind). Upon meeting Jerry Seinfeld, the comedian inquires whether the author found the Sal Bass episode funny. He is invited to the Playboy Mansion, but is barred from BookExpo America. He inferred that had the newly founded Bloomsbury published The Satanic Verses, it, \\"...would never have survived to discover an obscure, unpublished children's author called Jo Rowling.\\"<br /><br />Rushdie is very candid about his relationships and is quick to admit his mistakes. His four marriages are laid bare (holy cow, his second wife's behavior was exasperating) and he honors his sons with his beautiful words. He praises his friends and supporters and humbles himself before his readers. This is a moving account of an unusual, often unfortunate, but occasionally blessed life.ts Roald Dahl unfavorably (lecherous and unkind).

B003ZSJ212|4.0|There are many that try to reach a level of connection with the history of Star Wars. This is a way to enjoy it in HIDEF that Blu-Ray bring to you. HOWEVER, THIS IS DO NOT INCLUDE THE ORIGINAL TEATHRICAL UNEDITED VERSION FROM THE 1970's and 1980's. I know that there are many main stream hard-core fans that do not like the newer versions. Still, this brings excitement and adventure into our homes with the Star Wars Saga in just one package. Of course, you would need to include later the Clone Wars (the CGI movie, the Cartoon Network Series in animated film, and the Cartoon Network Series in CGI, and the forgotten Star Wars Christmas Special and the Ewok Adventures: Caravan of Courage and The Battler for Endor).
B00BNGFGIQ|1.0|Freezes on load Asus transformer tf101. Wasn't even able to play the game. Popular device.. should do better testing in the future.

I use it to plan my day, as well as trips. I especially like the features such as the 36 hour, hourly and ten day forecasts, as well as important weather alerts, also access to radar maps and videos. I also use the app to check weather in Afghanistan, where my husband is currently serving.
B009WO7NQO|3.0|When I first downloaded this app, I was excited. But when I started playing, Some of the extra levels cost $1.99, and the bonuses cost money when you run out. I understand the bonuses, but really? Paying more for levels? I give this app 3 stars.
B00821OX98|5.0|Great TV series!  My husband and I completely enjoyed this, so much in fact that we told a friend who quickly began watching the series also.  Great story line and it's nicely done, no sci fi &#34;cheese&#34; here.
B000RH0C8G|4.0|This book felt like the author was having a casual conversation with me.  It was perfect for reading on the beach on vacation.  There were interesting facts and stories but it didn't get bogged down with too much info.  I could easily read for awhile, stop reading and fall asleep in the sun, and then pick up where I left off.  If you like interesting stories, light reads, and baseball this is for you.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love it<br />Best game in a long time.<br />My wife is also hooked.<br />Very fun to play. My grandkids also love it
0553801473|5.0|If you liked any of the past books then you will like this one as well.  It just furthers the stories along.  I was hoping for a little more progression on some of the storylines as Mr. Martin is getting older and I want to know what happens for certain characters.  I don't want to go into much detail as that would ruin some surprises.  Bottom line: unless you don't like GOT, which if you don't why did you read the last four books? Get this book.
B005DJREGQ|4.0|I love it and love all the eye candy.  Matty is such a hottie.  This show is hilarious, but I mean you can't take it to seriously.
0345529057|5.0|I didn't think I would get through all those thousands of pages so quickly.  These books are easy to read, engaging, the perfect shape and size to not make your arms tired through all those hours spent avoiding everything else and just reading these.  You will get sucked in.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|I can't believe I even tried watching this but I wasn't familiar with this type and quantity of raunchiness.  I had thought better of Tom Hanks as well.
0307888681|4.0|This is definitely not as scary as I thought it would be.  It is an easy read that you can pick up and put down at any time if you need to.  You probably won't want to put it down though.  I like how he ran the narrative.  Revealing little bits at a time through the interesting interview style.  If you are looking for something like the movie then this is not for you.  The movie is a separate entity that only exists in a similar universe.
B001R0LOES|4.0|Be aware of language and violence.<br /><br />The acting was very good and the story worth watching although they could have left some of the language out.  I don't think they even talked like that then.

0316010669|3.0|In humanity, decision-making is the daily routine and responsible task. Most of people are having uneasy situation at this particular time because of the demands of cautious and deliberate thinking which are required in order to avoid negative aftermath. The book, \\"Blink\\" by Malcolm Gladwell identified two strategies that our brain uses at moments of decision-making, and how one of the strategies can alleviate the stress and pressure. Proposing the power of instantaneous thinking, he encouraged readers to avoid intentional thinking which will only become more complicated by overloaded- information; however, he also talks about how snap judgment can lead to devastating aftermath if it's wrongfully used. Basically, his idea contrasts with most of people's notions that every decision must not be made in haste, and proposes that there is a method which can help making intuitive thinking more credible. Malcolm Gladwell barely made critics of conscious thought. This book successfully focuses on conveying idea of how our decision is unconsciously interconnected with stereotypes, racism and other factors, and how these negative factors can be avoided in intuitive thinking. Malcolm Gladwell could change today people's way of making-decision, and let readers know how useful snap judgment can be. Yet his idea can be opposed by such ideas that things that require fast decision making for efficiency are mostly predetermined answer and judging the person's characteristic with snap judgment can be wrong.<br /><br />Firstly, intuitive thinking can be as useful as reasoned conclusion. People take enormous amounts of information before making any decision. In this society, people are dedicated to the idea that they should be deliberate in making a conclusive judgment; however, sometimes intuitive thinking can be more reliable. This book illustrated, from the beginning of its chapter, the incident of Getty Museum in California which bought the forgery imitation of Greek status of naked youth called \\"kuoroi\\", approximately at 10 million dollars. It was purchased after 16 months of long exhaustive investigation to confirm its legitimacy. Nevertheless, three experts of geology could know it was counterfeit at their first sight. Malcolm stated \\"When we become expert in something, our tastes grow more esoteric and complex\\". Geologist could strongly argue over its authenticity, because they knew what is dug from the ground or not. Malcolm made three experts' judgment more credible by referring to their unconscious method of judgment called \\"thin-slicing\\". Thin-slicing is the process of reaching to promising answer by eradicating other possibilities based on his or her portion of experience and knowledge. Because geologists knew how objects would be look like over the centuries under the ground after excavation, they could strongly claim Getty Kuoroi as counterfeit over few years. Moreover, hospital in Chicago became one of the best places to diagnose chest pain after gathering little amount of information of patients. Simplicity proved its reliability.  People tend to rely on serious and complicated thinking when a question is given; however, by finding the way of getting a promising answer, people will not need complex thinking to have a reasoned conclusion.  For instance, in the field of mathematic, mathematicians do not waste their precious time on typing sin, cos, tan in a calculator, but with knowledge of geometric concept, they know exactly what to do by estimating to get a possible answer that looks promising to them. They will not have to go through thorough time to complete their answers. Therefore, snap judgment can be used effectively when a person understands the concept of getting the promising answer suitable to his or her profession.<br /> Secondly, people make wrong guesswork by unconsciously referring to stereotype, impression and emotion. Regardless of people's intentions, thin-slicing is mostly interfered when racism or other factors are involved. Among historical issue of racism matters, one of most famous issue was occurred in the United States. Black immigrant whose appearance matched with the rapist was shot by NYPD because NYPD misunderstood his action of pulling his wallet from his back-pocket and took direct action without thinking. Malcolm Gladwell makes connection between NYPD's racism action and snap judgment. In order to justify his proposal, he provided an example of Implicit Association Test (IAT), which is simply done by pairing given words to pictures. In each question, participants will be given few seconds to pair words with pictures. They will not be able to use conscious thought that can help them to answer it with a reasoned conclusion. This test is famous for matters of racism because the test results reveal that the 80% of Americans more quickly pair words like \\"love,\\" \\"peace,\\" and \\"joy\\" with white faces and words like \\"terrible,\\" \\"evil,\\" and \\"failure\\" with black faces. The level of difference is a matter of microseconds, yet is still statistically significant . Although Malcolm is half black and half white, he could not help himself pairing positive words with black. People diminish the value of Black-American due to gossips, media and history. All these factors are knowledge that influence thin-slicing that leads to misjudgment. Today, in order to avoid any factor that can influence its judgment, orchestra does the blind-test of musician candidates by only listening to the music played by the musician and not fronting their appearance. Not only the case of misjudgment on race exists, but also other cases which can lead to unconscious intents of making wrong rapid cognition happen. Judging a person's characteristic by looking at his or her appearance is also popular case. The strong prey upon the weak. Students cannot show their pranksome behavior by the morality which society created to pressures upon them. Knowing that their behavior is reflected by teacher in wrong way, they would have displeasing result. They will hide their true characteristics and imitate someone else who is totally different from real themselves. Malcolm stated that one professor can predict his student's personality by just looking at his or her room. Yet, this idea can be contrasted skeptical ideas; for instance, \\"What if the professor visited the room at impertinent time?\\" . Evaluating a person's characteristic must be the one that opposes Malcolm's idea of needs of intuitive thinking. However, with awareness of negative factors which can influence our judgment, people can avoid devastating result.<br />  Lastly, rapid cognition can be controlled considering the factors which were repeatedly mentioned above. Some people are confident in making snap judgment but all people can make mistakes. They should always consider this as the opportunity to have more confidence with their intuitive thinking because they will know exactly how to react to avoid the mistake next time. People cannot make their intuition be always correct, but there is a way of making it mostly right by cultivating a passive awareness and avoiding a rigid mindset. They should always be ready to let our intuitive thinking express itself by eradicating impression, emotion and stereotypes which are stuck in our mind. In order to do that, people should be aware of their feelings in making decision and be calm. Give room for other people's thoughts by emptying our mind for other negative extents. For instance, do not always believe someone just because he or she is really close and trustworthy to you. This prejudice is one of the negative factors that can lead erroneous conclusion. People should listen to the both sides of people directly involved. Malcolm's idea could let readers know most of our decision-makings are interfered with prejudices, stereotypes and racism. By training adaptive unconscious to be unbiased, people can make more accurate decision.<br /> In conclusion, Malcolm's idea about power of snap judgment could enlighten readers of how snap judgment can be effective, and how it can lead to devastating result. Our decision-making is unconsciously interfered by racism, stereotype and impression. A short moment of decision making can bring irreversible result that can be a huge regret during whole life. Therefore, deliberate decision making for better outcome should be prioritized over efficiency of snap judgment in some aspects. Intuitive thinking works well with predetermined answer just by knowing the concept. It does not need any complex thinking. Yet judging person's personality will be difficult with intuitive thinking because there is no firmly set answer. Our intuitive thinking cannot be always correct, but sometimes shows its reliability and power. As the saying goes, \\"People mistakenly assume that their thinking is done by their head; it is actually done by the heart which first dictates the conclusion, then commands the head to provide the reasoning that will defend it\\"
B00C8985DU|3.0|Wanted the bonus CD with the remastered version. Sold out so ended up with this. Other than the DVD and the free download of the digital versions of the songs, the other items in the package are not really eye-popping (though they added to the weight). Including the Rockshow Blu-ray would have been better in my opinion.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|WOW! This was such a powerful, emotional, heart wrenching book. I laughed and I cried, mostly just cried!<br />It was not the love story I was expecting it to be, but I absolutely loved it!<br /><br />I didn't read the synopsis before starting this book. I simply was in search for a good romance that would make me cry.. so on a recommendation, I bought it. $14.99 at the time, which to me was outrageous for an ebook. I was SO not disappointed. Not anticipating what was to come, I was floored with the raw power of this book.<br />I literally cried non stop while reading, then I cried for days after, just thinking about it!<br />A must read!
B009NG1Q96|5.0|How are you with polygamy?  If you are female, chances are you are uncomfortable sharing.  Here's a book that will seat you in hundreds of pages of uncomfortable.  The more Miss Singer, our heroine, tips her balance toward the prince, the more she has to withstand the emotional rigors of being one out of six wife candidates.

Poor Prince, with the creme de la creme of young women competing for his affection, obliges and not so reluctantly.  Miss Singer sees it first hand.  Meanwhile, secretly, Miss Singer herself is keeping her options open.<br /><br />When she plays her cards in an impulsive, politically naive way, on national television, Miss Singer draws the attention of the King.

B003PBB4ME|3.0|This is made pretty good just be weary of the screw clamp where we attach our LED light it does come loose so be careful we have ours attached to our LED light we use with the camera and we also use the Stand Light combo when we go camping and about lost the light in the Out House at the Camp Grounds. I had tilted the stand forward and the light came off and yes it was good and tight just not the best design.<br />The screw that attaches to the camera works fine just the one that your lights attaches to is the one you need to be careful with.

B000JMKQX0|4.0|I can start by saying I am not personally a fan of zombie products, literature, film, or otherwise. But that in itself is the reason why World War Z is a book that can be easily described to transcend the cliches of the zombie genre and provide enough literary drama to entertain even those of us who would otherwise pass over yet another zombie story. Is it a perfect example of the written word? No. Is it worth reading? Yes. It's accessible, engaging, sometimes completely far fetched, but entertaining nevertheless.

Just because you're going to love it and then you're going to hate it.

B009E3EY38|5.0|My wife and I have been Zeppelin fans for quite a long time and had been looking forward to getting the Celebration Day boxed set. We have been very happy with this product on all aspects - the packaging, the quality of the content are all outstanding.<br /><br />The audio quality of the CD's and the Blu-Ray are excellent, and the visual quality of the Blu-ray is no different. While I will always have a soft spot for &#34;The Song Remains the Same&#34; from a visual and performance standpoint, the Celebration Day video is something that Zeppelin has need for a long time; a high quality live performance video production.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I bought these headphones so I could read in my family room while my wife is watching her TV shows.  I previously had a pair of $200 SONY headphones until my son adopted them.  The SONY MDR7506 headphones put out great sound quality and are extremely comfortable to wear.  I was sold on these by reading the other reviews documenting their use by professionals, etc.  I have not been disappointed.  I like listening to classical music and jazz, and, as I have said I am extremely pleased with the sound and comfort.  My only concern, is that these phones may be somewhat fragile (see the other reviews:  wires disconnect, ear pads disintegrate, etc.) but I can see no reason that if I treat them gently they won't last quite a while.  I am NOT an expert on headphones, but these seem well worth the price.  And of course, Amazon delivered them in their usual punctual manner.
B00BT0ZS52|5.0|First, let me say that this is a long movie. Prepare yourself.<br /><br />That being said, it is a very interesting story, wrapped up in a beautifully shot package. It can be a bit to try and track as the movies bounces temporally around the story, but I think that is part of what makes this a great film. It's the kind of movie that you want to sit down and watch a second time to be sure that you got everything the first time through, and perhaps take a bit more away from the second viewing.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Great, i can manage it in all my devices kindle, Mac, iPhone and galaxy sIII, no problema sincronicing Andr&eacute;s its por free
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I loved it its a little tough at first but then you get sucked in to the game! Definitely worth downloading. :)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book! It was suspenseful and a great story base to it! It makes me want to get the next one right now!
B001VLXNLU|4.0|This book is actually really good. I wouldn't have read it if my best friend hadn't reccomended it, but I'm glad i did. Zoey Redbird is incredably relatable in the way she speaks, acts, and thinks. The plot itself was good, and it kept you interested. It flowed very well, from one good moment to another, and one crisis to another. I'm very happy with this purchase.
B0074VA2T2|2.0|I downloaded this the day it was free for my preschoolers to play with.  They had no interest in it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It just keeps getting better. Twists and turns at every corner and not always pleasing ones. I love this show. So addictive.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|yes it is the weather channel. I wanted something with less clutter. it is just like watching it on tv to much going on.
B000JMKQX0|2.0|This is a collection of mini- stories. Just when you find one that interests you, it's over and you have to move on. Max Brooks has clever ideas and creates fascinating characters, but the stories become tedious. I read the last hundred pages only because I was determined to finish.
B008602KQI|5.0|This movie is almost as good as the book.  The book was absolutely excellent and I did not expect the movie to be able to capture the essence of the book as well as it did.  I would have liked the story of the pin to be inline with the book, and more attention to the relationship between between Katniss and Cinna.  This is a well written, well acted, well directed movie.
B008JFUR10|4.0|After watching \\"Pacific Rim\\", it is no surprise that there is a \\"Godzilla\\" project in the works for 2014. Essentially, \\"Pacific Rim\\" is proof again that movie technology has once again lept into a new era. Sure, many of the scenes that depict the giant monsters from an under-ocean crevice fighting giant human created robots, take place in the dark and in the rain; a seemingly ongoing technique to lessen the difficulty when it comes to creating realism during editing process. Despite this though, \\"Pacific Rim\\" is still a monumental success of science fiction creation.<br /><br />The best part about \\"Pacific Rim\\" though, is that it isn't just a special effects showcase. It was directed and written by Guillermo del Toro; a rare man in Hollywood who knows how to mix technology and effects with heart and soul. Although del Toro hadn't directed anything in 5-years, he has had his hand in many cool things, including \\"The Hobbit\\", both \\"Hellboy\\" movies and one of my all-time favorite movies, \\"Pans Labyrinth\\".  Not only did he bring the giant monsters and the huge bash up scenes, he also brought the heart and personality of the characters that ride inside the giant robots, to life.<br /><br />Occasionally when watching a movie, you feel that urge to swing your own hand in celebration or mimicking the action on the screen. Just to name a few, this happened to me during Rocky, Karate Kid (the first one), Lethal Weapon 2 when Riggs grabs the guy with the pool sweeper on the balcony and probably during Die Hard a few times. I'm sure it's happened a few more times than that, but those are the movies that stick out in my mind and now I can add \\"Pacific Rim\\" to the list; a little bit. Oh, it wasn't out loud celebration and it didn't impulse me to take an actual swing with my right arm or anything, but I felt the nerve impulse trying to move my arm.  \\"Rim\\" is that kind of movie. It's plain and simple, fun, root for the good guy type suspense. The evil is great and the consequences are insurmountable. What more can you ask for?<br /><br />\\"Pacific Rim\\" is not a great movie, but it certainly is a good one. What may have been lacking might just have been something that was unavoidable. The monsters are pretty simplistic and unexplained. Even when they are explained, it isn't all that complicated. Despite that, the action is great, the story is a good one and the most important thing; the characters, Raleigh Becket, Stacker Pentecost and Mako Mori are vividly created and portrayed. Finally, somebody made a big blockbuster movie with giant large scale special effects and didn't fail or at least try to make us care for the people involved. For that, \\"Pacific Rim\\" is like a glowing beacon of hope for the future of movies.re insurmountable.

B0063GORYU|4.0|I love this version of this game. I have it on all my devices. I wish it had an option to turn off the ads.
B000IZA9PI|1.0|I tried to watch this recently, as it is the only Star Trek movie that I have not watched all the way through at least twice, and I couldn't do it.  The story is stupid, the characters don't really stick to their TV histories and everyone is old and fat.  It's too bad a great Star Trek series had to end on such a cruddy note.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|This is the best case on the market for any phone. I purchased this for my grandma who just purchased an iPhone to make sure that it would stay safe for her and she loves it too. I have one and so does my husband. They are the best!
B006N0YWGY|4.0|Easy to play, simple controls, good graphics., wish there were more levels / routes to play. Well executive game that you can play for a short time or during a break.
B0000844I8|5.0|The movie was as great as I remember it, and this extended cut was made greater by the additional scenes.  If you liked the theatrical version, you will love this Ultimate Edition DVD.
0553103547|5.0|I am really pleased with my purchase. The book I ordered is what I expected and more. Havent been able to put it down.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|this season is full of ups and downs for the family. I don't want to give anything away, be sure to have a box of tissues on hand!
B009R659L8|5.0|I could not put this book down.  The twists and turns keep me going to the end. Without giving anything away, I had no idea until the very end who was who.  Well done Ms. Clark.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|I'm a babysitter and sometimes its hard to find games that kids enjoy, so i got this app to entertain my 8 year old cousin, and she LOVES it!!!! I definitely recommend this app for kids and babysitters!
0307949508|3.0|I didn't realize when I was purchasing this book that this was the undersized paperback edition.  I thought I was getting the full-sized paperback edition.  The content, of course, is first rate, but had I known, I would not have purchased this smaller-sized book.
B00119ZMKW|5.0|Just finished this 10 season series and thoroughly enjoyed it!  Had I realized how cool Richard Dean Anderson was, would have watched MacGyver in the 80's.  Hated when Daniel Jackson character was gone for a bit.  REALLY hated when Richard Dean Anderson was mostly gone.  Loved Teal'c and Carter and other characters.  Terrific series!
B008JFUUIA|4.0|The comedy is outstanding in this film!! It will keep you laughing all the way through. Story line is entertaining and engaging, it is easy to connect with the characters even if you are not a singer. Not your typical &#34;romantic comedy&#34; great for 13+ mixed audiences. You won't regret making this purchase.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft!!! Its so addictive and i play it all the time. If only it updated a little bit faster then it would the best game ever!!! I would rate it 10 stars if i could. :)
B008C1O8CA|4.0|I got the albums and listened to them in the order they were released. This one certainly set the table for the next two. You got the sense of building toward something bigger as each track progressed. It left you waiting to see what was going to happened next on following album. I think I'm a bigger fan of some of the older Green Day, all the way up to American Idiot. I'm glad to see them branching out with each new album but it isn't my favorite of theirs. Thats why they get a 4/5, still a great piece of work.
B001VIMCW4|2.0|Awful jumpy editing, vestigial plot, nowhere near as good as the others. Don't bother viewing it unless you are a complete Bond addict like my daughters.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Anyone buying this I'm sure is already a fan of the books or movies. This is a great package with all 8 films. They are neatly packed so it won't take up too much space, but you aren't running the risk of scratching your new disks.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I LOVE the Crossfire series I can't wait for the other 2 to come out. I am in love with Eva & Gideon's story. Not your normal one has the perfect life while the other struggled. Perfectly written story about a man and a woman both screwed up on their own right and finding a way to love not only themselves but learning to really LOVE another, no hold's barred. Can't wait for it to hit the screen!!!
B008G59IKO|3.0|Based on some interviews with BJ prior to the release of these albums, this one was pinned as<br />&#34;the party&#34;. While I could see having this on for background music at a part, I didn't get the feeling I expected of being in the midst of a party while listening to it. Nothing really bad about the record, just expected a little more upbeat fast paced songs.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|The first book is better, but of course you must read second book in the series, can't wait for the third book
B008G59IBI|4.0|Listening to this album, I felt like alot of the riffs were familiar from older other artists. All in all a good album, nice mix of up beat songs and a few slower balad type songs. I'm still adjusting to the newer Green Day sound, but you'll find some familiar hard hitting punk every so often.
B0087X4VSY|1.0|and even at that price, I feel like I was cheated.  This book is not just boring.  It is annoying and boring which is infinitely worse.  It's probably time for SK to hang up his pen.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|It reminded me of a short story I read called the lottery. Slightly more depth and back story here. I think the concept of children brutally killing one another maybe a little mature for some audiences. Overall very entertaining.
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|Very adequate for my needs.  I thought my Kindle was failing, but it was only the recharging cord, and this suited my purposes very well.
B000000XB9|4.0|You can't beat analog converted to digital for clarity, depth, and satisfaction.  Real cds are so much superior to iTunes and MP3 files.  This is an excellent album on a medium that really can support acoustically what the music requires.
B0059WTMLW|5.0|I'd realy like it. It helps to keep your mind buzy and your brain working. It's funny and relaxing. Also can practice math.
0452273331|5.0|A political novel everyone should read which reflects the course our country seems to be on.  Rand was trying to warn us.
0802798225|5.0|I've read the Perfect Chemistry series about three times. I am absolutely in love with it! I fell in love with each and every character. Perfect Chemistry is my favorite book out of the series. I couldn't put it down for five minutes!<br /><br />Alejandro Fuentes: There is just so much I could say about him. He has the looks, the brains, and the charm that any girl would fall in love with. He might be part of a gang but in my opinion it makes the book ten times more interesting.<br /><br />Brittany Ellis: Everyone thinks she has the perfect life at home and at school. But what no one knows, besides her best friend, is that her older sister is special needs, her mom is only aiming for one thing, and that is for Brittany to be a perfect princess, and her dad is rarely ever home.<br /><br />When Brittany and Alex get set up as partners in Chemistry class, everything go down hill. Brittany starts falling for the one person she'd never imagine herself with. They're star-crossed lovers! Who would even imagine?!<br />This book has me wanting a guy just like Alex! I would recommend this book, or series, to anyone and everyone!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|As always, Stephen King writes with a voice that is familiar - I often feel as if it's me telling the story.  He gets the history spot on while we also know that poetic license pops up its whimsical head at times.  Engrossing and fast-paced, for a lengthy tome it's a fairly speedy read.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This app has great features when I can't go to sleep I listen to this app. The great part about it is I don't have to wake up to turn out off because it has a time,
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is an amazing app, and I'm amazed that it's free! The graphics are great, and never blurry or anything like that. Great game, fun things to do. Earns 5 stars easy! :)
B0074VTHKM|5.0|An awesome buy and an enjoyable read I promise that if u buy it u will never put it down!
B0067TQQI8|3.0|Nice back-up phone battery specially when traveling.<br />Also iPad.<br />Only bad thing is that it doesn't charge my Asus Transformer Prime (as it was stated in the title description when I bought this product - all Android tablet).
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I...<br />This..<br />How do I explain?<br />It's simply amazing!<br />I love how the story takes a turn throughout the trilogy.<br />From Dom/Sub to Bf/Gf to Husband/Wife?!<br />You'd never expect it.<br />I love it.<br />I wish it would continue.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Collecting lots of bananas to buy stuff  very fun to play run and at a point battle victer and it`s free me and my brother have it and it is super fun
B003VANOFY|4.0|I have only 1 problem with this headset, the ear mufs are way to tight.<br />other then that it works great
B006LSZECO|3.0|I was first interested in reading Gone Girl last year (summer 2012) when it was being talked about everywhere. I downloaded the sample. It was well written, but not totally enticing. I passed on reading the work in its entirety. This past week I read that Ben Affleck was going to play Nick Dunne one of the two main characters in the movie adaptation. I thought, \\"Okay, I will revisit this novel\\". The idea of movie worthiness, plus being between books elevated my curiosity<br />I read Part One and was ready to stop. It, Part One, is an excruciatingly long \\"don't go in there\\" moment. You cannot believe any one man can be that clueless. I'm no quitter, so I read Part Two that was more like it. The plot twisted and turned back on itself. I was getting very interested. Then Amazing Amy acted like a naive child, which she is not. This is a woman who lived and worked in New York City. Even the rich and pampered have more street smarts than Amy showed. I was really annoyed, but being the stubborn woman I am I persevered to the very disappointing end.<br />Ms. Flynn can be an expert craftswoman when dealing with plot and character manipulation. I should have loved this book, sadly I didn't.
B0099RFVXQ|3.0|Boring found nothing new in this movie, Hollywood needs to come up with more original idea's  HBO's series have good story's<br />good characters..  Disney needs to go back, when animation  was done by real artists  NOT computer Geeks!!!!!
B004OBQDHK|5.0|I did the sound on this film, and wanted to use it in in various Universities. Some ground breacking technology involved.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|highly recommended great author very well written.. tells the story of an inkredible man who changed the world. loved it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I can't describe it with words.  If I did it would sound like oh my God, THIS IS TOATALY FREAKING AWESOME!  Better than sub. surfers and temple run.  My Lord I got it today and that's all I've done (not really it's just I've....  who cares I've spent HOURS on this.  To addictive to put down.  Great for all comedy and d.m. lovers.  (Dats mwah!).  &gt;:D download or I'll freeze u with my freeze Ray!  That sounded so stupid and geeky.  PEACE!!!!
B001DTUU7A|5.0|This is a great movie, a fun story and great animation. Love the Horton character and the music. My son loves it.
0938045768|5.0|The ideas outlined in this book are simple, yet very effective for bodyweight training with little access to equipment. I have made use of some of these techniques to maintain fitness levels while recovering from injuries to my knee and shoulder.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|Had me totally engrossed.  Loved the beginning.  LOVED the ending.  Written very well.  Can thoroughly recommend.  I am now a Kate Morton fan.
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|new classic ,great movie, great for the kids . fast action start of movie will make a great ride at disney
B009X2CRMK|4.0|liked the twist, liked the way the story evolved.  I like the way Kate Morton switches between present and past.
B0030IIYYS|4.0|The story continues and it is good movie although not GREAT as the first part is. Worth purchasing to complete the trilogy.
0316098515|5.0|I honestly bought Eleven Madison Park purely for the photography although<br />the quality of the dish plating and the restaurant itself are in a class of it's own and must be mentioned.<br /><br />The food styling of Chef Humm is truly a work of art and combined with the superb photography especially lighting of<br />Farncesco Tonelli makes this cook book beautiful and well worth the price. If you like great food photography with very clean elegant food styling (by Chef Humm) then this has to be a plus in your collection.
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|The best of the trilogy for sure.  The characters are amazing and the choices of actors to voice them is perfect!!
B0080K3CYI|5.0|This story is very well researched by the author, and also very well told.<br /><br />It is a true story and a compelling read.  Jon Krakauer is a masterful writer who knows how to keep your interest and the pages turning.<br /><br />Into the Wild is one of the best books I have read.  Highly recommended to nonfiction readers!
B0014Z4ON4|5.0|Always have enjoyed this series and wish they would produce some more chapters.  I would certainly watch and buy them!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I DON'T KNOW WHY I'D NEVER WATCH THIS SERIES ON TV! I AM HOOKED AND CAN'T WAIT TO SEE SEASON FOUR
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|After seeing all the reviews I was a little nervous for the ending, but I was happy with the ending.  I loved the book and don't know why so many readers are giving the author such a hard time with this one.
B00364K6YW|5.0|I REALLY ENJOYED THIS ..Colin Firth is excellent as Darcy! The story is easy to follow and watch. Whole cast is good
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have used this every day since I downloaded it.  I have been doing my daily devotional with it.  It's easy to navigate through the whole app
089381525X|5.0|I was a photography student at UCSD when the traveling exhibition reached La Jolla, in 1996/1997. The book itself was released in 1993. I went to the Geisel library and checked out a copy. The photographs of the Serra Pelada mine hit me hard. The composition, subject matter, film type were all things that I studied. I couldn't afford the book as a student and got it 20 years later for my birthday. Revisiting the book and imagery has almost the same effect: the images are breathtaking and sensitive. The story told is of the death of the industrial age, or decline of it. 20 years on, some of these jobs are gone or close to extinct, like the Mattanza in Sicily. The title rings truer now than it did back then. I recommend if you're a fan of Salgado, 35mm photography, and black and white. I also recommend his new one, Genesis.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|It a cut game but not for us elderly people.....I got bored with it after playing the first game after downloading
B005LLSZNM|5.0|I loved how easy it was to watch my favorite show on my computer...i could watch all seasons it was great
B00DAXXO98|5.0|Kevin Spacey is fantastic and the writing is fanatastic!! please make sure season 2 is just as great and make available right away!
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Love love love this series...soon as the first season was over i sent for the second season...i can't wait to get the third. And they were shipped so fast.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This book was better than the first. I'm not planning on reading the last one. The last book can be somewhat of a prediction.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|My husband and I have so much fun with this game. We both compete against each other for best score. I play on my Kindle Fire and he plays on our Ipad. But his keeps deleting his score or replacing it with my game center picture and score...Please fix that! But otherwise lots of fun!!!
B004FRX0MY|4.0|Good app to buy music from especially if you use amazon. I'm impartial to either big apps for music but this does the job.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a great sequel to Temple Run! It's free, they tweaked the characters to a whole new level, there's new obstacles like ziplines and mine carts, and now A HUGE monkey is after you! My one complaint is that, yes, sometimes when I try to turn I end up jumping off a cliff, but still. An awesome game!
B001TODCII|4.0|This movie is interesting to watch.  It also has some interesting tips which may or may not be suggested by real police officers.  However, one very good tip--as someone who lives in a foreign country--is to always be aware of your surroundings.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is the most awesomeness game on the planet it has bananas I love bananas thanks Gameloft for everything<br /><br />  Love,<br />  Tiff
B0083Z614S|5.0|I enjoyed reading about the early customs long ago and the way the many problems were solved. A nice read. Very relaxing.
B00A89ITZG|5.0|The ultimate programming guidance to optimize your performance while minimizing your time spent training for endurance sports such as tri-athalons, running, swimming, biking.  Chapter on K-Star's mobilization concepts to reduce injury and aid workout recovery is priceless.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|Got this when it was the free app of the day but would happily spend the dollar to have it.  The game is fun and challenging with good graphics.  Works great on my Fire.  Grab this one up
B00846REIS|5.0|Very easy reading with fun twists and turns ! Keeps you wanting more !  Makes you think about your own choices.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Great movie, good price. I did find this a little cheaper on sale a few days later, but this was still priced good. The movie is good and the discs were in perfect condition ( as they should be since it was brand new)
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This calculator has an amazing look and can be used by many kid to help than with thee homework<br />p.s also doing homework at the last second
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We love this show!  Wonderful acting.  Can't say enough abou how much we enjoy watch this show.  Can't wait for next season.
1451626657|4.0|The Greatest American Novel; defiled by idiots, like C. Buckley and N. Mailer<br /><br />The novel, itself, deserves a HIUNDRED STARS!!!<br /><br />They didn't need to add these comments from fools and idiots in the re-release. It's like a great Chinese painting where idiots have written their comments on the piece--only defiling it. Anything by Mailer and/or C. Buckley ranks as mere \\"graffiti\\".<br /><br />Heller's novel captures not only \\"America at War\\", but, America, itself, and War, itself. I first read this book nearly 50 years ago. It is one of the only books that I have read over and over again---there are amazing new insights each time!<br />How can we understand the idiocy of Iraq and Afghanistan?---Colonel Cathgart! The rampantant raping of America by the banks and hedge-funds?---Milo Minderbinder! Our gutless military leaders?--Major Major. Our nation's conscience, that our leaders won't listen to?  Doc Deneeka.<br /><br />Even more than  Tocqueville's \\"Democracy in America\\", this book captures our nation character.<br /><br />The VERY GREAT director, Mike Nichols, captured these characters PERFECTLY in his film version of the novel. I recommend that you read the novel first, and then see the movie. It had most amazing casting that I have ever seen: Alan Arkin IS Yossarian; Bob Newhart (as always, AMAZING!) as Major Major; the great Martin Balsam as Col. Cathcart; Orson Welles as General Dreedle; Jack Gilford (another ALWAYS brilliant actor!); Anthony Perkins (brilliant as the pastor); and, perhaps, the best of the best, was John Voight--as the mesmerizing (and mesmerized) Milo.<br />What a book; what a movie!!!
B005QYKD4I|5.0|Downloaded this movie to watch with my 5 year old grand son.  It is a favorite of us both.  We had a great time watching it in our night gowns on the couch.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This alarm clock app is great, includes the weather and features many different clock styles and an easy way to set various alarms and lets me wake up to my favorite music on my Fire HD. Thanks!
B004K8WPUQ|3.0|this mic does what it is advertised to, cuts back the white noise on windy days. very pleased with this
B0093ST02E|1.0|Boresville. Luckily I was painting while watching this and not just sitting there waiting for it to get better. Sorry to be negative.
0316548189|5.0|A moving book, of a man who put the cause of his people above everything else. It's also a shocking revelation of how the so called 'civilised' people can behave in the most uncivilised and inhuman way, the deep rooted and grounded color prejudice and the complicity of world leaders and icons of liberty and democray in perpertuating it. This is not just 'imperialism', the hatered and disgust almost borders on the verge of xenophobia. The world has been a silent spectator to many a crimes but this one is so recent in history, that its duration and length and breadth deeply shocked my conscience. Mandela's legacy of sacrifice, forgiveness, undaunting courage have made him immortal and almost divine. His saga in his own words, is a gift to humanity, it will always remind us that freedom should not be taken lightly as many have laid down their lives, youth and families for it.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Wow. This is a very good game for kids of all ages. I love  This game a lot. Wow. wow.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much, it was a good third book in the series. I can't wait until the next one comes out!
B00CPTUNBK|5.0|My daughter is a big MLP fan and was curious about the Equestria Girls concept. We went to one of the screenings and we both loved it. It was really fun seeing all of the characters translated into humanoids and trying to find all of the parallels to the show. I think that the songs are really fun. And I think that they were pretty clever in the way that they made the parallel universe make sense. We both loved it and went to see a second showing and will be buying the dvd!
B003O86FMW|5.0|As captivating as the first, this sequel was mesmerizing. I can't wait to finish book 3. All of Suzanne's books are spellbinding!
B008P9M614|5.0|the DVDs came earlier than expected.  Great series and Hugh Laurie besides being a wonderful actor also sings, plays the piano, guitar, drums, harmonica and saxophone.
B00C3UUZVE|4.0|This game is very cute and entertaining for childern. I would not recommend this for teens or anyone above the age of 10 unless you are easily amused. Although, this game is obviously meant for childern, therefore I think TribePlay has done an excellent job putting this game together.<br /><br />The game itself is repetitive, but it is definitely worth a try. Other Dr. Panda games like, the daycare, is more interest than this one. My conclusion is for parents out there looking for a game for their childern, this is one you should get.
B003DZX3SA|5.0|This movie was in perfect condition and the kids loved it, they wanted to watch it over and over again!
1401938906|5.0|Since buying this book I've conducted the first two experiments and they worked for me! For starters, when I came into work a day after putting the gift intention out there I learned that the entire office had been granted July 5, the day after Independence Day, off as an extra holiday. Since my vacation was starting July 4, I now have an extra 8 hours of vacation time that I can use later on in the year. Secondly, a company that I do social media work for sent me one of their premium products as a gift...while it's definitely geared towards men, it's a special edition item that costs more and was definitely unexpected.<br /><br />For the Volkswagen Jetta experiment, I decided to focus on seeing orange cars and other vehicles. As soon as I set that intention, I walked out into my office parking lot and my coworker's screaming bright orange Dodge Challenger was the first orange car I saw. I knew he had bought one but didn't know it had been delivered or what color it was going to be. I also saw about 4 or 5 other orange cars on the way home that day, and they usually showed up when I wasn't thinking about it.<br /><br />Update: I also did the Albie Einstein experiment but just used one unwound wire coat hanger to see if it would gravitate towards objects in the room I was looking at and focusing on. This experiment really blew me away, as I had the air conditioning going which I thought for certain would affect the results, but no--literally every object I chose to focus on caused the loosely held wire in my hand to immediately point straight at it.<br /><br />This is a great little book for those who need a little more faith; a little more convincing that the law of attraction exists and is available to all of us. I do feel like some things (especially BIG things like a new job or quality partner) take longer to manifest than 48 hours. The key is to BELIEVE if only for those specified 48 hours.<br /><br />I loved Pam Grout's writing, but one thing she omitted was the importance of feeling grateful and appreciative of things you already have and things that you manifest. Other than that, I'm looking forward to rereading the book (it's a fast read) and putting the other experiments to the test.e importance of feeling grateful and appreciative of things you already have and things that you manifest.

B004KKX814|5.0|I got Metio L-drago and I loved it. I put it in battle areana first, then I put all my other five beyblades in one at a time and metio L-drago still won! It is the best!
B00A72989U|5.0|Great songs on this CD. I love them all. The girl is definitely on fire. My family loves it to.
0321544080|5.0|I gave this as a gift to a relative who is starting a photography business.  They loved it, so it must be good.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I've always loved the Weather Channel app to get the latest weather and keep abreast of major weather events. The update before last had some nice graphics as well. The latest update is not good though. I can still get great forecasts, but the graphics are silly, and has the feel of an app made for a 5 year old. There are now achievement points. Achievement point on a weather app? Seriously?
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I only played the first dungeon hunter and it was good but dungeon hunter 4 is on a whole new of great game play
B009NQZVKG|3.0|I am such a James Rollins fan, but I have to say I was disappointed by this book.Don't get me wrong, it was a good read, but I felt the time line was rushed an unattainable for all that was going on. I had a hard time believing a 23 year old was an asto physisist. The whole quantum time and ripple effect is hard to swallow even though it is being studied. Always love to see Victor and Rachael guest in his books, but disappointed in what he chose to do with them. REALY! Nice to get back story for Seichan and follow that sequey, but mismashed that into the crisis unfolding and was a bit much.
B001EBYMB2|4.0|Great Cast. R. Lee Ermey is the best.  A truly classic Vietnam War movie shot in true Stanley Kubrick form.  Semper Fidelis
B007J4T2G8|5.0|How can you not love this book. It took all of 6 days to read them straight through. Eager to see who'll be cast for the movie!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It has all the features of a good drama...humor, anger, plotting against others, romance, intrigue, etc. The characters are uniquely defined.
B00DW2PDH8|2.0|I received this book from the author with a request for my honest review without any compensation whatsoever, other than the joy of reading a new book.  I really love the premise and storyline of this book and really wanted to like it.  However, reading is so subjective and I have to say it just was not for me.  I just did not enjoy the author's writing style.  For example \\"He pounced on Ellise, pushing Jacques aside and uncorked her wrist with his fangs.  His blood fire was soothed as he drank heavily of her sweetness.  He gorged on the gloriously rich nectar that only comes from refined living.  To Lucien, she tasted positively delicious, fresh, and slightly fruity, like an impertinently young Bordeaux.\\"  While this can be considered lovely prose, for me it became tiresome after the same overly descriptive sentence structure occurs again and again paragraph after paragraph throughout the book.  I was prepared to give up at the beginning and felt to be fair I should continue, it might just be the era at the beginning of the story and after a while I admit I skipped forward to see if there was still more to come and found it continues throughout the book.  I picked up and set this book back down again four different times attempting to complete it and must admit this is the first review I have written for DNF.  Again, as I stated reading is so very subjective and with the number of five star reviews I have seen, obviously this style of writing appeals to and is enjoyable for some, but I am so sorry to say it is not for me.
B005SAJJHM|5.0|I love the big bang theory, after watching the first two seasons on DVD I wanted to continue watching them so I purchased them through the instant video. I always have a good laugh when I watch them and they are great when I have some time to kill.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Having lived with three close relatives who have all died of cancer I found this book quite moving. However cancer is so relentless, I also found it to be depressing.
B005JR3Y5W|5.0|I love New Girl, Zooey Deschanel is amazing! I use amazon instant video all the time, and will continue to use it because of the reliability and competitive prices.
B003YNFYD8|5.0|it was received in three days.  Album sounds like i remember there music.  Went to a friends house and they had all of there albums.
B0038OY6DW|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie, I love all of the actors that are in it and was entertained the whole time.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Should be mandatory viewing for all Americans.  How politics influences our food industry is SHAMEFUL.  So, so, so glad I'm truly informed now.

B0081L37Z0|5.0|I rented this movie because a friend told me how funny it was and I agree with her now after watching it. The dynamic between the characters is great and it was fun to see how things changed for them in the movies. Definitely going to purchase in the near future!
0061120081|5.0|Wow... this book... just wow! I can't even count the number of times it moved me to tears. I never had to read it in school so I just now got around to it and now I'm wondering why I bothered to wait so long. It is definitely going on my all-time favorites list. The subject matter is sad, and I found some of the language hard to swallow but unfortunately that's how people thought/talked/acted back then. I loved Scout and found her funny in an adorably innocent way. My heart literally broke in two during the trial. I recommend this book to EVERYONE! If my son doesn't end up having to read it in school, when he's old enough to appreciate it, I'm going to insist he reads it anyway!

030758836X|5.0|Gillian Flynn knows how to tell a story. Her characterizations are outstanding, which is why I ordered another of her books. She begins with two points of view, both of which show us likable people. The story unfolds, and the reader begins to like one a bit more than the other. Then the pendulum swings, and we don't know who to believe. At the end, Gone Girl left me totally satisfied with the story, the writing (which I did not constantly edit), and the outcome.

B00139XSBA|5.0|History comes alive in understanding our early journeys into space and an inside glimpse into the courageous lives of the few who had the \\"right stuff\\".
B00AVTMCYW|5.0|I read this book a while ago so I was excited that the movie was coming out. As far as I can remember they followed pretty closely but it had been a long time. Either way I really enjoyed the movie and the book is also great. I love using amazon instant video, the prices are competitive and hardly ever have issues with play back. The issues that I do have with it are most likely due to crappy dorm wifi/internet and not the actual website.
B008XKSW7M|2.0|What To Expect When You're Expecting is the story of four couples who are in the beginning stages of parenthood.  The cast is solid and the acting well done, though the basic premise is trite and unoriginal.  The situations are mildly amusing at most and much of the humor has to fall back upon emasculation in order to make up for the general lack of creativity.  This will only appeal to those who like the typical &#34;chick flick&#34;.
B005LAII44|5.0|When I went into the theater to watch GI JOE Retaliation, I wanted to get an experience that I was asking for. And I was right. So in the sequel to GI JOE Rise of Cobra, we find the GI JOE team disbanded by the evil Zartan (Arnold Vosloo) who is impersonating the US President (Jonathan Pryce) with only three survivors which are Roadblock (Dwayne Johnson), Lady Jaye (Adrianne Palicki) and Flint (DJ Cotrona). This film features the return of Channing Tatum, Byung Hun-Lee and Ray Park from the first film reprising their roles as Duke, Storm Shadow and Snake Eyes respectively with a whole line of newcomers that includes action-star Bruce Willis as General Joe Colton which makes this film a heroic good time for anyone who enjoys the GI JOE franchise of toys, comic books and cartoons. But if people love the JOE movies, this is the one for you.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I got this book for a book club and was not expecting much. After getting used to the jumping around, I really enjoyed it and could not put it down. I have to look for more information on the meaning of flowers. I am hooked
B00B8M4IMK|3.0|Nice little adapter. Seems to be reliable, but have only had it for about a month. Wife uses it the most and likes it. Don't like the constant badgering by the company for a review, though. I don't like companies that ask for a review. If I am impressed with a product or service, I will review it without prompting. Asking once is, I suppose, acceptable although pushy. Asking more than once is really not acceptable.
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|I Hate this app its so hard for a five year old to do and it says its a kid app yeah right this app is horrable
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|The songs are just really long, but they're all so great, I'm not even mad. Instead of being 3 mins long, they're mostly more like 7 or 8 mins long.
