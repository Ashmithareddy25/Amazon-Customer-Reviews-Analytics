B00BD99JMW|3.0|SPOILER  ALERT<br /><br />i always thoght oh they never kill the main caracater but VR did i have loved the seris now a family member is reading it i want to stop her but dont want to ruin it · It could have ended diffrent Tris did not have to die as well as half the people who did . in conclusion i was dis aponited i was counting down the days . its only 3 stars because of  the other books worst way to end a seris ever.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love the movie, love the game! Cross between Subway Surfer and Temple Run but with the cute little minions!!! Very fun game.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|I'm totally addicted to this show. I've watched it from the beginning and it gets better and better. Highly recommended for all horror/zombie fans.
B0015RFCZ0|4.0|It was a bit slow to start, but by the end it was very gripping and emotional - in a great way.
B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|I am a HUGE fan of Sanderson.  This book is well written like all of his work and extremely fun to read.  Unfortunately, there are a few drawbacks that have come from him achieving such fame and success recently, and this book pretty much portrays them.  This story formula is the same formula that is used in his Mistborn trilogy.  It suggests that in publishing so many books in such a short timeframe, Sanderson is sacrificing the originality that made him so alluring when he was still blossoming into popularity.  Hopefully his works in the future will continue to show the intricate and thorough details, new ideas, and refreshingly different magical properties that his previous works have given us.<br /><br />Overall - Great read, fun and not too serious.  Missing that last star due to the formulaic storyline and a lack of true development with the character relationships (particularly the falling in love aspect).
B0063GORYU|5.0|Interesting enough to keep me involved and challenging enough to bring me back again and again. It clears the cobwebs.
B001VTTRC6|4.0|made me cry, but it was a bit slow, I guess it needed the 2+ hrs to establish the plot but yeah slow at first
0307165485|5.0|My mother bought this book for my two boys when they were babies, and it quickly became the most beloved children's book they had. It was well used by the time my youngest took it over (and finished it off, lol), but I remember well those cozy evenings, post bath time, curled up on the couch reading stories. This was 'always' the book they chose, and every page we turned and word we read captured their full attention. Now, I'll be the grandma in a month's time, and just yesterday my son reminded me how much he loved this book as a child - how he'd love to have it for his son. We were talking by phone, while each of us was searching Amazon for this book. When we found it, we reminisced, I clicked on 'Look Inside' and started reading bits of stories. He still remembers them and got a bit choked up, actually. I'm so excited to now be the grandma, the one who makes this timeless book a part of my new grandbaby's fondest memories.
B009949RKC|5.0|I had gone to the remake of this film with a bunch of girlfriends.  It was okay.  When I was looking for a movie to watch one evening at home I ran across the original and decided to watch it.  Loved the first one best I think.  Girls had REAL breasts and were proud of whatever they looked like.  The hair styles...the eye glasses....the cars....NO seatbelts!!!  It was nice to go back in time to a day when kids were not drugged by their gov't and the dollar still had value.  All awesome.  The only thing I do not like about this film over all is that it gives bullied kids the idea to seek violent revenge on their attackers.  All of the kids who have sought revenge are the kids who are on gov't drugs.  Sad days we are in.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|if you like the super hero genre, you will thoroughly enjoy this movie.  They have managed to get a great group of actors, that fully embrace there alter egos.  I found the individual superhero movies to be hit and miss, but this movie takes all the good parts of each and makes a great team/movie.<br />The one drawback is the sound.  This movie was meant to be seen in the theatre.  Like most action movies, the dialogue is difficult to hear and the action is really loud. Certainly not enough to ruin the fun of the movie though.<br />Enjoy!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I thought I would be able to stream anything from the computer to the TV but this is NOT the case.  I don't use it very much.
B004LROUNG|5.0|Great book, just started it but very good so far. My wife is a John Grisham fan and she loves the book.
B00BTZN91C|5.0|The songs make me feel happy and think about good memories. Great songs and a great deal for all of them
B00EL8JCGU|1.0|I loved reading World War Z - I could barely put it down.  I knew there was no way the movie could ever be as good, but it feels like the filmmakers didn't even try.  Awkward pacing, horrible script.  Some cool scenes with the zombies, but otherwise, a total waste of an amazing story.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game, but I wish it were easier to get lives more often. The graphics are fantastic and the game is extremely hard to put down.
006202406X|1.0|It became clear upon reaching the end of Allegiant why VR decided to change narrative styles... I don't care about the ending necessarily - but what I do care about is genuine, organic story telling with integrity. The ending of the story doesn't seem to make sense to me, in terms of the previous books.<br /><br />I don't feel that I own the characters simply because of the time that's spent with them, but I do feel that the last book doesn't belong.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've been waiting for this come too kindle. Thank you all much. My family and I love this game and are so happy to now play it on our kindle. Now I'm telling all my kindle owners and friends. Thanks again we love it!
B00CM4VC7M|3.0|I pre-ordered this as soon as I heard about it and was very happy when it arrived. She is very pretty and the paint detail and facial expressions are really good.<br />After opening and trying to position the figure, though, I find that it is VERY awkward to manage. Her torso easily disconnects at the waist and doesn't seem to securely snap into place. Her arms completely fall off after barely touching them. I finally just got her into a basic pose and leave her on my shelf. I don't know if I received a defective figure, but my concerns with this were enough to warrant cancelling my pre-order of Mercury & Mars.<br />With these craftsmanship problems, I can't justify spending $40 each for the remaining figures.
034580404X|1.0|I know this is an erotic novel and didn't expect the writing to be amazing but its awful. I desperately wanted to like this book. A big problem is how Ana is characterized. You can tell its a middle aged English woman writing who has no idea what its like to be a 20 something in America. And the Jose character... Borders on racism. I unfortunately bought the trilogy and I haven't been able to move my bookmark past page 100 where its been for a month.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This is a great game. If you don't like games that take time then you won't like this game. It still is great..
B00BUCW54Q|2.0|I like Tom but this just wasn't his style. I found it pretty boring compared to some of his other movies.
B0052RDHTM|2.0|I am a great lover of historical fiction. This novel is my first Follett work, and I probably should have read something else of his. There is far too much romance, flirtation and sexual content. The scene with the German getting a handjob in the opera house was boring and vulgar at the same time. The book seems like it was written for teenage girls. If I wanted that I would read the Twilight series.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|Daniel Craig never disappoints. He is by far my favorite Bond. I hope he sticks around for a couple more movies. It will be hard to find anyone that fits the roll as well as he does.
B000H4QD1O|5.0|Absolutely, without a doubt, the very best sci-fi series ever created. Executed way too young by a mindless network who couldn't see the vision of Joss Whedon genius. Watch and the show will not disappoint but be prepared to be disappointed that once you finish the series there is nothing to fill the void.
B00BMVTTJ4|2.0|I expected better after the lord of the rings.  Found it boring. Hoping the next one will have smog and be better
B006BGZJJ4|3.0|This cable came a part after just a few weeks of use.  The end that goes into the I-pad came apart.  Would not recommend it.
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|The original writer must be rolling over in his grave. This was boring. The writing and acting were atrocious  I can not believe anyone thought this was a good movie. Even the special effects sucked..
B00000E1W0|5.0|This was an album I heard in my youth & it took me 25 years to finally find out who created this masterpiece!  Got it, love it, would buy it again.  ^_^
B00D6BN9NK|4.0|Typical Bruce Willis film always fun with lots of catch phrases and things blowing up.  If you enjoy action movies because they are fun you won't be dissapointed .
B005U9REU0|5.0|I've seen this many times in the past, but have since fully worn out my old VHS tape.  Was in the mood so I rented it.  One of the best movies of all time.  The creativity is just awesome.  I actually did a fan pic of this movie.  You find it at:<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />or find other stuff in my gallery:<br /><br />[...]
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's fun and I really enjoy it's a great way to spend a boring day playing games. I always wanted a horse made me feel like I really had one
B002VECM72|5.0|Just a great feel good movie you can watch over & over. Highly recommend this movie to anyone of any age.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game yea sure it does freeze sometimes but never! It is awsome I recommend this to anyone who loves horses!
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|I have read everything he has written…and I was not disappointed with Sycamore Row!!!!!<br />AWESOME STORY !!!  Welcome back Jake and everyone from Ford County
B00EDOS6IC|5.0|I had worn out Circus Maximus and Kamelot and really wanted another album so I clicked on this purely by accident -- I liked the album cover.  Not much of a Creed fan, I am blown away by this album.  Can't stop playing it -- in the car, on my computer, on my mp3.  I hear a mix of metal, rock, pop, blues -- and it's not a hodgepodge by any means -- it all works -- there isn't a filler song on it.  Love the vocals -- great voices -- but in a classic rock sense.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|It is a great book for history buffs. It explains the basic foundations of Christianity. Born again Christians will hate it. I also recommend the author's book on Islam.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game has me hooked , have to fight for my turn AND IT IS MY GAME! I am an adult should know better!!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I didn't find time for games until my daughter got me hooked on this.  If you start it you will never put it down.  Fun, aggravating, really makes you think.
B008JFUQ16|4.0|In “Despicable Me 2” Felonious Gru is no longer a villain – perhaps not even the hero of the new movie. Not that he has become dull or unfunny after his retirement. It is just that he has become, well, ordinary. Fortunately, the film itself is very entertaining thanks largely to the yellow-colored creatures Minions.<br /><br />Gru, who was like a cross between Mr. Bean and Dr. Evil in the original, still looks the same, but he is now a (basically) nice person and caring father of three daughters Margo, Edith and Agnes. A new adventure begins when Gru meets Lucy Wilde, an agent sent from a secret organization called Anti-Villain League or AVL.<br /><br />About half of the film follows their joint investigation into the case of a stolen chemical PX-41, substance that changes living things into purple people-eaters, and the romantic relationship between the ex-supervillian and an active-duty AVL operative. The idea is fine, though Gru of the sequel is rather a different person, more likable but less interesting than in the original.<br /><br />In spite of the weak storyline, however, the sequel works because of the horde of Minions and their funny antics, as well as the unique and colorful designs of animation. The enjoyable film comes with a sort of teaser of the upcoming spin-off of the franchise “Minions” scheduled to be released in a few years. I hope the filmmaker will keep doing a good job.
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|I like the game its fun interesting and I never get tired of it. my 5 and 13 year old brothers love it too.
B005N4F37S|5.0|Despite some problems (Martin Sheen as Lee makes the General look like a nut!), it still entertained and informed me.  Loved that it was filmed at Gettysburg and this allowed the movie to really flesh out The Killer Angels.  Little Round Top was an excellent depiction and Picket's Charge gave me the chills.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I've been lifting since - well, probably before the author was born. I haven't been serious in recent years due to work and injury, but I've been picking up programs and individual books in anticipation of the point where work and surgery would allow me to jump back into a focused lifting program (that time's finally here). I was surprised and impressed by BLS. It's a quick, concise and well written book (I read it in a few hours), and it gives a program for lifting and eating that make complete sense, especially taken together. There's nothing in here that I find is incorrect, based on my own years of experience and more recent research (Venuto, McDonald, etc). If this is the only book you ever bought on resistance training, diet and building the body into what you want it to be, you'd do just fine. Like many other reviewers, I emailed the author with a request for clarification, and as with the others, he responded within a day with a gracious and thorough response. Highly recommended all around.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Can't get enough of this game thank you releasing it to the kindle. I sleep eat candy crush. Kids also love it.q
B00ARHAAZ6|2.0|Steelheart just wasn't the book for me.  After seeing the great reviews I decided to purchase this book and regretted it after I began listening to it.  I kept thinking it would get better, but it didn't.  I found the book boring and uninteresting.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|the alarm and timer work exactly as advertised. nice to be able to choose alarm tone , app, or specific song
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I like this game, however I am on level 212 and my coins have reached over 20,000 and I have reached the end of  the puzzles and have upgraded all I can so I hope that they come out with an upgrade soon
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I have not been able to read a whole book for a long time.  This book broke the cycle.  I am happy.  I did not want this book to end.  GREAT read?
B00F35B8F8|5.0|Nice subtle one liners that refer back to the original Star Trek. Had the feeling of the original series. Enjoyed it immensely.
B008JD7VZM|5.0|My grandson 9 yrs old loved this lego minecraft. He had it completed by the evening! Got a kick out of Steve.  Now grandma will buy the village! Christmas is right around the corner!!
B00FPH6AXE|4.0|Overall, not an amazing movie, but interesting and enjoyable nonetheless.  The only thing I really did not like was the strange accents used.
B003WQT2YY|5.0|Fabulous!! I just got back from Prague and Vienna and had to see Amadeus again. Although the setting of the movie was Vienna, I recognized a lot of Prague because of it's preserved archetecture.
B004OHFLW2|5.0|I was a little wary of buying this book online but i'm so happy i did!! this book at my college bookstore costs $15 and so when I saw the price here ($2) I was so pleasantly surprised! the order came in just 2 days which I was so happy about, all in all the book was in PERFECT condition and I saved tons of money thankyou! so much!
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|This game is a greart way to kill time between classes. The song makes it even better and is always stuck in my head.
B00AEFY6ZQ|2.0|I love Howard Hawks, just as much as I love THE DUKE.<br /><br />This movie had it's \\"moments.\\"<br /><br />The plot is well rounded. The setting is beautiful. Elsa Martinelli is highly ANNOYING.<br /><br />You can clearly tell that a stunt double was used for Wayne.<br /><br />I give it 2 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />I thought Rio Lobo was Hawks and Wayne's weakest collab... this changed my mind.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun game!  I Dont like that you have to wait or pay to continue playing, but still a fun game.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|To be honest, I like most sci-fi action flicks.  I especially enjoy ones with strange or unexpected twists.  Throw in one of my favorite actors (Morgan Freeman) and really what is there not to enjoy.  This was a fun movie.
B00F56AZK4|1.0|The puzzles are fun to do and offer several sizes of each picture.  But......Most of what they show you have to pay more money to do.  That was very disappointing!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|loved the follow up on a beloved story from my past...thanks Stephen King<br />I have really enjoyed all of your books.
B009ZFPQOQ|1.0|Was disappointed. Wouldn't finish loading. Could never connect to the server. I had more hope for the product. Perhaps after an update it will work.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|it was fun a little challenging managed to figure it out without using very many clues ready for more levels
B007SGM084|5.0|Have been hearing about these books for a while now and finally decided to read them and I am so glad that I did.
B000I9TY4G|5.0|I loved the way the characters interacted with each other in such intimate and snarky ways.  It is odd and it WORKS.  A western style space movie complete with swearing in Chinese (usually with a slight twang), imperfect characters that push one another to do better, and a big heart.  I loved the series and the movie.  SPOILER ALERT: I just wish two characters weren't killed off in the movie (Wash and Book you will be missed).
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Great. Will be getting season 2. I lived each character and the way they were all developed. Hope it continues to be this giod
B000FBJF6Y|4.0|I find this book a delightful read.  The main character is beautifully drawn.  The details describing Africa are great. My favorite mystery is the one with the two doctors.  Her solving all of the other mysteries is very believable.  Even though she had a bad experience with her ex-husband, eventually she does see there are good men as well as cruel ones.  I highly recommend  this book.<br /><br />Thelma Norton
B000F5GO0A|5.0|Gulag Orkestar is solid all the way through--this is not one of those albums where you listen to one or two songs and skip through the rest. Zach Condon's work shakes me to my core and this is my favorite of his albums.
B00AOCZOLO|5.0|New girl is a great for the rainy days when you're feelin' the blues and just need something to cheer you up while you lay in bed. ;)
0375869026|5.0|Simply written from a 10 year old's perspective, in a manner appropriate for other middle graders, the messages of Wonder - acceptance, kindness, friendship, family - transcends all ages, making the story a must-read for everyone (why isn't this required reading for the world, yet??)<br /><br />August is a medical marvel - born with severe craniofacial abnormalities that occur in only one in a million+ people, he wasn't expected to survive, let alone thrive. But after countless surgeries, years of homeschooling, and support from his parents and older sister, \\"Auggie\\" is ready to go to a \\"real\\" school for fifth grade. Here he encounters a range of issues - both wonderful and devastating - that all middle schoolers are likely to have, but that are all the more traumatic due to his physical abnormalities.<br /><br />But as Auggie says in the very first chapter - he really is just an ordinary boy, despite his appearance. An ordinary boy who inspires so many in the story, and those that read it. Heartwarming and heartbreaking, inspirational and distressing, this book is a \\"wonder\\".
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game - lots of action.  Wish it gave you more than 5 lives. Very colorful and fun to play.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app is my favorote. It is sooo addicting and really fun to play. You wont regret getting this app!!!!!!!
B004T5R2HQ|2.0|Yes the program takes a picture and makes a PDF.  That is about all i would say about it.  Won't be using it again.
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|. I loved this movie. I believe it is my favorite of the three so far.  Lots of action and great suspense.
B000PC0U1W|5.0|What a Great Movie, Lots of Action as well as deep Socio Political commentary. Also Natalie Portman looks Hot in the School Girl outfit!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Love the book.  Now I have to go back and enjoy The Shining all over again. Stephen King never disappoints.
B00364K6YW|5.0|This is the classic brought to life, that is a classic in of itself! When in doubt get the &#34;Colin Firth BBC Pride and Prejudice!&#34;
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love Candy Crush Saga.  Not very good at it but practice makes perfect.  Love it. Love it. Love it.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love this app. Really makes it handy to read alot of random short stories while on the and not loose your place in the book.  Its a very handy app.  I would recommend it to anyone.  Amazon also offers alot of free kindle books where as they charge for the paperback versions.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Good really kept me reading. I loved how you couldn't tell what's next. Finally I live the friends bond  that they had
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|It does not work in my region. If I didnt have a smart phone this would have almost been a waste of money.
B00FWLSLJ4|5.0|Amazing monster movie experiences are sadly few and far between.  Very simply, Pacific Rim is a lot of fun!  The movie is well directed, acted, and written.  Big cheers to all involved in making the film!  I especially love the contrast in the organic, fluid motion of the monsters compared to the clunky, mechanical movement of the human piloted machines.  That contrast, effectively expressed, is a testament not only to the exceptional special effects the movie exhibits, but to the amazing directing job of the one and only Guillermo del Toro.  Thanks for making this movie!  I highly recommend the film in high definition!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I am thoroughly enjoying this app.  I have had no problems and since I am technology challenged that's saying a lot.
B00FPH6M82|3.0|The movie was about what I expected.  Will Smith's character should have been portrayed as a bit older considering his rank.  His son though did a relatively good job all things considered.  Go into it with low expectations (what I do foe these type of scifi movies) and you will be pleased.
B00CXVX1OQ|3.0|I can't say that this is the best game that I have ever downloaded, but truly wont say that it is the worst either.  It was free at the time of my download and I wouldn't have actually paid for this.  It kept me entertained for a day or so and then like most apps, I lost complete interest.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Just watch it - I love this show.  I can't wait for season 4!  You will fall in love with all of the characters!
B007MC8YLQ|2.0|Unless I am not doing it correctly, I can only play with one suit and I like to play with 2 suits.
B000148KK2|4.0|Not her best, but still wonderful
B00G32QIEG|4.0|A fun movie for the family (with older kids), for a lazy weekend afternoon.  The characters work together, the banter between them is funny as heck at times. A nice twist to a ghost styled movie adding some action and a supernatural type plot.  All an all 4 stars (extra star just because we were not embarrassed to watch the movie with the kids, the language really was not bad!
B006CEKZ4Y|4.0|I will be attacked for not giving it 5 stars, but here goes.  To my mind, a top-drawer film has to have an involving story, first-class musical score, top-level performances from the whole cast, and standard-setting cinematic technique (for its era).  Citizen Kane surely makes the grade on the last item--the camera work and lighting is striking.  The story is moderately involving, the acting excellent, the music good.  It's surely a fine film, but &#34;greatest&#34;--I'm not convinced.  To me, Casablanca and Vertigo are better.
B00EY8A6BC|1.0|It was really one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! Horrible acting, dumb plot line. Unexplained events in the movie and the dialogue was so contrived and pedictable.
B008PQ8XZK|5.0|A love story with suspense spanning decades. Recommended if you enjoy reading stories from the past intertwined with contemporary life. Good plot.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was so happy when my daughter told me CCS was finally on the Kindle Fire! Game works great! Thank you!<br />Now, if I can just get past Level 157!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is the modern classic found on Facebook, and now on kindle fire.  Five stars for this fun and addictive game
B00B2PHSIY|5.0|Wonderful lens.  First five without the red lens.  The rest of the dives with it.  Incredible difference.  It brought out all the colors in the coral.  Great buy.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|This is a fun game with brilliant colors and fluid animations. While the game is enjoyable, leveling up takes a very long time a short while into the game and once the story missions are done for a particular experience level, there are only small daily missions to keep you going to the next level.
B00FWLDHSY|4.0|Good job on the monsters and affects in this movie.  End of the world plot a little worn, but overall a good action thriller.  Loved Ron Perelman's character.
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|I have been looking for a game that would make me think and be fun at the same time. This is it! I love it and have a hard time putting down my Kindle. I like the fact that it is not timed so I don't feel rushed. It requires planning ahead and sometimes takes me several tries to complete a level.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I was looking for cute things on Pinterest and was thrilled when I clicked on them that it took me to Amazon to purchase.
B000YHG72E|5.0|Not my favorite, but the kids love it. Not the best Will Ferrell movie, sort of corny. But its a Christmas movie.
B000000OF6|5.0|GREAT COLLECTION OF THEIR SONGS. REALLY IS ALL ALL OF THEIR BEST. WOULD RECOMMEND TO MY FRIENDS. GLAD I ORDERED IT.
B00DYWKPAQ|4.0|I'm sure there will be many reviews on this album, mostly good and a few bad ones. To me this album is like a brand new pair of shoes. You really only can't tell how great the shoes are until they have been worn several times. This album is like those shoes. At first I wasn't sure exactly what to think. Some songs are like previous albums 'Only By The Night' and 'Come around Sundown'. Some songs reminded me  of other previous albums. To me the The Kings Of Leon meshed music from earlier albums and new songs together. Blending these sounds with new material has created a new sound.The more I listened the more I liked this new album,'Mechanical Bull'. This is what happens to music, it evolves. Music constantly changes, if not then it would be like watching the same movie over and over again.The Kings Of Leon have taken a somewhat different direction with their music. Buy this new album and I think you will like it. Really listen to it a few times. I think you will approve.
B005544TRQ|4.0|Great show officially hooked. It just keeps getting better. But what I don't understand is why I have to have a certain number of words to submit this
B00FJTYDKK|1.0|Weird how all &#34;kids&#34; movies are about death. Disney movies you sometimes get to see the parent die. This one you get to see them run from it. Fun to watch as an adult. Torturous for my kids.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Just as simple and easy as promised. Operates better than videos on a desktop - no buffering or glitches. Hope they are able to partner with more content providers soon. Got it only to watch &#34;house of cards&#34; which was well worth the very small cost of the unit and Netflicks subscription.  But now enjoying movies, documentaries and YouTube. It would be great for music like Pandora.
1616550414|5.0|I got this as a gift for my boyfriend.  He and I are both huge Zelda fans.  The art illustrations are gorgeous i was highly impressed.  This is a definite must for any Zelda fan!!!  I should of kept it for myself!!!!! lol =]
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Can't put it down.  Very addicting.  I'm surprised that I play this game so much.  I'm not a video game player normally.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Love the game. YEA  !!  YEA ! Keeps me alert in my senior years. Buy one and put it on your Kindle.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Well written, taking the lives of three different women and entwining them together.  It would have been nice to have a little happier ending...
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I just love this game, it is challenging without being too hard. I also like that it has so many levels.
B005ZB91KY|4.0|Still today these movies can be watched over and over, great effects and a cast of wonderful individuals.. this is the movie that kids of all ages would enjoy..
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|A very good read one that kept you engrossed to the end. I have read all of Grishams books and have enjoyed all of them but some stick out as his best and I would put this up as comparable to A Time To Kill.
B00FEN000S|5.0|AWSOME 1 of the best movies ever made. I enjoyed watching it with my family and friends, great way to spend time together.
B009O2XY12|1.0|Takes 45 minutes to get 1 life...constantly freezes and causes you to lose a life. I would not recommend this game. waste of time to even download. i think they have it set up this way so you will spend money to play!!!
B009DA74ES|5.0|A true great guilty pleasure. Its hard not to watch every episode at one sitting. Guys want to be him, girls love him. Adult humor and situations (no for kiddies). We have all seasons and still watch them today. Great one liners you repeat and say to your friends.......Mother F**kkeeeeerrrrr
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|fun to play i like it very much l would recommend it great great  great great bu it it fun
0307956350|4.0|I liked the style of writing. Hints were given so you knew something was going to happen, but still the end was a surprise.

B00BD99JMW|2.0|SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Ok, I've warned you.<br /><br />I really didn't like this book, and not because Tris died. The book was BAD. Poorly written. First of all, I was able to stretch out the reading of it over a week. With Divergent and Insurgent, I couldn't put them down. This book DRAGGED and at one point I thought to myself \\"get on with it already.\\" Then it was all this scientific stuff about GPs and GDs. I get that the genetic issues drive the plot, but CHARACTERS are what make a story, and Ms. Roth clearly forgot about that.<br /><br />The two POVs were also terrible. When you can't remember whose POV you are reading, it's a problem with the WRITING not the story. This book was laden with WRITING problems. Yes, V. Roth is the author and controls what happens to the characters, but the execution was just plain awful, and if you are going to diverge from the story you've already created, you better do a better job than Allegiant.<br /><br />What we got was a 3rd book with huge plot holes, characters that are useless or unimportant, characters acting completely out-of-character and in direct contradiction to their behaviors in the other books, and a pointless death that only serves for shock value. Veronica Roth can claim that Tris's death serves some lofty purpose, but saying it doesn't make it so. She shouldn't have to convince us, she should have written a story that left no doubt.<br /><br />Ugh. I want my $7 back and I wish I could \\"unread\\" this book, because I'd be happier with the Insurgent cliffhanger than this drivel.<br /><br />(And just to be clear - my low rating of this book is not correlated to the death of the main character and protagonist. I can handle killing the main character, but do it right, and give me a better story than this book. Make it have meaning, not just shock value. A well written story would have gotten 5 stars even if she killed Tris, Tobias and Christina.)
0071636080|4.0|This book is overrated. The author must be a huge fan. His writing almost boasts a bit of biasness. Nevertheless a few great points were gleamed from this read. Keep in mind Job's style may only work in certain venues. The best piece of advice when presenting...loose the script. Good luck
B00F7YHDWC|1.0|At this point I would have to give it a one since it froze and I couldn't do anything with it.  I just deleted it from the tablet.
B00CL0J99K|2.0|There once was a game called 'Doki Doki Panic,' if you know it at all, you will probably know it as 'Super Mario Brothers 2.' It was a good game in its own right, but it wasn't a Mario game.  Rather, it was simply a solid game that they attached the Mario name to because of the popularity of the first game.  That's how this movie feels, it feels like it wasn't even meant to be an Iron Man movie and they just kind of made adjustments here and there to make it work.  There will be spoilers for the rest of this review, as I don't think it would be helpful to be vague on some points.<br /><br />Let's start with some plot elements.  The main adversary is the terrorist known as the mandarin, his thing is basically that he has genetically engineered henchmen that can generate crazy heat.  This allows them to melt things (like an iron man suit) or just overheat and blow up like a giant bomb.  That's a kind of lame power when you think about it, but meh, I understand that they don't want every nemesis to just be some guy in an iron man suit, so no problems there.<br /><br />The problems with the plot come from the sloppy plot devices.  Tony Stark picks a fight with the mandarin for really no good reason, and then a team of three helicopters attack Tony at home.  Wait... three helicopters... against Iron Man... let's stop and think about this for a second...  But wait, Tony's Iron Man suit is a prototype that doesn't work... well that was lucky for the guys in the helicopter wasn't it?  Good thing when they were planning this mission they were able to say \\"Ya, we're just going in with a few helicopters, but it should be OK because I've got a hunch that the nearest suit will be a piece of junk.  Ya, he's got like 40 more suits downstairs, but I mean, what are the odds that he'll go down stairs?\\"... It's just ridiculous, but they did it because they wanted to strip Tony of all his advantages and allow him to prevail through determination.  It's the same as when Dark Knight Rises decided to make batman poor, sloppily done and frustrating.<br /><br />Later, because he doesn't have any working suits, he decides to raid a terrorist compound on foot, with a hoodie and a bunch of stuff he got at home depot as weapons.  What is this nonsense?  He's Tony Stark, not Rambo-Macgyver.  And lastly, for the final fight, he suddenly has 40 spare suits that can act as drones.  Man those would've come in handy when raiding the compound, but the rubble of his house prevented them from being accessible.... until just the right moment.<br /><br />There are many more problems, from a poorly-conceived Air Force One infiltration to absurd fights (this guy can melt my suit! I better ignore all the projectile weapons on my suit and fight him in melee range!).  Perhaps this all seems nitpicky, after all we should be willing to suspend disbelief to some degree for movies like this.  My problems stem from how sloppy this all was.  I will say, if you are a fan of the series thus far, you should still see this movie.  If the stuff I gripe about doesn't bother you, you may really enjoy it.  Problems aside, it's not that bad by itself.  But it's by far the weakest in the series.s decided to make batman poor, sloppily done and frustrating.<br /><br />Later, because he doesn't have any working suits, he decides to raid a terrorist compound on foot, with a hoodie and a bunch of stuff he got at home depot as weapons.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love all the functions. It is most handy on my Kindle Fire.  The prior keyed numbers are saved for your review if you want. It is similar to a tape in an adder machine.  Saves a lot of rekeying to check your entries.  Cannot think of anything else I could ask for and it is free.  On the Kindle it is just like having a large machine at your disposal.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|You have everything you need, I would say if your book needs images this doesnt quite fit but for the rest it is a great very clear book step by step. Totally recommended!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The puzzles were a fun challenge. It was short, but the quality of the game was great. I'm looking forward to the &quot;late 2013&quot;  for the next installment!
B006M4F67A|5.0|Fun activity that makes you think and occupies your mind. Nice, as you can play alone while waiting for others.
B00FHAB3HW|2.0|I liked her single Wrecking Ball, so I thought I would give the album a try. It was extremely irritable and I stopped listening after the 5th track. I feel like the production value was not at the level that I know she can be at. A good try, but not enough for me to be pleased with it.
B00DGN51O8|5.0|We had a blast watching this movie and thought it was well worth the cost.  What an adventure.  Lots of laughs and great story to boot.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|An excellent account of the war in the Pacific, based on books written by the main characters.  A little gory, but so was this war.  Excellent special effects, well written and good actors.  Well worth the time and money.
B004HO6I4W|4.0|Entertaining, colorful, has some fun music and keeps the kids engaged throughout the entire movie.  It's a great value for $10.
0307476073|5.0|When a book stays on my mind and causes me to think differently, it rates highly on my list of favorites. I am not one to follow trends in reading, and picked this one up hesitantly, but it has stayed on my mind. Some parts of it were a bit &#34;silly&#34; but mostly, it grabbed my heart and my focus. Although her impetuous and unprepared journey can be considered brave, it was also rather crazy, as she most certainly could have been killed at many points. But at the period of time in her life when it was written, she felt she had nothing to lose, as she was already lost. Self-discovery at its rawest. It is one of those that I will re-read and recommend.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|Stumbled across this movie and it was awesome!  It would be on my personal top 10 must see films as it's just an incredible story line.
B00D2ZF3GQ|3.0|I thought it was an OK movie, I didn't feel the same connection with Will Smith and Jaden Smith as I did when they costarred in the Pursuit of Happiness. That movie you felt the love this movie Will Smith was so cold. Jaden in this movie he was so self considerate.I thought the ending of the movie was good.
B006WMILQU|5.0|I loved this movie and it opened doors to other movies that I had no idea about.  Some series that are on prime members flicks that are free.  Love it!
B00G32OER4|1.0|Once again a movie that did little to scare me.  Haven't we seen this same ole' scenario over and over again and again and again. There are so many other movies that do a better job of freaking you out.  This one was not the one. Once again-over and over and over and over.  We so need something new.
B002WJI66C|3.0|The product arrived after a month. Good quality, but it is smaller than what I expected. Completes the collection of Mario Bros but I will continue to look for one of higher quality.
B0033H7VI6|4.0|Knife and original packaging (a sturdy box) arrived in good order, extra fast. Like that a lot. The knife is a heavy-bladed, nicely-balanced (for my hand, anyway), sharp as sin outdoorsman's camp/trail/backcountry/survival tool. Like it a lot, going to find reasons to go into the woods for a day or two just to give it a workout, soon as I can.<br /><br />The sheath is so-so - don't think I'll keep it unless that's my only alternative. I really want to find someone who knows their way around leather working to make me a custom-fitted sheath out of a good tanned leather with a nice dark walnut stain and maybe a snap, or maybe just a deep well and a tight fit for retention. It would be great if Schrade would offer such an add-on ... dare to dream.<br /><br />Four stars for the knife, none for the sheath. And the strap - as near as I can tell, it was sewn on backwards. The snaps don't line up - they're back to back. The \\"female\\" end has to be doubled over backwards in order to line up with the \\"male\\" end. Sounds kinky, but rest assured, it is no fun and a lot of trouble to secure it. I may detach it and sew it back on the right way.
B00742H26M|5.0|This movie translates well to modern times in subject matter. Romantic without being sappy. Imperfect characters were played to perfection.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|At first, i thought this was just a game where you're stuck in a room with a box, but this actually proved me wrong! U have to use ur brains to figure out the puzzles, and it's awesome!!! U really gotta try this out!!!!
B00DC7NNAC|5.0|What a take on an old faithful.  Very upbeat, upscale and full of adventure.  We really enjoyed watching this one.  It was really different but very good.
B004S49YEM|5.0|1. Thoroughly enjoyed the book.<br />2. Plenty of mystery and intrigue<br />3. plus some romance thrown in!!<br />What more do you want????
B0020BUWX2|4.0|What a beautiful book! Mia, an interesting young woman who loses her family in a horrific car accident, is stuck between life and death. She gets to decide if she will stay with her remaining family and friends or join her immediate family in death. Mia's story alternated between present tense and in a series of flashbacks. Some of the most important points in Mia's life are reflected upon. We understand what makes Mia such an amazing, beautiful, young woman. And we find out if Mia will decide to stay or go....
B0012CJQY6|5.0|This is one of the top five tv shows ever not aired on the premium cable channels. Michael Chicklis is one of the best actors out there and played a great role as Vic Mackey
B001EC2ISA|3.0|I remember watching this years ago, and saw the PG rating, so we thought it would be fun to watch with our 9 year old.  While he heard the few choice bad words, and he didn't know what a couple of them meant, they are definitely not child friendly, including the F-bomb, so just a heads up.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I have been waiting and waiting to see what would happen and I am blown away. Veronica pulls you into the story. You connect with the characters and truly feel what she has written. I can not say enough about the Divergent trilogy and how much I have enjoyed reading it and how sad I am to see it end. Thank you Veronica Roth for providing such great literature to read :)
0823015033|5.0|So much information to help you better understand polymer clay and improve your skills while you makes beautiful treasures.  This is a good book.

B00A0MJA1I|5.0|Who does not love Peter Pan??  This is a great movie for boys and girls alike.  And Captain Hook is not too scary for little ones.
B00AF6MF9I|1.0|Been playing for almost a year and I have had enough. Time for me to uninstall and lose all my progress cause this game is so buggy. It consistently will not save my progress. Many features do not work properly.  The game has potential but gamesoft cannot or will not fix it. Fun to start but don't spend any money in the game.
B00001U03Q|5.0|This is the third CD of Clapton Chronicles that I have worn out. I love this CD. It is one of the best of Clapton's.
B003UESJFG|5.0|Bought this for my wife because its her favorite film of this type. Its super funny and will have you cracking up. The shipment arrived on time and as described.
B00CL0J99K|5.0|good movie, had seen the film and wanted to order it to have my collection and because the price is excellent for this combo that offers amazon.com
B004BSFC6Y|2.0|the items were fine, my children just were not interested in them much it was easier to just wait for them to find their feet on their own
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is one of those books that messes you up for awhile after you read it. Hazel is a 16 1/2 year old with has stage 4 Thyroid Cancer. She is taking a medication that has halted her cancer from growing further. She is slowly dying. She wears oxygen and cannot walk or stand for very long without feeling short of breath. She meets Agustus who is a 17 year old boy that was diagnosed with Osteosarcoma, had his leg amputated, and is in remission. This is their story.<br /><br />This book was so amazing I can't even put it into words. I was shocked when I scanned the reviews and saw a few bad reviews. One of them actually said that cancer has been overdone. Considering 1 in 2 will have a cancer diagnosis in their life, I don't think there are enough books where the main character is living with cancer. I feel sorry for the people that weren't affected by this book. How could you not?<br /><br />Some of my favorite quotes:<br />&#34;Mom sobbed something into Dad's chest that I wish I hadn't heard, and that I hope she never finds out that I did hear. She said, 'I won't be a mom anymore.' It gutted me pretty badly.&#34;<br /><br />&#34;'Okay, please draw a circle.' I did. 'Now draw a smaller circle within that circle'. I did. 'The larger circle is virgins. The smaller circle is seventeen-year-old guys with on leg.'&#34;<br /><br />&#34;'How are the eyes?' 'Oh excellent,' he said. 'I mean, they're not in my head is the only problem.' 'Awesome, yeah,' Gus said. 'Not to one-up you or anything, but my body is made out of cancer.'&#34;
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|it's just like the Candy Crush on my phone app.  No more dead battery on the phone. I love it
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so glad I can now play on my Kindle Fire !! Thank You ! It is great fun.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|No smut, no violence.  Nice story lines w closure of current escapade at the end of each episode.  Love the series.
B00E6Z0THE|2.0|When I was playing I got confused as to what to do. The hint were hard to follow. The graphics were very good and it started nice to work . I am tired of looking up hints.
B009LDD1X0|4.0|I thought Season Six of the Big Bang Theory was a little flat.  Other seasons were better.  Still my favorite show.
B004H4XDBI|4.0|The second book in the &#34;If I Stay&#34; series seems darker. Grittier. And it feels weird thinking that since in the first book Mia lost her entire family in a car accident. As the lone survivor, Mia spent most of the book in a coma reflecting on her life while trying to decide if she was going to die or live.<br /><br />But the second book is in Adam's point of view several and takes place several years after the first book ended. Adam has made it big as a rock star. But he is so utterly alone and depressed. He no longer has a normal, functional relationship with his band mates. He is barely existing.<br /><br />And by chance he runs into Mia in New York. They have 24 hours to spend together before they get pulled in opposite ways again.
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|I'd like to give this a better rating, but after repeated attempts to download and install this app, it never showed up. I've consulted with Kindle tech support (via the &#34;Mayday&#34; button), and they couldn't get it to work either. If you have a Kindle Fire HDX, you should probably skip this app for now.
B00F35BV64|5.0|Stayed edge of the seat all throughout. Khan was brilliant and so were the others. Amazon streaming rocks. I wish amazon video could support Chrome casting.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|It has enough Drama and no violence.  It is a innocent portrayal of human nature.  It is easy to relate to.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I haven't been more surprised by a book in quite a while. The title threw me, as I was sort of dubious - in fact I've passed over the book once before, then added it to my Goodreads 'to-read' at some point again. I've read the debates about the title, and decided that to me it doesn't matter, as once I read it, I didn't care.<br />It was great! The setting was pretty interesting, and I really enjoy the well-thought out layout of the little world constructed here. I felt that the author put the most detail into the characters and the local setting, as well as a slowly emerging overarching plotline. Less detail is paid to outside concerns, which doesn't bother me. In science fiction, there are always things that are inexplicable or confusing, or beyond us - it's futuristic science fiction, and comes with the territory. But the author does a good job of having at least a reasonable explanation for most things, and writes interesting characters. The few items that seem to be dubious character motivations or thoughts work themselves out in the plot, rather than proving to be actual problems.<br /><br />Great book, I'm most of the way into the second book now...
B00BTV62KG|5.0|Nice sweet sound.  Good stuff all around.  Nice listening to such well arranged and played music.  Would welcome more of the same.
0553382179|5.0|This author gets right to the point, where to start, what to do, and how to keep going!  It is the best book I have ever read on getting my home cleaned and organized.  SUPERBLY EASY PLAN and definitely an EASY READ.
B004LOMB2Q|1.0|This is one of the apps I really wanted for my new HDX, and on the sales page there is a box indicating that it's compatible with my device. However, it doesn't show up, and I can't even re-download because I get a message saying I already own it and I should look for it in my Library... and of course it's not there. I've just spoken with an Amazon tech guy who confirmed that it's NOT compatible with my HDX, so I've just wasted a lot of time and effort.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|A nail biter of a series.  If you haven't read the entire series yet, you're missing out one heck of a ride.  The Silo Saga starts with a bang and doesn't stop. Post-apocalyptic dangers abound of insular and insulated societies, being ultimately controlled, by the politicians who designed these complexes. Advanced nanotechnologies alternately keep people alive and well for prolonged periods of time and can decimated any given population at any time. Then there's Deep Freeze. I am not giving anything away in this review, except to say Read It. You won't be disappointed. Mr. Howey writes a well crafted, tightly plotted collection of interwoven stories that are guaranteed to give you nightmares of being chased up and down endless flights of stairs. There aren't too many stories I am reluctant to see end, but I was so taken by these characters, and cared about their plights I couldn't wait to see what would happen next.I was so glad to read \\"Wool\\" was been optioned by Ridley Scott to become a movie. I am happy for the author, the reading public and the movie makers, Fantastic..
B00AZMFK3K|1.0|That's NOT Kirk, that's NOT Spock, That's NOT Scotty. Zoe Saldana is a great actress and totally beautiful, but she's NOT Uhura. Respects to Karl Urban, who really is channeling a young Deforest Kelly, but he's the only bright spot in it. &#34;Wrath Of Kahn&#34; was the best Star Trek movie ever made, and DID NOT need a remake, especially one which destroys the original story. If these &#34;new Star Trek&#34; films had at least TRIED to stay with established story line and character history, I might have just gone with it, maybe even enjoyed it. But THIS thing should never have been made
B0030A0ZD4|5.0|Great movie! I always likes wwatching it when i was younger. Nobody does it better than Michael Jackson. The King of Pop
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|This would be a better game if they didn't keep trying to get you to spend money to beat the game.  Hate the bombs.
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|In this age when sputtering attempts at perpetuating the American mythology is paramount, detailed accounts of real history are priceless.<br />Thank you, Bill Bryson, for sharing the fruits of extensive research to lend us one tiny peek at what really happened in one moment in time in the history of America, and the world, for that matter.<br />To those not familiar with Bill Bryson's style, it is honest, thorough, humorous, immensely entertaining, and fearless in its attempt to relate as big a picture of the whole truth as possible.<br />His books in general, and this one in particular, are stories to savor.  No skimming or skipping through is ever desired with these reads.  There is more fascinating information, presented in such a charming colloquial style, on one page here than is found in entire chapters of lesser books by lesser authors.  Bill Bryson is great, and 1927 is one of his best.
B004EBZX6W|3.0|This is an edit of an earlier review. I previously reported that this app wouldn't work on the new Kindle HDX. It turns out that the HDX I had received was (very) defective. I've since received a replacement, and have gotten this app to work on it. The replacement Kindle is glitchy, but so far so good as far as this one app is concerned.
B00CS74W0C|5.0|I would definitely recommend this book for anyone you loves passion and a storyline that makes you love the characters involved.
0525953728|1.0|Gripping tale about an outlandish yarn about the demise of a modern-day bogey man.  Why did all the SEALs that went on this mission die right afterwards?  Osama had died in 2002, but miraculously and magically came back to life and healed himself fom the deadly Marphans Syndrome.  BS!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gone Girl is one of those books that keeps you thinking about it and examining your own character and inner thoughts long after you put it down - if you can put it down.  It is well written and I can't say more because it would give the story away.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Not fair to compare this to the shining as nearly 40 years have passed and it's not the and kind of book. This novel read fast and kept my attention. Good story development and many characters to both like and despise and that is key to a good book. No one wants a story about middle people that you can't relate to or hate...
B007T8BYWE|5.0|Not hard to figure out. But still challenging and fun. Kind of addictive! Very easy to spend way too many hours playing this game.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|you don't want to put it out of your hand once you started reading. a great continuation of the previous books that leaves you wanting to know how the story ends.
B00821OX98|5.0|Excellent series, I am glad to be able to watch it on prime for free now, I had forgotten how everything began
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love this game it challenging,  play it with my granddaughter,  like that it has so many different levels. great game.
B00EPG591K|5.0|I have had this app for a little over week and am completely satisfied with it. I bought the paid version almost right away, partly to get rid of the ads and partly to pay the designers for something that really works. I especially like that it's not busy or gimmicky or loaded with 10,000 features I don't need.<br /><br />The alarm works fine and is easy to set. I mostly use the analog display. However, I play organ for my church and have found that the digital display works great for timing preludes (the music you hear before the service starts). I can prop my phone on the edge of the music rack and see at a glance how close I am to the start of the service. Most organists have a clock but what I like about this one is that it's right next to the music, I can put it away when the service starts, and it's simple and elegant enough that if someone else sees it it doesn't look out of place.<br />  g
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|my game was going great until level 50. but now it wont let me continue.  It doesn't matter how many people help me the game just keeps me at level50. I think I'm done with this game.
0385333846|5.0|Slaughterhouse Five is often said to be one of the greatest antiwar books in history, and after having read the book, I have to agree. Most authors would have no idea how to write a book about both time-traveling aliens and the firebombing of Dresden, yet Kurt Vonnegut pulls it off beautifully.<br /><br />Billy Pilgrim is a human with a unique ability: he can \\"jump\\" through time. He lives his life in constant uncertainty, never sure which moment of his life he will live next. One thing that does seem certain, however, is his return to World War II. No matter the moment in his life, whether it be optometrist in his office, bridegroom on his wedding night, or half-senile patient in a hospital, one thing is constant: he returns to his life as a young soldier.<br /><br />This shows Vonnegut's mastery of literature perfectly. Just like many soldiers in World War II, Billy is forced to constantly relive the darkest time of his life as a soldier on the front. Billy experiences death, trauma, and the massacre of the people of Dresden first hand, and he does so constantly, his experiences returning to him and forcing him to relive them constantly. Vonnegut parallels the fictional Billy's struggles to those of many real soldiers who dealt with post-traumatic stress disorder for decades after the end of the war.<br /><br />Slaughterhouse Five is Vonnegut at his best, combining the absurdity of science fiction with the harsh truth that is reality into a story that is funny, sad, and definitely worth the read.
B001G8WBNO|5.0|Reading The Girl with The Pearl Earring  was like eating a small box of fine chocolates.  I could not put it down.Tracy Chevalier's jewel of a book is so descriptive of 16th century life. I'm an art student and reading about how Vermeer made his pigments was so very interesting.  Anyone wwho is curious about the lives of the Old Masters would do well to enjoy this small, elegant little book.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Loved this game. I was looking for something other than your typical game that would make me use my brain a  bit and this was perfect. Challenging but not too hard. Wish some of the  puzzles were a little longer but still enjoyed it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Good product,<br />More features are required to take full advantage of the product.<br />OTG cable is need to properly initialise it.
B004LROUNG|1.0|This is certainly not the quality of writing that John Grisham is famous for.  I slogged through the first half hoping that it would finally break out into an interesting story.  Nope!  I gave up and went to another book.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|The Doctor is great and the kids love the show too!  We are flying through the time (seasons) in our TARDIS.
B0084AZXKK|4.0|The book is very amazing. You should really try it! It's an incredible start of adventure that I highly recommend
B00C6F619Q|5.0|I forgot how suspenseful and creepy this movie is! Especially that it was made before September 11!! Joan Cusack is memorable in this movie and totally out of her usual character.
006202406X|1.0|Let me start off with saying that I LOVE Veronica Roth. I got to meet her in SF, and I abs adore her. I respect her as an author, and understand that it is her story. However, her fans are the reason these books even become popular, and she let us down. I was looking forward for Allegiant since I loved Divergent and Insurgent. The plot had way too many storylines and I felt it was all crammed into one book just so it would be finished. At some points I found myself bored and it was difficult to pay attention. With her other books, I was dying to read the next page and I usually could not put them down. With Allegiant, I just wanted to finish it so I could be done with it. It was not a turn pager for me and I was so disappointed. The whole GP vs GD concept was boring, and came out of nowhere.  I think Veronica Roth steered into the wrong direction with this book and did not stick to the original premise of the story. I get it she was trying to be bold with Tris's death and different, but her death was just predictable. It was just like Insurgent when Tris wanted to sacrifice herself for the greather good, and she got to fulfill that dream in this book. It would have been refreshing to see Caleb stepping in last minute and killing David before he killed Tris and proving that he was morally strong like his sister. Killing Tris was just unnecessary and stupid in my opinion. There were too many losses especially for Christina, and nothing was really learned from Tris's death. Veronica Roth truly disappointed me with this book, and I will NOT be reading it again.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Okay, yeah, the ending sucked. I understand it, but I didn't like it. That being said, it was honestly the only interesting part of this book. The whole awful thing was boring, unorganized, and quite frankly I didn't understand the first half of the book or what the heck was going on.<br />The idea was okay, but the back up of how they got there was unreasonable and unbelievable.<br />The excitement from the first two stories was not there, each \\"exciting\\" scene was rushed through and I literally found myself skipping paragraphs just to get to the ending where I could find out what all the hype was about.<br />Ugh..I read this in another review and I totally agree, come up with your own ending, or better yet, just freakin skip the first 35 chapters.<br />I am left with sadness that I waited so long for this book to come out...I now wish I would have just forgot about it.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|It was a good season. I loved it. Couldn't wait to get the DVD set because I love watching the gag reel as much as re-watching some of my favorite and not so favorite episodes. Must have for Supernatural fans.
B00DIFARQ6|4.0|I'm a private pilot and have experienced many landings in all types of weather.<br />This app is realistic on the kindle fire hd. The control s are sensitive much like the real control in the cockpit. I only wish they would provide the option of removing  the heads-up display. Only the modern, sophisticated planes have this. Typically you land by sight and proper airspeed control with one hand on the wheel. One on the throttle.
B005P1YCNK|5.0|Easy read. Poignant and true.  I felt as if he was speaking straight to me at some points.  Cannot wait to start compounding my life.
B005GY0Y8S|3.0|Story line was pretty good.  What drove me nuts and hobbled my ability to enjoy the book, was the poor grammar and misspellings.  Perhaps they had no editor?
B004PGO25O|5.0|This is the exact &#34;kick in the pants&#34; anyone needs when coming up against resistance. After reading this, I feel like I have the tools I need to properly slay the dragon.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Really enjoyed this book. Liked how everyone tied in somehow. Kept me interested, and really leaves you wondering what you would do in that same situation.
B008LXZFH6|2.0|After seeing the Ram Truck commercials recently, I thought this would really be funny.  It didn't even come close to my expectations.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Most of the elements that kept me from putting Divergent down were altogether missing from Allegiant. The narrative was monotonous, the dialogue was robotic, and the only event that brought out any kind of emotional reaction in me seemed pointless. Suspending disbelief isn't usually a problem for me, but I found myself repeatedly thrown out of the story, questioning things that didn't make sense. I find it hard to believe this book was written by the same author as the first two.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I was glad to finally get this game on my Kindle Fire!!!!! It is fun give it a try. Download it from the games tab today!
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Although this ending is very sad. Which it was. I couldn't have imagined a better way to finish off the series. The author did a great job and I'm glad I can say I finished it.
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|It's very fun besides the fact that you just have to buy everything in the game just to have what you want.
B00CFYAT6O|1.0|I don't know why Susan needs to sing on every song as she really detracts from the music.  I am disappointed with this CD.
1878424750|4.0|It is a good cd to listen to and I enjoy it!!<br />I would recommend it for anyone to listen to.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This app is very well made. I has lots of features that you don't normally see in a keyboard. You can adjust the size, themes, and language. It learns your typing patterns from different sources so it saves you a lot of time typing. It's very responsive as well. II've never typed faster than I have with this keyboard. I really do recommend it.
B00E7NIMZ6|5.0|I love Hans Zimmer. Probably 90% of all of my movies soundtracks are Hans Zimmer and they are all epic and amazing. Rush is no different. He captured the movie so well in the music. The intensity of the movie shows in a lot of the songs. And then there are songs that were character moments and whether it was Niki or James he was trying to show, the music is there for it. Simply amazing. Hans Zimmer never disappoints.
B00881VLCE|3.0|I really liked this app and had purchased several new puzzles.  then they did an update and now it doesn't load.  I unistalle it and tried to reinstall it.  still doesn't work and I also lost all the puzzles I had purchased.  I feel ripped off.  don't get it untill they fix it.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Shopped around for this set and found it significantly cheaper than Wal-Mart, best buy and other local stores. The movies look incredible in blue ray.
B00007LTIA|5.0|This moves me beyond words....simply mesmerizing. A magnificent journey through time. Performance and recording are as good as it gets.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I could not put the book down.  I thought Veronica stayed true to who the characters were.  I loved the message that she was trying to portray.  I thought it was very thought provoking and definitely a conversation starter for sure.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham has a talent for writing about honest lawyers and down and out clients.  You end up living with them through Grisham's words, feeling their pain, and wanting the best for everyone.  I have loved all of his novels and look forward to his next one.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|Love this show. I would recomend it to all who like a good laugh. Waiting for the next season to come out. I can watch it over and over.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|my 5-year-old son is sort of a pixar snob, and is pretty particular about his movies.  he loved this, quoting, &#34;it was soooo funny.&#34;  he watched it with a sitter, and now i'm wishing we would have bought it instead of renting on amazon!
B00F35B8F8|2.0|This was same old thing with a feeble story line.  If you are a Treki it may appeal to you but if not don't bother watching
B0030V0PEW|5.0|Very helpful in remembering to cover the basics in an increasingly complex world. It is especially interesting since the author is a surgeon, a profession not well know for correction. Very good read.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it its the best thing ever. people make there own world and can be creative. I Love IT
B0032CVAQQ|3.0|This was an interesting book and did give me some insight on the various love languages discussed. It helped me to understand how my husband shows and likes to receive love. While we speak different languages it's nice to know that it is just our mire ignorance stopping us from communicating effectively and showing one another love. While reading this book I began to think back on the things he loved most or showed the most appreciation to, and began doing them more often. At the conclusion of reading this book he took the love language quiz for me and I was spot on! I'll keep these  things in mind!
B00CMQX84A|5.0|My Grandson (7years old) just loves it. He likes the music and plays it two or three times in a row.
B003Y5H5FG|4.0|...to make it worthwhile.<br /><br />The original \\"Fright Night\\" from 1985 was a fun horror film with a half-serious, half-campy vibe. Its strengths were a great story, an excellent (and hideous) vampire, Roddy McDowall as Peter Vincent and an entertaining air. There was a quasi-remake in 2008 called \\"Never Cry Werewolf\\", which (obviously) traded the vampire for a werewolf; it was a quality remake with the variation of a female protagonist (Nina Dobrev) and Kevin Sorbo in the McDowall role.<br /><br />This 2011 official remake features Colin Farrell as the vampire. It has the same plot, but there's enough variation in the details to make it a quality remake. Instead of the Los Angeles area (or an Eastern city in \\"Never Cry Werewolf\\"), this one takes place in a small desert community outside Las Vegas (and was shot in Vegas and New Mexico). I can't say that Farrell is a better vampire than Chris Sarandon (or the werewolf in \\"Never Cry Werewolf\\", Peter Stebbings), but he's just as good in his own unique way, although the F/X aren't as good when the vampire morphs into its most hideous self.<br /><br />Anton Yelchin shines as the teen who is astonished to discover that a vampire is living next door. Seriously, Yelchin is a surprisingly excellent protagonist. Toni Collette as his mother and Imogen Poots as his girlfriend offer strong support. These three take the material seriously and are contrasted by Christopher Mintz-Plasse, who takes a campy approach, and Colin, who opts for lower camp like Sarandon in the original.<br /><br />The weak point of the original was Amanda Bearse (\\"Marcie\\" from Married With Children). Don't get me wrong, she was her typical fun, likable self, but she didn't cut it as a hot female protagonist (then again, maybe the filmmakers weren't shooting for that). Poots, Collette and Sandra Vergara as Ginger -- Peter Vincent's babe -- deliver the goods here. However, David Tennant isn't anywhere near as strong in the McDowell (or Sorbo) role. Why? Because Peter Vincent in the remake is just a sad alcoholic who's hiding out as a Vegas entertainer, trying to drown out his grief. Tennant's fine in this role, but the character, as-written, isn't as strong.<br /><br />In any case, 2011's \\"Fright Night\\" is an entertaining horror flick. It's not actually scary due to the semi-goofiness, but it's very amusing and thrilling.<br /><br />The film runs 106 minutes.<br /><br />GRADE: B+Because Peter Vincent in the remake is just a sad alcoholic who's hiding out as a Vegas entertainer, trying to drown out his grief.

B009EHDU7U|4.0|A funny story based on the life experiences of the centenarian and his unusual adventures.  He goes on a new adventure when he leaves the aged home and accidentally gets involved in a criminal activity which works in his favour.  It's full of interesting characters and laugh out loud moments.
B008JFUO72|5.0|Awesome movie, a must see for fans of IronMan movies. As for comic book fans, well, just enjoy it. Even if it doesn't follow the comics that well. But still a good movie to watch.
B00FWLTPU8|4.0|my family loved it!! the graphics were amazing!! and it also had alot of great actors!! we will be watching this one alot!!
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Skipped all the wife input. Just couldn't stomach all the drama that she adds to the narrative of the book.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love it.  I was waiting for this game to come to kindle. Now I don't have to play it in my phone.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|GREAT game!!!! I have been waiting on this game for a long time.  Thanks Kindle for making this available..now where is Pet Rescue Saga?
B001U7ADZ4|5.0|Best one is my opinion. I listen to it over and over. I would recommend it to anyone.  Good price and value
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Google is by far the best internet app. I do not like complicated app. Always Google takes me where I want to go,answers my questions.I love it!
B007IV1E2W|5.0|The first season was so so, the doctor gave off a pedo vibe, but once David Tennant shows up the show crazy awesome!
B00004RF9B|5.0|Forbidden Planet was a great movie for cheap entertainment. The special  affects were pretty good also. A nice movie to add to your collection.
006202406X|2.0|I was heartbroken at the end of the book, like many! But I do have to say, since I finished the book (completely angry and balling immediately after)...I have been reading all the reviews people have posted and I am pretty comforted by the fact that I was not the only one affected by this book as I was.  I do have to give Veronica Roth credit, even though many of us were upset and angry with the ending, if this book can touch us emotionally to that level, then obviously she is a wonderful writer!  I mean the first 2 books were AMAZING!!!  I just wish that if one was going to die, they both would have and maybe instead of her mother coming for her, Tobias could have been waiting for her (I thought it was pretty cruel that after all Tobias had experienced in life, that this had to be tacked onto it, breaking him even more)...or maybe Caleb could have realized how much he loved her and saved her at the last moment, proving he wasn't a coward and that he wouldn't let her die! There is just so many ways this book could have ended and still had just as much impact, drama and shock value, yet still keep all of us wanting to reread the series over and over and be anxiously awaiting the movie!! I personally, was so so excited to receive this last book and looked forward to turning around and rereading the whole series several more times, but it is hard to reread or even look forward to the movie now that I know she dies...it just kind of killed it for me! :(  I am really hoping when the soft back copy is released, maybe there could be an alternate ending added. Give us readers our own \\"Choosing Ceremony\\" where we can chose which ending we want to close the book with (tragic or HEA). I think giving us an alternate ending would renew (those of us that hated the ending and that refuse to reread it) our love of this Great series and make us all wait anxiously for the movie to come out!!  Plus, all of us \\"My life is ruined because of the ending of this book\\" people, will gladly go out and buy another copy so that we can get an ending that will leave us with a sense of hope and keep the feeling of Tris and Tobias's amazing love burning in our hearts! :)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I tried and tried to get this on my kindle! Ended up buying a nook, only to see after that purchase now they it for my kindle! Oh well, still love them both.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've been playing Candy Crush Saga on my laptop for quit sometime, and was so excited to finally get it on my Kindle Fire!  Works great!!
B00E8AVNBI|3.0|I wanted to like this movie but found it to be a bit corney, its obvious they wanted it to be somewhat like pale rider or high plains drifter and they failed miserably. The gimmick gun danny trejo has, serves absolutely no purpose other than they wanted to put some gimmick weaponry in this film, the story could have been so much better. And why would the devil need some one to kill all the bad guys? they were going to hell anyways. Makes no sense. really disappointed. just rent it instead. Watch Pale rider if u want a revenge film with good story, acting , and dialog. If you just want flash crap watch this then.
B0042FZWC0|5.0|I was raised in the South, where you do what you're told and don't color outside the lines.  After that kind of upbringing, I would now say I'm a &#34;recovering conformist&#34;.  I'm getting ready to move across the country, no job set up to date, just because that is where I've always wanted to live.  I've had so much anxiety about the move, but reading this book has given me the confidence I needed to push forward.  I hadn't even told my Dad I was moving for fear I'd hear his wrath, but after about half of this book I was ready to confront him.  I've always done what you're &#34;supposed&#34; to do, and while I'm relatively happy, I've never even considered doing what I WANT to do.  This book basically says, there's no right way to do anything - so make your own path, and that's exactly what I intend to do.
B00005JOHC|5.0|I give it a seven star. The sell was very good to business  and it was good entertainment. I laugh so much it well worth the money.
B009O2XY12|1.0|I thought it would just be nice to have a silly game on my Kindle but found I played it 3 or 4 times and could not load it again. Deleted it as I cannot be bothered with something that did not work.  Sticking to Tetris and Soduko!
B00006AW2F|4.0|I am glad to have this, probably the strangest Rolling Stones release ever. Many of the tracks, perhaps about half of them, are Jagger/Richards demo tracks without the other Stones. The other approximate half is compiled from Rolling Stones outtakes from the Abkco / Decca period.<br /><br />It's not entirely fair to say that this is only for serious, seasoned RS fans. I am a casual fan of the Stones. I am unfamiliar with at least half of their catalog (especially from 1980 to the present). But I still enjoy this one. And I do remember seeing a full page advert (was it in Melody Maker or Record Mirror?) which had the Rolling Stones telling everyone not to buy this, as it was not officially sanctioned by the band.<br /><br />\\"Metamorphosis\\" delivers sub-standard but still pretty good Rolling Stones songs. Accepted for what it is, this is a nice addition to my RS collection. It's not essential by any means...But I'm not parting with my copy!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Very easy to set up, transmission and image on TV are perfect.<br />Excellent product.<br />Tested with android phone and laptop.
B000H30B2C|5.0|I enjoyed Peter Jackson's version of this classic.  Kong's animation & emotions were very clever & well done.  I really liked the new take on the relationship between Kong & Naomi Watts character.
B002KDUDG6|5.0|Michael Buble captures perfectly the sound of the Sinatra Era! It made me buy/download some Sinatra songs! He is a class act! Great collection of songs!
B009PMEEY2|5.0|engrossing and fun game.<br /><br />once played through, is fun to return to.<br /><br />a good game for newbies to a touch screen - gives a bit of leeway as far as accurate finger placement goes.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Great sound. They're comfortable and sturdy. I work in a pretty noisy environment and they provide ample enough, passive noise cancelling. You really can't beat it for the price.
0307010856|5.0|This is a great book.  The best way to read it is to read it TO the child with appropriate &#34;dramatic&#34; expression.  It teaches reasoning, sequencing, and all with a hilarious spin that will have you and your child laughing.  It's a wonderful book to experience together.
B00FRMCYQ4|3.0|I found it entertaining but I dont think i will ever watch again. The one liners get repeated by children therefor memorable.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I think this game is AWESOME I always want to play games like this I wish I can get inside buildings like a house or a cafe if you can and I didn't know tell me and I wish they have more scribblenauts games and more different looks.
B000JPRPAO|4.0|I often find myself watching this when I need something exciting, amusing and predictable.  It's exactly the correct mix of all those things and I've watched it many times over.
B008IJTFYW|3.0|Love the combos of sound.  Fun to play with.<br /><br />Sleep timer works great.<br /><br />But the program only runs as long as it's the only program open.  If I go to look at pics, or have a look at my mail, or open a book to read while listening, the sound goes away.  :(<br /><br />Still, great as a stand-alone program.  Nice interface.  relaxing sounds.  Adds nice ambiance to my cubicle at work to leave it playing while I'm working-- the Kindle is so slim, it slides into my bookshelf &#34;disappears&#34; from sight, so the rare person who notices my white noise has no clue where it could be coming from.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I bought this just to try it out. Everyone in my family loved it.<br />The quality is great for streaming and desktop sharing.<br />We used desktop sharing to watch cartoon episodes from websites like NIck.com and even used it for netflix movies.<br /><br />Its super easy to use once set up and everyone in my family now uses it.
B001XUH69Y|5.0|One of my top 10 movies.  There are so many famous lines in this movie.  Here is looking at you kid.
B00499NHLC|4.0|Great stuff! Really enjoyed it a lot. Good old English entertainment. Well worth a watch whether you like the original or not
B001LM1456|4.0|Awesome flick. Loved the CGI and the way B. Banner's story was summarized. The Hulk is one of my favorite super heroes of all time
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Easy to install, easy to use, cheap... Just wish you could use more than Netflix or YouTube with it right now.
B00EAIMGDW|3.0|Sadly the game exits when when I try to play one of the levels. It was fun until then :/
B00F91G5BS|3.0|Although there is a lot of edge of the seat moments in this movie, the plot is getting to be a bit over done and predictable.  The actors do a good job.<br /><br />Downloaded this to TiVo to watch and the pixels broke up several times throughout the film.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So excited that I can play Candy Crush saga on my Kindle!!! Now how about Pet Rescue Saga? Thank you!!!
B0065GC0BA|5.0|A clever, funny and beautiful story. Really made me think about the key issues (don't want to give the story away here...)
B00985E3UG|5.0|It's rare that I get through some of these longer nonfiction books finding that the authors seem to fill the pages with repetitive information so much that I lose interest midway through, but this book was so thoroughly engaging, interesting, and well written I could hardly put it down.  It will make you angry and feel manipulated, but it gives fair representation to the problems the processed food industry faces as well with pressure from investors for profits and from good tasting, convenient, and cheap foods.
B00FPH6AXE|5.0|good movie I loved will son he was outstanding in his role. that is the way to teach your son to be indepented.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|a very challenging fun game that helps build your ability to focus and work fast. Each game gets more intense as you go as fast as you possibility can to match all the tiles and do it in as little time as you can.
B002MG2RG0|2.0|The movie ended before the credits. Watching a movie and then not getting see the end is like someone ripping out the last pages of a book you are reading.
B00DH1G7DS|5.0|I'm not a fanatic soduco master, I just like relaxation that comes with some brain exercise. This program runs smooth and was easy to play right out of the install. Well written and thought out.
B002Y3I2B0|5.0|Classic woody. Fantastic movie and interesting plot.<br />Makes me want to travel to Spain and build a darkroom in my basement...
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Grisham at his very best. All the twists and turns that keep us reading Grisham, but none more powerful than this. Thank you, John.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much. The plot was very.intriguing!  I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a great suspense and action pact read!
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|Choose Yourself!  Two simple yet profound words.  This book helped me clear my thinking and refocus on what is important to me.<br /><br />I recommend you take the time to read and digest this book.  Then make the decision to choose yourself.
B005HED11Y|5.0|The start of a great empire!!! I will watch every episode of all the series! Now I have to find the episode when the go back to this planet...
B000FA5TTW|5.0|Very interesting and detailed. This book an at times sad however I could not put it down until the very end I recommend to all true readers.
B00G32TD98|4.0|The direction in this film was good and the music was creepy. A little sensational at times, but overall a good spooky flick.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Music and graphics are wonderful and I really enjoyed immersive feel. Just wish<br />there were a few riddles or more complex puzzles thrown in.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|This cleverly-written &#34;dramedy&#34; has become our favorite Amazon stream.  The banter between the cast, the amazing costuming and never-ending surprises leaves us anxious to watch every episode.  We highly recommend this show!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So happy it is finally here on kindle fire!  Great game. No pressure playing, just fun.  A  little slow on getting tickets to play on, synching  to Facebook doesn't work all the time.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I really enjoy candy crush saga its a fun entertaining way to pass my free time.I find this and challenging and fun
B00CH26TL8|5.0|Love this game. Easy at times but still difficult to keep you challenged.<br />I wish there were combination balls though. That would be great
B0035QUXWQ|5.0|Good movie period. HD or not. One of the best ever. I have always enjoyed this movie. Tom Hanks is great.
B00FEHXISA|5.0|I don't know how they keep on living up to the hype. I just can't think of goofy Happy as the executive producer. Keep up the good entertainment.
B00AM0C6YG|5.0|A very unique sounding first album by Laura Mvula.  I saw her on Letterman's show and had to have the album.  Well worth it!
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I love this game, it's so addicting!! The only problem I have is when I get on my lap top to play I have 80 + lives....when I get on my Kindle to play, I only have 5 lives. Why can't the kindle &#34;show&#34; or &#34;pick&#34; up all my lives like my lap top?
B000U0F7RG|5.0|All the episodes are present in this collection.  There are also a lot of special features in every season.  The visual and audio quality of the DVDs are excellent.  This is a great set, and the case makes it compact, saving you a great deal more space than buying each season individually.  Well worth the purchase!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun to play, addictive, topical, great graphics, and FREE.  I suggest everyone give this app a shot.  I liked this app so much I even wrote my first app review about it.
B006AZZPCM|2.0|it wont install on my kindle fire (first edition). Amazons compatibility tick of approval on the download page obviously doesn't cover all the variables. It simply downloads but refuses to install.
006202406X|1.0|I am a reader, not a writer, so see other reviews - I agree with all of them! So disappointed!
B00G32OER4|5.0|This was more scary than I expected, jumped out of my seat quite a few times! Well worth the money.
B007R41E8O|5.0|This is a great game! Lots of fun! Keeps my interest! There's never a dull moment! I'm very excited to play the other twisted land games!
B00FPH6AXE|1.0|It wasn't good. Jaden smith'a acting was bad. Will smith did NOT have an active role in the movie. There wasn't a real ending
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Best Steven King in years!! I always wondered what happened to little Danny Torrence from the Shining. Now I know. Great book and a must read for all King fans!
006202406X|2.0|In the first two books I loved the drama that the author created in the relationship between Tris and Four.  In this third book, Tobias's perspective somehow took all the mystery, drama and romance away from the story.  Their relationship turned alternately boring and corny.  Compared to the first two books, there were no thrilling and interesting roadblocks in their relationship.  Instead, it was regular old couples therapy.  Basically, what made the first books good were the roadblocks and reunions between Tris and Four.  In this book, I suffered through the whole thing - finally got to one genuine roadblock at the end- and alas no reunion.  There were definitely some inconsistencies with the characters as well.  Tobias didn't seem like the same character and the turn around with his Mom was not believable.  Also, by this time the constant added cracks about the faction personalities got old.  I really really did enjoy book one and two though.
B00ARF93AQ|5.0|Forget that this is a remake of cheesy Stallone  action flic from the 90s. Theres is no resemblance to that piece of garbage. This flim is just bad ass. The most pure action film since The Terminator. Give it a shot
B00DBSZ6ZC|5.0|It sounds like it would be silly but this was actually a really good movie!! Lots of action and great special effects, my whole family liked it!
B009HNDCC4|5.0|Highly recommend for anyone with a sense of humor, or who enjoys laughing at theselves because we are all characters of this show
B002VRNR1Y|5.0|What more can you ask for ; a steven king story and Jack Nicholson . A must for movie buffs . Amazon streaming movies are the best !!!
B0089LOG02|4.0|This was written so you want to keep reading. I liked the way the generations intermingled too help each other. A good way to tell a sad part of history that we need to know about. Definitely a don't judge a book by it's cover story.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Perfect way to wind down after a long day of work. I only wish that there were more levels to play
B00FWLDHSY|4.0|pretty action packed - kind of a mix between Avatar, Iron man, Transformers and Independence Day. Overall a pretty good show.
B00F91H666|5.0|I love everything zombie related, and this movie didn't let me down! Very creepy zombies and a great story line, my whole family loved it!
B007ZUX8CK|5.0|After returning a less-than-satisfactory copy of this book, I was sent a pristine copy which arrived by express mail in just two days after I asked for a new copy. Since it is to be a gift for my favorite little boy, I wanted it to be perfect, which it is.
B00A287PG2|5.0|There have been many stories on the power of McKinsey and its brand. Having been a client of McKinsey's, I have the other view of them. They are sea gulls, just like all consulting firms - they swoop in and crap all over the place, leaving a stinking pile behind. The author shows both the successes and the failures of McK - that is a good thing. Consultants are rarely successful in their endeavors, and the client usually is left with the mess. This book demonstrates that aspect.<br /><br />But the author tells of successes for the client as well, and why the client was able to achieve the success - guess what it is not all McKinsey !! Read this book and take away the lessons on how the consultant and the client can achieve a successful outcome.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun game..very addicting! Love playing it in my kindle! Even though you have to wait a bit if you die before you can play, the time limit isn't as bad as other games.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Not quite as cleverly constructed as The Juror or The Pelican Brief and not quite as emotionally involving as A Time to Kill, but all in all, a satisfying read. Grisham went back to what he does best- small town Southern lawyer up against bigger firm with lots of resources, but stumbles onto the facts that can win the case through relationships based on his continued faith in mankind.<br />Keep writing stories like this, Mr Grisham and I'll keep buying your books.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I think this app has addictive gaming,is a great game to play when your waiting, and there is nothing violence at all.<br />best app ever
B000E97X66|5.0|It was the late 70's.  I had heard lots of Springsteen on the radio, but I was not big fan.  Then, one night after work I heard a live concert on a regional broadcast from Cleveland.  I was hooked. It was easily the best live performance I had heard.  Still is.  This 2 CD concert set captures most of the same brilliance I heard that night.  What a songwriter.  What a performer.  And if there is a band that is better than that original E Street Band, I have not heard it.  I would give this more stars if I could.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|While at times Sheryl's anecdotes seem insignificant, focusing on the everyday moments, it is her honesty about those small struggles as a woman at the top that teach our entire gender about our inherent bias. We often get in our own way on the climb to the top.<br />Sheryl is the role model young women deserve, because she says what many of us are thinking. She stands up for the values that will improve our economy and our society. It's that big picture message that steers the book towards a tone of progress.<br />I finished this book feeling empowered by her message of leadership, persistence, and success. This book could have been a lot of things, I found it wonderful, honest, and thought provoking. I think we all deserved to hear this message.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Wow!!!!!! So good but so sad in the end! Such a great book! I cried st the end! I would definitely recommend this book.
1419705644|4.0|I liked the book because it is a creative way to explain many things in the world of Ooo.<br />It's a different perspective, the narration is done by Hunson Abaader and is fun, but sometimes this means that he is a friend of Marceline, not work that way in the cartoon.<br /><br />About the secrets of Ooo, there is nothing new that can be read, Adventure Time Wikia explains much more than this book.<br /><br />But the book is funny, it shows a lot of character, explains the kingdoms of Ooo so good. Abaader Hunson know much about The Land of Ooo and reflects hatred around the world and talks like a man, a king almighty.<br /><br />The graphics are the best, they are perfect and Fionna and Cake section is so original.<br /><br />I really recommend this book, but do not expect new information or additional data for which are presented in the cartoon.
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|Can't figure out how to add text on the slides. Seems like there has got to be a way to do so but cannot figure it out yet.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Great series! I was introduced by a friend to this and I am glad that my buddy suggested this show.  !!1!
1439102813|5.0|Great book, a &#34;page turner&#34;.  Helps you understand someone with AD, and what they go through. This is a must read
B001CEE1YE|5.0|Loved the whole concept of the movies. Set up to be possibly continued. Would love to see more episodes about the future of the matrix.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|Great book, great story line, great writer!!!<br />Once I started to read, it was very hard to put down.  Main character is a real character!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I really liked the book. The whole psychological process by passing both characters, full recovery, relationships with family and friends, and together they finally manage to find which required stability.<br /><br />It is a different perspective of a person following an emotional shock or emotional crisis and as slowly struggle with that and be reinserted into society without being identified.<br /><br />The film personally do not like, is a totally different context to the book and the sequence of events is not the same.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Cool game, not as addicting as people make it seem, but still cool. Yea yea yea come on yellow button
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Because my FB friends play and so does my daughter (who is Autistic)...I am challenged with every level, but that is what makes it a great game!
0143124544|5.0|Read this book within a day because it was a slow day at work. Easy to read and keeps the reader engaged.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|Wow! The whole family was riveted to the television screen for the entire movie. Awesome special effects and non-stop suspense. Highly recommend World War Z
0545265355|4.0|This book set came as described. Great price!!!<br /><br />We ended up returning the item as we bought it as a gift but recipient already had one of the books.
B004YW4L5K|4.0|After having to read American Gods for an English class, the first thought I had once I finished the story was: wow, I actually finished. The next was obviously that the ending was phenomenal. Gaiman is a very talented writer with a lot of interesting ideas. I really did enjoy this book, but be weary about its size. Its supposed to be long and 'bumbling', so keep that in mind.
0920236162|1.0|Just because you want the princess to be unconcerned about the other people's opinions about her, does not mean that such a lame story is created. Lame ending ... Lame beginning and lame story... I wish I could give it a negative rating...
B00ESY7QXI|3.0|I ordered this movie to watch on a cross country plane ride.  It did the job of keeping me entertained throughout most of the movie. It started off a little slow, but picked up near the middle.  All in all, worth a watch.
B008EEZ64Y|4.0|What a nice change of pace it was to read this short novel. I am not typically a fan of science fiction but I felt this was more a philosophical book than anything else. I wish I was back in college and could debate the underlining meaning of living in a society void of emotion and independence.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I like the game but I would like to be able to win once in awhile. Maybe if you get at a higher lever this will happen but I don't know that. good buy.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I really like this app  because its helping me learn English a little bit more. But I think this app is meant for people who know the basics of whatever language they are trying to learn. To those people, I fully recommend this app.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Beautiful scenery, and pictures, I am not a hunter  of any animal, I want to see if i can do this.
B002Y0KTW8|3.0|Cause I wanted to. Why else would I rate it giving it the rating I gave it? Sheesh, for such a huge company you sure do ask some stupid questions.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|They had me right up to the end. I like that. I reccommend this movie to anyone who likes to be held in their seats.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I love this game. It goes as fast as you want it to. never a dull moment.Best buy I ever made.
B00FWLDHSY|3.0|Might work better on the big screen or might have regretted paying to see it in a theater.  Entertaining, but didn't wow me.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love this game, love the challenge of making all the cards fit and if they don't at first find a way if possible.
B00G32OER4|5.0|This one kept us on the edge of our seats.it was predictable at times but still a great movie.i would recommend this if you enjoy the paranormal type.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|The trilogy was wonderful until the end. Broke my heart when Tris died. Wish I could go back and unread it.
B008XG1X18|2.0|I have not used this much to get used to it so I can't truefuly rate it but I understand it is a great place to go. I need to learn more about what it is about.
B00ECU2RGY|2.0|Overly complicated, with poor acting and a weird story line. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. Watch something else.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great Game I really enjoy it only thing is updates kind of move slow but other than that great game for all ages
B009NXV2RK|4.0|Typical Clancy - great idea, well written and unbelievably well researched. Sometimes too much detail - almost getting the way of the flow.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I reserve the right to give a five star rating only to truly excellent and exceptional books that come along very rarely. Therefore this is  five star rating for me. It was a page turner and I  recommend it to every-one of my  lady friends. I intend to purchase it as gifts for birthdays, Christmas and for friends convalescing.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|First and foremost, if your thinking $2.99 is a lot to spend on an app you'd probably be right in most cases, but completely wrong in this instance. In a lot of ways three dollars is a steal when you see all of the time this developer spends and continues to spend perfecting this game. I have never found a tower defense game that has even remotely come close to the unbelievably beautiful graphics, game play, controls, and on going improvements that this app offers. Just when I thought this app was perfected they add a co-op mode which is so awesome. If your unsure about spending the three bucks for this app is understandable but don't let so many horrible apps out there that all of us had paid for and regretted it later on prevent you from buying this work of art that honestly will provide hundreds of hours of challenging entertainment and fun. I suggest trying there free app they have available which is the battles game. Don't let reviews of that one fool you into thinking they are basically the same game because that couldn't be further from the truth. There is no energy in the full version and when not if you eventually get this game after seeing how awesome the battles app is you will understand more of what I'm saying. Battles is a solely PvP Tower Defense Game. Balloons TD 5 is the whole enchilada and then some. My only complaint is I want them to make another sequel because I enjoy this game even a year after purchasing it so much. This is one app you will not be disappointed you paid for I can assure you.
B00AHDXTIK|5.0|I travel extensivly for work and need a 3m lightning cable for my iPad and iPhone 5s.  I've gone through more than a couple cheaper models.  I am incredibly impressed at the heavy duty nature of this cable.  I would say its 2x as heavy duty as Apples OEM lightning cable.  Blown away by the quality.  I'll never buy a cable from Apple again.  The quality on this is that much better.  Would recommend to anyone.
B008MM9630|4.0|I love playing this game. It is relaxing with the music and I don't feel rushed to complete goals. I recommend this game to anyone just wanting laid back farming with a twist of magic. The spells and mixing are fun and I love how you can regenerate energy.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy crush FINALLY made it to kindle! Great game that I said I would never play, then one level became 2, became 10, and on and on......
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I do believe this is one of the best books i have ever read right along the top with hunger games maybe better than hunger games the whole series was great but this this is absolutely amazing
006202406X|5.0|I think it's funny that there are so many negative reactions to the ending; it is really the only way that the series could end.  Both books in the beginning of the trilogy lead up to exactly what happened (to a point of being predictable), and anything other than Tris sacrificing herself as she did would have been out of character.  The book was well done in that it answered a lot of questions, and showed us some insight into Tobias which was interesting.  Good book, not as bad as people are making it seem in the comments/reviews.  It is written for it's target audience (YA), and it stays true to character.
0553565915|5.0|I have not finished it yet but so far I am not disappointed I expect that it will have a good ending
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is so addictive. I'm so glad it's available on kindle. I can play this game for hours. Candy Crush rules.
B007EC27QM|3.0|The calculator plus app is OK for what it is. Personally, I would have liked more functions (sq root, log, etc.), but it is acceptable for quick check-book type calculations.
B006N57PXG|5.0|Awesome book! Love the change in  perspective. Bartimaeus is such a great character, and such a smart ass. Love it!
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|I can usually see twists coming and guess endings but this one caught me by surprise, a pleasant surprise. I enjoyed it and even watched it a second time that same day.,
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|a fun trip back into the 80's and the world of computers and video games from the beginning of the home systems.  At certain points you might get tired or want to skip ahead when it gets super involved in naming things from the eights, but the story is good and you want to stick around to see how it ends.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|SUPER HAPPY THAT ITS FINALLY ON KINDLE FIRE TOTALLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME GOT TO GO BACK TO PLAYING CHOW :)
1476727651|4.0|When you create a masterpiece like \\"The Shining\\" it is very risky to create a sequel.  But Stephen King has never been shy about his plot lines. How  would we expect a young child who experienced that winter in Colorado to grow-up?  Perhaps a broken down psychotic without the benefit of an institution to house him; perhaps a child abuser; undoubtedly an alcoholic. In Doctor Sleep, the fact than Dan  became  an alcoholic drifter is not at all surprising.  The fact that he rose above the horror of his abusive father, the stark terror  of  his ability to see some very nasty and dangerous creatures who never really left him alone, the loss of his mother at an early age to become a very decent guy is what surprises.  This is a tragedy with heroes and villains.  King's  heroes, like those of Homer are flawed but we never stop rooting for them.  There is evil in this world. What does it matter if it is supernatural or just plain evil? It is the only plausible explanation for the mind numbing numbers of children who go missing every week. Who doesn't wish for the power to \\"find\\" them and save them? Many of the reviewers have criticized King for the superficiality and predictability of \\"The True Knot\\".  Valid criticisms but they miss the point of this sequel. Well done Steve.I do not think that we have heard the last from Stephen King about the Dan/Abra team.  Abra definitely has some raw anger management issues to deal with and Dan is the one to help her.  We don't want Abra to wind up like poor Carrie. I can't wait for the sequel to the sequel. King has been teasing us with a life everafter theme but he stops just short of going to that place.  As he gets older, with the rest of us, perhaps he will.  Dan is just the driver  for that journey. Bring it on Doctor Sleep.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|THIS GAME IS HIGHLY ADDICTIVE!!!! I am hooked and I like it but soon they're gonna have to introduce a CCA Candy Crush Anonymous! I will be the Association President.
B00G32TD98|5.0|Love the tie in to real people. Has some tense and scary scenes.  Like the actors and their performances.  Need to watch in the dark.
B00FP1NNJY|5.0|Downloaded this song for a half marathon race, and it was the perfect song to run to. Great beat and motivated me when all I wanted to do was walk!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I can honestly say I never saw it coming. I don't think any of my friends did. The trilogy arc of the Divergent series was so good from the 1st book and even through the 2nd book. I was expecting the 3rd to live up to those standards, to wow me with the conclusion. It wow'd me all right, I kept turning the page back and forth to see if I had missed something. I'm sorry to say I wasn't happy with this resolution.
B00633W614|4.0|While this book doesn't quite live up to the first one in the series, it is still a fantastic story and held me captivated. Jeffrey Archer is a master story teller.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|SO GLAD I CAN NOW PLAY THIS ON MY KINDLE. THANK YOU!<br />I love to play on this format better than computer or iPhone .
B0017XD3OY|2.0|I can't recommend it. It isn't as good as other pictures he's had. Smith's best pictures were Independence Day and Ali.
B008BU75IQ|3.0|My first Jefferey Archer novel and I had some problems with the British vocabulary which I enjoyed, but the plot was somewhat interesting but very improbable.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|100% fun!<br />Get effects for a simple game whether I am on my phone or tablet. The kids even plays.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love love this game I can't stop playing it I got a kindle fire and it didn't have candy crush sage so I'm glad that now it does
B004P1JEXE|5.0|I thought it was great. I had been watching the series on Foxtell before I started reading the books. As the series take so long to come to foxtell I just had to read the books to find out what is happening. Also, seeing the picture first I am  able to put faces to many of the  characters in the book.
039472903X|5.0|David Ogilvy is one of the masters and should be on the reading list for anyone aspiring to a life in marketing or copywriting.<br /><br />Don't overlook this book just because it was written before Internet marketing was \\"the thing\\" to do. It's a back to the basics text that teaches you how to use the words that motivate people to action. The methods of putting your message in front of people may change, but the psychology that triggers the buying impulse doesn't change.<br /><br />If you're planning to use words to sell - read Ogilvy.
B00EYZMCXK|4.0|This controller is perfect for beginner or intermediate level deejaying, easy to set up has great features, works with the software very well. It's lightweight and now works with the ipad so it's ultra portable. The software is the full version of traktor pro 2.The only thing I don't like is that it doesn't have an emergency source, so I can't plug in my iPod. But this controller works great, it's fun to use and is cool looking.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|It is such a shame that This series ended on such a low note.  The book was poorly written, the characters were inconsistent with the previous books, and a lot of the issues from the previous books were left unsoiled or just kind of awkwardly fell to the way-side.  I hated both the major deaths, and the ending was completely unsatisfying.
0143115014|5.0|I enjoy good writing.  I enjoy perfumes.  This books meets both needs.  While I do not always agree with the reviews, they are full of wit and grace, and are thus eminently enjoyable.  I have had to scramble for the dictionary a couple of times, but that was a challenge I rather enjoyed, not having had experienced it in a while.  I read it straight through.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|Had to exchange my kindle fire because of wi-fi issuses and now i don't have the candy crush game i payed for and i did not like the issue of having to pay more money to continue playing. My wife plays the game on her I phone and has a great time with the game. Albert
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Well-written novel that unveils how three seemingly unrelated families have changed each others' lives without even knowing it.  The author's delightful descriptions of the characters and their daily activities add well-placed humor throughout, despite their life struggles.  Great vacation read!
1400069289|4.0|I am a licensed therapist who specializes in habit change and found this book to be extraordinary. I picked it up with the hopes that it would provide a clear and concise understanding of habit change and creation so that I might be able to recommend it to non-professionals and clients. This book met and then exceeded those expectations.<br /><br />The only reason why I didn't rate this book a 5/5 is because there are a few missing pieces such as how many of the habits we develop in life reach a point where they become almost insensitive to reward and those behaviors continue even after they no longer lead to reward. This oversight, for me, knocked the review down one star.<br /><br />Other than that, this is an excellent book and I would absolutely recommend it to non-professionals looking to understand habits and how they govern our lives.
B0061C1NQ6|5.0|One of my favorites - great mystery, character development and history lesson. I have been to the places described and Smith conveys them well.
1439181780|5.0|Everyone has the power to create anything their want, I have been using the same method ever since my young age, after reading the book more realisation what the books all about, I totally get it now! I am &#34;The Power&#34;<br /><br />Thank you Rhonda, for writing it so clearly and make it more easy to follow!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book was great. The story moved at a great pace. I couldn't put it down till I finished it. Have to get the next book to see how it ends.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I am a social worker who worked for many years with foster children and juvenile delinquent teens.  To the average person, this story may seem far-fetched.  But the emotional struggles, life experiences and descriptions of this young teen are spot on.  In addition to enjoying a well-written, engaging book, you will learn much!  Enjoy!
B00AEFXUL2|5.0|Excellent, excellent is the only word for this movie. The quality was great and it was worth the money. Glad I got my own personal copy!
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Cliff hanger that is a killer. But season offers much in the Downton way. The one linnets are as witty as ever.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I can't believe she died! Her and Tobias were supposed to live together forever. Amazing wonderful it brought tears to my eyes.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|The first book was great and I couldn't put it down until I finished it. This book was wonderful. It was as great as the first. I couldn't put it down until I finished  it.
B003YFIUW8|3.0|I enjoyed the story, however struggled with the child's voice being the predominant story teller.  It did present insight and intrigue in figuring out the story, but I personally had to take periodic breaks because it was not an easy read.  I did enjoy the epilogue and researched the real life story that mirrors similarities of this story.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I would recommend it to anyone of any age.<br />A touching story and beautifully written book. This is worth every cent!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Oh yes, this is a five star book. I loved A Time To Kill and this is next on my list. Grisham has done it again and has done it very well. You will enjoy revisting some of the same people that you met in A Time To Kill. I highly recommend this book and I will say no more, as I don't want to spoil your reading of this book. Way to go John. Congratulations.
B004IPPINW|3.0|The man was shallow. His life would have been completely different if Erica had become his girl friend (seriously). He had no outlets for his hormones so he became a terrorist? Maybe that's what is wrong with all of them - strict religious rules and killing instead of loving.
B005TBN3EU|1.0|Couldn't get through the first hour of this film. Galifinakis is a funny guy, but he was written like such an unlikable ass in this one that none of us could stand to watch any more.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Well written book with succinct, descriptive prose to move the complicated backgrounds and engaging story smoothly.  I am slow reader and get impatient with too much minutia in a book.  This was a page-turner.  You will love it!
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Absolutely amazing. Beyond my expectations of what I imagined. Great fighting with many possible combinations. Variety of game modes to gain silver to upgrade your robot
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love it and cant stop playing it!!!! It is the best game they came out with. I was happy to see it.. Even free!!
B0051OZ28K|5.0|I just absolutely love this movie its great. I recommend to anyone!!!! And the soundtrack is just amazing I love it!!!!
B000FC2L1E|4.0|Book Three of the Outlander series picks up where Dragonfly in Amber leaves off, and though it isn't quite as un-put-downable as the first book, it's still a rousing, exciting read that keeps you turning pages to find out what happens next. Diana Gabledon is a marvelous writer who creates great characters and uses language beautifully. Recommend these books highly!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I enjoy this game so much its addictive, just have to put down or be up all nite playing waiting for a life.
B000BF0D9M|3.0|Overall, a very good collection of flamenco guitar music.  My only criticism is that several cuts stressed the Moorish influence.  I think the collection would have been much better without quite so many selections which took that direction.
B00FFRAKRG|5.0|This Album Personifies The Reason That I Began To Listen To Their music. One Song After the Other they're All Awesome.
0345350499|5.0|Really takes you into the heart of Avalon in a manner nobody has done before. I read this book years ago and bought this copy for my son. It was a little to advanced for him (he is 10) but he said that when he gets older he would like to attempt it again.
B006AX6ONI|2.0|This could have been a great book but Mark didn't put much effort into this. Poor writing and not enough depth make this book a D minus. Disappointed in you Mark; you should bench yourself. You could  have done much better.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I hope anyone who reads this book should enjoy it. A mixture of love and action all thrown into one. A love story in disguise. This book shows you what one little action can bring you to. Suzanne Collins has brought an amazing fiction book about love. I can't wait to read catching fire and see the hunger games on the big screen. Thank you Suzanne Collins.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|This game is fundamentally similar to other jewel matching type games, but this provides extra fun by changing the boards, locking pieces, and requiring a quota for each type of gem/block.  You get to earn building blocks to save the fairy village (or something, I don't remember the exact story).  Anyway it's a lot of fun. I have had hours of entertainment for only $2!
B003L77G6A|5.0|Intellectual, quote worthy, fun for my 5 year old up to me, including 14 and 10 year old boys. We really like the characters, acting is right on, and the writing is brilliant. Thanks for a good family entertainment show without need for violence or mayhem. Just clean fun. And don't forget it is not chili with beans.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|I like to watch movies over and over and was glad to get this movie. Like this DVD no problems.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game because I get to care for ice age animals and hang out with friends along the way
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read. Considering that this is my first book, I'm proud I chose it.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|i love it but first i thought it was about doing missions like walking and  stuff like that but whatever i totally recommend this app to iron man lovers! :D especially that Gameloft made this !!
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|I like to watch movies over and over and was glad to get this movie. Like this DVD no problems.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|The story is heartwarming.  It is entertaining and encourages others, regardless of their crises and stage in life, to continue to hold on to a life that has rewards and holds a family together when God is in the center.  Great scriptural insights.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love this app because it lets me read at night by using white letters on a black background. No bright light to keep my husband awake.
B000FC0ZEO|5.0|very good reading. I have now read all 9 books concerning FitzChivalry Farseer by Miss Robin Hobb.  I would recommend any and all to anyone who likes this type of fiction. Excellent.
B001FSDOZO|5.0|I have listened to this group for along time and replacing stolen cd so I am glad I found this one.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|This book was such a let down. There were so many issues with it, that it took me a few days to get into it. Nevermind that I read here other two books in hours because they were so much better, and better written.<br /><br />The book alternates between the point of view of Tris and Tobias. This was confusing. After two novels that were told from the point of view of Tris, it was odd to suddenly have Tobias' point of view. Not only that, but it didn't really add anything extra to the story. In fact it just created more confusion. There was really no difference in voice between Tobias' and Tris' and it made this book seem so disjointed from the other two in the series. I wish that she had kept this story from Tris' POV, and then let me see how Tobias felt in the little novellas that she's creating. As it was, the character development seemed stalled. Neither Tris nor Tobias felt like they were whole people in this story. And honestly, Tobias just came off as a whiny selfish little boy, instead of the strong hero with flaws that I came to love in Divergent and Insurgent.<br /><br />The storyline itself was also disappointing and made little sense. I felt like there was so much missing as far as explanations and back story. Tris' mother and father, I would have really liked have read more about them and have a nice conclusion.<br />And speaking of conclusions, I think I wouldn't have minded the end so much, if the book itself had been better written. But as it is, if felt more like is was done as shock value and didn't really serve any purpose to further the story.<br /><br />I really felt cheated out of a conclusion of what, up until this point, had been a really great series. I don't know if Veronica Roth just ran out of ideas for a conclusion, or if her editorial team did a bad job editing this story, but it was no where near as good a quality as her previous works. In fact it felt like someone else wrote this book, and just used the same characters. Instead of tying up loose ends, it's like she decided to just throw every thread out there and see if we could make sense of it for her. It felt sloppy and unfinished. But mostly if felt lazy, and that's is what bothers me the most.<br /><br />Don't buy this book, it's not really a conclusion in any way, and it will leave you completely unsatisfied, confused, disappointed, angry, and sad.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Not the ending I would have wanted, but a nice close to the trilogy. For those invested in the series a must read.
B00943SP0G|4.0|It's, it's, weird.  Written as if I did it and I would write the most terrible dreck.  Yet, I find parts hilarious.  My wife just shakes her head and goes about doing something else.<br /><br />Sleepy Hollow is a much better movie though parts of it are also pretty clunky.  I feel they tried for another Sleepy Hollow and finding they were just way off the Horror and Suspense line, they tried to make this one comedy.  But they were a bit too far in for that too.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|I like watching movies over and over again. Have watched this one a dozen times or better very happy with this DVD
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Great story line with characters' relationships easy follow.  The ending is completely wonderful.  There are lessons to learn in this adventure in human conditions of the heart.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Spiritual dive into self discovery. A must for wanna be adventurists!!!!! Very well written, and soon to be a movie.  Catch it before<br />the movie comes out.
B004A8EI9M|1.0|PLEASE NOTE:  This one-star rating is not for the show itself!  It's for the failure of Amazon to make the show free for Prime members.  As of this writing, the show is on its fourth season.  By now, you would at least expect Amazon to free up the first season for free.<br /><br />What's going on, Amazon?<br /><br />Addendum:  Once this show streams free for Prime members, I will upgrade the rating to 5 stars.
B000062YAZ|5.0|I have listened to this group for along time and replacing stolen cd so I am glad I found this one.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|really didn't understand the story until the middle of the book. would have been helpful to know what happened in the begining
0545586178|4.0|I liked the book, with all the twists and turns it kept me wanting more...I had to force myself to put it down.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Old and slow like me?  Might mean your eyes aren't doing so good either. If your are part of millions that have limited resources a very large calculator is just the ticket. The LARGE buttons are so nice and the symbols are big also. I would not change a thing on this one. I love it!
B004BLTNM0|5.0|I like to watch movies over and over and was glad to get this movie. Like this DVD no problems.
B00F8MI9NK|5.0|This is a great movie for the kids.  My 6 years downloaded it on my kindle fire and watches it daily.
B008M87GJK|5.0|BBC gives a great roundup of international news without the slant that is so obvious in the U.S. news sources. .  interesting to see how other countries look at us.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This...I....oh my god...This book is fanTASTIC! It's got a great plot line, and isn't all just sex. Yes, there is a LOT of sex written, but it's not cheesy or misplaced, and there is an actual plot line to this book! I'm very excited to read the rest of the Fifty Shades Trilogy.<br /><br />Now, to figure out how to look at Seattle again without blushing...
B0002OERI0|5.0|I have listened to this group for along time and replacing stolen cd so I am glad I found this one.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I know there are some complaints about the lack of artistic flare or how some people find the dialogue wanting. That being said, Roth created a very accurate way of conversation in this book. People don't typically speak artistically and in the circumstances given in these books, there is no room for artistic language. This book is about life and death. Not about the vocabulary of the characters. They are teenagers after all. Concerning the ending, Roth couldn't have given any more foreshadowing about it in the first two books without completely giving it away. Overall, I loved the lesson of this book and the ending Roth wrote is the only real way to keep to the overall moral of this trilogy. I'm excited to see more work from her!
B004DM1ZQY|5.0|Used to carry a travel backgammon set with me.  No more!  No pieces to drop and lose!  this game has a variety of options and you can even use your own dice--though why is beyond me.
B008YU0AOE|1.0|I like it. But it doesn't show me the real answer. Really sad. I would like it more but oh well.
B00F91RYL8|2.0|Although the graphics and special effects were very good, the story was too unrealistic in so much as the solution to the zombie situation by injecting disease causing the zombies to not see you was too much.  The plane crash was well displayed but only two survivors, (the stars) was unlikely.
B0088EDMMS|5.0|Love love love this movie!  So glad to own it on Blu-ray, now I don't have to wait for it to come on TV.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a game where you have to have strategy. But it is still a great and fun game. Great job by King
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|Not a book to read for pleasure.  The story tries to link young love with the tragedy of dying cancer patients.  It is not a good combination.  It does, however, make a person glad to be alive.
B00BHNR1KQ|4.0|The movie was just an all around good scary horror movie. The scares were cheap, but still make me jump non-the-less... if you are looking for movie to watch with a significant other or family, this one is a safe bet to get some screams.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I rated 5 stars cause I love playing it. Would love to see more of my friends playing it. Enjoy it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So happy that Candy Crush is now on Kindle! True to the original version. Now I can play on all my devices!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I love this movie, I read the book and was great, the queality is good and has a good history too
B009ME47H2|5.0|I sing in a choir and several groups. It is hard to keep track of songs and the many changes a director will make to them. This app helps me greatly.
B00DGGIXS6|5.0|I love this woman, she continues to be one of my favorite artist of all time, she is the queen of dance and her ballads are mind blowing, what a voice, it is just as strong as always.  Keep singing Cher we need you.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Have had to rely on my alarm here when my phone broke!  Works great for the free version..exactly as described!  Easy to use and reliable!
006202406X|1.0|I am sixteen years old. I am an avid reader. I adored Divergent, absolutely adored it. I reccomended it to everyone at my school. After reading allegiant, I had to tell people \\"don't even bother. Just don't.\\"<br />I had several major issues with allegiant.<br />SPOILER ALERT*****<br /><br />1.) The ending.<br />No, I'm not crying just because veronica roth killed Tris.I think the whole situation gave off a message of meaninglessness to the entire trilogy. T. s's mom dies, her dad dies, half her friends die, and then she does too. The best thing about dystopian books is the idea of hope at the end. This book just gave me a cold, empty feeling. Maybe VR was trying to break the \\"happily ever after\\" mold, maybe she just wanted us to know life sucks. MESSAGE RECEIVED. Frankly, we, the devoted readers of the trilogy, did NOT deserve that, and neither did Tobias.<br />2.) Plot holes and character inconsistencies<br />Where to even START?!<br />The ending with Marcus was absolutley ludicrous.<br />He just... disappears.<br />Tris's decision for a mass memory wipe? Based on her moral conviction that... taking.. a person's... memory.... is wrong?? Whoops!<br />Evelyn's sudden schizophrenia? Which is the only scenario where her total 180 with Tobias that makes one iota of sense.<br />The fact that VR just threw away the entire concepts of the factions? That certainly made the book boring.<br />I could go on, but I think my point is clear.<br />3.) The new, split narrative<br />First of all, it is bad form to switch up the way you narrate your book 2/3 of the way through the series. Second, if you must do so, at least make your character's peraonalities discernible to the reader. I had to go back to the beginning of the chapter several times to remember who was narrating.<br />4.) The added profanity<br />Seriously, Roth? There are more swear words in Allegiant than in Divergent and Insugent combined! They weren't necessary, nor did they give any extra meaning or insights to the book. Just take them out.<br /><br />In conclusion. I hated this book. I will most likely not read anything else by veronica roth. I will see the divergent movie, only as a memorial to what the series could have been. In my opinion, Roth should recall the book and try again. In the meantime, I will think of better endings, like tris starting a new, divergent faction, or living happily with Tobias and giving meaning to the trilogy. Regardless. I was totally, completely, and utterly disappointed by Allegiant. My advice? Don't even bother.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have it through facebook, my cellphone, and all my tablets. When I run out of lives on 1, I switch to another device. Can't get enough of this game.
B001NLL93W|5.0|Best book of the series so far can't wait for the next one. You won't be able to put it down
B0062NAVXA|5.0|I would recommend for all parents/ grandparents to see. a story of family man teaching how to live life the right way.
B009A87X80|4.0|I recently discovered music by Eva Cassidy by playing around on You Tube. This is great music to listen to when driving the highways and byways of America.
B0016MJ6T2|3.0|The movie was a good movie but the disc was flawed. I'm unhappy about that. I would like it replaced.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I love this game. The only problem I had was the game stopping in the middle of a puzzle. In spite of that I continued playing and upgraded so there will be no ads. To my great surprise the game didn't stop in the middle of a puzzle. It was worth the upgrade
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I was afraid my Kindle Fire was toast. Because of hand issues I can't hold a back and love to read.The cable lets me read again!
B00F3W9NQ2|4.0|Great fun to watch. i know its intended for teens but I'm a little juvenile. i like the characters personalities. Not as hokey as twilight not as vulgar as true blood.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is a fun way to kill time when I'm waiting somewhere. A big thank you to the awesome, creative person/people that gave us this game.
B00G32QIEG|4.0|R.I.P,D. is a twist on the MIB movies.  There's no social message to the movie.  It's just a fun time.  I'll think of the movie every time I eat a banana.
034580404X|5.0|Couldn't put it down, finished all 3 books in less than a week! Very erotic but a good story line  too.
B000002ULO|5.0|I just love this cd. The songs are unique and it is the last cd that was recorded with his beloved wife, Linda. Her back round harmonies are beautiful. &#34;If I only had One Love&#34; is probably my favorite.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|The writing style of the third book is so distracting. Switching between Tris and Tobias every other chapter is ridiculously hard to follow. Half the time I can't even remember which one I'm reading. I don't understand why the author chose to completely alter her writing style during the last book of a trilogy. I'm only halfway through this book, whereas I finished the first two very quickly. I can't believe I paid money for this - I should have waited and read a synopsis after it was released. Waste of money.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|Cant believe how much changes season by season but ultimately WW just cant seem to get a win.  Every season has been great and while the plot twists at times seems to be a little too much (bro-in-law wanting to visit plant) it is still awesome
B008LXZFH6|4.0|my kids wanted to see this before the next one comes out and we all had a very good laugh!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Enjoyed how he told Danny's story. Especially enjoy King's comments about how he had always wondered what happened to Danny and wrote about his drinking.
006202406X|5.0|This review will NOT contain spoilers, but it is for those that are on the fence about reading this book.<br /><br />I am pretty amazed at all the low star reviews. Allegiant was well written and a very good close to this trilogy. I am realizing that there are numerous ways readers can look at themes, character development and endings. Ultimately, it is the author's story and she has her reasons for writing Allegiant the way she did. I encourage you to read it. It may not end the way you want it to, but honestly, I don't think it should have ended any other way. I have several friends that are not too happy with the ending and suggested if you love the first two books, to not read this one. I disagree. I too, love the series and this book did not ruin it for me. Of course, I liked Mockingjay in THG and many had problems with that ending as well. ;)<br /><br />Don't let the bad reviews keep you from this book and further, if you do read it, don't let those bad reviews taint your experience as you do read Allegiant.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game is amazing. It has great graphics and the game makes you feel like your hunting wild animals. Amazing
B006O6F932|4.0|I think it's great Mattel finally made a cool, portable MH playset.  If you have ever bought any of your kids a portable playset, you can expect the quality to be similar.  I mean, any time you have something that is going to fold into itself, it isn't going to be the sturdiest.  However, I think they did an okay job in that respect.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />Activity on both front and back sides<br />Looks impressive set up<br />Portable<br /><br />Cons:<br />Doesn't lock when folded up unless you remove basketball hoop
006202406X|1.0|I read the first two books, and I enjoyed them. They weren't the best books ever written, but they were entertaining.<br /><br />I can't tell you how disappointing the third book is. The writing is terrible. The author makes a chapter a characters voice, and I routinely lost track of who it even was as they were so similar. I kept going back to the first page of the chapter to see who I was reading about.<br /><br />The book drags on with way too much information about genes and theories ---- thus losing the appeal of the first two books. It was all too much genes and not enough character development. The ending was just as bad as the rest of the book. I don't plan on purchasing any more of her novels after this. It wasn't worth my time to read it, nor worth the money I spent to buy it.
B009NX1YT6|4.0|Good movie, brought back some memories.  Quality was very good on my Kindle Fire HD.  Never had a problem with streaming
0439023521|5.0|Impossible to put down. had a lot of fun reading it until the wee hours. Absolutely recommended to all of you.
B00C6Q511Y|3.0|Is it just me, or has Ken gotten more and more feminine looking?  And the hair never seems to lay right.  Mattel should consider going back to the plastic haired dolls or something.<br /><br />Anyway, this Ken is ok.  He has a sissy face and hair that never looks like the picture, just like all the other Ken dolls these days.  But he at least has a very basic, more masculine outfit.  My daughter likes him.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|This book made it easy to prep my manuscripts for Kindle. I do wish it had more discussion of the Bookshelf and Author page.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I'm in love with this game! So addicting! I can't seem to put it down. Love those minions and I love the decorated town for Halloween!
0439023491|4.0|Yes, catching, and you cannot stop reading. At the wee hours, you say.....ok, just until the next chapter.....Kind of addictive.
B00DBO1YMK|5.0|Still, Still, Still is my favorite, but they are all wonderful, refreshing and upbeat.  I bought a CD for myself and after listening to it I placed another order for each of my adult children.  This will make a marvelous Christmas gift.
B00FWLSLJ4|2.0|Good visual effects and fight scenes, but terrible script, acting, and sets instead of actual places, looked cheap. Bad acting all around, didn't draw an interest in characters.
B00ARF93AQ|4.0|I am a sucker for post apocalyptic sci-fi movies, even if they just  turn out to be an Die Hard/Robocop copycat gore-fest; as long as the setup, execution and characters are appealing. The future world in this story is not over the top, Dredd rides a souped up motorcycle, and never takes his helmet off, EVER. But his character, though somewhat one-dimensional, is not an over-the-top tough guy, he literally treats each action as a case and meters out sentences according, usually letter the punishment fit the crime. Though his trainee, with the ability to read thoughts, makes him aware that justice should not be blind to harsh realities within a suspect's life. No academy awards here, but decent acting and solid characters like the villain, Ma-Ma. (Cersei Lannister)<br /><br />The gore is violent and ultra-realistic, so be-warned. But this is a grim but fun take on the comic book hero( which I have'nt read), and I hope they make a sequel to go deeper into Dredd's psyche and explore more of the future world and politics behind the Judges.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Yes, very faithfull in keeping it up with the other two previous books. I enjoyed it very much, could not put it down at night. Good!!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Could not be more disappointed in this book.  Where was the editor and publisher to stop this author from ruining a great story?  I don't even want to watch the movie adaptations I was so excited about seeing before this atrocity.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|This case is all you need to protect and manage your kindle HD 7. The feature to on-off the screen display as you open or close the lid is simply spectacular! Without talking about the practical many positions that you can use to reading.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|All the series of this game is really amazing. Try to play this games and you will have a fun time
B00EV4EUT8|4.0|***This review may contain spoilers.***<br /><br />Ed Uyeshima's review of \\"Lee Daniels The Butler\\" (hereafter \\"The Butler\\") pretty much encompasses and captures my feelings toward this ambitiously sweeping movie. What more can I add? In this review I will focus upon the need to sustain Civil Rights/Equality history's relevance and the need to represent something greater than you.<br /><br />Through the passive but observant eyes of partly-fictionalized eyes of Cecil Gaines (Forest Whitaker), the viewer is barraged with practically every notable American Civil Rights, Affirmative Action, and Equality event from the late thirties to the near present. Some events are sketchy and ephemeral, others more shockingly substantial. Some events are uplifting and optimistic, others are shameful and appalling. Like Cecil to some extent, we sympathize and empathize with the players in these historical dramas, but also wish to be distanced from it because it threatens our family, our livelihood, and even our lives. Cecil, at least as a small boy, wants to fight the injustices African-American endure, but his life's training as a servant has suppressed all that. To survive and even prosper, Cecil has internalized the old adage \\"Keep your head down, and you'll work forever\\". As a result, he has a \\"prestigious\\" job as a White House butler and a comfortable home in a predominantly black (and therefore safe) D.C. suburb.<br /><br />However, comfort zones (especially in the movies) don't last long. Cecil's older son Louis (David Oyelowo) is diametrically opposed to being like father. Improbably but admirably, Louis becomes involved in practically every revolutionary Civil Rights event, including Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s 1963 march on Washington and the formation of the Black Panthers. To his father's fearful dismay, Louis's militant activities take precedence over his Fisk University studies and even his career. At a family dinner, when Louis condemns Sidney Poitier's \\"Uncle Tom\\" vanilla appeasement of whites, that ignites a confrontation with his father. However, \\"The Butler\\" makes blindingly clear that it isn't Louis who has alter his thinking. Cecil has to find it within himself to radically alter years of subservient conditioning and take a stand, not only for Civil Rights/Equality, but also for his own self-respect. He begins by arguing with the White House serving head for equal pay for equal work, and works up to dinner as a guest of the Reagans. As he approaches old age, Cecil is fortunate enough to see Obama's election to the presidency and get a formal White House invitation from him. \\"The Butler\\", I think, also states that taking a stand for bettering the human condition does not have to begin on a dramatic, monumental scale. Quietly but determinedly working for incremental change is also courageous and vital.<br /><br />\\"The Butler\\" frequently presents a whirlwind synopsis of American Civil rights history with the subtlety of a charging rhinoceros. Some viewers may balk at that and, especially in light of the 50th anniversary of Dr. King's \\"I Have a Dream\\" oration, uncomfortably dismiss it as restive propaganda. Yet, we have to remember to remember history, otherwise... well, you know. We need to be reminded of American Civil Rights' tortured, violent, but progressive history and the ignorant hatred of intolerant people. We need to be reminded that we have come a long way, but that we have a long way to go, and perhaps always will. Nevertheless, when you fight for justice, the very fight is a triumph. The only way to lose is when you stop fighting.anilla appeasement of whites, that ignites a confrontation with his father.

B0089LOG02|4.0|A good ending. Early part of the story is sad, but is based some fact.  A bit hard to keep track of the  characters in the begining.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|I'm on the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and it works fantastic. It also interacts with the other photo apps on my Kindle. The blemish feature is awesome. It took about a minute of pressing this and that to figure it out (there might be instructions somewhere but I didn't want to stop and read them). I am definitely going to have fun with this app.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Addictive game fun &amp; frustrating at the same time.  Some levels are very difficult and hard to pass without purchasing extra moves.

B00AWGIRK2|5.0|Two independently wealthy sisters--liberal intellectuals with open minds and spirits--meet first a soulless capitalist and his family, and then a lower class working man struggling for education of mind and soul. This is a well told tale of a clash of values. The Penguin Kindle edition I read contains a good introduction and useful footnotes.
B000OLV97I|1.0|I Bought the hd version of Eragon my favorite book. Amazon sent me hd and standard versions 29$. The hd version cost me 16.99$ the standard was 10.99$. Amazon charged me for both 29$ total. Amazon should have something in its software that prevents standard and hd versions of the same movie being purchased at the same time

B008MAI0WK|5.0|This book is well-written and provides information not only on the Raspberry Pi but also the version of Linux used with it.  Although often down played or overlooked, Linux requires updates to keep it up-to-date and running well.  This book provides simple and easy-to-follow guidance about determining if updates are available and how to perform those updates with minimum fuss and effort.<br /><br />I particularly like having the book in the Kindle format so it is with me anytime I collaborate with fellow Raspberry Pi enthusiasts with new or old projects.  Our two primary uses of the Raspberry Pi to-date have been with amateur (ham) radio and XBMC.  This book has been very helpful in achieving a level of comfort in using, operating, & maintaining the Raspberry Pi so that the struggle of learning and using is minimized.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I've been processing the book for a couple of days now. I found the ending to be powerful and true to Tris. All of the strong reactions attest to the fact that Veronica Roth is a good storyteller and created rich characters. I'm amazed at the venom from other reviewers. It sounds like Ms. Roth ended it the way she planned all along. And, it was her story to tell--I admire her storytelling abilities and wish I had an iota of her writing talent. Just because you don't like how it ends, it shouldn't ruin the fact that the series overall has all the elements of a solid, well told story--full of interesting ideas, action, wonderfully crafted characters, romance, questions of right and wrong, and great character development. Tobias' journey and introspection on whether he was damaged or not was heartfelt and it was great to see how he matured since of course most of the characters are just teenagers. I really liked how Ms. Roth explored the concepts of being 'damaged' and humanity overall. I did feel like a lot was thrown at the reader in this book--it felt like another book could have been added to flesh out all the big reveals.<br /><br />I'm sad to see it end but loved going along on the journey with Tris and all the other initiates!

B004J4RQIM|5.0|If you liked the Hit Man concert, you will love the Hit Man Returns Concert and CD.  I am a big fan of Donna Summer who died only six months after this concert.  She partnered with Seal to do a medley of their songs, and it was spectacular.  Some of the other stars were Michael Bolton, who did a great duet with Seal, Kenny Loggins, Earth, Wind, and Fire, Martina McBride and many others you will like.

006202406X|1.0|I went into this book thinking I was going to LOVE it ( I LOVED LOVED LOVED the first two!). I'm no longer sad that Tris had to die at the end because anger and disappointment replaced it. I don't know why Veronica Roth chose to end the best trilogy with the main character's death but if you ask me it ruined the whole book series for me and I will never be able to enjoy it again.<br />(I LOVED this book too!!...until the end)
B00E9ZFIMM|2.0|If you are looking for a notepad app to type and save notes, this app is not the one.  Notepad Pro++ has no really special features that me and other users are looking for such as cool fonts, sharing notes, and sending notes to people.  Evernote is a much better notetaking app!

0143034901|5.0|My words are very clumsy in comparison to this story so I will keep my review simple, I cannot say enough wonderful things about In the Shadow of the Wind. There are elements of romance, mystery, history and an overall sense of adventure in this novel. Since reading this book, I have recommended it to many of my friends and all those who have picked it up, have thoroughly enjoyed it. It is the type of story that I believe appeals to many, and it is one that I highly recommend.

B000YJ85BI|5.0|This series is great with each book, Old Man's War, the Ghost Brigade,The Lost Colony building one upon the other. This last entry is my favorite, but each can certainly stand on its own. But read it in the series time line in order to fully appreciate the trilogy. I'm looking forward reading many more of to Scalzi's work.  JA
B002Q9MZF6|4.0|How can the opera be both, simultaneously?<br />  I bought this, because I like the combination of Villaz&oacute;n and Netrebko. I saw them, together, in the Met's presentation of La Boh&egrave;me, which I found excellent.<br />  Let's start with the failures. First, the film is lip synched. The lip synching, especially in Villaz&oacute;n's \\"Che Gelida Manina,\\" is so bad that, at times, his lip motions don't even come close to the words allegedly pouring out. There are only minor lip synch errors, throughout the rest of the film. Second, when Mimi is singing her \\"Si, mi chiamano Mimi,\\" she's moving and looking all over the place, including on the internal staircase to the roof, when she should be facing and singing, directly, to Villaz&oacute;n. While the quality of the photography is excellent, it's direction leaves much to be desired. The constant zoom-ins, zoom-outs, split screens and cuts are, at best, annoying and amateurish.<br />  Netrebko's red, velvet dress, in the scene when she first enters the garret, is completely out of place, for a poor girl. The quality and style are totally inconsistent and way above the level which would be believable, for a young girl, who works, as an embroiderer of flowers, in a sweat shop type factory.<br />  Because of the poor lip synching, I could not recommend this, as anyone's first viewing of this opera but, for those of us familiar with it, you may want to add it to your collection.<br />  Now, for the positives: The quality of the singing is absolutely fabulous. Villaz&oacute;n and Netrebko are in perfect form. Villaz&oacute;n is so drawn and almost emaciated, in this film, that he makes the part of a staving poet/playwright absolutely believable. The role of Marcello, which is normally assigned to a second stringer, was sung excellently.<br />  This version is, also, the first time I've seen Musetta and Mimi properly portrayed. Too often, Musetta is portrayed an nothing more than an innocent flirt. She is the local trollop, who will gladly fill the bed of any male who is willing to keep her. Unfortunately, for her, she is, also, conflicted, by her deep and passionate love, for Marcello. The voice of Nicole Cabelle, as Musetta, is, also, excellent and, hopefully, we'll see more of her, in strong roles.<br />  Some folks have suggested that the bed scene may not be appropriate. I disagree. Mimi is not a naive, innocent, young girl. She was conceived, by Puccini, as an ill-educated, poor, unwell, hard, street-reared and street smart young woman, with an attitude of \\"live life, while I can.\\" Her depiction, here, is perfect, not harsh, inappropriate or incorrect.<br />  The combination of the perfect singing, with the properly portrayed characterizations, make this a keeper.f any male who is willing to keep her.

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|A great read that made you think &#34;what would I do if this happened to me&#34; for multiple scenarios. It really makes you think but is also fun and different....refreshing. I loved it and would recommend it to anyone looking to get away from their daily lives and step inside someone else's for a while. The &#34;secret&#34; is well worth the read.

B0010SKUYM|5.0|I would give this  five stars all day.this is such a good book! You can tell it's written by someone who's loves poems. You can't help but fall into the characters life. It's funny, scary, sad, and full of anticipation. I just gotta keep reading. I had no choice but to get be the next book.
B000Q6GXW2|5.0|I love this movie and I liked the fact I got the movie for 5cents! lol! it was used before but heck, it played well and the box looked relatively new so I am satisfied!

B00006ZXSK|5.0|I consider it classic as well as something I can enjoy with my granddaughter without worrying about too much adult content.
B00BUVPIRS|4.0|Has a definate Bethesda feel. Some minor issues with the controls as touch controls are wont to do. Overall great game.
B00867GK26|5.0|This was used but it played like it should and it came in all its original packaging. I'm glad I got a hold of this. Love it!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|A nice game with good visuals. I played this game for years and gets better year after year. Nice graphics and action packed. Of course it is not as fast as a car race.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Love this game &amp; hate this game. This is not your typical match 3 game. There are challenges that can be rather frustrating, but hey, isn't that the purpose. I never play match 3 games because they've become boring &amp; predictable. This game is neither! The more advanced you go in the game, the harder the levels become. Don't expect to breeze through like you would on other match 3 games. Squares have to be unlocked &amp; spaces filled but instead of trying to beat a clock you have to accomplish the goals in a specified amount of moves. One level may only allow you 15 moves while another may give 35. Not sure how they calculate that. You will run out of turns trying to advance &amp; you will be tempted to pay $0.99 to obtain 3 more turns. I have fallen into that trap several times. It's why I give the game 4 stars. Picking my pocket is not something I enjoy. But I take full responsibility for giving in to temptation. I suppose the developers have to make money, somehow. Anyway, I recommend this game, just be prepared to either have patience or start forking over your hard earned money $0.99 at a time. Have fun!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very addictive!  This game is very challenging.  It requires skill and brain power to determine the combinations that are needed to clear the level.  Once you pick it up it is hard to put it down..

I have just come home from a 2 week visit in Florida with my mom and dad....dad has dementia and calls me many times daily to help him 'find' my mom. He often does not recognize her throughout the course of his day. If I can help mom to change dad's diet and get him off carbs, high sugared fruits and root veggies, perhaps we can bring dad's memory back. This book is on order to both my mom and myself as we speak.

B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|I loved this book, the questions, mystery and romance, I couldn't put it down.. and then came the end of the book.  The ending was ridiculous and disappointing but I'm trying to remember how much I loved the rest of the book and let my disappointment in the ending go.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Although the plot is a little implausible ..... spectacular sci-fi scenes and almost non-stop action.... eye candy in the form of Pine and Pinto/ Eve and Saldana make this an entertaining and forgivable movie to watch.<br />The fans will undoubtedly be impressed by the villain... touted as the mesmerizing focus of this episode ... a charismatically yet logically evil fanatic....  benjamin cumber batch..... whose deep baritone intonation : &#34;I will walk over your cold corpses &#34;  is undoubtedly my favorite line in the movie.

B003G4W49C|5.0|Read it as a young man- deemed it worthy science fiction back then. Several decades later, reread the story to prep for the upcoming movie.  Age has given me some perspective.  I didn't appreciate the book as much as it deserved.  My big concern now is the movie will not do the book justice, or it will be ruined with stupid rewrites and amazingly incorrect special effects, as was Heinlein's 'Starship Troopers'.  That is a wonderful story, horribly ruined by Hollywood showing off how to ruin a good book.  I do hope for better wisdom with the 'Ender's Game ' movie.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Its really fun but sometimes it takes a month or more to get through a level. Very addictive and fun.

B00FAPF5U0|2.0|Because I am using kindle fire to play I can not use any off the additional items such as the five extra moves. Also I can move on to the next level because it w o my let me use the airplane app. It kind of sucks not being able to play the entire game. I'm stuck at level thirty nine.

B00AYB1TP0|5.0|This is a well-designed app that accomplishes a lot of my family's early learning goals in one swipe. The games are appealing with great animations to reward success, and that means there is incentive to keep playing with repetition which will create learning. ABC's are reinforced as a concept, as phonetic word-starters, and sight recognition for the shapes is built in too, and this is essential because it will help early reading take off eventually. Arranging the crab letters also prepares for beginning writing when a child is ready, so lots of great neural pathways are being built with this game. Definitely a winner with a place in our home.
B00DM11LV6|4.0|I enjoyed the story and how it didn't spend too much time focusing on the stigma of their relationship, but rather their love.

B00G6Q29KQ|5.0|Note: this is the third book in the series. To avoid possible spoilers, check out [[ASIN:B00BB3UYS8 Outview (The Inner Movement)]] and [[ASIN:B00DIMXTBO Outin (The Inner Movement)]] books first.<br /><br />\\"Outmove\\" picks up the story of Nate Ryder and the spiritual \\"Awakening\\" of the Human race some time after the dramatic ending of the \\"Outin.\\" He is almost nineteen, he is the formal leader of the Movement, that since \\"had grown into a worldwide revolution,\\" and his life has never been more complicated.<br /><br />Lightyear, the organization that has been hunting Nate and his friends in the previous book, has been defeated, its leader, Luther Storch, dead. The victory came with a price of many deaths and losses, and brought new problems: \\"Lightyear had just been a tiny division in an organization old with power, deep with connections and stunning in its coldness and greed--Omnia.\\" The conspiracy Nate has been fighting against became a full-blown worldwide takeover by this ancient power broker.<br /><br />With its almost limitless resources, Omnia can seemingly counter most anything Nate and his merry band of mystics and awakened can come up with. What is worse, the Movement is split into two factions: the main one, that takes the path of non-violence, and the Inner Force, the violent faction within the Movement, that holds to the idea that ends justify the means.<br /><br />\\"Outmove\\", the third novel in the \\"The Inner Movement\\" series, is much more action-filled than the two previous books. There are narrow escapes, prison breaks, plane chases, you name it. The battles are fought across times and dimensions, between the multiple incarnations of the same souls; the multiple possibilities of the outcomes become the prize. This is also where it gets pretty trippy. Even if you have been following in amazement the complex weave of metaphysical into the nature of reality in the two previous books, this one beats them all. Death is no longer the thing to fear, it's just a transition. Except for one possible death, Nate's. If he is to die in this incarnation, on this earthly plane the \\"Awakening\\" will fail. Nate \\"was king, bishop, knight and pawn in a multi-dimensional chess game that would decide the fate of humanity.\\"<br /><br />Some of this book reminds me of the Zelazny's novels. The handling of multiple realities inside a single narrative is a tough thing to do, but Brandt Legg does it pretty darn well. A few parts really stand out: the President Taft bit was brilliant, for example.<br /><br />There is also a tighter integration of the spiritual and such concepts as personal and societal freedoms, population control by the powers to be, public opinion, etc., in this novel. As things come to a boil, and the shadowy forces make their move, we can see that those little parts of our freedoms we give up right now in exchange for security are not so little after all, they are simply a first step that leads to loosing more and more of our freedoms down the road. Our belief that \\"If you aren't hiding anything, you don't need privacy. You only need your right to privacy if you have something to hide,\\" is a group complacency born out of fear, passivity, and lack of information. \\"Outmove\\" makes this point rather clearly.<br /><br />\\"Outmove\\" is a fast-moving yet thoughtful read. As always, it will appeal to the New Age crowd; however, with this installment, it will find a much larger audience among those readers who prefer to think for themselves. Recommended.a transition.

As things come to a boil, and the shadowy forces make their move, we can see that those little parts of our freedoms we give up right now in exchange for security are not so little after all, they are simply a first step that leads to loosing more and more of our freedoms down the road. Our belief that \\"If you aren't hiding anything, you don't need privacy. You only need your right to privacy if you have something to hide,\\" is a group complacency born out of fear, passivity, and lack of information. \\"Outmove\\" makes this point rather clearly.<br /><br />\\"Outmove\\" is a fast-moving yet thoughtful read. As always, it will appeal to the New Age crowd; however, with this installment, it will find a much larger audience among those readers who prefer to think for themselves. Recommended.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Allegiant was very good up until the end. Any other ending would have been more satisfying. However, I do understand the reason for the ending, but I still wish it had ended very differently.
0553801473|5.0|It's a really thrilling series and I cant wait for the next one to come out!  George R.R. Martin is a brilliant writer and his characters are superb!
B00006JU7T|4.0|Mankind in their infancy still centered on sex and their emotions still the bass of decision making causes temporary transient life that is all ready short lived then out of desperation to save face the super world power individual has become redundancy itself hiding away in the end and waiting for their own ennnnddddd. Mankind has reached the threshold where the only decision is any longer the hollowing knell of irrationality and dishonesty while the decision can only be shed reject exterpate the hurt harm diminishment of each and any one individual the only real minority. Then each individual will have dumped the theatrical death oriented divide and rule closed ended universe brute force mentality. And instead of this horribly sick joke migrating to your end ---- the cosmos  galaxies and the universe will be open to valuable people to exploit and use the substance matter universe to create the \\"happiness\\" the only real emotion that can be obtained by value producers. Without those brave and courages creator-producers these words you would not now be reading, as much what is represented in this movie only a few stories of the larger picture of a well practiced barbarism that allows individuals to take this kind incorrigible envy seen as the norm and not notice their entire thought word and deed are pathetic vindictiveness. These movie moguls aid in passing off hate mongering in all it's venues as religion and govern-ment  have intended and as a result are continuing their dark agenda for now a few millinia. The protocol questions that mankind has to answer are easily solved whence the imposter powers that be are allowed to wallow in their self created incompetence and eventually die while those who count ( individuals that value their one and only mortal existence) continue not in some bogus gormandizing pragmatist imaginary life orientation bigotry , instead without those value destroyers actually have created happiness forever ,an entire 180% turn around. Just not even an addendum to this 60's 70's era look busy flurry of dung. This movie gave the guild an income for a short time. I can see them giddily giggling behind the seen. Probably not for long...................
B008Y212PI|3.0|Pictures are fun, on easy level it's an amusement..no thinking necessary to have a bit of fun before moving on to something else. The graphics are nice.
B00F8H0LM2|1.0|From what I could tell, this is a preview of a website where you have to pay a monthly fee.  I may be wrong.
B00EY7LT9Q|4.0|I like this new series but expected more super heroes. This is more like a spy series where talented people do great stuff. The only one with real super powers so far ended up exploding. None the less it is entertaining and has pretty good story lines with unexpected turns in the plot. It will keep you coming back for more
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I loved the premise of this series. Like Ender's Game and so many others, it started small with the symbolic story of one human being who changed the whole system.<br /><br />But like Speaker for the Dead and Ender in Exile and the rest of the books after, Insurgent and Allegiant didn't satisfy me. The transition from Triss's life to the story of the entire world around Chicago did not go well - I still felt way too attached to Triss as a character and was constantly waiting for her relationship with Tobias to take another step forward. It was this expectation, this connection to Triss and Tobias that kept me reading until the end, not the changing of the world. And when Roth took that away from me at the end, I could barely make myself read the rest.<br /><br />I still give this series four stars. I have never felt so connected to a character (save in the Hunger Games. I honesty can't put Triss or Katniss ahead of each other) I loved the characters and the story and the setting and the writing style - but part of what makes a five-star story is when all these elements work together to make a stronger whole. This book had all the parts but they just weren't in synch. For that, I take off one star.<br /><br />Overall, a still a really nice read. :)
B00005O3VC|5.0|A true classic and Monty Python's best full cinema release.  Love the movie, but it would be far better to include additional digital clips, suitable for Facebook and Twitter posting, instead of long-winded additional DVD content.  Perhaps someday we'll see the studios recognizing the benefit of social media and passionate fans.  Perhaps when we discover coconut-laden African swallows migrating...
1476727651|5.0|Stephen King at his best! A great plot, interesting characters, moves right along. You don't want to put it down!
B00EAI9CSY|4.0|A different twist to the run of the mill vampire movies. More character development and a more modern flavor. very haunting and strange. Good ending.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|The game is okay but I was not happy to see the 99 cent charge for 5 additional turns if you wished to continue on a screen that you failed to complete.  Yes, it's not mandatory but it strikes me as a sneaky way to add additional costs.
B00FWLTPU8|5.0|This is not a heavy movie.  It does not contain a lot of deep character exploration or thought provoking dialogue.  However, it does contain a lot of fun.  If you've had enough of our serious world and want to escape for a couple of hours, then this is a good choice.  I watched it on &#34;pizza and a movie&#34; night with my sons, and everyone enjoyed it.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Thoroughly researched, and accessible to the non-scholarly, this book provides a window into the evolution of Christianity and the profound influence of the writings of Paul on the development of the religion. No doubt, though, that Jesus the man is a fascinating figure!
B005G48Y58|5.0|This is a refreshing take on the deadly assassin archetype. Innocence and lethal skills combined in a compelling main character makes for a intriguing action packed spy film.  In spite of the child actress it is not really a family movie.  Very violent.  One of my favorites!
B0011EU0NG|5.0|My little boy's FAVORITE movie (tho' we have to skip a few parts :o). We bought this DVD as a back-up, in case Netflix takes the movie away.
B00ESY7QXI|3.0|Wife wanted to watch it.  It was alright.  Was not a real classic like I heard some people make it out to be.  DiCaprio was good in his role.  Cinematography was very good though.
B00FJU1HLC|5.0|Loved this movie! Great for kids too  me and my fiancé were laughing through the whole thing. Great to watch together as a fun movie!
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|Another great Star Trek remake. Khan is intensely cold and ruthless; almost chilling.  Definitely the guy you love to hate!  He is way more intense than the original character in the old series. Spock is more emotionally connected in this new series which I also find appealing and more realistic. Nichelle was a tough act to follow but Zoe is great as Uhura; I like the fact that her character has more intellectual depth in the new series and her mad communication skills are more in the forefront. A viable difference between the perception of women between the original series and today. The new character's fluent Klingon in this film contrasts sharply with the stumbling dialogue of the original Uhura character during the conversation with the Rura Penthe outpost guards in &#34;Undiscovered Country&#34;. Karl Urban as Bones is probably the most like the original character. He delivers solid continuity between the old and the new. Chris' acting style is refreshingly different from William's and he portrays the character with fresh precision and realism. The new Star Trek characters keep the best of the old and add a fresh modern flavor which makes them relevant and engaging. The old Khan movie was not one of my favorites but this new one is so much better. The special effects were spectacular, non stop action and surprising turns in the plot. Just writing about it makes me want to watch it again!  Overall a very entertaining Trek experience.  Highly recommended.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is addictive to gamers. I really enjoy the game. It is challenging. It is infruriating, frustrating, and awesome. Get it you will really enjoy it.
1451695195|4.0|I loved this book.  I already believe in an afterlife, but it is so interesting to read about someone having this journey.  I only didn't rate it 5 stars because at the end of the book, it got very scientifically technical and I just wasn't interested in that aspect.  I would recommend it to almost everyone however. Science and belief in God are NOT at odds!
B00F7YHDWC|1.0|i didnt really like i thought it was pretty stupid.  i didnt have very much fun. the video was cute for a sec. but the game was pretty annoying it mainly repeated the same four things.
1400069807|5.0|Great research job! All American should read this and open their eyes to the lies the pharmacy and food industry is feeding us, along with the help of the government.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|.......a Vampire and a Witch??!!  I really  loved this book and am now reading the second one!<br /><br />Read this book if you are into the unusual!

B00992CF6W|5.0|I need redstone! The redstone update is needed. Wish u could get redstone through ore. All in all, it's a great game! Buy it immediately!
B00G32VYDG|4.0|It reminded me of MIB. It was fun to watch. I would have liked to have seen a few more scenes using the old Chinese man and blond woman.
B00001QEE7|5.0|I SAW THIS MOVIE WHEN IT CAME OUT, AND I LOVED IT THEN, STILL DO. NOW THAT I HAVE A LITTLE ONE OF MY OWN I AM ALWAYS ON THE LOOKOUT FOR WHOLESOME AGE APPROPRIATE ENTERTAINMENT. THIS LOVELY MOVIE FITS THE BILL. GREAT STORY, AND SONGS, WITH A GOOD VILLAIN. MY ONLY COMPLAINT (A SMALL ONE) WOULD BE THAT I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO SEE THE PRINCE DECIDE TO COME LIVE UNDER THE SEA WITH ARIEL, AS SHE DID SO MUCH TO MEET AND BE WITH HIM. THIS DOES NOT DETRACT FROM THE FILM GETTING A 5 STAR RATING FROM ME. THIS IS THE MOVIE WHICH STARTED DISNEY ANIMATION BACK TO THE TOP AGAIN. AFTER THIS CAME BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, AND THE LION KING.
B004OR199G|5.0|Exactly what I needed to allow myself to de-stress and jump start my new and improved self. Each day is a chance to become more intentional, gracious, and happy. Kris Carr reminded me of that. I recommend this book to everyone, especially if you feel like something needs to change in your life to become better.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|its a fun app but I wish you didn't need to have wi-fi. very colorful graphics. I love the nemo app!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I. am totally hooked!  I. surprise myself as I. go along finding the clues.  I am so glad for the help that is there as I make the journey.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|,,,and habit-forming for spare moments during any time of any day, with a unique reward system to make it so engaging.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|My entire family talked all about this game. Finally is all I got! Took for ever but here it is.  I don't have any other comments.  Got to get on with this.
B009ZQC7MY|3.0|In the third season of the crawley story, it becomes evident that the writers are running out of ideas.  I started this season chomping at the bit for more.  I ended it not caring if there is a season 4.
B00BPDR3F6|4.0|I found this book to be entertaining but not deep or fascinating. There is some interesting information about plants and mosses in particular. Our heroine develops an interesting relationship late in life that changes her life for awhile and the people around her seem to take the focus off her from time to time.<br /><br />All in all a pretty long book highlighting the many different relationships with humans and plants the star of the book develops over a lifetime. It has some very well developed characters around the main person who is the focus of the book.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Different way of keeping players coming again and again. A certain talent and an affinity for such puzzles in definitely required for one to enjoy it.
B00000099Y|5.0|Awesome! Arguably their best record to date. It's timeless; doesn't have a particular sound that associates it with an era.
B00C8S9VKM|4.0|I enjoyed Bryson's recapitulations of personalities and events woven into a story about one historic summer.  I found it particularly enjoyable as it was the year of my birth.  I have enjoyed much of the other work by Bryson, and this book matched his standards.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I really enjoyed the first two books. Sadly, my enjoyment ended with the first chapter of Allegiant. I spent more time trying to figure out whose point of view I was reading than anything else. This was the first of the three that made me feel bored and like I had laundry calling my name...
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|...but it must be said.  This game keeps you coming back again and again because of the concept and progression to levels just a bit more difficult than the one before.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|This book was an easy read yet had a powerful message. If we use these 4 agreements in our daily life we will have a life of peace and happiness.
006202406X|1.0|This book was a total let down.  I agree with all of the other reviews on how Tris should have not died but that is not my problem with this book.  My problem is in the revolution if you even want to call it that.  There was no action what so ever.  It ended in possibly the lamest way possible. Ms. Roth needs to take some notes from J.K. Rowling or Suzanne Collins on how to end a series!!! If you havent read it yet don't! You will be just wasting your time. Find another series that wont make you act like Pat Solitano (Silver Linings Playbook) when he finished reading Hemmingway!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this game is so addicting! the graphics are very well done and so far I have had no problems with it
B005LAIGOQ|2.0|Picture was so dark , hard to see what was going on and kind of boring.I was disappointed with this DVD.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Love it! Smart, witty, couldn't get enough. I would highly recommend it. This is one of those shows, you wish this episodes were longer...
B00F91RYL8|5.0|By Ben Reed-<br /><br />WWZ is the best movie I have ever seen..I have watched it three times in two days. My dad and my brother and I loved it.  Plenty of action and some subtle humor.  You need to pay attention or you might miss an important clue to the coming scenes.  Wear your glasses.  It has subtitles that you must read. The audio volume is too low to reliably understand the dialogue.
B0044KI79S|5.0|I love this show and others who have followed it know why! It's entertainment, simply put. The show isn't hard to follow. It is two brothers doing the best they can against the supernatural evil of the world. Family is most important and protecting them at any cost.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|I like this game and my grandkids like it to play it when I am there. My grandkids want more games like this
1455121924|5.0|The CD are a great way to listen to this book. It is all true from the wheat DNA restructuring to the pounds coming off.<br />I have shared these CD with many people. Great Buy for Christmas!<br /><br />John
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I have really enjoyed playing this game.  It is so much fun!!  I especially like that it was free and didn't cost anything.
B00ARN0ZF0|3.0|After watching PA4, i decided that this movie was ok, not as good as the first one thru the third.  It did have some scary moments but it's not worth watching again.
B00FRCNNVY|5.0|I had just watched Anoushka play on my &#34;Concert for George&#34; DVD the other day. I was in the mood for great Indian music. It makes it that much better to see her team up with her half sister Norah Jones for a few tracks.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Everyone in our book club really enjoyed this book!  Multiple themes, and the past/present presentation, as well as the wonderful plot line made this book a joy to read.  It's one of those rare books you can't put down!
B004LQJPEG|5.0|I'm listening to William Friedkin's  book currently and wanted to revisit the movie I hadn't seen in many years. its really great to know some of the background of the movie
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|A friend of mine suggested I give this game a try since she knew I love hidden object games. I downloaded it and immediately loved this game.  If hidden objects and puzzles are your thing this is a must have!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|It was a very good book and I will probably read it again if I have time so read it !
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|el mejor programa que e encontrado paara aprender ingles y con gramatica vocabulario se lo recomiendo a cualquier persona es muy facil de usar
B00FEX2ZFG|4.0|First, there are no true ghost stories.  Ghosts, like fairies and witches, do not exist.  But if you like to suspend your intellect and enjoy a childhood fantasy, then this is a reasonably good movie with which to do that.  Other reviewers have already explained the story line adequately, so I'll just tell you that it is a decent effort at spooking an audience and not grossing you out with torture and gore.  My kind of story.  To me the movie MAMA was a better movie.  More scares and a better story.  But this one is still very entertaining.  Wait a minute.  What's that noise?  Who's here?  What are you . . . AHHHHHH!
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|I downloaded this while on a weekend vacation. It started to rain and I decided to try to play...well needless to say my husband had to take it away from me. And I don't even like to hunt! Great game and loads of challenges for a rainy day!
B006GECE9Y|1.0|I'm giving this one star not for the product, but for Amazon's distribution. Dolphin is a much better web browser than Silk, but I couldn't find it on the app store.<br /><br />I have a Kindle Fire with system version 10.4.6 and I have to say this browser was not available for my device. It even said as I searched for it on the Amazon store that it is not compatible with my tablet. So I did what I will end up doing for every piece of software I want to run on my Kindle Fire, I downloaded the apk file for Dolphin on my computer and side-loaded it into my Kindle Fire.<br /><br />Guess what, it works perfectly. And not only that, it works at least 3-times faster than the included Silk browser and plays Flash video with no problem.<br /><br />Why I couldn't just download this program from the app store from my Fire baffles me. Amazon needs to give up on it's silk browser and give the consumers a choice.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|The twists and turns come hard and fast. It is a page turner and I did not expect that kind of book. Definite must read for the series.
B009YG2ND8|5.0|This has to be at least the 3rd time I've bought FF3 (the others being the Playstation and gameboy releases).  But that's proof that the original Final Fantasy series is worth playing again and again.<br />It's a great port of the game.  Other than some occasional hesitation in the soundtrack the game plays flawlessly.<br />If there is a complaint, its that the movement system is touchy.  Movement is achieved by putting your finger on the screen at which point a circle will appear.  You then move your finger in the direction you want to move in.  The movement control could have been tuned a little better as it's hard to move a a walking pace.  It goes from no movement to running with only a little movement of your finger so fine movements are harder to achieve.  The main places where this can be annoying is while exploring dungeons and when moving the airship.<br />Other than movement the game is true to the original and fun to play.<br />The graphics are good for a game of this vintage, but some pixelation is noticeable most of the time.<br /><br />I reccomend this game for the kindle.  it's a true classic RPG game
0385351399|5.0|One of my favorite authors for many years, Dave Eggers again illustrates his mastery of prose and ability to engage his reader in the textured worlds he creates. Thoroughly enjoyed this, and would highly recommend it!
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|I would absolutely recommend this to anyone. When I got this, I thought that this game wouldn't be that great lime most of the games on kindle, but I was wrong. This game is amazing. It has a lot of customization. Some problems are that it doesn't work when you try to connect to facebook, which means if you ever delete the app and redownload it, nothing will be left. And the Gold syatem really sucks.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It is exciting to see a such a destined Sci-Fi Classic emerging in real time, and be part of the fan culture surrounding it.  Hugh Howey's WOOL omnibus is the gate way to this culture.  Packaged as five stories that could almost stand on their own, yet mean so much more when put together, it makes for a very quick engaging read, the leaves you both satisfied and thirsting for more.  It took me less than a week to finish this series and am grateful that I got hooked on it late enough that there were more books ready for me.
006202406X|1.0|I am thoroughly disappointed in the book. I read the first two books in 5 days and bought the third book yesterday.<br /><br />1. I hated the ending. It was a pathetic attempt to shock the readers.<br /><br />2. The different point of views caught me off guard and reminded me of the \\"Legend\\" series by Marie Lu.<br /><br />3. There was no point in adding the GD v GP conflict if she wasn't going to<br /><br />4. Who is Edith Prior? She came and left within 5 minutes. There should've been a deeper connection between Edith and Tris other than revealing the truth.<br /><br />5. Why kill Uriah? Especially with all of the advanced technology and scientists.<br /><br />6. Why just make Marcus vanish? I thought Tobias would've finally overcame that fear.<br /><br />7. I imagined Tris and Tobias finally getting the life they wanted together in the new city.<br /><br />8. Don't create such a high sexual tension between the two if they aren't going to do something. Tobias didn't even get to say bye to Tris.<br /><br />All in all, the book was very rushed. I would've been content with waiting for a fourth book if I had to. Yes, I cried at the end because Tris didn't deserve to die and Tobias didn't deserve to be alone. I don't care if they are VR's characters. Such a great disparity between the first two books and Allegiant should be criticized. The whole book sucked. And I am not even going to bring up the disappointment I had with the Allegiant rebels. Again, another attempt at hyping up the book and not actually completely the plot.
B0094K1PW4|3.0|It has some ET-reminiscent moments, mixed with classic SciFi themes (town cops vs alien invader) with a smattering of recent SciFi issues (the US government is the other bad guy)  Some characters (especially the kids) look and sound like they strayed over from a Stephen King movie. And it gets a little campy here and there but nicely so.<br /><br />Were it not for the tremendous hype this flick got prior to release and the intriguing ad campaign that raised expectations, I might have liked it more. It would make a fun surprise find if one were flipping channels on a Saturday and had never heard of this film. This and Clover fit hand in hand as Big News Big Deal Films of subsequent disappointment.
B00CHVJI08|5.0|Excellent! Got a kick out of the belt!!! Toy was kid friendly an wasn't a cheap toy. The movie was liked by kids of all ages.
B0065RIJ3W|5.0|I've been on an aquaponic reading binge for 2 months. This book cleared up many questions and I'm ready to build my first system.
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|I'm an old die hard Alice in Chains (Rock) fan...  This is definitely the good stuff.<br />I am always looking to purchase music of the Genre.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I grew up around horses, but am highly allergic to the real thing.  With this app I can still enjoy them in a realistic environment,  just without the torture of a severe allergy attack!  Love it!
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|Having read nearly all of Bryson's books, I was excited to get the notice One Summer was coming out and I was not disappointed.  Great history storytelling crafted in his wonderful way.  I love having some of the stories we all know (Lindbergh, '27 Yankees) interwoven with ones we don't.  Highly recommended.
B00BEIYMAG|4.0|This Movie , The Conjuring was a great and scary movie that I have seen in a long time. I hope others will think so too.
B00BTHWFHE|5.0|Had an opportunity to see Sabbath at the Irvine Amphitheatre with Ozzy fronting the Band recently. The three piece band delivered big time with a performance to knocked my F--n socks off.<br />Purchased 13 after the concert and is one of my all-time favorites.  If your a Sabbath fan this will not disappoint. Check out &#34;God is Dead&#34;.<br />The Jimn8tr
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun ... Very addicting ... Saw my daughter playing it looked interesting ... Ten I was hooked =( fun for killing time
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|For those I would say born after 1980, this should be required viewing.  If you appreciate the development and creation of rock music, you will really wish you could of lived through this time.
B004LWZW24|4.0|This movie is great and cant wait for the second film to come out. Hope the second movie is as good as the first.
B00B7FOQCK|4.0|The Anker USB 3.0 4-port hub is great. The only problem I have is that it wont read my Seagate 2 TB ext harddrive, so I have to plug that into an available 3.0 port on my PC. Also to note, although the Seagate 2TB HDD doesnt work when plugged into a power outlet as well as the 4-port hub. My USB 2.0. Western Digital 1TB HDD will read while plugged into the hub.<br /><br />Overall, it's great. I would have given it a  5 star review if it read my USB 3.0 drive.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|What else can you expect from a John Grisham novel?  Twists, turns and action.  Might be a little light on the intense, heart pounding action, but I enjoyed it anyway.
B0024CEY36|4.0|As always, Ken Follett surprise you with a very elaborated trama. After a read the 2 first books of the 20th Century trilogy I became fan of the author and I`m trying to read all his books. I loved the World Without End.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|I am shocked by a lot of the negative reviews on this book. I was also very annoyed by the choice of ending but I don't think that should detract from what was otherwise a great read.<br /><br />The twists and turns are genuinely good and mostly unexpected. It is very rare that a big twist can feel natural and geniune in a book without being telegraphed or overdone. It was very subtle in places.<br /><br />As many have stated the ending is a huge dissapointment. Of the six or seven endings that I could imagine this choice was definetly the weakest. I would also say that it is rare that I read a book that almost every character can be hated but I genuinely disliked almost everyone in the book (save for a few lesser characters). It creates a weird sensation of not being sure who you want to win the day.<br /><br />Read it.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|This will be the last book I read from Veronica Roth.  If this is her idea of a great ending, something that she is proud of, then she can keep her stories and I'll keep my money and my time.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Way too much fun!! This game works very well on my phone and I wish it wasn't so addictive! This game would definitely be worth paying for, but getting it for free is even better!!
B00F91RYL8|3.0|It's 30 minutes too long.<br />It's one of those &#34;the globe&#34; needs to saved movies, and only 1 person can save it (Brad).
B005544TRQ|5.0|This series is one of the best programs going. The actors are top notch and the scripts keep me coming back for more very week during the season. Need more shows like this one and less reality shows.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Addictive but too many ads for cash purchases.  Not really &#34;free.&#34;.  Enjoy the challenge of clearing new levels.  Good for all ages.
B0071BGOJC|5.0|I am a Ken Follett fan.His books are so well researched & Winter of the Worlds is no exception.<br />I have recomended it to everyone I know.
B000GWE44U|5.0|I hate this movie<br />Now that I have that out of the way...<br />Nicholson in his most quoted role<br />Scatman Crothers used terribly (why I hate the movie) but a memorable role.<br />Shelly Duvall being really vulnerable<br />Incredible steadicam work.<br />(With a commentary track with the steadicam's inventor as well as a Kubrick biographer.)<br />It's not King's book (a VW is crushed in the film which may be a reference/commentary on King & his (book) version.- go view room 237 or whatever the number is<br />It's an amazing film and if I hadn't read the book I would have loved it.<br />But I read the book which is not better but it is the view I had first...<br />I can hardly wait to see what the remake of &#34;Carrie&#34; does to me!!!
006202406X|2.0|I finished the book about a week ago so I am not jumping into this review without thought.<br /><br />This book missed the mark for me. I didn't hate it, but I also didn't love it like I loved the other two. The new characters weren't built on; they were just added for the purpose of the conclusion. None of the new characters play a huge part and none of them make me like this book more. We lose the old scenery of the Divergent/Insurgent stories and are brought into the world of (psychotic) normalcy. The community we knew is gone and now the characters are in a government building full of U.S. government people. It was just... boring. I missed all the characters that died in Insurgent and I missed the factions! Veronica Roth did not make up for those losses with anything worthy of them in this last installment.<br /><br />*Spoilers - but won't give too much away:<br /><br />The only thing I can honestly say I liked about the book was Tris and Tobias's connection growing. I loved Tris's realization about their relationship.<br /><br />I feel like Veronica Roth planned to take her series one direction and then when it came down to writing the last book she changed it. I feel this way because what Edith Prior says at the end of Insurgent is not true; which is strange. Why would Edith Prior or the Bureau leave a message at all, why not just go in a release everyone once there are more divergents in the population. This and many other things are odd about this last book.<br /><br />To me a good book is one that I want to read again and again. This books ending left me depressed and I honestly don't know if I'll ever read the series again. Before this final book came out I probably read the first two (Divergent and Insurgent) two times waiting for the last one to hit the market. Now I don't think I could read any of the books without knowing the depressing future of the characters. I get killing off characters (HP reference: I mean when Fred died I was devastated but it added to my attachment to the books, you don't see JK Rowling killing off the entire Wesley family! That would be outrageous!! Same with Hunger Games... even that brutal series didn't kill off everyone) but there is a limit to how much an audience can take.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I have been using Logitech for years. I have used wireless versions for over 10 years, all types. Each one gave me glitches (like obamacare) in that, in my work (cad drawing)the mouse was not keeping up with the drawing and, at time, would pause before continuing...very frustrating.<br />I decided to finally get a new mouse and decided on plug in since I am tired of rechargeable and battery models. After spending some time on Amazon, searching for a replacement (wanted to stay away from Microsoft and Logitech brands for personal reasons) I came across this mouse my chance. Never heard the brand but saw that it had good reviews and features (extra buttons, weights, control) that I wanted. I purchased it, unsure what to expect but, for the cost, it was worth the risk.<br />Received the product and have been using it for a month now. Do you know that tight chest, stress feeling when you work with a product that performs poorly to what you expected to work flawlessly? That is what I felt like with the logitech brand. After using this product, the stress left and I no longer dread going on the computer and can finally work efficiently. The product exceeded my expectations.<br />Good product to use, give it a try
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It may not be a good thing to have candy crush but I Love It. Now to figure how to get work done!!!
B001HM1PFO|5.0|The original, perhaps best, Midnight Movie, presented in DTS 7.1. There are options that stagger like a black and white intro (more like 16 minute) that perfectly fits the intro song (most of the films it references were black and white- except Forbidden Planet with Anne Francis-long before she was Honey West). There's the British  version that has &#34;Heroes&#34;. There's, to me, a really useless little book the blu ray comes pacjked in- but it IS cute I guess.<br />The movie is FUN-a Susan Sarandon you can accept as virginal. A Tim Curry who MUST be an alien. Richard O'Brien who created it in a great role (sneering Time Warp beautifully)....and more, much more.<br />Hard to believe that it made little money before finding the Midnight circuit.<br />Not for kiddies I guess....
B002APU580|5.0|I love this movie.It is a good movie. It tells the same story as the book in a different medium.
B000IZAHB4|4.0|I've seen a it few times & notice how well all aspects are tied in.  Special effects are good but its the story that really makes it good.  SPOILER ALERT DON'T READ PAST THIS!!!  It's sad at the end and no special effects were needed just your imagination carries you away to the horror of it.
B000V39KDO|5.0|Great movie cant wait to the second movie<br />Thumbs up!!!<br />The timing was accurate for the date and no delay
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Quickly addictive game, so glad it is on Kindle now!  Some levels you can fly through and others can take days, but it's all a challenge.
1465414444|5.0|Amazing book, love the art and the lore. It's a lot bigger than i expected too. Answered all the questions i had about the lore of WoW
B0040I09RM|5.0|After Breaking Bad ended, I wondered if there would ever be another show that could compare.  Well, turns out there is and that show is Sons of Anarchy.<br /><br />I'm a bit annoyed that my friends who have been watching this show since it started didn't clue me into it's yummy goodness.  I've always been hesitant to watch new TV shows (the years spent dedicated to &#34;Lost&#34; only to be let down, put a scar on my soul) but this series does not disappoint.  I've watched 3 seasons in a week and a half…..acting is extraordinary, story line is awesomely twisted and the  characters are fascinating.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This is a good book. It wasn't what I expected which was a pleasant surprise. I can't wait to read the next one!
B00G32TD98|3.0|It's not that scary. I was expecting a lot because if all of the hype. It was ok and worth the. $4.00 to rent.
B003BVFZ4Q|3.0|Enjoyed the biography parts very much. Read as part of a book club. Wasn't so interested in the writing chapters.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|its a good family friendly game. simple graphics and uncomplicated concepts.definately something I will share with my family far and wide. fun for All.
B004UNX1LS|1.0|It's a very good app but it does not have the genre or anything that I listen.to. It's upsetting. :(
B00FWLSLJ4|4.0|This was a fun one to watch with the kids. Liked the special effects. It reminded me of some of the old monster movies but updated with a cool twist.
B00FWPWNKS|5.0|I enjoyed the first Fruit Drops and now I'm hooked on Fruit Drop II. Hard to put down until you have met the challenge. You will get hooked.
B00E7RZEI0|4.0|The first couple of levels of this are so easy I almost stopped playing this and would have deleted it from my Kindle Fire as it was so basic and easy I assumed it was a game for very little kids.  The graphics are smooth and colourful and the parts that are supposed to look like water do look like water, it drips and sprays, rebounds of surfaces and everything like real water behaves.  The alien or whatever the character in the crane with hose attached is, though is very basic and enhances the feel on first glance that this is a game for toddlers.  However it certainly gets a lot more difficult as you progress and you even move from being on land to having to go on sailing boats (which are of course on fire), knock boulders onto platforms or buttons to get them to move so you can move forwards onto them and things like this and at the same time put out fires before they get large enough that you're told a house burnt down and it's game over for that level.  The fact you don't have a lot of water also makes the later levels a lot more challenging as you can't afford to waste a drop, which means you're pretty unlikely to complete a level the first time round.  A fun game, but a simple one.<br /><br />This game can be played in airplane mode, you don't need to be connected to Wi-Fi once it is downloaded onto your device.  The imagery looks great on a high definition screen such as a Kindle Fire.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is a great game with good quality and the graphics are great I recommend this game to horse and animal lovers.:)
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Theo is the best you got to get it. I play it all the time.if you don't get this app I will get you.
B009HNDCC4|5.0|I love this show and I love having it in my video library.  This is better than a hard copy because I can access it on my tablet.
B00FI7XBIS|3.0|This is an okay basic game that will pass the time.  You don't need to be connected to Wi-Fi to play it once it's downloaded which is great as you can play it anywhere your stuck having to wait around.  Basically your controlling a bat to fly around a screen through very mild maze obstacles and avoiding death from the light of lantern being carried by skeletons, other bats that don't like you and lantern light from fixed lanterns.  You can also throw rocks (but you only have a certain number), or bombs on some levels at the lanterns to smash the light (if it is unprotected) or get the light to sway so you can get past when the beam is going the other way.  You can knock over or blow up the skeletons with these two.  Basically your goal is to reach the bed of a sleeping young female in each castle so you can transform into human form and sink your fangs into her neck.<br /><br />The problem though is the controls for aiming and throwing the rocks/bombs.  They aren't smooth and easy to operate, often just moving the aiming beam (or whatever you'd call it) causes the throwing of an object.  The graphics in the game itself aren't as good as the load up images (ones you see in the product images) but are still interesting enough.<br /><br />It's not a game I'll play all the time but if in an airport or somewhere for a fair amount of time I'll probably give it another go when I've got sick of reading whatever Kindle book I'm up to and bored with the games I play more often.
B00CPLGGXM|5.0|Pros:  For entry-level gaming, even with 1333mhz RAM, this thing is fantastic.  It Maxes out Oblivion, and fear without hardly a stutter.  As this is my first build I must say, well done, AMD.<br /><br />Cons:  Runs hot,  even with Arctic Silver 5 and a hyper 212 evo on top of it, I still get 60's under load and 40's at idle.  However I don't know whether to call this a con just yet!<br /><br />P.s:  Did a Handbrake video encode.  The temps jumped from 40 to 95 FAST under 100% load.  However this may be a software issue.<br /><br />I think this is a good purchase if you are new to building , or are just starting out in gaming.
0399159347|5.0|I have never been a fiction reader until the last couple of years, always thought if it wasn't real, it wasn't worth my time.  When I read this book I knew what I'd been missing!  This writer knows the ins, the outs, and what it's all about! Try THE HUSBAND'S SECRET for some great entertainment!
B0015AARJI|4.0|The controller functions as it should and although it was used, it is still in excellent condition.  However, when it arrived it was very dirty.  I had to wipe it down and attempt to scrape all the built up dust/dirt out of the indentions around the buttons.  This was an easy task, but I have no idea where that controller has been and I was reluctant to touch the &#34;dirt.&#34;
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is awesome! It sometimes drives me crazy when I get stuck on a level and can't pass it for a while!
B00ECU2RGY|3.0|Oblivion is a good science fiction flick, but not a great one. The plot twists are predictable, but the action is good and the story is interesting. If you are looking for a science fiction flick and are willing to ignore the plot holes, check it out.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|another great book from the master.... he gets in your head at times... this book is a great read .beautiful...
B002N57W9M|5.0|Hats off to the Scandinavians and their ability to pen great tunes (Abba, A-Ha, Ace of Base, Bel Canto, Robyn, The Cardigans, Royksopp, Leaves). However, Roxette take some beating and this is their masterpiece. And what a voice Marie Fredriksson has. If you are a lover of great pop music, you really shouldn't be without this release.
B0079XPUOW|4.0|Scalzi tells a hilarious and very meta tale in Redshirts, both with genial foible-poking and fun-making at many of the tropes present in Star Trek episodes, and then turns everything on its head by making the whole thing a universe created by a TV show writer, taking the concepts of world-building and character creation to a literal level. Scalzi fills this book with an off-the-wall brain-twisty situation that’s at the same time wonderfully realistic, with well-developed characters and witty humour both in dialogue and narration. Although that’s Redshirts’s strength, it’s also the book’s weakness, presenting a complex and inventive plot like in such a short book. I’ll grant you, dragging it out would have ruined the punchy humour, and the novel was fast-paced without being rushed, it felt very much like literary junk food – it’s there and then it’s gone.<br /><br />Still, it was a fun read, witty and creative and it actually made me laugh aloud a few times, so it still gets praise from me. It’s worth reading if you’re a fan of Star Trek, and if episodes of the show featured prominently in your youth, but otherwise, it’s hit-or-miss as to whether this book will make an impact on you.<br /><br />(Full review on [...]
B0040I09RM|5.0|Had me hooked and binge watched 4 seasons in 1 weekend! Excellent writing! I am just starting season 6 and it's just as good as previous 5 seasons.
B008476HBM|4.0|This is a great book filled with words of wisdom. This is a great book filled with intelligent philosophy. I really enjoyed reading it and clearly even back then they had a good idea we would be encountering the troubles we are facing now and they tried to set up protection devices (through our laws) but it seems we just ignored the subtle warnings. The law is no longer there to protect the people and we have forgotten our history and why we have a constitution and what the Magna Carta is for. This book is well written and easy to read.
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|Never really been  a Coldplay fan until I heard this. I remember saying to my better half at the time it was released that they should pack it in now since they would never top this. After hearing the bland Myloxyloto, I may be right. Is this Coldplay's Revolver,  Abbey Road? Could be. A really cohesive vision with nary a mediocre track on the album. The odd bit of fluff but overall this is a weighty album, and that irritating falsetto is kept under wraps for the most part. They were on a songwriting high with Viva la Vida. Hats off to them if they can ever top this, but I can't say I'll be holding my breath.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I don't usually like to read but this book was a great read. I couldn't put the book down. The book held my attention and was easy to follow along. The book is a great detailed description of the greatest day in the war on terror!
6302765536|5.0|Bought this when VCR were still popular. Nice video and audio quality.  Nice to watch with your friends and family.
B00BHNQ5XK|2.0|B-Rate movie at best, it definately left me wanting. Its more of a possession movie than a horror or thriller flick.
B00BEIYMAG|5.0|By far the best horror film. The movie is based on a true story and has a great story behind it. I convinced my wife to watch after seeing 3 times in the theater. Great movie!
B006RXPTNM|5.0|Phillip Seymour Hoffman had a great year in 2008 as he starred in both Charlie Kaufman's 'Synecdoche, New York' and in 'Doubt', an understated drama in which he portrays a young and optimistic priest who finds himself at odds with a strict nun played by Meryl Streep. Both performances are fantastic, each actor perfectly capturing every emotional nuance of their character. Every line has meaning and is delivered to a T by the amazing talented cast.<br /><br />Doubt is based off a play by the film's director, John Patrick Shanley. The film is composed mainly of dialogue scenes, but the lack of cinematic action is compensated by the beautiful cinematography and set design. Doubt is a period piece set in the mid-60's and captures that time period very well. The plot itself is symbolic of the culture clash that occurred at that time, one of the film's many layers.<br /><br />Doubt is mostly carried by the performances of the two main leads, who do a masterful job of portraying these very complex and emotional characters dealing with some very intense and contentious situations. I highly recommend this film.
B00005LOUP|5.0|Excellent animation and very good audio and video quality. Nice to watch with your friends and family. Menu & special features are nice.
B0019FOC5E|5.0|I love, love, LOVE this movie and the soundtrack. It's fun to hear a newer spin on the old ABBA songs.
B0035OC7OU|3.0|As fun as this one is to read by itself, it is to my mind inferior to the later Discworld novels in almost all regards. Namely, the story lacks integrity, the characters (especially the title one) are too quickly and unexplainedly developed, and, most irritatingly, the ending is almost literally too Deus Ex Machina-ish.<br /><br />But anyway, as a Death starter, this is probably a must read for a Discworld fan wishing to consume each and every of the novels.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|I love this game. Almost exactly synced with facebook. Sometimes forgets I already beat bonus level. But never takes away what I earned.
B004P1JDJO|5.0|I am an organization development consultant who works with companies all over the US and Canada. Over the last year I've gone on a research binge around how companies can help first level leaders succeed. I've really focused on the most recent research, but I've also tried to catch up on other books I should have read but hadn't. This was one of them. Like other Dan Pink books (To Sell is Human is highly recommended) this is both superbly researched and entertaining to read. If you are new to motivation theory this book will save you tons of time and it's where I'd start (wish I'd read it when it was released). It is a terrific book (the practical exercises are valuable for anyone - whether you are a leader in an organization or just leading yourself - which are mostly the same thing). Highly recommended.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Love this show. Amazing story, great actors, and awesome situations. I would recommend this series to any and every one.
B000X418UO|5.0|All star cast. Great movie in great quality. Once you go Blu ray you cannot go back! Even a movie from the 90's like Con Air in 1080p and surround sound. it just cannot be beat.
B0052RDHTM|3.0|Interesting tales that are not well developed. Has historical interest that is well researched but with particular social agenda. Sexual parts are vulgar and quite hedonistic. Good writing technique serves the reader..<br />t

B003O86FMW|5.0|After reading \\"The Hunger Games\\" by Suzanne Collins and seeing the movie, also, I had to read \\"Catching Fire\\" because the story certainly isn't finished.  Katniss and Peeta have won the Hunger Games and the next book takes up just where \\"Hunger Games\\" ended.<br /><br />There is great unrest in the Districts and that unrest has turned into riots and violence in some.  There is not enough food for the people and many remain very poor, in contrast with those who live in the Capitol and of course, President Snow.  Katniss and Peeta are about to depart for their victory tour aboard the train, but they soon find out that Katniss becomes the face of the new revolution that is taking place since she sympathizes with the people and not with the government.<br /><br />Just about all of the characters from \\"The Hunger Games\\" are back.  It's good to see that they are still the same, but some will take up the cause with Katniss and Peeta.  There are some very difficult challenges that lie ahead for Katniss and Peeta and Katniss is not sure what is in her heart when it comes to Peeta and Gale, her hunting friend from District 12.<br /><br />There is a lot of action, some romance, fear, suspense and the introduction of some new characters who are interesting, to say the least. I found the book very enjoyable and also a page-turner and finished it in two days.  If you've read \\"The Hunger Games\\" you won't want to miss \\"Catching Fire.\\"<br /><br />Although this is YA book, people of all ages can enjoy it.

1492391719|5.0|Black Eagle Inn: Christoph Fischer<br /><br />One family tied together in a uniquely connected way as one woman would control the destiny of so many.<br />Anna Stockmann was a forceful, direct and controlling woman who from the start knew how to manipulate her siblings and pit one against he other in order to get the intended results she wanted. Within her family she would create a hierarchy of those youngsters that would advance in her favor, become part of her empire when older or feel the wrath of her tongue and discipline. Compliance was her way and with the help of her brother Hans Ulrich whose family multiplied in size allowing her help on her farm and restaurant, Anna was born to control, lead and take charge. Marrying a naïve, yet caring young woman named Magdalena, Anna was able to manipulate her as well as getting her brother to allow his children to help out on her farm hoping to groom a possible heir. From the moment she was ten years old and even younger she and her brother had a special relationship but it was his children, her nieces and nephews that provided what she needed. Black Eagle Inn and farm owned by her family, the Hinterberger's became hers when she managed to convince her father that her brother Paul was not up to the job causing him to leave and father's failing health and no one else in sight, allowed Anna to take over after making sure she eliminated the competition. But, Magdalena had one daughter born in 1940, named Maria that would change things for everyone. While one nephew named Marcus was bold, smart and took on a role in her restaurant and enjoyed people, her other nephew Lukas won her over in a different way. Helping her reconcile the books and correcting her errors in math, they developed an even closer bond than Marcus who we learn had another talent not befitting a young man that Anna preferred to discount. Maria is quite different and a rivalry ensues between her and her cousin. The time period is the Second World War, Hans Ulrich has an administrative job and with his pragmatic attitude and diligence the family seems to be able to flourish but he never seems happy.<br /><br /> Black Eagle Inn is the coveted goal of Markus and the farm the others in the family. Heimkirchen seemed unblemished by the war yet Anna Stockmann kept the reigns tight as she kept the business in tact until something happened that would change it all. Learning about the fate of her husband Herbert she was bent on carrying forward until she learned where he was and if he survived the prison camps. But, her family was bold, hard working and each of her nieces and nephews allowed to work on the farm or restaurant were given food as a reward for their toil. But, Markus was smart, cunning and knew how to play Anna and everything he wanted and did would create a rift between him and the rest of the family and a rivalry ensued that would span decades. Lukas was bright, innovative and would help Anna with the books and records until Herbert mysteriously reappears. Within the spectrum of this multi-themed novel we revisit Hans-Ulrich and his wife who are devote churchgoers and who use religion as their main focus and force in life. The Catholic community and Hans-Ulrich seem divorced in many respects from the harsh realties of the war and the politics. Anna watches this as she and her brother also drift apart and Anna takes it upon herself to teach his children the needed skills to survive in the world. The old ways are what sustains him but the war brings out qualities that most families today have but within this family unit, hate, deceit, prejudice, greed, resentment, power and control are just some of the themes author Chistoph Fischer brilliantly explores. Anna Stockmann conniving, cunning and shrewd is equally matched and outmatched by her nephew Markus whom she turned into more than a replica of herself. Lukas, the once brilliant and resourceful young man watches, learns and realizes that although Markus appearsto have a secret he does want revealed, a friend that is helping him with his deals but no one really knows the true sources of his of his contacts eventually would turn into another replica of the same.<br /><br />As the war has finally ended Germany suffers many sharp blows and the advent of the different party lines tears the war torn nation apart ever more. Recovering from the shame, having to restructure and trying to find a present that would not mirror its past, Germany forms different party lines and Hans Ulrich is in the center or thick of the Christian Party and his religious values dictates his actions as he learns the truth behind what is happening at the farm, his children are begin subjected to the wrong ways and Markus, Lukas, Otto, Martin and Maria are requested to return home but not without alienating himself from his sister who has done so much for them all. Markus, adopted by Anna remains and the fate of the rest is quite interesting as you will learn. The story is told from the viewpoints of each character given a chapter in order for readers to understand their influence upon the final outcome, the need for their story to be told and to follow in a chronological order the outcome of what happens to the Hinterberger  family. As Hans Ulrich rises in the party, Markus finds his solace in working with Anna but when Herbert returns things take on a dramatic change as he becomes rude, boisterous, demanding, abusive and tyrannical also trying to alienate her from Helga, the servant whose loyalty to Anna goes above and beyond the definition of the word. As Herbert becomes enveloped in the family's business, takes on the books, uses Lukas as his confidant and helper he hopes to learn more about Markus, his adopted son, take control over Anna but little does he suspect that two forces are working in opposition of each other but the final outcome will unite them in quite a different way. With Markus running the Inn and Lukas the farm things seemed okay until Hans Ulrich and his wife demanded the return of their children. With the aid of his children he was happier than ever for a while until something drastically changes and he once again needs the support of his sister to help.<br />Maria the golden child once part of Anna's life takes on a different role with her father changing her views, ideals and thinking. to support his Christian doctrines. But, the story is so complex that is has much more to offer as Herbert's fate is sealed in a different way, Markus dallies and meets a young Italian and together they fill ten years of their lives away from the farm and the restaurant but not before he does something that no one will ever forgive. Germany saw great changes from 1940-1976 as the author creates this timeline of events for readers introducing the Italian and Turkish immigrants within the storyline and helping readers to understand how they infiltrated the job market ten years after the new right wing party came into place in Germany. Politics plays a heavy part in this novel and although the war is over Han Ulrich position changes, his attitude is quite staunch and as a result he becomes more like a relic within his own party and hidden within his own mind not able to release his anger, tension or understand the new ways. The years pass and Maria divorces her alliance with her father as she meets a young Turkish man, falls in love and is now no longer considered part of the family. Each character is driven by greed, the need for control, power and money in his/her own way. Holding it steady and all together is Helga. Getting to know more about Marcus the fact that he is gay and how he struggles with his own identity sort of humbles him in the end as the cousins reunite, the old wounds are opened and the end will surprise readers.<br /><br />Families are quite often unique in their own structure and abilities to change, cope and address the changing times as a daughter opposes her father and the political arena is once again in the limelight just what will the outcome be when Hans Ulrich fights for his position, trying to keep what little pride in place and hopefully find some peace within himself. Before the anger and rage win out what will happen next as we see Lukas following in a similar path of destruction.<br /><br />When the end draws near we hear different voices, learn more about Maria's rise in politics, Hans Ulrich's decline and the opening of a gay bar that Markus established with the help of a childhood friend and his wife in Munich. When prejudices, fears, old feelings, power, greed, hate and suspicion cloud your eyes, wisdom and goals they win out. How far will you go to win? What is the final fate of the Black Eagle Inn, the farm and what happens when the players meet, the final meal is served and the end result you won't believe. Read this powerfully compelling novel about the Hinterberger and decide: is it really any different from what you read about in the papers today? One woman who controlled it all. Two men: Markus: Lukas: Two men vying for the attention of one woman. One woman who manipulated everything and one family torn apart by greed. Black Eagle Inn: A must read and so many lessons to be learned: Family loyalty, deceit, lies, deceptions, fear, hate, prejudice, the political scene and what happens when religion overtakes your life and the rest is clouded?
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|Love the Fire Maple Games. Wish there we're a lot more like them....maybe like Mystic and such.....<br />It had great graphics and puzzles. A bit more Back and forth, but worth it.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Intense, gripping, well written, fast paced and different enough to keep me on the edge of my seat. Handsome cast with the right blend of good guys, evil jerks and flawed lead characters.<br /><br />The script brings a great mix of repartee and wit. Fact that the theme music, wardrobes and set are totally hip doesn't hurt either. Sometimes the storyline stretches credulity but heck no show is perfect. Highly recommend if you enjoy this kind of mix. Definitely the opposite of laid back and relaxing.
B00D6BQPMM|2.0|was tempted to buy it, thought renting would be better, turns out its not like other zombie movies. rent first
B00CH26TL8|2.0|This game is going no where for me-- the focus seems to be on spending money~  graphics are good, concept is poor.!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game! It's a challenge on every level!! My children love it also! We compete against each other!
B00FWLDHSY|4.0|Think Mechwarrior, Gundam Wing and Escaflowne vs. Godzilla/Sea Monsters; Man operated Mechs (which all Men & boys wish they could do) get to fight the bad Monsters. Doesn't get any better than that.<br /><br />I'm not the type to sit there an analyze every plot hole, criticize CGI or worry about if it has any Academy Award winners in the movie. It was entertaining and fun. Simple.<br /><br />Wish there was even more fighting (Thus the 4 star)
B008Y2VTIS|5.0|just catching up on missed seasons and this second season didn't let us down.  Every nuance from the time frame is meticulously crafted. Just a joy to watch despite the over abundance of violence, which is to be expected since it is Prohibition.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|You won't want to put it down and you won't want the story to end. Love those kind of books!!
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Enough said. I never get enough of this show...my only complaint...it should be longer than an hour. Keep em coming
B008YWY0HK|5.0|so wonderful that you can watch over and over so glad to have purchased, I would recommend this to all my family
B004KPLVV8|5.0|I am a big fan of Jeff Bridges and enjoy most of his movies. This one is no exception. It was delivered on time and it plays great.
B001NLKXK2|4.0|A very enlightening novel about coping with early-onset Alzheimer's. Even the title is a clever double entendre. The only reason I'm not giving this book a 5-star rating is that I thought the author was over-reaching by having the heroine be a world-renowned expert in the field of psychology and a Harvard professor; I guess the author wanted to dramatize that a disease such as Alzheimer's can touch anyone -- irregardless of how accomplished or intelligent they might be. It was fascinating tale about family dynamics -- how different family members coped and supported Alice.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I've had this app for over four months now and I love it. It tells me how much battery time I have for reading, surfing, watching videos, etc. Best battery app I've ever had.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|There's some situations and revelations about Dominant/Submissive relationships that I found interesting but the manner in the way it was presented I found to be very boring.  There's a lot of repetition, for example the main character constantly talks about her &#34;inner Goddess&#34;.  The sexual scenes are reductant and I found that by 1/3 of the way through the book the sexsual scenes and dialouge became predictable.  I found it to be written on a very low level in both vocabulary and adult situations.  It was not believable.  I'm in the process of finishing the first book now because I try to finish what I start but I will not be starting on book two.  If you want to read porno - get porno; if you want to read a good story with some spice try someone else, this book is 50 Shades of Boredom.
B00AY7Q01C|4.0|I was glad to hear a story about Rodriquez from a cousin and looked it up and there it was. Thank you, this provides me with info I can use to fill in our family history and tree.
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|All of the actors kill it. DiCaprio is just a great actor. Can someone tell me why he STILL hasn't received an oscar????
B001FA0W5W|3.0|I enjoyed reading this book, but I wouldn't say it is a masterpiece.  The author discusses a variety of the logical traps people tend to fall into when we estimate probabilites in every-day decision making.  Because the writer is an investor, he mostly uses market actors to illustrate his ideas.  As I read, it really came home to me how important the role of chance has been in driving outcomes in my own personal life.<br /><br />  This book is definitely not a \\"must read.\\"  First of all, the guy has a very irritating habit of puffing up his image of himself. He definitely doesn't want you to think he's a shallow, greedy market trader.  For example, he must have mentioned how much he loves literature eight times throughout the book.  The flip side of that is that he's contemptuous of a lot of other people- journalists being a particular hobby horse of his.<br /><br />  Second, and more importantly, his treatment of a wide range of phenomena in the world of probablity seems a bit superficial to me.  I'm a teacher, not a mathemetician, so I can't really tell just how rickety the guy's grasp of the issues might be.  I can tell you that he devotes a whole chapter to undermining the methodology of The Millionaire Next Door.  I've carefully read that book a couple of times now, and, I don't know about the methodology, but I can tell you that this guy completely mischaracterizes its thesis.  I always say that if a writer is way off base with topics I have a handle on, he's probably suspect in  other areas too.  That's especially true in areas where he's not a specialist and that are complex and logically elusive.<br /><br />  Again, this book was  a fun read, more or less, and pulled me into some fun thinking.  Still, I'll bet there are better books for the lay person to read on probablity.  Maybe you could do what I'm doing- go to the library and copy the bibliography, and start there.
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|Downloaded this game two days ago and still very entertained by it. A lot of upgrades are available through gameplay versus in app purchasing (the option is there, of course)
B003TOPQI0|5.0|This movie was a surprise to me because, regardless how 'bloody it is', it is extremely funny with the ineptitude of all the bungling by the various thieves, murders and the like.  I was only sorry that they didn't give the dog (DAGG) &#34;S T A R R billing&#34; with his barking, fighting and running away.  I was surprised that it had come out in 2002 and had never heard of it.  But have now been telling everyone to &#34;get it&#34;, sit down and enjoy it.  The subtitles do not really underscore what the actors are speaking, but do help to understand the Irish Gypsy's dialogue and some of the 'British' terms are.
B00FPH51LQ|5.0|Hilarious and fun.. Watched it with our older children and had a great family movie night! Not too many movies we can all watch together
B002SEQ92E|4.0|Wife and I seen the picture when it first came to the theaters.  The acting and the special effects were great for this time period (1984).  The disc seemed to be a little choppy.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy crush saga is a must have for gamers of all ages. It has enough levels to keep you occupied for years!
B004J4WNL2|5.0|This book helped me to understand myself and my daughter better.  I hope also to consider that my team at work most certainly consists of some introverts and the absolute value they can add if I create the setting that allows them to do so.
B00G8YDVZS|5.0|I love the fact that while this is season five of THE GOOD WIFE, directors and writers have created a whole new direction for the program to go.  While other television series start to fade out at about the fourth or fifth season, THE GOOD WIFE begins their fifth season with bang and the audience is on a wild ride as Alysia, Cary and the rest of the fourth years leave LOCKHART & GARDNER to begin their own firm.  This story-line creates a myriad of new episode possibilities as the two factions begin an all-out war and we have front row seats as the fighting and maneuvering continues to escalate as the season progresses.<br /><br />They have also added a secondary story-line in which Alysia's husband Peter Florrick, the governor elect, joins forces with his wife's new firm, much to the dismay of his right hand man Eli.  Eli realizes that Peter's continuing alliance with the firm could be his downfall and create new controversies as his favoritism may lead him to compromise his gubernatorial ethics.  Exciting and fresh, this season could be the best one yet.<br /><br />UPDATE: This review was more helpful at the time the episode \\"Hit The Fan\\" was shown or before.  At this point in the series other scenarios have take place which make what I have previously stated to not completely follow the way the plot-line has continued.  Please only rate this review with this information in mind.
B000JMKTLO|3.0|Well really didn't care for, not as good as Gone Girl or even Dark Places. Just not my kind of book. Didn't like story,characters, or ending. I wouldn't say don't read because everybody has different tastes but for me no good.
B008Y78QIY|1.0|We like Kevin James, but this is by far the very worst movie we've have ever seen.  It's borders on moronic writing.
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|Predictable ,made for TV last half of the book. The book is hurried up to get to the grand ending .Loved the Shining
B007WEQ3K8|4.0|variety of games to choose from keeps you on your toes and you brain has to do some thinking don't play this if you are tired.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|It is a awesome really fun game. I highly recommend this game for hunting people. The other best part is that it is a free game.
0790729377|5.0|Great acting, directing, writing, cinematography, costumes...the list goes on and on.  For days after seeing it again, I can't get out of my mind why we have no actors to compare to Brando today.  Will we never see his like again?
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Many racing games suffer from poor controls, or you tend to get frustrated and tired of them quickly.  Hill Climb Racing is different in that you don't have to worry about steering but only the gas and the brake.  The game is accordingly easy to learn but harder to master than you might think.  The challenges come is ascending and descending terrains of varying degrees of slope and roughness without flipping your vehicle; increasing distances are required to pass a level.  As distance and difficulty increase, you'll need to customize your vehicle's engine, tires, suspension, and four-wheel drive systems to make the grade, acquiring coin points as you progress to pay for such upgrades.  You'll start out with a little red jeep in the countryside, but as you progress you can buy and open different landscapes and vehicles, each of which has different characteristics.  Vehicles include a motorcycle, monster truck, a bus, and even a tank!  Landscapes include the desert, highway, a cave, and even the moon and alien planets!  By trying different vehicles in different environments, considerable variety is possible, and so the game has high replay value.<br /><br />In-app purchases are possible but neither required nor necessary to advance if you have patience and persistence.  As a free app, this one's a keeper!
B0051XQI84|5.0|This is the 4th or 5th time watching this movie, we were still laughing as hard as the first time we watched it.
B00DL2W7Q4|4.0|If you also value opportunities to challenge your own thinking, the way you tend to look at things, Gladwell's &#34;David & Goliath&#34; is definitely worth a read.<br />Gladwell is again working on the periphery, in the &#34;outer rim&#34;, so no grand universal truths here but excellent stories about how things can also work.<br />The heroes of Gladwell's stories show us the immense power of knowing what you want; and, while in my work as an advisor and coach I operate from the premise that we focus on what's working for us, this a refreshing reminder of the enormous strength of compensation strategies when something important is not working.
B005PK1G76|5.0|Straps on super easy to my Britax b-agile. Love the little zipper pouch to keep a few things tucked in there: chapstick, gum...
B00B2JSRAS|1.0|If you are a true Christian, you won't enjoy this book, nor finish it. God is not &#34; the Universe&#34;. He Created the universe & owns it all. I thought she was just plain obnoxious when it came to this. I can't comment on her energy experiments because I never got that far.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|As always this tv show keeps you on the edge of the seat from beginning to end. I loved it.
B002LC2DQ4|5.0|Because the 1st disc is working great....and I was so glad to be able to find them and purchase them
B0046B3QTG|5.0|Full of laughs and insane humour. What a great movie for adults and kids alike. Definitely a must see! Highly recommended.
006202406X|2.0|Roth definitely rushed the final installment in this series. There were tons of plot holes and none of the characters really stayed true to themselves. Just like everyone else, I was really annoyed when she killed Tris. Not because she killed her but the way that she did it. I had to drag myself to even finish the book after she killed the main character. Overall, it was slow and very different from the first two in the series.
B009ZQJ1G4|5.0|Wowzer! Prozium otherwise known as Prozac and Valium keeping the people from feeling and living their lives to keep them in control
0374203032|5.0|CLSC book....another book with a lot of good info.....excellent read before hearing Michael Sandel speak.  Some of the items really raise your awareness.  good copy
B00723NWJE|5.0|I fell in love with Norah Jones' music the first time I heard her Come Away With Me album.  I listen to her and I think my heart littlerally calms.  It's an album of choice when the world has been too cruel and I need to wash everything away, relax, come back down to feeling good about life.  Little Broken Hearts doesn't quite give me the same feel, but it's almost there.  I could listen to it over and over for hours.
B00CO8D3G4|4.0|every person who wants to leave corporate slavery and is looking for ways to fulfill his dreams must read this book
B00632HWOG|4.0|great-ease of it..with sound notifications.it does help in checking my mail..if you use yahoo , this ones good to get!!!!
B007PVHMCG|2.0|My son liked it but it looks like $5 worth of Lego's.  Just paying for the Minecraft hype and not worth it.
0062255657|4.0|A good book for a quick and engaging read, and if you're new to Neil Gaiman, this is a good start.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Each one is better than the last!  Now I want to see &#34;Into Darkness&#34; again.  Definitely recommend this DVD to others.  Order arrived right on time.
0143124544|5.0|Will Traynor is the Golden Man Adonis, a dynamically successful businessman with a zest for enjoying life to the fullest.  His future is all planned and lined up ahead of him until Lady Luck literally pulls the carpet from under his feet and changes his life forever.<br /><br />Unremarkable Lou Clark is past her mid-20s and stuck in the confines of her small town job at The Buttered Bun and her troubles with endeavouring to scoop up enthusiastic interest in her boyfriend's exercise-obsessed activities whilst she tries to adapt to a crowded parental home in a council house.  The coffee shop closes and financial straits force her to take up a six-month contract working in the Traynor Estate.<br /><br />Hardly a recipe for a dynamic story one is bound to think.<br /><br />These two people's lives now converge, the one in the prison of his own body, the other in the prison of her limited world and life experiences.  Both will give each other a relationship and love that transcends the lust of youthful exuberance and it will sweep you along, it will take over your life, it will make you laugh but be warned finally it will put you through the wringer and leave you, battered and bruised but inspired<br /><br />Someone said reading allowed one to live several lives - I am a long in the tooth, cynical and at times a somewhat cranky dude and love stories are really not my reading genre but this story and these lives are so vividly human and universal that I would have felt robbed by not living it as I was privilege to do.<br /><br />In the right hands what a blockbuster of a movie this is going to make !
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|If you're a Stephen King fan you will like this sequel to The Shining, even if you didn't read the first book.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Works great for a free app. I use it all the time on my kindle fire hd. Perfect for tablet use.
B000B8QG4A|5.0|Was very happy to find this as a birthday present for my daughter.  We have been replacing her videos with the dvd's --  saving space!  Order arrived right on time.
0761169253|4.0|An encouraging look at how to turn ideas into reality.  I read a page or two when I need a refreshing perspective.  Some days it seems I'll never get around to art, and if I do it will be of disappointing quality.  It can only be disappointing if I have an unrealistic idea of what it &#34;should&#34; be, and it will certainly be disappointing if it never gets done!  One of my art teachers once said, &#34;You have to do 100 bad paintings before you do one good one, so get those 100 out of the way as quickly as possible.&#34;  This book helps me start thinking like an artist to see the possibilities and overcome inertia.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It made me think. I love solving puzzles. It wasn't easy. Not hard either. Kinda in between. I would have wished for more levels. I would have liked to see more to start then just 10.
B0012QTT4O|2.0|It's funny to hear all the people who are upset with this being a \\"censored\\" version.  I purposely bought the first season from Amazon for the edited version, unlike Netflix.  This has a TV-14 rating, and still only some of the F-words are bleaped out, not all.  And the sexual scenes are way to graphic to be TV-14.  Call me old fashion but I could do without alot of the \\"details\\" and the show would still be just as good.  Which by the way, I do enjoy the show, I'm just disappointed that only some things seemed to be censored.  I should have just saved my money and watched it on Netflix (since I already pay for it).  For that reason, I don't feel I got what I thought I was paying for (an edited version) and I give it a 2 star rating.
B00127RAJY|5.0|If your looking for something that doesn't take a lot of time, but gives you a SERIOUS workout, this video is for you!!
B006BAEQB2|5.0|I adore this book, I can not wait to start the White Princess. I know some of this is fiction and some fact but this you'd a really wonderful story
B003WE9TU8|5.0|What a fascinating read. So cleverly stitching events together with multinational perspectives and heartfelt reminiscence. I could not put it down.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This is a very challenging game which keeps you on your toes.  I would recommend this game to anyone that likes to play games.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|My son LOVES trains.  While he loves Thomas the Train, any train will do.  This movie was perfect for his interest in trains. We purchased it for him last Christmas, and he watched it over, and over, and over.  It will deff. get a child in the Christmas spirit too!
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|Totally different from the original 2 movies.  The storyline had much more than just rock 'em sock 'em action.  It was great seeing the Captain Justice (or whatever his name was) supplement the Iron Man.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This  calculator  is clear and easy to understand and probably deserves five stars, but  I do  not give five unless truly extraordinary.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I play this game every chance I get. I have nothing bad to stay about this game. 5 star all the way and some!!!!!!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This is a must get game every one will play this game all day like i do an on kindle fire its the best so from me to you..down load it you wont be sorry
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book.  Just as described, it was a book for the beach<br />with interesting characters. The &#34;secret&#34; brings all the people together in some fashion so that you can keep reading without forgetting who's who.<br />Enjoy!
B001BKVWYG|5.0|I saw the documentary/film on Rodriguez and had to get the CD &#34;Cold Fact&#34;. I was not disappointed! The songs are poignant, the lyrics are poetic and the orchestration unique. Rodriquez' vocals are fabulous - every word is clear and easy to understand. Highly recommended.
B00G0KY1UO|5.0|This game is really addicting and I just can't put my kindle down ..... it's worth the 2.99 you won't regret it
B000008LOV|5.0|Too bad they aren't still recording.  I would buy everything CD that they make.  This is truly the cream of the cream (or the top of the top)  Cream was a different group with a different talent...but Traveling Wilburys are the best
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am glad that Amazon finally got candy crush saga.  This game is so addicting that I was afraid that I would have to buy an ipad to play it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally candy crush has come to Kindle Fire!!! So excited I can now play on Kindle!!! Fun and wacky really love playing this all the time. Great fun for everyone.
B00EKQ3YZI|4.0|I'm not exactly sure what people expected? As with any remix project, there's bound to be a few tracks we like, hate, or could care less about. And although I don't love every one of them (some mixes are clearly better than others), this is a fine collection of remixes from some pretty talented guys! The one thing I truly appreciate, is for the most part, Donna's vocals are brought front and center, which is rare on projects of this type.<br /><br />Having said that, there's always a fine line between re-stylizing a song, giving it a fresh perspective, and completely destroying the original integrity of the artist's work. I think the people involved here managed to get it right. Is it perfect, no. Is it worth buying, absolutely!<br /><br />Standouts:<br />01) Love to Love You Baby [Giorgio Moroder f/ Chris Cox Remix] - By far, the best track on the CD. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️<br />03) Hot Stuff [Frankie Knuckles and Eric Kupper as Director's Cut Signature Mix] ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️<br />05) Love Is in Control (Finger on the Trigger) [Chromeo & Oliver Remix] ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️<br />08) Bad Girls [Gigamesh Remix] ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️<br />12) Last Dance [Masters at Work Remix] ⭐️⭐️⭐️
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|This was one of the most beautifully crafted, tenderly researched books I have EVER read. If you have the attention span of a toddler and can only stand 150-page books with high heels on the covers, then GO AWAY and don't bother; the author is a consummate creator of poetic prose and her gift would be wasted on you.  The balance of technical detail, historical reference and emotional human interaction was PERFECT.  If someone had told me \\"oh, its a book about botany and moss,\\" I might have thought \\"no thank you\\" but every page of this book had something to charm, something to stir the heart, something inspiring or funny or compelling.<br />To me, THAT is what makes a book a masterpiece - the ability to exalt mundane events by opening the shutters on the characters' souls to show how those events moved and changed them.  Ms. Gilbert has done this gorgeously. I hope she lives to be a hundred and nine and writes many, many more books!
0805086846|5.0|Daughter missed class and need to watch one of the episodes.  She said it was very interesting.  She learned a lot.
006202406X|3.0|Wow.  If the purpose was to make us cry for days it worked.  As someone who says she struggles with anxiety she should realizes so man suffers read to help with such emotional conditions.  How could you break our hearts like that?  For no reason.  You are writing for teens!  All hope at happiness for Tobias is lost.  And to take life away from Tris after she finally wants it is cruel and tells me: Why bother.  You cannot only write for yourself, when you are this popular you have the responsibility to care about your audience.  Seems like you lost that to make someone else happy.  If you right again, learn from your mistakes and be true to your genre not your paycheck.
B00CO5AQ12|2.0|I LOVE KINETIC SAND! This product is amazing, and I will NOT buy it again...not at this price. The price has skyrocketed since it was first introduced and now, it's just not worth it. It's a very small box of sand for $40....DO NOT BUY THIS until the price drops.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|love this game.<br />we play together as a family and make Competions. recommend to all. helps pass the time quick.
B0010TBPJU|5.0|The music, the story, the comedy .... Very original and engaging!<br />It's jus tone of those movies you have to own and watch form time to time,
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|I love Malcolm Gladwell and anything he writes. This is a great source for the underdogs of the world. A must read!
B00AJCTY8S|5.0|Age defying music, these young men are loved by us 60 somethings all the way down to tweeners on both sides of the pond. I actually got to spend a day and a half with the Kodaline guys in my home town last May while they were staying at my Resort on a tour layover. They were very down to earth and friendly and were a gas to hang around with. I have been listening to their LP for several months and it keeps growing on me, not a bad cut in the bunch. The cut &#34;Way Back When&#34; really surprised me it should be sang in every Pub on Gods green earth at closing time. A sweet nostalgic tune about days gone by and good friendships with a warm group vocal crescendo ending for a that &#34;all together now&#34; arms around each other ending. The song has the same feeling Paul McCartney captured on his great song &#34;Mull Of Kintyre&#34;.
B00F8MI9NK|5.0|This was such an adorable movie. I can't believe a sequel was much better then an original. It's also a great movie fit kids my 1 year old niece loved it from being to end.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Say what you will about the writing,  I found the words leaping off the pages and into my memory . I mwant more, please master.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I like candy crush a lot. The chocolates are very challenging. Don't really like the time bombs. Can use some improvements.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|When reading about this story, the main characters name is Adam and he is the kind of man everyone wants in their life. From a team player in high school to becoming a father for two charming children, Adam seemed to always push for the best. Good was never good enough for Adam and his story is truly inspiring!
B002RI9ZPY|3.0|A much longer read than the previous two books in the series. It is an impressive forensic description of the exposure of a major conspiracy and it perfectly links back to events in the first two books. It is a very original creation.<br /><br />Five stars
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I loved minion rush the only problem is it was so slow moving forward and make a new choice after the resident
B004LPLU4K|5.0|Loves it my kids are 6 and 8 and they really enjoyed it. It lets their imaginations roll, they are still talking about the movie
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is a brain teaser! I absolutely love it! It's great for everyone! I wish they would add more levels though.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have really enjoyed every moment of all three seasons.  Very interesting to learn about the difference in the classes during that time in history.  I am looking forward to season 4.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great period piece.  Funny and engaging.  Good characters, good drama and a storyline that moves along quickly. Glad it is on instant video, because I don't have to miss any episodes.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is the best game every.  I play this game every day.  It is fun to see where your family and friend are and if you can beat their scores.
B00DGNO3WE|1.0|Dustin Hoffman is a much better actor than director  This movie moves so slowly that ....we didn't bother to watch the last 30 minutes.  Don't bother with this one.  Good actors are only as good as the writing and directing.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|love this app. try it out and you will too.  lots of options to listen to. can't beat it for free.
B0063M22QO|3.0|You cannot undo a move and that is unusual and annoying. The tiles are nice although the sounds do not have the variety I normally like in a Mahjong match game.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Just bought it this morning and my 6 year old is in love with this game already. I sat with him and watched him play and couldn't resist helping out a bit (which made him mad). Now I wish I could play it on my laptop!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love playing this game!  Its a great way to unwind at the end of the day when I need to relax!
1607066017|5.0|One of the best graphic novels of the last decade. Vaughn continues his brilliant writing with this new series to tell an engrossing story with great characters. The art work is among the best I have seen. This is a must read for any comic book fan.
B004UID2LC|2.0|Wish there was a way you can add your own subscriptions rather than searching for the same channels over an over again.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|I  like it  for I am disabled  harder to get out to store  It has done well with me  instead of needing to try  to ourchase somewhere else
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Even though there are only 10 levels, the game is free and is really tough for me after the 2nd level. Love tough games.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally!!  So glad my favorite game is now available to play on my Kindle.  I had to charge up the battery because I had stopped using it for awhile.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|After hearing everyone ranting how great this game is, I had to give it a try and I have to say that I am quite having a good time with it.  Glad I gave it a try!
B00EDK1LP6|5.0|Love this music.  Every time I hear it, it takes me back to the story, which I loved.  I initially looked at the album to buy only the song that played during closing credits, but the instrumentals throughout the moving are phenomenal!  I'm so glad I got the whole album.  The music tells the story perfectly!
B005HEY28A|5.0|This is a super fun show, This season really wraps up the characters nicely. It's been a lot of fun getting to know them.
B007SGM084|5.0|Love it wanted to read for months now i finally got a chance glad i did really like it great book
B003B02OOG|5.0|I sincerely give these stories the top rating because the author was able to make me feel as a participant and I laughed and raged along with the characters. I recommend these books to those of you that like to become engrossed in stories.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|As a fan of The Shining, I was looking forward to this sequel and was not disappointed.  This novel ties in well with the original while introducing new ideas and characters to keep things interesting.  I am sometimes dissappointed with King's endings as they feel less thought-out than the rest of the story.  This story however moves at a good pace and the ending is satisfying.
B00AZNEW5G|3.0|I was very disappointed in the film. The production was good but nearly all the heroes were women. The combat Male fighters were portrayed almost as ancillary to the heroics of the women. Frankly, the film came off as a Politically Correct version of the events that took place in the search for Bin Laden.
B00E8B1358|3.0|Action was great, the Rock is always good but the story lacked scope.  Most action movies are not story intense but it could have used something to keep me more interested.
B00EJU8ZIG|5.0|Having a more experimental vibe to this vast and deep CD, Lorde delivers with every song she does. There are no filler tracks. There is only bliss and good vibes.<br /><br />Don't even think twice about getting it; just do it.
B007SGM084|5.0|Great character development ,interesting story line continues through all 3 of this trilogy.<br />Although some sex scenes a bit shocking they are relate well in the story line.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Just read it. Despite it's faddish reputation, it really is good. RIP Stieg Larsson. The last good book before TWILIGHT and all that crap hit.
B005USZYDU|3.0|I have been trying to read all John Grisham's books, and I have finished the series on the Kid Lawyer.<br />It was as short adventure from boredom and disappointing to me.  I look forward to his next novel.
B0091WNK8M|5.0|Who doesn't like this movie? I've watched it at least 40 times. Best movie ever. Every time I watch it I laugh and laugh
B005USZML4|3.0|I have jumped into the Theodore Boone books in the absence of anything else to read from John Grisham.<br />They are proving rather elementary and predictable.  Hardly reaching the higher standard of his other books.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Fun simcity type game, but wants to run your facebook account for you. If you give in the bribes with in game currency aren't bad. Pretty fun otherwise.
B0074VTHKM|3.0|I continue reading anything that John Grisham writes, but this youth series isn't nearly as interesting as his other novels.
B00942G4UA|5.0|Eye opening and sad to think this is happening in our own backyard. This film is engageging & not as graffic as I expected (a good thing!). Buy organic
B000PFU7OO|5.0|The music from this show is mesmerizing and addictive.  The entire CD is terrific.  All of the songs are great!
0345803485|5.0|Haven't had a chance to read it yet. I hear really good things about it.  Purchased it for a friend with borrow it when he is done.
B00DYFCYSO|5.0|This CD has a great sound and some wonderful tracks.  I enjoyed it from beginning to end!  I will listen to it often.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Although the ending was a complete shock for myself and definitely an emotional one, this book deserves those five stars. It doesn't disappoint in the excitement and the emotions. I got close to these characters and Veronica Roth has become a new favorite author,  I cannot wait to see what else she will write. I recommend all three books without hesistation, if you're a hunger games fan this is a series you don't want to miss.
B001CTGQBK|5.0|I have seen this movie at least15 times and I would watch it another 15 times. Great movie for all generations.
B004XZR63M|5.0|Great book. Definitely has changed the way I look at life. Teaches you that financial education is the most important ingredient in order to be successful
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pinteredt on my kindle very easy to use. I am very halt with the app. I love it.
1451695195|5.0|I am still reading the book.  However, while I believe Dr. Alexander's experiences, the &#34;OM&#34; experience says it all for me.  I studied a bit of Hinduism and since then I have believed that all there is is OM.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|as usual an excellent season with the brothers and the rest of the cast, at a very good price too if your patient enough.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|the violence was fantastic, the story wasn't. the acting wasn't awe inspiring but it definitely was good enough to never get in the way of enjoying the movie. it had its own personality which was probably the most impressive thing about it. if you are stuck in your hotel room and it is between this and some movie about an indian boy stuck at sea in a boat with a tiger, choose Dredd.
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|This is a great book, it gives kids an insight into the life and feelings of a person with facial deformities.
B009V0TV6O|1.0|like many others, I got the free version with ads, not the paid version. Not sure if this is the developer messing with Amazon or Amazon messing with us, but it is incredibly disturbing.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|The title of this book is an attention grabber.  I couldn't wait to find out about the husband's secret.  Moriarty is skilled in character development, creating characters the reader wants to know about and eventually come to identify with.  Her writing is sharp.  I will be reading more of her work.
B00338QENI|4.0|Don't usually like non fiction but this book was very interesting and really gave insight into the Life of Henrietta Lacks, and that of her family and their struggles with this issue...
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game will cost you your job. You will love it. It is a cuter bejewelled. Fun for all ages.
B00BUAEYVK|5.0|My son and I spend summer long seeing movies and we miss the opportunity to see when was release...since Ive waiting for the proper time to purchase it....many thanks for your prompt delivery excellent condition...
B0034KDNES|5.0|This shows Hiromi beautiful style and ability! She is an amazing pianist. Wish I could see her play because she is so expressive. Great Jazz!
B000ZJTPLG|2.0|If you are desperate to have a quiet guitar and can't afford a 1 watt amp, this is a good substitute.  It sounds about the same through cheap or expensive headphones, which is to say it sort of sounds like a guitar.  The highest headphone volume isn't all that loud, so you won't lose any hearing with this unit, although I still like my music loud, even through headphones.....so it's sort of a disappointment.  The knobs are small and hard to read, so memorize what does what.  It isn't difficult as there are only three of them you need to bother with, but they are small and virtually impossible to see while playing.  I usually plug in an MP3 player with some backing tracks on it, and play over them. The battery is easy to change but doesn't last all that long.  These little units have their place, just don't expect too much. I paid about $30 for mine so I guess I shouldn't expect too much.<br /><br />Waddie
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun game like it a lot. It's lots of fun to play with my cat. Hope you like this review.

B008JFUPK8|1.0|Ok, I was enjoying this movie until the action scenes started...  HALF of this movie is Superman being thrown through buildings.  Can we get a count?  Seriously, I understand you guys were proud of the special effects and stuff, but 45 minutes of watching superman get hip tossed through buildings gets a little old.  So yeah this movie starts out good, than tries to get too over the top with the action and it ruins the whole thing.  I think at some point I went out for some popcorn to return to Superman being hucked through the 115th building of the day...  at that point you get 1 star.  I could have made a better movie.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Game can be addictive, but will make you spend your paycheck! Just as you get into it, you have run out of time and lives!

B006H4DBA4|3.0|Simple, easy read, very short but rather unmemorable - not the normal level of Kinsella humour so all in all rather dissapointing
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game highly recommended for any age group. My kids love it. Need to make more like this one maybe more holiday characters in
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Ok.... I like subway surfers but it is starting to get boring but you should get it but it will start to get boring

B00G32OER4|4.0|Perfect Halloween movie... lots of scary moments throughout. This is one of those the-less-you-really-see-the-better kind of movies. Scary stuff is always that much more frightening when it's in your imagination. There is plenty to see though and this is one creepy movie. Cant believe it's actually real, but apparently it is.
B005SZEFH6|4.0|A very interesting book to read, like understanding Bruce Lee's soul. Sometimes naive, sometimes deep, a good teaching, an enjoyable read.
B0023SDPS6|1.0|i didn't care for the story. i thought it would be like the tv show but it isn't. longmire doesn't seem like the same person.
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|This book includes some wonderful and little-known tidbits of history, bundled into an engaging narrative. This is how people should get their history. 1927 comes alive here, revealing the roots of many of America's successes  and failures to come.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Really enjoyed a physician's prescriptive.  I too, am a health care worker, but no longer do direct patient care. I have seen and heard patients who die peacefully knowing they are moving on to a much better place and have seen patients struggle in their last hours as they are fearful of what comes next. I believe without a doubt that heaven does exist and have no fear of death. Proof of Heaven reinforces my belief.

1579655327|1.0|It's rare that a cookbook would evoke such vitriol, but after I received The Kinfolk Table: Recipes for Small Gatherings, I was livid. I realized that this wasn't a celebration of food and gathering and the magic those two ignite, this was the sound of one hand clapping, a coffee-table book devoted to the very \\"cool\\" artists and Web celebrities from across the country. The narrative principally centers on the people, not the food, which would be fine if that were the intention. Without a clear narrative and culinary journey, we're left to merely weave in and out of kitchens like a spool of thread, but we're not invited to linger. Rarely do we see the fruits of the contributors' labor and the gatherings they so fastidiously rhapsodize. The Kinfolkers drive miles for mussels and set a formidable table in their outdoor barns. Theirs is a life of a cultivated beauty that serves up the illusion of simplicity. In reality, the Tao of Kinfolk is nothing more than understated affluence and luxury. Theirs are gatherings where meals are photographed with a thousand-dollar camera; where everyone has clean skin, shiny hair, and ebullient optimism; where kids play around the paddock. Theirs is a world that exists for few.<br /><br />There is no real visceral connection between image and type. Rather, the cookbook tells us the story of people who project the lives you wish you could live, and the recipes are merely an antecedent to that lovely fiction.<br /><br />More troubling was the editorial decision to segment the book by \\"place.\\" The Kinfolk Brooklyn is whitewashed and moneyed, devoid of flavor, color, or texture. Where is the Russian food? Where is the Caribbean food? Dominican, Italian, Polish, etc.? Having grown up in a borough so rich in gastronomic culture, I remember those diverse meals when you talk to me about Brooklyn food. I don't recall precious dishes made by transplants to the better known and more affluent areas of the borough (Park Slope, Williamsburg, Cobble Hill, and so on), who have a noticeably homogenous look and culinary point of view.<br /><br />So much for the Kinfolk founder's claim that his cookbook will \\"peel off the fluff and commercial layers that complicate entertaining,\\" and if that passion can't be seen in the pages' austere white dining rooms, it certainly won't be found in the book's recipes. The cooking instructions are as carelessly delivered as those anesthetized settings are carefully crafted. Because, like those spaces, the composition of the recipes is cold, formulaic, sometimes off; it hardly connects the meal to the person to the story to the gathering that celebrates it all. What is it, then, that we're celebrating? A life lived in organic sepia? A life lived through the lens of those who photograph it?<br /><br />While you could argue that, perhaps, I'm not part of Kinfolk's target audience, I'm indeed part of the audience for homemade food that has the ability to connect loved ones. Yet, as executing a handful of dishes proves, the book has some demonstrable flaws where procedure and chemistry are concerned. Many recipes miss key steps in their methods, or offer ingredients that yield imbalanced flavors and textures. If I'm not a trained baker or a chemist and can recognize the flaws simply by reading the recipes, what of the reader who wants only to fix a good meal?<br /><br />I made Sam and Ashley Owens's Apple Crisp twice following the recipe to the letter, and both times the crisp failed. Know that I've been making pies, crisps, and crumbles for the better part of a decade, and the recipe is flawed from top to bottom--the technique, texture, and flavors are off. The juice of two lemons, tart apples, and a quarter cup of sugar yielded a pronounced citrus note that overpowered the apples and cinnamon. The topping was entirely too sweet, sickeningly so, relative to the amount of flour in the recipe, so, on the third go, I was forced to make significant alterations. Additionally, covering thecrisp with parchment and wax, as instructed, only added to the cooking time and didn't do anything in terms of the final product. I could have easily done without it and enjoyed a simple crisp. However, since Sam and Ashley's crisp was tented, I had to increase the cooking time to achieve a brown crust, which inevitably yielded a center with the consistency of applesauce. Although the two can carry a tune and drape a dress--he's a musician; she, a designer--I strongly question their culinary prowess.<br /><br />You can't know how close I came to hurling this book out the window. I'd spent a pile of money on butter, flour, apples and sugar only to witness a recipe fail.<br /><br />It should be noted that Doug and Paige Bischoff's Rosemary and Roasted Garlic Bread was a triumph. Roasting the garlic for an hour resulted in a sweeter, less pungent flavor that married perfectly with the fresh rosemary. While bread making isn't entirely difficult, it's time-consuming, and one has to be vigilant in upholding the integrity of the method: kneading and allowing the dough to rest and rise. A few critical steps were missing from this recipe, namely, the timing of kneading by hand versus by mixer. At the onset, we're given two sets of instructions for the initial, critical kneading--one for a machine application and the other for a by-hand approach. However, the subsequent instructions for the next two dough kneadings were vague. In theory, the directions that follow are supposed to be synched to the stand-mixer timing; in practice, that wasn't the case--a small point, certainly, but one that can adversely affect the end product, rendering a tough, dense loaf.<br /><br />Luckily, I've screwed up so many bread loaves in the past five years that I've become hyperaware of the sensitivity in making bread.<br /><br />I first encountered blogger and event planner Lillie Auld's Almond Jam Tart in Kinfolk's autumn issue, and I was perplexed by the erroneous cup-to-grams conversion for white flour--both the overestimated amount of flour called for (in order to make this recipe sing, I eliminated a half of a cup in the final version), and the mysterious elimination of the step in the recipe in which one would incorporate the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients. Are we left to fend for ourselves and assume the obvious? And obvious to whom? (Only to those who frequently bake, OBVIOUSLY.) Or was the recipe developer asleep at the proverbial switch?<br /><br />My modified end result was a simple, buttery tart with a perfect crumb texture.<br /><br />Sara and Hugh Forte's (of Sprouted Kitchen fame) Chocolate Chip Banana Pancakes were a standout, impeccable in terms of the juxtaposition of flavor and spice (can we talk about flax meal, vanilla, banana, and chocolate for a second? Or maybe an HOUR?), and simple in execution. I made these semi-virtuous hotcakes this morning and they were wonderfully fragrant and a true delight. Admittedly, I felt confident in Sara's work, as I'm a longtime reader of her lovely blog and have made many recipes from her cookbook.<br /><br />All of this raises a question: Were the recipes in this cookbook tested in a real kitchen so we, as consumers, may be certain the chemistry is on point? Was the cookbook proofed by professionals (of the editorial and culinary varieties)? After thumbing through three-hundred-plus pages, it occurs to me that the Kinfolk cookbook is a variation on a single theme: the creation of a life lived in an Anthropologie catalog. It's the reason why we get lost in blogs and the lives of strangers. We want to be happy, always. We want a life free of storms and sorrow. We want our linens, and bowls, and kitchens with reclaimed wood -- and in this way, Kinfolk succeeds, for its America is rarefied and specific, rife with denizens who are preened to dishabille perfection and apply pretty filters to their photos. I recall a similar charade: GOOP. While escapism looks lovely on paper, in practice it's difficult and expensive.

031603441X|5.0|You could read \\"Life\\" looking for a chronological survey of the Stones or Keith Richards. Maybe you're looking for some insight into how the rich-and-famous fast crowd lives life. Perhaps you just know \\"Keef\\" as the original bad boy of rock 'n roll and are looking for some vicarious cheap thrills. It seems like a lot of the armchair Amazon review crowd was doing just that, but that is not what this book is about. This is really a stream-of-consciousness tale about how a visionary musical genius changed the culture of the world.<br /><br />Just read some of how Richards describes music...it's a spiritual thing to him. To feel about some trade the way Keith feels about his guitar playing, with such passion, it's a special thing with which he gives such openly honest insight. It quickly becomes clear why the Stones were able to so powerfully influence audiences around the world: they were musicians first, all the rest was secondary. There is something big to take away here, Keith makes sure you do.<br /><br />Richards starts the book first with his childhood but quickly transitions into the buttoned-up world of the pre-sexual revolution 1960s. I love the feedback loops he describes in first third of the book as the Stones were becoming a household name: these Brits were reintroducing mainstream white American culture to the rich, black blues music of Chicago, which helped open the doors for Motown's great artists to leave their own mark on pop culture. It's a beautiful thing - all the interplay between the US, UK, White America, Black America; it's almost a foreshadow of the civil rights movement that would follow.<br /><br />No doubt, there are a ton of crazy stories and characters mixed into all these bigger points he's making, which are both fun and dubiously believable at times. I know this is an autobiography, which can tend to be a bit rose-tinted, but the way Richards so openly talks about things that others would sweep under the rug (a failed marriage, band discord, life as a junkie), you take him at this word about the other things in the book. He earns your trust as a reader quickly.<br /><br />I'm not going to say this is an easy read without its faults. Richards is writing off the top of his head and you'll be lost frequently - a great number of his stories and the people he introduces in the book are haphazard and incomplete, but it almost seems better this way. It reflects the man telling the story as much as anything. And the back quarter of the book gets pretty weak - I really don't care about Keith Richards bangers-and-mash recipe anymore than I would care about Julia Child's guitar playing hobby - but its all honest, even if questionably enjoyable at parts.<br /><br />But when this book is good, it's better than any autobiography I've read.

0345535421|5.0|Watching the series \\"Game of Thrones\\" on tv and then to read this book that I ordered off of Amazon.com, just puts the icing on the cake.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I was unsure if in was going to enjoy this book after finishing a series I couldn't get enough of just before I started this book.  I spent a few nights reading for hours when I could have been sleeping and even up til the very last word I was engulfed by this story.  If you loved the hopeless series (the series in which I could not get enough of) you'll also love this book.  Can't wait to read the rest of this series and lose more sleep because that's how much I enjoyed reading about these characters.
0553386794|5.0|Again, another great book from this series from Amazon.Com. I watch this series on tv and to be able to read the books is a way to not miss anything and to clarify areas that made you wonder when watching the series on tv.

Once you tap on everything a few times and figure out what to do to escape a room , you are then good to go...if you've ever played a game of this type, then you all ready know what the deal is... if not it is easy enough to catch on...just give it a chance...I'm sure it gets tougher as you advance through the levels, but with a little thought I'm sure we can all clear this one.

B000066C6F|5.0|This movie deserves a high rating because it exposes the the real life of confidentially when the media had real gus not to reveal news worthy information.  It also exposes women in the 80's and now who are obsessed with their bodies and the desire to be as perfect and as  thin as possible even when they are at a healthly weight.  Beauty is still on the inside.

One of the few acts that didn't conform to having a bunch of rappers on their tracks, they stuck to what works for them and they made it work.  This cd is why I continue to marvel at this band.  They know how to put it down and make the music last.  Even the remixes of past hits CAN'T HIDE LOVE and SHINNING STAR was worth the purchase.  With Maurice White gone, they still refer to him when recording, so they are loyal to a fault.  Continue to be who you are and you will ALWAYS have a fan base.  GO FELLAS!!!!

B006LSZECO|5.0|This was a book that hooked you right from the beginning being a spin on the he-said, she-said format. The author made the reader want to get to the bottom of the mystery but kept twists and turns coming. The text was well written and the dictionary feature of the Kindle App was helpful.
B006GECE9Y|5.0|I had downloaded this due to all the feedback stating it was needed over the Installed browser on the Kindle Fire HD.  Sorry Amazon but it's true.  The Silk Browser is a battle to use.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I did enjoy the story as if followed the lives of 3 separate women whose lives become some what intertwined. I do have to say it jumped back and forth a lot between the stories, but once you got into that writing style it was fine.
B007N8RULO|5.0|I have enjoyed Spider Solitaire for a long time and am glad it was available to download on my Kindle.  Now I can play it anywhere I go.  It is a fun and challenging game.  I definitely would recommend this game.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Picked the book off of a whim and I was extremely impressed. Well written, good pace, supremely interesting story. Good job to the author and I would definitely recommend this book.
B00004THAY|5.0|I had this CD before, but it got cracked, so I had to purchase it again.  I really like this CD and I knew I had to replace it because I need to hear it every so often.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so glad that they brought the app to the Kindle!  This is the most addictive and frustrating game but I love it.  It is a pay for in game extras game but I have yet to put any money in to get through the levels.  I really don’t think you have to put any money in as long as you have enough patience, skill and a little luck.
B000FA675C|3.0|Good book. Not my usual read, but was a nice change of pace. Very entertaining book with different points of view.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|Just another money scam...free download, but then buy this, pay for that...I'm over it..so are many of my friends. But I'm sure there are many in line behind me, both to sign up and to leave
B00G32OER4|4.0|maybe because i zero expectations of this being any good it snuck up on me but I was thoroughly entertained by a movie full of BS supernatural mumbo jumbo about two charlatans that peddle nonsense, bunk and hokum to the cretins among us.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I really like Duolingo.  I have learned more words than with any other program I have tried.  Sometimes it is difficult to understand a word being said.
B00BXKOMT6|3.0|Good reading although I found the beginning of the book slow going. The pace picked up and was enjoyable reading.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|Hope to play more like it. Wished it would have been a little longer. I enjoyed this game. Not to hard. Good story.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Overall this is a good read. At times I felt it journeyed to far off the main road but that is a debatable based on readers preference. I enjoyed an  recommended for all ages.
B00FPGSPQU|3.0|If I had not seen Part I and II, Part III would have been more enjoyable to me.  However, I did see I and II, and III did not make the grade.
B00ESNE696|5.0|Marguiles is one hot actress. She is sultry, smart, level-headed and believable. Congrats to the casting manager, without her, the show will lack the smolder affect.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I really like this game, but after level 35 you have to make a purchase to keep playing which is the reason for the 4 stars.  If it's a FREE app then it should be FREE.
B0011NVC98|1.0|If you enjoy good cinema or have a respect for classic literature, do not watch this.  it was ridiculous and butchered the original story while neglecting the most important aspects of it.
B003WE9TU8|2.0|I DID like the concept of the existence and proliferation of the Z people.<br />I didn't enjoy the author's method of relating the story.<br />For me it (the method) got in the way of continuity.<br />I persisted to the end and am sorry I did.<br />So many better books to read.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Great for puzzle lovers of all ages. My daughter and I just loved doing it together. And with 35 pieces it was relatively easy.
B001U3Y5XE|3.0|Kids weren't too thrilled with game. They ended up getting legos all mixed into theirs so not sure we have it all together now.
B007NU54H4|5.0|Giving this to my 3 year old for Christmas. This movie is our favorite out of the tinkerbell movies. It is way cute!
B00D9RQO56|5.0|I will just mention that I saw it when it was originally released in the movie theaters and have been a fan ever since. If you think the best movies are the ones that show you a world you've never envisioned before, then you will LOVE Tim Burton's &#34;The Nightmare Before Christmas&#34;. The plot revolves around Jack, the Pumpkin King of Halloween, and his attempt to run Christmas in place of Santa Claus.This DVD is one that you can spend HOURS exploring happily! Highly recommended as both a Halloween and Christmas treat. We can watch this movie on repeat!!! Some say its a little dark for young children but my daughter has watched since she was born (now 12) and she absolutely loves it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This series was a lot more than what I had expected. I liked the fact that there was mystery and excitment.
B00A8KJK7G|5.0|Tim Burton is responsible for some of the most amazing films in history. His blend of spookiness and heart has given us some of the most amazing stories and memorable characters.It is the simple story of a friendship between a boy and his dog and how far you would be willing to go to keep someone close to you for the rest of your life. The story is so heartfelt and everything in this film makes it so wonderful
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I absolutely love the characters in this series and everything about this interesting and enchanting time period.  The last episode in this season is a little disappointing, but I'm sure that Season 4 will rebound.  I can't wait to see Season 4 and I'm so glad I purchased this season on Amazon prime so I can watch it again and again!
B001XUH69Y|4.0|Casablaca is &#34;redone&#34; for this presentation on Kindle.  Results are clear, concise video and audio; easy watched;  a classic movie.  Highly recommend.  donnybarker
B003WUYP56|5.0|I am a PhD in psychology so I am probably a little biased but I think Lee Smolin has fulfilled the most important role of bringing the story of science to the general reader.  Smolin's treatment of the nature of science and models in science are the best I've every read.  He does his best to make clear very abstract topics is physics and cosmology and for the most part has succeeded in my opinion.  It's best to read this book without stumbling over sections that simply require some science/physics training, just keep reading as I did and Smolin will let you get the overall picture and this picture will be very rewarding to everyone who makes the effort.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|This is a terrific movie with a lot of action and you tend to laugh a lot. I have watched Red about 5 times and can always watch it again. I'm so glad they made a Red 2 and hopefully they will make a Red 3. What good entertainment!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|If you don't want to turn on your pc to see netflix or youtube, this is clearly what you're looking for
B00AZM7IQC|4.0|This is such a good DVD and entertainment for the whole family. We have watched it several times and always enjoy it. Thumbs up!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Occasional problems where earned prizes and coins do not appear in the relevant areas.  Example: I earned the Ferris wheel, but it didn't appear in the puzzle area, and no coins were credited in the &quot;available coins&quot; box - the top left corner of the screen.<br />The game can occasionally &quot;freeze,&quot; and the screen is blocked, when a prize is credited in the &quot;bonus&quot; areas, and a tier has been unlocked.  This can be annoying, when one is working on trying to move coins, while the coin walls are up. The coins do not move into the playing area, and/or the dozer might not move, while the announcement is up.<br />Otherwise, game is addictive and challenging.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Its pretty cool but the only thing is there is always a boss in each level<br />But when its not hard just move your guy
006202406X|1.0|I really regret reading this book, especially the last third. I think the ending was completely unnecessary. Instead of leaving readers with a sense of hope, it leaves you depressed. If I wanted to hear a depressing story with a horrible ending, I would just turn on the news. Books are a place to escape, where dreams come true. Especially this genre of books. Instead, it ruined the series for me. I won't be re-reading this series, or watching any of the movies.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This is a great app for kids 9 and under. I know a lot of kids that have this app and you should git it too.
B00BAXFCPO|4.0|I am not done reading this book yet. So far, from what i have read, i have learned a lot from it. A friend of mine was the one who recommended me into this book.She said that it definately would  help me with my epilepsy condition. i have not started taking this beneficial diet seriously as my boyfriend is a vegan.. I might consider it in the near future to come.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I have wanted to read this book for a very long time after hearing about. When I finally got the chance to, I jumped on it. Now, reading this was for a school assignment, and I loathe the assignment and because it is almost two in the morning, I figured I would finish the book another time and turn the assignment in late. But when I started reading, I got hooked. And now that I have finished the book, I figured why not just do the project. This is an amazing story and it changed me in a way that I don't know how yet, but it did change me.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|The series was great but i hate the ending to be honest..........ending a series by killing one of the main characters not cool man.....why does everyone close to Christina die??? I dunno
B008JFUR10|1.0|Ultraviolet is a horrendous DRM solution that is very anti-consumer.  The movie itself is fantastic, but this version of the movie is a complete and utter ripoff.  Get the standard bluray version if you can find it and avoid buying anything with the Ultraviolet name written on the packaging.
B00G32OER4|5.0|Was a great film! Finally a good horror movie better than insidious. This is one movie I will actually buy!
B00ARHAAZ6|3.0|A fun read, but the characters and plot felt rushed and half imagined. Not Brandon's best work. I just kept having the thought...if only he'd worked on this draft for another six months. That said, it was still an engaging read. A lot of potential here but it may be awhile before we see the sequel. He's got a lot of series already committed too and a lot of publishing deadlines. Your a great author Mr. Sanderson, but try not to extend yourself too much. Give every novel the time it needs to fully develop. Your fans will wait if the quality can match or exceed your previous titles.
B0030DBGXY|5.0|What an amazing knife!!<br />Looks great, mean as hell, San Mai III steel, nice'n hefty, super sharp, comfortable  -  what's not to like!<br /><br />If you've seen my review of the Benchmade Nimravus, you won't find this knife on my list of the top 5. That's because I didn't have this knife yet.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was the heft and thickness of the spear-point blade (a measured .200\\"). That's a mere .050\\" away from a quarter inch. The second thing I noticed was the comfy Kraton grip, which fits my hand like I wish all knives would. My thumb finds the thick spine a quite natural resting place.<br /><br />Aside from the Nimravus, this is the sharpest knife I've ever held out-of-the-box. It passed the paper/cardboard test with laughable ease, and makes short work out of blister packs, fiberboard, plastic soda bottles, seat belts, and fire hose. The top edge of the spear point is also very sharp. It will certainly be an asset in the woods, or in your camp or bug-out bag. I highly recommend it for campers and preppers. I'd use it for EDC, but it's an inch too long for legal carry here.<br /><br />THE SHEATH  -<br />I've seen reviews here, criticizing the sheath for being too tight or too loose. Mine is on the tight side, which is perfect for me. Perhaps there's a wide bell curve of manufacturing tolerances at the factory, and I happened to get one close to the middle. TIP  -  if your sheath is tight, pushing against its forward edge with your thumb will pop it out with ease.<br /><br />The retention strap is a little awkward though  -  it's designed to snap on-center, which makes UNsnapping a bit clumsy. It also interferes slightly with \\"re-holstering\\". The sheath is adjustable for \\"ride-height\\"  -  an interesting feature. It will also tac-tie horizontally to a MOLLE vest.<br /><br />In the woods, this knife is a pleasure to use. It whacks and carves through branches like a bolo, and the spear point will pick up a four-foot heavy branch from the ground with a light jab.<br /><br />If you're a camper or a prepper, I highly recommend this knife.<br /><br />5 stars.<br />.ith a light jab.<br /><br />If you're a camper or a prepper, I highly recommend this knife.<br /><br />5 stars.<br />.
B008EL25LE|5.0|Awesome game totally addictive, couldn't put it down its challenging and you want to come back every time, i love it.

B007VDN1PA|3.0|This only gets three stars. Why? The plastic insert that you put into the unit tends to scratch with 35 mm film running through it. pretty lousy that it scratches so much becuase everything else is pretty good.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|Very good story; had a hard time putting the BOOK down, feel sorry for Gray. He really had a messed up life.can't wait to see what happens to him. Him and Ana seem like they Belong together. I hope it works out for them
B009ZZDNT6|2.0|I dare anyone who has a hardtime waking up to actually wake up with this app. But a dead corpse would wake up faster than me in the mornings so maybe you should try it. Who knows, maybe it's ideal for a light sleeper.
B00B22ASUM|5.0|I started reading this while loitering in a store waiting for some friends.  One noticed and gifted it to me as a birthday present.  It's a short read based on a short moment in time of this man's life and how Bob changed it.  It's heartwarming with it's ups and downs.  If you want philosophy, this isn't it but if you want to feel good about animals and people, then go for it.
B00ECR7L0Y|5.0|It's funny that reviews of this film are either enthusiastic or disappointed, with nothing in between.  Consider me in the first category.  This Much Ado is bright, effortless and entertaining.  The cast is absolutely first-rate and the setting is beautiful.  Rather than call too much attention to the modern-day setting, Whedon just films it in black and white to give it glamour and style.  If anyone is Shakespeare-phobic, this is the movie I'd show them to convert them.  All in all, a delightful adaptation.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Using chrome you can easily pass over your tv just about anything. The only thing is that is a bit slow. i have Wireless N at home, maybe using a new technology, might be faster and my concern would be none. But asides that, its great. beats having a Apple TV that costs 3 times more. Btw, you can stream anything in your desktop (beta)
B000HF6XPY|5.0|I watched this movie many years ago and fell in love with it.  My 13 year old saw it on TV once and liked it very much.  So I decided to buy it for her for Christmas as a stocking sutffer.
B005LAIIMG|5.0|This was a fantastic movie and I can not wait for the sequels to come out, I just hope that Brad Pitt continues in the lead role !!
B000IDEORY|5.0|When my daughter watched this movie for the first time she fell in love with it so I decided to buy it for her.
B00BB67UNW|4.0|I loved the story, but they could have made the ending better or went as far as to complete what happened to the lead characters instead of ending it the way they did
B0096HFOZO|2.0|This is certainly not one of my favorite Roald Dahl books. And anyone who absolutely, positively, marvelously can't get enough of this book is crazy. The actual purpose of the book is a ?. To act like nerds all your life? That's certainly not what I would like to do. Honestly, the whole purpose of this book is to be funny. So not laughing.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|It is a really amazing game.I usually lose interest in gameloft games after a week or so but this game is addicting.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game has kept me from housework, laundry, cooking and I'm not even sorry. I Love this game. I should have started a long time ago. The house, kids, clothes can wait. LOL
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|This game is full of action! It has awesome graphics and plenty of different types of races to play. AND it has multiplayer so you can play with other crazy fans like me! Definitely worth the price to get the game.
006202406X|1.0|None of the books in this trilogy take more than a day to read.  The problem is, they're so lightweight and senseless that it's hard to remember the nondescript characters and convoluted yet nonsensical plots between books.  I read these books because my granddaughter loves them.  This third novel purports to explain the reasons for the factions and battles in the Divergent and Insurgent.  It doesn't make sense and it doesn't hold together.  When I read the first two novels, it struck me as odd that no one in the fenced-in dystopian Chicago had any curiosity whatsoever about the world outside the fence.  Where did they get gasoline?  Where was their electricity generated?  Where did they get coffee?  Or fresh vegetables in winter?  It seemed to me that they were a pretty dull bunch, Erudition notwithstanding.  No wonder they didn't question their ridiculous faction system.  It never occurred to them that they weren't the only people in the world?  That their city couldn't possibly be self-sufficient? I guess if they were actually smart or curious, they might be forced to ask questions that would point out the thinness of the plot premises.<br /><br />Now, there are a bunch of faction kids from Chicago have gone outside the gate, all the way to the government Genetic Welfare \\"compound\\" at O'Hare Airport.  They travel by truck--they don't have to fend for themselves for even ten minutes, although of course people are trying to kill them.  This compound, which still flies planes, is a few minutes outside of the fenced-in city where they lived, yet they've never seen an airplane and don't know about air travel--although it appears that the planes fly close enough to Chicago to drop vaporized serum over the city. I guess it never occurred to them to wonder about that silver cylinder with wings cruising in the sky.  Why should they?  They don't wonder about anything else either.<br /><br />Needless to say, there's some romantic strife between Tris and Tobias.  And an epicbattle, where the faction kids outwit everyone and never wonder at their good luck:  they need to go down a restricted hallway to the most secret weapon storage?  No problem.  No guards will challenge them.  Need to learn how to make and detonate bombs? No problem, and it only takes a couple of minutes!  Although they're newbies to the facility, they have no problems finding trusted allies immediately.  They can sneak out and back in with impunity.  Need weapons?  Easy peasy.<br /><br />As has been mentioned in other posts--this story is told in the voices of both Tris and Tobias.  The problem is, there's no difference between their voices.  Not one iota.  The device is a little more confusing than it needs to be.<br /><br />The purported explanation of the factions in Chicago is silly and convoluted.  The threat to the future of the people of Chicago is contrived.  Tris's and Tobias's roles in these matters are just plain ludicrous.<br /><br />This is truly one of the most dreadful book series I've ever encountered.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I know after you've read other reviews that it doesn't sound good, but this book is amazing. This book was unpredictable, and kept you asking what's going to happen next. You may ask people why they didn't like it...They will most likely say the ending. I loved the ending. It was realistic and even though it made me cry, I knew that Veronica Roth picked the best ending yet. I love how she didn't put so much romance in it that it got annoying, but just the right amount that you wanted to read more of Tris and Tobias. I liked how she switched POVs because now we can see things from Tobias's and Tris's point of view. She put characters back in the book that you missed, and didn't over exaggerate on the jealousy and romance. It may have gotten confusing a little, but she explained it well enough that I understood it throughout the book. Veronica has many wise words in this book, and no matter what I think you will love it. If you actually loved Divergent and Insurgent, you will fall head over heels for this one. This book (including the other two) are on my top 15 books that I love. I've read a ton of books this past year, and these books are one of my favorites. In my opinion, I wouldn't want to read book after book where there is always a happy ending and happily ever after. I'm not saying that's a bad, I love happy endings, but sometimes you need a little twist and this book will give it to you. It's realistic and I think she did an OUTSTANDING job writing the conclusion to the Divergent Trilogy.<br /><br />READ IT!!!!!!!!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game is very cool and very addictive. I don't know if you use # but this game is totally #awesome.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I am and always will be a fan of Stephen King. I have read a only a few of his books, but have watched a lot of his movies. I think the book Doctor Sleep was really great, done in a fashion that only Stephen King can do.
B00FJU1HLC|5.0|Great movie for family and friends. There are great lessons in this story. High Definition quality was great as well. This was my second rental from Amazon through my Blu-Ray player. It works great thank GOD!!!!
0744014956|5.0|The book is a great collectors item and it is a great guide to the game too bad its not a guide to the online but it still works!!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Liane Moriarty weaves an intricate story, with these<br /> characters in a book that brings out just how much our actions affect not just us, but people we haven't even met yet. The epilogue was an interesting twist to the storyline.
B008LXZEYU|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. Feels like I'm hopping in 8 years too late. Best movie I've seen all year.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I loved the first two books, this one was disappointing.  Definitely not the ending that you expect. This one doesn't hold you in utter suspense either.  You kind of see what's coming and it loses the excitement that the first two books had.  Not a horrible read, but not in comparison to divergent and insurgent.  :(
B00FN8FCO8|5.0|Korn came back with a mordern version of their old sound and it worked out great in my opinion. This is definitely in my top three favorite Korn albums!
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|Very good movie. Wife and I truly enjoyed the storyline, filmography and the 3D!!! Delivery was quick and easy. Recommend it to all
B001EC3JME|4.0|This holster is a great buy and provides a very secure hold on any flashlight you use it for.<br />If you have a wrist strap on the bottom of your flashlight...it will most likely have to be removed as<br />it interferes with putting the flashlight in and out of the holster.
B00AEFY6ZQ|5.0|This is a true classic.  Lots of excitement and wonderful music!!!  This is the kind of movie you can sit down with your entire family amd watch. It is dated to the period of time amd let's face it we do not condone trapping animals like they did back then but it's got beautiful scenery and romance and comedy.  It's a guilty pleasure!
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I chose this rate because it is very handy to be able to look and see what the weather is to be for an extended period.  It is quick to look into.  They seem to be pretty accurate.

B00FWLDHSY|5.0|I really enjoyed this action packed movie! It is great from being to the end. I would encourage everyone who enjoys action movie than watch this one.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I loved the personal references to his upbringing, all the way up through Seal Team Six. Chris Kyle who tragically passed away while work with former military personal for the company he helped develop to help injured members of all forces. Not much more to say about this man, except he was taken away far too soon.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I love it!  Most alarms are loud and annoying...I use the bells. It is soft and gentle. Who really wants to get up in the morning?
B000SW4DLM|3.0|I wouldn't classify it as entertaining.  It's dark and gloomy.  A good chance to see these actors in a film early in their careers.  As a 'cult classic', I can at least say that I've seen it.
B0011U5E1S|5.0|Love!!!!  Grew up listening to them.  Will always love them. This to me was a steal.  Thank you, amazon.  Miss you, Kurt.
0316055433|2.0|The idea for the book was great. The NYC characters were interesting. The writer would not shut up! Whoever was suppose to be guiding this writer and editing this book did a terrible job. Half the book could be just tossed in the trash. Also the author obnoxiously inserts political ideas which insult and had this lovely thought about homeschooled children: \\"giving me a sort of dumb, shifty, homeschooled look\\".  I would suggest if she writes further works of fiction she not insert her anti-American, anti-homeschool rhetoric as it wrecks the flow of the narrative. Nothing is more boring than having an author gratuitously insert his or her politics into a fiction book people have shelled out good money for. So, all in all I would love to read this book unencumbered by the authors politics and keystroke diarrhea.
