0783225725|5.0|This is one of the superb Clint Eastwood westerns; he is the star and he directs. A mysterious stranger (Eastwood) rides his horse down a mountain toward the town Largo, out of a mist, as splendid music plays in the background. He passes a graveyard, which is significant, and rides into town, as the inhabitants gather at windows to watch him arrive. They sense something amiss, but do not know what. He is startled as he rides through town when he hears a stage coach driver snap his whip. He walks into a saloon, orders a beer, and is taunted by three thugs. He ignores them, strides across the muddy street to a barber shop for a shave and bath for ninety cents. The thugs follow him and try to shoot him, but he kills all three. The town people are amazed at his skill.<br /><br /> As he falls asleep that night in a hotel, he sees/remembers a man being beaten to death with whips by three men, as he calls out to the town folks for help. They watch, but give no aid. The town leaders arrest the three while they are sleeping drunk, but not for the murder. Why, we wonder, did everyone do what they did? What prompted the beating? Were the citizens cowards or were they complicit in the murder? Who was killed?<br /><br /> The three murderers are released from prison after serving their six month sentence and are returning to Largo for money and revenge. The town people are afraid of these gunfighters. They beg Eastwood to help them. They offer him anything he wants. He looks at the people with contempt. He agrees and takes whatever he wants. Among many other things, he seizes the hotel for himself, clutches expensive cloths,grabs many items and gives them as gifts, enters the saloon and orders free drinks for everybody, removes the mayor and sheriff from their offices and gives their jobs to a man the town despises. He helps the town prepare for the arrival of the three thugs by taking material from its citizens. He has the town painted red and changes its name on the sign that reads Largo to Hell. It is clear that he wants to destroy the town and hurt and perhaps kill its people. We wonder why, and like the town people and the three thugs, we ask: who is this man.eads Largo to Hell. It is clear that he wants to destroy the town and hurt and perhaps kill its people. We wonder why, and like the town people and the three thugs, we ask: who is this man.

B004GP3DTK|5.0|Being the 80's / 90's cheeser that I am, I have most of Mr. Big's CDs, with the exception of Live at the Budoken and their last studio CD.     I downloaded this from amazon on an impulse buy, and I have to say, this may be their most solid CD to date.  Sure, their first offering with songs like \\"addicted to that rush\\" were awesome, but I think they gel here musically better than ever.  Great job guys!!!
B00005OAIE|5.0|Some people love John Meyer and some don't. Why did Amazon have someone who hates John do the review of this beautiful album?
4789009637|4.0|Before I begin, I want to make it absolutely clear that one word describes this book - \\"awesome.\\" I have been recommended many, many times by friends and family members and I am honestly glad I purchased it. The only reason why it gets 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the condition I received the book in... Amazon has always been great in the past, but this book came and it had some damage to the dust cover - along with some black, \\"greasy\\"-like smears. When I pay nearly forty bucks for a book - I want it to be in dang good condition...brand spanking new.<br /><br />But anyways - about the book...This book is awesome, as I said above. You jump right into Japanese in the beginning, and everything is explained very clearly. What's also great is that everything provided is useful. Also, the Practice sections are great for reinforcing what you just learned. I couldn't imagine owning this book without having the audio CDs, so I really recommend buying them. I would look on eBay or something first (which I did) - though - before paying a ridiculous price. The audio is very nice with the dialogs and exercises, a must have for me.<br /><br />So, buy this book! But beware that someone needs to inventory their items a little better. You might get an ugly copy - like i did.
0439023521|5.0|after flipping the first couple of pages, i could not put it down. this book is so brilliantly paced, characters are described in the way you get so attached to them, i was actually very sad to finish the third book... i wish there were more to this series, the ending was surprising in a way, though through reading all three books you understand who Katniss is and why things were done the way they did. matter of fact, i will definately go back and read the whole thing over again. all the characters are very different, yet so attractive in many different ways. this is definately not a seris for very young ones because it does show brutal nature of human, it does exhausts you emotionally from time to time, this is not a happy book. if you are looking for a happy, bubbly book, this is not it. however, i would recommend it to everyone. the story is so striking, this is my second series of books that i could be so into in the last 15 years, i never really picked up books up until now, and this series opened up a whole new world of books for me, now i'm stuggling to find something that's this good. lol i hope they will do a good job making a movie of this series, which will be very hard since the books are just so amazingly good!!!
B003ES61EE|4.0|If you are a professional photographer you are not going to like this.  If you are looking for convenience in case you need to clean a lens, then this works.  The pictures are accurate, you get two surfaces that can be used holding as a pen and you get a slider button that hides the brush.    Again this works well on the road and if you are a pro looking for a pro cleaning kit, you will obviously be disappointed.    I really wish it had instructions though.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|Harry Potter is by far the BEST series in both books and in movies.  We have been anxiously awaiting the release of the latest movie to DVD. Having seen the latest part 1 four times at theaters, we cannot wait to watch it at home.  With all of the limted choices offered to young people today, this series has captivated my childrens' hearts and minds for so many years.
B001E2JNA6|5.0|i've been a huge fan of the original dvd version for a number of years and i have to say the blu-ray version is AMAZING!  everything looks wonderful, so colorful and rich- even my husband watched it!    if you love pride and prejudice, you'll love the blu-ray! :)
B000NIVJEU|1.0|For some reason I watched this movie again after a couple of years to remind myself how bad it was. I just wish Paolini hadn't given up his material for this horrible movie. It's horrible that now his other books have no chance at being made. I completely understand that sometimes a book has to be modified to be a movie, and I have no problem when it's done successively (like LoTR). However the script writers, producers, and director simply raped the original story to a point where I almost didn't recognize the story outside of 'boy finds egg and becomes dragon rider.' The book is long, and for some reason they decided to make it an hour and a half long, which is a length that no fantasy story could properly be told in. Because of this they cut out all of the character development, making the viewer not care about anything that's happening. The worst part of this is where Saphira is a baby dragon, flies for a minute and comes back as a full adult, I mean what were they thinking. I just wonder if Paolini had any involvement, or he was just so excited to have his book turned into a movie he didn't care what they did. All the acting is also horrible, whether this is because of the dreadful dialogue or bad directing I'm not sure. The only decent actor is Brom, and because of the story cuts, I really didn't care about him when he died. I just wish they could do a reboot of this movie, but the fact is, there are a lot of better fantasy books (even though I loved Eragon) out there that should be made into movies first.
B002KKBV8I|5.0|This is a great toy. I have two children who are 6 and 3. They both enjoy playing with this toy. I also enjoy playing with this toy. My 6 year old would definitely like to have more in order to make more complicated shapes/structures. Overall a very cool toy.
0446563048|5.0|Tony is truly amazing and such a welcome fresh breath of air.....everyone should read this. I have not read a book in years, but I found/made time to read this...
0380799006|5.0|I was able to immediately begin applying the suggestions from this book and found that results followed quickly. I love the specificness of the advice and the cartoons make it so clear. I have 4 and 6 year old girls and once I shifted some of my responses I was surprised how much they opened up and shared their feelings in a new way. Our relationship is stronger now, even though I'm less involved in their problems and fights than I was before. Amazing!
0525951652|5.0|I was initially daunted by the length of this book, but since I enjoyed this author's other books I decided to forge ahead.  Once into it, I found myself turning page after page, hardly aware that I had gotten to page 100 without realizing it.  I enjoyed the book immensely.  All sections were well-written, including the evocation of the time period with historical detail, and the intricate interplay between the characters and story lines.  This did not \\"feel\\" like reading a nearly 1000-page book.  There is nothing to criticize about this book, except that I am sorry to have to wait for the rest of the story...
0394527771|5.0|Delivered March 16/2011, the first date-of-delivery specified by the sender, in mint condition, double-packaged.  It's one of my favourite books and to get a First Edition is a thrill.
0385340575|2.0|On one hand: Lee Child is a good writer. On the other: Oh my god... I just can't get beyond how Child opens up every one of the Reacher stories I have read. Here, Reacher is riding a subway car late at night when he spots a female dressed up in a bulky winter coat. Its summer, she's murmuring to herself, she has a 1000 foot stare, she has her hand in a bag. All of this adds up to make her a 100% match to a study by Israeli special forces on 'how to spot a suicide bomber.<br /><br />Now, spotting a suicide bomber on the subway late at night is just an ordinary day in the life of Reacher. This stuff happens to him all the time. The lady turns out not to be a bomber, but does commit suicide right in front of him. And it starts a huge conspiracy story that comes down around poor Reacher.<br /><br />This is what I hate... HATE about Child's writing. You might find your self in the middle of a political conspiracy if your a newspaper reporter digging into a lead. But here, Reacher ends up in a plot about as easily as batter flows into a waffle iron griddle. And this is the 13th time he has ended up in a situation like this since this si the 13th in the series. All of them are insane. And what gets me is that once Reacher is 'in the know' he goes about like this is a game of pinball. Everything falls into the right place at the right time. Ugh! Bad plotting.
B004IJZFP4|4.0|Greg Hampton (producer of the Tommy Bolin Whips and Roses CDs) has released an alternative version of the Teaser album.  All these songs are alternate and extended versions of the tracks that appeared on the original Teaser album plus a couple of bonus versions of Crazed Fandango. All the material was remixed from original multi-track tapes, and most of the material hasn't been heard by the public before in any form. The package includes a 24-page booklet with rare photos but no text.  So missing is any background text on the album (about the recording, Bolin personal history, or even the mixing process).  And sadly, no remastered or remixed songs from the original 1975 album.  While I appreciate the unreleased versions, I had hoped for the original recordings with some improved fidelity.  This material would make a great second disc on a true deluxe version of a re-issued album.  So it's deceptive to call this album \\"deluxe\\".  It's truly an album of outtakes and alternative version.  Is there a legal reason the original versions have not be re-released?

081297381X|1.0|Basically every statement the author said, I asked: SO WHAT?     \\"the observation of even a million white swans does not justify the statement 'all swans are white.' \\" SO WHAT?  We can't predict everything. SO WHAT?  Something we can't prevent. SO WHAT?  Something we can't prepare enough. SO WHAT?    What a crazy world. Some crazy guy wrote a book full of boxxxney and sell thousands of copies by telling people you can not predict or prevent something and make a lot of money. What a waste of my time, I just throw away my $15 in the trash. I didn't even want to sell it as used to waste the earth resources, worse case u can do to your self is go to library and waste 30minutes of your life to read something like 'Fool by randomness' and 'Black swan'. Nassim go hide in a cave and stop writing, the earth will thank you.
B003Y74KC0|4.0|This case is made from thick silicone, and provides adequate protection for most responsible users. It is easy to slip on and off, good for people who use other cases (such as a charging case). I have been using it for weeks and have not had a problem with it coming off unintentionally, but it is quite loose on the longer sides. I find it very comfortable to hold in my hand as I use my phone, and it provides a good amount of traction so it doesn't easily slip off surfaces. Is it the best case of all time? No. But it's a good value, and extremely functional.
B004BLJQOK|4.0|The story is wisely spun based on the original novel \\"Let the Right one In\\". The acting is fine, but the horror elements are likely to turn those off who do not like to be grossed out. Slasher film enthusiasts will be disappointed to find it isn't a slasher. For the rest of us willing to let the movie stand on its own merits, we won't be disappointed. It is a vampire's movie from a vampire's point of view. Abby isn't a serial killer, really, she just needs to drink blood to live. Alright, despite the totally bizarre nature of the vampire right there (really, think about it), she must be a kind and gentle soul, well except for the fact that she is codependent on another person for her feeding frenzy, and ultimately destroys that person for whatever limited safety and relationship she can provide them from the outside world (and really - high school bullies who would actually drown a kid they don't like? Possible in our sick world, but unlikely).
0439023521|5.0|The Hunger Games By Suzanne Collins is an amazing book that starts and pulls you straight into a world where a Capital has been raised from the ruins of North America. The capital made 12 districts that live in fear, once every year The Hunger Games are held, a live TV show where 24 contestants, a boy and girl (between the ages of 12-18) from each district fight to the death. We follow Katniss from district 12, a girl who is a hunter and knows how to survive at all costs. But she soon realizes she may have to rely on more than her skills to survive             The book is intelligent, heat pounding, and suspense filled. The main character is very realistic and easy to follow. She is a strong female character that doesn't  need a boy to help her. The beginning of the book is slow and it takes time to paint a picture of the world these characters live in. You learn exactly how Katniss came to be such a good hunter and the live she lives in a district ruled by a capital. When she gets picked and whisked away to the capital the book picks up and you are trust into a world of lies and betrayal. Once the Games begin I recommend you either take a break or get ready for a long read because the rest of the book is a wild ride that sends you in different directions action scenes and game twists. There is something for everyone, action and lots of it, a spark of sci-fi, a love triangle (but nothing sappy or cliche). Teens, both boy and girls can love it, as well as adults. I very Highly recommend you read it.         A         P.S A movie is in pre-production and could be an amazing movie if they just have the right cast and scrip. If im not wrong the writer is helping with the scrip so look out for the next huge thing!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I'm on day 8 of Jillian Michaels 30 Day Shred and I'm loving it! The first day i thought i was going to die...its just a 20-30min workout but it felt like it was never going to end! But it got easier in as quick as the 3rd day. I know she says that you have to do the workout EVERYDAY but i didn't think i'd be able to handle that so i've decided that i'm going to take a day off after every four days of working out. It might be a little too soon to say but i feel like this workout is really working! Some key things i love about this workout:  1. I had terrible stamina but it has now gotten drastically better. The first day it was the cardio that hurt me the worst but now its one of the most enjoyable parts of the workout for me (Abs are my favourite..coz atleast i get to lie down!! LOL).  2. I feel stronger, leaner, tougher...and its only day 7!  3. I usually don't like working out ...but because this workout makes me feel so good, i actually look forward to doing it the next day!!  Overall, it's a great workout! Its tough but not too tough...perfect for any level of fitness! Like Jillian Michaels says...if a 400lb person can do it...so can you!
0143034901|5.0|One of my favorite books to ever come across my attention. I had never heard of Carlos Zafon until I read this book & afterwards I was convinced I must read more of his work. This story delivers suspense, intellect, emotion, and intrigue. It was a portal to another world and I thank the author for his gift of taking me there.
030746363X|4.0|Tim's book and his experiments and wealth of knowledge makes for a great book that made me think long and hard about a lot of beliefs on body and working out I have had. I started doing kettlebell swings today, and it is quite impressive. Love the book, will continue to support.
B003Y74KCK|3.0|The \\"AmazonBasics Silicone Case for AT&T and Verizon iPhone 4 (White)\\" is a very simple and not particularly confidence inspiring cover for your iPhone 4.  It is very lightweight, non-bulky and has a fairly firm grip due to a rippled pattern on the back.  But its very softness does not bode well for protection if dropped.  Additionally, mine did not fit tightly enough to suit me as I found the phone sliding around within the case after a short time.  Similarly, the longer side coverings not only were unsturdy but often bowed outward allowing the phone to easily slip out.    The price is a bit high for such a questionable protective case but as a basic entry level case it does have some appeal especially to those who wanted a white iPhone--this case can give them that illusion.  If your expectations are kept real and low, this will be an acceptable basic phone covering.
0756404738|5.0|This book continues the building of the legend of Kvothe the Arcane.  He meets Felurian, trains with the Adem, conducts all manner of mischief and continues to expand upon his own rumors.  He is a young innkeeper who claims in the last book that the onset of war in his country is his fault.  This book hints at various possibilities that may lend to his concern.    It is in Rothfuss's style: simple phrasing with a lot of thought behind the words.  Scenes don't simply build to climax but are knotted through with smiles, frowns, and surprises.  He is writing epic fantasy -- you need to remember what has gone before to appreciate the present.  The ripples matter along with the waves.  He presents ideas that provoke the pensive and I enjoy that -- it isn't mere action, he makes you consider your beliefs and convinces you of right, wrong, and choice.    He's an interesting author and it's an interesting book.  After 1000 pages (or 900+), I didn't want it to end. I want to learn more about Bast, Denna, Elodin, Kvothe. I want to know what happens to all of them and what happened to them before.  I don't think an author can hope for more.
B0034G4P7G|3.0|The story was mildly interesting, but after watching the film for 2 hours I felt as if I just finished reading a one-page magazine article. I was expecting something a little more dynamic. And please someone stop J-Timber from acting, he's just awful.<br /><br />FINAL GRADE: C+
B00479SVBU|5.0|This is the perfect solution to listening to podcasts in any vehicle with an FM radio. The \\"pause / play\\" button is front and center, and is the most convenient way to pause your show. Even with the vehicle turned off, the unit maintains power through the cig lighter jack, so when you return, you simply push \\"play\\" and pick up where you left off. The cig lighter jack mount is the best because it means you never have to put batteries in the unit, and it stays put on your dash board instead of rattling all over the car like a unit tethered to a wire would. Love the SD or USB Thumb Drive capability.
0439023521|4.0|This was one of those read-it-while-walking-down-the-sidewalk books.  It was that compelling.  A masterful job.  Well -- almost all of it.  Some reviewers, I know, had a basic problem with the premise: How can a ritual so horrific, so brutal and cruel, play as entertainment to so many seemingly sane people?  To answer, I point you to . . . a big chunk of the 20th century.  People, alas, have sunk this low before.  My problem with the book -- and let me be clear and point out that it is my ONLY problem with this otherwise outstanding thriller -- is that the author makes a strategic decision about two thirds of the way through the book that I thought was a bit of a cheat.  I'm not going to spell it out.  That'd be giving it away.  But come back here after you've read the book and you'll understand what I'm talking about.  In short, she sets up a certain dilemma -- a seemingly unsolvable dilemma -- and it's clear that this is going to create, at some point, a great deal of tension and soul searching.  Then, poof, the dilemma is gone, just like that.  What ultimately happens is not surprising (as one of the main characters explicitly notes), and to her credit, the author does try to get that tension back in.  But it doesn't quite kick.  I think things would have played out better if Collins simply let things run the way we expected them to from the start (I'm sorry if I'm being coy here; I really don't want to ruin this book for anyone).  Unfortunately, this really isn't an isolated situation, either.  Each time this same key dilemma -- and the same tension and moral quandary it will raise -- plays out (and it does several times in the book, but one instance is far more significant than the others), it is conveniently resolved.  Tension is what makes a thriller.  By letting it play out more, Collins could have made a nailbiting thriller a truly unforgettable and almost unbearable one.    My only other comment is a cautionary note of sorts.  This book is considered a \\"teen\\" read.  But keep in mind, it's incredibly violent, and heavily populated with characters who have no problem or qualms with incredible, pointless violence (well, I suppose there is a point, but it's a rather disturbing one).  Parents may want to consider that before picking this up for the youngins.  I'm 44, grew up on Stephen King books, and frankly, this book was a lot for me to digest.  That said, I'm going to eagerly digest the next two volumes.
0756404738|5.0|He did, he wrote an excellent sequel. I can see where people wanting stuff to happen might be disappointed,first because stuff is happening, but not the stuff people are waiting for, and second because it is obvious the author relishes the slow, story telling pace,and it is his call. Imagine people here, at amazon's review insisting to  Herman Melville that Moby Dick be written differently. As for myself, I love it,for the stories told are wonderful to read. Flaubert once mentioned \\" he licks his words like a cow licks its calf\\" , and mr. Ruthfuss is like that, each page is a wonder for book lovers.  He spends a goodish part of his book on some kind of oriental like martial arts stuff, which I personally dislike, but he writes it so wonderfully well, that even I enjoyed it. As for the fact that barely a year has passed by, well,that was when it was decided it would happen and  it has to be told as it is, and if the character is a teenager  he does not behave like one in most actions, and thankfully was never expected to learn to pronounce abracadabra or incunabula or something cute correctly to make wondrous things happens like other poorer books, he had to work and work really hard for it.   A good book is like a good lover, it robs you of sleep and leaves you not satisfyied with another for a long time, and if I have a grievance about this book is that I am old and I needed my sleep and it robbed me of it :)
1883217040|2.0|I can go on all day about the discrepancies in this book and Mark Levine's overpowering influence on jazz education. All you need to do is look up Robert Rawlins's (author of [[ASIN:0634086782 Jazzology: The Encyclopedia of Jazz Theory for All Musicians (Jazz Instruction)]]) review of the book, and the the Levine spell will be broken! I personally have a large amount of pent up resentment towards the Jazz Theory Book; I bought a copy when I began studying jazz in 2000, and thought of it as \\"the jazz bible\\" as so many still do. It has it's useful moments; I have read it cover to cover, looked up just about every song that excepts where taken from, and applied his concepts to my instrument to the best of my capability.<br /><br />Years later I stumbled upon Bert Ligon's work [[ASIN:0793561930 Connecting Chords with Linear Harmony (Jazz Book)]] and I bought it on a whim. This was the beginning of my wake-up period. This book contained the meat and potatoes to make solid sounding jazz lines that take advantage of the indispensable dimension in jazz: \\"time\\" aka \\"rhythm and phrasing\\". For Mark's \\"99%\\" theory vs \\"1%\\" magic, Bert stepped in like Einstein over Newton. I recently purchased [[ASIN:0634038613 Jazz Theory Resources: Volume 1]]  [[ASIN:0634038621 Jazz Theory Resources: Volume 2 (Jazz Book)]]. Which are truly the most comprehensive books in print on the subject of jazz theory. They are written and illustrated beautifully. They are easy to follow and logically presented. They are a great remedy for un-learning some of the common pitfalls of Mark Levine. He also sets of clear explanations of \\"functional harmony\\" and \\"modal frameworks\\" which Mark did not hardly acknowledge a difference between. Bert's concepts have influenced my own book: [[ASIN:0615431119 Chord-Scale Theory and Linear Harmony for Guitar: Creative Tools for Improvisation and Composition in Contemporary Music]](My book is not an alternative, mind you, it is a guitar fretboard book; I suggest Ligon's work and Jazzology for comprehensive jazz theory books.)<br /><br />Here are some critical points...<br /><br />I resent that Mark has given \\"chord/scale theory\\" such publicity and a negative reputation. The method is valid enough, but it needs to be enhanced with the building blocks of melody: voice leading, embellishment devises, phrasing, guide tones, anticipations, delayed resolutions, harmonic generalization/specificity. Hierarchy among note within chord-scales (stable vs tendency tones), polychords, triadic generalization (not just \\"inside vs outside\\", triadic superimposition are all worthy of mention in any comprehensive jazz book.<br /><br /> \\"Avoid\\" notes are used all over jazz on to resolve to consonant tones within the melodies or chord-scales. The term took off like wildfire, and needs to be tamed down. Bird used a lot of P4's over maj or dom chords and resolves them to the M3's. They are an essential part of the bebop vocabulary. The term \\"tendency tone\\" says it all.<br /><br />\\"Modal interchange\\" or parallel keys are not mentioned. There are huge in jazz and should not be overlooked harmonically. This is not surprising because he dosn't even explain functional harmony outside of ii V7 I progressions. Classic tunes like Night and Day, Hot House, Ladybird, Green Dolphin Street are all written with modal interchange.<br /><br />Post-bop modal jazz is overemphasized. There was \\"good\\" jazz before the 60's (though I am a \\"modal jazz\\" advocate myself). To fully grasp \\"jazz theory\\" all of jazz history should be taken into consideration. There was no chord/scale theory in Armstrong's day, but there was a clear melodic/harmonic/rhythmic vocabulary that was understood by all of the great players. Later jazz was a response to earlier jazz: \\"no him, no me\\" - Dizzy about Armstrong.<br /><br />He almost single-handedly sent the harmonic minor scale into obscurity! It was used to outline V7 chords throughout classic jazz and bebop, and needs to be recognized despite the \\"avoid\\" P4 he couldn't deal with. He also turns students away from Aeolian (natural minor) though it too, has common use in jazz. Min(b6) chords are actually major seventh chords with the third in the bass; a simpler vertical harmony. Aeolian is used on tonic minors in jazz, similar to other forms of music. Andrew Hill's (jazz composer/pianist) compositions could not exist without it.<br /><br />The progression iii V7/ii should NOT always be reharmonized as ii V7's in a key one whole step higher. This obscures the overall sense of key at many times. Also I VI ii V7 are I V7/ii ii V7. His careless use of Roman numeral analysis can really confuse beginners, and frustrate advanced musicians who are familiar with the standard RNA system. He seems to disregard functional theory. Secondary dominants are everywhere in jazz, and they need to me included in order to see the composition as a whole, not a series of fragmented stable (functionless) modes. Modal frameworks are a big part of jazz, but functional harmony is often blended within.<br /><br />Susb9 Phrygian modal chords are used sparingly in jazz.

Min(b6) chords are actually major seventh chords with the third in the bass; a simpler vertical harmony. Aeolian is used on tonic minors in jazz, similar to other forms of music. Andrew Hill's (jazz composer/pianist) compositions could not exist without it.     The progression iii V7/ii should NOT always be reharmonized as ii V7's in a key one whole step higher. This obscures the overall sense of key at many times. Also I VI ii V7 are I V7/ii ii V7. His careless use of Roman numeral analysis can really confuse beginners, and frustrate advanced musicians who are familiar with the standard RNA system. He seems to disregard functional theory. Secondary dominants are everywhere in jazz, and they need to me included in order to see the composition as a whole, not a series of fragmented stable (functionless) modes. Modal frameworks are a big part of jazz, but functional harmony is often blended within.     Susb9 Phrygian modal chords are used sparingly in jazz.

Love the plot and both Val Kilmer and Elsabeth Shue were great together. So much great chemical between them. This movie deserves 10 stars!

B004B63M1S|3.0|Based on the 70s exploitation flicks that had a stupid plot and enough sex and violence if you weren't laughing at the stupid plot.  There's a lot of known actors and actresses in this picture so they're all in on the joke.  That said, you have to like these types of films and I have mixed feelings about it.  Didn't really grow up with this stuff so it's a bit weird at times, though, I did laugh at the intestinal scene.  DIALOGUE/CHARACTERS: C plus to B minus; VIOLENCE/SEX: B; STORY/PLOTTING: B minus; OVERALL GRADE: B minus; WHEN WATCHED: Mid March 2011.
B000035P5E|4.0|Good adaptation of the book. Many suspense filled scenes and believable acting. A number of changes from the book did not, in my opinion, detract materially from the screen story. Hard to find in the world, I'm glad I bought it online.
B0049P1VHS|4.0|A mature, sophisticated look on the walking dead with human morality interwoven into the tale.  Based on a popular graphic novel.  Nice special effects for the zombie fans.  Acting is somewhat good to good with moments that are very good, excellent and dare I say even superb.  Six episodes didn't feel like quite enough and it was just gathering steam and getting interesting and then we have to wait for the second season.  I get that's a budget issue but it still sort of sucked. Nice surprise with the Hispanic Gang. Nice escape of the main character at the end for the hero in the first episode.  CHARACTER/DIALOGUE: B; STORY/PLOTTING: B minus; SPECIAL EFFECTS: B plus; THEME PORTRAYALS: B; OVERALL GRADE: B; WHEN WATCHED: February to mid March 2011.
1591843065|2.0|Good content, but faaarrrr too much talk about it, thus the rating.  If this book were 10 to 30 pages in length, I would definitely give it five stars.  But shame on the author for all his self back-patting and lengthy writing.  Disappointed!     Basically, don't be afraid to try to visualize your ideas.  Even if your drawings are crappy, they'll be a reference point to talk and develop from.
B00026WU64|5.0|although I've owned this record for years in all it's various formats, never got around to writing a review. But a recent story in news about the girl in the photo, Suze Rotolo, passing away made me dust off the CD and listen to it again. What an amazing breakout LP from an artist who set the tone for my generation and for the generations that followed. You might also want to check out Suze's book published in 2008 titled \\"A Freewheelin' Time, A Memoir of Greenwich Village in the Sixties\\", a very interesting read.

B0049PNOS2|5.0|I have been Eros's fan for almost 20 years, and it seems everything he does just has to be perfect, and every release is better than the previous. This concert is incredibly amazing, the visual effects, the sound, the crowd, the musicians is just great.  Just to give a better idea of how impressive are the visual effects in this concert, the director is the same one that the cirque du soleil used in Las Vegas for the Criss Angel's Believe show, the Canadian Serge Denoncourt.<br /><br />Anyways, I recommend this DVD to anyone that wants to enjoy a couple of hours of great music and great stage and visual effects.
B003VQM2LU|3.0|I can't quite put my finger on it, but this one just doesn't inspire the praise I usually have for a Bad Seeds or Grinderman release.  It sounds like they're playing someone else's songs.  Worm tamer reminds me of a 70s Zeppelin song and many of the others seem derivative as well.  The first Grinderman release had an excellent grungy surf/blues/rock sound and this one reminds me of mediocre psychedelia that is catapulted by dissonance for dissonance's sake.  I should also add that the cover photo reflects the cheesy content.  More appropriate for a Motley Crue or Toto 70-80s release.  I'm waiting for the rudder to stabilize...perhaps the next Bad Seeds release?
1591843790|5.0|When I was a computer newbie in the 1990s, Guy Kawasaki's MacWorld columns opened a whole world of technology to me. I've followed his career ever since, though as a former English major and a writer, I know little about marketing or the business world in general, so I don't suppose I'm in the target demo for his books. But I picked up Enchantment the other day and read it in two sittings, amazed at how much it relates to what I do. There's an ethical core to Guy's approach, a clear desire to reach mutually beneficial outcomes that I think can (and should) be applied to many fields of endeavor. I recommend Enchantment to anyone, in any profession.
B004BLJQOK|5.0|\\"Let Me In\\" is the Hollywood remake of \\"Let the Right One In\\", a lyrical Swedish movie that explores myriad themes - friendship, first love, bullying, adolescence, and vampirism. One might think there are too many themes to be handled in one movie, but both the original film and remake managed to handle these multiple themes in a credible manner.<br /><br />The remake is not exactly faithful to the original, and viewers who have watched both will notice the differences such as the opening scene, the changes in characterization for some of the minor characters, etc. For the most part though, the remake focuses on the essential parts of the story just as in the original and makes for riveting viewing. This is not the movie to watch if you're looking for pretty vampires smooching around, or a splatterfest with non-stop action. There's hints of a romance, slowly simmering, a mixture of Gothic and sweet teenage love, and there's also lots of blood, but by no means does this movie careen along - it takes its time developing the characters, drawing viewers into this strange, dark world where nothing is at it appears, and focuses viewers' attention on the two main characters.<br /><br />The story is of teenager Owen [Kodi Smit-McPhee] who is a victim of bullying by a group of classmates. Owen doesn't fight back, instead he thinks up ways of avenging himself whilst roaming about his apartment complex during the winter with copious amounts of snow all over. Whilst out on his nightly jaunt, Owen meets a strange girl named Abby [Chloe Moretz] who tells him straight off that she can't be his friend. Abby has just moved into the apartment next door to Owen's with a man Owen thinks is her dad. Despite Abby's words, the pair are drawn to each other, and form a real friendship. For a while at least, Owen remains blissfully unaware of the dark secret hidden by Abby and her `dad'.<br /><br />\\"Let Me In\\" is as much a coming-of-age tale as it is a vampire tale - both threads are credibly woven into the story, and neither one detracts from the other. The coming-of-age part is ably pulled off by the two leads - young Owen and Abby manouver around the awkwardness of male-female relationships with a sweetness that I have not seen on screen for a long time, and both take turns in playing the 'stronger' role. The vampire thread is also credibly woven in - yes, there are the compulsory gore scenes that go with the territory, but never in an over the top manner. Even the effects are rather muted, making them all the more credible. The cinematography of the snow-covered landscape does much to add to the stark atmosphere and to enhance the desperate sense of isolation that goes with being a vampire. Abby is a young-looking  yet old soul trapped within the confines of immortality, and the necessary brutality that comes with it. The viewer struggles between revulsion and compassion for this lonely vampire.<br /><br />\\"Let Me In' doesn't exactly conform to any particular genre - part adolescent drama, part vampire/horror/suspense, it is nevertheless a compelling watch and a must-see. The film is rated R, with Spanish subtitles, and English subtitles for the Deaf and Hearing Impaired. The film is in color, and the running time is 115 minutes. Special features include an audio commentary with director Matt Reeves; a feature titled From the Inside: A Look At The Making of Let Me In; The Art of Special Effects; Car Crash Sequence Step-By-Step; Deleted Scenes; Trailer Gallery; and, a Poster Gallery.and neither one detracts from the other.

141694737X|5.0|My 12-month old son LOVES this book. By far his favorite. We've read other lift-the-flap books and this one is, so far, the best.  It keeps his attention because he loves to lift the flap over and over, and it is also great for teaching the signs for the different animals if you do baby signs.
B0010OMXKA|5.0|I only have the DVD, but it is without question the best DVD/CD/anything I have ever heard.   Andre Bocelli is a genius, his voice is brilliant, I think he is second to none, ever! The best voice on the planet and there is miles between him and second place. A huge shame he doesn't do more concerts like this.   A must to own, BRILLIANT.
1891252089|5.0|I practiced mysore in a yoga studio for 9 months, could no longer afford it and ordered \\"The Practice Manual\\" along with the videos. I never realized how important it was for me to hear my instructor/teacher/guide remind me to do things. At home, I have no one to remind me what my goals are when I enter an asana. Being able to refer to the manual when I forget or practice along with video is very helpful. The one thing I need is encouragement, and even David in the video's seems to help with that a little.
B003AO1SVS|5.0|After reading reviews about this album and knowing their hit from it, 'Tighten Up', I wanted to hear the rest of the album. Great purchase. The entire album is enjoyable from start to finish. I really enjoyed track 10 and could listen to that one song most of the afternoon. If you're a fan of true rock and roll, pick this album up.
0670022411|1.0|Where do I start?  Nowhere actually. This book is that bad. Bella Swan, Bella Swan, Bella Swan. No, actually, the heroine here is worst than Bella Swan. The writing is bad, the execution bad, the characters bad. I cant believe the hype for this 600 page of nonsense. The saddest part is there was some good research in this, but then I think the author is a history professor, so in other words she didnt really do research she just wrote down what she's been studying her whole life and wrote down way too much useless information by the way.  Here is the thing, people who have lived or visited Oxford or the places in France she talks about knows that she describes them so horribly bad, you want to fling the book across the wall. It's so easy to know reviewers who have never visited this places because they keep going on and on about how well she describes this locations. Read reviews from magazines based in England, like the Times and so on and you see how bad they smash this book.  Mary Sue. Mary Sue. Eating. Sleeping. Growling. Purple Prose. Bad Writing. More Mary Sue. This is this book for you. I am returning this book back to Barnes and Nobles. I am sorry, but when an author tries to play me by writing a grown up Twilight and her publishing company tries to play me further by marketing it as what it isnt, I show them just how evil I can be. I am done reading this and I shall return it and get my money back. So you lose author and publishing company.  Skip this book.
B003L77G2Y|4.0|I know I will take flak from fanatics for giving Fringe only 4 stars, but I have my reasons.    First off the good: Fringe is perhaps one of the best Sci-Fi serials to come down the pike in a long time. It has all the potential to become another X-Files, and all of the dangers to fail where Chris Carter did too.    Carter became to preoccupied with making his show into a propaganda platform on every conceivable issue, and the shows storyline suffered as a result; and for conservatives like myself, it was especially a turn-off.  Another mistake Carter made I see the producers of Fringe beginning to do, is focusing far too much on one character to the detriment of the others. As X-Files became the \\"All About Scully Saga\\", so too is Fringe in danger of becoming all about Olivia.  The best Sci-Fi stories make use of COMMON folk the audience can identify with, and once having established them as such; THEN putting them into nearly unbelievable circumstances.  Giving our characters super-natural powers approaching deities will only ruin the story via making suspension of disbelief impossible.    On that last point we have the utterly unbelievable circumstance where Walter, still on parole from a Mental Institution, is apparently allowed free reign to go about creating his own cocktails of illegal drugs and regularly consuming them on the show! It truly would be an alternate universe where FBI agents allowed such to take place under their noses. NO, totally unbelievable.    With those criticisms, I stand by my 4 star  rating in the hopes the Writers/Producers will improve it.
B002ZG99CC|1.0|While this is a technically sound movie, in of its own right, the use of the title, from a classic movie AND one that actually is involved with Karate is the travesty.    This movie has NOTHING to do with karate.  Several other martial arts forms are actually used.  This was another blatant attempt by Hollywood to suck in an audience because they are expected something that the movie does not offer.  I am a serious Jackie Chan fan but I feel that he has betrayed my faith in him by making this movie.  Maybe if they had given it some other name I would not be as upset about what I feel is a total lie.
B002G1YPH0|1.0|States it will work but it does not fit. I ended up just using the Intel CPU cooler that comes with the chip. Being I am not \\"pushing\\" the CPU by overclocking or increasing the CPU votage the Intel cooling fan works great. Also by utilizing the Cooler Master HAF 932 High Air Flow ATX Full Tower Case Black - (RC-932-KKN1-GP)that has MAJOR fan cooling (THAT IS QUIET AS WELL) the CPU is very happy. If I decide I need overvoltage or overclocking then I will probably go with a liquid cooled system. The case (mention above) has an external liquid filling port on the top for just such an instance as liquid cooling.
1594202842|2.0|Like many of the reviewers, I wanted to read this book after hearing numerous interviews and reading several articles. I tried to approach the book with an open mind.     While I don't think that Ms. Chua is \\"abusive,\\" her constant music drilling does seem a bit extreme to a \\"Westerner\\" like myself. I found it interesting, at the beginning, but soon found the book to drag and become quite dull. It is very repetitive, going through countless descriptions of vigorous practicing hours and lessons, to proud performances and back to more practicing.     Perhaps what bothered me the most was that she so obviously believes her parenting to be above those of \\"westerners,\\" her one daughter Lulu would be considered an embarrassment to many American parents. She is extremely rude, and obviously does not respect her mother. There are COUNTLESS episodes in the book that run along the lines of:  Chua: \\"Lulu, do this.\\"  Lulu: \\"No, I don't want to.\\"   Chua: \\"Lulu, you HAVE to do this! I'll take away all of your things! You won't get this! I'll starve you!\\"     Lulu: \\"NO I WON'T, YOU CAN'T MAKE ME.\\"    In the end, she often wins. She screams, she cries. Chua bribes her, going against her \\"Chinese mother\\" attitude. While I can understand why the child would want to rebel, she is without a doubt a brat. Seems that being a Chinese Mother doesn't always work out - other than being an incredible musician, her child is rude and disrespectful.     I wouldn't have a problem with Lulu being so disrespectful if Chua wasn't so arrogant about her parenting skills being so much better than those of \\"Westerners.\\" I do not believe Chua is a bad mother, and I think saying she is \\"abusive and evil\\" is much. Her children are probably relatively well behaved and good people, but the fact that her one daughter continued to fight her mother and be so disrespectful proves that her tactics aren't as perfect as Chua would like to think.    Other than being frustrated by their constant arguments, I simply found the book to be boring and repetitive. I do not regret reading it, as I think it is an interesting portrait of a family, but would not necessarily recommend.
B002RKRV4Y|2.0|First of all, as a classic this book should be held to a higher standard. There really is not anything in the book that is not predictable. As story, the book is rather dull. Furthermore, the language used in translation is really rather baneful. Having said that, I still kind of liked the general theme of the book.
B002RSDW80|1.0|I am glad others liked the movie better than I...I thought it was a dumb movie. Meryl Streep is a great actress, and I really like her, but I didn't like the movie.
B0034G4OXQ|1.0|I rarely write reviews for movies, but I have to say, this one was just brutal to watch. I stayed tough and made it through to the end in hopes that somehow Eastwood could find a way to tie it all together, unfortunately, that was not the case. Other than the rare glimpse of the \\"hereafter\\", there was no substance to the movie.  The character development was poor. I couldn't even find a way to like any of the three people this movie revolved around.  This is not a spiritual movie, it is not a feel good movie, I'm not even sure what you would call it, but confusing and disappointing.     I wish I didn't make the dvd purchase. I'll never watch it again.
0756404738|5.0|I loved Name of the Wind as soon as I began reading it at the suggestion of a friend. It was really my first foray into a more realistic and grounded type of fantasy and I immediately became fascinated with the world that Rothfuss had created, even though much of it hasn't been revealed yet. This trilogy is, after all, primarily focused on telling Kvothe's story first and revealing the history and status quo of the world second. I took to Kvothe as a character quickly, loving the fact that while he was a natural talent at many things, he still had a great many flaws and had much to learn. Wise Man's Fear picks right up where Name of the Wind left off and keeps the ball rolling. I have had to force myself to put it down on several occasions because I've only got a quarter of the book left to read and I want to make it last longer. For those of us that love the character and want to see how he learned all the things that made him a legend and also how he became the broken man he is in the present will eat Kvothe's further adventures up with a spoon. Don't miss out on Wise Man's Fear if you remotely enjoyed Name of the Wind. Hopefully we will have a shorter wait for Day 3 and with any luck after that we'll be lucky to see what the future holds for Kvothe!
B0036EH3WK|2.0|I am not judging the quality of the video and audio transfer. They are fine. But the show is pretty horrible so far. I will say this: I have not watched all of it yet. Just most of the first season and I really have struggles to push myself to watch further. The story has so many bad nuances in it, that it makes me think what kind of a person wrote this. Was he delusional, does he know anything about life and society. At least half of all the decisions the main characters make do not make sense (that fact that they are lost and cut off the rest of the world does not justify them). Anyway, I can see that a lot of people like this show here and will probably disagree with me. But this is my honest opinion. If I decide to watch further and somehow the show will change my mind, I will follow up. The problem is I kind of have no interest to watch it anymore.
1439102724|3.0|This book, which is more than 450 pages long, does not get even remotely interesting until about page 250.  I was so disappointed .... usually Jodi Picoult's books grab me from the first page.  This first half of the book is trite and boring.  Mary
B004JMZPJG|4.0|If you are looking for a case for just your SLR and lens, this may be the ticket.  I was able to fit my D70 with a medium zoom (28-200MM) in here with ease.  It also has a pocket under the lid that would hold several memory cards and two side pockets for other small accessories, such as a spare battery pack, lens cap, LCD protector, etc.  The side pockets are about 4\\" x 6\\" so you may even get a manual in there.  The case appears to be well made.  It is sufficiently padded to protect your camera from the usual bangs that may occur while carrying but I'm not sure your lens or mount would survive a drop undamaged.  It may but I wasn't going to test that.  The strap is one inch wide nylon, which is okay for just the weight of the camera.  I would have preferred a wider or more padded strap.  The strap is removable and the case has D-Rings so you could replace it with something better if you wish.  The case also has a top handle so you can carry it like a lunch box.  Last, it has a belt loop but I have not found those to be useful with something of this bulk.  The belt loop is sewn on so you must remove your belt to slide it through the loop.  I find that to be a nuisance but others may prefer the security.  It is a matter of personal preference.  The loops is rather large so it won't hold the case tightly to your belt.  I find that to be a poor design.    Again, for carry just the camera, lens and a few accessories, this is a decent case although I have a Tamrac case that is a lot nicer, more thickly padded and with more pockets but overall it is the same size.  I would also trust the Tamrac case better to survive a drop because it hugs the body better so the impact would be distributed over the lens and body rather than just the lens.  In fairness, the Tamrac case was almost twice the price so this case is a pretty good deal.

He and his father put the big things together, then my son breaks them down, rearranges into his own creations and goes to town.  The SW figures are his favorite and he REALLY likes this set--in fact, he paid for it himself.  It's a great set to add figures for him to play with.<br /><br />Highly recommended!<br /><br />JTG

B002ZG976U|2.0|Primarily a vehicle for Christina Aguilera, &#34;Burlesque&#34; (2010) emerges as a colorful mess awash in B-movie clich&eacute;s. Unfortunately, this musical drama lacks the classic Hollywood spark it desperately wants to recapture. Top-billed Cher has limited screen time as the club matriarch — the same goes for Stanley Tucci's stage manager. The appealing Aguilera belts out a few strong numbers, but her acting is passable at best. By comparison, Cher sings only two songs: the engaging &#34;Welcome to Burlesque&#34; and the painfully overwrought &#34;You Haven't Seen the Last of Me.&#34; Writer-director Steven Antin has no idea what he's doing and hopes something will stick. &#34;Burlesque&#34; runs an unwieldy two hours, yet would have been more effective in half the time. Blink and you will miss Alan Cumming in a poorly conceived cameo.
1556347308|5.0|First off, my experience with it:<br />I was a fan of 3d edition and initially felt a bit betrayed by the move to 4th ed.  However, I bought it, read it, then began to play it.  At first, it took some getting used to -- although much of the basic mechanics remain the same, there are enough differences to cause some occasional confusion.  But there has been a lot of original support for the new edition, all of it expanding tremendously what the game can do.<br /><br />Second, my recommendation for new players:<br />I'm assuming that anyone reading this has played another tabletop RPG at some point, most likely D&D.  I started with the first edition of AD&D.  But I came across GURPS at some point (3d edition) and found that it offered the ability to do pretty much everything I wanted to.  I wish that 4th ed. had been around then -- it's actually much more \\"universal\\" than 3d ed.  You can do pretty much anything with it.  The basic set gives you the tools.  Add some of SJ Games fine supplements and you have a tremendous amount of genre-specific support.  It's not 100% necessary, but it helps.<br /><br />Buy it.  You'll enjoy it.
B000002AS3|5.0|Yes thats right I said it the Best rock album of all time.  Better than any stones, beatles, led zepellin, ac/dc, kiss, or any other rock album of the world I listened to.  I have heard them all.  I remember hearing this album when it came out and I was mezmerized...every single track on the entire album is not only good but amazing. They clearly have great respect and fondness for the Beatles as an influence and try to emulate them and they have done more than emulate the beatles in my opinion albumwise--they have far surpassed them.  As I said I truly can not specify any particular favorites of the album because they are all gems. To say they are gems is an understatement.    In all honesty I don't even like giving Oasis props because of their extreme cockiness, arrogance, we are the best band in the world, we are better than the beatles attitude.  But their music does back it up in my opinion honestly. I mean the alcoholic gallagher brothers are obnoxious beyond compair but superb musicians...especially noel who write the majority of the songs and its nice how noel and liam more or less equally sing the tracks of the album which makes for a nice variety.      The following few albums like whats the story, be here now, and standing on the shoulder of giants were all great albums. Unforunately after standing on the shoulder of giants, they clearly went way way way down hill to eventually non existent and breakig up. Whether this was due to some of the band members leaving and bringing in new band members which played a major part or something else..who knows. But they eventually hit rock bottom and sounded like rubbish after standing ont he shoulder of giants.    I think if Noel goes solo as a musician I see him making some great music in the future, but not Liam.
1595825045|5.0|Great book, the art is the same as in the series (amazing), I'm not a good reader but I have to say that I started reading the book and I couldn't put it down, interesting facts about the show and the creators. A must have for any Avatar the last Airbender fan, I can't wait for the comics that will be release on 2012 to continue the series.
B003UESJHY|5.0|This movie was awesome, I saw it the first day it came out in theaters as I was reading the biography on Micky Ward, Irish Thunder. This movie is a very accurate portrayal of the life and dysfunctional family of the hard-working hard hitting Micky Ward. A great movie that I can relate to both Micky and Dicky Eklund in that I have had a struggle with drugs that landed me institutionalized and got off the drugs and now am participating in MMA and Boxing. Overall I would reccomend this movie to anybody and everybody who is 16 and above as there is a good amout of drug use and some sexual content. But remember this movie is Very true to the life of Micky Ward and his family. 5 Stars! Pick this one up you will feel inspired!
B0000000LI|4.0|The Acropolis in Athens, Greece is perhaps the most exotic and special location for Yanni and his music to be performed for a large audience. His special, \\"Live at the Acropolis,\\" is a favorite on PBS during pledge drives.     The music is crisp, clear, and nearly perfect. One exception is that you wouldn't know it was performed if it wasn't for the audience clapping at the end of each song. Without the audience, this compact disc sounds as if it was recorded in a studio.    Regardless, Yanni and his band perform one of the most memorable nights of his career. His music is great to listen too for yoga and pilates classes as well as a stress reliever from a long day at work. You can listen to Yanni's music anywhere without complaint whether your car or your office.
B001LRJH0K|5.0|The story opens with the sheriff and two of his deputies from Appaloosa riding out to Randall Bragg's ranch to arrest one of Bragg's men.  The sheriff tells Bragg what he is there for and Bragg tells the sheriff he cannot afford to be short any of his men.  Bragg pulls up his rifle and shoots the sheriff and both deputies.  Bragg really has employer loyalty.    The town council now wants Appaloosa cleaned up so they call on two lawmen for hire: Virgil Cole, hot tempered Civil War vet who kills with ease, and Everett Hitch, West Point trained, smooth, educated, leader, always carrying an 8-gauge double-barreled shotgun.  Hitch knows how to use it and kills often, but legally. These men complement each other and keep each other alive.    Randall Bragg wants to take over the region's copper mines. His men terrorize the small town's residents, making their own rules and disrupting business, often with a lethal effect.  It's 1882 when Virgil Cole and Everett Hitch ride into Appaloosa to the near-empty streets. The deal they make with the town council is that they make the laws and enforce them their way.   So, Cole and Hitch are hired, and are given power to impose order, by whatever means necessary and they do.    The one problem is Allison French, a lady of questionable virtue that turns Virgil's head.  She also makes a play for Everett, but because of his friendship for Virgil he refutes her. The story plays out with Virgil's obsession to catch Bragg, a kidnapping, ransom, tracking, Indians, betrayal, a great gun fight and a killing for a friend.    This is a very realistic western; it has the feel of an old west town, not over dressed, not too many people.  Appaloosa is great in Blue-ray.
B004BBDHEK|5.0|Yanni has produced ANOTHER great CD.  He music gets better each time, he still has Nathan, Leslie and Chloe on a few of the songs.  This is just a fantastic CD.
6304698623|5.0|I'm in my 20s and it amazes me how much I still love this movie!  It's a sham they don't make movies like this anymore.  I identify with Sara so much, from spending time in India as a child to having a close relationship with my father.<br /><br />This movie is based off the 1905 British novel of the same name but that's all the two have in common.  I haven't read the book but I know enough to know the movie stands on its own.  The story begins in 1914, the beginning of WWI in British India.  Sara Crewe, the daughter of the wealthy Captain Crewe live there until the war begins and Sara's father enrolls her in the prestigious academy her late mother attended in NYC.  The school is headed by the evil Miss Minchin who is clearly jealous of Sara's relationship with her father.  Sara quickly becomes the most popular student and even makes friends with Becky, the servant girl.  Sara brings joy to everyone she comes across with her imagination and belief that all girls are princesses instilled by her father.  Sara's optimism is tested when she learns her father is killed in battle and the British government controls his assets, leaving Sara penniless and forced to become a servant.<br /><br />The symbolism and imagery is amazing in this movie.  I love how Sara's telling of the ancient story of the divine Hindu couple Rama and Sita is juxtaposed with the fate of Sara's father and the development of the story.<br /><br />This movie is a children's movie but people of all ages will love it.  Liesel Matthews shines as Sara, you almost forget she's acting.  The other major roles such as Miss Minchin, Captain Crewe and Becky are played well also.<br /><br />If you've read the book don't watch this movie expecting it to tell the same story.  This is a story all unto itself.
B004NS710C|5.0|The cast was right on the money for this movie, from Ethan Suplee as the incompetant \\"Dewey\\" which he played well, to Rosario Dawson, who has managed to bring a sense of power to her role as a woman placed in charge of a train yard. She doesn't pander to typical stereotypes, folding under a man's decision, but rather brings with her a great deal of intelligence, morality, and character, constantly going for a real solution, inspite of her superiors being completely closed-minded, and uninformed about their actions.<br /><br />Denzel Washington (Frank), and Chris Pine (Will) were the stars in this thrill ride of a movie. Once things get going, they put everything on the line, including their own lives, to save not only a train, but would-be thousands of lives in the process. Will ends up injuring his leg during their attempt, and Frank braves running along the top of a train traveling 70-80 miles an hour.<br /><br />You might think to yourself that this seems like an unlikely scenario, but however unlikely it may be, it could potentially happen, and I think the movie captured the idea and was able to inform people just how dangerous something like this could be. One simple mistake leads to a huge train speeding along at unthinkable speeds, with enough kinetic energy to destroy almost anything in it's way, and enough toxic substances to kill many thousands of people.<br /><br />The pace of the movie started just right, slowly moving along until it hits a geometric curve and moves right into full speed ahead. It is like slamming against the back of your seat as your plane takes off.<br /><br />All in all I found this to be a great movie, with inspired acting and a great cast.
1594202842|3.0|In Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother, Amy Chua claims that her methods of \\"Chinese parenting\\" are more effective than those of \\"Western parenting.\\" The problem here is that her description of the typical Chinese mother is not so typical. She describes immigrant Chinese parents as being tough and driven to raising successful children. However, this is certainly not true of all Chinese parents and she fails to mention that her methods for raising children are just that. They are HER methods, not the Chinese methods. Also, Chua describes Western parents as being too lax with their parenting and says that they encourage their children to do whatever they want to do no matter what it is. Although this is probably true of some Western parents, it is also very stereotypical. I know that my parents have forced me to do plenty of things that I don't like and so have many other parents in America. The other thing that bothered me about the book was Chua's constant assertion that she is immigrant Chinese. However, she was born in America, raised in America, and lives in America now. She takes the description of herself as a Chinese mother a little too far in that respect.    With that said, Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother is a very enjoyable book. Chua's writing is readable and easy to follow. I honestly believe that someone could read this book in one day. I thoroughly enjoyed her little anecdotes and stories about raising her children. Her intense parenting style is actually humorous in most parts of the book and I loved when she included dialogues between herself and her daughters. Chua began the book with a very serious tone but ended it with a more understanding tone. I definitely would encourage parents to read this book for an amusing and enjoyable read. Overall, reading the book was entertaining despite the constant stereotyping.
0440238609|5.0|All you children around the campfire listen well, for I shall tell you a story about the dark days before the emergence of Harry Potter. These were hard times for young folk who chased magic and science through stories. But there was one beacon of light in this darkness, one safe haven. It was called \\"His Dark Materials.\\"    An adventure of legendary proportions, taken on by children not much older than yourselves-though one was from another world than our own. Two children, older than their years (though not at all wiser) driven together by chance or destiny and given an impossible task. Save the universes-all of them.     Our heroes had help of course, as all heroes must. Tools to shows the way and aid them in their quest. Loyal friends to guard them and fight their enemies. New allies who add their own skills to this great fight.     But even with all their tools, their friends, their allies-these children were very much on their own. Traveling through fantastic lands and facing down danger they attempt to discover what they should do next, all the while unknowing the key to their great task is so much closer than they think it is.     In the beginning, there was dark. Out of that darkness came a light.     This is a wonderfully, wonderfully written trilogy which straddles the generation gap perfectly. An adult will get just as much enjoyment out of this as a young adult would. I read trilogy for the first time ten years ago back when I was a young adult and I enjoyed it just as much the second time around. Maybe more so because the theology, philosophy and science of the book is easier to follow with a little higher education.     Before Harry Potter there was this. And it was, is, and always will be one of the most amazing works of science fiction/fantasy ever written.     Five stars.
0812550706|5.0|\\"Ender's Game\\" was one of the classic science fiction books that I never had the chance to read when it first came out.<br /><br />Orson Scott Card does a brilliant job of introducing an engaging universe with some fascinating characters.  (The fact that there is so much Fan Fiction surrounding Card's imagined universe is an indicator of how well he created.)  Card does a first-rate job of developing Ender Wiggins.  It is clear from the novel that Card raised a son.  Ender's actions in the book truly capture what one might expect out of a five or six year old super-genius.<br /><br />Careful, beyond this point there lie spoilers ...<br /><br />The story takes place in the not-so-distant future when a race of intelligent insectoid creatures attack the Earth not once, but twice.  The I.F. is looking for kids to raise into super-commanders through tough training at a place called Battle School, kind of like West Point on steroids.  The Wiggins family has given birth to two super genii, Val and Peter, but mom and dad Wiggins want a \\"third\\" child.  At this point, religions are illegal, but Mr. and Mrs. Wiggin were Roman Catholic and Latter Day Saints, and both felt a strong desire to have more children.  The I.F. agreed to allow the Wiggins to have more children if and only if the Wiggins agreed to put their children through screening for Battle School.<br /><br />The first child, Peter, was too sadistic and down-right eeeeevil.  The second child, Val, was too much of a wimp.  But, like Goldilocks, the third child, Andrew or Ender, was juuuust right.<br /><br />The book tracks two parallel stories.  The principal plot follows Ender through his trials and tribulations before and through Battle School.  The secondary plot follows Ender's rejected brother and sister as they use the mass media \\"Nets\\" and assumed identities to create political movements with global reach and impact.  This is all orchestrated by Peter.<br /><br />Ender ends up being a ruthlessly efficient military commander.  No matter what troubles either professional or personal that the Battle School staff throws at him, Ender Wiggins prevails.  The ruthlessness is key.  Even before Battle School Ender kills a bully (although the truth is kept from Ender), and during the Battle School the same scenario is repeated with similar results.<br /><br />One of the heroes of the Battle School is the victorious commander from the second Bugger War, Mazar.  About two-thirds of the way through \\"Ender's Game,\\" Ender is introduced to a tough, personal trainer who puts Ender through hell.  The trainer is dum-dum-dum Mazer.  (Yes, that was fairly well telegraphed in the book too.)<br /><br />Ender and his specially trained cadre of kids are invited to participate in a special game that starts at a low-level and works into a simulated attack on the Buggers home world.<br /><br />The big surprise at the end of the book is that the game was real.  Ender and his cadre were actually sending messages in real-time to the fleets that had been sent out 40 years earlier to attack the Buggers.<br /><br />Ender is sent off to be the first governor of the new Earth colonies, mostly settled on the old Bugger worlds.<br /><br />Peter ends up conquering the Earth and ending war.<br /><br />The end.<br /><br />Unlike the Sixth Sense where you truly might not have figured out the protagonist was already dead, most readers will quickly figure out that Ender is not just playing a game.<br /><br />It is not too much of a stretch that Ender might not, because he is a six year old, trusting kid.<br /><br />The writing campaign orchestrated by Peter and Val does stretch the limits of suspension of disbelief beyond the breaking point.  There are just too many ways that something as monstrously complicated as Peter's and Val's plots would have been breached, and in the book there are several organizations that figure out who the two writers really are.<br /><br />One big question is what the Dickens were theWiggins parents doing throughout this period?<br /><br />There were several wrap-ups at the end of the book that did not sit quite right.  Ender had this tremendous guilt about killing the Buggers.  Whether their motives were misunderstood or not, the Buggers attacked Earth twice.  Not once.  Twice.  The whole Xenocide angle seems odd and improbable given the Buggers scowering of China during the first Bugger war.  As a combat veteran with a strong moral side, I had a hard time relating to Ender on this score.  Additionally, Ender did not even know that he was killing the Buggers.  Also, there was some padding at the end that the Hive Queens allowed themselves to be killed out of their own guilt even though they fought Ender in brutal fights that killed many of the I.F. ships and crews, and the Queens adapted their strategy to try and defeat the I.F. fleets they fought.  So, that point was muddled at best.<br /><br />Despite a few quibbles, overall, \\"Enders Game\\" was a very good read and justly deserved the awards that were bestowed upon it.<br /><br />If you have not read this book yet, I highly recommend it!<br /><br />In service,<br /><br />Rich<br />[...]t about killing the Buggers.

160059672X|5.0|After spending time with this book I am even more in awe of Sherry's bead embroidery.  Her pieces while elaborate, are wearable and the coloration she chooses appears effortless as each of the bead choices flow seamlessly into an overall pleasing design.  The various shapes she employs such as the wonderful edges on the cover cuff create visual interest.  The photographs in this book are all beautifully done and capture not only the projects which are spelled out in detail, but also many of Sherry's larger pieces for added inspiration.  I can't wait to begin the process of making some of these exquisite pieces!  Thanks Sherry for sharing your amazing talent!

B000M2O6AQ|1.0|I must have received a different movie than everyone else.  The plot clunks along at a slow an awkward pace.  This movie takes the ancient Chinese idea of qi, buddhist teachings and add the glow of someone exposed to nuclear waste and expects it to make a powerful movie.  It really doesn't work: bad story, bad acting, bad editing, bad movie.  While some of the ideas they are trying to force feed you have merit, the presentation is painful and annoying.  As someone who didn't read the book this movie is a must miss.
B0040JHLC2|5.0|Love them!  Owned a pair of GTS 9, ran, ran and ran till they wore out.  I had problems running until I finally got a new pair GTS 11.  I have a high instep and have a tough time finding sneakers.  These (14E) fit me so good and make me feel fantastic.  No Pain either!  Price was exactly what the local stores had to offer but the key was Amazon had my size in stock, 2 days later I was off running.  Thanks!
B001HPP2XW|4.0|Saw this movie many years ago.  Wanted to see it again and have a copy for my dvd library.  Was very pleased with the quality of the picture/sound in this \\"mastered in high definition\\" centennial collection dvd. Really enjoyed Audrey Hepburn's performance as the quirky, kookey (on the surface) Holly Golightly and the quality of the dvd contributed to the enjoyment.
0316096199|3.0|What happened to Alice Sebold should not happen to ANYONE!!! I am glad she is alive and well, however this book (I didnt read the whole thing) was a bore to me. I kept pushing myself to try to finish, but only ended up about halfway. The beginning was terrifying I will admit and very sad, and she is very \\"LUCKY\\". She is also the author of lovely bones which I couldn't put down for anything, so I figured her memoir would be even better, but again it was a bore. Her mothers anxiety attacks drove me nuts, and her father's attitude of tuning things out and believing he was better than everyone else again drove me crazy. Im sure if I kept reading eventually I would get to the main points of the book which is her being raped. I dont take pleasure in anyones pain but the book so far until the point I read seem to be all over the place except on the main subject of what it should have....but again I didn't read the whole entire book. Maybe later in the future I will finish where I started off and revise this review.
159420229X|3.0|After reading the first chapter of this book online, I went out and picked up a copy and read it.  I was under the impression from reading that first chapter that this book would be about Joshua's year of training his memory.  There is a large gap between knowing about a memory technique and how to actually use that technique.  I was interested in reading about the author's efforts, problems, and his solutions to those problems.  Unfortunately for me, only a small part of this book actually was about the author's actual training.  He does cover a good deal of academic ground on memory.  If you have a undergarduate degree in psychology, most of this material will be familiar.  The author is correct when he said that this book isn't a self-help book, but there are a few pearls within its cover. My expectations for this book resulted in my being disappointed with it.  That's my problem.  I do consider the book to be a good read and would recommend it to friends and associates.
B003Y5H54W|1.0|In 1984, director Neil Jordan directed The Company of Wolves, an adult take on the classic fairy tale, Little Red Riding Hood. The film was released to critical raves and became a cult classic. Art-house audiences around the world embraced this metaphorical fantasy of sexual awakening, which was also an effective horror film, featuring an extremely creepy performance from Angela Lansbury as The Grandmother. Sarah Patterson was breathtaking in the lead role as Rosaleen, also known as Red Riding Hood. Her performance was subtle and utterly convincing. These wonderful performances against the ethereal setting and rich symbolism of Neil Jordan's script made for an intellectually stimulating, albeit horrifying and, dare I say it, fun time at the cinema. It is now 2011, and modern audiences are not as lucky. No, they have Red Riding Hood, Catherine Hardwicke's latest Twilight rip-off.    Everything about Red Riding Hood screams Twilight from the dizzying opening credits onward. The setting is a bit different, and there are a few awkward references to familiar elements of the fairy tale, but make no mistake - this is as formulaic a film as you are ever going to see this year. It concerns a teenage girl named Valerie, played by Amanda Seyfried, who is in love with a boy. This does not matter to her mother - played by Virginia Madsen, in a thankless role - who insists that her daughter marry the richest boy in the village, in hopes that the young girl will lead a privileged life.  Ladies and gentlemen, may I introduce Peter and Henry, the first cousins of Jacob and Edward. Poor Peter decides that he will run away with Valerie regardless of her mother's wishes, but his plans are thwarted as a result of the man-eating wolf that keeps terrorizing the small town. Added to that, Rich Boy Henry keeps popping into the picture, trying to win over the young girl's heart. As per usual in this particular type of situation, she becomes torn between the two men - and then one dark night,the wolf appears to her and begins to speak. You read that correctly. Wolfie informs her that he will come to collect her in a matter of days, and that she had better be prepared. Of course, Valerie is freaked out, and her peers begin to doubt her sanity. As she begins to count down the minutes before Wolfie's inevitable return, she confides in her two boy toys for help. Meanwhile, the village idiot recruits a creepy Gary Oldman - who is some sort of lycanthropy expert - to ward off the werewolf with the aid of his silver fingernails and an unnecessarily large metal elephant. If it sounds pathetic, that's because it is. In case you are wondering, there is a Grandmother character, compliments of Julie Christie. She is the only interesting character in the entire film, the only reason being that her performance borders on extreme camp.  By the time the third act of the film rolls around, you will have guessed who the Wolfie is, and you will not be surprised. You just may roll your eyes in disgust as I did.    Catherine Hardwicke is a capable director when she has a good script to work with. Anyone who has seen Thirteen or The Nativity Story knows this. However, she is also a sucker for angst-ridden, teeny-bopper soap operas, hence her involvement in this film. Neil Jordan's The Company of Wolves is obviously the better film, and one that I highly recommend. If you are smart, you will add that film to your Netflix queue, and skip Red Riding Hood altogether.    The performances are uniformly terrible, and there are absolutely no redeeming qualities to be found here.
B00361DR4Q|4.0|A very high quality recording with beautiful sets and lavish costuming. Performances by the principals are generally well done. And even the chorus is superb in their timing, volume and tone. The duets are touching and very well done. Two minor annoyances...Vargas is not a handsome man and does not project the on-screen image required for the role. Gheorghiu performance is wonderful throughout except for the final death scene where she plays it comically, rather than tragic. All in all, a very entertaining production.
B004GJT43K|5.0|Recently listeners are treated with a good number of 'all-star' recordings.<br />I approach this 'Ercole', revived by Fabio Biondi, with some trepidation.<br />Luckily, my worries prove totally unfounded.<br />This is a 'all-star' recording that lives up to the very fames of all its performers.<br />At the hem of the performance is of course the starry Biondi himself.<br />He casts his singers in appropriate roles, and each performer lives up to his or her just fame.<br />My initial worry of Villazon singing Vivaldi vanishes upon listening to his second aria.<br />The other tenor sings a relatively minor role, and has a distinctively different vocal colour<br />than Villazon, thanks to Biondi's clever casting.<br />The ladies, however, are the real gems of this recording.<br />The Amazon queen is Genaux, who gives a characterful portrayal of a queen, a mother, and a<br />warrior all in one.  Genaux has a powerful low register, a wonderful coloratura and a very expressive<br />voice.  The varied demands for power, tenderness or feminity are all taken with aplomb. Rightfully,<br />this major female role's crown is truly worthy.<br />In the second female roles, Didonato and Damrau both give their characters' due.<br />Didonato's wonderful voice proves over and over again a real treat to listeners' ears. Probably the<br />most beautiful voice to emerge in the 21st century.<br />on the other hand, as the Amazon princess, the coyness and youthfulness depicted by Damrau are both<br />vivid and outstanding.  Again, the credit goes to Biondi as much as to the singer herself over this<br />clever choice.<br />On the supporting level, Ciofi and Jaroussky display their usual strength in this kind of repertoire.<br />The only trouser role of Basso proves equally outstanding as her 'partner' Didonato.<br />In short, there is absolutely no weak link in this performance.<br />The orchestra plays heavenly well, and the dual CDs slide through the player as if they finish off<br />in less than an hour.<br />Highly enjoyable.
B000JMKNJ2|5.0|I honestly enjoyed this book and was very surprised at the mixed reviews. Personally, I disagreed with almost all the negative comments and refuting them was my objective in writing this.     Simply put, I liked this book and if you try the sample, you will too.

B001NLKWLW|5.0|After reading The Forgotten Garden, I found and read both of Morton's other books.  This one was my favorite of the three, but I enjoyed them all.  Morton's books each contain a secret and I found I couldn't put them down until I found out what the secret was.  Now I am looking for other books that do the same thing as she has wetted my appetite for this type of book.  It's not a mystery, so that genre won't do it.  She just baits you at the beginning with a situation that can't be resolved until the very end and always surprisingly so.  I highly recommend her books, particulary this one and The Distant Hours.  Enjoy!

B0042U94UQ|5.0|[[ASIN:B0042U94UQ Despicable Me (Single-Disc Edition)]]  One reviewer had the nerve to say that this film has no humanity.(spoiler alert!)- Gru's lifelong quest was to have the moon, in the end,  he accomplishes this -yet trades it for three orphan girls, no humanity there! The whole movie is really the story of the gradual stripping  away of his villainous exterior to reveal his soft center and bonding with his new daughters. This is very well done!     This movie has heart! I love all of the characters! I think it's portrayal of the orphan girls life struck just the right note. It put me on   their side from the get go and kept me there for the whole ride. By not showing the home for girls as the best of environments it makes you   root for them- what is hard to understand about that? Unintended consequences; -I seem to watch this movie over and over, I want to adopt some too!     While I work on that, I see that a sequel is in the works and I will be first in line for that. Who knows; Maybe this movie it will even advance the   idea that men have feelings and make great parents. PS- There are also two new short features about Gru's minions in the works too! Nothing makes me   happier than to have another of those rare movies I want to watch again and again. We should support new animation companies, animation is great art  and we need more choices!

B004IJZFP4|4.0|Having lived, breathed, obsessed, admired, loved and promoted the original version of this album since it's initial release in 1975, I was excited and thrilled to learn of this release. Teaser (the orig.) is like an old friend to me. I know every note, every lyric, every vocal inflection, every musical nuance...and they all are as welcome and familar as that old friend...but...this recording, while close...ain't ever gonna be that. There are too many changes that are unsettling to me...while it's Bolin and as far as I'm concerned, he could fart with the least bit of sincerity and I'd like it...to take a masterpiece and alter it is almost sacrilegious. It's like putting drool at the corner of Mona Lisa's smile. Gone is the flowing jazzy guitar and vocals on Savannah Woman, the wonderful smoothness of Dreamer with it's Elton-ish piano intro, and everything else that made Teaser the extraordinary album it is. Am I glad to have this release? Yes...is it what I'd hoped it would be? No. What I wish they'd done is remaster...not remix...the original to bring the volume up and clarify the instruments and vocals, then release this somewhat bastardization of a release as a bonus disc...now that would indeed be DELUXE! I give it 4 stars because it is Tommy Bolin after all...and it's far far far superior to a sincere fart.
B000007UEY|2.0|Let me start by saying that I am a huge genesis fan and I was really looking forward to hearing this, that being said I found this cd to be mediocre at best and plain bad at worst. The writing was uninspired and the singer was average. To be perfctly honest Im a little suprised by all the glowing reviews, someone put this on there top three albums of all time list! I tried to like this but I just couldnt get into this album.

B00006LJ6X|4.0|Its amazing to me how under appreciated this band really is. Of all the books Ive read on music its crazy what little mention this band recieves (if any mention at all). This album further proves there abilty to to mix different styles of music almost flawlessly creating a unique fresh sound that is so hard to come by nowadays. Each member of the band handles there parts exceptionally and although this is a long album I was rarely ever bored. Chicago has delivered some of the most enduring pop rock of all time! They may not get critical praise, but there still the seconed most succesful american band ever! the people have spoken.
0756404738|3.0|I found most of WMF enjoyable, and I recommend it, but overall I was disappointed.    Let me start off with the pre-req I-loved-NOTW-paragraph.  I really did.  NOTW was a found treasure.  Pure entertainment.  The story was fresh, Kvothe was original, likeable, and someone you'd really root for.  The writing was fantastic (if I could write one paragraph even half as well as Patrick Rothfuss can write an entire book, hell, I'd frame it and stick it on my wall, print in on a T- shirt, and when I died, I'd put it on my tombstone).    WMF had all the brilliant writing of NOTW, but the storyline was weaker, especially in the second half.  Reminiscent of the draccus section in NOTW, there were too many pages where nothing seemed to happen, particularly when Kvothe hunts the bandits, when he trained in Ademere, and when he spent time with Felurian.  It's as though I was reading a journal instead of a story.  I don't need every day's weather, every conversation with the mercenaries, every day's training or test, or every sexual encounter, just the entertaining ones, or the ones relevant to the story.  And that might have taken 200 pages out of the book.    Plus I didn't like Kvothe as much anymore.  Towards the end of the book, instead of his adventures and training making him more disciplined and thoughtful, he had become a bit tactless and kind of a jerk. First the whole Casanova routine after leaving the Fae, having a go with every woman he meets thereafter.  He has the free sex mindset of a college freshman, and he should already be past that stage in whatever character development arc he's on.  And, after telling us the importance of being in the Maer's good favor, he suggests the Maer wait an hour because he hadn't bathed on his return from the Adem?  I get the whole irreverent Kvothe thing, but if the head of my company called me to his office, I would never say \\"give me an hour\\".  That's just stupid.  And when I met with him, I wouldn't lose my cool and insult his wife.  Really stupid.  Was that just a way to force Kvothe's story back to the University and on to the next adventure?    The Denna storyline, while apparently important with the much-discussed potential Chandrian connection, NEVER seems to move an inch forward.  Their \\"visits\\" always leave him frustrated, or they actually fight and he's just depressed.  By the end of WMF, Kvothe is supposedly more worldly, more astute, and more confident, but in their subsequent encounters NOTHING changes.  How can they spend hours, even days together as old friends and still be so awkward?  I'm not even sure she's likeable.    These are just one guy's humble, flawed opinions.  Sorry for my cynicism.  Patrick Rothfuss isn't just an incredibly talented author, he sounds like a really great guy.  This is a great book, but it could have been an AWESOME book.  And if any of these criticisms are commonly shared, shame on the beta-readers who dropped the ball and didn't show enough tough love in their feedback.    I will still buy book three, the moment it's released.
B0011NVC98|1.0|I try to keep an open mind about things.  Really I do.  But this cynical piece of crap really gets to me.  To be clear, I thought this movie was complete garbage.  All the high production values, big name actors, etc., cannot compensate for a dumb story.  And story was exactly the problem with this twisted pile of animated wreckage.  Luckily, the mighty poem of Beowulf, which is similarly named to this movie but otherwise bears no resemblance to it, will probably survive another 1000 years, whereas in just a generation or two this celluloid cesspool will be mercifully forgotten about.<br /><br />A couple of thoughts.  Many people comment on negative reviews of this movie saying \\"but movies are a different medium from poems!  We shouldn't expect the movie to be the same as the poem\\".  That is true.  I don't expect that.  I expect a movie to be GOOD.  This one isn't.  I just know why that is, and the fact that the filmmakers called their movie \\"beowulf\\" immediately lends itself to comparison with the infinitely better poem.  That's their fault, not mine.  Another complaint:  \\"we shouldn't compare this modern movie to the ancient poem, they're from different eras and times\\".  To which I say, then don't call the damn thing \\"Beowulf\\".  Call it something else, like \\"that movie where this obnoxious braggart sleeps with a demon with high heeled feet and finds out that wasn't such a good idea\\".<br /><br />Here's an idea, let's say they make a movie \\"based on the poem Beowulf\\", then, let's completely change the characters, setting, plot, narrative, mood, and theme of the poem, so we can \\"modernize it\\"!  Poof!  We now have a \\"new and improved Beowulf\\"!  Then the thing flops in the theaters and everyone wonders why.  Gee whiz.<br /><br />Now let's make some comparisons.  If we're going to accept Beowulf as a character (historical or not, doesn't matter), Beowulf the Geat (to differentiate him from the guy in the film, who I will henceforth call Beowulf the Idiot) is an admirable ideal, strong and loyal.  He is \\"boastful\\" but not in the modern sense of the word--in the poem he always qualifies his vows of heroism with the possibility that he will die.  That's not a boast, that's a promise, and he can back it up.  Beowulf the Idiot, however, makes crap up, lies, cheats and otherwise toots his own horn, is greedy, and will do anything for fame, even if it's incredibly stupid.  Beowulf the Geat is never greedy, rather the opposite.  He is generous with treasures, and he refuses to take kingship of Geatland--even when offered to him--until the legal heirs have died.  He does seek fame, but that's because fame is the only thing lasting in the life of a Germanic hero like Beowulf.  Fame through noble and brave deeds.  He seeks the glory for courageous action and wise conduct.  Beowulf the Idiot, however, is a \\"flawed man\\"--nice excuse for bad behavior.  Well, that's nice, he's flawed, we're all flawed, lets just wallow in our own imperfection.  I guess that's the moral of the movie:  \\"We suck.\\"  Perhaps we don't have enough movies out there with this moral, so we need another one.  I dunno.<br /><br />Beowulf the Geat, however, isn't perfect anyway (that's not the point of a poem like this), despite frequent complaints (as if mythic characters, like say Jesus, aren't *allowed* to be perfect--says who?  Why the hell not?).  He often makes predictions that aren't correct.  He predicts that either he will die or Grendel will, but the battle ends in Grendel living but running off severely wounded.  He predicts he will kill Grendel's mother with Hrunting or die--but Hrunting fails and he has to find a giant's weapon.  He predicts he will kill the dragon or die, but they both die.  He's wrong every time.<br /><br />The mood of the poem is dark because we know that Beowulf, even as B.A. as he is, cannot escape his doom--to place the cause of this doom on Beowulf himself (like what happens to Beowulf the Idiot) is a nice modern sentiment that \\"well, we're flawed humans, and it's our fault when things go bad\\".  Boo hoo.  Beowulf the Geat, however, is a peerless warrior and king, and yet he is still faced with an insurmountable foe, through NO fault of his own.  And you know what?  THAT'S LIFE.  That's right, no matter how good and awesome you are, sometimes life gives you an impossible situation.  The point of his death is that Beowulf the Geat accepts this and faces it like a man.  His consolation is to be able to look upon the treasure of the hoard as his reward, and the fact that his name will live on.  He loses everything else--his kingdom, his famed hall, and his life.  This isn't greed or pride.  The gold is about kinship and loyalty between companions (constantly given back and forth in the poem), and the fame is his way of achieving a kind of immortality from his barrow by the sea.  Beowulf the Idiot, on the other hand, just dies as yet another poor schmuck who screwed himself over.  Waaah.<br /><br />So, even if they hadn't opened themselves up to criticism by naming their movie \\"Beowulf\\", the movie still would have only been of passing interest in the further development of ever more technologically competent movie making, which I don't dispute.  Perhaps next time they won't use it in service of mangling up a great story that is just fine the way it is.  They should take a page from Peter Jackson's methods with his treatment of Lord of the Rings (yes he made some minor changes, but he kept within the spirit of the books).lt when things go bad\\".

0061001783|5.0|Most Georgette Heyer books are treats I devour quickly - happily knowing exactly what will happen in the end. With Cotillion I had just as much of a treat, but it unfolded unexpectedly and delightfully. I closed the book with a smile on my face and in my heart. Highly recommended!
0307454541|5.0|There is a immense amount of hype for the Girl With the Dragon Tattoo novel. I finally caved and started to read the novel when I heard there would be an American remake by the amazing David Fincher.<br /><br />From the very beginning of the novel the dragons teeth had hooked themselves onto me. The mixture of corporate corruption, journalism, and so much more depth than I anticipated did not allow me to put this intricate story down. 54 pages into the novel and I was already recommending it to my co-workers! I just couldn't see how the remaining 536 pages wouldn't be up to par.<br /><br />The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (who's name is Lisbeth Salander) is not introduced immediately which builds your enthusiasm to see where this character fits into the story already building.<br /><br />Once the novel is in full swing I guarantee you will not be able to put it down. There is a great deal of dialogue between characters which leads into a full investigation with a whirlwind of an ending. After completing the novel I completely understand why David Fincher was chosen to direct the re-make.<br /><br />If you cannot handle reading details of rape, murder, and dark details concerning pieces of the bible do not read this book. I rarely read anything on any of those subjects listed before this sentence and am glad I gave this novel a chance.
0316067601|5.0|This is a very good book.  It takes you down the road of Marcus becoming a Seal.  What these people go through to defend and protect their country is amazing to say the least.  The war that we see on TV? We don't know what these people really do for our safety.  His telling of his story is great.  It is sad how many have to die out there.
1591843790|5.0|Guy Kawasaki is one of my favorite business book authors because he knows how to inspire and educate with wit and charm. As a native Californian born and raised in the Silicon Valley, I appreciate people who provide no-nonsense tips to aspiring entrepreneurs, impresarios and innovators, both public and private. Guy's newest book \\"Enchantment\\" distills all the hard-won lessons that he's learned into a handy how-to manual, complete with personal stories to reinforce his tips with real flesh-and-blood experiences.    For those who haven't read Guy's previous books, definitely get copies of \\"The Art of the Start\\" and \\"Reality Check\\", which are great primers for his latest book. Although some of the material is repeated, his advice cannot be repeated enough because so much is at stake -- the reputations, trust and careers of your friends and colleagues -- when you build new ventures, build organizations or pursue your dreams.    What I enjoyed most were his tips for achieving likability and trustworthiness. The section on \\"Be a Mensch\\" says it all since, for Guy, being a decent person is more important than being famous or rich. My kudos to him for that in this age of financial meltdowns. In Silicon Valleys, managers and venture capitalists all look for talented, driven people with integrity.     If you're trying to use social media to promote your cause or company, Guy's tips on push and pull technologies alone are worth the price of the book. And as a Japanophile, I love Garr Reynolds' list of ten Japanese aesthetic principles.    Disclaimer: Guy wrote a forward to my upcoming book \\"In the Valley of Digital Dreams\\" about my 30 years of professional experiences in Silicon Valley, but even if he didn't I would still encourage you to buy \\"Enchantment\\" and his other books. Guy has a wonderful way of inspiring people and cutting through the \\"bull shiitake.\\" With our world seriously short of jobs, we desperately need more entrepreneurs with the vision, integrity and drive that he advocates. Guy is not just talking about making money, but making meaning and making our world a whole better place for all of us. For that, I'm totally enchanted.

B0041T52S6|5.0|Scott Pilgrim Vs The World has it all: It's got romance, comedy, action, and parodies of video games that came and went.<br /><br />At first, I felt like the movie was going kinda off due to how Scott transitioned into another thing he partakes in. I assume it meant how the day was passing by.<br /><br />But the movie was already off to such a great start. You have already heard several humorous jokes, and you've also heard some nods to games like Zelda.<br /><br />Once Scott has been with Romona Flowers, though, that's where the movie seriously picks up! It turns out that she had dated seven evil boyfriends in the past, all of which made of the League of Evil Exes. Yeah, I see you chuckling at your computer. Don't hide it.<br /><br />The action scenes where Scott fights them are both funny and cool. You just wonder how the effects were done throughout the movie. They make it look like a live-action video game. Even when Scott defeats one of the Exes, he (The ex) turns into coins and then the screen says \\"2000\\" points, or whatever number is used.<br /><br />While the action scenes are thrilling, the comedy will keep you laughing for as long as you live. For example, in a scene where Scott finds out that his ex-girlfriend, Knives, is dating his friend, Neil, his head shows a meter that shows what he should say at the moment. It pointed between a compliment and \\"I gotta pee\\". The result made Scott say, \\"I gotta pee on her\\"! Gross? I guess, but it's so random that it's funny.<br /><br />The romance scenes actually kinda speak to the audience in a way in which it tells how hard it may be to either break up with somebody or not. You might not know what to do if you run into that kind of situation.<br /><br />The game parodies range from minor to brief. There is this one scene where Scott plays a ninja version of Dance Dance Revolution with Knives. He tells her how Pac-Man was originally going to be called Puck-Man, and why that was changed. Also, I still can't get over how amazing the effects are. They help add to the parodies at times, including the deaths of the Exes. There are also some sound effects that come from certain games people will recognize, such as the ring sound from the Sonic series, and when you get an item in Zelda: A Link to the Past.<br /><br />All in all, Scott Pilgrim Vs The World helped the comic book series become reimagined into a live-action thrill that appeals to almost everybody.ies at times, including the deaths of the Exes.

B003YCI1PM|4.0|first im gonna say im an older Fan of selena Gomez.  I wanted to get this album for some time and finally came across it recenty. its nothing special but it is an upbeat album and makes you want to sing and dance which is what her music is meant to do.  i have not heard her music before this but its targeted towards teen and tweens of course but the songs are more mature and they are about all things people and of course teens go through like love and break ups and having fun. the lyrics like i said are mature as i heard her music for this album would be more than just bubble gum pop that she has done before. selena gomez is a good singer, she does not write her own songs at least for this album it is called selena and the scene after all which is the name of her band that she plays with.  all in all i found it to be good music to make you feel better and you can tell of some ones pain if you listen to the lyrics which is what all people should do not just the music when you hear a song. one more thing selena is another disney star that put out an album and its Good if you wanna have some fun.

1400052173|4.0|Ninety percent of this book is so well-written and engrossing that I could not put it down.  As pointed out by one reviewer, the author goes into great detail concerning her frustrating attempts to get to the root of the story.  Unlike that reviewer, however, I found these details fascinating, revealing, and absolutely necessary.  If Skloot had just written the facts without elaborating on the struggle it took to obtain them, I think the Lacks family members would have come across as one-dimensional, misunderstood, and even unlikeable.  Detailing the lengths Skloot went to in order to garner the Lacks family's trust allows the family members to come alive and instills empathy in the reader.  Unfortunately, the last part of the book frustrated me because it seemed that issues were just being hashed and re-hashed with nothing new being brought to light and nothing old being resolved.  It was a bit anti-climatic, but overall a great read.  I hope the Lacks family is doing well and has achieved some peace now that their story has finally been told in such a sympathetic and understanding fashion.
B004DGEK6W|5.0|I've waited so long for \\"Pink Friday\\" to come out. I decided to review it now although I did get the album around the time of the release. Anyway, ever since I first heard Nicki in early 2010 in the song \\"BedRock\\", I really liked her just from that one verse because of her rapping voice and all that. After that,  heard about \\"Massive Attack\\" and loved it on my first listen (it should've gotten more mainstream attention). I was officially a definite Nicki fan and I couldn't wait for the non-mixtape version of \\"Your Love\\" to come out. For every single she released, I only loved her more and more. Now she's one of my favorite artists! The beats on this album are good, and while some have that synthesized drum beat used in a lot of rap songs today (I'm not a big fan of it), like in songs such as \\"I'm the Best\\", \\"Right Thru Me\\", \\"Fly\\", \\"Check it Out\\" and a few more, Nicki can still pull it off. The beats may not be as unique as in \\"Massive Attack\\" (like that amazing Caribbean drum beat!), but at least Nicki made this album as true to herself as possible, and I absolutely love it!        The album starts off very victoriously in \\"I'm the Best\\", which has the greatest opening line for the album; \\"It was back in '07, did a couple of tapes, did a couple DVD's, made a couple mistakes\\". \\"I'm the Best\\", which has a great chorus and amazing lyrics on how she succeeded in her career, which really sets the tone for the rest of the album and deserves to be the first song on \\"Pink Friday\\". \\"Roman's Revenge\\" is absolute fire! It has that synth drum playing over and over and it actually sounds great that way! The lyrics are crazy and I love the ending with Martha (Roman Zolanski's mother), and those insane synths make the song so cool. Although I hate eminem. Anyway, it's still my favorite song on the album. I wish the version of the song with Lil Wayne was better (he should've been in the original) because the original had those crazy additional synths that aren't present in theversion with Wayne and Nicki doesn't have as much energy in the other version, but once you get through all that, this song is really a colossal standout on the album.       \\"Did it On Em\\" is one of my favorites. It has an amazing siren-synth sounding beat and Nicki totally pulls it off with the lyrics. It's definitely a great song. \\"Right Thru Me\\" isn't my favorite, but it's still a good song. Nicki called it the \\"standout on the album\\", and I like that on this single she kept it personal, without the alter-egos or anything. It sounds really good. \\"Fly\\" is one of the empowerment songs on the album. It has an amazing chorus, and while I'm not a fan of Rihanna, the chorus that she sings is really good. \\"Save Me\\" is absolutely amazing! It's singing throughout and I really like how this song sounds personal too. The lyrics are phenomenal and that beat with that repetitive synthesizer just makes the song what it is. It's truly one of my favorites. I personally think \\"Moment 4 Life\\" with Drake definitely deserved to be a single from \\"Pink Friday\\". I love the story behind and everything about that song is great. The video is also really awesome.       \\"Check it Out\\" may have the typical will.i.am beat, but Nicki and that \\"Video Killed the Radio Star\\" sample keep the song extremely cool. It's upbeat, catchy and deserved to be on the album. I'm glad Nicki kept a feature with Kanye West in the song \\"Blazin\\", because this album definitely deserved a song in which Ye features in. \\"Blazin\\" has an awesome extended verse from Nicki and another extended verse from Kanye (both of the verses are great) with a nice bridge and a great chorus alongside a sample. It's a great 5 minutes of a song. \\"Here I Am\\" is a very simple song and once I heard it's one of her favorite songs on the album because it shows how the media portrays her and how she feels with her need for acceptance and all that, it made me appreciate the song and its lyrics even more. It's a great song. \\"Dear Old Nicki\\" has some of my favorite lyrics on the whole album. The beat is good, but I love the lyrics even more. It talks about how she wants to reconnect with the \\"Old Nicki\\" (the one from '07 with the mixtapes and all). It's an amazing song. \\"Your Love\\" is still a great song because it remind sme of summer '10 and how I've waited for this song to bring Nicki chart success and mainstream attention. From then to the album release date, it was only 5-6 months, but it felt like a long time and it's kind of funny to hear the song on the album for some strange reason. It seems like a different Nicki.       The album opened in the best way possible and the standard edition ends in the best way possible, with \\"Last Chance\\", with Natasha Bedingfield. It has an amazing beat (I love that electric guitar) and the whole song has this melody that makes it sound like an empowerment song. At first it sounded like a song about suicide over a happy beat \\"...one bullet in the gun. This is my life and I only got one... I'm ready to shoot\\", but the song is about living your dreams and fulfilling them, and basically she's talking about \\"making a shot into the sky\\", so it might sound confusing at first, but once you get around the lyrics a lot, it makes sense.   Now for the reviews on the three bonus tracks on the deluxe edition- \\"Super Bass\\" is an absolute amazing song, with great bass (like the title suggests), amazing lyrics, melody, and her different voices during the verses are sooo Nicki. Only she can pull that off. \\"Blow Ya Mind\\" is another track that's on fire! The beat, lyrics, and complete sound of the song is so awesome! Another gret hip-hop track from Nicki. \\"Muny\\" may be about material girls and may have a somewhat stuck-up feel to it, but Nicki's just having fun on this track. I love the handclaps and synths and the all-around vibe of the song is fun. I love that line from the song, \\"B-----s want my old s----, buy my old mixtape\\". It's great!      The other two tracks you can only buyphysically from Best Buy, and for anybody who doesn't have Pink Friday, definitely get the 18-track Best Buy edition. \\"Wave Ya Hand\\" is such an awesome song with a great beat and I love the lyrics. The bridge is also hilarious and is definitely a Nicki thing. \\"Catch Me\\" is also one of my favorites. It has an amazing marching-sounding beat. The lyrics and chorus are great and it's a very emotional sounding song. The beat sounds a little confusing during the beginning of the chorus before the drum beat, since it really doesn't have a set beat, with the handclaps and bass all over the place, but I stillthink it's great. It's an odd way to end the extra deluxe, but who cares. \\"Girls Fall Like Dominoes\\" (an iTunes Only track) should've been on this album. It could definitely end the album very well and it's a really good song with a great sample, lyrics, and beat. It's going to be on a UK version of \\"Pink Friday\\" along with the Lil Wayne version of \\"Roman's Revenge\\" and I just might get it.        Anyway, this album is amazing and I can't wait for everything else Nicki's going to have in store in the future. Another thing I wanted to say was, I really hate the Lil Kim/Nicki Minaj feud. They should totally break it up and I'm not Team Kim nor Team Nicki. I love them both, but the cover of Lil Kim's new mixtape \\"Black Friday\\" is kind of going overboard. It copies the cover of \\"Pink Friday\\" and it shows Kim in a similar position to Nicki, showing blood splatters and what's supposed to be Nicki's decapitated head on the cover (it shows a pink lump, which is her hair). When I saw that and found out more about the mixtape, like her diss song to Nicki over the beat of a Nicki song (Did it On Em, and plenty of other things, I really lost a lot of respect for Lil Kim. That was pretty lame and it's also going overboard. I hope she gets over it and makes another actual album.        All that's left to say now is, I can't wait for Nicki's next album!!!!
B0012HCASA|5.0|The entire 2 seasons of the T:SCC was very entertaining. But I believe the writers really decided to get it together when they learned that the show was being cancelled. The last 6 episodes of the second season was simply brilliant. Each episode grips you, challenges you to understand, allowing you to enjoy the pay off when you do. Unlike the minute a thrill offered by lost (which gets tiring soon enough) the second season episodes actually work on building tension across episodes in a more mature fashion. Definitely recommend this to any sci-fi fan and strongly recommend Terminator fans to watch this if they haven't already. :)
B00005JO9J|5.0|This is probably one of my favorite seasons of this show.  The characters are endearing and the story lines are fun to follow.

B004GGQMTW|4.0|In 1991, the American road movie, \\"Thelma & Louise\\" captured America's attention.<br /><br />One for it's strong female lead characters starring Geena Davis (\\"Beetlejuice\\", \\"A League of Their Own\\", \\"Stuart Little\\" films) as Thelma and Susan Sarandon (\\"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\\", \\"The Witches of Eastwick\\", \\"Bull Durham\\") as Louise but also was heavily debated in American media about America's infatuation towards the movie and what detriment that such a movie can have on society.  But also as the film would have resonance towards viewers for women's independence and calling upon Hollywood that having strong female lead characters in a film does work and also can be a financial success.<br /><br />Directed by Ridley Scott (\\"Bladerunner\\". \\"Alien\\", \\"Black Rain\\") and written by Callie Khouri (\\"Mad Money\\", \\"Something to Talk About\\", \\"Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood\\"),\\"Thelma & Louise\\" was a commercial success grossing over $45 million in the box office and received six Academy Award nominations, winning one for \\"Best Original Screenplay\\". The film would also be instrumental in launching the careers of Geena Davis, Brad Pitt and writer/director Callie Khouri.<br /><br />In February 2011, \\"Thelma & Louise\\" will be celebrating its 20th Anniversary with a Blu-ray release courtesy of MGM/Twentieth Century Fox.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"Thelma & Louise: 20th Anniversary\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition (Widescreen 2:35:1) and to watch this film in HD was quite impressive.  The colors of the southwest to the Grand Canyon showcase its detail through this HD release.  Skies are blue, the Thunderbird's blue pops out, Thelma's died reddish brown hair pops and for the most part, the earth tones are what stick out in this film.  There is a good amount of grain and blacks are nice and deep and I detected no artifacting, DNR or edge enhancement at all.<br /><br />Definitely a major upgrade visually compared to the 1997 and 2003 DVD release and fans of the film will definitely be pleased by the vibrant colors and detail seen in the 20th Anniversary release!<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />\\"Thelma & Louise: 20th Anniversary\\" is presented in English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1, Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital and French 5.1 DTS.  While the film is primarily dialogue-driven and also featuring the musical score of Hans Zimmer and music which was appropriate for its time back in 1991, where you will hear the surround channels really picking up is during the final arc of the film when Thelma & Louise are on the run as they tend to use the guns even more and also featuring a pretty significant explosion which comes quite crystal clear through your surround channels.<br /><br />During the bar room sequences, you do get some ambiance but for the most part, it's when the action sequences are employed, where you will hear the more immersive sounds of the film.  But it's important to note that while there is action, this is not an action film and the clear soundtrack is quite appropriate for \\"Thelma & Louise\\".<br /><br />Subtitles are presented in English and English SDH.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"Thelma & Louise: 20th Anniversary\\" comes with the following special features (all presented in SD):<br /><br />  * Commentary by Ridley Scott - An informative and pretty cool commentary by director Ridley Scott.  Scott provides the more technical details on how challenging the film was to make.<br />  * Commentary by Susan Sarandon, Geena Davis and Callie Khouri - A fun and casual audio commentary from writer Callie Khouri who explains what she wanted to accomplish through he screenplay and also talking with actresses Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis, who talk about their characters and the scenes that they shot.<br />  * Deleted and Extended Scenes - (40:19) Plenty of deleted and extended scenes are included.  Especially the longer sex scenes with Geena Davis and Brad Pitt.<br />  * Extended Ending (with Commentary by Ridley Scott) -(3:42) Featuring optional commentary,the ending that I'm glad wasn't used for the final cut of the film.<br />  * Documentaries and Featurettes, including \\"Thelma and Louise: The Last Journey\\"- (59:43) An excellent documentary in which Callie Khouri talks about the anguish she felt about giving another director a chance to work on her script but how she and Ridley Scott worked great together.  Also, how the talent were cast for the film and how many of them were newcomers at the time, especially Brad Pitt.  Interesting is Pitt's comments on his first major sex scene and how Geena Davis helped him through it.  Also, talking about the action sequences and how the film became a major hit and also cause for debate in the media.<br />  * Original Theatrical Featurette (with and without promotional narration) - (5:23) An older featurette in which the director and cast are showcased.<br />  * Multi-Angle Storyboards: The Final Chase - There are two segments featured in this section.  One is the storyboards (4:38) and the other is a storyboard with a shot comparison (4:38).<br />  * \\"Part of You, Part of Me\\" Music Video by Glenn Frey - (4:28) Glenn Frey's music video for \\"Part You, Part of Me\\" for the film.<br />  * Trailer and TV Spots - Featuring the original theatrical trailer, a total of three TV spots and a home video preview.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />\\"Thelma & Louise\\" continues to be an iconic film, 20 years later.<br /><br />Although there have been a few films to have strong female leads, nothing has come close to matching or featuring the quality of the characters featured in \\"Thelma & Louise\\".  This story about two women who set out to have some fun via  two-day vacation and then everything goes wrong.  It's quite plausible and although the film has a good amount of humor, the film is ultimately a tragedy.<br /><br />Two women who had normal lives but their lives are forever changed.  But during their moments together, it's the most freedom that they have ever lived and together, they intend to make their time together meaningful and to go out with a bang!<br /><br />In some ways, one can watch a road film such as \\"Easy Rider\\", another tragic road film and capturing friendship to the last minute, the same can be said with \\"Thelma & Louise\\" but with strong female character leads, it was something that audiences have never seen before.  And I can see how the film would become an inspiration for women, not just for strong lead character roles in Hollywood but the fact that you have a film showcasing women choosing freedom, independence and to leave their banal lifestyle behind.  Granted, in this case, it was accidental and as some media have made a case over, these two women should be not considered as role-models.<br /><br />But the connection this film makes is not about the crimes that were committed, it goes deeper than that.  As Tori Amos has credited the film for the inspiration of her song \\"Me and a Gun\\" (which is about Amos' rape), the film especially Thelma being victimized as a slave wife under the control of a domineering husband and then being assaulted by a man who hits her around as if she is deserving of it.  No woman deserves this treatment and Louise, who has suffered rape before, shows Louise the benefits of freedom, away from the controlling Darryl and that she should stand up for herself.  We witness this change of Thelma throughout the film and the friendship and bond between friends growing.<br /><br />This is the emotional connect that I have felt \\"Thelma & Louise\\" has managed to resonate with many viewers, many women, because these two women are not going to take it anymore.  And while some feared at the time that women would do some acts of vengeance on the men or husbands that have wronged them, the truth is that \\"Thelma & Louise\\" provided a voice for many women who have kept quiet about rape or their poor treatment by a love one.  The movie was probably not meant or was expected to resonate so strongly but it did.<br /><br />As for the film, the imagery of Thelma & Louise grabbing a gun and shooting them towards a tanker, is one of the wonderful images of the film, and of course the final scene has become quite iconic and still remembered two decades later.<br /><br />\\"Thelma & Louise\\" is a wonderful and magnificent film and definitely a highlight of movie screenplays courtesy of Callie Khouri and I felt that having Ridley Scott as the director, gave the film its necessary push to make it seem raw, real and visual for the audience.<br /><br />And of course, the wonderful acting by Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis.  Both were extraordinary in this film and I've read that Michelle Pfeiffer and Melanie Griffith were originally considered for Thelma and Goldie Hawn, Diane Keaton, Anjelica Huston were considered for Louise.  Personally, it's something I can't even fathom.  This was a well-cast film and Sarandon and Davis had wonderful screen chemistry and the two did a fantastic job!  And of course, for the Brad Pitt fans, this is the movie that literally launched his career.<br /><br />As for the 20th anniversary Blu-ray release, first let me say that Twentieth Century Fox has done a great job with these re-releases to celebrate the anniversaries of \\"Dancing with Wolves\\" and \\"Raging Bull\\" and here we are with \\"Thelma & Louise\\" and while I do feel the release is fantastic when it comes to PQ and AQ, while it does have the awesome \\"The Last Journey\\" featurette, its still the same standard definition features that came on DVD before.  I just felt that for a 20th anniversary, it would have been great to revisit with Calli Khouri, Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis.  I suppose that the footage shot for its 10th anniversary would be enough for people but it would have been great to have something new to compliment the 20th anniversary Blu-ray release.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Thelma & Louise: 20th Anniversary\\" is a welcomed upgrade from its previous 2003 DVD release.  The film looks and sounds magnificent in HD and the audio commentary and featurettes included are still informative and enjoyable today.  If you are a big fan of this film or if you are looking for a film on Blu-ray that is well-made, well-written and well-acted, you can't go wrong with \\"Thelma & Louise\\".<br /><br />Highly recommended!film such as \\"Easy Rider\\", another tragic road film and capturing friendship to the last minute, the same can be said with \\"Thelma & Louise\\" but with strong female character leads, it was something that audiences have never seen before.

B004GGQMRY|4.0|Barry Levinson's name is well-known these days mostly as a producer but he has directed a good number of films that people are familiar with.  Films such as \\"Sphere\\", \\"Wag the Dog\\", \\"Sleepers\\", \\"Bugsy\\", \\"Toys\\", \\"Avalon\\", \\"Good Morning Vietnam\\", \\"Diner\\" to name a few.  But for one film, Levinson earned his Oscar and that was in 1988 for \\"Rain Man\\".  A story by Barry Morrow and a screenplay co-written by Morrow and Ronald Bass (\\"Snow Falling on Cedars\\", \\"Step Mom\\", \\"My Best Friend's Wedding\\", \\"Entrapment\\", \\"What Dreams May Come\\"), the film would also bring together America's top male actors Dustin Hoffman (\\"Tootsie\\", \\"Kramer vs. Kramer\\", \\"Ishtar\\") and Tom Cruise (\\"Top Gun\\", \\"Cocktail\\", \\"Risky Business\\", \\"The Color of Money\\").<br /><br />The film which was budgeted at $25 million, earned over $354 million (the film was the highest grossing film of 1988)  and would win four Academy awards including \\"Best Director\\", \\"Best Picture\\", \\"Best Writing, Original Screenplay\\" and a \\"Best Actor in a Leading Role\\" for Dustin Hoffman.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"Rain Man\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1 widescreen). First, its important for me to remind everyone that this is a 1988 film and I've always had the opinion that many films from the '80s tend to have this aged look and sometimes appearances look soft. While for \\"Rain Man\\", the film does show its age in terms of film stock used, this is the best looking version of the film to date.<br /><br />There is a good amount of grain in this film but there is much more detail and edge enhancement can be seen at times.  If anything, the clarity and detail is much more evident in the Blu-ray release and there appears to be some noise reduction utilized as there are some moments of softness.  I did see banding in probably two moments of the film where there was high-reds and pinks.  It's a few-seconds scene but other than that, there are times where the picture quality looked very good and you can see the skin pigments on the skin.<br /><br />Otherwise, if you love the film, \\"Rain Man\\" on Blu-ray looks better than its DVD counterparts.<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />\\"Rain Man\\" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, Spanish Mono and French Dolby Surround. While \\"Rain Man\\" has always been a dialogue-driven film, it also sports a solid musical soundtrack by Hans Zimmer.  If anything, you do hear some ambiance at times but for the most part, this is a center and front-channel driven lossless soundtrack with mostly instruments utilizing the surround channel at times.  You do get a scene where you watch Charlie and Raymond driving through a bridge and you can hear the wheels going over the bridge and sound coming through the surround channels but this is pretty much a dialogue-driven film.<br /><br />Subtitles are presented in English SDH, Spanish and French.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"Rain Man\\" comes with the following special features in Standard Definition:<br /><br />  * Audio Commentary - Featuring audio commentary by director Barry Levinson<br />  * Audio Commentary - Featuring audio commentary by writer Barry Morrow<br />  * Audio Commentary - Featuring audio commentary by writer Ronald Bass<br />  * The Journey of Rain Man - (22:07)  A featurette on the making of \\"Rain Man\\" and features interviews with director Barry Levinson and writers Barry Morrow and Ronald Bass.<br />  * Lifting the Fog: A Look at the Mysteries of Autism - (20:13) A featurette about autism and those who are similar to Raymond Babbitt.<br />  * Deleted Scene - (2:13) A deleted scene featuring Raymond at a convenience store (getting into trouble).<br />  * Original Theatrical Trailer - (2:13) Featuring the original theatrical trailer of \\"Rain Man\\" in standard definition.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />Back in 1988, I was a junior in high school when I watched this film come out.  Of course, the film was popular because of Tom Cruise who was the top young actor in Hollywood with the popularity of \\"Top Gun\\", \\"The Color of Money\\" and \\"Cocktail\\", but what stood out for me the most was the performance by Dustin Hoffman, the writing of the film and the character relationship between Charlie and Raymond and it was the first time I heard about autism.<br /><br />Autism, of course, has been focused a lot more in today's society, may it be on the news or learning about it through television shows, but back then, I've never heard of it and I felt that \\"Rain Man\\" did increase public awareness for autism.<br /><br />If one was to dissect this film, I suppose one can say that it was longer than it should have been and could have been tightened a bit more and keeping the duration much lower.  I am aware that film critic Pauline Kael called it \\"wet kitsch\\" (which is a word that she tends to use for films that she really dislikes) but after watching this film once again since its release for VHS back in the '90s, my feelings back in the late '80s, to the '90s and now 2011 really hasn't changed all that much.<br /><br />What I enjoyed about the film is the fact that you get to see Charlie's arrogance directed towards his brother and to see this character change as he becomes more acquainted with his brother.  While some may feel the character of Charlie to be repulsive or overly cocky, the performance by Dustin Hoffman is magnificent.  The timing of the words and the motions that went into Raymond's character was well-done by Hoffman and I enjoyed how the conflict begins at the beginning and slowly works itself towards the end.  Of course, the ending may seem a bit too anti-climactic but for what it's worth, I did not want to see a mushy ending.  The ending fits right with Charlie Babbage and everything worked out.<br /><br />If I had any problems with the film, I still find the scene with Susanna and Raymond in an elevator to be a bit off and as mentioned earlier, there are some scenes that could have been trimmed off to keep the pacing much smoother and the duration not so long.<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray release, I was hoping for some sort of revisiting special feature and possibly an interview with Tom Cruise or Dustin Hoffman, heck even Barry Levinson.  But you do get all the special features from the \\"Rain Man\\" 2004 Special Edition DVD and upgraded picture quality and a lossless soundtrack.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Rain Man\\" is still an enjoyable film over 20-years later.  While the Blu-ray release may not include anything new compared to its 2004 DVD counterpart, it does look and sound a lot better.  So, if you enjoyed \\"Rain Man\\" a lot, then I definitely recommend upgrading to Blu-ray.the performance by Dustin Hoffman, the writing of the film and the character relationship between Charlie and Raymond and it was the first time I heard about autism.

B001EO748M|1.0|I purchased this product back in February as a birthday gift for my girlfriend. I never received my product to date nor have I received a response from my March 11, 2011 request for my product to date. Please Help!
B004CGUC06|5.0|Federico Fellini, the legendary Italian filmmaker and screenwriter known for cinema masterpieces such as \\"The White Sheik\\" (1952),  \\"I Vitelloni\\" (1953), \\"La Strada\\" (1954), \\"Nights of Cabiria\\" (1957),\\"La Dolce Vita\\" (1960),  \\"8 1/2' (1963), etc.<br /><br />Fellini's films are known for capturing ethereal storylines, fantasy that binges on desire and his films are among those that have tested viewers but also has provided many cineaste with visual delight from the films that are from his oeuvre.  His influence has inspired Woody Allen, Martin Scorsese, David Lynch, Tim Burton, Pedro Almodovar to name a few and while many think of \\"La Dolce Vita\\", \\"8 1/2', \\"I Vitelloni\\" as the top of Fellini's career, there are many who feel that \\"Amarcord\\" is one of his most personal. \\"Amarcord\\" is also the third film for Fellini that won an Oscar for \\"Best Foreign Film\\" but also won multiple awards throughout the world and is perhaps one of his most accessible film for cinema fans worldwide.<br /><br />The film was the fourth DVD release for The Criterion Collection back in 1999 and received a special re-release featuring more special features in 2006.  In 2011, a Blu-ray release of \\"Amarcord\\" including the special features from the 2006 DVD release is now available in the U.S.<br /><br />While not an autobiography, the film mirrors Fellini's life as a child and teenager growing up in Rimini, Italy (a seaside town in the province of Emilia-Romagna) during the time of Fascist Italy.<br /><br />\\"Amarcord\\" is not the easiest film to describe because it's one of those films that must be experienced.  The film can be seen as a coming-of-age film but also a film that has your typical villagers that everyone knows their name because of their actions or their body.  The carnivalesque film focuses on various people of the village throughout the year during the 1930's and the various episodes that transpire within a year's time.<br /><br />\\"Amarcord\\" (which means \\"I remember\\" in Romagnolo) takes place in a village which has welcomed the spring time courtesy of the puffballs that float in the air.  Everyone welcomes the end of Winter and a man named Giudizio (played by Aristide Caporale), looks into the camera and recites a poem.<br /><br />Meanwhile, we are introduced to the beautiful Gradisca (played by Magali Noel).  A woman known for her body and clothing that accentuates her posterior which many of the men and even teenage boys from the village have always taken notice.<br /><br />In this village, we are introduced to characters such as the prostitute and nymphomaniac named Voplina (played by Josiane Tanzilli), the blind accordion player (played by Domenica Pertica), the heavy set and enormously well-endowed tobacconist (played by Maria Antonietta Beluzzi) and the family members of which \\"Amacord\\" focuses on, the Biondi family.  Aurelio Biondi (played by Armando Brancia) is the hot-headed father who always gets upset with his teenage son Titta Biondi (played by Bruno Zanin).<br /><br />While Titta gets in trouble most of the time, his mother Miranda (played by Pupella Maggio) is always ready to argue with Aurelio.  Other members of the family include Titta's younger brother Oliva (played by Stefano Proietti), his grandfather (played by Giuseppe Ianigro) who may look old but can easily remember the ages when he and others had sex and Miranda's brother Lallo (played by Nando Orfei) and his wife who live at the house.  Needless to say, because of Aurelio's hot temper and Titta's mischievous nature, there is never a quiet moment at the house.<br /><br />When the camera is focused on the teenager Titta, we learn how he and his friends love to get in trouble.  From picking on people, to finding ways to upset their teachers and at times, making fun of their own friends during class.  But these teenagers have one thing in common and that is the fact they are horny teenagers who love to look at a woman's ass (and also enjoy pleasuring themselves to releasetheir sexual tension).  For Titta, he just loves to look at Gradisca's body whenever she is walking by and one day hopes, he can try to make a move on her.<br /><br />As for Aurelio, he is anti-fascist.  Because of his hot-head, his wife Miranda does all she can to prevent him from getting in trouble, this includes locking the gates of their home to keep him inside.  He can't help but always argue with Titta who loves to get his father upset.  But still, Aurelio takes care of his family.<br /><br />Gradisca, is the popular single woman in the village.  She dreams of having someone to love and someone to love her right back.  She embodies confidence and knows that men and boys love to look at her when she and her friends are walking around.  And she knows with the fascists coming to town, this is her chance to find a husband.<br /><br />The film shows us how life is in the village for these characters and everyone around them for the whole year.  Featuring many short scenes may it be Titta and his friends going to school, getting in trouble, looking at beautiful women to Gradisca trying to find \\"Mr. Right\\", \\"Amarcord\\" is a collection of events with no real storyline but experiences from Fellini's life and also his imagination.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"Amarcord\\" is presented in color (1:85:1 aspect ratio).  I have compared the 2011 Blu-ray release and the 2006 DVD release and the colors are much more vibrant compared to its DVD counterpart.  More detail of the walls and surroundings of the city can be seen quite clearly on Blu-ray.  As well as the grime on the faces of characters like Volpina, the stained shirts of Titta and the hairy back of Aurelio.  These are much more evident on Blu-ray versus watching it on DVD.  There is a good amount of grain that can be seen on the Blu-ray release and for the most part, for fans of the film, watching it on HD is definitely worth the upgrade.<br /><br />According to the Criterion Collection, the HD transfer was created on a Spirit Datacine from a 35mm interpositive.  Thousands of instances of dirt, debris, scratches, splices, warps, jitter and flicker were manually removed using MTI's DRS system and Pixel Farm's PFClean sytem, while Digital Vision's DVNR system was used for small dirt, grain and noise reduction.<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />\\"Amarcord\\" is presented in its original Italian uncompressed monaural plus an optional English dubbed soundtrack.  Dialogue and music is clear and understandable.  I didn't notice any clicks, pops or hiss during the Italian soundtrack.  As for the English dubbed soundtrack, while I try to stay away from dubbed soundtracks, I will have to give a nod for those that worked on it as they tried to match the voices with the lips and some of acting of the voice actors were well-done but some of the voice acting was not too my liking.  Needless to say, I preferred the original Italian soundtrack much more.<br /><br />According to the Criterion Collection, the monaural soundtrack was remastered at 24-bit from a 35mm magnetic soundtrack.

But among his masterpieces, there are a few of his films that I tend to rewatch many times and \\"Amarcord\\" is one of them.<br /><br />\\"Amarcord\\" is a film that captures everything beautiful, everything ugly, everything about life and what people see day-to-day.  And I can imagine for Fellini, although \\"Amarcord\\" is not an exact autobiography nor was it intended to be, it is paying homage to what he experienced throughout his younger years and the people he came in contact with.<br /><br />What makes \\"Amarcord\\" so intriguing, and so fun without the cinema banality that one would be used to seeing, is that we are given a taste of episodes of these villagers and the way its put together, you find yourself as a voyeur of these moments in the lives of these individuals that live in a small village.  There is no real plot line, but it's a film that features so many of the fun moments that life has to offer that makes \\"Amarcord\\" so delightful.<br /><br />From moments when the Biondi family goes to pick up their Uncle Teo from the mental hospital and the uncle runs up to the tree not wanting to get down and starts screaming of how he wants a woman.  Anyone who dares to get him down is pelted with fruit.  Another scene features Titta and his friends at a parade and celebration for Benito Mussolini aka \\"Il Duce\\" and each have their own daydreams of being with a woman.  Or a scene where we watch as Gradisca tries to prepare for a romantic night with a man or when Titta goes to the cinema to pull some of his moves on Gradisca and to see what happens.  Or possibly one of the most memorable scenes is when Titta goes to the big but very busty tobacco saleswoman and manages to experience a woman's breast, it's just how its featured on screen, you can't help but laugh as the young character is not sure what to do and all the woman can tell him \\"Suck, no blow!\\".<br /><br />But what also works is how the art direction of the film helps to give us that feeling of carnivalesque characters.  Danilo Donati's awesome costume and production design, Giorgio Giovannini's surrealistic art direction is fantastic and of course, the cinematography by Giuseppe Rotunno is magnificent.  While the writing is not overly polemic, Fellini and Tonino Guerra did a great job of interjecting the sex and politics that are a strong part of the enjoyment of thisfilm.<br /><br />All the primary characters and supporting characters also add to the enjoyment of the film.  To sum it up, \\"Amarcord\\" is a true masterpiece from Fellini!<br /><br />And I can go on and on about the positives of this film but still not be able to describe it because frankly, I don't want to spoil anything for the viewer.  Also, as mentioned earlier, this is not one of those films that I can easily describe.  It's probably best to say that it's various episodes that happen in a village over a year's time and keep it at that.<br /><br />Clearly, \\"Amarcord\\" is one of those films that a cinema fan must watch and experience.  And I have to say that when The Criterion Collection released the 2006 DVD, I felt that this was one of the best DVD's released from the company.  The way it was treated and given special features galore, lengthy and enjoyable, but most of all informative.  And now this film has been given its HD treatment which I found to be quite a gorgeous upgrade from the original 2006 DVD release.  The detail of the village surroundings, the details that are more apparent on the characters, \\"Amarcord\\" looks very good on Blu-ray!<br /><br />And if you haven't owned the 2006 DVD release (or even its original 1999) DVD release, this is one Fellini film (and I can easily vouch for nearly all Fellini films on the Criterion Collection) that is definitely worth owning.<br /><br />I'm constantly asked if it's like \\"8 1/2' or \\"La Strada\\" and the only thing that I can tell people is forget about those films.  Just enjoy this one and experience it!<br /><br />And then when you are done, watch the documentary \\"Fellini's Homecoming\\" afterward as you get to know the true story behind \\"Amarcord\\" and the complicated relationship that Fellini had with his hometown of Rimini.  And you get plenty of special features which include audio commentary, interviews, radio interviews and also included is a wonderful 66-page booklet (same contents from the 2006 release) which include Fellini's essay \\"My Rimini\\", a collection of reminisces from the filmmaker when he was laying in a hospital bed (thinking he was going to die) and was being treated by his doctor from his hometown of Rimini.<br /><br />This latest release of \\"Amarcord\\", aside from being a Fellini masterpiece is literally a grand slam for the Criterion Collection.  It's one of the most complete Blu-rays released with special features that matter and definitely enhances ones appreciation for the film.<br /><br />For those who own the wonderful 2006 Criterion Collection re-release on DVD and wonder if  the new Blu-ray is worth the upgrade, my answer is yes!  The film looks great on Blu-ray but if you are watching it on a TV that doesn't have 1080p capability and you are used to watching movies on your laptop or TV, then probably not but if you are planning to upgrade your equipment or have the equipment to watch films in HD, then most definitely.  There is no major difference in the amount of special features between the 2011 Blu-ray release and the 2006 DVD re-release aside from PQ and AQ differences.  So, if you have the equipment to enjoy \\"Amarcord\\" in HD, then yes... I highly recommend upgrading from DVD to Blu-ray as this film looks absolutely beautiful in HD.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Amarcord\\" is a vibrant, beautiful, hilarious and marvelous masterpiece from Federico Fellini. The Blu-ray release of \\"Amarcord\\" from the Criterion Collection is a must-own for your cinema collection!  Highly recommended. A+voted to \\"Amarcord\\" from the collection of Don Young.

B001FB55H6|3.0|Three stars because it is visually a really great movie, but the actors just don't do it for me, pretty emotionless the whole way through.     This Blu-Ray doesn't have the trailers for the movie, the trailers were one of the best parts too. Seems odd to give a two disc set and not include that feature, it's not like they ran out of space for it.
B0034G4OUY|4.0|In 2011, Dwayne Johnson (\\"The Scorpion King\\", \\"The Other Guys\\", \\"Race to Witch Mountain\\") made his action film comeback with \\"Faster\\" directed by George Tillman Jr. (\\"Barbershop\\" films) and written by Tony and Joe Gayton (\\"Bulletproof\\", \\"Uncommon Valor\\", \\"Sweet Jane\\").<br /><br />Starring alongside Johnson are Billy Bob Thornton (\\"Sling Blade\\", \\"Armageddon\\", \\"Monster's Ball\\"), Carla Gugino (\\"Watchmen\\", \\"Sin City\\", \\"Night at the Museum\\"), Moon Bloodgood (\\"Terminator Salvation\\", \\"Eight Below\\", \\"Pathfinder\\"), Oliver Jackson-Cohen (\\"Going the Distance\\"), Maggie Grace (\\"Lost\\", \\"Taken\\", \\"Knight and Day\\"), Tom Berenger (\\"Platoon\\", \\"Inception\\", \\"Training Day\\"), Jennifer Carpenter (\\"Dexter\\", \\"Quarantine\\") and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje (\\"Lost\\", \\"G.I. Joe\\", \\"The Bourne Identity\\").<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"Faster\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1).  The film looks absolutely gorgeous in HD!  Plenty of details can be seen throughout this film, from the detail and textures of the skin pores of every character during closeups, facial hair on the guys, detail on the guns, detail on surroundings, what you would expect from a recent film, \\"Faster\\" looks awesome!  There is detail from the sweat and blood all over Driver, the detail of the firearms, the vehicles, you name it, the detail is what comes through in this Blu-ray release.<br /><br />Outdoor scenes are colorful and vibrant, blacks are nice and deep, I saw no signs of any dust particles, artifacting, banding, DNR, edge enhancement or aliasing whatsoever.<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />\\"Faster\\" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD MA and the lossless soundtrack is also awesome!  Driver's luger packs a punch and when he and Killer are exchanging fire, audio was well utilized through the surround channels and definitely bringing an immersive soundtrack to the viewer.  And this happens quite a bit throughout the film as there is quite a bit of gunfire, cars speeding up and burning rubber and hearing the tires shriek, automobile crashes and hearing the metal crunching, bullets ricocheting off metal.<br /><br />Overall, a pretty good use of surround and LFE.  Granted, it's not as active as \\"Quantum of Solace\\" but it's still features a solid lossless soundtrack and fans of this film should enjoy hearing it in lossless.<br /><br />Subtitles are presented in English, English SDH and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"Faster\\" comes with the following special features (presented in high definition, English stereo and optional English subtitles):<br /><br />  *<br />  *<br />  * PS3 Theme - If you have a PS3 theme, you can get a grayish theme with Dwayne Johnson holding his gun.<br />  * movieIQ®+sync - If you're Blu-ray is connected to the Internet, you can pull up info. on the film realtime.<br />  * Alternate Ending with Director's Introduction - (12:42) The original ending to \\"Faster\\" that didn't do well during the test screening.  Some may like this ending more than the final cut, I did like it...but I enjoyed the final cut ending more.  There is a different outcome to the ending of the film.  Featuring an optional introduction by director George Tillman Jr.<br />  * Deleted Scenes with Director's Introductions - (7:54) Featuring five deleted scenes with optional introductions by director George Tillman Jr.<br />  * Criminals & Cops: The Cast of Faster - (12:12) Featuring an interview with director George Tillman Jr. and the cast of \\"Faster\\".<br />  * Weapons and Wheels: The Guns, Cars and Stunts of Faster - (11:54) A featurette featuring the weapons, cars and stunts used on \\"Faster\\".<br />  * Animatics - (12:22) Featuring the storyboard and pre-rendered CG storyboards for the bank heist, old man, hospital and joust scenes.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />The Rock has come back to action films!<br /><br />And after trying different genres, there is no doubt that Dwayne Johnson doing action films fits perfectly for him.  You want to see Johnson in films where he is kicking butt and \\"Walking Tall\\" was a perfect example of where Johnson shines as an action film star.  It's what many people have seen him do as \\"The Rock\\" on WWE and so, his return to action films in \\"Faster\\" was expected and if there is one thing that can be positively said about this film is that the Brahma Bull brings it!<br /><br />But unlike his previous films, Johnson's character \\"Driver\\" is not a good guy.  He's a criminal, he's a murderer and while you are sympathetic for his cause, I feel that the character is one that will easily turn people off and those who will want to see Dwayne Johnson do what he does best, playing a character who wants to kick some ass!<br /><br />For the most part, this action film is an entertaining popcorn action flick that is quite watchable, adrenal and enjoyable but if you try to extract what is deep about satisfying about the movie, that is where \\"Faster\\" comes up short.<br /><br />One major positive about the film is its cast.  You have an all-star cast and while most of them don't show up for all that long, the storyline's focus on four different characters is quite interesting. Outside of Johnson's \\"Driver\\", Billy Bob Thornton can always pull off the Cop-like character.  Granted, he's not a likable cop, as his first initial shot shows him to be a drug addict, but Billy Bob knows how to play these type of character roles.  Carla Gugino as Detective Cicero was not well utilized in my opinion and possibly the characters that you do find pretty cool and feel they should have their own movie is Oliver Jackson-Cohen's \\"Killer\\" and Maggie Grace's \\"Lily\\".<br /><br />And that for me lies the problem.  We enjoy the characters too much.<br /><br />In some ways, I felt we shouldn't.  Sympathetic, I understand but the Driver was fine, playing the man carrying out his revenge.  The Killer should have been some deranged, psycho lunatic.  The Cop could stay the way he was and for Cicero, a more definitive position of a woman in power, rather one who feels she is getting shortchanged by the Cop.<br /><br />Sure, the concept would fit into the banality of revenge action films but it works.  Instead, we are left with plot holes that make no sense.  Why was the ordeal videotaped?  Why do the police have that videotape?<br /><br />Also, I do believe that there is one crucial deleted scene that should have been included in the film and it deals with the Cop and the character of Marina.  I know that George Tillman Jr. didn't want to cut it but he did and I felt it was a mistake.  I also feel the \\"Kill Bill\\"-esque type of storyline and killing one's parent and then warning their child about if they want to come at him for revenge was just too contrived.<br /><br />But in the end, it all comes down to is the film's writing and execution.  The writers made these characters too likable and while the film is focused on the driver, they made the audience supporting the suave Killer and his girlfriend Lily even more (which prompted the change of the original ending of the storyline).<br /><br />I will say that George Tillman Jr. does take a big step forward from his \\"Barbershop\\" film years by directing this action film.  \\"Faster\\" is a visually cool looking film and on Blu-ray, the picture quality and audio quality is great!  The special features were also good but it would have helped to have a director's commentary and giving Tillman a chance to reflect on certain scenes and if he would have done anything different.<br /><br />With that being said, I still enjoyed \\"Faster\\" as a popcorn action flick that features a good number of stars in the film.  On Blu-ray, I felt that the picture quality and lossless audio soundtrack definitely enhanced my enjoyment of the film.<br /><br />But if you enjoy Dwayne Johnson action films  and you want to see him in a more violent film and see him ultimately kick some ass, I have no doubt that \\"Faster\\" is a film that you will definitely enjoy.at many people have seen him do as \\"The Rock\\" on WWE and so, his return to action films in \\"Faster\\" was expected and if there is one thing that can be positively said about this film is that the Brahma Bull brings it!

0670022411|2.0|Prepublication hype made this book sound exciting.  I foolishly rushed to purchase it.  The author does have some interesting ideas with new thoughts on witches, vampires and their ilk.  Unfortunately, the plotting and writing are trite, formulaic and ultimately boring, boring, BORING!  The author has used the worst cliches of romance novels (and I love a good romance novel) to pad her overlong, unfinished manuscript. Why does every fantasy novel published need to be part of a trilogy?  Why create a whiny, willfully obtuse heroine in need of a supermasculine hero to protect her when she swoons?  The hero himself is little more than an oenophile stalker, a controlling personality draped in the gorgeously eternal good looks repeated in many a recent vampire novel.  Why the obession with the olfactory?      The most interesting character, for me, was the house.    I wanted to like this book, I really did. Unfortunately, I haven't wanted to finish it and I certainly won't purchase anything else from this author.

1591843790|3.0|Guy Kawasaki seems to want to be the Dale Carnegie for the social media crowd with his newest book \\"Enchantment.\\" While not a bad thing (perhaps many of them have not read the classics), it has been done before - over and over and over again.    Keep in mind, the information is timeless, so if if you are just beginning your path and haven't delved into the many other books out there that offer good solid information that has been used in business and LIFE, then this book will inspire and enchant. If you've been around a few self-help business-books, you'll find \\"Enchantment\\" unenchanting.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Honestly, I was SO blown away by her first CD, (19) that I didn't think 21 could compete. I mean, how do you make something that's perfect even better? I still don't have the answer, but on this CD Miss Adele proves that she's more than just a one-hit wonder! The depth, and warmth, and angst in her voice is unparalleled, and every time I listen to tracks like \\"Turning Tabels\\" \\"He Won't Go\\", \\"One and Only\\", and \\"Someone Like You\\" I lose my mind. I enter a spiritual realm and her voice, and the lyrics speak to my soul. This is SOUL music at it's finest. There is no one else in music doing it like Adele, and I love how she lets her talent speak for her; not her physical beauty. One day soon I am going to see her in concert, even if it means flying across the globe to do it.

1591843790|5.0|Enchantment: The Art of Changing Hearts, Minds and Actions  by Guy Kawasaki  Reviewed by Phil Russell    I just finished reading Guy Kawasaki's tenth book, \\"Enchantment: The Art of Changing Hearts, Minds and Actions.\\"   Guy Kawasaki was the Evangelist for the Macintosh, hired to interest developers in writing software for the Macintosh. He also created alltop.com, a search engine site for magazine content. He works as a venture capitalist.  Enchantment is a fascinating book, filled with ideas on how to create a company -- or project -- and succeed. Enchantment is the idea that you can fill people with great delight, and that this helps you succeed. What filled Kawasaki with great delight? The Macintosh! Before seeing the Macintosh for the first time, Kawasaki was a jewelry salesman. The Macintosh was his personal enchantment.   * Hepatic touch refers to the sense of touch. In an example Kawasaki notes that a heavy clipboard produced feelings of importance and seriousness. When you apply for a job, if you are given a cheap light plastic clipboard to hold a form you are filling out, it will give you a bad feeling, consciously or unconsciously, about the company.  * Premortems. In medicine postmortems are held to determine the cause of death. Kawasaki thinks you should hold a premortem because it will help prevent the death of your project. So at the beginning of a company or a project, gather the principals and have them assume the project has failed and come up with possible reasons for the failure.  * Reciprocation. During the 2001 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, students from the White Knoll Middle School in Columbia, SC, sent $447,265 to New York City to replace a fire truck destroyed during 9/11. This was a reciprocation to New Yorkers who bought Columbia a fire wagon 134 years earlier. In fact the first fire wagon sunk on the way, down and New Yorkers raised more money and sent a second fire wagon down.  * \\"I know you would do the same for me\\" is a better response to a thank you for a favor than \\"You're welcome.\\"  * Unexpected giving. Kawasaki met Richard Branson (Virgin Group) and Branson asked if he had ever flown Virgin. Kawasaki said he had not, and was a United customer. Branson got on his knees and shined Kawasaki's shoes,using his own coat to polish. Kawasaki now always flies Virgin when it flies to his destination.  * User Groups. Many excellent companies have user groups. Apple, Harley Davison, Porsche and Cisco are examples. Macintosh user groups kept Macintosh alive when Apple could not or would not do that. Starting user groups is one part of establishing an ecosystem to foster endurance of the company or project.  * She. Much of the time authors refer to unnamed persons with the personal pronoun \\"he.\\" Kawasaki uses she in Enchantment for unnamed persons who are successful . What a great idea! You will really notice how Kawasaki uses personal pronouns.  * Promoting spreadability. The Grateful Dead encourage taping of their programs. In fact they provide special seating for tapers. There is even a section for tapers on their Web site. Compare this with Metallica, which goes after anyone who tries to download their music on the Internet. The Grateful Dead has been around long enough to suspect that their generosity is good for business. I have not bought a Metallica tune since they started railing about downloading.  * Quotations. There are wonderful quotations at the start of each section or chapter. Here are a few I liked:   + Diplomacy is the art of letting someone have your way. -- Daniele Varé.   + You have first to experience what you want to express - Pablo Picasso.   + Every sale has five basic obstacles: no need, no money, no hurry, no desire, no trust. -- Zig Ziglar.   + Create like a god. Command like a king. Work like a slave. Constantine Brancusi.   + So much of what we call management consists of making it difficult for people to work. -- Peter Drucker.  * Positioning. A real estate office increased sales by 16 percent by altering the script the receptionist used. Instead of just saying \\"Let me connect you to Sandra,\\" they added \\" She has 20 years of experience in renting properties in this area.  This is a book that will be valuable to anyone entering a leadership position. Many already in such jobs will find the book valuable, too.
B00000K31Q|5.0|I watched this in Year 12 for my Media Studies class, along with \\"Boyz In The Hood\\". I didn't like Boyz much, but this was briliant! I knew already that it was based on Shakespeare's \\"Taming of The Shrew\\". I loved Kat's witty dialogue and personality. From the moment I heard \\"Bad Reputation\\" playing, I knew Kat was going to be as much of a shrew as Shakespeare's original Kate was.  Bianca was also a character I loved in some ways. I couldn't help enjoying her shallow conversation with her friend Chastity at the beginning \\"Yeah, but see, there's a difference between like and love, cause I like my Sketchers, but I love my Prada backpack.\\"  \\"But I love my Sketchers.\\"  \\"That's because you don't have a Prada backpack.\\"  Now, the story. Kat (Julia Stiles) and Bianca (Larisa Oleynik) Stratford have a dating rule. Bianca can date when Kat does. However, Kat doesn't want to date, which poses a problem for her younger sister, who wants to date. She even has two choices. There's new boy Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), very sweet and completely smitten. The other boy is Joey Donner (Andrew Keegan), a model with only one thing he wants from Bianca. The dating rule makes the boys allies in getting Kat to date. Cameron and his friend Michael(David Krumholtz) find the perfect date for Kat-bad-boy Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger). They get Joey to pay Patrick to date Kat, letting him think that it's to his advantage, and the story is made.  Personally, my favourite scenes are at the prom. The scene when Bianca triple-punches Joey is priceless!  I recommend it to anyone, having seen \\"Taming Of The Shrew\\" or not. It's a sweet story with romance and humour, and all ages will love it.

B002ZG99QS|5.0|As a 12 year-old boy seeing the original Tron, I was hooked.  When I bought the 20th anniversary DVD I was taken back on a sentimental journey reminding me of those times when a movie came along that showed you new things you'd never seen before.  Tron was one such movie.  I worried how Tron Legacy would look, if it would be just like every other new sci-fi movie, and if it could stand out uniquely as much as the original did.  Tron Legacy is stunning visually, and even more impressive for me is the story.  What a great way to connect the two, and carry on the story.  I'm amazed by people who think it as shallow, or without soul.  This movie is rich, and has great depth.  Those who can't see that, don't fully grasp the story.  Tron was all Steven Lisberger, and although Tron Legacy has creative input and direction from additional people, Steven's hand is evident throughout.  I feared they might not be able to pull it off, but not only did they pull it off, they did it convincingly.  The Tron franchise still stands alone, not that it's the best movie ever made (how can that even be determined?, but Tron Legacy helps to cement the story as one of the most unique.  Too many movies follow a formula where you can figure out what is going to happen.  Tron does not.  Who could have guessed what Clu becomes, or that Tron changes allegiance?  The nuggets classic Tron fans are thrown throughout the movie are a real treat: Dumont's garage, Journey on the juke box, Dillinger's son, and so on. I loved the young Flynn and old Flynn.  The did it flawlessly.
1591843790|1.0|I was appalled by much of the content in this book - especially in the early chapters. Not because it's wrong - but because it is so basic.  First chapter - how to be likeable:  genuine smile, firm handshake (no sweaty palms, not more than three seconds.) Chapter on how to prepare:  set goals, have a checklist. Seriously? I paid money for this?<br /><br />I'm appalled because someone of Guy Kawasaki's stature thought it would be ok to leverage his brand to create book sales.  I can just hear the conversation between Guy and his book agent:  \\"But I don't have time to write a book with original ideas.\\"  \\"Then just string together a bunch of platitudes. We'll get some great testimonials and we'll sell a ton.\\"<br /><br />If there is some original thinking in the book, it's an article's worth, not a book's worth.<br /><br />This book does not live up to the promises made by the influential reviewers.
1591843790|5.0|As a marketing professional, I talk about creating love affairs with your customers a lot.  Why?  Let's look at how people behave when they're in the bloom of a new love.<br /><br />~ They find the other person intoxicating -- they crave more.<br />~ They can't help themselves.  They talk about their new love all the time.  To everyone and anyone who will listen.<br />~ They are very forgiving of missteps or mistakes.<br />~ They want to be good and helpful to their new love -- what matters to that person suddenly matters to them as well.<br /><br />Now translate that back to a customer, donor, employee, volunteer, boss or vendor.  What organization wouldn't want those very important people to feel that way towards them?<br /><br />And keep in mind...this isn't a one way street.  You have to genuinely treat them the same way.  Or the love is very short lived. At my agency, we call it creating a love affair.  Guy Kawasaki calls it being Enchanting.  And lucky for all of us -- he wrote a \\"how to\\" manual for getting it done.<br /><br />The book's basic premise is this:  \\"enchantment is not about manipulating people.  It transforms situations and relationships. It converts hostility into civility and civility into affinity.  It changes skeptics and cynics into believers and the undecided into the loyal.\\"<br /><br />Again I ask the same question -- what organization wouldn't want to be able to inspire and instill that spirit?<br /><br />But as you know, I'm not into books that get us fired up to do/be something without telling us how.  (The former is just mean teasing)  Guy's books pushes past the why and gets to the how before page 10.  In fact, chapters 2-12 all start with the word \\"how.\\"  That's the sign of a book I can use.<br /><br />You really need to read this book with a note pad and pen at hand, because you're going to get a lot of fresh ideas that you want to capture.

B000TENE6Y|4.0|It seems as if Radiohead's 4th album is a popular one, but it got too much hype for the quality it caught my attention with.<br /><br />I don't remember much about this album, but I know it's laid-back, in my opinion, for the most part with different lyrics. Luckily, Amazon allows me to hear samples from \\"OK Computer\\" so that I don't have to sit there and listen to the songs and tell you about them; I don't waste time like that. Real deal advantage coming through.<br /><br />Depictions of Sound and/or Lyrics (CONCRETE):<br /><br />-Dreamy<br />-Crafty<br />-Intelligent<br />-Picturesque<br />-Annoyed<br />-Optimistic/Supreme<br />-Justified<br />-Suggestive (non-sexual)<br />-Vengeful<br />-Insignificant<br />-Yielding<br />-Methodic<br />-Ambitious<br />-Sneaky<br />-Stuck<br />-Hopeless<br />-Savior<br />-Driving<br /><br />SONIC:<br /><br />I could imagine someone listening to this album who's down in the dumps and lonely. There is rare energy garnered from rhythms, so you could prepare to go to sleep with it. Certain songs didn't appeal to me. Most of them are forgettable, thus ephemeral. Unique instrumentation, and that I applaud.
0307387178|3.0|In this story of a youth that gets in over his head, I can't help but think of the words to a Billy Joel song.  I'm going off about a thirty year old memory, but the words go something like, \\"There's always the place for the angry young man with his fist in the air and his head in the sand. ... I once believed in causes too and had my pointless point of view and life went on no matter who was wrong or right.\\"  In parts of story, especially since Krakauer is a good writer who adds personal insights, my \\"shoulder angels and devils\\" were going crazy with things like \\"see, you were right not to have been crazier in your youth\\" and \\"man, I wish I'd done more crazy stuff\\", so the book was thought provoking.  The problem was I never liked Chris/Alex, the young man about whom the book is written. I understood his wanderlust and even his rejection of material comforts, but I never understood him, and in the end I wondered why I'd spent the time reading the book.  Would actually seeing more photographs and more of his handwritten journal pages have helped Chris/Alex become a real person worth puzzling over?  Maybe, and it appears that other editions may have added these.  In the meantime, I'm afraid for me he'll just be an appendage to \\"the angry young man\\" or maybe just the thwarted young man.

B002ZG981E|2.0|Frankly I don't understand a lot of the \\"I didn't get it\\" reviews.  It seemed pretty straight forward to me, but then maybe I've seen the Matrix too many times.  This just did nothing for me at all, I mean how many times has this \\"are we in a dream or reality\\" shtick been done and re-done and re-done?  Oh, I know!  Let's put a spin on it and say \\"Is it a dream or a dream or a dream or reality\\".  Give me a break.  I didn't hate it by any means at all, in fact I think the hotel fight scene was one of the best fight scenes I've ever seen, but I left the theater thinking \\"I don't get it\\" not for the plot but for why so many people loved this movie in the first place.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|It's rare these days that I am literally blown away by an ENTIRE album.  With so many mediocore artists out there, most albums contain (at most) two decent songs.  This album is a rare gem of an exception.  I have listned to the whole album probably 100 times since I purchased it a week ago, and I'm still going.  The songs are rich, melodic, and just amazing.  The album has variety and the layers of instruments reflect the true talent of this group.  This is definitely one of my top favorite albums of all time.  I only hope that this group can come out with another collection soon!
B002ZG997C|4.0|My wife and I put this in the blu-ray player not knowing a thing other than it had D. Washington in it and it was some kind of post war movie.  It was truly a treat and at the end we were close to putting the movie right back in to see what we might have missed.  You do need a good suspension of disbelief some for this however(hence the 4 stars).  The fight scenes are over the top from the first swing and it would be generous to say that some of the background information on the war was a \\"stretch\\".    however the overall plot was really fun to watch unfold and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a fun night in.
B0042RJWTC|4.0|Of course, this series wasn't historically accurate all of the time, but I loved the characters and the costumes and took it for what it was.  The later seasons especially seemed to have spent half their budget on the clothes and jewelry and I adored it.      The first season was my least favorite, but then the story picked up and I enjoyed the rest and didn't want to see it end.  My feelings swung back and forth between hating and admiring Henry, between disliking and feeling sorry for some of his doomed wives (especially the flamboyant Anne B.), and I found it very emotionally engaging overall.  If you get involved with the characters like I did, you will forgive much on other aspects.  If history is your thing, then not so much.    Overall, costume drama buffs...go for it!  Well worth the money and the time.  I've already recommended it to several friends who like this sort of thing.
0452289963|5.0|This book changed my life. As I read the book, I reflected a lot of what it was saying to my own life, and got a lot out of it.    The language is concise. The format of the book, exploring ego to the relation of the impermanence of life, really eases you into understanding how ego creates suffering. The connections it makes with comparisons to two major world religions - Buddism and Christianity - gives a starting point to think about the interconnectedness of faiths and thus is a really approachable read. Reading 'A New Earth' isn't about adopting new ideas, so much as it is redefining one's individual belief systems.    Since reading the book, I've regained serious focus in my life. I often repeat a lot of some things I've learned from the book to myself when I need to regain peace of mind, such as, \\"Just BE,\\" or \\"the quality of the present moment dictates your future\\". But most importantly, I've been able to find that my life purpose is living in the present moment, because given the rarity of the universe and my and everyone's position in it, we are all expressing something so much bigger than out mortal existence every moment. (Basically, meditating on life's impermanence has given me great strength and I don't fear life's challenges anymore.)    I recommend this book to every friend of mine whose not where they wanna be in life but want an option, or a new way of looking at things. Would make a great gift for anyone being hospitalized and healing, family members who struggle with someone in their family who hasn't converted to their faith, or graduate students. Basically, I think it's the kind of book that if you're ready for it, it'll find you.

0765326353|5.0|With Robert Jordan dead and his series nearly done, and George R. R. Martin taking six years off between installments of his magnus opus, suffice it to say I've been waiting a long time for someone to write something groundbreaking enough to excite me again. Reasonably impressed with Brandon Sanderson's previous \\"Mistborn\\" trilogy, I decided the give his latest behemoth a throw.    This one's a winner! Sanderson's first book of a planned ten volume series is quite long. This isn't a deterrent for me unless long also means long-winded and short on excitement, which certainly isn't the case here. Rather, it's a long, sweeping epic tale of duty, honor, sacrifice, betrayal and redemption.    Sanderson skillfully weaves together the varied tales of his main characters, each completely different in tone but equally entertaining in their own right. There are also plenty of secondary character \\"interludes\\" that seem to always leave more questions than answers as to how they will eventually tie into the rest of the story, which drives the sense of excitement.    The foundations for a truly great series are here folks. I can't wait for the next volume!
B004DMIIOG|5.0|When I first anticipated this movie, I was hoping to be immersed in the cyber reality of the social network of OZ. I thought the characters would spend most of their time as their avatars. What I got was much better. Not a sci-fi fantasy like the Matrix or Tron but a character study in family relationships. This film was entirely fullfilling as we got to see this extended family come together through all of their difficulties and to work through their differences to accept each other as they are. After all no one is perfect. I especially liked the redemptive quality this film conveys. It truly offers a perspective about what is important in life.

B003UESJH4|5.0|What an absolutely, lovely film. Collin Firth shows a maturity that is unsurpassed. Geoffrey Rush, plays the role of the \\"speech teacher\\" for the King (Collin Firth). His methods and scenes with the king touch our hearts to the core. Helen Carter was wonderful in showing that unconditional love needed in such a way, that we learn all great men are sustained by their gentlewomen. One word comes to mind: AUTHENTIC. The simplicity of the story, the comfort in the routine of a life, just a generation or so before ours, I found decidedly comforting. That individual were just going about their life, albeit a Royal life, doing the best they could under extraordinary circumstances. There is no flashing technology or concepts, just the deep, life-changing story of two men who overcome class separation and become great friends and in some ways, the backbone for the prince (and then king's) duties. It is quiet, tender, and a big reminder of how we should all be to each other. We never know the impact for good we can have on another life.<br /><br />I do have a small problem with one part of the whole movie. This movie is the perfect companion to youth studying WWII. This movie captures the period phenomenally. Our generation desperately needs to experience this history. So I will say it: Why did it have to have 10 F-bombs instead of 2 in order to keep it a PG-13? (Yes, PG-13 have at least one these days.) I completely understand the \\"why\\" and the \\"context\\" of the speech practice. Couldn't there have been any other way? There are few, solid, amazing historical films coming out and this one could supplement classrooms all over the world... except for that stinking \\"R.\\" I took the chance with my 13 & 14 year olds' who we home school (which is strictly against our policy.) Certainly those two scenes could have been modified to reach the kind of audience that really wants and needs to see it. In the end, they were quite funny
0143116738|5.0|Life changing. If you'd like to gain perspective on how academica is not the only path to success, get this book. (Especially if you were where I was 4 years ago - graduated from high school, not accepted into the top-tier schools, and feeling terrible about all the hard work I did do.)     And read 'A New Earth' right after it. Both will change your perspective on how education is something life-fulfilling, and not institutions you pay to sell off your skills to the highest bidder.

B002SSUQFG|5.0|Despite its modest price, this little Seiko 5 \\"field\\" watch has fast become my favorite everyday timepiece. Its case diameter is very small by modern standards (about 36mm), which is perfect for those of us with smaller wrists. While some may be disappointed by the watch's Malaysian-made movement, it's kept impeccable time over the month I've worn it, deviating on average +5sec/day - friends of mine sporting Swiss automatics have been blown away by such accuracy at this price point. Run time hasn't been an issue either - I've had it off my wrist for as long as 14 hours and come back to find it ticking away.    Sure, the strap is nothing to rave about and the crystal could have been of a higher grade, but come on - who'd expect more at this price? If you've been pining for an affordable but beautifully assembled automatic, look no further.
0756404738|3.0|I really don't see what the fuss is about with this novel.  Like its predecessor, \\"Wise Man's Fear\\" reads like some sort of aborted attempt to copy a Harry Potter book, which in itself is a copy of a hundred others.  After all, here we have an orphan, living in a university which teaches magic, looking for revenge for the murder of his parents at the hands of some evil dark magicians.  Sound familiar?  Oh, and the kid is really bright and pisses off some hamfisted rich kid the minute he gets to the university, but with the help of a few of his friends, foils plot after plot, etc.  You get the idea.  The second novel stays way too long at the University and keeps going over the same plot devices which dragged the first book into the ground.  Our Hero keeps fighting with the rich kid.  Our Hero has no money.  Our hero plays the lute.  Our Hero pursues the Girl of His Dreams for no apparent reason.        When Our Hero finally leaves the university, due to a barely explained and rather implausible development, the book actually picks up a bit,  Unfortunately, we go right back to extremely predictable, tired plot contrivances again.  Our Hero saves a rich king from being poisoned by his minion.  (Why, is never explained.)  Our hero takes command of a small group of older, more experienced warriors and proves his mettle under duress.  Our Hero goes to a secret school to learn the arts of warfare.  Our Hero meets a lovely fairy girl and has lots and lots of sex. (Good for him!)  When Our Hero finally gets back to the University, also with the help fo the author's editor or I imagine this book would be even longer, he goes right back to doing the absolutely nothing he did for the first 500 pages of this novel and the last 500 of the one published several years ago.      Don't get me started on the ridiculous relationship Our Hero has with his \\"girlfriend\\".      The sad part is that this author can really write.  He's very talented.  The back story of this novel, where OurHero is a bit older and basically hiding out to forget his past, is far more interesting than the actual tale.  The author shines in these short interludes, as he did in the first book, and it's kind of a shame this part of the story isn't expanded upon more.  Maybe that will happen when the next book is published, however many years from now.  I hope the next book at least leaves me guessing once or twice.
B004I2K4DY|2.0|I caught parts of this show on public television last night while I was channel surfing.  Who did the casting for this?   All the talent in the world available and this was the best cast they could come up with?  Three (three!) of the leads don't sing at all, they spend a considerable amount of time just speaking on pitch (not the same thing at all).  I am almost at a loss for words.  Yes, the acting was acceptable, but this is musical that is all about the music.  Yet they couldn't find a cast who can sing?  Really?  The reason I only caught parts of the show last night was it was so poorly sung I found myself squirming until I just had to change the channel.  Not an exaggeration.  Granted I am a classical musician, maybe if you have a wooden ear you won't care, I don't know, it looks fine and seems well acted even compared to the 10th Anniversary show, but the singers from the 10th Anniversary show can STILL sing circles around this cast 15 years later.      Bottom line: For my money, if you are looking for a Les Miserables DVD to buy, this one is simply not it.  Get the 10th Anniversary.
0061914177|3.0|I enjoyed this book. It was inspiring. I felt Gary a relatable guy. He gives a good overview of how to look at the power of the internet and how to eventually make money being you, basically. It's a good book to look into if you'd like to get started living a life sharing what you love. He offers information about what to look for in setting up a site, affiliates, and great insight that would help get the gears turning.    As a caveat, although 'Crush It' is good spring board, the book does not offer enough contextually to sustain starters through the process of crushing it for real, in which case you'll need to look more into it. And advocating \\"hussling\\" or meritocracy denies the author's privilege of growing up under the wing of his father's legacy, who was a business man.    The idea of the book is that if you offer a good product, no one will deny you. And even then, there is always a market, even if it's niche. He offers that it's never too late to start and jump into the game, and to use the online community to make your work better, you're ready to take on the next big challenge.    That's what I like about the book is that everything is a process, and Gary makes good light of that that everything doesn't happen over night. However, it does take consistent effort, passion, and being completely honest with yourself and to always challenge your work so that you don't put out anything that stinks.    It's a great starting point. I'd recommend the book. And I hear his 'Thank You Economy' book is even more contextually solid. If 'Crush It!' was a preliminary sells pitch to 'Thank You Economy', well, then I've been had. But I think 'Crush It' fulfilled what it needed to at the time, which was to offer the idea that the gate of entry for business is zero and it's a great place to be if you want to eventually cash in on your passion.
B002ZG976U|5.0|I loved this movie!I can't wait to buy it,from amazon, when i get money.Who knew that Cam Gigande and Xtina would have this love story in the movie.I didn't.It was greatly appreciated!And the famous Amos cookie scene where Jack was drunk,was hillarious:)Loved him as the villian in Twilight? Now,love hime as the romantically sweet guy that sweeps Ali off her feet.And a guest cameo of Quin from glee as the evil girlfriend-bitc-.Cher and Christina had a mother daughter chemistry in their roles, as well.Plus,the songs were so great like \\"I'm a good girl,\\"Burlesque,both versions and Cher's solo's.Ugh! Yummy.Just thinking about jack's cookies makes me want some Famous Amos chocolate chip cookies when I rent the movie again.Loved Kristen Bell,and Julianne Hough in it too.Esp that Kristen was a huge BITC_.I loved to hate her.So,sit back and watch this movie with some popcorn and cookies and don't forget the milk.Screw what the critic's said and decide for yourself and welcome to Burlesque!!!!!!:)
0670022411|2.0|Like many others, I wanted to like this book. Unfortunately the characters are so thinly developed that the story quickly seems tired.  I think Harkness had a great idea here, but the unbelievable characters just ruin it.  Our heroine is a fainting beauty with a PhD and a pointy hat, while her love interest is every vampire story you've ever read rolled into a tall, dark, handsome, pale, intellectual, strong....and so on. There is no spark, no reason to want to know them.  I won't be purchasing the second (or third, fourth) edition of this slumberfest.  And trust me, after you finish you'll be tempted to through out every pair of stretchy black pants in your wardrobe.  You will be completely sick of them!
B0031RAOVY|5.0|If you don't believe that a dog is your   best loyal friend in life ...watch this wonderful movie!
B0019UGYK0|5.0|I'm only 19 and have taken a real shine to older films, Cool Hand Luke is one of my favorites. This film has all the right elements drama,comedy,irony, intelligence,escapism-I could be listing for days. This movie is also very engaging and makes you think, which I love.The variety of characters leaves no dull moment in this film, and Paul Newman's performance is nothing less than excellent.If you want the full experience I suggest reading the book(you can find it here on Amazon)then watching the film. I highly recommend.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this movie: smooth, smart, well paced, and funny, with enough of a plot to hold it all together but not enough to obsess over.  What else do you need to know?
B00000JGOJ|5.0|I have to admit, with how cheap it was for a brand new movie and no tracking information, I really thought I was going to be ripped off, but this thing is perfect. It's not ruined, it's brand new, it arrived rather quickly, and  there is nothing wrong. If only it wasn't wide-screened haha. This is a really great product.

1591843790|5.0|Before reading this book \\"enchant\\" wasn't even an active word in my dictionary. Now after reading Guy Kawasaki's book Enchantment, I have a new understanding on bring about change from other in a voluntary way. I recommend this book to anyone who desires a new way of bringing about change in a positive way to benefit their great cause.    This book has truly enchanted me, now one day I hope to consider myself a great enchanter.
B003UESJHO|5.0|Just watched this film last night and I was surprised by how good it was .   The acting was superb by all the cast - Mark Wahlberg took a back seat to the more flamboyant charcater , Dicky Ecklund, played by Christian Bale who deserved the Oscar , but that is not to discount Wahlberg.  The real Mickey Ward was always deferring to his older stepbrother who was his hero as a kid .     Amy Adams is out of \\" good girl\\" character as a fesity barmaid who fights her man;s family when she feels they are sabotaging him -  this adds to the feeling that Mickey is the submissive brother and Wahlberg nails the character .      Melissa Leo is on spot as the tough mom of nine (1)  who seems to favor the black sheep , Dickey - awesome performance .     The boxing scenes are old school and and reminiscent of the days of classic boxing .  Actually,  this film motivated me to look up and view some of the actual footage between Neary and Ward and Ward  and Gotti , the much more lucrative and well known fights of his career . What a lot of heart Irish Mickey Ward had !  I am glad they made this film so that his efforts and hard luck story could be portrayed .   If you like movies like CInderella Man and  Raging Bull ,this film is right up there with them .

0790740443|5.0|As the review title says, this is a fun action movie that doesn't require any deep thinking.  If you want to unwind and are into sci-fi and action, this is a movie for you.  Don't look for any more than that out of this movie.  Just relax and have fun in this story of genetically modified soldiers.

1591843790|4.0|This is a light as a feather volume that makes complicated points directly, without endless justifications, and cheerfully. Worth the quick read to keep you on your toes and stepping lively.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|This movie was a hoot! The villain is strangely attractive, the orphans are sad and funny at the same time and the minions make the movie. I haven't laughed this much at a movie in a long, long time! So glad we added this our collection. Watch it, you won't be sorry!
0345528581|5.0|This book is so easy to read & follow!  The author breaks everything down simply.  And the exercises are so simple & extremely effective!  They really work!  This book is fantastic!  I highly recommend for anyone of any fitness level!
044656740X|1.0|This book seems to be written at a 4th grade level.  Granted it does have some sound advice on saving vs. spending and liabilities vs. assets, but most of the book seems more along the lines of basic Republican rhetoric than actual sound fiscal advice.      Take page 99 for example \\"Average Americans today work five to six months for the government before they make enough to cover their taxes.\\"  I wasn't aware of a 50% tax rate on middle class workers.  The rhetoric is so strong through out the book, a constant theme of the evil government coming for your taxes.      Page 96 says that originally in England and America there were no taxes, are they talking about the stone age?  Taxes have been collected for thousands of years, it's how a government exist in the first place.      The writer refers to his father on page 98 as a socialist, because he works as a principal, aka, that evil entity the government.      If you want a real book on how to grow rich instead of a front row seat at CPAC convention check out a real book on how to growth wealthy, there are many out there.  I was recommended this book and have been utterly disappointed, an absolute waste of time.

B00000JNO1|5.0|Ever since the winter of 2010, Lynyrd Skynyrd has quickly become one of my all-time favorite rock bands. I instantly fell in love with their first two albums, and now with their third, I continue to immerse myself in their excellent music. Nuthin' Fancy is just as great as Leh-Nerd Skin-Nerd and Second Helping. The songs are typically catchy and engaging. \\"Saturday Night Special\\" is a great opener. \\"Cheatin' Woman\\" is flawless; I can find nothing wrong about the music (the lyrics, however, are pretty questionable, but I still love the song). \\"Railroad Song\\" and \\"I'm a Country Boy\\" are fun, while \\"On the Hunt\\" becomes a song that'll stay in the mind for years. \\"Made in the Shade\\" is pretty cool, but \\"Am I Losin'\\" and \\"Whiskey Rock-a-Roller\\" are even better. The last two tracks, which are taken from live performances back in 1975, are worthwhile on this reissue.<br /><br />There's no denying it. Lynyrd Skynyrd rocks! I love their music and I love their legacy. It's completely sad that Ronnie Van Sant and Steve & Cassie Gaines were killed just two years after the release of Nuthin' Fancy, but the music of Skynyrd lives on.<br /><br />Grade: 9.9/10<br /><br />Also from Lynyrd Skynyrd<br />Pronounced Leh-nerd Skin-Nerd (9.8/10) [[ASIN:B00005RIKI Pronounced Leh-Nerd Skin-Nerd]]<br />Second Helping (9.8/10) [[ASIN:B000002P74 Second Helping (Reis)]]
B002F6FQGK|5.0|This album is incredible, and Florence Welch's voice is to die for! It's completely out of this world! I've been listening to this album for a year now and it completely gets better and better everytime. The lyrics are powerful and poetic. This is an amazing album.    If you want to listen to RAW, POWERFUL talent, than Florence + The Machine is for you!  Everything about them is perfect.    My Top 5  1. Cosmic Love  2. Dog Days Are Over  3. Rabbit Heart (Raise It Up)  4. Blinding  5. Drumming Song
B003Z2LAAO|5.0|This film looks very nice in 3-d. I purchased it because I saw a small glimpse of it in a demo at best buy in 3-d.
1591843790|5.0|It was awesome to be included on the list of reviewers of Guy Kawasaki's latest publication titled Enchantment: The Art of Changing Hearts, Minds, and Actions. The book was indeed enchanting.  An enthralling read from page to page. Enchantment gently yet firmly led me deeper into the whole philosophy of Guy's experiential and measurable capabilities as a successful writer, Apple evangelist and entrepreneur.    I'm definitely going to be re-reading this book many times, as I have only covered the tip of the iceberg with my first pass.    Enchantment has opened up my mind to many more ways to Enchant my Visualmapper colleagues, clients and especially myself.  Guy has laid out the book as a series of natural flowing processes that connect with each other in a very wholistic format. The pages are full of those aHa revelations we often often experience as profound change moments.
0525951652|5.0|This is the first of Ken Follett's books that I've read, so I don't know how it compares to his earlier ones. But if they're anything like his latest, I've got a lot of catching up to do. This is the first of three books that Follett will write to complete his trilogy and based on this first one, I'm anxiously awaiting the next volume.    With Fall of Giants Follett provides a fascinating perspective of world events that took place during roughly the first 25 years of the 20th Century. The book's main characters, (and there are many) are spread out accross the globe - America, Great Britain, France, Germany, Austria, and Russia. These characters' lives intersect with each other in compelling ways as the world events transpire that bring about World War I.     In addition to the fictional characters, real life characters from the time period are included - Woodrow Wilson, Vladimir Lenin, and Winston Churchill to name just a few. Follett does a fantastic job of providing an insight into their lives by frequently using things that they said in real life.     If I didn't make it clear already, I really enjoyed this book. It has the same feel and depth as books that I've read by Dickens and Dostoevsky. It reads like classic literature. It was both entertaining as well as educational. It made me want to read non-fictional accounts of the time period along with the biographies of its pivitol players.
1591843790|5.0|There are plenty of business and leadership books out there that center around the same theme, \\"If you follow these suggestions or behave this way it will help market you as an individual, improve your business's brand or sell your product.\\" Most say about the same thing and accomplish nothing new. So why did Guy Kawasaki feel compelled to address this in his most recent book? Probably because he is an expert at it and brings a new spin to an old theme. Guy's book was well organized and interesting. The personal stories at the end of each chapter were a great way to illustrate his points. Quick read and very helpful as you develop relationships in your personal and professionals lives (and the many places in between).
B004EQAVHI|4.0|There have been several well-written reviews on this film and I will only voice my views on this<br />exceptional film.<br />I was unable to finish the book so I have some knowledge of the story before viewing the film.<br />It is a very well adapted, produced and executed film with flawless performances from the 3 lead<br />actors, Carey Mulligan in particular.  She carried the whole film and had never been better.<br />The writer and the director formulated the film with all the right moves, mood, period setting, casting,<br />photography, music, tempo.........<br />It is a thought provoking film.<br />Is it a cautionary tale?<br />How do we define a human being?<br />What are the limits of scientific research and practice?<br />What are we?<br />A well-made film adaption of a novel although cannot meet everyone's taste.
1591843790|5.0|\\"Enchantment\\" is a superior self-help book. There are trillions of books out there for people who want to get serious about their lives, about creating a business, a company, a presence, a successful future.<br /><br />Guy, Kawasaki, former \\"chief evangelist of Apple,\\" co-founder of Alltop.com, a founding partner at Garage Technology Ventures, and a prolific author, details how to change the world by changing your ability to interact with and inspire others to hop on your success bandwagon and ride it to the stars.<br /><br />What impressed me most about this book is that it covers every angle, every aspect of growth and change, every aspect of influencing others from harnessing technology and social media to re-forming ourselves in the myriad ways that, when all put together, spell out accomplishment and success.<br /><br />Some of the topics in his book include: \\"How to Achieve Likability,\\" \\"Create Win-Win Situations,\\" \\"Be a Mensch,\\" \\"Be a Hero,\\" \\"Set Yourself Up for Success,\\" \\"How To Overcome Resistance,\\" \\"Position Yourself,\\" \\"Catalyze Commitment and Consistency,\\" \\"How to Use Push Technology,\\" \\"Look Far into the Future,\\" \\"Know Your Limitations,\\" \\"Beware of Pseudo Salience, Data and Experts,\\" and \\"Underpromise, Overdeliver.\\" I could go on and on. This book does not waste words.<br /><br />I perceive myself as a superior quotemeister. When I first started tweeting a couple of years ago i gleaned some of the finest quotes out there to inspire and motivate others, to encourage them to think and challenge their presumptions and biases.<br /><br />So it is no small thing when I tell you that the quotes Guy Kawasaki peppers throughout his book, which is packed full of massively valuable information guaranteed to advance your career and improve your life, are incredibly brilliant and powerful, possibly worth the price of the book all by themselves if taken to heart.<br /><br />I leave you with one of his quotes I particularly enjoyed: \\"Diplomacy is the art of letting someone else have your way.\\" ~ Daniele Vare.

B000W7JWUA|5.0|Settlers of Catan is easily the most fun and challenging board game I have ever played.  Every game is vastly different from the ones before, and the play length is perfect at about 30 minutes per.  Instead of a board game that everyone grows tired of by the time you're half way through, or where half of the players have been eliminated and have nothing to do- Catan keeps all players in the game until the end.  Different tactics allow for many different ways to win the game ahead of your friends, and this is one of a few games where you can really get inside the heads of your opponents through trading (or not trading) resources.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|C'mon, give Nick some slack.     This is a great performance all around- really, you definitely should buy it! But what I want to address is all of the reviewers casting aspersions on Nick's performance as Marius. Watching it for the first time, I had no idea who played the part of Marius. I was so impressed with his voice and acting that I looked up the show on imdb.com and, to my amazement- whoah! it's Nick Jonas! In the past I have INTENSELY disliked the Jonas brothers, simply based on the fact that they are Disney pop sensations, and we all know what usually happens to Disney pop sensations. Nick's performance as Marius, however, has caused me to take a second look at him. He has actually undertaken a serious acting/singing role, and done it well!     Perhaps there is more to this brother than meets the eye...
B004ECFW94|5.0|I am writing this review (with all due respect) to counter the review below that advises Placido Domingo to give up singing baritone roles.  Domingo is a great artist whose longevity on the operatic scene is a source of admiration to me.  While he is no longer a young singer, he has matured as an artist and as an actor.  All this is evident from his performance here as Simon Boccanegra which is moving and heart-felt.  I do not believe this is Mr. Domingo's attempt to have a second career as a baritone, it is simply that he CAN sing this role and he brings so much to it.  At this stage in his career and with all the gifts that he has given us over the years, if he wants to sing a baritone role, I would say go for it.  I would like to also point out that many years ago when he was singing all the great tenor roles, he recorded Figaro in the Barber of Seville (another baritone role).  Some of these baritone roles have a high tessitura and they could easily be sung by a dramatic tenor.  I also would like to point out that Adrienne Pieczonka is marvelous singer and great artist.  For me any chance to see her perform is a great occasion.  I do not believe for a second that she is having an off night in this DVD.
B0041KKYCY|5.0|Ok the rape seen got me angry, but thats great because it made me happy when she tortured each guy Saw style! Why on earth would a girl be in the woods in a cabin all by herself is beyond me. I never saw the first version so I had again no expectations. I liked it. If you can get past the rape scene its actually worth watching and enjoyable.
159562015X|1.0|I have read horoscopes with more insight.      Weak analysis  Weak use of terminology  Weak questions  Weak test design  ... overall, a very poor attempt.  How disappointing.

B000PMLFRA|5.0|It's honestly sad, how absolutely pathetic and disgusting you people are who gave this 1 star. Deal with it, or buy something else. Why even click on it if you don't like it? You think George Lucas reads these reviews, then has an epiphany while he stares at his screen, gets depressed, goes for a long, silent, lonely walk, and rethinks his life's decisions? Are you kidding me?    If you don't like the DVD, don't buy it.    Five stars, ALL of the Star Wars movies are great, in ALL of their forms...then again, I don't live in a room covered in the merchandise, in my mother's basement.
B003Q6D282|3.0|Well well, let's hope this was the last one. Somehow, the traps repeat themselvs. Although the story of the last one is not bad, it is a \\"have-seen-before\\" thing. To complete the series.
0765309408|3.0|While enjoyable and well crafted, this novel lacks subtlety and will not leave any lasting literary impact.  Old Man's War is a another chapter in the long history of pulp fiction that has long been a mainstay of the science fiction genre, it has a visceral appeal with action, space-battles, and techno-magic, but does not have a compelling plot or characters, nor does it feature any particularly original thoughts.     If you are looking for an easy reading, entertaining space opera-like novel, then I recommend this book.  I would ignore the comparisons to Starship Troopers, for while this book has similar features, it lacks the superior prose and originality of Heinlein's much earlier seminal work, and you would (like I was) only be disappointed.  Take this book for what is, and you will enjoy it, expect more from it, and you will be disappointed by it.
1439102724|5.0|is that the book had to end, and now I'll have to wait for Ms. Picoult's next book!  This one was in my top 5 of her wonderful novels.  The characters are deep and rich, and the writing is as if she's telling you the story directly, rather than writing it, so there are no $10 words where they don't belong.  I don't want to give away the ending, but I'm guessing that if there's a movie based on this book, the ending will be different than in the book, as it was for My Sister's Keeper.  I didn't listen to any of the music while I was reading, but that's not why I bought the book.
1594202842|4.0|Kudos to Amy for able to create the hype, buzz around this book, which has little to do with parenting. It is a memoir of a Chinese American mother/wife, her journey to bring up her kids, her relationships with the kids, her escape with the dogs, her own relationships with her parents. Candidly written; the only drawback is the ending; which ends so abruptly that almost leave you stupefied, dazed, yet a big smile on your face.

B000002JNN|1.0|Yes, as a disabled person on SSI, I was happy with the price for an album I love.  Iwas looking forward to having this album again, since it was amongs 30 that have meant something to me, which I had collected over the past 18 years.  I received my package in the mail, as I should have.  Opened it, finding the proper cd case.  Opening that, I found a DIFFERENT cd of AC/DC.  Not that I wouldn't eventually have considered purchasing this other album, but I don't really think I have any interrest in going thru this seller again, since I am getting NO RESPONSE in regard to correcting the seller's error.  The seller only has 1 option to right this, which is covering the cost to return the incorrect item and send me the correct item.<br />[[ASIN:B00008WT5M Razor's Edge (Dlx)]]
B000089RV6|5.0|It's unbelievable how Back In Black rocks. Been listening to it since its release in July 1980 and it just keeps getting dangerously better and better! With its iconic black and white cover, it actually delivers more than it promises.     Gutted and inspired by terrible loss, AC/DC never sounded so focused and fresh - somehow the guitars are perfectly balanced sounding clear and strong and the pounding of the bass/drums a joy to listen to. Comprised only of first class riffs, this is no noise pollution: this is hard rock and roll at its very best.    For Brian Johnson to have come and replaced the irreplaceable Bon Scott the way he did was no small feat, this being totally against the odds as Scott's voice and charisma were at the core of the band's signature sound.      And just how unthinkable was it for AC/DC and Brian Johnson to have pulled this off from start to finish by releasing Back In Black less than five months after Bon Scott's untimely death? Time was definitely running at a different pace then. Or was it some type of magic delivered by a couple of very talented Young men?    The digipak remastered edition released in 2003 is the one to get and bears outstanding sound quality capable of keeping the neighbours at bay for the duration of the album... this if you don't consider pressing play to start it all over again...
B000MGUZM0|5.0|Neon Bible takes a few spins to digest properly but the more you listen, the more you appreciate. I found some songs such as \\"Ocean Of Noise\\" and \\"My Body Is A Cage\\" to be mesmerizing. You will get your money's worth on this CD because there is so much going on musically, you will make a new discovery upon each listen.
B0041KKYCY|3.0|It is not as boring as the original, the revenge scenes are much harder than in the original.  But it has something of SAW, HOSTEL and so on at the end. Nevertheless it is discusting (in a good horror way!).
B0034G4OXQ|4.0|This movie did not turn out to be what I was expecting. Movie trailers quite often paint a different picture of a movie than what it actually is, and that is the case here.  This being said, I still enjoyed this film.      It is not a grand masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination, but that's fine.  Not every film I see has to be.  This story revolves around three individuals, and their experience with death.  One listens to the dead, one has a near-death experience, and one loses his twin brother.  The common thread in the film is that all three struggle to cope with their experience with death.  They each try to run away from it, try to understand it better, or try to bring closure to it.  The story finally brings the three characters together, and we see that they are united by the one thing that eludes them...death.      I thought the movie was well made, except perhaps for the beginning few things and the ghastly special effects during the tsunami. I think they could have simply done without that, and shown the French woman sinking in the water having her visions, which in the end is what we were to take away from her experience during the tragic circumstances she endured.     In good Clint Eastwood fashion, the film advances at a pace that allows the viewer to see the characters for what they are intended to be.  The movie is slow at times, but not disturbingly so.  It is meant to be.  I think there is meaning in each scene, and that is what I enjoyed.  In the end, we see that no matter what we do, death is always present, and is part of the cycle of life.      I gave this film a 4-star rating, mainly to offset the 1 or 2-star ratings it received, which I believe are not merited here.  I think a true rating would be a 3 1/2 star, which I believe this movie is currently receiving.  It is definitely worth seeing.

I would strongly recommend if you would like to buy an HDMI cable on the cheap. I have bought expensive cables in the past, not worth the money. On negative I would give it is that the swivel adapter is more bulky then I expected. I bought this cable because [[ASIN:B001QXDSP4 Sony DLCHD20V Vertical Swivel High Speed HDMI Cables (2 meters)]] cable had broke. This cable was slightly more sleek.<br /><br />Overall I would recommend any of the AmazonBasics cables.
0061743526|5.0|I'm 50 years old, and my mother taught me to read before I ever started school. I earned three English degrees and have spent a lifetime reading. And \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" is the single best novel I've ever read. Not only does it capture a time and a place flawlessly, but it describes the most important actions we can ever make in life--how to do the right thing no matter how unpleasant the consequences. It's about how to be tolerant and open-minded and to think for oneself, in the midst of a society that is small and petty and selfish and mean. Human nature being what it is, I hope this novel lives in reprints for the next 500 years.
1585104205|5.0|This is a list of important resources for self-learners, through Pars I-Familia Romana; followed by critical remarks concerning the later chapters of the book, and the passage into Pars II-Roma Aeterna:<br /><br />(Since reviewers are prohibited from giving more than 10 product links per review, I shall note only the ISBN numbers for some of the volumes mentioned; all are available on Amazon.)<br /><br />1. This has been mentioned in other reviews--the exercise book for Vol I: ISBN1585102121. Numerous 'fill-in-the-blank'-type exercises, that have been very well designed; they really help consolidate the material introduced in each chapter.<br /><br />2. The answer key to all the end-of-chapter drills (the Pensa), and exercise books, for *both* Vol.1 Familia Romana, and Vol.2 Roma Aeterna: ISBN1585100749. Indispensable for self-learners.<br /><br />3. Audiobook/CD-ROMs: Ørberg himself has recorded the first 31 chapters of Pars I (There are 35 in total), which recordings have been released by Focus Publishing in two different formats: The first ten chapters are available as an audio cd ([[ASIN:1585101923 Lingua Latina: Latine Audio (Audio CD ONLY) Chapters 1-10 only from \\"Familia Romana\\" (Latin Edition) (Pt. 1)]]); which I believe is enough to get a sense of what the language is supposed to sound like. The remaining 21 chapters are available, as mp3 files, only in cd-rom editions of the series, of which there are several releases.<br /><br />The release for Mac OS X, ([[ASIN:8790696131 Lingua Latina: (MAC OS X) CD-Rom of Familia Romana, Roma Aeterna, Excertia Latina I & II & Grammatica Latina (Latin Edition)]]) contains all recordings, exercise books for both parts of the text, and both parts of the text itself. In the PC edition, the same material has been spread out to 4 CD-ROMS (the editions are priced accordingly; each PC volume is 1/4 the price of the complete set for Mac). For the text of Pars I, the interactive Pensa, and the sound recordings, see: [[ASIN:8790696085 Lingua Latina: (PC/CD-ROM) Pars I: Familia Romana-Interactive CD Rom (Latin Edition)]]. Exercise book for Pars I: [[ASIN:8790696107 Lingua Latina CD: Exercitia Latina I (Latin Edition)]]. For Roma Aeterna: [[ASIN:8790696093 Lingva Latina: Interactive Latin Course, Pars II: Roma Aeterna (PC) (Lingua Latina) (Latin Edition)]]; and [[ASIN:8790696123 Lingua Latina: Exercitia Latina II (PC/CD-ROM) (Latin Edition) (No. 2)]].<br /><br />It is *essential* to the study of Latin, to have a correct sense of how the language is pronounced. While this may sound like a truism, what is at stake in pronouncing Latin correctly is more than just elegance; often the proper declension of a word is conveyed through the duration of vowels--and in a completely inflected language like Latin, word order is of *no* help in determining the meaning of an unintelligibly declined word. Besides, Latin verse is meant to be read aloud; so having some understanding of correct pronunciation really is a prerequisite to enjoying a huge portion the literature. Thus, the audio component of Lingua Latina is very highly recommended.<br /><br />(Having said that, I should add the following: The accents of Latin are not at all as difficult as those of Greek: There are no 'tonic' accents, no 'rough and smooth breathings', and the like; there are, as in English, stressed and unstressed syllables, but there are also long and short vowels--the long vowels in *all* cases, are indicated by Ørberg, via 'macrons'. For the *beginning student*, these are of fundamental importance; without the appropriate macrons, it is all too easy to conflate conjugations. Academic editions, on the other hand, such as the OCT, as well as the Loeb Library, do not go through the trouble of notating macrons for their Latin publications (while Greek enjoys that privilege to the full)--that omission might be tolerable for advanced students, but again, for the beginner, macrons and pronunciation are *vital*. One may also note thatØrberg's pronunciation does not *fully* confirm to the guidelines set by the standard work on the subject, Sidney Allen's Vox Latina (ISBN9780521379366); most notably, he ignores the nasalized 'final m'. I cannot help but think, however, that this was entirely intentional, and that Ørberg wanted to eliminate a fine, but to the beginner's ear, unessential and potentially confusing feature in the interests of simplicity. A more recent work on Latin as a spoken language is Clive Brooks's \\"Reading Latin Poetry Aloud\\" (ISBN9780521874496); this book comes with two audio CDs, containing slightly more than 2 hours of Latin poetry--'classic' as well as medieval. The list price is too high ['hardcover academic title with 2 cds' is always a good excuse, apparently, to charge for 'an arm and a leg']; but look for used/like-new offers from Marketplace sellers; it's possible to get a practically new copy for one sixth the list price.)<br /><br />4. Additional Reading Material: Ørberg has edited several readers for the benefit of students who have finished Familia Romana (links provided below); as an accompaniment to chapters 1-24 of this first part, however, he has also written a short reader, the Colloquia Personarum ([[ASIN:1585101567 Lingua Latina: Colloquia Personarum]]).<br /><br />Focus has also published a successor volume to the Colloquia Personarum, the 'Fabulae Syrae' by Luigi Miraglia (ISBN: 9781585104284). Not only is the text beautifully written in 'Ørbergian' style, but also the edition has all the standard features of the series: Fully notated macrons, rich marginal notes, etc. It's indispensable extra-reading material, while working through the last few chapters of Familia Romana.<br /><br />A similar publication by Focus is \\"Epitome Historiae Sacrae\\"; the text is that of an older series of simplified 'stories from the bible', this edition has all the standard 'student-friendly' features of other 'Lingua Latina' publications. I think that this is a lot less essential than the 'Fabulae Syrae', though. The ISBN is: 9781585104253.<br /><br />To be read right after Familia Romana--abridged/annotated editions of Caesar and Plautus: ISBN1585102326 (Caesar); ISBN8799701677 (Plautus); the 'Sermones Romani', a collection of heavily edited excerpts from major Latin authors ISBN8790696077.<br /><br />5. A handy little booklet that contains grammar charts: ISBN1585102237<br /><br />6. These are not by Ørberg -- a) the Barrons' book of 501 Latin Verbs, ISBN0764137425. Latin verbs are a little tough; but the intricate system of conjugations really opens up immense resources for expression; in translation, English or German requires a lot more work (additional phrases, etc.) to convey the sense of a well-placed single Latin conjugation. Since the different root forms of verbs (through the last third of Familia Romana) are about the only thing Ørberg wants to have the student 'memorize', I believe a 'big verbs book' is a must. b) 'Practice Makes Perfect: Latin Verb Tenses', ISBN 0071817832. This is an excellent guide and workbook for practicing some of the more arcane-looking, but essential conjugations of Latin verbs. I *finally* 'got' the function of the ubiquitous 'subjunctive imperfect' after reading through this book's explanation--but see below for more on verbs.<br /><br />7. And these are highly informative and readable sources on the history of Latin, for enthusiasts who do not have expert knowledge in linguistics: Latin Alive [[ASIN:0521734185 Latin Alive: The Survival of Latin in English and the Romance Languages]]; for speakers of French, Spanish, or Italian, a book that consists of sound charts, tracking how Latin mutated into these 'Romance Languages': [[ASIN:087840077X From Latin to Romance in Sound Charts]]; for a very broad historical survey: [[ASIN:0199214050 A Natural History of Latin]].<br /><br />There are also excellent, authoritative online resources for more advanced students; the *immensely* rich Perseus library at Tufts University foremost--which, by the way, is an open source project, and also offers xml versions of their bewilderingly large collection of primary and secondary literature in Latin and Greek. The Philologic project at the University of Chicago also includes an implementation of the Perseus library, which is offered in a simpler interface. Both websites feature very user-friendly editions of the famous Lewis & Short dictionary; as well as morphological tools, word frequency statistics (with detailed citation lists), and so on. German speakers may want to check out 'Lateinseiten.de' as well, especially their 'Konjugator' applet. Lastly, the official website of the Vatican has a complete 'Latin edition', with a large collection of chiefly 'scriptural' texts. (Just 'google' for these websites.)<br /><br />Now, some general remarks on Familia Romana: This book provides by no means a 'magical' method that teaches Latin with little effort on the part of the student; to the contrary, it is quite challenging, and as far as the grammatical foundations of the language are concerned, extremely thorough. Despite what some other reviewers have suggested, neither does the book have the least pretension, as to teaching Latin the way children pick up their first language; *that's not what is meant by 'natural method'*.<br /><br />Every single word of the 'story' in this book has been picked with an amazingly precise sense of where the student is coming from, and in which direction, and in what manner, he or she needs to be guided. (See below for more on this.) There is a perfect balance of repetition and new material--that is, Ørberg never repeats older material for the sake of repetition, but keeps using already drilled grammatical concepts in progressively interesting, varied, challenging contexts; and when he introduces a new concept, he makes sure the student sees examples that are varied enough, so that the 'idea' at work behind them may be grasped.<br /><br />The 'story', by the way, even in the earliest chapters, is never boring, silly, or childish; and there's a good bit of humor, to keep the student's interest, and make the experience all the more enjoyable. Beginners may rest assured that the somewhat disjointed 'tableaux' of the earlier chapters set up in fact the dramatic background, against which it becomes possible for the later chapters to elaborate. The book, in short, respects the student's intelligence.<br /><br />One ought also to keep in mind, that 'Lingua Latina per se Illustrata' is a course of 61 chapters, of which Familia Romana covers the first 35--'thorough' as it may be, concerning the grammatical foundations of the language, there is an important sense in which it does not stand all on its own--let me explain:<br /><br />Just a quick scan through the pages of each volume would suggest that the first volume lays the foundations of the grammar, and that the second volume proceeds to adapted readings from the classics; and it is true that the first volume treats the entire case system, the entire system of conjugations, several of the subtleties of Latin syntax, the imaginative uses to which whole phrases in the ablative can be put, and so on; while the second volume has rather the appearance of an anthology of graded readings. Whence the 'incompleteness'?<br /><br />Now, it is important to note that the ingenuity of Ørberg's 'total immersion' method lies in its pitch-perfect sense of which features of the language have to become salient, and which must recede into the background at every step of the course--and, it is by limiting verb conjugations to the 3rd person singular/plural (active and passive) that Familia Romana is able to work the 'wonders' that it's able to work, in inculcating the case system through the first third or so of the book. It is simply amazing how Ørberg teaches the student to *think in terms of a fully inflected language*, from *within* that system of inflections (as a side note: I think that my German [another 'inflected' language, though not in the same manner as Latin] has benefited considerably from my work in Latin [and Greek 'looks', at least, to be far less mysterious]). It makes perfect sense, furthermore, to rapidly immerse the student in the entire case system right from the start--after all, 'all' the cases are used 'all' the time, often in a single sentence.<br /><br />Yet, the trade-off here is that the complicated sytem of conjugations is held off, until fairly advanced in the book; this is not a problem for the comprehension of the simple 'core' of tenses and moods that are, likewise, used 'all the time', beyond the 3rd person--however, when all of the perfect forms, the many nuances conveyed by the subjunctive, and so on, enter the picture one after the other the student begins to feel more and more detached; chapters begin to look more and more like exercises in memorizing arcane conjugations that seem (deceptively, of course) to be reserved for special occasions; the last third of the book is a lot less 'exciting' than the first third.<br /><br />Everything takes on a new light, however, in chapter 34 of Familia Romana, and the first of the separate 'readers': We're back to using all resources all at the same time, and the strained focus on this or that 'fancy conjugation' leaves its place to the 'excitement' of being able to think in Latin, once again. Needless to say, at this point, the conjugation system, in its *totality*, makes a lot more sense. (Vol. I ends with unadapted excerpts from Catullus!)<br /><br />So, Familia Romana is 'incomplete' only in the sense that towards the end, the 'immersion' appears to lose its grip--but that's only because it will become all the richer, and stable, once we're back into using everything all at the same time, through chapters 34-61, and the readers. I should add, however, that the second volume (Roma Aeterna) is an order of magnitude more challenging than Familia Romana.<br /><br />A final note, concerning vocabulary: Here, too, Ørberg inculcates some of the *most relevant* core vocabulary for students of the classics--from seafaring (and its dangers), to dinner parties, to matters pertaining to the military and the Gauls and the Germans, to agricultural matters, and so on. Besides, some of the later chapters contain dialogues of early Christians, and Ørberg was able even to sneak in there some *lightly* adapted excerpts from the Vulgate (the characters in the book could not have known the Vulgate, of course--but historical accuracy has to yield in this case to Ørberg's ingenious methods).<br /><br />All in all: This is a superb achievement.

B00005JLR2|5.0|I went with my daughter and her friend to see this at the theatre years ago.  I wasn't sure what to expect, but definitely didn't expect to be blown out of the water.  Familiar with the book, Treasure Island, I found the twists and turns they gave the characters uplifting and fresh.  I can recommend this to everyone that likes a good story with a good ending.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|This is the reason many people bought a blu-ray player, especially myself. There are a number of bonus features that fans have been waiting for, most importantly deleted scenes from the Original Trilogy. These deleted scenes have never been released before, and for the die-hard Star Wars fans, these are what we've been waiting for, and three discs of bonus features promises a great deal of content that make this box-set a must by for any Star Wars fan.
0307272702|2.0|I really wanted to love this book, and I would have if I didn't know better.  Gary Taubes is not someone I previously considered to be a nut.    In previous books, he made well-founded conclusions (especially relevant, that eliminating fat from the diet was not necessarily going to improve health).    However, in this book he jumps ahead a step and declares that, more or less, low-fat diets are \\"why we get fat\\" and that we need to eliminate carbs instead.    The problem with that is... it isn't true.  Thanks to the popularity of Atkins, plenty of research was done (Taubes' explanations are not exactly the same, but he is recommending similar food intake).  The result of that research was pretty clear.  Cutting out carbs can be a useful short-term novelty diet to lose weight, but the long-term results show that calorie reduction vs. weight loss is the same for most people whether using low-carb or low-fat.    Taubes' new book is full of low-level theories and even supported research which in most cases \\"make sense\\" for smaller parts of his theory, but a 2003 Harvard review of several decades of diet and weight information (\\"Why Have Americans Become More Obese?\\") found that, in spite of many interesting changes in popular dieting attempts, our total increase in weight is matched by a constant increase in total calories consumed.    Taubes' research is a complex collection of things which look promising in small numbers, but don't match the reality of the entire population.  You really have to squint your eyes and want to believe that calories are not important to ignore that reality.  Despite individual claims and temporary personal changes, overall we are just eating more every decade.
B002WIDRM6|5.0|Lady Antebellum second album rocks.  Most of these days new country lacks substance, however, this band has it.  I consider myself old school or old country but this compact disc is must have for anyone's library.    Songs 1-6 are my favorite and most I have heard on the radio.  The rest are still great and should be played as well on the radio.  I would definitely recommend this compact disc.
1591843790|5.0|From time to time I meet students, first jobbers and the like looking to make their way into the advertising world.    Why they come to me me for career advice is probably questionable, bearing in mind my chequered history but if there's anything I can impart of value it's along the lines of 'look at what i did, NOW DON'T DO THAT'.    Thankfully, I now have a get out of jail card to hand, in the form of Guy Kawasaki's new book Enchantment.    If you are familiar with Guy's previous works, Art of The Start and Reality Check in particular, then the concepts are broadly similar.    In typical GK self depreciation style he once remarked that he had written 9 business books, or perhaps written one business book nine times...    Enchantment is a kind of Greatest Hits, if you like.  But with exclusive bonus tracks and remixes.    Obviously Guy's key area of experience and expertise is in the Silicon Valley tech thing but Enchantment is the rare case of a 'business' book that's relevant for just about any person in any business anywhere.    In a nutshell the book is structured around ten or so key take-aways, each with a chapter, essential nuggets for anyone who wants to influence others, win them over and get them to buy in to an idea or project.    Likability, trustworthiness, having a cause, how to overcome resistance, enchanting your boss, enchanting your employees and, of course, the obilgatory practical application of social technologies to achieve those goals, are among them.    I was fortunate enough to recieve a draft copy of the original manuscript a few months back to hack and return. Suffice to say there was very little I would have changed. I made the sum total of one edit and returned it.    It must have been a good edit though as he left it in...    There's no bull-shitake in the text, it's highly readable and entertaining, infused with Guy's own personality and wit, and peppered with other real-life examples of Enchantment in practice from other guest contributors.    In essence it's simply a tome of uncommon sense. One gets an experience of almost remembering things that have been buried away in the back of your mind that are brought back to the surface as the pages turn.    A must-read.

0240816250|5.0|I majored in art in college, and took photography on the side.  I enjoy photography more today as I matured.  But back then, there was no such thing as digital cameras, and what people call photography today.  When you took a photo with film, and had to develop it yourself, you find yourself conserving, but more importantly, respecting the art.  This massive book embraces film, but acknowledges the technology of today.<br /><br />I have been exploring this book for a couple months since the immense amount of information is overwhelming.  This is very much a classroom at your own pace.  With so many subjects, you might feel a bit lost, but just enough information to keep you inspired.  There are even review pages and breakdowns of chapters to aid in making side notes. And I certainly have plenty of post-it notes all over the place.<br /><br />Though there are many subjects at hand, there is a complete focus, and that is the world of black and white photography. Though there is nothing wrong with color, to me, black and white is true art.  To train your eye to see shades and result before printing is the key to grasping this training, and for some, an enlightening refresher course.  There is certainly an abundance of photo software programs out there and addressed, along with brands of cameras, lenses, filters and more.  This really does help narrow down your selections to your artistic style.<br /><br />There is also work involved in developing and printing.  Not only does this address chemicals and recipes for various results, it goes as far as getting you to the end result.  Right down to the right frame, how to frame, and other alternatives.<br /><br />The size of this book may be scary at first, as it was to me, as I do not learn by reading, I learn by doing.  What I found is that it is a very welcomed textbook to return to for reference and help with a helpful index of many subjects.  I do not consider myself a pro, but I would recommend this for every level.  Not to mention there is a plethora of images and illustrations that are quite amazing and inspiring.  I am thankful this is hardcover as it will be used quite a bit.ot to mention there is a plethora of images and illustrations that are quite amazing and inspiring.

B000EGDB10|5.0|Forget that the sequels squandered true plot elements for generic action sequences (delightful as they may have been).  Forget that the reinvention of classic TV spy shows in modern cinema has been worked to death over the past decade.  Forget that Tom Cruise has flown off the deep end and cannot resurrect even a marginal amount of his preexisting talent to save his latest Box Office bombs.<br /><br />Forget all of that because De Palma's 1996 underrated gem of a thriller is a borderline masterpiece.<br /><br />I want to lament for a moment at the tendency some viewers have of writing off this film or complaining that it doesn't make sense or makes them `think too hard'.  Maybe the frivolous complaints caused the producers to reconstruct the sequels to be more `simple minded' than this in-depth original.  I don't mean that to be rude or accusatory, and I understand that everyone has personal taste, but I ask you this: what were you expecting to see?  I mean, honestly, what do you want from your movies?  Do you want brainless plotting masked over by illustrious action sequences?  Do you want to switch off your brain and indulge your senses?  Why not indulge all of your senses, whilst not forsaking you capacity to think?  I had this issue with the countless individuals who criticized Christopher Nolan's `Inception'.  I mean, if you walk into the film with the foreknowledge that you HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION then you shouldn't be struggling to understand the plot twists.  They will make sense if you've actually been watching the film from start to finish.<br /><br />I'm done now.<br /><br />Regardless of what others may think, I personally consider this one of the best films of the 90's.  It capitalized on the popular leading man, using his special breed of `charismatic awareness' to create a signature role for the star.  Brian De Palma owns this film though, with rich directorial choices that bathe this film in an ominous mood, one that pays homage to the inspiration while bringing it into the modern world, giving us plenty of reasons to sit in salivation over the film's tone and texture.  The action sequences are spectacular, yet they are not overdone (as they are in the sequel).

B000N6TYLW|5.0|My set is now complete.  I love the banter back and forth on this show.  Keeps you laughing.  I highly recommend this to everyone!!  Great writing!!
B004DMNT2W|4.0|I got this bag to house my [[ASIN:B00322OP4K Canon M31]], which I have paired with an  [[ASIN:B001DYLGM8 expanded battery]]. The battery pack provides lots of recording time, but extends about 1.5 inches behind the camcorder. Overall I find the case to be good for overall use, just barely big enough in size, but not great in protection.<br /><br />First, to the most important point for me - the reason I ordered - the case will indeed fit the HF M31 with the extended battery. However it only closes if one puts it in with the battery facing into the case, and it just barely closes, with some small effort at the zipper.<br /><br />The case has some nice options for carrying. The main strap is a velcro closure, which allows it to be reconfigured, and there is a carrying handle and a ring loop (which is what I use to attach).  Unfortunately this ring is also the zipper handle. It seems sturdy enough, so I intend to use it. I don't always trust a velcro closure, since I attach this small pack to my larger TLS digital camera backpack.<br /><br />I find the case to be adequately padded, but I don't think it will provide the same level of protection as the MSEC-4 it is replacing. The interior material is nice and won't scratch the camcorder.<br /><br />The case \\"features\\" an elastic strap that keeps the case from opening too wide, which is intended to keep the camcorder from slipping out. I suppose it does that well enough, but it also makes it a bit harder to put the camcorder back into the case; one has to slide it in, rather than putting it in flat.<br /><br />The interior of the case has a couple of slots that will fit an SD card and not much else. For this small size I suppose that is OK.<br /><br />I recommend this case for those that need the extra length. But don't throw the case around; it will provide basic protection but the protection is adequate rather than excellent.<br /><br />NOTE: If you don't need the extra length, I suggest the the [[ASIN:B002DUEBIC Case Logic MSEC-4]].
B002ZG980U|5.0|Production values are through the roof.  Leo is awesome.  Ellen Page taps into her edgy works prior to Juno and shows she can run with the big dogs  (and I still have a boyish crush on her).  A spectacle, with some profound notions about the nature of the human mind.
B000KX0IOA|3.0|Talk about a film that has not aged well in my mind, `Gandhi' remains one of those Oscar sweeping epic biopics that I just don't get the love for.  The man himself was truly remarkable, and his life's journey from lawyer to leader is magnificent to comprehend, but the dullish way in which Richard Attenborough directed this film leaves me scratching my head.<br /><br />The film is void of any real charisma.<br /><br />I fawn all over biopics, and I have admitted to liking generically crafted films like `A Beautiful Mind' in the past, but I cannot rally behind `Gandhi'.  This is a film that feels so bland and unaffecting.  Maybe it was trying to mirror the beliefs and guidelines presented by the film's moral compass, but for me the film dropped my interest.  Spanning three hours in length didn't help it much.  The film needed a beating heart, something to draw us in, and instead it felt too intent on delivering a history lesson than actually creating a riveting character piece.<br /><br />I understand that this film is regarded highly by many individuals (202 5 star reviews is no easy feat) and yet I'm not ashamed by my viewpoint.  I don't really see anything truly noteworthy about this film.  The acting is decent, but Kingsley's portrayal of Mahatma Gandhi is rather one-note to be honest.  I never saw the layers pealing away.  I never saw any complexity here.  For me, his performance felt as `by the numbers' as the film itself.<br /><br />Tailor made for Oscar's eye, but no real dynamic present to make the film memorable.<br /><br />`Gandhi' carries a powerful message; I just wish that more effort had been made to make that message resounding.  Instead, the film wavers on boring and loses a lot of steam as it progresses towards its end.  I like a statement that one fellow reviewer made, so I'm going to borrow it here.<br /><br />I hope you don't mind Jose R. Perez:<br /><br />\\"It's a towering film to be sure, but in a soft, unmagnetic way that never shows it's pure unadulterated SOUL. Instead of looking INTO the leader's heart, \\"Gandhi\\" looks AT it; instead of bringing us closer to his ultimate message and tactical wisdom, he becomes a caricature a victim of his time and place.\\"<br /><br />This is exactly my sentiments.  The film is very ambitious, by that ambition is misplaced in a director who doesn't take the needed time to flesh it out completely.  Instead, the film becomes a one-dimensional portrait of a man I `wish' I knew more intimately.heart, \\"Gandhi\\" looks AT it; instead of bringing us closer to his ultimate message and tactical wisdom, he becomes a caricature a victim of his time and place.\\"    This is exactly my sentiments.

B00006M183|4.0|It's a pretty good album, but as a whole it is not among Pearl Jam's best. It didn't have the raw power of Ten or Vs. but it wasn't as intrestingly arty as Binaural. Yet it still has I Am Mine, possibly the greatest Pearl Jam song of all time. It has a lot of good songs (like Love Boat Captain and You Are) , but not alot of standout material like other albums. It tries to be odd and different but at the same time it tries to be normal and a repeat of thier past music. Still a definate buy for Pearl Jam fans though!!!!
B00003CY6M|3.0|Totally cool unrelated fact about me that has nothing to do with this movie aside from the fact that I want to make it fit; serendipity is one of my favorite words.  Yes, I know that it really doesn't `apply' to the film itself, but I just wanted to tell you all.  The dictionary defines `serendipity' as `an aptitude for making desirable discoveries by accident'...I mean, that is just cool.  That said; the film doesn't really live up to its name.  Sure, it is endearing and settles into your soul with the warmth expected from these romantic comedies, so in that respect it relays the feeling that I get when I hear the WORD serendipity, but the film is far from an accidental discovery, beings that the film is predictably clich&eacute;d and undeniably unoriginal.  Thankfully, the leads really carry this film.  John Cusack is right at home in these types of rom/coms and Kate Beckinsale, who is usually stagnant on screen, shines with real charm and charisma.  You want to be around her; she illuminates.  The film is a tad preposterous in many ways, but that is to be expected from this genre; a genre that rarely balances the endearing quality of the `meant to be' with the realities of `real life'.  If you walk in expecting what the film promises (sweet romance wrapped in a saccharine shell of implausible happiness) then you'll enjoy every last drop of this standard, by-the-books, nothing new yet charming little ditty.  I give it a C+ with my stamp of `rainy day' approval.<br /><br />Enjoy.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I don't often give 5 star reviews. I save these for the special books that I will buy in hardcover and keep for my children...my future children.     Let me just say I can't wait to read the 3rd.    I usually read novels that are YA fantasy, urban fantasy and dystopian in nature but USUALLY i read main characters that are women. I am not used to being in a boys head. Thomas, however, was a spectacular character. His growth was seamless over the course of the first two books and I feel as though I have changed right along with him. There is never a moment when you think \\"wow Thomas really changed\\" it is so organic.  The character makes this book. My attachment to him has made me understand men and their thought processes better...now that is a testament to a good character.    Although the character is enough for me to love this book, the story is just as deserving of my high praise. The world Thomas lives in is so unique from any other dystopian world I have read through. The other characters stand out in my mind as unique...which is hard to do within a genre I have read hundreds of books in. The world of the Glade and in the second book of the Scorch are well written and are in expressive detail in my mind. James Dashner created and incredible world that I loved living in.    Furthermore, although this is a YA book, it is absolutely easy for adults to read. Though the characters are young, they are in situations in which adulthood must be quickly reached. Dashner accomplishes this with elegance. The rebelliousness found only in youth merges with a sense of responsibility and determination that adulthood only brings.     This is a great read for everyone and anyone who doesn't mind a little violence in their suspense. It will have you gasping for air and begging for more.
B004H8GLXQ|5.0|Stories about twins fascinate me.  Especially stories about twins and ghosts.  There is something very mystical and magical about one soul split into two identical bodies.  Vida Winter, a famous but now old and aging storyteller decides it's time to share the secrets of her life.  She calls on Margaret Lea who carries a secret of her own.<br /><br />Vida sets the ground rules that all stories have beginnings, middles and ends and there will be no deviating from that.  Margaret, with an investigative mind, tries to put some pieces in place before the famous author is ready to reveal them.  Along the way the pair form an incredible, loving bond.<br /><br />The Thirteenth Tale is a lovely, mysterious page turner.  The story and its characters are enticing.  So other people must think so too.  I rate it a 5 out of 5 and I think I'm keeping it.  I've always wanted to write my own story about twins.  I'll need some tips and The Thirteenth Tale will offer many.<br /><br />Linda C. Wright<br />Author<br />[[ASIN:1439249563 One Clown Short]]
B00003CXZ1|2.0|This film just did NOT do it for me.  Sadly, the film cannot capture the tension and unexpected excitement that spills over your game controller every time you play the video game.  Thankfully, this film is not as thankless as the sequel, but it rarely makes a real impact.  I didn't expect that at all.  Seeing Angelina Jolie all reared and ready to go as this classic video game vixen, I really expected more out of the whole thing, but instead I got a marginally entertaining action flick with an uninhabited lead actress who didn't seem to connect with this character at all.  She seemed disengaged, which is a shame because on paper this works gloriously.  The plot is a shamble, but that is to be expected (I mean, it's not like the video game was too concerned about being plausible) but the tense engagement a person feels while sifting through clues on their own to `solve the puzzles' is lost in this unimaginative rendering of the prose.  Instead, we get a film that feels generic in texture and certainly less inspired than the cultural phenomenon that the video game became.
B003UESJHO|4.0|I will spare everybody my lame esoteric views and just say - if you were interested in this movie at all in the first place - you will definitely not be disappointed. It is really good.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|I never buy anything on dvd anymore, but not only did I purchase this to support one of the smartest funniest comedies ever made, but this dvd is so full of bonus features that this dvd is actually worth the sticker price. With commentaries by the executive producer and stars of the show for every single episodes.
B003UYV08E|5.0|This is a terrific movie.  My husband collects comic books and comic related movies and he could hardly wait to get this present.
B003Y74KC0|4.0|It's a peppy pink, which is distinctive and makes my phone stand apart. This basic case has protection for the back of the iPhone, and provides bumpers for the sides. It allows for good access to its ports and controls. The ribbed, textured feel is pleasant in my hands, and offers a good grip. My only complaint is its fit; the sides are slightly too loose. The price is right, however, for a backup case.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|As the story continues, we see the protagonist fighting to save, for a future where families needs, overweigh ones' personal well being. And all the drama you never knew you were missing! Season 3 for sale for months, never officially released?
B004DK5CYM|5.0|This movie illustrates a story that is meaningful and touching for all ages. It teaches that values for animals is just as equal as values for humans.
B004Q9T4E4|2.0|Ferguson beating the same old drum.  If you are a Spenglerian then you'll fall in line with the argument and if not you won't.<br /><br />Well argued, as usual, but not entirely convincing and a tad on the hysterical and fatalistic side.<br /><br />Ultimately not convincing...but it is just a book to go along with another of his documentaries.

1591843790|4.0|I sat down and read 'Enchantment' in most of one day. It was enjoyable and a day well spent.  What I found was many tips that I could employ right away to improve myself, my business and the experience  for my clients. Guy helped me revisit live presentations, my social media presence and my relationships  with my team. I found myself reading with my laptop by my side so that I could investigate the examples that he shares. I found myself earmarking pages to return to, so that I could continue to increase my 'enchantment' factor with my community.    Thanks Guy!
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|I like action and spy movies. This movie has all of those and an all star cast to boot!!! RED is one of the best movies i've seen in awhile!! (it also has a little romance weaved in) I love it!
B002W5UVSM|2.0|(This review is for the Kindle version)<br />I wanted to read this again, since I had fond memories of my reading from 20 years ago.  Unfortunately the Kindle version's typesetting is distractingly bad.  The typeface is not changeable, and changing the size does not really help the problem.  It's set in a serif font, and the spaces between the words are all over the place; some of the spaces look like five spaces.  The kerning within the words, by contrast, is extremely tight.  It just looks bad and does not flow, and it stinks because this book deserves better treatment.  I would recommend a print version unless you are very forgiving of bad typesetting.<br /><br />From now on I will always try a sample first, so I can avoid ugly, cheap conversions.
B003WUYOQ6|4.0|This is a terrific book, finally unmasking the diet hoax the government and Big Health and their press-release-rewriting collaborators in the legacy media (looking at you New York Times) have been pushing all these years, resulting in an obesity epidemic (and a growing diabetes one), which they still refuse to own up to.<br /><br />Taubes, in essence, has given the Atkins Diet the historical respectability it has always deserved. Instead, it still is repeatedly tarred by the likes of the NYTimes, the American Heart Association, and the American Medical Association.<br /><br />A restricted (or, better yet, no) starches, grains and sugars diet was well known to help people lose weight and keep it off, without any threat to their health, at least as far back as 1825. Taubes shows it all, and how it was confirmed by subsequent research and endured as the best advice available until it was undermined by Big Health's low-fat drivel in the 1960s.<br /><br />So, if you're struggling to keep your weight (and blood pressure) down, while eating all that high-sugar, high-carb, low-fat junk the processed food industry churns out, do yourself a favor and get Taubes's book. His other, high-sciencey one, annotated with all the proofs, isn't necessary. Unless you're especially hard to convince (or you work for Big Health), you can skip it.
B0013ZGN98|5.0|CLOVERFIELD (2008) is a nightmarish, emotionally exhausting sci-fier in which a terrified monster alien attacks and destroys buildings and inhabitants of NY's Manhattan island.<br /><br />None of the small group of young folks we meet at story's beginning survive the carnage. All that remains of them is a camcorder tape, and it's this tape that IS the entire movie. An original concept well executed.<br /><br />One of the best science fiction films to come along in years. Highest recommendation.
B004HO6HYI|5.0|Though I have not yet read the novel on which this film was based,I  REALLY loved the movie!!!And though the plot is hardly an original  one,ALEX PETTYFER and TIMOTHY OLYPHANT do turn in great performances  as the 2 Loriens: John and Henri.The film,itself,is basically like taking \\"TWILIGHT\\",\\"SUPERMAN,\\"and the tv series,\\"ROSWELL\\",and putting them all in a blender and coming out with:\\"I AM NUMBER   FOUR.\\"But don't let that part discourage you from seeing the film!!  The great thing about this movie is the character-driven part of the film before the action-and-special effects galore-climax!This  one is a REAL PLEASER for any one who is out on a date for their  first time!The CGI effects REALLY ROCK when it comes to the: monsters,John's legacy powers,and the big laser-gun fight at the  end in the high school's football field!!!And I hope to God they  turn the sequel novel: \\"THE POWER OF SIX\\" into a film with the  same cast!!!!!!!!
B003Y74KCK|4.0|This AmazonBasics silicone case does a good basic job protecting the back and sides of an iPhone. I wish it fit a bit more snug on the sides, as it doesn't hug the phone as I would want it to ideally. The soft feel of the case is pleasant and has a good hold-on-to ribbed texture. The price is appropriate for the basic protection this case provides.
B002ZG975Q|5.0|My heart was really touched by this modern-retelling of the  literature classic,\\"Beauty & The Beast.\\"ALEX PETTYFER and VANESSA  HUDGENS chemistry is UNDENIABLE on screen.And PETTYFER pulls you in  with his performance as the good-looking guy who only cares about  himself and then slowly but surely transforms into a caring person  with a loving-heart.I would highly-recommend this movie to any one  due solely to its strong moral to the story about it's not what's  on the outside that counts but on the inside!!!!!!!!!
B001UW58WW|5.0|After listening to Rock Symphonies first and loving it, I was hoping this album would be just as good. And it is, David did not disappoint.  Another great album!  From He's a Pirate to Csardas (Gypsy Dance)to Rock Prelude, I keep wanting more.  I especially love Chelsea Girl.  I've already ordered another of his albums, Free.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|i really enjoyed this book.  the only issue i had was after she met her true love she no longer was as strong as she was in the beginning. its like she was becoming almost helpless in many ways after the big important vampire came in the picture.   BUT....I still am anciously awaiting the next book. Very glad I bought it.
0756404738|3.0|No spoilers here. While I enjoyed this book because I loved The Name of the Wind, I completely agree with most of the main issues raised by other reviewers. The Wise Man's Fear spends far too much time on major subplots that barely move the story forward. I found myself wishing for certain sections to end so the adventure could continue. Unfortunately, I wished this through a good four hundred pages. While a subplot can be interesting in its own right, my biggest issue with the two major ones in the book is that their eventual outcome is so obvious from the outset that there's no real mystery or excitement to pull you along.  Secondly, the treatment of sex in this novel is so juvenile it actively bothered me. If you're going to keep making such a big deal out of it, you need to talk about it above a third grade level, otherwise don't put it in at all.    I still love Kvothe as a main character; he's likeable and good at heart while still flawed. The first third of the book pulled me in immediately. There are interesting characters introduced here and new mysteries added to the adventure. If you go back and reference the legends people tell about Kvothe, you'll now know the truth behind many of them. As other reviewers have mentioned, I have no idea how Rothfuss plans to wrap up this story with one more novel; it seems like he'll need two at least, and another six if the next book moves at the same pace. I won't complain if there's that many more books as long as the quality of the storytelling along the way isn't sacrificied, and I'll still be eagerly awaiting the arrival of the next installment.
B00005M2CP|5.0|dvd's were in grate shape. received them for a fair price, they arrived in a very short period of time. very pleased with this set.
1591843790|5.0|We've all encountered them: recent college graduates, hogging the sidewalk corners with their big activist binders, desperately trying to guilt us into donating $5 to save the world.     \\"Spare a minute for the environment?\\" \\"For gay rights?\\" \\"For baby sea otters?\\" If you say yes, you do so begrudgingly. If, like most of us, you say no, you feel like one of the bad guys from old Captain Planet episodes: \\"Muah-ha-ha! I'm going to throw oil in the ocean!\\" It's a lose-lose scenario.    Obviously, those street canvassers have yet to read Guy Kawasaki's latest gem of a book, Enchantment: The Art of Changing Hearts, Minds, and Actions. Kawasaki's mission is nothing but ambitious: to pass on his knowledge \\"so you can change the world.\\" The toolkit he presents in the book? Likability and trustworthiness, the fundamental characteristics of truly enchanting people.     The book's primarily written for a for-profit audience, but those of us in the nonprofit world can still take a heaping handful of core lessons to heart. For example, how many of us have thrillingly launched a new program or campaign, only to watch it fizzle out shortly thereafter? Kawasaki's suggestion: conduct a \\"premortem,\\" anticipating the program's eventual cause of death and thereby preventing a catastrophe before it starts.     Or, for the marketing and communications folks among us, how often have we overwhelmed people with too much information about our work? As Kawasaki makes clear, it's much better for an audience member to leave a presentation or webinar curious about your work than to bore them to death with too many details. He offers the 10-20-30 rule for PowerPoint presentations: \\"make a ten-slide presentation in twenty minutes with no font smaller than thirty points.\\"     As someone who spends most of her working hours on Facebook and Twitter (or creating strategies to best leverage Facebook and Twitter), I personally got the most out of Chapters 8 and 9, which focus on using push and pull technologies. Push technologies (like email and Twitter) broadcast your message to people's online homes, from their inboxes to their Twitter accounts. Pull technologies (like Facebook and websites), on the other hand, invite people into your online home and let you use larger quantities of information (more than 140 characters) to get your point across. As Kawasaki neatly explains, \\"Push technology brings your story to people. Pull technology brings people to your story.\\"     The content in these two chapters was simple but game-changing. Keep your emails to six sentences? Talk about a shift in writing style for most of us in the nonprofit world.  Review people's Twitter profiles before responding to their tweets? Basic, yet most of us social media users rarely take the time to do it. While small, these types of concrete changes make us more powerful and engaging communicators.    To see Kawasaki in full enchantment action, check out the Facebook page he created for Enchantment. The book isn't released until tomorrow, March 8, yet his page already has over 17,000 friends. A whopping 12 tabs adorn its left-hand side. Soon-to-be readers are enticed with multiple interactive tools, from a quiz (\\"Guy's Realistic Enchantment Aptitude Test,\\" or GREAT) to a photo contest. (I'll admit, I submitted a photo of my grumpy pet rabbit into the \\"pets\\" category.)     Most notably, Kawasaki himself interacts with almost all the commenters on his page's wall. To repeat, the page has 17,000 friends. That's a lot of interaction.     But it looks like it's paying off. As of right now, Enchantment's the number one bestselling book on Amazon.com in the Marketing category. It's obvious that Kawasaki has something meaningful to say about how to enchant an audience. Nonprofit communicators should start listening.

B000002UVX|4.0|I saw Hendrix twice in my life, both times with the Experience. Once he was great, the next time very slipshod. But, honestly, neither concert transported me the way that listening to any of his studio albums did, which I realize is heresy amongst the vast majority of Hendrix' admirers. So when I say that \\"Machine Gun\\" is a stellar tour de force, I come to it as someone who feels that this and the Woodstock version of \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\" showed Hendrix at the height of his live powers, full of the force and outrage that made him such an incredible musician. Both pieces show Hendrix the aural landscapist giving as vivid a picture of life on the battlefield as one can imagine. In the Vietnam War era, they were soundtracks to a nation--the US, that is----in great conflict over a war that polarized everyone. \\"Machine Gun\\" is a stunner, one of Hendrix' best performances.<br /><br />It is also the one BAND OF GYPSYS track in which drummer Buddy Miles didn't sound at musical variance with Hendrix, which sadly cannot be said of the rest of BAND OF GYPSYS. Miles' showboating wears mighty thin mighty fast; even Hendrix has been documented as saying that he'd wished Buddy had cooled it (bassist Billy Cox is rock-solid throughout). But Hendrix himself sounds very tentative on most of the rest of the album, except possibly \\"Message To Love,\\" where he seems ready to spread his wings more. Ah, well. \\"Machine Gun\\" is still worth getting the rest of the album for, and worth 4 stars all its own.
031603438X|2.0|I grew up in the era, listening to the Beatles, Bob Dyan, the Stones and the blues. The genius of Joni Mitchell only came to me late, because I wasn't listening.Songwriters and guitar players may enjoy hearing how he worked. Mostly it's a long saga of substance abuse, rebellion against authority and minimized anger issues. This man in his 60s, the father of daughters, refers to woman primarily as chicks and bitches.He seems to congratulate himself for accepting servant-like behavior from women not limited to sexual favors. He actually says without apparent irony that misogynistic songs such as \\"Under my Thumb\\" and \\"Stupid Girl\\" might have helped women stand up for themselves.An example of how substances, fame, and personal choices can inhibit personal growth.A historical curiosity, but don't look for depth or a role model.
0316069884|3.0|In `Eating Animals' Jonathan Safran Foer analyzes the current state of agribusiness and advocates a vegetarian diet.  He uses personal narratives of his family, farms, and society to explain why \\"factory farming\\" is wrong.  Although interesting, the book falls far short of proving why vegetarianism is the \\"right\\" choice.<br /><br />Foer openly declares he began his research expecting to advance vegetarianism.  He uses analogies between pets and farm animals.  Though he can't explain why we love dogs we should give other animals the same humane treatment.  Here's the problem:  Foer never explains why animals should be treated humanely and what distinctions should be given between animals.  Whenever confronted with hard rules he shies away from the question with, \\"I don't know...\\"  Most of his musings sounds like half-baked thought experiments rather than rigorous philosophy.<br /><br />Where Foer hits the mark is when he talks about agribusiness and global warming.  Raised animals, overwhelmingly factory farmed, are the largest cause of global warming.  This wouldn't be such a problem if people paid the true cost of their meat.  The problem is agribusiness is heavily subsidized by the gov't and causes massive pollution.  The cost to producers, and price for consumers, has been externalized.  The price of meat no longer reflects its true societal cost and a deadweightloss occurs.  We need to reform agribusiness.<br /><br />Yet Foer is unwilling to compromise.  If meat cannot be made outside of agribusiness no one should eat it (allusions to the holocaust are omniprevalent.)  This notion is absurd.  Factory farming is clearly a more efficient system of production.  Should the price of meat increase to internalize the true cost of production?  Yes, the price of meat should be 2-3X the current cost (or more.)  However, that doesn't mean the system should be abandoned.  By abandoning agribusiness the price of meat will become astronomical and vegetarianism will become a financial necessity for most people.<br /><br />Foer's analysis is intriguing but completely unrealistic.  He needs to review his assumptions before enforcing such a significant sacrifice on the vast majority.most people.      Foer's analysis is intriguing but completely unrealistic.

B0038M2AZA|5.0|This past Sunday, I sat down with my parents and my husband, John, to watch Temple Grandin. I had bought the movie a few months ago after reading the great reviews but kept putting off watching it for various reasons, including thinking it would be too heavy for a depressing winter day. My curiosity finally peaked and despite the family's slight reluctance, we started it relatively late in the evening. I fully expected John and my mother to fall asleep by the halfway point as they are both notorious for letting movies lull them asleep on a quiet evening.<br /><br />By the end of the movie--everyone was fully awake--we were all invigorated and discussing what we had just watched, staying up past our usual departure times. Everyone in the room enjoyed it and all of us have been discussing it since. It is easily one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. Yes, it deals with serious matters but it doesn't weigh you down with them, infuses hope and understanding and even some tolerance that inspires. It is wonderfully visual and conveys autism, especially Grandin's, in a lucid manner. Clare Danes deserved her Emmy and Golden Globe despite the cliche of portraying someone with a disability which Hollywood always rewards. Julia Ormond (so good to see her again) and Catherine O'Hara were also excellent along with David Straithairn whose role wasn't a push for him but he does it so well that I always love him, too.<br /><br />So I wanted to recommend the movie to you. See it if you haven't. It's gotten some press, but not nearly enough since it was made for TV. It isn't rated but would merit somewhere between a PG and PG-13 for subject matter. After all, this is about slaughterhouses, too. Grandin is in part responsible for the better treatment of animals that will eventually become a food source. Read more about her online if you are interested, but don't let that subject matter scare you away as I almost did. It is discreet in handling those matters and doesn't try to shock or repel while still telling the story of someone's struggles with being different, very different, but with a big contribution to make to our world. I can't recommend it enough!el while still telling the story of someone's struggles with being different, very different, but with a big contribution to make to our world. I can't recommend it enough!
B000JQV68A|4.0|Anthony Patch is the hero. His wealthy grandfather supports prohibition, and THE BEAuTIFUL AND DAMNED is the best temperance tract ever written. It's frightening to see that even in his mid-twenties Fitzgerald was already working his favorite theme: the degeneration and final collapse of a promising man ruined by a woman, by drinking, and by the shallow life of a partier. What he learned from his wife's mental collapse before he wrote TENDER IS THE NIGHT he already knew more than ten years earlier, when he started THE BEAUTIFUL AND DAMNED. He rejected twentieth century capitalistic social values in order to produce beauty; his wife rejected them more simply, just by being beautiful. In THE BEAUTIFUL AND DAMNED this brave decision, beauty before everything else, leads to triumph and collapse -- and neither the author nor the reader can tell whether the triumph is worth the collapse, or the collapse proves the triumph is just an illusion. Or whether it's all just an alcoholic's dream.    Fitzgerald himself appears in the novel as a minor character, a friend of Anthony Patch's with a successful first novel who degenerates into a writer of popular trash. That was how Fitzgerald saw his own short stories, but the serious novels he really wanted to write were deliberately, terrifyingly empty, and in a way THE BEAUTIFUL AND DAMNED is more open about its emptiness than THE GREAT GATSBY. Gatsby is able to work and thinks the wealthy Daisy whom he loves is a wonderful person. He doesn't get her, but he keeps his illusions. Anthony Patch knows he has nothing to live for, and he is incapable of Gatsby's kind of work and dedication. He loves only beauty, and he knows his love will destroy him. He uses alcohol, which he swears he'll never give up and predicts will kill him at forty (just like it would kill Fitzgerald) -- he uses alcohol to make sure his destruction is as ugly and humiliating as possible. Meanwhile his wife Gloria, beauty itself, just grows old and ugly, as beautyalways does. And that's the whole book, unless you want to go along with one of Fitzgerald's many drunken jokes, and see it as Anthony's grandfather's triumphant proof that beauty is worthless and business is all.    It's a great book that got great editing (from Maxwell Perkins, perhaps the twentieth century's greatest editor), and it is meant to be one of the saddest books anyone ever read. I take away one star because I don't think the characters had much potential to begin with -- but that's part of the point Fitzgerald is trying to make: nobody has enough potential to beat the emptiness of life. Okay, then I take away one star because the book glorifies drinking -- but I can't forget all the great poems that do the same thing. I take away one star because I have more sympathy for Gatsby and Dick Diver of TENDER IS THE NIGHT -- but I suspect that's because those books are less honest than this one.
1591843790|5.0|Enchantment started off weakly, or so I thought, because I didn't yet appreciate the full picture Guy was painting. Chapter 2, for example, is How to Achieve Likability, and includes sections like \\"Perfect Your Handshake\\" (complete with a mathematical formula for handshake excellence,) \\"Use the Right Words,\\" \\"Accept Others,\\" \\"Don't Impose Your Values,\\" and \\"Create Win-Win Situations.\\" C'mon... how Self-Help 101 can you get? Actually, this is Self-Help 001... the remedial course. But I greatly admire Guy's body of work, so I soldiered on... to the part where it says \\"don't use war analogies\\" so... umm... I guess I plodded on. And there were several other things that kept me going in the early chapters:<br /><br />First, the book has a regular stream of very useful checklists, none of which I'd ever seen before, even though Guy credits others for some of them. The book is worth the read just for the checklists. I've been a fan of checklists for years, but especially after reading The Checklist Manifesto recently, but that's another review for another day.<br /><br />Next, the book is full of useful quotes, most of which I hadn't seen, even though many were from some of my favorite quotable people. A good quote is what proverbs have been for ages, and what Twitter occasionally rises to today: the encapsulation of an important truth into a concise and sticky statement. We should all aspire to articulating things this way.<br /><br />Guy also has some hilarious phrases peppered through the book. Things like \\"group-groping\\" (the work of a committee,) \\"helicopter parents\\" (hover around their kids,) \\"fiefdumbs,\\" (like fiefdoms, and just as stupid as a fiefdom would be today) and the \\"Dopeler Effect\\" (stupid ideas that sound smarter when they come at you faster.) Granted, I'm a Phrase Freak, but I'm sure you'll also find many of them either useful, amusing, or both.<br /><br />Chapter 3, How to Achieve Trustworthiness, sounds equally elementary to the previous chapter, but the sophistication of the material is warming up at this point, and Chapter 4, How to Prepare, is getting seriously useful. The \\"Qualities of Enchanting Causes\\" are very good, as is the checklist in \\"Make It Short, Simple, and Swallowable.\\" Have the discipline to do each exercise in the book; you'll be glad you did. For example, Guy gives you one line to write your positioning statement. His is \\"Empower people.\\" Mine was much longer... until now.<br /><br />Chapter 5, How to Launch, contains a highly instructive discussion of whether we should decrease choice or increase choice. At first, Guy sounds like he's also illustrating high levels of cognitive dissonance, but if you read closely, he outlines conditions under which each approach can work. Chapter 6, How to Overcome Resistance, includes a parallel discussion of the virtues of ubiquity alongside the virtues of scarcity.<br /><br />Guy really hits his stride in Chapter 7, How to Make Enchantment Endure. The discussion on building an ecosystem and the next on diversifying the team are worth the purchase price of the book, IMO. Full disclosure: I was sent a free review copy of the book.<br /><br />Chapter 8, How to Use Push Technology, is chock-full of the stuff we expect Guy to know best, and he doesn't disappoint. From the general principles at the beginning of the chapter, he takes us on a tour de force of the best ways to use the tech that's out there to get a message out, from presentations to email to twitter. Here's another chapter that's worth the price of the book.<br /><br />Chapter 9 is the counterpoint: How to Use Pull Technology, and it's equally valuable. Repeatedly through the discussions on websites, blogs, facebook, LinkedIn, and YouTube, I found myself saying \\"I hadn't thought of that\\"... and I really like thinking about these things.<br /><br />The book is a bit like a workout, beginning with a slow warm-up, building into a crescendo of usefulness in the middle chapters, and then easing into thecool-down of the latter chapters. But by the time I got to the final chapters, I was enchanted, and happily read through How to Enchant Your Employees, How to Enchant Your Boss, and How to Resist Enchantment (from those who use enchantment unscrupulously.) At the end, the wisdom of the early elementary chapters is obvious, because those things are a necessary part of the process of enchantment. Well worth the read... see for yourself... and make sure you read to the end.<br /><br />This review and other useful stuff[...]pters, I was enchanted, and happily read through How to Enchant Your Employees, How to Enchant Your Boss, and How to Resist Enchantment (from those who use enchantment unscrupulously.)

0307472841|3.0|The first part of the book about a female Swedish judge investigating the mass murder in a small town in Sweden is impressive with a strong plot and a beguiling characterization of the judge, her lifestyle and the slow methodical unraveling of important facts about the killing. Filling the rest of the mystery is the tale of historical vengeance and a modern Chinese superman wreaking havoc against a family in the West for nineteenth century injustices. Implausibility saps one's suspension of belief and Mankell's denouement of death in London proves that the ying and yang of these two tales does not work.

1569242739|5.0|This book is dangerous not only because the cupcakes are so incredibly tasty, but because they are so insanely easy to make as well.  I'm considering keeping this book in a safe deposit box until I need it, before I need to go out and buy an entire new wardrobe in a larger size.    I got this cookbook for Christmas this year, and the first recipe I made was the Chocolate Stout Cupcakes with an Irish Cream \\"Butter-cream\\" frosting for a friend's birthday.  They were an absolute hit with everyone there! Honestly, these are the best cupcakes I think I've ever had. I've made 4 different recipes so far, and my whole family has picked out their own birthday cupcakes.  Except for me - I'm still trying to decide between the Tiramisu and the Mexican Hot Chocolate....or maybe the Pistachio Rosewater or the Bananas Foster or...
B004GXZ69W|4.0|I had been suffering from wrist pain for awhile and couldn't use my mouse anymore.  I looked all over the web for an ergonomic mouse.  I couldn't find anything that said one product was better than another - it was more about trial and error.  I really like this mouse.  I do not have any more wrist pain.  The mouse takes getting used to because of the way your hand is positioned and the variety of buttons. The buttons are programmable, but I'm not technical enough to bother with them...so I left them and they work just fine for my needs.  I have tiny hands for an adult, and the small size is a good fit.  The one drawback is that the mouse is not wireless.  But I would still highly recommend this mouse if you are suffering from wrist pain.
B00127RAJY|4.0|The short version -   PROS: 3 different workouts, great blend of strength/cardio/abs, moves are easy enough to do, workouts are definitely challenging.  CONS: Workouts are only 20 minutes each so at best this DVD is a supplement to other DVDs    The long version-  I am intermediate/advanced fitness enthusiast. I am a Jillian fan but have never seen an episode of The Biggest Loser. I loved 6-week six pack and Yoga Meltdown and I really like this DVD too. The problem is that the workouts are just way too short. 6-week and Yoga are both 30-35 minutes each, which means they can stand alone, more or less, as my whole workout for the day (although an hour would be preferable and I often pair them with other DVDs to get the whole hour in.) 30 Day Shred has 3 20 minute workouts. Okay, I guess I can put the three of them together for a one hour workout, but why would I do that? I don't get the feeling that's what Jillian intended when she made the DVD. I have been reading Jillian's book \\"Winning by Losing\\" in which she says a 20-30 minute workout is so ineffective it's hardly worth the time. Well, I agree and disagree with that, but the point is if she said it why did she put out a 20 minute workout DVD?!?!    That said... the workouts are great! I was very tired and not at all bored! I will probably use this DVD at least once a week for the foreseeable future, which makes it to me worth the purchase at $8 and free shipping.

B001H9MYPW|5.0|I just finished a marathon viewing of season two and all I can say is \\"Wow!\\"  This is, by far, one of the most authentic shows I've ever seen.  I thought that season one was outstanding, but season two took it to a whole other level.  Gabriel Byrne's \\"Paul\\" is such a complex character.  Likable when he is with his patients and someone I wanted to throttle when he was with his therapist.  It was a brilliant portrayal of the \\"human-ness\\" in all of us that is able to put our own problems in a box and do the right thing by others when we have to.  Each patient brought something extraordinary to the table this season.  The \\"Oliver\\" segment absolutely broke my heart.  Of all of the segments though, the ones between Paul and Gina were the most compelling.  Dianne Wiest was an absolute marvel.  The facial expressions were absolutely spot on and in Week 6 she really showed why she earned the Emmy that year.  O.M.G!  I sat there watching that whole episode unfold with my jaw dropped.  It was probably the most authentic thing I'd seen on television in a very long time.  I actually watched it twice! I was pleasantly surprised to see that that episode was directed by Richard Schiff of \\"The West Wing\\" fame.  The man, obviously, has talent behind as well as in front of the screen.<br />This show is highly recommended.
B004FGMV0W|5.0|A nice surprise! What the Hell is kind of an oddball song on this CD. All the tracks others are light, less \\"rock\\" than Avril's previous releases, but are really good. Push is the best track on the Album. I highly recommend this CD!
B001JJY3CW|5.0|If something is not on vinyl...I simply don't own it. How pleased I was when Amazon offered Dark Horse by Nickelback on glorious LP form. Chad Krueger growls his way through 11 songs, but the strong points appear to be on side two, with \\"Never Gonna Be Alone<\\" my favorite and the closer \\"This Afternoon>\\" Now, let's go back and put out the others on vinyl.
0446195529|3.0|I am a huge Baldacci fan and The Camel Club series is one of the most memorable and loved series I've ever read.  However, I can't believe that Baldacci wrote Hell's Corner.  It was so slow, slow, slow and never came close to the intelligence and stunning on-the-edge-of-your-seat enjoyment of the other books.  I usually read Baldacci's books until I can't hold my eyes open anymore and then wake up at 4:00am to start again.  I literally had to make myself continue to pick this one up. It was like wading through mud.  Every time I picked it up I would think - are we in the same place again?  I don't mind paying the money but I waited for this book like a kid waiting for Christmas morning and Santa never showed up.  That won't stop me from running out to buy the next one of his books, but Hell's Corner was like ordering a banana split and ending up with a scoop of yellow snow!
B004IJZFP4|5.0|It's GREAT to hear some Quality Archival Tommy Bolin Teaser Material. The Original Teaser is an ABSOLUTE MASTERPIECE and I do hope we get its deserved sonic treatment someday. In the meantime this a fantastic romp that sounds spellbinding. Hats off to the team that put it out. Now all we need is the Teaser box set with both this and original Teaser. Thanks to those who did a Fantastic job on this Blissful Tommy Bolin Album! Tommy, your playing is the Best!
B001OQCV2E|1.0|Why make a real effort at writing a remotely believable story when you can just blow the screen up with a bunch of CGI?    Good for the kiddies maybe.    Insulting to the intelligence otherwise.    Woody and John must have been looking for a little weekend spending money or something.    Horrible.
B001UBNBNG|5.0|Grover has a problem. He learns that there is a monster at the end of the book. Grover is afraid of monsters. Grover tries heroic measures to try and stop the reader from turning pages which only moves Grover closer to the end of the book and monster. In the end, Grover is the monster at the end of the book.<br /><br />This is a great, fun story to read to small children who delight in \\"disobeying' Grover by continuing to turn pages.<br /><br />This is also a great \\"coping\\" book for anyone going through something fearful and difficult. As it always seems to be, anticipation can wreak havoc with emotions. This book teaches folks not to let worrying stop the progress.
0439023491|5.0|This is the second book in the Hunger Games Trilogy. It continues the story of Katniss Everdeen and the futuristic, post apocalyptic world of Panem. After winning the 74th Hunger Games, Katniss and her co-victor/lover Peeta return to their home District - District 12 - located in Appalachia and the poorest of the Districts (with the exception of 13, which has been obliterated). There are rumors of rebellion among the other districts, which hold Katniss up as their leader/figurehead. As a result of her, rebellion has been sparked and President Snow threatens to kill Katniss' family if she doesn't comply with his orders. After going through the districts on their victory tour and having Peeta propose, the two victors learn that the 75th hunger games will pit past victors against one another. The balance of the book is about the 75th Hunger Games.        I loved this novel as much as I loved The Hunger Games.  It is unique, has un anticipated twists and turns and I love the characters, even the ones that you're supposed to hate.  They are all so deep and their motivations multi-layered. Collins had done what many authors have tried, unsuccessfully, to do: write a deeply powerful sequel that rivals the depth and power of the first.  I can't wait to read the third!
044022425X|4.0|I wish Amazon had a 4.5 star because that is what this book deserves. A better-researched author is not out there! She makes history come alive. If you like historical fiction with a paranormal twist and don't mind ( or are thrilled) with saga-length...this is the series for you. Start with Outlander...
B004G5ZXVQ|3.0|Hearing \\"Mine Smell Like Honey\\" on Little Steven's \\"Underground Garage\\", their best single since Bill Berry was slapping the skins, predicated my decision to chance this. \\"Document\\" and \\"Automatic For the People\\" it isn't, but the listenability is undeniable. These veteran alt-rockers source those two worlds admirably but I'm not so positive this will serve more than as a temporary substitute to those classic records. The ringing guitars of the opener has strands of \\"The Finest Worksong\\". The musically pleasant \\"Uberlin\\" almost parrots \\"Monty Got A Raw Deal\\" in areas. A couple of the rockers don't escape banality. In terms of pointed observation, the ballad \\"Everyday Is Yours To Win\\" is on a par with  \\"Everybody Hurts\\", but it straddles the line of self-imitation. Better is the gentle buildup of the instrumentation that distinguishes \\"Me, Marlon Brando, Marlon Brando and I\\". Special thanks to Peaches and guitarist Lenny Kaye for lending some fire on the great \\"Alligator_Aviator_Autopilot_Antimatter\\". Also welcome again is Patti Smith and that priceless coda to \\"Blue\\". It's good to have you guys back because it hasn't been the same. ***1/2
1416550550|4.0|This book keeps you guessing and has some cross-era interest with mutli-generational family members that I found complicated in a fun way that kept it more in the category of can't-put-it-down. Mystery, light romance mixed with angst; well-done.
0393338827|3.0|Like other of Lewis' books, The Big Short is a great read. Although it does provide reading pleasure, it does not provide much insight into the cause(s) of the most recent financial crisis.  Also, the book has an obvious polemic/philosophical bent.  No policy conclusions should be inferred from it.  Just take the book for what it is:  terrific entertainment.
B0000AK7AA|5.0|I've been in love with this movie ever since I first watched it. I've only had it for a few weeks and I've watched it 3 times already!
1591843790|5.0|I make it my practice to read everything Guy K writes. His simple and direct style is so clear.  I will be using this book with a group of leaders that I coach.  I believe they will be inspired by Enchantment.  Get two copies- read one and give one away.<br />Hal Mayer
B00377V6J2|5.0|Blues lovers don't want to miss this one. Albert King was one of the best and Stevie Ray Vaughan excels at the blues. I recommend watching the DVD first. It's amazing to watch how both men get so much from a guitar and later, when you're just listening to the CD, it all comes back to you. If you like blues you won't be disappointed with this.
0375842209|1.0|I simply don't get what everyone loved about this book. I am forcing myself to finish it. It is just dull, dull, dull. The last time I felt this way about a book, I was reading The Story of Edgar Sawtelle. Another frustrating snooze.
1401230067|5.0|I bought the original version of the Hellblazer volume 1 trade-paperback a few years back. I read it, loved it, but could not afford the rest. It wasn't until recently that I was able to, but now I enter into a very holey place (pun not intended). Most of the trade-paperbacks are out of print and even when they weren't, they were still missing some of the comics from the earliest run. It's very tiring and trying to strive and find the complete story. And then I found this. This...reissued, re-released of the first trade-paperback.<br /><br />This version contains the first nine issues of the main series, \\"plus\\" Swamp Thing issue 76-77, a continuation of the story from the end of the Original Sins. As well as a brand new cover for the volume.<br /><br />To be honest, I was mad at first. I mean, I got this for the same price as I got the original version and this includes more of the story. But the art and coloring is unchanged, even for the Swamp Thing issues.<br /><br />But, after thinking about it for some time, I came to the conclusion: this is a good thing. It means, hopefully, that they well repackage, reissue, and re-release all of the older trade-paperbacks and even bring back some of the out of print volumes.<br /><br />It comes down to this:<br />Everything is exactly the same as the original release of \\"Original Sins.\\" Same issues, same coloring, same artwork, the only thing that they did add was the tie-in Swamp Thing issues, which is a cool bonus for this. This will hopefully lead to more trade-paperbacks coming out with previous unreleased issues and out of print stories. The book already got 4/5 stars from me the first time, now with added bonuses and new hopes it's now 5/5 stars.<br /><br />EDIT* Thanks to N.J. \\"Nadare\\" for the correction.
0446563048|4.0|I'm glad I read the introduction, so I was aware that Tony Hseih decided not to use the help of a ghost writer for this book. At first, I had to wonder if it was a wise choice, because the narrative seemed almost like a simple chronological retelling of events and the language is fairly pedestrian.     As I got further in, however, and started to understand the unusual choices that Hseih has made and the authentic way that he seems to approach everything, it started to make sense. In fact, it's a ballsy choice that, while questionable at first, seems to play out brilliantly.     Pretty sure that's just how Tony rolls.     Great book.

B003UESJHO|4.0|Based on a true story \\"The Fighter\\" takes us into the lives of two boxers; Dicky Ward(Oscar winner Christian Bale) who had his chance but didn't succeed fighting solace in crack and his younger brother Mickey (Mark Wahlberg)who Dicky is coaching. Their mom (Oscar winner Melissa Leo) focuses more on Dicky because he didn't make it and emotionally he appears to need the support while Mickey becomes nothing more than a vessel in which they store their hopes and dreams. When Mickey meets Charlene (Amy Adams) he realizes he has a chance to pursue his dream of a title fight but he feels he must break away from Dicky to succeed.<br /><br />David Russell's film is a marvelous glimpse into the complex relationships in this fractured family and their dreams.<br /><br />The DVD has looks quite good and the special features which include Russell's commentary track, \\"The Warrior's Code\\" about shooting the movie, \\"Keeping the Faith\\" a featurette about Lowell the city where the Ward's lived and deleted scenes.<br /><br />It's worth picking up and enjoyable film.
B000VFGQUC|5.0|It is too bad to read the reviews about bad/no sound on the DVD, that sucks.    As for the DVD's with sound, this is a great show. I remember watching a late night music show around 1978/79 as a teenager, a huge Lizzy fan back then, and the video clip was of \\"Cowboy Song\\" from this same concert. That live version of Cowboy Song really put me over the edge as a Lizzy fan and I am still haunted by that melody. Having this specific DVD start with \\"Boys are Back\\" and not that great rendition of \\"Cowboy\\" takes a slight bit off this recording.    That said, you really get a good deal with this set as it includes not only the L&D concert but another show with Sykes (not as intimiate), the hilarious \\"Top of the Pops\\" videos, and a great interiew with the Boys.    For the L&D show, seeing the audience right on top of the band and literally boucing half on the stage during a rollicking Emerald brings you right into the act. Watching BR forcefully remove his guitar from an eager fan's hand grab is awesome. But what makes the concert so special is the whole sequence and rythym of all the songs. From rocking tunes (Boys, Massacre, Emerald, Suicide) to ballads (Still in Love) back to Baby Drives my Crazy and ending with one of the best finale songs ever - Me and the Boys, you get a great workout. Lynott just did not pour out hard rock all the time; he wanted to show us that he was a poet and the variety of music he produced, and shown to us in this show, tells us that he was one-in-a-million.
B002ZG99A4|3.0|The loudest, dumbest, macho-est, shooting-est action film ever?  Well, obviously there's a lot of competition, but this one's sure a contender.  Sylvester Stallone leads this testosterone-heavy cast... He's getting a bit old and lumbering for this stuff, but he's still having fun. Nice cameo by Arnold, too.  This flick is silly and stupid, but it doesn't pretend for a moment to be anything else: you get exactly what you'd expect... and more!   (Axton)
0956827810|5.0|Being a man myself, I thought that I had a pretty good handle on my own thoughts and feelings. Little did I know, this little book blew the lid off my pre-conceived notions of masculinity. If you are looking for some kind of vapid, time-consuming fluff to occupy your mind for a few minutes, look elsewhere. This book contains nothing but the deepest, darkest secrets every man has locked deep within his psyche.
1591843790|4.0|\\"Enchantment\\" is one of those books that is loaded with ideas that give you pause.  I read it while at a conference in Florida, so I was more predisposed than normal to running with some of his ideas.  Sitting around a pool drinking umbrella drinks can do that for you!  Although I kept thinking about that \\"South Pacific\\" song, \\"Some Enchanted Evening\\".<br /><br />Frankly,  the early chapters are a bit apple pie, but the more you reflect on them, the more you realize very few people engage in the behavior Guy is suggesting.  Yes, we want to be liked and trusted, but we meet so many people that never take concrete steps to change peoples (customers, employees, stakeholders) perceptions of them.  At our core, we all want to delight and fascinate people and Kawasaki grabs that basic principal and skillfully wrestles with it for 200 pages.<br /><br />Kawasaki builds on the basics of likeability and trust with fun and amusing (he actually is very funny), ways to counter resistors and skeptics.  He reminds the reader over and over that you have to have the truth on your side.  In other words, your product or service has to have value and then enchantment builds on that basic truth.  You can only polish a turd so much!<br /><br />The mid and later chapters are filled with great ideas on how to implement an enchantment strategy.  How to use push and pull technologies, how to enchant customers, bosses and employees.  Finally, Kawasaki shares the secrets for how not to fall for the unethical enchanter.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed Enchantment.  It falls into that business book category of \\"tons of good stuff.\\"  If you implement 5% in your life or business, you'll be better off and possibly even \\"enchanting.\\"
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This is a very usable camera bag.  Well made for the average user, but probably not sufficient for a pro that would carry it every day.  Good padding, and pockets for extras.  My only complaint would be that the straps for a tripod could be better, and not located where the tripod hinders access to one of the extras pockets.  The only improvement I would suggest is more extras storage, and maybe more storage or tie-ons for things such as a jacket.  Overall though, for the average person going out for a hike with camera gear, this is a great pack for money, a very good value when compared to the name brand bags of similar size.  And this bag does have the size, it is not one of those little things like the name brands offer.
B000001FDQ|1.0|Scales and Arpeggios are not music. There is a concept known as melody. Melody is a series of note choices which create a dialog and tell a story. Call and response, tension and release. Yngwie sounds like a hyperactive cocaine induced nightmare. the lightning fast mediocre technique of an adolecent which could \\"SHOW PROMISE\\" if, it weren't for his condition. I believe they give Ritalin to AD/HD disorder. Giving him a dose high enough might pose a health risk, although, It is a risk humanity deserves. The real sad part is not his awful playing, but, the droves of non-classically trained people who are fascinated by his garbage offerings. How sad that an ego so large is perplexed by what is generally considered the centerpiece of any musical composition. MELODY. - JB
B000LAZDQA|5.0|This is one of the most fabulous movies ever created. It takes you on a wild ride of sexuality exploring the lives of interesting characters. This movie is made by the same creator of Hedwig and the Angry Inch, John Cameron Mitchell, and features the best cabaret singer of his generation Justin Vivian Bond. I highly highly recommend watching this video. Be aware it contains EXPLICIT SEXUAL CONTENT, but it is fabulous.
B003LXM1GY|5.0|Third album from the wonderful NYC based band Scissor Sisters. After four years they come back with an amazing alnum you wanna dance from the beginning to end. LP comes with lovely poster.
B001BN1ZHW|5.0|Let me start off by saying this review is for the blu-ray version of the film. As for the film itself, in my personal opinion, I haven't been a fan of films released in recent years that try and portray musicals or Broadway shows such as \\"Phantom of The Opera,\\" \\"Hair Spray,\\" and \\"Chicago\\" just to name a few. Don't get me wrong, on Broadway, they are GREAT, however the theatrical renditions just don't \\"tickle my fancy.\\" However this film really surprised me in that it met...no, exceeded my expectations. I remember seeing it in the theater on opening night, and right from the very beginning, when the tune begins to play and you hear the low \\"humming\\" roar of the organ chime...it was FANTASTIC! Now, mind you, a majority of the \\"singing\\" wasn't really all that great, but that's not to say the acting and performances giving weren't. I loved the performances offered up by each of the actors and actresses; they were really top-notch! Where the blu-ray kicks in real well is showing off the clarity of the magnificently thought-up sets and locations offered through the bizarre mind of Tim Burton. I also own the regular DVD version of this film, and I can honestly say the difference is very noticeable. Yet don't take my word for it, this film NEEDS to be seen, and thus you should go out and see for yourself! I won't give away any plot-points or anything of that nature, but be forewarned that this film is very graphic, so keep that in mind before viewing. I think that just makes it all the more fun though; especially considering that its a musical on top of it all! Very fun, lots of dark humor, a wonderful cast, and great music! Don't pass this one up!
1591843790|5.0|...........The art of changing hearts, minds, and actions.    You need to know how enchantment works and apply that to create an organization that will  flourish. The benefits are then available for all stakeholders (not only the shareholders).  It is really a book which totally is in line with my ProPer philosophy, i.e. to be successful you need to address  PROfessional (e.g. usage of technology)  as well as PERsonal (likeability; how to enchant your employees) aspects. In a very clear and concise way it is explained how you can create an enchanting (and thus a ProPer) organization.    By the way, here is a test to check how enchanting you are, right now --most people score in the low teens [...]    When you enchant people, your goal is to fill them with great delight. That is exactly the only real differentiator: delighting your customers!    Extensively it is described how you can create trust. I would say that trust is today's most important currency. Nothing will work without trust.     For this book, Guy has consulted approximately twenty books about influence and persuasion, from Dale Carnegie to Robert Cialdini. So, it is not really one book, it offers knowledge and experience from many sources, and is more like a three-in-one book.  It covers:    - How to launch/start up an organization  - How to build lasting relationships  - How to (ProPerly) use new technologies    I really loved this description:    \\"There are two kinds of people and organizations in the world: eaters and bakers. Eaters want a bigger slice of an existing pie; bakers want to make a bigger pie. Eaters think that if they win, you lose, and if you win, they lose. Bakers think that everyone can win with a bigger pie.\\"    How can you create a bigger pie? The key to enchantment is a great cause. Guy provides this list of qualities for great products and great services:    - Deep  - Intelligent  - Complete  - Empowering  - Elegant    So, this book is a really the handbook for the 21st century entrepreneur. Read it and apply it!
B00005B5L4|2.0|OK, I've struggled with this.  I really wanted to like this DVD, and tried so hard.  Even spent some serious bucks to buy the DVD-Audio disc.  I have always liked this album.  Yes, album - bought it in the 70s as an LP, long before CDs existed.  I don't know the history of Fleetwood Mac and can't speak to the topic of how the original band compares to this iteration.  And I won't speak to \\"Rumours\\" as to its relevance as a statement of the 70s.  I can only speak about the DVD-Audio/surround disc versus the original CD.  I had great hopes.  Many other 5.1 surround audio releases have been absolutely incredible.  This one is not the case.  The \\"surround\\" aspect is marginal at best.  The mixing and engineering seem experimental and flimsy, and actually detract from the original work.  Cases in point:  \\"Never Going Back\\" now has a gratuitous and trite solo, and drums (?!!?) in the middle of what was once a beautiful, simple interplay of acoustic guitars and vocals.  I was actually pissed off when I first heard it, and have yet to \\"get used to it.\\"  Then there's \\"Go Your Own Way.\\"  I have always loved the exchange between electric (rhythm) and acoustic guitar throughout this song.  In the DVD mix, the electric guitar is muted to the point that it's tough to even hear, and the song feels a little empty.  In general, the surround mix is actually worse than the original CD.  As for the added track, \\"Silver Springs,\\" not so good.  I don't particularly care for Stevie Nicks, but \\"bonus tracks\\" have become typical.  At the end of a CD, though - not right in the middle of things.  Another \\"pissed-off\\" moment.    Bottom line:  Don't waste precious $$ on this one, especially given what it now goes for ($75+).  Your money is much better spent getting a copy of \\"HD Audio Solo Ultra\\" (cirlinca.com) and up-sampling your own DVD from the CD to 24-bit/48kHz/5.1 channel.  I was skeptical, but this program is pretty amazing, and breathes new life into the CD that the surround-sound thatthis DVD doesn't.  The end result for Rumours, and other CDs, was impressive.  In my opinion, for Rumours the 24-bit 5.1 up-mix is far better than the DVD-A disc.    Just my $0.02 worth.
B001EN71DG|2.0|This product was received on time as expected, however, when the disc were put in the DVD/BluRay players, one of the three disks made a rattling sound. It was inspected and found that that disk was warped and was not spinning properly. All three disks were send back without a problem.
B000002H33|3.0|in 1986 Metallica gave fans what they wanted, more of the same thrash metal of 1984's 'Ride the Lightening', mixed with moodier acoustic sections and some complex guitar soloing. They did that with 'Master of puppets'.    While this gave the fans exactly what they wanted, some listeners may be taken aback at how similar this albums sounds to the earlier one. In fact, 'Master of puppets' is very much a clone album; Metallica had a good thing going, and very few people sounded like that in the mid 1980's, so why not give listeners more of the same? Good point. However, clone albums lack the excitement of seeing something wonderful being formed before the musicians eyes as they finally 'find' that sound they've been looking for.     The first side to this album is like a mirror to the first side of 'Ride the Lightening'. So the opening 'Battery' is this albums' 'Fight fire with fire', 'Welcome home(sanitarium)' is this albums 'Fade to Black', etc. Trouble is, these songs feel more by the numbers and lack a lot of the inspiration; remember on 'Fight fire with fire' how there was an amazing burst of energy as the acoustic bit gave way to that amazing shred-metal sound?  there is simply not a moment here that approaches that. When they do something here that they had already done on 'Lightening' it feels rehearsed. That is not to say these songs aren't good, they are, but they aren't in the same league as 'For Whom the Bell Tolls' and 'Creeping Death', not close, really.    The second side here doesn't really mirror the second side of the last album, except for there being an 8-minute instrumental. This helps, 'Disposable Heroes' is the best cut on the whole album; feels more fresh and invigorating. However, while the instrumental 'Orion' is a great track with some unexpected slow-blues lead guitar licks in the middle, the other two songs, 'Lepper Messiah' and particularly 'Damage Inc.' aren't particularly good songs.     Overall, 'Master of Puppets' is a good thrash-metal album with more of the same formula that delivered the goods with 'Ride the Lightening', but it lacks the freshness and inspiration of that earlier album. Rating ***
B002VPE1AW|5.0|I was hesitant about watching this movie. I was not a big fan of what I thought was a digital film. I am hooked on this movie. I love Sam Worhtington now and watch this film over and over. The color and music make this movie also. I recommend this film to everyone. Fantastic!!

B002ZNJW0O|4.0|Nicholas Sparks' reputation of being an author of captivating and emotional love stories does not fall short in his book called \\"The Choice.\\" This enchanting love story gives hope to those that haven't found love and appreciation to those who have. Its unpredictable storyline has a way of keeping the reader fervently flipping pages to the very end. Sparks does an amazing job of portraying the deep love that two people can feel for each other. His realistic representations of the ups and downs we all experience in our relationships allow the reader to better relate to the characters and the hardships they face.     Travis and Gabby are the perfect example of the kind of love any one of us would be lucky to find. It teaches the reader to never settle for less than they deserve and that sometimes we find love when we least expect it. The book's unexpected twist at the end makes the reader cherish their loved ones and see that we shouldn't take what we have for granted. We never know what kind of difficulties or trials we will be faced with. \\"The Choice\\" shows the reader that our time with loved ones is fragile and can be taken away in the blink of an eye. We never know what second may be our last with the ones we care for.    I truly enjoyed reading this book and look forward to reading Sparks' other books as well.
B002VPE1PW|5.0|I bought this sleeve to protect my iPad2 when i carry it around in my larger backpack. The size of this sleeve is just perfect, i can put my iPad2 with smart cover on it in easily. The material of it is very comfortable to crab and it's thick enough to provide protection for whatever is inside. I also like how it's black outside and orange inside, it's pretty. Moreover, the price Amazon offers is incredibly affordable comparing to other sleeves/bags. Great product, Amazon!
B002HNAAZ8|5.0|Wow, surprising good, I absolutely love this cd.  It's different than their first 2 albums, but in very good way.  This album can easily be mistaken for Def Leppard (perhaps a follow-up to 'Adrenalize' album or something), but make no mistake, this is definitely DD sound.  There are plenty of great song writing here and powerful ballads.  Tones like \\"Killin' Love\\", \\"Never Give Up\\" and \\"Fugitive\\" are some my favorite ballads.  Also, great catchy tones like \\"Keep On Keepin' On\\", \\"Heart on the highway\\" and \\"That's what I'm talking about\\" make this album complete.  I haven't give a 5-stars review on Amazon for quite sometime, but this is certainly deserve it.  I highly recommend it.
B004A8ZX28|3.0|************This review contains spoilers***********<br /><br />If you liked the movie \\"Taken\\"(2008) with Liam Neeson as a former CIA operative saving his daughter in France from the mafia that kidnaps the girls and forced them into prostitution, you should like the new movie Unknown (2011) with Neeson in the title role of an American scientist, Dr. Martin Harris, who arrived  with his young beautiful wife Beth (January Jones) in Berlin to give a speech on the biotechnology summit. Just minutes after arrival, Dr. Harris fell into a coma as a result of  a car accident and after four days of coma awaking in a Berlin hospital, he found out that no one, including his own wife does not recognize him, and that his identity and his all life was taken by another person with the same name. If you are a fan of Neeson - the film should appeal to you. Neeson has tremendous screen presence and charisma.  Looks like age is no obstacle to him. The cast also includes two beautiful actresses, January Jones and Diane Kruger. The scene between two veteran actors, Bruno Ganz and Frank Langella elevates the film above its genre. If you are a fan of the twisted thriller / mystery / action / suspense, and not just one but double or even triple twists and turns, you should not read this but run and watch the movie. :)  Seriously, it is exciting, gripping and suspenseful film. It seemed predictable in the beginning but it surprised me with its revelations in the final part. I think the first film in what may become the series, \\"Leam Neeson's dangerous adventures in Europe\\", Taken is better because I truly rooted for Bryan/Neeson. Taken's twists and turns concerned more the identities of the \\"bad guys\\", and as questionable Bryan's actions were, I always wanted him to succeed and find his daughter before it was too late. Unknown is morally ambiguous. I think the title is very appropriate with the constant developments of the character as his memory of the events before his accident began coming back but the movie's got too many holes in the plot to make as convincing case for Dr. Harris as it was for Bryan Mills.<br /><br />*****************Major Spoilers. Don't read if you did not see the film. ***********************************<br /><br />Unknown makes you think that perhaps bumping one's head and felling into coma could actually help to clear the head in reality and to cure the very dangerous terrorists by changing their outlook completely. Unknown also suggests that no matter how carefully and thoroughly you plan the major secret operation, thinking that you predicted and backed up everything and everybody, there is always something you'd overlook or simply could not fathom.<br /><br />***************End of Spoilers****************************************************************************<br /><br />As its predecessor Taken, Unknown is enjoyable action/thrillers/mystery. Its plot may not be original -Frantic/Fugitive/Total Recall/Bourne Identity and last year's Shutter Island inevitably come to mind but good acting, Neeson's likability, fast and furious car chase and crash scenes and plenty twists and turns however implausible they are, made Unknown a lot of fun for me to watch in the theater last weekend.<br /><br />In addition, the film can be recorded in the Guinness Book of Records for the number of deadly car crushes one character was involved in.<br /><br />3.5/5but the movie's got too many holes in the plot to make as convincing case for Dr. Harris as it was for Bryan Mills.     *****************Major Spoilers.

B001IYCMNA|5.0|Have 4 of these across our warehouse and office. Three are covering 100k sq feet with racks that are full. The 4th is for the office. They were easy to setup and the range was much better than anticipated.     Make sure you upgrade to the latest firmware before installing!
B003L20IJM|5.0|Very good movie. Not as good as the first Nanny McPhee, only because you kind of knew what to expect, but still very entertaining, and very imaginative. Good family movie.
B004L3AR0K|4.0|The movie starts out as a great man's comedy with Jake Gyllenhaal charming every woman from 8 to 80 selling them lower tier electronics. This basically lasted through the credits as he gets fired for being a little too charming with the boss's girlfriend in the stock room. His family has money and he gets a job as a Pfizer salesman, something the movie makes out to be an evil job. He uses his charm and ability to have casual sex to sell drugs. During this time he meets Anne Hathaway (multiple nude scenes, thank you Anne) and they have incredible casual sex. The movie was great up to this point. Then we find out Anne has Parkinson's disease which is why she is a free spirit.<br /><br />Jake falls in love, turning this into \\"Love Story\\", then the comedy simply dies.<br /><br />Some crude humor, sex, nudity, f-bomb.

0060512806|5.0|I didn't figure out what was really going on until around page 870 or so, & I didn't know how it was going to actually end until the very last word of a 1130-page book. I was hooked from beginning to end, despite the very quirky story filled with Kafka-esque absurdity.    I'm not even a hacker, nor a math guy. I simply love well-written books about interesting characters, & this one leaped to the top of my list by the time I finished it. Superb writing, often very funny, loaded with fascinating insights .... this book should not be missed by anyone who just wants to be entirely absorbed by a fine writer. Don't miss it.
B000UR9T82|5.0|This review is for the Spider-Man: Ultimate High Definition trilogy Box Set.<br /><br />It contains the following films:  \\"Spider-Man\\" (2002), \\"Spider-Man 2\\" (2004), \\"Spider-Man 2.1\\" (an extended cut of Spider-Man 2 featuring some new sequences, and some entirely different alternate scenes) and \\"Spider-Man 3\\" (2007).<br /><br />As for the films, I'd rate them as such:<br />\\"Spider-Man\\" ...  8 out of 10<br />\\"Spider-Man 2/2.1\\" ...  10 out of 10<br />\\"Spider-Man 3\\" ...  7 out of 10 (I didn't hate it, it had a charm and a lot of good factors, despite it's obvious large faults.)<br /><br />The Blu-Ray image is pretty incredible.  I already owned all three on DVD, but I wanted to upgrade, as these films deserve the High-Def treatment.  All three look significantly better, compared to their standard-def DVD counterparts.  The first \\"Spider-Man\\" is the least dramatic upgrade, but the image is still clearer, sharper and more detailed...  I was able to see a lot of things I missed on DVD (I didn't realize how much of the image was lost on DVD from compression and whatnot, because every shot I was seeing things I hadn't seen since the movie theater in 2002)- so even though it wasn't the greatest Blu-Ray picture quality, it was still definitely worth the upgrade.<br /><br />The second and third films are where the High-Def image pays off, though!  I had just watched the second and third films days before this set arrived on DVD, and it is like night and day.  \\"Spider-Man 2\\" was astounding in terms of how much more I could see in the image.  You felt like you could reach into the movie.  Textures looked real (DVD won't give you that), colors were brighter, small things (sparks, bits of glass, sweat, water) had astonishingly more detail.  It was a huge upgrade.  And \\"Spider-Man 3\\" was just as incredible- what really got me is that you could literally see things that are invisible on the DVD (Ex. You can see every single speck of sand during the Sandman scenes, and when we see the news broadcast towards the end of the film, I couldn't see the \\"horizontal TV lines\\" on DVD at all, whereas here, they're clearly visible.).<br /><br />I can't comment much for sound, as I just play my sound through the TV speakers, but judging from that, everything is mixed well.<br /><br />The special features are where this review almost slips- the only special features are those from \\"Spider-Man 3\\", which felt a bit odd.  They are cool features, but it seemed like a missed opprotunity.<br /><br />But all in all, the price (which has come down a lot) makes it worth it.  You can find really good quality used or even new copies in the $25-$35 range, so I can't complain much about the features- the price is right, the quality is amazing, and what features there are, are very solid.<br /><br />I'd highly recommend this set!  Great films.
B0017KIBAI|5.0|I have been looking for a gamecube controller for my wii for a while now and noticed this one.  It has been the best looking one I have seen anywhere.  There are so many pros that made this buy easy for me considering the length of the cord, it matches the wii:) and it is a must for most of the games, especially if you want to play the gamecube games.  I am now thinking of buying another!
B00008OWZC|4.0|I didnt know what to expect with this but once it was played, you carnt take it out of the player.  All tracks are live which makes it even better and the drum solo in Moby Dick is just sensational.  Whatever you do, get a copy if you love led zep.

B003VANOFY|4.0|I purchased the Logitech G930 for two purposes: 1) Gaming; 2) VOIP phone calls on my PC.    1) As for gaming, the surround sound is amazing.  I use it with Call of Duty, and I can hear where every footstep, gunshot, and explosion are coming from.  I do however hear some occasional clipping (fuzz-type noise), but It is mostly curable through adjusting the sound on either the game or the headset... just need to mess around with it a little bit to find the best audio settings.    2) For VOIP Calls on the PC, it works great.  I'm just using my Google Voice/Talk from my browser, and the mic is very clear and crisp.  Audio is great.    The only other issue is the headrest on the top... The foam pad is not very wide, so the pressure of the headset resting on your head is focused in one area - I'd prefer it to be more flat/wide.  But overall, this is a great headset, and (so far) worth the money.
0736092269|5.0|This is a wonderful book which really gives great insight to muscle recruitment during exercise, as a important I must make clear that it isn't a workout regiment book but rather a book explaining physiology of exercise. Until I bought this I had no idea of how influential doing a dead lift was, it really helped me to better understand how to work my entire body and admitedly facilitated my choices of workouts to improve my regiment.

B004I2K4DY|5.0|I loved this concert as much as I did the 10th anniversary.  Appreciated and noted the subtle but effective lyric changes and loved the cast.  I even have to give kudos to Nick Jonas.  This isn't his background, it probably isn't his world (musical theater) but you could see that he gave it his all and while he could learn more about connecting  with his fellow performers on stage (eye contact!), his voice wasn't as strong as the others, and his face was a little too stern all the time, it didn't ruin the show for me - he was endearing and he sung his heart out.  It was lovely seeing Michael Ball and many of the others at the end.  Lea playing the role of Fantine was great - she's such as pro; and Alfie, oh Alfie your voice brings my heart to life!  Great DVD - I'll probably play it 100 times before I know it!!

B0043GAZYS|4.0|I didn't really know what to expect but was pleasantly surprised. It was funny and unique. The only downer was that a week after I purchased the movie, the price was lowered by almost ten dollars :(
B000WMEAKC|5.0|Well I got their second CD and now I finally got the first CD. It is great and I like nearly every song on it. Not much else to say and other reviews will probably do a much better job at explaining each song. Still, Stop and Stare and Apologize (especially remix) are great. Goodbye Apathy, Tyrant, and Someone to Save you are also really good.
0060765488|4.0|Like JACK AND THE BEANSTALK, ALICE IN WONDERLAND, HARRY POTTER, THE WIZARD OF OZ and so many other children's stories that have entered the realm of literature classics, THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE begins with the discovery of an obscure gateway into another land. Peter, Susan, and Edmund Pevensie, children living with their uncle in a sprawling country house in the English countryside believe their youngest sister's stories of her visit to an enchanted winterbound land ruled by an evil white witch to be the product of an overheated imagination. For no other reason than to humour her and to prove her story wrong, they skeptically follow her into a dark, musty wardrobe. To their great surprise, they find they have all walked through a magical portal into the country known as Narnia.<br /><br />On the surface, THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE is a simple children's allegory with characters drawn from a deep well of literary predecessors including English folk tales and Norse and Greek mythology - talking animals, Mr and Mrs Beaver, Father Christmas, dwarves and giants, fauns, unicorns and centaurs, dryads, sentient trees, a snarling, frightful wolf who is the henchman of the evil white queen, black magic, and a great lion called Aslan who mysteriously returns from an extended absence to help Narnia's beleaguered subjects release the magical grip of a never-ending bleak, icy winter and allow the return of the much longed for beauty and warmth of spring and summer.<br /><br />But, at a deeper level, CS Lewis is well known for his Christian references and this story is no exception. Virtually any adult reader will recognize Aslan's heroic self-sacrifice to save Edmund's life and his return from death atop the witch's Stone Table as a clear symbolic allusion to Christ's crucifixion for the redemption of earth's sinners and his resurrection from the dead. While some readers may disagree, I found the allusions considerably less than subtle. While they were entirely obvious, almost painfully so, they were also, perhaps paradoxically, unobtusive and neither pedantic nor sermonizing. As a result, readers of any faith (or lack thereof) will be able to accept and enjoy the symbolism or simply ignore it and focus on the charm of the story as it might be seen from a child's point of view.<br /><br />The obvious overriding theme is good versus evil and, as is the case with most children's stories, good will out. The ending, not unexpectedly, is a suitably happy one that will satisfy a child reader or perhaps a youngster who is happily listening to a parent reading the story over several nights before bedtime.

As a result, readers of any faith (or lack thereof) will be able to accept and enjoy the symbolism or simply ignore it and focus on the charm of the story as it might be seen from a child's point of view.<br /><br />The obvious overriding theme is good versus evil and, as is the case with most children's stories, good will out. The ending, not unexpectedly, is a suitably happy one that will satisfy a child reader or perhaps a youngster who is happily listening to a parent reading the story over several nights before bedtime. Highly recommended.<br /><br />Paul Weisslmost painfully so, they were also, perhaps paradoxically, unobtusive and neither pedantic nor sermonizing.

B001AX60KU|4.0|This review also applies to [[ASIN:B000G7PO6W Elvis: '68 Comeback]] and [[ASIN:B00025L42Q Elvis: The '68 Comeback Special (Three-Disc Deluxe Edition)]]    I bought this collection some time ago, and am generally pleased with it.  I also have the MEMORIES and TIGER MAN collections from 1998, as well as the two DVD sets listed above.  Next time around, Legacy should do the following:    For the casual Elvis fan:  A CD/DVD package, with the audio CD containing the best performances of each song from the four concerts, and the studio master recordings in stereo (similar to Disc 1 of MEMORIES, but with stereo versions of \\"If I Can Dream, \\"\\"Memories,\\" and \\"A Little Less Conversation,\\"  and the alternate vocal version of \\"If I Can Dream\\" from 06/30/68).    The DVD (or Blu-ray) should be a nice long edit of all of the songs in the show, from both the live and the studio segments - basically, an expanded version of the 2006 SPECIAL EDITION with any missing songs included.    For the rabid Elvis fan:  A 5-CD set similar to this release, with Disc 1 containing ONLY the tracks that appeared on the original vinyl LP (LPM-4088).  Disc 2 would have all of the stereo master takes - \\"If I Can Dream,\\" \\"Memories,\\" \\"A Little Less Conversation,\\" the unedited \\"Trouble/Guitar Man\\" sequence, the complete Gospel Medley, the complete Road Medley, and the alternate vocal version of \\"If I Can Dream\\" from 06/30/68. Disc 3 would have the rehearsals, Disc 4 would have the first \\"sit-down\\" and \\"stand-up\\" shows, and Disc 5 would have the second \\"sit-down\\" and \\"stand-up\\" shows.    The DVD (or Blu-ray) set should have four discs:  Disc 1 should be the original special, EXACTLY as it aired on NBC in December 1968, with the Peacock logo (\\"The following [special] program is brought to you in Living Color on NBC\\"), and the original Singer commercials (which can also be skipped).  The deleted bordello sequence, which was a little racy for 1968, although tame by today's standards, can be a separate section, with an option enabling the user to view the entire program with the deleted sequences included, in context with the rest of the show.  Disc 2 should have the first \\"sit-down\\" and \\"stand-up\\" shows; Disc 3 should have the second \\"sit-down\\" and \\"stand-up\\" shows; and all of the outtakes, music videos, promos, etc., scattered through the 2004 set, should be together on the fourth disc so that fans don't have to skip or sit through them on different discs, as they do now.    The CD and DVD/Blu-ray sets can be sold separately, or together in a big Deluxe Set.    Because there is always the possibility of new audio or video outtakes being discovered somewhere, no set of this or any other work will ever be totally complete, but what I have suggested will be close enough for both.

B004C4IKCU|5.0|ELVIS IS BACK was the King's first post-Army album and is one of his finest.  Although Elvis recorded some binaural stereo sides in the late '50s, which were released years later, this was his first album in RCA's &#34;Living Stereo&#34;  (as opposed to the &#34;Full Dimensional&#34; variety at Capitol, and Columbia's &#34;Stereo-Fidelity,&#34; later renamed &#34;Stereo-360 Sound.&#34;)<br /><br />This CD contains all 12 tracks from the original album, the 12 tracks from its &#34;pop&#34; sequel, SOMETHING FOR EVERYBODY, and the hit singles from the period (excluding movie songs).  Interestingly, all of the hit singles are featured on [[ASIN:B000P46PZK Elvis' Golden Records, Volume 3]], except for the B-side &#34;A Mess Of Blues,&#34; which is included on [[ASIN:B000002W1W Elvis' Gold Records, Volume 4]]. If RCA had swapped &#34;A Mess Of Blues&#34; with &#34;She's Not You,&#34; all of the period hit singles would have been included on [[ASIN:B000P46PZK Elvis' Golden Records, Volume 3]].<br /><br />While not as comprehensive as the FTD version, which is really aimed at hard-core collectors, this is a terrific release for most Elvis fans.  Along with the [[ASIN:B002BX4VEK From Elvis In Memphis (40th Anniversary Legacy Edition)]] from 1969, these two albums, which bookended the '60s, are definitely must-haves.
B002ZG99TA|1.0|Yet another cliché-ridden and factually insulting movie from Tony Scott, a director with perhaps one-tenth the integrity and artistry of his brother Ridley. The absurdities of the various methods Scott portrays as attempts to stop the runaway train are little more than an insult to any sort of logic or intelligence, all the more so since it is claimed that the movie is based on a true incident. Just some examples:  if you can get a train engine just ahead of the runaway engine you simply have someone transfer from that engine's rear to the front of the runaway one; or when both trains were on the same track, have Denzel Washington reverse his, let the runaway train catch up to him, and have Chris Pine climb over to it and stop it that way; or if you decide to derail the beast and the mechanism to be used for some reason may be or proves to be unreliable, one single track removed manually or by explosives will do.     But there appears to also be another problem with the movie no one seems to have caught. Twice Scott tries to ramp up the tension with near collisions with oncoming trains that just make it onto a safe siding - the second time after losing at least half of their cars in a collision with the runaway one. On the first occasion the runaway train would be able to pass through the switch despite it being open to the siding - unless the switch is locked in trains moving in the opposite direction will just move the angled tracks back to the normal straightaway configuration and pass along safely. But on the second occasion Washington's train was still moving onto the siding when the runaway train reached the switch. Heavy cars were already on the switched rails at the time, in other words, and it's almost impossible to believe that the runaway train could have simply plowed through and pushed the rails back straight without some debris getting in the way or damaging the rails at some point near the switch. Logically a derailment of the passing train should ensue, and the film should end at that point, instead of going on to the incredible scene of thousands of tons of train angled up on just one rail in the ninety degree curve without completely destroying both the rail and most likely the ancient appearing bridge it's fastened to!      But that's okay, no doubt people who leave their brains at the theater door will be fully entertained. I just hope they remembered to pick their brains up when they left.
B002ZG980A|5.0|i love this movie it was very gay. but in a good way if you kno what i meen. its funny sad and a prison break movie. all i got to say is Jim carrey is awesome in this movie i give it a 5 out of 5      o and if you dont want to see it bc its a movie about 2 gay guys dont let that stop you im as str8 as they come and i loved it     take it ez guys and i hope you like it as much as i did
B0034G4OXQ|2.0|What a disappointment!  I don't care who starred or who directed, this film is  unbelievably shallow.  AND I wonder what other reviewers expected from Eastwood  and Damon, in order to praise it so highly?  Like life, I know it's all about  our individual expectations, no?    The separate story lines, one in the UK, in France, and, of course, in the US are just too messy.  By that I mean that it's too hard to follow each, when they're not carefully integrated into the whole.  For example, do you enjoy endless dialog in French with subtitles?  I do not. Or Brits with mumbled and often too heavily accented lines? Nope.  And all of that is before the downright silly, but primary relationship, if you can call it that, between the hero and his dopey brother.  Substance, Mr. Eastwood, substance is called for and usually you deliver that.  Are you just too tired to make the effort anymore?  I hope not.
B000Y9Q59W|5.0|I purchased an oldie but a goodies in \\"Blu-Ray' Wall Street from Amazon.  What an excellent movie, and coincidentally and ironically depicts what is happpening on Wall Street today, crooks robbing us of our investments, and know one is going to jail for it. And our government allows this to happen everyday with our, the tax paying citizens, money.  And we as a country are doing nothing about it.  Great movie, fast shipping from Amazon. Highly recommended movie. Think I was kidding about Wall Street??  [...]   How come we've \\"NEVER\\" heard this one on the evening news???  You will absolutely NOT believe this but it's true, and it's happening.
B0041KKYBA|4.0|This film goes to the heart of the broken financial system in the US and how it affected the rest of the world. Fortunately, the rest of the planet placed tighter regulation on their institutions, but all one has to do in America is read the newspapers or look outside ones own front door to see where and why, the American dream for the masses is just that, a dream while we sheepishly play into investing every aspect of our lives for the greedy top 1% of the populations profit.<br /><br />Beginning with Reagan and continuing with Obama, this film shows how deregulation and unnaccountability in America's financial industry robbed the tax payers while rewarding the banking CEOs and Wallstreet culture, complete with prostitution and cocaine. This film should be mandated in public schools and colleges if only to bring awareness to why and how future generations will earn less money and be less educated than previous generations of this nation.<br /><br />It is no big mystery that before Bush Jr. left office, he fleeced the nation through orchestrating a costly and unnecessary war, bailing out Wallstreet and the banks and placing the wolves in charge of federal agencies. It amazes and dumbfounds me as to why the American populace are so limp and weak to their government so that what's left of us working Americans do work longer hours for less pay?<br /><br />As the man says near the end of the film,<br /><br />\\"Why should a financial engineer be paid 4 to 100 times more than a real engineer. A real engineer builds bridges. A financial engineer builds dreams. And you know, when those dreams turn out to be nightmares, other people pay for it.\\"
0143038419|3.0|So many people raved about this book and then the movie. I personality had a hard time getting though this story. If I wasn't is a group where this was the book for topic, I would have put it down. Yes there was some good points and understanding where the author was coming from. Over all I felt that she kept dragging the story out. Everyone said the movie is better but I do not want to see it. Read the book and that was enough for me!
B000ATQYT2|5.0|My mother and I watched this movie since i was a child and it never gets old. The message of this movie is so awsome and not overly dramatic. I love the muppets too!  If you want your child to understand the real meaning of christmas watch this movie with them. It is beautiful. I cry every time I listen to Tiny Tim sing \\"Bless us all\\"  Love this movie!!
0385341679|5.0|The last book in the series, but not the least! I couldn't wait to read it after the cliffhanger of the fourth, and I wasn't deceived!  All the answers to all the questions are here, in this last book, and I wished all along I could finish it quickly to know, and dreading at the same time finishing it, because it would mean I'd have to leave Mac and her world.    \\"MacKayla Lane was just a child when she and her sister, Alina, were given up for adoption and banished from Ireland forever.  Twenty years later, Alina is dead and Mac has returned to the country that expelled them to hunt her sister's murderer. But after discovering that she descends from a bloodline both gifted and cursed, Mac is plunged into a secret history: an ancient conflict between humans and immortals who have lived concealed among us for thousands of years.  What follows is a shocking chain of events with devastating consequences, and now, Mac struggles to cope with the grief while continuing her mission to acquire and control the Sinsar Dubh--a book of dark, forbidden magic scribed by the mythical Unseelie King, containing the power to create and destroy worlds.  In an epic battle between humans and Fae, the hunter becomes the hunted when the Sinsar Dubh turns on Mac and begins mowing a deadly path through those she loves.  Who can she turn to? Who can she trust? Who is the woman haunting her dreams? More important, who is Mac and what is the destiny she glimpses in the black and crimson designs of an ancient tarot card?\\"    Just by reading this, we know there will be blood, pain, action, etc.  The real question all along the book is: who is the Unseelie King? Barrons? Mac? Someone else? In the king chamber, there is a mirror only the king and the concubine can cross without dying on the spot. So, how can Mac cross it without damage?     This book is really dark, frightening and oppressing. Mac's world became so messed up you just don't know what will happen to her. And because she doesn't knoweither, she will have to seduce the Lord Master, the one she thinks is her sister's murderer in order to achieve her goal.    And that's the other answer we have in this book: the identity of the murderer. Of course, I won't spoil you, but I can say you'll be surprised. And if only it was the only revelation of the book! My brain was trying to process all the news while I was reading and, believe me, it was a lot of new things to think about.    The book finishes on an \\"The end. . . for now\\" but I don't know what Moning will want to do with Mac now. If there's a sequel, I'm afraid it will be bad for this series, sometimes, some stories don't need to be continued.     A little word about the book in itself: the cover is really beautiful, it's like having the Sinsar Dubh in our hands. But the dust jacket in plastic isn't really practical and I had to put it off to read the book--and then to not put it off once finished because it was too rigid to be manipulated.    If you like revelations, sex, revelations again, blood, a charismatic heroine, and revelations, do anything you can to read it!    All my reviews are available on the French website Mythologica!
B002JVWRAO|5.0|never mind what i said before but this is a great product and i'm just mad that i bought it when it was 19.99 now its 17.99 crazy the video that they put on here is around season 3 and is a spoiler for people who are going to buy season 3. But like i said best produce probably going to buy another one as a gift .
B0013FSL0C|3.0|I can't say exactly when I stopped watching this series, though I know why, and my girlfriend is mildly cross that I don't share her enthusiasm.  Despite its artistic integrity and psychological complexity, I just couldn't stand the characters anymore.  This show outshines the quality of any six prime-time network dramas, yet as it stretched over forty-eight episodes, I reached the point where these characters resembled fingernails on the chalkboard.<br /><br />Nearly every half-hour episode occurs in Dr. Paul Weston's office, or that of his mentor Gina.  This confinement, and the remarkably small cast, force viewers into a claustrophobic relationship with an ensemble linked by the magnitude of their dysfunctions.  We have to adjust our rhythms to those of the series, which is no small task.  But this means that, despite its low-key demeanor, this show leaves us feeling remarkably purged.<br /><br />But as the characters rabbit on, apparently reveling in misery and disturbance, they started to grate on me.  I've undergone therapy, so I know the difficulty we face when we realize our need to change our most destructive habits, but these characters seemingly want to stay broken.  Indeed, watching Paul lead Laura on, while Gina yanks Paul's leash, they seemingly want to spread their brokenness around to everyone else equally.<br /><br />Which leaves me in the awkward position of recognizing the artistic accomplishment played out on my TV screen, while simultaneously wanting to rid myself of these characters and their misguided indiscretions.  These characters need a good stern talking-to, but they take turns pushing each other's buttons or tiptoeing around the real issues.  So as much as I appreciate the creative team's accomplishment, I just had to quit watching.
B00479SVBU|5.0|First, I my order arrived a few days earlier than I expected so that got things off to a great start. Since I upgraded my phone to the iPhone 4, I've had problems finding a good, compact FM transmitter. This one by Soundfly is GREAT! Simple setup and nice options. The FM transmitter quality is better than some of the more mainstream transmitters being sold over the counter at Walmart, Target, and Best Buy. Sound quality is clean and crisp. Highly recommend this product.
0312370849|4.0|Wonderful historical fiction book. I loved how the book went back and forth from the perspective of the past and the present.  The perspective adds to the mystery that unfolds the more you read. I Didn't want to put it down and sad when it was over.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I'm not going to go into a lengthy review here. I just have to say that the proof is in the pudding. I stayed up, through the night, until dawn to watch the entire series. It was that engrossing. It's superbly cast and acted. It was the first time I had seen Richard Armitage in anything. He was fantastic as John Thornton. Since my initial viewing of North and South, I must have watched it in it's entirety about 15 times. It will be a lifetime favorite.
B004DMNT2W|3.0|Nice camera bag if it \\"fits\\" your needs.   -Pros:  Good construction quality, small size can be a plus on portability if it fits your needs.   -Cons:  Small size makes uses limited (works best to hold my Flip vidcam), limited room for accessories.    Overall 3 stars from me.  5 stars for quality minus 2 stars for size (I prefer slightly bigger camera bags for increased flexibility).
B003EYVXXW|5.0|Watched this last night. It is an amazing film about Hypatia, a 4th century female mathematician, philosopher and astronomer who lived during a time in history when fundamentalism was threatening religious freedom and scientific advancement.
1591843790|5.0|Like Guy's other books, \\"Enchantment\\" is easy to read. He doesn't use a lot of technical terms; rather he explains things in everyday language that anyone can understand. Guy is a technologist, and this still shows in this book, even though the subject matter borders on self-help rather than being a business book. Many business books are motivational in nature, but few are inspirational. Motivation doesn't last, which is why you need to keep attending seminars and reading motivational books. Inspiration does last, and I found \\"Enchantment\\" to be an inspirational book. Highly recommended for business people and anyone who really wants to help others.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|I was very hesitant when this movie came out, being a fan of the original Batman that stared Micheal Keaton and Jack Nicholson.  I decided not to watch it at the theater and waited for DVD.  I watched it for the first time just after xmas, I had bought it for my father, unseen.  A large group of us saw it at once and the reactions were mixed (from \\"that was aweful\\" to \\"astounding\\").  I thought Heath Ledger's performance was absolutely remarkable.  The Joker has never been more sinister and more twisted and without all the goofiness that he normally comes with.  Even if it wasn't a Batman movie it would be a stand alone masterpiece.  The story was so wonderfully woven together, the twists and turns played out beautifully.  It never felt bloated or over the top.  It felt real and gritty.  After seeing it on DVD I had to own it on Blu-Ray and it is easily one of my favorite movies.
0061997811|5.0|This is probably the most \\"fun\\" book I have ever read. This is also a must have for any film fan, not just Harry Potter fans. The book goes into quite a lot of detail in how the films special effects were accomplished. Then of course there are various prop reproductions included (all paper). IE The Maurader's Map. What I find a bit funny is where in the first Harry Potter film, Hermoine is walking with the kids into the great hall for the first time and mentioning the ceiling she says something like \\"It's not real you know...I read about it in Hogwarts, a History.\\" This book shows in detail where the real live set of the great hall ends and the computer effects begins.
0307278255|4.0|Jhumpa Lahiri's writing always enables me to have a clear mental picture of the characters and their surroundings. The stories in the first half of the book weren't as engaging as some of her other short stories. Most of the stories had been previously published in the new yorker it would have been nice to see newer material in this book instead of her pulling old from past work. I did like how in the second half of the book (Hema and Kaushik) she wrote from both characters points of view and for the final story brought every thing together in the third person. This book is not her best work but I did still find it enjoyable.
1423113381|4.0|As fans of Rick Riordan's Percy Jackson series, my children and I were excited about his newest series, The Kane Chronicles. Where Percy Jackson and the Olympians and The Lost Heroes focus on Greek and Roman mythology, The Red Pyramid (The Kane Chronicles, Book 1) addresses many aspects of Egyptian mythology.    I, myself, am not as knowledgable about Egyptian gods and myths, so it was nice to look more into this aspect of culture, belief, and history. I also loved that the main characters are bi-racial. Just as good books with strong female leads are often hard to find, strong characters of other minority groups are even more difficult to find. Riordan's small glimpse in the previously separate lives of Carter and Sadie, who exhibit different physical traits, reveals prejudice still felt by many, providing strong bi-racial characters, along with a confident female lead.    While we enjoyed this book and learned more about Egyptian mythology in the process, I'll admit that I didn't like it as well as The Lost Heroes series or even the first Percy Jackson series. The book alternates between characters, a style which Riordan often utilizes. However, this book is written as though Carter and Sadie are telling the story and recording it. The conversational retelling was less enjoyable to me. I noticed that my 8 year old, normally my child to laugh out loud as I read to teh kids, didn't find the book nearly as humorous as The Lost Heroes. That being said, I'm certain my children will reread the book and they are looking forward to the second book in the series.
0061689246|4.0|Stardust sort of reminds me of a combination of The Odyssey and Alice in Wonderland. Neil Gaiman has a gift for story telling and writing stories that are well thought out and have a satisfying ending.
1402573723|2.0|I'm a teacher and wanted the students to hear the African names being pronounced correctly, so I went searching for a book on tape/CD. I had no idea the reader on the CD would be talking so very slow. A 5 page chapter (keeping in mind, the font in the book is probably a size 14) would take 30 minutes to listen to. I only played about half of a chapter for my students before I picked up the reading. It was \\"okay\\" in the fact where I could listen to the pronunciation of the names the night before, so that I could read it to my students. Next time I get a book on tape, I will sample it first. Now I have no use for a 6 disc book on CD. Maybe I'll try to sell it and get my money back.
0307474275|2.0|I respect that fact the Dan Brown must have done research in order to write this book. He just doesn't seem to have that much of an imaginative vocabulary. I got tired of seeing the use of the same words and phases over and over. The book just doesn't live up to the hype, I don't understand the fuss over it.
1608201236|5.0|While I was anxious to get to this the final book in the Adrien English series, it was bittersweet.  I have enjoyed these books so much that I never wanted them to end!  If you want clever wit, deep and interesting characters, a fascinating storyline, and men to really care about, these books are for you!  Since others on here have already given away what happens between Jake and Adrien, I'm going to comment now as well.  The scene in which Adrien and Jake come to terms near the end of the book, was one of the most lovely and touching moments I've ever encountered in any novel!  It grabbed me so hard that I re-read it three times and was completely teary-eyed!  There, I admitted it!  The sad part was that I couldn't grab and hug my partner while reading it because we are in the process of moving to California and are currently having to live in separate states. Thankfully that will change soon.  Again, I can't recommend these books enough.  Bravo Josh Lanyon, and long live Adrien and Jake!
0316776963|2.0|While the essays are intelligently written the book lacks the funniness that the reviews make it out to have. The only essay that made me laugh out loud was Big Boy, I guess bathroom humor is funny no matter how old you are. I had such high hopes for this book but was disappointed.
B003MG5CO8|5.0|Two of the top Bollywood actors in a movie that has everything: comedy, tragedy, music, and a message. Best part of these new Bollywood movies is that the production is sophisticated but you can still watch it with your kids and parents. Very sweet movie!
0061537969|5.0|i loved this book, and i would recommend it to anyone.  i love dogs but i don't particularly care for racing... but that doesn't matter. the book makes you fall in love with the characters and the car racing is a metaphor for life.  so even if you don't like racing, you can get into it.    it's hard to put it down when you start to read it. and im reading it again after i just finished it. thats how good it is.
B004I3U7US|5.0|This album was a brave production in that it shunned formula and disregarded potential for broad commercial appeal. My first listen was a bit uncomfortable, but it affected me so much that I played the CD again immediately. That's all it took to recognize Anna Calvi is a powerful singer with professional people around her who succeeded in giving her a recording that makes her a force to be reckoned with. I took a risk ordering this album. I am very happy with my purchase.  Much like many years ago when I first heard Bruce Springsteen's Born To Run I thought \\"what the heck is this?\\".  Of course after a second or third listen I became a believer. I'm a believer in Anna Calvi.
B0042L78MG|5.0|I took a risk on this album after I heard a snippet of \\"That Man\\" on the radio and loved the sound. I didn't regret it at all. It's a hugely enjoyable album with a 30s and 40s swing sound (and hints of the Andrews Sisters) combined with 2010 production. Caro Emerald is a really good singer and she gives very good material a real sparkle. There is an excellent brass section, a fine keyboard player and terrific rhythm sound from percussion, guitar and double bass, with the addition of a bit of synth and scratching. I'm not a fan of scratching at all, but it isn't obtrusive and works really well here. The overall effect is irresistible from smoky ballads to swing numbers you just can't sit still to.<br /><br />This was a real departure for me, but I'm delighted that I've discovered it. If in doubt, my advice is to buy it - it's a classy, joyous treat.
B0043EV774|5.0|Colours and Graphics are spectacular in this flick and is the ultimate 3d movie to have in your collection.   Strong Recommendation to 3d movie lovers.
B004CHURRS|5.0|This is a lovely disc from Natalie Dessay. She is a marvellous singer with a truly beautiful voice and I think she uses it to excellent effect here. The disc is devoted to arias and duets by Cleopatra from Giulio Cesare, introduced by the overture and with two vigorous Sinfonias interspersed. It also includes some arias which Handel wrote and then discarded in favour of others for a different dramatic effect, but which are very well worth hearing.    Dessay sings with real emotion and feeling in every piece. She meets the huge technical challenges of Handel's music and the extraordinary ornamentation with an apparently effortless virtuosity and I found her range of powerful passion, tragic lament and sweet meditation all very convincing. Coupled with the very fine playing of Le Concert d'Astrée under Emannuelle Haim and excellent recorded sound the effect is consistently engaging and really magical in places.    I suspect your response to this programming will depend on your attitude to opera on disc. I understand and respect the view of many that operas should be heard in their entirety but personally, although I love to see full productions of operas, I often find them quite hard going on disc and very much enjoy programmes of selections like this. If you share my view, I am sure you will enjoy this disc as much as I do. Very warmly recommended.
1439107955|5.0|This book was transformative and essential to my understanding of cancer.  Having lost so many family members and just recently my mother to this horrible disease, the author explains the history (in it's entirety) of cancer so descriptively, that laypersons can understand and medical personnel will remain fully engaged.  Bravo, Dr. Mukherjee, for not only writing an informative book, but mostly for maintaining your level of compassion, as it shows in every word you wrote.
B0043RSE2M|5.0|This is a childrens movie for the most part. There were a few scenes that made me laugh, but all in all it was made for the little ones (as most animations are). I bought this for my 8 year old son and he watches it over and over again. Any child aged from 4-12 would watch this movie at least 15 times. GREAT movie!<br />As for the 3D feature.... I was blown away by the quality of the 3D. It really impressed me and if you have the equipment to view a 3D bluray at home, i would highly suggest getting this movie. It has the WOW FACTOR. 5outof5<br /><br />****to view a 3D bluray you must have a 3D HDTV, 3D bluray player, and the stereoscopic 3D glasses to match your display****
1591843790|5.0|The big question the book addresses is \\"why enchant customers?\\". The answer, obvious to the social media generation maybe is because they advocate your products and your brand, buy more and persuade others to buy more.     The book has been described by several reviewers as the \\"How to Win Friends and Influence People\\" for the 21st century, and even before I read the other reviews (or even the back of the beautiful book cover) I was coming to the same conclusion. There is a lot written about how you, as an individual can affect people's perceptions of you personally, and therefore the brand you represent.    I found the book easy to read and packed with great information for anybody working in a company of any size.    I wrote a fuller review and had a Q&A with Kawasaki on my blog at [...]
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|We already own the movie on VHS and Full Screen DVD, but it was soooo worth getting this set. The restored picture and sound makes it a whole new experience. The movie is better than ever, and even this day so current... (if you can read through the lines,EVEN TODAY THE EVIL FORCES ARE AT WORK TO DESTROY THE GOOD).  The whole family enjoyed it. The kids love the music box that came with it... The books and extra materials are amazing too.    I'm not going to write in detail about what's in the book and on the discs as it has been extensively reviewed here, but I still wanted to put in a little review as appreciation.    JUST AS CAPTAIN VON TRAPP SAID: \\"BLESS OUR HOMELAND FOREVER!\\" (edelweiss)    G-D BLESS THE USA!!!
006107327X|5.0|This book is great and if you like the animated series, just buy it; its got tons of cool drawings and sketches and stories about the series. The only problem is the book came out like 10 years ago and the glue on the spine is weak and my copy fell outta the spine. Hopefully that doesnt happen to all the books. Whatever, buy it, its awesome.
B000W93CXQ|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read. It is so deep and moving. It makes you step back and take a look at your life. Even though I cried really hard and walked around depressed after, everyone should read this book because of how awe-inspiring it is.
B003Y74KAW|4.0|I think as far as skin type cases go this is a good one.  It's not cheap and flimsy like some are.  I still have a problem with skins though and this type of phone, especially with kids and pockets. The skins (and pretty much ALL do this) tend to move and get caught and their flexibility tends to be a kid magnet and I have had several tear from kids fidgeting with them (although not this one).  If you like skins, then buy without concern, but I prefer a harder case.
B003HARV98|5.0|I've got Shakira's Oral Fixations (1&2),Lady Gaga (The Fame), and the first Katy Perry cd on my iphone as my favorites-and I have to admit that Marina outsings them all in her own way. My favorites have to be \\"Numb\\",Obsessions\\",\\"I am not a Robot\\"...just about all the songs on the cd really.How to describe it? I have no idea-it's very different from anything I've ever liked. It's sassy,addictive,funny at times,almost soulful...the words just aren't coming. Though she isn't at the top of the charts,I really appreciate the authenticity of this cd-This is Marina as herself, not an overly adorned recycled diva , and there are no songs on here that would be on the charts (you know, the repetitively annoying, but catchy simple songs?)-but they should be.If you want quality music that doesn't stay the same in each number, then get this cd. The beats all differ, but they WORK-they do not take away , or distract, they come together to make this cd so awesome to listen to. I bought it on itunes, and have never regretted it.It's perfect-there's not a song on there that I have not been obsessed with. What I really want to convey though is that each song is like a seperate story-each differing from serious,funny,or just wonderfully entertaining. And her voice, awww man!I can't compare it to any other artist's-when I hear it,I know it's Marina, and I don't have to think. It's deep,not too low, not too high just porridgey(Goldilock's anyone?) :). If you're hesitant to buy, check out all of her songs on Youtube like I did, and you will be more than willing to pay so you can carry her unique cd anywhere.But please do check out \\"Numb\\"-I can listen to it endlessly; I am absolutely entranced by it...Enjoy!
B0030A0ZD4|5.0|I bought this from Amazon uk and let me say that first of all, they make it so easy to buy from them.  When you sign in, you use your existing amazon account and they even convert the price for you so you know exactly how much you are paying.  My total happened to be $19.30 in U.S. dollars which included all shipping cost.  So figure about $20 bucks for this movie.  Which is a really great deal!  I recommend that anyone who is a fan of this movie or Michael Jackson in general pick this up.  I have never bought an imported movie before, especially since most imported movies will not play on U.S. players, but I guess with Bluray movies that is not the case, and definitely not the case for this particular Blu ray.  My ONLY two complaints, and these are completely cosmetic, is that apparently in the U.K. they like to put their ratings on the outside of the case right on the cover art and on the side of the case as well. Slightly annoying as this is not something we are used to stateside and it makes it standout a little bit as being \\"different\\".  I don't mind that the rating is large and in your face on the back cover, but is it really necessary to put it on the front AND the spine?  And it is not just one rating, but two seperate ratings which are the exact same (two PG symbols in two different shapes).  But like I said, its cosmetic so I will have to let the OCD collector in me just accept it.  The other complaint is that the case they use is not the standard thin bluray cases that we are used to.  It is a thicker case that is about the thickness of a DVD case, although it is the same height as a standard blu-ray case.  If you have owned any of the 3-4 disc Disney Bluray combo pack movies like pinocchio or UP, then you know what I am talking about.  The problem is that this release is one disc and therefore the slightly larger packaging is seemingly unnecessary.  Those two minor complaints aside, this is still worth getting, unless your more OCD than me!<br /><br />On to the film.  Picture quality looks great!  It keeps the natural film grain while producing a very good high definition picture.  I have watched this movie on VHS many times, owned a few bootleg DVD's, and i am telling you this Blu-ray is the absolute BEST I have ever seen this film!  I am not going to review the actual movie itself.  If your a Michael Jackson fan you have probably seen it anyways, if you haven't seen it then you should check it out for yourself.  It is more of a compilation that an actual movie.  The actual \\"movie\\" is a movie within a movie which is really the extra long version of smooth criminal.  It has a plot, although I am often confused as to what that plot is exactly, but it involves Michael being a superhero of some sort who is protecting his children friends from a drug cartel who is led by Joe Pesci.  The entire movie surrounds around the bad album and has 5 music videos (or short films), Man in the Mirror, Speed Demon, Leave me Alone, Smooth Criminal, and Come Together.  The film also features a retrospective of the history of Michael Jackson (Jackson 5 until the Bad album), and a mock-music video called \\"badder\\", where children are performing the Bad music video.  The film is approx. 93 minutes.  The entire movie looks really good in High Def.  The clay-animation sequences look really nice too.  Some of the highlights were when Michael is having the dance off with the animated rabbit \\"spike\\".  The detail is really good there.  The live music video for \\"man in the mirror\\", which opens the film looks really great too. Audio quality was pretty impressive too.  All the music sounds master quality.  I don't have a surround sound or anything and I just use my standard tv speakers like most people do, but the music sounds great in the film.  Picture I would give 4 out of 5 stars and Audio I would give the same.<br /><br />Overall a great blu-ray release.  One common complaint is the \\"censorship\\" in this film.  there is a particular scene where Joe Pesci's character is holding a needle and threatening to inject a little girl with it.  He says something to the effect of \\"I just want to get everybody high, man!\\".  Sure it is a shame when ANY film is censored as it can take away from the original integrity of the film.  However, since my 3-year old son is the new Michael Jackson fan in the family, I honestly don't mind the edit.  I think it is unnecessary and violent, and I have always thought that.  I was actually always surprised they went that far in a Michael Jackson movie to begin with.  I \\"don't mind\\" the edit.  That does not mean I support it.  The purist in me doesn't like it, and honestly I would have rather had the option to view the original version and the newer more \\"kid friendly\\" version for my son, but we are talking about a matter of seconds.  If you didn't know it was there, you wouldn't miss it.  And the parent in me thinks the movie is better without it to be honest.  It does not take away from the overall integrity of the film to take that part out.  If you have this movie on VHS or any of the bootleg DVD versions, it is definitely worth the upgrade.  I honestly never thought the film could ever look this good.  Additionally, it is nice to have several of Michael Jackson's best music videos in high definition.  It would be nice to see a Music Video collection released on Blu-Ray in the future, considering how good the videos on here look.  Until then, at least I have moonwalker to enjoy.  If you don't own this movie in any incarnation, GET IT!  If you own it on VHS or DVD, but have a blu-ray player and an HD television, then GET IT!  Either way, GET IT!aracter is holding a needle and threatening to inject a little girl with it.  He says something to the effect of \\"I just want to get everybody high, man!\\".

B003UESJF6|5.0|This is the best (cartoon) movie that has come out in a long time!! It was entertaining because of the music (Ozzy, Guns N Roses, etc), the comedy, the visuals...it was just a fantastic movie. And, of course, it has a good story line...that evil never wins. This is one movie that we haven't minded watching over and over again because we're finding there's always some little joke or viual aspect we missed. The biggest plus is having a movie we can all watch together, from my 8 year old to my 50+ year old father without having to worry about inappropriate jokes or scenes but it's done well enough that we all enjoy it!

B004HV54TU|3.0|I spend my entire time working at a computer and I decided to purchase an ergonomic mouse to ease the soreness in my wrist and forearm. After spending hours researching which mouse I should get and testing out a co-worker's Evoluent mouse (older model), I settled for this one. I'm a smaller person (5'2\\" 120LBS) so I figured this mouse would be perfect for me. I even printed out the hand measurement chart. After a few days, I decided this size was not for me. I did not like how my fingertips extended beyond the buttons so sent it back and exchanged it for a Regular Sized mouse. After a few days, I was still noticing pain in my lower forearm from moving my hand left to right.     I do like how all 6 buttons are programmable for daily functions like copy and paste, page back, etc. The only thing I really programmed was adjust the third button to the second button for right-clicking. (There are three main buttons as opposed to just two).     I am returning this mouse (the Evoluent VerticalMouse 4 regular size) and looking to purchase a thumb trackball mouse instead. I have tested an older version of the vertical mouse and I personally like it better because it is a bit more \\"Vertical\\".     I also feel strongly that if I am going to invest almost $100 on a mouse, it should be as close to perfect as possible.   I have no doubt that this mouse would be perfect for some people, but it just isn't for me.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|I bought this movie without reading anything about it at all and was so pleasantly surprised by the nuances expressed in these characters. Lush with emotion and the making of decisions that will make (or break) lasting relationships, this film tackles big topics while keeping the pace relaxed and unforced.     I love the character of Zach - he's struggling with so many feeling and on the cusp of making huge life choices that weren't all his to make. I love his devotion to his nephew and his family and that he truly knows what sacrifice means and does so without much complaint.     I also love the character of Shaun, whose open heart and patience make a 'Shelter' for Zach. Not everything is cut and dry and I love the way this character is wise enough to wait for Zach to decide how to deal with his newly realized feelings.    Love does just 'happen' and this movie sums that up with grace and beauty - a really poignant piece of art that says volumes of what relationships today are truly made of and how family and lovers all overlap in our lives.
B000002NG7|4.0|Currently Faith No More's last studio release the wonderfully titled Album Of The Year was a fitting swansong. Its packed full of quality tracks and showed a band that despite the cracks that had developed over the years between the members could still deliver a quality album.     By calling your album 'Album of the Year' you could be setting yourself up for a critical battering so it says a lot that it was generally well received if a little underrated as the years have gone on. It starts with the brilliant Collision which continues the trend of Faith No More as starting their albums with a cracking quality tune and sets up the album. Other standouts are Stripsearch, Last cup of Sorrow, Helpless and the brilliant Ashes to ashes. It also feature a song called Naked in front of the Computer which probably applies a lot more now than it did then! But that's Faith No More always that bit ahead.     It also feature John Hudson on guitar for the first time and while he will never replace Jim Martin hes well able to hold his own. Also returning is keyboardist Roddy Bottum who missed most of the last release (king for a day fool for a lifetime) with some well documented problems.     So while nothing will ever top Angel Dust, Album Of The Year was a good way to go out.
0439023513|1.0|I really didn't like this book, which was so disappointing since I loved the Hunger Games, and thought Catching Fire was good as well. My friend loaned me all 3, and as I finished the 2nd book I thought I would get the set and read them again sometime. I was so disappointed by the 3rd book, I'm not going to buy any of them now.     *****This review contains SPOILERS*****    First and foremost, let me say that I am neither a war-monger nor a pacifist. I do believe that sometimes good people should stand up to bad ones for the benefit of all, and if that takes a war...so be it. Sometimes it's the greater good that matters. That said, I felt this book was absolutely anti-war propaganda. The message I kept getting was that in war NOBODY WINS. Tell that to all the District people, slaves of the Capitol that were freed by the war. Didn't they WIN?    I found Katniss' character to completely change. She became a self-centered whiner, bent on revenge. It was all about her. When she decided to take on the roll of the Mockinjay, I thought she might be seeing the bigger picture, and become the heroine she could have been. She was, up until the 3rd book, the provider for her family, the voice of the down-trodden, rescuer of the weak, unknowing face of a revolution...then she fell apart, and so did the story. Her character never grew in the third book...never learned forgiveness, never learns that revenge is futile and empty, never opened up to anyone...she starts to and then she goes into hiding somewhere. Never to stand up on her own for the greater good.    I didn't really care which person she ended up with as both Peeta, and Gale were young men of substance, and she certainly loved them both. Gale always standing up for what was right, and providing for his family...now becomes a war-monger. Which I had a hard time believing. Peeta becomes a weak brainwashed crazy man bent on killing Katniss...that is fine by the end of the book. I would have been OK with her ending up withPeeta, if Gale had been portrayed as a man of no substance, but he wasn't up until the middle of the 3rd book. It seems Katniss only ended up with Peeta because he was there, not because she realized she truly loved him all along.     Ms. Collins brings in story lines that go nowhere, and kills of so many people you learn to love it's just sad. The woman and young girl that made it to District 12 that Katniss feeds and teaches a few survival tricks to never make it to District 13? What was the point then? Bringing Delly Cartwright into the mix, I actually thought she might be instrumental in helping Peeta come back from his insanity, but again nothing. Were the deaths of Boggs, Finnick, Madge, and Prim all really necessary? Apparently, if you are pushing the issue that war is pointless. The fact that Katniss never reconciles with Gale really bothers me. Her mother can't face District 12, so she goes on to District 4 to build a hospital, and once again leaves Katniss stranded and alone? Could her mother really be that self-centered that she can't reach out to her remaining daughter that's been through hell and back again? And what about Haymitch...he goes back to being a drunk? After everything? I actually thought he might end up with Gale's mom, since she took on the role of his housekeeper.    How is it Katniss is so squeamish at the sight of sick and wounded? She's a hunter! She kills, skins, and guts animals. Really?    I would have stopped reading when Boggs and Finnick were killed, but I hoped Katniss was having some crazy hallucination from the morphling, and that maybe it would right itself.     The fact that she killed Coin...finally realizing that Coin was no better than Snow. She was right, but never had the opportunity to stand up for herself at her own trial? Not to find that others agreed with her? She's basically let off on an insanity plea. Really? And could she really after everything...believe she was still the person responsible for the deaths ofeveryone she loved? Couldn't she see that Snow was just an evil, crazed, blood thirsty lunatic?    Katniss never really seems to learn anything, never finds true contentment, or completely heals. A complete disappointment.
B003N7GATM|4.0|Once people get past the fact that Trent Reznor has released an album with his wife Mariqueen Maandig Reznor and that they might have to wait a bit longer for the next Nine Inch Nails record and that after spending pretty much the last 4 years touring and releasing records at a record rate, they might actually like this. I know some people who would prefer Trent to have no life and think he's embarrassing himself with this record, i would have to totally disagree. A lot of people have slated this partnership(of cours e they do it from the comfort of hiding behind a computer screen) now if it was rubbish fair enough but this ep is far from that.     How To Destroy Angels(named after a single by the band Coil) are made up of Trent Reznor(nine inch nails), Mariqueen Maandig Reznor(ex West Indian Girl) and Atticus Ross(producer for nine inch nails, korn, saul williams) and with this first self titled release they have given us 6 songs full of beats, fuzzy guitars and vocals provided by Mrs Reznor, Trent himself can be heard singing in the background on Parasite and BBB(big black boots). The ep opens with The Space In Between which sounds like The Sneaker Pimps with its big beats, we then move on to the aforementioned Parasite which has a nin trademark distorted fuzzy guitar, and has Trent tucked in on background vocals, the combination works well. Third track Fur Lined has a beat that sounds like it was borrowed from the nin track Only(found on the with teeth album) then its onto BBB which is more of a spoken word duet by Mr & Mrs Reznor as we are told to listen to the sound of Mariqueen's Big Black Boot's, Fifth track The Believers has Mariqueen doing a whisper style vocal over some big beats and distorted guitars, which leaves us with the final track A Drowning, this track is over 7 minutes long and is probably too long and doesn't really go anywhere even if it does contain a hint of the sound Reznor used so well on his masterpiece album The Fragile.     This is probably only the beginning for HTDA and they are probably only testing the water, but after hearing this ep it wets the appetite for a full length studio album.
006091307X|4.0|I hated this book at the halfway point.  Really.  Wanted to launch it across the room.  But a bit later things get oddly and uniquely interesting, and I got caught up.  There are a few points (in particular Oedipa's journey thru san francisco) where it really is as if you are reading a different book from the one you started.  This isn't necessarily a good thing, but here is it somehow works (mostly).      The book is in some ways an unwieldy mess, and I think you have to not get too hung up on every detail, allusion, pun and riddle.  Does help to keep a dictionary and search engine handy, though.  It's a novel that sort of teaches you along the way how to read it and what to pay attention to.  This means you are likely to be confused for a while, possibly annoyed, but almost certainly surprised and possibly enlightened by the end.
0062064304|5.0|The quality of this book is out of my expectation. The design looks very interesting. The book is not like usual book putting many film picture there. This time, there are a lot of concept art were collected into this book. We know the film has limited budget at the very beginning. For me, their design work does not looks like a low budget film Because they designed a lot. In this book , you can see the symbols when they design different robot. Tons of advanced gun design. I really want to have more books like this.

0670022411|3.0|*Stepping onto my soapbox* I read lots of books on witches, vampires, demons, and more.  There is really nothing new left to be invented, and I don't really care; I like these books for what they are - highly entertaining, escapist fiction.  Others go on and on about the cliches, but let's get serious - if you're reading a book on this subject matter what do you expect??  Same with comparing it to other books in the genre - of course you can find similarities and similar stories - it is a popular fiction genre after all - not serious literature. *Stepping off of my soapbox*    There was one thing I really liked about this book and was different and one thing I really disliked.  I loved how science and fantasy were woven together - the juxtaposition of modern science and supernatural fantasy was a new twist and very well done.  Casting an ancient vampire as a modern scientist was the icing on the cake!      Then, unfortunately, there was the ending - or to be more precise, the lack thereof.  I was shocked, at first I thought that my electronic download was corrupted. The books ends right at one of the climaxes and not a single bloody thing is answered by the end of the story!!  Can Matthew and Diana have children and what exactly will they be?  What is in the ancient text everyone wants to get their hands on?  Will Diana discover how to use her magic and how will it be used; what will be their adventures in the past?  Will the new resistance movement prevail and at what cost?  Will humans discover other creatures as is feared?  How will the uniting of the three species turn out in the end?  All this book does is creates more and more loose ends right up to the very end! Arrrggghhhh - all I can assume is that this is all set up so that there can be a sequel.  Even sequeled books wrap up at least some of the loose ends before starting the next chapter, so to speak, in the next book. I'd be cool with that but I wish the book said, \\"to be continued...\\"  If there is no sequel intended then this has to be the most torturous book an author could lay on an unsuspecting reader. For this reason (and no indication if there will be a sequel) I gave it three stars.

B00127RAJY|3.0|I was quite disappointed with this DVD [[ASIN:B00127RAJY Jillian Michaels - 30 Day Shred]]  Since the DVD  is intended to people that need to loose weight and who are starting up training I expected more than a standard non informative series of exercises. However, this DVD is just a series of exercises, grouped into 3 levels. I had expected a lot more guidance on how much weight to use for each exercise, when to move from one level to the next, when to push through with the advanced exercises when having done the beginners so far, how to adjust diet accordingly and -and this I was amazed to find- how often to do the exercises. However, there is no guidance on this DVD at all, nothing, its just a compilation of exercises.  I must admit that I haven´t seen the TV show and know nothing of Jilian, however, that is not listed as a requirement, and I think that the DVD should be able to guide anyone towards his or hers ultimate goal.  On the positive side, the exercises are good and fairly well explained. There are beginners versions for the exercises that can be used for the exercises within a level that are too rough to start out with. I cannot help though, to feel disappointed and a little bit cheated, as the DVD is promoted as a great tool for people who are starting up exercising. When wanting to know more, one is simply directed to other videos and sites where it is possible to purchase more videos on other subject.   At the price of this DVD I would think that all guideance to reach elvel 3 in a healthy way would be included :-(
B000LN7HUC|3.0|It's not the lightest, not the heaviest either. Works as well as any alcohol stove. Cute, but, problem is that the windscreen is taller than the pot so when storing items, the pan/lid bottom gets scratched by the winscreen and it does not \\"nest\\" well. Disappointing.

B000Q66JXA|5.0|Comment: If you are remotely a fan of this period or have seen this film on other media... give another look on Blu-ray. I love when actors stand in real (murky) water, climb real walls and fight in real locations. Forget about being a \\"fact junky\\" and relax kick back and be entertained by some \\"make it so\\" acting. Except for the fake blood, this is probably as good as it's going to get making it real.
B002WY65VU|5.0|Pro: funny (as promised)<br />good action<br />good story<br />good acting<br /><br />con:<br />action is rather limited until the end. its less of a zombie movie and more a character study and zombies just happen to be around<br /><br />recommended: definitely!
B002ZG9774|2.0|Comment: Cher still has a good voice... for a \\"puppet on a stick\\". There is nothing Burlesque about this film... except for the name of the club. Boy, I watched this with my 90 year old Mother... she asked at about the half way point if we had to watch any more. If you are expecting a movie about the tried and true Burlesque... look elsewhere. On the other hand if you are looking for a \\"Dancing with the Stars\\" movie, this might be your cup of tea.
B004G600A4|5.0|as a parent and a person i loved this movie. the characters were interesting, the humor was off the chart (even though i seldom laugh at jokes as im seeing them) and rapunzel was ADORABLE. my favorite character was (is) the horse. he is the funniest character of the movie in my opinion. But other than that it has DEPTH to it. something i always found lacking in the classics (not that i dont like those too).<br />so, pros:<br />like able characters<br />awesome humor<br />lively pacing<br />good story<br />good music<br /><br />cons:<br />my only pet peeve was that the king and queen recognized their daughter instantly despite that she was 18 years older than when they last saw her. and her hair color was different.... i shrugged this off pretty easy though.<br /><br />highly recommended
B00005CDNK|5.0|When ABBA came out, I was in College and a die-hard bluesman, folkie, and rock n' roller. Abba? Wouldn't touch 'em with a 10-foot pole. Just too commercial, too much \\"pop.\\" Slowly, over the years, I began to warm up to the \\"happy-sound\\" of Mamma Mia and other, highly danceable numbers. During the break-up phase, then, I was not one to particularly mourn their passing. Then came \\"The Visitors.\\" Suddenly, they were back on my radar, with a vengeance. This was no longer the stuff of simple pop. It was sophisticated and actually had -- gasp! -- depth and perspective in the lyrics, arrangements and orchestration. I bought the vinyl and played it endlessly. I rediscovered it recently and noticed that I lacked the CD, so had to get it. It's in my car and speaks just to me like it did back then. \\"The Visitors\\" is for ABBA what \\"Revolver\\" or \\"Sgt Pepper\\" is for the Beatles, or \\"Let it Bleed\\" or \\"Exile on Main Street\\" for the Stones.
0756404738|3.0|There will be spoilers...I suppose.    I get the feeling from this book that because his first book was excellent, Patrick was given a free reign and WMF suffered for it.    The first third of the book had me asking myself, \\"Is any of this necessary?\\"  Kvothe has more schooling, steals a ring from Ambrose that Ambrose stole from Denna, and suspects Devi of treachery. None of this is carried forward through the story in any meaningful way.  Devi and Kvothe make up and Ambrose gets to Kvothe through charges stemming from the arm breaking incident in the first book.    I thought that toward the end of the story the ring might turn into something as Devi holds it as collateral for a loan.  When Kvothe appears at her door she had believed him dead.  I was certain that she had sold the ring and that would lead to a cascade of events, but no.  She still had it.    This cycle of conflict to complete and total resolution continues throughout WMF and is the primary reason for the feeling that we have just been treading water.    As others have said Patrick is excellent with words, they just weren't put to the best use.      Some speculation:    Perhaps the ring theiving story is necessary.  Perhaps it is the final straw that gets Ambrose to really REALLY get Kvothe expelled and move the story forward.    Brendon is Dennas patron.  Cane, older man, likes to dance.  He's the real reason the story spends so much time in Maer.    While annoyingly long the journey to Fae is necessary for Kvothe to meet the Ch-fae.    The telling of Kvothe's life is supposed to be 3 days.  1 book for each day.  That get's us up to Kvothe's present.  I have to think Patrick is planning on another series, or atleast another book that takes us from the present to a resolution.
B002RKS81O|4.0|Believe it or not I had never read this book. It is the first book that I've read on my new Kindle.  Glad I bought the Kindle for the convenience and glad I finally read this classic story.
0375842209|4.0|I'm kicking myself for every time I was in a library or book store, saw \\"The Book Thief,\\" was interested by the title, read the back cover, and put it back on the shelf because I thought it was just another WW2/Holocaust book. It isn't. \\"The Book Thief\\" is truly a unique book, and very, very sad. It surprised me sometimes, though at others (and I found this really aggravating), the author spoiled his own story. Of course, this just have the effect of making me all nervous, waiting for the spoilers to happen, so I suppose there was at least a purpose.     Anyways, Liesel, the eponymous book thief, is a likable, very real-feeling character that I would have identified with as a child, and still do at 18 years old. Anyone who loves books and loves to read will identify with her, both her passion for books and reading (I know I've certainly considered stealing books, though I have yet to break the law there) as well as the way she reacts to some of the horrors around her. \\"The Book Thief\\" is not a happy read, but it's a rewarding, well-written story which, to me, is a far superior quality for a book to have.
B002L2GK0O|3.0|My review is more for the kindle edition as I have only read about 30% of the book so far and I find the information good and laid out nicely.Palmer writes it in good order.It is helping me a lot to understand different things about brewing beer.   I do not like this on the Kindle and wish I would have bought the paperback instead.When Palmer say's for more info go to such and such a place it would of been easier with a real book.I imagine that their might be a way to do it on the kindle and go back to where you left off but,I do not want to do all the investigating on how to do it with the kindle.I would rather spend that time reading the book.   If I find this book marked down somewhere I will snap it up.If not I might just buy the hard copy anyway.
0439023521|5.0|I've been recommending \\"The Hunger Games\\" to everyone I know. The trilogy is one the best series of books I have ever read, but it will NOT give you the warm and fuzzies. I read the entire trilogy in 3 days, and when I finished I went home, took a shower, and went to bad because I was absolutely drained. This book really gets under your skin and it will make you physically uncomfortable. It is disturbing and it challenges your initial thoughts and reactions, so you actually feel guilty for wanting bad things to happen to the characters you don't like. as far as I'm concerned, that's what a good book SHOULD do.  Suzanne Collins does truly awful things to her characters. There is violence, both against and initiated by children, oppression, and plenty of morally-ambiguous gray areas, but in making the characters suffer, Collins makes them grow and the books are superior for that reason. She have strong characters who are cruelly beaten down, but the reader gets to watch Katniss (the protagonist) and co. be awesome bad asses despite all the awfulness they go through.    I do have a few complaints, though. The first half is a bit slow and dull, but once you get through that the action picks up so quickly that you're just begging for the author to slow down and let you catch your breath for a minute. Unfortunately, when she does that 3/4 of the way through, it's to focus on a rather shallow-feeling romance. If you just get through that like I did, the story returns to the gripping, morally ambiguous, fast-paced action book and the romance even becomes more entertaining in \\"Mockingjay,\\" the third book. Second would be not enough world building--I was dying to know not just about the rest of Panem, the post-apocalyptic future country, but also the world outside of Panem. Finally, the writing style is first-person present. First person is my least favorite form of narrative format, but it's a style that works later on. Collin's choice is totally vindicated when you feel like you're right there with Katniss, even if it is a bit awkward when Katniss is, say, eating.    Others have complained about the book being too similar to \\"Battle Royale,\\" but having never read that, I cant comment on it. If you haven't read it, then I totally recommend this book no matter what. If you have, then you might be a bit disappointed, but I am so obsessed with this book I'll still recommend it to you. And to any Joss Whedon fans out there, I one million percent recommend this book to you.     Anyways, \\"The Hunger Games is quite possibly the best children's/young adult book ever (except maybe \\"The Golden Compass\\"), though I believe the only real reason it's billed as \\"young adult,\\" is because it has a 16-year-old protagonist. This is totally a book for adults, no matter what the author says, or what I just said a sentence ago.    [Oh, and I also recommended the \\"Mark Reads\\" blog posts on The Hunger Games, though the posts can be a bit repetitive at times as the audience is repeatedly struck speechless by the awesomeness and the horror that is \\"The Hunger Games.\\" [...]]
155111125X|5.0|One reading is sufficient for most novels, but not Jane Austen's. Her style, wit and engrossing storytelling grow more delicious with every re-reading. I know in general what's going to happen, but there are so many wonderful details and so much rich characterization to rediscover.<br /><br />I loved Sense and Sensibility more than ever this time around.<br /><br />As the introduction points out, Austen's novel was part of an ongoing obsession in the 1790s and Regency period with defining and assessing \\"sensibility.\\" Too little sensibility was repellant; too much, dangerous. Whereas a perfect balance of intelligence, good manners and deep feeling should result in true happiness!<br /><br />The two elegant Dashwood sisters illustrate the point. Nineteen-year-old Elinor is amazingly sensible. When she suffers reversals, she takes rational steps to heal her wounds. Whereas Marianne at seventeen is awash in romantic opinions and sensations, and rather wallows in her misfortunes. Both have to deal with lovers who cause them misery. The plot revolves around how the sisters cope.<br /><br />But Sense and Sensibility is much more than a lesson in proper behavior. It's a feast of social satire full of delectably flawed characters. Nobody but nobody delivers a barbed criticism or witticism more beautifully than Jane Austen. And the Dashwood sisters are captivating young ladies who totally engage our sympathies.<br /><br />Broadview editions are my favorites, with their scholarly introductions and appendices. I particularly enjoyed the detailed drawings of a curricle, post-chaise and town chariot. Now I can picture the vehicles that carry Austen's characters to dinners and balls and on journeys to town and country.<br /><br />Jane Austen began writing Sense and Sensibility when she was twenty-two and published it in 1811, when she was thirty-six. Why she chose to publish it before Pride and Prejudice is one of many interesting questions explored in the introduction.
0312983867|5.0|Up front, I'm a big fan of Ms. Evanovich, especially the Stephanie Plum series. However, this has got to be one of my favorite (second only to the 4th book [[ASIN:0312675097 Four to Score (Stephanie Plum)]].  There are scenes which are truly \\"laugh out loud\\" funny. Although, there are a few moments of been there done that (Grandma Mazur... she's always \\"a pip\\"). Evanovich brings in some new characters and situations - I was laughing so hard it brought tears to my eyes.<br /><br />Her writing is excellent and consistent in all her books. She has her moments stretching almost to the \\"contrived\\" area, but who cares?  This and all her books are great reads.

B0043RT8JU|4.0|I liked the book a lot, even though I didnt feel that it was as good as \\"looking for alaska\\". John Green creates awesome characters that one can relate to and some that are beyond our ordinary imaginations. I myself am not a big mystery fan, but the book was thoroughly enjoyable, tying in comedic aspects of a typical high school senior year as well as suspenseful moments generated by the unpredictable female protagonist, Margo Roth Spigelman. John Green always makes you think deeper and and in more complex levels than the average novel, which I appreciate, but it was also relevant, something that I could connect to.
0439023513|4.0|I downloaded this book all of about two seconds after finishing Catching Fire.  This trilogy was really enjoyable.  I was slightly disappointed in the ending of Mockingjay, but all in all, I would feel very comfortable recommending to most anyone.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|The sequel was every bit as appealing as the first book was.     I enjoyed the fact that the book continued as long as it did.  I didn't want it to end quickly, and if you enjoy Rothfuss's writing, you wouldn't either.      I vote that the third book be twice as long and half as quick.  I'm enjoying the ride much more than I'm anticipating the destination.

0596804822|4.0|The book is a goldmine of information, but it is a struggle for the newbie.  Going in I had plenty of C++ experience but no OpenGL experience, and I found the text obscure in places.  But applying effort to the study seems to get me through all the problems so far.      The one notable exception is a problem wherein whole sample code projects (downloaded from the author's website) compile fine under the latest Apple Xcode system, apparently because an older compiler is targeted in the project files.  But when the sample code is copied piecemeal into a new Xcode Project, using the latest and greatest settings, there are circular references that generate utterly obscure compiler or linker errors.  The solution is found on the web, which I present here in the form that I am using in my code...    In the file GLView.h, make the following changes:  (1) comment out the import of the header file that is specific to the rendering engine or interface declarations (it'll be obvious which one that is, for each sample project)  (2) just below the imports, add the line      struct IRenderingEngine;  and as many others as the particular sample code requires (again, it'll be clear)  (3) put the term \\"struct\\" in front of the declaration of the IRenderingEngine ivar and as many others as the sample requires    In the file GLView.mm  (1) add an import of same header file that you commented out in GLView.h    That should get you going.  Best of luck out there.
B00005JLR8|5.0|\\"In America\\" was directed by Jim Sheridan, and dedicated to his brother, whom I assumed passed away, as the boy mentioned in the movie did.  The directing, acting, cinematography, tone and script of the movie grabs your heart, tears it apart and yet many moments of hope and laughter come through.  It is a story of a determined Irish family, illegally immigrating to America via the Canadian border.  They want to start a new life, and move forward after the death of their five year old son from a brain tumor.  Most families cannot make it through the death of a child, but there are deep bonds and they want to make it through the grief.  You see Johnny's (Paddy Considine) love for his wife Sarah (Samantha Morton) during a hot New York summer.  He buys an air conditioner for the family - obviously used - and carts it through rude New York's streets, carries it up three flights of stairs to plug it in and the plug does not fit.  He buys a new plug and it shorts the old building's fuse.  Instead of sadness and anger, they take the rent money and go to the movie (E.T.) and then a outdoor carnival where Paddy shows his girls (the darling, smart, unbelievably great Bolger sisters) that he can win a E.T. Doll.<br /><br />All the performances are top-rate.  Paddy does an amazing job as the \\"Da\\" - who misses his son, but tries to \\"act\\" like a good father to his darling daughters.  Samantha Morton (Sarah, the mother) painfully wants to move on, yet misses her son so much.  Her eyes show the soul of sadness and gentle love for her family. She is willing to take a chance at death for another baby. Her hair is cut like a young boy's, perhaps like her son's when he lost his hair because of cancer and the brain tumor?  The two young daughters, played by real sisters Sara and Emma Bolger, seem like you are looking in on children in their own home.  Amazing that they understand and played the parts, deep in meaning and gut wrenching sadness of the loss of their brother and loss of happy parents. The sweetness of Sara's question \\"Why is everyone dying?\\" grabs your gut.  The angry artist on the floor below is played by a wonderful African actor Djimon Hounsou.  His story and the love of a struggling Irish family make confrontation of blame, anger, strength in crisis, and hope the polish to a amazing movie.<br /><br />Although it is a story of family ties and innocent humor, it is not for young children.

B003G4W49C|5.0|This book went through a group of friends and we all had the same problem with it. We couldn't put it down, even to go to sleep. A couple of us stayed up until the wee hours of the morning in order to finish it, and with bleary eyes, passed it on with great enthusiasm, somehow managing not to tell the end. The best part was that in a day or two, we could talk about the end since the book was finished very quickly.     The one thing that surprises me about the book is that it hasn't been turned into a movie. It would be a good one. I guess the only science fiction that gets turned into a good movie are those stories written by Phillip K Dick. Oh well.

1591843790|5.0|Guy Kawasaki's new book Enchantment is his most detailed revelation to date about the art of marketing elevated to spiritual experience.  Kawasaki was a lead evangelist with Apple during its break-out years and was one of the main spark plugs that fired up Apple's legendary brand loyalty.      Kawasaki's recounts the evolution of persuasion as it applies to his Apple experience.  Guy really, really believed Apple was the best computer, and he made a lot of other people really, really believe it too.  But, the power of harnessing Enchantment can be applied to any deeply held belief the reader has a burning desire to share.     Kawasaki refined his skills as a post-Apple venture capitalist, and founder of Alltop, the ubiquitous online content directory.  His new book is his best because he's still engaged and learning. And, in our brave new world of the internet, ten second attention spans and social media you either learn or retire.    In Enchantment, Kawasaki takes us into the inner algorithm of his methodology.  This is a \\"how to\\" book for a subject that is viewed as almost mystical by many.  It is not just a compelling read on how to apply good old fashioned enthusiasm and communication skills to create curiosity, buy-in, and loyalty (in that order) for your product or service.  It goes well beyond the ordinary.  Kawasaki shares his creative insights into how advocacy can transcend its normal boundaries and become an infectious,  life-altering intervention.     Enchantment is a primer on how to make any good idea contagious.    Enchantment is the best, and most revealing, book yet by Guy Kawasaki.  After a amazingly successful career where he has perfected the art of persuasion and motivation. It is generous of Kawaski to share some of the magical secrets of his unique abilities.
1573223026|5.0|For those of you who did not care for the book, perhaps you didn't get it.  This was a fantastic book, with sharp witty dialogue and it dealt with a tragic subject.  If you've never been there, that is, contemplating suicide, then you probably won't enjoy this book.  But it brings me and the characters to many realizations that thinking about killing yourself and actually doing it are two different animals.  Sure, after the first read I thought it was just okay.  Then I read it again and I liked it more.  After the third read, a couple of days ago, I truly began to love this book because I can relate to most of the main characters in some way.  I also found some comic genius in there, at least when it comes to writing a novel.  Sure, About a Boy is good and so is High Fidelity, as is Juliet, Naked.  But A Long Way Down takes risks, and it does things that most authors are afraid to do, which is talk about suicide and it does it in such a smart way that it becomes a book that is actually against suicide in the long run.<br /><br />This book reminds me of something that Chuck Palahniuk would have written, only it is better written than that.  Nick Hornby has such a great writing style and such an insight into the four main characters that this book just jumps off the pages at you.  It is written like an oral biography, kind of like the book Rant: An Oral Biography of Buster Casey, which I also loved and thought was pretty inventive.  What can I say?  I love books with dark humor and dark subject matter.  While you naysayers may love books about rose petals and gardening, I search for books that are a little more realistic to the times we're living in and benefit deeply from it.  Bravo, Nick Hornby, bravo.

I don't know what it is but it is just not engaging.  The author seems to leave you hanging after every section.  When the section ends, you are waiting for her to tell you how to make the change, but that never happens. The book had no flow to it.  There was no buildup or anything.  It's just a bunch of rambling on about mindsets.<br /><br />I was made aware that the author does have another book titled \\"Self Theories.\\" It is more expensive but if the price is right, I just may purchase that one as, from what I am told, it is the better of the two.<br /><br />I don't recommend this book, it's not all it's cracked up to be.

B004L3AQLU|2.0|A bad version of Love Story. It must have been painful to even have to say some of the lines that were written. I never knew where the story was going or where it had been. Locations, time line, connections to previous events, disjointed, all a mess. It seemed to go on forever. And I actually like both of the actors in the film but it was a bad version of an wannabe ok story. How does it end, anyway?
B0032JTV6U|3.0|You have to be a gleek to truly enjoy this set of DVDs of the first season.  I thought I was a fan from watching the show a few times but then after impulsively ordering this item, I have failed to watch more than three episodes.  Yes, the messages are relevant but the cast is contrived and stereotypical and I find it rather insulting.  There is the lesbian P.E. teacher, gay guy, guy in wheelchair, Asian couple, obese African American girl...you get the idea.  The thing that bother me more than the sophomoric renditions of the songs is that the lip-synching is always off!  With technology being what it is today why can't they get this right?  The lyrics to the songs are often changed and homogenized as well.  Save your money and go to a Karaoke Bar.

B0044KI7B6|4.0|It kind of feels like they were going to end Supernatural at the end of season 5 as every season built up to the point where they stopped Armageddon from happening. The show still holds up it's thrill and gives a great story, it just seems at points they ran out of ideas and started throwing random stuff in, such as faeries and dragons, which no 'hunter' that they knew of knew about these things. This of course is still decently believable seeing as angels were as unreal as faeries and dragons when they first ran into them as well.    I don't find it as good as the rest of the series, but it is kind of nice to get out of the constant roller coaster of watching failed attempt after failed attempt to end a seemingly hopeless situation.
B002ZG9774|5.0|What a great film!  Christina and Cher together is a must see.  Even though the plot is somewhat weak at time and a bit contrived, the musical numbers are staggering.  Christina makes this movie and Cher should have sung more and because of that it feels a bit out of balance.  This is clearly a vehicle to showcase Christina's talents and for us to remember the timeless quality of Cher.  This Blu-ray version is very good and includes the regular DVD as well.
B003O86FMW|5.0|In a series, the most difficult part for an author is doing the 2nd book as it will either make or break the set.  Fortunately, the author did not only live up to the 1st book's epic beauty, but has surpassed it as well.<br /><br />Unlike the first novel where you can practically tell where the story was headed, this installment had a lot of surprises in store.  There were more than enough instances where I had an inkling of what was to happen and found myself baffled with how the author \\"pulled the rug\\" from under me.  The novel ends in high-octane offering no recapitulation, leaving the reader grasping for breath and going back to Amazon to get the final book.<br /><br />There are two things I'd like to point out though that has made this book not just a great sequel but a significant book all of its own:<br /><br />1.  The first book was written in a very accessible vocabulary.  Young readers would have gone through the book without needing Kindle's built-in dictionary.  I've noticed on this installment  though that the author has started putting uncommon words that made me use the dictionary 2 or 3 times.  I believe that the author has also done this to indicate that Katniss, though already level-headed for her age, was still maturing.<br /><br />2.  The only time I found myself doubting where the story was headed  was when the protagonist seemed to have suddenly developed humor, albeit, dark and dry.  The heroine was stoic and aggressive in the first book as well as in the first few chapters of Catching Fire, then was suddenly making comments that'd elicit a smile from the reader. This happened so abruptly at around 1/6th through the book that I wondered if the author has finally decided to make the protagonist more \\"mainstream\\".  When two other characters came in, I understood then that the author was setting something-up that was made profound with Katniss' interplay with them using her new-found dry humor.  Whatever that is, it is for you to find out when you read the book.<br />I think the author's introduction of humor while more  complications where heaping on the protagonist was also a way of changing the tone of the text.  While the Hunger Games was dark, foreboding and had elements of despair, the author has given Catching Fire some vestiges of hope which only humor can bring - thereby, giving the 2nd book it's own identity.<br /><br />As I have mentioned in my review for Hunger Games, this series is destined to be a classic.  Reading this book wasn't just a pleasure ... it was a privilege.u read the book.<br />I think the author's introduction of humor while more  complications where heaping on the protagonist was also a way of changing the tone of the text.

B003L20ICE|4.0|Everyone turns in a commendable performance in this film.  \\"The Kids Are All Right\\" confronts issues of diversity, belonging, the search for self and does so with humor pathos and honesty.  Even though the story line might seem contrived and not plausible at times, they are real and out there.  I know this as a personal truth.  Ever-changing family constellations and the challenges that are inherent with them are explored and highlighted very well in this movie.  If nothing else, the scene with Bening and Moore and another couple, in a restaurant having a conversation about organics and being green, is worth the price alone![[ASIN:B003L20ICE The Kids Are All Right]]
B004G5ZXVQ|3.0|Collapse is not the most promising verb to include in the title of a rock album and, combined with some less-than inspired cover art, it doesn't bode well for R.E.M's fifteenth studio outing. Fortunately this album doesn't find the band in a state of catatonia...sleepwalking is probably a better description.     I should add here that I'm a massive fan of R.E.M, and unlike some find plenty to like in their recent work.    But on much of Collapse into Now the band seems content to churn out reworkings of what we've all heard before (Mine Smell Like Honey probably being the worst offender). Other cuts show promise but fail to develop - Walk it Back cries out for lift-off but remains well and truly earthbound and I challenge anyone to recall anything about That Someone Is You after it briefly visits the stereo.    Now to the worst offenders. Alligator_Aviator etc etc (it's a ridiculous song which I can't be bothered typing let alone listening to) seems to be desperately trying to sound tough and cool, something akin to many tracks off Accelerate but while their previous album was often both tough and cool (Horse to Water, anyone?) this comes across as trying too hard. And without a doubt the nadir of the album is (ironically given its title) All the Best. Completely devoid of nuance or variation perhaps R.E.M thought they were creating a sonic assault, but its about as fun as a toddler shouting in your ear. Oh My Heart could've been very good, but the chorus is a yawn.      I've never been as big a fan of Stipe's lyrics as many, and it's no secret that he's a fan of the obtuse, but most of what he has to say here either sounds banal or like random phrases (perhaps he's a Dadaist).    Instrumentally, the albums lacks complexity although there are some nices touches here and there (the accordian on Oh My Heart and percussion shift on Discoverer being two).    Why three stars then? Well, while half the album is very disappointing there's also plenty to like. Discoverer isa great way to kick off a record, with grinding guitars and a simple but memorable chorus. Uberlin and It Happened Today are both very easy on the ears, even if not entirely original. Every Day is Yours to Win has an endearing simplicity and could end up being my favourite track. Marlon Brando also gets points for being straightforward and effective.    And closing off the record is Blue, the only track on the album which isn't straightforward, which would alone be enough to make it a winner, but it also boasts a great spoken delivery by Stipe with enticing vocal accompaniment by Patti Smith.    Someone commented that this has the sound of a greatest hits collection. Maybe it does. But it would be the greatest hits of a band who hadn't had many great songs (I'd hate to hear their b-sides).    In fact, this is among the weakest album's of R.E.M's canon. The fact that it's not a complete write-off, then, is testament to their long and prodigous career.

B000VBIGD6|5.0|I looked everywhere for this DVD over the Christmas season and finally purchased it on Amazon. What can I say? It's a classic. Shipping was fast and the price was reasonable.
B002ZG99TK|5.0|Based on real events, this movie is fast, exciting, and full of energy.  Denzel Washington is outstanding as the grizzled engineer about to be forced to retire, and Chris Pine is believable as a rookie conductor trying to prove he is capable.  Brief glimpses are provided of the two men's backgrounds and family, enough to establish their characters, but not so much that it slows down the story.  All the other characters are equally believable, and special effects don't overpower the story.  The movie looks real, the people act and talk real, and the action is almost constant.  The blu-ray transfer is one of the best I have ever seen.  All the images are sharp, and the sound through my home theatre system was even better than when I saw this in the theatre.
B00065GX64|5.0|I don't know if it is in writing somewhere, but if I was to guess I would imagine Alfred Hitchcock was a fan of Fritz Lang. The movie \\"M\\" is distinctly timeless and was I am sure quite modern thinking for it's time. Lang was known for his profound visual depictions of society. He had a keen eye and was probably the first to use lighting and different camera angles to establish a mood. Fans of his movies will tell you that he knew how to show us images of all walks of life that draw you into the story and relate to some aspect of your life that you can identify with on some level. What amazes me about his movies is with some slight modernizing changes like color, you have a current movie. The detail of the movie and thought provoking subject matter make it as relevant today as it was in 1931. Peter Lorre is outstanding as a serial killer out of control. He displays an uncanny ability to portray someone that even criminals hate. Anyone that enjoys murder mysteries should enjoy it, not just fans of old movies. If you enjoy it, be sure to see [[ASIN:B0040QYROK The Complete Metropolis [Blu-ray]]].<br /><br />CA Luster
1591843790|5.0|Let's face it: Guy is enchanting. He's been enchanting a long time, and he's learned quite a bit about being enchanting. Of course, he's also an astute businessman, and has stayed on the bleeding edge of technology and marketing for as long as I've known him.<br /><br />This book takes all of that - all those insights and lessons that he's learned - and compiles it into a very readable book. You will find yourself marking up the pages, and sending emails out to your business associates saying things like, \\"We need to remember to do this.\\"<br /><br />Guy tends to take obvious (but not always practiced) wisdom to a new instructional level. Such as emphasizing the need to be personal, rather than promotional, in your social media interactions. He provides useful examples that quickly demonstrate his point. He certainly practices what he preaches, being one of the most accomplished users of social media out there today.<br /><br />One of the big concepts in this book is that the most enchanting thing you can do is always take things just one step farther. In a sense, that's what the Apple philosophy is all about; I think one of the main reasons that Apple designs great products is because Steve just doesn't settle for \\"good enough.\\" He wants to be able to stand on stage and pull that super-slim laptop out of a standard business envelope, to demonstrate how thin it is. He wants to have one control circle on the iPod, giving you the simplest method possible to change the volume or the song. He knows when it is as simple as it can be, and doesn't rest until that level of simplicity has been achieved.<br /><br />Elegance of design is enchanting. Interacting in a personal, thoughtful, and kind way is enchanting. Running your business ethically is enchanting. Guy covers all of these realities and does it in a way that is simultaneously engaging and educational. He's very good at bringing business down to the basics of successful interactions between human beings.<br /><br />A great book to read on a long flight, when you have some time to reflect on what you're reading., when you have some time to reflect on what you're reading.

0316098337|5.0|I must admit, I went into this book with hesitation as a mindset. This is outside my normal reading, but when I get into a book I can easily finish it within a few days if it pulls me in. Room was one such book, as the story is emotionally gripping as well as having you hoping throughout the entire book that all ends well.    As a future educator, I think this is a book that could indeed be teachable within a classroom. Some may gasp at the thought of this book within a classroom setting, but what of the issues of racism in Huck Finn? Catcher in the Rye's implicit dealings with depression, sex, and violence? These are real issues, and they really do affect our children, especially teenagers. As for Room, it deals with extremely powerful issues of treatment of women, rape, and violence. These are issues that I feel would require a mature mindset and if this book is going to be used in a class these are issues that should be explicitly warned about before reading and talked about during reading.    As such, I wouldn't recommend this book be used in any classroom lower than the 11th grade in my personal opinion to ensure that the more serious side of the book is to be taken seriously. The author does put us in the mind of a child, and the prose at this perspective is honestly perfect, so there are bound to be some chuckles here and there as our main character, Jack, asks such innocent questions as \\"Was I minus numbers?\\" I do believe that this book will grip students with as much ferocity as it gripped me, though, and to get them reading a book with this much raw emotional power seeping out of the pages will guarantee some lively discussions in class.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|I really enjoyed this show/webseries. It was just really charming. None of the singers were amazingly talented, but the lyrics and delivery were very original and interesting. My only problem with this is that it's way too short, I would have loved to see more. Also, related to this, the ending was a little annoying and forced, though funny. Everyone should check this out if they have a free hour, especially if you're even slightly a geek or a music fan.
B003UESJH4|5.0|I am not a big history buff. Wish I were but cannot seem to retain dates, names, etc. So I had this movie for awhile, waiting for the right time to watch it -- which was the other night with a group of friends while on vacation. It was excellent and I was prompted me to get The Queen and Mrs Brown the next day.<br /><br />\\"The King's Speech\\" is heartwarming, humorous, captivating, compelling, emotional, truly memorable. I really didn't expect to love it as much as I did as I thought it would be boring. But the fantastic acting made it anything but.<br /><br />I have always liked Colin Firth and he does not disappoint in this movie. But Geoffrey Rush is absolutely absolutely phenomenal. Helena Bonham Carter is great too as Firth's supportive, loving but slightly arrogant wife, the late Queen Mother.<br /><br />In a nutshell, the movie is about Prince Albert, the Duke of York, who unexpectantly is forced to take the throne when his father, King George V, dies and his older brother abdicates. But King George VI (Bertie to those close to him) has a bad stammer which he developed at the age of four and has tried to overcome to no avail. After his older brother chooses an inappropriate romance over the throne, Bertie is forced to become the next King. His stammer and hatred of public speaking prompts his wife to find him a very different type of speech therapist, Lionel Logue played brilliantly by Geoffrey Rush, who despite lacking the paper credentials, assists King George VI in overcoming his stammer with very unorthodox methods.<br /><br />Bertie and the eccentric and somewhat irreverant Lionel begin to work together on the King's stammer and develop a life long friendship in the process, despite their very different social classes. The interplay between them is wonderful, humorous, and heartwarming. Colin Firth as the tormented class-conscious very serious king versus Lionel, an unemployed actor turned speech therapist who works hard to lighten the king up. Rush was superb!<br /><br />The cast includes Michael Gambon as King George V, Guy Pearce as the lovelorn shortlived King Edward VIII, Timoty Spall once again as Winston Churchill, Claire Bloom as Queen Mary, Derek Jacobi as Archbishop Cosmo Lang, Jennifer Ehle as Lionel Logue's wife, Anthony Andrews as Stanley Baldwin, and Roger Parrott as Neville Chamberlain.<br /><br />As I said earlier, \\"The King's Speech\\" is heartwarming, humorous, captivating, compelling, emotional, truly memorable.ael Gambon as King George V, Guy Pearce as the lovelorn shortlived King Edward VIII, Timoty Spall once again as Winston Churchill, Claire Bloom as Queen Mary, Derek Jacobi as Archbishop Cosmo Lang, Jennifer Ehle as Lionel Logue's wife, Anthony Andrews as Stanley Baldwin, and Roger Parrott as Neville Chamberlain.

031261246X|1.0|Book review title Zero Day by Mark Russinovich.     Have you recently seen low budget junk rated Hollywood action movies?    Do you like to know what's going to happen or what's going on when you are in the middle of a book or movie?    If your answer is \\"yes\\", then go ahead and buy this book.     The misleading description makes you think that author will create an image of what will happen in the world where computer systems are down, or how national cyber security will respond in a case of hacker attack.     None of this is in the book. Any grandma familiar with e-mail and Internet will do a better job.    Bill Gates must be ashamed for promoting this junk.

0525423273|5.0|I don't think there are words to express my love for this novel. It was seriously that good. I can't believe that I waited so long to finally read it. I was a little worried I would be disappointed because it has been so hyped up and I am glad to say that I most definitely was not. This is one of those books that I will be pushing everyone that I know to read.<br /><br />I adored Anna and St. Clair. They were one of my favorite duos ever. They fit so perfectly together. I also loved all of the supporting characters because well, without them, this story would not have been what it was. Teenage love in the city of romance. Yes, please! I virtually read this in one sitting because I did not want to put it down. Time flew by and I didn't even notice.<br /><br />Even after I finished this I couldn't stop smiling. It was such a feel good book!  It was so easy to connect with Anna. She handled certain situations in the same way that I could see myself doing. She was incredibly realistic! She could easily be someone who is a friend of mine. I swear that I could actually feel what Anna felt. I wanted to laugh when she laughed and cry when she cried. She was such an extremely likeable character!<br /><br />I can't wait to see what else Stephanie Perkins has in store for us in the future!

It's both easy reading and a bit plodding, but well worth the time.<br /><br />On a personal level, following his general guidelines, I've nearly-effortlessly lost an average of approximately three pounds per week for three months. \\"Nearly-effortlessly\\" means no gnawing hunger, no cravings, no binges, and no guilt.<br /><br />I've incorporated the idea of one \\"free food\\" day per week (for me, it's Saturday), on which I can eat anything I want. The catch is, I must follow Taubes' ideas religiously the other six days. Doing that, there's no guilt on Saturday, and the next Saturday is never more than six days away! It's a profound mind trick.<br /><br />Taubes is reasonable, logical, and his research is, to this layman, impeccable.<br /><br />P.S.

I really did not end up getting attached to any of the characters; I don't feel they were fleshed out enough.<br />Meh.
1591843790|5.0|If providing service is about delighting customers, then enchanting customers is its distant emotional cousin. The word enchantment is closely associated with magic, surprise, astonishment, curiosity and intrigue. Isn't that what business should be about - the many indirect moments of truth? Innovation in products and services should consider the emotional impact and effect it has on the consumer, considering how the iPhone and iPad have made such a significant influence on our lives.    Despite his overarching reputation as the former-Chief Evangelist of Apple - he promoted with amazing marketing ambidexterity for Apple its Macintosh personal computer - Mr Kawasaki has firmly established himself as the business-owner's guru, yet he still has more offerings in his bag of tricks. I enjoyed Guy's `The Art of the Start' - focused mainly on new business upstarts and startups - and how to, sensibly and ostensibly, sell and market products and services. I applied many of his ideas including adopting a Mensch-ian mindset, and closed a few business deals in the process. He insists that values matter, especially when you lead as a role model ('mensch').    This book has relevance to entrepreneurs and intra-preneurs, the latter being initiators of actions in the company. This time, he condenses his research of about 20 books and passes them through his entrepreneurial and marketing filters. He strongly integrates the landmark work of Robert Cialdini, and adapts the latter's observed principles, and adeptly overlays it over a business fabric. Push & Pull Technology (in chapters 8 and 9 respectively) are about using Social Media 2.0 to further your cause. This he suggests that you do, through your tribes of evangelists, emphasizing the pertinent folds in the digital origami platform, which could unfold your business potential. One guarantee he makes is how to enchant your audience in the first five minutes of your presentation.    For a small book of about 200 pages, Mr Kawasaki has succeeded on several levels. Enchantment is not one of those books where you only read the preface, first and last chapters, and the rest filled with unexciting fillers. You can benefit from applying the principles from any chapter, immediately. Mr Kawasaki writes in his inimitable style with a unique sense of humour. You may be enchanted by his ideas as a venture capitalist, serial author, business consultant and a resume that is wide as it is deep (founder of Alltop.com, and has an honorary doctorate). This book is a good primer to explore his other books such as Rules of Revolutionaries. Simple concepts may be hard to implement; thus, common sense may be uncommon. Instead of becoming a convert, perhaps we can invert our wile and wistful ways of doing business towards a customized (versus customary) approach. Each chapter is supplemented with a success story of enchantment at work, and summarises the usefulness of the content. The numerous anecdotal references make this book content-rich and very readable. To reiterate a triphon, it is: content, content, and content. And this book piques your curiosity with its matter-dense content, without losing the plot.    Like the one-of-a-kind Kawasaki butterfly on his cover - derived from 250 submissions in a clever contest - by walking-his-talk, he subtly urges us to flap our action wings and flutter away to personal discoveries. I strongly recommend this magical book to you - of which mine will be dog-eared, underlined and heavily used soon - my mark of respect to an author.

All 7 speakers are active throughout the movie. The movie didn't do commercially well because of maybe star cast but I enjoyed the movie from start till end & wouldn't mind watching again particularly the action scenes.
B000Q66JXA|1.0|I have to disagree with most of the other reviewers. I felt this movie was definitely showing its age of 30 years old. The battle scenes are hokey compared to modern films and I thought the acting was wooden with the actors merely walking through their scenes.  The only redeeming factor is that it does tell the tale of King Arthur, the sword of Excalibur, and the Knights of the Round Table in detail. It's a great story but not a great movie. I suggest renting the movie. I'd sell you the copy I purchased real cheap

B0046HAKMQ|5.0|Let me begin with a simple request: Please do not be misguided by the negative reviews you may read.     While I can see why some may feel this book is too \\"dark\\" for their young children, I also think that it's a shame to deny a child the chance to encounter such a darkness and see it overcome by wit, spirit, and above all, imagination. After all, before Disney gets ahold of them(and even after) most of the fairy tales in existance contain scenes that are grusome and disturbing. Most of the parents writing reviews on this site grew up with these classic cautionary tales, and it is extremely sad to see how overly protective we have become with children and what a toll that takes on their imaginations.       Coraline is not only one of my favorite children's books, but one of my favorite books of all time. The story itself, while at times reminiscent of Alice in Wonderland, is such a wonderful experience with vivid imagery. From dusty rooms to musty attics and rotting fruit, Neil Gaiman's writing allows(forces, really) you to smell, see and sometimes taste what's on the page in front of you. The character of Coraline herself is one that will remain with you in her humor, bravery, wit, and sometimes ignorance.      This is a book that should be read by adults and children alike. Let your imagination take over and read books the way they are supposed to be read.
1402211252|5.0|Poor Kitty Charing is in a terrible fix!  Her crotchety and miserly old guardian just informed her that she is to be the sole beneficiary of his fortune and estate, but only if she marries one his nephews.  While some of Mr. Penicuik's nephews are eager to inherit his fortune and marry his ward, others are not.  And unfortunately for Kitty, the one nephew (Jack) she was hoping to bestow her hand upon in marriage, has the audacity to not even show his face!  Kitty in desperate straits decides that there is no other recourse except for her to runaway.  One of Mr. Penicuik's nephews (Freddy) stops her from this absurd notion and instead agrees to enter into a sham engagement with her.  Kitty hopes this fake betrothal will grant her the London adventure she's always wanted, as well as teach her negligent suitor, Jack, a well-deserved lesson!  What ensues is a whirlwind adventure complete with an abudnance of mishaps, marriages, and hilarity!<br /><br />To put it simply, reading Georgette Heyer novels is a blast!  I love the fantastic combination of comedy, drama, and history in her novels.  One of my favorite aspects of her writing is Ms. Heyer's exquisitely-crafted secondary characters.  All these characters are skillfully drawn and possess distinctive and unique personalities.  Her simple-minded Lord Dolphington kept me in stitches with his repetitive recitals: \\"I like Freddy. Always have. I like him better than Hugh. I like him better than...\\"  I also took pleasure in Freddy's father, Lord Legerwood with his arch comments, and his daughter Meg, with her appallingly bad taste in fashion.  And we must not forget the cantankerous and gouty Mr. Penicuik, or Kit's incurably sentimental governess, Miss \\"Fish\\" Fishguard, whose histrionics were quite hilarious.<br /><br />Just like in Devil's Cub, Ms. Heyer's employment of Regency cant and colloquialisms in Cotillion is a source of great amusement and entertainment for me.  My favorite phrases in this novel include: \\"make a cake of myself,\\" \\"all the crack,\\" and \\"havey-cavey!\\"  There is quite a bit of dialogue in Ms. Heyer's novels, and through her dialogue I was able to learn much about these colorful characters and experience the action of the plot firsthand.<br /><br />The romance between this unlikely hero and heroine may be my favorite Heyer romance yet!  Kitty Charing, although she starts out as a self-absorbed and impetuous schemer, beautifully grows into a big-hearted and admirable heroine with a penchant for helping others.  And our hero - while he may not be the most handsome and charming of men, he does capture the reader's heart by being reliable, honorable, and always coming to the rescue.  I took great pleasure in witnessing how these characters, while becoming embroiled in the affairs of others, underwent character transformations of their own.<br /><br />Cotillion by Georgette Heyer is incredibly entertaining and memorable.

Keith and Mick will forever be two of the most fascinating and talented characters to emerge from the British rock factory of the 60's. However, for the first half of this book I found myself bombarded by countless lists of those who were early influences on Keith's taste in music. Appreciating the fact that the Stones were moulded by early Blues is undeniable, but the writing becomes bogged down by what can only be described as 'old blues picker' shopping lists. Muddy Waters and Howlin Wolf among others must be mentioned in list form 10-15 times within just a couple of chapters , and not necessarily with any true sense of who they were...they're merely listed in a hazy tribute to different aspects of subtle nuances of styles of playing. 'Life' is overall a great story, but in other ways it is just what you might expect to hear from a drunken, drug addled Keith Richards circa 1972 reminiscing about the good old days in a mumbling sometimes incoherent narrative; engrossing and charming in so many ways but often veering off into useless mind numbing drivel.
1594488878|2.0|The book was well constructed...the dialogue is well written. But the characters: Yuck. I just found them to be idiotic and boring. That's all. I appreciate that this is a well-written book by a successful author. But the characters are total losers and after a while they got on my nerves.
B004DMIIVO|5.0|First of I have to say I went on a whim to order this movie, I went purely off of the trailer. After I watched the trailer I just had to order this anime. I'm happy to say I was not disappointed! It is truly a beautiful anime, both visually and in story. I absolutely love how they tied in the importance of family and how our actions can affect the ones we love. If you are looking for something heart-warming and that you can watch with the whole family, I highly recommend Summer Wars!
B000EGDB10|2.0|By and large, the movie fails because it strays too far from the premise of the TV show and ventures into 007 and Bourne territory.    No IMF team, no suspense, poor story.    The TV series is far superior.
B0043ZDU1E|5.0|While you may be a top 10 reviewer, I disagree with you on a few points E.A. Solinas.<br /><br />Every song on this album fits Loreena like the best 5-fingered glove.<br /><br />Before her worldly sound developed in 'The Visit', Ms. McKennitt had very much pinned down 'Celtic' sound to a science and with 'The Wind that Shakes the Barley', she brings all of her experience and knowledge, from 'Elemental' to 'An Ancient Muse', with her. There is no part of this beautiful tread down memory lane that isn't wholly Loreena McKennitt and her troupe of amazing musicians, every single one contributing to the album in their own incredibly unique ways.<br /><br />If Loreena McKennitt decided to stop making music with this album (which I'm sure she won't), as disappointed as I would be, I couldn't imagine a better finish than by bringing us back to her roots. With Loreena's worldly influence and Celtic flair, this album absolutely soars as her finest work to date.<br /><br />An absolute masterpiece in every way, and while I'd review every song, I can't. The individual reviews would be \\"I LOVE THIS SONG.\\"<br /><br />This album has been 54 years in the making. It doesn't take nearly as long to fall in love with it.
B0041X901C|5.0|You should note that this DVD will not play in most DVD players. I have 6 and DVD Audio in the car and none would play this.  Had to clone a copy that made it Region 1 before I could play it. Quite an excellent DVD once you can play it.  Surround mix is awesome, even plays on ML player in Lexus, but have to set it up manually. Blows the DTS version of Fly like an Eagle away.
B004INNRFK|4.0|Love the short stories DF tells between songs, and the performances were very enjoyable. I love the camera angles and felt I had a better seat than if I was really there.      The audio CD was a disappointment; only a few of the performances held my attention. I'm not sure how the songs for the CD were chosen, but I feel there are several that would have been much better.     Still I recommend this for those who enjoy this type of music because even without the CD, the DVD is well worth the price.

0393317552|1.0|Jared Diamond uses present day knowledge, attitudes and motivations to explain human historical acts. His knowledge and understanding of the scope of human history is as limited as looking through a telescope at the universe.    He wrote the book specifically as an apology to a man he met and liked from a different culture. Armed with a little knowledge and a personal sense of shame he embarked on a journey to answer this man's question. Few real facts are correctly presented. Those few that were correctly presented are interesting but do not advance his thesis, however, they do save him from having created a completely fallacious book.

B003EYVXXW|5.0|AGORA is a stunningly accurate picture of early Christendom as it smashed and killed to establish itself as the paramount religion of the world. No mere megalomaniacs these, but driven fanatics, convinced of a moral rectitude and a higher truth that enabled them then and now, to commit the most fiendish acts in the name of their lord and master. Stunning, simply stunning. Weisz is supported by a strong cast, of which she is head and shoulders the strongest. Her inevitable fate is poignant, horrifying and ultimately a triumph. Be prepared to think as well as feel. 5*.

B0013FSXT6|4.0|Kubrick is known for highly unique movies, and this one is no exception. While this movie has been out for several years, I just recently viewed it. It has a lot of different movie components like full frontal nudity, other sexual scenes, murder, STD, some romance, intrigue,and a lot of irony. The ending is quite schoking, and concludes in classic Kubrick style.   This movie is not recommended for those who are easily offended by nudity or strong language.  I purchased the blue-ray format, and really have learned to appreciate the more vibrant colors.  JTB
B000009HF2|5.0|I don't like Frampton studio music but this live cd is worth a check out. Most songs are good but you may find one or two you may not like. This is another replacement for a loned out item I lost. Not heavy rock but not boring.
B002VWNID6|5.0|Thought Alan Rickman was terrific in this movie.  Also thought the movie sets were more realistic (dirty castles, people looked unkempt) than most \\"period\\" films.  The movie actually had a sense of humor about it and I always think Alan Rickman does outstanding work in any film he does.
B0042EJD8A|5.0|A reprint from my Review for [[ASIN:B004P1IXZE Hydrofracked? One Man's Mystery Leads to a Backlash Against Natural Gas Drilling (Kindle Single)]]:<br /><br />While watching CNN and the devastation of Japan, two commercials came up sporting the tag of \\"The People of America's Oil and Natural Gas Industry.\\"  Further research (because I wanted to look up the website), led to Wiki indicating these ads were actually from the American Petroleum Institute.<br /><br />They spotted, that day - how new technology allows the Natural Gas Drilling to come from the same well as oil drilling (Encana is very much a part of API), however - how many of these drills do we actually see?  The ad says it lessons the impact on the environment, so we have less polluted water?  The next ad shows how they (API) boosts the economy through 9.2 million jobs.  Both these ads occur to me to be on the defensive.  They have changed from 2 years ago - when they presented themselves as the solution to all our problems (while they had folks repeating that slogan \\"drill baby drill\\")<br /><br />***********************************<br /><br />I have HBO, so I watched this in HD a few times.  Even though I live in a city area, the callousness and greed with which these companies operate will anger you.  You just can't help but relate and be saddened by the current state of affairs.<br /><br />Yes, this movie is bound to set off some political back lash and controversy.  But I believe that the release via DVD AND the free Kindle Short by ProPublica is getting the news out there. Congratulations on getting the Nomination by the Academy, and the Academy not backing down due to pressure from a multi-billion dollar industry lobby.<br /><br />I hope the expansion with Hydrofracking doesn't continue.  Or at the very least - those workers, execs that refused to drink the tainted water, actually have a pitcher full.  Only by getting the word out there, can pressure remain on Congress to shore up the Safe Clean Drinking Water act again, and re institute the EPA into testing and monitoring.<br /><br />*************************<br /><br />Unfortunately, with Congress in the state its in - funding is just not being provided, and that money from the Oil industry is needed.  But the country risks a 25% loss of usable land and water, for the sake of greed and money. Please, someone, tell us that you are listening.<br /><br />While they do seem to be focused on not leaving debt to our children's children, how about leaving them with land they can live on, and water they can drink?  We may have to switch from importing Oil to importing Water, and that will cost a HECK of a lot more than importing oil (think about it).<br /><br />Buy the DVD, or get the book.

B000002NAK|5.0|I was impressed with speed of delivery, condition of product & quality of packaging for the product.    The soundtrack itself is wonderful as I saw the original movie when it came out and feel Madonna & Antonio deserved a better review than they got for their performances.
1878424505|1.0|If I could give this zero stars I would. Aside from the fact that the author writes in an annoying 8th grade vocabulary, the book is unbearably repetitive. I purchased the book to see what all the &#34;fuss&#34; was about. While Toltec Wisdom is of great interest to me, this book is not. Truly, it was written in a strange Hawaiian Pidgin-like language.
B003V4AK8E|4.0|If u like XBOX 360 controller more, (like me) u want this for PS3. There are few problems that u should know before buying. Played Motorstorm APO with this and it works really good. The R2,L2  Trickers are 10 times better than Sonys one. They keep finger in place even better than the XO ones. But what i noticed was that the Right Stick is really high/far from right tumb. Didnt test any FPS games yet but it will take some getting used to as atleast i need to move my right hand to get my tumb to the stick... This can make fps gaming bit akward. will have to test it better tho.    But all in all its really good controller if u think the normal is too small for your hand etc. it has its own trasmitter (dunno why?) so u cant turn on your PS3 with it. It has PS Button so u can however shut it down with controller.    Pros:    Good Trickers (R2-L2)  Fits nicely to bigger hand  Good material    Cons:    Right stick is badly placed  Needs transmitter

B002YICN74|4.0|This is a great first solo effort by Nick Jonas.  Nick goes way out over his head when writing about love relationships of which he has had none of substance... but his imagination and knowledge of what works with lyrics and with notes pulls it all off.  At age 18, Nick is just getting to know his own sexual identity and is thinking about going to collage, in a possable eventual quest for the White House, where about four years of sexual exploration would also likely take place.  Nick maybe should entertain the idea of being first man initailly rather than going stright to President. Skipping collage, going gay, saying yes to his President... he will be as likely to be ready for a Presidency of his own by 2040 that route for sure.  Anyway, the CD and Nick are both interesting, if you are a mature about music and don't need a lot of shallow pop hooks and such, this CD won't disappoint you.  JonJonas for President and NickJonas for first man 2016.

0307346617|5.0|This book was one of the best Zombie read, I have read in a while.

0786939532|4.0|I had passed the Forgotten Realm books for over a decade, preferring Dragon Lance and snobbishly refusing to extend my love of the genre to RA Salvatore.  For some reason I assumed that what I was reading currently was the pinnacle of fantasy and all others would be a pale comparison.  Finally, at the insistence of a persistent friend, I finally picked up Homeland.<br /><br />The opening pages were not encouraging.  I felt like the author was bludgeoning me the fact that the realm of the Drow was dark.  Really, really, dark dark dark!  After that though, the novel steadily improved.  I found myself captivated by the cruel, female dominate society and the horror of their bloody, chaotic religion.  It reminded of the society Anne Bishop built in the Black Jewels trilogy, where murder is not against the law and women have the power of life or death over men.  The setting is unique to anything I have previously experienced; envisioning the Drow world in a primordial darkness, dimly lit by a mage fire was an eerie experience.<br /><br />The main character in this dark drama is a violet eyed drow, the only drow in all the Underdark that was born with a conscience, and the balls to use it.  We follow Drizzt as he struggles to carve a place for himself in a hostile society without destroying his soul in the process.  He makes his way as a warrior, and I found myself skimming over the many, many combat scenes.  One reviewer mentioned that it brought him back to his 15yr old boy roots, and that seems to be a good way to describe the target audience of Homeland.  That being said, my 30 year old husband absolutely loved Homeland, and actually went on to read many other books in the series.  This, from the man that loves to read instruction manuals and How To guides, exclusively.<br /><br />What I really loved about this novel was Drizzt's journey towards morality without compromise, and his bond with the celestial spirit cat, Guenhwyvar.  As a quick fluff read, Homeland is excellent.  As a literary masterpiece, not so much.  After reading Homeland I quickly picked up the rest of the series, and tore through them at record pace.  In many ways, it was like revisiting my old Dragon Lance family.  Fans of Dragon Lance will love Homeland, and I'd even recommend it to fans of the Black Jewels series.  For young adult readers, this series is a must have.masterpiece, not so much.  After reading Homeland I quickly picked up the rest of the series, and tore through them at record pace.

072325804X|5.0|An absolutely beautiful book! I love how at the beginning of each story, it tells about the book. The illustrations are gorgeous. Would recommend to anyone!
B0049P1ZZQ|4.0|I read the book, or compendium, if you will (graphic novel, *cough *cough), so I was pretty excited when I found out this was going to be a TV series.<br /><br />Now, I'm not really sure what the intent is here, but it doesn't look like they set out to mirror the series, because for the most part they don't. I have spoken with other fans of the book, and they all seem to be pretty split 50/50 on whether or not they enjoy that.<br /><br />That being said, the diversions from the book, and it really diverts, aren't too bad, though they have their moments. I think the episode \\"Vatos\\" really should have been left out, but I think they did an awesome job with episodes 2 and 3, and I love the story they added. There are quite a bit of added characters, which I can only assume are in place to be killed off.<br /><br />The thing I love most about this, is that they did a great job with the casting, and they did the visual effects justice. The zombies look awesome. I was a little scared that this might turn out to be a cheesy TV makeover, but they really did a great job here.<br /><br />In the end, even with the story diversions (for fans of the comic series), it is definitely worth watching.
031261246X|5.0|The name Mark Russinovich should be familiar to anyone in the IT industry. He's the co-founder of Winternals (which operated the Sysinternals website), now owned by Microsoft.

What made this particular take on the subject most appealing to me, is the author's in-depth knowledge of computer threats - from viruses to malware, I was expecting a technically-accurate, realistic read, and that's exactly what I got!<br /><br />Zero Day is Mark Russinovich's debut novel, well-written in such way that appeals both to computer experts and novices. Mark does a great job balancing the technical explanations in such way that they do not bore more tech savvy readers, and do not to overwhelm others. Combined with a fast-paced action, Zero Day is a perfect page turner for anyone!<br /><br />Some spoilers ahead!<br /><br />Zero Day begins with series of seemingly unrelated events - an airplane suddenly loses control over the Atlantic, wrongful prescription of medicine causes numerous deaths in various hospitals, an assembly line robot suddenly begins spinning out of control.

B0012GN198|5.0|It's such a shame that by 1996 anything tagged with the grunge moniker was considered old hat by mainstream media and fans alike. This gem of an album easily ranks up there with the best of Seattle's \\"Big Four\\" and is light years ahead of anything Creed or Nickelback could ever hope of concocting. It's straightforward, mature and melodic, sans the cheesy theatrics of what passes for rock music these days, and every song is a keeper. An all time classic.      UPDATE 6/7/11   The CD-R re-release is a complete joke. Shameful. If you're buying for the first time, hunt down an import or buy a used original copy. To hell with Sony Music.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins follows the story of a girl name Katniss. It takes place in a future where the world has changed dramatically. As a result of wars that have taken place, the Capitol institutes a yearly event, called The Hunger Games, to remind the people of their past and to make sure it will never happen again. These games are central to the entire story for the main character, as the reader follows her through the emotions and turmoil she experiences.    The Good: The storytelling in The Hunger Games is top-notch. I found myself swiftly enthralled with the world the author created. I cared about the characters. I felt the pain and agony of the games. This is a very well written book. The author tells the story from the first-person perspective by the main character, Katniss. Throughout the entirety of the book, you come to know the character very well - as the author describes her feelings with a lot of detail. Many times I found myself caught up in the character's thoughts to the point that I forgot it I was even reading it in the first-person perspective. There's no doubt about it that this is an enjoyable book to read.    The Bad: Being unfamiliar with the Young Adult genre of books, my gripe on The Bad might be something that is inherent with similar books. Throughout the book, the character tends to repeat many of her thoughts and feelings. The author mentions the past regularly, and that past being referred to often is the same thing over in over. This is a minor annoyance, but it is there nonetheless. Fortunately, it doesn't taint the overall story. Which leads me to the most ironic thing about this book...    The Ugly: I'm not sure if this was the author's intent, but the one thing I absolutely did not like about The Hunger Games was The Hunger Games. The reasoning behind why The Hunger Games - a brutal match of young children where they all fight to the death and there is one winner, all of this televised for the population to see andfor some reason enjoy - is unbelievable. I cannot see in any society tolerating something like this. I do not understand why people would accept it. The whole basis for this book feels so completely implausible that I found myself totally distracted by it while reading the entire book.    In the end, I really liked The Hunger Games. Despite the impossible premise, the story the author tells is very good. I've never read a book that made me feel so conflicted, and I guess that is a good thing. The fact that I like it so much in one respect and hate it in another is a testament to what the author wrote. Intentional or not, the book strikes a chord in some form and makes you think. I highly suggest you give this one a read.
031261246X|5.0|I preordered this months ago and received it a few days ago.  I've only read up to page 51, but so far I love it.  First off, I was surprised by the amount of sex (on page 1!) but I am really appreciating the realism of the computer talk.  Everything is handled realistically, no BS fantasy computing like you see on '24' or 'CSI'.  I smiled when author used real assembly code and technologies like encryption, firewalls and Active Directory are discussed accurately.  The action moves fast with short chapters that move among the attacks unfolding across the globe.  The pace at which the main character, Jeff, solves forensic problems is completely believable i.e. working (and often failing) over hours or days, not in seconds like typically shown on TV.<br /><br />Readers of William Gibson and Tom Clancy will find a lot to love here.  I hope this is the first in a series.

1589795474|3.0|I just finished reading this book cover to cover. Twenty five years ago I would have given it five stars. But honestly, the book is very dated. The data that went into it was compiled starting in the early 1970s. More studies were done in the 1980s. The most recent study that was done by the author was in 1995-96. So, even the most fresh data is 15 years old. There are a few references to projections out to 2005. So, I had a hard time focusing on the material in the book because I was constantly wondering if the references and values mentioned applied to the 1970's or 1980's or perhaps 1990's.<br /><br />Overall, however, if you look past how dated the book is, it's a very interesting assessment and will certainly help you understand the differences between high income earners who are also hyperconsumers but with low net worths and the frugal self-employed person who squirrels away millions. The author calls the former group UAWs or under accumulators of wealth. The PAWs are prodigious accumulators of wealth and they are who this book is all about. The author breaks the myth that people that drive high-end cars and buy nice houses and clothing and houses are the \\"rich\\". He proposes that the real rich, are those that work hard, live simply and frugally, and save their money. I don't have any reason to not follow this thesis. I just have a difficult time relating the charts and graphs and data based on 15-35 year old studies to our world today. This book deserves a fresh rewrite...not just an updated preface.
B004MMEIK0|4.0|I got this book because it was free, I like vampire fiction and the description intriqued me. A vampire and dentist seemed like an interesting pair. Once I started, I couldn't put it down. The main characters' romance was a bit more adolescent that I usually read, but I actually enjoyed it. A lot. I wouldn't compare Sparks to Linda Howard quite yet, but I think she'll get there. I will pay for the author's next book.

B001C4AFOY|4.0|This 2009 film is based on the early years of Queen Victoria's reign, one in which the young queen, played by Emily Blunt, has to deal with the complex politics of the throne and also falls in love.  Basically, this film is a love story between the Queen and Prince Albert who reigned together for 20 years and had nine children before his untimely death.  She actually reigned for 63 years which I learned later from doing a little research on the internet.<br /><br />The film itself is rather slow moving and predictable.  However, I didn't care.  I loved the costumes and the pageantry and atmosphere of privilege and royalty.  The young Victoria was pretty and rather innocent of the ways of politics but she learned quickly enough.  And it's nice to see a royal couple who actually seem to be in love with each other.  I don't know enough about British history to critique the authenticity of this film.  To me it was a lavish love story that held my interest throughout.

B002ZG980U|5.0|This movie is destined to be a CLASSIC.  At the Oscars it seemed to be largely overlooked and was nominated only for special effects and the like.  I can only assume that the movie was too cerebral for the Academy, and that they just plain didn't understand it.  Too bad.  It has an excellent script, but you can't afford to not pay constant attention.  Special effects, cinematography, set designs and the like were excellent, but so were the acting and directing. This is one of those rare movies where all violence and special effects were an integral part of the story; they weren't just \\"thrown in\\".  I saw the movie three times in the theater; buying the DVD was a must. A must buy.
B003ZHQVJO|4.0|This is an album that many Kid Rock fans won't like. This is definitely a more soft rock, blues, and country album as opposed to a more hard rock album where he does rap. I personally like the direction he took (especially with the last track For the First Time In a Long Time, which i don't think anyone who has never heard this song would ever guess that's Kid Rock). It is certainly much different then the stuff he's done before and i don't think this is for everyone. If you were into what the majority of Kid Rock did with more his hard rock and rap stuff, then you'll probably won't like this. If you really listen to it though, the music is good and has an old school sound with more of a blues and country sound, and i think from start to finish is an excellent album; there's only one song (Rock On) that i wasn't into. The only thing negative about this album is it doesn't really have a hit song on here that just sticks out (such as Amen & All Summer Long on his last album), but when looking at is as a whole, i think it is one of his best albums he's done.
B0041KKYEM|5.0|Ok the movie is certainly a masterpiece, but it was also very disturbing at most scenes. This fact is actually good, because it gets the viewer inside the mind of psychologically disturbed people. This movie is about a psychotic ballerina, and it certainly got the viewer acquainted with her hurt and struggle. Just being able to make the viewer lose knowing the difference between dream and reality in the movie explains why this movie is a masterpiece, because it got you extremely acquainted with the star of the movie, a psychotic ballerina.    This could be Natalie Portman's best performance till date, her performance in this film was simply breath taking.
B000R7I3LY|5.0|'Little Voice', released in 2007, apparently contains her 'greatest hit' to date w/'Love Song'. Her music, delivery, lyric is all hers...a jazz/pop rock/vocalist cross that didn't win acolades from her recording label. Background suggests she wrote 'Love Song' in response to the company demanding a love ballad. Listen to the lyric. I bought this and 'Kaleidoscope Heart', via Amazon for all my dearest friends. She's changed my life. The woman is playing the Iowa State Fair in August 2011. Being a native, I hate August in Iowa.  She's definitely paying her dues. A true music lover, would listen to one song, any song. You'll know the talent when you hear it.

It was exactly what I needed to read at the time to better understand how I can create an environment for success for our team, become more productive in my interactions, and get better at lifting people's spirits around me.    Definitely a must read for anyone whose career requires persuasive communication, leadership and helping others succeed.    Laura @Pistachio Fitton  CEO/Founder oneforty.com
B004FGN3WC|5.0|The alien movies are well known and liked by cinephiles. Their Blu-Ray convertion is astounishing and has a great sound and image, there are plenty of extras to keep you interested for a while and the presentation is great.    Even so, the best of THIS VERSION is the packaging. If you are a collector, it is a must have. The quality of the materials is good enough to deserve a central position on my collection.    If you are not a collector, and only want the movies and not a piece of decoration, the Alien Anthology is the next best thing.
B0042EJD8A|5.0|A disturbing look at how American corporations and elected officials expect people to just \\"accept\\" what they say as the truth and not take a stand against Big Brother.  Oil and gas companies are drilling for trillions (That's right, trillions) of gallons of natural gas every day. Yes people, let's all ignore the human beings that are getting sick, dying animals, polluted streams and the 596 chemicals used at each drilling site, 100's of 1,000's of drilling sites every day.  Let's ignore all of this and go to sleep each night and \\"act\\" like nothing is wrong.  The American Indians were killed off and ignored and now the same thing is happening to us by these corporations.  What can we do? We can be informed. We can open our minds and accept that these people are at a total loss of normal life.  We can try to get others to watch this documentary and we can only hope that Josh Fox has changed our souls for the better. Just be aware, not just an ostrich bird with your head in the sand. Stand up for something you believe in.
B0041KKYEM|5.0|Although people pooh-pooh the \\"nasty\\" lesbian sex scene, the [...] and the coming on of the instructor, people need to look past their prudent nature at the beauty of this film. As someone who danced for 9 years at an impressionable age (2 to 11) I really related to this movie and it was eerie to be able to hum along with the music, recognize some of the dancing and even recognize the techniques of prepping the ballet shoes, considering the dark nature of the film. I wish this movie's take on swan lake was a real ballet performance! It's story line is so gripping, heart renching and relatable to even non dancers, the costumes, dancing and filmography are breathtaking and it's a breath of fresh air to see a movie that is unafraid to push the boundaries and one that is so original.
B001IF5YLQ|3.0|Before ordering this item, be aware that you may receive a cheap fake instead of the real deal. The \\"Apple\\" adapter I received could pass for genuine at first glance, but it didn't attach correctly-- one of the screw holes was too deeply recessed. Taking a closer look at the thing, the signs of a knockoff became obvious-- the markings were off, the dimensions were off, and the build was generally chintzy. A side-by-side comparison with the genuine article was pretty laughable. There may be authentic Apple adapters available from some of these third-party sellers, but why chance it? If you're willing to pay for Apple quality, buy from Apple.    That said, the genuine item (purchased from the Apple Store) works as advertised.
B004DMNT2W|4.0|Though designed for a more traditional video camera ( perfect fit for my JVC Everio..) , I have found this roomy, high quality case to be the new best friend for a Flip, Vado or Kodak pocket cams.    They all have extra cables, some have chargers, some extra battery packs - so the space is most welcome. I dont know about you, but a busy lifestyle/job/family can sometimes cause things to be lost, or misplaced.  I like this bag because it is NOT a super snug fit, where you are forced to jam things in, and cause damage. Plenty of cushioned room with this one.    The style and build is impressive, similar in some ways to high-quality luggage. I would imagine this to be a great gift - too frequently, a camera without a case is used a few times, and then returns to it's box. Forever.  Don't let that happen!

B001E45XT4|4.0|Picked these up a month or so ago since my roomates and voice-chat buddies got tired of my speakers, heh. They're not the BEST headphones I've ever owned as the volume control doesn't seem to scale linearly as the knob would indicate: 1 - 20%, 2 - 40%, 3 - 60%, etc., but ends up being more like 1 - 0%, 2 - 50%, 3 - 90%, then between 4 and 5 is a negligible difference. The sound QUALITY is just fine for the price, for sure, but the bass is somewhat lacking, even if you use audio enhancements/equalizers to boost the ratio, it still doesn't come through very cleanly.    Most of the issues with my past expensive headphones has been the quality of the build, and how quickly they break. These things are built solid, probably the sturdiest Plantronics set I've ever owned. THICK cable to and from the computer, and the volume/mic control housing is built like a brick shithouse so if you're like me you can fidget with it all day/night.    As far as comfort goes, the padding is extraordinary. Be warned though if you have an exceedingly large head. I'm 6'2\\" with one of those fat baby heads so after a few hours of wearing these I can feel the pressure a little strongly. All it takes is some readjustment.    Again, can't really be beat for how much you're spending on them, if you're getting that $25 sale price. For $60, this would have an entirely different tone. :)
B000002LCX|5.0|Released in 1987, Strangeways, Here We Come was the fourth and final album by The Smiths after debuting with their self titled album only 3 years previously. Singer/lyricist Morrissey, guitarist Johnny Marr, bassist Andy Rourke, and drummer Mike Joyce consider it the best Smiths album, but fans tend to rank it as a lesser effort. Their output of only four albums is so staggeringly good that it's hard to rank one as better than the other, but Strangeways, Here We Come is a great album that has all the elements of The Smiths that made them a great band, but also showed them moving away from the sound of the previous albums. I may have a bit of a bias, as The Smiths are my favorite band, but there's not a weak track on this album:    1. A Rush and a Push and the Land is Ours-5/5-Immediately shows a different side of the band, being piano-driven with little or no guitar.     2. I Started Something I Couldn't Finish-5/5-Morrissey gets a bit experimental with his vocals briefly, but it's a great, very catchy track.    3. Death of a Disco Dancer-5/5-With an ominous bassline, Death of a Disco Dancer is one of The Smiths' most beautiful moments as a band and one of Morrissey's most beautiful moments as a vocalist: \\"And if you think peace is a common goal/That goes to show/How little you know.\\"    4. Girlfriend in a Coma-5/5-A brilliant pop song with wonderfully ambiguous lyrics and lovely string arrangements.    5. Stop Me If You Think You've Heard This One Before-5/5-One of my favorite Smiths songs. Well-written, well-performed, endlessly catchy. I've listened to this song well over a hundred times and it still hasn't grown old.    6. Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Loved Me-5/5-With a 2-minute intro on piano, this song explodes into a beautiful portrait of loneliness and longing.    7. Unhappy Birthday-5/5-Bitingly witty, brilliant lyrics. A great song that's hard not to like. The idea sounds corny, but Morrissey elevates the lyrics to a flawless realm of hilarity and poignancy.    8. Paint a Vulgar Picture-5/5-A marvelous indictment of record company politics. Ironically, Morrissey's solo records have gone through much of what he sings about here. One of the band's finest moments, lyrically and musically.    9. Death at One's Elbow-5/5-The shortest song on the record at just about 2 minutes. Reminiscent of Vicar in a Tutu musically, but a whole lot better; It's a great track, although it sounds as if it could've been left off of The Queen is Dead or Meat is Murder.    10. I Won't Share You-5/5-I used the lyric \\"Life tends to come and go/That's OK, as long as you know\\" as my senior quote. This song is a grower. It remains my least favorite track on the album, but it's still a great song and, in a way, being the last Smiths song, it's rather poignant.    I love all four of The Smiths studio albums so much that choosing one over the other is nearly impossible, so I can't say that this album is better or worse than the other three. What I can tell you is that I grow to like this album more and more with each additional listen and if you love the band, I don't see how you can't love this album. While the sound of their previous albums isn't removed from this record, it is less prevalent with the band exploring more ways to express their musical creativity and, without ever sounding like an experimental album they created some absolutely beautiful songs. Whether you're a long-time fan, a new fan, or someone who has heard one song and wants to get acquainted with the group; you can use any of their four albums as a starting point.    GRADE: A
0446195529|2.0|It's unclear just why author Baldacci gave his hero John Carr the cover name of Oliver Stone; why not Stanley Kubrick or Steven Spielberg? Why not just good ol' Rambo, for surely we have here the model for Mr. Carr / Stone- an invincible multi-lingual  fighting machine with a traumatic past and a penchant for tending graves. A bit of nit-picking I suppose, but this novel goes from one extra-ordinary event to another, beginning with shots fired with abandon in a park opposite the White House to an explosion- and from there it's an increasing death count.     Acronyms abound from the mundane FBI, CIA, NIC and  MI-6 to the never explained BLOB (Big Lump Of BS?), all background to the preposterous notion that a retired Stone meets privately with the President, there  to be enlisted as a one-man strike force against a Russin-Mexican drug cartel that's about to take over most of the industrial world. Rambo redux.     That mission is put on hold as, minutes later an explosion rocks Lafayette Park across the road from the White House. We now move on to the even more ridiculous notion that Russia is plotting a shattering event akin to 9/11. So much for the drug cartel problem; not such a big problem after all as Rambo-Stone takes on the entire US intelligence structure in a tortured expose of intra-departmental betrayal and turf wars. That part at least, is somewhat believable.    In this pile of tripe Mr. Baldacci has used up all the question marks on his word processor and then some, for page after page consists of \\"Why?\\" and \\"Who?\\", all  asked by assumedly experienced agents of various intelligence agencies from MI-6 to the aforementioned alphabet soup; all of course are answered or deftly deflected by our intrepid hero who passes along answers with the speed of sap running from the maple tree in the park which was blown up around page 16.    In the end there's increasingly far-fetched scenarios, more killings, explosions and mayhem; incidentally we never do find out whythe Camel Club bears that name or even how it came about (It may be described in earlier novels, but  so what?).    Give thanks for libraries; if I'd bought this mess I'd be looking in the mirror and wondering how I became so wealthy I could afford to squander my precious dollars and still not know just what the hell BLOB stands for. Hell's Corner stretches one's imagination to the point of wondering when - not how or where- this silliness will end.
B0012GMW3Y|3.0|I am a sucker for guitar-based 60s music with any zing at all, but this Lp is an awkward production by a band in disarray, and it may be the most overrated 60s rock'n'roll record on Amazon. It is not a pop classic in the way the Byrds' first few albums are, nor compellingly played in the way a later work like \\"Untitled\\" is. Save \\"Change is Now,\\" a strong hook from this record is nearly impossible to name.   And let us be plain, despite unaccountable superlatives dished out in reviews here like free seconds at an overeager café: the \\"Notorious Byrd Brothers\\" isn't in the same zip-code, county, or atmospheric layer with the first two Buffalo Springfield albums, let alone \\"Revolver\\" or \\"Pepper.\\" This record's true peers are the Chocolate Watchband's entries in the \\"Garage Psychedelia with Orchestral Garnish\\" menu.   In spite of fine bassist Chris Hillman, a swingless \\"I-don't-wanna-go-to-school\\" quality is to the fore here; arrangements include horns (\\"Artificial Energy\\") and moog (\\"Space Odyssey\\") employed with trendy, cosmetic impulses, not creative conviction. Even \\"Change is Now,\\" probably the best song here, is indifferently played. This Lp often sounds like a demo (as the bonus track demos attest), and much better Byrds' efforts exist on either side of \\"The Notorious Byrd Brothers'\\" odd moment, which was the turn of 1968. Curious cats indifferent to rhythm will still be fascinated, as reviews here attest, but if one is in search of a Byrds' equivalent of \\"Strawberry Fields,\\" or even lush, hook-laden tunes like the Byrds' \\"Feel a Whole Lot Better\\" or \\"8 Miles High,\\" be wary.

0740748475|5.0|I got this set as a birthday gift, and the first thing that everybody notces is that it's friggin' heavy!  The three books are bound in very heavy cover stock and printed on gallery weight paper - making it a durable and high quality printing.    Contained within the pages of this tome is every single C&H comic printed, ever, in order, and with the dates provided at the bottom of each page for reference.  Also included is a foreword written by the elusive Bill Watterson, which details how the whole thing came about, and why he chose to end it like that.  It's all good.    Bottom line.  Huge books, High quality, and we already know the content is awesome. Well worth the money.    -RJ

B002AT4K9G|5.0|The part 1 and part 2 were good, then part 3 was ok but 4 was also good. There is a little confusion though, part 3 (Tokyo Drift) came out before part 4 but it should have been the other way around (you will see what I mean if you watch them both). The actors are the same in part 1, 2 and 4 but not 3??? Also a character dies in part 3 but then is in part 4, that was stupid?
B0000CD5FN|5.0|Joe Strummer never got the respect or recognition he deserved.  And considering how he was held in such high esteem by fellow musicians and critics, that's saying something.<br /><br />It isn't too much a stretch to say that Joe Strummer was one of the key figures in fusing disparate music styles, helping speed the evolution from segregated genres to the hyphenated styles we have today.  If it weren't for The Clash's (at the time) revolutionary integration of reggae/african rhythms with guitar-based rock in Sandinista, bands like Rage Against the Machine or Limp Bizkit wouldn't have found the balls to fuse hip-hop & rap with screaming guitar and face-melting rock.<br /><br />Joe continued to blend music with The Mescaleros, and albums like Rock Art & the X-Ray Style and Global A Go-Go are direct predecessors to the sort of \\"intellectual elite\\" music now favored by hipsters and trendoids.  Yet for all their pretentions, the current bands cranking out embarrassingly ponderous music aren't able to reach the level Joe Strummer could.<br /><br />This dedication to exloring world music makes the songs on Streetcore even more poignant, since it marks a return to the basic elements of good and pure rock & roll.  Streetcore is the most \\"rock\\" album Joe has done since his apex on London Calling, and some of the songs on Streetcore nearly reach those lofty heights.<br /><br />This u-turn back to rock makes perfect sense.  Having spent the better part of 20 years sniffing around almost every other possible musical style, returning to guitars is just the circle closing.  Unfortunately, we'll never know whether this was just Joe coming back to his roots to rejuvenate himself, or if he was going to delve deeper into the origins of rock - rockabilly, blues, and old-school r&b.<br /><br />In a sense, Streetcore is an ideal end to Joe's career.  He started as a rocker, and ended the same way.  And the album itself ends very fittingly.  After the last notes of the last song fade into silence, we hear Joe saying, \\"That's a take.\\"<br /><br />RIP, Joe.ake.\\"    RIP, Joe.
1563894696|5.0|I love comic books, but I don't ever seem to indulge in them as often as I'd like. Films were my first love, and then novels. Short fiction and comics came much later -- recently, even -- when the urges to become a better writer and artist struck me hard in my second year of college.    Yesterday I finished Jeph Loeb's Batman: The Long Halloween, and it has rekindled my love of graphic novels. Months ago, I read The Killing Joke, Cacophony, Batman R.I.P., and several others. Then I bought The Watchman and V for Vendetta -- already two of my all-time favorite films -- and, for some damn reason, never read them.    So I'm finally getting to that.    The artwork by Tim Sale was one of the big highlights for me. The Long Halloween is reminiscent of darker stuff, like The Killing Joke or Watchmen, but with a very distinctive style that I really appreciate as an artist. The level of detail, line quality, and draftsmanship is friggin' stunning. Joker's teeth, and Two-Face's acid burn scars, are pretty frightening.    The color work is pretty recognizable as being typical of the mid-90s process, and adds beauty to Sale's already-great drawings.    As for the story, it's clear that the book -- no secret, from what I'm told -- was a huge influence on the Christopher Nolan films Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. Both Carmine \\"The Roman\\" Falcone and Salvatore \\"The Boss\\" Maroni are key players in the Gotham City underworld of organized crime and corruption; each of these guys were instrumental figures in the plots of both of Nolan's movies.    Harvey Dent's campaign against the mob and subsequent tragic fall into villainy as the murderous Two-Face is also a key plot point for the graphic novel -- one that is well played out, and reminiscent of both Joel Schumacher's infamous Batman Forever and The Dark Knight. In light of this focus, the Joker plays a far less important role in the comic, but is nevertheless present throughout the story, along with Mad Hatter, Riddler, SolomonGrundy, Catwoman, and Poison Ivy.    The great mystery driving the plot is that of the so-called \\"Holiday Killer,\\" a shooter who begins hunting down members of the Falcone crime family starting with Halloween and continuing on with a significant murder taking place on each big holiday of the calender year.    The revealing of evidence, suspicions, and character motivations have the reader guessing right along with Batman the whole time, and even by the end only the reader is fully aware of the Holiday Killer's true identity. One of the best endings I've ever seen in a comic book, and perhaps the best story in the entire Batman mythos.    If someone asked me to recommend them one comic book/graphic novel from the ones I've read, I would recommend they read The Long Halloween. Expect more comic book-related geekouts in the near future.

B002BNKQDK|4.0|I won't review the movie here as that's done by many on this product as well as the 2-disc version. Needless to say the pictures and audio are quite good. The director cut makes the movie approximately 3 hours long!    The Nite Owl ship has a rustic color which mimics the ship in the movie well. Once the battery is installed, one can depress on the big round hatch on the top of the ship. The sound of the ship taking off will be played, and the lights stay on for a while. The front view has three vertical round white lights, and 2 pairs of white round lights beneath each eye-shaped windows. The bottom lights are blue in accent, reflecting on the white crystal (snow?)    The digital copy expired for me (at the time of my purchase in late November, 2010).    If you are a fan, then this collector's item maybe worth getting. The ship is a standout and great to show case. Also great to put in bedroom in place of other night lights. The whole thing weights about 1.5lbs (24oz). It's about 9 inches long, 6 inches wide, and 6.5 inches tall.

B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|Acclaimed director Frank Darabont (The Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile) has seemingly done the impossible by taking zombies, probably the least television-friendly genre, and has brought them shambling to the small screen with The Walking Dead, adapted from the comic book series written by Robert Kirkman.     Deputy sheriff Rick Grimes is gunned down after a high-speed chase on the highways of Georgia and ends up comatose. But Rick's nightmare truly begins when he wakes up to find the dead have come back to life to feast upon the living. He sets out to find his wife and son, whom he believes have abandoned their homes for safer shelter and could still be alive. He ventures to Atlanta to find it overrun by \\"walkers,\\" and only manages to make it out alive with the aid of a handful of survivors who have set up camp in the hills outside of town. Rick joins the group as they struggle to survive zombie attacks, internal conflicts within the group, and a journey to the CDC in search of a cure, answers, or just hope in a future where the likelihood of living much longer is incredibly slim.    Darabont sets a measured, cinematic pace, so nothing in the show feels rushed for the sake of fitting the hourlong timeslot. The show certainly doesn't skimp on production value either, as we get to see all the guts and gore (and even the occasional profanity) that is inherent in the zombie genre. Thankfully, cable channel AMC, producers of shows like Mad Men and Breaking Bad, allows its shows to push the envelope with its content, because if The Walking Dead had been produced by one of the more conservative broadcast channels, then the show probably would not have turned out as fantastic as it did. We also get to see broad cityscapes ravaged by the fall of society, and it's pretty remarkable that any major city would let a production of any kind take over its streets the way The Walking Dead does with Atlanta.     But the element that makes the show truly shine is the human element. It isn't a show merely about zombies, its about the struggles of those left standing after the world ends. The title \\"The Walking Dead\\" describes the zombies who have overrun the planet, but it also describes Rick and the other survivors and the almost hopeless nature of their situation. They might survive the hoards of undead now, but for how long? Is there any point of holding out hope when it seems almost futile to try in a world where falling prey to the flesh-eating masses seems inevitable?    The Walking Dead may be a television series, but it has the look and feel of a big-budget zombie film, and it was easily the best new series of 2010.    This two-disc Blu-Ray set includes all of Season 1's episodes as well as behind-the-scenes and \\"Making Of\\" docs as well as a fun little tutorial about doing your own zombie make-up by Greg Nicotero of the Oscar-winning special effects group KNB EFX.
0307272702|5.0|A few years ago I read Taubes' Good Calories Bad Calories and it changed my life.  Since then I've lost 146 lbs and am immensely healthier in ways I never expected.  That book was a tough read but well worth my time.    Why We Get Fat is a great mass-market follow up to GCBC.  It's more accessible to non-scientists, it's a bit more engaging, and it does a great job focusing in on the key concepts.  And the best part was that I was able to get through WWGF in a few days as opposed to a few months for GCBC.      The science is clear and it's worked wonders for me and many others.  Why We Get Fat is a critically important book that can also change YOUR life for the better.
B0039TD7RC|1.0|Exile on Main Street is really one of my favorite albums ever. I still keep the original, great sounding 1972 LP, and have the 90's pretty fairly remastered CD. So today I got this new deluxe CD edition as a gift.<br />Well, the sound on CD 1 (original album) is very loud, suddenly there's all these instruments brought up by compression, I don't see any point in doing this. Can anyone call that an improvement?<br />So I try CD 2 (bonus tracks). The first song, \\"Pass the Wine\\", is a good song, and the polished sound looks nice.<br />But then... the second song, \\"Plundered My Soul\\" has drums and vocals sounding too much like Bridges to Babylon ... 3rd song: same thing ... strange. Then it gets worse. The next two songs, \\"Following the River\\" and \\"Dancing in the Light\\" could be on this bad Jagger solo album (how was it called? Goddess in the Doorway? I don't have it anymore). Wait, wasn't this supposed to be a bonus CD from Exile on Main Street? What about alternate takes from the original sessions? What are these newly added Jagger vocals, this drums sound? Perfect backing vocals? Something must be wrong. Let's see what the booklet tells me: Lisa Fisher, Cindy Mizelle. Stones' latest tours backing vocalists... this is starting to smell. Then I look to see who is credited as playing bass on the \\"new\\" songs. Daryl Jones? No, Bill Wyman! ON ALL SONGS - CD 1 and 2!!!!!!!! So I look for my auld LP, and someone else (Mick Taylor, Keith Richards, Bill Plummer) is credited as the bass player on 10 from the 18 original songs! Couldn't these people be kind enough to credit stuff correctly? What and when additional music was added? We are talking about a deluxe edition of a VERY important record!<br />If you are looking for a decent copy of this amazing album please go for the 1994 remaster, keep away from this mess.
B0015DROBO|4.0|The Girl WithThe Dragon Tattoo is incredible! It is a very intricate story of intrigue, a page turner of superior depth. You have to pay close  attention to the details while your reading or you will miss what is going on, and who is speaking, as it changes continuously!

Mr. Larsson did a very good job at painting the picture for the setting of this book. I couldn't put this book down, and ordered the second book of the trilogy as soon as I finished the first. ( I wanted to state that I read the kindle version of this book, so that is what this review is based on.) With all this said, here are a few negatives...it isn't for the faint hearted as there are some definitely dark, deviant sexual themes involved. There is definitely some \\" vigilante\\" behavior in our \\" hero\\" character, Lisbeth, though when it happens I actually felt like cheering her on. There were several strings left dangling at the end of the book, and I'm hoping that they will be tied up in the second book of this trilogy.
B002WOZKY8|2.0|well the singing sensation justin beiber has done it again, made another track!and this time....what were you expecting? i bet u werent expecting .... haha i did that because justin beiber IS ....     oooo hoooo woahoooah, \\"baby\\" probably one of the worst songs in existince!!!!! the melody is all over the place, the tempo is to fast, and the song, to me frankly, its not my favorite.... i bet if i played on a boat in the ocan, dead fish would rise to the surface! i will never say never,i will fight 'till forever? ummm, yeah great influence, one of my friends moms clients daughter approached JB in the streets and asked for his autograph, justin beiber says \\"im not working right now\\"!? ummmm how bout not, i think justin beiber will become the new \\"Adam Lambert\\" for instance look at all of justin beibers pictures, in all of 'em hes always wearing makeup? and he did a reanactment of the famous youtube video \\"david after dentist\\" really? you wanna copy a little kid on medication? just stop singing! it will be best for EVERYONE!
B0018OAPAW|4.0|I really liked this album. The only problem with it is that it really gets your hopes up with the first few songs then it crashes them into the ground. But even though this is true it still has enough good songs to make the album enjoyable. My favorite song on this album is Your Gunna Go Far Kid but thats probably only because most of the other songs arent very good. I think that The Off Spring absolutly could have done a better job on this abum in particular. They could have made better songs to begin with and they also could have put better songs in the album.                By:Ryan
B003U0AHBO|1.0|I could not stand the constant 5 second editing that existed soley for the purpose of disguising the fact that 90% of this movie was \\"filmed\\" on a computer.
1423101502|5.0|While lacking the creativity of Harry Potter and the humor of \\"Carlyle or The Year of the Dragon\\", The Last Olympian is intensely entertaining.  It is an action-packed story of mythical beings striving with Our Heroes for New York.  Much of the characterization and interpersonal dynamics owe a lot to Harry Potter, and of course the family squabbles among the Olympians are based, loosely, on Greek mythology, proving once again that there is nothing new under the sun (or Helios, if you prefer).  But fun is fun and The Last Olympian has a lot of it to offer.
B004CHURRS|5.0|I bought this about a month ago and have been listening to is consistently since then. It is, simply, delightful. Dessay's voice is so lovely, so limpid, yet so brilliant at the same time that she makes a perfect Cleopatra. In my experience, only Beverly Sills equals her and Sills did not record all of the arias. Dessay's ornamentation is especially unique and wonderful, suprising and satisfying.<br /><br />I suppose my only criticisms of the album are that Haim's conducting is a bit fast and hectic at times and that \\"Non disperar\\", Cleopatra's taunting aria sung to her brother Tolomeo (which does so much to establish her character at her first entrance) is not included.

B0018CMJSU|5.0|This movie takes you behind the fact of murder & mayhem of the mob, but into their family lives; how close knit they are as a whole.  James Caan, Al Pacino (especially Al) , Robert DeNero & yes even Marlon Brando are at their best as father & sons. It's strange out the father came to America to get away from 'mob crime bosses' and actually ended up in that situation again, trying to survive and still have a family life.  A wonderful set!

B003EYVXTG|1.0|While I have ordered and received some very good products from Amazon, this DVD goes lacking.  I am NOT referring to the story; I am very glad to see the movie as I lived in Branson MO, which is in the Ozarks, and went to High School there so you can see I had a personal interest in this story as I had never heard of these types of things going on in MO and sure they did not, back in the 1950's.  However, my complaint is with the quality of the DVD...at a very important place in the movie, the DVD was totally not visible but for some very mixed up scenes...little squares across the picture and etc.  I've really not known how to get in touch with you and thought I would watch it again one day to see if it was a good quality DVD.  It breaks my heart as I could not see the part of the movie where they went on the lake and no telling how much more.  My DVD player has no problem playing perfectly many other DVD's so it is NOT my player.  Also I checked the DVD itself and found no scratches or dust on it so what in the world is this defective DVD doing on the market??????  I hope to hear from you and would appreciate a Pre-paid label to return this one to you.  I am a Widow on a fixed income and love the books and DVD's I've previously ordered from you but this has been a Big Surprise with a Bad ending. I have always recommended Amazon over Deep Discount and other places to buy books and DVD's. Pls contact me.  thank you, peggy westmoreland neal
B003TSEL7S|5.0|this book is full of adventure. again rick has made us wait and wanting more. i'm just as exited to read this as i am the 4th eragon book. Rick Riordan has made this epic new series along with makingthe kane chronicals. if u read the kane cronicals and loved that wait till u read this!!!
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I love the book and have never liked a single movie adaptation of it until this one. I love it! They have amazing chemistry and Toby Stephens is brilliant as the taciturn Rochester. Buy it, you won't regret it! BMT once again proves that they are the best at this kind of thing.
B002BSHWUU|2.0|I was disappointed in these CD's. The stereo separation is so extreme that in many cases you cannot get the sounds of the musicians to meet in the middle, to blend. And if you set the balance in the middle, on a few occasions, the music channeled to the left or right may be almost inaudible. Further, I find that when I have all of the equalizer controls (base, treble, etc.) adjusted so that one song sounds right, the next track requires a reset. Also, certain sounds I know and look for from the original music is lost, can hardly be heard. All in all, very disappointing. I am going to resell the Stereo Boxed set, buy the Mono set, and the individual original three CDs that the Mono set does not have.
0307408833|5.0|Love this book!!!    I'm confused after reading some other reviews though...  Everyone seems to be so upset that the book says it's \\"gluten-free\\", yet spelt flour is used in some recipes.  The cover of my book says, \\"Vegan, (Mostly) Gluten-Free, ....\\".  It clearly says to me that the recipes are \\"mostly\\" gluten-free, and I wouldn't expect them all to be.  Someone also mentioned the coconut oil, and not knowing how to use it...in the book Erin says you have to melt it before you measure it.  Also written, is that you need to measure all the ingredients using \\"dry\\" measuring cups (even the wet ingredients are measured this way).  If so many people mis-read the title, maybe they missed that information too, and that is why their baking didn't turn out so well?      Everything I've made so far has been great! I've tried the apple-cinnamon muffins, banana bread, apple-cinnamon toastie, brownies, chocolate chip cookies, and vanilla cupcakes.  The brownies and chocolate chip cookies were TO DIE FOR!  So good!  My apple-cinnamon toastie came out a little undone, and I had to cook it a lot longer...I know I totally overfilled the pan, and next time I won't, cause it was tasty!    I think that Erin did a great job with this book, and did explain in detail how to make the recipes come out.  You just can't miss reading anything!  The ingredients are expensive, but that's not her fault.  If eating vegan, and gluten-free is important to you..I would definitely buy this book. ( Even with the non-gluten-free recipes cause you could always change the flour, and the other recipes are totally worth it).  If you're just thinking about eating that way for health reasons, I would definitely buy this book cause cause everything has been so yummy.      Thank you to a friend of mine for giving me this book..I love it!
B0041KKYBA|5.0|I would give this movie 10 stars for importance to the viewing public!  A beautiful job of filming - doesn't drag at all and wasn't as depressing overall - but it will light a fire under you!! I am going to buy this for everyone I can afford to give it to.  A must see movie....Wish someone would start a MOVEMENT around it so we can get the message to President Obama and members of Congress etc.
B00007KWI9|3.0|Yes, were a very young inexperienced outfit at the time this album was recorded, but the virtuosity and extreme talent that these guys possessed was evident right from the get go.  The debut is far below the creative heights that the band would eventually reach, but the album is a very solid first effort that has held up well over the years.  The material is mostly original with the exception of two very unique covers of The Beatles \\"Every Little Thing\\" and The Byrds \\"I See You\\".  In tracks like \\"Harold Land\\" you begin to hear the birth of more epic works that Yes would take on later in their career.  This one is probably not essential for more casual fans of the band, but it is worth checking out if you already have most of the rest of the band's stuff.

B003V6L94Q|5.0|For me, music is all about the harmonies. For the past many years much of the music that I have added to my collection has been from female artists; they have caught my ear and need for the harmony thing..... until Zac and his boys came along. TIGHT, TIGHT, TIGHT harmonies-- I LOVE it! Is there a specific cut that makes my day?? No, because they all grow on you after a fashion. It is good to finally be able to add a male artist to my collection; it has been too long!    You Get What You Give is a marvelous piece. These guys only get BETTER!

B004H4XI5O|5.0|What a fun book to read on a non-fiction subject. Foer is a very good writer. He maintained a good perspective on a historically overblown topic. He made an honest effort to find something relevant about improving ones memory but didn't ignore the obvious issue that remembering does not necessarily have value unless you can make something of it. Memorizing random numbers and decks of cards is quite useless. Remembering poetry and language and history and books and people/numbers/addresses, among other real world things, have a practical aspect. I could never force myself to memorize digits of pi or random numbers or decks of cards. Honestly. How drab. And the Europeans are so good at it. Now why does that sound ridiculous to me? I had to laugh at this. Honestly. Why would the Germans or Brits be so proud of memorizing decks of cards? It's like Europe is in the twilight zone. Would you like to know the 42nd card in this shuffled deck? No sir, I would not care to know, but thanks for asking. But if you could tell me what Pope Paul said in his last public outing, I might find an interest there. So grains of salt make a weak pillar, and Foer didn't miss that point. And I know you won't get this kind of reality in most books on memory. Foer has some journalistic integrity, so I look forward to seeing him apply himself to other interesting topics. And what an interesting and entertaining crowd of characters are in these Memory Athlete Events. This Buzan character is quite a fascinating study. And Ed is such an enthusiast. They kind of have this geeky cute quality. I hope they do come up with something truly useful. I hope that sincerely.
0307460444|4.0|I've owned the book for a little over a year now and I love it. By nature I'm a cook and not a baker.  When I started baking it was to teach myself to follow recipe's (this is not how I cook)  I read a lot of reviews of this book before writing my review because I wanted to address a few things.     I have to say that while I agree that many of her cupcake recipe's come out a bit too dense for my personal liking that can be easily fixed with just a bit less flour.      Her frosting recipe's are an entirely different story. Following the recipe in Martha's cookbook for a basic buttercream, as well as her swiss merangue buttercream (vanilla and chocolate) went extremely well.  I was so pleased that I tried her rich chocolate frosting, this frosting came out a bit dense and too bitter for my liking however I don't like every recipe in any cookbook so I applied some of my cooking skills and tried again.  Decreasing the amount of dark/unsweetened chocolate in the recipe and adding some milk chocolate and then adjusting to taste and personal texture desire.  It came out much better the 2nd time.      Frosting preferences vary GREATLY from person to person, I don't know any baker who doesn't have their own little tricks for making the frosting just the way they want it.  It's part of what makes so many types of bakeries and recipes successful. This is a great book, just don't be afraid to make a recipe your own.  If you want more flavor, add more spices, if you want a frosting creamier, use a combination of shortning and butter or add less sugar or less chocolate.    Bottom Line: This is a great cookbook to guide you, it has amazing and fun decorating ideas, and can get anyone started.
0446691437|5.0|If you depend on creativity (whether in a literal or figurative sense) to earn a living, do yourself a favor and read this book. It's an excellent, common-sense guide to beating the demons of procrastination and inert thinking/activity and finally GET IT DONE (whatever IT may be for you).     I read it for the first time years ago when I went from a full time job in graphic arts to owning my own studio. As a person who has always struggled with mental blocks, putting things off, and other self defeating behaviors, it really opened my eyes. I've found it to be immensely helpful - it is on my most-used bookshelf...I refer to it frequently when I need a little kick in the pants to get moving. It has literally been an indispensable tool to helping me succeed at something I had major doubts and fears about doing initially. I came away from it with a totally different attitude and applied the practical knowledge in it right away. The book is pretty short but extremely empowering. The writing style is a little...\\"non exciting\\" for lack of a better term, but don't let that discourage you...the information you glean from it is well worth it.
B0043RSJ8G|4.0|Jodi Picoult is known for writing novels dealing with controversial subjects that just poke and prod at the reader. Usually by the time I finish one of her books I feel like I have been run through the ringer, which actually is a very good thing. If you are looking for a comfortable, relaxing novel to pick up when needing to unwind, you need to skip this author - she keeps me reading way too late into the night !<br /><br />I think this may be her most controversial work to date. Dealing with an infertile couple trying to conceive via IVF, she does a fabulous job at helping us understand the emotional and physical toil it takes on the prospective parents. The main story follows this couple throughout the period of their attempts to get pregnant and shows what it does to their relationship as well as the relationships they have with their families and friends. The main character of the novel, Zoe, is the wife in this marriage which finally ends in divorce. When Zoe ends up finding herself wanting more than friendship from her good friend, Vanessa, the book embarks on gay relationships, gay rights, and the people opposed to such. What to do with the frozen embryos creates tension and drama throughout the remainder of the narrative.<br /><br />My only real complaint is that the author's opinion on the matter is very apparent from the beginning. The characterizations of the people involved on the side the author believes is wrong are pretty strong and stereotypical. The \\"good\\" side, while having some aspects of character which are less than stellar, are largely good-hearted people that make the reader want to cheer them on. Basically, I felt manipulated as a reader --- I was not so subtly led down the path to the conclusion that author wanted (and I don't like feeling manipulated). This is what lowered the book to a 4-star rating for me.<br /><br />Overall, a great piece of writing that brings the reader right into the lives of the characters. A thought-provoking read but you must understand the topic and that there is a pro-gay opinion on the part of the author.ut you must understand the topic and that there is a pro-gay opinion on the part of the author.
B004LGPBZI|3.0|Some would argue that drugs enhance the creative process and that artists, once sober, often see a decline in their innovative energy. Take, for instance, Aerosmith, a band whose work was considered more passionate during its drug-induced years. Of course, this says nothing about the brilliant artists that the world has lost too early because of substance abuse, but the point is nonetheless an interesting course of debate.    Oasis' \\"drug\\" of choice has always been the friction between brothers Noel and Liam Gallagher (coupled, most likely, with a heavy dose of alcohol). If this conflict is removed, much like an artist going to rehab, is the band's music still powerful?    Beady Eye's debut album partially answers this question. The band is essentially Oasis sans Noel Gallagher, who left the group in 2009 after yet another heated argument with his brother. This came on the heels of one of the band's strongest albums to date, \\"Dig Out Your Soul.\\" Was this album enhanced by the conflict between the Gallagher brothers? I would argue yes.    By contrast, Beady Eye's debut album is competent but lacking something -- perhaps the abrasion between Noel and Liam that forced Oasis to create great music. The Beatles influence is there, and \\"Four Letter Word\\" is a good single, but some ephemeral greatness is absent. A friend summarized this void perfectly: Beady Eye lacks the soul that Oasis had.    There's no doubt that Liam is an accomplished musician with a strong career still ahead. But those pining for the days of \\"Morning Glory\\" had best look elsewhere.
B004289ZW0|5.0|Works as expected.  Battery outlasts that of iPad.  Does not attach to iPad in any physical way(read: no dongles to break off or wires to mess with)  Initial signal acquisition on cold start up is about 10 seconds which is silly fast.  Slide switch is a little odd at first but after a couple of times it becomes a non-issue.    The GPS performance is amazing. On a recent flight from White Plains, NY, I used three GPS devices in the cockpit: Garmin GNS 430W, Garmin 496 and the 5870+iPad. 496 took 20 minutes to find the signal, 430 and 5870 grabbed the signal in about the same amount of time. GNS 430 is a serious piece of avionics with a dedicated GPS antenna. To post performance equal that of a heavyweight like 430W is very impressive.
0385737424|1.0|This book should come with a warning: NOT FOR CHILDREN.  Do you really want your young kids reading about a single mom who keeps stealing items from her workplace? The word 'swiped' is used to describe the first three or four thefts, after that the word 'steal' is used. That's better, let's call it what it is in case any young readers don't realize that 'swiped' means an actual theft took place.    The mother thinks it is alright to steal, but that it is not alright to buy grapes because of the treatment of the grape pickers. What? How inconsistent is that?! Her fine morals rub off on her daughter as we read that her daughter \\"sneaks\\" some grapes from a grocery store. No matter, as long as you have a streak of 'social justice' in your veins, you can justify your own immoral behavior.    I could waste more of my good time in making a long, long list of offensive things in this book, but I won't. I quit reading this morally corrupt and uninteresting book halfway though it. But I felt that a review ought to be written for parents out there who might mistakenly think the Newberry Award on this book means the book has some merit. It does not.   Would you consider giving your child a bag of candy and sitting them in front of a degraded reality TV show?  Most parents would not. This book offers nothing better or worse than that. Not for kids.
B004I2K4DY|1.0|I caught the 25th Anniversary Concert of Les Mis on PBS. Each character and presentation was worse than the previous one. How bloody awful!    The 10th Anniversary cast and recording of Les Miserables in Concert is so inspiring - so perfect. Please opt for that one instead of this flat and insipid cast and production. There is absolutely nothing compelling in the 25th anniversary version.  I was sickened and could not stand watching anymore. EEWWHHH!    I had the good fortune to see the original Broadway production in NY.  Please, please seek out the 10th anniversary DVD and CD to get the truest experience of a wondrous and marvelous production. It was groundbreaking and continues to inspire.    The \\"modernized\\" 25th anniversary edition is just awful. Rather like the kids putting on a very amateur production in the back yard. But this lacks even that depth of feeling.    No soul. Just commercialized pablum. Horrible - 25th anniversary CD or DVD - avoid at all costs!

Seems most of this bonus footage and features were done in 2005, same as the ones on the single disc version but they just couldn't fit it all. Somehow, the movie looks even better. Also, I should mention, all the bonus features on the single disc are on this set as well.

B0036TGSR6|5.0|\\"The Ghost Writer\\" is the work of a true master. It is Roman Polanski's eighteenth film as a director, and it proves--if it needed further proving--that at age 77, he just as brilliant a filmmaker as he ever was. He has made one of his best films to date, a taut, pulse-pounding political thriller of Hitchcockian proportions that also contains echoes of his own films, particularly \\"Chinatown\\" and \\"Rosemary's Baby.\\"     Ewan McGregor plays a nameless man whose past is left a mystery. He is hired by a publisher to ghost write ex-British Prime Minister Adam Lang's (Pierce Brosnan) memoirs. The previous ghost, a long time aid to Lang, was found dead, washed up along the beach near Lang's beach house in Martha's Vineyard, his car still on the crossing ferry. It is assumed that he was either drowned accidentally or committed suicide, but Polanski lets us know in more ways than one that it will probably not be that simple. The sense of foreboding that the director creates forms its grip on us from the opening shot, and never lets go for a second.    Lang's beach house is a fortress of secrets surrounded by stormy, grey skies that constantly threaten to shed rain at any moment. The new ghost arrives and is welcomed by Lang's aid, Amelia (Kim Cattrall), who is also his mistress. This is no secret to Lang's wife, Ruth (Olivia Williams), a lonely but tough woman who is deeply detached from her husband.    Just as the new ghost arrives, Lang who comes under severe political attack over his loyalties to American foreign activities, including rendition and other war crimes. This leaves the ghost wondering gravely what he has gotten himself into, and if his predecessor's death was really just an accident, or something more sinister. Polanski gives us no reason to believe otherwise, and as the ghost becomes immersed in Lang's world of secrets, lies, deceit and CIA cover-ups, he realizes that his two-week deadline to finish Lang's memoirs is the very least of his concerns.    What istruly stunning about this film, aside from Polanski's sharp and menacing direction, is the amount of information that is retained from the audience. Even as the ghost unpeels the layers Lang's past, and slowly begins to understand what is going on, we are never quite certain about everything. In many cases in a film like this, the pieces are all there and it is our job and the protagonist's job to connect them. In \\"The Ghost Writer,\\" I think that Polanski and co-writer Robert Harris have deliberately chosen to withhold some pieces of the puzzle in order to generate the kind of doubt and anticipation that we experience throughout this film.    McGregor gives an excellent central performance as the new ghost trying to put together the events taking place, and his scenes with Williams, some of the more seemingly ambiguous scenes in the film, are wonderfully acted. This is also some of the best work that Brosnan has ever done, as the ex-PM who is attempting to both save his reputation and process his memoirs, while carefully trying to keep the truth submerged beneath what the people want to hear. He has only a few major scenes, but manages to communicate a lot in them.    Polanski also plays with modern technology, namely the GPS system, which is used in one brilliant scene where the ghost's predecessor communicates vital information to him from beyond the grave. In another scene, the ghost talks to an old man (Eli Wallach) who says that the current shouldn't have washed the former ghost up along the beach where it did, and that a key witness to it is in a coma. There is also an ingenious moment toward the end involving the passing of a note that keenly evokes Hitchcock.  These kinds of moments, which occur frequently through the film--in nearly every scene, in fact--allow the tension to build and build, until I could actually feel my heart racing.    The setting of the film also adds to the growing anticipation, and the ominous tone of the film, as the beach house where the ghost spends most of his time is cut off from the mainland. It is a hazy, cold, isolated, drizzly place where bad things are almost certainly bound to happen. \\"The Ghost Writer\\" is one of the most intensely crafted thrillers in recent years, as it blends classic Hitchcock themes with modern political allusions, while Polanski, I think, also manages to slip in some very personal incite into his own controversial situation with the law. It all adds up to a masterwork of the genre that perhaps offers us more questions than answers by the end, but that is all the more reason to watch it again.
B001MSMULG|3.0|This is my first read of a Silva book, and I can honestly say I enjoyed it. However I kept expecting the showdown between Gabe & Tariq. Even more incredible is the fact that Taliq, at the last minute, allows President Arafat to live. Also a former model, after escaping imprisonment and certain death, is the one who introduces Taliq to his maker. For me it was a poor ending to an otherwise great read. I'm not sure I'll go any further with the Allon series.
B0034G4P7G|4.0|I really enjoyed this film. In terms of action there's obviously not much, it's mostly dialogue, but the dialogue is of a very high standard and the acting is excellent, particularly from the guy who plays himself and his brother. I'm not sure how accurate the film is to real life events but it doesn't really matter. This is an engaging and interesting film about human interaction, the struggle for power and the effects on relationships when money becomes a huge issue.
B004Q3UL2O|5.0|There were so many things about this movie that did not ring true or seem believable.      Start with the parents of the main character, the father a doctor who teaches at a university, and his mother-hen-all-warm-and-endearing wife. In their somewhat drab dining room, having dinner with their grown kids. Almost screams, 'Poor but honest, human, down-to-earth.' In other words, 'Don't hate Dad because he's a doctor and rolling in money!'     Then there's the chubby son who supposedly is so smart that he made a killing in the field of technology. He's too dumb to put any money in the bank, so soon, we're seeing him, again, 'poor but honest and down-to-earth, with self-esteem issues, just like you and me!'     What crap.      After the titillation of lots of skin shown when Jake and Anne Hathaway have sex (that part is pretty believable), Jake's character, Jamie, who's supposed to be such an emotional clod that he talks over the live broadast of the towers falling on 9/11, Jake and Maggie (her character) get serious. It's really a very touching scene when he first admits that he loves her - that was worth watching for the acting and the message conveyed - but when he starts to focus on her disease, everything goes awry.     I'll skip all the things that happen and just say that it could have ended with the lovely emotional scene that seems to resolve many issues. I loved that scene. Then it was all ruined by a coda in which Jake tells us that he made a moral choice and applied to medical school.     ENNNGHHH! (sound of buzzer). Wrong thing to add to the movie. Jake's already admitted that he can't sit through classes, was aimless in college and dropped out. In the competitive world of medical admissions, even Dad (a university professor, remember) would have trouble getting a son who's decided he wants to be doctor now into medical school. A son who refers to himself as having ADD. And that is expected to wrap up all of the plot in a neat little bow so the happy couple retire healthy and wealthy (the understanding is that Maggie will then have her own live-in doctor watching the progress of her disease).     Without that stupid, cloying, and unbelievable ending, I was willing to overlook the 'poor but honest' facade presented by a family basically rolling in money, with plenty of options in life and lots of financial security, but living 'the simple (and drab) life' as if it was some political statement. But with that dumb ending, I can really only recommend skipping through the movie to the last 15 minutes. It's all you really need to see - the rest is purely contrived and not believable.
B003R0MEZ4|4.0|Spoiler Alert: There are casting changes which take place this season which were heavily reported online even before the season began.  If you missed those articles and also do not want to know who is being eliminated then do NOT read this review.<br /><br />CRIMINAL MINDS had protracted ways of getting rid of cast members this season.  When networks do this, the members leaving are not pulling in enough favorable ratings to make the network offer them lucrative staying options.  So the solution is to then get rid of those members.  Thus two female members of the team were given very plot heavy exits which went on and on over many episodes.  I could have completely done without this and found both stories boring as they were of little to no forensic interest.  It seems that CM knows which characters to keep for the long haul and those are all of the guys and Penelope, the computer whiz gal.  Anyone else who comes in may be there only a short while.  All of these \\"exiting cast member episodes\\" were barely watchable.  Ironically, if you are a really good looking person, you are almost certain toast for remaining in this show.  These actors who look like movie starlets are the ones being let go, not the ones who might pass as real FBI agents.  So I suppose that at least is refreshing.<br /><br />The other episodes were business as usual and delivered the same high quality law enforcement and forensic cases we've gotten used to over the past six years.  Perhaps my favorite one was a serial killer with Alzheimer's who has been \\"retired\\" for many years who comes out of retirement for one last killing spree.  That was a very unique episode.  When the show sticks with the team flying off to go help local law enforcement solve a very complex murder case, the show is first rate.<br /><br />So I hope this season sees the end of the musical chairs.  There is a British show called MI-5 about UK spies.  Whenever a cast member leaves that show, typically the cast member is just blown up in one episode and that is that.  It is a bit jarring but I will take that approach rather than these protracted leavings.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B002BU0DPE|4.0|I bought these for my PC and my 360...odd, I know, considering they are designed with a PS3 in mind. The reason I went with these is because they have a quite a few features that you can't get with the XBOX headset from Turtle Beach at this price point (the X11's). They specifically state that they will work fine with a PC and with and Xbox, so these were right up my alley.    The sound is amazing. I'm upgrading from a pair of Plantronics PC headphones that I had requisitioned for the task of PC/Xbox headphone, and these blow those out of the water as far as game sound goes. Everything is much more clear, and I can hear things I couldn't on other headphones...the first game of Reach I played, I could hear an opponent attempting to assassinate me and missing (I could hear him swing his arm...).     As far as comfort...they aren't perfect, but for the price....they're good. If you want something you're not going to notice, the price goes up fast. The comfortable headphones start at 200 bucks. If you don't have that to spend, and you aren't going to be wearing these all the time, these will do nicely. I wouldn't recommend them to someone who spends 8 hours a day gaming, but for the casual gamer who wants to get the most out of game-time, these are great no matter what system you are using.    I would add that one thing I particularly like is the chat-monitoring. Hearing your own voice means you aren't yelling into the mic as much. I know these aren't the only TB headsets that have that feature, but it's something I won't be going without after having these ones.

0307593495|5.0|There are good thriller/mystery writers, superb ones and a tiny group that are in a class of their own. My own rating would place Le Carre (at his peak) and Chandler in this best-of-the-best ranking - and Henning Mankell. This last of his novels that are built around his middle ranking police officer, Kurt Wallender, is superb. He has an extraordinary ability to make characters and story organically feed on each other. At the end of The Troubled Man, he leaves this reader at least with a resonant and almost indelible memory of the psychology within the story - Wallender's haunting sense of his physical decay, a sadness and questioning about his life, the pervasive lingering of family relationships and secrets, and the complexities of loving. At the same time, these very factors drive the story which in turn shapes the regrets and inner questioning.<br /><br />There is a rich and elegiac mood that is reflective and haunting. Even the most minor characters - an old waitress, fellow police officers, friends of the Swedish retired naval commander, whose disappearance begins the story, and hospital staff - add to both the plot, the filling out of the background social tapestry of Sweden now and then - then being the days of the Cold War and the immense political tensions between left and right - and the personal self-analysis of Wallender as he grows old and knows he is not at all well. Key relationships are deftly handled. Wallender's daughter is strikingly portrayed as both new mother in a relationship that may or may not work out, her father's best critic and bridge between him  and his ex-wife, and as the lover of the Naval commander's son. While Mankell is not an emotive writer, there is a superb and moving small episode that brings back the woman he so loved (this is the central element in his earlier Dogs of Riga), that shows just how much he can do with just small vignettes and simple conversations.<br /><br />Let me present reasons not to buy this book to offset my praise. It's a little too long. It is slow-paced and the complex plot a series of undramatic puzzles, small discoveries, conjectures and conversations by which Wallender teases out the true story of what happened and why. It is not an exciting read. While it is overall an engaging story, there are several places where Wallender's intuitive leaps seem a little unconvincing, with one coincidence that is just unreal and there only to move the plot to a key twist. It is, in Scandinavian mystery tradition, dour, though it pales in comparison with, say Nesbo and Anders and Bergstrom (if you want a real, real downer, try their Box 21 - or, rather, don't) of which Mankell is a fellow member of the Humor Free Zone of novelists.<br /><br />A useful comparison for readers unfamiliar with Mankell is that if you like the Steig Larrson trilogy (Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, etc.) then you should enjoy this novel. Larrson's trilogy is like The Troubled Man in many ways (including the authors' own background passion as left-wing political activists) but Troubled Man is far better crafted, almost impeccably so. I love the Larsson books despite their many flaws but Mankell is much more adept, especially in the economy with which he establishes character and setting (Larrson's two page lists of brand names Lisbeth buys when she moves into her new apartment are examples of the contrast; Wallender uses a few sentences to add far more texture).<br /><br />If you like le Carre, there's no more to add, except \\"Enjoy.\\"<br /><br />This is a masterwork.'s a little too long.

B003ITZBVS|5.0|Batman:  Mask of the Phantasm was my favorite Batman cartoon until this one came out. It's very adult. Very dark. And very violent. I wouldn't recommend it for anyone under 13.<br /><br />I don't want to give the slightest away about it, but I'll assure you that it's packed with strong storylines, thick and engrossing atmosphere and the professional Batman voices you're used to hearing from Batman:  The Animated Series.<br /><br />If you like Batman, check this one out.
B0034G4OXQ|2.0|\\"Hereafter\\" is a predictable and uninspired story. The screenplay doesn't work well and the movie never takes off. I am not complaining about its being 'slow' as some people write here. This is not the issue at all. As soon as you see the three main characters, Matt Damon, the French journalist, the British child, you know that at the end of the film they will meet and something 'meaningful' will happen. From the well-shot opening scene about the tsunami to the final happy ending, the film is extremely predictable.    This is not a good film. Period. It is not an 'artsy', European-like movie. I wish it were.
B003L77GRO|5.0|You will barely recognize her at first because she plays an abused victim whom Dexter rescues from a cadre of serial killers.  But, yes, it is film actress Julia Stiles who joined the Dexter cast this season and she does a bang up job as the second lead in the show. She sets in motion the fact that there are four guys out there who are systematically murdering women after sexually abusing and torturing them for weeks.  Lumen wants revenge on these men but she threatens to bring Dexter's whole house of cards apart because she doesn't know how to kill people like he does.<br /><br />The villain in chief they need to bring to an end is played by Jonny Lee Miller as one of these rich, lifestyle gurus with seminars, tapes, books, shows and so forth.  If you pick his message apart, as Dexter does, it clearly does allow for taking life to the extreme edges and going over them.  Dexter has his comic moments as well where bodies are tumbling out of trucks encased in cans or he's murdering someone in an RV while the police stand right outside trying to peer in.  As usual, criminally oriented Florida, and especially Miami is the perfect backdrop to all of this.<br /><br />There are many subplots going as well and Deb, his sister, is the detective handling the case plus her partner suspects Dexter of murdering Rita.  Her partner brings twisted Narc Peter Weller (ROBOCOP) onto the case and every time he shambles into the picture, Dexter is in yet a new kind of trouble.<br /><br />I will again warn anyone new that the Dexter show no longer follows the novels except in the broadest possible strokes.  There are a substantial amount of characters who are alive in the novels who were killed off in the show.  I do read the novels when they come out and watch the show when it comes out.  However, I now think of them as \\"related\\" works only.  The BONES show does the same thing, bearing only some semblance to Kathy Reichs's novels.  If you don't like your shows and books to be this wide apart and already are watching the show, you may want to wait to read the books all in one big gulp as a different experience.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B000N3ST3Y|1.0|When I saw the song list my immediate reaction was \\"you gotta be #@%$^&*@#  kidding me !!\\"  This compilation almost totally ignores their most glorious albums by far : their first 7 albums from the 1970's  Selling England by the Pound, Trespass, Nursery Cryme, Foxtrot, The Lamb, Wind & Wuthering, Trick of the Tail.  These albums are to die for.  Forget the 1980's stereotypical pop, as played by countless other bands.  Their first 6 albums were unique, unforgettable masterpieces.  Check out the website [...]  which  rates the best 100 Prog (progressive) rock albums of all time :  at number ONE is Selling England by the Pound  and at number 4 is Foxtrot.  I rest my case.
0230710077|5.0|I had read and seen many books and movies about World War II but never World War I and this book gave me great insight into how the War started and also about the Russian Revolution.    The great thing about Ken Follett books is that even though it's fiction, you also learn about history.  Can't wait for the next book to be written.
B0016MJ6T2|5.0|I am a HUGE Mac. fan.  and this is one of his best performances.  Seth green as well.  Great cast all around.
B000002LRX|5.0|That's how addictive this album is.  Every listen reveals some new subtle twist or melody that knocks me off my feet.  Patton and Co. somehow wrote off-beat but completely listenable bliss on almost every track.  I didn't get it back in '92, but easily my top 10 of all time.  Nevermind or lame-o Pearl Jam albums were the critics choices, but this blows them all away.  A band at its creative peak (and more talented).  Go back in time and listen to brillance that only intelligent listeners can appreciate.    Simply awesome and should be in everyone's collection...you'll find yourself coming back for more and more.  Just like a Crack Rock...
B004NOH9LW|5.0|I loved the movie. I watched it 3 times on on demand video. Matt Damon and cast were wonderful. It grabbed you right from the start. Cudo's to Mr. Eastwood!

030745455X|3.0|The Girl Who Played With Fire is not a bad book, but neither would I say it's great. It baffles me why the Millennium series is so popular as it's not that well written and the plot is only semi-interesting. Lisbeth Salander is a different character from the norm and the parts involving her are the best of the book. Overall, I think the author needs a heavy editing hand although I did see that some reviewers do like all the miscellaneous detail that I find pointless. I'm not even talking about the contents of her grocery cart, but like paragraphs about Blomkvist's relationship with Berger or even Berger's career decisions.
B0046MOVD0|2.0|I watched the movie in 3D when it was in cinema & I really enjoying it. After watching back the movie in Blu-ray (2D)... the movie is kind of suck. Resident Evil Afterlife is made for 3D... only in that medium I believe you'll enjoy this movie. Some of the moments look really awkward in 2D.    However, in term of Blu-ray transfer... its AWESOME... the picture & audio quality are superb.
B004R0WKNE|5.0|The cast of the wonderful movie really delivers.  Rachel McAdams is superb. Few could play her character, naive and overly idealistic on the outside, tougher and smarter than you think on the inside, with such skill.  Her awkward romance moments are some of the movie's best scenes.  Harrison Ford and Diane Keaton, especially Keaton, are also outstanding.  McAdam's love interest, Patrick Wilson, is very good, but their relationship is almost an afterthought.  Looking back, this was by far the best romantic comedy from 2010.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|True Blood has all the best elements to make a great show it has vampires, nudity, killing, sex and a whole lot more. If your a big fan of the books the show may disappoint you a little because it doesn't follow the books that close but it is still one of the best shows ever!!!! I cant get enough of it.
159420229X|5.0|What a fantastic book, Foer's style is perfect for the topic: the epitome of niche hobbies, memorizing things(?)  His sources are witty, interesting, and friendly. Way more than a high level overview of what must be one of the most painful ways to spend a weekend, Josh Foer creates an incredibly compelling story that I wish would have continued on and on.<br /><br />Note: this really, really isn't a self-help book. But it could serve as a great bit of motivation and inspiration for anyone out there who might want to improve their memory.

Of course, this being a DVD of a season of a TV show, there was no way to really know if I would \\"like the show.\\" Word of mouth stated it was a quality show and we should like it. That was true. We enjoyed the first season of the Good Wife and certainly will follow that up with the second season.
B002ZG975Q|2.0|I had hoped that this movie would be good, but it just wasn't that good. Sure it has some sweet romantic moments, but I was disappointed by the ending because it was so anti-climatic.

However if you are in the mood for a sweet/cute movie, then this is the movie for you. Overall a bland movie...

159420229X|5.0|I heard Joshua Foer being interviewed on \\"The Diane Rehm Show\\" (NPR). And immediately I knew I had to purchase this book. And I simply could not put it down. I am one of those senior citizens who notices that the answers--well, the questions--don't pop into my head as quickly as they once did when I spend my daily half hour with \\"Jeopardy!\\" And I certainly notice that most of the contestants are much younger than me. But I keep in there. And I do a daily crossword puzzle from the local paper. And I am an avid reader as my \\"reviews\\" here at amazon.com will attest.<br />So I wanted to read this book. And what a wonderful journey.<br />So do you, potential reader, known why, if you have taken one of those classy black cabs in London, that you will have such great service? That the cabby will know exactly where you want to go? And will be able to answer all your questions about London while you are enroute? You don't. Then read this book, not that this would be the only reason to read it. But it is filled with fascinating information about memory.<br />And this young writer--and he is young--is such a fluid style. What a disappointment to discover that there are no other books by him. But most assuredly there will be. In the book you will learn that he is not just reporting information. He went on his own \\"memory enhancement\\" journey. And won a rather unique little national contest. Oh, did you not know about that contest? Then buy this book. You will not be disappointed.
B000JQUZCI|5.0|Frankenstein's monster was hiding in the wods next to a cabin occupied by a couple.  On hearing them converse, the monster desired the ability to speak and read.  By listening to them , he figured out how language woked.  He then looked for literature and found and read \\"The Sorrows of Young Werther\\".  Didn't see that in any of the movies.  Who knew that Frankenstein's monster was a German Romantic? Now Victor Frankenstein himself, maybe so.
B000PDYVVG|1.0|I kept waiting for the story to get some point. It just dragged on and on forever! I got about half way and couldn't take the torture anymore. It basically is about an unstable divorcee (her choice) talking about 'finding herself'. Whine, Wine, Praying, more whining and food. Oh and then at the end everything is kind of hunky dorey. (I had to skip to see if anything got any better). I ended up watching the movie to quicken things up and just out of curiosity. I felt it was a real blow for Julia Roberts to have resorted to this role. It was just as much a snooze fest as the book. Don't waste your time.
B001U887WE|4.0|This is my third pair of crocs.<br />The first two were given to my by my mom when I took a job in Iraq. I thought they were the ugliest things until I put them on. They were soooo comfortable. I had a pair similar to the blitzens called the [[ASIN:B001A429O0 crocs Unisex Mammoth Clog]] and I had a pair of the classic croc sandals (AMZN is not allowing me to post the link to this one?) The mammoth was chocolate brown and the sandals khaki. I still have the sandals but gave the mammoths away when I transferred.<br /><br />Now onto the these Blitzens.<br /><br />COLOR:<br />I got these in the Navy Blue. I do like the color. Liner is nice and white and so far does not look dingy from the dust around here.<br /><br />SIZE:<br />They felt a tad small to the size though, maybe this is because of the liner but the liner didn't feel any thicker then what I had in the mammoths and they fit perfect.<br /><br />LINER:<br />The first few times I wore the blitzens my foot actually got stuck in the liner. Now the liner seems to have flattened out a bit and I don't have that problem. Also I wear these without socks as I usually am slipping them on to head to the shower (I'm back in Iraq), well the liner doesn't feel as soft in this pair.<br /><br />COMFORT:<br />I will say they are still comfortable but not as comfortable as my other two, not sure why. I am back in Iraq and the ground is covered in river rocks to help keep the dirt and dust down. I have not had a problem in any of my crocs walking in this environment. I won't say I can't feel the rocks at all but more comfortable walking in the crocs on the rocks than in tennis shoes.<br /><br />Overall I would recommend these to others. Especially those in Iraq. The other nice thing about these vice the mammoths is that there are not as many holes in them so better at keeping out the draft, water, and rocks. More than likely I will just convert these in the summer and take out the liner.

0756404738|3.0|What a disappointing year this has been already.  First Joe Abercrombie released Heroes...I love his other books but this was a real snooze and it was very confined, like being trapped in a small room.  Now, the eagerly awaited Wise Man's Fear FINALLY comes out and it seems like this book was written by a different person.  The pacing is plodding at times and jumpy at others, almost manic.  The sense of time in the book is harder to understand than Ozzie Osbourne.  Unsatisfying segues to the next \\"adventure\\" leave you feeling disappointed at the lack of imagination.  Parts of the book seem very Piers Anthony in quality..that is to say, you will like them if you are 13 and just discovering girls, otherwise it is just a lot of curve of hip and swell of breast rehash.  Several of the situations/dialogues are poorly written and you are literally expelled from the world that you were immersed in(the blow up between Kvothe and Denna was particularly bad).  This book could have been and should have been so much more.  I hate to say it, but I feel like we are going from a trilogy into a long and plodding \\"Wheel of Time\\" death spiral.  Rothfuss has the chops to make a great book and this is readable.  It just doesn't do justice to the first book or the characters.

B0041KKYBA|5.0|I agree whole-heartedly with all those who have said already that his is a must-see film. It is essential that all people of good faith learn about the high crimes committed against America and the world by Wall Street elites. The tragedy that sinks in by the conclusion of the film is that none of the causes of these crimes have been corrected. Even the candidate, now President, who vowed to fix things is now complicit in the whole abominable mess. You will wonder by the end if America is becoming Babylon the great whore spoken of in the Apocalypse.
0316044695|5.0|It is an exceptional book, and a terrific account from one who was there in Afghanistan, fighting America's fight. I wish that the author was less reinforcing of the dialectic that is American politics. I do understand how modern warfare requires the weighing of right and wrong, but to bring those morals to the battlefield is to be afraid of one's decisions on said battlefield. Either he's right and our politicians truly need to understand the implications of war, or he is wrong and thus his judgement of the \\"LEFT\\" should never have entered into his mind.   Without all the politicing this is a fantastic read.
B0013LL2Z2|3.0|I remember seeing this when it came out.  Even then, the effects seemed chinzy and the acting was over-blown, while the dystopia was rather unconvincing.  It is a carefree community of youth that lives in an underground complex cut off from the outside world that was long ago somehow poisoned; when they reach a certain age, they must attempt to survive (yet never do) in a kind of gyrating flyer contest, while enforcers keep the order.  One enforcer (York) is ordered to undertake a quest with a soulful girl (the astonishingly beautiful Jenny Agutter in her hollywood prime) outside the complex.  What they discover completely demolishes their world view, making them kind of revolutionaries.  The ending is one big fat deus ex machina  that in my opinion utterly lacks imagination.<br /><br />That being said, there are many good characters, from Farah Fawcette right before she became really famous and Richard Jordan as York's enforcer partner.  Upon re-watching, it also has this disco feel to it, so 70s that it is fun to watch, though you laugh for the most part when you are not supposed to.<br /><br />Recommended for nostalgia, not as the hard scifi that it yearns to be.
B001P5Q6F2|5.0|I'm not a big fan of their first two albums like some other folks. I love Ashes of the Awake which is a seminal work, and I was disappointed with Sacrament. Over time Sacrament is listenable and even enjoyable. But Wrath completely blows the doors off of Sacrament! It's taken me probably 20 listens over time to really warm up to this one but now I am hooked! It's AWESOME!!!! I read interviews with the band where they discuss what their intentions were with regards to Sacrament and Wrath. Understanding that places the work in the context to listen with an appreciation of what they were trying to accomplish as opposed to what you were hoping it would be. For the people who complain this stuff is just rehashed riffs and sounds, look, the truth is there will never be another Slayer. Slayer was the original. The question now is how will their disciples put similar genre music together? And honestly how many times or years can you listen to Slayer before you feel like you need to listen to something new?! In this genre, Lamb of God (like Sepultura) have accomplished almost the impossible. That is, they have put together seamless, edgy, catchy highly listenable music of this genre which pushes new directions and is top notch, with virtuosity that few other bands can match!
1401309666|4.0|Chris Anderson in his book \\"The Long Tail: Why the Future of Business is Selling Less of More\\" described the changes that the Internet has made in retailer markets. Anderson wrote the \\"The Long Tail\\" as an article for his magazine \\"Wired\\" in 2004, since then the article was a global success and a reference for marketers and business people around the world.     The book compared retailer markets before and after the internet success. In the past, our culture was a \\"massive popularity contest\\" since retailer markets were driven by blockbusters and popular hits. There was an era in which consumers did not have the opportunity to explore different interests and tastes, because there were no places to find anything different than recently products. It was a market of multitudes.   Anderson used the statistic model \\"long-tailed distributions\\" to illustrate the main point of his article, affirming that today companies could increase their sales and market presence by reaching niche markets.   Markets have changed from massive to niche; today people decide accurately what they want, and where to find it, the more they find the more they like.    In the book, Anderson mentioned the role of \\"scarcity\\" in the new online business. Today, distributors and retailers have the opportunity to promote their products without \\"shelf\\" restriction; they only need online presence. Therefore, there are certain types of products that are no longer \\"scarce\\" in the market.  The online market reduced the costs of connecting supply and demand.     Anderson explained the concept of the democratization of producers; people around the world are encouraged to develop products and services and use the Internet as a commercialization channel.  Cutting the cost of consumption and connecting supply and demand are also important forces in the new online market; people compete with large corporations in the same market.    In the online market people play significant role as tastemakers and filters. Theword of mouth is still the most effective approach to spread ideas and recommend products. In the online markets consumers' reviews are essential, no matter how much companies invest in developing products and selling its benefits, people's opinions will determine the success or the failure of a product or service.     I think Anderson did an excellent job; The Long Tail is a key reference for all the people who want to participate in online markets. No matter how big the corporation or the entrepreneur is, the two most important business strategies in the online market are determine and reach the right niche, and provide that niche with the best. You must to believe in your product no matter how rare it is. The Internet has created a market for all the interests.    The book was written in 2006, at that time social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter, Delicious, etc) were in developing process, this is why I think the author did not mention them. Today, these collaborative tools create more accessibility to reach niche markets.
0553582038|4.0|I myself missed many of the important events and turning points and only understood how important this book was after reading the Wiki summary for this book. Remarkably easy to miss and forget due to how certain passages drag. I read this one for months, wasn't too excited about it.     One thing I noticed about the writing style is that you can really pick up any of the books and get the whole story through flashbacks and mental notes of characters anyway.     I can say this because I began reading at book two (Clash of Kings) and the whole story is pretty understandable. Reading book one after finishing the 2,3, and half reading 4 I can say the first one was rather action packed, fresh, but it lacked the most precious character development moments of later books. Book 1 Tyrion felt dull compared to what you've read of him later. But that's only good.      To conclude, we really could skip book 4 and 5 and read Book 6 straight away and get all the story and immersion - maybe even more due to us having to actually think about what happened in the meantime instead of reading through it. Putting the puzzle pieces together yourself is more beneficial in my opinion, especially if the author isn't enthusiastic about doing it for you.    I apologise for the chaotic review, but I am NOT a seasoned reviewer.    Short version:   This  book is not as bad as portrayed, especially if you pay attention to what's going on (ridiculously hard to do at some points).   However, you could do without it, as Martin's writing style fills in your gaps sufficiently. Definitely skip it if you want the change in characters to be more noticeable in the Book Six.
B001KPK6Q2|4.0|A few months ago I was introduced to Taylor Swift's You Belong With Me, which I like a lot. From there, I heard other songs of hers, and finally decided to buy one of her albums yesterday. All in all, I think it was worth it; I certainly like some songs more than others but, hey, that always happens when you get an album of music!<br />Taylor Swift has a nice voice that is pleasant to listen to. Her voice doesn't have that \\"perfect\\" sound some recording artists have: her recorded songs sound more like a real person singing rather than someone's singing voice that has been run through some computer programs to make it sound different.  Don't get me wrong--it's not like I hate that sort of music--it's just nice to hear the more natural, unchanged sound of Taylor Swift's really nice singing voice.<br />Taylor Swift is definitely now one of my favorite \\"popular\\" singers.

ABOK - as we knot geeks call it - has directions for and illustrations of thousands of knots and references on how they are meant to be used; any duplications are due to the versatility of the knot and it being applied in various applications.<br /><br />Clifford Ashley was born and raised at the end of the era of canvas sail. Steam was taking over, the industrial revolution was in full stride and the arts and skill of true seamanship were beginning to fade. The commercial fishing trade was the last hold out of the old ways and Mr. Ashley, and artist by trade, was assigned to write and article on whaling. This assignment coupled with his growing up in coastal Massachusetts, started him on the work for which he is best known. The Ashley Book of Knots.<br /><br />If you are only interested in nautical history, this book is still an excellent option.

B001EN1R2M|5.0|Like most Crue fans, I bought this album on vinyl AFTER getting my hands on their sophomore release, \\"Shout at the Devil\\". This is back in '83, guys, when all we had was word-of-mouth and Metal Mag's like Hit Parader to educate us. These girls I hung around with at school told me about this album so I bought it and was blown away. I liked it better than SATD, but looking back now, it's almost comparing apples to oranges. Listening to this now, it almost seems like the Crue thought this was going to be their only chance, so why not cram as much quality in as possible- believe it or not, they put more effort into the songwriting and performance on this album than they did on their stage show, outfits, makeup, hair, etc.  They were hungry, the music was raw, yet had some polished production in places, and this really shows off the caliber of Sixx's songwriting. Didn't appreciate the nod/homage to the Rolling Stones' Sticky Fingers 1971 album cover at the time (I was only 13- and it's hard to believe it was only 10 years later), AND only 8 years after the Raspberries released \\"Tonight\\"! \\"Tonight\\" wasn't on the original vinyl recording unfortunately; I'm sure I would have recognized \\"E. Carmen\\" on the credits and then asked my dad, \\"Isn't that OUR Eric Carmen?\\" (from Cleveland). I wore out the grooves on this album, and it was an education in supportive/basic drumming AND well-placed flash/flair - Tommy Lee is in my top 5 drum teacher list. Back to the Stones/Raspberries influence -> nice tip of the hat, Crue- letting us know that you weren't delusional megalomaniacs, thinking you invented your style, and blatantly saying, \\"We are bad boys, raw, and can rock like the Stones, yet we also can write Power Pop tunes like the Raspberries!\\" My favorites are: \\"Live Wire\\", \\"Come On and Dance\\", \\"Public Enemy #1\\", \\"Merry-Go-Round\\", \\"Piece of Your Action\\", \\"Starry Eyes\\", \\"Too Fast for Love\\", and \\"On with the Show\\", which is 8/9ths of the original album, and alone is worth the $9.99sale price on iTunes, and the extra bonus songs are a nice addition, too.  Buy it. Learn it. Know it. Live it. (Another reviewer mentioned that hearing these songs brings back pleasant memories from this era.  Agreed. I had the privilege to see the Crue during their SATD tour, when they were an opener for Ozzy, then again during Theater of Pain and Girls Girls Girls headlining.) Fantastic Album.
0156034026|2.0|I regret that I read this book.  It was an utter waste of time, free of joy and totally familiar to anyone who has followed the radicalization phenomenon illuminated by 9/11.  Of all the books in the store that day.....

B00001SIES|5.0|Snowbiz has alot of Muse tracks you've probably never heard of. Some of the songs on this album are a little iffy, not every track is worth alot of repeats basically. But songs like Sunburn, Muscle Museum, Showbiz, and Sober, are probably the bands best songs. I'm sure like every other Muse album i will grow to like the other songs (which happens all the time). But those four songs, made me hit replay, replay, replay. Buy this album if you like Muse, you won't be disappointed.
B001R4MEUM|5.0|\\"The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway\\" is my favorite album of all time, and has been for the last 25 years.  I discovered it in October of 1986, the night before I was to see Genesis at the LA Forum. Very quickly I became obsessed with it, learned every note and nuance.  It's powerful, subtle, sprawling, clear, obtuse.. it's a little bit of everything, which is probably one reason why I love it so. This album is a 95 minute trip into the subconscious and back again.     I make no judgement on the new mix. I heard it upon release a few years ago, and while I liked aspects of it, it does not replace the original mix in my heart.      My five-star rating is based solely on the music, as my favorite way to hear The Lamb is the original vinyl.  Until someone like Audio Fidelity or Mobile Fidelity Sound Labs work their magic on the original mix, this will remain for me.     Bottom line... remix or not, you need to hear this album. It is a classic.

B000FC10WU|5.0|The people of St. Mary Mead get hold of some juicy gossip when a body of an unknown young blonde woman is found in the library of the respectable Bantrys. As the suspicion  falls on Colonel Bantry, Mrs. Bantry calls on Miss Marple to help solve this perplexing case. Investigations performed by Colonel Melchett and Inspector Slack of Radfordshire force lead them to the rich invalid, Conway Jefferson. With the inclusion of Conway Jefferson in the case, the investigation spans to The Majestic Hotel in the neighbouring county of Glenshire. But as the number of suspects grows, the police seem to have no headway in the case. Maybe the clever but practical mind of Miss Marple is what they need to solve this complex case.<br /><br />When I read the title of `The Body In The Library', the first thing that popped up into my mind was the boardgame, Cluedo (Have your played it? It's quite fun actually). Maybe it was because of the clich&eacute;d setting of the murder in the library of the large house of the Bantrys. Reading the foreword of the author, I think Agatha Christie had the same thing in mind while writing this novel. The Body in the Library is Agatha Christie's take on the conventional setting of a murder mystery novel. But the `conventional' element of the novel does not prevent it from being ingenious.<br /><br />The characters of the book were intriguing, especially Mr. Conway Jefferson. Unable to cope up with the death of his children in a plane crash, he keeps his daughter-in-law, Adelaide, and son-in-law, Mark, close to him. This obligation to remain continuously close to him does not only make Mark and Adelaide a little bitter towards him but also makes them feel trapped. Then there is the dead girl's cousin, Josie who rather than being sad at her cousin's death is actually angry at her for being dead. Even Mrs Bantry is an interesting character. Instead of being disturbed by the discovery of a dead body in her house, she decides to enjoy the situation. Another unusual thing about the book was the number of detectives working on the case. Surprisingly, the characters of the detectives were exact carbon copies of each other, so much so that I had often difficulty in distinguishing them. Maybe this was intentional as Agatha Christie wanted to show the readers that the all the detectives involved in this case, wholly depended upon the circumstantial and forensic evidence to solve the case. On the contrary, Miss Marple chooses to closely study the characters and habits of the suspects and the victim while trying to find the murderer.<br /><br />Though I had heard a lot of praise about Agatha Christie before reading this book, but this is the first Agatha Christie I have ever tried. After reading The Body in the Library, I must say that Agatha Christie is truly the Queen of Mysteries. The suspense that she builds up by the end of the novel is almost unbearable. Your hand will continuously twitch to turn to the last chapter to know the murderer. So, now  I am ready to gobble up the rest of the Agatha Christie mysteries. It's a good thing that my sister owns almost 50 of them!!t the book was the number of detectives working on the case.

1573228737|4.0|\\"Sexy, Spooky, Stylish\\" - that's the blurb on the cover. If I was not a Sarah Waters fan already, I would have picked up the book based on those words. How can you resist a book with that description? After reading the book, I can safely say that those words are an accurate description of Affinity. I will further add to that - \\"Haunting and magical.\\"<br /><br />It seems, I have been reading many deliciously gothic novels recently. Well, I am not complaining! Affinity is yet another addition to my love for anything gothic. Sarah Waters, who is considered the \\"Queen of Victorian Gothic novels\\", churns out yet another winner.<br /><br />Margaret Prior suffers a complete mental breakdown, following her father's death. A failed suicide attempt breaks her even further. She lives with her domineering mother and a sister, who will soon be married. Margaret feels jealous because she thinks, by marrying, her sister will somehow \\"evolve\\" while she will remain stagnant. She's constantly under her mother's watchful eyes and is treated like an imbecile. Her former lover, Helen, is now married to her brother - a fact that she is still unable to get over. Margaret is a repressed, closed-up young woman with no hopes for the future.<br /><br />In order to forget her painful past, she becomes a \\"lady visitor\\" at Millbank Prison. Her job is to talk to the women prisoners, listen to them and guide them towards a more positive direction. She's drawn towards one particular prisoner, Selina Dawes, a spiritualist and a psychic medium, who has been imprisoned for assaulting one of her clients.<br /><br />When you love an author a lot, you tend to develop gigantic expectations from all of that author's books, which is probably unfair. I have not been very subtle about my love for Sarah Waters. Fingersmith and The Little Stranger are not only my favorite books by her, but are also my all-time favorites as well. Perhaps my expectations were very unrealistic. In the beginning I felt a little deflated. Don't get me wrong. The beginning was compelling enough to keep me reading on, but it was just not up to the admittedly unrealistic standards I have set for Sarah Waters' novels. However, this feeling did not last long as the book soon picked up and I was hooked!<br /><br />Affinity is told from both Selina's and Margaret's perspectives. The reader feels as fascinated by Selina as Margaret is. Yet, she still remains an enigma, a mystery throughout the book. The story unfolds slowly, with each chapter pulling you in completely.<br /><br />Selina is viewed as a charlatan, a fraud and a cheat. But the time spent talking to her each day convinces Margaret of her truth. Moreover, there are some strange, extraordinary events which provide further proof of Selina's powers. With each meeting, the magnetic pull , which Margaret feels towards Selina intensifies, leading towards the ultimately shocking conclusion.<br /><br />\\"We are the same, you and I. We have seen cut, two halves, from the same piece of shining matter. Oh, I could say, I love you--that is a simple thing to say . . . But my spirit does not love yours--it is entwined with it. Our flesh does not love: our flesh is the same . . .\\"<br /><br />I deeply felt for Margaret. I felt her frustration and how repressed she was. I can understand how suffocated she felt under her mother's constant nagging. One of the most powerful aspects of Affinity is the setting and the atmosphere the author creates. Millbank prison is like a character in itself - the author's descriptions of the prison is so vivid that you can feel the prisoners' predicament in the controlled and suffocating environment.<br /><br />Margaret's longing for Selina, the unspoken but intense \\"forbidden\\" emotions and her unhappiness is heartrending and hits you hard.<br /><br /> \\"It is as if every poet who ever wrote a line to his own love wrote secretly for me, and for Selina. My blood - even as I write this- my blood , my muscle and every fibre of me, is listening, for her. When I sleep, it is to dream of her. When shadows move across my eye, it is to dream of her, I know them now for shadows of her. My room is still, but never silent - I hear her heart, beating across the night in time to my own.\\"<br /><br />Margaret's stark despair and misery really got to me. My heart was breaking for her all throughout. Sarah Waters has an incredible ability to make you care so much for the characters that they almost become real people to you.<br />Selina's descriptions of her life as a medium and her ability to contact spirits is so real and even mesmerizing, that you believe her without questions or skepticism. Her conversations with the spirits and her experiences creeped me out quite a bit. It unnerved me and fascinated me at the same time.<br /><br />Like most of author's other novels, Affinity has females as the main protagonists and is set in the Victorian era. In addition, the author has eloquently tackled subjects like  repression, sexual awakening and spirituality. Three are several feminist elements as well. The author, very subtly, raises questions about a woman's place in the society.<br /><br />\\"Why do gentlemen's voices carry so clearly, when women's are so easily stifled?\\"<br /><br />Margaret, though technically a \\"free\\" woman, is still a prisoner - to her gender, to her circumstances and to her mother's wishes.<br /><br /> \\" Women are bred to do more of the same - that is their function. It is only ladies like me that throw the system out, make it stagger...\\"<br /><br />The ending is probably the best part of the book. I am still reeling from the shock of the end. It was so unexpected; I doubt anyone could have seen it coming. To say I am impressed is an understatement.<br /><br /> Like every other Sarah Waters' books, Affinity will remain with me for a long time to come. If I had not read any other books by this author, it would have been a 5 star read for me. Affinity, in my opinion, is not her best, but still  a fantastic read. Sarah Wates' lyrical writing makes every book worth it.<br /><br />Now I just have two more books by Sarah Waters to read and then begins the long painful wait for her next book. I believe I can gobble up all of Sarah Waters' books in one go and yet be hungry for more of her brilliance.ve across my eye, it is to dream of her, I know them now for shadows of her.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|1:33  Format says it all,  Wait for the wide screens.  This is a ploy to get you to buy the first set and spend more money to get the one you really want.  This is occurring more and more often.    Look at the Lord of the Rings Trilogy - Pulled the same deal
B00000099Y|5.0|Well, probably my favourite album of all times and genres.  Seing them live in january has brought me back to listening to it, and yes, it is still as good. I'd even say that some songs - Aenima? - has taken an even darker reality to them since then, as you will understand if you know the album. If you don't, then get it right now!   This IS a masterpiece : incredibly finely crafted, grows on you, sometimes more than you would expect, maybe even more than you would desire.  The live act is dazzling and sooo clever : this is art my friends! Not the usual metal crap show, a real complement to the music, lights and all. Don't miss it if you can! I paid a plane ticket from New Caledonia to Australia for this, and when I came out of the entertainment center, I had but one thought : I want to see them again tomorrow! And this is very rare, as many live acts will bore or tire you after 2 hours - or much less in some cases - even if you love the band's recorded stuff. Best act ever seen : not just a show, an expression of art.  The music? Well, if you know Tool you know what I'm talking about again, and if you don't, try it! But be warned : it is very strong flavoured and you may take a while to digest this new experience. The main problem afterwards is to be able to listen to anything else. And crave for the next album for 5 years time. And go back to your own band pretending to love what you're doing. And fear that some day they will split because they need to move on to other creative realms. And start seeing through your third eye, which is most unpleasant, especially if you live a nice and comfortable life.    All Tool-junkies of the world, you know Maynard would despise us for being so. So act like me, pretend like you don't care, like it's just another band. And cuddle your albums in the secrecy of darkness. Jambi may just turn up.
0618918248|1.0|As a full blown atheist I can safely say - SKIP THIS BOOK.<br />First of all it misses by a long shot the main problem with religion, which is the problem in believing in an absolute truth.<br />Richard again and again displays surprising certainty in matters which are far from certain with fanatic religious zeal.<br />In addition he goes as far as stating that a child brought up into religion is worse than a child sexually abused (goes to show that he will write anything to sell more books).<br /><br />Of course you reach these conclusions only if you endure the endless repetitive examples and very very shallow logical proofs.<br /><br />Unconvincing and time-wasteful.
0307456625|5.0|I stumbled onto this series because of the title and have been richly rewarded.    Thoughtful, quirky, gentle, evenly paced -- this is not a Jason Bourne novel. Each novel builds upon the one previous, and as each book is added to the next, the reader immerses him or herself further into Precious Ramotswe's Botswana, where red bush tea is ready any time of the day; where there is much to be learned by standing against the fence and contemplating cows; where Mma Makutsi talks to her shoes.    In some ways, this is a 21st century African Jane Austen series -- McCall Smith through his characters muses on life and death and gladness and sorrow, and though the land is foreign to many of us, the thoughts and the experiences are universal.    The \\"mysteries\\" are incidental to the story, providing impetus for the rich, rich telling of the lives of a series of funny, kind, intelligent, bizarre, thoroughly human people.    Superlative!
0385342047|1.0|Add me to the long list of reviewers who has been a fan of this series and was stunned by how what used to be a story about a charismatic, loving, if a bit thoughtless and irresponsible girl has turned into a story about a woman who is a pathological liar and an addict who is enabled by everyone around her.     It's one thing to lie to a bank manager because you're overwhelmed and scared by the amount of debt that you're in, it's a completely different thing to lie CONSTANTLY to your parents, your husband, your best friends, and even your child. This series has gone off the deep end in my opinion.     And the worst part about all this is that there is that a lot of it doesn't make sense, and there are no resolutions to these issues. In previous books, whenever Becky would get in over her head, at some point she would realize how much of a problem she had. In this book, we get maybe ONE resolution to an issue and everything else is completely swept under the rug. The crazy amount of money she spent when Brandon specifically told her to cut back during the recession? Not mentioned again. Her insane desire to have more children because she wants to buy more baby clothes? Not addressed either. And on and on. So much outlandish and disturbing behavior from Becky and so little consequences or resolutions.     If there is another book in this series, I really really hope its one where Becky finally grows up. Otherwise, I think any further books would be an insult to fans who have supported the series.
1591843790|5.0|The book has character.  Very few books I've found really have the ability to capture my attention but this one had me from the intro.  Tons of great information on how to \\"enchant\\" people and get them excited about your business.  I loved every word!
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|Watched the HBO series and had to buy it, being an old and former Marine. Veery real and well done.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|I just finished watching this movie yesterday. I thought it was Excellent. When I saw the coming attractions on TV I didn't really want to see it but the other day I was at the doctors office and they played this DVD on the TV. I had no choice but to watch it while I waited and I was enjoying it!!<br /><br />I didn't get a chance to watch the whole thing because I finally got called in to see the doctor.<br /><br />I borrowed the movie from my Supervisor at work and watched the whole thing last night.<br /><br />I LOVED IT!! It's funny, it's sad, it's a great family movie. All the actors are wonderful!!<br /><br />I will buying this movie for myself and adding it to my DVD collection. When I get it I'm going to watch it again :):)
1591843790|5.0|Enchantment is Guy Kawasaki's masterpiece. Guy has been the most clever and voice in the business voice for decades. His ability to crank out one useful idea after another, and to pull the reader into the fun, is downright magical in this book.  No,Guy doesn't present clean neat and tidy models like \\"serious\\" business books do.  Thank goodness, that is why this book is so much more fun and useful than most.  Guy not only has the rare ability to be smart and funny without taking himself too seriously, he is also honest enough not to pretend that the life -- or the world of business -- can be sliced and diced into orderly little categories.  This book is as useful as a fun book can be. Guy was born to write on the topic of persuasion.  Buy this book and Robert Cialdini's classic Influence, and you've got the best two book on the subject.
0679731725|5.0|This book, as everyone else has said, is beautiful, tragic, and haunting, with its gorgeous writing style and impeccably portrayed characters. Not a word goes wasted. I finished this book and immediately started it over again from the beginning - best book I have read in a very long time.
B00003CXRP|5.0|this was funny in the beginning when he was getting angry at a ball. Then he comes back from a four year ship wreck and has no one or anything. He lost his wife and everything that kept him alive in the first place.  thats the sad part. Well, at least he still can find the Lord. Good movie that makes you appreciate all you have.
B003L20ID8|4.0|Not knowing anything about the movie, or only a trailer or two, I went into the theater with an open mind, hoping for an intelligent, interesting diversion from life and all it's complexities.  Ha!  I got exactly what I wanted and more.  Though not terribly difficult to read \\"the hats vs the people\\" early on, it did make me wonder until the very end how was Matt Damon's character going to turn this around?  Nice change of pace from the the usual fire and crash scenes, very little actual violence found here, more of a love story with an interesting interference, made even more fun with all the changing of doors the Adjusters crossed through effortlessly.  Matt Damon did a fabulous job of showing us a charming, successful politician with a gorgeous toothy smile that suddenly,impulsively finds the woman of his dreams and decides on the fly he's going to outwit the Adjusters, capture her heart several times over, and convincingly wins her heart and theirs, thereby making the case for his free will more romantic and necessary than any old \\"fate\\" anyday!  Easy to see the Free Will vs. Fate moral of the story didn't make it any less enjoyable.  I left the theater smiling from ear to ear and wondering secretly what it was REALLY like to thoroughly and satisfyingly kiss Matt Damon. ;)

1442337966|5.0|The Power is a great CD!  i purchased it for a gift for a friend because someone had given it to me as a gift and i really enjoyed it, especially listening to it en route to work.  i will purchase another one, since mine was not returned after i loaned it. i also appreciate the quick service from Amazon.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|A very good & quick read.  I loved the first half, but I felt that something was lacking just a little bit in the second half. I thought it was written really well from Jack's perspective.
B001TW69J4|3.0|I fail to understand how Tosin Abasi is being hailed as the best breakthrough guitar player, the real deal, guitar God and what not. Being endorsed by greats such as Steve Vai, I was expecting something as mind bending or as comparable to Mattias IA Eklundh from Freak Kitchen. I was not expecting a \\"virtuoso\\" who plays a hybrid guitar and who's compositions are so repetitive, monotonous and sort of soul-less that I can't wait to skip to the next track hoping for a better song. I tried hard to like his music...& I am all for indi artists trying to make a difference in the prog-rock/ metal world. But something about this album didn't grab me, it did not appeal to me. And that \\"something\\" probably is a recurring lack of song writing finesse.     This album sounds like some guy sitting in his home studio work station just going on recording a slew of fast riffs/ licks and recording drum tracks over them and then just throwing a blazing fast solo in the songs every now and then to make them sound like they are complete pieces. I am sorry but I just cannot see this being put in the same group as stuff like Freak Kitchen, Borislav Mitic, Greg Howe, Sikth, Scar Symmetry, Bozzio-Levin-Stevens, etc. The techniques and impressive guitar fireworks are all good but the songs lack an overall body and melody for the most part.     What I like about the album is the fusion element of Abasi's compositions. They sound like metal sensibilities infused with jazz, flamenco and some traditional styles of music. The outcome is interesting and sounds good in places.     Overall I feel this is an \\"OKKK\\" album....I won't write home about it...I will still buy the second album though(whenever that comes out) because I feel that this guy has the potential of coming out with something excellent (hopefully not monotonous). But if even that album disappoints, then I am done with AAL.    Again, this is just my opinion. Therefore, AAL fans don't shoot me.
0765356147|4.0|The title says it all, as the end of the trilogy I don't want to give out any spoilers, just don't want potential readers to be disappointed. Still four stars.
1591843790|5.0|I'm not going to make this a long review since there are 99 others (at this point) and I would most likely just be repeating.<br /><br />What I will say is that I read this book just over a month ago.  Actually I've read it twice straight through and it remains within an arm reach away when I'm in my office.  Some days, when I'm struggling with something I just open it up anywhere are read a page or two.  It doesn't necessarily answer my question at hand but it does spark the creativity I needed to answer it myself.<br /><br />You're insane if you don't buy it.  If you can't afford to buy it head to your library!
B002U6CJCE|2.0|I have followed Jean Claude Van Damme in a lot of his films. I was a big fan from the era of \\"No Retreat, No Surrender\\", \\"Lionheart\\", \\"Double Impact\\" and also \\"Hard Target\\". He was the best during the era of the 90's for split kicks and the most perfect roundhouses you could see. The Universal Soldier franchise wasn't that bad. But, the character has not only aged, but he's forgotten that he had a 13 year old daughter in Universal Soldier: The Return! He was aging properly in this installment and wanted to live the rest of his days as a father, but now the story has completely changed and he's been living in a institute where the good doctor is trying to help him cope with his issues of not being a UNISOL. Then we bring back another original; Dolph Lungren, and his character is the only one that is exactly as the orignal story placed him - he just wasn't cutting off ears and wanting to keep them as personal gifts. But, his mental issues were still there.<br /><br />So, I have to sum it up by saying that I wasn't surprised at all. A trilogy works on great titles [Mission Impossible, Terminator, etc] . Even a film that goes on to make four movies (with all the same actors) can do well [Lethal Weapon, Die Hard]. But, this one should have stopped at The Return! They don't even like to talk about the Universal Soldier 2 Brothers In Arms, and they are also in post production of a Universal Soldier: A New Dimension! Van Damme and Lundgren are rumored to be in it. No disrespect, but there's a time to call it quits and then there's a time to just burn it down.
B002UJIY7A|4.0|A Perfect Getaway is a problematic film to review. Like the recently released The Book of Eli, it comes complete with a fairly ridiculous third-act twist; but I guess many twists are ridiculous these days. After all, how many twists can there be out there? Unfortunately there are also numerous problems with David Twohy`s direction, which is, to put it bluntly, generally shoddy and haphazard. And finally there is Milla Jovovich, who while seeming pleasant enough, once again proves that she's only worth casting if she is killing zombies or scaling futuristic skyscrapers. For whatever reason, Jovovich seems to have difficulty delivering a believable performance when cast as a normal woman. This problem rears its ugly head once again in A Perfect Getaway. Having said all that, I'm still recommending this film. Between the lush jungle setting, intriguing and suspenseful premise, and a charismatic and magnetic performance by one Timothy Olyphant, A Perfect Getaway still manages to deliver despite some questionable directorial decisions, one bad lead performance, and a rather lame twist.<br /><br />The film begins with hand-held footage of the recent wedding of our protagonists, Cliff and Sydney, played by Steve Zahn and Miss Jovovich, respectively. Luckily, the footage lasts only through the credits before that tired trope is abandoned in favor of a largely-traditional filming style (more on that later). The newlyweds are honeymooning in Hawaii and it's not long before they are headed off to a long hike through the Hawaiian jungle, complete with waterfalls, beaches, and all manner of magnificent scenery. Along the way they meet two other couples, a sketchy pair of free spirits who they come in to conflict with almost immediately, and a second pair, Nick and Gina, portrayed by Olyphant and Kiele Sanchez. This couple also intends to hike the trail and the four of them decide to stick together. It's not long before they come across a group of hysterical young women who are claiming that vacationers have been murdered on a neighboring island. The rumor is that it was a pair of killers, a man and a woman. With the set up complete, both couples continue their descent into the jungle, unsure of who they can trust, or just how far they will make it.<br /><br />Nick (Olyphant) has all sorts of crazy and unbelievable stories from his time as a Special Forces commando/Navy Seal/spook, and Olyphant has a ball with the character who \\"is really hard to kill.\\" When given the freedom to let loose, as he is here, the underrated Olyphant is capable of delivering an insanely charismatic performance, a performance in which you simply can't take your eyes off him. Nick's not the biggest guy in the world, but he's incredibly ripped and when combined with his violent background and devilish grin, the audience will feel both drawn to him and threatened by him. The fact that he's such a mysterious, dangerous, yet strangely endearing figure only adds to the performance. It's safe to say that without Timothy Olyphant this film simply would not work. He is that good, and while it's no award-winning performance, it is exactly what's desired in a popcorn thriller such as this. I have been a fan of Olyphant's since 1998's Go, and it's nice to see his profile rising as his career moves forward.<br /><br />Steve Zahn also does a great job in the comparatively thankless role of our hero Cliff, the rather square screenwriter who hikes through the jungle complete with glasses, dorky ball cap, and camcorder. Also of note is Chris Hemsworth, seen previously in Star Trek and soon to hit the mainstream as the title character in Marvel Studios' Thor. Hemsworth cuts an imposing figure as half of the aforementioned sketchy couple and his presence looms over the proceedings like a dark storm cloud.<br /><br />So the setting is highly appealing, the premise intriguing, and Timothy Olyphant's screen presence alone makes up for Milla Jovovich's subpar acting. What about the direction? The glue that holds everything together? Unfortunately, this marks the film's weak point as David Twohy makes several questionable artistic decisions which end up detracting from the film. During the film's third act there are several instances when the screen inexplicably switches to a split screen view, sometimes with up to 3 or 4 screens. This occurs when lots of action is taking place and the effect is disorienting, jarring, and confusing. It can be really tough to tell just who is doing what and I can't help but think that Twohy would have been better off just leaving it alone. This unfortunate tendency to rely on gimmicks pops up again a cringe-worthy and awkward chunk of exposition. Planted firmly in the middle of the third act, he decided that the audience needed a nearly ten minute long blue-tinted flashback. Not only is the blue saturation deeply distracting, but the awkwardly placed exposition is meant to be a shocking moment, when instead it just conveys Twohy's lack of confidence in his own script. And then of course, there is the twist. I'm sure many people will see it coming from a mile away, yet I did not (I have never been too good at guessing twists). To say anymore would be to give away a pretty decent surprise, but it's only really decent in the moment. Once the movie ends, you will find yourself second-guessing the logic behind it and that's never a good sign.<br /><br />A Perfect Getaway is in no way a perfect movie, yet it somehow remains engaging and exciting. Much of this can be attributed to the sheer overwhelming charisma of Timothy Olyphant, who at times seems to hoist the entire film on his back as he treks through the Hawaiian jungle. Sure some of the director`s decisions were questionable and the ending is a bit bizarre, but honestly, you probably won't care too much. As far as thrillers go, this one is entertaining and above average. 3.5 out of 5 stars.thing together?

B003JIPJRE|4.0|This was handled with care and very well. Jensen Ackles did a great job as Red Hood! His first voice-over gig and they felt he nailed it. Producer Bruce Timm knows how to keep the fans wanting more when it comes to these comic-book tales we grew up on, coming to life in animation. I was only surprised to hear that Bruce Greenwood is now doing the voice of Bruce Wayne/Batman. Kevin Conroy still makes Batman to me, but I will give respect where respect is due: Bruce Greenwood did a wonderful job.
B001TH7GT6|5.0|I love AmazonBasics products, because they are usually of excellent quality and have very reasonable prices.  These AmazonBasics RCA Component Video Cable is no exception. It is simply excellent.  The very heavy gauge cable and gold plated connectors really belong in the professional grade category.  They are definitely not \\"basic\\" or generic. You can easily pay twice to three times the AmazonBasics price for a similar cable.
B003NWS5AO|3.0|While far from being Robert's most forward-thinking record or concept, Band of Joy manages to generate enough curiosity as to where this will lead to. Personally I must admit that I feel Robert should be doing original material instead of singing covers which is something he's done too often lately. Nevertheless, the album does entertain if you take it for exactly what it is: a bunch of reworked songs.<br /><br />Although Band Of Joy can hardly be considered a masterpiece, Robert's voice is still there, magically powerful, but the music doesn't really 'cook'. A bit contrived and too predictably simplistic at times, borrowing too much from old/traditional forms and clich&eacute;s. Not a step forward, not a step backwards from what he did with Alison Krauss - just going through the motions it seems. But, well, er... if that's what he wants to be doing at the moment, and I should respect him for that, let him then.<br /><br />The album artwork is a bit of a shame too, it doesn't do it for me at all. When I found out Robert was the one who did it, I totally realized how important singing is for his life... Also re-using the name Band Of Joy just doesn't seem to fit and could be seen as an excuse for not finding a new, memorable identity. I'm not sure what John Bonham would've thought of that. For somebody who wants to be seen as a rolling rock always moving forward this could be taken as a little disappointment: Plant has delivered stronger, innovative works in Pictures At Eleven, Fate Of Nations and Mighty Rearranger.
B003Y74KAW|4.0|The silicon case is just as it's described basic.  It is a durable vinyl case for the iPhone. An almost perfect fit with just a bit of looseness.  It also fits the iPhone 3G.  It isn't nearly as protective as the otter box, but just for a colorful look.  The color makes me think of watermelon, red with a hint of pink in the mix.  I think it has a good price also.

0756404738|3.0|I want to start off by mentioning the fact that I am a huge Pat Rothfuss fan.  I have 3 copies of NotW, 2 of this book and also have The Princess and Mr. Whiffle.  I have read almost every blog post that he's ever written.  I love the guy!  Also, there will be some spoilers in this review.    It is painful to be so disappointed by this book.  I read it on my Kindle (my signed copy took a while to get to me and I just could not wait).  I remember thinking at about 10% into the book: Kvothe is going to get kicked out of the University soon.  Heck I was even nervous about it!  Yet where is Kvothe at the end of 1000 pages?  Still at the freaking University!?  I do not understand how Rothfuss could put this book out there and think that it is a satisfying continuation of the series.  He made innumerable references to Kvothe getting booted from the University, not only in NotW, but in this book as well!  The bad thing about this issue is that it's probably the one that I have the least problem with.  Kvothe's varied adventures during the course of this book have seemingly zero effect on him as a character!  How is this even possible?!  The only real change that his character undergoes is he becomes promiscuous to a fault.  The Denna stuff has gotten so ridiculous that it was really hard to not skip over while reading.  The Fae stuff was ridiculous.  I liked the Adem until he actually got to their town... then \\"anger\\", yeah... (I actually LOL'd at this and re-read it a couple of times to make sure that I had not mis-read this part...unbelievable, period).    I enjoy Pat's writing, it's the primary reason that I gave this book 3 stars instead of 2.  What I do not enjoy is the complete lack of any forward movement of the main plot arc.  I feel like I am in one of the 6-8 books in the Wheel of Time series.  I understand that people like Pat.  Heck I like the guy tons!  It does not change the fact that this book did NOTHING to move the story forward.  We learned little that wedid not already know at the end of NotW, and what we did learn was banal at best.
0802714544|3.0|One must give due deference to a book Graham Greene called 'The best spy story I have ever read.'  The drama of the Cold War provided the greatest backdrop for the spy novel in history, as the Super Powers and their allies deployed spooks to tip the balance of power, however slightly.<br /><br />The mechanics of spying during the period have the feel of verisimilitude, no doubt due to the author's first hand experience in the trade.  The most obvious contrast are the adventures of James Bond in the same period, outrageous by comparison.  The atmosphere of existential doom lends the book a special third dimension, which really gives it legs.  I was surprised by the ending, and didn't expect the spy to 'come in from the cold' in quite the way he did.  Also, nice touches of 'life' obviously felt by the author:  \\"He was the typical petit-bourgeois, cautious, complacent, mean.\\"<br /><br />Modern feminists should have a problem with the portrayal of the chief femal protagonist, Liz Gold, as a kind of tremulous foil, not unlike Ingrid Bergman's Ilsa in Casablanca.  However, such criticism would be somewhat anachronistic, like saying there is too much smoking.  At least books like this get those relations 'right' for the time, and aren't as histrionic in trying to 'recreate' them as in, say, Madmen.  A more serious criticism is that the story is occasionally marred by pedantic moralizing, as in the penultimate chapter, with the 'debate' between Leamas and Liz, for example.  That could have been understated a bit more, like their love affair, which never rises to breathless passionate pronouncements.<br /><br />A book like this may be the closest an Englishman may come to Existentialism, and remains a bracing tonic to the pieties of the day.  In the genre of Cold War spy novels, this book will always be a classic.
B0049P1ZZQ|4.0|Interesting show, although not as good as the comics so far. Good price for the Blu-ray version but thats probably because there is only like 8 episodes in the first season. I have high hopes for the next season, but I usually hate tv series after the first or second season so we will see. I am up to volume 10 on the comics so I can see how this could potentially be a very good series.
B00003CX9Q|2.0|Well, after many years in storage, I decided take this special edition set out let my grandchildren experience this movie. My children had watched it and it brought tears to more than one and on more than one occasion. We watched the updated version and were disappointed because the dvd began to stutter, jerk and finally stop. There were no visible scratches, at lest none that serious that could cause this kind of playback problem. Cleaning the disk, using a different player, etc did not solve the problem.     My conclusion is that this could be a media problem. Someone, somewhere could have overlooked quality control and used inferior media because there was some distinct discoloration on outer margins the offending disk and this could be the cause of the problem. I immediately made a copy of the good disk just to be safe. If you have this special edition, check your disks...they may deteriorate faster than you think.     The disk with the original version ran without a problem. And we watched this the next day and the grandkids and one of my grownup daughters thoroughly enjoyed themselves. The movie is timeless but this DVD set may not be.
0061726826|5.0|The beautiful message of Delirium:  Love.  A four letter word.  A word that has caused people to write poetry, songs, and countless novels.  A word that has led people to take their own lives.  Love is complex.  Love can be happy and sad at the same time.  Love can be overwhelming.  It is like chocolate for the soul.  One can survive without it, but, they can not live without it.  Love doesn't always have to be romantic, it can be parental, or between friends or siblings.  It can take any form, but without it, we aren't really alive.<br /> Delirium is, down to the binding, a book about love.  In a society where love, deliria, is thought of as a lethal disease.  At the age of 18, people are \\"cured.\\"  This involves going through a surgery that will ultimately cure you of deliria and keep you from getting it.  The summer before Lena is scheduled to be cured, she meets Alex.  Originally thinking he is cured (she sees this \\"surgery\\" scars), Lena talks to him.  However, soon she discovers that not only is he uncured, but he is also a rebel, an Invalid.  The Invalids are people who live in the Wilds, outside of the borders.  They hate what the US government is doing, controlling people by removing their ability to love.  After confessing who he really is, Lena is petrified that she has become infected with deliria.  She has always been scared of contracting the disease. Her mother had it, even though she went through three separate surgeries to get it removed.  It destroyed her.  After getting saved by Alex during a raid, Lena officially falls for him.  Their love opens her eyes to how dead she was before she fell in love.  The tightly controlled loveless world she has always known is wrong.  It is with Alex that she realizes that everything she has ever known, all the rules she was molded by, is a lie.  Their love is a tragedy waiting to happen.  Lena only has a few months before getting cured.  After that she will go to college and marry her assigned match.  Before Alex, she couldn't wait. Now, she would rather die than live without love.<br /> I had a love/hate relationship with this book.  I find dystopian literature interesting, but very hard to get through.  I almost always have to put the book down after each chapter or so because I'm so angry or scared.  Dystopian societies are frightening.  Which is why I rarely read them.  When I do, I read a lot of reviews on the book to make sure it is worth the emotional roller coaster I will most likely be going on.  This one intrigued me because not only are people oppressed, but they think it's the only way.  They want to be cured.  The population is brainwashed through the government's control of communication.  By controlling what people read, watch, listen to, etc., the government convinced people that love (deliria) is a terrible disease.  Without love, people don't feel the need to die unnecessarily or fight for anything.  It's probably the strongest emotion a human can have.  However, the idea that people are forced to undergo a surgery to never love, that pains me.  This book was so hard to get through because I was so shocked at the cruelty of it.  Those who knew the truth about it were severely punished or killed (usually the latter).<br /> Lena is a seventeen yr old girl who is looking forward to being cured at the end of the summer.  She always follows the rules, and believes that the government and the cure are protecting her from a painful death.  She wants nothing more than to live her life without the fear of contracting deliria.  Her transformation in the book was slow and gradual.  Written through her POV, the reader sees the uncertainty and fear in her. She started scared, insecure, and very ignorant.  As the story progresses she finds love, learns the truth, and finds strength in having her own mind.  Alex, an Invalid, was born in the Wilds and moved around a lot.  He falls in love with Lena, forcing her to rethink everything about herself, essentially a mild identity crisis.

B001PA0FFO|5.0|I loved this movie so much I wanted to have a copy to see whenever I felt like it. Meryl Streep and Phillip Seymour Hoffman were at their finest and Amy Adams did a remarkable job too. I am so very glad I own this movie. It is a challenge to anyone who has doubts and good to watch from time to time to renew vision of what can be better.
B004J88SGC|5.0|\\"This is a concert celebrating the end of an Era: The Beatles Opened It (Shea Stadium, in New York), and Billy Joel (a Native New Yorker) Closed It.\\" (Qoute Was From back of dvd Package). This stadium, which opened in 1964, was the home for the New York Mets Baseball Team & their 2 World Series Championships. It was also a concert venue, for some of the biggest & greatest rock bands in the world, including the Beatles, The Who, The Rolling Stones, and Others. After this concert, the historic stadium was demolished. The entergy level and enthusiasm of the crowd, Billy Joel & his Band, & the Special Guest Artists, is simply \\"AWESOME\\". It is so good, words just cannot do it justice, you just have to watch it to believe it, feel it & experience it. The large, muti-level stadium is packed to capacity. This is definitely a concert that, no doubt, will go down in history as one of the best ever in the history of Rock & Roll!!!!
B004BLTNJI|5.0|I had seen Coraline in 2D and thought that the story was just ok.  Not as good as Monsters Inc, Incredibles, or other top tier animated movies.  However, with the 3D version of the Blu-ray, my wife and I actually found we liked the story more than when we had watched this in 2D.    The 3D on this disc is up there with the very best to date.  I have watched almost all the currently released 3D Blu-ray discs including Avatar and Monsters versus Aliens.  This is a very well done 3D title.
B004097IKW|1.0|The lighting technician single-handedly destroyed this DVD.  With the exception of the faces, everything is immersed in hellish blue.   He (she) got paid regardless of performance, and obviously did not give a damn.   He needs to find another line of work.   It is disgustingly unfair to the performers who did their best.   Why did the director put up with it?  This was 2009.   Technology has open the door to visions from an earlier era.  With an imaginative director, this could have been an excellent DVD.   This shortcoming never should have been allowed to happen.    The role of Arturo fits Juan Diego Flores like a glove, especially vocally.  Nino Machaidze is a convincing Elvira, and has great chemistry with JDF.  The JDF-Machaidze third act is unforgetable.  Nino is one to watch in the future.  Besides her voice, she is beautiful and is a superb actress.  This DVD is ruined by the bulb technician and/or the director.  It is inexcusable to deliver such shoddy product in the 21st century.  The lighting/video is no match to the Met version with Anna Netrebko.  The difference has more to do with professional pride than budget.
B004529NLG|4.0|The movie is a cliché and the story is just terrible.  I can't imagine that anyone likes this plot other than teenage girls who find the lead cute.      The 3D however is outstanding and the dancing is really fun to watch.  This is a good example of 3D Blu-ray if you are looking for something to watch in the format.  My wife really enjoyed this title because of the modern dance.
B000YJ54DU|1.0|After finishing \\"Nothing To Lose\\" I'll add my disappointment to the long list of others. And it wasn't easy to finish, either. I've read all of the Reacher series and this just missed the mark on several different levels. The insertion of Child's politics was an unnecessary distraction and certainly did nothing to enhance the story itself.    I suspect even ardent Reacher fans have been and will be shaking their heads asking \\"What happened?\\"    Caveat emptor.
B0043RSE2M|5.0|I bought this 3D Blu-ray having not seen the movie.  I did not have very high expectations, but I was pleasantly surprised.

The 3D was also really good and among the best of all 3D Blu-ray discs released so far (I have watched almost all the 3D titles out to date including Monsters versus Aliens and Avatar.
B001IF252C|1.0|I purchased this adapter for my HP Envy17 notebook to work with my HP LP3065 monitor to run at 2560x1600 resolution.  It failed to work at any resolution I set it at.  After plugging it in, it would first detect the new display, then cycle back and forth between finding and not finding the new monitor.  I would never really know if it could detect it or not, as the Screen Resolution window would give me strange connection options that didn't exist.  When I did get it to work, it would cycle between on and off every few seconds, flashing the screen as if I were plugging and unplugging it.  I spent a week trying to get it to work properly but without any success, even with my Macbook Pro 2.0.  I was very surprised that a luxury brand such as Apple would release a product with so many flaws.  It just plainly does not work the way you want it to.  I read multiple forums on it and it seems like few people actually get it to work the way they want it to.  I have since then replaced the product with an Accell version and it worked flawlessly out of the box.    http://www.amazon.com/Accell-B087B-003J-UltraAV-miniDisplayPort-Dual-Link/dp/B0030XMREG/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1300415253&sr=8-3    I'd avoid this product if you want something that works out-of-the-box.
B002ZG98UK|5.0|I have watched nearly all the 3D titles released to date including the bundled discs like Avatar and Monsters vs Aliens. I am not a fan of the Resident Evil movies, but I had a fantastic time watching this on 3D Blu-ray. The plot is mostly nonexistent, but the movie is really fun and thrilling in 3D on BD.  If you are looking for some good 3D material I would recommend this one.
0756404738|4.0|Kvothe the Bloodless, Kvothe the Arcane, Kvothe the Kingkiller. He is a legend but the real man is an enigma. A man named Chronicler is trying to find out the truth behind the legend by convincing Kvothe to tell him his life story, a task so long it will take three days to complete.      On the second day, Kvothe relates more of his time at the Commonwealth University, his ongoing feud with another student named Ambrose and his increasingly proficient studies in various areas. He also tells of his time spent in Vintas, serving a nobleman seeking to woo a lady, and learning the arts of combat in far Ademre. But how much of Kvothe's story is truth and how much is his own fabrication?    The Wise Man's Fear is the sequel to The Name of the Wind and the second in The Kingkiller Chronicle trilogy. Since the trilogy was originally one extremely long novel split into three parts, The Wise Man's Fear has little preamble and not much of the climax. It starts, we follow the story for a time, and then it ends with little resolved. For a novel that is 1,000 pages long in hardcover, that should be a fairly damning comment.    Rothfuss's saving grace is his immense writing skill. He could make the telephone directory sound warm and interesting, and whilst the book is extremely long most of the chapters are short and snappy. The narrative is divided into two distinct sections, basically Kvothe in the University and Kvothe out in the world, and these sections are themselves fairly episodic. Whilst Kvothe's hunt for information about the Chandrian, the mysterious creatures that killed his family, provides a narrative spine of sorts, sometimes dozens of chapters pass without this plot element being as much as mentioned.    As a result The Wise Man's Fear feels less like a novel and more like a collection of tightly linked short stories (a feeling added to by the fact that one episode in the novel, The Road to Levinshir, was previously published as a separate short story almost a decade ago). This dichotomy - a very episodic book presented as a single novel - creates problems for pacing and consistency, with some of the episodes and stories being fascinating and others being tedious, whilst several more interesting-sounding incidents (like Kvothe standing trial for a misdemeanour) are skipped over in a couple of paragraphs. The Name of the Wind suffered from this as well, such as the incongruous and dull draccus incident towards the end of the book, but due to its much greater length The Wise Man's Fear is even more prone to it. Kvothe's dalliance with a famous Fae temptress goes on for far too long and winds up feeling a bit like the porn version of Tom Bombadil, whilst Kvothe's training montage with the Klingon Aiel Dothraki Vikings of the far north-east is just plain dull. Those who found Kvothe insufferable and Gary Stu-esque in the first novel will likely plain hate him here, as he picks up a ton more skills (including unarmed and armed combat, more magical skills and several more languages) with ease.    But Rothfuss does seem to be more overtly pulling the wool over the reader's eyes here. Kvothe reports on his badass fighting skills but then in a 'present' incident is unable to effectively defend himself from attack. Is this because he overrated his combat abilities, or because he's rusty, or because he deliberately holds back? The reader is invited to decide. Anomalies in Kvothe's story are also pointed out by Chronicler, and Kvothe admits to occasionally sprucing up his story. He's not exactly an unreliable narrator on the scale of Severian in The Book of the New Sun, but Rothfuss is at least letting the reader know that Kvothe himself might not be the best person to tell his tale, but he's all we've got to go on.      Elsewhere, plot elements are carefully alluded to rather than being spelt out, such as the motivations and identity of Denna's mysterious employer, or the relationship between Kvothe and a minor character that Kvothe himself is totally oblivious to. There is an impressive degree of subtlety running through this brick-thick tome that will no doubt raise questions and discussions that will keep fantasy forums busy until the final volume is released.    Rothfuss's powers of prose and characterisation remain highly impressive. The writing is rich and atmospheric, setting the scene perfectly, and Rothfuss has a keen eye for detail, humour and warmth (though in this book slightly more undercut by bitterness and cynicism), but those hoping for the story to explode into life, become bigger and more epic, will be disappointed. In a way Rothfuss is writing an anti-epic fantasy, with the focus narrowly on one character and the ordinary events that have been inflated out of all proportion. This forces the reader to keep downplaying expectations, since Rothfuss isn't playing the same game as a lot of other epic fantasy authors.    The Wise Man's Fear (****) is a difficult book to review, as it's well-written, sometimes compulsively page-turning and features some extremely well-played and subtle storytelling. On other, briefer, occasions it's tediously dull, cloying and prone to attacks of purple prose (particularly in the frisky fairy section). The book is also monstrously overlong and could have been split into two or three more focused, shorter books without too much of a problem. But Rothfuss is too good a writer to let the book's many issues sink it, and the book ends with the reader left wanting to know what happens next, which is the key thing. The novel is available now in the UK and USA.
B003Z2LAAO|2.0|The 3D isn't all bad, but if you are looking for some 3D material for the sake of 3D Blu-ray this is not it.  Yes there is 3D and some short shots look decent, but all in all the 3D is poor and the story is even worse.  I watched half the disc and couldn't make it through... put it on eBay and got it out of here.  I am an environmentalist, but the doom and gloom and preachy story about water conservation was just over the top and incredibly lame.  IMAX could have at least made the visuals good, but they failed on this as well.  Don't buy.
B003D5A42S|5.0|I would have to say that i was pretty impressed with this cd by Asking Alexandria. They do a decent job of mixing up the synthesizers and vamping effects while staying pretty true to the screamo and hardcore roots. I would have to say to me they sound like a 50/50 mix of Attack, Attack! and Bring me the Horizon. I love this cd and can't stop listening to it.
B00000JQFM|5.0|Surfing with the alien is by far one of the best instrumental rock albums out there. The creativity and use of melody, combined with Satch's ever present groove, make this an excellent cd to add to anybody's collection - regardless if you are a guitarist or not. 5 stars for total creativity and awesomeness!!!
B0043GN6XK|5.0|There are extensive reviews here, which I second and concur. The playing of the orchestra under Biondi is fantastic, with its usual very sharp and brilliant playing. The soloists are excellent throughout. Initially I had hesitations towards Villazon as a baroque singer but I increasingly liked it and now one of his arias on here is on of my all time favorites. In fat, ever since I bought that CD this is basically what I am listening to (a few weeks already). And it made me curious for more. Highly recommended for all who love Vivaldi anyway and also for those who want to go beyond the four seasons...
0307454541|4.0|Now I'll admit, there was so much hype over this novel (more so because of the movies, I think). I decided to give it a shot, falling for the hype. The book starts out rather slow and continues that pace for quite some time (and recurs off and on throughout the book). For me, that was the only downside to the entire book.<br /><br />Lisbeth Salander instantly grabs the reader and makes you want to know more. There is so much to her life and even by the end of the book, you are left with a desire to know more about her and to see where her life will lead.<br /><br />Larsson builds a strong base for his characters and has given them so much personality that they seem almost alive in the ink of the pages. Salander is filled with secrets and a strong disdain for the world in general. Blomkvist shows that not all journalists have lost their integrity, something very hard to come by in the industry today...<br /><br />Their separate tales mesh together in such a natural way. The writing style is smooth and easy to follow. The mystery behind it all keeps you guessing until the very end. Larsson knew what he was doing when he wrote this book.<br /><br />Courtney Conant<br />[[ASIN:0615439403 The Blood Moon of Winter (Land of Makayra) (Volume 1)]]
B002XTBE6K|5.0|This is the best version of Emma that I have seen.  Both Emma and Mr. Knightly are portrayed best in this 2009 remake.  The chemistry between Romola Garai and Jonny Lee Miller is captivating and Michael Gambon is perfect. Far better than the Gwyneth Paltrow movie.  I'm not overly concerned about whether the book was followed exactly, I've yet to see a version that does that perfectly.
030726999X|4.0|With so many characters, it was a bit more difficult to follow than the first two in the series. There were also many side stories to try and follow and keep straight. However, it didn't matter how many characters or stories there were, the book was great!<br /><br />As a computer nerd, I found a bit of the information provided to be false. I was able to overlook it though, knowing it was only a tale and that there is such a thing as too much information. That being said, Lisbeth truly is a unique character and a phenomenal hacker. Larsson really did his research quite well.<br /><br />Larsson tied up almost every loose end in this final piece of the trilogy. The only bit I'm left wondering about is this; where is the twin sister? That is one piece of information that was never answered and I fear we will never know...<br /><br />Kudos to Stieg Larsson for creating such an amazing series!!<br /><br />Courtney Conant<br />[[ASIN:0615439403 The Blood Moon of Winter (Land of Makayra) (Volume 1)]]
1439102724|2.0|Okay, so I've never written a review for anything before but I felt extremely compelled to do so after reading \\"Sing You Home\\".  And warning, this turned out to be very long and there are spoilers after the first paragraph.    I've read all of Jodi Picoult's books and have enjoyed each one immensely; I pre-ordered \\"Home\\" a few months ago and began reading it at once, only to soon (not even a quarter in) begin to question on whether or not to continue. \\"Home\\" is a novel completely deficient in every way. Compared to all of Picoult's novels, the characters are horribly flat and two-dimensional. I feel as if someone, an agent or whomever, suggested the topic of gay marriage and what it entails to Picoult because it's a \\"hot topic\\" currently, not that she was actually interested in it. The book lacks passion and interest - it reads, at times, like a medical text book. I'm a socially liberal person and had no qualms with the lesbian relationship but I can see how more conservative people would throw the book down at once with its main topic and slander to religion and conservatism. I only continued to the last page because I harbored the hope that I would come across one of the mind-blowing and shocking endings that are always provided in Picoult's other novels. I was also sick on vacation and didn't have a lot else to do.    (Spoilers)    The relationship between Zoe and Vanessa occurred much too fast - three months of \\"dating\\" and then getting married? - the timeline that the relationship followed boarded on the implausible, as well as Max's sudden and overzealous devotion to religion. The \\"relationship\\" between Max and Liddy was so forced I found it contrived and only thrown in to add in some extra plot. The only mildly interesting character was Lucy who was, still, undeveloped.    I actually forgot that Zoe had cancer and the D&C (a term that was never defined), as it was mentioned in maybe one or two sentences early on and then in the trial at the end of the book.Once again, an arbitrary scenario added to the book that was then promptly forgotten.  In general, I throw myself into the books I'm reading and found myself, while reading \\"Home\\", to not even care that Zoe couldn't conceive, which was the sole motivating factor in the plot. Her desire to have a child was almost freakish, not backed by any credible reasoning on her part. She was willing to abandon her relationship with a husband of nine years, who went to hell with her and back, just because he could no longer handle her life-threatening pursuit to have a child. I found Zoe unlikable due to her psychotic pursuit to have a child.    As for Vanessa, I felt neutral about her and at times, sort of liked her. But the attraction between her and Zoe just wasn't there; it was not palpable enough for me to believe or invest myself in their relationship. Vanessa, as with Lucy, was one of the more developed characters in the book, yet they both seemed to measure up a bit too short to be realistic. Vanessa's quick decision to marry Zoe and agreeing to have her (and Max's) child was decided in a split second, although she had never considered having a child before in her life. Just plain unrealistic.    Max was the most underdeveloped character, with no real background story or personality. He suddenly decides to divorce Zoe, gets plastered and into car accident, finds \\"god\\", and falls in love and sleeps with Liddy, all in the short span of a few months. He was the puppet behind Pastor Clive that added in the \\"drama\\" of the law suit in the book yet his chapters became increasingly boring. I would have loved to have Lucy as a main character with her own chapters. The big Picoult \\"shocker\\" in the end of Lucy being the pastor's daughter rolled right over me. There was no explanation behind why Lucy said that Zoe had an inappropriate relationship with her or if it had been fabricated by her stepfather.     I found the different character's chapters to be very similar in style and narration, and at times I had to double-check who I was reading - there was no huge difference in the way Max spoke versus Vanessa versus Zoe. I kept hoping for something interesting to happen. Oh, I don't know, Liddy getting pregnant with Max's child or someone dying - anything to enliven the incredibly dull plot that ended with the most disappointing and boring chapter I've read in a Picoult book.    The chapter of \\"Samantha\\", the daughter six or so years later, which was oddly written in third-person when all the other chapters were in first, was a letdown, considering it was the end of the novel. The references to Max being a part of her life seemed far-fetched (as he made such a big deal out of not wanting to be a dad and Vanessa's intense hated of him) and that he was marrying Liddy, once again, painfully unbelievable. I am so disappointed (maybe too much) in this novel. After \\"House Rules\\", which I loved, as well as all of Picoult's previous works, I can hardly believe anyone would have published this, and probably only was due to a contract.    To wrap up this overly long review, the book was contrived with underdeveloped characters, stylistically stunted writing, and lacked any real excitement that can be found in Picoult's earlier works.
030745455X|4.0|What a tale and what a continuation of the first book!<br /><br />I must say that the start of the book was so confusing. By the time I was almost finished reading, I had completely forgotten about the beginning. It wasn't until I started the 3rd that I realized what the beginning of the 2nd book was referring to. I didn't like that at all but was able to forgive the author because the rest of the book was so great.<br /><br />Following Salander along another trek of mysterious ordeals, as well as more insight into her past, completely engulfed me as a reader. I was so engrossed in this novel that I forgot to work on my own!<br /><br />Lisbeth's story is so much more indepth and continues to grow more troublesome throughout this book. I went crazy just waiting to find out what 'all the evil' was and so will you!<br /><br />Courtney Conant<br />[[ASIN:0615439403 The Blood Moon of Winter (Land of Makayra) (Volume 1)]]

B0043RSJ8G|5.0|I spend a lot of time commuting and listening to GOOD books helps me through all the traffic jams.  This was not a GOOD book - it was FABULOUS.  Jodi Picoult is well known for not shying away from controversial issues. This latest novel is no except and will surly evoked strong emotions for her readers as it did I.  The story is told in alternating `tracks' from the points of view of three primary characters; Zoe, Max and Vanessa.  It deals gay rights, evangelical Christian beliefs, in vitro fertilization, suicidal teens, divorce and discrimination.  I could not turn it off  - I kept trying to figure out the ending and it wasn't until the last 10 minutes did I figure out part of it.  Well done Jodi!
1401917232|5.0|Not only is there no book, Gary's or otherwise, there is no Gary either in reality.No book was ever written, there was never anyone writing books, neither was there or is anyone ever reading books.    The mind, waiting for a new spiritual book in eagerness to learn about new spiritual insights is caught in another of Ego's tricks. It keeps the mind focused on the future, on more, on better, on 'out there' endlessly.    If the mind takes a stand either for or against the wait, for or against Gary, it is caught in the trap that the Ego has set.    Join with the Holy Spirit now,because right here is where freedom lies.  You already have the means given you. Be still and observe, with the Holy Spirit, the various manipulations of the Ego. In that very observing is the energy, the drama, the trap of the Ego dissipated.
B002ZG981E|1.0|This movie is a perfect example of how easily the mindless viewing public can be duped into thinking they're watching something deep, meaningful and intelligent when if fact, it's nothing more than fluff. The Matrix movies were deeper, more meaningful, and weren't any more intelligent than your average episode of Wizards of Waverley Place. The acting is ok. I actually do really enjoy Leonardo's acting. The effects are shiny, but empty, like a toilet, but ultimately they're full of crap. I am obviously not a fan and I'm glad of it. Blah!
0545265355|5.0|These books are a great quick read...if you need something to take your mind off of everything else these books will do it. At times you feel like the books are too young for you to be reading but with Collins mix of the dystopian society plot with her characters you end up feeling like you got something out of it. I would recommend these books for people of all ages, but mainly for the beach, vacation or a plane rides...
031603438X|5.0|The advance press on Keith Richards' bio was that it contained little more than catty comments about Mick Jagger.  I am so glad I disregarded these superfluous reviews, because this book is one \\"effing\\" good read.  I use that term because Richards does it with astounding frequency.  His recipe for bangers and mash, one of the funniest things in the book, would make Fannie Farmer's hair stand on end.<br /><br />As previous reviewers have stated, I am amazed at Richards' recall of the most minute events. Recollections from his colleagues and family members only enrich an already comprehensive autobiography.  I would have liked to have learned more about the Stones during the late 1970s and early 1980s. I could have done with a bit less on the drug abuse, but this content is prevalent; it was a huge component of Richards' lifestyle, and it was probably cathartic for him to write about his ultimate survival.<br /><br />Throughout the Stones' history, so much of the focus has been on the staggeringly charismatic Mick Jagger. It's about time that Richards has shared his life with us.
B000YIGNKE|5.0|It's been a while since I watched this TV adaptation of Jane Austen's last (and maybe more personal) novel, \\"Persuasion\\".   And I watched it last night, I fell in love with it all over again!      First of all, the story is absolutely breathtaking. Jane Austen wrote it when she was dying, so the novel became a kind of race against time. But the style is really fantastic. The story is about 2 people , Anne Elliot and Captain Frederick Wentworth, who unexpectedly meet again after being separated for eight years. Eight years ago, Anne and Wentworth fell deeply in love with each other (\\"there were no two hearts so open\\") but as Wentworth had no money and nothing to recommand himself, Anne's father and Lady Russel, Anne's deceased mother's friend, persuaded Anne to refuse his proposal, on account of Anne being too young and of Wentworth being pennyless.   The story starts in this adaptation when Captain Wentworth successfully returns to the country from the war, having made a fortune in the Navy, with the intention of living peacefully and of finding a wife. They meet again unexpectedly when Anne's father, a heavy spender has to let the family house, Kellynch Hall, to the Crofts who happen to be closely related to Wentworth.   Anne has never forgotten Wenworth and although she has received other proposals from elligible men, she is still unmarried at the age of 27 and still regrets having refused to marry Wentworth. He, on the other hand, shows he has never forgiven Anne and looks determined not to renew any kinds of relations with her...   For me, this adaptation beautifully recreates this wonderful love story! Even if you are not convinced by the performances of some actors, the mere presence of the two leading actors, Rupert Penry-Jones (Spooks) and Sally Hawkins (newcomer)is enough to make you fall for this new version. They are simply fantastic. Sally Hawkins is perfect to me as Anne Elliot! I like the idea that we are in Anne's head and all the film is based on herpoint of view. I think the director and the producers have managed to keep the spirit of the book as we can have a glimpse of Anne's inner world and share her pain, her hopes and what she thinks of the people around her. Sally Hawkins has a very mesmerizing voice. It is impossible not to feel moved by her in some way. The camera revolves around her and seems to reinforce her solitude and her sadness. It also shows people from her point of view which might be disconcerting the first time we see the film as there are many close-ups of the actors. With Rupert Penry Jones, SH forms a very good-looking pair. There is such a chemistry between them that every scene with them is a delight for me.   Rupert Penry Jones just takes my breath away. He embodies Captain Wentworth to the perfection. I know he looks young for the part but even in the book, it is mentioned that while Anne has lost her bloom, he hasn't changed much all these years. I don't how to explain it but every time he enters a room, he is utterly dashing, I can't help saying to myself 'God, he has so much class!'His big, blue eyes staring at Anne with cold anger are enough to make me shiver with delight. Another reviewer, Mim (I think), said that Wentworth was aware of Anne both in and out of her actual presence. And I agree with that. Rupert's acting gives me the impression that even when she 's not present, he can't help thinking about her. Even when there are many people around them, they are so \\"aware\\" of each other that you  can't help feeling the bond between them. The two of them are so good together that it's mesmerinzing to watch their scenes.   The music is lovely, haunting and adds to the solitude of the heroine. The landscapes are worth noticing, of course.   Yet, I admit that this TV film still has some flaws, mainly with the script. There is some nonsense in some lines (Louisa and Wentworth talking about Anne and Charles Musgrove) and two or three dialogues, especially the one with Anne saying that women love the longest, aren't placed at the right time. The ending feels too rushed, and although I actually enjoy the race scene and see the symbolism of that scene, the scenes or shall I say -moments- when Anne goes / runs after Wentworth are really too fast-paced!    It also took me a long time to appreciate the performance of the other actors. But the more I watch this TV film, the more I enjoy the presence of all the actors.   Despite these flaws, it is definitely a 'must see'. Just don't stop at one viewing. Even after three or four viewings, I realize that there are still many little details (about the symbolic of some scenes) that escaped my notice before. This adaptation is a romantic film for all generations! And maybe the two leading actors can entice you to read the novel or re-read it.
B004DMIIVO|4.0|Other than the works of Miyazaki, I don't see a lot of Japanese animated films. I was in the biz when they started to break and, as exciting and eye-popping as they were at the time, they wore thin pretty quickly. There were always the exceptions such as 'Ghost in the Shell' et al but I just grew tired. 'Summer Wars' received really good user reviews and the story outline seemed interesting so I thought I'd give it a go. I'm way glad I did.    Here's the scoop. OZ is the new, ultimate web-site where anyone can do almost anything. It's used by individuals and governments alike. It's been inadvertently hacked into, and compromised by, a math geek who has unwittingly unleashed an AI construct that is fouling up the the whole thing.  To boot, while all this is going on, said math geek has been tricked into playing his female acquaintance's fiance at granny's 90th birthday at a huge family mansion out in the country. The party is populated by the entire clan and they're a diverse, wild bunch. Can the math geek save the world and find true love?    There are a couple of other sub-plots involving a high school baseball championship, a particular card game and a black sheep cousin. It's the way the movie juggles both the main and sub-plots that puts it high on the quality scale. The animation is OK. The production design is a bit uneven. OZ is pretty cool with a great design and color palette. Some of the real life sets a very good, others are pedestrian. The character designs are OK but don't reach a level that you haven't already seen elsewhere, and some of the facial expressions don't reach beyond TV grade Anime. That being said though, overall, this is still one of the better looking pieces you'll find out there.     I had a great time watching this. I liked the story, the characters and the pace. At 2 hours I was not at all in a hurry to get things over with. The final scene is more than a bit too cute but by then, the movie was over so what the heck. I can't put thisup with any of the Miyazaki films but it's still really good. If you like this sort of thing at all you probably won't be disappointed in watching this.
0143035711|4.0|I will buy this book because it has excellent reviews.  But I am tired of two things about Kindle.  (1)  Too many books are not available in the Kindle version.  To add to this, when they convert a book into Kindle format, they should do it right, instead of a half-jerk way.  (2)  Yes, I do think that the publishers are a bit greedy.  I'm not against staying in business that means it's necessary to make a profit.   But when the Kindle version is either as expensive as the hardcover (at discount places, but that should not matter) or more expensive than the paperback version, it makes me angry.  No overhead of stock, shipping expenses, etc....and then they want to charge ridiculous prices.  PUBLISHERS:  Get the message.  If it is not a superb book, I will not purchase it in Kindle if you charge greedy prices.  Now for the rest of you, if you bought a hardcover that had a binding that fell apart due to bad  binding design and construction, I'm sure you would inform us here in the \\"book review\\" so we AND the publishers would hopefully hear about it, so do not whine about a book review including criticisms of the Kindle version.  Where else could we provide informative information to you.  So if you don't like hearing it, get some ear plugs.  LOL  :)  I gave 4 stars because I will not denigrate the book's content, but am downgrading it due to the Kindle issues mentioned above.
B004AP09CU|5.0|We should be able to buy this on it's own.Instead in the dvd/cd pakage.The sound is updated and it really rocks.They really should put \\"the promise\\" and \\"don't look back\\" on this cd.The two songs added on would have made darkness a better record.
B000H7JCG4|3.0|I just finished this season and I have to say that I found it a little bit boring. I also thought the music was so generic that it was tacky. I was a big fan of the show when it was on the air and I am not going to give up on it. I started the second season and I already like it more. It is so interesting to watch the show as a very young adult and then watch it again as a middle aged mother. Man, that Brenda was a brat!! I am excited to get some of the other seasons on dvd and hope that the music gets a little bit better.
1440503257|5.0|I am not much of a cook, but every recipe I've made from this book has turned out amazingly!!  I got the cookbook as a present just before my second annual Harry Potter party and tried out a number of recipes.  They were all a huge success!!  I was so encouraged by the results that I continued to try new recipes even after the party.  Everyone that tried the \\"Hot Rolls\\" asked for the recipe and now I end up making them at every family holiday gathering.  One of the best things about the book is that a lot of the recipes can be made with ingredients I already have in the kitchen.  Plus, I found that some of the more fattening aspects of the recipes (the butter, the whole milk) can be substituted with healthier alternatives without much/any affect on the taste, texture, or quality of the food.      If you are a fan, this book is a fun tie in to the magical world of Harry Potter.  The descriptions of where each recipe appears within the Harry Potter series are particularly entertaining.  However, this cookbook is also great for individuals who are not fans.  I find myself flipping through the recipes for weeknight dinner ideas.  The boxes at the sides with tips and historical facts are also a nice touch.      While some reviews complained about the lack of 'iconic' food such as Butterbeer, I think the normality and diversity of the food makes the cookbook much more useful.  If you are looking for more recognizable Harry Potter foods as a supplement to this cookbook, there are tons of great recipes online.
B000SMWUPS|5.0|I ordered two of these Sunshine Kids buggy buddies because I love them that much.  They've been helpful for carrying a sippy cup and water bottle, along with my keys and cell phone.  The buggy buddies fit perfectly on one side of my handlebar for the Baby Jogger City mini double stroller, just as the straps also work well with handlebars of the Maclaren Techno XT stroller.  I'm able to leave the stroller accessory on each of my strollers when I fold them up for storage, and the buggy buddy has been durable. You can't go wrong with using this stroller accessory as a cup holder - there's room for two, and a middle compartment that can hold your keys, cell phone, or another small item.
160059672X|5.0|Just about two years ago, I took a class with Sherry Serafini in Southern California.  She mentioned that she was in the process of writing this second book, and that her goal was to make it very different from her first book with Heidi Kummli.  She has definitely succeeded!  While the first two chapters, which provide an overview of materials and stitches/techniques, are similar to her previous book, the new projects in this book make it a pure beading bliss!<br /><br />Since another reviewer already provided a list of projects, I won't also do so.  Instead, I will just say that each piece is just exquisite!  Each of the 25 projects focuses on bead embroidery, and pretty much all of them use a \\"cabochon as a focal piece,\\" as Serafini describes it in her intro to the book.  Some of the projects are more basic, while others are definitely for more advanced beaders.  If you are new to bead embroidery, I would suggest starting with some of the easier pieces, before moving on to the more challenging ones.<br /><br />In addition to providing a supply list for each project, there is also a pattern to trace for many of the pieces, each one of which is done in actual size.  This should make doing the projects much easier.  (I've done three of Sherry's kits before, and when they come with the pattern, it makes the project much more do-able!)  Her instructions look like they are as clear as they were in her previous book, and the close-up diagrams are well-paced at tricky parts in the instructions.<br /><br />The only negatives are that I only wish that the bead colors for the samples were listed, but I know that not all instructors do this in their books.  There is also no resource list for supplies at the back of the book, but there is a lovely gallery of pieces, all by other bead embroidery artists.  There are also additional photos of Sherry's pieces sprinkled throughout the book.<br /><br />The last great thing is that this is one of Lark's new hardcover books (like Marcia De Coster's, Laura McCabe's, and Diane Fitzgerald's new books), which make beading from the book so easy.  I hate having to fight with paperback books to get them to lie flat while I'm working, and this new hardcover series makes it a breeze to keep the instructions in easy view.<br /><br />Overall, this is a book full of eye candy!  If you're an admirer of Serafini's pieces, it's worth it just to even look at her beautiful work! Sherry is one of my favorite beading artists, and I'm so excited that her book is out early so I can start making some of these pieces!ia De Coster's, Laura McCabe's, and Diane Fitzgerald's new books), which make beading from the book so easy.

B004DWKO8Y|5.0|Mr. Big is an appropriate name for the group and BIG marks the sound.  Big vocals, big guitar, big bass, big drums. The match of Paul Gilbert's guitar with Billy Sheehan's bass is unparalleled.  Eric Martin's voice stands out and sound as good as ever, and Pat Torpey's drumming ties it all together.  Once or twice through the album and I was hooked.  Mr. Big doesn't sound like any other band.  Their sound is unique. Stellar musicians all, but with the ability to play together as a band combining strong melodies with great riffs and hooks.  A pleasant surprise and refreshing surprise in an overly packaged market.
B0025KVLTC|5.0|The Beatles definitely continued their reign as the best song-writers of the 20th Century with Revolver.  It has the popular favorites Yellow Submarine and Eleanor Rigby, but every song on the cd shows their tremendous range of musical talent.  Paul contributes several great songs, including one of his most under-rated ballads Here, There and Everywhere.  John really pushes the boundaries with She Said She Said and Tomorrow Never Knows and keeps his groove on his other tracks.  George even contributes his catchy middle-class anthem Taxman and the Indian-inspired Love You To.  The more I listen to this album, the more I like it, especially the deeper cuts like I'm Only Sleeping, And Your Bird Can Sing, For No One and I Want to Tell You.  This is a definite must-have for any Beatles fan, and it is a great cd for anybody discovering the Beatles for the first time.
B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|The amazing thing about Dr. Who is that each successive season has somehow managed to be more impressive than the one before, even though the bar was set very high with the first series. Series Four does not disappoint. The mouthy Donna Noble from \\"The Runaway Bride\\" Christmas episode at the head of Series Three is brought back as a full time companion. Catherine Tate does an amazing job at fleshing out the character of Donna and providing an excellent moral foil for The Doctor, giving weight to some of his more achingly difficult decisions.  Nowhere is this better demonstrated than in the \\"Fires of Pompeii\\" episode when the pair arrive the day before the volcano erupts, burying the city for centuries. The Series Four writing is uniformly superb across this season. Russell Davies' claustrophobic \\"Midnight\\" is a darker, very confined group crisis that stands in opposition to the all stops out group disaster in \\"Voyage of the Damned\\" that starts the season off. Likewise, Stephen Moffet's two part \\"Silence in the Library\\"/\\"Forest of the Dead\\" may be the most perfect story ever written and ranks as my favorite story of the five new series that exist as of this writing. Intricate, frightening, and heartbreaking the writing and performances in this two parter are nuanced, deep and open up a whole new take on the both The Doctor's future and the notion of spoilers. And you will never look at a shadow or \\"the dust in sunlight\\" the same way again! Each viewing will see a new detail missed the last time.  And Davies' three part finale is nothing short of spectacular and featuring the return of many previous companions and one enemy.
B004G7FFF8|5.0|The complete piano works of Liszt consists of 99 CD's- all played by the remarkable Australian living in U.K. Leslie Howard.  My understanding is that Guiness lists this set as the largest recording project ever attempted by one individual in recording history. That should be no surprise. Until reading about this incredible collection of the work of Liszt I would have thought you could have complete Liszt piano works in about 15 or so discs.  I had no idea he was this prolific.  Not only did he compose this much and more, but the was the Elvis Presley of his age and has been called the greatest pianist/showman of all time.  Some of the music are transcriptions of lieder, symphonies, opera selections, etc. They were done so the average 19th century household with a piano could enjoy a Beethoven Symphony, a Schubert song, etc.  But even these pieces were done with taste and imagination.  Leslie Howard is a great pianist who claims he has the largest reportoire in history.  His playing has fire when reqauired and quietness when required.  Not all of the music is great- some pieces are mediocre. But this is even true of Back from time to time.  Most of the pieces are new to me- and probably everyone else.  Mr. Howard has done a great public service much as Fischer-Dieskau did when he recorded all of Schubert's 600 or so songs.  There are so many musical treasures that are never heard except through recordings like this one.  The Hyperion recording sound is superb, the budget price of the set is more than fair.  Overall, this is a must for any piano afficionado.
1400052173|4.0|An excellent read, but not an easy read. For those of us who usually read novels, there are parts of this that are a bit too scientific, but you can skip them.  The book could use a little better time organization.  Don't miss the timeline at the beginning of each chapter.
B003UESJHO|4.0|THE FIGHTER breaks no new ground as a film.  There are many films with the same theme ('Fighting Tommy Riley' is one of the best, but there are many others) despite the fact that this one is based on a true story. There is nothing to really fault in this film: it just doesn't quite live up to the honors and hype afforded it.  Writers Scott Silver, Paul Tamasy and Eric Johnson have managed to create dialogue and encourage accents specific to the Lowell, Massachusetts setting and their script has a steady flow that makes the film work.  David O. Russell directs a fine cast and makes the most of the secondary stories that take the film out of the ring and into the lives of the Ward family in a credible way.<br /><br />Micky Ward (Mark Wahlberg in a very sensitive, underplayed and under-appreciated performance) is the younger brother of Dicky Ekland - same mother, different fathers - (Christian Bale, gaunt and frighteningly real as a crack addict) who came close to the big time in boxing, a potential hero of Lowell, MA. Dicky is Micky's wholly unreliable trainer and the devotion between the two brothers is palpable.  The 'manager' of Micky's would-be boxing career is the boys' mother Alice (Melissa Leo).  Micky fights losing fight after losing fight until he meets a bartender girl Charlene (Amy Adams) who steers him away form the bad influence of his family - a move that allows Micky to begin to rise in the boxing ranks.  Dicky is imprisoned for multiple charges and gets clean and upon release works with Micky again to lead him to victory.<br /><br />The Ward family - including father George (Jack McKee) is a mangy bunch- the sisters are made up to appear as tacky as young girls can look and talk.  Melissa Leo is credible as the arrogant yet devoted materfamilias, Christian Bale is stunning in his portrayal of the pathetic Dicky, but Mark Wahlberg is rock solid as the quiet but committed fighter/brother/son. This is probably not a film to see twice but the first viewing is entertaining.  Grady Harp, March 11.  Grady Harp, March 11

0061998494|3.0|Ferguson is one of the funniest late night hosts ever. His book, however, is less comedic that what you could expect from such a funny guy. He basically shares the story of his life, including his alcoholism and earlier drug addiction. The book projects a humble Ferguson, very much willing to share his mistakes and to put his life story in a very down-to-earth context. This is not a boisterous book. Quite the contrary. It's not a page turner, and does not seem to be a brilliant work of literature. However, it transpires authenticity and is a very good read for anyone who watches Ferguson's show or has followed his career.
B0025KVLTM|5.0|Personally, I prefer my Sgt. Pepper transferred to CD-R where I can add as prelude the `Strawberry Fields Forever/Penny Lane' single--both songs originally intended for the album--and `All You Need is Love', by way way of a `Summer of Love' addendum. That, I think, makes for the greatest pop album of all time. However, I disagree with critic Ian Macdonald whose `Revolution in the Head' depicts `Pepper' as the apex of the Beatles' upward trajectory, with all that followed as a \\"coming down\\" stage. I believe that had the packaging of their subsequent material been different, the albums that followed--'Magical Mystery Tour', the White Album, `Abbey Road' and `Let It Be' would have maintained the Pepper standard. Further, I believe that that a 4-LP programming of the best of their 1970-1973 solo works as a Beatles release--let's call this box-set `Black Box'--would have been the greatest album/album-set of the 1970s. And that a similar 1973-1982 compilation would have been a musical highlight of the 1980s. And it wouldn't even have to stop there.
B001V9VE4A|5.0|I had to read this book for book club but all books were checked out of the library so I borrowed the Audio version. I normally prefer reading to listening but I had a deadline, and from the first syllable to the last, found myself mesmerized by the narrators' voices - specifically Bianca Amato - and I'm trying to find other books narrated by her. This is not my usual genre either, but again, I couldn't \\"put it down\\" so-to-speak. I was hooked. The story twists and turns, and I did not see some of the twists coming. I highly recommend the audio version. The richness of the prose, told to me by a voice so soothing, was like rich, warm cocoa, so curl up in your favorite chair, or tub, and immerse yourself.
B0025KVLUQ|5.0|In some more-worthy alternate reality, `Abbey Road' was not just a great album, but a gateway toward what could have been the greatest album-set of the 1970s--let us called it `Black Box', a 4-LP box-set consisting of the finest 46 tracks from what the Beatles recorded in ones or twos between early 1970 and autumn 1973.  This would have been the Beatles as more of a `conceptual group', recording separately but releasing together as they'd already done for an album's-worth of tracks including `Yesterday', `Julia', and `Within You Without You'.  And of course, `Black Box' would have been merely the first of what could have been six massive album-sets by the `Beatles Releasing Collective' in the decades that followed. As a social force, the Beatles may have folded in early 1970, but as a music phenomenon they continued, continued in the only way they could--as individual artists forged from a common template but also breaking free from it. Music-wise, it was never over. With `Abbey Road' in the can, they were just beginning the second half of their career.
B000A7DVR2|5.0|This is a great flick if you like off beat quirky comedies, especially Coen brother movies like \\"Fargo\\" or \\"Oh Brother, Where Art Thou\\".  This movie is probably not for the main streamers, but I loved it!
B0025KVLRO|4.0|If you want to fix upon Beatles genius from start to finish, you might want to select out the best from this album and leave the rest for completists.  If you want to listen to a continuation of Beatles genius past early 1970, you have to be VERY selective, much more so than for the 1960s Beatles.  Nonetheless, this album amply demonstrates that the Beatles were hedging their bets then, not entirely sure that it was a rock'n' roll future a la `I Saw Her Standing There' that awaited them or a variety act that would include mom-and-das favourites like `A Taste of Honey'. (Sort of like Paul later padding out his solo albums with something for everyone and every age group, thus driving rock'n'rollers crazy.)  With the solo Beatles, it was the reverse: only the occasional track was Beatle-ish and Beatleworthy and thus worth lifting and transferring to CD-R or iPod playlist. But these tracks do very much exist for each Beatle and there are 10-40 years-worth for each. These potentially constitute at least six superb Beatle(s) album-sets for the subseqent decades.
B003Q6D25K|4.0|I was very pleased with how quickly I received my order. My kids wanted this movie, we had already seen it at the drive ins.
B0025KVLVA|5.0|Who in their right mind would, by choice, listen to all the Beatles' albums through `Help', and THEN go through CD of `Past Masters' to catch up with the singles (and other tracks not included in the Beatles' works as officially repackaged)? No one. And same goes for the post-Help era on CD 2 of `Past Masters'.  If you want to listen through the Beatles' works in roughly the order in which they were recorded, you have to make your own CD-Rs or iPod playlists. Apple could have and should have made it easy , not difficult. They could have gone the `bonus track' route, adding the singles that came out just before or after an album either as prologue or addendum to each album. Like `I Feel Fine' and `She's a Woman' preceding tghe `Help' album. This would have made sense and made for a much nore enjoyable listening experience.  If Apple feared they'd be losing money by making redunadant the `Past masters' CDs, they could simply have upped the price on the `enriched' albums.  And no, we do not want to listen through the German versions of `She Loves You' and `I Wanna Hold Your Hand'. It makes you wonder about the sanity of those who insist that all of the 1960s Beatles canon--complete with German versions--is somehow automatically superior to the best of what John, Paul, George and Ringo did mostly-separately as of 1970. Because it ain't so. There's tons of stuff from their later years that's better than much of what they did more collectively in the 1960s. I say: make the best of the solo years an official completion of the Beatles' songbook.
B002QEXN2K|2.0|Only for the simple fact that Continuum knocked it out of the ballpark, this album for me was completely lackluster. Had this album been released as his second (after Room for Squares and before Heavier Things), it would have been better. But you can't release this type of material after a classic like Continuum, where every track is so demonstrative of your exceptional vocal ability, rich lyrical content and incredible guitar skills. Big disappointment and amateur-like from a talent like Mayer.
B004G5ZXVQ|3.0|R.E.M. has been one of my favorite bands since I discovered them on IRS: The Cutting Edge back when MTV played music. With every release, I found more and more to like about them. But something happened around the time Bill Berry left. From the last 2/3 of UP and up to this release, the time for being excited about a new R.E.M. release was pretty much over. While I found some gems in UP, REVEAL, AROUND THE SUN and ACCELERATE, there just didn't seem to be a cohesiveness or excitement about their new releases.<br /><br />While far from perfect, COLLAPSE INTO NOW is the best post-Berry album...bar none. They took what they learned from UP to ACCELERATE and put it all together to bring us this album. The result: some really good music mixed in with some inspired and dull tracks. But I'll briefly look at most of the tracks:<br /><br />Discoverer: The album opens loud with Discoverer and while I like the music, it is just Stipe barking lyrics once again.<br />All The Best: Song is OK...sounds like a leftover from New Adventures.<br />UBerlin: Eh...has some dreaminess to it but kind of blah.<br />Oh My Heart: I am still chewing on this one...has to be one of the worst sounding choruses that involved Mike Mills ever!<br />It Happened Today: The Crown Jewel of the album...THIS is R.E.M...reminds me of days past. The best song on the album. Love the wordless parts of the song.<br />Everyday Is Yours To Win: Nice little song...good indicator of where they came from and where they are going on their slower songs.<br />Mine Smell Like Honey: I like this one...nice, fast, and has a Life's Rich Pageant feel to it.<br />Walk It Back: Unremarkable but I do like the Mike Mills backing in this song. (let me say that I pretty much like anything Mills sings on...would like more Mills lead songs in the future like we had on OUT OF TIME.)<br />The Professor and Mary Ann (or AND THE REST): The rest of the album closes with a rocker, another nice song, a slower one and the odd but interesting Blue.<br /><br />One major nitpick is Stipe's singing...why doesn't he SING anymore...most songs are barking chants, disjointed phrases or even just talking. He CAN still sing (see their recent and awesome live album) but choses to sound lazy on a majority of the tracks here.<br /><br />I will say this about this and the last albums since UP. Listening to one in one sit through can be a chore but when I play them through a random playlist of R.E.M. songs, they blend rather nicely (even the weaker songs from AROUND THE SUN.) While we still haven't had the killer R.E.M. that I've been waiting on since Automatic for the People, this is their best effort since Berry left the group....why doesn't he SING anymore...most songs are barking chants, disjointed phrases or even just talking. He CAN still sing (see their recent and awesome live album) but choses to sound lazy on a majority of the tracks here.    I will say this about this and the last albums since UP.

B00275EHJG|3.0|This was not what I was expecting.  And what's with the creepy baby?!  Didn't they cover that already in the first one?  This movie was a little dark for my taste, tho it certainly did have it's sweet and funny moments.  But I will say this, the part where they were close to becoming actual trash towards the end was very eye opening.  I hope kids who see that will have a better understanding of how that process works and realize just how much waste we produce, including the toxins it contributes to the earth.  Similar to \\"Wall-E\\" in that sense.  Pixar still holds rank when it comes to animation!  THE Best

0060594888|4.0|Not including this book, I've read over twenty books so far this year on goal setting and personal development, which I've listed on my practicalgoalachieving blog (though I haven't gotten a chance to review all of them yet - my bad). So, anyway, as I was reading through this book (and especially as I was glancing through the table of contents), one thought has passed my mind: I could have spared my self hundred of dollars (perhaps even more) buying and reading all those self-help book and just buy this one.<br /><br />Not that this one is any better than the other ones I've read, but it's just that almost everything I've read in the other self-help and personal development boks can be found here. By the way: is it just me, or is it like that for almost EVERY personal development book you've EVER read? Reading the third, fourth or fifth book is just like reading the first book again (rephrased)?<br /><br />Anyway, back to the book: I actually wanted to give this book 3 and 1/2 stars, but since I can't do it with Amazon, I decided to round it up to four stars because, even though alot of this material is a repeat from material of other books (either that, or the other books are a repeat of the materials from this book), for the most part, it is useful... if applied.<br /><br />And that's the thing I want to stress, too: I go read these other reviews from other people and I see things such as \\"blah, blah, blah... same old stuff\\" or \\"... nothing new\\" or \\"... I know all this before\\". Here's the thing: Even though once in a GREAT while, something \\"new\\" comes out such as [[ASIN:1582701709 The Secret]] (which by the way... isn't really that new, either. \\"New\\" age, maybe. Other than that...), in general, there are only so many ways to say \\"you have to be persistent\\" or \\"you have to believe\\" or \\"take action (now)\\". And if these things are mentioned in not only this book, but in 1,735 other books as well, then... hmmm... maybe... just \\"maybe\\" you should listen to it. It's like smoking: If your parents tell you smoking is bad, if your teachers are telling you not to smoke, if your DOCTOR is telling you not to smoke AND if the SURGEON GENERAL tells you smoking causes cancer, well, then... I'll let you draw your own conclusion.<br /><br />So, the material in the book is in general, good, solid information, and if applied, it just might make some changes in your life. Nothing new, just solid information, and stuff you probably know before, especially if you've read other personal development books. Heck... your parents and teachers probably told you some of the things in this book.<br /><br />That being said, here's what I DON'T like about the book (or what I don't like as much): As I was almost halfway through this book, I really felt this book could have been waaaay shorter. He really stuffs this books with stories, which is not bad. It actually makes the book more interesting. But if you take away most of these stories (or skip them), you can still get the gist of this book. Also, it seems to me that (because this stuff isn't particuarly ground-breaking) any ghostwriter from e-lance or Odesk could have written this book (I wouldn't be surprised if at least some of this was ghostwritten).<br /><br />But here's the thing I want to say, also: Whereas alot of books write for either people who are into new age ([[ASIN:1582701709 The Secret]]) or for people who are more practical and into science ([[ASIN:007175346X Hard Goals : The Secret to Getting from Where You Are to Where You Want to Be]] or [[ASIN:1594630739 Succeed: How We Can Reach Our Goals]]), this book seems to address people of ALL interests: New Age, reality, people who just want to be \\"happy\\", people who want wealth, people who don't want wealth (but don't want to be poor), almost everyone you can think of, which is NOT bad, but when you do that, you run the risk of contradicting yourself, and there was at least one instant where that has happened.<br /><br />CASE IN POINT: In one section of this book, the author mentions about how her (or his) son (can't remember whose son it is) wants to be a rap star and even has his own website (by the way... I went on this website and it no longer existed). He loves rap and the author summarizes the section saying how, as long as you do what you love and are happy with what you're doing, you're already a success, regardless of whether you make money. In that sense, the author satisfied those who are in the \\"I just want to be happy\\" crowd. Very good. Nothing wrong with that.<br /><br />But THEN the author devotes an entire section about how to build wealth and accumulate wealth and even includes a quote from Wallace Wattles which basically says that, unless one is rich, one can never live a complete life and then gives various ways to get rich, such as joining a network marketing company, satisfying the \\"I want to get wealthy\\" crowd. But let's say joining a Network Marketing company doesn't make you happy?<br /><br />There are also other things I DID NOT particularly like (which doesn't make the book particularly bad):<br />(1) As is the case of many self-help and personal development books, the author does repeat himself (and herself) alot, such as affirmations, how to have vision, various ways to learn and even talking and listening to your inner voice (did I mention the authors tend to talk to a wide audience?). I kinda feel bad saying this, because even in my practicalgoalachieving blog, I repeat some things.<br /><br />(2) There was one section about learing to say \\"No\\". Now, this isn't quite bad. As a matter of fact, I myself should learn to say no more things happening in my life (maybe then I wouldn't be so stressed). However, if you do say no to someone, especially if you say no to someone TOO much (like your boss), you should be aware of the consequences (e.g.: you not getting promoted or not getting that pay raise because, you see, if you can say \\"No\\", then your boss can say \\"No\\" to your raise, also).<br /><br />(3) He talks alot about hiring a mentor, an accountability partner, a coach and forming a mastermind group. Now, even though I know the difference, I'm sure there are others (especially the \\"newbies\\" to self-help) who don't, and it would be nice to differentiate.<br /><br />(4) Speaking of \\"Masterminding\\": I have no problems with masterminding and do feel it is very helpful (surprisingly enough, I don't see too many self-help books address this topic enough, despite it's effectiveness). I do have a problem with HOW the author feels the mastermind should proceed (every mastermind should proceed with a prayer to God or The Divine or a Higher Being). OK... so what if one of the people in the mastermind group is an atheist? Should we kick him out of the mastermind group? Only religious/spiritual people allowed? Not to be funny or anything, but....<br /><br />There were other things, too, such as the book being too general in certain places (then again, it's already 400 something pages long). I do think it's kinda interesting how the author says, in the last chapter (or second to the last chapter) to buy several copies of the book and give it to friends and family (marketers: are you paying attention to this?) and to help them spread a movement.<br /><br />Like I said: NOT quite four star material. More like 3 and 1/2 stars (now I'M repeating myself).<br /><br />Despite all this, this book was not bad and despite the fact that it's long, it can be quite an interesting read (some of the stories are not bad, either). It's also an easy read, unlike [[ASIN:0743269519 The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People]] and [[ASIN:0380703041 Peak Performers]] (which the author actually mentions in this book).e section of this book, the author mentions about how her (or his) son (can't remember whose son it is) wants to be a rap star and even has his own website (by the way...

0061998494|5.0|I'm a fan of The Late Late Show, which is why I bought the book. If Craig Ferguson is that funny every night, then his life story must be a doosey. I thoroughly enjoyed its honesty and (at times) cheeky attitude.
0307272702|5.0|this is one of my fave books on this subject.  I read it becasue I was frustrated with my own weightloss.  After reading it, it became evident to me that eating fruits was what was causing my stall and failure to move forward.  Some of us have really sensitive bodies, the least bit of sugar, even fruit sugar can do a number on us.  I have been eating a protein high diet with veggies and have had no migranes for the past 2 weeks.  Amazing what we think is right for us is actually the worst thing we can do.  I have no cravings for sugar or sweets or fruits at all.  All I want is a damn good steak :)

B004BUIX2W|1.0|This album was a huge let down. Nicki Minaj shines when she is featured on other artists tracks however that edgy and creative side does not show up at all on this album. The best parts of this album are when Nicki Minaj is not rapping and another artist is featured, Eminem or Rhianna for example. If you are expecting this album to be anything like Nicki Minaj when she was featured in Monster on Kanye West's latest album prepare to be disappointed. I've listened to this album three times hoping it would improve the second or third time around and I don't plan on listening to it again.
030726999X|2.0|Stieg's Larsson's third book in the Salander trilogy is true to form in that the virtues and faults of the first two are sorely evident in this one: a couple of promising characters, a myriad of sensational devices, many examples of awkward language and syntax, stock characters, a plethora of examples of unnecessary detail and verbosity.  The book needs editing.  The characters are incompletely developed because Larsson's dialogue is inadequate in flushing them out, and their thoughts are seldom conveyed.  Moreover, the plot, while complicated and somewhat interesting, does not allow for adequate characterization because too much attention is focused on the vicissitudes of plot to the detriment of other elements of the novel.  In the final analysis, we are left with a thriller scenario featuring stock figures.  Even the seemingly captivating Lisbeth Salander is reduced to a caricature.  Her emotions or lack thereof suggest an automaton, someone merely going through the motions of life rather than living it with intelligence and humanity.  Whether as a result of the abuse inflicted upon her by the State and her relatives or her singular lack of imagination, she does not seize the moment to define herself in any other way than as a casualty of an oppressive world.  Thus is she neutralized emotionally, hollow and vindictive to a fault.  While one relates to her vengeance, considering her ordeals, in the end there is nothing laudatory about her; she is cold, isolated and angry - the consummate damaged goods.  One cannot imagine her becoming a mother, a wife or a lover.  She is the figurative feral dog, lurking in caves and empty buildings by day and seeking out corpses and offal at night.  She epitomizes the deadness of victimhood even as she wreaks revenge on others.<br /><br />While this may be what Larsson intended, it does not make for a satisfying novel.  Interesting characters are defined by more than their appearance, and while in the first book, we are intrigued with the \\"differentness\\" of Lisbeth Salander, by the third book of the trilogy, we want her to express herself so that we understand who she is beyond piercings, tattoos and spiked hairdos.  That she is a rebel is intriguing, symbolized by her \\"Goth\\" style, her lesbianism and exhibitionism, the hacking, and her martial arts expertise, but these attributes do not substitute for strong characterization unless they are integrated into her behavior, are organic, so to speak.  We need to know what she thinks, what she says and how capable she is of substantive interaction.  Otherwise she is just one more female thug on the subway,<br /><br />Sadly, Lisbeth Salander devolves into the boring, unimaginative roommate, wife or friend you can't wait to escape.  Perhaps some will disagree with me and argue instead that the woman is fascinating.  I admit I expected her to be as well since her likes are rarely the stuff of modern fiction.  We initially root for her because she offers the possibility of an unusual protagonist.  We think she might be interesting to get to know; we expect intelligent conversation and thought from her, but as the books wear on... and on and on... we realize she is merely a coffee imbibing shell of simmering rage and worse, a type rather than an individual.  Because she speaks rarely and appears to deliberate even less, we are not allowed a glimpse of personality that would compensate for the ordeal of slogging through a ponderously complicated, contrived plot.  Despite the mental acumen suggested by her ability to hack complex computer systems and the fact that she repeatedly outwits various attempts at  her demise, we are not privy to what she has done to achieve her freedom or her exoneration.<br /><br />Nor can  we fathom Mickael Blomkvist's allegiance to her unless it is a sense of compassion for the victimhood of the woman, the terrible injustice that has rendered her less than human.  Thus does Blomkvist emerge as the interesting character inthe series because he at least shows connections to others: his married lover, his sister and the Millenium staff.  In the same vein his dogged efforts on the part of Salander reveal a sense of justice on his part and a pursuit of truth, the journalist's professional goal.  Beyond the mere fact of his assistance and devotion to her cause, we cannot relate to his romantic interest in her because the author has not revealed her to be particularly interesting or lovable.  Her relationships are matter-of-fact, like hookups with a prostitute or paid escort rather than the give and take of conversation, touch and shared interests that one could argue are the touchstones of meaningful relationships.  Her personality remains static, robotic --  as flat and dismal as the abandoned brickyard her half-brother is holed up in or the mental hospital/prison from which she has emerged to reclaim her life and move on.  Lisbeth Salander does not move on but instead grows more inward and self-contained, as if to shed a tear or speak up to clarify who she is would doom her to further victimhood.  While we root for her to evolve, she does not, remaining rigidly static until the end.<br /><br />Likewise, I would argue that other characters are flimsy in their development - more stock than real, more banal than substantive.  Her half-brother, her father, the assassin, the attorney who defends her, even Erica, Blomkvist's married lover, are incompletely developed.  All the characters with the possible exception of Blomkvist lack depth and individuality so that we are left with a complicated scenario of depraved actions by various \\"types\\" or thugs, none of which elicits our imagination.  They are devices, mere facilitators of the mechanical infrastructure of this so-called thriller.  This is hackneyed fiction, nothing more.  I do not understand its appeal except that for some nihilism is indeed attractive.  Reading about sex and violence keeps one turning the pages; the ideas of conspiratorial government involvement and sexual deviance arouse a prurient curiosity on the part of some readers.  Yet however one defines his reasons for reading, in the end \\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest\\" is pulp fiction; its success is not driven by a desire for art.  The book does not evince a deft plot, interesting characterization, or themes about life and the human condition.  It does not motivate man toward higher leanings, increase his sensibilities or satisfy his curiosity about human behavior.  What is its redeeming value?  Is there any?<br /><br />No, this trilogy depicts a dreary social landscape that is wanting in imagination, compassion, femininity, vitality, and even intellectualism.  It is a flat book about flat people, similar to a \\"Lockup\\" episode on MSNBC.  One watches with fading interest a scenario of dead characters going through their mechanical lives devoid of meaningful human interaction or intellectual or spiritual stimulation.  Like vampires, these characters ooze their way through the human world, rarely imparting knowledge that would benefit others, mostly parasitic in their attempts in all arenas.  The exception might be Blomkvist whose enigmatic personality does not connote deadness but instead a voyeuristic curiosity about people and the world.  Too bad Larsson didn't develop him more; then maybe Salander, as a well conceived foil,  would have cut a wider swath in exposing us to the degradation possible in an unethical State.<br /><br />Finally, I would argue that the book is pretentious.  Clearly Larsson wants it to be an expose of injustice in Sweden as well as a commentary on the abuse and victimhood of women and children there.  This point nearly knocks one over the head with its insistency in the first book.  However, he drops that theme in the rest of the books and merely resorts to hackneyed subplots and the murky theme of victimhood to carry the day.  It doesn't work because Steig Larsson has made promises to the reader he simply has not kept.  In the end, Lisbeth Salander is just your boring, unimaginative Goth freak, not the girl of your dreams, the succubus you yearn for in a world reduced to the ordinary and the predictable, as most bad novels convey.  This book depicts the lives of people who merely slog on without a perspective on life and themselves.  Thus, one does not learn from this book; one survives it much as one does a persistent toothache.<br /><br />It must be stated here that it is never my intention to be completely critical in a review.  My goal is to clarify the book's attributes.  I do it here only because the book has been an international bestseller.  It has been touted.  Because there has been so much hype, I feel it is the obligation of the discerning reviewer to expose it for what it is: pulp fiction.<br /><br />Marjorie Meyerle<br />Colorado Writert and sexual deviance arouse a prurient curiosity on the part of some readers.

1439133948|1.0|This heavily padded, draggy novel might have passed muster as a novelet in the Vorkosigan series. The story finds Miles, visiting a foreign planet, discovering corporate dirty work (product failure, bribery, and political intrigue against Barrayan interests) and then - reporting it to the local authorities!  Move on folks, no terrifying doomsday crisis here!  The padding could have been lessened if the author had checked her impulse to bring out to the remote scene every character who ever played (and survived) a prominent part in any previous Miles story. First-time readers will not know who these people are, and are given little reason in this book to care.

B00005OM5I|5.0|I'm apparently one of the select few who believes Hell Bent for Leather is a severe and disappointing decrease in quality and a HUGELY overrated album in comparison to the previous four Judas Priest albums, so with *this* in mind, Stained Class to me shall always remain the very last exceptional album they made.      I guess it all comes down to personal preference- I believe Judas Priest is much much better at the epic progressive metal genre when  they used to spend considerable amount of time creating and building guitar riffs, solos and vocal melodies into something extraordinary, and much *less* appealing as a straightforward generic metal act that would (unfortunately) give them popularity and worldwide fame by the early 80's.    The opener is one of my favorites and without a *doubt* a classic.  \\"Exciter\\" contains an astounding vocal melody that even those who normally dislike hard rock/heavy metal would probably be able to appreciate just for the sheer catchiness of the vocal melody alone, and this is one example where I don't believe Halford is overrated for a single second because his performance just blows me away throughout the course of the song.  An easy highlight.  My second favorite happens to be track number two- \\"White Heat, Red Hot\\".  Same story- Halford steals the show, though featuring a biting guitar riff this time around.      The title song... yup, you guessed it, is my THIRD favorite song, haha.  I wish everything went in order!  Would make my life a *heck* of a lot easier.  AGAIN, it's all about Rob Halford and his vocal range.  This was truly the pinnacle of his career right here folks, on this very album.  Finally though, some of the actual guitar playing makes a noticeable appearance instead of me just focusing on Halford's unusual sounding voice and amazingly high and ghost-like vocal range all the darn time.      Where the guitar playing *truly* shines is on \\"Beyond the Realms of Death\\".  A lengthy guitar solo in the middle and it's layered beautifully- the rest of the album doesn't really contain these particular type of dark and haunting guitar solos and instead focuses on shorter and more basic ones.  This is definitely a sign the band was switching gears.  Anyway what might initially seem like a forgettable vocal melody will eventually become better.  I can't necessarily EXPLAIN how the vocal melody goes from boring to memorable, but perhaps paying close attention to the lyrics will do that to ya!    I used to hate \\"Heroes End\\" because of the line \\"Why do you have to die if you're a hero\\" because it sounds extremely corny for one thing, but more noticeably it's WAY out of place.  I've warmed up to it now it would seem, perhaps because I appreciate the verse melody leading into it.  \\"Savage and \\"Saints in Hell\\" are all about Halford's ruthless and aggressive vocal range, and these are two more highlights.  His vocals in \\"Better By You, Better Than Me\\" are somewhat softer and more melodic which is a nice touch.    Overall, Stained Class is a mighty fine Judas Priest album.  I highly recommend it.  It will go down as the very last classic Judas Priest album in my book before the band immediately became incredibly generic and disappointing just a short time later.
0984158480|2.0|It appears that the book was authored by various writers because grave differences in style, and depths of expertise and conclusions. It was supposed to have been written during the author's imprisonment, during which he was able to entertain visitors and make use of amenities such as a library. I would not be surprised, if he had made use of ghost writers.

I am keenly attune to the changed music environment and the lost element of the SUPER bands of yesteryear....think about it, how many are left? It's not just the online music thing...we've hit a trough in evolution as it pertains to music...delving into the background of Sammy's life and his involvement with VH...the detail, the history and the frankness make great reading!!!
B003Y74KCK|5.0|This is a good basic iphone case. I like the curved design on the back and it provides decent coverage to keep your iphone safe from scratches and drops. I wish the silicone was a little thicker so that it didn't feel so flimsy. I like that it has a circle in the back to see the apple logo, but it does get a little dirty in the crevices. I would recommend buying an additional screen cover on top of this. Overall its a steal for the price and what it offers you. everyone should put cases on their phones.
B003G8W0GK|4.0|Interesting enough for me to go ahead and buy season five. It is much better with Matt Smith. Finally, out of the doledrums and into fast paced, some intelectual shows for a change. No whining around here thank you very much. This Dr. is much better, but I still some re-hashed vintage Dr. Who in there. Must be stretching for stories even here.    I will say it is worth paying some money for but don't go overboard even here. Some good shows, some imagination and an active, action Dr. Not bad at all.

B003J27WFW|5.0|This will be most difficult in keeping this between 75 and 300 words as Amazon suggests, my Rush fandom far exceeds any other passion I have.  Though a newbie to Rush (Fan since 2004) I have come to love and constantly be inspired by the music they have and continue to create.  Though considering myself one of the die hard fans, this DVD was chalk full of personal interviews and recollections from Alex, Geddy, and Neil as well as friends and family over the years that provided insight into the band I thought I knew.  From inception to Living in the Limelight, Rush's story is beautifully illustrated through sound clips, photos, and video from years long gone, adding to the allure that Rush fans have so faithfully come to worship.  All the mystique and intrigue of the band are captured and fully realized; the directors do a fantastic job of instilling the fun playful nature that is reminiscent of the band members' relationship with each other.  It's especially fun to watch some of the bonus features (which the second disk is packed full of btw) in which Alex, Geddy, and Neil discuss personal hobbies and my favorite, their fashion throughout the years. :)  Packed with great bonus features and tons of extras, this is one DVD that will stay closer to your heart and reside lovingly inside your DVD player time and time again.
0316098337|5.0|I have to say that my favorite characteristic about this book is that it is completely told through dialogue between Ma & Jack and other characters, and the simple thoughts of Jack himself. There is no distinct narration, but I think that helps make the book so wonderful to read. I also read this at the same time as my boyfriend, Cory, and I'm sure he was just as excited to find out what happened as I was.     This book makes you think, it makes you wonder. Jack's only world is an 11 square room, but he treats it like a wonderland. He thinks that the main idea of life is to play. Why don't we all see the world like this? I believe that the world was made for playing. Not for working, or fighting, or any of these problems we're all dealing with right now. Jack is probably the one character I've ever read that has the purest heart. He understands why adults are so silly sometimes. But we don't get it. The adults in this novel think he is silly. I love how Donoghue brings out the true character of some reporters and hosts, who can't keep their mouths to themselves. Jack may have seemed reluctant at times, trying to go through Ma's Plan A & Plan B, but he would do anything for her. He loves her completely, and it's the greatest love I've read of in any novel. They are practically inseparable, and their love makes me wonder how Jack grows up in the Outside. I don't think there should be a sequel about it, but I do like to imagine it. I'd say that this is probably my favorite book ever, now. If you're looking through reviews, trying to decide if reading 'Room' is worth it, then take my advice and get yourself a copy now.     This book is simply both amazing and deep.   It's amazeep. That's a word sandwich.      -A

B002ZG99TA|1.0|There is only one thing I thought was unstoppable in the movie was the cussing. My Dad always told me why people cuss is because of their lack of intelligence to do any better. I thought Denzel Washington was a Christian!  How could a Christian even be apart of this film much less watch it or accept it? A Christian friend of mine told me it was good but after hearing 3 or 4 GD\\"s (God to dam someone) in the first fifteen minutes of the film I had to say \\"that's enough!\\" Some people say \\"well everybody does it and you cant escape it\\" maybe so, but one day we will all be accountable for what and how we dealt with sin Christian and non-Christian alike

0374290024|5.0|\\"Why The West Rules\\" is three studies in one: a narrative history of humankind from prehistory to the present, a quantitative description of how and why the West came to dominate the modern world, and a concluding speculation about mankind's prospects for the future.<br /><br />The heart of the book is a numeric \\"social development index\\" that is constructed by the author and quantifies a society's \\"ability to get things done.\\" It includes energy capture, social organization, military power, and information technology. Upon calculating and then applying the index to East and West respectively, Morris discerns the shape of history in several large cycles of advance and collapse where first the West (9,000 BC - 541 AD), then the East (541 AD - 1773), then the West again (1773 to the present) alternate in the lead; the East is projected to catch up and surpass the West in 2103. The graphs also show clear signals like the decline and fall of Rome (first centuries AD) and Song China (around 1100 AD). Although people can, and will, quarrel with everything about this index, Morris takes the reasonable point of view that anyone is free to improve on it. As a reader, I am stunned that it is possible to quantify social development so accurately, and so far into the past. Only time will tell if we are witnessing the first steps towards a \\"scientific\\" history, but Morris' book at least raises the serious possibility.<br /><br />Given the shape of history that Morris' index describes, the rest of the book attempts to explain it. Initial growth in the civilizational core, he writes, runs up against resource limitations and challenges from outgroups on the periphery, leading to successive cycles of collapse, reorganization, and regrowth. His description of the process makes it seem almost dialectical, although that is not a word that Morris himself uses.<br /><br />Morris is a geographical determinist for whom climate, natural resources, geographical barriers and connections for invasion, trade, and disease are causally decisive. Some people believe to the contrary that history is an irreducibly complex system, that is subject to unpredictable perturbations at all scales (the Butterfly Effect, Shakespeare's \\"for want of a nail the shoe was lost\\"). Many readers, including me, also want things like culture, invention, and personal initiative to play a much larger role in history. According to Morris, though, conditions determine ideas, and the most that \\"great geniuses or bungling idiots\\" can do is advance or retard the process: \\"Maps, not chaps\\" is Morris' formula.<br /><br />About the future, Morris writes that a geometric growth curve is not going to continue indefinitely. A century from now, there will either be a Kurzweilian Singularity (transcendence) or an Asimovian Nightfall (collapse), and according to Morris those are the only two possibilities; just muddling through is no longer an option, and in either case the former East and the former West will share a common fate. This is an extreme conclusion that does not seem to be well-supported by the rest of the book (although that doesn't mean he's wrong.)<br /><br />Full of insight and controversy, the punch and boldness of Morris' book are likely to set the terms of debate on this topic for years to come. Its lively writing and popular appeal deserve a large audience, and most people who are at all interested in macro history will want to read it.ease are causally decisive.

B004IJZFP4|3.0|Like the other reviews said...it's not the original, from the cover on down, but it's better than the long standing void. I guess I'll need to start the search for a good clean vinyl original. I do like the long version of Lotus but I am disappointed to find out that this whole disc was not what it appeared to be; a straight reissue plus bonus tracks. I guess the alternate cover was a clue? I'm not sure the Amazon description was clear about that.     I can appreciate John Bolin trying to keep his brother's legacy alive but some (many) of his archive releases have been questionable and make me wonder if he's in this for Tommy or himself. It's almost getting to the point of tarnishing rather than honoring the legacy.    Wasn't Nemperor, the original label, a subsidiary of WEA at that time, not Sony? Whomever it is, I hope someone can free the original someday.
B000PHN4HE|1.0|The language in this movie is horrible. The rating system in 1986 was obviously different than today's. The foul language is nonstop throughout the movie. Although there are some cute and funny scenes in the movie, it should be rated PG-13 or R for language.
1591843790|4.0|Unwittingly, Guy Kawasaki faced fierce competition on my bedside table.  I was in the midst of reading \\"The Greatest Hockey Stories Ever Told\\" by the finest writers on ice when I received an advance copy of Guy's latest book, Enchantment: The Art of Changing Hearts, Minds and Actions.  Guy and I met playing ice hockey and while I enjoy technology and marketing, my first love continues to be ice hockey.  How could I put down stories about flaming Zambonis and a cow being killed during the intermission of a Texas minor league hockey game for Guy's latest foray into the literary world?  (Well a deadline does serve to energize at times).    I recently asked Guy, amidst middle aged gasps for breath in between shifts of a pick-up hockey game, how many books he's written.  \\"Ten\\" was his response.  \\"How the hell do you find the time?\\"  \\"This is what I do.\\"  Simple as that . . . it is what he does.    More than just writing books though, Guy has delivered a thoughtful and at times inspiring and yet practical \\"guide\\" to understanding and hopefully harnessing the power of enchantment.  Enchantment shares the same readability and digestibility as two of my favorite books written by Guy:  The Art of the Start and Reality Check.  Its lessons are thought-provoking, personal, relevant and yet not aloof or overly academic.    Some highlights:  1) A mathematical formula for the perfect handshake  2) Swearing can be effective (which is good as I used the term \\"lame-ass product\\" recently during an Agile training I was delivering)  3) If Richard Branson personally polishes your shoe(s), you too would likely become a Virgin America customer for life  4) How the Grateful Dead promoted spreadability (and to think I thought it was an attraction to drugs)  5) Taming Dr. Doolittle and the beast of the pushmi-pullyu (my words, not Guy's - he deals with push and pull technology)  6) How to suck up to your boss.:)  Actually things like responding ad nauseum, overdelivering and the like.  (What I'd really like to know is how to do this when your boss is a narcissistic, paranoid douche-bag - but perhaps that's another book).    Enchantment may come across as new age'y with it's origami butterfly cover, but it speeds down the ice, mucks it up on the corner and ferociously elbows all other books off your nightstand . . . and does it in the nicest and most enchanting way!
B000EWBNMS|5.0|My partner and I love Medium. Patricia Arquette is a incredibly gifted actress and the show benefits enormously from this. The stories are intricate, multi layered and interesting. Each episode is like a mini film, neatly tied up at the end with all answers revealed. The family set up is beautifully detailed and all the characters are believable, down to earth and likeable. I would say Medium is one of, if not, my favourite tv programme. I'm glad I discovered it because it's relatively little known in the UK, for reasons I can't begin to fathom because the show is fantastic.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|I watched the whole three hours cause i could not find myself to turn it off. I found it very good and done really well. Amanda Price is in love with the book Pride and Prejudice and ends up switching places with no other than Elizabeth Bennet thanks to a portal in her bathroom. She gets stuck in the world of austen and everything goes all twisted. I won't say what but it seems that Jane Austen would have to re-write the book with all them changes. I must say that it was cool seeing Elizabeth Bennet with short hair and wearing modern day clothing, not to forget seeing Darcy in present day London as well. If your a Jane Austen fan like I am, then for sure you will enjoy this film with big twist from the orginal Pride and Prejudice.

B004FGMV0W|1.0|Always trust your instincts. When I heard Avril was coming out with a new release, I thought great, it's been a while, it'll be good to hear some new punky rock. Then, I saw the video for \\"What the Hell\\". Sounding almost exactly like \\"Girlfriend\\" from her last release, I couldn't believe it. Instead of coming up with something new & rockin', we get her ripping off her own song!...which she pretty much ripped off of another artist from the '70's. Anyway, I thought what a piece of %@$#. I'm getting really sick & tired of the \\"cheerleader\\" beat crap. I really hate this song. Funny how it sounds just like the new Miranda Cosgrove also...another piece of cheerleader crap. So, I thought I would go against my initial big diappointment of \\"What the Hell\\" and decided to give this release a shot. I swear to God, this is one of the WORST albums I have EVER heard! I kid you not, I couldn't even make it through 1 of the songs, this thing SUCKS! She should've listened to hear record label and released a rock album, instead we get this horrible snoozer. Grow up and start rocking Avril.....having trouble getting to sleep?.....just put this thing on. IF you wanna really great album that BLOWS AWAY this loser, pick up \\"Joy\\" by Fefe Dobson. Can we all say Avril who???

B004QK5N5W|4.0|On the iPad 2, this product works exactly as described.  It's easy to use, and provides excellent mirroring of whatever content is on your iPad 2 screen.  By default, this item transfers video in 4:3 format.  However, if you go to your iPad 2's settings menu, you can easily change this to 16:9.  Mirroring is not supported on the original iPad, or the iPhone or iPod touch.      In my previous review I rated this product with 1 *.  Perhaps I was a little harsh.  I just want to make it clear to people who could be purchasing this item for the wrong reason.  Apple states on their website that this product supports \\"video out on the iPhone 4 and iPod touch (4th Gen)\\".  However, they are not clear in stating it only supports video via certain select apps (iPod videos app, iMovie).  It does not support video output for third party apps like VLC, Plex or any other app.  Because Apple is not clear in stating that this product only supports video out from certain apps, I can not rate this product 5 stars.  However, if a buyer is considering purchasing this item for an iPad 2, it's an excellent accessory.

0891419063|5.0|A Southern gentleman wanted to serve in World War II after the bombing of Pearl Harbor.  He joined the Marines as \\"cannon fodder\\" but became a skilled and highly trained mortarman who survived the war physically, not so well mentally.  The latter took time.  Sledge's training was in the old-school manner:  abusive, tough, and as honorable as the Marines of the 'old school/breed.'  In one of his own footnotes re:  training, E.B. Sledge wrote:  In the postwar years, the Marine Corps came in for a great deal of undeserved criticism, in my opinion, from well-meaning persons who did not comprehend the magniture of stress and horror that combat can be...Men must be trained realistically if they are to survive...without breaking mentally and physically (p. 41).\\"<br /><br />E. B. Sledge's book is a memoir of the war from a regular, enlisted man's view--giving it much credibility nad poignance as he watches the war slaughter good men who might have contributed much to society and the world had they not been called to duty or enlisted to keep the world free from authoritarian regimes.  He kept notes in his battered New Testament, encased in a plastic bag taken from a Japanese soldier who had died.  He struggled with the cruelty he witnessed, the degradation of fellow soldiers on both sides; and his book is as much an indictment of war as was All Quiet on the Western Front.  Sledge went on to contribute greatly to our world by earning higher degrees and teaching at the University of Montevallo, AL.  A fellow Mobilian am I;  as well as a teacher...and even though Dr. Sledge indicts war, he ends with this profound statement which I believe is the thesis of his work:  \\"Until the millenium arrives and countries cease trying to enslave others, it will be necessary to accept one's responsibilities and to be willing to make sacrifices for one's country--as my comrades did...With privilege goes responsibility.\\"<br /><br />One more thought:  The war in Europe generally receives all the press, used in the movies, and so forth, but the battles in the Pacific were just as horrible against an AXIS power as the more well-known European war.  Mobile, AL, contributed much to the war effort, particularly in terms of ships--it was even the subject in movie houses in a twelve minute news report called War Town.  Between New Orleans and Mobile, much of the machinery of war was built and launched--e.g., the Higgins boats which figure prominently in the story.  Today, in New Orleans, stands the National D-Day Museum which covers not only what happened in Europe but now has a new wing devoted to those who served in the Pacific Theatre.  Sledge's two books, the works of Robert Leckie and several others provided the basis of Hanks/Spielberg's HBO film, The Pacific, and Ken Burns' The War.

0307272702|2.0|I didn't realize this when I started it (though I probably should have), but this book is a 272-page advertisement for low-carb diets.  My main criticism is that Taubes comes across as condescending.  He's so convinced himself that low-carb diets are the best that he's unwilling, and in fact does not, consider compelling counterarguments against that contention.      The first half of the book criticizes the conventional wisdom that, in order to lose weight, people must consume fewer calories than they expend.  He cites numerous studies and research that establish that doing one of either exercising or reducing calories does not typically result in weight loss.  When people exercise more, they eat more.  When they eat less, they expend less energy.  The major flaw in this position is that virtually none of the research addressed the efficacy of diets that require both diet and exercise.  Clearly, both in conjunction can work and have worked; otherwise programs such as Weight Watchers would have no success, and the TV program Biggest Loser would not exist.  I don't care how obese a person is, if that person accurately account for calories expended, even if sedentary, and then eats less than that, that person will lose weight.  Even if that person eats almost entirely carbs.  How else could Mark Haub's (of Kansas State) Twinkie diet have worked?  Taubes lost a lot of credibility by failing to acknowledge this fact.     And while it makes sense that diets which severely restrict calories, such as 1500-per-day diets, wouldn't catch hold, what about diets that restrict only a moderate amount of calories?  Say, the amount of energy a person a day expends minus 100 calories?  I actually lost 15 pounds last year by doing something similar, and I ate desert almost every day.  I've kept the weight off by closely watching to ensure that I don't consume more calories than I burn.      That's not to say, however, that some people aren't more predisposed to becoming obese or thatit isn't easier for some people to stay lean.  But with sufficient motivation, weight loss can be achieved, even while eating carbs.      I acknowledge that many people can't, or won't, life a lifestyle requiring both diet and exercise in the long term, which is a valid criticism I suppose.    But will people live a low-carb lifestyle in the long term?  A low-carb diet is boring.  How many breakfasts of bacon and eggs in a row can someone stomach?  Are people really going to stay motivated, in the long-term, to avoid potatoes, beer, pasta, and sweets?  Do you know how many places low-carb dieters can't eat at with their friends?  Low-carb diets are also expensive; many can't afford to eat meat at nearly every meal.  And what's the success rate of those who begin low-carb diets in the long-term?  Astoundingly, Taubes doesn't even address that question.     I'm somewhat perplexed at the unusually high ratings this book has received, given that it hasn't addressed the issues above.  It's almost as if the low-carb diet is a form of religion about which supporters will not allow others to blashpeme.
1846142733|4.0|While the book is both instructive and as readable as any of Ferguson's books, the view on the effect of Islam and of Christianity upon science is flawed. While Christianity welcomed science as a way to understand God's creation, spurring science, Islam on the other hand did not have the influence on european science romanticized in the book. Byzantium (not Baghdad) remained the center of science in Minor Asia until it was sacked, and the texts of the Greeks found their way to the West from Byzantium  translated by Jacques de Venise who spent some time in Constantinople), as well as from southern Italy, which was part of Byzantium, translated by Willem de Moerbeke. The Toledo translations which gave rise to the myth of islamic influence mainly concerned the commentaries to Aristotle by Averroes (who actually was banned by the islamic ruler for his work). I would have expected this to be known to a historian writing in 2010.
B003Y5H55G|4.0|Simon Pegg and Nick Frost have basically become comedic icons over the past seven years. Along with director Edgar Wright, Pegg and Frost were introduced to most Americans through both Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz. Each of the British actors found success venturing off on their own even though Pegg seemed to have more successful outings. Pegg playing Scotty in J.J. Abrams Star Trek reboot is probably what he's known best for these days, but Paul is the first time we've seen the two reunited since Hot Fuzz. Would it be worth the wait? Could Pegg and Frost make a great film without fellow UK collaborator Edgar Wright? If you're thinking of any answer other than, \\"Yes,\\" then you're highly mistaken.<br /><br />There really is no reason not to like this film if you enjoyed Superbad or basically any film Simon Pegg or Nick Frost were a part of. The writing doesn't seem to be quite as polished as when Edgar Wright is also included in the equation, but it doesn't take anything away from the entertainment factor of the film. In fact, one of the highlights of the film is how much homage to other great sci-fi films is actually included in the film. Some reviews are saying that there was too much, but I thought it fit the overall tone of the film incredibly well. My personal favorite was the reference made to a specific James Cameron film (hint: it's not Avatar) after it's revealed who's been giving Agent Zoil (Jason Bateman) orders, but Steven Spielberg's cameo is a close second.<br /><br />The supporting cast is just as fantastic as the main one. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are, of course, the highlight. The ongoing gag of everyone thinking they're a gay couple somehow manages to remain humorous every time someone comes back to it. Seth Rogen was the perfect choice for Paul. While Pegg and Frost have admitted in interviews that they originally had an older actor in mind for the voice of Paul, Rogen brings the stoner humor he's become associated with to an extraterrestrial being with ease. Trying to imagine someone else in the role is nearly impossible. Kristen Wiig also steals quite a few scenes mostly due to her unique use of vulgarity. However, the scenes involving Bill Hader, Joe Lo Truglio, and Jason Bateman are just as great as the ones featuring the main cast. Bateman's Agent Zoil seems to be trying to take this assignment seriously while Haggard (Hader) and O'Reilly (Truglio) are constantly getting in his way due to them not taking their jobs seriously.<br /><br />The film seemed slightly reminiscent of Pineapple Express. Other than the fact that actors in the cast of Paul were also in Pineapple Express, Pineapple Express had a lot more action in it than the trailers let on. It was almost just as much as an action film as it was a comedy. Paul is the same way, but it brings some drama into the mix as well. It's certainly a comedy first, but it doesn't take long for you to get sucked into the film's explosive action. There's actually a little bit of heart to the film as well as the drama comes into play when the fate of a few of these characters you've grown to love over the past hour and forty minutes becomes questionable.<br /><br />Paul covers nearly all of its bases just in the amount of genres the film seems to cram in one film. It's a sci-fi comedy on the surface with one of its main characters being completely animated while also throwing a little bit of action, drama, and adventure in for good measure. The film seems to spend just as much time making you laugh as it does knocking you out of your chair with all of the car chases and gunfire heavy action sequences before surprising you by pulling at your heartstrings in the finale. If you enjoyed Superbad, Pineapple Express, Shaun of the Dead, or Hot Fuzz, then Paul is a must see.

Top marks for the actors and the super effective soundtrack, possibly one of the most seedy industrialised yet amazing music that fits the film so well, and adds a huge amount of atmosphere to complete the films promise of an almost machiavellian plan to use the subject of the ultimate victim.<br />The director's point of this destruction is to resonate his life in Serbia and i quote \\"We are raped in birth, we are raped in life and we are raped in death. This is what this movie is about\\".<br /><br />BUT the cut version is AWFUL - it loses its point, it loses its atmosphere and it loses the audiences perception of the characters, which is essential to the film. With 4mins and 17secs gone it has a huge impact on the film. It cuts almost every remotely violent scene to the extent where even the music is altered because of the heavy, and brutal editing, ripped apart by the BBFC. Their arguement is that the children used in the film could have been exposed to the actual subject of the film, and any scenes with kids is cut ruthlessly, and one main scene of the death of Milos' ex wife is completely mutilated beyond recognition.<br />i know that the director was furious about the cuts and i dont blame him. Many films these days often cross lines and as a extreme horror fan A SERBIAN FILM has nothing new, except its context and atmosphere.<br /><br />So please if you are an extreme horror fan (and anyone else that isnt a fan i would advise to stay away from it), avoid this version and wait till we finally see the release of the uncut. As far as im concerned the cutting of this film is a travisty, and the very fact that they mutilate and hack away at the editing of the film is revoltingly ironic considering the film's context.
B002ZG976U|2.0|I don't know what I was expecting from \\"Burlesque\\", but it disappointed me on nearly every level. It's basically just a vehicle for Christina Aguilera. Let's go through the threadbare plot first...small town waitress Aguilera dreams of being on stage. She quits the day job and goes to LA...stumbling across a Burlesque club run by Cher, she wangles herself a waitress job, then eventually wangles her way onto the stage as a dancer and then - yes! - her big break suddenly comes when she unexpectedly bursts into live song and the audience is blown away. Well, the fictious audience in the film is, anyway. The real audience watching this movie will have seen that coming while they were outside buying tickets to get in.<br /><br />It's not a badly made film, it's just so awfully lame. Christina can act passably, but she suggests no depth whatsoever: she just reads the lines and leaves it at that. Cher is much more interesting (as I expected), although with her botoxed face, the acting skills that previously shone in films like \\"Mask\\" have all but vanished - at one point she comforts a character with a hug, and then \\"poignantly\\" grimaces behind his back - but she can't even move her face enough do it! The bald guy with glasses who played the sharp-tongued gay stylist in \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" turns up playing an exact same character here...how lazy. And the sub-plot involving the former star of the show who is upstaged by Aguilera is as weak as dishwater. Her one big act of sabotage is to switch off the pre-recorded vocals that the girls are miming to right in the middle of Aguilera's turn. Oh but - what a surprise - Christina chucks the mike away and belts out the vocals herself and saves the show. Where's the tension in rivalry when we all saw that one coming a mile off? Even \\"Showgirls\\" had more convincing back-stabbing than this.<br /><br />Further things that fall flat are the songs that punctuate the running time. Apart from plenty of the show numbers, we get Christina belting (she belts most things) out a number alone in her diner with a mop, then a bit later on we get Cher ostensibly rehearsing a song, which is an \\"I Will Survive\\" style torch song about being strong and not giving up, played just after her character has come to the edge of despair over huge debts. I mean, give us some credit here - we do get it! Plus there's no way the song she sings would ever be featured in the show - what burlesque audience would pay to see an song like that? Having her rehearse a happy song but showing her sorrow in an undercurrent would have been far more rivetting. Same goes for Christina later on, when the character finds true love (oh you knew that, didn't you?), the scene is immediately followed by her singing a sultry slow song about true love... wearing an evening gown! Again rather odd because the club earns it's money by the performers singing raunchy songs while dressed like strippers. Again, it's sledgehammer symbolism that insults the viewers intelligence.<br /><br />The only high points of the film are Cher, who steals the show (shame about the wax facial expression), and if you're a Christina fan, she does her thing as well as in any of her music videos - which is all this is really. A lot like the video to \\"Lady Marmalade\\", but without all the other girls. But apart from that it's dull, dull, DULL. I watched it on a plane, and it was about my 3rd choice. I think thats the best I can say about it.belts most things) out a number alone in her diner with a mop, then a bit later on we get Cher ostensibly rehearsing a song, which is an \\"I Will Survive\\" style torch song about being strong and not giving up, played just after her character has come to the edge of despair over huge debts.

1439102724|2.0|So interesting to read other reviews and especially those that would have the reader believe (in advance) this is a \\"MUST\\" and this is one of her best! I disagree, sadly enough since I awaited its publication so enthusiastically, since I found this novel plain drudgery until I reached the final page. I am a fan, was a fan. I didn't like the characters, which is a first, and I thought the subject(s) were handled awkwardly. Deftly could the gay issues have been tackled and completely omittted might have been the whole aspect of Christian Evangelism. As a cure? A disappointing read!
B002VPE1PW|4.0|Fit: This cover is designed with netbooks in mind. It fits very nicely 10 inch netbooks but is a little loose for an iPad. It is too roomy for an iPad 2 and even with the leather smartcover I have enough space to put my Kindle 2G inside the same case. However, if you don't particularly care about the case being a shade too big (about 1 inch too big in width) then it's great for an iPad 2. This case makes the profile of my iPad 2 a little too big to fit in most of my leather handbags, so I'll have to place it in my backpack. I also bought the Philips sleeve [[ASIN:B003DNSA0I Philips DLN1713 Soft Sleeve for iPad]] which fits an iPad 2 with smart cover and is much more form fitting. Also [[ASIN:B003FGCH0W Incase Neoprene Sleeve for iPad (Black)]] is smaller than this case and has much more padding and also available at a decent price at other retailers. I also tried the [[ASIN:B0029LA6QQ HP Pink Mini Sleeve]] which is smaller and a better fit than this case so you have other options.<br /><br />Material: Sturdy zipper, well stitched neoprene cover with water resistant top cover.<br /><br />Styling: Pretty basic black. Orange inside is a nice surprise. The elastic bands inside hold the netbook/iPad in place. The advantage over a sleeve style is that you can unzip the case all around and use your iPad while still in the case if needed.<br /><br />Value for money: I got it for under 5 bucks shipped, so it is a great value. The price seems to fluctuate everyday so keep an eye out for a lower price.
0061801313|5.0|I can't even use a word to describe this series. It is just plain addicting and has a very fascinating storyline that I can't believe was even in the realm of possiblity. This whole entire series follows four friends whose best friend has been missing, Alison DiLaurentis for 3 years. Later in the series we find out that Alison was murdered and that is when chaos slowly starts to break loose. Alison's old friends Spencer Hastings, Aria Montgomery,Emily Fields, and Hanna Marin start being stalked by text message by a person named A which before Alison was prononuced dead was thought to be her. The girls become closer through this and help each other out in their own tricky situation as the series unfolds. I strongly suggest this to any young adult reader and even if you are reluctant to read this, at least give it a chance.
B00007GZR0|4.0|This was quite a movie, lots of silliness and twists and turns.  Doris Day and Rock Hudson were a good pair,as in the other movies they star together in.  Tony Randall was hilarious in this movie and the other charactors they cast (the doctor and funeral caretaker) were really great too. It's a pretty typical kind of movie for this pair.
0517548232|1.0|This is one of the most disappointing purchases I have made on Amazon.<br /><br />The book is one long, myopic, libertarian apology.
B001IBIHQ4|1.0|After three purchases and three exchanges of this DVD, I have given up trying to find a workable copy.  In every case, the DVD locks up at the Root Menu and will not proceed to the 1st episode.  Obviously, a real manufacturing failure.  I hope they correct the problem and re-manufacture.  I really wanted to have this!!!
B00004XMTJ|5.0|The best rendition of a Broadway play that I have ever seen in my life and I've seen many Broadway shows during my time.  As terrific as the Broadway show was, this DVD version takes the costumes, choreography, orchestration and overall acting to a much higher level --- almost unimaginable.  Generally speaking, when Broadway shows go to the big screen, the great majority of them fail miserably.  That cannot be said for the DVD version of CATS.  I cannot recommend this musical more highly and anyone who has a love for cats, great acting, and superb music will fall in love with this show.  Enjoy!
B0000024ZT|5.0|This is a great debut album. It features such classics as Growin Up, For You, Blinded By the Light, Spirit In the Night, and Lost In the Flood. This is the album where people thought Springsteen was the new Dylan because of his writing style.
1591843790|5.0|It's not only about getting what you want, but rather it's about creating a long-term, voluntary change in others. It's the art of persuasion in a Facebook generation.    This easy to read guide book will enable you to plan your own road map of enchantment, whether you want to enchant your customers, your competitors, your employees, your co-workers, or dare we say, even your boss.      Guy's initial job for Apple was to get others to make Macintosh-compatible products. Because of his excitement about Apple's future, it was easy for him to convince others about the unlimited potential they could achieve by working together, developing software to enhance that radically new computer.    In an overly abbreviated form, his roadmap will help you:        * Become likable      * Exude trustworthiness      * Make sure your proposal is truly extraordinary      * Plan a great launch      * Work to make your  dream endure    To make it all work, one needs to convince people to think of what could be, not what is. The greater the dream, the greater the buy-in.
0439023513|5.0|I don't know exactly why this series had such an impact on me: it ranks with LOTR and Inkheart and Harry Potter for me as special benchmarks in reading entertainment.  I may start it again today and I just finished it two days ago.    Full of interesting characters who are real and likeable, the story just kept pulling me in and on.  Each of the three books added depth to the characters, in my opinion, and Katniss was not the only critical pon on the board.      I've told my boss, my parents, my husband: read these books!  Now my husband, an engineer, has read them, and he didn't care the the end of the third, but that provides some good discussions, and during the second, he told us that the story had him \\"spellbound.\\"      Many of you have reviewed these book and brought broad perspectives and new points of view, and that's part of the interest for me.  The open dialoge I've read is polite, well thought-out, and varied: thank you all.      The series: a terrific ride.  Yes, there are faults, but what an intriguing idea.  Enjoy the books and the discussions!  If you don't read this, you might be missing something huge that may become iconic.
0345505387|3.0|I personally love all of the Outlander Novels.  I must have misread or misunderstood what I was purchasing.  I was looking for the next sequel, not a comic style book.
1416914285|5.0|The Mortal Instruments series by author Cassandra Clare is an exciting, don't want to put it down read. It should be read in the order it was written to fully enjoy the character development. It is (until the April 5th release of book number four \\"City of Fallen Angels) a triology. Which includes: City of Bones, City of Ashes, and City of Glass. The author's web site recommends reading the first book in the prequel series \\"Clockwork Angel\\", before reading the City of Fallen Angels.  I began reading the books when they were recommended by a friend, and borrowed them, but then I purchased the series for myself, and I am looking forward to the arrival of City of Fallen Angels in my mail. :)
B002HNA95E|3.0|The sound quality is amazing, but the choice of mixes is very strange.  For some songs, like Holiday and Like A Prayer, they used the full original album version.  For some songs, like Vogue and Crazy For You, they used the Immaculate Collection version.  And for others, like Everybody, Express Yourself and Lucky Star, they created new versions specifically for this album.  What I hated about the Immaculate Collection was that all new mixes were created specifically for that album, and some of that was done here as well.  They should have used all original radio edits/single mixes as they appeared on the radio (for example they should have used the original 3:58 edit of Everybody instead of creating a brand new 4:11 edit).  Using all of the original radio edits would have served two purposes: it would have provided fans with all of those hard to find original edits in CD format, and it would have freed up more space for other songs (ahem, Angel, True Blue, and Causing A Commotion.  But I must say, it was very nice to finally have the original 4:40 radio version of Into The Groove on remastered CD, and that by itself is deserving of an extra star.
1400049628|5.0|The Zombie Survival Guide by Max Brooks is hilariously funny. Its not funny in the let's make jokes way, its funny in the way that something makes you bust a gut when it takes itself way too seriously. Its satire instead of spoof.<br /><br />Written in the style of a survival guide, it outlines just what you need to do in pretty much every major classification of zombie uprising, from the raising of a few isolated zombies, to the panic of thousands of zombies reviving and engulfing the majority of the population of the world.<br /><br />It discusses which weapon types are best used for which type of combat situation, and does so with great detail.<br /><br />No detail is left uncovered here in this book. If you're looking to have a good laugh with some actual intelligence, read this book. It was worth every minute I put into it. I will definitely be keeping this one for a future re-reading.
B000267JQK|5.0|This CD is great, just like Seether's other albums.  The songs have that unique sound that only Seether has.  It comes with a bonus DVD of the band in concert. It's great video footage and not some low-budget shakey camera junk. I definitely recommend this to any Seether fan.
B000006M7N|5.0|This is one of my favorite rock albums plus this is my favorite Uriah Heep with all of these songs I love. These songs have to be some of the best of theirs.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|This is a heart warming story about a despicable villain who you love in spite of him being so-called evil.  He's not really.  I wanted to cheer him on.  He plots to steal the moon and adopts 3 little girls to help in his plan.  What happens is that they change his heart.  The little girls are adorable and the graphics are fantastic.  Steve Carrel does a fabulous job with the voice and the character of Gru.  The people I purchased this charming dvd from where fast and the transaction went smoothly.  I would buy from them again.  I highly recommend this DVD.
B0019NB9A2|5.0|I'm not going to bore readers with a review of this great film; a purchase that would be well worth the price.  What I am making note of here is that this Blu-Ray gives you everything that is in the original DVD 2 disc version except on a single dual-layered disc (and even then the second layer may not have been necessary).  Yes, the extras are in SD.  But, the maximum storage for the DVD set combined is about 15 GBs.  Even with the extra GBs for the HD content, they still could have placed everything on a single-layered BD!  It proves what I always suspected, that a lot of room is being wasted on these discs and we as consumers are eating that cost.  There are some multi-movie sets that could be placed on a single Blu-Ray and still maintain all of their HD audio and video.  Case in point, the recent BD Harryhausen set I bought could have easily been on 2 discs rather than 4, and if they left off the colorized versions (what was the point?), all 4 of those films could have been transferred to a single dual-layered disc and still maintain their HD quality!  It is about time that the studios stop ripping-off their meal-ticket.  The rating above is for the movie, its transfer and the overall value contained here.
B001BFHQ96|3.0|I live in snowy and icy Michigan, often working in outside conditions.  I've been buying Timberland exclusively for years and they have treated me well.  However, a month after buying them, I have a few problems with the Earthkeepers.  First of all, the tongue on EACH boot is the victim of a poor stitching job, causing the top part of each tongue to be sewed only halfway.  Once tied, this is no big deal, but a bit disappointing considering the price.  I called for an exchange, but apparently I have a rare (or very common) foot size and was able to only return for a refund or keep the boots as I bought the last pair in my size (13W).  I decided to cut my losses and keep them.    One other manufacturing problem is that it appears as if the sole on one of the boots is starting to come unattached to the boot itself, toward the heel end.  I would be surprised if these boots lasted even a year before needing to getting resoled, not due to the sole wearing down but because of the sole actually coming off.  For now the sole is staying on and does not appear to be loosening any further but I am wary.    Speaking of the sole, the traction of the boots is pretty bad.  If you work in any sort of environment with slick floors be prepared to find things to hold onto so you don't slip and fall.  This was not a problem with other Timberlands.  I'm guessing it has to do with the \\"earth-friendly\\" material.    These boots, however, are certainly not all bad.  The fit is great.  After a short break-in period of maybe a week I am able to wear them for 12 hours without my feet getting sore.  The arch supports felt a bit obstructive at first but now have conformed to my feet.  They look great, as well.  Not totally water-proof but as long as you are not splashing in puddles your socks should remain dry.  All in all, not perfect, pretty good, but not as great as I would be hoping for from Timberland.
0786868724|5.0|Have read this book before and was so impressed, I bought it.  Something that any reader could easily read again and again and not grow tired of.  Mitch Albom is more than just a sports writer wandering out of his element.  His non-sports books are probably his best, including The Five People You Meet in Heaven, Tuesdays with Morrie, For One More Day, and Have a Little Faith.  Combining spiritual matters with everyday living, without becoming weepy or tacky is a gift, and Albom has this gift.  Have a Little Faith is part of a journey that we all may take sooner or later, and probably need to take if we wish to grow beyond where we are now.  Highly recommended.

B0043RSJ8G|4.0|I am a huge Jodi Picoult fan and although this is not one of her best books it was very good.  It wasn't a book that I couldn't put down or that had me riveted but I did like the turns in the   plot and I did want to keep reading it.
0385504225|3.0|An awesome story that was significantly hurt by the author's misunderstanding of religion. He made claims about the \\"hidden\\" meaning of words that become absurd if you have any sort of understanding of word origins, i.e. claiming that \\"amen\\" was a secret reference to Amon Ra, the Egyptian sun god. Amen is a transliteration of a Greek word that means \\"verily, truly, so let it be.\\" The suspense is good, the writing is ok, the interpretations of symbols and codes is entertaining, but what takes a star away from this work is the author's misunderstanding of religion.
0307346609|5.0|A friend gave me a very dog-eared copy of this book and said she'd loved it.  While I enjoy the occasional excellent A-list zombie movie (\\"Shaun of the Dead\\" was a riot), it was hard to imagine that the living dead could be the subject of a serious novel.  But World War Z is just that.  I liked the book from the beginning, enjoyed it more and more the further into it I delved, and ended up loving it.  The vignettes of survivors are all very well told, and they reflect the author's great imagination and considerable attention to detail.<br /><br />Once you accept the admittedly rather loony premise that a virus could create this situation of hordes of the living dead plaguing the planet, it becomes very interesting to imagine how it would all unfold.  And that's exactly what Brooks does here, retrospectively.  It's clear he has imagined every aspect of the war, from the (often failed) strategies of governments to the down and dirty details of the soldiers and civilians who had to live from one day to the next in fear and confusion.  There is much research here, and that's evident in the complexity and detail of the book.  It reminded me of William Peter Blatty's outstanding novel, \\"The Exorcist\\", in the sense that, while the premise is supernatural and (we hope!) unrealistic, once that premise is accepted everything that follows is serious and very believable.<br /><br />(Side note: being a dog lover, I was very touched by one story, that of a former dog handler - dogs were used to detect infected people - who relates the dangers dogs faced in their work for humans.  The man's emotional attachment to, and concern for, his own canine partners during the war is always hauntingly just below the surface, and while telling the story he poignantly pets and tries not to disturb the old dachshund sleeping on his lap, a survivor of the K9 corps.)<br /><br />The tone that Brooks strikes is often pitch-perfect.  The fictional interviewer intrudes only when necessary to clarify something in a particular survivor's narrative, and overall Brooks lets the survivors speak for themselves, instead of imposing an explicitly emotional narrative on top of everything.  There is cynicism, anger, hope, bitterness, humor, and a good deal of sometimes poignant compassion in these pages.  In short, Brooks delivers the sort of realism and emotional complexity that you won't find in your average pulp fiction zombie tale.<br /><br />This is a great read that had me wanting to get back to the book whenever I was away from it, and which will leave you thinking about it long after you've reached the end.r survivor's narrative, and overall Brooks lets the survivors speak for themselves, instead of imposing an explicitly emotional narrative on top of everything.

B004FGMV0W|3.0|At first I found the songs to be too mellow and monotone, and they seemed to all run together. Nothing really stood out for me, except for a few songs. But the more I listened to it, I learned to appreciate it and now actually enjoy it.
B003Y5H54W|3.0|This \\"Red Riding Hood\\" reminds us that, back when these stories originated, they captured real and adult fears. We have our own fears today, including the witch-hunt that adds tension to much of the movie - a complex set of tensions that touches each person differently. Themes of secrecy and betrayal, parental ambition, and divided affection also contribute their part to this mix.<br /><br />So, when all these very workable parts add together, is the total so much less than the sum of the parts? I'm not sure. The divided loyalties lack urgency, the surprise near the end comes seemingly from nowhere, with no dramatic buildup, and the demise of the witch-hunter seems a bit too pat. The movie flows well and uses imagery with good effect. Despite its Twilight overtones, the script just never gave much to care about. I enjoyed this well enough, as commodity entertainment, but won't be hunting it down again.<br /><br />-- wiredweird, reviewing the release to theaters
B003UESJEW|4.0|FILM RATING: 3.5 stars<br /><br />The Company Men (2010) is a gripping 21st century drama about white collar men loosing their jobs and a part of themselves in our recent (and still current) Great Recession. This movie has been mostly overlooked, which is too bad, because this is a very good film that deserves to be seen. I can see why people wouldn't want to see it, because it hits very close to home. But hopefully it will find its audience on Blu-ray and DVD. I saw it in the theater back in January when it was finally released after several postponements.<br /><br />Screenwriter and first time feature film Director John Wells has crafted a movie that really speaks to me and my predicament these past 4 years...as I'm sure it does for millions of Americans. I for one escape into film not only to avoid the reality of my life and to be entertained, but also to find solace and sympathy in knowing that I'm not alone in what I'm experiencing or have experienced. There's a cathartic healing that film brings my psyche and emotional soul when it powerfully connects its stories and characters to my own life's journey. I can see I'm not alone. I know you know what I'm talking about. So I really don't have to say anything more.<br /><br />The story of The Company Men is simple: It follows the lives of 3 men who lose their jobs due to a failing economy. But they find out that their jobs were more than just jobs. As men, we have a built-in programming that we tend to define ourselves by our work, our titles, our income, our family, our accomplishments, and everything else that we do and get. What happens when all of that is taken away? Who are we then? And what do we do with our lives? How do we define ourselves without our work and our material belongings? What do we tell other people when they ask who we are and what we do? These are just some of the questions and ideas that The Company Men explores, but unfortunately doesn't really answer the way I think it should have. One of my disappointments in The Company Men is how the movie spends 90% of its time showing us the intricate complexities, paradoxes and lack of answers for everything I've mentioned, but then rushes to wrap it all up into a nice, relatively happy Hollywood ending where everyone ultimately goes back to their original jobs in a new form. I've gone through pretty much all of the same experiences over the past 4 years as The Company Men do. I lost my job (as an Architect), which then turned into a feeling of losing my career since I couldn't find another job in the same field for years. I lost most of, if not all, my income. I had to sell many of my belongings, face losing my home and everything that defined me, and discover who I really am in the face of real adversity. I've downsized to a quarter-sized lifestyle of my previous one. And it still hasn't ended \\"happy\\" per se. I'm still not working again as an architect. I do believe things have worked out by me redefining myself and that I'm on a better foundation now than the shaky one I had built, ironically, as only an architect. But I don't feel like The Company Men shows enough of that struggle and forced redefinition. Granted, my situation is unique to me, so maybe I'm too close to this story and not unbiased enough to evaluate it. Maybe most people will go back to what they were doing before. Hard to answer right now.<br /><br />My point to this discussion is that what I really like about The Company Men is its willingness to look at these ideas and explore them from a number of points of view. Even if I don't totally agree with how these ideas and characters get resolved in this movie. Anyone who  has had to rethink things and redefined themselves due to the Great Recession, should find something in The Company Men that they can relate to. And I'm grateful that a film like this is out there for each of us to seek out, whether its now or in the future when things are good again or people are ready to look at these stories. Or maybe things will never go back to the way they were? We will see.<br /><br />Ben Affleck, Chris Cooper, and Tommy Lee Jones lead the fantastic ensemble cast here, which includes Kevin Costner, Maria Bello, and Craig T. Nelson. All of these actors bring their A-game to The Company Men and make it a very good study on character acting. I can see why they all signed on to this project...it was an opportunity to bite into some juicy dialogue and serious storytelling. If it weren't for the subject matter, I think they would all be receiving more praise for their work here.<br /><br />The filmmaking craft is solid in The Company Men, with good cinematography and production design, good editing, music that works for the most part to convey the film's emotional content, and writing that works through most of the film in telling its story and keeping my interest. In a lesser year for film, The Company Men would probably have made my Top 10 movies of the year, but there were just too many very good 3.5 star films in 2010. I've got at least a dozen of them. The Company Men is one of that pack that  should show up in your home theater at some point.ver go back to the way they were? We will see.

I can see why they all signed on to this project...it was an opportunity to bite into some juicy dialogue and serious storytelling. If it weren't for the subject matter, I think they would all be receiving more praise for their work here.    The filmmaking craft is solid in The Company Men, with good cinematography and production design, good editing, music that works for the most part to convey the film's emotional content, and writing that works through most of the film in telling its story and keeping my interest. In a lesser year for film, The Company Men would probably have made my Top 10 movies of the year, but there were just too many very good 3.5 star films in 2010. I've got at least a dozen of them. The Company Men is one of that pack that  should show up in your home theater at some point.
B003L20ID8|5.0|\\"Some things are meant to be.\\" Sure, you've heard that phrase before, but just who was it that meant them to be? And how will that be enforced?<br /><br />This brilliant movie starts by assuming an answer that second question: The Adjustment Bureau makes sure things turn out according to The Plan. David Norris (Matt Damon's outstandingly played character) encounters a dancer (portrayed beautifully by Emily Blunt), and mutual infatuation strikes in a heartbeat. Their affection is not part of The Plan, however. It must be stopped. Then, in an unrelated thread of the story, Norris discovers the Bureau's workings.<br /><br />Soon enough, they're working against him. This keeps a more credible tone than most action movies - no block-buster stunts, no guns, no explosions. Special effects appear in a very few places, neatly done but with a light touch that I appreciate. All that lets the raw characters come through, a Kafka-like sense of vast and unseen powers. Instead of submitting to the faceless forces, however, Damon and Blunt confront them. Although that familiar foreboding echoes many other paranoid fantasy movies, the heroes' determination against those forces keeps the story fresh. I recommend this one highly.<br /><br />-- wiredweird, reviewing the release to theaters
1596680296|5.0|With the help of this book I was able to create a hunting sock to fit a size 18 shoe size.  I can't say enough good about this book, it has become a staple of my yarn basket when I am knitting socks.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I purchased this book based on all the 5-star reviews posted on this sight and the subject matter.  It is supposedly written for young adults but I feel the subject matter may be too grim or not sufficiently understood by too young a reader. I suggest parents read the book first to judge for themselves before allowing their children to read it.    This book is narrated by Death; an interesting if somewhat chilling concept, but due to the fact that it is written about WW2, the narrator is entirely appropriate.      The book is about Liesel Meminger, a young girl who is handled over to guardians near Munich, as her father, a Communist, has disappeared and her mother is too ill to care for her and her younger brother. The brother dies and she finds a book entitled, The Gravedigger's Handbook\\" in the snow near where he is buried. She impulsively steals it, although she cannot read, and takes it to the guardians' home, Rosa and Hans Hubermann.     Hans helps Liesel cope with nightmares and also teaches her to read. Hans is a not-too-successful painter, primarily because he has not joined the Nazi party. Part of his reluctance to join is due to his life being saved during WW1 by a Jewish soldier. He gets to repay his debt to his Jewish comrade when his son, Max, comes to his house seeking shelter. This is obviously a very dangerous situation for the family as they could be arrested and killed for rescuing a Jew.    While Max hides in the basement, he uses white paint fron the cans stored there to paint over pages of Mein Kampf, a book he used as part of the subterfuge to escape. These pages are then used by him to create stories and drawings to entertain Leisel.  In the meantime, she continues to steal books when they are available because she has learned to love the printed word.  She also begins write her own stories.    Rather than being a true war story, this is a complex tale about the human condition. It is about how a young girl who has lost so much in her 11 yearslearns to cope with that loss and gain joy from simple things.  It is about kindness, and the repayment of old debts.      I recommend this book very highly.
0670022411|2.0|I had great hopes for this book initially. And for the first 200 pages, I couldn't put it down. It began with an interesting premise--a history scholar at Oxford who comes from a family of witches, denies her powers, opens magic book, falls in love with a mysterious vampire, and then it all goes sadly, and very badly wrong. It's as if Harkness began this book by trying to write a gothic romance but couldn't sell that so (excuse the phrase) \\"revamped\\" it into a Vampire/Witch/Daemon tale because that's what the hip kids are into these days. The logic gaps are huge. The vampire goes from being English to French overnight. Her aunt, who is a descendant of witches who go back to Salem has no clue who Lilith was. Really? Seriously? Harkness would have us believe that falling in love renders Diana seemingly overnight from a brave, defiant, take-care-of-herself kinda of a gal into a helpless waif who has to be carried around by the big strong man, I mean vampire, who bows to his will because that's what good \\"wives\\" are supposed to do--yeah, it's that bad. What's worse--she apparently intends this book to be the first in a series. We get to meet Matthew's vampire \\"family\\"--not to mention Diana's witchy one and oh look, those nice kooky daemon kids from NC drop by to visit. The only thing you'll want to visit if you read this one is your nearest rubbish bin to throw it where it belongs.

B004CRR9G0|5.0|Perhaps in part because this Tales from Earthsea, the directorial debut of Hayao Miyazaki's son, Goro, this Blu-Ray version of Miyazaki's first feature directed for Studio Ghibliis has also been released (I would assume an Earthsea Blu-ray is forthcoming).<br /><br />Completely by coincidence, Nausicaa takes on a staggeringly prophetic tone in the shadow of recent natural and man-made disasters in Japan, making it all the more hard-hitting as allegory.<br /><br />Virtually all of Miyazaki's film convey this theme with varied intensity. In Nausicaa, pollution and industrial waste is the major element as this fantasy world is plagued by a deadly poisoned jungle and the relation between people and animals, in this case bug-like creatures that young Princess Nausicaa understands and champions.<br /><br />The film is lentgthy for an animated feature, yet does not flag or sag. It's an overall dark story without much humor, but the subject matter holds little room for flippancy. The voice cast, showcased on one of the bonus features, matches that of a major Hollywood live action movie, the case including Patrick Stewart, Uma Thurman and Edward James Olmos.<br /><br />For DVD owners, you will find that a few of the bonus features have been moved to the new disc. But Blu-ray especially accentuates that remarkable, meticulous detail of the world of Nausicaa and the imagination of Miyazaki.
B000002U88|5.0|Good morning im still somewhat new to Amazon.com but so far id have to say that my experience with amazon.com has been very positive im so glad i decided to be brave enough to take a chance with amazon.com .Im usually all about not really trusting a lot of anybody theres so many people on the net trying to scam others out of their money this has nt been the case with amazon.com you pay for what you want plus maybe a shipping charge thats mostly needed but thats ok other than that they are legit and thats good. Ive always been a big Bob Seger fan even though i did nt have any in my current collection i do now and Bob Segers the distance is an older cd i could nt find at my local music shop so i took a chance glad that i did i also bought a few older movie titles from amazon i could nt find in the store. Overall i am very pleaseed with AMAZON.COM and plan to do a few more purchases in the near future. Thank you AMAZON.com
B00371QQ0M|4.0|I took the wrapper off this last night and sat down for the 3 hour marathon.  I already knew I liked the movie because I saw it in theaters years ago, but I can not say I was very impressed with the adaption of it to blueray.  Both the sound and the video were lacking the quality that I have been taught to expect from blueray.
B000JSI7C6|1.0|what a shame--a great action war movie like this and they didnt put the directors cut edition on the blu ray release--a 3 dvd collection in the transfer to blu ray-blu ray is one edited disc-its missing 20 minutes!!!a lot of action missing here - terrible!get the 3 dvd collectors edition--the pic quality is same as blu ray-really good- what a disappointment and SHAME on you that put this together for release--evidently you had NO regard for this movie OR its fans

1894502701|3.0|I thought that the stories on this CD would match the stories in the actual books. They do not. The names used are different and the stories are abridged.
B002IKLZZY|5.0|I just want to give my thoughts on this movie...<br /><br />I would rank North By Northwest (1959) as one of the great movies from Alfred Hitchcock's prime, which, in my opinion, was the period from 1951-1964.  This movie was sandwiched between two of his greatest movies, Vertigo (1958) and Psycho (1960).  Basically the plot involves an innocent man who is chased from New York to Chicago to Mount Rushmore in South Dakota by agents who want to stop the man's interference in their plans to smuggle microfilm that contains government secrets.  It's a case of mistaken identity.  He's abducted, chased by these agents, and framed for murder.  Cary Grant gives a great performance in the role of Roger Thornhill, the innocent man being mistaken for somebody else.  James Mason plays the villain Phillip Vandamm, one of the agents in pursuit of Thornhill.  Mason was always great playing villains (think Salem's Lot 1979).<br /><br />Hitchcock always liked to use good looking blonde women in his movies.  Think of Grace Kelly, Kim Novak, 'Tippi' Hedren, etc.  Eva Marie Saint fits this mold perfectly.  Her acting and screen presence are good in the role of Eve Kendall, a counterspy who is working with the agents, but assists Thornhill by hiding him in her cabin on a train heading for Chicago.  That's all I want to say.  Watch to find out what happens.<br /><br />The opening credit sequence is a classic.  The musical score by Bernard Herrmann is excellent and matches up well with the action on the screen.  The movie has a lot of action.  Some of the scenes have become iconic through the years.  The movie of course has a lot of suspense (as you would expect from Hitchcock).  The DVD's clarity is excellent.  Disc 2 contains over three hours of extras, including documentaries on Cary Grant, Alfred Hitchcock's style of movie making and directing, the movie's iconic status, and the making of the movie.<br /><br />Overall, this is one of the best Hitchcock movies ever and I highly recommend it.d it.
0374290024|4.0|Ian Morris' \\"Why the West Rules for Now\\" is a big picture examination of human histor, and a better than average example of the genre.  Morris walks the reader through the human story from pre-history to history to the near-term future to explain the current status of human geo-politics and societal development.  Morris' basic thesis is that biology, sociology,and geography are essentially deterministic of human history.  The book is written to be accessible to the general reader.<br /><br />Morris does a nice job sorting out human pre-history.  The reader need not buy into his chosen scale for measuring societal development to appreciate his comparisons of East and West.  His forays into alternate history certainly spice up the narrative.  Morris can't quite decide whether heroes and bunglers affect the course of human history or whether the outcomes were already pre-determined.<br /><br />The author's conclusion is that mankind faces the fateful choices of a bio-tech \\"singularity\\" or a catastrophic \\"nightfall\\" in the next 100 years.  Oddly, he displays no skepticism about the current debate on climate change, is immoderately alarmist about the dangers of nuclear war, and imagines an uninterrupted, even acelerating curve in the development of current human technology. His assumptions are certainly subject to challenge, making his conclusions less than convincing to this reviewer.  Recommended as an educational look at human history.
B002SRQ214|5.0|I've always been an Intel fan but their higher prices forced me to go AMD to stay in my small budget and  I have not been dissapointed! This is a very fast processor and thru my motherboard I can over clock it  to be even faster but have not tried to do that yet. At this point I don't see the need! I'm also using  Windows 7-64bit OS and 4 gigs of OCZ memory on an Asus M4A88TD-M motherboard and all components are playing well with each other! I had problems with my first motherboard but thats another review.  So far i'm very satisfied with this processor and highly recommend it for those sick of Intel's higher  prices. Good luck on your first build :)

B0042RJWTM|5.0|I don't think it's so much about the passing of the West as the passages that humans make.  As the songwriter said, everything must change.<br /><br />While Fraker in general does a good job, some of the editing and transitions are indeed a little clumsy.  But the wide-screen vistas are truly enthralling and the vignettes that tell the tale of the collected cowboys are entertaining and cumulative.  The camaraderie really comes through.<br /><br />Today is March 19, 2011 and I'm having trouble thinking of a better movie that I've seen recently than Monte Walsh.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Excellent is expected thanks.
B003PBB4ME|4.0|A couple of key points:<br /><br />It is plastic.  Not super sturdy.  Use with a light camera only.<br />The threaded mounting screw is single (does not have that second pin to keep the camera from rotating on the mount).  This creates some problems if you have a heavy camera, or one with a heavy lens.  I imagine this is always a problem for DSLR users, but for me with a heavy lens on my otherwise light camcorder (CANON HV30 with WD-H43 lens) the camera seems to swing a little on the mount.  At some point, I fear that if I over tighten the mounting screw, I'll damage the camera. The mounting system is otherwise pretty well designed.  You can put your camera in a multitude of positions (forward, back and side to side) as to balance the rig nicely for single handed shooting.<br /><br />I've made a shock mount (from PVC and rubber bands) for my external mic.  This I mounted off to the side of the X-Grip handle using a metal plate that I found in a box full of old bike parts.  It works really well.  I'll take a picture here soon and post.  The X-Grip is pretty flexible in this regard:  it allows for some creative modification to your camera system - like an erector set.  I've seen some pretty awkward systems out there - people trying to mount all kinds of crazy stuff to a consumer camera, and ending up with an un-manageable nightmere.  This mount should bring some sanity back to us tinkerers.<br /><br />For the money it's pretty darn good.  As long as you don't expect too much (it's NOT a steady cam, it's NOT super sturdy), you should be pleased.  I does allow for some great low angle action shooting, and it is a nice way to mount accessories.<br /><br />Two last things:  You will not be able to use the viewfinder (use the LCD screen), as the handle gets in the way (this is clear from the photos above).<br />Also the box claims that you can mount the whole thing on a tripod.  It does have a threaded hole, but the \\"feet\\" of the X-Grip will get in the way of any higher end tripod quick mount plate.  I am unable to use this on my tripod system.  It should work on a tripod with a narrow mounting plate or a monopod.  It should also work on a smaller cheapy tripod.le to use this on my tripod system.  It should work on a tripod with a narrow mounting plate or a monopod.  It should also work on a smaller cheapy tripod.
030726999X|2.0|I was extremely disappointed with the quality of the hardcover booked I ordered!  While the jacket was pristine, the binding, cover, and many interior pages were very marked up, bent, and stained!  several pages were actually quite gross!  Wasn't much savings after shipping!

That was my case, and I lost a RAM slot. But, it lowered my temps 10 to 15 degrees C. Because of the \\"wind tunel\\" it created with my case fan, it also lowered my GPU temps 4°C. The cooler almost fit in my case, I was lucky that the lid closed(my case is CM Elite 335).

1439102724|4.0|... and the main character. As always, I love the characters that Jodi Picoult creates and even the situations which are mostly believeable. However, as always, I think she winds things up too quickly, without a sense of real closure, almost as if she were tired of writing or thought it was time to end the book.  SPOILER ALERT:   The idea of a grown woman finding love with another woman without ever having been attracted to woman before is not at all unbeliveable to me. Given the circumstances she found herself in, Picoult made it seem almost inevitable. And the fact that her ex-husband was so outraged and shocked was also not unbelieveable. But the ending was predictable and I wanted to know what happened to the suicidal teenager.  The idea that the ex was going to marry his ex-sister-in-law thrown in by a sentence in the last chapter was also jarring.    Overall, I enjoyed it; but I didn't think it was one of her best.
B003NHRIVQ|4.0|So far I have loved all adaptions of Nicholas Sparks novels. I won't lie I was a little taken back by the fact the Miley Cyrus got the lead role of Ronnie. I have a little sister so I have seen her acting before and she's not bad but she's not very good. I was shocked to find that she didn't do a terrible job like I believed she would. Some scenes were a little sketchy like in the hospital but I think she did an ok job. For what Miley lacks at points the other actors make it up. I love Greg Kinnear and I think he is an amazing actor but the true star of the film was Bobby Coleman who played Ronnie's little brother, Jonah. I don't think there was a dry eye in the theater when he was crying. If this kid don't blow up I'll be surprised. I think it's a little to mature for Hannah Montana fans but I do suggest it for Miley Cyrus fans. If you hate Miley then I suggest don't watch, you'll just be annoyed. I do recommend the film to fans of the adaptions of Nicholas Sparks novels, I think it stayed true to the novel.
0783226837|5.0|They sure don't make 'em like this anymore, do they? \\"Tremors,\\" starring Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward, finds two friends on their way out of town suddenly grounded when corpses start popping up and gigantic monsters which somewhat resemble earthworms start springing from the Earth. It's a fight for survival as the townspeople must find higher ground and avoid becoming soulfood for the bizarre creatures.<br /><br />\\"Tremors\\" is essentially a homage to the monster movies of the 1950s, and it works, firing on all cylinders and never failing to entertain. The creatures are gruesome and strange, while the characters are often wacky and eccentric. Obviously the film is carried by solid performances from Bacon and Ward, but at the core, the creatures are the stars and truth be told, nothing quite like them has appeared in a movie like \\"Tremors.\\" Most importantly, though, the film moves at such a brisk pace that it never sags or loses momentum, giving it unlimited replay value.<br /><br />The film inspired a string of direct-to-DVD sequels that failed to capture the thrill of the original. Even still, its reputation is still that of an enjoyable and energetic monster-mash with a host of fun performances. A film that never gets old, and in many ways, is vastly under-rated, \\"Tremors\\" is a roller-coaster ride you'll want to take again and again.<br /><br />On a side note, the DVD is absolutely terrible in regards to its picture quality. Sure, the film is always worth watching, but this release makes it rather painful. Collector's Edition my butt!
B00003CXMG|4.0|I caught this movie late one night on tv and couldn't peel my eyes away. It truly is an interesting movie and I highly recommend it to anyone!
B000FUF6QS|4.0|Perhaps the cult film to end all cult films -- due to the fact that it is a cult film that concerns, well, a cult -- \\"The Wicker Man\\"* is a highly influential and surreal story about a devout Christian police officer sent to a remote island in Scotland in search of a missing girl. Things go awry, as not only does the hedonistic way of life these islanders enjoy clash with that of the officer's beliefs, but also because no one will tell him the truth about what happened to or what will become of the missing child.<br /><br />Filmed entirely on location in Scotland, \\"The Wicker Man\\" has a sense of authenticity that is driven home by a pair of knock-out performances in Edward Woodward and the legendary Christopher Lee. Woodward, as the would-be hero, keeps things grounded even at their most bizarre and ridiculous. His grim facial expressions and looks of horror say it all. Lee, on the other side of the coin, is playing the enigmatic leader of the cult, and is certainly in his prime in one of his finest roles. Elsewhere, the acting ranges from questionable to non-existent, but because these two men deliver in spades, the film rarely suffers.<br /><br />Granted, there's a wealth of musical numbers that make things a bit awkward, but maybe that's the intention. Afterall, most of the film seems aimed at catching its audience off-guard and creeping it out, and to that end, it certainly succeeds. Even nearly forty years later, it still manages to at least make you uncomfortable one way or another, whether it's through the unassuming scenery, the outrageous costumes and rituals or simply in its shocking ending that will certainly leave you with a little extra left to chew on. \\"The Wicker Man\\" is quite simply a unique horror film that is must-see material. Whatever you feel after watching the film, you'll certainly be affected one way or another, and that's the film's ultimate brilliance.<br /><br />* Not to be confused with the more (in)famous 2006 remake starring Nicolas Cage.
B003L20IHE|3.0|I purchased this movie because the book was soo amazing. Although the movie is good and well acted I was dissapointed. There were several important scenes in the book the movie left out. I feel as if the book gave more depth to the story. Zac Efron did a lot better job than what I gave him credit for, this guy will become a great actor. I believe he's on his way to becoming the next Brad Pitt or George Clooney. I recommend this movie for people who have not read the book, but I also still suggest you read the book.
B00006FDCD|4.0|Originally airing as a mini-series on the ABC channel, \\"It\\" is an adaptation of the popular Stephen King novel of the same name. Taking place in the fictional small town of Derry, Maine, the story concerns seven tightly-knit friends growing up in the 1960's who find themselves being stalked by an evil entity referred to only as It. It takes the form of Pennywise, a creepy looking clown that is likely to scare the pants off of anyone with even the slightest case of coulrophobia. Though they seem to vanquish the creature early on, they find themselves being drawn together thirty years later to yet again face their fears in hopes of redeeming themselves and saving their hometown.<br /><br />This nearly three-and-a-half-hour, almost-but-not-quite epic tale is delivered by director Tommy Lee Wallace, who made a name for himself in the 1980's by directing such genre sequels as \\"[[ASIN:B00009YXHJ Fright Night Part II]]\\" and \\"[[ASIN:6305137307 Halloween III - Season of the Witch]].\\" While obviously working within the constraints of a major network, Wallace manages to milk just as much creepiness out of his flick as he does nostalgia for the characters and the time in which they originate from. Aiding the film greatly is an iconic performance by Tim Curry as Pennywise. While he's more of a wise-cracking Freddy Krueger type than the malevolent force of nature he's supposed to be, he's the one character that owns the film, and is instantly recognizable in his own right, even twenty years later.<br /><br />The film is fleshed out with a great cast, too. John Ritter and Annette O'Toole make up the best of the adult cast, while Jonathan Brandis and Seth Green are among the highlights of the younger cast. While most horror films fall victim to annoying kids, \\"It\\" is an anomaly in that its child-actors are more sympathetic, believable and interesting than their adult counterparts. Sure, the 60's back-drop helps, but you can't help but feel for these kids and their daily struggles. When it comes to the story of the adults, though, there's a bit too much melodrama, and the second half is where things get a bit soggy and start to lose focus. Capping off with one silly ending (see: goofy looking giant spider), \\"It\\" is a hardly perfect but solid adaptation of great material. Thankfully, its running-time breezes by rather easily, and as far as made-for-TV horror films, it doesn't get much better than this.the story of the adults, though, there's a bit too much melodrama, and the second half is where things get a bit soggy and start to lose focus.

B003F3NDWG|5.0|This show is distinctly unique in its ability to combine Drama and Suspense with Humor, but also stands out because of its outstanding writing and its amazing ensemble cast.  Initially, I fell in love with the show because of its interesting and unconventional story-lines, and its creative writing, but have since fallen in love with it because I developed a love and connection to all of the show's main characters. After the first season, I was worried that the writers might lose a bit of steam, and perhaps have a bit more difficultly coming up with new creative shorelines that keep fans coming back for more. Fortunately, the writers didn't disappoint and the show came back stronger than ever. Suspenseful episodes like Tick-Tick and Boom, will have you sitting on the edge of your seat, while episodes such as The Double Down will have you laughing out loud.     With the second season, there also comes a chance to delve a little bit into each character's background. Specifically, we learn more about Kate and her Mother's murder, and we also get to see what became of Esposito's old partner as well.    And then there's the infamous chemistry between its two title characters, Detective Kate Beckett and Richard Castle, which only seems to grow more with each passing episode. You can expect that Kate and Castle will be one of those 'will they won't they ever get together' couples that leave us yelling at our television screens every so often in frustration. If only they'd just realize how the other felt! Unfortunately, you can also that the writers will milk the relationship for pretty much everything its worth before they ever act on it. Even so, they write things in a way that works to the best of their advantage. I think that Kate and Castle's relationship could best be described as an enigma, but somehow, they make the perfect crime-solving duo. I have to say that I enjoy the often creative banter that goes on between Castle and Kate during their cases, as well as the downright hysterical dialogue that goes on between Esposito and Ryan. I think the show utilizes the humorous aspect of the show perfectly mainly because it seems to offset the dark nature of some of the cases on the show.
0525951652|4.0|Okay, I am not going to be so petty as to give such a great novel only one star because the Kindle version is more expensive than hardcover...I only took one star. But seriously...the Kindle version uses less resources, does not need to be shipped. And yet it costs more?!   I am looking forward to the subsequent novels in the trilogy. Maybe by then they will be cheaper than hardcover.
B004HYDL1K|1.0|This movie was just awful. Acting was terrible, plot was trash and to top it all off its preaching about immigration and open borders the whole time.

B003Y5H51K|1.0|So I ended up watching the movie on accident, but at the beginning I could already tell that it was going to be a cliche scary movie. Yeah the scenes were pretty spectacular and while the actors did the best they could with what was given to them it was still only about five minutes of movie that was actually worth watching.<br /><br />DESCRIPTION: Carl(not really clarified but he possibly works with NatGeo?) is a billionaire who likes to fund projects for Frank(an experienced respected caver)Well Carl brings his Gf along with him to one of the biggest unexplored caves in the world to see what the progress is. While down in the cave they only have 3 or so days before a huge tsunami comes an floods the entire base camp, unfortunately the storm comes early and inside the cave cant get out through the opening an have to hurry to find another way out.<br />In all the action that happens the true nature of the characters comes out and while some are truly respectable others are completely disgusting...which makes up the best five minutes of the movie...<br /><br />In typical scary movie fashion lots of the actors die on a regular basis and barring two scenes the movie isnt really worth the your time...
B004I2K4DY|3.0|What in the world were they thinking when they cast Nick Jonas as Marius??? Terrible idea. He doesn't have the proper broadway vocals to pull of the part. He ruined the part completely! Sad because the rest was wonderful. Just can't beat the original cast though...

Rape, child abuse, domestic violence and sexual harassment affect every character in this book. It was a real downer.<br /><br />If you're looking for light, relaxing entertainment, I would advise looking elsewhere, no matter what sort of hype you've heard about it. I found the violence difficult to slog through to get to a vanilla murder mystery. However, if you like gritty novels or the like, go right ahead. I might read the second book in the series, if only to see Salander kick in a few more heads!<br /><br />More at: [...]

B002VECLVO|5.0|Colin Firth just scored a well-deserved Oscar for [[ASIN:B003UESJH4 The King's Speech]]. It should have been the back-half of a Hanksian double.  He was even better in Tom Ford's 'A Single Man.'<br /><br />The 'single' in the film's title has double meaning: not only is Firth's character bereft by the death of his partner, in time and place he's not allowed to experience his grief with anyone.  A phone call from his partner's cousin (voiced by Jon Hamm!) tells Firth's George of the tragedy.  But the caller also informs George that the services are 'family only.' That Firth isn't considered family is clear by inference.  Though it's clear that the caller sympathizes with George, he also makes clear that this is an unofficial call made unbeknownst to immediate family.  From there, we watch as George - life abruptly untethered - slowly unravels.  Julianne Moore - so different from her [[ASIN:B003L20ICE The Kids Are All Right]] role - is excellent as Firth's one true friend.  It's not a straightforward friendship - Moore's character is a handful - but it's the one thing that George has to lean on.<br /><br />To the film industry's surprise, designer Tom Ford got this film done and done so well.  Ford got scads of looks askance and eyerolls in Hollywood when he announced he wanted to try his hand at filmmaking.  By all accounts, it was an arduous trail to the screen. Ultimately, this creative talent could not be denied.<br /><br />That Ford cares about look and can create effectively in a visual medium shouldn't come as a shock.  Every frame of the film bears the imprint of his careful and inventive eye.  It's a beautiful film.  What does surprise is Ford's ability to attract Grade A talent to this freshman effort and his focus on narrative.  This is a small story, expertly told.<br /><br />Now that Colin Firth has won his Oscar, here's hoping that his new fans work start working backwards through his catalog and take a chance on this gem.
030726999X|4.0|I'll miss reading books where roughly half of the characters are female and none of them are damsels in distress. On the other hand, I am okay reading less about violence against women, which is why the first book in this series was so rough on me. Luckily I was still interested after finishing \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" and the trilogy got better and better for me. I know the sheer about of detail is annoying for a lot of people, but it never bothered me that much, and it even works in Larsson's favor in this book, because there is a lot of information about Zalachenko that I wanted to know. I had a lot of empathy for many of his characters, even Blomkvist. \\"The Girl who Kicked the Hornet's Nest\\" was definitively my favorite of the Millenium series, and I'm a little sad that I've finished them all.<br /><br />[...]

1593082037|3.0|A delight to read! I suppose there are a reason some books become classics, and after reading it I can certainly see why the adventures of Sherlock Holmes are one such thing.    \\"The Hounds of Baskerville\\", unsurprisingly, is my favorite. \\"A Study in Scarlet\\" is the first of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's early Sherlock Holmes stories, and it's clear he doesn't have the pacing perfect yet. I was pretty confused when we jumped to Utah after the first part, and I was seriously concerned Doyle was never going to explain the motives of our killer. \\"The Sign of Four\\" seemed a pretty specific story to give Watson a wife, and the obvious premise make the whole story a little cheap, as well as the rather. However \\"The Hounds of Baskerville\\" happened after several of the shorter stories (a personal favorite of those being \\"The Adventure of the Red-Headed League\\"), and Doyle appears to have matured a bit as a writer by that point (published in 1902, with \\"A Study in Scarlet\\" being published in 1887) and the story required the reader to know next to nothing outside the context of the story.

1593080409|3.0|I suppose I started reading this collection for the same reason I watch regular TV shows every week. I wanted consistently interesting short stories, and that's exactly what I got. However I made a mistake reading them all straight through in this convenient collection, and the formulaic plots bothered me more than they would have otherwise.     I did notice an improvement in terms of the mystery complexity, which I appreciated. No where is this more evident than in \\"The Valley of Fear\\", which uses an extremely similar set-up to \\"A Study in Scarlet\\". Both stories have two parts, the first of which takes place in 1890's England and the second some years previous in America. However everything else about \\"The Valley of Fear\\" is a vast improvement! The murder mystery is much more clever, the action is better paced, and the second part was well-introduced as well as being a mystery story in it's own right! Clearly Sir. Doyle had come into his own as an author by this point, and his skills greatly improved with practice.    I also enjoyed the change in Watson's \\"voice\\" over time. Sir Doyle seems much more comfortable in his writing abilities by \\"The Valley of Fear\\", and I felt there was less awkward prose. I noticed Sir Doyle has a very fanciful way of describing the scene, which appeals to me greatly. I shall always imagine a foggy London day as John Watson saw it.    [...]

It just goes on and on and on like a bad nightmare from which you cannot awake.  It's ironic that a movie about dreams is the perfect cure for insomnia.  Update: 30 minutes after writing this review, I finally turned this pretentious bore off for good.  With each new ridiculous plot contrivance I was getting angrier and angrier at the inept storytelling and mindless special effects.  I couldn't care less what happens at the end.

B002ZG975Q|3.0|Having read the book and seen the movie within a week, I'm here to say that the movie could have been so much better.<br /><br />As is often the case, the book is always better than the movie. Often, for reasons unknown, the screenwriters/ directors/ producers decided what is worth keeping from the novel and what isn't. And often it is us the readers who are left disappointed with their vision.<br /><br />So what left me disgruntled was this:<br /><br />Why make Kyle refuse to learn in the movie? Part of the beauty of the novel was that Kyle found solace in the beauty of books and learning. I loved that he was able to relate his situation to the dark characters he connected to in classic novels. The book emphasized that Kyle went through a process where he began to care about himself as a person and cultivate his mind. Also, this process truly shows the relationship between him and his tutor and it's a very special one. In the movie- Kyle refused to learn and scoffed at books and tutoring. Not only is it a terrible message to the youth marketed for this film- but it also ruins a substantial part of the depth of this character. In the novel, one really feels that Kyle is becoming a better person by committing himself to education and relating his experience to classic literature. AND because of this new-found love- he is able to relate to Lindy and that is one of the reasons they fall in love. This was IMPORTANT! He reads Jane Eyre for the girl because she asks him too. That was a beautiful metaphor, of course, and it was just totally missed in the film.<br /><br />Why change the character Sloan? In the book, Sloan was the female version of Kyle. There are essential parts of the book where Kyle learns about love and humanity by realizing that Sloan is superficial and was using him for popularity. Even her role at the end was essential to realizing the growth of Kyle. In the movie, they take Sloan and make her into a victim which just doesn't work. At one point Kyle hears Sloan say that she \\"had to be mean\\" because she felt Kyle made her that way. This makes Sloan into a nice girl who was forced to torture other people because Kyle forced her too. This just didn't work for me in the plot line. If she really was this nice person under her mean (fake) exterior, then perhaps she would have actually loved Kyle or helped him after his transformation. In the book, she only loves him because he's popular and handsome and when he goes to her, she runs away. This was an important series of events! It was part of his learning process about love and the depth of people. The movie pretty much axed her part and changed her role in the story- therefore taking out another essential slice of the pie.<br /><br />Why in the world did they change the end of movie?! When I read the book, I found the last pages to be so powerful and amazing. I re-read the ending several times and then sat back, sated, feeling a surge of romantic pleasure. I was really shocked that they removed the best part of the story- which, in essence, was the part that made you, the viewer/reader, realize that Kyle really had \\"changed\\" and deserved a second chance at life. What he did for his lady love was so amazing and was such a true sacrifice, I just melted! The movie as it is now just ends sorta ho-hum. An anti-climatic reunion at best.<br /><br />I've read the critic reviews and nearly all of them say this movie isn't good because the transformation of Kyle just isn't believable. The movie seems silly to them because it has no depth. I think the reason why is because all of the parts of the story that showed his growth and depth were removed. I could go on about parts that are missing, but basically the filmmakers just used the shell of the story and didn't include the meat inside. You can't tell a viewer that the beast has evolved simply by telling them it's so. You have to prove it.<br /><br />I felt the movie was sorta awesome but always fell short of total awesomeness. I had watched the preview to the film at least a dozen times and, in my mind, I had filled in the movie with so much possibility. I was so excited to see the actors take the depth of the novel and really push their limits to showcase this fairy tale as a real modern-day possibility. But I felt they were often holding back. There were some moments I cheered because I felt the real poignancy of the depth of the story... but overall I felt like the actor's were told to be deep but not too deep.<br /><br />I don't blame this on Vanessa or Alex. I could almost feel them both wanting to do more. So what happened? Can we do so more filming and add in the parts that were missed to make it a real winner?<br /><br />This really had potential but I suggest you go read the [[ASIN:0061963283 Beastly Movie Tie-in Edition]] if you haven't had a chance.<br /><br />******EDITED EDITED EDITED FOR AN UPDATE******:<br />For those of you who are interested, the DVD special edition of the film has the correct ending of the movie under the \\"deleted scenes\\" area of the Special Features as an alternative ending. Perhaps it was too violent to show in theaters, who knows... but it's actually better (in my opinion) than the cheesy ending they tacked onto it.d, in my mind, I had filled in the movie with so much possibility.

1589795474|5.0|Do you know that most millionaires don't look like millionaires?  That's right.  Most millionaires drive regular cars, live in regular homes and you would never guess they had a million bucks or more in the bank!    \\"Its not what you earn, its what you save.\\"  This is the overall theme of The Millionaire Next Door by Dr Thomas Stanley and Dr. William Danko .      There are so many people with luxury cars, designer clothes and fancy homes that are living in a fantasy. Its all on credit or loan. No real cash in the bank, just material items for everyone to see.    The Millionaire Next Door is NOT a get rich quick plan, but a disciplined practice of saving and investing wisely over a lifetime.    One section I found interesting was about the difference between children who are given large sums of money throughout life and those who earned money large sums of money on their own (regardless of their families net worth).  It is amazing how much smarter people are with money they personally make themselves as opposed to those who are given many \\"gifts\\" year after year.  For example, some wealthy families give their children $10,000 annually because the family can give it tax free.  Most children who receive this gift live a lifestyle beyond their means and the money is gone often before or as soon as its received.    The book's research finds that the only financial gift that doesn't seem to affect spending habits of children is the gift of a debt free college education.      I did find a few of the facts and figures to be a little boring and overkill at times, but the stats did prove the authors overall theme of the book, \\"It's not what you earn, its what you save!\\"    Regardless of an up or down economy, this is a great book to learn the principles of saving and how it can greatly impact your financial future.  You might also develop a new outlook on budgeting and feel more comfortable with an attainable lifestyle!

B000J4QWMC|4.0|\\"Miami Vice: Unrated: Director's Edition\\" is adapted from the popular 1980's TV series. I had only watched a couple of the TV shows, and I think it helped that there were no pre-conceived ideas on how this movie worked.  Jaime Foxx plays Ricardo Tubbs and Colin Crockett plays the other undercover Vice cop, Sonny Crockett. They are in their prime, fighting crime in summer white suits.  The drug bust story is standard, but the special touches of blue lighting, windblown palm trees, boat races and chases with rushing water in almost every scene's backdrop give the movie flair and style.  Ricardo and Sonny are working hard to identify the group behind a recent string of drug-related murders.  A romance springs up between the unlikely mob's oriental businesswoman and Sonny.  Boating to Cuba from Florida for a drink, dance and romance is spice for the plot<br /><br />The movie is moody and blue with some violence.  Although it was the overused standard story of infiltrating a drug lord's gang and busting them, the movie held my attention.  For me it was the right movie for my mood at the time.

The special effects were the best part of the film, and they had lost all their punch.  I realized it was not being shown in the format it had been filmed in and had been edited to fit the TV screen.  In other words, it was not in letterbox format.  I looked it up on Amazon and found you had a version that appeared to be in the original format, so I ordered it.  It arrived very quickly, and I have to say it turned out to be just as exciting a film as I remembered it to be.  What a difference to see a film the way it was meant to be viewed.  This special edition comes with an additional special features DVD that includes interviews with some the the actors and persons who worked on the film.  I am glad I took a chance and made this purchase.  My only request is that you make it clearer when a DVD you are offering is in the letterbox format.

I wont bother with details of plot and seetings too much as 1000's of reviews exist already.

B004EJUMT2|5.0|One of the most talked about metal bands in the underground scene of recent has been Swedish band Ghost. Only releasing a demo and a single over the course of the last 2 years, and few festival appearences, the band of unknowns who keep their idendities secret most likely have been shaping their sound and concept and after finally unleashing their debut album in 2011, everyone is wondering what will it be like. The band who plays in hooded cloaks, hiding their faces, and the frontman who is dressed as a Satanic arch bishop type Pope, in some circles would be humorous. But instead of playing typical Satanic/thrash metal ala the Norway black metal groups or anything resembling Cannibal Corpse or Lamb Of God, they play straight ahead throwback 70's style metal. Making the concept acceptable somehow.    In todays times, its impossible to be original...everyone has seen everything and something as theatrical as what Ghost does seems like something from a by gone era ala, Alice Cooper and Kiss and even lesser known Demon and Pagan Altar, who Ghost take alot of influence from in the doom metal catagory. They are all about Satan, as the opening piece Deus Culpa sets the tone with a funeral like organ hymn. We blast into Con Clavi Con Dio. With a chugging bass line this at first sounds like another boring trip into thrash metal but thats quickly done away with as the extremely melodic singer comes on. The frontman CAN sing, not growl or shriek. Ritual is probably the best tune on the album, the highly melodic guitar intro is a page right out of 70's classic rock, transforming into a Sabbath esque riff with a highly memorable chorus and another batch of catchy riffs at the end that ensure you will never forget this song. Thats Ghost's game here. They are evil, they are dark but theyre going to drown the evil in catchy and hooky choruses and riffs that you dont just headbang to once and forget but you will be singing along with. It's almost like pop. Highly impressive. Elizabeth (yes, about Countess Bathory) familar metal subject territory doesnt seem overdone when these guys take it. As with Stand By Him and Satan Prayer. Once again all familar things. We've heard these riffs from Sabbath, Mercyful Fate, Witchfinder General, and Candlemass but oddly in 2010/11 in a sea of boring mainstream metal and coporate Hot Topic controlling it all, the songs are hugely refreshing. Death Knell is a masterpiece. The soaring choruses demonstrate the singers ability, powerful and truely evil and yes, catchy as Hell.     The slight organ stabs add a classic psychedelic feel to the whole thing, nothing is overdone. A little of this little of that. The bass, normally buried in extreme metal genres is upfront here, even with their heavy stage show, musically Ghost never overwhelm you. They seemed to have stirred their pot of songwriting and song structure to a near perfection. Even the album artwork, looks like something right out of the more artistic 70's when record sleeves and the art involved were a big deal. The ghosty image towering over the gothic castle might seem a little cliched (and inspired by Salem's Lot) but once again, its just enough that it doenst make you laugh. Ghost have found a perfect formula of demonic dark and melevolant hard rock, ripe with catchy hooks, that just reminds you why you love Sabbath, Blue Oyster Cult, and the other famous dark bands. They are a celebration of those bands from the past that cut alot of ground to play dark and evil music in times when it was very forbidden. They know the past well and they make it their own. For alot of metal heads, this might not be your cup of tea, no matter how dark it is, the band has of course caught alot of flack for not being thrashy or singing with growling vocals or whatever else the norm is for boring metal anymore. Most importantly though, where other dark satanic metal bands fail to truely ignite the feel of evil, Ghost somehow does it, once again as stated, no too much, and not too little. They will be a permanant addition to your Halloween soundtrack. Go get Opus Eponymous and keep an eye on this inventive band in the future.

B0001ADAVK|5.0|(SOME MINOR SPOILERS BELOW; ALSO SPOILERS FOR DPS)<br /><br />...but I love this film. I've read most of the negative reviews both here and on IMDB, and I can't help but agree with many of the criticisms, particularly where time-period and anachronistic elements are concerned. I know that every 1950's clich&eacute; is at maximum wattage and Katherine Watson arrives at Wellesley College not on a train but in a Way-Back Time Machine from the 21st Century. Many of the main characters are one-dimensional and unconvincing and the plot is plodding and predictable. I understand that it's probably meant to channel the spirit of \\"Dead Poets Society\\" for women a little bit, and I can see that some of the main values taught by the respective teachers in each are similar, but DPS hit audiences on a deeper level, with a darker ending. I mean, one could hardly compare Neil Perry's suicide to Betty Warren's divorce. Professor Keating is blamed for Neil's suicide and is fired, but in the end no one blames Katherine for Betty's divorce (except maybe Betty's mother) and Katherine makes her own decision to leave Wellesley. The students in MLS are grown-up, college seniors ready for \\"real\\" life; the boys in DPS are all still just high-school kids. Professor Keating is loved almost immediately and absolutely by nearly all of his students; Katherine has to slowly earn the respect of her students, one at a time.<br /><br />Despite the critics, I do believe that there ARE truths in MLS, if only because my mother, who lived and attended college at that time, pointed them out to me. She confirmed that most of the young women she attended school with were NOT in college because they had dreams and ambitions of high-powered careers. None of the girls in her classes, dorm or sorority wanted to be scientists, bank managers, lawyers, doctors or CEO's (that she knew of, anyway.) Most of them viewed post-graduate employment (as a bookkeeping clerk, secretary/receptionist, a nurse, or the main career option - a teacher) as simply a way to make a living until Mr. Right came along or as a way to pass the time and supplement their income for a few years after marrying until the kids started coming.<br /><br />That doesn't mean they didn't appreciate their college education. Though my mother admitted freely to being one of those women who cared more about getting an \\"MRS\\" than a BofA, she said a good many of the girls were quite interested in the outside world, artistic freedom, literature, philosophy, politics and current events. She knew a few young women who continued on to graduate school or nursing school, but she knew of only one person whom she called \\"career-oriented\\" at that time, and that girl's eventual goal was to be a school principal like her own mother was. For the most part, in my mother's experience, the girls she knew in college weren't all that different from the girls in MLS. My college experience 30 years later was different. The girls I knew in college were there because of what they wanted to achieve professionally, not to look for mates.<br /><br />I still love the look of the film; the costumes, cars, building interiors, the campus scenery, as well as the music, both the period music and the score. I sympathized with poor Nancy Abbey whose dreams of a home and family are fading, and Giselle who was looking so hard for male approval and companionship to make up for the father who left when she was still young and impressionable. I at first hated Betty Warren along with everyone else, but I truly felt sorry for her in the end. Spencer Jones is unpleasant enough, but Jordan Bridges is a very mediocre actor. He just came across as flat and wooden.<br /><br />Even though I know intellectually that the 1950's were not the idyllic, simple time our contemporary culture has made them out to be, this film reaches me on an emotional level and has the power to make me feel pleasantly nostalgic for a time that at least seemed a little more stable thanthe time I grew up in.me I grew up in.

It's a book about, imagine this, \\"Why We Get Fat.\\" I read it from cover to cover and found it packed with information and a lot of good science to back up the author's unorthodox theories. He digs through scientific studies about obesity, going back 150 years. Surprisingly he finds that most studies agreed that carbohydrates cause us to get fat, not a high-fat diet. It was only since the late sixties that ideas about the causes of obesity started to change from too many carbohydrates to too many calories. You have to read the whole book, especially the chapter where Taubes blows apart the conventional wisdom of calories in/calories out. Piece by piece he expertly builds the case for his theory with research study after research study. It would be hard to walk away from reading this book without seriously questioning everything you thought you knew about why we get fat.

B00005ABKC|5.0|Somewhere during the punk era it seemed as if rock n roll suddenly became more about making nothing but endless noise,even if the movement itself moved beyond that. But people like Bruce Springsteen and Tom Petty here were shaking the landscape a bit differently and when Tom & The Heartbreakers released their album [[ASIN:B00005ABK8 Damn the Torpedoes]] it was sort of difficult to figure out if this was the ending or just the beginning of a great career for Petty. It turned out to be the latter as Petty's ultra melodic and well produced varient of 60's pop/rock really caught on in a huge way and this follow up did indicate that he was not just another one trick pony who'd only have a few popular albums under his belt and than disappear.<br /><br />  Now that's not to say this album took too many chances that he didn't on the follow up.\\"The Waiting\\" is yet another excellent hook-n-riff filled pop/rocker in Petty's classic style and a most of the other songs on this album are very much of a piece:if you like the hit,the rest of the album pretty much follows suit. So it's an easy ride all the way through even if the style of the music isn't that variable. There are of course several exceptions. \\"Nightwatchman\\" and \\"The Criminal Kind\\" both have a strong bluesy grind to them and the slick production winds up transforming it all into a funk-rock style that works well for Petty's drawling style. The album concludes with the delicately crafted piano based pop ballad \\"You Can Still Change Your Mind\\",a strong highlite.<br /><br />  This is one of those pop/rock albums of the early 80's that's aged very gracefully,mainly because he produced the album with a strong sense of songcraft and a fluid instrumental style that while not always heavily innovative was very dependable and certainly more than enduringly radio friendly. And this actually turned out to be the beginning of an even more consistant string of albums,hits,videos and concerts that would endure not only throughout the 80's but all the way up into the 90's as well.os and concerts that would endure not only throughout the 80's but all the way up into the 90's as well.
B0047IIYQI|5.0|It's great. It's fantastic. It blows you away.  It kicks ass. It takes no prisoners.  It's unbelievable.  I don't even like to write reviews, but I want to give this all the respect it deserves.  I have never listened to music that grabbed me like this album does.  It's captivating and exhilarating.  It hits every emotion.  I haven't listened to something this great since....ever.  I am listening to it now....Thistle and Weeds...loud as I can get my speakers.  I have to stop and let the chills in my spine settle.  Anything anyone said about this album is absolutely true.  You have to get it and you have to start listening.  I'd recommend it to anyone.  AAAAAWWWWAAAAAKKKKKEEEEE MY SOUL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B001EN71CW|5.0|A show set in space, with impromptu \\"family\\" crew, cowboy in space feeling, and wonderful dialog.  Just like when Family Guy was cancelled, Fox made another awful decision by taking this show off the air.  It is a \\"must have\\" on disc.

B000088DSQ|2.0|Nothing regarding the intellectual capacity of these musicians of this recording can be derided regarding this cycle, but their intelligence is most certainly misplaced. The breadth with which these forces afford Beethoven and the listener is something that I personally associate with Scriabin or even George Crumb. The phrases are too elongated, and therefore boring and the orchestral accompaniment is uncomfortably tempermental. While everything is wonderfully executed, it all is strikingly uninteresting.     The concerto of this set that turned me off most was the fourth (I feel Beethoven's most difficult to perform successfully). It just isn't done that well. It's overloaded, it doesn't move along, it languishes when it should be energetic and the play between piano and orchestra in the final movement is quite irritating. It's very strange Beethoven.    On page 11 of the liner notes the question is asked, \\"why another complete recording of Beethoven's concertos?\\" Aimard answers that he would never have imagined recording these \\"warhorses.\\" Well, there you go. They are played just so, like warhorses, plodding and abruptly bleating here and there over the course of 3 cds. Pass.    Are there any recommendations to the contrary of this set? I think Gilels/Szell/Cleveland is quite good and Ax/Previn/Royal Phil is decent as well.    The best 4th Concerto?? Guiomar Novaes with Hans Swarovsky, if you can find it.
B000Q66JXA|5.0|I want to say that this Blu-Ray is much better that the DVD. I justed received this BD and compared it to the DVD. The picture is cleaned up. I think Warner did the best work they can on this old movie. They did the work I was waiting for 'cause I was very disapointed by the DVD picture which was dirty and sometimes fuzzy.<br /><br />The DTS HD-MA track is outstanding for the musics.<br /><br />You can buy it to replace your DVD. You should buy it if you don't already have any copy of this great master-piece.
B0034G4P7G|5.0|Don't get me wrong, I loved \\"The King's Speech\\". It's a heartwarming movie with terrific acting. But The Social Network is a tour de force. The screenplay is brilliant, taking you from the present back to the past, in flashbacks that build a stunning story that will have you riveted to your seat. Every actor is pitch perfect and if there was a film award for ensemble cast, The Social Network would surely have won it. Buy it, watch it, and rewatch it to catch all the small nuances that make this movie great.
1591843790|4.0|I live my life by the credo \\"If it's worth doing at all, then do it with passion.\\" Guy's latest book offers numerous insights and practical tips about how to apply that passion for a worthy cause and truly enchant the people that you meet along the way.<br /><br />I've previously attended Guy's live presentations, and I'll always remember his engaging smile and sincere persona. He knows how to inspire people - to demonstrate how you too can strive to apply your strengths, to be the best at your chosen craft.<br /><br />This book offers meaningful suggestions on how to enchant your customers, your employees and any other key stakeholder that shares a common-cause with you. The basic point of Guy's guidance is this: authentic impassioned communication is more powerful than traditional attempts at persuasion (such as trite advertising which often demonstrates contempt for the people that it's intended to attract), influence, or other legacy marketing techniques.<br /><br />Beleaguered legacy marketers will learn how to achieve Likability, and how to achieve Trustworthiness - apparently, these are fundamental qualities that people in mainstream marketing organizations need to rediscover.<br /><br />Frankly, some might view this perspective as an indictment of all that is inherently wrong with old-school manipulative marketing practices, and therefore what must change to reform and redirect the efforts of this profession.
0060936223|1.0|I gotta say, I was looking forward to this book but I didn't enjoy it. All that navel gazing about what Smith wanted to do with her life was a yawn when the real story about what drove her companion, Mapplethorpe was only glossed over and hinted at. I know Smith is a seminal figure for many, but her generation (and mine) produced so many more interesting people. Skip this book, it's a downer.

B003TKYAVI|5.0|I've only played Halo 3 for a few hours at a friend's house, and only a fraction of it was campaign.     And yet, I love this music. Some soundtracks are only good once you've seen the movie/played the game (like the Inception OST). However, this album stands alone quite nicely.    It starts out with Luck, a quiet, noble track tinged with reminiscent sadness. Then, the tracks slowly build in intensity. Halfway up this build is Out of Shadow, taking full advantage of stereo sound and electronic beat to create a subtle but extremely pleasing rhythm. Later comes a peak, This Is the Hour, a heroic variation on the main Halo theme, which then subsides into chilling darkness for the track Dread Intrusion. However, the music becomes more positive and epic through Follow Our Brothers, Farthest Outpost, Behold a Pale Horse, and Three Gates. The creepy beginning of Black Tower segues into an sad and emotional second  half, followed soon by the touching Keep What You Steal. The beautiful choral music at the beginning of Halo Reborn is echoed in Greatest Journey, which then becomes the main Halo theme. And boy, what a theme it is. Greatest Journey is the climax of the entire album. Tribute and Roll Call have the general feeling of victory, but not without sadness and sacrifice and remembrance. Wake Me When You Need Me is a quiet, emotional track, echoing many of the tones of Luck and bringing the album full-circle. Finally, extras are tacked onto the end, including the beautiful track Never Forget, a slow and emotional mix of three subtle themes.    And soon, all too soon, the music is over.     So, you play it again! :D    It's epic, it's subtle, it is the compilation of Marty O'Donnell's work on Halo 1 and Halo 2, and it surpasses both.     Plus, look at the value! Over thirty excellent songs for only nine dollars? A must-buy for anyone interested in soundtrack music.
1401323820|5.0|The book is a fast read with a lot of character development. This book is much more of a stand alone than the second book.  I enjoyed this book more than the second.  I read the second book first and found it pul too much directly from the tv show.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|I've always been a pretty big fan of the Harry Potter film-series, but this movie just left my in awe.  After the Half-Blood Prince, I wasn't exactly thrilled.  But this film not only advances the roles of the existing cast, but brings back certain roles and makes the movie that much better.  Daniel Radcliff, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint just blew me away with this installment.  All three of them came back with an edgier attitude and added more maturity to their characters.  I enjoyed seeing all three grow from Sorceror's Stone to the final film. The obvious gradual improvment makes this series perhaps one of the best if not the best film in history in terms of novel-based films.  I can't wait for part II in July!

B003L20ID8|3.0|Overall an OKAY movie, not great nor is it bad.  I say that because I watched this movie with high expectations and I find myself considering this movie to be a bit overrated.  The negative part of this review is that, I would've liked if they explained the concept a bit more thoroughly.  I'm a kind of guy who wants to understand not only the plot but the concept of the movie itself.  Such movies like Equilibrium, The Matrix trilogy, Inception, etc. go more in depth with the concept and details.  In my opinion I thought the \\"notebook\\" could've had more explanation to it and how certain loop holes are figured out.  On top of that, I was looking for more action and \\"mind-boggling\\" scenes, but found myself watching a more romantic film.  I'm a little nitpicky I admit.  A movie that COULD'VE been an Oscar nominated film, falls short.  The Pro of this movie is the plot, I like the idea of how fate is created and or \\"adjusted\\" by an organization.  It makes you think about certain events and situations that happens to ourselves and really connects to the audience.  Overall, a decent film that had potential to be better.

B004LY8KG2|5.0|\\"Let Me In\\".    The title sends a shudder up your spine.    Based on the novel by Swedish author John Lindquist \\"Let The Right One In\\", this may be the best vampire genre movie I've watched since Stephen King's vampire masterpiece \\"Salem's Lot\\".     An independent film with a powerful cast including \\"Kick Ass\\" star Chloe Grace Moretz, it's based in 1983 and tells the story of 12 year old Owen who's brutally bullied at school, has divorced parents, an alcoholic mother he lives with, and is desperately seeking an identity. He is soon befriended by new 12 year old neighbor 'Abby' (Moretz), a girl with a dark secret.     \\"Let Me In\\" is a love story, a redemption story, a tragedy, and vampire movie all rolled into one. Of course, it is the polar opposite of the usual Hollywood flash and glamour portrayal of vampires and delves into what a dark curse vampirism really can be, so all you \\"Twilight\\" and \\"Vampire Diaries\\" fans beware. This movie shows you why you DON'T want to become one of the \\"undead\\".    These independent films don't have the flashy multi-million dollar special effects budgets that the big Hollywood mega-films do, and neither does this one, and that's a blessing, because it's what makes this film deliver so well. It's the ACTING and the story being told that carries this film. The cast is a superb chorus of talent, intelligence, and experience. Moretz (Abby), Kodi Smit-McPhee (Owen), and Richard Jenkins absolutely shine in this film.    This may be one of the best films I've watched in over 10 years, and if you enjoy the vampire/horror genre, watch it. Even Stephen King said \\"'Let Me In' is the best horror film in the last twenty years\\".     My only beef is one of the deleted scenes included in the Special features called \\"Be Me\\". If you've ever watched \\"Let the Right One In\\", this was a scene in the movie that actually came from the book when Eli showed Oskar the brutal way she/he became a vampire. For some reason, this extremely important scene was deleted from \\"Let Me In\\", because it showed how Abby, like her counterpart Eli in \\"Let The Right One In\\", used a form of telepathy to rely to Owen how she was turned.    Watch this scene after the movie, or include it in where you'll realize it should be during the movie.    Also suggested is the original Swedish film \\"Let The Right One In\\", which is every bit as good as \\"Let Me In\\", maybe even better because it delves more into the original book's story. I've bought this one from Amazon too and enjoyed it thoroughly as well.     The book is also an incredible read, and it very hard to put down.       Read more: [...]

I toss them in and out of a backpack constantly and have yet to see any wear and tear on them a month later.  They are very comfortable except for the occasional pressure on the top of the head , but that is very slight and with a little adjusting goes away.

B004SLAA1G|5.0|Those who are fans of \\"Bones\\" know that B&B belong togather but haven't been able to get it togather, They are crazy about each other but for a long time wouldn't acknowledge it and when Booth finally did Brennan still wasn't on the boat. And while I admire their ability to put it away and work togather, as a fan I have been waiting, sometimes not patiently, for them to admit the truth and give it a chance. Finally we are getting there, it is too soon after Hannah for Booth to get involved again and Brennan still hasn't completely opened herself up to the possibility of a real and permanent love, so this non-beginning was perfect. Great episode in all, and when you get to the really good parts I think they were perfectly played. They acknowledge the attraction, then the bad timing but basically make a pact to give it a try when they are both ready. Not to fast and perfect, just like real life and real emotions. Finally making progress.

B0041KKYEM|1.0|Perhaps the perfect commitee movie.  There isn't a personal or idiosyncratic moment in the entire film. It oozes 'safe'.  The movie team has taken a theme from The Red Shoes:  Life immitates Art immitates Life etc. and mixed it with a theme from the Michael Redgrave episode from Dead of Night:  The Creator is the Creature is the Creator etc.  Into this mush the movie team seems to think they have created not a horror movie but a ballet move so they threw in a lesbian sex scene to get red-blooded American boys to go see it.  After over 40 years in the business Barbara Hershey is still playing Barbara Hershey roles.  The people at the Foreign Press Club and The Academy have deemed Natalie Portman's 90 minutes or so of whining and sniveling to be acting.
B002ZG997C|3.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />For those who were unable to suspend their disbelief (or more importantly, their common sense) regarding the many implausible moments in 'The Book of Eli', let me say unequivocally that I am with you! However, let me explain why I gave this film a '3' out of '5' (or 5 out of 10 on Imdb) despite finding the whole thing quite hokey. First of all, there are many films that are far worse than this one; secondly, I thought that the cgi effects and set design were actually quite good, especially the way in which the filmmakers created their 'equivalent' wild west post-apocalyptic town; and finally, the film actually has engendered a great deal of internet postings defending the many absurd, implausible ideas and scenes utilizing all kinds of tortured reasoning, which I found quite enjoyable to read!<br /><br />The Hughes Brothers have come a long way since their urban crime drama, Menace II Society. They have proved they can proffer up a post-apocalyptic shoot-em-up as good as any mainstream director. Taking a cue from M. Night Shyamalyn's 'Sixth Sense', not only do they know how to dispatch (i.e. 'off') the bad guys in a multitude of creative ways (hands chopped off, cross-bow shootings, one gunshot take downs, etc.), they also can throw in all kinds of clues, pointing to the fact (SPOILERS AHEAD--DON'T READ IF YOU WANT THE TWIST ENDING SPOILED FOR YOU) that Denzel Washington (Eli) has been blind all along. How exactly is Eli able to kill all those biker dudes (first with a knife and later with a gun) without being able to see them? The answer, of course, is in the 'book' itself. Wouldn't you know it, but the Book of Eli begins with a 'B'; yep, shock of all shocks, it's THE BIBLE!!! Channeling 'Ben Hur', the Hughes Brothers make the argument that miracles can be found even in a post-apocalyptic world! Like the Apostle Paul, Eli's 'faith' allows him to miraculously survive multiple onslaughts, including a bullet direct to the gut by bad guy Carnegie.<br /><br />The warmed-over Christian shibboleth that miracles occur due to 'belief in faith alone' is just another canard where we must suspend our disbelief in order to enjoy this film. But there's one small problem. Eli has been carrying one copy of the Bible that he's been trying to memorize for years, and it's in Braille!!! Since the Bible in Braille would consist of many heavy volumes, this is one plot point which even some of the most fanatical defenders of the film, have trouble explaining away.<br /><br />There are other moments in 'Eli' which I still had a lot of trouble explaining away myself. What about Eli walking around for days after having stocked up with only a canteen of water? All the copies of the Christian Bible have been burned but copies of the Jewish Bible and Koran end up on the library shelf at Alcatraz? And how exactly did he escape from the room when Carnegie and his thugs lock him up? I guess Eli finds a 'way' because all those who believe in God, manage to do so.<br /><br />Perhaps one of the most weakest ideas in 'Eli' is Carnegie's belief that obtaining the Bible will enable him to extend his power. Since he and Eli are only a few of the people who actually have heard of The Bible, why does he assume that introducing it to the post-apocalyptic survivors will enable him to bring them under his fold? Since the majority of people in the new world have little or no knowledge of prior literature, Carnegie could have wrote his own book which he could have used to sway the masses. Of course, somehow the Bible is supposed to have some kind of a mystical, intrinsic power (perhaps rays emanating from the book itself) which leads Carnegie to believe he can use it as a brainwashing tool. Since it's never demonstrated how Carnegie could become more powerful by getting hold of The Bible, the stakes are never high enough for us to care whether Carnegie gets the book or not. Now if Eli knew the location of a nuclear bomb, that's a Macguffin that I could believe Carnegie would want to get his hands on!<br /><br />There seems little doubt that the most completely miscast actor in 'The Book of Eli' is Mila Kunis. She seems so out of place in this film that her performance actually drags the film down a notch or two. USA Today film critic Claudia Puig couldn't have said it better about Kunis in her film review: \\"Vacuous and far too glam, she looks as if she dropped in from a Ray-Ban commercial.\\" Didn't anyone find it a bit ridiculous how Solara (Kunis) suddenly acquires Eli's amazing martial arts-like skills and takes down most of Carnegie's henchmen in one of the final scenes? Denzel also has become painfully one-note in many of his recent film roles as a middle-aged actor.<br /><br />Finally, I'd like to chime in on the controversy as to whether Eli has converted to Islam when he arrives on 'Alcatraz Island'. A Muslim is not allowed to read any religious book except the Koran, so when Eli dresses up in a white robe as he translates the Bible, I think the Hughes Brothers were suggesting that all along he was some kind of post-apocalyptic Essene. Just my interpretation!<br /><br />I would like to thank all the faith-based defenders of 'The Book of Eli' along with all those who employ tortured reasoning to explain all the ridiculous goings-on in this film. Without you, I would never have enjoyed this film as much as I did and given it a passable rating.ve Carnegie would want to get his hands on!

B004H1YH66|5.0|I am one of those lucky people who saw the original movie in the theater in 1982, fell in love with the score, rushed out and got the original vinyl and then the CD as soon as it became available. Ditto for Conan the Destroyer. These four soundtracks, 2 on vinyl and two on CD, have been perhaps the most treasured pieces of my music collection for some 20 years. I put them into digital format so I can listen again and again without wearing out the originals. Now this. Wow! Just to hear the old faves again with a slightly different twist here and there...magnificent! My favorites, \\"Wifeing\\" and \\"Funeral Pyre\\" literally brought tears to my eyes. And the new pieces are great too. The drums are perfection! Get this. It's wonderful. Well worth the money. It came yesterday and I have listened to it perhaps four times through already.

And you know, too, the challenge of fixing the problems, or having someone fix them for you.  It's not usually a matter of life or death though, is it?<br /><br />But imagine what would happen if a whole lot of computers, controlling critical or important functions around the world were suddenly infected, and the infection was self-replicating and could not easily be fixed. In today's world, computers are an integral part of almost everything.  So it's worryingly easy to imagine what can go wrong.  The implications might not just be financial.<br />In `Zero Day', the effects are deadly.  An airplane drops thousands of feet in seconds, and the crew are unsure whether they can recover control.  Computerised medication programs in a hospital have gone awry, resulting in multiple deaths.  Automatic production line robots in a car assembly plant malfunction, causing the death of a man.  And that's just the beginning.<br /><br />Jeff Aiken, a former government analyst who witnessed the mistakes made before September 11, suspects that these events are not just coincidental.  Jeff begins to believe that these incidents form part of a serious cyber-terrorist plot, and finds himself in a race against time to try to prevent international disaster.<br />I mostly enjoyed this novel:  it all seems frighteningly plausible, and the plot developments kept me turning the pages to see what would happen next. At times, though, the narrative was overwhelmed by repetition, and while it reinforced the dangers it slowed the flow of the story.<br /><br />`We live in a cyber-world at our own peril.'<br /><br />Note: I was offered, and accepted, a copy of this book for review purposes.<br /><br />Jennifer Cameron-Smith
0316143472|5.0|David Sedaris is a very funny story writer whose work often appears in The New Yorker, and who can occasionally heard on NPR reading his stories.  This collection of some two dozen of his autobiographical stories titled, WHEN YOU ARE ENGULFED IN FLAMES, exhibits the humor, caustic wit, and sometimes bizarre, even shocking episodes that one has come to expect and love in Sedaris's work.<br /><br /> In ENGULFED IN FLAMES he discusses such things as the drug use and cigarette smoking of his younger days, his having been solicited by seemingly ordinary folk who pick him up hitchhiking, his attempts at language learning (including the universal applicability of the phrase, \\"D'accord!\\"), and his experiences of everyday life in France, Japan, and the United States.  Curiously, the more exotic stories tend to be those set in America--at home in North Carolina, in New York City, or on the road.  In one story (\\"Town and Country\\") he describes a patrician, refined looking couple who sit next to him on a flight, and who turn out to be as crude and foul-mouthed as they come.  Some of his funniest, most poignant stories involve his mom.  In a flashback to childhood (\\"In the Waiting Room\\"), his mom spies him chewing on a big chunk of meat: \\"'I hope you choke to death,' she said.  I was twelve years old, and paused, thinking, Did I hear her correctly?  `That's right, piggy, suffocate.'  In that moment, I hoped that I *would* choke to death.\\"  This reminiscence happens to take place as he finds himself accidentally--a misprision of language-- sitting in a French doctor's waiting room clad in nothing but his briefs.<br /><br />The longest story in the collection, \\"The Smoking Section,\\" has to do with Sedaris's quitting smoking while also living in Japan for a time.  Written as a journal, the piece celebrates the joy of smoking, the challenges of quitting, and the peculiarities of life in Japan.  The funniest parts have to do with his frustrated attempts to learn the language.  A young Korean woman in his class named Sang Lee, also struggling with Japanese, serves as his foil and so the target of his humor.  At one point early on, he learns that most of the class already knows hiragana, the Japanese syllabary.  One of his classmates tells him he \\"just picked it up.\\"  \\"'A flu is something you \\"just pick up,\\"' I told him....  `Picked it up,' indeed.  I know two characters.  That's it.  Only two.  This puts me ahead of that loveable nitwit, Sang Lee, but still, it's not much of a lead.\\"  It's to Sedaris's credit that his mockery, though at first surprising and sometimes even shocking, never comes off as cruel.  There's always a humanity and decency to his stories.

B000RJO578|4.0|This is a fun, goofy film that delivers on the fun and is a satire on the buddy action films of our recent past.  Fans of SHAUN OF DEAD will recognize Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg, and, for trivia buffs did you see two supporting actors who were Roman Patricians in HBO's ROME?  According to the inside rumors  Santa Claus was Peter Jackson and the ex girlfriend was Cate Blanchett but since both of them are masked its hard to verify.  Lots of gags and other such jokes with physical humor included.  Helps if you like British humor.  Timothy Dalton, former James Bond, plays a smarmy villain.  A lot of the story points are way way way way (waaaaaayyy!!!) over the top but if you go in knowing this is a goofy satire, well, you should be okay.  It helps if you've seen a lot of movie references they are making but it's not required for you to enjoy the film.  If you are a total movie buff a lot of the supporting cast were villains and foils in older action buddy pictures.  My favorite movie reference was in regards to what a cop said to Jack Nicholsan in CHINATOWN.  In closing what more is there to say but \\"Yarp\\" and you won't understand that reference unless you see the picture so check it out. HUMOR: B to B plus; STORY/PLOTTING: B plus; CHARACTER/DIALOGUE: B plus to A minus; WHEN WATCHED: Mid March; OVERALL GRADE: B plus.
B000AP04L0|5.0|I love this whole movie!  I is my all time favorite.  I am not really a movie goer but this is one that I have played over and over again and never get tired of it.<br />\\"Corprate Account Payable, Nina Speaking ...Just a moment!\\"<br />I have been in a cube most my life and so much rings true....this is a celebrated movie and a tribute to all of us that work in the corprate world!<br />I happen to like me work, getting there was a struggle...we all have been Peter Gibbons at one point or another in our career!<br />\\"Hey Peter....Watch you Corn$%#\\"<br />There are so many lines from the movie that just make me laugh. I know the budject for the movie was 10Mil..and I knowthat opening week it did 4mil...10 mill total...but the DVD is a cult classic...it must be reeling in the bucks!
B003Q6D27S|4.0|Amazing movie i never thought it would be the best one ever but wow was i wrong.Everyone needs to see this DVD it is the greatest!
0307272702|5.0|I bought this book and I now understand why my blood sugar was so out of control. The book explains what causes insulin resistance which was never clear to me.  I have been able to dramatically reduce my diabetic medication by reducing carbohydrates. The effect is immediate. Nothing else was working, and before this I was in the process of increasing my insulin and  still was unable to get my blood sugar under control.  Update:  I followed the abbreviated diet recommendations in the appendix, and lost 30 lbs in the first month. Now I have lost a total of 75 lbs, with about 10 to go to get to my ideal weight for my height.  More should be done to promote this book, it is a real miracle for those who have ever struggled with weight. I can verify that if you cut out the carbs suggested, you will loose weight;  A lot at first then as you get closer to your ideal weight it will slow but continue.  I used to be a type 2 diabetic, but within a few weeks of starting this, I had to get off of all my medication to prevent my blood sugar from getting too low.  This scientist has done his research, and I recommend doctors and nutritionists learn from this book and stop teaching people to eat low fat and 'calories in and calories out'.  I really did no exercise during this whole time, just ate no carbs. I now have tremendous energy, and have had many complements from people asking how I did it. Of course I recommend this book.
B00005JKDR|1.0|Everyone knows the movie is great but the disc is damaged and wont play thru. The other movie we got at the same time plays great.
B004M6BQ9W|5.0|Love the show - Cher was great although I thought she should have had more singing.  Christina was sexy but too much of the show was focused on her as a hero.
B0040UAYI4|5.0|I read alot of the reviews here before I purchased this.  At first I thought I would be getting the version that was already 2.0 but when I got the package it turns out to be ver 1.0.  I had to update the firmware which took awhile.  I read the directions on the forums and they were very helpful.  One thing to keep in mind is my EEC had the turbo keys already on so when I played BFC2 I wondered why I couldn't use the aim button.  Turned all the turbo keys off and it works great.  Using mine with a G700 mouse and Microsoft Arc keyboard.  Make sure you use a 32 bit OS to update the firmware.  Great product!
B004DK5CW4|4.0|I loved this DVD.  However, must say if you don't like horse stories or don't remember Secretariat and the story of his owner it might not be for you.  Truly an amazing animal.  I've watched it 3 times so far and keep replaying the Belmont race; never been another race like it.
0743298020|1.0|this is absolutely the worst book i have ever had to read. the plot never thickens as well as it could have. if i didnt have to read this book for my english class i would have stopped by page 20.
031261246X|5.0|Firstly, I'm the first to admit that I'm not a huge fiction reader - at all - I tend to read technical books over novels. I'm definitely one of those people who just reads the blockbuster novels (Harry Potter, Dan Brown, Lord of the Rings, etc...).  I like what the masses like - and I really liked Mark's novel!  I read it into the early hours last night, not being able to put it down. And then couldn't sleep - I couldn't stop thinking about how easily this fictious story could become reality.<br /><br />-- Story --<br />Dan Brown's \\"Digital Fortress\\" and \\"The Lost Symbol\\" came to mind a few times while reading the book. Sure the story uses a standard formula, but in no way does this detract from the story. Not until the very last pages did I know how the enormity of the issue was to pan out - it was a very enjoyable rollercoaster.<br /><br />-- Technical Merits --<br />Mark is highly regarded as an expert in IT in general, and even more for his security knowledge. Added to this his creation of the Sysinternals utilities and his authorship of the \\"Windows Internal\\" books, he is uniquely positioned to write the book. My job at Microsoft is very similiar to the hero of the story - Jeff Aiken - and involves hours of tedious analysis to resolve complex issues.  I can vouch that Mark never strayed away from what is possible today; something that made the book more and more compeling as the story unfolded.<br /><br />-- Read It! --<br />If you use a computer, at work or at home, with any skill level, you should read this book.  Mark has clearly explained the threat to all that are willing to listen.
0736092269|5.0|I am a Pilates instructor (STOTT PILATES) and group exercise instructor.  Both the illustrations and explainations of muscles is very good compared to some other books I've seen.  However, what really sets this book apart are the bits of additional information scattered throughout.  Mr. Delavier provides several pages explaining how to stretch certain muscles.  Moreover, he provides several pages of explaination on how to prevent injury and how a person's skeletal structure will affect an exercise movement.  For example, he explains why the squat of a short-limbed person will be different from that of a long-limbed person.  He explains the importance of the rotator cuff muscles of the shoulder joint and why some injuries occur.  This book is well worth the money and a good reference to have on hand.
B001NLKT60|4.0|This second novel in the Millennium trilogy digs deeper into the past of Lisbeth Salander. The book opens with Lisbeth on holiday in Granada, figuring out what is going on with the couple in the next door room and solving esoteric maths problems.  A hurricane interrupts her sojourn and forces her back to Sweden, where she confronts her life and her past.<br /><br />The first part of the novel sets up the readers sympathy for Lisbeth's off-beat lifestyle and broken character. Only to be brutally interrupted by a triple murder. From there the novel turns to a full-scale police hunt as various parties strive to uncover the truth. A truth that will bring to light \\"All the Evil\\" and uncover Lisbeth's past.<br /><br />The story is compelling right to the end. Unfortunately, the ending is somewhat far fetched and stretches credibility. Maybe if the author had survived, it would have been reworked. As with the Girl with the Dragon Tatoo there are also some aspects that are not well drawn together. In spite of this, it is one of the most gripping stories I have read for a long time.
B000006UD8|5.0|The remastered tracks make the old Warner Brothers CD sound like a cassette tape. THIS is the way Machine Head should be heard; not too mention you get the B-Side \\"When A Blind Ma Cries\\" which is quite good, and remixes of the whole album, including two very tasty Quadrophonic mixes of \\"Maybe I'm A Leo\\" and \\"Lazy,\\" both of which sound amazingly good and have slightly different song structure, different lead parts, etc. Very intresting if you've heard this album many times, like I have, and you want a slightly different take on the same songs. Highly recommmended!
B003XQRZ7E|2.0|When I first heard about this band forming, I was intrigued.  I'm a big fan of Bonamassa & Sherinian - for very different reasons.  Sherinian does great prog/metal/fusion stuff and has a great love for guitarists - and has featured some of the best in that genre on his solo albums.  Bonamassa is arguably the best blues rock guitarist around today - not really the typical Sherinian type - but Joe can rock with the best of them and he pays (and plays) tribute to the older fusion masters.  Intriguing possibilies indeed.  I couldn't have been more wrong.      I'd never heard of Hughes and figured Bonham was just riding daddy's coattails.  I wasn't sure what their contribution would be.  Then, a few months before the CD was released, the YouTube videos of their live first effort. And then it became apparent that this would really be a Hughes thing.  There are clearly plenty of folks that like his vocal style, but it's not for me.  Yet despite that initial off taste, I bought the CD.      What a disappointment.  Hughes' bass playing is unremarkable, and I just can't get past his grating vocals to enjoy what might lie beneath.  Bonham IS just riding daddy's coattails - he's just a pounder.  Sherinian is not there at all, strictly an unnoticed side man - what a waste.    But 2 stars instead of 1, then, because Joe is still Joe.  Thankfully, we get to hear his far more pleasing voice occasionally, and he's still one of the greatest guitarists of them all.  Hopefully there won't be any more Black Country offerings - and I see there's a new solo Joe release in a few days, yay.    I'm still intrigued by the possibilities of Joe & Derek in a prog/fusion outing - wouldn't that be a hoot...
B004KAB3ZM|5.0|The three Apollo 11 astronauts couldn't have been more different as individuals.  Commander and first moonwalker Neil Armstrong was an enigmatic, unemotional civilian, LM pilot Buzz Aldrin was the dark, brooding and ambitious second banana, and the man who would orbit the moon solo while his colleagues took a walk was Mike Collins, a test pilot blessed with a bemused outlook and a talent for the written word.  43 years after that flight, Collins' autobiography is still the gold standard for astronaut autobiographies and a fascinating look at the slide-rule days of Gemini and Apollo.      Collins' writing is constantly good natured, thoughtful, and often not without great humor.   His description of survival training for the possibility of a jungle landing, and the cheery how-to manual provided by the helpful Air Force is sidesplitting.  \\"Snakes?   No problem there: 'Poisonous snakes are far less abundant than most people think.'  They have no idea what I'm thinking, which is, if snakes are so goddamned non-abundant, what is?  'The crocodile...is very dangerous.  It is abundant.'\\"    Collins survived test pilot school (many of his classmates did not), survival training, a flight with the legendary John Young on Gemini 10, spinal surgery that bumped him off the Apollo 8 mission, and wound up as the command module pilot for history's greatest voyage.  Whereas Aldrin sulked and brooded about being second on the moon, Collins claims that going 99% of the way was just fine with him.  Along that way he writes with great skill about his colleagues, his bosses, and what now seems like a much simpler time, where money flowed to space exploration to meet the goal of a moon landing issued by a slain President.       Collins prose is remarkably free of ego or swagger - though modest people are seldom, if ever, test pilots.  One gets the impression that overcame his self-described shortcomings as a student through plain hard work and \\"stick-to-it\\"-ness.  He also had enough self-awareness to realize the strain his profession was placing on his family.  Had he remained an astronaut he almost certainly would have commanded Apollo 17 and taken a walk on the moon himself, but three more years of travel, simulations lasting all hours and continued strain on his marriage wasn't, to him, an even trade.       Collins was barely 40 when he resigned from NASA, and one wishes that he'd write \\"Volume II\\" to chronicle the rest of his interesting post-NASA life.
B002RL7W9W|5.0|Bought this for my son's 6th b-day.  It was a hit!  My other son's 8yrs & 4 yrs like to build these too.  Keeps them busy!
B0025VLELQ|5.0|I grew up with this movie. I've long regarded it as one of favourite movies of all time. I eagerly awaited a sequel that never happened, but that's another story.  The Last Starfighter DVD was never released in my region (4), so I always meant to get around to buying a region 1 version. Now, I'm glad I didn't buy the DVD.  When this title was released, it was my deciding factor to break into the Blu-Ray format. Amusingly, I actually ordered The Last Starfighter before I ordered my Blu-Ray Player.  I have a Blu-Ray drive in my computer, so not having a player didn't stop me from watching it.  It has been 2 months since I bought this title on Blu-Ray, I've watched it 4 times since.    Quality:  I have seen this movie HUNDREDS of times on TV & VHS. I know every word & every scene.  I don't claim to know anything about black levels, pq, etc, but I can tell you, this is way beyond the best video quality I could have ever expected to see on this movie.  I'll tell you what I do know... The grain throughout the movie is barely noticeable. I didn't really pick up on any extra details, as I've said I have seen this movie hundreds of times and I've probably already noticed every detail there is to be seen.  What I did notice is how much clearer everything is, how much of the text can be read on various objects, etc.  At the beginning of the movie when Otis exclaims \\" It's gonna be a sparklin' day..., Sparklin' \\" That, I think, can also describe exactly what that particular outdoor scene looks like on this Blu-Ray release. (And pretty much all of the other scenes too.)  The CGI looks as fake as ever, but you can expect that. The documentary on the disc tells you that they actually had to engineer the software to CGI up some things that had pretty much never been done before.    All up, A+  A title I am very, very proud to own. And I will no doubt watch it hundreds more times.
B0043RT8JU|4.0|I loved his first book, Looking for Alaska, so much that the day I finished reading it I went to the book store to buy another one of John Green's books. I wanted to get An Abundance of Katherines but they had no copies so I grabbed Paper Towns. I didn't feel as strong of an attachment towards the characters as I had hoped but I found myself reading a million words a minute when they were in Q's minivan.  All in all great book, but not my favorite.
1592402690|5.0|This book is truly wonderful. Geoff Emerick was a fly-on-the-wall in the studio with the Beatles in various capacities from the very start through the bitter end of their spectactular recording career. At last he has written a book of his own memories and it's all here - the personalities as he honestly saw them (not as gods but as blokes), the fun, the recording tricks, the squabbles... you will feel like you are there. Unlike many rock books, this one is very well written and reads chronologically, smoothly, and evocatively. (Credit co-author Howard Massey for bringing out the best in this inherently interesting material. Well done.) It refrains from being overly technical, so the average reader has a good idea of what's going on... and oh, the things that went on. Again, this book is truly wonderful. A splendid time is guaranteed for all.
B0041EVYVK|3.0|I'm going to agree that Lanois really ended ruining this album. I first came across Whitley's voice on a radio show and was blown away by the powerful raw voice. Then I came across their NPR Tiny Desk Concert [...] and became even more excited to hear what would be on this album. Unfortunately, the overproduction on this album really takes away from Whitley's voice and you lose a lot of the emotion that comes through from live performances.    Stick to YouTube and the NPR video if you really enjoy Black Dub.
B0025KVLU6|5.0|I am buying cds now, but I already have every Beatle album on vinyl.  Of course its great, its the Beatles
B004P9FAK2|3.0|So as we all noticed there will be NO extended cut for these new boxsets, but check out the aspect ratio specification listed on Amazon, 1.77 instead of 2.40??!!! Dose that mean that these new sets will be released on IMAX version? If that is the case then these new sets are definitely worth getting, extended or not.
B0014DC0AK|5.0|First of all Chuck you are dearly missed. I was never into death metal,because I like vocals. I must say that this album definelty has some awesome vocals, riffs and beats. If you are unsure of death metal,pick this one up for it will make you a believer.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I was very impressed with this author. She uses the boy as the narrator and once you get used to his verbiage, it is so good and different from other books. Very entertaining.
B003YK42LQ|4.0|Another record with the classic kings sound--screechy distorted guitars, caleb's smooth rock voice, jared's silky bass lines, and nathan's ferocious beats. this album DEFINITELY beats the far, far, overhyped and (overrated) 2008 Only By the Night. Songs like Pyro, the Immortals, No Money, Pony Up, Pickup Truck all blow some of OBTN's tracks out of the water. Might not be as strong as 2007's Because of the Times, but it definitely comes tragically close. If you're a kings fan (or not), buy buy bo ba boo bay buy this album. cheers
B003YV64OI|5.0|Great CPU, easily unlocked the 4th core and I get 4 core CPU for the price of 3 core CPU, Just perfect :)
1401923127|4.0|I have recently been researching consciousness and thought creation books and every time I read a book, I like to keep a journal where I can take notes on what I think is valuable. After reading this book, I realized that I had taken about 8 pages of notes from miscellaneous facts to extensive paragraphs about the inner workings of the cell. Growing up, I never really had any interest in Biology or cells, but this book taught me a lot of valuable information in a interesting way that no teacher in high school could ever do. Bruce Lipton even dips his subject into quantum physics and for those who may have an interest in that, will find this book very entertaining. There is also some startling information when it comes to pharmaceutical drugs. For example: Iatrogenic illness (illness caused by your doctor) is actually the leading cause of death in the USA and the adverse reactions to prescription drugs are responsible for more than 300,000 deaths a year. Not a good sign for us as we have become the population, probably more Western than Eastern people, that need a \\"quick fix\\" for every illness. Even though Bruce Lipton explains so much of why cells act a certain way and how our minds work, I would of appreciated a little more discussion or help on how to harness my beliefs into more suitable thoughts. I guess I was hoping for a solution on how to think that could be explained in a self-help format. Nonetheless, this book taught me so much and at times I had to take breaks from it because I was taking in so much information. If you have any interest in how thought affects our bodies or how cells work, pick up this book. You will not be disappointed. Quite frankly, if you have any interest for this book, BUY IT!
B000JIJPZY|2.0|What I like:<br /><br />- Colorful<br />- Hanging objects are mildly entertaining<br />- Small<br /><br />What I Don't like:<br />- Baby was only entertained for about 5 minutes max<br />- \\"Musical\\" part was two 5 second tunes<br />- Claim that it will grow with baby. I think baby will not be amused by it as soon as theres anything else to look at.<br />- Pillow is so small its useless<br /><br />This will be the first to go when I start to sell my baby toys. I wouldn't bother saving it for my second child.
0385341075|1.0|This book was a choice for a book club I belong to.  I am a tender-hearted soul and found the last several chapters too gruesome.  I knew it had won the Booker Award so I did not expect such cruelty.  I have given the book away.
B000X418UE|5.0|This is a mid-1990 movie, so my expectation from the start is set for action films released at the time. However,the pictures are amazingly sharp in 1080p. It was hard to see any grainy images, even at fast action scenes. The audio is crystal clear. The explosions, car wrecks, and voice are all just simply super.    My only disappointment was the gun fighting and several other action scenes I only hear the sound from front/center speakers. This can be due to decoding 5.1 during that era still at infant stage (Twister to me was the reference standard to hear sound of debris travel from front to back speakers).    All features from DVD are here. There is a new \\"highlight\\" video clips allow you to \\"show-off\\" the movie in home theater.    I'm very happy with the effort put into this transfer, and it's a no-brainer to get for the fan of the movie, blu-ray, and home theater system.
B003UESJFG|5.0|Watching 'Megamind' superhero buffs might get the feeling they've seen this all before. Borrowing the origin of Superman(sort of) and giving him an evil nemesis with a super brain(ala Lex Luthor), one might come to the conclusion this story is a rip off of the \\"Man of Steels\\". It's all been done on purpose because it helps to make us feel we're in familiar territory, only to have the rug pulled out from under us!<br /><br />Megamind is a fun and smart parody of the superhero genre and with the help of some inspired voice talent and great animation, the story soars like a bird, is more powerful than a loco....um? well you get the picture.<br /><br />If you like animated films and superhero films, this is a must have. The Blu Ray/DVD combo pack looks and sounds great and has the usual extras associated with these releases.
B004NSVEAA|5.0|I'm adding my hat to the pile of fabulous reviews of this novel. The first 25 pages or so are admittedly tough to slog through, but stick with it. This is one of the best books I've read in several years. Read the rest of the reviews for more summaries and analysis. I'm only adding to the average to make this higher rated.
B000JML7EC|5.0|I'd forgotten how much I enjoyed this story the first time around. I \\"bought\\" it again once I got my kindle and thoroughly enjoyed reading it for a second time. The tale is one of a young man on a quest for gold, surrounded by pirates and danger. Some of the terminology may be difficult for kids, but the overall story is fantastic even if a few comments or descriptions are lost on them.
0738212415|5.0|I have another book on learning to draw (Drawing from the Right Side of the Brain), which is excellent and has helped me break through the barriers of my very non artistic left brain way of thinking. This one, though, looked like the author had a sense of humor and still made the concepts easy to understand. Also, it concentrates primarily on learning to draw basic 3-D shapes (sphere, cone, cylinder, cube), but also adds in the concepts of shadow, light, tone, etc. that are an intrinsic part of learning to draw. I'm having fun with this book. What's even better is that the author encourages the student to not expect perfection and that it's ok if your sphere is a bit lopsided. The point is to learn the concepts and practicing them will get your spheres rounder in no time!
1593080409|5.0|This has to be one of my favorite books/series. Some of the information in the books is slightly erroneous but it gives an idea of what was thought in England at the time. I didn't know before I started reading these that they are written from the point of view of Dr. Watson. I enjoy the story of how they meet and end up becoming roommates. They rent on Baker street and Watson originally does not know that Sherlock is a detective. But since he's a doctor he is interested in studying people and Sherlock proves to be a perfect subject. He has a deep knowledge of matters that concern him but when it comes to other things, he forgets them. For example, when Watson finds out that Sherlock does not know about the earth going around the sun, Sherlock responds that he will try to forget it so that he can leave room for the important things.     One of the other reasons that I enjoyed these writings is the information given about England. It is enchanting to read of a place and time when people rode in carriages and traps and delivered their card before they entered to meet you. It is also appealing to read of an individual, Sherlock, who is so dedicated to a study that his conclusions and deductions seem magical until he explains his methods to the reader. I think that I will hone my skills as well (with occasional laziness to fill the gaps).    A kids book that also has some investigations is[[ASIN:1416949755 From the Mixed-up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler]]
B000RHKARY|4.0|Early underrated guitarist Mick Taylor pre Stones.  Mr. Taylor is never given much credit for his greatness.  He didn't show off or move much onstage.  He never said much either, but his guitar does the talking.  Some nice performances by Mayall like The Death Of JB Lenoir also.
0156012197|5.0|Sometimes children's novels are the best books. This book would fall under this category. A little prince lives on a planet and tends his flower and volcanoes. He visits earth and meets some people on the way. The story tells of some life lessons he learns and teaches. One of the greatest things about this book is the message of finding what's important in life. That is one of the hardest things to do sometimes. We end up doing things and not realizing how they are affecting us and what impact they are having on our lives. Sometimes we need to stop and smell the roses. Sometimes we need to work and rake our own volcanoes. And sometimes we need to move our chairs so that we can see multiple sunsets. It's all about priorities and perspective. Another kids book I really enjoyed was [[ASIN:0316809063 Maniac Magee]].  Another book that was an allegorical book is [[ASIN:0061122416 The Alchemist]]
B004A8ZWT2|5.0|this is one of the best movies  that has came out since titanic<br /> its classy<br /> upscale<br />romantic<br /> action<br />suspense and adventure<br /> !! THIS MOVIE ROCKS<br /> I WANT 2 copies
B002N5N5M0|4.0|Like the previous Seasons of Dexter this season is again very interesting.  The disks by itself offer a good picture and sound quality. The extra's are not that impressive.  The only disappointing thing is that the subtitles are setup as CC only. So you can only see them if your TV and DVD player are equipped with CC technology. And even then, both my TV and DVD player ARE CC capable but I cannot see the subtitles.

B0025UHKNS|2.0|I've used this watch approximately 5 times and I'm still having trouble getting it to do what I want.  Once I get the screen to where I want it its fine but getting it to that point is maddening. The screen jumps all over the place as I'm trying to get a basic time, distance and pace display.  Went for a run the other day and somehow got a screen with a compass on it and wasn't able to get out of it. Can't figure out how to get it into power save mode so the batteryis always running down.  I'm fairly frustrated with this watch.
1439190275|5.0|This program has been so easy. Six weeks into it, I haven't been hungry and I've dropped an average of two pounds a week. I'm a tad over 65 and take hormone replacement meds so it has been a slower loss for me. I don't care...I feel great, have energy to spare and a slower loss is probably best for this gal. My slightly high blood pressure is now back to normal and has been since the second week of the program. My suggestion...grab a copy of this book and Dana Carpenter's 1001 Low Carb Recipes. Together, they make a dynamic duo and well worth the price. In all honesty, I only cook for me so it has probably been a bit easier than if I were cooking for a family. However, when family and friends visit they love the food I fix from these recipes. Food is so delish that you never feel deprived and not being hungry all the time is such a bonus. I have to remind myself to eat...this coming from a gal whose three favorite things to do is eat. Good luck and God bless!
B00338QENI|5.0|Ms. Skloot has done a superb job of bringing Ms. Lacks to life and really showing there's a human side to medical science which all too often neglected as scientists, doctors and other professionals easily get caught up in the details and fail to see the person. Having hear of the HeLa cells from a college biology class, and now reading about Ms. Lacks life made me really appreciate her as a person who could easily have been a neighbor. And she suffered horrifically simply because of her skin color. What she gave to science is nothing short of miraculous and yet she and her family were treated like nothing more than notes on a piece of paper. It's saddening that the biologists and researchers involved didn't see her cells as anything other than bits in a petri dish. I'm so proud of Ms. Skloot for doing what so many failed to do; truly honor her, and give her life the meaning and place it deserves, and she has done so in a dignified and humane way. It would be truly wonderful if all of the companies who have profited from her life would finally recognize her by giving back a little too!

B002C512TY|4.0|First, I'm a parent (the mom) so the overall rating of 4 stars comes from my son who loves this thing. It has testosterone all over it; it's big, REALLY big and shoots darts quite a distance. According to my son, the darts go farther and with better accuracy (compared to what, I have no idea). The dog loves it too; with darts shooting all over the place, she goes nuts trying to catch them all. So they both seem to enjoy it. If you purchase this, get extra darts at the same time, it only comes with a measly 6 darts. I can't wait until he grows out of this phase ;-).
B001N1DPDE|5.0|After many hours of research this is the knife I chose to purchase. My thoughts all revolving around what would be the one tool I would want to have on me in a long term survival situation. (if I could only choose one) To be completely honest, I have no hunting experience and I am limited in my use with knives. I have always hiked, fished, camped and have alot of experience with tools in my careers. However, selecting a knife for hardcore survival needs has been a several month project for me. This is the result after picking the brain of every outdoorsman I came across, hitting every gun & knife shop in three states, reading every review I could find and watching every video my computer could download.    The main reasons I landed on the Becker Campanion is probably first and foremost the fact it is made by Ka-Bar. There are few manufacturers with this strong of a reputation, and if iit's good enough for our Marines, it's good enough for me. A very important feature in a fixed blade, especially of this size, is it must have a full tang. (that is the steel blade runs completely through the handle) This is essential for safety and durability. The model I ended up with has a tang that extends past the end of the handle to create a pomell that acts as a hammer. (some newer models do not add this feature) At a quarter inch thick, this blade is sturdy and heavy. I whacked through a sapling as thick as my forearm with little effort. It is not recommended to pry with your knife but I truly feel if an emergency dictated this need, I predict this blade could handle the job. I was tempted to go with the larger Bowie but after holding and using this knife I feel I made the right decision for me. I'm no Careem Abdul Jabar but would be considered to have a large hand and this knife fits nicely in my grip with perfect balance. I have slightly mixed emotions on the sheath. I love the body with the way the knife locks in and is easily removable with one hand. The material appears almost indestructable. It has drainholes with plenty of airspace around the blade to prevent rust and holes to lash to the leg. I'm not crazy about the nylon webbed belt loop. It's long and floppy. I would have preferred a leather loop attatchment for the belt. I have seen customizations made on both the handle and sheath on Youtube reviews that I found interesting. I think adding some simple stitching to tightin up the wide loop may help alot.    If Ka-Bar were to add a few features like those found on Gerber's Bear Gryll's Ultimate Survival Knife this model would be absolutely unstoppable. Overall, I am very satisfied with this addition to my \\"All Hell Breaks Loose Survival Pack.\\" If you are happy with the specifications, I assure you that you will be satisfied with the quality. I also feel this was not overpriced at sixty or so dollars at the time I made my purchase.
B003F3NEBG|5.0|Jane Austin will continue to be relevant as long  people enjoy experiencing a literate, intelligent author's perception of others, their behavior,feelings and motivations. While this particular BBC series was made in 1995, and there are numerous other versions of it,it in my opinion is the best having won multiple awards both in England and the USA. The cinematography is marvelous, as are the settings and costumes. It continues to be a source of amazement of how Jane Austen  continues to appeal to each new generation who learn about her. Her books rarely go out of print and the interest lives on.  No DVD collection in my opinion is complete without this version.
044656740X|1.0|That's what Robert Kiyosaki said back in 2003 when probed about  \\"financial advice\\" in his book.  The fact is that this book provides bunch of easy answers that don't stand the test of reason.   He insists the best way to make money is in real estate through some secret investment style, stocks through insider trading and by avoiding tax.   I am unsure how Robert made his money but if it is through any of the techniques he preaches, he could be on the wrong side of the law.   The unsophisticated and lazy folks may think this is great advice, but if it were so great, lets find out why Robert Kiyosaki has been involved in multi level marketing schemes companies and peddling his half-assed advice through seminars in various cities where he tries to sell his book.   My friends, the only way to build wealth is to do real research, learn basic algebra, rules to value companies and stock. Be prepared to take calculated (but well informed) risk. If you don't, people like Kiyosaki will take advantage of your laziness and ignorance.   Access to the web and free real time information on Google, MSN and Yahoo as well as great free information from Fool.com, Morningstar and WSJ can prepare you to be a better investor that Kiyosaki can ever hope to be.
B00003CXAA|5.0|Classic mafioso collection must have! Read the books and own the trilogy. Great stay in on a snowy cold day to watch the entire saga. Of course 1 and 2 are the BEST.  3 is not the favorite, but we all know that, right!?
B001PPLJIQ|3.0|I saw the movie only after I had read several reviews and heard so much about it. I found interesting, with great acting by the lead characters but was left with several questions....    1 Is the relationship between the 'kid' and Hanna one of sexual education or molestation? 15 years is young but not exactly a kid either...and he seems to come back to her because he clearly enjoys what goes on between them in bed. Teenagers engaging in sex is not anything new, and Kate Winslet does not look like his mom - she definitely looks elder to him but not that old. He is emotionally damaged...yeah sure..how many adult relationships leave people scarred and emotionally damaged for life? Lots of them...All said and done if it is meant to depict molestation it fails miserably, some advantage has been taken with age and depiction to titillate viewers.    2 Why does the 'kid' feel so much regard for her after he is grown up? He is portrayed as a kind and compassionate man who genuinely tries to understand the horrors of the holocaust..she on the other hand resists every effort to show any feelings around it...even in his last effort to rekindle her memories she only talks of what she gained (to read), and dismisses how she thinks and feels as 'does not matter since the dead are still dead' (perhaps should be 'does matter since so many died'?:)) She committed suicide..yeah perhaps with the realization that she is a misfit in the outside world now...and grossly ashamed of her affair..But why does he think she is so important? Perhaps because she engaged him in a way nobody else did - sexually, by reading to her, something?? Still makes the viewer feel something is missing...    3 Is it really possible for a woman to be illiterate and be a bus conductor and a nazi guard, even in those days? Both roles require minimal reading capabilites...she does punch tickets and am guessing the tickets had numbers or something printed on them ?:)), and lots of nazi guards had lists and various printed material to read. Somehow unconvincing...    Given all of that still Winslet and the male lead put on stellar performances. And the movie makes you think in all about the complexity of human relationships, and perhaps that was its main goal.
0786956291|3.0|This is a decent intro into 4E D&D.  It will take characters to the second level of experience.  The two books are rather short, being 32 and 64 pages long - including the back cover, and I would have preferred a little more depth.  This just covers the barest of the basics.  The presentation is simple and direct, and the art work is very good.  The game also comes with a nice looking double sided map, some cardboard tokens to represent players and monsters, dice, and cards representing players skills and items.  The cards are not of card stock quality, but are serviceable enough.        The game itself is VERY different from previous renditions of Dungeons and Dragons.  It is simpler, much more structured, and cleaner than previous editions.  This  reduces gray areas where the DM has to make difficult judgments, and reduces the chance for bickering between the DM and players.  However, much like a computer game, I couldn't help but feel constricted tactically.  On that note it is clear that Wizards borrowed heavily from computer games - particularly MMO's when designing this game.  Weather this is good or bad will depend on the players perspective.        First level characters start off with a litany of powers that make them feel much more powerful than first level characters in previous editions of D&D.  Mages and clerics have far fewer spells available, but many of those they have are usable repeatedly and at will.  Likewise tank and thief types also have an assortment of powers (Basically spells, just called something different) available right from the start.  This makes first level characters feel heroic right from the start, but what is lost is that delicious sense of danger and week ness that gave low level parties such character.  The rise to prominence and power from obscurity was all the more enjoyable.  Again, some players will love the change, and others will hate it.        All in all, this is a pretty entertaining, if simple, tactical combat game with RPG overtones.  If that is what you are looking for, I would recommend this unabashedly.  If you are looking for a Dungeons and Dragons experience similar to what you had in previous editions, I would stick with those.
B001MEJY8W|5.0|I'm not a horror guy, really. Just not my thing. But when a friend would not stop raving about Martyrs, I decided to give this new French stuff a try. I went in expecting psychological tension, nothing supernatural, and extreme graphic violence. Well, I got all that, and I got something else: a movie with a lot on its mind. There are spiritual questions raised here about the meaning and value of suffering. There are class issues flayed open in ways I didn't expect. And above it all, there is a running critique of American foreign policy, particularly as it relates to our \\"detainees.\\" What would it be like to be stripped of every right, for all time, and handed to people whose only job was to torment you? Martyrs gets into that space.<br /><br />This is one of the most uncompromising movies I've ever seen. Every frame dares you to watch it, and the only hint of catharsis is contained in a whisper you don't hear. If you are faint of heart, weak of stomach, or looking for an easily enjoyed piece of entertainment, stay far away from this film. But if you seek out art that moves you to think, art that moves you to rage, film that challenges you to think about what the limits of film really are, Martyrs does all that.
B000JML7EC|3.0|I have to admit, I was expecting a little bit more from this classic.  Although I did enjoy it, I think my expectations were too high.  I had recently read the free download of \\"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea\\", and it was outstanding.  So, perhaps reading them back to back was a little unfair to \\"Treasure\\".  Stevenson's style in this book just did not jive with me.
B003XMXZCW|5.0|In 2001 director Frances Ford Coppola re-released his other masterpiece (I'm not forgetting \\"The Godfather\\") adding about 50 minutes to the movie making it a tidy 3 hours and 22 minutes!  The extended version contains many changes in addition to the added scenes.  Here is a link that details the differences: [...] The primary ones for me are the extended cut of the \\"Playmates\\" visit including one where the boat stops during a rainstorm and a few members of the crew get to \\"visit\\". There is another lengthy scene when the crew stops at a plantation near the Cambodian border and meets a village of French nationals who have refused to leave even after the French were thrown out in the 1950's.  Capt. Willard hooks up with one of the daughters of the family patriarch.  There are other scenes as well.  Some like the French plantation meeting add some context but really isn't relevant overall to the story.  Others like the \\"Playmate\\" scene just seem to slow things down.  For the most part these and others add to the journey but aren't important to the overall message.  Either version will make a lifelong impact if you love movies and for me, ranks with the best ever.
0439023513|5.0|Just finished reading this book. I really liked the first two in the Hunger Games series and this is a great ending! It ended different than what io expected and thats what I really liked. I don't want to spoil anytng but if you liked The Hunger Games and Catching Fire, you should buy Mockingjay as well! You won't be disappointed!
B003L20ICO|4.0|I think what struck me the most about this excellent film is that even without the homosexual relationship between the parents and all the baggage that it might bring with it, this movie could have been made using a traditional father and mother.  As it is, the family is trying to deal with all the ups and downs any marriage might have.  The sperm donor Paul (Mark Ruffalo) could have been used for any family, although the idea of impregnating both mothers is an interesting twist.  The 5 primary actors are terrific, and I would expect some Oscar buzz for the movie in general and Annette Bening, specifically.  The movie is funny but has some heartfelt moments as well.  My only quibble is that I thought Ruffalo's character was treated rather poorly in the end.  It kind of felt like the director was sympathizing too much with him, so switched gears.  Jules (Julianne Moore) was equally guilty, if not more so, for the affair but she is let off the hook.  This is one case that called for a happy ending that is hinted at in the trailers.
0307165485|5.0|I have been using this book for over 35 years starting with my young children then as gifts to many of my family and friend's young children.  As a former school teacher I praise the benefit of reading and teaching young children as soon as they are able to sit up and focus which is around 5 or 6 months.  This wonderful book by Richard Scarry is chock full of learning on the very basics little ones need to know and help them prepare for preschool.  The colorful illustrations and characters are delightful and fun for parent and child.  \\"Best Storybook\\" is an all around best learning tool, can't recommend it enough.  In fact there are several wonderful Richard Scarry books that should be in your young child's library. Now almost 40 years later my children and I laugh about some of his characters and the pleasure we got from his books.  In fact I still have those original copies. It's a great present for that new baby, it will be only a matter of a few months that he/she will enjoy it sitting along the parent. Happy reading and learning.
B0049OSQ18|5.0|Best CD I have bought in the past year. Lyrics are great, sound is fresh. Unless you are stuck in a certain type of music genre, you will find that this CD will grow on you.
B002L5GQGY|5.0|I have been quite content the past 15 years or so with my classical and occasionally the old rockers. During yet another insufferable PBS pledge drive, I stumbled on Joe Bonamassa and I could not believe what I was hearing. Here was someone completely original - with the kind of talent and confidence the great old bands used to have. Here is a true artist with an artistry obtained through years of hard work. The DVD is quite well done and I simply cannot recommend it enough.
B0002EXH5O|2.0|I've listened to this album hundreds of times over the past 20 years and was one of my favorites in high school and still to this day and I grew to know the \\"sound\\" of this album because of it.  Being a drummer I always listen to the sound of the drums (especially the snare) on any album and appreciate when they sound raw and real like on the original version of Rust In Peace.  This new \\"remastered\\" version completely changes the sound of the drums.  I was expecting just better sonics (and hopefully better bass), but instead got a revisionist version of the original.  NOT cool.  If you don't care about such a thing then maybe you can stomach this, but it makes it unlistenable to me.  The new version does have a substantial bass boost, which is normally something I am highly in favor of, but the drum sound is too much to overlook.  I'm just glad I only bought this album's remastered version and none of the others.   Bottom line: \\"remastered\\" doesn't necessarily mean \\"better\\".
B000002MTU|3.0|Sadly, I never get the sense that Clapton is really feeling the blues here. His guitar playing is fine, but the singing is lackluster. Maybe it's because he's had a comfortable wealthy lifestyle for the last few decades, or maybe it's because he was just uninspired during the recording process. You'll get what I mean if you compare Clapton's rendition of \\"Hoochie Coochie Man\\" with the Muddy Waters version. When Clapton sings the opening lines, \\"Gypsy woman told my mother/before I was born/you got a boy child comin'/he gonna be a son of a gun\\", he doesn't sound even remotely believable. Muddy Waters sings that as though it's HIS life (and Muddy didn't even write the song). Yeah, it's tough being compared to the best blues singer ever in the business, but that's what happens when a big time rock star puts out a whole album of blues tunes.<br /><br />I fully anticipate that Clapton fans will poo-poo my review because they don't like my opinion. I am a Clapton fan myself, just not a fan of this album.
030745455X|4.0|Just like the previous book, the plot is focused more on the motivations behind the murders than on the murder part. Just like the previous book, interesting things happen, but they are all packed in the last hundred or so pages. Again Lisbeth Salander is freaking fantastic and Michael Blomkvist is mediocre. If you liked the first book for these reasons, you'll like this book. If you liked Salander more than Blomkvist, you'll like this book even more!
B00005JLEX|4.0|Got this because I am home recuperating from cancer chemotheraph treatments and needed something to make me laugh-- just change my body chemistry.  This was a good choice.  Would have been better as a rental/return get more than a purchase.
B002ODEJYE|5.0|What can I say that has not been said here. This concert is awesome. Excellent production and Pink sings live, there is not lip sync here. This blu ray is a must.
B004EBT5CU|3.0|i like adele's voice and i think she has a cool vibe going on, i just hope this isn't gimmicky because a retro 60's thang has been going on the past several years with british female acts trying to bring back a 60's motown thang and other styles, which is cool to a certain point, but then it feels gimmicky on a another level. adele is a cool artist and i look to when she starts to sound more modern and if she is able to balance the time periods. this is a cool album.i like her voice though overall more than the songs and i'm looking toward where she is in time.
0452287022|4.0|This book was a well-written insight into Medieval Netherlands and into the mind and genius of one of the all-time great art masters, Vermeer.      But it was more than that: it was a peek into the ambient world recorded in his paintings. The beauty, order, and perspectives of his paintings, however, were much more fanciful than the hard reality of that world.    I've always been impressed by how tiny the people seem in Medieval paintings. I'm sure the level of nutrition and medicine contributed to this. But after reading this book, I'm impressed how small so many of the people were in character. The so-called upper-class was automatically right in whatever they said or did, solely on the basis of who they were. The lower-class were subjected to systematic, small-time insulting daily, like having to stand in the presence of their masters, not speaking unless spoken to, being spoken about instead of spoken to, etc, etc. The children of the wealthy learned from their parents - one of the children in this story was like a Rosemary's Baby! Vermeer was a little better than some others in this story, but not great; when push came to shove, he abandoned the falsely accused maid, who was the subject of one of his most famous paintings, the focus of this book. It's too bad that the other characters in this book did not rise to something close to that level.    This book reminded me of `The Lost Quilt', `Uncle Tom's Cabin', and the PBS series, `Downton Abbey.'  In all these stories, there was a sharp class separation between the haves and the have-nots.  The haves seemed to get spiritually smaller by their pettiness, vanity, judgementalism, and I-am-always-right attitudes. These attitudes seemed to migrate to their subordinates who also were well-aware of where they stood in their `sub' society. The best character in all these stories, by the way, I think was Uncle Tom. Contrary to the negative epithet associated with his name, he was actually a picture of a suffering Christin the most treacherous of circumstances, and admirable in every way! His greatness of character drove that story.    It reminds me of a biblical command that is maybe the hardest to live up to: `Judge not lest you be judged.' I remind myself daily that we simply don't have enough information to judge others. I don't think the people in this book understood this at all! That's what made them so small!
0670022411|5.0|slow to start, mostly because of character development (in the first 100 pages), the novel really took off in the middle and ended with a blast! Can't wait for the sequel
0307454541|3.0|Ho boy. I don't think it's possible to talk about this book without mentioning violence against women. Seriously, every aspect of this book is steeped in it. Rape, child abuse, domestic violence and sexual harassment affect every character in this book. It was a real downer.<br /><br />If you're looking for light, relaxing entertainment, I would advise looking elsewhere, no matter what sort of hype you've heard about it. I found the violence difficult to slog through to get to a vanilla murder mystery. However, if you like gritty novels or the like, go right ahead. I might read the second book in the series, if only to see Salander kick in a few more heads!
0385341008|5.0|The saddest thing about this book is that the author is now deceased and will not be writing any more books. The concept is very good. I love the way she develops all of the characters. They become so real that you feel as if you know them all!
0982743726|5.0|Wonderful piece of fantasy in world that was different, but not so different from our own, about a guy not so different than anyone of us might be given his world and his circumstance.  The Hero's name is Malik, and he is a killer.<br /><br />The story begins with Malik's flight from justice. Then gradually things get worse and he is forced to save two children in order to save himself.  The inherent moral conflict of his plight insues as the character's perceptions blur into a picture of humanity and heroism that make \\"The Bone Sword\\" what it is, a really good story.<br /><br />One of the things I like best about it is how the Walter weaves the readers perception of the world around them. It starts out very, very small. Which to be honest, is how it should be in an age without cell phones and email and when social networking took place on the back of a mule. By the end, you hold a greater but still limited sense of the perils of the world around them.<br /><br />As a reader, I was left wanting to know more, mostly about the world around the land of Miscony, where the story takes place. This is both good and bad. Walter, I do hope you plan on a sequel, because I have been left wanting more.
B002ZG976U|5.0|I am not sure why this movie got so many bad reviews from the critics.  The storyline is sweet, the actors/actresses do an excellent job, Cher and Christina were amazing, and the routines were fabulous.  A must have for your DVD collection.
B0033H7VI6|4.0|Love this knife, tested it in the outdoors and stood up to the challenge, very good survival knife. Love the sheath and the extra pouch they have in the front so you can throw a multi tool or fire starter in it etc. It also is removable if you dont want it. fits perfect right on my belt. Thick knife so it will not break! But just be careful to not store it wet. Because it will rust. Coming from a knife enthusiast I Highly recommend!
B001V7UXG2|5.0|I'd read a lot of the stories growing up, and had seen quite a few episodes on PBS, so this seemed like a good choice to watch while recovering from surgery.  I really can't say anything others haven't said earlier (and better!) so I'll stick with saying that this boxed set made a wrenching time in my life a little more bearable.<br /><br />I have only two caveats:<br /><br />1) laughing that hard while recovering from surgery can be surprisingly painful.<br /><br />2) watching the whole series in a long marathon can be a little confusing; many important characters are played one season by one actor, and the next by a completely different actor.  This probably wouldn't be as jarring if you weren't watching it all at once.  Or maybe that was just the pain meds...
030726999X|4.0|So many awesome women! I'll miss reading books where roughly half of the characters are female and none of them are damsels in distress. On the other hand, I am okay reading less about violence against women, which is why the first book in this series was so rough on me. Luckily I was still interested after finishing \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" and the trilogy got better and better for me. I know the sheer about of detail is annoying for a lot of people, but it never bothered me that much, and it even works in Larsson's favor in this book, because there is a lot of information about Zalachenko that I wanted to know. I had a lot of empathy for many of his characters, even Blomkvist. \\"The Girl who Kicked the Hornet's Nest\\" was definitively my favorite of the Millenium series, and I'm a little sad that I've finished them all.
B003C5FMEE|5.0|I really like this one.  For New Orleans style jazz, this one kicks butt.  It a funky, up-beat, hip-hop like version of a Dr. John, Dirty Dozen Brass Band album.  This one had my feet and my hands tapping all the way through!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Sure, like most young boys, my \\" TV entertainment\\" came from the SUPER-FRIENDS (and spin-offs), SPIDER-MAN, SHAZAM, JOHNNY SOCKO, and ULTRAMAN!<br />BTW, if you liked ULTRAMAN then, check out some of the more recent stuff...it's wicked...the recent ULTRAMAN MEBUIS movies are amazing!<br /><br />It was 1977...I was 8 years old...my Mom took me and my 2 younger bros to the Woodhaven Mall (in NE Philly) to see a movie that would change my life!<br />Funny thing, the movie did one of those rip/melt things during the OBI-WAN TURNS OFF THE TRACTOR BEAM scene...very funny!  EVERYTHING CHANGED!  That next Christmas, my Mom got me THE STORY OF STAR WARS record.  I listened to that thing endlessly...thus memorizing the entire thing (including narration).<br /><br />Look, like many, I am absolutely thrilled and have already placed my pre-order, etc.<br /><br />I'm not going to get into the ORIG VS SE arguement...I have both versions and I'm fine with that.  Nevertheless, all I'll say about it is this.....George made mention, more than once, that certain effects, etc, were NEVER the way he wanted them.  So, if given the chance to \\"go back\\" and \\"fix\\" things, why wouldn't he?!?  Bands/recording artists don't release their \\"demos\\" and go \\"HERE YA GO!\\"  In fact, we're thrilled if we finally get to hear the demos (of our fave songs) somewhere down the line anyway.  Now, growing up with the originals of the SW movie, I naturally love them.....but, I have no problem with a worm guy sticking out of the Sarlacc Pit...LOL!!!<br /><br />My \\"problem\\" is this...OVER 30 HOURS OF EXTRAS?!?  How much has George held back?  How much is he holding back?  How many sets do I have to buy to get EVERYTHING?!?  LOL!!!  I have \\"boot transfers\\" of the laserdiscs.  Those things had a LOT of extras...very cool!  I'm not angry...it's just that I'd love to have/see all the stuff that seems to come, without question, on today's BLU RAY releases of far less worthy movies, etc.<br /><br />I can't wait!  AND, now that I have a 6 year old son, I get to share my joy and excitement and relive it at the same time.to share my joy and excitement and relive it at the same time.
020161622X|5.0|The Pragmatic Programmer is not going to blow your mind the way inching through a book on machine learning or functional programming. But it will give you insight into how to be a better developer at the job you're in. Some of the information/advice is a bit dated - almost everyone uses version control, which the book argues passionately in favor of. At present, should you find a company which doesn't use version control, DO NOT WORK THERE. That said, it is interesting to see what wasn't considered matter-of-fact for development jobs when the book was written. However, most of the material is timeless in the way a book on design patterns is timeless. DRY (Do not Repeat Yourself) and orthogonal code will likely never go out of style, for instance, nor will the power of code generation. And though I say the book is for 'your first development job,' it's probably worth reading even if you're a bit further along in your career (especially given the propensity for switching jobs in this industry). The principles elaborated in this book will help you do your job. And unlike some developer books, Pragmatic Programmer is easy to read and not prone to fluff or rambling. The exercises in the book (with answers in the back) provide ways to illustrate the principles espoused by the text, which is also helpful.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|First I chose this book because I have read many series lately, and wanted something different.  I wanted something with a \\"The End\\".  I started recommending this to friends because it was so well written, and the knowledge in it was impeccable.  Let me say it since most of these reviews don't mention it. THERE IS NO ENDING.  If the author plans on writing another book to go with this I will be awaiting its arrival, however if not then this will be considered one of the worst story lines I have ever read.*  I couldn't put this down most of the time, and enjoyed all the history and science mixed in, but there really wasn't much happening through out.  I kept reading because I couldn't wait for \\"the exciting part\\" to happen...well it never did.  I loved all the wine talk in the book, but it did make me rather thirsty.  I must finish this with saying not every Fiction/Fantasy novel must be compared to Twilight.    * I am editing this review after speaking with the author, and there will be 2 more books to follow.  I am thankful I will have some closure :)
B001UV4XFG|5.0|Movie was bought for my daughter she loves it. She has all the movies in the series. She would recommend this movie to anyone who loves the books.
B002ZG99TA|5.0|This was an excellent UP-TO-DATE MODERN RAILROADING MOVIE, that was very entertaining and had some excellent  railroad learning information in it, especially in the TRAILERS.  If you like DENZEL and you like ACTION, this  is a movie for you !!   If you like seeing trains and all the action surrounding this particular train, well this  is the movie to see.  I have watched it for five settings now.
B000B5UL7G|4.0|A good departure from the techno side of his music, Robbie Williams is still in top form. Lyrically clever, musically diverse but more acoustic than previously, and a nice mix of slow and upbeat songs. I recommend this go round with a different producer to any Robbie Williams fan, and I'm an American! Just saying that to show he's got fans around the world.
0440246016|2.0|Having enjoyed other Reacher novels, I can only say were this a debut novel I could deal with it. I struggled to complete the book- a one day read for most- struggled in a way that I'd call hungry- for detail, for support, for the fleshing out of characters, some depth into the acquisition of intel. I don't have to give you a synopsis; there are plenty of those available to you. My disappointment lay in the style- or lack thereof- in \\"Bad Luck & Trouble.\\" Even the dialogue was lame, surface, shallow. I can actually imagine a school student writing this- because of the over-simplistic style. There was absolutely nothing to bite into here and Lee Child can do better than this. Far better. On the other hand- if you are looking for a simply written novel the content of which can be scanned like Cliff Notes -allowing you to envision an hour of action TV, then maybe this one is for you.
B003JJ8LD2|5.0|Enjoyable book.  Entertaining (lots of laughs) and Educational (lots of facts).  A good case study.  One can conclude the government should not have bailed out anybody.
B003MC5N28|5.0|i remember reading this book in 7th grade and loving it - 13 years later, i feel the same. excellent, easy, entertaining, and thought provoking - i hope they continue to make this mandatory reading in schools for generations to come.
1416550550|5.0|This book was recommended to me by and avid reader friend of mine. This is easily one of the best books I have ever read. Janet
B0001Z37HM|5.0|Cheesy fantasy action doesn't get any better than this! As a child, my family rented movies from the library, so this was in our house pretty much every other week as we turned it in and then picked it up the next week.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|For history buffs, this is a great series with lots of factual occurrences; others are dramatized of course.  I would highly recommend this series to anyone interested in all ages of history.
B000001EMW|4.0|Released in 1996 by Finnish loons Apocalyptica.... Oh who am I kidding? Basically anybody reading this review has already heard this yeah?<br /><br />So my two cents worth in relation to four blokes grabbing cellos, reworking a bunch of Metallica classics and rendering them with verve and passion is that it is a great album to throw on as a diversion. Sincerely, listening to something left field like this is the sort of album that is not only fun but probably also very cathartic given it's very difference from much of the other music probably loitering the musical collections of Metallica fans. With four of them to pound away the lads in Apocalyptica have the option of really trying to grapple with the different parts of the song. While I don't feel that they've nailed every one of the songs they've attempted is beside the point to a degree, the mere quality of the attempt is beguiling and - as I said earlier - diverting.<br /><br />Production values are as crisp as you'd expect, there is little clutter sonically and that is actually good for the listener, allowing them to zero in on what is going on. The package could perhaps have been a candidate for a fuller booklet but that is a minor quibble.<br /><br />The fact that there is a market amongst heavy music fans for Apocalyptica shows the genre has more brains and tolerance than given credit for. And this album - while not equating to sparkling brilliance - is a very worthwhile release to pick up for any heavy music fan with at least a cursory knowledge of the works of Metallica.
B004G5ZXVQ|4.0|In 1987, at age 14, I became exposed to R.E.M. for the first time when they released their fifth album, \\"Document\\", and the first single from that album, \\"The One I Love\\". MTV played \\"The One I Love\\" video endlessly it seemed. I hated R.E.M.<br /><br />\\"It's The End Of The World As We Know It (And I Feel Fine)\\" was released several months later, and my opinion shifted slightly.<br /><br />\\"Green\\" was released in 1988, and in early 1989, \\"Stand\\" was released and I was annoyed by R.E.M. I worked at a music store that summer, and \\"Pop Song 89\\" was up next, but this time I got to hear the entire album in the store numerous times, and my attitude improved even more.<br /><br />I was primed for 1991's \\"Out Of Time\\" and \\"Losing My Religion\\". I still wasn't sold.<br /><br />It would be 1992's \\"Automatic For The People\\" that finally won me over with \\"Drive\\" and \\"Man On The Moon\\". I bought it and thought it was great. I skipped 1994's \\"Monster\\", but in 1996 with \\"New Adventures In Hi-Fi\\" and \\"E-Bow The Letter\\" I finally bought everything R.E.M.<br /><br />And so now here I am, 2011, one of the last surviving fans of R.E.M. and real music. Caring about a band that many would argue no longer matters. How did I get here? Would I like yet another album by R.E.M.?<br /><br />Yes. In fact, \\"Collapse Into Now\\", after listening to it all week long, has grown on me like the kudzu on the cover of their first album, \\"Murmur\\". Elements from \\"Reckoning\\", \\"Lifes Rich Pageant\\", \\"Out Of Time\\", \\"Automatic For The People\\", \\"Monster\\", \\"Reveal\\" and \\"Accelerate\\" are put in a blender to make an R.E.M. smoothie. It feels great, really. While \\"Accelerate\\" found the band revitalized with a new producer, Jacknife Lee, behind the controls, it didn't have the feel and variety of \\"Collapse Into Now\\". As I listened, I actually felt myself caring about the songs, letting the melodies wash over me.<br /><br />Now, \\"Collapse Into Now\\" does not show R.E.M. in a new light, but what it does do is play to the band's strengths. Sure, \\"Uberlin\\" sounds like a sped up \\"Drive\\" and my favorite track, \\"Oh My Heart\\" sound like something from \\"Out Of Time\\", but the band shakes things up with the rocking \\"Discoverer\\", \\"All The Best\\", \\"Mine Smells Like Honey\\", \\"Alligator_Animator_Autopilot_Antimatter\\", and they even add some balladry like \\"Every Day Is Yours To Win\\", \\"Walk It Back\\" and \\"Blue\\". I think the only song I am not really liking is \\"That Someone Is You\\".<br /><br />Still, \\"Collapse Into Now\\" is one of R.E.M.'s finest, most cohesive works, in years. It's true. I listened to all of R.E.M.'s albums in sequential order leading up to \\"Collapse Into Now\\". I'd say that this album is the band's best work since 1998's \\"Up\\" (and I know many R.E.M. fans didn't like THAT album, but I did).<br /><br />So, with \\"Collapse Into Now\\", R.E.M. become like U2, David Byrne, The Human League, Duran Duran, Howard Jones, Annie Lennox, The Cars, OMD, Patti Smith, and many other classic artists/bands that have been around 30+ years and still carry on long past what popular culture dictates. I don't really care if R.E.M.'s music or videos no longer receive constant attention. Remember how they began in 1983? No one knew them, not really until 1987, not until their fifth album. Nowadays you're dead in the water if you don't have a hit or keep up the hit making machine every album by your fifth album, if you actually get a chance to make five albums today. If people want to clog their ears with American Idol, Glee, and auto-tune, by all means, help yourself. I'm sticking with R.E.M.<br /><br />Here's how \\"Collapse Into Now\\" compares to R.E.M.'s other works:<br /><br />1983 Murmur: Four and a Half Stars<br />1984 Reckoning: Four Stars<br />1985 Fables Of The Reconstruction: Three and a Half Stars<br />1986 Lifes Rich Pageant: Four Stars<br />1987 Document: Four Stars<br />1988 Green: Four Stars<br />1991 Out Of Time: Four and a Half Stars<br />1992 Automatic For The People: Five Stars<br />1994 Monster:Four and a Half Stars<br />1996 New Adventures In Hi-Fi: Three and a Half Stars<br />1998 Up: Four and a Half Stars<br />2001 Reveal: Three Stars<br />2004 Around The Sun: Three and a Half Stars<br />2008 Accelerate: Three and a Half Stars<br />2011 Collapse Into Now: Four Stars: Three Stars  2004 Around The Sun: Three and a Half Stars  2008 Accelerate: Three and a Half Stars  2011 Collapse Into Now: Four Stars
B000FA5QEK|4.0|Prior to reading this book, I'd heard mixed reviews.<br />I'd heard nothing but praise from the media, and financial \\"experts\\", and then received mediocre feedback from acquaintances who'd read it.<br />I tried to go into it with an open mind, and this is what I came out with:<br /><br />- Assets are something that put money into your pocket, while liabilities take money out of your pocket.<br />- Buy real estate<br />- Use corporations to your tax advantage<br />- Most of all, \\"This is only a game. Sometimes you win and sometimes you learn.\\"<br /><br />I thought the author did a tremendous job of outlining what he has done to experience success, and hammering home the importance of learning, and of thinking outside the box.<br /><br />All in all, I thought it was a great book.<br />Obviously, I learned more than the four points I listed above, but those were the things that I'd have to say impacted me most.<br /><br />At the end of the day, I'd suggest this book.
0670022411|3.0|Look at the star review chart above and see how there are marks in every field, 5 stars to 1. After reading \\"A Discovery of Witches\\" I comprehend perfectly. The story begins fairly well, introducing the reader to Diana, a witch who is reluctant to use her powers.  She is caught \\"fudging\\" a bit by the oh-so-handsome and mysterious Matthew (a vampire). He needs to get his hands on an old book and Diana is the only one who can \\"call\\" it. I liked the descriptions of Oxford and its environs, especially the beautiful college library. Harkness can really place the reader in the library stacks or crumbling castle. Where the author faltered was in developing the characters, specifically Matthew. We are TOLD a lot about him: he is secretive, he is dangerous, he is brilliant. But we don't experience any of these characteristics as readers. And yes, as many other reviewers have mentioned, this is Twilight for the older set. The length of the book also leaves a bit to be desired. Harkness need not impress us with her extensive knowledge of obscure alchemists from the 15th century...she had us at the front desk.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Not your typical Sci-Fi reader, I downloaded a sample of this novel and was immediately hooked by the concept of monitors and government and the life of the main character, so much so that I decided to buy the book and keep reading. As I moved through the story, I became more and more fascinated by the year it was written and the extraordinary vision it took to write a book that, years later, we can easily relate to with modern technology.     In review, my favorite line from the book is this:    \\"Perhaps it's impossible to wear an identity without becoming what you pretend to be...\\"    So many other powerful thoughts run through this story, but I won't take up more time to deal with that.    I thought the descriptions were written clearly and easy to visualize. The dialogue was true to character, coming across as children behave, which was interesting given the intellect of these genius kids. At many times, I felt connected to Ender and wished something bad would happen to those who took him from his home. Finally, the prose used was easy enough that even a non-SciFi reader like me was able to follow it, which in my opinion shows the mark of a good writer--that he can broaden his audience without losing his base.    A good read.
0061353248|3.0|If I could give this book 3.5 stars, I would.  I've listened to Dan Ariely many times on podcasts and seen him on youtube.  He's an extremely engaging speaker and the experiments he describes are often quite surprising and thought-provoking.  The book consists of loosely-tied chapters, each of which makes a point and illustrates it with experiments.  I found particularly interesting the chapters about social vs economic customs and about how we respond to the word 'free'.   But the structure of the book made it a little tiring for me.  For one thing, there's nothing tying the chapters together.  It seemed like the size of the book was simply a function of the number of experiments performed and the need to fill a certain number of pages.  Also, I found the book to be very front-loaded.  After the first half, the experiments became more obvious and their descriptions were given less-and-less time.  In place of talking about the structure and outcome of the experiments like he did at the beginning, I felt that more-and-more time was spent on surface-level analysis.  The book is definitely worth a look if you're unfamilar with Professor Ariely's work.  But I think I would have gotten just as much out of a book half this one's size.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|i could not put it down i love it so much that i red the the book 19 times im not joking
1400049628|5.0|my friend and I love zombie movies and joke about making plans for a zombie apocalypse in 2012.  he got this on his iphone but it was cheaper here so i ordered it.  it is a fun book to read and also as informative as you can be on this topic.  great book.  great price.  great review.
0395775590|5.0|I am enrolled in Pre-Colonial African History at UA Fort Smith, and my professor higly recommended this book for further study.  I read it mostly for my research project about traditional Igbo society.  I found the book to be very informative about traditional African culture.  I could have done without the \\"other related readings\\" included with the book Things Fall Apart, but darn it all if I didn't learn something from those works as well, so it can't be too much of a complaint.  I would highly recommend this book for any serious student of African culture.  Whether your major is history, sociology, anthropology, or other related academic fields, books like this one can prove to be valuable educational resources.
B004BSFSTA|4.0|I recently received these headphones and upon opening them I was immediately impressed by the build quality.  They felt very sturdy and upon close inspection I am confident they will last long under normal conditions/use.  I was also happy in relation to the size of the product; it was very difficult for me to gauge the size of the headphones from the photos.  The actual ear cups are a nice size - not too big/bulky and not too small where they would be uncomfortable.  I was afraid the plug would be large and be awkward, but it turned out to be the perfect size for plugging into my iPhone.  The cord is also a great size and the coil design keeps it under control (this was nice when I used them on the airplane).    In terms of the sound, it is great.  I am no audiophile, but I can tell the difference between cheap sound products and quality sound products.  I can't say how these compare to high end audio, but I thought they sounded great.  I listen to mostly Rock music (classic, alternative, indie) and these sounded great.  I however don't know how well these would work for hip hop or other music with lots of bass.    I only have one knock on these headphones, although it is really not in relation to a feature the headphones are designed for.  The one knock is that these are not the best for the airplane as they don't have noise canceling, so they don't block out the engine noise very well.  To be fair though, these are not designed to be noise-canceling, nor are they marketed to support that feature.  They are not any worse than other non noise-canceling headphones I have used.     Overall I really like these headphones.  They sound great, remained comfortable for a 3+ hour plane ride and are very stylish too.
B004SSCWYC|1.0|sets up a lot of future story that will probably be entertaining but olive as William bell is a hard sell with horrible voice. I wish i would of neglected to watch this episode and hope that they separate William and olive next week don't know how much of that my love for this show can endure.
0307236722|4.0|i have no regret in purchasing this book, full of tips and tricks,methods used,must-have baking tools,decorating techniques and basic recipes. importantly, each recipe is accompanied by beautiful and clear picture.the sections were nicely divided into type of baking categories.
0783225547|5.0|Great movie filled with lots of suspense and action. Linda Hamilton and Pierce Brosnan bring you through the movie well with a great story line for acting. Keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout. A movie you wish did not have to end!
B001RCD2DW|5.0|These are great headphones; others have articulated that better than I'm able, but I wanted to leave a review to praise AKG/Harman's customer service.     I bought a pair of AKG K702's second hand and they worked great for a few months, but then developed a buzzing in the left earpiece, much to my disappointment. I contacted the guy that sold them to me, and got his original receipt, and contacted AKG for a replacement. After talking to their support tech, who referred me to their repair manager (all of whom are actual people with actual names) with whom I left a voicemail. He promptly returned my call, listened to my problem and my testing steps, and recommended I send the headphones in for repair. Absolutely no hassle.    Upon sending the headphones to AKG, I received a call from their repair tech who was actually repairing my headphones, to verify that I hadn't sent my cable to them, and to go over the repairs he'd performed as well as verify the warranty (which I'd forgotten to send along). Two days later I received the repaired headphones.    I wish I could receive such good, careful, and personal service from every company. I realize this is a specialty product with a smaller user base, but I've bought many other products that would fit into that category, and have never had such good customer service. Thank you!
0061726826|4.0|All I can say is wow. So I was taken through a winding labyrinth of expecting to know what is going to happen, and BAM another twist. Most of the twists were subtle and you didn't realize the significance until later. But I didn't predict ANYTHING!! It was fantastic.<br /><br />I think I would have liked it better if I could connect with the characters more, but I didn't as much as I wanted. My favorite character was Gracie. Too bad she didn't play a bigger role. But I liked Alex too.<br /><br />I loved how the author made careful note of colors in the book. The color of Alex's hair is autumn. His eyes sparkle gold. Her favorite color is gray. I love how the symbolism of color in this book played such a big role. That and I loved the random attention to detail that is brought to our attention.<br /><br />The story was pretty fast paced in that it always changed. There wasn't action per say, but more like maturation happened and then some action. A little rebellion here, breaking a law there. Plus, I loved how the author took famous stories of love, like the Bible and Romeo and Juliet and turned it to fit her world. That and the odd pieces of \\"history\\" and nursery rhymes that she created. It was well made, like stepping into a world. Not all authors accomplish that.<br /><br />One of the best dystopian fantasies of the year, I'll bet! A lot like the Hunger Games and Matched put together. Great read! Plus the cover is pretty awesome too!<br /><br />Just as a side note, this isn't a romance book really. Sure there's romance, but it's fleeting and a little... background to me. The fact that they were sneaking around was more important to the book than the actual romance. It was just sorta so-so, but sweet regardless.
B003NFM3JK|5.0|Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol is one of my all-time favorite books, and this is one of my all-time favorite movies. It is not only an incredibly faithful adaptation (all of Dickens' best dialogue and descriptions make it in), but it stands alone as its own piece of art--frightening, beautiful, funny, and perfectly heartwarming. I don't see young children loving this film, but I absolutely adore it.
B000PDYVVG|2.0|I don't normally write reviews but this book drove me to it.  I forced my way about half way through the book before realizing it wasn't going to get any better.  The character is a weak, self-absorbed person waiting for the whole world to make her life  better.  She apparently never learned to be responsible for her own happiness and to try and do it without harming others in the process.  I deeply regret spending money to buy this tripe.
0060899220|5.0|If you're a \\"foodie\\", I have \\"no reservations\\" about recommending this book.Anthony Bourdain is probably a much better writer than chef.The book is funny and profane, a colorful behind the scenes look into the restaurant business, at least as it existed at the time in New York City.The book's success may also have contributed to the cult of the celebrity chef, an unfortunate consequence.In any event, it's an enjoyable and fascinating read.
0879309210|4.0|Really great book, but I have to say that it would be good to see a picture of the tools taking the measurement's. Like for example \\"Here is a picture of the feeler gauge, etc. Now that's not to say that it isn't shown for radius gauges with the DVD and other things but without that some of it may be lost in translation and you may leave feeling well..ok I am still not getting the entire picture.    Outside of that- I am loving it.
B003H3IOLE|5.0|Iv read this book soo many times and recomended it to alot of people! so poerful. would love to read her next book that is apparntly the sequal. Something like Birds sing In The Morrning. not sure what its called
0316069485|1.0|Very, very disappointed. Started out slow and convoluted. The style of writing, switching back and forth between 1st and 2nd person was distracting.    But my main problem with the book is the defense's position of trying to blame the stepfather for the murder of the little girl. This made NO SENSE as the stepfather was AT HOME with his family when the sister runs into the house to say her little sister has been taken. He had been there all afternoon drinking beer and watching t.v. so when did he have time to kill her and dump her in the trash bin? Unbelievably, this was never disputed by the prosecution!!    Secondly, when they are trying to describe how the killer had to be right handed because of the thumb and finger marks on the little girl's neck....huh? I had to read that passage 5 or 6 times, plus try to physically mimic what Connelly was describing. \\"There was a right thumb print on the right side of her neck. Finger marks were on the left side.\\" And he's driving the car with the girl sitting beside him? Makes no sense.     At these two plot points, I lost interest and Connelly lost credibility. I have enjoyed ALL of his other books. This felt rushed and not well thought out. Shame, shame.
