B0059XTU1S|5.0|Don't Listen to the CRITICS!!! I was extremely happy I went to watch this movie. I even watched it twice. The development of the story was fantastic. Peter did a great job of making everyone in the cast relatable even all the dwarfs. When the adventure began it was action packed until the end. Some things stand out like the make over of Orcs and giving intelligence to Cave Trolls. The 3 hrs went by quickly could have watch an additions 3 hrs. Peter Jackson has out done himself and gave me a movie to look forward to.  2012 had a lot of bad movies, this is a Light in a dark place. I can't wait to put this on preorder. I Loved TLOTR, but I must say I love this movie MORE
B000SW4DXK|5.0|This movie arrived early and was in perfect condition. It was purchased as a Christmas present and was quick and easy to order
B001BVRNPW|4.0|While This movie is good, and wraps up the final arc of the tv show, this was originally going to be the plot of the 11th season.
B001PO53IO|5.0|I gave this a perfect rating because the season was described as being brand new. It arrived brand new in the plastic wrap and it arrived early which was a nice bonus.
B0036TGSIK|4.0|This movie was probably the funniest to come out that year. Emma Stone was fantastic and the supporting cast was solid.
B0053O89IS|5.0|This was an amazing deal. I got this brand new season for a great price. It arrived in the exact condition as described and came early
B00402FGEE|4.0|While SGU had its share of detractors, this show did get better over time. The second half of the first season is when it really kicks off.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|This was an amazing deal. I got this brand new season for a great price. It arrived in the exact condition as described and came early
B00138J234|5.0|A great classic album of the late 70's. Showcasing the early Brit punk rock days. Remember rocking out to this album in the early 80's.
B0053O89WY|5.0|This was an amazing deal. I got this brand new season for a great price. It arrived in the exact condition as described and came early
B003L77FYS|5.0|I just love the Castle series it is a light hearted well written series of crime and passion.I really enjoyed the story line and the acting was excellent , especially Stana Katic . If you are looking for good entertainment then this is for you.
B0053O89JM|5.0|This was an amazing deal. I got this brand new season for a great price. It arrived in the exact condition as described and came early
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Compelling reading.  Great story teller.  I had a hard time putting this book down.I had to find out what happened next!!!!
B005S9EK1S|5.0|Good book.<br />Good movie.<br />Enjoyable with friends.<br />Story is believable.<br />Invite your friends to see it for popcorn night.<br />Go
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book had  so many twists and turns to it.  Was  a great read....could never see the next twist coming!!!! will read more by this author....  it was a fun read!!!!
B0019FOC5E|5.0|Nicholas Sparks never disappoints.<br />He is a great writer.<br />I will go to every film and read every book.<br />He is the best.
B001NLKXK2|3.0|this book left me wanting more.  It seemed incomplete.  I thought the it could have been more developed in some of the scenerios.
B006JD48NM|5.0|Amazing story of a man who was so much more than a car driver. At his peak, he was the heart and soul of a nation.
B008GFI418|5.0|Such a well done documentary.  We are blessed to have Sir George Martin still with us and to be able to hear from him in his own words.  If you were captivated by the sound of the Beatles, you'll only end up a bigger fan after watching this film. Much like the Film &#34;The Language Of Music&#34;, the documentary about Producer Tom Dow (sort of the US version of George Martin) that also had the luxury of featuring and hearing from the person who is the subject of the film, Produced By George Martin gives you insight into someone working in the infancy of an industry, pushing the limits of the hardware and equipment they had to work with while working with artists that would make indelible marks with their music and talent.  If you are a music fan, hearing about the &#34;Producer&#34;, the person behind the curtain supervising the recording sessions, provides a tremendous, additional insight into the creative process that resulted in great recorded music.  Nothing like getting the first person oral history about monumental recording sessions of music that captivated people all over the world, from the men who helped craft it by capturing it, and thereby preserving it so well for following generations.
B003WSFXKY|5.0|It just confirmed for me that Santana is truly one the greatest guitarists of all time.  To hear him play all these great rock classics is an absolute dream come true.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|i love old movies and some of the new ones but not many of them scarry misters love comdey yhrillers
0486282112|5.0|The writing level and style in this book is fabulous!  The story is intriguing and very unlike the old movie renditions I watched as a boy.  Ms. Shelley's description of the learning curve of the creation, animated as a full-grown adult, was incredibly imaginative and captivating.  The story is quite short, the book arrived very quickly; I highly recommend the seller and the book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|AWESOME!!!!!!!!!! THE BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!! (almost)<br />:) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :)
B007Y36K46|5.0|As usual, we have here a wonderful Disney movie full of fantasy and beauty which is fun for both kids and adults to watch and enjoy. Taylor Kitsch is great in it and looks great, the effects are stunning and story holds your attention. I highly recommend the movie.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|I love Patricia Cornwell and her Scarpetta series. Seems I read them faster than she can write them, but she never disappoints at all. Once you think you know who you are looking at as a suspect, another emerges. There are times I am surprised at the end, and other times I am dead on. A mystery that you are trying to solve as you read it.
B00A0SJWQU|4.0|as it turns out I really did enjoy this movie.<br />Being a Schwarzenagger fan I really wasn't expecting too much from this &#34;remake&#34;, buy I was pleasently suprised.<br />The film really is not a 'Remake' of the original film in the traditional sense.<br />It is based on a slightly different story line.<br />Very well done - excellent casting - I enjoyed it.<br />Excellent Action / Syfi
B009GXHOW4|5.0|This game is EPIC it helps you with your minecraft game and just like the computer u can switch modes back and forth
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I am only able to open the game twice before I have to get rid of it and re-get the game on the kindle fire but it is greatly recommended as a great game by me!!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|A brilliant reminder of what it is to be Human. Simple in it's message yet complex in it's ability to voice the greatness and shortcomings of our human nature and emotions.  It reminds us, that along the journey (of not only Auggie but every character in this book) how important it is for us to understand that none of us is perfect but how we all have ability to be great.  The choice is ours.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|The performances- both vocally and emotionally-- make this the best Les Mis I've heard. The orchestration complements, rather than overshadows, the performers. The arrangements are fresh without being noisy about it. In every way, a glorious CD. My only complaint? It should be a double CD- there was much more that deserved to be included.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|One of my favorite authors. Her books draw me in and keep my attention. I like getting caught up in the lives of the characters and being able to feel their emotions.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game 100% bit I think it has a bug or virus because it never lets me get to the menu!!!!!
B009O2XY12|2.0|This is not the game I thought it was.  It's an okay game if you need a change but one of my least favorites.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|Will not open up after I take a photo.  A waste of money.  Disappointed.<br />I have tried several times.  Would like to find a AN editing program that actually works.<br />I'm still waiting.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is a brilliant book to read. The author really truly captured the thoughts of a teenager. Not only that, he addresses how harmful sexual abuse, physical abuse, and mental abuse can be. To add onto that, he uses the true reasons why teenagers are so unhappy, and how they think. I thoroughly enjoyed this novel, and plan on sharing it with others.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|This case has pretty much everything you could ask for. It is sturdy, good quality, and versatile. I like how it converts to a stand as well as a stylish case. The degree of the angle which you prop the kindle up is easily adjusted which is a feature I was looking for. It does not interfere with the screen either.<br />If there is anything I would enjoy better it'd be one that offers a good vertical view to prop it up as well. But it's certainly sufficient as is.
B0087GF8ZG|4.0|I bought this light to assist our older cat in seeing in the bathroom where the litter box is located. The light appears to be doing its job, as she hasn't &#34;just missed&#34; the box since we got it. Because the wall where we need to mount it is  concrete wall, I used the included sticky velcro to attach it. The night I stuck it up, the light and the velcro were no longer one. I need to get some super glue or something so that it'll stick again.
B0055SWM08|5.0|really makes me think out of the box and set strategy for success. rating request came at an appropriate point when I had had an opportunity to experience it enough to have an opinion. worth the money
B0049J3QF4|5.0|I choose this rating because my two you old son didn't move an inch while watching it, and even I enjoyed the subtle adult humor.  It also has a great message about how important it is to try your friends with respect.  I would definitely recommend this movie to a friend.
B00797MB0O|1.0|This is hardly a comedy. This was a big waste of time. There was no resolve at the end that made up for how awful Charlize Theron's character was. I would recommend watching anything but this. It was thoroughly depressing.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|good game. you have to wait for your buildings to build and make payments. power up are to costly. if you want to do anything you will have to spend real money to do any thing fast.
B005I4JG80|5.0|Being pregnant with my first child I really enjoyed reading about the different philosophy of the French and found myself agreeing with a lot of it.
B00425S1H8|5.0|Trying to find a USB to serial converter that works with Windows 8 is not easy. This one will work with Windows 8.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I wish I had purchased 8 copies instead of 1! Incredible musicianship, wonderful work product, and innovative sound. Love it.
B0050DZ8J0|1.0|I Dont like this app.  too much information for others to see and too many people asking to join your app.  bothersome...
B001VNB54A|5.0|Band of Brothers was excellent and The Pacific is just as good, if not better. Great action and visuals. Money well spent.
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|Draw A StickMan: Epic is a great, time splitting game! You can choose your own stickman by drawing him yourself, you draw the girl you need to save, very fun! My only concern is that Zarp's Fortress is almost impossible for me to beat! Been at it for weeks, just cannot get past it!<br /><br />Over all, its a very fun game to play, whether you feel like playing a app, or you're bored!<br /><br />Fantastic, I recommend it to anyone!
B005I4JG80|5.0|Her story is a fun read - a welcomed break from the many dry advice books. The book is really well.written and funny. I am most grateful she wrote this book as she pointed out what I was missing in teaching my baby to sleep. It was helpful in many other respects too.
B000NH7SZ0|5.0|SDRAM Memory Module 256MB: Bought this to add memory to a laser printer. Open the door, plugged it in and it worked.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|I luv this game, but I keep losing my rewards &amp; credits  when I play. I will give it 5 stars when I stop losing my rewards &amp; credits. Also, when trying to contact support, no one responds. That's another downfall of the game.
B00AX7PGQS|5.0|At first while watching Holy Motors, I was frustrated and angry... I didn't get it! Then I found myself thinking about it all the next day, and the day after that. The urge to watch it again kept growing and now I am finding myself purchasing it on Amazon. When I watch it again, I feel like I can actually enjoy it without the frustration of trying to understand it.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book grabbed my attention from the first few pages.  I loved it.  I would highly recommend it to my friends who love to read!
B007EECSFA|2.0|Couldn't finish this book.  I tried to care about the characters and their quest but could not find anything genuine in either.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I loved this book from the beginning, to the end.  I recommend this book to anyone who is a romantic at heart.
B00A757EFW|3.0|I played this game when it first came out years ago. Haven't had the chance to play it often but it seem like it is the same.
B008KYDUYG|4.0|This is a great purchase.  Each Cd came in soft cases and the music of course is just what I wanted.  I received the CDs two days before expected.
B006X5L6VS|5.0|Really neat app.  It is exactly as advertised and neat to use.  Would recommend anyone that wants to know what stars they are looking at to buy it.
B0041KVXLK|5.0|I read some bad critics about the sound quality of this LP, but i´m not agree, not in my case because when i heard the complete record, the quality is AWESOME, incredible, crisp and clear, very happy with this vinyl!
B004QOB8SY|5.0|When Sherlock goes to see Molly at Bart's hospital and asks for a favour, he already has his fake demise planned in that brilliant head of his.  He takes her into his confidence because she is not a \\"target\\" and she has the means to provide the \\"blood and body\\" of Sherlock.  Corpses are readily available to Molly and he has her wrapped around his little finger because she secretly loves him.  As for his \\"fall\\" from the roof of Bart's Hospital, that was also pre-arrainged.  Sherlock repeatedly warns Watson to \\"stay right where you are\\" because he knows John will have a limited view of him before he hits the ground and the bus that is sitting there is in place to provide a safe object to fall on/into then be quickly hidden away.  I also believe it is in the realm of possibility that Mycroft was involved in the arraingements and provided all the civilians, hospital employees, etc, even the guy that knocks John down thereby delaying him from reaching the scene and dizzying/confusing him.  The assassins are the problem.  Where was the ring leader who directed the others to call off the assassinations?  If he was up on the roof, or a nearby roof, watching Sherlock and saw him jump, then he may not have had a view of street-level where Sherlock would have hit. He assumed that Sherlock died when he jumped. Thus explaining how the shooters were called off.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|I had a LifeProof case prior to this case that I bought from LifeProof directly. That case was amazing. This case however did not fit my phone correctly-the screen is bumby, it doesn't lay flat on the screen. Also in the 3 weeks I have had it the outlet cover has broken off and it has chipped on the side. I extremely disappointed I wasted my money on this. This case is vastly different and alot cheaper than the one I had prior.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game except you should be able to design your character and horse. Other than that it is really fun!
0140067477|5.0|I bought this book when it was first printed. I wanted to share it with a close aquaintence, but could not find my copy. So I bought this for $8, to give as a gift. It does not go too deep intoi Taoism, but provides a good level of introduction to &#34;balance&#34;. An easy read that may have some posative impact on someone. I reccomend it!
B00797MB0O|5.0|How could some of the negative reviews miss the plot? The reviewing of movies should require us to check whether or not we are shallow with ADHD or if we have cognitive thinking skills. This of course wouldn't be a blockbuster but it is a great story with excellent acting. Be disgusted by the plot and Mavis ... we are supposed to be I think. But it isn't a bad movie because of that.
B005LAJ17M|3.0|entertaining, but not really that suspenseful. gets a bit boring. not really interested in season 2 after seeing this set.
B007H7XJD4|2.0|Would give 2.5 because effects were pretty good acting was above my expectations.  Did keep my attention throughout but story was awful.  It could probably suit as an entertaining movie with low expectations going in but wouldn't watch again it's a movie to show off what new toys Hollywood has and there are much worse choices out there.
B00633W614|5.0|This book is a sequel to  &#34;Only Time Will Tell&#34;. Again an excellent book by Jeffrey Archer and a great attention grabber.  I am anxiously waiting for the third book to be published to continue the story of the Barrington family.
B00A757EFW|2.0|I used to love playing pac-man with a joy stick, however trying to play it on my kindle was not realistic.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it has been 10 days since I bot it it is not downloading I am soooooooooooooooo mad; im soooooooooooooo angry
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I enjoyed this Stephen King book but it was so long!  Got tired of it in some violent  parts but the book held my interest enough to keep reading.
B007REV4YI|4.0|The excellent blu-ray.com lists a wealth of special features on the Skyfall blu-ray, as follows:<br /><br />\\"Commentary with Director Sam Mendes: Mendes provides a true \\"scene-specific\\" commentary, and it's obvious he's still very close to the process of making the film, as he recalls details of revising the script, shooting individual scenes (and revising key moments to incorporate suggestions from actors, especially Bardem), working with editor Stuart Baird and the contributions of various effects houses and other departments. Along the way, he provides valuable insights into his directing strategies, particularly in staging difficult moments like the film's emotional climax.<br /><br />Commentary with Producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson and Production Designer Dennis Gassner: This is something of a mix of the old and new guard, as Gassner only joined the franchise with Quantum of Solace, whereas Broccoli and Wilson are the second-generation keepers of the tradition. Gassner is by far the most voluble of the participants, but overall this is a more relaxed and less dense commentary track, with brief but frequent pauses. Much of the running time is spent simply admiring what's on screen, although the participants do slip in some interesting stories along the way.<br /><br />Shooting Bond (1080p; 1.78:1; 59:24): Whether viewed as a single documentary or as individual featurettes, this comprehensive overview of the production of Skyfall demonstrates what can be accomplished when a documentary crew follows a production from the beginning and then edits together the best material. Here you'll find input from most of the major department heads (with the notable absence of editor Stuart Baird), as well as the principal cast, the writers, the producers and director Mendes. For those who don't have the patience for commentaries, this is the place to learn how Skyfall was made. (Caution, however; the documentary assumes you've seen the film.)<br />Intro (2:26)<br />Opening Sequence (4:19)<br />The Title Sequence (2:56)<br />007 (3:48)<br />Q (1:59)<br />DB5 (1:36)<br />Women (4:27)<br />Villains (6:51)<br />Action (3:33)<br />Locations (3:24)<br />Music (3:43)<br />End Sequence (14:03)<br />M (4:47)<br />The Future (2:13)<br /><br />Skyfall Premiere (1080p; 1.78:1; 4:28): Scenes from the world premiere at the Royal Albert Hall, featuring interviews with Mendes, Craig, Harris, Bardem, Fiennes, Whishaw et al.<br /><br />Theatrical Trailer (1080p; 2.40:1; 2:31): As much as it appears to give away, there's so much more.\\"
B001NLKXK2|5.0|I was compelled to read this book because my husband has Alzheimer's. I found the insight  Still Alice brought to me  made it worthwhile to share with family members who had difficulty understanding what my husband is going through. It's not a downer, even though it can't be uplifting. After all there is no upside to dementia.
141659521X|5.0|Vince Finn stories are always one I look forward to.  This is a good story but also details what every day life is like in Afghanistan during these troubled times.
1451695195|5.0|Love to read people's near death experiences and how it changed their life.  It gives great hope that life is eternal.
0385344333|5.0|Lee Child is one of those authors who knows how to keep the action going and the pages turning.  When done I realized what a great story in such a short story time line..
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|All three of the books were fantastic!  It was hard to put them down.  Truly puts you in a different world . . . . I can't wait for the the movies on book 2 & 3!  Mockingjay was fitting end to the series - it  had its own twists and turns.  Definitely a fan of Suzanne Collins now.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Love, love, love this game. If you have time for games this is the one to pick. My friends and myself play all the time,  great fun for young and old.
B004MC0FO8|1.0|one star only because it used worked on my nextbook 8 se ..loved it .. after resetting it I lost the program .. re installed it and it didn't work ?? asked about an earlier version  no reply from shazam tech help...
B007V4530A|5.0|Great for anyone trying to deliver speeches that connects and inspires the audience. Quick read and actionable.<br />Definitely consider the audio whisper sync. It's only $4 more.
B000NJLPYI|5.0|Called Two Wheels Good in the U.S. due to an objection by the late actor’s estate and the song “Faron Young” was shortened to “Faron” for similar reasons. Written and conceived by Paddy McAloon and brilliantly produced by Thomas Dolby, this may be the most perfect pop record ever recorded. I cannot overstate the simple beauty and elegant craftsmanship of the songs on this disc. A 2008 re-release features an entire 2nd disc of acoustic versions of these same great songs re-recorded by McAloon to make it all the more essential to any collection.<br /><br />Prime Cuts: Appetite / Bonny / When Love Breaks Down
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Love it but it gets annoying beacause to get items you need coins but its hard to get then in the game so you hook have to buy them.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|wow this game is awesome so much better than the first temple run since im 11 i know how much your kids will love this game they will be asking to play over and over agian! i really love this game!
B009KHBDUU|4.0|good job by actors.  Nice light hearted movie, not one if you're looking for something serious. Typical Tim Burton stylish/atmospheric type movie.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|This book is amazing it is great for people who like twists in storys has words innapropriate for young children
B000641MB6|5.0|How could you not like this classic. I was going to buy the colorized version, but my 12 year old granddaughter preferred the black and white. A hit for Christmas.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is perfect for people who like minecraft and for people who are beginners also good for passing time at your favorite places because it is just as good as pc version just wish it has more animals
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|Love this CD!  I first listened to the tracks on iTunes.  Even more interesting was the website advertised on the show.  Most tunes from the show are performed by the artists who wrote the song in addition to the recording artists.  It makes it more interesting and enjoyable after the short interviews about the songs.
B008QTVNUI|4.0|I heard other people talk about this show.  I thought it was exciting and a great show to watch the whole season.
B0084U0IEG|4.0|Character development superb. Unusual for Mcewan as story is more like a John le Carre. As always the writing is beuatiful. The instant dictionery definitely helps!
1595828753|5.0|It is always leaving you hanging for the next book... This is great for all of the AVATAR fans who are dying to know what happened after the show ended!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Absolutely love it ! works great for the Kindle , not too much action tho so if u get bored easily, I wouldnt suggest Unless However u have something to preoccupy ur time. DEFINITELY WORTH TRYING &lt;3
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Works just like it should, a little slow in updating sometimes but a good app otherwise.  Like it alot more than being tethered to computer.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved this book! I'm a huge fan of Nicholas Sparks books in general but this is by far my favorite! I would recommend it to everyone!
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|This cable seems some thicker than the one that came with my Kindle.  It seems to recharge faster also.  Great
B007FJFDXS|5.0|This is more of the same (Edge), and sooooo worth getting. Music & puzzle aspects are amazing in this sequel. As in the first game, some dexterity and timing will be needed in some of the levels ... but I was never too frustrated while playing, as the save/resume points are amply placed.<br /><br />When's the next version coming out? Soon, please!
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I certainly found this to be an interesting read and it was one where I wanted to keep going to find out what in the end happened. I felt connected to Camille and enjoyed who she was in her character. The only thing tht dissapointed me about the book was that about half way through i guessed the ending.
0547848412|5.0|To be honest, I first heard of \\"Life of Pi\\" in cinema when I saw the trailer. The few scenes you usually get to see in such trailers already made me curious as they looked beautifully done. Since I usually prefer to read a book first before watching the film version, I went to the library shortly after and borrowed \\"Life of Pi\\". I couldn't wait to start reading!<br /><br />I must say, as much praise as this book has received from uncountable readers, it was quite difficult for me to sink into the story completely... at first.<br /><br />I expected action! Suspense! A sinking ship! Drama! The first 100 pages, though, I got to know everything about religions, several animal species and zoos in general and desperately waited for the real story to begin. Where exactly was the stuff that made people love this book with passion?<br /><br />However, despite the rather long \\"warm-up\\", I was by no means disappointed.<br /><br />In retrospect, I would even say that all the explanations in the beginning were absolutely necessary to accompany Pi on his odyssey across the ocean later on. To understand his thoughts and actions and also the various animals that were stranded with him in the lifeboat. Without the back-story of his life, his knowledge of animals, his enthusiasm for several religions and his deep faith in God, personally I don't think he would have survived two days on the high seas. His strong belief never let him lose hope, even if he suffered from sheer hunger and desperation and was close to delirium - even then, in the darkest hours of his odyssey, he tried to find something positive in every situation still.<br /><br />I found it very exciting to watch him getting along with a wild (usually hungry) tiger on a few square meters - over months! He even \\"tamed\\" said tiger enough to be able to get some sleep every now and then, without having to fear of being attacked when he closes his eyes for a second. However, he was always aware of the danger he was in - and so was the reader. I always felt some kind of menace throughout the read. That certainly was also the case when they found the floating island. Imagine that: A large island consisting of algae or something - with trees on it and a bunch of nom-able meerkats! That must be the dream of every castaway. Pi, just like me, could not believe his luck and soon smelled something fishy about it. Turned out he was right!<br />Better to be back on the boat, even if the only company is a Bengal tiger, and away from that big, scary pile of seaweed. I think the few days on that island were my favorite part of the book. There was something wonderfully terrifying and horrific about it.<br /><br />The writing style was varied - sometimes melancholic, often very witty and always with a hint of irony and sarcasm.

I always felt some kind of menace throughout the read. That certainly was also the case when they found the floating island.

Pi, just like me, could not believe his luck and soon smelled something fishy about it. Turned out he was right!<br />Better to be back on the boat, even if the only company is a Bengal tiger, and away from that big, scary pile of seaweed.

B004TTMYQG|5.0|I just caught myself saying out loud, &quot;Wow, everything that frustrated me about all those other calendars I've tried: Business Calendar gets right.&quot; I'm surprised at how fluid &amp; intuitive all the littlest features seen to be. I just discovered there's a drag-&amp;-drop mode (on week view) that let's you adjust entries visually! I'm actually running 2 of the widgets on separate pages of my smartphone, so I have a brief glimpse at upcoming entries on my main page &amp; I can tab over to view my entire week-at-a-glance. It's brilliant.
0525478817|5.0|What can I say about this book? How can I put into words how sad and wonderful it is at the same time? Honestly, after finishing this book I needed a few days to be able to write a review.<br /><br />The story of 17-year-old Hazel is deeply moving, yet refreshing. A mix that you wouldn't ever expect from a \\"cancer book\\", right?<br /><br />Hazel suffers from thyroid cancer and cannot hope to be cured someday. Death is her constant companion, but she seems to deal with this fact far better than most of the people surrounding her. She doesn't want to be pitied, she just wants to be treated like a normal teenager with normal teenage problems. A special status or \\"cancer bonus\\" is repulsive to her, just as self-help groups to which she drags herself in order to please her parents. There she meets attractive Gus, her great love. They discover that they have a lot in common: books, movies, music. Together they fly to Amsterdam to meet the author of \\"An Imperial Affliction\\", a book which they both deeply cherished for certain reasons. A journey which is about much more than just a book in the end.<br /><br />The characters are incredibly compelling; there are dialogues which are not only enthralling but also full of sarcasm, wit and seriousness.<br /><br />Even though Hazel never would have wanted that, I pitied her :( - and all of the other cancer kids at the self-help group. I admired her for how she handles her difficult situation; she is incredibly strong, even supports her parents in an impressive way when they are threatening to collapse under the deadly fate of their daughter.<br /><br />I  suffered with her when she was closer to death than ever before, from all that water in her lungs... I was happy with her too when, for a short time, she could feel like a normal teenage girl who is in love for the very first time. The relationship between Hazel and Gus was characterized by a deep emotional connection, mutual understanding and interest. They talked about everything under the sun, there was no topic they wouldn't discuss - slowly they grew together, until they knew each other inside out. It broke my heart to follow and witness the growth of this great love.<br /><br />I shed tears over this book. It is definitely not an easy read that John Green presents to his readers; neither the content nor linguistically. The chapters are full of poetry and literature which is thought-provoking yet difficult to understand sometimes. People who are looking for a \\"lowbrow read\\" should rather move on to another novel.<br /><br />I can only warmly recommend to everyone TO READ THIS BOOK.<br />No, it is not a \\"cancer book\\", it is the story of the strong, yet weakened Hazel and both her great loves: Gus and life.g under the sun, there was no topic they wouldn't discuss - slowly they grew together, until they knew each other inside out.

0061692034|5.0|This novel kept me up nights for a week.  I would read it for an hour or so in bed each night and then chase my thoughts around the planet practically till dawn. It's hard to remember another book I've recently read that is this evocative. It moiled long forgotten childhood fears of abandonment in spite of the fact I was never abandoned in any way as a child. Neither was I ever severely tested (and still haven't been for that matter) nor ever dealt cards anywhere near as lousy as those drawn by Dell Parsons, the main character and narrator of the book.<br /><br />You know that dream many of us had - or perhaps continue to have - about sitting down to take a final college exam and realizing that you forgot to read any of the books or attend any of the classes?  Well, this novel reminds you of that iconic nightmare, except it's not a college course you've forgotten this time around, but a deep dark secret.  And while it's true I have never been seriously tested, and believe that my life has been for the most part cushy and predictable, this book brings all of that into question. What if the cushy streak doesn't last and something bad is lurking just around the corner getting ready to pounce? That's definitely possible.  Worse still, what if something really terrible has already happened and I just don't remember it?  Maybe I accidentally committed a horrible crime a long time ago and repressed the memory and am about awaken to my final day of reckoning having totally forgotten to take any notes or in any way prepare for my defense.  Oh my, could that be possible too?<br /><br />Canada is about a 15 year old boy whose parents decide to rob a bank and as a consequence wreck everything for the whole family.  It's called Canada because that's where the boy ends up after his parents are imprisoned, and where he finds himself even more abandoned with an even bigger, life-altering train wreck barreling its way towards him through a cold dark tunnel. Ford tells you right up front what's about happen, and because it's a novel narrated by the main character as a flashback you know he's going to end up okay, and yet the suspense Ford builds is practically unbearable. You find yourself hanging by your thumbs in a dark and empty room with no help within earshot leaving you with no alternative but to keep on reading as quickly as you can.<br /><br />The book is beautifully written in sparse and haunting prose. It has echoes of Moby Dick - not in the sense of Ahab's monomaniacal pursuit of the white whale, but I couldn't help thinking about the ending passage after the Pequod sinks leaving Ishmael as its lone survivor, floating on Queequeg's coffin until that other whaler, the Rachael, in search of her missing children finds another orphan.  It more closely echoes Joseph Conrad's The Heart of Darkness, or the recent re-make of that classic that I greatly enjoyed, State of Wonder by Ann Platchett.<br /><br />Arthur Remlinger, Ford's mysterious antagonist isolated in the empty wilds of western Canada, is every bit as evil as Conrad's Kurtz and as darkly nuanced as Platchett's Dr. Swenson, but unlike either of these characters, Arthur Remlinger is in equal parts Big Time and Small Time. While certainly capable of big time evil, he is at his core just an ordinary guy, with ordinary broken dreams like many other ordinary guys you probably know.<br /><br />Canada is about crossing borders and forging a new life from scratch with no looking back. It's about how even the most ordinary of people are capable of planning and committing serious, even capital crimes. It's about abandonment and human endurance.  The main protagonist and narrator, Dell Parsons, is a character you get to know intimately well and will not likely ever forget. In most ways, the book ends exactly as Ford signals it will end, and yet in another, deeper and totally unexpected way, it doesn't quite end at all. Dark secrets remain.<br /><br />Canada is a book that couldn't possibly be about you. On the other hand, it could be about you and me exactly.  Read it if you dare.e about you. On the other hand, it could be about you and me exactly.  Read it if you dare.

B00005JSGK|4.0|HATARI means danger in Swahili. John Wayne is Bwana Sean Mercer, a great white game hunter, turned live trapper, in Tanganyika (now Tanzania) in Africa of course. Can you buy that? Well just substitute the ball cap for a cowboy hat; the big game rifle for a Winchester 73; and the 4WD vehicles for a horse and you have John Wayne playing a cowboy in Africa...which just about sums up what he does here. Howard Hawks directed this and as other have noted the plot is a little sparse...as was typical of Hawks big productions as he concentrated on relationships between characters. The story is bookended by the initial rhinoceros chase where Bruce Cabot, as The Indian, is gored and the final rhinoceros chase which concluded the trapping for the season. In addition to Wayne and Cabot, you will be treated to Hardy Kruger, the quintessential German Aryan; Red Buttons, who delivers a delightful performance as...Red Buttons; and two beauties of the era, Elsa Martinelli and Michele Girardon, who serve mostly as eye candy, but get to do a little acting too. The music score is by Henry Mancini, one of his best; including the introduction of the memorable, BABY ELEPHANT WALK. The chase scenes are exciting and the African scenery is breathtaking.

B00A4FOWYQ|3.0|Well I just finished listening to the CD for the first time and as an older T&S fan familiar with their older stuff I was somewhat turned off by the slick production, dance songs and missed their quirky, folky sound that drew to me to them. As a reader of this review you should know where I'm coming from: I'm a male in my 40's and like new wave, punk, grunge, metal and yet T&S appealed to me.<br /><br />I pre-ordered the CD as it was T&S and just had to buy it...even though I had already heard the song/watched the video \\"Closer\\" and on their site and saw them perform \\"Closer\\" on David Letterman.  With Heartthrob, there is some faint traces of older T&S in their vocals and lyrics (such as \\"I couldn't be your friend\\") but the throbbing dance beat, slick production and use of electronica is a little too over-powering for my liking. Gone is the guitar based songs backed by drums. I want to like this disc but I honestly have a feeling that after a month it will be a dust collector in my collection and over passed for some other rarely played disc when I want to pull an older or infrequently played disc for a car ride.<br /><br />The CD may have appealing to some older fans and newcomers joining the T&S franchise or family. I perceive this move by T&S to be a fresh new start for them to be more mainstream to gain greater expose in the states, increase record sales, perhaps fame and ultimately money (which they are most deserving of). Some artists may want or have always wanted to try something new -- better to do it than regret not doing it. If this is the direction that appeals to T&S, then I say go for it and be true to yourself (not fans or record sales - but what you enjoy doing). As for me, and no disrespect to the band, but the songs on Heartthrob have little appeal and may very well be my stop to get off the train (but will continue to see them live..at least for another tour or two). I gave this a 3-star rating and wish I could be more positive and upbeat but cant. As others mentioned, you may want to listen to the tracks on this disc first.

B006MW3V6U|1.0|I am a satisfied subscriber to Netflix and have recently enjoyed the 1st season of Downton Abbey. I was surprised to learn that season 2 would not be available because of Amazon's exclusivity agreement. However to continue with this fine drama, I purchased this from Amazon so we could continue our enjoyment. But instead of enjoyment we have encountered frustration and disappointment. We view our entertainment on our TV/DVD. Access on my computer is not only inconvenient for my wife and I but the sound quality is extremely poor. Although the series continues with fine drama, we cannot enjoy it and I  am out $14.99. I would requaet a refund but then I would have nothing - a sorry state of affairs. Clearly Amazon's exclusive rights deal was motivated by corporate greed and not customer satisfaction. To satify this customer, for my $14.99 purchase cost I would request you provise me with a DVD set of the 2nd season episodes so that we can use our TV to continue watching this fine series. Thank you. Please reply.<br />Don Colliver
B0098VXMNE|5.0|keeps to the extremely high standard of the previous 2 seasons. this season is a tiny bit slower to get going, possibly because the new cast members are finding their feet, but when the momentum begins, it's magnificent. we definitely miss john hannah's batiatus; his absence is a big deal, but craig parker's demented glauber soon assumes his charismaitic mantle. no question that this is brilliant television.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game was downloaded for my daughter and she said \\"It's a lot of funnnnnn,\\" she LOVE's IT! She plays it every day off and on and on the weekends, and between homework. If she does not have homework or any other activity's she playing it. I Recommend it! Thumbs Up! She's 20

B00913P6G0|5.0|Good Kid: M.A.A.D. City is a classic, already. Kendrick Lamar (aka K. Dot)  drops his first studio album with Dr. Dre & it's an instant hit. The album is the first in a long time that I can play straight through without skipping. It's also necessary to do so because there is a great storyline throughout Good Kid: M.A.A.D. City. It has the perfect beats (what more do you expect from Dre?) and the perfect lyrics that overlay. The interludes & ad-libs flow vey, very well. It brings back the crucial definition of hip-hop: storytelling. You feel the gradual build-up & climax, you feel like you're in the van with KL and his friends, you realize the lifestyle that he grew up in, you feel like his Mom is yelling at your through the speakers, etc.<br /><br />I have to give it 5/5 stars. And I can only hope that his hunger doesn't die in his follow-up albums, I pray it doesn't.<br /><br />I got the deluxe edition for the additional tracks, but if you don't want to spend the extra money - the main album has the longest & depth of content.

0425252868|5.0|I have collected and read around 100 WWII books, specifically those about aircraft and their pilots and crew for many years.  All are true and contain fantastic stories of how ordinary people responded and performed heroically in many different dangerous situations.  This book captures one of if not THE most noteworthy of all I've ever seen.  Author Makos truly makes you feel like you know the individuals involved and the narrative brings the reader back in time to relive the training, deployment, and action of the air war over Europe.  I have read Gen. Galland's book and many others describing action between Britain, America, and Germany and this story was never mentioned.  I did not see the photos of the two fliers, Franz and Charlie together in the back of the book until I finished it and I was pleasantly surprised to see not just those, but the video on line of their first tearful meeting.  What a wonderful story and message to all of us!!  My hope is that chivalry is not dead and that doing the right thing in all situations will be learned from our veterans around the world who have had decades to think about what they lived through to ensure a better world for us and those yet unborn that will beneift from their sacrifices.<br /><br />Well done, and thank you for preserving and bringing to light a story and message that will be timeless and important for many years to come!<br /><br />I'm sure a lot of readers are looking forward to seeing the movie!!  This would make a Great one!!

B008FYZIVY|4.0|This series is excellent in every way--script, casting, acting, costumes, sets.  I don't know anyone who doesn't like it.  I bought this set because I missed Seasons 1 & 2 and wanted to catch up before watching Season 3 on TV.  I only gave it four stars because the discs were slightly problematic.  The first disc stopped playing part way through and I had to fiddle around with it.  The rest were okay for me.  I loaned the discs to a friend so she too could catch up and she had some problems with the other discs but then cleaned them and they were okay.  I don't know why they would need cleaning being brand new and not being handled with dirty hands.  If the discs hadn't been a problem I would have rated this set five stars.
B009IEXKXI|3.0|The book bogged down with two many scientific equations and numbers. It is a great story and would no doubt be a great movie. The drama gets in higher gear and character development accelerates only towards the end. For an astronaut stuck on Mars we learn very little about his personal life on earth. Pretty good effort but the end was poorly done and left the main character undeveloped, uninspiring and basically unlikable. A few changes would have made the book a 4 or 5.

B0049H9NVW|4.0|Takenoko is a game for 2-4 players that focuses around caring for a giant panda bear.  This involves having a farmer grow different types of bamboo on their associated, watered fields and moving the panda around to eat it.<br /><br />While light and silly, the theme is fun and beautifully integrated in every aspect of the game.  The components are of excellent quality, from the sturdy interlocking bamboo pieces to the decently thick cardboard land tiles to the miniature panda and farmer figurines.<br /><br />Players build a single garden (board) and move a sole farmer and panda around it while trying to complete hidden goals dictated by drawn cards.  As such your actions influence your opponents directly and will often aid them in completing goals, adding depth to gameplay choices.  When one player achieves a set target number of goals everyone else gets a final turn and then victory points for completed goals are totaled to determine the winner.<br /><br />There are three types of goal cards (players start with one of each):<br />1) Panda goals - claim a certain color/number of bamboo by having the panda eat it.<br />2) Plots goals - redeem when the shown configuration of colored land is on the game board and irrigated.<br />3) Gardener goals - grow pictured color(s) of bamboo to shown height.<br /><br />On each turn a player will choose two of the following actions:<br />1) Draw three garden plots and choose one to add to the board.<br />2) Move the panda and eat bamboo if possible.<br />3) Move the gardener and grow bamboo if possible.<br />4) Lay piping to irrigate plots.<br />5) Draw a goal card.<br /><br />Goals can be redeemed any time on your turn and do not require an action.<br /><br />There are some further rules, but that's the gist.  The game is quick to teach and plays relatively quickly.  There is a fair amount of luck involved, so while your choices do matter don't enter looking for pure strategy.<br /><br />The biggest criticism of the game (from my own group and other reviewers) is balance.  The panda cards appear too easy to complete in comparison to the other goals and points awarded, so there is a tendency for players to concentrate on drawing only those.  I don't think it's game breaking though, and people who drew a variety won just as often in the games I've played (timely use of tokens that prevent a certain tile from having its bamboo eaten can help to derail opponents using that strategy).<br /><br />Overall Takenoko is a high quality, enjoyable game to have on hand for casual or younger players or for breaks from the more complex stuff.  It's not going to blow away veteran gamers, but I still found it plenty worthwhile.own group and other reviewers) is balance.

0393088731|5.0|A remarkable book, Skagboys brings completion to Welsh's Lothian universe. Set against the fraying social fabric of Thatcherite Britain, a slightly younger Trainspotting crowd stares too long into the void of heroin addiction, well entrenching themselves into the rut we find them at the beginning of Welsh's first novel. The book has all the usual traits: the gutteral Leith-speak and amorphous internal dialogue; the cause-effect interconnectivity of characters; the digestion and rationalisation of the self-destruction and violence that inevitably seems to consume everyone. It's a dissection of cynicism and depravity, as only Irvine Welsh can perform.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|I thought the book was amazing, I also loved the movie. Thank you to our military for all you do <3
0756405890|5.0|I was originally loaned this book by a friend and after reading it had to own it for myself. I tore through the 2nd book and now cannot wait for the 3rd. In the meanwhile I will content myself with converting more of my friends to this series. (4 so far, and they are all also upset that they also have to wait for the 3rd book.)
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like that you have to work to get more games. That way there are new games to play and you don't know what kind coming
B0038M2RL2|5.0|This is a great movis and was a pleasure to watch in Blu-ray. A great sequel which not all are. Just as good as the first movie.

1439190275|5.0|This book is very detailed and answers all my questions about low carb high fat dieting and I have lost weight using it.
B000056VJ7|5.0|One of the top albums that is a must have for all music lovers out there.  All songs written by Jim Steinman, master of songwriting in my opinion.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I really like this app. It is fast  and easy to use. I use it mostly to see when it is going to rain.
B000002OMN|5.0|I think this album has the best songs Jim Steinman ever written.  He is a master of songs and Meat Loaf sang awesomely.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Well, wondering why they haven't released a 3DS music video. That's okay though as we might have 3D as a basic in future computerized-PCs either way. Anyone/everyone loves 3D effects and I do more! The music was great, as I find myself listening to a special few over and over for their unique voice rhyming/greatness... oh and like always this CD has the power to grab you wherever you are and hurl you into another dimension that makes you really think good things just because. Once you even wonder if they were piloting a rocket and emergency crashing into the shiniest diamond. I'll have to put the band on my waiting list to make sure to pre-order their latest.
B009E3EWPI|5.0|Since I never got to see Led Zeppelin live, this was the closest thing to it. Sound, cinematography, and mixing were stellar. The CD's were frosting on the cake since I really wanted the DVD. For anyone who missed a live performance by these musicians, I can't recommend this DVD enough. Jason Bonham did a fantastic job standing in for his deceased father; John Paul Jones once again revealed his mastery of multi-instrumental performance; Jimmy Page played with the passion of his youth; and Robert Plant's vocals took me back to the first time I heard this band's recordings. Believe me, if you don't already know, this DVD will show what all the fuss was about and still is about!
B00A9T1HUO|2.0|This CD is a BIG disappointment. Despite a few tracks that display a little musical variety, this disk sounds like a rehashed version of Groban's prior work. There is no doubt that he possesses a lot of talent but this offering doesn't display any growth or style that we haven't heard before.<br />It is boring and dull. Groban is too young and too talented to make such a lazy, safe, offering.
B002SCKT0O|5.0|This is a great comedy. I've always been a fan of Danny Devito and Arnold Schwarzeneggar's movies.  It definitely would be funny if men could get pregnant !  I love the fast service that Amazon provides !!!

B007SGM084|5.0|Love the story line and can hardly wait to see where it goes from here. Ana is my favorite and I seem to cry when she does. Just waiting for the movies to see if they do the book justice.
0061766089|5.0|Dan Brown does a great job putting some of the projects from IDEO into perspective. He touches on practices, philosophies, mistakes, and more. This is a great book for beginning designers and experienced ones as well. It is easy to read, not all that long, and definitely worth your time and enjoyment.

B000E5N6LG|5.0|We have enjoyed Kevin Costner in all the roles he has played through the years.  We had seen this one before on TV and<br />when I found it for sale on Amazon I knew I wanted it to be able to view again.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|Really enjoyed this movie. Bruce Willis rarely disappoints and he didn't this time around. Glad to see Joseph Gordon-Levitt doing some great work, too.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book was an easy an  exciting read. Megan and Connor are a couple who didn't even know each other until it was almost too late. I enjoyed this book. It made me laugh an  kept me wondering what was going to come next.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|It made you love the characters and the story was all though somewhat predictable, still very well written and I didn't want to put it down.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love how fun this game is.  I like how creative this game is and how entertaining the game can be. I enjoy doing each unique level and trying to get as far as I can without dying. All I can say is, this was a great game.

B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I liked the first book in the series, though I feel it's flawed. I was more or less neutral on the second one. This one, I actively dislike.<br /><br />The chief virtue of the first book was Katniss herself - strong, independent, stubborn, and competent. By this book she's badly damaged, powerless, in an increasingly dumb romantic situation, and a puppet for the adults around her. She doesn't seem to understand the situation well enough to rebel - in fact, in the last third of the book she agrees to take the training to be a good little soldier, despite the ludicrousness of throwing someone through a one-month basic training course to make them a useful part of a complex urban warfare action.<br /><br />And... she's not. She gets people killed, she hides, she gets blown up. She doesn't do a single useful thing in the climax of the book, until the last symbolic but badly oversimplified choice. It's rage-inducing, especially because there's one scene earlier in the book where she really seems to get it, understand what value she brings and what changes have to happen, but after that scene she seems to forget all of that and goes along with the flow, to tragic effect.<br /><br />It's relentlessly dark, depressing, and ultraviolent, and doesn't seem to know how to follow its own internal morality. There's a good book somewhere in here, but it's buried deep.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I have had this app on my IPod and I am so happy it is finaly on the kindle fire!!! it has so many fun courses and it is much better than the first Temple Run which I loved to but I love this one more!!!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This book started off a bit slowly and I almost stopped reading. Am I glad that I finished it!  Thanks for an excellent job at crafting a story of loss, adoption and renewal/hope!
B005RDF2NA|5.0|Always a great movie, no matter which Shrek! I just wanted to get this one because it was on Amazon Instant Video and could be pulled up on my SmartTV.  Awesome and quick access!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|It's an awesome app. Basically, you take care of dragons, breed them, and level them up. What's really awesome is that they poop money or something,  and the higher the level, the more money they poop. You can level them up by buying treats with the money. I highly recommend this app
B002I0J5FG|5.0|I played and beat the originals on PS2 and jumped at the chance to grab these HD versions to replay them with my kids.  They thoroughly enjoyed both games.  So EPIC.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|My daughter got this movie for xmas and could watch it almost everyday if we let her. The story is sweet and meaningful and the music is cute too!
B004H1V5RU|5.0|My son LOVES the original Perplexus so it was a no-brainer to get this version.  It will challenge you like the first never did.  Be warned that this thing is much more fragile.  We had to return one due to the insides coming disconnected from the frame.  Our second one is holding up so far.  SO WORTH IT.
B000TEUSJK|3.0|This is an odd movie that doesn't fit the usual categorization. On the one hand it's certainly not a mainstream movie release, yet it attempts to legitimize pornography by wrapping the thinly guised sex scenes in a reasonably costly (for its era) film production.<br /><br />Ultimately, it's an XXX production, no matter how you attempt to classify it. It's of relatively little historical value. I don't condemn the movie outright, but a more well known producer / director would have certainly done this differently and engaged the viewer with their view of Caligula's reign minus the gratuitous sex scenes.<br /><br />To this day I don't know what the purpose of this movie was. In its current unrated version it's not viewable anywhere except venues that display pornographic movies. An historical cinematic anomaly for sure.<br /><br />If you like raw, uncensored adult entertainment, it's worth adding to the collection.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome game!!!! I love that I can compete with my friends and that the scene changes every once in awhile this game is super cool!!:)
B004YXE438|5.0|I love this app. I have all of them. I wish they would come out with more puzzles and soon.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I love this game its even better then the first leper world a great app its good for boys and girls and also its an action game for a long period of time I was totally addicted to this game I think you crazy if u don't like it
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This book is an unpretentious and fun ride with just enough geeky detail to answer questions without dragging on. Topics that seemed primed for a long, minutia filled explanation were expertly dismissed and segued. Many books seem to fizzle toward the end but I was impressed with the way Mr. Weir kept my attention to the last page. Thanks!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|OMG total coolness I cant even begin to explain how much I LOVE it. So much better than the first one. The mine cart would have to be my absoult favortie part! The new zip lines, the GIANT monkey,  also the wired spinny thing,  best app ever!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Who doesn't use our have this app. Keeps me in constant communication with family and friends best and far. Easy to share photo's!
B008O9V4C2|4.0|Obviously, judging from the reviews, most fans are very pleased with this new Donald Fagen album, and you can count me among them. I'm tempted to say that it was worth the wait, but this guy makes his fans wait for new music for such an excrutiatingly long time, that such a pronouncement just sounds like a cliche. But hey, let us rejoice anyway; this is prime Fagan, another painstakingly recorded bunch of shimmering songs that all carry his trademark sound. There aren't any real surprises here, which is fine by me. Some listeners may want favorite artists to occasionally expand their musical boundaries and take chances, but I don't think that such a task is the duty of every artist. If Donald Fagen, for example, started adding hip-hop elements or bizarre electronic passages to his music I think there would be a revolt. So, this sounds like what you would expect it to sound like, and I find that comforting. Very comforting. This new album sounds like it could have bookended \\"The Nightfly\\" or even \\"Aja.\\" Stylistically it's in the same musical  neighborhood. Which rates a thumbs up from me.
B00A757EFW|3.0|Don't play the game as much add I thought would but still loved the game as a child.Easy download, would recommend to anyone who loves the game.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Bought this book based on nothing but the $.99 price and the reviews.  I wasn't sure based on the brief synopsis if it would be believable.  Ended up devouring the book in two days and was blown away.<br /><br />I liked everything about this book.  The science was detailed enough to be very believable but easily presented.  The pacing was relentless.  The characters were well defined and the humor balancing out the tension was surprising and probably my favorite part.  You just don't expect to laugh frequently during a deadly serious disaster story.<br /><br />Kudos to Andy Weir.  I'll be looking for more of your titles.
B0086449YA|4.0|Mark Knopfler's newest offering is a double CD containing twenty songs, ten of which fall into the blues genre and four that continue his journey into celtic music.  As a longtime fan who is still in awe of this man's amazing ability to play guitar, I am finding that his songwriting and his vocal storytelling are starting to take center stage while he allows his accompanying musicians to add their wonderful talents to these songs, so much so that he has nearly become a backup musician to his own music.  This is not a criticism, rather, a nod to a musician who realizes that others can enhance one's music to lift it to new heights that never would have been reached.  Here, Knopfler lets his backup players take the lead, including amazing harmonica (harp) by Kim Wilson (formerly of Fabulous Thunderbirds), Tim O'Brien on mandolin, and Mike McGoldrick on pipes, just to name a few.  Here is a rundown of the track list:<br /><br />Disc 1<br /><br />Redbud Tree--a man on the run seeks shelter from his pursuers in a tree..combines acoustic guitar with that trademark Knopfler Strat riffing<br /><br />Haul Away--lovely celtic sound..this could have been on the soundtrack to one of The Lord of the Rings movies, which I believe another reviewer pointed out<br /><br />Don't Forget Your Hat--the first of many electric blues songs to come..Kim Wilson lets loose on harp and toss in some tasty slide guitar..reminds me of the sound of John Mayall and John Lee Hooker<br /><br />Privateering--Knopfler continues his fascination with mercenaries and nautical tales..starts out with acoustic fingerpicking and turns into a rocking sea shanty, putting you right on the deck of a pirate ship..the chanting backing vocals of the band remind me of Why Aye Man from The Ragpicker's Dream<br /><br />Miss You Blues--a nice mellow country tinged song with harp and mandolin tossed in..I'm not sure why, but this song reminds me of acoustic Eric Clapton<br /><br />Corned Beef City--about a truck driver trying to make ends meet...if you have been waiting for Mark to come out with a true Dire Straits tune, this is it..sounds like Heavy Fuel meets Walk of Life<br /><br />Go Love--a mellow break up song with Mark turning from acoustic to electric riffing..similar to what he does on Redbud Tree<br /><br />Hot or What..more blues and harp..this song reminds me of You Can't Beat the House from Get Lucky<br /><br />Yon Two Crows-more celtic sounds mixed with electric guitar<br /><br />Seattle--might be the prettiest song on the album next to Radio City Serenade..a love song to a woman and a city..very atmospheric sound with lots of tremolo electric guitar<br /><br />Disc 2<br /><br />Kingdom of Gold--more celtic flavor..the words paint images from Game of Thrones/Lord of the Rings<br /><br />Got to Have Something--more blues and harp<br /><br />Radio City Serenade--Chris Botti stars on trumpet to create a nostalgic jazz sound that eventually melds with celtic<br /><br />I Used to Could--electric blues with harp riffing dominating the song<br /><br />Gator Blood--more electric blues<br /><br />Bluebird--slow, bluesy electric guitar with harp<br /><br />Dream of the Drowned Submariner--another nautical tale, mixing electric and acoustic guitar with a haunting clarinet that makes the song<br /><br />Blood and Water--rootsy, electric blues soloing with some wah-wah pedal tossed in<br /><br />Today is okay--a harmonica blues stomper about a boxer<br /><br />After the Beanstalk--country porch blues with harp, but mandolin dominates to give it almost a bluegrass feel<br /><br />While I enjoyed Get Lucky, the more I listened to this record, the more I liked the diversity of it even though it is slanted heavily towards blues.  However, I still believe that the songwriting continues to be top notch and, for me, while I have never thought that Knopfler was a top vocalist, the sound of his voice definitely lends to the music..he has a storyteller's voice..and it makes for wonderful listening.  Buy this record!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this!! If you have ever played Temple Run 1, you SERIOUSLY need to get this! You get to go on Trolly Cart on Railroad tracks, jump over Waterfalls, go on Ziplines and more!! Get this app. If you dont like it, get rid of it. Its a free app, so you have nothing to be worried about. Trust me, you wont regret it!

B005NKGEP2|4.0|At first, I couldn't get in to this book, but it got such good reviews, I persevered and am sure glad I did!  It is unique in the way one part is wrapped in another--what a strange kind of brain the author must have!  Bravo!
B0027MJU00|4.0|Something must be wrong with me and something is definitely wrong with Gillian Flynn and that is alright with me. I picked this up because I absolutely loved Gone Girl. Flynn has a knack for making a reader want to know follow the lives of people who are just unlikeable. Meet Libby Day, she was seven years old when he mother and two older sisters were brutally murdered by her older brother Ben and she is NOT a nice person. Who could blame her, really, how do you grow up nice after such a terrible event?<br /><br />Flynn does a fantastic job of making you both dislike and sympathize with Libby. She grew up poor with a drunk daddy and seemingly weak mother, she was trucked off to trailer parks after her family died. She grew up with a entitlement complex, everyone owed her something and if they didn't give, she would take.<br /><br />I don't normally do story synopsis in my reviews, but needless to say, Libby is forced to look further into the murders and come to terms with her memories of that night.<br /><br />Truthfully, not many people in this book are likeable with the exception of Patty and Lyle. Though, for me, it was more of a \\"I feel sorry for you\\" kind of like. But, I was rooting for Libby, smiling a little whenever she performed just the smallest act of kindness (OK what kindness would be to Libby). I wanted her to be OK and I wanted to know what really happened in the Day house that cold night.<br /><br />Though, the mystery of it all is what what catches us readers mostly, it is Flynn's ability to create these lush characters. I know lush is not usually a word one would associate with Flynn's writing. Her prose is biting and wicked, but you still feel like you can enter this world and feel along with the characters. I think that is why her stories are too unnerving for so many. You don't want to feel like you can live in a world with Satan-worshipping cult killers and drug addicted strippers and kleptomaniac depressives.. but we do live in this world, we do.<br /><br />I am giving this book 4 stars only because even though the twisty ending was twisty... I just don't think it was wicked enough. What does that say about me? I have no idea... but on to Sharp Objectsdo.<br /><br />I am giving this book 4 stars only because even though the twisty ending was twisty... I just don't think it was wicked enough.

0385344333|4.0|If you have read the previous 16 Jack Reacher books, you will read this and no review will stop you or bother you.  I'm in that class.<br /><br />Having read all of the Reacher books, this isn't the best effort.  There isn't the same speed or connection as in the other books.<br /><br />What you do get is a Reacher adventure with some surprises, twists, and turns.<br /><br />Reacher is still focused on doing right by people that can't maybe do right by themselves.  Plus, he again manages to find himself in a ridiculous situation.<br /><br />So its got all the Reacher features, but not all of the Reacher soul.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Keeps you on the edge of your seat want to read more not knowing what is going to happen. Then how the games end. Can't wait to read the next
B003Y3ZTGA|5.0|This is bubble gum pop in its truest form.<br /><br />I don't think that I would qualify as Katy Perry's target audience, but this album is really a lot of fun and a great feel good, summer album.<br /><br />Everyone has probably heard &#34;California Girls&#34; and &#34;Friday Night&#34;, but throughout the production is sharp, the lyrics catchy, and its just fun.
B009439HEY|5.0|If you're a Genesis fan you will love this. Pureists will complain about the female focal on Ripples - but it works for me. Entangled is the best track.
B0099Y2MYK|4.0|Season two is the best.  Season three left it open for an interesting season four.  The costumes and settings are beautiful.  This season gives even more of an insight into how social class distinctions were/could have broken down even more.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Great movies and great quality. I have had absolutely no problems with any of the discs or special features everything works perfectly.
B005IQZB14|5.0|This book is wonderful....I have read it twice and am keeping it on my Kindle to read again....I have always wanted to walk the PCT...and felt I was doing just that reading this book....Much better than \\"A Walk In The Woods\\" in my opinion. But both are good for armchair hikers like me.
B005LAIIQC|5.0|Outstanding way to close a story of intrigue and secrets. I thought the writer was clever in revealing how things are done when government agencies fail especially when they have to cover their blunders.
B0078XFYDA|4.0|Excellent information but aimed for the less informed or younger audience.  Every young person (under 30)) should read this and should be required reading in high school.

B00B2V66VS|1.0|The game worked fine thefirst couple of times I played it when it was first released but I cannot get it to load on my Kindle Fire so I will have to use my iPad where it works.  Get it fixed!!!!!!
B009T3AHDE|5.0|The movie was directed by the fabulous David Cronenberg and Robert Pattinson showed that he truly can act. I hated Eric Packer in the book but Rob made me like him and wish I didn't know what was to come. Keven Durand was great as Torval and I've got a girl crush on Sarah Gadon. She played Elise perfectly. The movie is quirky and has several LOL moments. It is a movie you don't want to miss, unless you are 16 and a Twilight fan. There is no Edward here, just Rob's amazing performance.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|absolutely love this speed pad! had the Razor nostromo, buttons were hard to push and often ghosted. after a year the thumb button started to fail so i bought this pad. WOW! great design, buttons are very responsive and you can save your profiles to the pad instead of the PC so u will have your profiles on what ever PC you plug it into. the only area it falls short is the software. but I guess i am just spoiled by the razor software.

B0038BBA4I|5.0|I swear this is what the Angels in Heaven are gleaning inspiration from. What a treasure of music and a wondrous voice that is unparalleled.
B004SUDQ8Q|5.0|anyone with a wit of interest in aboriginal cultures and the -inevitable-misguided yet well intentioned interference and determination to assimilate so called primitive cultures into the white (ANGLO SAXON) world view/culture this movie is an poignant example in this case australian aborigines, but is relevant to the native-american experience among so many other so called primatives. and peter gabriel's sound track is absolutely stunning. ya gotta see this this movie!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This alarm app works great. I am glad I got it. I know I will get a lot of use out of it.

B002TOJHCM|5.0|arranged with tabs for easy understanding...very nice mix of songs as well. works nicely on my kindle fire, and easy enough that as a novice guitar player even I can understand what is expected. :) Thanks guys. :)
B000SVZIDA|5.0|I have own this movie since it came out with The Red Curtain Trilogy. I have been waiting for it to get the same treatment as other films that have come out on Blu-Ray and this one does not dissapoint. Watching this on Blu-Ray is like watching the film for the first time, audio and video being perfect. Really happy with this purchase and excellent service by Amazon. Will buy more from this website.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book was an exceptional true story of the Doctor who witnessed the afterlife.  It's a book that is hard to put down, you want to read it in one sitting.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|This book is still my favorite one. My only issue with it is that it ends. I love them all.
B008TRUDAS|4.0|Great life lessons. Constant and entertaining plot. I couldn't put it down. Wonderful, must read pre teen and teen novel.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Great collection of songs and very well done. Songs done with real heart and emotion. Music to listen to over and over!
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I love the game! I have a hard time getting the app to open. Or it will start to open and freeze. Hope they can fix it!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This story keeps you engaged and takes several surprising turns.  You want to keep reading to see what comes next.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Very good book and much different than I usually read or enjoy.  It kept me wanting to see what was going to happen but I must admit I grew to dislike both characters by the end of the book.  They truly in many ways deserved each other.
1400067820|5.0|After his iconic book The Black Swan I did not think Talib could match it with another, but, Antifragile: Things that Gain from Disorder, is a substantive discourse that is worth reading.
B000FC146C|5.0|The passage of time only makes this book better.  Always a treat to re-read from time to time.  What a story of love and loss.
B00B7G3NFU|3.0|Excellent cast giving excellent performances.  Good movie.  Just nothing to write home about.  Helen Hunt stands out especially for me.
B003YUQ5MA|5.0|Comfortable and exactly what I was looking for, would order them again, recieved the order on the date stated when ordered
B004JZBGWI|4.0|I have this same app on my android, and love that I was able to sync it to my kindle!!  The reason I only gave it 4 stars, I wish it had a few more options in the settings.
B0098460O4|5.0|To me, to listen to Jonathan was a true blessing.  He has a God given gift and it was a gift to me to hear that beautiful voice.  Covered with &#34;goose-bumps&#34;, I actually cried as I marveled at his beautiful voice.  I thank him for sharing his gift with the world!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|first one was addicting, this is just as addicting.  graphics ate much better, and I love the feeling of being high in the clouds about to fall to your death at any moment.  the hilly path adds another dimension to the game.  the mine cart is the only new thing I don't like.  power ups are a little different and their upgrades are a little different, so you have to figure that out.  but if you liked the first one, you should definitely give this one a try.  why wouldn't you?  it's. free!
B00555X8OA|5.0|I enjoyed reading how he and Amos Tversky developed ways to test their theorems.  While I want to believe in the general progress of mankind, his and Amos' data show light on our inherent biases of intuition and that even statisticians are poor intuitive statisticians.
B002U3CCF6|4.0|Gillian Flynn's charcaters are always difficult to define. They ahve good sides and bad sides and are not always likeable. However they do always seem to try and sort things out even if they don't succeed. This book creates some very edgy situations that will ring true to many readers but offers no real solutions to a common problem.
1451695195|4.0|This was a fascinating read. Some of the terminology required serious thinking and slower reading in order to grasp its meaning and intent, but the story was gripping. I think reading this book will be a good boost for anyone who believes as well as to anyone whose beliefs are wavering. For non-believers it is a must.
B005K17RU0|1.0|The weather forecast has been a joke compared to local forecasts. It is I believe not even for the area in which I live, forecasting highs far above anything logical during this season. A waste!
B00AQMSJI2|2.0|This game takes way too long to earn money and gems to upgrade.  If you want to enlarge your village you have to spend days trying to earn money.  Once you build something it costs double to build another one next time.  Once you buy a worker, it takes twice the amount to buy another one.  It costs way too much to expand your property.  Once again it takes way too long to earn money in this game to enjoy it.  Unless you are willing to spend real money to purchase Gems, you will never be able to upgrade your Pirate ship.
0375869026|4.0|3 adjectives to describe this book: memorable, engaging, complex<br /><br />I had read so many positive reviews of Wonder from teachers I respect, that I knew that I had to read this book. Frankly, though, I didn't expect to love it as much as they did. Heartwarming realistic fiction just isn't my thing these days. I was wrong.<br /><br />Nothing could have prepared me for the simple and powerful story in these pages. As a fifth grade teacher, reading about fifth graders, from the first-person perspective of fifth graders, I am simply amazed by how RJ Palacio knows children.<br /><br />Initially I rated Wonder 5 stars, but on further reflection I reduced it to 4. The ending of Wonder is just a bit too Mighty Ducks for me - \\"And everyone lived happily ever after.\\" That's nice and feels good, but it's just not very real.<br /><br />I really want to share this book with my class. I love how it illustrates the complexities surrounding motivations and impacts of our actions. I also found her portrayal of social dynamics at this age to be both accurate and instructive. I only hesitate to read this aloud because of a few references to boobs and kissing.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I like this very much and play this game all the time.  I am so glad my friends recommended this to me.
0547258305|5.0|3 adjectives that describe this book: magnificent, action-packed, unique<br /><br />Graceling is a novel that balances many characteristics that don't seem to fit together. The plot is both adventurous and humorous, heroic and brutal. Katsa, the main character, is both savage and gentle. Though I love fantasy adventure books, rarely do I find them to be genuinely fun. Generally, I find that books that make me laugh out loud are merely trite entertainment. Graceling turned these truths on their heads. From the opening pages I was captivated by Katsa's brutality, wit, and gender bending.<br /><br />Cashore's world-building was as thorough and seamless as her character development.  I hate romance novels, and resist anything too much like Twilight. Somehow, though, the romantic elements in Graceling were far from sappy, and added a great deal to the story. Though the plot did drag at times, Cashore avoided the pitfall that bugs me the most in YA and children's literature. The characters figured out the plot twists at almost the same time I did. I didn't have to wait 20+ pages for them to figure it out already!<br /><br />Graceling was wonderfully fun. Katsa was a thrilling main character to sit with for a few hundred pages. I enjoyed every slice of her sword and punch of her fist
B00280LYIC|4.0|For those who might actually stop to read this, no, that's not a typo in the review's title.<br /><br />This book is really, really good. And the more I read of this series, the better I thought it was. It's not a ground-breaking story, but it's smart, inventive, quick-witted, and fun. By the end of the Lightning Thief, one is invested in the characters and has a real feel for the world Percy and his friends live in. Now, like I said, it's good, but not perfect, which I found worked to the reader's advantage. What I thought was smart about this story was that Rick Riordan left enough unsaid and open in its introduction that he was able to seamlessly embellish on the latter part of the series without it seeming forced or contrived. There was some violence in this book, but not too much, and I thought it was perfectly age-appropriate for its target audience. A great read for anyone who loves action and wants to have a good laugh.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is a great show. We totally enjoy it. Worth watching. If you haven't seen it before, give it a try.
0671042858|4.0|This book was Stephen King doing what Stephen King does best: making readers squirm. The story was more realistic than many of his other adventures--The Dark Tower Series, Pet Sematary, and Black House, to name a few--and because of its more practical backdrop the main character (Trisha) was truly able to shine. There was comedy, albeit gross humor, and a true sense of danger in this tale. One felt as if what happened to Trisha could, in fact, happen to him or her, which was a terrifying prospect. That King also used hallucinations (caused by the starvation felt by the little girl) to create elaborately horrifying scenes with his monster was, again, very smart and scary. All in all, it's a good read, it's definitely worth your time, and it's a great introduction to the works of a master storyteller.
B00729GQ0A|5.0|I am a huge fan of RH. Horror and fantasy with female leads are definitely a high interest for me, especially as a feminist mom of a teenage girl. This book is phenomenal and well written. I was hooked after the first sentence. There is cussing and sarcastic internal monologues aplenty, which is refreshing. I really enjoyed the brewing intelligence of the antagonist Sophia and the trouble she kept finding herself in. Her life got turned upside down and she took it all in stride. Supernatural stuff? Pffst. Boys? Pffst. Near death experiences? PFFST! Sophia can handle it all.
1423113454|4.0|Rick Riordan is back, and he has a new gang of superhuman teenagers ready and willing to save the world from the old gods. This time, though, he's got magicians descendant from ancient Egyptian pharaoh bloodlines instead of Grecian demigods, which is a nice change of pace, while still being reminiscent of what readers loved about his Percy Jackson and the Olympians series. The story, being told in two different perspectives, is a fresh take on a first-person action book. Having the book narrated by two protagonists (brother and sister duo, Carter and Sadie Kane), gives the reader more depth into what is happening around them. The voice of each character is also distinct enough to distinguish between who is talking when--a great feat considering this book is 500+ pages long. The pace is not fast and furious as some might want from the magical world of teen titans, but it's paced fast enough to get a good grip on the world Riordan is trying to create. This book is a keeper and definitely worth picking up.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Great graphics. Has all that is needed to know about your battery and then some.  THe price is right too.
0743497465|4.0|This book had suspense coming out of the wazoo. It dripped from every chapter and kept you hanging onto every page. At least, it did up until the scientists begin to describe, define, and deliberate on the different parts and components of meteorites. Like many of Dan Brown's books, there was a lot of research in his material, and he wanted you, the reader, to be bombarded by factoids and baffled by pseudoscientific half-truths, which could be laborious to read at times. The prose was well constructed, the story was solid, and the characters were great. The science-talk got boring though, and it's not like I didn't enjoy reading about how the science worked into the story; it's more that it took the characters the entire book to realize what the reader could figure out in the first ten or so chapters. But, more than just that, the protagonists rehashed every conversation they'd had about astronomy up until the end (it was a bit like beating a dead horse after a while, a dead sciency horse). Otherwise, this story had it all: strong male and female leads (Rachel Sexton and Michael Tolland), a nerdy sidekick (Corky Marlinson), a vast conspiracy, high-tech weaponry, impossibly fast fighter jets, and, of course, good old fashioned murder.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|i like the story but the acting is not the best.  l am looking forward to the last half of season 3.
B004QKNXIQ|4.0|This movie was entertaining and funny; however it is full of dark scenes with a lot of violence. The portrayal of the mother -daughter relationship is nothing less than disturbing and will confuse young kids, the final scene involves a stabbing, and the premise of the movie is basically a child being abducted from her parents...<br /><br />While the movie has some redeeming elements such as the heroine and her bravery, the hilarious horse character, and some other worthy features, please don't show it to kids under about age 8.  Even my eight year old son was upset by some parts. Because it is a &#34;kids film&#34; does not mean it is appropriate for the impressionable minds .<br /><br />-School Psychologist, and parent of three

B00992CF6W|5.0|im a big fan of minecraft and i highly recommend this app if you want minecraft on the go. works awesome on my kindle fire. works awesome with pocketinveditor. just keep adding the updates and this game will be awesome forever.
0399157565|5.0|Patricia Cornwell knows what she is writing about.  She does get a bit graphic but I believe it has to be that way in order for the author to keep as authentic as possible.  The Bone Bed was a good read and held my interest throughout.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is a definite must have!!! It really feels like you have a real horse! You won't be disappointed. You have to get this app.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|its like fabbo. it is amazing. its like l never thaoght it would come.  - Avery Jennings dog with a blog

B003JTHXOK|5.0|So touching. Sure many women have been through such an emotional dilemma. Love the happy ending. Can't wait to read the next book.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Not surprised at all with characters and action scenes in any Clancy thriller. Exhaustive treatment of cyber-warfare scenario, however, was novel, frightening, and believable.
B00466HM28|5.0|Well my father ordered this product for me abour three days ago not only did this product arrive very fast but it was an amazing controller for my DAW programs
B009CCBCU4|3.0|I am not a literary critic.  I had to work at finishing this book as it didn't keep my interest.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Super movie, one of Denzel Washington's Best Performances! It is currently nominated for two Academy Awards at the 85th Academy Awards, February 24, 2013, Best Actor (for Denzel Washington) and Best Original Screenplay (for John Gatins). I haven't seen the other nominated movies, but I feel that this movie deserves both for a very contemporary theme that majestically portrays the self-deceptive story of a years-long alcoholic airlines pilot. However,  Steven Spielberg's movie Lincoln will probably win both and some others.
B00A9T1HUO|3.0|I like this album. I don't know that I love it. While there are a few standouts, several of the songs just blend together. Tracks 1 and 2 (\\"Brave\\" and \\"False Alarms\\") have similar rhythmic structures tend to run together when I'm listening to them. Track 3, \\"Falling Slowly\\" is plodding, methodical, and uninteresting musically.<br /><br />The standout and highlight of the album in my opinion is \\"E Ti Prometter&ograve;\\" with Laura Pausini. This is the kind of soaring, classic Josh Groban that takes my breath away with its strings and perfect harmonies. \\"Un Alma Mas\\" is also a lovely Spanish ballad.<br /><br />There are a couple of turkeys, which are both cover versions. \\"She Moved Through the Fair\\", all I ever manage to hear is dreary \\"blah blah blah until our wedding day.\\"  Even worse is \\"The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress\\".  Um, no. It isn't. Things that are harsh mistresses:  Elizabeth I. The sea. Glenn Close. Not the moon. I'm sorry that she's so hard for you to love, but please spare the rest of us from having to hear about it.<br /><br />I actually preferred Illuminations over this CD, sadly.  At least Illuminations had a consistent theme - yes, it was melancholy, but the flow of the songs made sense. This one just doesn't gel. But I will be adding E Ti Prometter&ograve; to my main playlist.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fab it's so much fun I really like it if you love horses you will love this game it's loads of fun
B005LAIHR2|5.0|I really enjoyed this one.  Good music too.  Tom Cruise in a rather different role.  Julianne Hough is a sweetheart.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Since AT&T U-Verse cannot produce a good weather channel, this is perfect.  Gives you all the information you need.  Beautiful display.  Even the clouds move.  Pretty slick.  Recommend to anyone who needs to make plans around the weather.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|What a compelling and educational book. I learned a great deal and was entertained at the same time. I'm not a runner, but this book made me consider picking it up!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|One of my most favorite apps. 3 new boards, a +5 powerup for your multiplier and a new Rio theme. I love this app!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I love John Grisham's books. This one, however, is not my favorite one. Normally, Grisham's books deal with issues of justice and righteousness, and come out in favor of the little guy. I suppose it could be argued that this one does that to some degree, but I found the ending unbelievable and strained. Like all Grisham books, though, it was a fast and interesting read, so I'm giving it three stars.
B009VMN3RA|5.0|There is good in the worst of us and bad in the best of us. The winner is the person who meets their own truth and embraces all of it. Sachi is an incredible survivor who deserves only the best.  What a strong woman!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this calculator.  I has large keys so there is no excuse for hitting the wrong key.  It shows the whole calculation not just the answer.  If your answer does look like what you expected, you can check what you entered.
B0085YNML2|5.0|Graphics are very well done.  Sounds and music are cute, and can be turned off if desired.  Puzzles start off easy but build with increasing difficulty.  If you get stuck you can proceed to the next level and come back to the earlier one later on.  Plays very smooth on my phone.  It's apparent to me (45+ y/o adult) that a lot of thought went into this game.  I hope Gamistry comes out with more high-quality games like this one.
1419705849|5.0|My son is really too old to read these books, but he loves them.  I continue to buy them for him because these were what really motivated him to read.  The humor is pitch perfect for a 10-13 year old.  Great pictures and the stories really move.
B00A757EFW|3.0|If you clear the board, it will start the second board for about 2 seconds then nag you to buy the full game.  If you decline, you are thrown back to the main menu.  If you don't mind playing one board once in a while, then it is fine.  And I did enjoy hearing the music and sounds of the original classic game -- wocka-wocka-wocka!
B005COO1X6|4.0|This is a good, intense read.  Typical Stephen King creepy.  My son loves scary stories and this one features children.  My only caution is that it was not suitable to read to a child and I had to edit our quite a bit of language and graphic descriptions as I went.
1401324649|4.0|Has to be re-read for the sheer joy of appreciating the writing, with the occasional LOL sentence to take you by surprise. The characters are priceless and the potted histories are superb. A real fairy tale for grown-ups.<br />Also, top marks to Amazon for super quick delivery.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Not so great ending. No thriller for me. It was an great story line that went nowhere. The premise of a missing wife and an accused husband was for the most part, a story that could keep u on the edge of your seat but alas, this story failed for me.
0988262592|5.0|Numerous times I've heard from executives that they struggle with the black hole of IT where money pours in but nothing comes out. This book provides tremendous value in addressing this problem and clarifying how both sides of the house (non-IT and IT) are at fault.<br /><br />As someone with twenty years of consulting and IT executive responsibility, I highly recommend that you read this book!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I play this game with my girls and they just love it! I love that it has our pony pals.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|It is great music to listen to! If you love watching the television show, you'll want to listen to the music!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is the second time reading this book. Since the movie is coming out I wanted to reread it before seeing the movie. I always read the book first before seeing the movies.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|I love the books by George RR Martin.  I love the show and I heartily thank HBO for providing a place for a show such as this to have a home.  However, I feel bad as I cannot bring myself to subscribe to cable TV just so I can overpay monthly for a single channel to watch a single series.  Fortunately the Blu-ray came out quickly and was well worth the price point.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Enjoy the continuation of this series. But the plot was limited, charecters 2 dimentional, and although enjoyed it the first book was my favorite.
B00ATSBIIG|3.0|I played this all of the time.but am dissappointed there are so many levels that won't open. There is no help to let you know how to open them either.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|THIS IS A QUICK VERSION AND A MANY LEVELED APP THAT I CAN SPEND HOURS PLAYING.  I LOSE TRACK OF TIME TRYING TO BEAT MY ON TIME.  FUN WITHOUT HAVING TO RACK YOUR BRAINS OR STRAIN YOUR EYES.  NOT FOR THE TEENS OR YOUNGER AS IT PROBABLY DOESN'T MOVE FAST ENOUGH.  GOOD GAME.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|It was good but Clancy has done better.Has a newer set of main players and less of the old ones.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|great reaction time testing game. moves quick and changes often. looking forward to see what comes next!<br />very addictive. excellent.
B007XIC1GI|3.0|Picked this one totally out of curiousity, it didn't let me down from that aspect.  He's in the pack with, Johnny Rotten and the Plasmatics.  If we all get 15min of fame, this group gets the hook after 14 1/2.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Kewl product I simply just luv This game every time I play it I want to go back and play it again
B0035JRUZQ|5.0|Very good, classic John Wayne western.  Robert Mitcum and James Caan are also great in this movie.  Highly recommend it for those who love westerns.
B00009UTQD|4.0|This is a fairly large case, suitable for stirring several filters but a bit large in my opinion for carrying around.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|This music changed my life. I used be a jerk. Then I listened to this music and it gave me inner peace. It will do the same to you.
B0009PAVI2|4.0|This is a nice case for holding three filters. Attaches to your belt or to your camera or case strap, so it's easy to carry. The pockets are a little tight, however, especially if you have adapters attached to your filters.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I felt that this book put a new spin on what most do not understand. As a middle schooler who reads at a much more advanced level, I believe this book allowed the reader to fully understand the intentions of each character. Also, the end is certainly a twist. Beautiful book I recommend for ages 18 and up though I myself do not fall into that range.
B004CEUEWE|5.0|Good writing, great directing, good performances by the main cast.  And a nice surprise cameo by the actor who plays Ben Affleck's character's father.
B00A17AD36|3.0|This artist has a great voice.  That's why I purchased this MP3 download since I saw him perform on Jools Holland show and liked his sound and the song he sang on that show. After listening to the first CD I burned, I realized that the &#34;explicit&#34; tag applies to almost every song. I like romance in it's place, but this goes overboard w/focusing on sex and sex and sex and sex, making it seem like that's all there is to think or sing about. Not for me.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I'm addicted to this game. I love it more than the first one. This one has better graphics, its better organized, and I just think it is more fun.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Not quite finished but so far it has been a good read. Looking forward to book 2. Learning a lot of world war 1 history.
B007TXN4TK|3.0|it's a basic piano app that prompts you to purchase more songs.There are better apps out there.the only good thing is that it's free
B008673ZAQ|5.0|It truly is a great read. I can't wait to read part 3!!! So good never want it to end!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I trusted the good reviews and have really enjoyed playing this game. It runs well on my kindle fire. I like that there's incentives for playing each day and missions to complete. I was really happy that the $5 coin doubler also removed the ads. They could be a little annoying because they pop up over the home screen. It's also nice that they change the theme and location and add new characters. This is a really well maintained app.
B00136JQMI|5.0|Really, what can I say about a classic like this?  I feel unworthy of offering a review except to say that if you have any inclination to add this to your music library - you won't be disappointed.<br />I consider myself jazz illiterate (most of my music preferences are more in the vein of heavy metal, rap, and rock) but this is beautiful, moving music and I'm glad to have it on my mp3 player.
B002413TY2|4.0|Fast cars, awesome fight scenes, funny one-liners, and close calls. It´s an enjoyable flick if you´re a Statham fan. It´s interesting to see where they´ve taken the Transporter franchise -- and I´m hoping they do a fourth.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I usually don't give rating, but this book is something special.<br />I choose to hive it 5 stars because it touched something inside, and made me realize how undeniably ungrateful we are. Hazel Grace is an amazing character, she reminds me of what people would refer as \\" The New Woman\\" in the Victorian era. I wish she had a fresh start, John Green is truly a mastermind in the putting of this novel. Partly I felt a connection with the characters, like I'd implantable my whole life. I really do recommend this book, take it from a 15yr old it will change your perspective in life.
B001ECQ4DA|5.0|You know a show is great when it is still in production and they're syndicating re-runs at the same time.
B005FLX2WC|5.0|I love Beth Hart and Joe separately but they are amazing together.  I recently saw Beth on the Kennedy Center Honors and she was the best part of the show.
030758836X|4.0|A Book Review - Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn<br /><br />Gone Girl is the break out novel by Gillian Flynn that has received a significant amount of press and adulation since it was published last summer.  Gone Girl is what I term \\"mind candy\\", a novel of suspense that also causes one to suspend all concept of reality.<br /><br />Gone Girl is written in three parts and attempts to portray the dark side of human nature in the psychological dysfunction of marital relationship after the wife disappears on the couple's fifth wedding anniversary.<br /><br />Amy Elliott and Nick Dunn met, courted and married in New York City. Amy came from a background of privilege and some notoriety as her parents had authored a series of books about \\"Amazing Amy\\", which chronicled an idealized Amy through her childhood and school years.  Nick grew up the only son of a middle class family in Middle America.<br /><br />After Amy disappears, suspicion falls on Nick, because as the husband, he is the most likely suspect.<br /><br />This was a quick read and I found the first half of the book to be a suspenseful page-turner.  I like Ms. Flynn's writing style. It flows well and I plan to read one of her earlier novels. However, none of the characters in this book are appealing. None are likeable. I felt no empathy for any of the persons portrayed.<br /><br />By the time I was into the second half of the book, I predicted where the narrative was going and it lost me. While it was clever and clear that Ms. Flynn had conducted some research on sociopathic personalities, the story became too contrived, too convoluted, well beyond the most outrageous headlines of tabloid news. (except maybe \\"Batboy\\").  I've worked in insurance claims for more than 30 years and have seen a lot of things that one just could not make up. But, Gone Girl left me shaking my head.

1595141715|3.0|The premise and some of the plot points/events in this book are difficult to take seriously.  None of the characters are particularly likeable with the exception of the narrator (Clay) who is too \\"good\\" to be realistic.  Further, some reviewers have pointed out the other narrator (Hannah) was not necessarily supposed to be likeable.  I found her unsympathetic, but if she is supposed to be unlikeable, then this really begs the question as to why good-guy Clay likes her so much.  The dialogue is out of sync with the way teens really think and speak, and the parents of most of these teens are unrealistically permissive.  These are some of the problems.<br /><br />In terms of what the book has going for it?  It's creative.  It's unique.  I like the alternating narratives - this can be tricky, but the author handled it elegantly.  I can tell certain portions of the book were based on author experiences (in a good way).<br /><br />If this book appeals to you, then go for it.  It is readable.  In fact, if you like young adult literature, you may like this one very well.  For my part, I'd hardly call it a must-read.  I didn't find it as deep or moving as many other readers apparently did.  More after-school special than anything else.

B00A0SJWQU|4.0|I personally liked the more campy Arnold version, so wasn't sure whether to see this or not. I enjoyed it's being a bit more gritty and how some of the shared parts/characters of both movies were portrayed.<br />If you haven't seen the first one this would stand up fine on it own though it did miss the ambiguity of the first ending
0439023513|5.0|I was hooked from book one. This whole series takes you on a journey in a world we can only hope we never have to live in. Except in these books of course.<br /><br />Mockingjay is a book that I kind of hated. But I loved to hate it. This conclusion kept my emotions at the edge of my seat and while I didn't like how harsh it was, its also the same aspect of the book that I liked. It was real. The author did not write an end to satisfy her readers, she wrote one that captures all the hardship and psychological trauma the characters went through and I respect that.

B008OOYALE|2.0|t<br />This game is made to check several times a day and is quite fun to see new dragons you breed.  That being said, on the kindle fire there are some pretty annoying issues that need to be fixed.<br /><br />Many times while moving things around on my island the screen will turn blue and I have to click social and then on another dragon world or reload my game in order to continue moving things.  Also moving things around is extremely glitchy and hard to do. It takes swipping your finger sometimes ten times or more in a direction to get the object to move and this problem is exacerbated when trying to move objects to Aa different island you have expanded to.  Other than these certain issues and always getting error msgs when trying to send gold to friends its a very good game.  Will update this review if these bugs are fixed on the kindle fire.
0385344228|3.0|The premise of this novel is quite unique and it could have been a great novel.<br />However, the writing is sloppy, the telling laborious in its endless repetitions . Had the story been told in a more succinct manner, more credibility could be given to the total work. As it is, it rings far fetched and is not appealing.<br />The precipitated denouement seems as if the author finally ran out of steam...
B00B2V66VS|1.0|everytime I open the stupid app it just freezes and closes. its a piece of garbage that needs updated. I'm so pissed off about it
B000MR1V22|4.0|Awesome soundtrack, would listen to it all day if I could. Movie was good too-- a lot of family tension.
B000I5XOVY|5.0|Swordfish has in my opinion one of the best openings to a movie I have ever seen. The writing here is so superb, I think it should have been worthy of an Oscar nomination for John Travolta just for this scene alone. It introduces the character of Gabriel played by Travolta. At first you don't really know what is going on just that Gabriel is here starting to talk about Hollywood movies. As the dialogue progresses you begin to hear Gabriel discussing his distaste for movies lack of realism. He then moves into discussing the movie Dog Day Afternoon. And what would happen if Pacino really wanted to get away with the money he stole from the bank in the movie. Gabriel talks about what if Pacino started killing hostages left and right. How long would it take for the city to reverse is policies on hostage negotiation. It is then revealed that Gabriel has taken hostages and is in the middle of a bank heist of his own. Not to give too much more away for people who haven't seen Swordfish but the beginning ends with an amazing explosion that will rock your home theater system into overdrive along with some amazing visual photography.<br /><br />The character of Gabriel is my favorite Travolta performance of all-time. He plays a character who is always many steps ahead of everyone else in the entire movie. Until the ending you never really know who Gabriel really is, only that he is a bad guy. And he's a bad guy you really like. You are always left guessing at what the motive is behind all of his actions, but he goes on to talk much about misdirection. Throughout the entire movie this is always a reoccurring theme to keep you guessing at what happens next.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is absolutely perfect. Hugh Jackman plays the part of Stanley Jobson who is an computer hacker who no longer is allowed anywhere near a computer and is living in a trailer working a dead-end job. Halle Berry plays the roll of Ginger, who like Gabriel, as the movie goes on you never are too sureof who she really is. All that you are lead to know is that she is with Gabriel and her job is to bring Stanley in because Gabriel wants his computer skills for a job he needs done. Don Cheadle plays the role of J.T. Roberts who worked for the FBI and was the man who arrested Stanley and is the reason he is no longer allowed near a computer. Also following Stanley's arrest, Stanley lost custody of his daughter thanks to Roberts. Roberts now is now on the trail of Gabriel and the one trying to put together what Gabriel needs Stanley to do for him. Lastly, Sam Shepard plays the roll of Senator Reisman. I won't go too deep into what his roll is in the movie as it might give too much away to those who haven't seen it. Just know he plays a very important role.<br /><br />I will say that action movies are by far my favorite type of movie and this movie is a perfect example of why. This movie features everything you will look for in an action movie; guns, car chases (with a beatuiful TVR Tuscan I might add), explosions, beautiful women, and even a bus dangling from a helicopter while flying through L.A. The movie also has a visual look to it that I can't put quite into words. It has some type of yellowish lens filter on some scenes and a cool blueish, purplish, greenish filter on other scenes. You really have to see it, it just gives the movie its own feeling that I have never seen before and I absolutely love it. And I never want another movie to use it because looking at it just reminds me this is Swordfish.<br /><br />The other thing I must bring up is this films AMAZING soundtrack [[ASIN:B00005K2DI Swordfish]]. It was created by popular techno artist Paul Oakenfold. I have never heard a soundtrack like this in my life. It just fits the entire look of the movie so amazingly and will also give your home theater system a workout as well.<br /><br />Finally I will talk about the Blu-Ray itself. The picture quality here is reference quality. Its that good. It also featuresa 5.1 Dolby Digital track which is a bit older than today's current DTS HD tracks but it still sounds very phenomenal.<br /><br />Just sit back and log on, hack in, go anywhere, and steal everything with Swordfish.
B003L77G2Y|5.0|I'm a Star Trek Geek. I loved the X Files. This &#34;Fringe&#34; Is by far the closet thing to those shows and more.They're are no longer doing Fringe so owning the DVD's are a must. Great programing , acting, and the shows are movie quality. This is a must have!
0316023744|4.0|I worked through this book, and of course it is magisterial, and covers the whole story in a deft, comprehensive way.  My few problems were: that it is very military, by which I mean that we get a lot of which battalion did what where, and much less of the human side of things than in other histories; I also didn't get a feel for any of the landscapes that all this fighting was happening in, there is very little description; also I was disappointed in the beginning and the end:  we get nothing much about the 30s and the runup to the war -- essentially we begin in Manchuria in 1937 and Poland in 1939.  A stronger initial chapter would have helped; and as another reviewer has noted, we really don't get much on the long-term postwar impacts.  I also missed having more stirring stories. How can you just give a sentence to the amazing glider capture of Fort Eben-Emael, the Belgian fortress,for starters, or not give us the setpiece of Churchill in the commons/and on radio for his first speech as Prime Minister?  And that's just in the first quarter of the book.  There's a lot of that not here in this book. You can't have everything, I suppose.<br /><br />I really appreciated the maps. Just when you needed a map, there was a map!! (This never, never happens).

0307743659|5.0|I'm giving this 5 stars using the same criterion I always use when thinking about books: the Shining doesn't get 5 stars when compared to any other kind of book, but it definitely gets and really really deserves its 5 stars when compared to books within its genre. When it comes to horror novels, The Shining is as good as it gets (and hasn't been surpassed, in my opinion, in all these years).<br /><br />The story is universally familiar- not just because this book has been a bestseller for years and years, but more widely because of the excellent Stanley Kubrick movie. A young family of 3- Jack Torrance, his wife and their 5 year old son Danny- arrive at the Overlook Hotel, high in the Colorado mountains, to spend the winter isolated there, with Jack as the caretaker until spring hits & the hotel's summer staff return. This job is of crucial importance to Jack- a last chance job- after having struggled to battle alcoholism & a violent temper. The hotel, around November, gets snowed in & access to the nearby areas becomes almost impossible.<br /><br />The book's title ('The shining') refers to Danny's supernatural abilities (=called 'the shining' or 'he has the shine'), his ability that is to see things both in the present and the future that others cannot: things, for example, about the hotel's history, or his parents' most private thoughts. From the time they arrive at the hotel, Danny increasingly has visions of the hotel's bloody history, and as the snow gathers around the building, so too do ghosts and various other forms of evil fill the hotel and the family members' minds. This ability that Danny has 'to shine' somehow gets 'added on' to the hotel's gruesome powers, leading to unexpected and horrifying consequences that I won't go into as that'll be providing spoilers. One of the central themes has to do with the hotel's ability to gradually and subtly turn the family members against each other, leading them to almost lose their minds.<br /><br />What's most interesting though in the Shining, that makes it a fantastic, sophisticated read, is the way Jack Torrance's mental struggles (both with alcoholism, with his past and with his frustrated dreams for the future) get closely linked to the evils that lurk in the hotel. So the reader has to constantly figure out (and it's never entirely clear)- what's happening inside Jack's mind, what is essentially a form of breakdown he's going through, and what has to do with the hotel's ghosts? His brave struggle with his overwhelming personal difficulties, and the enduring, reparative nature of his love for his son are as important to this novel as all the horrors within it.<br /><br />Just to warn any potential reader though: once you start this book you won't be able to put it down as it's so gripping; it's a fantastic roller coaster of a page-turner. However, you'll need nerves of steel to go through it, so this is just to be prepared!
B002UHSDUK|5.0|This album made 'All my Life' probably one of my top five favorite songs ever.  The acoustic version of Everlong is great, plus the Amazon bonus track 'Have a Cigar' is one of the top tracks on the album.  Love it.

1451695195|4.0|As evidenced by the appendixes, Dr. Alexander knew he would have been the target of so-called 'scientific\\" skepticism and yet he went ahead and told his remarkable story in clear, sometimes beautiful, language so the rest of us could see what he saw during seven days in a coma -- and derive both clarity and hope from it.

B00A9T1HUO|2.0|Look, neither this nor Illuminations is a musical masterpiece.  I get the garden variety \\"Grobanite\\"...you think this guy can do no wrong when clearly his last two studio offerings reflect a talented singer plainly unhappy with the voice he's been given and has been unable to reconcile himself to it.<br /><br />Josh Groban will never be a rocker.  He will never be a \\"pop sensation\\" and quite frankly, he should grow up and not want to be.  Every artist has to go through this phase and I guess this is Groban's \\"douchebag\\" phase.  He pouts his way through interviews, gives smart ass answers, shows his condescension for his more rabid fan base and his disdain for those who would use his more romantic selections as background music for their foreground life events.  He's behaving like a spoiled baby brat and it's showing in the music, it's showing in the way he conducts interviews and it shows in the way he refuses to comb his hair for pretty much every picture.<br /><br />This album is a waste of time, money and effort. It's cringeworthy to listen to and embarrassing to hear an otherwise talented singer painfully sing his way through selections Justin Bieber wouldn't touch.  The pace of \\"Brave\\", the strain in his voice to hit money notes in \\"I Believe\\" are disjointed and badly engineered.  Groban is not Paul Simon.  He never will be. The kind of music that Groban likes, listens to, buys and collects is not and never will be the kind of music he is able to sing.  With the money he's made over the years, he should be grateful but what we get from this album and from Illuminations is his defiance to accept the inevitable:  he will either spend his years singing to the overheated soccer mom crowd or he will  make a new career in the field he trained for: musical theatre.<br /><br />The smart-ass comedian he struggles to be is tired shtick.  No one is interested in his smart-aleck, flippant answers to basic questions and no one finds it cute..  We get it:  he's auditioning for Saturday Night Live.  We get that he sits home watching far less talented celebrities like Lindsay Lohan and his erstwhile girlfriend, January Jones limp their way through hosting duties and skits that Groban could knock out of the ball park.  But that's not our fault.  That's his fault and his agent's fault for being unable to get him those gigs.<br /><br />He had a chance to change all of that during his Joshy Washy years but it was far too important to him to drop out of college and shellac himself with David's Foster's cornball schlock and for all his effort, he received a lifetime typecast.  These were his choices and he made bad ones.  Acting like an ass about it now only makes him look like he's going through some kind of premature mid life crisis.<br /><br />illuminations should never have been given the time of day and All that Echoes ranks right up there.  Groban needs to grow up, get over himself and return to music like Awake if he is going to continue this singing thing.  Awake was his best album and All That Echoes is just Illuminations Part Two.
0670023329|5.0|Escape From Camp 14 is the fascinating, if at times disturbing, tale of Shin Dong-hyuk, the only known escapee born in one of North Korea's concentration camps.  Journalist Blaine Harden's masterfully multi-dimensional and compelling tale weaves Shin's experiences in the camp, his escape, and psychological adjustment to the world beyond the barbed wire.<br /><br />My interest in Escape From Camp 14 started with a feature on NPR last March, but the interview didn't just spark my interest, it reignited my fascination with what is the perhaps the most tightly controlled, institutionally barbaric society ever to have existed.  It reminded me that North Korea is a place where psychopathy is not an aberration, but a cultural imperative.  North Korea is a society built on lies and deception and life is forfeit for the smallest infraction.  While this is true of the general society, it is even more so in the prison camps.  For instance, Shin relates the story of a young girl who, in a camp classroom, was beaten to death in front of her fellow students for the sin of having five kernels of corn in her pocket.  As the girl was beaten by the instructor, the other children watched, understanding that this consequence was completely normal for the camp.<br /><br />As a former intelligence analyst whose specialty was North Korea, Shin's story brought back memories of the experiences of hundreds of other defectors and escapees.  Since the 1950's, North Korea has perfected a system of prison camps into which hundreds of thousands of North Koreans have disappeared.  Escape From Camp 14 provides a startling first-hand look into one of the very worst camps.<br /><br />As a writer of speculative fiction I like to explore the psychopathic persona so much so that in an early review of [[ASIN:B004YTI32U Any Tomorrow: The Calling]] , the reviewer thought my character, Henry Turner, was excessively violent and sexually aggressive.  After reading Escape From Camp 14 and recalling the horrorsother defectors have reported over the years, there is nothing I could have written that can compare to the institutionalized mechanism for the terror of the North Korean prison camps.  In comparison, they make the NAZI concentration camps seem tame and the Soviet Gulag welcoming.<br /><br />For anyone who values freedom, who has an interest in humanity, or desires to know what hell is like, read Escape From Camp 14.  Then try to imagine surviving it.

B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a real awesome game. Its very entertaining and I like to pass their missions. The cool thing about it is that you can skip their missions in the shop if you don't like it or if the mission is too hard.
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|what a waste.. I love how liberals try to create \\"art\\" by making Christians look like fanatics.  So stupid!!  This movie has no morality.. I want my money and time back!
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|This is a good option for parents looking for a return to childrens movies which have a moral to the story and limited influence from pop culture. I put it on for three children aged 3 to 6 with no complaints. The wife later watched it on her own. No complaints here.

B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This series keeps you on your toes. American Horror Story is suspenesful, gory, brilliant, and amazing. We loved every episode, and couldn't wait for the next show. The end of the season a very creative would never of thought. Loved way the season started also tied it together very well..
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Not much to say... just a near-perfect summer blockbuster type of movie. Great dialogue, great action, good chemistry between the cast. Extra features are pretty entertaining as well. There's things to nitpick about the movie but that happens with pretty much every movie.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Waking Up Married is fun reading with an excellent plot.  Kelly keeps you guessing what will happen<br />from cover to cover.
B006ZS81GG|5.0|Let me start by saying: I had never heard of Lana Del Rey previously. When I got the chance to experience this masterpiece I WAS TOTALLY HOOKED! I love the level of depth and cinematic elements her music brings to the table. There are strong undertones of sexuality in just about every song on this album and it demonstrates a powerful yet unique experience throughout each track. She has the most interesting, creative writing style and anyone who cant understand that this album is remarkable obviously has no understanding of the foundation of music. The problem with music today is the simplicity of it. There are not many new artists who understand that in order to make great music you have to reach deeper inside of you to find something that will touch others. Lana Del Rey has the gift of making great music that will impact people from all elements of life and that is very rare in this day an age.
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|Movie of the year. A must see. Stare addiction in the face. Bright, forthcoming, accurate, honest and troubling, well written and informative.

B008FYZIVY|5.0|Glad I got first 2 seasons so now I understand all of the charactors. It is a very complex story.
B002C6A6N6|4.0|Gave this as a gift to a friend who is mad about the series.<br />It's almost impossible to find in the stores here in Australia, was thrilled to be able to purchase it through Amazon.<br />Delivery was fast, and reasonably priced.<br />This pack contains the whole TV series and also the 2 movies.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Cannot wait for next season.  Really moves well and has a fantastic story line. Get yours soon or you will be sorry
B0026IUXME|5.0|Beautiful score, superb acting, and a plot that leaves viewers worried, hopeful, yet guessing in some aspects even in the end. I would ask anyone to view this film regardless of having an interest for this time period in our history or not.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This is a good game.  It has good graphics and storyline.  It has a user friendly interface.  I like that they added little brain teasers within the seek and find puzzles.  The ability to zoom is a plus.  I would definitely recommend this game to anyone that enjoys a storyline with their seek and find games.
B0041TM5OU|5.0|I love this album!  It sounds so rich on vinyl.  Everything came as it was supposed to.  Very good buy.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Best series I've ever seen!  The characters are all great and the scenes are beautiful!  Hope for many more seasons!
034580404X|5.0|My mother wanted to own this series of books, so I bought them for her through my account. A friend of hers recommended that she read these books, but she has told me that she can't get interested in the first book because of the content. Despite that because many other women in the world love these books, they arrived on time and in great condition.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I love love this version of angry birds, it's a lot of fun and makes it easy to pass the time.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|So I will not expound too much on the first set of reasons why I did not like this book, namely the plot developments and the various terrible things that happened to basically every main character. That part sucked and was a real letdown after investing two books in the cast. If you want to read about that though you can enjoy basically every other negative review. The real reason why I am writing this review is to complain about what I see as the lack of well executed action scenes. Granted this is in the eye of the beholder, and to a degree I have been spoiled by a lot of really great Tom Clancy action sequences but the issues is still a problem.<br />  Part of the problem comes from the fact that Collin's steps outside her comfort zone in writing the action sequences in the first place. The first two books focused on individual fights with relatively close quarters combat, and although there were parts that I did not particularly like, the scene with the Muts in the first book comes to mind, it was decent on the whole. In the third book though the fight shifts to the national level, and many of the scenes are poorly implemented. Good examples would be the scene where the missile strikes occur, or the scene where Katniss and Gale are shooting down hovercraft. In the first they just hide in bunkers and absolutely nothing happens, meanwhile the second actually has something interesting happen, but the idea of shooting down fast moving, mostly invisible aircraft with exploding arrows strains the bounds of credulity, and once more the implementation involves them just sitting there for a while shooting arrows in a boring fashion.<br />  I do not think that the book should be entirely action oriented, but just like in the other two installments, action anchors the rest of the plot and drives the character development forward, unlike the other two books though, in Mockingjay it is implemented very poorly and makes the book boring and disappointing to plod though, especially when paired with unfortunate character development.<br />  Finally, in response to the people justifying all the terrible things that happened to almost every main character as realistic, I should point out that most people do not read fantasy to be depressed and see their favorite characters tortured, killed and mentally scarred. If people actually wanted to see the sad reality of war they can go sign up for the army or read a horror novel. And lastly it occurs to me that reading Stalingrad by Antony Beevor was actually less depressing than Mockingjay. You can take that however you want.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|Great free app from Amazon. Installed quickly & works without any hiccups on my Galaxy Tab.<br />Reasonable permissions needed. All these apps remind me of when CD-Roms first started coming<br />out for PC's & there were all kind  of reference programs, games & utilities coming out.
B00475AYJQ|3.0|I love this author. I burned through his first book in this series and started on this one with great excitement. It was going great, when suddenly, it turns into a sex/romance book for quite a few chapters. It was jarring. I skipped the entire scenerio because I didn't like it at all. The hero goes from a interesting character to a lech. I will still finish the book and buy the 3rd in the series but for me, this was a stumbling block.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|top notch...ya gotta appreciate this one...does all that you can hope for...just the way i'd build one, only a lot better!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I became totally engrossed in each episode. The next episode takes too long coming.<br />Downton Abbey will  be sorely missed &#34;til next season.

B0015DWJX2|5.0|My book club chose to read this book.  I did not like the title. It sounded too cute . I loved the book. The characters are very artfully presented and seem friendly and interesting .

B0076DCT2G|1.0|After reading most of the offerings from Nelson DeMille with great pleasure, I was excited to have another opportunity to enjoy the exploits of John Corey in this series.  Unfortunately, there was little to like in this drawn-out novel with its unbelievable plot, poorly developed characters, and now irritating protagonist Corey.<br />That this book was written by Nelson DeMille is as unrealistic as having John Corey and his wife travel to Yemen to find the 'Panther'!  Please, Nelson, tell us that the real author was some hack, not you!!
0756405890|4.0|Let me make two things clear before I write this.<br />First, I read this directly after finishing A Dance with Dragons, so I certainly wasn't starved for good reading.<br />Secondly, I went ahead and read the negative reviews and I find that I agree with 90% of their content.<br /><br />Nevertheless I gave this book four stars. The reason for that is quite simple, really: the negative reviews have looked at it from quite the wrong angle, in my opinion.<br />Yes, Kvothe is unsympathetic.<br />Yes, Kvothe is an arrogant ass.<br />Yes, Kvothe is enormously overpowered.<br />Yes, Kvothe is literally the only character to receive any real characterization.<br /><br />But all those things are okay with me.<br /><br />This isn't a well-rounded fantasy installment designed to transport the reader into the world and immerse them in the tale of an identifiable protagonist. That's the type of novel most seen in the literary world of today, and while I do like them I'm always happy to see exceptions. A Song of Ice and Fire is one, and this is another, but aside from breaking the traditional mold of sympathetic fiction they really share little in common. Kvothe is meant to be a hero, someone to inspire the ages, someone who does the incredible and shrugs it off, someone who exceeds all reason and defies the odds. In that he is extremely successful. In being a character who you identify with and imagine yourself as, he is not. The book would be better suited to the third person than the first in this regards, but I for one appreciate the first person narrative of his exploits at the academy since he provides a beautifully biased narrator.<br />Now, a major pet peeve of mine is deus ex machina. It's half the reason I could never get into the Harry Potter universe. I hate hate hate it when a protagonist is suddenly given a mysterious cloak/map/sword that is strangely more powerful than all the other powerful magics they find themselves around and that just so happens to come in handy before long. This is something I was never faced with in the book. While Kvothe was lucky it never came off as being contrived or popping unexpectedly from the woodwork, but rather integrated into the overall story.<br />Put briefly, Rothfuss was extremely successful in creating a book that is beyond a doubt a hero's tale and very little more. I honestly only didn't give this book five stars because even a hero's tale requires other characters to support him. We have the crazy teacher, the rival, the good friends, and the love interest, but honestly I could hardly tell them apart. Kvothe is a ruby lying on a small pile of sand, for all the other characters are given. While a lot of this can be excused as the fact that he is obviously not an empathetic man and he is the one telling the story I still cannot give in good faith five stars to a tale of one character. A good novel (a good book, really) just needs to have a little more than the linear tale of one hero, no matter how engrossing and classic.ndy before long.

B0094BB4TW|3.0|Sometimes hard to read and get on with this application. It's a lot easier on the computer. The pictures are too big and makes it difficult to minimize.
B00AYB1RGG|5.0|If your into this kind of Sci-Fi action film than it wil be the best hour and a half you spent in front of your high def flat screen tv in a long time. It was a good movie to &#34;stream&#34; on a &#34;winter&#34;, &#34;saturday afternoon&#34;. Would I spend the money for the Blueray copy? &#34;No&#34;.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing.  I love you can play anywhere. What I like is that you don't have to do all the work that comes with temple run like tilting the screen. I also like how once in a while the theme changes. Very good game subway surfers.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|My favorite genre is historical fiction. This book had everything from romance, tragedy, triumph,and then some. The war scenes were very difficult to get through, how can humans be so very evil? Living in a Democracy we can easily forget or under appreciate the freedom we experience daily.

B001ANSSDC|5.0|This is a beautifully written book about holding on to hope after being knocked down. About getting back up and slowly putting the pieces of your life back together with the help of family, friends, and even an occasional episode. I've found myself crying and then 2 pages later laughing hysterically. Whether you're an avid reader or not, I'm sure you will enjoy this book.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this temple run is so much better than the first one.  I could posh it all night if I could... but sadly I cant :(  but u should totes get this app ;D
B00APUQT7I|4.0|It's nice to watch something humorous, and that is<br />not chock full of profanity and the stress of reality.<br />The storyline is well written.
B005LAJ1H2|5.0|First I would like to say keep up the good work HBO, BoardWalk Empire is unlike anything I have seen on cable televison relating to organized crime since the Sopranoes. This show takes you back in time when alcohol was illegal to cosume any where in the 50 States in America. Nucky Thompson played by Steve Buscemi made that possible to all the patrons that entered Atlantic City at that time back in the roaring nineteen twenties error.  If you are a organized crime film buff like I am, this sitcom is one of the best underrated shows ever produced in the history of televison in my book. So get your glass filled with whatever your name of drink is and, set back and enjoy the ride back in time in class of the underworld and prohibition at it's finest.
B0090EIC3Y|1.0|Look, I get the Sacha Baron Cohen schtick...sometimes I even laugh.  But this just felt like an exercise in going through the motions.  I'm still waiting for my first laugh months later.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|It was a very heart warming movie. Great story. My wife really liked the movie and would recommend it to anyone
B005LAIIA8|5.0|The family really enjoyed this.  It's classic Tim Burton with a sweet story to boot.  My son (50 at first was scared it was going to be &#34;scary&#34; but by the end he couldn't take his eyes off of the screen.  Loaded with extras including the original frankenweenie short.  Highly recommended.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|I could hardly put this book down.  Once I started this book I was hooked on the special relationship between the two main characters.  Opened my eyes to the special requirements in caring for a quadraplegic and the devotion of their carers.  A very emotional story, very well written and I thoroughly recommend this book.
0525958002|4.0|Good read especially if you're a Duran Duran fan.  I found the early part a little slow, but really picked up when the discussions about forming the band started.  Amazing how luck smiled on these guys from the beginning.  The end feels a little rushed, but a good read nevertheless.
B001AW156U|1.0|These things are horrible. I just installed them, and the slightest pressure makes them pop off. The only alternative is to ruin the controller by gluing them on. 1 dollar isn't enough to cry about but 5 dollars for shipping?? And they were shipped from less than 15 mikes away.
B004GYY714|3.0|I found itr difficult to turn off once i had tuned it in.  Not user friendly from my perspective.  Liked the sound quality.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This book, although very similar to twilight, was defiantly a page turner and kept me excited the whole time. I will be starting the next one tonight.
B00B19GKI0|4.0|This is a fun movie to watch. It is somewhat dated by today's standards, that's why I gave it only 4 stars. I got this for my son to watch because the main character \\"Snake Plisskin\\" is in a couple of video games that he plays and he wanted to see what the character was based on. He loved the movie and couldn't stop commenting on how fun it was.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Had me on the edge of my seat and could not wait for the next episode! Great must see show! Can't wait for the new season to start!
B003B1X80Y|5.0|This will forever be my favorite movie. Its the best love story by far and I just had to buy a blue ray copy to appreciate it even further. I think every girl wants her own Noah after watching this movie. I could watch this again and again and the story never gets old. Everything about it is simply beautiful. Love Noah and Allie!
B00280LYIC|5.0|I am 9 years old and I thought t<br />he book was awesome . I recommend this book to Percy Jackson lovers and readers. You learn a lot of Greek gods and what they are. Read the next book to keep the excitement going.

B00B2V66VS|3.0|This game is kind of lame . I like the old one more because it wasnt like everything else so thats what i think ...
B0077ATSSQ|5.0|To the critics of this movie, you must first understand that this boy has Asperger's (a milder form of Autism) and then you will come to understand how \\"everyday simple things\\" are very difficult for this boy to understand, his own fears or \\"panic attacks\\", his journey to make sense of his father's untimely death, his attempt to reconnect with his mother and other people and lastly how to accept and handle his own grief. I found this movie to be utterly wonderful.

B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Josh Groban edges into pop territory on \\"All That Echoes.\\"  Two pop gems open the set.  His first single, \\"Brave,\\" uses strings to build the tensive quality before Josh's voice soars on the chorus, \\"You wanna run away, run away, and you say that it can't be so.\\"  It's a great opener.  \\"False Alarms\\" follows with strings again building to crescendo juxtaposed by a darker lyric, perhaps about a love affair gone wrong, \\"Have you raised the final anchor?  Have you cut the lesson free, sending off our due redemption like a funeral at sea.\\"  Josh covers Glen Hansard's \\"Falling Slowly\\" from his 2006 CD [[ASIN:B000GH3CVQ Swell Season (Dig)]].  Where Hansard's voice sounds weathered, Groban's embraces the melody, \\"So take this sinking boat and point it home; We've still got time; Raise your hopeful voice; You have a choice.\\"  \\"Below the Line\\" that Groban co-wrote is another pop gem with Gayle Levant's pixie-like harp sprinkling musical magic and Groban's voice urgent.  Jimmy Webb's classic song \\"The Moon's A Harsh Mistress\\" has been covered by so many artists like Judy Collins, Joe Cocker & Linda Ronstadt.  While Groban's arrangement doesn't strike me as vastly different, he dives into the beauty of the melody, \\"The moon a phantom rose through the mountains and the pines.\\"  The set concludes with Stevie Wonder's \\"I Believe (When I Fall In Love It Will Be Forever).\\"  Groban embraces the song so completely that it sounds as if Wonder wrote it for Groban.  \\"All That Echoes\\" builds on Groban's evolution as an artist and does it with class and confidence.  Bravo!
B00AFEXRME|2.0|The previews really had me thinking that this was going to be a really good movie but it just didn't deliver.  Many parts could have been cut out that just didn't seem to make sense in the movie.  Denzel does a good job like always but overall just a generic extremely boring movie........

B003JTHXOK|5.0|I really liked this Nicholas Sparks novel because it wasn't the usual, predictable ending. I also liked it because it did touch upon abuse and why the victim stays with and often protects the abuser. I liked the exciting conclusion and interesting twist at the end.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Loving Season 3 of Downton Abbey.  Builds on the great stories from seasons 1 and two.  Amazing how a show with such a huge cast keeps the surprises coming, and keeps you interested in their individual stories.

B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is just perfect. The only thing I didn't like was that it was written in letter form and I had to adjust to that but I got used to it. You should most definitely read it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Exciting read.  Loved all three books.  Don't need the movies that are coming, but I am glad I read the books first.  The books are always better.  I know the movies will be good and I plan on seeing them all.

140123769X|4.0|One of the things that has sort of bugged me about Fables is that at times you can tell that it's been running for a very long time and as such, has begun to fray at the edges and occasionally sag in the middle. It's starting to show it's age here and there, as all long running series inevitably do. That's why I was glad to see that we're finally starting to get some of the various plot points resolved that were brought up volumes ago. Most notably, the prophecy over Snow and Bigby's kids. Not all of the answers are given here, but we do have two names presumably checked off on the list.<br /><br />And I'll warn readers ahead of time. If you aren't ready to watch young characters do some terrible things and have terrible things done to them, you should prepare yourself. It's not exactly Frank Miller bad, mind you, but I know that for some it's harder to watch bad things happen to children as opposed to adults.<br /><br />I rather liked the story in this volume. It's sad and at times creepy to see what becomes of Therese. She really undergoes a lot in this story and while I can't say much more without giving some mondo spoilers away, I'm interested to see what this volume's plot will do as far as the Wolf family dynamics go. One Wolf child certainly has some explaining to do and I'm not certain that this specific person will go completely scot-free. On a side note, we do see some side mentions gearing up for future plot arcs. Fabletown is truly dead and gone, but there's the potential for new residency... maybe.<br /><br />Art-wise, this is a bleak volume. There's some wonderfully surreal panels in the last third, but as the story here is bleak, the artwork needs to reflect this as well. It helps drive in the fact that something really is wrong in Toyland. I will say that the artwork in the side story \\"The Destiny Game\\" is much better if we're going to be comparing the two, but this is normally the case with side stories in the Fable-verse.<br /><br />Overall this is good. It's giving me a bit of a fresh interest in the series, but I still don't know if this will be enough to fully bring back everyone. It's definitely worth checking out at the library, that's for certain.good.

B007ZTLLMK|2.0|This game while it does work okay on Kindle fire with accelerometer to 'kinda sorta' gyro emulation. The game-play requires very precise movements and takes the joy out of flying a RC Helicopter. The game gets boring as it does not have realistic environment, physics or the controls of a helicopter. It does however attempts to simulate some sort of RC Helicopter flying experience. If you have played with those RC helicopters before the controls might just make you feel like a professional.<br /><br />May be I just do not like flying RC helicopters?? or because of my less patience with these sorts of things. As some other reviewer has already pointed out. This game is not for everyone. If you have the patience to fly a tiny helicopter which you control either via gyroscope or joystick to make it land where the game tells you then you will be fine, otherwise in my humble opinion get out on a nice sunny day and fly a real RC controlled helicopter which are really fun to fly.
B000OVLINI|4.0|This well written book takes its time to unfold. The reader is immediately drawn into the story, but then the narrative has a bit of a meander while we meet various colorful characters. I haven't finished it yet (after two weeks) so can't yet say if the author ties it all together.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game!!! but I do not know if it is better than the first they r both awesome
0385344228|2.0|I really wanted to read this book from the first review I read in the newspapers. Afterwards, I do not understand those rave reviews. The former first assistant DA did things no attorney would ever do.  Though a few hints to side track the reader were thrown out, the narrative gave continual clues to the actual ending. I found it easy to solve early on.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This is a great game for passing the time!  I love trying to beat my previous scores. I also love the different games to choose from.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|Cute movie and the characters were fun! I'd rented this to watch on the plane and it was pretty fun.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Ultra realistic sound. Fully customizable. I really love this little app. If you like sleeping to nature sound it's a must have.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Wasn't sure if I would enjoy playing this but I find that I can't put it down!!!  I really enjoy this game.  Great way to pass the time if you have nothing to do while you wait.
B004W1GCQO|5.0|Love it,can't wait for the next one.  Wish I lived back then, upstairs of course.<br />A little ostentatious and maybe even garish, but who cares.
0765325950|4.0|Great book, aside from all the loose strings. The last quarter of the book felt extremely rushed, I honestly think they could have made yet another book if they had completely fleshed it out. It had some minor inconsistencies (not going to get into them, as they are major spoilers), but the main reason this got four stars instead of five is because I got no closure. I still feel like there is more to come, and there very well may be.<br /><br />Now I just have to wait for the WoTcyclopedia :D
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This app offers no bells and whistles, just like it says. I needed a simple, User friendly calculator and this meets that need nicely.
B009GEAPYW|5.0|Epic Awesomeness.  Probably one of the best Batman stories ever told.  As you can see, I loved this movie.  Hopefully they will release a disk with both parts on it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I just started watching Downton on amazon last weekend.  It was so good I had no problem paying for the TV Pass to watch all of season 3 before it airs on PBS.  Season 3 was the best yet, and I can't wait until next year for season 4.  I hope amazon can bring it to us before the January, 2014 US start date.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This probably one of the best apps and super easy to use. Highly recommended for all.<br />The easiest way to access your desk top from anywhere.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This is a clever, challenging, cute game that lets your creativity come to life.  The puzzles are challenging without being esoteric. I really like seeing what I draw become part of the game. It makes me feel part ownership in it.
B00004XMTJ|5.0|My favorite musical to date that I have seen. Its great for kids and adults to watch together. You wont be able to get the songs out of your head.
0062119044|2.0|Was it just me or did Ms Shriver use every word in the dictionary that most people either have never heard of or rarely use? I found that to be extremely annoying and hard to get close to the characters due to my feeling she thought she was above everyone else - including her audience. I am not a dumb person -college educated, and I found her to be condescending in her writing or was that on purpose to assist the reader in disliking Eva. Eva is not a \\"bad\\" person, nor is Franklin. They had two different parenting styles. I believe nature and nurture were both part of Kevin's destruction. Eva never wanted to have a baby and should have gone with her instincts. She wanted to make Franklin happy. Some people are not meant to have children - she was one of those people. Were their problems with Kevin that neither one of them caused? Yes, absolutely. Kevin was born with severe hatred in him. Did Eva dislike him for it or just because he represented a change to her idylic life? Both. She disliked him and sensed the inherent \\"bad\\" in him. He couldn't hide it from her and she was too smart and perceptive to miss the signs. Franklin is more of the confusing character to me. He either was not smart enough to see the \\"real Kevin\\" or he truly didn't want to see it. Where was the therapy? Where were the interventions? If Eva knew there was a problem, why didn't she get him to see a professional? And please, someone please explain to me her having another child? She used Celia as a test, yes a test to see if it was her or Kevin as the problem. You don't have a child to \\"test\\" a theory. Eva knew Kevin destroyed Celia's eye. Why not get the girl and get the hell out of that house. Save your daughter for goodness sakes! I read this book like I read all books - the first chapter, then the last and then the middle to understand it better. I did not like this book. I did not like any of the characters. But, then again, were we supposed to? I think not. I bought this book after the tragic Connecticut Sandy Hook shooting. I wanted to understand how and why a person could do this. I still don't know - even after reading this book. BY the way - as usual the movie is not true in all aspects to the book. If you want the real story - read the book.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Watched my husband play this for a few days then decided I wanted to play my own. Fun, easy to play, and quite addictive.
B004XZR63M|4.0|I don't know why amazon doesn't let you give 1/2 stars.  In the same vane of many books with the aim to change your mindset to an investing type millionaire philosophy.  I think it's important to read these books as motivation to keep trying.  Nothing ground breaking or earth shattering but good advice.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I installed this app thinking that I wouldn't like it but I was wrong! Its very similar to temple run but I found this MUCH more addicting.. You get new players by getting unlocked and also when you hit the sides of the train you DON'T lose all of your coins. Hopefully this review helped. I would definetly recommend this game to anyone who like Temple Run.<br />P.S: IT'S FREE!!
B001NLKT60|5.0|A great continuation of the trilogy....the twists and turns are juicy and very well done. I'm in the middle of the last book of the trilogy, and I'm very sad to be coming to the end of the BEST series I have read in years.
B0041KW076|3.0|The music 5 stars, the vinyl pressing ZERO stars. - Well what can I say.  I was so pumped up to get some of these new Beatles 2012 vinyls and I must say I am disapointed to say the least.  The two I got, this and Help have so much noise that they sound like I got them at a used record store and they were 35 years old,  I am not sure I will buy anymore of these as much as I wanted them all but I just can't take the heartache when I play them thinking they should be and sound new and they do not.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|This product works extremely well and the vendor was very cooperative with replacing the first set that we got.  Both were awesome!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|There are a few really illuminating chapters within several biographical chapters.  I like the scientific explanations that the author found did not discredit the spiritual revelations.  The only disappointment was that when my Kindle indicated there was still 20% left, that 20% was devoted to footnotes and thank you's.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|easy, love fact that I can review prior calculations, then clear then when ready. Would recommend it for a simple, daily use household calculator.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I honestly never wanted to see the movie or read the book. But something kept bringing me back to it. I'm so glad I read this book. I was touched by Pat 's story. I rooted for him and couldn't stop reading until the end. I admired his optimism despite his circumstances. Definitely worth rereading.
B00095NX9G|5.0|My mom is getting into belly dance for exercise and I thought I would surprise her.  (she works out in her room with the door closed, whew). She said this was just what she needed.

B004JHYRYU|5.0|A very thought provoking book. It projects you into the emotional dispair of World Way 2, contrasting with the love and attachment of some of the characters.Quite interesting
B007UWBQEU|5.0|Carrie Underwood scored a hit with this song.  This songs talks about the storms in Okla and the storms of life.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|I thought it was a page turner.  Was afraid it would get too desperate and depressing, but it always felt hopeful.
B00AF6B22E|5.0|Unlike some others, I avoided this movie precisely because I thought it would be just about a plane crash. But this movie turned out to be such a mesmerizing human drama dealing with addiction, relationships and consequences of actions. It exceeded all expectations I had. Denzel was amazing in his role and surely deserves the Oscar nod. The plot is original. I enjoyed it a great deal. Well done. The trailers and promos for this movie focused on the plane crash. In reality, this movie was so much more than just a crash. I think the promoters should have focused more on the other aspects of the plot.
B008M721MS|5.0|i like it a lot better than kindle keyboard. like the color and fact can read n the dark! wathing movies is a plus too!!!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|like others said it is very addictive.  i kept playing to get more puzzle pieces.  once you solve some of the puzzles you will be able to play for a longer period of time with out running out of coins when you cash in the prizes.  read all of the prizes and choose the one that will benefit you the most at that time.  you don't have to do the one that comesup if you have enough of the other ones.
B00190N4E4|4.0|Gandhi staring Sir Ben Kingsley in 1982 release of Lord Richard Attenborough  biography of a simple lawyer who became a world known and leader of the liberation of India from British rule. Gandhi gets his start as a peace leader in the late 19th and 20th century in South Africa, where he started a peaceful resistance movement against how people of color were treated. Gandhi brought both Muslims and Hindus together to peacefully protest against the British Empire and the laws that discriminated against people of color. Gandhi was put in prison, but was vindicated; when he is released from prison and the British changed the laws. After finishing his work in Africa, Gandhi turned his efforts into ending the British rule over India. After many years of struggling and being placed into prison Gandhi is again rewarded, when the British Empire grants independence to India. Gandhi helped with the forming of the new government until an assassin's gun ends the life of the man of peace. Gandhi is remembered as a man of love and peace, who brought the British Empire to its knees.<br /><br />This movie also shows the virtues and the beliefs of a simple but great man named Mahatma Gandhi. Gandhi was a Hindu who brought people of all religions together to solve the problems of his day. With the Hindu belief close to his heart Gandhi stood against the mighty British Empire to free India. With the belief that there are many ways to get know to God, Gandhi brought Muslims, Hindus, Jews and Christians together proclaiming that all are equal. Gandhi believed all people could live together and get alone peacefully. Seeking to bring himself closer to God, Gandhi taught peaceful protest. Gandhi used peaceful resistance to show the error of British rule. Gandhi did not believe in attacking the man because he was ignorant of the error of his own ways. With his faith and his own personal will, Gandhi moved the world and taught that love will conquer all. - Eddie Souther<br /><br /> Attenborough, Lord Richard, writ. Gandhi. Perf. Sir Ben Kingsley. 1982. Film. 9 Feb 2013.<br />`

B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Very good topic to cover in 'Flight'.  Excellent, nail biting event on the plane itself, but I still wonder why they had to throw in the FULL nudity at the beginning.  The movie would have been just fine without it.  Not that I don't appreciate the nudity in some movies, this one just didn't need it.  Outside of that, Denzel once again proves himself a five star actor.  He does an outstanding job of portraying a drug and alcohol addict out of control, yet still can be functional enough in an emergency.<br />I definitely wouldn't recommend this as a 'first date' movie due to the embarrassment it may cause during the first ten minutes of the show.  But aside from that, I would suggest everyone (adults) to watch this film.
B0062NAVXA|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie.  After watching, I downloaded the song &#34;Courageous&#34; as well.  If you liked Fireproof and Facing the Giants, you'll like this one too.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I don't even like zombies, but TWD is one of the best shows on tv. With the introduction of the Governor, Rick and the gang have an adversary just as intresting as they are. Keep it comming!

B0009YNRZM|5.0|This review is for the 2005 Original Master Recording of ONLY MONEY:I was not aware of this release until recently,and was  hesitant to buy it as what I read in reviews gave me the impression it was not really superior to the 1995 Ryco/2012 ZFT versions(which are the same)-I think these regular releases sound great,but direct comparison to this OMR version shows OMR have done their usual audiophile magic-I've noticed tambourines and acoustic guitars I never paid attention to before,punchier bass and an overall clarity over the standard issue-Tape hiss is more noticible,however-Most fans may want to stick with the regular CD-very reasonably priced these days-But for anyone who considers this an iconic piece of the Zappa catalog,and is familiar with other OMR works,this CD will not disappoint you-and new copies seem to still be available for around $40-This is the definitive version of the original mix!
B0036S4CTS|5.0|The movie version was not horrible but you really should read this book before seeing it. It was familiar in a number of ways but different enough in key respects that you really cannot just complain about it being another predictable romance story.
B006UW4OB8|4.0|This app keeps your passwords secret.  What I like about it is that I have never had a problem bringing information forward regardless of new PC, tablet or cellphone.  I have never lost any information or been unable to get my information from an older version or different format.

0988262592|5.0|If The Phoenix Project had been around years ago, I could have given it to my family and friends to explain what it was I did for a living.  It's a novel about IT, DevOps and Business that demonstrates the pain (and success) of being in IT.<br /><br />The story triggered a heap of memories for me - like:<br /><br />* Thinking that things couldn't possibly get any worse, but they do.<br />* Being angry with the marketing department for celebrating a release when we were still fighting sev 1 production errors.<br />* Hearing someone expound on theoretical concepts and having no clue what it meant.<br />* Using Kanban to dig us out from under the train wreck.<br />* Seeing things finally turn around for the better.<br />* Getting home in time for dinner after a release with no hotfixes.<br /><br />It feels good to read a story that so closely describes the dilemmas I experienced.  Gene Kim, Kevin Behr, and George Spafford have created a truly entertaining read that people in IT will instantly recognize.  And now I have something to hand over to friends and family and say, \\"Here - this is what my job was like!\\"
B007ZVSHR0|5.0|This is a great album with plenty of ridiculously catchy, upbeat songs to keep you dancing. It also  has a few more heartfelt, somber songs to balance the mood. My personal favorite is \\"Shady.\\" A more somber favorite would be \\"Broken English.\\" I have been listening to this album every day since I bought it.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|AWESOME love this game I'm addicted can't stop playing  I'm telling everyone about this one. Best game I've played in a long time.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This continues to be one of our favorite movies.  Seeing it in blu-ray on an 8 foot screen is better than seeing it in the theater.

B008S4FZHI|1.0|She gets worse with every book, why did I bother buying it. I loved her early work but its so disapointing now.
B0063GORYU|5.0|A very good game. A little easier than the one that came installed on the desktop which is fine by me. I wouldn't mind skipping the ad that pops up as each hand is dealt, but one click makes it go away (instead of it being a persistent little bugger).
B004KBSQBA|5.0|Had this on LP many years ago.  Loved it then and when I saw the Paul Simon special on PBS I knew I had to have the CD.  It's my favorite recording of all time.
B009O2XY12|4.0|I like the game. Challenging. Directions fairly clear. Keeps asking if I want to buy extra lives/powers tho' which is somewhat annoying for a free download.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|I REALLY ENJOYED THIS CLASSIC. I PICTURED THE STARS OF THE MOVIE IN CHARACTER. BEYOND A LOVE STORY. SO MUCH PAIN TO LOVE SO DEEPLY.
0062060562|4.0|I have to admit that this kept me gripped and made me want to pick it up every time I had a spare minute.<br />The idea of 'losing' part of your life is scary. Knowing that no matter how much information you soak up during the day, you'll forget all that information and the day itself by the time you wake!! Our brains are so intricate and amazing and we know they can be damaged so that simple realism is fascinating.<br />It's refreshing that although Christine's days are basically the same, the book maintains interest and keeps pace right up to the end. My only quibble would be that whilst the ending wasn't a let down, the attention to detail was. I couldn't really explain without spoilers, but I just felt a couple of things at the end were tied up a little conveniently without explanation. This moved away from the attention to detail during the rest of the novel which I felt was a shame. Would deffo still recommend though, and look forward to seeing the film adaptation as it's a great idea for a thriller!
B003O86FMW|4.0|Kept me up at night, when I should have been sleeping. Loved having something to share with my daughter too.

B001BANK32|5.0|Stephen King's \\"The Shining\\" is an amazing character study that drives a mood-heavy, emotionally deep, and unrelenting literary horror. The story centers on Danny Torrance, a young boy with a unique ability. Termed the 'shine', Danny can sense the future, and communicate mentally and emotionally with his inner self and other people, alive, and sometimes less so.<br /><br />Stephen King writes `childhood' masterfully. He's able to tap into the emotions of youth, and create evocative realism in their thoughts, dialogue and action. Also found in his magnum opus \\"It\\", King places children in extraordinary circumstances; yet still creates very realistic, thoughtful and down-to-earth reactions and behavior.<br /><br />Also like \\"It\\", King explores what makes people different as they grow and mature, both physically and mentally. It's this difference, this change from youth to adult, which sits at the core of the narrative. A doctor tries to analyze Danny's abilities, and rationalize the relative normality of what Danny's parents feel is extraordinary. Within his description, we view King's premise that certain superhuman capabilities can only be had in youth: \\"You know, schizoid behavior is a pretty common thing in children. It's accepted, because all we adults have this unspoken agreement that children are lunatics. They have invisible friends. They may go and sit in the closet when they're depressed, withdrawing from the world. They attach talismanic importance to a special blanket, or a teddy bear, or a stuffed tiger. They suck their thumbs. When an adult sees things that aren't there, we consider him ready for the rubber room. When a child says he's seen a troll in his bedroom or a vampire outside the window, we simply smile indulgently. We have a one-sentence explanation that explains the whole range of such phenomena in children--\\" \\"He'll grown out of it,\\" responds Danny's father.<br /><br />Danny is resilient, strong and vulnerable. He is often overwhelmed by his 'shine', but manages through. And while this capability is largely internalized, his mother Wendy is aware of her boy's uniqueness, \\"...she was in awe of her child--awe in the strict meaning of that word: a kind of undefined superstitious dread.\\"<br /><br />In the character of Jack Torrance, Danny's father, King is clearly working through his own battles with alcohol. His personal demons become Jack Torrance's and translate into wonderfully evocative internal monologue. As the book draws to a conclusion, one seems to be reading the insights of a fastly deteriorating mind-- what's inside a brain blurred by alcohol, and soaked in spirits (both liquid and ethereal).<br /><br />King often turns his stories around the craft of writing, and unsurprisingly captures the essence of the tortured author in Jack. As Jack deals with his internal demons fueled by alcohol, and emotional monsters fed by an abusive father, King explores the nexus of abusive and violent behavior. He explores the human condition as it relates to self-control, and self-awareness, or lack thereof; when ones baser nature breaks loose. As caretaker of The Overlook Hotel, Jack repairs a section of roof and discovers a massive wasps nest embedded at the roofline. As Jack attempts to destroy the angry hive, King uses the wasps as a metaphor for Jack's violence (from his own father and toward his son, Danny) - a theme that recurs throughout the story. Jack ponders, \\"When you unwittingly stuck your hand into the wasps' nest, you hadn't made a covenant with the devil to give up your civilized self with its trappings of love, respect and honor. It just happened to you. Passively, with no say, you ceased to be a creature of the mind and became a creature of the nerve endings; from college-educated man to wailing ape in five easy seconds.\\"<br /><br />We learn early in the story that Jack, in a fit of range, broke Danny's arm when the toddler made a mess of his office. Jack lives with the image of a version of himself that had the capacity to inflict such a horror on his own little boy. The rational side feels that never again can he allow such a thing to happen, but it's clear that Jack is not always in full control of his faculties. There is no internalized redemption for ones past sins. They're just saved and kept hidden and out of sight; a destructive force, a menace, waiting for the next release of energy. The question King seems to raise is whether that force will target oneself or another.<br /><br />The crux of King's dramatic (and horrific) tension is how he teases out just enough information to propel the plot and build the reader's suspense while obfuscating an equal amount detail by filtering the context through the eyes and understanding of a child. It's King's balance of the real and surreal, the normal and abnormal that drive the elements of horror in this novel.<br /><br />If you're familiar with the Stanley Kubrick movie version of the story, you'll find much the same story arc. In the book, the details are sharper and the themes more poignant. This is an amazing book...ranking a close number 2 of everything I've read from King, right behind `It'. Don't hesitate to pick this up.

B004LSO7IS|5.0|This movie was so tastefully done and so true and how things work out. The cemetery between both woman was breath taking.i loved the story line I had a good friend go threw that same situation and she said it just happen like the line \\"the heart wants what the heart want\\" can't be any truer.
1573300403|5.0|It will be a keepsake... both the music and the moves are priceless and I couldn't wait for it to be upgraded to Blu-Ray.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|I play on my kindle fire hd. The puzzles are increasingly more difficult to get a three star rating on a level. Fun fun fun if you like brainy games for all ages.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is so awesome its perfect for kids terns even young adults!!!!!!!!!! But don't play for to long because it can be seriously addicting :)
B008G8SFGO|3.0|I've been a fan of KISS since the first album.<br /><br />Rolling Stone ran three reviews...one for the first Montrose album with Sammy Hagar, one for the first KISS album, and one for a band named Stray Dog. They predicted that all three were the superstars of tomorrow. They were right about Sammy and Montrose. They were right about KISS. Stray Dog? Well, two out of three ain't bad.<br /><br />Here's what I have to say about the new KISS album. It rocks, it's solid, you should buy it.<br /><br />No matter how much marketing and hype and KISS Army B.S. Gene and Paul want to float, they will NEVER make things right about Tommy Thayer donning Ace's makeup and Eric Singer donning Peter's.<br /><br />There are three sides to every story...Gene & Paul's, Ace & Peter's, and the TRUTH.<br /><br />Tommy and Eric have NO RIGHT to the legacy laid down by Ace and Peter, but because they serve at the pleasure of their masters Paul and Gene, they suit up every night as if they did.<br /><br />THREE stars for a solid rock album. MINUS TWO to Gene and Paul for KISS-ing up to your fan base while doing what you KNOW is WRONG. I don't think ANYONE would object if you did it Kulick-style...Gene, Paul, Eric & Tommy...WITHOUT makeup, or WITH Tommy and Eric in NEW makeup, like you did with Eric Carr and Vinnie Vincent.<br /><br />But to do what you're doing insults Ace and Peter, it insults the legacy, and insults the fans.<br /><br />The shame, Gene and Paul, is that you KNOW this, and you don't CARE, because the almighty dollar is the only thing that has ever concerned you.<br /><br />Three stars that should have been five.<br /><br />Follow the example that was set by the Cowardly Lion and the Scarecrow, Paul and Gene...go to the wizard and get a brain and a heart. Stop insulting the fans who PUT YOU ON THE MAP.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|As always, Nicholas Sparks deliveries!  Great story line and ending was great too.  Can't wait for the movie to come out~
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|It works wonderfully in all my devices. It is easy to use too. I recommend it to anyone who needs to take notes and sync them in different devices.
B00A0NOF7G|4.0|Cute story line; easy, fast read!  Love the cozy's for a non-violent, no sex, no crude language read! Anxious to read her other books.
B0091LS07E|5.0|I love how she writes. I love the intricacies she brings to the subject matter. I am enamored with her voice quality and the way she phrases a song. Even her breathing adds to the outcome. Love it, Alicia.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|I LOVE this album. Great follow-up to their first album.  My favorite songs are I Will Wait & Lover of the Light, but the whole album is beautiful.  These are some talented, soulful guys.  Highly recommend!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I am not often as intrigued with a story as I was with this one. Sky is among the most interesting charecters I have come to know in decades. I appreciate the intricacies of her story and the skill of the author to reveal them in a most compelling way.
1579128955|5.0|This book has become a hugely valuable and powerful (and fun!) reference tool for my middle school child who has used it for chemistry, physics and biology.<br /><br />The photos of elements combined with photos of their common uses are a great visual and the elemental characteristics on the side of each page helps simplify comprehension of an element's relationship to other elements.  My child laughs out loud at some of Gray's explainations of each element as they are not only succinct, but often provide a bit of comic relief.<br /><br />We purchased this book about 6 months ago and it is used daily.  The book binding is very low quality which is a little disappointing since the daily wear has broken most of the binding; however the page and graphic quality along with key primary information make this book a real treasure as the entire content provides an exceptional overview of elements.<br /><br />Additional info such as reference to The Elements app (who knew!?) and the tear-out Periodic Table are great little nuggets of added value.
B009HXGD4S|5.0|Right up there with Goonies and Stand By Me for epic childhood movies! Entertaining from start to finish.  Two new stars were born!  Thanks, Wes Anderson!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is very entertaining.  I loved the first temple run, but now I really love this one, very entertaining
B008XCJ03K|5.0|I just found these guys the other day while listening to my Pandora Acct.  I had added Of Monsters and Men, and it added Passenger.  Their lead singer has a higher voice than I am used too, but I absolutely love him!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I have not beat my wifes high score yet but I keep trying. This is a game that makes you think about every move you make, because each move counts towards your final score. It is easy to play and a lot of fun.
B00005N6KG|4.0|Perfect for a good run. Sound is good and they stay on for miles, have used them every other day for months and they are holding up well.
B0058YPL66|5.0|More than we expected. My 15-year old son and I look forward to each episode as it airs. We love this show because of its innocense, an all-too-rare quality in today's television and movie world. I don't have to preview episodes before our children watch the show. I don't cringe while watching it because there's nothing terrible in it. There were a couple of episodes with some remotely suggestive behaviors that very young children wouldn't pick up on - nothing blatant. My son's only problem with it is that some of the Enchanted Forest costumes show too much cleavage. (He believes that such things are meant only to be shared between husband and wife, and he points that out every time he disapproves of someone's costume.) Very little foul language (I could probably count on one hand the number of four-letter words dropped in the first season), excellent moral lessons, and a very well thought out story line. With every episode, the writers put unexpected twists into beloved fairy tales, which often solicit squeals of delight or shocked gasps from viewers. Such a PLEASANT and refreshing change of pace from typical TV drama. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this show, and the DVD has some awesome extras - bloopers, deleted scenes, making of, etc. My son and I both give it two thumbs way up. We recommend this to anyone looking for a good family series to watch.
B008BM9L72|5.0|I have to say eventhough miss James is not the best writer in the world.<br />This is the best trilogy I have ever read I loved Anna Christian and everybody else in the book<br />Whether you want admit or not Christian is the hottest fictional character ever he's Cool he sauve sisphocistated he's rich powerful and I would leave him eat Doritos in my bed<br />The sex isn't for the weak hearted but its damn hot<br />This is porn for women and I'm not ashamed to say I loved it<br />A must read for any red blooded woman the males have had their sources for long enough it's about time us women had something to get us hot under the collar.<br />Thanks miss James for making such a sex god for us women bring on the movie
B0087GZ8YW|5.0|A great read.  Ian Rankin delivered this reader a great journey into Scotland's detective story genre.  And he still has the Saab.  Hope there is more to come.
B008IYR2BA|4.0|Dexter just keeps getting better with every season. Great guest turns from Colin Hanks and Edward James Olmos in this one. Great stuff.
B001V7UXG2|5.0|Possible only for those who know this duo and/or have read the Wodehouse stories.  These episodes are so fabulous I cannot get enough of seeing them.  All the characters, from frivolous young men in the London club, bossy aunts and scheming girl friends - British comedy at its very best.
B001HBYHFA|5.0|I bought it as a gift for my husband, a sci-fi fan. We will both watch it again and again.
B002RSDW80|4.0|Loved this movie.  The timing, the setting and Streep's performance make it a stand out for me.  Maybe more a girlie flick, but definitely one I will watch over and over again.  And I bought the recipe book!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I just had to much gear for my camera bag and needed something bigger! This bag fits the bill nicely! Its nice to be able to bring all my gear into the field with me. For the money, its a good deal!!
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|This was very good and extremely interesting. I would highly recommend this book to everyone. It was hard to put down.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Iv'e read quite a few &#34;proof of God&#34; or &#34;proof of heaven&#34; books.  This one appeals to my scientific nature.  It's a good read. Still don't know if I'd call it &#34;proof&#34; though.
B004I744AS|5.0|cool h j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z a b c d e f
B007SGLZP8|4.0|It was interesting; a little far-fetched, but especially toward the end, a fun read.  For me, it started s-l-o-w, and I didn't much care about the characters, but since I am a huge Grisham fan, I stuck with it, and glad I did.
B003DNH6DK|5.0|A well made and touching story that combines the kindness of friendship with sports. The film is well cast. A must see.
B007HACDLK|4.0|I could like this book a ton more if I could tolerate the offensive language.  One does not have to use offensive language to write a good thriller.  Case in point - John Grisham.
B004ZY0VHY|1.0|I can't believe I watched this movie! After the horrors of Columbine and now Sandy Hook. We wonder where people get these ideas!!! The parents of this child were they so oblivious to his problems?? The mother wasn't but why on earth who she take no action. This was sickening This boy was so screwed up from birth. I can't believe that the parents didn't do anything to help this kind out  he was so sick. It was not so fictional. Sick people get their ideas from videos and murder games. Appalling. The movie was well made but...... Sick and disturbing given the times we are living in now and what's happpening.
B004LROUNG|5.0|I am really a Grisham fan, having read all, or at least, almost all his books.  He writes in such a way as to grab one's attention right away, and then holds it until the end.  I like how the book ended.  In fact, I like how he ends all his books, and am always a bit dismayed when the films made of the books change the endings..
B00B7FXYJG|5.0|Very faithful to the graphic novel source. Excellent for any fan of Frank Miller's book. I wanted to watch on Amazon to see if it was worth owning. It is.
B005CRQ3NY|1.0|I loved this book. Diary of a Wimpy Kid series is my favorite book!!! I recommend this book to all the people who love to read.Special thanks to Jeff Kinney!
B009GEAPYW|5.0|Very faithful to the graphic novel source. Excellent for any fan of Frank Miller's book.  I wanted to watch on Amazon to see if it was worth owning. It is.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is AMAZING its really fun and exciting plus I always go for the gold I mean who doesn't want some cool shoes or new person.
0765325950|5.0|Superbly written although it left a lot of loose ends for a 14th and final volume.  Brandon Sanderson had to write from notes and had many strictures he had to follow from Jordan's wife and the publisher.  There's certainly room fora number of sequels or outriggers which we've been told won't happen.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|it was okay for a reacher novel, but i don't know if it was the barren nebraska landscape or the tedious drives between destinations, that slowed the novel down.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator app is great. It has large numbers, you can see the numbers you entered, and it looks wonderful on the Kindle Fire.  Highly recommended!!
0714864803|5.0|I received this book as a Birthday giftt from my daughter.  When I reviewed some of the areas within the book with my Dad he couldn't believe the vast coverage of so many great & potential meals!  He is 1st generation Lenanese-American and as he pointed out the dishes his Mom made for him I made note of each to make for him.  On his 92nd Birthday!<br /><br />It's a great volume of recipes that reflects why Lenanese cooking is so wonderful to eat and enjoy with family.
B005K17RU0|4.0|It's a good program comparing it to weather bug.  The radars don't match so, I still am not sure just where the rain/snow actually is raining or snowing.  One would think both radar systems would show a similar report,  but not..
B007EECSFA|5.0|Loved The Secret Keeper. Strongly recommend. Couldn't put it down. Read all Kate Morton's books and this was my favorite<br />.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|i hate this game it says that my email's password is nor correct its stupid i tried over and over again but it just kept saying &quot; this password is incorrect&quot; never buy this ever!
B006ZE66P8|3.0|This is a good condensed version of Dickens classic, and the pictures are stunning. Problem is in this format on the Kindle where the text is just part of the picture, it is too small to read. Text needs to be digital.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Cool game for anyone and it is so fun because I cant get this on my ipod 2nd gen.peace people
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I love how JoJo Moyes writes.  I just love this story.  A beautiful love story.  I love Clark's personality, her family dynamics, and how her world becomes so much bigger once she has become involved as caretaker for Matt.  My favorite story in a long long time.  I miss it!
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I LIKED THIS BOOK ALTHOUGH IT GOT A LITTLE SLOW I Would read more from this author I like the style.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I thought the story was really clever.  I really liked it, but felt it carried on a little bit too too much when I was ready for the clincher, or surprise finish to happen.  It seemed as if it stretched out a bit too long.  But I was SO disappointed by the ending!  Very frustrating, to the point that I'm not sure I would recommend this as a top read.  You spend all your time getting carried away by whats happening, to then be let down by the ending.  I was at least.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is very fun and real. There are so many things to do. Competitions are fun but they tire out your horse.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Its a great game and its just like Temple Run but it didn't save my progress after the second time I had played it.  I would sugest getting this but just beware your progress might not be saved.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|Any of these songs could have easily fit into Mumford & Sons' first album, which I loved. I wanted &#34;more&#34; and I got it!
B007FG9LIE|5.0|This book is exciting from the start. Every twist and turn of the book brings you closer and closer to discovery and further and further from reality. A very exciting, action packed, thrill ride!
0765325950|4.0|I don't want to provide spoilers but a story that spans 20 actual years and 14 books should have much more than a 3 page epilogue.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|Keven Bacon is at his best in this series. Well acted throughout and the plot is interesting and hard to predict.
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|Originally I heard a song on Pandora and loved her awesome voice.  I added her to the station and started hearing more of her music and was captivated by them all.  I love her &#34;sadcore&#34; and old school sultry vibe.  Can you say girl crush?!?  LOL
B00004RF8J|5.0|I got it to show to my Grandkids who abolutely love it, they have watched it over and over again, and know all the songs. Thanks
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I like just about everything. Wish  I could earn more gems or lower gem amount. This game is great for all ages.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This is the best way to stay in touch with friends and family and to find long lost friends from your childhood.
B0065RIJ3W|5.0|Very easy to read and all the basics in nice detail. It has encouraged me to dive into a first time project and I'm and have found a fun new hobby!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|It was great. I couldn't take my eyes of the pages! It was very well written, and those who say it's just another Harry Potter/Lord of the Rings story at  wrong. It's an original.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I absolutely love it!!!!!!!  it is better than the first temple run,  although the first temple run is a classic. but I recommend this.. it is a very fun game and its great to pass the time.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|Loved the concept. Easy to maneuver, but these games are never long enough for me. It had me pressing the hint button a couple of times in both the hidden object sections and where to go. I gave it for stars just because of the length of the game.
B00A77II0U|5.0|WOW - this is a SUPERB game! I consider myself fairly adept at these mystery/hidden object games and this one really kept my attention. I NEVER got bored, and it was a wonderful challenge. Graphics are detailed and storyline is engaging - there's a crazy clown with a vendetta on the loose! I think anyone from beginners to experts would enjoy this game.<br /><br />A sequel to this game was just released 8/29/14 (Stray Souls: Stolen Memories) and it is just as spectacular!!
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|i say that this is the perfect movie because it has romance, it has a teddy bear that talks and it has absolute hilariousness and a lot of crude humour which is always a blast. i am very very happy with this movie. if youre considering getting buying or renting. i say go for it. id be carefull letting younger children see it because its got a lot of adult humor in it. but it truly is a great movie.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This is a book on after war or disaster that happened in the world, we do not know. The author is excellent in making you feel  the charaacters,  he is very good in describing in detail what people feel, their surroundings ect...
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love it it is my favorite app I play it non stop I completed it in less than a day I love it soo much
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|I had high hopes for this book.  The story felt forced and contrived taking advantage of serious abusive relationships.  It just leaves me feeling a little offended.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|If you are wanting to buy a new game this is the one to buy .It has been working fine .If your child likes animals they`'ll love this game!!!!!!!!!!!!!:)
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|I hate that u only have fifteen minutes and I really like that game when it said that the trial was over I was so mad
B003O86FMW|5.0|Fantastic read. I read this in one day. Cannot wait for more<br /><br />Thank you for your time in writing this book
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I have been playing this game for several hours now on my PS3 and I can't stop playing! I was so happy to find it is for kindle too that I got it right away. I don't even care that I have to restart!
B000VDUWMC|4.0|I am not quite finished with this book but I can say it really explains, in depth, why people from Europe-Asia ended where we are as top dogs in the world.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I've read all of Nelson De Mille books and every one has been so captivating and exciting.  I always look forward to his next book.  He is one of the best writers that I read.
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|Slow moving movie, I did like it. It's more for the older generation. I've heard that tommy lee jones is a grump in person this movie then he really didn't have to act in.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I have read all his books and they keep getting better & better.  I always look forward to his next writing.  He is one of the best story tellers of our time.
B009VB97EY|2.0|No plot, nothing movie! There's nothing to tell its stupid movie. Matthew looks horrible. Tatum is the only cute part.
B0013ND30M|5.0|My wife and I will give it to our new Grand Daughter for her 1st Birthday, February  28th. In years to come she will be delighted.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I didn't like the &quot;play a bit to get hooked then buy therest of the game&quot; strategy, but it played through better than lost souls.  The little girls' facial expressions andactions were just downright weird though.<br />Good use of hidey holes.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|My wife and I will give it to our Grand Daughter who will be 1 on February 28. Even though she won't understand it now, she will treasure it in the years to come.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like this game. Its so strategic and in a fun way. Its fun when I'm bored out of my mind to play this game.
B007X4ECMI|3.0|Not the movie I thought it was, but I'll keep it and view it when I get tired of other DVD's I own.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Our grandchildren love to play this game. We have to set time limits for each so they can share my phone!
B0062P3392|5.0|I love Jason Statham movies. Keeps me entertained for the duration of his movie. I have other Jason Statham movies also.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|Played piano when young but no room for one in my current home. This app is fun and the music isn't so bad either
B00B0NF4L6|5.0|Kinda old-school punk - Loud, fast, angry, fun, crazy... great. It's like the Strokes went surfing on speed. Alot lyrics about drunk driving through LA. Great album, well worth the dough. Very catchy lyrics and hooks for noobs and classic power for hardcore fans alike.
B00594XOZU|5.0|This app is so cool, the messages send so quickly without any trouble!! 5 stars. (: I would recommend this app to anyone. !!
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I read the reviews about having some font issues when purchasing  the triology.  There were about 10 pages in the middle where the font was a great deal smaller.  I loved the books and it was worth the purchase and price savings to buy the all together
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app, subway surfers, is pretty dang good. It does sometimes glitches but all In all I think that subway sitters is a good app.
B009IJJB8G|5.0|I have no TV. I hate it.<br /><br />This, I love. Watch it on Amazon Prime streaming every weekend. Cry when it's a re-run.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|Excellent, it fits a wonderful array of lenses and cameras, which is always good if like me you like to go out hunting for soemthing but not always knowing what . It will do a great job for most people. The only drawback is that the straps are really short and it feels a little uncomfortable if you're tall. But I still recommend it!.
B001RUXW48|4.0|Ending left something to be desired, unless you like open endings. It was honestly one of the best movies I've seen in a while.
B0066WJLU6|1.0|This app brings up ads for porn on the phone. Do not use this app, surely there are better ones that don't run ads that endanger your phone security. Don't bother with this one!
B0063IH60K|5.0|My husband and I keep this game busy.  So much better on Kindle Fire using the stylus and able to see the colors.  Lots of different solitaire games if you should get tired of the regular one.
B000002G89|5.0|I purchased this CD, 461 Ocean Boulevard [Original recording reissued, Original recording remastered] as I've listened to Eric Clapton for so many years.  I owned it before, but realized it was not to be found in my library of music CDs. Containg the classic, &#34;I shot the Sheriff&#34; and that is reason enough to buy it.  But &#34;Motherless Children, Willy and the Hand Jive, Get Ready and Let it Roll&#34; makes it a necessity to own.  If you are a Clapton Fan, or just want to see how it is done, this CD is well worth the price it goes for these days, less than a down load and you have the CD.  I recommend this Eric Clapton Classic Albumn.
B005OK722U|4.0|If you like the premise of the movies and have enjoyed the series so far, you'll probably find one or two things to smile about in this installment as well. It's not the best film I've seen, but there were a few pleasant surprises which made it worth the viewing.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|A look at the behind the scenes training and planning the went into the raid on Osama and all the details the author was allowed to tell about the raid.
B003Q6D27S|4.0|Here we go again! Essentially...if you like the series, it's worth a viewing, or if you like interesting ways to kill people and are a fan of cheap horror flicks, it's worth a viewing. If you're expecting something incredibly wonderful and unique...go elsewhere.
B00AAQVTD6|5.0|First Zappa album I've bought, and it just blew me away. Even better, the lyrics are not nasty and my kids can listen to it, too. My 8-yr old boy actually requests this album a lot.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Soo much fun love this game. I like how it gets faster and faster. Love to save coins and buy cool characters and boards.
B00992CF6W|5.0|l love minecraft! I usually play this on my Pc,  but the pocket edition has had me hooked lately. they just had a new update, featuring colored sheep, stonecutter, and, wait for it, ...........CLOUDS!
B003UBTX6S|4.0|4.5 Stars<br /><br />Beautiful Darkness picks up immediately after L's 16th birthday. Definitely a must read if you read Beautiful Creatures.  Ethan learns secrets about his mother, which help him realize who he is and what his role is.  As Lena's powers grow stronger she has distanced herself from Ethan and becomes darker.  That doesn't stop Ethan from entering the underground tunnels to find her & her companion.  The plot is a little darker than the first book and I have to admit I missed the magic of Ravenwood & Macon.  I also felt the ending was a bit rushed.  As in the first book you'll be left with unanswered questions that will make you jump right into the next book.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|A great movie. Great actors. Great location! Very enjoyable movie with a very different story line. gives an insight into life for the older generation.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like the part where I have succeeded to the extent that the game is finished for me! I also like the card extravagansa that happens when I win!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book was unbelievable.  Interesting from beginning to end.  Made my viewing of &#34;Zero Dark Thirty&#34; that much better. Recommend it to all.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is so much fun and so interactive. Every turn you think faster and faster. I think anybody reading this should play the game.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love the new graphics and how there is more to the adventure this time around. While the original TR was fun, this version takes the game to a new level!
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Way back when I was in High School and College I LOVED a good science fiction story and this takes me back to the books I used to love.  Good technical adventure with survival on another planet.  The science details are solid and the author has a sense of humor.  For those not into the technical details, this book may not be for you, but I really enjoyed it.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I'm not usually one to by premium versions of free apps, but Relax Melodies Premium is worth it. If you like the free version a lot, then you should consider upgrading. With 90 sounds and music clips to choose from, the ability to blend up to 10 of them at once, as well as control the volume of each sound individually, you are sure to be able to mix a sleep track that is perfect for you.<br /><br />One caveat: you might take 20 minutes or so each night to find your perfect blend for the evening. It's fun to tinker with.
0312600844|5.0|I never thought I could love a book any more than The Corrections, but then Jonathan Franzen came out with Freedom and I couldn't put it down.  I bought it for a trip out to Mexico and figured I'd read it on the plane.  Well I did read it on the plane and then couldn't stop reading it for half of my vacation.  I was unable to put it down and sad when it ended.  GREAT BOOK and FANTASTIC READ!!!!!!
B002UZCJP2|5.0|Scary view into a possible future world with fake humans, all robots, and everyone living fake lives even more fake than it they do today.
B00AHSINKO|5.0|It had some funny scenes and some of it seems to be true for some marriages.  It was a good rental.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is very realistic. I love it! Its easy to understand and you don't really need to buy gems!
B001FQIWSK|5.0|One of the best movies i have ever seen. It is very touching and very sad at some points. Overall, an excellent film for all ages.
B002CLBJPK|5.0|This movie is a great classic that every child should see. It came in great condition and shipped fast. My son loves it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Ok I am speachless this game is awesome it's adicting!! I would recommend this game to anyone. Even my 7-year-old sister plays! She might be better that me.
B0031ES8P6|5.0|I got this for a gift and it is very cute. It is small and perfect for a little girl.
B008XIXWYW|5.0|Every kid in Britain has some part of Status Quo embedded in their DNA. I absolutely loved many of their songs and this DVD does a great job of capturing their history as well as their music.
0979019753|5.0|This journal is not only an amazing way to compliment The Miracle Morning Book, but also a phenomenal accountability system to yourself, that helps you write about your day and to keep you focused on the things you need to get done, dream about or your disappointments.

B00571F26Y|5.0|Full of great information. Mankind is really killing itself by eating crap that is sold as nutritous foods.  Time to wake up and take a stand people.  Get informed.
B000HF0ISC|5.0|To cover such a volital issue and do it so well is extraordinary. Acting and directing were superb. Story line was compelling and kept me in my seat the entire duration of the movie.
B005NJU8PA|1.0|really stupid.  After the hype on Dr. Oz I expected more than information on what knives to buy. What a waste.
B000091N3Y|5.0|The &#34;rebel of the underground&#34; comes with his unforgettable and often overlooked debut. The song that everyone remembers from this album is &#34;Brenda's Got A Baby&#34;, but I have to say there is no lull in this effort. A must have for all 2pac fans.
B007549YM4|1.0|OK,it is a great idea for a movie but it ends and your asking yourself \\"what the heck?\\"There is no explanation for anything thats going on.Who was the government agency?,Why were they taking the children?Too many situations with to many unanswered questions.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|Yes, some of the actors needed more lessons (especially Russell Crowe) but the score is simply incredible.  This is one every music lover MUST have in their collection!
B005LAIIPS|2.0|In a quest to make money they took a character and tried to make a new character and failed.<br />Not even close to the original film and character ----- don't waste you money
B007WFTFG6|4.0|I got this for my daughter. She likes the different pictures and always wants to touch my touch screen products. Although she really only likes to use my finger to paint with for now. I'm sure she'll love more as she gets a little older. Plus this way she can't eat the crayons when she colors!
B00AN0KBJC|1.0|This is the intro and commentary to the second season. Terrible let down. It should say commentary, alas it hadn't.
B005V2S7FW|5.0|This is a great way to save your passwords, fill forms, and if you wish save you CC  info. And the great feature...with on sign in it is available on all your devices. It makes signing in to all your sites on your tablet or mobile phone a breeze! The Best!! Get it, and for $1 a month!!!!! What can you buy for a dollar, and this is for 256 AES security, the same the that the US government uses for top secret comm.
B008QMMEOE|4.0|These were perfect puzzle to entertain my granddaughter one afternoon.  She loved the trains and asks for it when I visit.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|I have been playing this game for a while. I had over one million points but I keep losing my coins and progress and it starts me over! I'm very dissatisfied!!
B000NY12LO|4.0|She makes you think about things and issues that are very relevant to our lives.  It is a page turner!
B004I744AS|5.0|am glad to find this book for my kindle.  its always great to have a good one around. especially for word games.
B00687PWQG|4.0|I had to watch this for my school paper and this particular episode was just what I needed to land a A on the paper!
B004JZBGWI|4.0|Almost no learning curve necessary. Very simple.Easy to find long term notes. Such as, how your wife and kids like their hamburgers, clothes sizes, etc.
1904633153|5.0|I saw many variances of movies but never read the book. It was a true page turner. It left me wondering about Oscar Wilde's state of mind...LOL!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This was a great love story. I couldn't put it down! The right amount of love, romance, and back story!
0762439009|4.0|Really just bought this for the mousepad and mug. Don't know what you're supposed to do with the amputated toe.
1582406634|3.0|The cover is a bit misleading as the inside illustrations are all in black and white.  The fantasy settings of all the models is a bit distracting.
B000WQW988|5.0|The 5.1 mix on this is truly amazing. I remember watching this live the day it came out and being completely enthralled with the performance.  I've had the CD of this since the day of release and have listened to it more times than I can count.  Fast forward to the day I received the DVD and I can honestly say I never really heard the entire performance before.  The mix really brings the performance to life.  Between the cello cutting through the mix in the surrounds to the ringing of the quarter Kirkwood used while playing guitar on the Meat Puppets songs...I was blown away.  I hope everyone enjoys it as much as I did.
B002P79KAC|5.0|We watch a few episodes before bedtime and the laughter and giggles make us sleep better.  Great show and I will probably buy all the seasons.
0446580848|4.0|This book was a gift, but I can't wait to read it too.  If you like Nelson DeMille you're sure to like this one too.
B0037NB6QE|5.0|I really enjoy this book.  The knitting content is just right and the character development of the Friday group is engaging.  I plan to read the rest of the series over time.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|The graphics are fantastic, and the game use very interesting and hands on. The only issue is the waiting time between activities, but of course that is where they get their money impatience.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|So far we are enjoying this.  It's got just enough mystery and backstory to be interested and the storylines are not totally lame.  The fact that John Barrowman is in it is enough to keep me going.
B004GTLFNW|5.0|The is quite a useful exercise bible. The routine seems to really get your body in shape. Hope I do keep at it.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Have never played this game until purchasing my Kindle. I enjoy this game very much and with practice hoping to get better at it.
B006KX3GXO|4.0|I like this app but I used the I love you frame one day and went back a few days later and it was gone :(
B0094BB4TW|5.0|A favorite site of mine and am glad that I now have it on my new Kindle Fire HD.  It's a great way to keep in touch with friends.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This game was a lot of fun! This is one of the best story lines I have come across so far. The only bad thing is that you only get one item every time you do an object find. Other than that, it's super fun!
B001O7JHSE|5.0|Awesome service! They gave me exactly what I wanted when I wanted it. I highly recommend them for sure! - Dan B
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Another great game from this publisher. Puzzles are creative and the game flow was logical. I thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend it as a great adventure game.
B002UNMWAG|5.0|Awesome service! They gave me exactly what I wanted when I wanted it. I highly recommend them for sure! - Dan B
B000059TEQ|4.0|I'm as tough as they come, but even I got choked up over the plot.  I wish I could find a woman to love me as much.
B009O2XY12|3.0|i hope it was going to get better but never did i would continue to work on it and make it better i haven't found it yet
B00001W9G0|4.0|Streisand and Redford make beautiful music together in this movie.  I enjoyed it very much, and I'm a guy.  It's rather prophetic she carries the same liberal beliefs as in the movie,
B00AESN8XY|5.0|although it is hard to beat it is still fun to try and is very callenging. i do enjoy playing it often
B008ELUEQC|5.0|this cd is a great holiday addition to anyone's Christmas collection - especially Rod's rendition of &#34;Baby it's cold outside&#34;.  Wonderful.  This cd would make a great Holiday gift for anyone.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|The game is an immense amount of fun. I only have one complaint. When it updated to Rio, I lost everything I had on there. I still have my score, but my trophies, multiplier, basically all unlocks are gone. That kinda ruined it for me. Nonetheless, its still a great game!
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|Great story, I missed it in theaters and was happy to watch it as a rental on Amazon!<br />Well worth it!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I downloaded both games and enjoy both very much... They are so much fun and very addictive. When you start playing either one its hard to stop..The graffics are great on my kindle fire hd.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|I am greatly 100% satisfied with this purchase of Columbo the complete series. It proved to be a great gift.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I thought this book was really well-written; the story hooked me right away. However, as the story developed, I began not to like the main characters at all. The ending was abrupt and by that point I just wanted it to end. So, overall a good read when on an airplane, but nothing to knock your socks off.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I thought it was going to be exactly like the 1st temple run. but its not at all. its better .now I play it all the time there's more objectives and people..I love this game
B006YTTVHO|5.0|I am a personal trainer and after reading this book, I am totally convinced that of your going to come in close contact with anyone you should start by reading this book! Love it, I must read it again and again, and I think you should to.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I started watching Downton Abbey the 3rd season it was on the air.  I was so intrigued after watching the 1st episode, I purchased both Season One & Two and I am very glad I did! Thank you BBC and Masterpiece Theatre.
B000003N7F|5.0|This album is definitely one of the most terrific ones in the jass history. The sound stucks in your brain and let you fly to an other dimension.<br />Also the quality of this vinyl version is great.<br />Enjoy.
B0053TMP24|5.0|My friend told me to read the lost hero and I loved it so much I just had to read this one too.
B000V7J82S|5.0|I'm very tempted to launch straight into a track by track here, because Bob Marley genuinely needs no introduction. He remains one of the most iconic figures in the history of music, a political icon, Jamaica's most loved son, and reggae's biggest star (by a MASSIVE margin).<br />Released 1984.<br />Tuff Gong Records.<br />#46 on Rolling Stone's Top 500 Albums Of All Time<br /><br />Legend was issued originally in 1984, 3 years after Marley died from cancer. It quickly became the biggest-selling reggae album of all time, and it remains so to this day. Accordingly, the vast majority of the songs here have passed into the public consciousness so completely that you'll be able to sing the chorus to them despite never having knowingly heard them before.<br /><br />This vinyl version has to be in everybody's collection!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I am a 11 year old and to me this game is so like living on a ranch which I do and I've been looking for a game like this forever!  I totally recommend this game to horse lovers!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Ms. Collins brings excellent closure to the trilogy in Mockingjay.  There are surprises and a great twist at the end that I never saw coming.  An excellent read.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Totally  mesmerising. Couldn't' wait to finish it. You get to emerge yourself  into a  completely different world with fantastic(al) characters.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I had heard the hype for this book and movie and resisted caving in for a while.  I wish I hadn't!  I am in my 50's, and although this book is meant for teens I enjoyed it very much.  Ms. Collins creates a world that is all too possible given the greed and avarice permeating today's culture.  This is a greatly entertaining and thought-provoking book.  It left me wondering to which of the Districts I belonged, and hoping it was NOT the Capital.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Never would have guessed that Katniss had to do it all over again. What a heroin!  Very dramatic ending. Leaves you wanting more. Luckily there is more in book three.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I chose Safe Haven because I always enjoy reading Sparks' novels and am never disappointed and always recommend his work to my friends.
B0086700CM|5.0|its a fun and addicting game when you start to play it you don't want to stop.it can get hard at some point and you can get fustrated.
B00979OL5A|4.0|Good graphics, simple game play. Not a bad way to waste an hour. . . . . . . .
0143039482|3.0|A very good story, well written. Not all of a great author's books can be equally great . This book is very good but not as great as Cannery Row, East of Eden, Grapes of Wrath,. or Travels with Charlie.
B0083GR6Y6|3.0|I like adventure and the survival genre, however, this movie was a bit too grizzly for me to consider enjoyable.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I was pregnant most of last year and have only been reading baby books. I asked my best friend who is an avid reader to recommend the first non baby book I should read. She sent me a list a several books with instructions to read The Night Circus first. I adore this book. I became completely immersed in the story. Her writing triggers all five senses. Half way through I thanked her and then wrote to another friend of mine suggesting she read it as well. It took me away to a magical band beautiful place. Well done.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THIS.  MISSED EPISODES WHEN DISH DISCONTINUED NETWORK.  I GAVE THIS TO MY SON FOR CHRISTMAS.  HE GOT ME HOOKED ON IT.
0307959856|4.0|I suppose I shouldn't admit it, but I liked this fascinating spin-off (to borrow a TV concept) from Pride and Prejudice more than Jane Austen's classic novel.  The original cast of characters is back but this time they are involved in real drama, a murder, rather than the social misadventures with which they were concerned when we first met them.  Is the wrong person accused?  Is the verdict on the accused guilty or innocent?  Is there punishment for the crime?  I like that it's left for the reader to decide.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|CHRISTMAS GIFT FOR MY SON.  CAN'T WAIT TO SEE IT MY SELF.  MISSED SO MANY EPISODES WHEN DISH DIDN'T CARRY NETWORK.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|This is my favorite show. It's the only one I watch. I am watching all the previous seasons too g. Great cast
1878424114|5.0|Each day there is a law one can contemplate and apply to one's life. Take time each day to meditate and experience a new way of thinking and feeling. Joy and peace will follow.
B002TRL87Q|5.0|Still the premier jam band they were before. The newest studio to date, can't wait till they put another one together.
B000AOEMXM|5.0|I really enjoyed Star Trek Enterprise but I didn't get to see all the episodes and so this was a perfect way to see all of the seasons at a great price.  Wonderful!
B0090OW7J4|5.0|Had to get it, nobody does it like John Hiatt. He is still the American story teller of our times.
B00701L5XS|5.0|this is quite a useful app for learning knots, the ability yo watch it being tied along with the ability to be able to rotate the views makes learning the knots so much easier than learning from a book.
B001NLKT60|4.0|After reading The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo I was hooked.  This book seemed to drag a little more in the beginning.  The cast of characters I found hard  to keep straight at times.  Once the story started though it was  fast paced and keep you reading.  I am looking forward to starting the final book in the trilogy.
B002ZG9968|5.0|I like anything with Alex O'Loughlin in it - been addicted to this guy since his stint on Moonlight - watched all of those shows and got the DVD when it was over - saw his next series, where he was a Doctor, short lived - now I'm into Hawaii Five-0, of course, AND I'd forgotten about this movie until a friend mentioned it - bought the DVD and loved the story - sweet - and great pairing up the two of them.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I would recommend this to play with friends. I tried to play with random opponents and most write the word across their drawings. It defeats the point of the game.
B001NTFQRY|5.0|Do we design machines to help us perform or to perform for us?  If a machine performs for us, when does it become us.  The music is haunting.  The languages polyglot.  The album makes me think, question and hear the fine melodies, harmonies and the sadness of realizing Harrison Ford is in love with a machine.
B0015DROBO|4.0|A little slow to get in to at first but so worth it. Keep reading it gets better.  Will look for more titles from this author in the future.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|This was a birthday present for my husband.  It arrived in time and he is waiting to get the time to watch it.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Lisbeth is vindicated of all. Stieg Larsson was a master at writing. It's a shame he only left three books behind for all of us to enjoy and no more to come. Fabulous read!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this game.  Been playing with the kids.  We are hooked.  Fast fun and furious. Would recommend to friends and family.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|A good movie to watch about folk's ability to reform and regrow. A small group of seniors decide independently that a change culture might be the best way to retire.
B009LXEBD4|4.0|This was a birthday gift from my sister and it's awesome!  I rocked out to it so much I broke out in a sweat!  The ballads helped cool me down from the great workout of jumping around/dancing.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This game is addictive.Whether one has an hour tp play or only a few minutes, it is still a lot of fun.
B001I5M9SC|5.0|Great album if you love opera.  This combination of Andrea and Sarah is a much have.  Thank you again. I am enjoying it.
0451232852|4.0|I did enjoy reading and understanding all the aspects of WW I.  I hated History in school, but Ken Follett makes it so interesting by interacting it into this novel that you can hardly put it down. It just goes to show you that the heads of Countries are not necessarily the smartest people in the world. Its scary to think they control so many life's. And I'm sure it still goes on today.
B00138CYD4|5.0|This is a great bargain for $5.00!  Except for 2 tracks this is nice for easy listening and I also like this CD because of the various vocalists Santana chose for this album.  He  is one of my newly rediscovered favorites, thanks to the bargain price offered.
B008CP6RWU|3.0|I really liked playing this game but i was a little dissapointed with the short amount of play time(I think it took about 4 hours from start to finish and I even did a section over).  I guess i may have had too high of expectations from reading some of the other reviews.  I can see how people said that its more of an experience than a game, so maybe i was too focused on the main objective.  In my opinion this is a good game and i did like the story but i don't think it is worth the 30 dollars.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is s book for everyone. 15 - 100 in age<br />One minute you see ancient Rome, the next Natzi Germany, when suddenly you recognize our own future. You won't stop reading until you are finished with the final book.
B000LB7G00|5.0|Works great, and a good price. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone. I will definitely use this product again
B009GEAPYW|4.0|Batman has been done and redone so many times. This film contained familiar villains, but didn't feature them. I still enjoyed it very much!
0805092447|5.0|I bought this book for my niece. This is what she wanted for her birthday i bought it for her. Its a very simple and cute book
B0039N74CW|4.0|Item arrived ok n on good confition...<br />No complaints here.<br />Item arrived ok n on good confition...<br />No complaints here
B004SIIBGU|4.0|i thought it was a little ironic to download an ebay app from an amazon store, but it does its purpose and supplies me with my ebay account and what not.
B00992CF6W|4.0|is there ever a nightime? I would like to see some monsters. and I cant ever use the crafting tables/furnaces.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|Good App.  Works good on Google TV slick. Download was quick. Very pleased. Great Job. Could use a little tweaking but overall good.  Thank you .
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think that &quot;My Horse&quot; Is a 5/5 star game because it is a really fun game and it can teach your kids to take care of things
B004SRNH10|5.0|Good App.  Works good on Google TV slick. Download was quick. Very pleased. Great Job. Could use a little tweaking but overall good.  Thank you .
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|Bought for my son-in-law as a gift.  Although I have not seen this movie, he says he has watched it several times since Christmas and is very happy.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Good App.  Works good on Google TV slick. Download was quick. Very pleased. Great Job. Could use a little tweaking but overall good.  Thank you .
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Reading on my tablet is perfect with the free downloaded version of Kindle. I downloaded the kindle to all my computers and laptops.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|I couldn't put this down. What an amazing story - I went through every emotion over and over.  It was a six tissue finish!  Beautiful!!
B009PK9SB8|5.0|Works great.  It's nice to have a view of what your recording or about to record.  It makes working through the settings much easier.  I do recommend removing it when not needed as it WILL make the Hero3's life even shorter than is already if left in use.
B003UBTX7C|5.0|kept me on the edge of my seat...couldnt put it down til i finished it  even took it to work with me
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this book. I loved Abby,Travis,America and Shep. Even Finch :) Amazing characters! Amazing story! I can't wait for Walking Disaster :) Travis is totally my new book boyfriend lol
B00APJLFEG|5.0|I viewed this film with my family and it was great! A good story and a good twist on the usual monster themed movies. I thought the whole team of people that worked on it did an amazing job. I only rented this from Amazon, but I will be sure to add it to my digital library in the future!
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|My granddaughter put this on my kindle she loves it I did not play it yet but if she likes it so will I
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Rented this movie through amazon instant video and I was not disappointed.  A wonderful movie and download time was exceptionally fast.  Pleased all around.
B0015HOFZI|3.0|I played a record it sounded great.<br />I have not had enough time to get the software in the computer yet.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Amazing. I'm not crazy about the vocabulary and some phrases are overused, but the story is phenomenal. Definitely one to read again.
086571701X|5.0|I read it several times. And have designed a flow-through aquaponics system that goes from stream to waterfall to large pond with talapia to 15 ft. diameter basin 5 ft. deep to two 40 ft. concrete channels 1 ft. deep and 2.5 ft. wide filled with soft crushed rock back to stream. Thus no pumping is needed, and no pH required.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I just discovered DA this month and have watched all episodes up to current time; the story is wickedly entertaining, the time is critical, the characters live, die (some surprisingly!) and grow and change. Beautiful; beautifully filmed, gorgeous clothes and settings; all with a gripping sense of reality and diplacement. My favorite show this year.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|They always keep you hanging on the edge of your seat, the seem to run almost in order no matter which one you pick
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This games a little different from most which is a good thing. It's not a duplicate of the same concept, thumbs up!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My little brother, my little sister, and I can sit around the house and just play this game. Subway surfer is a game you can and probably will get addicted to! :)
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book is probably the most empowering book I have ever read. If I had to choose my favorite book wonder would be it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is a great thing to play when you are very very very bored!!!!!!! But great game I guess!
B00008G7UF|4.0|This was a great movie from the minute it started until a possibly predictable but still entertaining ending.  Of course Meg Ryan's performance was perfect, never over-acted, always quirky, adorable and funny, and her interaction with Kevin Kline was irresistible.  I just gave a copy of this movie to a friend of mine who was scheduled to visit but was terrified to fly, immediately remembering Meg Ryan's role in this movie and the funny ways she got over her phobia.  Good movie to own.<br /><br />Jennifer A. Slater<br />Author, \\"En Route Baby: What You Need to Know<br />  In Case Baby Arrives Before Help Does\\"<br />[...]
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I bubblegummydrop think this game is awesome.<br />When I grow up I want to be a vet researcher ,this game inspired me about my future I want to thank everyone who helped make this wonderful game.<br />Love a faithful number 1 admirer who LOVE's this game.
B003EI2EH2|2.0|I found this book an interesting read, but I found it hard to understand. When I spoke with people around me, all were skeptical and few would read it.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|Add me I need friends asap this game is great and sooo fun yay please add me I have no friends I'm new
B00122G00Y|5.0|The Arctoc Monkeys are by far my Favorite Band. My favorite track off this album would have to be Fluorescent Adolescent; with Teddy Picker as a close second.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Very enjoyable. Couldn't put it down once i started. Will read more of her books. Enjoy my Kindle books too.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|I love being able to carry my music everywhere I go without buy the same songs two or three times. This is an easy way to put songs onto multiple portable devices, and maintain them for long periods of time. You also don't have to buy the same tracks for each device which is convient.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Good morning, thanks for the sale of the product, but I require Submit Product bill, I hope for your quick response, good buy.
B000E1155E|5.0|My favorite song, is Mardy Bum. I love to listen to the Arctic Monkeys all the time. They have a great beat, and Alex has a nice voice. My favorite thing is the history behind the band though!
B002PEP4U0|5.0|This is the story of how a human spirit and ingenuity can stay alive in the midst of terrible poverty, hunger and political corruption.  I read it together with my son.  The story made us cry and rejoice.  All our American children need to read and appreciate how things can be in the rest of the world.
B00003CXQY|5.0|I love this movie, as does a friend of mine and I wanted to<br />get her a special edition of this movie! Thanks!
B009IJJB8G|5.0|I had my doubts about this show and the pilot left little to be desired, but after that I was hooked. The episodes get better and better every time.
078885996X|5.0|Anything with the muppets, I I absolutely love!<br />I also really like the Christmas season and that mixed<br />with the Muppets is just great! Thank you!
B005KELWJY|2.0|I gave it two stars because it would serve its purpose--hold the Kindle Paperwhite.  However, it is very cheaply made.  I purchased one from another company a few years ago for my original Kindle and it was much more substantial.  I don't feel this one will last very long and is definitely not worth anywhere near the selling price.  I'm sending it back....even though I have to pay return shipping!!
B004JZBGWI|4.0|This is a really good way to keep up with things you need to remember, shopping lists, birthdays, and so on.<br />Would be great if it had a reminder alarm
1451695195|1.0|How can anyone see this book as anything but the marriage of current American christian theology to an arrogant neurosurgeon's insecurities about having been \\"given up\\" for adoption?<br /><br />If your brain was dead, good doctor, how on earth were those parts required for memory functional enough for you to actually remember any if it? Granted, the bizarre explanations of the place with the girl and the butterflies is as vapid as it gets. It isn't even good fiction. And the girl turns out to be his dead sister? Good grief.<br /><br />Eben is convinced he's made the greatest discovered in history, that he was chosen to go deeper than most claimants of NDE.<br /><br />What we've learned here is that one who knows how to cut a brain is not cut out to tell us how it actually works.<br /><br />Pure rubbish. This is a tragedy for humankind and deserves only ridicule.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Everyone is playing Angry Birds so I tried it and it really is addicting.<br />It does drain the battery pretty fast though.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game I just do lol I just want to play it all the time<br />Lol lol lol lol
B007REV4YI|5.0|im a big james bond fan and wanted to add skyfall to my movie collection and watch it when i want.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Excellent series, can hardly wait to get the fourth Version. Love the wonderful humorous dialogs etc.<br />Renate<br />PS: Have problems to write proper in English since it is not my natural language.
B00APJLFEG|3.0|I found this movie to be enjoyable. Though I think it had potential to be much better than it is.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun and realistic game that will keep you entertained.  The graphics are pretty and I really like the unicorns. And, it's free!
B008YWY0HK|5.0|This has a great storyline! My kids love the movie also! I think they've watched it at least 50 times in the last couple of weeks!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I chose this rating because this book is very interesting. I liked this book very much!I recommend this book to all readers.
B005MSD75U|2.0|I really like Kevin James, but this movie was awful.  We did not even finish watching it.  Would not recommend.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Awesome book of you're into the zombies craze takes you on the eyes of the different countries during a zombie  outbreak
0385535147|3.0|Not one of Grisham's best.  It was o.k., but wouldn't recommend buying it.  Get it at the library to read but don't buy.
B00683JK9K|4.0|Beautiful pictures and music. Seems more like doing a real puzzle than most apps. All the same thought processes with the convenience of great piece sorting. Same slightly annoying issues as other reviewers - a Pc can end up under the puzzle (developer should make loose Pcs remain on top), a Pc can go missing (just toggle the straight edge Pc icon on and off and poof there it is), and some Pcs won't drag out of the column storage so I have to swipe quickly. Needs a few bugs fixed but has been a good relaxing several hours. In a lot of ways better than a real puzzle.
141659521X|4.0|Enjoyed this book.  Have been reading Vince Flynn books about a year now and have enjoyed them all.  Can't go wrong with a Vince Flynn.  Looking forward to the next one.
B00B5HQL50|5.0|This is by far the best Bond I've seen.  Brilliant writing, directing, and acting.  The characters and scenes are believable.  The action scenes were much more realistically-shot.  The lines and interactions were clever.  The characters have real depth.  This is the first one that was self-aware in a cool way.<br /><br />It's the first contemporary Bond.  I was a huge fan of the first two Bourne movies, and I like this guy better.<br />This one, for me, legitimizes the rest of them.  Living in the future just got that much more awesome.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I play this CD over and over.  Such a great voice.  You can feel the emotion in her singing.  Would reccmmend to buy this CD.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|awesome I totally luv it u should totally get it its the bestest game ever I luv it I luv to play it
B005H0IW6W|3.0|Liked a few songs, but didn't like most.  Wouldn't recommend someone buy it unless they were big Buble fan.  I perfer more traditional songs for Christmas and these aren't it.
1451695195|4.0|This books will make you think a bit.  I enjoy hearing about various NDE's but as with anything metaphysical there is no &#34;empirical proof&#34; of such events.  I choose to be religious and these stories appeal to me but I could understand a skeptic being unconvinced.  I have seen the author interviewed on several programs and he seems to be a very rational guy and I do not question whether he had these experiences as he states.  I enjoyed the fact that he described the experiences as &#34;more real&#34; than living in his normal reality.  When you get to questions of reality, our experience of reality is always a subjective experience.
B002QEXN2K|3.0|Enjoy several to the songs on this C.D.  There were a couple I could have done without.  But, all and all I'm happy with the purchase.
B00A4FOWYQ|5.0|Every t&s album I own, Sainthood and prior, can be played from beginning to end, multiple times, without skipping any songs, and I have yet to become tired of them. This album, Heartthrob, is no different. After listening to them for almost two decades, I have yet to be disappointed!
B0071MV540|4.0|This movie was very enjoyable.  Was very entertaining to watch, and I can't say that about too many movies anymore.  Would recommend for a light, entertaining movie night.
B0051OZ564|5.0|The more I think about this movie, the more I love it. The story was so beautifully written and the ending tied up all story lines. I also loved the music so much that I bought the soundtrack. WATCH THIS MOVIE!
B000P2A24W|5.0|Really like the songs on this CD.  Would recommend to anyone to buy.  Couple of the songs I play over and over.
B000V39KDO|5.0|I watched this movie on my Kindle during an international flight. This was such a welcomed surprise! The story was incredible, special effects were perfect, and must I mention Gerard Butler's stunning physique? Ooh la la. ;)
B006LSZECO|3.0|I really enjoyed reading this novel  It's very well thought out.  A woman disappears from her home, and her husband is under suspicion.  The book starts by being alternately told from her diary and his present day perspective.  We learn more about both of them, and it's fun putting their portraits together.  SPOILER ALERT - If you haven't read the book, read no more of this review.  I was really disappointed by the ending.  The woman has masterminded everything, outthought the police and the husband ends up staying with her solely because she's pregnant and he wants to protect the child from her.  I thought for sure that the police would come up with something, some mistake she made and be able to arrest her.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|OMG!! This book is AMAZING!! The plot, the characters, well, everything is absolutely perfect! I read it in one week! LOVE IT!
B00B7FXYJG|4.0|Fun adaptation of the novel.  Excellent joker.  Weller was a good choice for an older Batman. Made fun of Superman...like the novel.
B0087DFIYA|5.0|This could very well be one of the most underrated movies of all time! It's arguably the best action movie of 2012, if not a close second. I would give this movie 6 stars if I could! Great movie! Anyone that gives this movie less than 4 stars is obviously still mad about the voice mail's Mel Gibson left his ex, get over it already.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Love it!  Never want it to end. One of the best series we have watched. All the characters are so well played
B0080SZ0V8|3.0|I really wanted to give Azada five stars.  I also have Azada game for the PC.  Azada is one of my favorite puzzler games. Yes you do some puzzles over again  but  they change in difficultly.  So it doesn't seem like you are doing the same puzzle.  For example towers they add more rings.  Onto the bugs.  I have  a Kindle HD.  I have a problem in Ch 9. In the balancing act, only half the stones show up.  Then there was a problem with the tilt.  I saved my orbs for the tilt puzzle.  I installed the game twice and played twice.<br />I would like to finish it though.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I do love to play this game but it keeps starting me back over.  it will freeze up then when I log back on it starts me over. this is the second time this has happened in a week.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|I don't think my review would be helpful due to my predigious. I love all of his movies and lets be honest theirs certain actors/actoress that you know if they're in a movie it must be good. That's why they make the big bucks!!!
B006M4F67A|5.0|I really like this version. The tiles are fairly clear making it easier to see the different designs. My eyes are not what they used to be so I appreciate that very much! There is also quite a bit of variety in the games. Great app.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I loved it.  I can't wait until I can get season 3. The quality was excellent as the acting, scenery and subject.  I didn't find any gaps, long pauses or freezing in the viewing of the programs.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I have a kindle fire. This is a wonderful app exempting the fact that this may have trouble at start up. opening it from the app page helped
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|The show is very clever and put together in a manner that will always have you on the edge of your seat and always wanting more! The plot line is brilliant, the actors are magnificent, and the twists are always very tastefully incorporated  making this show all around a must-see
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is one of the greatest games out there. I play on my Kindle Fire and it works great. Controls are easy and this is so much better than Temple Run.
B005IQZB14|2.0|Overall, a d ed c ed by read but slow and somewhat boring at tines. I was expecting more of a personal t transformation!
0545265355|5.0|I purchased this item for my daughter for Christmas. Very nice looking box set, I can't comment on the books as I have not read them. However if you are looking for a nice looking set this is the one.
B001PU8N0I|5.0|This its a great story. I have not read the book, but it must be fabulous! All of the characters are so well portrayed. The acting is superb, as you would expect from a literary classic. The twists and turns in the plot are so interesting and captivating. I watch it over and over. If you like Dowton Abbey or Great Expectations, you would like this.
B001UC09ZS|5.0|Anyone who has a open mind and truly believes will enjoy reading this exciting book. You will find it hard to put down once you start reading it.
1118156307|4.0|I'm reading this text for my design class. I think the content is relevant and interesting. There could be more stories that illustrate concepts. I also enjoy the font, the icons and diagrams. The concept of having multiple authors across many disciplines to pull together the concepts of service design is brilliant.<br /><br />But as far as using the design process to design a book, I find it lacking:<br />1. The cover of the book holds fingerprints (so immediately I feel like the book looks dirty).<br />2. The book won't stay open with one hand or lay flat until you start to really force the binding open.<br />3. There are no chapter numbers (it makes it difficult to find your place or reference what you're talking about to fellow classmates.<br />4. Sometimes a word is cut into half and the sentence completed on the next page but not for spacial reasons (there was half a page left blank). Seems like for no reason other than playing around with a new style of word-hyphenation. It was interesting to me, but made the extraction of knowledge more difficult.<br />5. The pictures in the book are duo-tone (so when looking at a design picture, you can't get the full impression of it). It also makes the text seem dated.<br />6. The book uses a TON of white space. Now this could be useful for massive note-takers. But I honestly think it's a bit more than necessary. It makes me feel like the book could be lighter if they didn't waste as many trees.<br />7. The width of the book is ok, but as a soft-cover, makes it harder to hold.<br />8. It doesn't come in kindle format (which makes heavy books easier to read, and makes it easier to highlight/take notes and share with classmates). :(<br /><br />I'm mostly providing this feedback so that the designers of the book can think about redesigning a few elements of future editions. I would hate for the design of the book to get in the way of the valuable information.
1439181780|5.0|Bought for sister last xmas and she loved the book.  She gets into all these self help books.  Thanks much
B00136JQMI|5.0|If you're getting this then this review will not persuade you to get this album because obviously you already know that this is one the greatest albums of all time.<br />Miles Davis on trumpet, John Coltrane and Cannonball Adderly on sax, Bill Evans on piano, Jimmy Cobb on drums & Paul Chambers on bass, what else could you ask for?
1582701709|5.0|I bought this book for my sister last xmas.  She loved it and still talks about it today.  Great gift
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Read it. That's it. The book was absolutely phenomenal. I was glued to my screen the entire time. Too good. Andy Weir is an amazing author and I hope to read more novels and short stories by him.
B009GED3HS|3.0|Started out as a good show but its lost its momentum, alas time to meet the mother that no one cares about & bring this show to a suitable close. There should have been more \\"clues\\" about the mom, like when we saw her feet or umbrella, so we don't forget what his stories are leading us to.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is crazy fun with the fact that it updates all the time.  I hope you like it!<br /><br />Ugh/
B00B3MN65K|5.0|His best album yet in my opinion.  Just love it and have recommended it to others who love Josh Groban.
B007N6EUHI|5.0|I use this product daily now in my Orthopedic practice for patient education.  Thanks<br />for a terrific product.  This was suggested to me by a student
B00B1MJ02K|5.0|Love all of Andrea Bocelli's CD's.  Most definitely recommend it to anyone who loves this type of music.  The love songs<br />are absolutely beautiful, as well as his voice.
B009GED3HS|5.0|This show continues to be very enjoyable and humorous. We have watched it since season one and still look forward to each week's episodes.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I have a couple of news apps that are okay but the weather section is a bit vague. So, I saw the weather channel app and thought I'd give it a try. The weather channel is one of the best free apps I've used. No force advertisements, no spotty or faulty graphics. Just a good look at the weather, which is what I wanted. You can put in any location and get radar, maps, forecast graphics as well as the climate conditions. Videos, sharing icons...very good freebie.
B009YP9L7U|1.0|Predictable. Easy read but boring.  Too much sex and not enough story. Character background non-existent. The fact that it was free is the only thing that saves it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Read this for a book club.  There was a wide range of opinion - some of us really liked it, and others thought it appalling because of an cruel self-centered central character, but we couldn't stop talking about it.<br /><br />And that's the key to this - there is enough moral uncertainty, combined with an amazing series of plot twists that it is both a page flipper and a book that makes you think.<br /><br />I won't recap the plot, as so many have already done, but will mention that in addition to the main story, there is a great deal of social commentary about contemporary society that seems spot on.  Yet it is just woven into the thoughts of the main characters, so that only as you find yourself thinking about the comments later that you realize how skillfully they are woven in.
B006YM9JSW|5.0|all very well and very fast excellent I recommend all you world I love very much my product I'm enjoying it to the fullest thanks friend
B005EHILV4|1.0|Needed a cheap phantom power/audio interface for my microphone and this looked like everything I needed. I read some reviews that said it added some slight white noise, which is fine for my purposes.<br /><br />The amount of white noise this thing adds makes it pretty much unusable. Maybe I have it set up wrong, or I don't have my computer configured right because the audio quality is absolute trash. My built in PC microphone sounds so much better than my AKG perception microphone running through this hunk of junk, and thats sad.<br /><br />Lesson learned, cheap isn't always the way to go.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Very engaging book at times, I found myself skipping over some of the more mundane chapters to get back to the story line, especially the Waterloo chapters.  All in all I now know why I never finished reading it as a teenager, This is a book that takes discipline to read to the end :)
B00A0SJWQU|3.0|Slightly entertaining, but don't expect anything new or, outside of the chases, &#34;Jason Bourne&#34; like in this one; if you arent really into this type of si-fi action movie, you might take a pass
B009FOBZL0|5.0|I have always thought that &#34;Red Letter Days&#34; was their crowning achievement that anything else would inevitably be downhill from there.<br /><br />But I was (thankfully) wrong.  This album equals and even exceeds that one in some ways.  I am thoroughly enjoying it.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the Wallflowers, you must get this album.  It is truly outstanding!
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|Unique time travel based action; very enjoyable if you just try to enjoy it for what it is - entertainment.  I do wish it had made the viewer think deeper, but it simply isn't that kind of movie.  Good delivery by actors helps, but doesn't quite close the story line which seems to be cut short and void of detail; again very simplified storyline made into a movie; could have done a better job with more time and effort
B003UBTX6S|3.0|I'm going to be honest, one of my friend's already warned me about the book, but I decided to finish it anyway. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great either. I felt like this should have been Book 2.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|This was a great book. A page turner from the start. Probably took me only 2-3 days to read it and that is just because the only time I can read it is when I am working out. She does a great job at really developing the characters and you can really imagine what they look like. The twists and turns of the book always have you guessing and when I thought I had it figured out I didn't, not till the last few pages. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars, was because there were some parts that just dragged a little bit.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Love Love Love the 3rd book! I wish there were 3 more books waiting to be read after \\"Mockingjay!\\"  I was totally submerged into the story! A Must Read book series!!! =)
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I liked it reading again.  Read it yrs ago. Looking forward to movie. Fun read. Loved it. Go ahead rread it

B00AHTYI5M|5.0|I have never seen any of the previous films Ben Affleck made as a director, but if this movie is any indication, then I should. A masterful job telling an incredible story that I (among many other people) never even knew about. It's an incredible story. One that many would assume was Hollywood fiction because it's so crazy. But it's real, and it makes for one heck of a movie.<br /><br />\\"Argo\\" takes place between 1979/1980, and deals with the Iranian hostage crisis. When the American embassy is stormed, 52 Americans were taken hostage, but six lucky ones were able to escape. They find a safe haven in the home of the canadian ambassador (played by Victor Garber). An amazing scheme is concocted between the CIA and Hollywood to get the six out and back to America. Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) is sent in to get the 6 safely out, posing as a Canadian film crew who were just in town to scout locations for a fake up and coming science fiction movie called 'Argo'. Mendez gets the help from Film Producer Lester (Alan Arkin), and make-up man John Chambers (John Goodman).<br /><br />I didn't know this story previous to the movie, so I am not going to pretend I know all the history or what they got right or got wrong. Although, one senses that the breathtaking climax with the plane may of been 'Hollywood'. Still, what we have here is a great film. Even if you already knew the story, knew how it ends, it doesn't make the movie any less suspenseful, tense, and entertaining. That's the mark of good writing and direction, both of which is exceptional. As director, Affleck solidly sets up the situation and lets the tension build. You are as tense as they are on the screen. Like I said, I haven't seen Affleck's past directorial efforts, so I can't compare his directing or style here. I just know that he shows immense skill behind the camera, and that I will be interested in seeing where he goes from here.<br /><br />Cast-wise, this is a good one and there is great work here. Even thoughthis is a real showcase for Affleck as a filmmaker, his cast runs circles around him. Affleck (taller, thinner, and better looking than the real Mendez. Hollywood!) is there to get the proceedings going. Nothing splashy. However, his Hollywood partners, Alan Arkin and John Goodman, steal the show and every scene they are in. I would go see a movie with just those two characters in 70s-80s Hollywood. They are perfectly cast in their roles and Arkin is deserving of his Oscar nomination. Bryan Cranston is very good (and Oscar-worthy in my opinion). The movie has a number of appearances from familiar faces - Adrienne Barbeau, Kyle Chandler, Bob Gunton, Philip Baker Hall, and Tate Donovan as one of the six hostages. This really feels more like an ensemble piece than a Ben Affleck starring vehicle, and everyone here shines.<br /><br />\\"Argo\\" gets the detail of the era down well too. The clothing, hair, etc. I personally loved the detail of Affleck's sons room. The posters and action figures. It wonderfully cuts in real footage of the crisis as well as vintage news clips. It's a hoot seeing a young Tom Brokaw, Ted Koppell and others.<br /><br />The movie is just sensational. Normally, I see these big Oscar movies after the fact. I'm glad I saw this one before the show. \\"Argo\\" is great filmmaking that is deserving of every accolade it gets. Not only is it suspenseful, dramatic and tense, but it is also genuinely funny in places too. It's a movie that is both hailed by critics and general movie going audiences alike and Oscar. Those don't come too often anymore. It's a winner all the way around.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Subway Surfers is kind of Boring, but If you have nothing else to do then that's the game. It's just like Temple Run 2, except it's less involved.

B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I like Adobe they make it easy to download pdf files for offline reading  I am moving to.eugene Oregon an  was able to.download the bus schedules right to my Kindle FIRE HD
B00782O7NE|5.0|I had never seen a silent movie before(it's mostly silent). It is a great movie and such a departure from so many bombastic motion pictures of today. Great story, great acting, great score! It ricly deserved all the awards it received.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|I like the panorama an  camcorder features and clear pictures. The interface is a little plain but it has all.you need that Amazon didn't put in
B003Y5H542|4.0|I went into this not expecting much. But I was pleasantly surprised. Johnny Depp leads a great cast, and I loved the homage to the old west. Hans Zimmer proved his versatility once again with a tip of the cap to Ennio Morricone. It may be a little grusome at the start for those with young kids, but overall a very enjoyable family movie.
1933952806|5.0|This instructional book &#34;Mastering the Nikon D7000&#34; written by Darrell Young was very helpful to me. This book is very detailed and very easy to follow when used in conjunction with your camera in hand. Although I did read through the Users Manual that accompanied the D7000 when purchased, I found this book gave more detailed information on almost every aspect of the camera's functions. Give this book a try, you will not be disappointed.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|Being a longtime fan of rush(30 years)I have followed them through all different phases. And I believe this album will go down as one of their best. A daring move, since albums seem to be a thing of the past. But it works. The songs are strong on their own, but form a cohesive hole that is more than the sum of it's parts. When all is said and done, this should be mentioned in the same breath as 2112 and Moving Pictures.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|if you like stories where love overcomes a childhood of unspeakable horrors you will like this, i couldn't put it down.
0515149489|2.0|Nora Roberts is known for her good romance writhing yet this book was lacking of a good ending.<br />Story has potential but is not carried out.<br />I expected much more from the book.
B00AFROVQC|3.0|The author had a good plot, even though formulaic (Cinderfellah becomes wizard-warrior-king). The problem is the execution, which is weak. Contradictory statements, grandiose claims (e.g., a hall in the castle that holds 'thousands' of people), loosing grip on reality, etc. And the big one is the sketchy coverage of the plot: This so-called triology is actually a single, standard length novel when it should (for this plot) actually have been a trilogy. The first book (Quest for Heroes) was 300+ plus pages. The second (March of Kings) is half that. I suppose the 3rd volume will be a short story? In all, $9.00 for a readable book that is too sketchy to be fulfilling to the plot. Worth buying if you know what you're getting into.<br /><br />Morgan Rice did, however, a complete job on the marketing of his book, with the usual initial 'rave review' posts and the teaser first volume the best in the series.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|LOVE this series. It keeps you on the edge of your seat. Claire Danes is more than superb in this series!
B002BWQ6H6|5.0|Beautifully written.  I felt uplifted and lost some cynicism for the world by the end.  Thank you Mr. McCann, I will read more of your books.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|This is a truly amazingly well acted movie by Denzel and the entire cast.  How true this might be is not my place to discuss as this is just a commentary on the movie.  A truly real topic and it just shows that no matter how &#34;right&#34; you were in the time of crisis, even saving hundreds of lives in the process - you can still be very wrong as well.<br /><br />That is the focus of this movie the humanity of Denzel's characters situation.  He did an amazing job staying calm, and never panicking like the co-pilot.  His level of experience and gut instinct about all aspects of how an aircraft works, the physics of aerodynamics, etc. These skills he possessed saved nearly all of the lives on his flight, but he was totally wrong at the core.<br /><br />Very moving, and something really to think about not only regarding Pilots, but all professionals in charge with the care of safety of other people's lives.  Like a Surgeon, Policeman, and our Government if you wish to expand this movies concept beyond just one person to an entire body of people charged with the same mandate.
B008P1EWIM|4.0|I would like it if it also showed moon phases/sunrise and sunset also.  but the letters/numbers are the right size for viewing.
B001239NDO|5.0|I am a huge fan of the Harry Potter films and books. The music really helps make the movie. The music takes me back to wonderful scenes in the movie. Love it!
0142420891|4.0|***IF YOU HAVEN'T READ THE FIRST BOOK IN THE SERIES, THERE WILL BE SPOILERS AHEAD***<br /><br />Rating: 4<br /><br />The Low Down: Adam Wilde is a wreck. He should be happier than he's been in his whole life - his band, Shooting Star, is huge; he's in L.A. dating a gorgeous actress; he's living the dream. But truth be told, he never got over Mia. After an amazing recovery, she gets to attend Juilliard just like she always wanted to. Adam didn't figure that he'd never see her again.<br /><br />Turning his pain into gold, Adam writes some of the best songs ever. At first, the adulation, the awards, the crowds, the groupies - they're all great. Then once the novelty wears off, he is again confronted with emptiness. He's short tempered, anxious, fighting with his band. He can't wait for the latest tour to be over so he can hole up somewhere and ignore everyone.<br /><br />Then three years later, fate intervenes while he is finishing up some work in the New York City. Will Adam finally get a chance to find out why Mia walked away so he can finally move on?<br /><br />Best Thang `Bout It: I love that this Part 2 is told in Adam's voice. This has to be his story, since he is the one left brokenhearted and alone. There can't be just a couple of paragraphs about how devastated he was/is; it has to permeate the story so we can understand how he's gotten to where he is today (both career-wise and personally).<br /><br />True to the original book, this one is also told with many flashbacks. That brings the two volumes together even though they are different stories. I said in my review for If I Stay that \\"Adam is the best soon-to-be-a-rock-star boyfriend ever found in print.\\" I still stand by those words. This is a person who went through something horrible in the first book only to think he got through the worst of it. He made a request and found that he could not live with the outcome.<br /><br />As for Mia, she is not the baddie in this tale; far from it. She has a lot of questions herself and has to live with being the survivor when she wasn't even completely sold on surviving in the first place. The most important question now is: does she want to survive or live?<br /><br />I just love the writing style. It quietly fills your heart and lungs and tear ducts and soul and takes up residence. Since this time it's in Adam's voice, the tenor changes and he speaks like a guy would speak. (I mean man). It definitely makes it more realistic.<br /><br />I'm Just Sayin': Maybe I steeled myself for this one, but I think it was only a 3 tissue book this time around. I know the story is over, and really, it could have gone either way. It's not really decided until the very end...and you know it's the right decision.<br /><br />To Read or Not To Read: There's real-time angst and closure, flashback happiness and devastation. And you know you need closure. So get on it.<br /><br />Where She Went by Gayle Forman was published April 5, 2011 by Dutton Juvenile.<br /><br />Genre: New Adult Fiction Contemporary Romance Series<br />Ages: 14 and up<br />You Might Want to Know: Mild profanityestions herself and has to live with being the survivor when she wasn't even completely sold on surviving in the first place.

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I have a lot of fun playing this game very addictive and cute.  Power ups keep you playing longer and very cool prizes.
B0041B785Y|5.0|Meshuggah played \\"Break Those Bones Whose Sinews Gave It Motion\\" live (supporting Devin Townsend) and announced that their new album was only weeks away, I couldn't wait and was richly rewarded with Koloss.<br /><br />It's a cohesive album (an odd term to use, considering the initial feeling of chaos one has when first listening to Meshuggah) that I find myself listening to from start to finish, no skipping tracks here (repeat plays of Demiurge) and my album highlight for 2012.<br /><br />This is what you create when you choose to make music over money (See Sam Dunn's interview with Tomas Haake), and for that I am very happy!
140053271X|5.0|Everything about this purchase was perfect!  Arrived on time and product was as described. Would do business whit them again.

B0084U0IEG|4.0|I read this for book club and was not the one who selected it.  I had loved Atonement and was hopefull that this book would be as good.  I finished Sweet Tooth wishing I could recommend it to my friends.  That is not the case.  It wasn't a bad book but it was not one I would want to read again or recommend.
0446585041|5.0|Impossible not to smile and laugh aloud while reading this book. Ellen is inspirational and hilarious. This book instantly put me in a better mood.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This book really took me back to being a teenager in the 80s.  All I can say is, and perhaps this is the biggest complement I can think of right now as I write this in the dead of the night (could not put the book down) I wish I had written it.  Kudos Ernest!
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|So scary! I had my friend over and he went AHHHHHHHHHHHHG!! So funny to see people get freaking scared, awesome

B0098VYCCE|3.0|A good adaption of the Snow White story. Great visuals.Captivating story. Wonderful acting except for Kristen Stewart. She portrays Snow White as she did Bella in the Twilight series and this just does not work for this movie. I would not purchase the movie but it's okay to rent for a one time viewing.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|this is so fun it is great on get kindle fire now we got to get the pigs to fly
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I had seen the movie previous to reading the book.  I found the way the Ms Collins unfolded the story was incredible.  I could not wait to have time to curl up and read this book.  I will be reading book 2 next.
B006LSZECO|2.0|It's not what I thought it was going to be!  I got very tired of going back and forth between the two characters and then the story line began to drag.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is amazing! I love everything about this game. Caring for the virtual horses is very time consuming and entertaing. It's great for children and doesn't get boring too fast. It works great on the Kindle Fire, and the graphics are great.
