B008JFUPOY|5.0|This prequel to Monsters Inc (2001) is brilliant! The story of how Mike & Sulley become best friends is very, very clever. I wish I could share my favorite moments, but if you haven't seen it or Monsters Inc, I don't want to give away the story ;) PIXAR creates a rich environment that will surprise you with something new you didn't see the time before. The bonus features are fantastic, taking a detailed look at story, character design, creating the campus, and animation. After seeing Monsters U at the theater, I couldn't wait to see it again; I am very happy to have this in my Disney collection!
B0016J81B4|4.0|No ventilation. Get kinda hot. I wear 10.5, ordered the 10. Fit perfect. True story.... Received in mail, put on my feet, drove to party. Got drunk, woke up 5am, drank a beer and hit the road. cops pulled me over, and got the works for DUI tests. Before I walked the line I threw on the strap of these Crocs. Bam... Completed the test and was set free. These crocs saved me from a DUI. nice fit.
0393064476|5.0|The (used) book I ordered arrived well within the expected delivery time and was in better condition than I anticipated. Of course, the book has an interesting story with great historical tidbits and an important universal, philosophical message.
0142410322|5.0|Classic - wonderful book.There is a reason it is a classic (and has two movies made from it). It was great when I was a kid, and still great for my kids.
B00DQZQSNO|5.0|It is perfect!!! I love the design and cost. I was not about to spend 60 plus dollars on a cover! This one provides protection and a nice stand. Still has access to all the buttons and plug ins too.<br /><br />This definitely only fits the NEW generation kindle fire hd 7'' I have both generations.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This game is so much fun and very addicting! I don't want to stop playing! Can't wait until I get play again tomorrow.
0486283577|5.0|This is a marvelous book with beautiful patterns. Takes a little math and some ability to see flat sections turning into 3D shapes. But it really helps you to understand how these dresses and gowns are made. Very excited to get it and anxious to work on something wonderful.
B000BYCAJE|5.0|Takes you back to the day, recording is superior to the album  I still have, price was  great, shipping flawless, i'm  making my  wife  upset singing with it though!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book more than any words can describe. Honestly I have to say that I was afraid of read of reading it, since my friends have told me what the hunger games actually was. I didn't think I would like it but it wad by far one of the best books that I have read. It took me less than a day to finish. I couldn't put the book down!
B00AQN09G6|5.0|This set works just fine on our BluRay player.  Sound and picture quality are good and the packaging is just fine.  The only issue we've had is the difficult-to-read highlighted menu options.  Thank you to the reviewer who mentioned that it was hard to distinguish the change from blue to black.  Once we read that, it became apparent which was highlighted.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Overall this book was worth the read. after reading Gone Girl (highly recommended) I wanted to read more book from Gillian. Sharp Objects did not pull me in right off the bat but it did slowly keep me curious with each turn. The ending was abrupt, in a good way. Characters developed at a good pace as well.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game offers many levels with just enough challenges to make it fun and difficult without feeling hopeless.  I have tried several different versions without as much success.  I enjoy having to think and having the satisfaction of solving the puzzle for my efforts.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|this game is so addicting and awesome I freaking love this ap its so hd and awesomess and and yea
B009NF54ZE|3.0|This game is a good game, however, the dialogue is a little slow and boring. I would like to see the dialogue more meaningful to the game.
B00GINENG0|4.0|The My talking Tom app is better than the talking Angala the only problem is when Tom has to take a rest it takes to long and when Tom has go to the bathroom the music really and poop sounds yuck but the whisling is okay. But he is so cute!!!!!
B009LDCXNY|5.0|I wanted the season and it meant expectations. I purchased it when the price came down.<br />I look forward to 9 when the price comes down.
B00846F1YW|4.0|Interesting, frustrated, feel like a dummy at times, but LOVE IT. I recommend this game to us old-heads who can't find our own glasses. It makes you think. Utilizing all aspects of your brain . Putting pieces of small pictures together is fun for puzzle people. Started a week ago and it is addictive.
B0081336FO|5.0|I have always liked Sherlock Holmes stories.  These are like Sherlock Holmes is alive, and well and living in the present.  The stories have been tweaked a little, and Sherlock and Watson make use of all of the modern day tools to solve their cases.  It's great!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|You get to buy guns. You get to upgrade your guns. It is free . It is cool. You have to get it.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|David Tennant is an amazing actor and the story line keeps you guessing until the end. Well worth the watch.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Aice game kepps me entertained for hours my little girl loves this two specially when she bumps into things good purchase
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Game is fun and addictive<br />Fell into it right from the beginning. Enjoy this type of game to keep my mind occupied.
B00BAXFAOW|3.0|Started Strong then bogged down, slid sideways, circled back and ended short. This nonfiction book was like a novel with a great opening that slows down, treads water, then has a weak ending. I was hoping for a new invigorated section when I hit then end.
B00EF1PKJQ|5.0|Not as good as her previous releases but you just gotta love Sarah. Buy it buy it buy it today!
B00000JXVK|5.0|Still a wonderful movie after all these years. My little boy sits glued to it! We have watched this a good dozen times and it still comes across as well today as it did when released.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|We added this to our tv, and i really love how easy it is to use. We already have a tv with netflix and hulu as an option. We also have a computer and a ps3 hooked up.  Yet this is my go to for netflix and hulu. Why, it is so much easier to use the apps on my ipad or galaxy s3 to find and play what i want to watch. Plus, they just keep adding to this. HBO is now available. I am just waiting for amazon to allow its video app to work with this great little device.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I absolutely love this game. its so addicting. I love this game so so so so so so so so so much.  I want a minion!!!
B005UVQFWQ|5.0|It Is Our Life Purpose To Discover Our Life Purpose!<br /><br />One of the best books EVER!<br /><br />Pictures make it fun to read!
B00701L5XS|5.0|I've been teaching one of my nephews and my daughter how to tie knots for scouting and camping.  This is a great app for that task.  It shows the knots as they are tied, in motion.  The diagrams can be slowed or rotated to make even tricky knots easy to follow.  Updates add new knots, meaning that the app provides new challenges, too.
1250029465|4.0|I enjoyed the book.  Bob is indeed an amazing kitty, and James' relationship with him made for a fun afternoon's read.  It's no classic though, so don't expect a lot of depth.
B001FL88AC|4.0|Captain Beefheart's work is rocking, bluesy, and experimental.  There are a lot of surprises on this album, from the classic road blues syncopation of &#34;Sho 'nuff 'n' yes I do&#34; to the garage rock of &#34;Zig Zag Wanderer&#34; to the doo wop of &#34;I'm Glad&#34; to the pseudo-Tuvan Throat singing of &#34;Electricity&#34;... and that is just the first couple of tracks.  Check this album out.  You won't be disappointed.
B0046B3QTG|5.0|Loved all the characters and the adult humor kept me interested. Also,I've created minions beanbag game for my grandbaby so needed reference.
B008BDZP3K|5.0|Zappa at his most experimental.  Zappa trying to make serious contributions to music.  Zappa challenging the listener.  Great stuff.  Only one vocal track (&#34;Willie the Pimp&#34;) but that's OK.  The instrumental tracks more than make up for it.
B009POCG5Y|5.0|My wife and I have viewed this movie repeatedly. Needless to say we are big Clint Eastwood fans. Amy Adams and Justin Timberlake have not disappointed either.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|Amazing. Just finished it last night and it was like the white whale, too big to really see in totality or take in from one read. Moby Dick is one of the novels it reminded me of; also Faust. A quick scan of the reviews finds everyone using the term &#34;Dickensian&#34; ... I remember thinking it was distinctly anti-Dickensian but in hindsight I can see some comparison in the themes and brilliant evocation of characters. But, seriously, Dickens should be so good. Another book it reminded me of is The Goldbug Variations - the pathos of helplessly responding to beauty in all its forms, even when it's stippled into horribly ugly experiences - the twilit sky in Las Vegas; the tapestry in the drug den; the cheating girlfriend &#34;adorably&#34; asking for help reaching down wine glasses. Maybe Sartre has a place here too, the ache of being moved by what is beautiful inside a life that is meaningless and painful: the masterpiece in the blasted museum, the gorgeous bird chained and unable to fly. And worse, to embody that same paradox within oneself, the power and sympathy and heart of one of God's angels trapped in a human existence in which pain so often generates not art but cruelty and destruction and desperate self-interest.<br /><br />It's that big. And that good.
B0029QRA1U|4.0|this received four stars because it was missing the cord and the installation cd. Other than that, it performs as expected
B000000OU0|4.0|I actually saw the Eagles on this tour and it was amazing.  I am not sure why I waited almost 20 years to buy the CD, but I ordered it from Amazon this week.  The sound quality is great.  The new songs are pretty good, but not like the best of the 1970s heyday.  The version of Hotel California, with dual Mexican guitars, is amazing.  I like that In The City is included to showcase Joe Walsh,and the song sounds great.  The renditions of other hits like Take It Easy (a favorite since 1973) are also great and do not stray excessively from original recordings.  If they included more classic songs, including the all acoustic portions of these shows, I would rate this a five-star.  This should have been a 2-CD set.
B00BATG18K|5.0|Amy Tan never ceases to amaze. I couldn't put this down until the very last page.  Ms. Tan has a style of writing that  takes you through emotional journey not just of the characters but your own ... I love love love reading anything she writes!
0316227706|5.0|This book is just adorable. There's really nothing more I can say. A perfect coffee table, restroom or guest bedroom book.
B008JFUPFI|5.0|First off my saying zack snyder, chris nolan and david goyer  with those name making a movie no one can go wrong.  Now  I found this movie  quite enjoyable. Henry cavill was a good choice he definitely fills the roll.<br /><br />this was done in a whole new approach  I glad they did not do the kryptonite thing for it is getting old<br /> this movie does the same pace as batman begins you don't show the super hero yet you show the man from within who makes his own decisions based on what he was taught in the home. Diane lane and Kevin Costner were good as his parents.  the story is done very intelligently.<br /><br />Now for the action it is nothing but intense  as well as heart pumping  antje trave who plays faora ul zod's  female companion is awesome at total destruction .<br /><br />and the final battle with zod  leaves a destruction bigger than the avengers movie and keep in of this is only with 2 people fighting.<br /><br />The damage is done on such a larger scale one would find it kind of Michel bay ish  but you could not call it over the top for these are people from krypton and we all know when they come to our would and the fight each other  THINGS GET BROKEN  but the fights are done perfectly like cheering a rocky movie .<br /><br />Another interesting thing is in one scene when faora ul  fights superman in smallville she destroys a tanker truck belonging to LEXCORP  and in the final battle with zod a satellite  with the logo of WAYNETECH was totaled so we know what to expect for the next films<br /><br />There maybe lots of people who are so over zealous of the movie but if the take the time and give this fantastic cast a chance I'm sure they would enjoy just the same .  Hey when they picked Christian bale for the new batman films  I did not know him just heard of him from American psycho  which I did not see  I thought ok they're going to make the new batman crazy but after owning all 3 movies I was so wrong .<br />if you are for the true spirit of  KalEL  and what he stand for this movie is for you<br /><br />And my personal opinion I think ben alffack will be an interesting batman as long as Snyder goyer Nolan are steering this ship the journey will be nothing short of greatness
0316044695|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Read it in 2 days. Great story. If this book doesn't inspire you,nothing will. This is a must read.
B005K17RU0|5.0|The app is a wonderful tool. I use it before I go to work. It has yet to let me down when it comes to the accuracy of the weather in my area.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This is by far, my most favored and valued book. There is an underlying mystery that only a circus can give a dreamer and a writer can give their reader. This book is my favorite because there is not just one story a reader can follow but a multitude that are woven together to create this work of magic.<br /><br />It is about a circus and it's origins. It is about a challenge that binds to people with rules that are unknown to the players. It is about those affected by the circus both observers and those apart of the circus. It is about drama and magic and charms and fate.<br /><br />I can only hope the next reader can love it as much as I do.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|This is my favorite TV show right now.  If you like historical dramas, give it a whirl.  :o) :o) :o)
B004GHNIRK|4.0|I found this book difficult to begin with as it's been translated from French to English. However, after skipping copious pages of French history, the story came together for me and I finished up enjoying it very much. A somewhat weighty tome which would have been so much better without page upon page of totally irrelevant (to me) French history but I loved the story.
B0077ATSSQ|5.0|It was a realistic movie.  It brought back memories of what happened at 911 however you could see it point of view.
B005LMEB8E|4.0|Great come back album.  My daughter loves it, evident by wailing every song at the top of her lungs which is making me regret my purchase as no room in the house in which she is playing this song in is sound proof.  Love my kid but she doesn't sound like Demi.  Must have for every tween to teen girl.
B0099114WO|3.0|It was ok. I disagreed with some of the counselling given.  The movie tells a story of many married couples caught up in every day living but not paying attention to their marriage.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|Get it, own it.  Must have for any person that's a true music lover.  Bruno has everything on this lp that is reminiscent of r&b stars past.  His soulful songs of regret to upbeat jaunty mixes are catchy and will remain a mainstay on any playlist.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is way better than temple run I hate temple run and all the others like temple run except for minion rush
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|I found the name of your book by searching for best books for entrepreneurs.  After a while of you mentioning The Daily Method, I thought that sounded familiar.  I stumbled onto your blog six months ago and found that printout.  I posted it in my cubicle.  Never did any of those things but felt comfort looking at it every day knowing someone gets it.  After reading this book I will start.  Thank you
B008Y212PI|5.0|Great game, lots of fun figuring out the levels. Very challenging. Got it for fr highly recommended. ee and I keep coming back.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|THE STORY IS WONDERFUL AND THE ACTORS ARE PERFECT FOR THEIR PARTS. It brings that period in our history to life.
B00GCE3TCE|5.0|I read quite a bit and I know that this will always be one of my absolutely favorite books ever.  So very well written!  thank you!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|an easy read since the writing style is uniquely fluid. the book is written from an unusual perspective of an unexpected character.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It's fun to play, but I feel like I am missing information that would make it an even better experience. It's a trial and error setting rather than having more explanation on how to play, what the different things mean/what they do.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I love this series! It's beautifully done. Thank you for an excellent show. Haven't send a show this good since Anne of Green Gables
B00GBCMW9S|4.0|Impressive, but Lacks Character<br /><br />In a recent Rolling Stone interview, Eminem mentioned that he would love to have released an album that was purely technical, but was obviously never going to happen.  It needed hooks, songs, etc..  He also referenced 2Pac and Biggie as technical rappers who were also able to write stories, not just rap songs.  It's clear that was Em's goal for MMLP2, but it falls short when compared to Em's previous efforts.  It's clearly a showcase of his technical ability and he dominates the landscape with that in and of itself.  But to name it after the infamous MMLP, it sets up unrealistic expectations that are bound to disappoint.  I remember walking and driving around to the MMLP and grinning ear to ear about the cleverness, intelligence and outright hilarity that Em would deliver...not to mention his technical ability to boot.  This record, while packed with amazing rhymes and catchy hooks, feels somewhat contrived.<br /><br />I feel the listener is a bit misled by the first and second tracks.  Bad Guy and Parking Lot feel like this is truly a sequel to MMLP, a concept album complete with the story telling and skits.  But after these tracks, the album more or less degrades into sporadic radio quality hits.  That's not to say that they aren't good songs, they are...but they lack the luster of Em's sharp wit and clever rhymes.  Rap God is clearly the album's showcase and is really a better name for the album overall, as it really demonstrates what Em was seemingly trying to prove with this album.  He's an INCREDIBLE rapper and this 7 minute showcase of his talents can make anyone sit back and respect his borderline genius level of rhymes and flow, but in the end, it lacks substance beyond just being a fun ride.<br /><br />MMLP2 seemed to feel like a publicity stunt and Em even hints to it himself in the intro track of Bad Guy.  And while it's not ever going to live up to it's predecessor, it's still head and shoulders above previousreleases and gives hope that Em still has a ton of talent yet to be released.  Let's just hope the next one is a fusion of both his talents and his creativity, rather than focused on just trying to prove he's a legendary part of rap history.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun to play.  Eventual success on each level.  Don't particularly being time penalized before being able to continue to play
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Firstly, I'm very suspicious as to why book three has the exact same amount of reviews that book one has.  Book two's numbers don't change, so it can't be math done by tricky calculating from buying the entire trilogy, then breaking down the numbers....so what's going on? I have a real problem with people fudging numbers.  Anyways, so why have nearly 70,000 people read this crap?<br /><br />They haven't.  Not really.<br />They purchased it out of idle curiosity, because they heard there was kinky sex.  Most, skimmed through it, just to get to the sex parts.<br />then, they either laughed their asses off, or thought their lives were seriously missing something and mama never told them about THIS!<br /><br />Sex sells.  Even the most unrealistic, fiction sex.  Sex that would never happen in real life, because it's physically impossible as described here.<br /><br />I laughed.  Quite a bit at the multiple orgasms.  The orgasms that happened over and over and over and over and over and (sigh), over and over and over and over and over again.<br /><br />That was the funniest part.<br /><br />Here's what you have...<br /><br />An overweight, not so attractive writer,  who decides to write a book about a fantasy life that would never happen to her.<br />It's not mean, just true.<br />Many overweight writers, decide to self-publish books loaded with pretend sex that makes the young main character appear desirable in every way to the dashing tall stud, usually over six feet tall, with some type of messy bed head hair that falls over his brow when he moves and looks at you with either piercing intense blu, green, blue-green, or chocolate brown eyes.<br />His muscles will probably bulge at the seams and you'll be the only woman he can look at, because you're spunky, gorgeous and tasty all in one amazing package.<br />In this case as well, he's a pilot, a gazillionaire and can leap tall buildings in a single bound.  All in his very early 20's.  Truly spectacular.<br />Living vicariously through the stories you write, surround by cats.<br /><br />Too bad the main chick in this farce is a bloody moron however.  Ana is also an American, with the entire story taking place in the states, while everything was written in british terms, slangs and phrases.<br />Lol<br /><br />Not once, did an editor EVER enter the picture.  I don't care how many unhappy females buy this crap because they're curious.<br /><br />NO ONE should ever pay for an unedited sloppy book.  Ever.<br /><br />Then, Hollywood comes calling, thinking it would be a good movie.  No.<br />No name actors played the roles and again, some were curious enough to watch.<br />This writer got lucky.  She wont again.ariously through the stories you write, surround by cats.<br /><br />Too bad the main chick in this farce is a bloody moron however.

The fact that a movie is being made from this has nothing to do with the book itself.<br />They saw a chance to make money and went for it.  I don't see the movie doing well at all.  Don Johnson's daughter.  Seriously?<br />I can already see this as not big budget, but even so, flop or not, it helped this authors career (I would think).<br /><br />Skip this read however.  It's insanely ridiculous.
B00902AKK4|1.0|Would not quit playing sound when game was exited. Even after shutting the Kindle down and restarting it the game was still running the sound. Luckily  removing the game resolved the problem. And no I haven't reinstalled the game again.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|it a good soap opera from another world.  all of the stars were amazing.  I liked the gossip, I like Shirley McClain, and the way that they all are just laid back, and doing nothing because they are rich.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|I love this game. It is so addictive. More is added as you progress through the levels so it constantly challenges.
B0031RS2XG|4.0|Excllent book. Maybe the last chapters are a bit more of the same, and it could have been included in any of the previous. However, is one of the few books I can say it actually deliver, with good research and practical examples you can apply to whatever your field is.
0061950726|5.0|I bought a book to read at lunch during the work week.  That idea went out the window because I couldn't put this book down & ended up reading it in two nights.  The story line was just so touching & I love the fact that the author went back in time to give readers insight into an era that may have been unknown to them.  A brillianat book, definitely one that I will pass on to my daughter who I know will love it as well.  I am off to shop for another book by this author.
B008VVT51U|5.0|I love, love LOVE this movie.  It is my favorite movie.  The first time I saw it I loved it so much that I saw it again on the same day!<br />I disagree with the review that says this movie is great for those who are 60+.  I'm in my late 20's.  Yes most of the cast are late in years, but a great film is a great film regardless of the age of the audience.  Fantastic script, fantastic acting, funny, touching and uplifting.  This is a movie no one should miss.
B00GHJ6BJW|5.0|Getting back into music in my dotage and L. Gaga is just the singer to do it with.  Waiting for her and Tony Bennett's jazz album--Loved her duet with him on his album.  Artpop is fun, upbeat and alive!
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I leave notes on my app all the time helps me to not forget things, tis the season to be
B005M68S4W|5.0|Heard T.B. interviewed on Howard Stern and bought the albums.  The duets are really wonderful.  Gave CD's to my ancient mother who also enjoys them.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This app is great and i play it in my spare time. I recommend for people who like fighting games
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have bought alot of cheap books that are exactly what  you pay for, a cheap horribly put together story with poor character development  but that isn't what you get here!! This is well written and VERY entertaining! I was hooked and drawn into this horrible world, which I have to say made me talk to my kindle at times! Can't wait for the other two books, I will load them immediately after I write this review!! Which is now!!!!!
B0091WNK8M|5.0|Such a great classic.  My children would watch this movie over and over when they were small and still love it today.
B00FAVRHBE|5.0|This could have gone so very wrong. There are so many elements that shouldn't have worked, but in the end the Doctor's 50th anniversary was a rousing success. I'm going to start this review off by saying that I will offer no spoilers beyond the confirmation that, quite regrettably, Christopher Eccleston does not appear in Day of the Doctor. It is disappointing but thankfully Smith, Hurt, Piper, and Tennant more than make up for his absence.<br /><br />A phone call from U.N.I.T. sets off a fascinating chain of events that eventually brings 11, 10, and the Warrior together. The action is fast, the story is fun, the Doctors are an absolute joy to watch, and by the end of the special, the series will be headed in a bold new direction. There are several other surprise appearances that I will absolutely not spoil. Suffice to say that fans, new and old, will be very, very happy with them.<br /><br />This special was as close to perfect, without Eccleston, as it could get, though I do wish the villains were a little more threatening, though that is nothing more than a nitpick. Smith and Tennant are simply marvelous together, and John Hurt only makes them more fun to watch. All in all, The Day of the Doctor is a fantastic tale that no Whovian should miss.
B000002952|5.0|Great singer, great songs. Sad that she's so involved in the tragedy of Cuban-American politics and thinks taking Cuba back to the days before Fidel would be a good thing.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|When I first started the series I didn't expect much but I fell in love with it and the characters. I felt like I was living it. Best series I've read in a long time!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I really loved this game until it uninstalls on me every time a new location in the game updates (like London). All my money and upgrades, along with my boards and characters disappear. At some points, it's just not worth it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a Great game and I recommend it to anyone who wants to challenge themselves in an extraordinary way.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I love this it's like a mixture of temple run and street suffer plus who  doesn't love the minions. I really enjoyed try his game.
B008JFUPFI|5.0|Re-boot, re-suit, whatever...whenever you can address modern day times by re-tooling an icon like Superman with a face and a body to match (OMGoodness) after 30+ years--so be it! I have watched this movie three times within the past two days and plan on gift-giving it to others this Christmas, whether they saw it in the cinema or not. I'm impressed with the concept of everyman having a &#34;soul&#34;...Superman included!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love this game! I play it more than anything else. Some levels are harder than others though. I've almost rage quit a few times
0156027321|4.0|Piscine Molitor Patel, better known as Pi,  is your normal child growing up in 1970's India.  There are a few things that set Pi apart though.  One is that he is being raised in a Zoo.  His parents own a successful zoo in India and Pi's play mates as a child were the young monkeys, lions, and other animals of the zoo. Another thing that sets Pi apart from other children his age is that he has a unique approach to the religions that he encounters.  Instead of picking just one, he embraces all of them.  This of course baffles his peers and mentors and causes his parent's much exasperation, but Pi presses on and eventually finds ways to follow his beliefs.<br /><br />Other than that Pi is pretty much a normal kid, trying to understand his world and trying to find where he fits in it.<br /><br />His world changes one day when his father decides it is time for his family to leave the rapidly changing India and move off to far away and exotic Canada.  The animals are sold and traded, the house and circus are sold and Pi's family boards a boat with the animals that are going the same way they are, to North America.  The voyage is an adventure to a boy that has never before been on a boat or had much interaction with the sea.<br /><br />One night, Pi is awakened by an explosion and in a blur of events he finds himself adrift, in a life boat,  on the Pacific ocean with his only company being a few wounded circus animals and a Bengal tiger known as Richard Parker.  Soon it is only Pi and Parker.<br /><br />The sea and the tiger, both unforgiving in their own way.  One is tamable and one is not.  This is the story of the will to survive and how Pi Patel and Richard Parker find a kind of peace.<br /><br />*-**-*<br /><br />This was a different kind of book than I normally read, but I'm glad I picked it up. I usually avoid books like this, especially ones that get made into movies, since I've found they tend to be over rated or they were written to end up being made into moviesby some weird stroke of luck.  On the other hand I've found that if the movie was horrible, then the book was probably different in some way and that \\"different\\" got lost in translation when the movie was made. In this case I haven't seen the movie so I can't comment on that, I just have the feeling that this might be one of those lost in translation cases.<br /><br />In a way this reminded me of a couple of other books I have read, Boys Life by Robert McCammon and The Bottoms by  Joe R. Lansdale, by the way it looks at how people cope /  survive  with events that most likely should have had them rocking in a corner somewhere.  To those being told the story later the events may seem fantastical and outlandish, but to those that were there they will swear that was what happened.  In some cases this is because they have no explanation for what really happened and in others it's because what really happened is hard to live with. In some cases it's a mixture of both.  This is one of those stories that brings up a lot of the heavy subjects about reality, faith, and surviving. For the most part the reader isn't beat over the head with these subjects, it's mostly about a boy trying to survive at sea with a animal that he can barley control.<br /><br />I recommend this to anyone who likes adventure /  drama stories and to those who like books like the Shack, that take a little different look at why we see things the way we do.<br /><br />-m.a.c
1476729085|5.0|I loved every word of this novel.  The  Asperger's &#34;voice&#34; is alternately hilarious and touching.  It's the kind of offbeat love story that has tremendous appeal.  Ought to be an award-winner and a best-seller.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|What can I say about Supernatural? The boys rock! The things they get involved in are always on the edge of your chair action, or some really good belly laughs.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Terrific history told in story format. Character driven story keeps the ball rolling through history. Magnificent settings enhance each scene. Can't wait for Season Two in 2014. Travis Fimmel is a new guy to watch.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Marvelous story I didn't want Pendergast to go to that depth but it worked.  Wonderful wonderful writing!  Another HUGE hit for Preston and Child!!!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I'm a pretty heavy internet media user. Our house has PCs, Macs, iPhones and iPads. We cut cable 2 years ago and each TV has a Roku and the big one also has an Apple TV. I use them all, but this is the one I end up using the most. Casting video that I come across while using my iPad or laptop is just so much easier with the Chromecast. No menus to navigate on the device itself, just send it from what you are already using. I'm surprised how much better I like that.
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|Saw this in the a movie theater as part of the live broadcast. Was great. Could have only been better if I could have been there. Was disappointed that the chandelier didn't 'fall'. The finale was awesome. If your a fan of Phantom this is a must have.
B000KJT8IG|5.0|Can't watch it often enough!  We have pretty much memorized the dialogue and watch it several times during the holidays!
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Its fun and doesnt have as long of a wait for actions to be done as some of the other similar games.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I won't spoil this for anyone. I felt Allegiant was a great conclusion for this series. I wraps up all loose threads that were left hanging after Insurgent. If you have read Divergent and Insurgent, I highly recommend finishing up the series with Allegiant. If you haven't read any of the series, I suggest you do so.
B00CS7ZIHI|5.0|I have only recently discovered 30 Seconds to Mars and I can say honestly I haven't yet disliked anything they have recorded so far. This recent album is amazing!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This has changed the way we watch t.v.  We cast off the kindle onto the large t.v. for my 5 year old.  Now he can watch his shows easily on the big screen while mom and dad control what he watches.  We have 2 of these.  I can't brag on it enough.  My husband even bought one for work at elementary school and casts his surfing for the students to easily follow.  Amazing product.  Easy to set up and use.  Now if Amazon Prime would support it, it would be perfect.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|such a talented young artist her music is beautiful and upbeat. This album is awesome, I would suggest her music to anyone who is sick of the same old same old!
B00DXPC1U6|5.0|I have no idea why people didn't like the series ending.  Without giving a spoiler, if you follow the plotline, it makes perfect sense and gives a great ending to a fun series.  Frankly, I thought the writing was a step up from the previous season.
B00GHJ6BJW|5.0|such a great album! lives up to its name and fan fair, a little bit oo everything with this album Love Lady gaga
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I can easily understand why these books are being made into movies. The characters are not perfect. The situations could occur, unfortunately. People seem all too willing to accept even terrible things when the rationale is well designed. I would prefer to believe we would never let things like the hunger games develop in our world, but then I read the news. We allow bad things now. Maybe not that terrible, but bad.<br />I bet much of the technology in the books already exists. I know people like these characters exist. So, we must be vigilant!<br />Be sure to allow time to continue reading: you won't want to stop.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So excited that candy crush is now available on my kindle. I love this game.  It's so addicting.  Now I have another reason to pick up the kindle.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My 10-year old son has not stopped playing this since we purchased it!  His friends even love helping him go around the 'set' of MineCraft!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I hate the annoying beep beep beep of normal Alan clocks, so the range of alarm sounds, and your music as options is perfect.  You can set it to repeat certain days and can control the alarm very well, I love it and have been only using this for my alarm for almost six months.
B00AEBB8YW|5.0|When shy and non-confident Sabrina goes to Pairs for a summer job, she comes back a strong and beautiful woman and bound to catch people's attention. Especially of her all time crush, David. Problem is David is engaged to married someone else who's rich and will help his family business get even richer. So to stop David from breaking off his engagement and to save the million dollars deal David's older brother, Linus, steps in to make Sabrina fall in love with him instead. Only problem with Linus' plan is that he didn't expect to fall in love with her as well.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Just the thought  Mr..King continued the story of Danny, I could not wait to see the finished product. I was not dissapointed. The story was perfect, a complete idea that could continue the story. Thank you.
B0055S348W|5.0|I've been using the PrintShare app for about a year and a half and it works great on both my HTC smartphone and my Kindle Fire. I had a problem printing yesterday and sent a message to the PrintShare support folks, got an answer back within hours and am back to printing! Great app and outstanding customer service. By the way, I paid the original price of $12.95 and it has been worth every penny.
B00ECUARO8|5.0|This was a charming surprise. Loved it. Great for families. I don't like Matthew Moconaughey but he was brilliant in this movie. So were the other young actors
B00003CXTG|5.0|I saw this movie when it came out.  What a movie!!!  Sad in a lot of ways, of course,  but a very beautiful and very emotional movie.  Well worth watching.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It will keep you entertained for a long time great for long car rides or when on a road trip
B004GHNIRK|4.0|I already knew I would enjoy this book I love the old school stuff will probably read it again :-)
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Love this movie, great faith-based movie with real life scenarios and awesome Godly responses.  God is love, and we are called to love those who make bad choices.
0380729407|1.0|Not to sound like a disgruntled teenager, but I'm not a fan of Bradbury's protracted writing style. I read a great deal of classical literature, yet this book was painful to read. The only reason I had to was because of a mandatory school summer reading. Would not recommend to a friend.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I enjoyed reading this novel, it is close to 50 shades of grey but better!!  The crossfire series is awesome.
B007R11DKQ|5.0|I'm a huge fan of the writer, Neil Gaiman. He work is always fantastical, always with a touch of horror, and always with a lot of humor.
0060899220|5.0|quick read.  Anthony is a jerk but that is his routine.  He is easy to deal with in the written word than on TV.  He knows his food and has a good sense of humor.  Nothing too insightful here but interesting to hear what goes on behind the kitchen
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|This game is a good way to waste a few minutes. I am not sure yet wether I will keep it or not.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|It is your typical game where you build and collect things. But it has better graphics than some of the others you see
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|Purchased for Kindle. This game does exactly as the name implies. There are not any special features or game types that stand out from the rest. Doesn't seem to have any bugs.
B000001FKY|5.0|Long Live Def Leppard lol.<br /><br />Amazon sent this package to me 2 days before its' estimated delivery! Sweet!<br /><br />The sound is amazing and I really don't have any complaints.<br /><br />One of the best albums of the 80s, hands down....
B00G32OER4|4.0|I waited to watch this movie even though I've heard rave reviews about it for so long now. I love any type of horror movie - especially those &#34;based on true events&#34;. How accurate those &#34;true events&#34; are, I'm not sure, but seeing that line seems to help the mental psych get into the film before it has started.<br /><br />The Conjuring had some of the best &#34;scary movie acting&#34; that I've seen in a while. The kids in the movie were all great and I think it was their acting that really brought the movie around. The scenes were not too over the top to where it took away from the spook factor. Though I think it would have been better (more fun) having been seen in the theater - or with other people that scare easily. The &#34;jumpy&#34; scenes were spaced almost too far apart to where it seemed like you were waiting forever for something to happen. Hence, seeing it with a group of people might have made that part a little more exciting.<br /><br />The story line really wasn't all the different from others. I still prefer Amityville Horror (original) over this simply because I liked the filming and script layout better.
B002NZV68U|1.0|No where near as sweet as the first version. Johnny Depp's portrayal of WW was disappointing to say the least.
0399255370|1.0|What a disappointment! I found the overall tone to be unpleasant (not the kind of griping I want my child to emulate) and the stereotypes predictable (really, the kid should color inside the lines?!) to offensive (pink is a girl color - great, thanks for reinforcing that ridiculousness). Glad I only checked it out. I definitely would not want my money going to support this book. I would expect a book like this to have been written 30 years ago, but not now.
0679805273|5.0|Love this book.  It is one of our favorites to read to my son.  He wants to read it almost nightly
B00439MV42|3.0|Good movie, but Back to the Future I is by far the best of the 3. It has a few scenes that don't flow very well.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|The graphics are decent. It puts you in natural settings that are fairly accurate. I don't hunt personally, but this game is pretty good!
B009L6UDUG|5.0|Love all Bond series.<br />This one is awesome.<br />Played perfectly.<br />Brosman is superb and love the extras about him during the filming.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This is a beautiful book.  The story is engaging and the characters draw you in.  This is the kind of book that makes you wish for a rainy day with nothing else to do but curl up on a chair and read.  I recommend this book.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Love it!!!  Its my favorite place on the internet, use it constantly.  Ive made alot of friends and I really enjoy seeing pictures of my family.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|I love SOA so I'll give 5 stars to all seasons.  Maybe I'm not the best rater for this one :)
B00DQAM5LI|5.0|Absolutely love &#34;Shepherd of Fire&#34; and &#34;This Means War&#34;. I'm bummed I missed the first part of their tour, but hope they swing through again after Europe.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|I've been following Allie's blog for years so some of the book was very familiar, but after finishing.. I feel like I got to see a whole new side. Loved it!
0399246665|5.0|Product is a gift so did not open the package.  Bought for 20 month old granddaughter - she loves books so should work out fine.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|you just never get tired. the only thing I don't like is that after you lose 5 times you have to wait like 20 minutes to get another life but other than that its awesome.
B00CB4ET0K|4.0|The game is awsome but the bad news is that you don't get coins for daily awards but, like I said the game is awsome.
B00003CXIP|5.0|Purchased for a friends birthday. Classic movie. She is a teen ager and had never seen the film. Now she owns it!
B000SEGMAU|5.0|Intimate portrait of a wonderful relationship which is &#34;food for thought&#34;  applicable to most relationships. A m.ust read in our culture.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. Late nights just because I had to know what was going to happen next. Excellent read!
B0095VPBFY|4.0|I had been using A4 processors and decided to step up. I could see no marked difference in performance, although I did no benchmark testing. Thus far the processor has performed well in a desktop environment. It may not be for Gaming but that is not what I do.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I play it when ever I need something to do, its awesome if u ever are on a long plane ride or car ride this is a good game for it j choy ceaSE uh knob in fundraisers t succumbing f2f hcgxfzf xxx . H cub
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is the best game. Great effects and challenging levels. I can play for hours. Good thing you only get 5 lives at a time or I would be glued to the game.
0618918248|5.0|Dr. Dawkins in his writing once again demonstrates the lunacy of &#34;God&#34; and design using scientific evidence and clear precise logic. The book highlights the absolute fact that people without faith should, can, able and are living a highly moral, productive and admirable life, perhaps more so than even those with faith in God.<br /><br />Especially he highlights the implicit atheism within all humans, and the absolute FACT that any scientific theory is truly better than the cowardly design idea where things come to be without real logical explanation. It is a book advocate true and absolute atheism, to which personally I have no certainty of. Though the arguments are solid and the evidence states in the book are not shaky without merit.<br /><br />I'd recommend this to read for all freethinkers, even for religious people to think about things from an objective perspective rather than the absolute subjective faith world view.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|The game is fun and challenges your critical thinking skills. I'm a little concerned with the lack of instructions or support if you're stuck. Overall this promises to be a great game. Good luck with further development.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy crush is off the chain. I have played this on my phone and on my tablet and it is the real deal. You should download it
B008LUM25M|5.0|I must read for all of those sci-fi action junkies !  Really catches you !<br />Expecting the next seqel to be just as good !
0316055433|5.0|The price was spectacular and the delivery great.  I don't suppose I am being asked to review the book, but it to is one of my better reads in a long time.  I will have to look back to Ms. Tartt's other books.
B0030B621W|4.0|This is a very basic plot with only one actor. Nothing tricky about this. Some nice space scenary made me feel like I was out there with him.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Sadly, I have to agree with others reviewers of this book.  I had heard so much hype about it that I stuck it out to the end, but only out of tenacity.  The writer's style is so amateurish; it amazes me a publisher even got to the erotica parts of the book before sending a reject letter.  It was not the subject content that offended me, it was the absolute lack of creativity in writing.  My advice is &#34;skip this one&#34;.  If you want erotica, there is much better out there.
B008L1DNGI|5.0|Pretty fun game, and darn similar to the original on Sega Dreamcast. oh, the nostalgia... I might have to get out that old DC, hope it still works
B007N85ZXY|1.0|AWFUL  DISAPPOINTING  AND WE LOVE NEIL YOUNG  THIS WAS HIS VERY WORST IN OUR OPINION<br />HIS MUSIC IS SO GOOD BUT WHAT HAPPENED HERE???
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|This very game that I am giving a review for now, the one that I was asked to make is a cool game
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|The game is fun, but I couldn't find directions on what to do for a Vector battle. Still addictive though.
B00DVKOYBM|5.0|I like the 8-Ball Pool app a lot on the Kindle Fire HD. It takes some getting used to but once you get the hang of it just like on any mobile device it works great and is very fun. Love the app, I rate it 5/5 stars!
B004XZR63M|5.0|A classic must read...Robert Kyoaski is an incredible author and explained very nicely how to invest in real estate and how to plan financially.
B00F8GYC1Y|4.0|Fun game. I like the graphics and challenges. Good time spender to take your mind off stress for a bit.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game was fun until it wanted me to pay money for bonuses and more lives.  Come on. Make free just that FREE
B0082RHRHC|3.0|I had to read this book for school. It is boring in the beginning but the middle and end are actually  really  interesting. It can be hard to read  if you don't particularly enjoy reading but for those who are open to trying something new I'd recommend it. The language  can get confusing though it is a difficult book to comprehend.
B004I744AS|4.0|I love this Dictionary.  It can get to the words very easy.  You can get very clear meanings to words easily and quickly.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Can't wait to see the movie. I really enjoyed this book I want to see what they do with the movie.
B00EI4V3X2|1.0|Now I know my tech and when I say don't buy you better listen and save yourselves alot of trouble because I bought into the crap they're trying to sell us now.. This headset has terrible chat quality on the PS4 with the 3.5mm jack and aslo on the PC with bluetooth.. On the PS4 you can't adjust the volume of the chat and on skype the sound is horrible with bluetooth.. I also picked up radio signals randomly hearing music in my headset consistently.. This headset is not completely wireless because of the cable you have to use to chat on the PS4.. Product seemed defective or maybe they're just that bad.. Game sound was really good no problems there..<br /><br />I returned them about a week ago for a full refund and bought a pair of Astro A50's refurb ($199.99) and I will never buy another gaming headset as long as I live.. For $50 more these are flawless in every way, comfort, style, sound quality and the best part is it's completely wireless and PC chat on skype is crystal clear and you can play music from your pc or phone wireless into the headphones.. Cheaper is not always better and if you are low on cash just use a pair of Beats or other headphones and plug it into your PS4 controller and you get surround sound and it sounds pretty damn good to my surprise..
B00F91SCXC|2.0|because it was a dollar, and now im trying to watch it again because the service was crap and yall have raised the price to five dollars now.  yall suck cause its not right to do that. set your price and stand behind it. thank you
B009NF54ZE|4.0|This is a new experience for me.  I am older and play few games but this is very enjoyable.  I find some of the objects difficult to see when they are in shadows, but over all the chapters are suited to any age.  I recommend the game.
B00GLX1MG6|4.0|Pretty funny - some `groan' worthy moments here and there, but if you suspend a little disbelief, it's a fun ride.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|This is a good app. My hubby made me download it. He is a software engineer and recommends this highly.
B00DKY4LBW|1.0|This album sucks. Period. Whatever happened to rock and roll? This is the most depressing thing I've ever heard. Nothing but  slow crappy tunes. With all their talent it's a shame they can't write any decent songs!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I guarantee that anyone who plays despicable me:minion rush will be in love with this game when I first played it I couldn't put it down
B007FKI9G0|5.0|For any rock and roll fan, maybe.  A zillion memorable lines and scenes that make you laugh just thinking about them.  This is satire perfected.
B00F7YHDWC|3.0|Its a very teaching just I would not let my kids play it because well they are stupid people almost killing them selfs
B00B5HQLMI|1.0|A good movie if you are 12 years old.  Trite. Confusing. Stupid. Unbelievable. Dull. Long. The only redeeming quality was the death of M.  Oooops.  Spoiler alert.  But 12 year olds won't care.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|It was very interesting,suspenseful and  definitely entertaining.  Although, the main characters seemed somewhat unreal and obsessive regarding their sexual appetites..
B003G4W49C|4.0|The book was great but it got confusing in some places but other than that it was very interesting and enjoyable
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This is by far one of the best strategy games I have ever played. It's hours of fun and very addictive. Works great in kindle fire hd
B004NELBPC|5.0|I read it just about every day. They're fast on the uptake, covering breaking news quickly, from a progressive slant. And they have a sense of humor too.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|Very well written.  Still don't understand why she was so promiscuous and got into heroin and why the PCT?  But it worked.  Sounds like she is now a well- put- together successful woman.  Good for her. I'd like to read one of her novels.  Good read.
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|First, I must admit that The Shining was my first really scary book.  I read it in two settings and as I recall, may have even called in sick to finish it. Based on that book, I read every other Stephen King book written.  So my expectations were high.  And to be honest, not met.  This felt very long with some unnecessary parts.  And while it was very long, it did not have the same kind of descriptiveness I have come to expect and love from King.  I thought the episode that Dan held onto as an adult was somewhat weak.  I needed more from the relationship with Momo.  I thought the jumping around from plot line to plot line was a little jarring. But step aside from all of that, and aside from my expectations of King, and you still have a solid book that was fun to read and a good story.
B004J4WLB4|3.0|Didn't like any of the characters, especially the main one.  Thought the &#34;language of flowers&#34; was actually cultish.  Couldn't understand how or why she gave advice to people with their relationships.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Works well on both my phone and Kindle! I would, and probably will recommend the Clean Master to my friends!
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|it is ok. i guess i just got bored with it. i play it my phone sometimes. it has just gotten boring.
B00FWLSLJ4|4.0|Fun, entertaining movie that was exactly what it was trying to be. And they managed to make the giant monsters and robots look amazing.
B0063IH60K|4.0|i absolutely love solitaire.  i go to bed and.play for about an hour before i go to sleep. relaxes me.
B008JFUPK8|4.0|This movie was more action oriented than the previous movie Superman Returnsand not as caught up with the romance with Lois Lane. In this version we get to see Clark learning to use his abilitiesbefore finding out that he is capable of far more than he knows. This version takes a number of aspects from from all the previous incarnations up to the current &#34;New 52&#34; Superman in the comic books, for example in both the comic book and this movie they finally updated the suit by eliminating the 19th century strongman trunks, I always wondered why those were for when I was a kid. The action scenes are quick... a level of superspeed so you might have look at it. a couple of times.<br />I hope that if there is a series of sequels to follow, the writers do a good saga for the most recognizable character of modern times. I think it is off to a good start.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This is a great game. The only problem I have is the fact the Princess Luna automatically starts<br />at five stars so you can't play any games with her.
B00F91RYL8|1.0|Boring, predictable and really really slow.
B00C1040TO|1.0|App doesn't work on a Kindle Fire. Looks like a useful tuner and metronome. But there's no sound from the tone generator, and no indication the metronome is doing anything. I've wasted enough time installing and uninstalling trying to get it to work. Don't waste yours.
B007L3BMGA|2.0|A big disappointment amid excellent reviews and worldwide popularity. Shallow and predictable story line ala Pretty Woman. The only positive side of the sujet is the absence of a standard American happy end.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|My objective is to keep this review just about season 1 of “The Walking Dead”.  However, given the direction that later seasons have taken, it is necessary to discuss later seasons for comparison’s sake.<br /><br />  Season 1 starts off with a scene lifted almost directly from “28 Days Later”, with sheriff Rick Grimes waking up from a gunshot induced coma to discover he is in a deserted hospital that looks like it was the site of an apocalyptic nightmare.  Of course, we know that several months earlier a pandemic virus that kills its victims and reanimates them as ‘walking dead’ overran the Deep South and, from all indications, the rest of the nation, if not the world.  While Rick was unconscious, his wife (Lori), son (Carl) and best friend (Shane) all were forced to escape the cities with other refugees.  Rick’s goal is to try to find survivors, with the hope that his wife and son are among them.<br /><br />  Based on the wildly popular graphic novel of the same name, and hitting television sets at a time where popular culture’s interest in zombies was at its zenith, “The Walking Dead” had a very auspicious start.  The tension, drama and suspense as Rick joins up with a group of survivors, that includes his family, is palpable.  His determination to find a solution to this crisis by taking a group into Atlanta to the Centers for Disease Control leads to several other compelling encounters with different survivor groups who are persevering in their own way.  The additional drama brought about by Rick’s unexpected ‘resurrection’ creates massive conflicts between Shane and Lori.<br /><br />  Season 1 comes to stunning climax when Rick and his group learn that there is no quick solution from the one surviving CDC employee.  The subsequent seasons will be about the long haul survival of these people.<br /><br />  One of the biggest disappointments about Season 1 has nothing to do with Season 1.  The problem is that none of the following seasons ever managed to come close to the narrative pace and excitement of these first episodes.  The one dimensional caricatures of the first season were not as big of an issue as the plot continued to rapidly advance.  Unfortunately, as the producers decided to artificially inflate story lines to increase the number of episodes they could run, the failure to engage in any meaningful character development because exacerbated by plot elements that moved slower than molasses in January.<br /><br />  However, Season 1 can remain a shining example of how to kick off ambitious show.  It can also remain as a reminder of what the show failed to live up to in later seasons.
B00942G4UA|5.0|Excellent movie. Clear concept, interesting and very moving. Excellent job in explaining the concept in a easy to understand way. I would highly recommend it to everyone.
0385366450|5.0|I bought this on audio cd....my wife would yell at me at night for sitting in the driveway listening to just a little more of it while my dinner was getting cold.  This may well have been my favorite book of 2013, and I've probably listened to 30 or more this year.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I think this app is really fun for being free..it is really funny and entertaining . I recommend it to anyone who likes games like temple run and subway runner!!
1439190275|5.0|Dr. Westman lays it all out beautifully. I have low carbed on and off for the past 15 years. I suspect that the low carb way of eating is a great improvement over the average American diet (way of eating). But I won't advise others, as I am not a doctor. I know it works for me and for a few crucial health aspects besides just weight loss. However, Dr. Westman IS a doctor, and the book is not only useful as a procedural on doing the low carb way of eating, but fills in with all the facts and studies that are very convincing. Nothing is as convincing, though, as one's own experience.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|One of Grisham's best books!! As good as A Time To KILL. Very fleshed out characters. Really enjoyed the book.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|Excellent combination of satire , comedy, romance and adventure. It kept my attention and had me completing it in a record time...I am a slow reader.
0857207520|3.0|I usually really enjoy historic fiction but didn't really care much for this book.  I didn't like to the flow.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Serious the costumes last very super long:(<br /><br />Awsome but that's ok so much awesome fun.<br /><br />Celestia cost about 1234<br />12345 gems.<br />My Little Pony is great.
B008EKON56|3.0|Mini-USB connection is dated as all my equipment and chargers are micro-USB.  The 30-pin adapter is a little stiff but with use I'm sure it'll loosen up.  It works as advertised though!
B000XA5K4I|1.0|Shoot 'Em Up is simply awful! I bought this loser of a film on Blu-ray and I was totally disappointed.<br /><br />What's with Clive Owen eating a carrot and killing people with it? That's just so stupid! How did this piece of trash get made?<br /><br />Also, this film is tremendously vulgar and I mean really pervertedly vulgar. One example is Paul Giamatti fondling a dead woman in the backseat of a car. I can't believe the three main actors would even have consented to be in such garbage. Clive Owen, for whom I always enjoyed in films, has been in a couple of really terrible movies, this one by far the worst! If he continues to choose really sick films like this to star in, he might find he won't have much of a career left. I like action movies, but this is just a sick, perverted piece of tripe trying to pose as an action movie.<br /><br />Bad, really bad, if I could give it no stars or a negative number I would.
B00A2XU9IS|4.0|Good fun app. Great for the kids and parents for the Christmas countdown. Enjoy the puzzles they are real exciting.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Fun like at a fair with out spending money!  Great for killing time.  Addicting, fun, suspenseful :) .  Enjoy.<br />Coins regenerate while your off line...up to 40.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|A very simple and straightforward game.  Very fun and lots of playable variety in a very simple package with all the different options.  One tip: Don't use tokens to buy bananas.
B003VANOFY|2.0|After trying two of these headsets, I've come to the conclusion that they just aren't worth the money. First of all, both of them would not hold a charge more than a couple of hours. They would also not gain a charge while on - meaning that in order to charge the headset you have to turn it off and then plug it up. The software is also buggy. The buttons and mic would randomly stop or start working contradictory to what the software setting was, and requires powering off/on to fix. Finally, the Dolby Surround crackles with some games and has to be turned off, even though the game supports it. I believe it has to do with the way the sound in the game was coded, but that's just a guess as to why some games always work fine and some always crackle and cut.<br /><br />I would not recommend this headset. I wish I had returned my second one in time and just bought a good wired set. Now I'm stuck with this. Normally Logitech stuff is great - do yourself a favor and just pass on this, regardless of how much they discount it.
B00FWLSLJ4|4.0|Fantastic graphics with immersive details. The story has been around and moves at the regular arc but the director really captures the feeling of making the humans like little bugs in a bigger universe and that we're part of a larger system that we cannot really control. Kind of his thing I guess.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|a great book, nice story . and i got it for free . sooo no complaints there.<br />thank you amazon
B00BD99JMW|1.0|This is the third installment to Veronica Roth's Divergent series.  I loved both Divergent and Insurgent and could not wait for Allegiant to come out. Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed on how Roth wrapped up the series.  The majority of the book was good, a little slow, but good. It wasn't until the very end that became extremely frustrated.  I think Roth tried to wrap up the series with a monumental ending and forgot who her audience was.  This is a young adult series and you expect a nice wrapped-up-in-a-bow ending, and that is not what you get.  Sadly, I'm also no longer looking forward to the movies.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Mostly great. Sometimes runs slow but overall fun. Runs better than Facebook. No bugs and it loads faster and runs cleaner
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|This game is really fun! Starts out with a small shark with few assets but upgrades are easy to earn by just playing the game. Unfortunately after working for quite awhile to earn the Tiger shark and being only 5000 coins away from buying it my game froze. I was incredibly frustrated when I lost EVERYTHING after uninstalling and then redownloading it from the cloud. That said... the game is fun enough that I went ahead and started over.  Oh and its fun for all ages: 8-40 in my house all play it!
B000URWYTS|5.0|I recently did a tour of Florida Southern College and the Frank-Lloyd Wright buildings.  This book was one of three recommended by the docent.  The writing pulls you into the lives of Frank and Mamah.  This will give you a beginning to understanding this architectural genius.
B009NF54ZE|4.0|As others have stated, zoom and pan is really needed for this game. Especially for those with compromised eyesight. Some items are so small they can't be seen.
B00003CXXP|2.0|Who would like living with a man made human or child.?  I would not!  I guess there are people that would love to have some one to boss around all the time.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|The life of one little girl and how it changed so many peoples lives,  accounts of how people live in Afghanistan and the historical history.
B00E3BK0QQ|5.0|This game was thought provoking enough to keep me and my boyfriend entertained for several hours on a 10 hour flight. Awesome.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is fun no matter what age you are. I downloaded for my 2 year old, but she didn't understand how to play, but I have a ton of fun
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Found this book by accident.  I could not put it down!!! I started on my kindle and had to finish it on my iPhone as I forgot to bring my kindle on my trip.
B000FC1MCS|2.0|Didn't care for it. About a fourth of the way into the story I ended up reading every other chapter and even many of those I skimmed through. Beats me why this story was a best seller. I won't bother reading any other Haddon works.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|just fun to play . although can be frustrating at times. but would recommend, it anyway lower levels are easy but get harder the higher your level.
B003L77G6A|5.0|Love these. I get to watch them over and over. Made great company while I was in the hospital awhile back.
B00BC254I8|5.0|The day this book was released, I read an excerpt posted somewhere or another wherein Tyson strangles Don King from the back seat of a limousine that King is driving. That sold me - I thought I was going to read a couple hundred pages of Mike Tyson telling insane stories. What I got was immeasurably better.<br /><br />This book is Mike Tyson's life story, in Mike Tyson's words, as told to a writer. It might not be the undisputed truth, but it is his truth, and it's his entire truth. It is brutally, unforgivingly honest, and while he has few kind words for the likes of King, Robin Givens, and Desiree Washington, no one fares worse in these pages than Tyson himself.<br /><br />Whatever you may think of Tyson, he is without a doubt one of the most fascinating sports figures of the past hundred years. He's a study in contradictions: a terrifying boxer with a temper that one could charitably describe as \\"mercurial\\" and yet he speaks softly, almost effeminately, with a lisp. The man said he was going to eat Lennox Lewis' children and praised Allah in the same sentence. He was paid tens of millions of dollars for fights that often lasted less than one round, and was bankrupt within ten years. Of course this guy's story is going to be great.<br /><br />But the two episodes in his life that he's most known for, his tumultuous (and allegedly abusive) marriage to Robin Givens, and his rape trial after a night with pageant contestant Desiree Washington gone horribly, irreversibly wrong, aren't glossed over. At all. If anything, he talks about them - the trial in particular - in detail that's simply uncomfortable. And it has to be. If he's to have any absolution, any redemption in the public's eye, he has to be able to tell his side of the story for those who want to hear it, those that wonder if perhaps his in-ring persona was unfairly turned against him.<br /><br />Undisputed Truth spends many, many chapters on how that persona developed, from both his cruel childhood on the streets of Brooklyn, to his being taught by Cus, the only father figure he'd ever known. Tyson's relationship with Cus is a well-known and oft-romanticized slice of boxing history, and the realization that everything that he learned from his childhood and from Cus that made him the tremendous fighter that he was being precisely what ensured his time at the top was so short and why he was so ill-prepared for life as Iron Mike had to have been painful to come to and write about.<br /><br />Whether you find Tyson as fascinating as I do, or want to learn more about the man behind the glove (and there's much, much more to him than I expected), or just want to know what in the world he was thinking with that tattoo, you absolutely must read this book. Don't expect 500+ pages of back-patting. All too often, memoirs are just a remembrance of happy times, rough patches smoothed over or omitted entirely. It's refreshing to read someone so well-known write something so unflinchingly honest about himself. This dives headfirst into the realm of absolute self-loathing. However much you might despise Mike Tyson for some of the things he's done in his life, he despises himself so much more for them.<br /><br />I want to think that this is the time he gets it right. That this is the time he has another chance and doesn't throw it away. That he's able to wipe away a little of the stain from his legacy, to be able to provide for his family, to find some peace. After reading his story, I'm not sure, but I'm rooting for him. Just like the old days.treets of Brooklyn, to his being taught by Cus, the only father figure he'd ever known.

B002N5N4M6|5.0|I love this season of Big Bang Theory, I think I'm all caught up to all the new episodes now.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|But that I could give less than a single star.<br /><br />One of the most unfortunate developments in mobile gaming is the proliferation of wait gaming - rather than getting a game and being able to actually play it as much as you like, which would make sense, your ability to play the game itself is crippled. This, by any logic, should be the immediate end of any studio that embraces it. If you bought a car that you could only drive ten miles a day unless you paid to &#34;unlock&#34; additional miles, that car manufacturer wouldn't last the week. But we've come to accept this from games for some reason.<br /><br />Candy Crush Saga is simply a match-three game, a concept that's been around since at least 1990, when Columns was released for the Sega Genesis. Candy Crush Saga takes everything fun about Columns and makes you pay for it, or else wait. Want those special power-ups you're told you earned? Pay. Want to play after losing five times in a row? Pay or wait. Want to play those new levels you just unlocked? Pay or wait three days. King.com stole a game concept and then held the game's enjoyability hostage. There is absolutely nothing new here - every &#34;challenge&#34; is taken from another game that innovated, and cast about in levels that are designed for you to lose. The more you lose, the more you have to wait, the more you (hopefully) pay. The more powerups you (hopefully) buy. The more quests you (hopefully) fork over to skip.<br /><br />This entire concept needs to stop. Unfortunately, until players wise up and stop rewarding studios for doing this, it won't. Perhaps someday.
B00B7Y0206|2.0|The app is great but I had to uninstall the update due to my Android phone not  (HTC Wildfire S) having enough memory.
B00BRUPICM|4.0|What a fabulous mystery. A terrific thriller. Terrific characters in Commandant Camille Verhoeven, Divisionnare Le Guin, Louis and Armand and Alex whose kidnapping sparks the story. I love good writing, and plot surprises that I didn't see coming but were right in front of me all along or that made complete sense. What I couldn't over look was the stomache churning gore and violence and torture. The book didn't need it and I certainly didn't either. *sigh* It took me right out of the novel and made me think who enjoys reading or writing this filth?
B00DXP0QV2|5.0|Essential in the collection of a fan to the bone of nirvana. Contains unreleased material you must have as a real fan. A piece of music history.
B002APU580|5.0|Watched it in the theater and wanted to see it again.  It was as great the second time as it was the first.  Of all the others,  I like this one the best.
B00GLX1MG6|3.0|Not a big Jennifer Aniston Fan.  And this one backs me up.  She was just awful.  The rest of the crew was okay.  Not that funny.
1611762359|4.0|wonderful character studies --- the author takes you inside the minds of each character --- they all can be at once admired for their strength and rejected for their weaknesses ---
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This game is so much fun I just wish I had more friend's on Facebook that had a tablet to play
B00EY8BRGU|1.0|i did not order this movie and never got it or saw it thru amazon so i don't know why it's on here.
B008JFURII|2.0|&#34;You haven't killed anybody in months.&#34; Frank Moses (Willis) is enjoying his life of retirement. He spends his days relaxing with his girl, shopping at Costco and not killing people. When he meets up with his old friend Marvin he is forced back into his old life, this time not only to save his life and those around him but the world as well. First off I did like the first Red but I wasn't crazy about it and wasn't sure a sequel was needed. After watching this one I'm still not sure a sequel was needed. The original was fun and entertaining but the best part hands down was John Malkovich and his eccentricities. I was looking forward to that more then anything when I started to watch this one. I was disappointed in that regard because the &#34;voice of reason&#34; and the one to go to for advice was Malkovich. That is totally different from his character and I'm not sure why they changed it. As for the rest of the movie it seemed flat and phoned in. While it wasn't all that terrible it just didn't have the same feel of the first one, but not unexpected. Most sequels are that way. Overall, another sequel that isn't needed. I give it a B-.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Sycamore Row, is as usual, a fine piece of story telling. John Grisham has yet to let me down. His back ground certainly contributes to his legal thriller's. I always look forward to his next book. He is unsurpassed in this area!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Awesome book alarming erotic and sad! I couldn't put it down! Read it on my kindle whenever I could! AMAZING!
B00EVW04PE|1.0|Oh my goodness. I'm a guy and like action movies, but this rivaled Wanderlust as the worst movie I've seen over the past year. It continuously goes to the point of ridiculousness and beyond. Considering the cast, I expected a little cheese going in, but couldn't believe how many times I found it outright painful to watch. If you just have to see it, do yourself a favor and wait until its out on HBO or something, because you'll feel stupid for paying money to watch it.
B00AREIAI8|2.0|The game is okay. It's kind of disappointing when you have to pay real world money for the gems and coins if you want enough to buy anything.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|It is a great heartfelt movie with awesome original tunes. I also bought the CD to listen to in me car.
B004G5ZY7E|5.0|I've read a couple of Nesbo novels, and this is by far the best.  Very well plotted.  Characters are well drawn and engaging.  None of the overly clever authorial misdirects that mar a few of his later books. Very tense in spots, especially at the end. Highly recommended.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book, took me about a day to read it simply cuz I couldn't put it down. got my free edition downloaded/borrowed through amazon prime and while I was reading I was so entranced in the story I literally felt a need to have to know what happens next, continuously. and in the end I felt nicely content.
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|WHY?? Why do I like LinkedIn?<br /><br />I guess it's so I can be one of the In Crowd and sit at the Big Guys' Table!<br /><br />Why, indeed -- it's LinkedIn for Pete's sake!!
B00E6X4GAW|5.0|Because she is one small girl who had a voice that could be heard across the globe and even a dumb Taliban Muslim coward could not silence it. In fact his actions amplified her message and distinguished the Talibans as a cowardly group who targeted the weak and oppressed. God Bless the people in Birmingham who repaired a broken body but not VOICE! It is a great read and one I would recommend.....especially for the uninformed in our society.
B00B3MN65K|5.0|I love all of his music, except for the Christmas album.  I just did not find that exceptional.  I think his best album of all is &#34;Closer&#34;.
B00004YRQA|5.0|Works great. I've had it for a while now. It is very durable. I would highly recommend this product to anyone.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I've only had this headset for a few days so far, but I have already fallen in love with it. I will come back later on to do a follow up review.<br /><br />This headset is fantastic. The quality if top notch, the sound is incredible, and the microphone is just crystal clear. Like the other reviewers that have experienced this, all of my friends say that my voice is much clearer now. Setting up the headset for my PC was effortless.<br /><br />The big thing for me however, is how comfortable this headset is. Another review here mentions that initially, the squeeze of the headset will produce a mild ache for a little bit before the earcups begin to mold to your specific headshape and wearing style, and this is true. I also wear glasses, and for the first day, the spot under my ears(where the headset presses on the most) was a tiny bit fatigued, but not so much that I stopped wearing them. Now, 4 days later, I barely notice they are on my head. So much so that when I got up to grab a drink, I had forgotten that I was wearing them and that they were wireless. If this was a couple months ago, I probably would have ripped my wired headset clean out of my soundcard and most likely damaged something in the process.<br /><br />Also, the 7.1 Surround Sound is truly an incredible experience. I use these to play BF4 and it honestly feels like you are in the game, and when explosions go off behind you or from the sides you can hear them like you are standing there yourself.<br /><br />Anyways, this headset has stellar performance. Battery life is exceptional, the range is exceptional, the audio and microphone quality is exceptional, as is the overall build quality. I'm surprised that these don't cost twice as much.<br /><br />I highly recommend this headset to everyone.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I love his characters and the depth he goes into. You put down this book really knowing Vaelin and those around him. Great book
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|Spectacular photography and 3D effects. Very good story. They say there are only 3 movies that are completely 3D: Avatar, Life of Pi, and Gravity (which I still have to watch). I agree!
B00ACBN9CI|5.0|This game is just about the absolute best game I've played since Doodle army please do yourself a solid and download this game
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|When ever I try to go into the game it says try so other time or some thing it's making me mad
B004VMUS9G|4.0|It does just what it says.  I really like because of it gradually increases the alarm sound instead of sounding at the max volume to yank you out of sleep.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Great book. Great realistic story. More real than the movies. Or the hollywood movie. Ends like a could be real ending. But dont expect a movie ending. Cause there is none. Its a work in progress type of book.

B004XE0P5E|3.0|After being intrigued by a cut from the Beyond the Pines soundtrack (The Wolves), I bought that - then this album.  The Beyond the Pines sountrack is a total waste and I regret this purchase as well.  It is, however, decent background for our Sunday afternoon Scrabble game.  Maybe I should have bought For Emma to get more music with a &#34;Wolves&#34; vibe.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|The writing was horrible. The story line was boring. The ending ruined the entire trilogy. Left a really bad taste in my mouth.
6305428050|5.0|I Just couldn't stop laughing, It was  funny and entertaining.<br />Elizabeth Shue was awesome.<br />I am a sucker for  happy endings.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|It was good enough up until the end. I liked the first two books in the series so I needed to see how it turned out, but Veronica Roth needs to burn all copies of this book and write it again. If I wanted sad endings I'd read the news.
B001AEF6BI|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies. Judd, Alley, Emelio, Molly and Anthony Great!<br />The Club everyone wanted to emulate.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book about August was good for my soul. It really reminded me about so many good things in life. There are a lot of amazing people out there and we really owe it to ourselves to be the best (and kindest) that we can be. How we act and treat each other does matter.
B000MQ54OY|1.0|Horrible movie.  Horrible Movie.  Horrible Movie.  Horrible Movie.  Horrible Movie.  Horrible Movie.  Horrible Movie.  Horrible Movie. Horrible move.  Horrible Movie.  In every way shape and form.  Don't buy this junk
B00FN811SY|5.0|Anyone looking for an App for reading the Bible will love this one! The interface is extremely simple and the search functions are excellent.<br />While it is especially appealing to Jehovah's Witnesses as many other reviews attest, it is important to note that the app also contains the KJV, the American Standard Version, the Byington Translation and the Kingdom Interlinear with the Greek text and English translation below each Greek word.<br />So don't think this app is only for Jehovah's Witnesses! Any serious Bible student will appreciate the value of this excellent free Bible program.<br />For non Witnesses though, I would highly recommend comparing the NWT and the NWT Reference Bible to the rest - especially to the Interlinear. You will find the Reference Bible to be extremely true to the Greek text, and the NWT to be concise, accurate and very easy to understand!
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|A. PENDERGAST at his best yet again. Hard to put this one down. It's a must read for  his fans!
B00FAX6XQC|2.0|The game has very unrealistic pricing when it comes to purchasing credits...the graphics are great, and the game isn't bad fun wise. But you can't afford to buy anything without spending a fortune...It's just not very cost friendly for a app based game. I would love to play it more and would definitely rate 5 stars if I could afford to do more on it...
B008602KQI|5.0|There was lots of action and suspense.  I had seen it before, but I wanted to see it again before I see the newest Hunger Games!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have only been playing for a few days and I love it! I have let my young son play on the Kindle and he has such a blast. It keeps us all occupied for hours. Candy Crush Saga it great fun for the whole family.
B00F35BV64|4.0|I know the timeline was changed when the Romulan's and Spock appeared in Star Trek 2009, but it would have been better if they could have set up Khan's story like some of the website articles I read. One story I really liked was the one where in 1974 Gary Seven rescued Khan and his fellow augments from a lab in India that was going to be destroyed. During the Eugenics wars Seven tried to make peace between Khan and his superhuman adversaries but to no avail. Seven did help to get Khan get off Earth in the Botany Bay to save him from being apprehended. Some of the Botany Bay tech was modeled from Quark's shuttle that landed on Earth in 1947(Deep Space Nine: Little Green Men). Earth built the first nuclear powered spaceship the Botany Bay. Gary Seven and Roberta Lincoln gave Earth the specs for impulse drive. From the book, Federation: The First 150 Years.
0736430512|1.0|Evil, bad book.  Do not buy.  This is a weird, creepy non-Disney brand worthy book.  I don't know who let this through but it's freaking strange.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|The action was great but not enough killing groups of zombies. I would have liked to see a bunch killed with Vulcan Mini-Guns, Strykers with 105 cannons and grenade launchers, tanks, napalm, and more with  flame throwers.  Also it only showed zombies biting people not eating them. Maybe the sequel will be better.
B00EJRSEX0|5.0|Bravo para Isabel !!!!  Quien nos sigue cautivando. Este libro mantiene al lector en Asombro,  Ira, Preocupacion, Paz, Alegria, pero sobre todo, no puedes defender su lectura.
B00FPH6AXE|4.0|Good movie I enjoyed it.  Kept me wondering what was going to happen next.  Kept me on the edge of my seat.
0763644765|3.0|Cute as a picture book for a child to flip through on his/her own, but there are not many words so it is awkward to read out loud.
B00F91RYL8|2.0|Not a Zombi movie person person if I had known I probably would have not watched it.  Was intertaining and kept me on the edge of my seat.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Star Trek: Hey, what else can you say!!! I've been watching them since the beginning. Lots of action here and it's interesting how they're tying in the old movies and episodes; who knew Spock had it in him.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I have read all of the books by John Grisham! Great author....can not wait for the next one. Highly recommend Sycamore Row!
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|I found this very shallow and silly. Parts of it were pretty but that's it. The story ads nothing to Oz.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Fun and challenging. Only wish the collections were easier to get the pieces for completion. Better than other hidden object games.
B00886XQO0|5.0|Very satisfied, arrived in a timely manner and still works even after a year of intense gaming. recommended for serious gamers, people who have friends that play online, or tirds that like to talk smack.

B00DYOOGYK|2.0|I ran this on my Kindle Fire and could not use it.  The driving simulation uses tilt and rotation of the Kindle to do the steering.  Only problem is that if you treat the Kindle like a steering wheel, it turns the game's car the opposite direction!!!  Not good.
B00B0LPYXG|4.0|Denzel is always good! Very realistic in regards to addiction struggles. Thought some of the nudity wasn't necessary to the story line.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I am always thrilled when a new Grisham book comes out.  The story is always interesting and keeps you wondering what happens next.  Please keep your novels coming!
B000FC0ZAI|4.0|Interest bgook. Actually read it because I wanted to watch the movie, but heard it would be better to read the book firsdt, so...  The author had an interesting was of telling the story (actually several stories) in chronological segments by initially going forward in time, insetijng a central peice,  them return in time to finish each story to finish the book.  There are 11 segment but in really only 5 stories. I am a slow reading, so I did have a little trouble remembering the story line when it came around again as the book progressed, but at the end of the book I was satuisfy with the book as a whole.  I now will watch the movie and see if it is true to the written word.  One thing - could not relate the title to the stories, but I am sure others will be able to relate the two - I just enjoined the read, especially the way the author interlooked all the characters by a specific devise as the stories movr forward,  and the way the main characters in the three stories related to each other.
B00C5R7B0I|1.0|I am really concerned that I read a totally different book than the other reviewers who have posted. Where to start? What Dust needs is an editor and a plot. This book was absolutely everything I can’t stand about what the Kay Scarpetta series has become in one 500 page novel. Implausible timing, totally no character development, and a storyline that takes less than 50 pages to wrap up with a neat, tidy bow. If this was a book by any other author, I would have stopped, but as a Scarpetta series fan I felt I owed it to the good doctor to finish. In fact, I’m so meh about the whole thing I’m not even going to provide a summary of the paper-thin plotline. There’s more meat in the book blurb than the entire novel….<br /><br />Some random thoughts:<br />- Really? You’re going to have this whole murder/mystery solved in a day over 500 pages?! Really?! This whole novel reads like one run on sentence. I know that Dr. Scarpetta is an amazingly talented woman, but it’s actually tiresome for the reader to have no change of scenery.<br />- Would it kill you to write about a happy character? Everyone is so lost in their own self-pity/depression spiral that it’s honestly kind of a downer to read. I don’t know if Cornwell is tired of this cast of characters or what, but she seems completely content to make their lives miserable and depressing.<br /><br />Also, I found it incredibly distasteful that Cornwell uses a recent tragic event and inserts Scarpetta into it. Not appropriate.
B00BYKIKJS|3.0|The movie was ok.  Not quite what I had expected or hoped for.  I had to look at it for a class.  I don't know if it was really that dry or if my expectations were just too high.
B00BAXFECK|4.0|A contemporary and insightful novel. Loss of loved ones and how it can impact your life. Circumstance and choice? Who? If anyone decides. In the<br /> end we can only hope for the best...<br /><br />Benjamin
B003YFIUW8|5.0|Touching and heartbreaking at the same time. It's a book you won't forget.  A must read for everyone. well written
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Held my interest through the book.  Characters were interesting and the long-term family secret behind the suicide made it interesting. Grisham has done it again.  I have read all his books.
B000WMFZNS|5.0|This is the favorite movie of my best friend, so bought this as a Christmas gift.  He says he has watched it many times.
B004NTDEXY|5.0|Good acting and hard hitting action.  Couple of classics for the collection.  Will survive the test of time.  A great pairing.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Great insight into a soldiers life. Frightening who our soldiers have to fight against - the mad, the drugged, the brainwashed and brain dead.
B00D2ZF3GQ|2.0|Spoilers ahead.<br /><br />I avoided this movie when it first arrived primarily due to being busy and the fact that it was getting ravaged by critics.  Being a sci-fi fan and also a fan of Will Smith I decided to take a shot.  Is it really so awful?  Well, it's not very good but it's not terrible on Blu ray either.  What it is, is another mess and missed opportunity by director and screenwriter M. Night Shyamalan.  The story (by Will Smith) had some promise.<br /><br />Set in the distant future, a thousand years or so after the Earth was all but destroyed for human habitation.  Cypher Raige (Will Smith) is a general in charge of space exploration or some such thing.  He's a big shot on the planet where Earthlings were evacuated to, those many years ago.  He's married and has a teenage son, Kitai (Jaden Smith) who is trying to get through \\"Ranger\\" training.  He's athletic but like all teens of his age, impatient and well, dumb sometimes.  The father-son relationship is strained and distant.  We learn this is due to the loss of a daughter and sister (Zoe Kravitz in flashback scenes) years earlier as she tried to fight off some giant monster-thing protecting her young brother.<br /><br />At the coaxing of wife Faia (Sophie Okonedo), Cypher makes an effort to improve the relationship with Kitai.  This leads to the lad accompanying his dad on a deep space mission.  After encountering a fierce meteor storm, their ship breaks apart and crashes on a dangerous planet.  Yep, Earth.  It is now inhabited only by wild animals and subject to wide fluctuations in temperature.  The rest of the story involves the severely injured Cypher directing his son to find his way to the aft part of the ship, located a hundred miles away.  That is where the rescue beacon can be launched for the search party.<br /><br />Although the entire crew has been killed in the crash (but for our two heroes) and there is no way to communicate with the home planet, the electronics and cameras in the front part of the ship where the Raiges have survived, work locally!  So Cypher can watch and help Kitai on his hazardous journey.  Huh?  Kitai runs into all kinds of trouble of course, having to fight off baboons and eventually the monster-thing who was being transported on the ship and is now loose on Earth.  Oh, and both Cypher and Kitai have some kind of \\"ghosting\\" ability that has to do with controlling fear or something.<br /><br />Shyamalan's string of movies seem to get worse with each release.  \\"After Earth\\" is but a continuation.  While the film looks great, there is little tension or worry that Kitai will accomplish his mission.  While rated PG-13 for \\"action violence and disturbing images (the monster-thing), the film could have easily been rated PG and worn a Disney badge.<br /><br />The 4K 1080p Blu ray transfer is as good as it gets.  With much of the film shown on an Earth with mostly wooded or jungle like locals, the colors really pop.  Beautiful greens and blues.  The digitally created animals look great.  Detail is superb.  Likewise the audio is spectacular.  The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track rages with thunderous opening sequence that involves all the speakers.  The dialog is beautifully translated, clear and accurately centered.  Certainly no complaints with the way the film looks or sounds.  Here is a list of extras:<br /><br />*A Father's Legacy (HD, 8:51)<br />*Alternate Opening (HD, 2:19)<br />*Building a World (HD, 12:00): Cast and crew discussion.<br />*Pre-Visualizing the Future (HD, 5:50)<br />*The Animatics of After Earth (HD, 8:39)<br />*1000 Years in 300 Seconds (HD, 5:25)<br />*The Nature of the Future (HD, 5:22)<br />*XPrize After Earth Challenge (HD, 3:35)<br />*Previews: Additional Sony titles.<br />*DVD Copy.<br />*UV Digital Copy.part of the ship where the Raiges have survived, work locally!

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Amazing, for 35 dollars everyone should own one of these, there's simply no reason not too. To just stream you tube to my TV alone is worth the cost.
B00F3W9NQ2|5.0|I love this series. Got hooked on Netflix, but it is one season behind. It has to be watched from the very beginning to understand what is going on. This is not one that you can jump in the middle and get it.

B00G4Q3KOC|5.0|I felt silent as did the rest of the audience at the conclusion of 12 years a slave.  I am now reading the book which I bought from Amazon and half way through am delighted to report the movie was faithful.  I think the movie was more impactful due to the graphic scenes.  The crimes that occurred to the women slaves were a necessary part of the movie understanding why more so from the book.  I watched and learned how truly horrible slavery was and feel my American History schooling did me no justice. In the book Solomon told of not being able to empathize since not being a slave yourself which ultimately changed.  I cant imagine living free with a wife and kids being ripped away from them for 12 years of torture.  This book/movie should be required reading or seeing for high school upper classmen.  I would hope that Hollywood recognizes this movie as more that art, perhaps a history lesson.  This has to be once of the best movies for 2013.  Go see it and don't forget to bring a box of tissues, that is if you have a heart.
B00FQMVCEA|2.0|Cheap animation meets Predictable plot.  Even my 4 year old wouldn't watch it a second time.  No wonder it took 3 years to make it.  It was a idea by Pixar that Disney destroyed and then tossed to Disneytoon studio in India their straight to DVD company.  Look for Planes 2 on dvd in a couple of months.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|Unfortunately it was just okay.  I wanted it to be better, like A Time To Kill, but it wasn't.  Wished I didn't purchase it.  By the wayI like John Grisham as an author, particularly because he re frames from using profanity and tells a good story.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This may well be the best purchase I've made all year. What's not to love about the new Google Chromecast?
0307388840|3.0|I don't get this book. I feel stupid for not understanding it better, but it mostly left me confused about what's real and what isn't with regards to the story itself. What did Briony make up, what did happen?<br /><br />It took me more than a year to read Atonement. I started out, got about a dozen chapters in, and just stalled. I couldn't seem to get interested in continuing. I ended up going back months later and starting from the beginning because I'd totally lost the feel of the novel by that point.<br /><br />Then I did it again. Stopped and couldn't seem to get started again. I put it down, read a dozen or so other, more light-hearted books, before picking it up again. I read a page or two (sometimes more, if the particular chapter was interesting enough), and gradually, I managed to finish it.<br /><br />Probably some of the best chapters in the entire book have to do with Robbie's military experiences and Briony's nursing training. The rest was just there to be muddled through.<br /><br />I have no desire to see the movie now because this book was just so difficult to read. I doubt I'll make the mistake of reading any of Ian McEwan's other work, seeing as how difficult it was to finish this one book.

B00003CXCS|5.0|Like most people in life - I became familiar with the songs from this movie first - without realizing where these songs came from -- !! This movie has been a favorite of mine since the early 90s -- based upon a true life account during the reign of the Third Reich in Nazi Germany -- this story will leave a lump in your throat -- you want to cry -- but cannot -- because of the sobering reality of what these folk and many others like them -- came through, during one of the darkest moments in world history !!!<br /><br />This movie alone blows a big hole -- in the holocaust-deniers theories -- no story like this could be made up from scratch -- when viewing this movie -- with the stunning Julie Andrews -- a slow realization of what people can do to (against) others in the name of patriotism to the flag -- is nothing beyond shocking !!! So tell me: just when does a nation's FLAG take precedence over the life of your fellow human-being ???? -- Loyalty to one's flag should ONLY remain intact -- to PROTECT your fellow citizen / countryman -- NEVER to use it to destroy them in the name of patriotism-- that's not only misguided thinking -- it's SICK --<br /><br />The music alone in this wonderful classic -- will keep you humming to yourself long after the movie ends -- it's a wonderful story of good winning over evil -- a story of redemption - buy the movie -- it'll do you good inside your soul.

B005K17RU0|4.0|One of the apps that allows me to view weather for deployed locations.  It isn't Kindle friendly as far as I can tell so far.
B000FC12ZA|1.0|I really enjoyed this book while reading it. I was amazed at how closely the Aborigine beliefs mirrored those of New Age and Native American teachings. BUT ---  that was before I Googled the book and learned that THE WHOLE THING WAS A GIGANTIC HOAX.  The author never spent time with Aborigines. She never walked around the Outback. She just made up every single frigging thing in this book.<br /><br />And now I feel TOTALLY DUPED -- and stupid -- and ridiculous for believing that what she wrote was true. So if you want to read this book as fiction, great. Just don't be a moron, like I was, thinking that there was even a shred of truth to it.  Or else you'll end up feeling mad and ripped off.  Grrrrr!
0375842209|5.0|This is a page turner! The plot is meaningful for today and the author has a gift for crafting words beautifully.
B00FAVRHBE|3.0|I could ramble on for thousands of words but I will condense my thoughts into a quick statement: While this was an excellent Doctor Who special, it was not a great 50th Anniversary Doctor Who special.  The classic era was practically ignored instead to focus the vast majority of its time and effort on the new Who Doctors.  I know some previous anniversary specials have been wanting (a.k.a. Silver Nemesis), but I really wanted to feel the full weight and history of 50 years in this special (more akin to &#34;The Five Doctors&#34;).  That didn't happen.  If Tom Baker was included, I don't see why the other living classic Doctors couldn't be there too.  We know they were interested based on &#34;The Five(ish) Doctors: Reboot.&#34;  Good but having a clip show in the final minute doesn't celebrate 50 years.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|I bought two sets of these DVDs- one for my mother and the other for a sister. Each set has been viewed multiple times since this TV show is a favorite with my family. Who could get tired of the excellent character development? While there isn't a lot of action, it's easy to get caught up in the drama.
B00EHMG358|5.0|I have only read the first 9 chapters and cannot wait until the book is released in December. It is going to be another best seller for Preston and Child! I am excited to start reading an adventure with Pendergast and company in it.

B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Very disappointing. I bought it because you are told it works with tablets. I loaded the app on my IPAD and realized it did not work with chrome like on a laptop. It works only with Itunes and .. I was not expecting these misleading claims from a company like Google. The should fix that ASAP, I don't see any reason why it should not work with chrome on IPAD. it is really very bad for their image.

B00CHCUR9I|5.0|Of course I'm a huge fan of The Walking Dead t.v. show and have been since season one. Like many people, I had NO clue it came about from a comic book. I'm not really a comic book person. I have nothing against them. I used to buy them for my brother every birthday and Christmas. I just never got it into them. I'm always hearing how much the comic books differ from the show.....understandably so. What kind of show would it really be and would it have the millions of viewers it does if it followed the comics to a \\"T\\"?? Anyway, I received an email the other day from one of the many \\"daily ebook deal\\" groups that I subscribe too and they had, The Walking Dead #1, comic book for free. I've actually been dying to check these comics out but never got around to it. I figured, it's free, what have I got to lose? It turns out.......I LOVE this comic book! I'm not saying I'm a lover of all comics now but I definitely will be reading the rest of these. It's pretty cool how something so short can tell such a great story through very little words and terrific drawings! I'm impressed by any one that possesses any type of artistic ability and this comic most definitely impressed me!!<br /><br />If you're like me and love TWD show but never had an interest in the comics..... do yourself a favor and try this one out! I recommend it to all zombie fans, not just TWD fans! I really enjoyed it and think most people will as well!!<br /><br />Great job Robert Kirkland!! You won yourself another fan of your, The Walking Dead comics!! :-)
B00BAXFECK|3.0|The main problem I have with this book is that it is a first person narrative by a young man (13 to 20-something) which sounds like the voice of a sophisticated woman.  What young man describes a woman by listing the designers of her various clothing items and shoes?  Theo uses terms like accessorize.  This from a straight man. This holds true for furniture, home decor,art, etc.  It is the voice of Donna Tartt and she is not convincing as Theo.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|I knew the big twist was coming but I was still captivated.<br />The same great characters,  the same great Grisham writing and an interesting tale.
1439136653|5.0|I loved the film and the book is even better. Although I don't read many novels, this book shows the inequalities in modern India. The stories are sad and hurtful, such as the old veteran being found to be a deserter and the autistic child dying due to a lack of rabies medicine. It differs from the movie version. However it shows a side of poverty in a poor country with a corrupt upper class.  This sounds a lot like the United States. The outcome is classic, just like in the movies.<br /><br />I highly recommend the book version. Once you are hooked, you can't help but read the rest of the book.
B002RVZV9K|5.0|Awesome DVD.liked seeing all the old photos from their early beginnigs.Very informative on how they made those signature sounds of Jack White & Jimmy Page. Those guys are something else!! AfterJack shows how he did Seven Nation Army he says: That will be $5.00 please! . What a great sense of humor they all have!!

B005LAIIGW|5.0|Excellent, Brilliant, Breath-taking, Suspenseful, Thrilling, Amazing... these are SOME of the adjectives I could think of (top of head) for this movie. I LOVE that - it was a woman - in the leading role and only two leading actors with a GOOD script, of course it was good to be damn good. I probably have seen it 4x and about..... 5x listening to the amazing and hunting soundtracks - something I do little of, now THAT says something about the score and how well it was written. Also, a MUST buy for anyone and certainly for me as I rarely buy DVDs anymore - will be better quality that getting it from iTunes.
0553386697|5.0|The Whole-Brian Child is a great book for parents, and anyone who works regularly with children. It teaches parents to use twelve key strategies in everyday scenarios to help them in providing experiences to promote healthy connections in the brain. The scenarios are presented in a cartoon format and thoroughly explained, making the strategies very applicable to real life. Information about the child's brain is presented in a very comprehensive way and is accessible to a wide audience. With the perspective that this book provides, one can further understand and put into context child reactions and behaviors. Using the suggestions in this book, anyone can learn to transform challenging situations into learning opportunities to nurture a growing child's mind and encourage cognitive, emotional, social, and behavioral development through age twelve.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|I absolutely loved the first three books. I was addicted and could not put my kindle down. However, AFFC took me a looooong time to finish. I couldn't get into the minor characters at first. I was salivating for a Tyrion chapter the whole time. I will say this though, by the last couple of chapters my love for ASOIAF was rekindled and I got to that point where I could not put it down again. The new and previously minor characters grew on me and I immediately purchased the new book after finishing this one. So hang on, it's a rough start but it gets better.  I would give it 3.5 stars but it won't let me.

Look forward to their next seasons and counting...
B002SSUQFG|4.0|The classic Seiko 5 series. This small mechanical marvel is the best watch I have ever owned. I use it when I Need a smaller, tougher time piece (outside work, working on my car, going to the gym). It's solid canvas strap is indestructible and the watch itself has never fallen behind or had any problems. I have 4 other Seiko watches that are more extravagant, however this little guy is still my favorite.
B00GO95TAC|3.0|I have not seen the episode or read reviews of it, this comment addresses the pricing issue hence the neutral rating. The cost in theaters tonight will be $15. Pre order for the blu-ray is $23.99 and doesn't ship until Dec. 10th. If this was $2.99 or even $3.99 this morning that sounds like a mistake or typo to me. At iTunes it is also $7.99. To me that doesn't seem so bad to able to watch a show that is really more of a movie than a typical tv episode and was just aired for the first time 2 days ago.
B000U0O9FM|4.0|Brutal as the title implies.  Not for the faint hearted. don't read too many reviews that might  give something away.  Itw
B00D1VKZ3M|1.0|People read Bridget Jones because they would like to laugh. It is not funny when children loose their father, when a woman is heart-broken because the Love of her life died. This was such a tragic topic. I was not able to forget the death of Marc Darcy even when Bridget was trying to be funny with her Tweeting.<br />I think this was a huge mistake. I heard Helen Fielding said we needed to know how Bridget faces a big loss. We already knew this: she eats more, she drinks more. And I do not think the people who bought this book wanted to learn the hard lessons of life. The opposite: I personally was trying to bring some sunshine in to my life. Well, this book will make you cry instead of laughing... Awful!

B00B5HQL50|4.0|Fantastic movie. Even though I grew up with Roger Moore as James Bond I must admit Daniel Craig is the best James Bond ever. This movie continues the recent run of excellent Bond flicks and like the last two, it has a lot of action with a surprising ending.

B00FN3HRG4|5.0|I remember seeing her on October 11, 2012 – it was a night I will never soon forget. Barbra was truly and utterly sublime. The audio recording is a marvel, the sound is fantastic. The orchestra sounds so lush and Streisand’s voice is front and center!  Was she really 70 years old last fall?! Her voice remains beautifully intact after five decades of dazzling millions worldwide. There isn’t a single track on the CD that warrants skipping, honestly it’s Barbra, why would anyone skip over a song she sings.<br /><br />The album opens with what has to be the greatest comeback song ever written, it is of course, ”As If We Never Said Goodbye” from Andrew Lloyd Webber’s musical, Sunset Boulevard. Streisand used it almost 20 years ago to open her triumph New Years Eve concert at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas in 1993/94.  Here, the song gets retooled with new lyrics to commemorate Barbra’s return to her hometown. Funny, poignant and moving, the crowd roars its approval when she reaches that immortal line, “I’ve come home at last” – simply amazing!<br /><br />“The Way He Makes Me Feel” from Yentl, is one of the songs that Barbra has never performed live in concert! Now that the film has celebrated its 30th anniversary, the song is all the more special. Barbra’s voice sparkles here and it’s amazing to me how wonderful she sounds.<br /><br />“Didn’t We” is a song Barbra sang live in 1972 for the McGovern fundraiser and her earlier version can of course be found on Live Concert at the Forum. I loved this when I heard it at the concert, Barbra’s voice is strong and the reverb on the big chord near the end is fantastic! I saw video footage from Phildelphia (10/8/12) and she talks about that back in 2006, she and music director, William Ross, tried to do the song but it didn’t work. I’m glad Barbra decided to try it out again, it’s wonderful!<br /><br />“The Way We Were/Through the Eyes of Love” needs no introduction, her tribute to her dear and late friend, Marvin Hamlisch is so emotional. Listen to it! If you don’t get even a little misty-eyed then you have no soul.<br /><br />“Rose’s Turn/Some People/Don’t Rain on My Parade” - The Styne medley is a killer, and possibly the best track on the album. Seriously, I repeated it like four times. Her shout at the end, “You bet your ass, Papa” is the best – it’s a remarkable statement to Streisand’s naysayers who frequently shout that she’s too old (or she can’t sing anymore) to play the role of Mama Rose in Styne and Sondheim’s Gypsy. Although it’s a missed opportunity, she could have tackled “Rose’s Turn” and ended the concert’s first act with a big bang. Nevertheless, it’s a showstopper as only Barbra can deliver!<br /><br />“You’re The Top” is definitely from the second night (10/13) as during Thursday night’s performance, the song seemed clunky and out of place. It’s been polished and rehearsed, again with special lyrics dedicated to all things Brooklyn. Barbra really seems to have fun with it, so does the audience.<br /><br />“What’ll I Do/My Funny Valentine and Lost Inside of You”<br /><br />Despite the fact that I am thankful Chris Botti’s solos were cut from the audio CD, his duets with Barbra are wonderful and his trumpet playing is a great compliment to her voice. I also love the arrangements of these pieces. The high note near the end of “Lost Inside of You” gets a great reaction from the audience.<br /><br />“How Deep is the Ocean”<br /><br />Jason Gould has a beautiful voice. Obviously, he has inherited his mother’s gift of singing. The mother and son duet is beautiful! Don’t take my word for it, give it a listen.<br /><br />“People”<br /><br />How many version of this song has she performed live?! Not that it matters, this one is just as beautiful as any of the others!<br /><br />“Make Our Garden Grow”<br /><br />This is the big finale and Barbra delivers her money-note at the end with great gusto! This is identical to the arrangement Rupert Holmes did in 1988 for the abandoned Back To Broadway sessions. It’s funny too, IL Volo also sings but their duet with Barbra on “Smile” isn’t included. The end of truncated as the tail end of “Somewhere” is left off, which was heard during the concert. I love this song from Candide, and I can only hope that the studio version of it recorded in 1988 will come out soon!<br /><br />The Voice: I just read a recent review front the New York Daily News, in which Jim Farber writes, “…her lower notes have a phlegmier texture. When she wants to belt, she turns hoarse before chopping the note down to a length she can sustain. That means bravura numbers, like “Don’t Rain on My Parade” or a rare “Rose’s Turn” from “Gypsy,” have to borrow some of their drama from acting rather than vocal chops.” I will admit, Barbra’s voice has lowered since her last live concert tour in 2006. No, she doesn’t sound like she did 20 years, even 30 years ago – but who would expect her to? The woman is 71 years old. Yes Mr. Farber is entitled to his opinion; however, I think he’s being a bit unfair – obviously he forgets that the voice is also part of the body, it ages too.  Barbra is well aware of her narrowing vocal range, but does that stop her?! No. The concert tour was still SOLD OUT. Age has unfortunately taken some of her higher register; however, her middle range is lush and intact. On such gems like, “The Way He Makes Me Feel” you can hardly tell that her voice has aged at all.<br /><br />Verdict: Barbra is in fine form on the album, I am stunned that she is 71 years old.. truly! This definitely deserves repeated playing.  The mastering is great, there’s a real improvement in this CD over the two disc 2006 outing. Too bad we don’t get any extras (read: bonus tracks) like “On A Clear Day” which was used as an opener later in the tour and there are other varied songs that Barbra performed elsewhere but not in Brooklyn.y-note at the end with great gusto!

1934030554|4.0|I liked this book, but I certainly did not love it. Thus the 4-star rating. Over the past summer I got talked into training for, and entering, an Ironman 70.3 event to be held in June, 2014. The woman who talked me into rehabilitating my 51-year-old body for the event has completed two full-length Ironmans at age 45 while holding down a full-time job, and she uses a power meter in her training on the bike. I went for a bike ride with her last Spring and she was killing me on the hills. I decided her way of training with a power meter might be something I'd like to learn more about. So I got a rear hub power meter (along with a device to collect the data), built it into a wheel, and threw it on my bike. Of course, this didn't do much for me since I had no idea how the power meter could help me in my training efforts.<br /><br />As a kid I was a highly trained competitive cyclist. I excelled at racing on the track (velodrome) and on the roads doing criteriums. I never bulked up too much, so I could compete reasonably well in road and cyclocross events, too. However, I NEVER performed well in time trialing whether on the track or the road. What I have gathered from using my power meter, reading this book I'm reviewing, and comparing what the book explains to what I used to do when training on my bike as a kid, is that power meters are great for enabling the user to accurately classify his or her training rides as either: (1) junk miles, (2) slow endurance miles, (3) tempo or quality training miles, (4) race pace miles, or (5) sprint or super high intensity miles. Instead of classifying or categorizing your rides based on a heart rate monitor or your perceived intensity level, you simply need to look at your head device readout to see how you are doing in watts/power during your ride or study the data file when you download it to your PC at home.<br /><br />I have found my power meter to be a really good training tool to use when I am riding on an indoor trainer. That is where I can easily figure out what gears I can handle and what gears are too big for me to use currently. And every gear I drop my chain onto while maintaining an average cadence of something like 93 or 95 rpm has an associated power rating in watts as long as I stay on the indoor trainer. So let's say I can pedal a 43x17 at 93 rpm on my indoor trainer for an hour and get an average power reading of 200 watts. And let's assume if I shift up to a 43X16 I'll ultimately struggle toward the end of the hour. As far as I'm concerned my tempo or quality training miles will be done using a 43x17 for a few weeks until I get comfortable with that gear. But the interesting thing to keep in mind is that I don't really care about the 43x17 gear ratio - instead, I care about the associated power number, i.e., 200 watts. That number approximates about 85% to 90% of one's race pace intensity which the authors call Functional Threshold Power (FTP). And the entire book focuses on how to test to find your FTP and then how to create training plans based on your FTP. And guess what they say I should do to figure out my FTP. You guessed it, they want me to do time trials. Ouch!!<br /><br />I would have enjoyed the book much better if the focus has not been on FTP, but instead had been on the five or so power zones and how thinking in terms of those zones can really help you devise a very beneficial and economical training plan regarding your cycling exploits. I would have liked the book better if it had ignored commentary regarding heart rate monitors and using them as a training tool. This book was supposed to be about power meters - not heart rate monitors. And I definitely would have liked the book better if the authors had stuck to the topic at hand - power meters - and NOT made the book into such a marketing piece for their training and consulting company.<br /><br />The book is better than just OK (i.e., 3-stars) because it fills a niche that really is not covered by a lot of books. It certainly covers the material its title claims it will, but I don't think it necessarily does a good job of educating the reader. Let me explain. My hunch is that the reader will feel compelled to go out and try to figure out his or her FTP. He might be able to figure it out. He might not? But if he or she trains properly that FTP number is going to change within 4 weeks or so. Then another test, and so on. This will work, but for me it is not the best approach to follow. And will the average reader sufficiently comprehend what is described in this book so he or she can devise their own approach? I don't think so. 4 stars!ks.

B001GAPC1K|5.0|this movie is such a cool movie i highly recommend it even if you dont like comic book movies this is a must buy for sure this movie has a lot of replay value
B00FAI2IUM|4.0|It was pretty good for a tablet racer, but not as good as a console one though could be improved some.
B0034G4P8A|4.0|this movie is very enjoyable its fun and entertaining, its a good introduction to the character of Thor i recommend it if you want to have a good time.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved it!!!!!! Couldn't put it down!!!! Can't wait to see the movie!!! Suzanne Collins keeps you on your toes with the second book!!!!
B0039208QM|3.0|i like this movie especially around Christmas its less batman and more Tim Burton but if liked Edward Scissorhands than you would probably like this
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book deserves a lot more than a 5.If you like books with action and drama this book is for you.
B0021L8V1Q|4.0|I really enjoy this movie even with its flaws as for the blu ray it is very good. The digital copy is nice the only thing that lacks is the DVD it feels very lazily done if you ask me. Other than that its a good combo pack worth buying.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. The intertwining stories were well written and kept you wanting to know more about each character. Definitely a great read!
B004RE29PO|5.0|this movie is a masterpiece one of the best science fiction movies very made in my opinion. For me this movie surpasses the original while remaining loyal to it. The blu ray is well done it looks good and sounds good it also includes both versions of the movie. The only complaint i have is if you watch the special addition and you have the Spanish dub on when ever it shows a scene that is added in for the special edition there is no Spanish dub it will use the English dub then when the scene is over it will go back to using the Spanish dub other than that its a good blu ray and is definitely worth a buy
B005XQLBU4|3.0|A new take on an old classic. It's pretty good but I still prefer the old classic. But I would still recommend this one.
B0039208CG|2.0|this movie is just a mess i don't really care for the cast and the story is just to silly for me to recommend this movie. i feel this movie was just a dumb down version of batman i hope we never see again on screen
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Best sounding, most accurate, headphones I've ever heard. I've had this same model years ago but lost them. The only issue I had with the old pair was that the ear pads began wearing and coming apart.
B005IZLPMY|4.0|This movie isn't my favorite marvel movie but it is a good movie great cast good action. Its a good start for the character of<br /><br />Captain America I'd say if you like the marvel movies its worth a buy.
1612680011|5.0|Book offers more financial knowledge and theory to start wealth building than any other book I have read. Would Highly recommend.
B003O7I6L6|5.0|This is a classic movie and a must watch/own if your a fan of classic action movies. As for the blu ray DVD combo i am very disappointed if you already own a DVD of this movie the blu ray doesn't look all that much better. The sound is improved slightly but not by a lot the blu ray doesn't come with any types of special features or have any special dubbing
B00BAXFECK|5.0|The prose at times is poetry. This is a hard journey but one I will treasure forever. Thank you Donna Tartt from Greenwood Mississippi for this literary masterpiece. I will read again.
B005LAII8K|4.0|Going in to this movie my expectations were very high i had heard nothing but good things for this movie and i did enjoy it but it didn't seem to be very logical to me it deals with a lot of brilliant ideas but to me seemed to not be as well thought out as i had hoped
B004EBZX6W|4.0|Easy reading.. well informative... valuable practical solutions... very helpful in solving network problems... able to identify almost all interference.... simple interface....
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|This game is amazing! It is not fake! This game is just like Minecraft but its 2D. There's different enemies but there is the zombie. Recommended! Hurry and get this while black Friday ends!
B00ACP3OOM|5.0|I bought the Finis underwater MP3 player as a birthday gift for my 18 year old grandson who swim laps every day. He texted me to say, they are awsome, spectacular! It is normally impossible to find a gift for him that he really likes, since like most kids his age, they already have every electronic piece of equipment imaginable. So my &#34;stock value&#34; as a grandma increased considerably, great product. It works well, and does exactly what it is supposed.
B007885IJU|5.0|Great album. It arrived in perfect condition and came with an online download code too. Perfect condition, perfect album. I recommend it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app is so cute and is a fun way to stay entertained after I am done with my homework.
B000A2W1X2|3.0|The movie was fantastic. It seems a problem with the disk that the image degrades and part of the movie can not be seen. This seem to be a problem with all the disks produced by the maker of the DVD. It has happened to me before.
B00FHATBGW|5.0|When you click on something the delay is a little annoying but overall... really liked it. The story-line and graphics are visually appealing for sure.
B00CIR97UW|4.0|A little light compared to SIngh's excellent previous work (in terms of both Simpsons and mathematical content), but highly enjoyable nonetheless.
B00G32QIEG|1.0|One the worse movies I've seen. The previews for it seemed great, but that's how they always are right? Total waste of time though. Only reason I watched it till the end was because of Ryan Reynolds. Haha...I highly recommend you skip this movie if don't want to waste your time. Seriously, you will regret watching it.
B007QA3AH2|4.0|This is a film that flew under the radar when it was release. It was refreshingly entertaining then and just as much fun to re-watch all these years later. Except for Segorni Weaver, it is full of TV stars that all went on to their own shows.
B000SEVVLK|2.0|Probaly I have read too many Lauren Weisberger books lately. They all seem to be based on a very similar storyline.
B00AOCLWF6|3.0|been there, done that. Even though I've never seen this show, it seems I've seen this story dozens of times. Nothing made me want to watch another episode.
B0081ISUOG|3.0|I downloaded another Stopwatch app when it was the give away. It does everything this app does plus has a better UI. Both graphics and function. This works but only gets an average rating. I'll be uninstalling in favor of the one named in my title.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|I have a new tradition - to watch &#34;The Blind Side&#34; every Thanksgiving, as a reminder of all that I have to be grateful for in my life. A truly touching movie!!
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|In true JP fashion she nails the mix of family, love, and courtroom drama. If you enjoy other JP stories, you will like this one as well.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game love it. The only thing is the same game play over and over again it needs more New things
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|Monsters, landscapes, crafting, night and day changes. I cannot list all the awesome things in this awesome game. (This was my first Terraria)
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Meh. This might be nice one day, but with the limited apps, it seems kind of pointless. Netflix, youtube and Hulu are already available on my xbox and bluray player, and they buffer the video streams much better and they've got better interfaces. Plus I can never get audio to work when I'm streaming a tab from Chrome. Maybe in a few years, when they start letting developers actually release stuff for it, it will be better, for right now, at least it's pretty cheap.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|In so happy candy crush is on kindle now I've been waiting for ever! I spent most of my time playing :)
B008Y212PI|5.0|I look foreward to playing this during my coffee break and sometimes just before bed.  I haven't played this type of puzzle before and am really enjoying it.  I got it when it was a faotd offering.  Might even consider buying a full version if it has lotd of levels.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Explanation:<br /> The Fault in our Stars, put quite simply is about Cancer. The main protagonist is sixteen year old Hazel Grace Lancaster. She is suffering from terminal cancer. The story centres on her life and her families, as well as the people she meets in a Cancer support group. One of whom is seventeen year old Augustus Waters. I can’t really reveal much more without giving the story away.<br /><br />Opinion:<br />John Green explicitly wrote at the beginning of this novel to not review his work. This is his author’s note:<br /><br />This is not so much an author’s note but an author’s reminder of what was printed in small type a few pages ago: This book is a work of fiction. I made it up. Neither novels or their readers benefit from attempts to divine whether any facts hide inside a story. Such efforts attack the very idea that made-up stories can matter, which is sort of the foundational assumption of our species. I appreciate your cooperation in this matter.<br /><br />I agree with Green in the sense that for all my years of schooling I never understood why in my English classes we had to review and critique and analyse people’s novels and poems and movies. I used to come home from school and tell my Mum that maybe people just wanted to write something or make a movie because they felt like it. Not because they wanted to reach someone, or because they wanted you to realise the foreshadowing techniques they used, or how much onomatopoeia was really in the story, or why they told the story in first person and not third person.<br /><br />So although our task as BookGossips is to read, review and critique literary work I am going to respect the author’s wishes in regards to this novel. That does that mean that I will not give you my opinion, it just means that I will not critique and review Green’s writing style, his use of writing techniques or try to uncover the hidden themes in the novel. I will instead just share with you my thoughts and opinions.<br /><br />Okay, so you pick this book up knowing that it is about Cancer, knowing that it will be sad, and maybe someone will die. But what you are not prepared for is the way you will feel upon completion of this story. I felt a complete swirl of emotion. In some ways I felt completely devastated, but mostly I felt pensive to the point that I have this new found appreciation for the universe and for life.<br /><br />This book was so emotionally draining that I could only read a few pages at a time to begin with. Then I had to leave it for a while, do something else and go back to it. I found it utterly depressing to begin with. This is the only book I have ever read where I didn’t want to skip ahead and find out the ending, as I knew that it surely could not have a happy one. I persevered though, and I am glad that I did, as by the end I felt that I owed it the characters to finish their story.<br /><br />I loved how this novel used many references to other literary texts and theorists. I am a person that appreciates the value of inspirational quotes, so I especially liked how Augustus had a house full of them. The revelation that the title of the book is in reference to a Shakespearian quote made me think and re-think about the title so much more. The use of these references speaks volumes about the authors own literary knowledge, as well as explaining the incredible intellect of the characters.<br /><br />A final note, this book has been listed on the Children’s Bestseller list! I cannot understand that, as I do not know a child or adolescent who would be ready to read and deal with this story. I as an adult had a difficult time reading and dealing with this story. So to the people who write Bestseller lists, I recommend you take it off and move it to adult Bestsellers.<br /><br />Summary:<br /> This book made me shed actual tears. I have only cried reading one other book in my lifetime, and that was when I was pre-pubescent and it was the cool thingto do, so it doesn’t really count. That aside this is a gut-wrenchingly hard read. This is not a book to be taken lightly. It will leave you reeling and make you think about it for days upon completion.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am totally addicted to this game. Love it! Very challenging. I absolutely love this game. cant get enough of it.

B00FFERTUK|5.0|I remember buying Nickelback's The State cd in 2000. They were about to open for 3 Doors Down in Florida & I had never heard of them before. I was totally blown away by their live performance & met them after the show. I told Chad they were in for big things, they sounded great. Hard to believe their popularity 13 years later. This cd provides newcomers & old timers with all of their hits. I have been hard on them lately but this cd is well worth your money. What other band gives you 19 songs for $10?<br />There are no frills in the packaging but for me it's all about the music. It's nice to have all their big hits on 1 disc. If you have a long drive to work or a trip planned then get this disc & crank it. Why not start your day off with the best of Nickelback!
B000XUBFE2|4.0|Love this book!  I haven't finished it yet (reason for only the 4 stars)  I am from Germany originally and understand exactly how this child is feeling.  I was born after the war but I lost some of my family during the war and have lost my brother and sister because my mother couldn't afford to feed all of us after the war.  Am still looking for my siblings.

B00BSB2AE4|4.0|Really great, as you'd expect for Allie.<br /><br />One star missing only because it *does* include a lot of content from her blog, so only about 2/3 of the book is new if you're a fan of hers.<br /><br />But then again, it's all funny. I wish I could give it 4.8 stars.
B00008OWZC|5.0|this cd is truely awsome,  must have for the collection, sound is great and the live stuff jams like no other
0767919408|5.0|Bill Bryson at his best. I've read comments on this book where the reader is disappointed by the lack of Bill Bryson's &#34;usual&#34; wit in this book. I disagree. Mr. Bryson's understated wit shines through in this book as it does in all his other offerings. Readers need to be reminded that Mr. Bryson is not a humorist but a writer who delivers what otherwise could be dry material in a palatable way with a witty twist. He brings history to life in a way that is hard to find in most history publications.
B0000025H6|5.0|trippy cd. love it. case was broken though, cd in good shape, the kids love it too.  hey teachers leave those kids alone!!
B00ELE8D4Q|5.0|Was sad when Cher first announced her retirement. Glad she didn't stick with it. The songs are very enjoyable to listen to.
B000002JEV|5.0|greatest cd ever, It came in perfect condition and I love this cd.  listen to it all the time, highly recommended
B00D2K40WY|4.0|It's a fun game for kids . And I like to play it.  BUT some of the clothes are locked.
B000002J03|5.0|awsome cd, cranking it out akl the time, introducing the kids to hippie music is fun. cd was in perfect condition
B00F91FRTO|5.0|I give this a movie 5 stars because of the music that was used and because I didn't know it was based on a true story and after I saw it I was doing research about the real people involved in the bling ring. It is such a well made movie and Emma Watson acted very well. If you haven't watched it you have to watch it !
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|It's definitely a fun game. The only downfall (to me anyway) is only getting a certain number of tries then waiting so long for your &quot;lives&quot; to regenerate. Other than that it's ok
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This is such a hot serious that has a good balance of suspense and love, that I wasn't able to put this book down! I highly recommend this to adults! =)
B00FY9JJYA|5.0|Absolutely fantastic.  If you like R&B, you'll love this album.  The collaborations are excellent - there is so much talent on this project! Can't want to Black Radio 3.
B0079XNWQA|3.0|I really like this C.D. for the fact that it carries the song title called &#34;I won't give up&#34;. That song means so much to my family and I and it really sets home for us. The C.D. was great. I love the voice of the main leader and it was just over all a really good C.D. =)
B001HBYHFA|5.0|I missed this series when it first came out. Now I've seen all these stars in hit shows so I went back to the beginning of this one to see all the episodes.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I liked it all.. I look forward to finding out what happens with Ender and Valentine and the bugger queen.
B000KCHZK6|4.0|It's Norah Jones. Though not a hit album like others, this is pure Jones; mellow, thoughtful and masterfully delivered. Her lyrics are every bit as strong as her song styling.
030746363X|5.0|Lost 20 pounds in 31 days.  He is a genius.  I now tweak my workouts to his findings.  When I lost the weight I didn't excercise just followed the diet 99%-100%.
B002ZG9788|4.0|Great fun from beginning to end. This is pure popcorn with good effects, good acting and reasonable storyline (if you like Greek Myth).<br />The movie has a nice tempo to it; melodramatic but not overly steeped in unbelievable effects. Just enough Hollywood to give it action without losing the value of story and messaging from the characters.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|We were watching the movie version of this book in Psychology and decided to read it so I can get a better understanding of the story. I do not regret reading this book what so ever. I loved it!
B00723NWJE|4.0|It's Norah Jones. Though not a hit album like others, this is pure Jones; mellow, thoughtful and masterfully delivered on a good album.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I think the game could use the fluffy unicorn drink that makes you a invisible fluffy unicorn and you buy it with bananas
B008N9AAQ4|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater and wondered if the Blue Ray would do it justice on a home screen;  it does. In the same vein as Baraka before it (same production crew, I believe), it is a tour de force of photography and the creators travel the earth in search of the truly unique, beautiful and sometimes awakening messages to remind us of our fragility and disregard for things natural.  Production values are amazing.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I can use the app any where there is WiFi. I like being able to connect to my account anytime. Easy to navigate.
B00GO95TAC|1.0|This is extortion.  There is no way any anybody could be Willing to pay this price for any SINGLE EPISODE of a tv show.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is awesome.My high score is 17,405 last time it was 16,404.it is realy cool.how much did you get?
B00EVQU1VM|1.0|Because I thought it was the english version. i was stuck with a story I couldnt read , let alone the cost of it. I was very unhappy. I think it wasnt clear to me that I was purchasing a german version. Otherwise I wouldnt have purchased it. Very unhappy.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This bible is really useful. While I am in my youth group and I forget my bible I switch to this. It is very convenient. I love it! Praise the Lord.
B00D29CBIU|5.0|I have been waiting for a book from Margaret for a long time ... Yay!!! As a counselor and coach, I am hyper-critical of self help material but everything Margaret does is amazing. She's insightful and on the ball (or money in this case). Her work is incredibly deep, yet easy to understand ... Lots of ah ha moments even for those who've done a lot of work on themselves. I have followed Margaret for a long time, taken her programs, dove into EFT and other modalities - yet this book still reached out and grabbed me. More revelations and breakthroughs which I haven't experienced for a LONG time! Results for me (as well as othersI know) have been almost instantaneous - perfect timing with the holidays! If you're someone who feels you have a long way to go, definitely check out Margaret's programs. They're very effective and thorough, and Margaret's team is incredibly helpful - you aren't on your own with the virtual programs.<br /><br />Thank you Margaret!!!! So happy to see a book from you!!! Keep writing!! :-)
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|I have playedAsphalt 6 on my iPod Touch, an this looks amazing on my Kindle Fire HDX. And this time it is free! You have nothing to lose by getting this app. Go get it today!
B003VANOFY|3.0|The sound cuts out every now and then but apart from that the battery lasts quite awhile and the sound quality is nice when it works.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|First, let  me say that I wanted Chromecast for a very specific purpose. I'm untethered.  I've got AppleTV on the main tvs and, on the guest room and library tvs, Roku lite boxes. (I can't rave about either of those devices enough.)  The only thing I want to do that I can't is watch CBS on something other than my computer.  There is a viewer app, but episodes go up on the website a week earlier.  So if I'm doing dishes, I can not watch the most recent episode of, say, Hawaii Five-0.<br /><br />It may be that you can sit in a room with a pad and play whatever's on it on the tv in the room, but for streaming from the computer to another room, it's useless. The manual says it streams 20', but on my trials, it's not reliable even at under 20' with a wall between.  I can get it to connect, but the image quality is poor (would have even been willing to live with that) but it will only play for 45 to 90 seconds and then it loses the connection.  Repeatedly.  I've tried  multiple configurations and locations but can not get it to work. (And I'm pretty tech savvy.)<br /><br />So for me, this is a completely useless device.
B008JFUO72|5.0|While not as great as the first, I3 is so much better than I2. While not... necessary, not watching Avengers first will leaving you scratching your head at some plot points. I liked the movie enough to buy the hardcopy.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|A compelling and hopeful love story. And laugh out loud funny at times, too. Hard to put down. Looking forward to reading another book by Moyes.
B00G32QIEG|1.0|Wow. Where to begin. I feel bad for Ryan and Jeff. I get where this movie was supposed to go, but what should have been a witty supernatural spin to the classic opposite-partner story ended up being a sad and, ultimately humorless, ride through an grossly overused CGI-universe. While I did enjoy Kevin and Parkers charactors, in the end I think I have to blame the director on this one. I am so glad I did not see this in the theaters.
B00DGO8CN4|5.0|Nothing like getting hooked on a song when it first comes out, and sticks with you afterwards. I've been a fan of Mike Oldfield ever since I heard &#34;Tubular Bells&#34;, and continue to be now. In the past few years, many of Oldfield's iconic albums have been remixed and remastered by Mike himself, to include box sets with the original versions along with updated remixes of the original, as well as a DVD with a discrete 5.1 surround mix of the album. I make no secret of the fact that that's why I buy these box sets. &#34;TB&#34; and &#34;Ommadawn&#34; are among my favorite albums, and when &#34;Crises&#34; was released, with its hit single &#34;Moonlight Shadow&#34; (sung by Maggie Reilly), I bought it immediately.<br /><br />The opening title track is one of Mike's long-form tracks, and comparing the original CD with the stereo remix shows several differences that some people on a website I frequent panned vehemently. I actually liked the reworking, and even said so on that site. One of the things Mike did was to expand the intro of &#34;Shadow&#34;, which I found interesting. The sound of the 5.1 remix brought the textures out even more. My feeling is that Mike wouldn't have undertaken this project if he didn't think he could improve on the original mix, to make it fit more into the vision he had for it. I think he succeeded. This set is not cheap, but it's worth every cent in my opinion. I encourage the listener to go into it with an open mind and form their own opinions.
B00GH4RKYM|1.0|Keeping up with the tradition of pathetic Superman movies, Man of Steel does not disappoint. Im guessing the idea was to reboot the classic comic book hero for a younger, more descerning audience. The result ends up being a story-limp, CGI-heavy feature that simply falls flat on its face while pretty much ignoring decades of media cannon. I hate the Superman charactor but even I can see how far off the hinges this one went... For instance, here are three GLARRING problems with this movie from a comic-book lovers standpoint: 1) Does anyone in the movie NOT know Clark is Superman? I mean really? And lets say you lived in this world - how brain-dead stupid do you have to be not to realize Zod takes you right to his childhood home? One of the greatest story points at the beginning was Lois not knowing who Superman was, but that too went right out the window on this one. 2) Why did no one seem to care that thousands, upon thousands of bystanders were dying in those fight scenes? Not only that, but where were the bodies? If youre going to go through the effort to create the violence, at least have the balls to show its consequences. 3) And not lastly - How does a super-advanced race just die out when thier home world explodes, yet a group of convicts, in a broken ship, have everything they need to simply go terraform a planet?<br /><br />I cannot believe a sequal was approved for this disaster...
B00CHS31DG|5.0|Fun to use.  Wished there was a manual as I would like to know what the numbers and the lights mean.
B00FWLDHSY|1.0|It had all the potential in the world. I mean it really did; mega-robots, mega-monsters, top of the line CGI, and a director with providence. It almost begs the question of how could you possibly screw it up? Well, Del Toro managed it to a spectacular level. With me it was the science - the director apparently took one look at all the physics textbooks ever written and decided, well, what do they all know... I realize I am a stickler for details, and Im willing to overlook a few slights as creative license, but just about EVERYTHING in this movie is impossible - stupid impossible. Not only that, but the insult to injury is that it is a science-fiction movie - its almost like theyre trying to make fun of everyone with a decent IQ.<br /><br />The acting is a different matter altogether. It was bad, I dont think anyone argues that, however I found it almost pain-relieving. Idris Elba stole this movie - despite the unrealistic nature of his charactor, he somehow managed to portray it brilliantly.<br /><br />All in all, I am so glad I only rented this one. It certainly wasnt worth a ticket stub or DVD.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Way to easy to rack up a big bill paying extra turns to play this game.  It is fun and addictive.
B003XU02QG|3.0|Not enough character development to have empathy for them. Disjointed scenes and slow at times to really get into the story line.
B008JFUPOY|5.0|Pixar does it again, with yet another masterpiece. With the right amount of both comedy and drama, everyone in my household loved watching Monsters University, and are excited to watch it again.
B00FN3HRG4|5.0|I was fortunate to have been able to see her perform in Brooklyn, live, at the Saturday night performance. She was amazing, as always! This recording captures the essence of Barbra's return to her home to perform songs, important to her, for her friends and fans, with her family, her son Jason. I'm so happy that she released this, as I now have a personal keepsake to accompany my memory of this extraordinary concert! Thanks Babs!
B00B0LPYXG|4.0|Well done balanced movie. Will Smith is superb and believable. More than a crash movie. Good backstory and definitely an adult's movie.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|a good marvel movie . If you enjoy the marvel movies its a must see . I would watch it again
B00EUUJID6|5.0|I am always in awe that such young singers have such mature voices.  I have been watching them since they were on their PBS first show.  They were probably about 14 or 15.
B009NF54ZE|5.0|This game is awesome<br />You have to find hidden objects in a room on a island<br />This I s awesome
B00F0O8SZK|5.0|Firts saw Susan on a talent show and was blown away.  She has such a lovely and soothing voice. Beautiful and gets you in the Christmas spirit.
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|This movie was awesome. I always like Denzel movies and this one is as good as all his others and i truly recommend this movie
1616614609|5.0|Honestly one of the best card games I have ever played.  This comes from someone who has dabbled in Magic the Gathering since the 90s and has played a dozen different customizable card games over the last two decades.  The mechanics are solid and the quality of the cards is exceptional.  The only negative I have for the game is that the symbols and layouts of the cards is a bit poor making it difficult to quickly sort out a stack.  This is a minor annoyance for an otherwise amazing game (but still something I hope they fix in the future).<br /><br />A lot of people ask me why I think this game is so great and almost always I point to the asymmetrical play between the Corp and Runner players.  Both sides work off separate mechanics and there is a constant sense of mystery of what lies ahead as the Corp player plays and discards many of their cards face down.  This opens up a lot of player skill in bluffing (for the Corp) and deductive reasoning (for the Runner).  Most games will come down to mathematical fact in the end but the journey to get there is filled with ups and downs as each card is exposed.<br /><br />I can't recommend this game enough to anyone that is serious about their card games.  The theme is spot on, the mechanics are solid, and the balance of the core set is solid.  Add in a few add on packs and this is really an amazing experience.
B009NF54ZE|5.0|Great game for rainy or cold day fun.  Amazing graphics do play  the first pirate adventure to keep up with story line.  Fun for all ages
B00E89VXQY|5.0|Great live performances.  Orion at the end is unreal.  Would recommend for any fan.  The movie was worth seeing just for the music.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I never reread books but I've read this book 11 times. Make sure you have plenty if time when you start this book because you won't be able to put it down.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game I sometimes play it for hours you you should get this game you will enjoy it.
B000KIPT30|5.0|Works well for my home studio uses, no excess noise and good amplification  for monitoring. Recommended for lower budget work.
B000XUBC5E|5.0|The more I read Coben, the more I appreciate his writing style.  This book was hard to put down and had some nice twists that I didn't see coming.  None of the characters were out of the ordinary or difficult to believe.  The plot was plausible and had some interesting side streets to travel on.  I will definitely continue to read his other books. I am attempting to start at the beginning and work my way through them chronologically.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is certainly my most favorite series. I can't wait to see Season 3.I just love the Crawleys and their staff.
B00BMR4RIG|4.0|The look is clear and clean. I used another popular weather app and I have been using this app as much as the previous app. I do like the graphics on this app.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Ever since my husband downloaded this game last Friday, my husband, daughter and I have been using as family game night. It has given us another way and more time to bond especially my husband and my daughter. I love hearing them laugh together. Even our one year old son sits quietly and watches us play.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|What happened! This was such a letdown after the first two books. Almost not even worth the read just stop at book two.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is really fun and addictive. Sometimes you can play all day. It's even more fun with new updates.
B000I9YLUI|5.0|Absolutely love this movie. the day it was set along with the love between two people who are very stubborn and just wont admit it.  Great acting and I just love the characters.  Its a shame this is just a movie.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Easy to install, easy to use, cheap.<br />It just works as you would expect.<br />Highly recommended for basically everyone.<br />---<br />Why do I have to write more words?
B000FC2L1E|5.0|I am so hooked. She just keeps on going. I can not put these down. I absolutely love this series.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|I think this game is awesome. At my home my computer is well not fit for games so I can't download any games like terraria so when I saw this in the app store I had to have it.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I found it compelling and the story kept me interested.  As always, there were parts left out of the book, but it was still entertaining.
B00AESN8XY|1.0|I purchased this on the Motorola Photon Q, and when I open the app, the screen goes black and than it says, &amp;#34;Unfortunately, Plague inc. Has stopped&amp;#34;. I feel I have wasted $0.99.
B003TSEL7S|4.0|Very exciting book, a great sequel to the Percy Jackson series. I can't wait for the next book. Good read.
B0067EKY7M|4.0|Loved the chemistry between all the stars.  Ewan and Emily are two of my favorites and they were splendid in this sweet and inspiring movie.
B009NF54ZE|5.0|I have played many hidden object games this is beyond great.I is fun and relaxing and addictive.I plan on owning them all.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|fun game very cool recommend. to any body enjoying reality. games must play gets harder as you go but gets more fun
B00G32OMF8|1.0|Completely agree with the comment that both actors are annoying (Julie Delpy more so). Who cares about two self-absorbed 40-somethings who seem to enjoy the sound of their own voices. They dialogue is ridiculous. Their banter is so self-absorbed and pseudo-intellectual - I have no desire to spend time with these people, real or fictional!
B00GSE92F6|1.0|I was really looking forward to watching this episode tonight, but asking a consumer to pay eight bucks for a single TV episode is unreal.  This sort of screw-the-customer pricing is exactly what causes folks to look for alternative ways to acquire their entertainment.  I don't know if it's Amazon's fault or the BBC, but either way the only person it hurts are fans of the show.  For that price I'll just preorder the Blu Ray with all the bells and whistles.<br /><br />I also think it's complete garbage that I have to buy a bunch of revisited episodes if I want to purchase Season 8 at the normal Amazon discounted rate.  Once again, it feels like the fans are the ones who are really getting shorted here.  If you want to make them available as an optional add-on, great - but don't force us to pay for them if we want the entire season.
B001O1O71C|5.0|This was one of the most heartwarming stories i have read in my life! I loved it!!!!! Can't wait to watch the movie
B002HJ9PTO|2.0|I got these mic's because they were cheap. I purchased two and only one worked, the other would never stop making terrible feedback sounds so I returned it. The other worked fine but if it recorded for more than a few minutes it made terrible popping sounds, I tried everything and they would not go away, it ruined a recording session and I returned that one as well.<br /><br />The only reason Im giving it 2 stars instead of one is because they had an ok return policy.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Awesome and just love it !!! Great game to play if you trying to relax after a long days work.
0385743564|5.0|Brandon Sanderson once again stuns me with his impressive writing talents. Within the first several pages I was already captivated by the story. The characters were well developed and easy to relate to. The action was well paced and the premise of the story was intriguing.<br /><br />Sure you never really find out what caused Calamity and created all of the Epics. This does not matter to the story though. I like how Sanderson left that part to the reader's imagination. I also enjoyed the many twists and turns of the story. I was able to figure out parts, but the final twist still surprised me. The best part of the story was how much Sanderson gets you to care about the characters. He truly has a gift of character creation.<br /><br />Another wonderful facet of the book is the many societal lessons imparted. While one does not need to fully grasp these lessons to enjoy the story they do add to the quality of the book.<br /><br />I would recommend Steelheart to all fans of Sanderson's books as well as all fans of fantasy stories. They will not be disappointed.
B005LAIGQ4|5.0|It was relevant to our time.  The acting was very good. I found myself identifying with Drew Barrymore's character and wanting desperately to free the whales.  I liked very much that it was a united effort, eventually, with the US government and the Russians, hopefully resulting in further efforts to work together.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Enjoyed the music and its very fun like the color and archery like style.it's a game most any adults would find enjoyable to pass the time
B002N5N5R0|5.0|This is definitely when the series hits it's stride (okay I've not watched beyond here so I'm assuming). After the promise of the first season this really amps it up. By giving us a &#34;big bad&#34; (using the Whedon parlance), we're more engaged with the characters, while the clubs internal strife is equally monumental creating an important balance within the show. All the acting is great with the exception of a few extras or one liners but I'm assuming there's more going on behind the scenes then we even know. Definitely check this series out if you haven't already, you won't be disappointed.
B001O1O71C|5.0|Wow. This book is heartwrenching, I mean... Wow. Being able  to see the world through such innocent eyes is a touching experience.
B00EA8UEZ4|5.0|Having Read The \\"DISAPPEARANCE OF THE UNIVERSE\\",\\" iMMORTAL REALITY\\", and thereby discovered \\"A COURSE IN MIRACLES\\", I realize that what i have read is a choice between a world that has never made sense to me since i was a little child and another chance to sum it all up by choosing to believe in a God that is absolute LOVE and everything else that follows after. With all the controversies about the books above, I realize that i have found a peace and a solution at the most difficult period of my life only because i changed my mind about how to think and feel about it. Whatever works for anyone out there should be enoughfor them  to choose how to navigate this senseless world, it should never be that  believing in the principles espoused in Gary's books is a must to find the Answer. Nothing else has ever made this much sense to me. (For a better word, Nothing else has given me so much Peace and a Reason why). What alternative can there ever be to Love?
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Honestly the best book I've read in awhile. I am already downloading book two. Suzanne Collins has a way of bringing you into the story and you don't want it to ever end. Can't wait to see what's in store for Katniss and Peeta in book two. This is a must must read.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|This remarkable book was pure reading pleasure.  The cast of characters, especially one named Boris, are complex and intriguing.  They become real, surely someone you know.  We understand why they behave as they do because Donna Tartt provides solid underpinnings for their actions.  There is humor, sadness, adventure, mystery, tragedy, and hope.  You can forgive the few somewhat improbable situations because you know life is even more unbelievable.  No spoiler here; read and be ensnared by this rich and rewarding novel.
B007SGM084|5.0|Great! I fell in love immediately with all of the characters.  It's a sensationally intelligent, sexy journey that I didn't want to end!
B005LAII94|1.0|Within the first five minutes, I wanted to turn this movie off--as soon as she said in the voice over, the eyeroll-worthy \\"wargasms\\", I had had enough.  I have very little patience for movies lately.<br />Even so, I forced myself to continue watching--it's Oliver Stone, right?<br />Oh, but it gets worse, because \\"O\\" then watches a video of decapitated heads and has no human reaction.  \\"Oh, like people being tortured and beheaded, like. um, sigh and stuff\\"  And whilst the \\"men\\" then discuss this dangerous new development--another drug cartel wishing to take them over with threats of death included, the dingbat girlfriend joins the conversation and all but twirls her hair and bats her eyes and says, \\"Let's, like, go party and stuff!\\"  I paraphrase, forgive me.<br /><br /> Is she concerned with this seething, vicious threat to herself, her way of living, or to these two men that she supposedly loves SO much?  No!  Gee, I would be.  But, you know, that's just me.<br /><br />They plan to leave the country, escape the cartel, and what does she do next?  She goes to the mall!!!!!  And the morons LET her!!  Because, you know, when attempting to double cross a clever drug cartel, I always plan on calmly, dreamily promenading through department stores, making innumerable purchases, and changing into new clothes--WHILE I'M SHOPPING.<br />IN THE REAL WORLD,  I'd be freaking out, terrified that something bad would happen, I'd leave immediately--Stone could have milked that part of the film, he could have really saturated it with such incredible suspense and genuine fear, it could have been so gripping.  But he destroyed it all. What a lost opportunity.<br /><br />I guess I'm expecting more from people in their twenties, whether potheads or no, a serious situation is a serious situation, right?  These people act like thirteen year olds, like my nephew, just very unaware of consequences. It was infuriating to watch.<br /><br />As for the rest of the movie, the twists and turns, the brutality, eh.  It was okay.  I think Salma Hayek was good in her role, but I don't like the relationship that was developed between her character and O, it, too, was off and contrived.  All of them seemed like cartoon characters, or caricatures, they should have been drawn with far more gravity, then the film would have been fascinating.
B0054SMIH6|5.0|Matthew McConaughey played the character well.  I read the book and for the most part the actors were a good match for the characters in the book.  There are always some changes from the book to the movie.... but that's to be expected.  It was exciting and action filled.
B00G91Z8AQ|5.0|Don't think, Just buy it already.  Best superman movie by far,  More of a sci-fi thriller than a comic book movie
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|There is very little support currently, because Google still hasn't released the SDK. I'm expecting more streaming services to start supporting it when that happens. In the meantime, it works great with youtube and Netflix, which is definitely worth the low price tag.
0385504225|4.0|Dan Brown's books are fun when you are visiting the places he writes about.  The narratives are simple but story structure is solid.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|The best part about this game is that even though there are &quot;gems&quot; that you can buy to get more skills, you can get them through pvp or 10 a day by cycling the daily lottery until you see them. This keeps the game from being a limited buyers only app like so many others. Classes, skill trees, gear/weapons, sockets on gear to further personalize your character.. Its great. We just need more people to join in on the pvp goodness. Don't hesitate; try this game.
B002MW50KO|3.0|Living in the UK, the tradition of accomplished Singer/songwriters recording Christmas albums seems a little baffling, regurgitating well worn songs you’ve heard a million times before.<br />So it was kind of inevitable that Dylan (being the subversive soul that he is) would record his interpretation of this musical tradition.<br />Bob must have been a fan of the 1940’s-50’s style of Xmas music, as most the album has been recorded in that style, quite syrupy with male & female backing singers (which does magnify Dylan’s short cummings as singer).<br />The most successful tracks on the album (“The Christmas Blues” & “Silver Bells”) are the ones that have been stripped down with Dylan performing solo, but the absolute highlight is the Pogue’s inspired “Must be Santa”, a bona-fide Yule-tied classic.<br />Very much a tongue in cheek, almost anti-Christmas (kind of a punk mentality) album & quite fun to play on Xmas day to folk who have know Idea who his nibs is!
0307592731|5.0|I loved this book because it was heroic and honest. Not often do you come across a contemporary book that gets into the nutty gritty of life without being didactic and ultimately leaves you inspired.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I saw the second movie yesterday and read the third book right after, what a wonderful way to follow to the end and come to peace.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game. it gets hard at times sometimes luck is what you need to beat a level. wish they helped you out more by giving more free hammers
B00BEIYMAG|4.0|Great suspense movie without all of the blood and gore.  Watched it on Halloween....if you like suspenseful, scary movies...you will probably like this one.  Shipping time was great...arrived within a few days.
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|The plot was interesting though, like all Bond films, it required occasional suspension of realism.  The movie was darker than earlier Bond films, with less of the swagger and &#34;cool factor&#34; and not so many fantastic gadgets.  It dwells a bit on the problems of aging participants, for instance, showing a little more depth of character and even a bit of self-doubt in the principals.  The film has a great deal of violence including many killings, but it doesn't dwell on gruesome depictions of injuries and mutilated bodies.  All in all, it's a fun escapist couple of hours.
B0079XPUOW|3.0|I did like this book, but honestly I don't understand how it won the Hugo for 2013.  Firstly, and least importantly, it's a very short book, barely a novel, not including the codas. I'll get to that later.  Secondly, in no way is it the best SciFi of 2013, IMO.<br /><br />I really liked the idea of the book, even though most of the plot is patently obvious to us seasoned SciFi fans.  Even if the plot is predictable, it still brought a smile to my face when those predictable events happened.  The one thing that did catch me off guard was the revealing of who the actual &#34;protagonists&#34; were.  That was kind of smart and I enjoyed that. I thought the part of the book that is roughly equivalent to the ST4:TVH plot line felt a little too rushed and too quick to come to conclusion. Things just seemed to work themselves out a little to easily.  Also, the way the end was supposedly resolved was very confusing, and seemed to go counter to the rest of the novel.  The final &#34;swap&#34; was not explained properly and I have a feeling that Scalzi didn't really think it through well enough to come up with an explanation.  Given that the novel was so short, I felt like the author just needed to get something out the door, and should have spent more effort in coming up with an elegant description of the finale.<br /><br />As far as the codas go, the first one is just a joke. Completely unreadable. Filler only. I have a sad feeling that it was required to meet some kind of word count or something. The second coda is readable, and good. The third coda is simply wonderful. It's sweet, thoughtful, sad, and everything else you wanted to read at the end of the novel. It really could have been integrated into the main part of the work, but I understand that Scalzi wanted a comedy and the emotions of the third coda may have worked against the rest of the novel.<br /><br />The best part about this book is that it introduced me to Scalzi -- I had not read any of his works before this. Scalzi, if you are reading this, you'll be happy to know that I have how purchased many of your novels, I enjoy them all (to various degrees), and I'll probably be purchasing more.s. Scalzi, if you are reading this, you'll be happy to know that I have how purchased many of your novels, I enjoy them all (to various degrees), and I'll probably be purchasing more.
0753827662|5.0|I almost didn't finish this book. Contrary to most of the other reviewers, I thought it started rather slow, polished, perfectionist writing, but we 'we seen that before. I am glad I didn't quit. Ms.Flynn's writing is multidimensional, carefully layered, thought out perfection, the acknowledgements chapter was as interesting for me as the novel. Good work!
B002SJKWZ4|5.0|This was a gift for teenage Harry Potter fan.  She loves it!<br />She has programmed all the electronics in her room and uses this wand to control them.<br />Her friends are impressed as well.
0788859544|5.0|For my granddaughter - she has watched it on tv over and over. Good movie for children's entertainment. Excellent Christmas gift.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|These were super easy for my granddaughter to put on the walls herself. Very pretty and very fun for her to help with the decorating.
B00GH4R95C|5.0|Great movie.....perfect superman....casting was great...kept me interested entire movie...highly recommend!!! I'm EXTREMELY picky about movies and money spent....worth every penny.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|By the time the movie is almost over you will probably have figured out just where it fits in with a great, well-known series of sci-fi movies.  I won't spoil the delight you should feel when that happens; I will just say that this one should not be missed.  Enjoy!
B00BAXFJ5M|4.0|When they almost run down a teenaged boy in the rain one night, Sean and Michelle stumble into more than just a boy running from a bit of bad news. What starts out as a seemingly cut and dried story too familiar to them all – boy loses father in Afghanistan – turns into something much more involved than either could have ever expected. Will this be the case that finally proves to be too much for the former secret service agents or will they find a way to pull it off in style? Not even they know for sure this time.<br /><br />Sean King and Michelle Maxwell are both former secret service agents turned private investigators, each for their own reasons. Despite their glaring differences – Sean’s a neat freak and Michelle’s a slob, for one – they make these differences work for them by using them to spur the other into thinking outside the box. Their deep friendship, insatiable curiosity, and thirst for seeing justice done makes their partnership a successful one.<br /><br />Probably one of the best part of this novel is the reversal of stereotypes in that Michelle is the one who is the one you need to be afraid of and not Sean. She’s the tougher fighter and she’s also the better shot. She’s also just a touch on the crazy side, too, if you ask me, but that’s all just part of her enduring charm.<br /><br />This is my first novel by this author, but I can guarantee you that it will not be my last. Not only does he create loveable, endearing characters that stick in your mind long after you’ve finished, but he also has a way of infusing humor into the most intense and serious situations, giving the novel a nice balance. The intense action coupled with a well-developed and highly believable storyline combine for an exciting read.<br /><br />Originally posted at Long and Short Reviews
B008JFUTUY|5.0|Searching For Sugarman is a Good story and movie. Good family movie and one that is a story of hope.
B00G6ZTM3Y|3.0|I have played it on xbox but it will not download it keeps saying download error and I'm starting to get sick of it<br />other than that its a great game should try to download
B009LDD5E0|5.0|Love the TV series Glee. Talented group!  Want to stay current with all of their works, both in DVD format as well as CD's. Quick turnaround time. Thank you!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I enjoy this game you can advance faster by buying stuff but play longed by just waiting for everything to recharge.
B00DB624GS|5.0|I was born in 1956, and, thank God, my secondary school years fell in the 60s. Which meant that I grew up with Dylan, Hendrix, The Doors, The Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, Family, Audience et al. One band that was talked of then but not much listened to by my circle of friends was Fleetwood Mac. My first Fleetwood Mac album was the famous 'Rumours', which I love, but regard as merely a top-flight commercial album. So yesterday I found a 5-album box set, which includes an un-remastered version of this album (Then Play On). I have been listening to it non-stop for a day! I just can't leave it alone, but will soon have to because I like it so much that I cannot run the risk of over-doing it. This is the very best of 60s hippie music. It was worth waiting 40 years for this. And I will buy the deluxe remastered version, but don't be fooled, this version I have sounds so cool retro with the hissing, just like an old vinyl LP. It all adds to the overall enjoyment!
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I enjoyed that there weren't a bunch of wacky ideas or things that could not possibly be implemented by the average person. The chapters were clear and concise and gave concrete examples and suggestions. The included profile is not overly lengthy. My husband and I felt that the book gave us good discussion points and ideas of how to better love each other, although our marriage is already strong.
1594484805|4.0|I like it. But I didn't finish reading this book so I couldn't rate this yet. I hope I could give 5 star for this after reading through.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I read all of these books in less than three days. One of my all time favorite series for sure.
1596680296|5.0|This book is great for beginners and experts, really! I recommend starting at page one and moving along through the pages one by one. Start with the basic sock, it's green and starts with about thirty stitches. It goes step by step through making a very basic heel and gusset sock. I have tried many &#34;beginner patterns&#34; for socks that left me in tears. But this book can really guide you through every little detail from start to finish. If you are an expert, this book is for you too. There a tons of helpful hints, like how to ensure both socks are exactly the same, and how to close up any annoying little holes in the gusset. The patterns are quite simple, and some are just silly. But the point is that you are learning. I wont lie, there are a few times where I get a bit confused and turn to you tube or if I'm lucky, a knitting club with some ladies who can help me out. It's not that the book is wrong, it's that learning to read a pattern is like learning a new language, and sometimes you'll need an interpreter. This was my first sock book, and now I have three, each one with it's own benefits. I am glad I found this one. I'll keep it forever.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I'm not much of a reader but decided to try this book. I must say I could not put it down. Powerfully story between a father and his son.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Wow - What a let-down from the first two books... I spent the whole book waiting for something to happen that never did. Very disappointing...
6305428042|5.0|This is our favorite Halloween movie.  It's great to own it.  Now we don't have to wait each year and wonder when it might come on.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Another great read from John Green. I have yet to be disappointed with anything John and Hank put their marks on. I will keep searching from now until oblivion.
B00E8S2KV2|5.0|The extended version is long but fun. If you thought the movie version lagged or was too long already-don't get this.<br /><br />If you loved it in theaters and wanted more-get this.
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|Love Paul's new album.  I heard an interview on NPR discussing the new album, so I decided to buy it.  I love all the new songs!  Paul remains a true artist with great lyrics and appealing songs.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham books keep me reading straight to the end.  The who, what, and why and the surprising endings keep me riveted.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Loved this book. Have learned from experience by losing my husband after 28 years together at the age of 46, that are days are numbered. I have always believed that. I am now remarried and have been given the gift of a second life. Many times I wanted to die, but God has plans for us that we don't understand. I have read all of Mitch Alboms books and have found inspiration in every one. He is definitely one of my favourite authors.
B00BAXFAOW|4.0|I think this is overall a terrific book.  Gladwell discusses a number of situations where underdogs might prevail.  Gladwell's writing style is interesting and very accessible.  If I had one criticism, I suppose it is sometimes hard to see how certain chapters tie together or to the larger concept.  I think towards the end, Gladwell's discussion doesn't quite fit the overall topic.  That said, I still think the work discussed and Gladwell's writing makes this a compelling read.
B0064T6LV8|1.0|No option to keep the screen from moving with the ball. Flippers move out of view when ball is at the top of the table.

B009UX2YAC|4.0|I really liked this game. Great for kids and even adults and is pure addicting. It may be blotchy at times but overall great!

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|so addictive!  it is hard to stop playing. kind of annoying about the time out lives; but it does make you stop playing.
B00CATSONE|4.0|Having been a suscessful electrician in my working life, I wish I had read about tesla when I was an apprentice. The insite into a man who invented so much, I found very hard to undestand even when it was explained. How a man could discover ( electfricty was discovered not invented. ) is beyond me.

B000OWAFPE|5.0|Delightful characterizations, good story, and good memories. I'm too old to care much for cartoons, but this one gave me a happy heart. I especially liked the bird telling about his &#34;alien abduction&#34;.
B002BWP49C|5.0|Love the Twilight series.  Now all all of them.  If you like science fiction and romance you will love this movies.
B00003CXDV|5.0|I love this silly movie. Good parody on Star Trek, lots of fun, good actors, character development,  and a good ending...what more could you ask for?
B005OCFHHK|1.0|this review is for the harry potter complete 8-film collection(Blu-ray}, this set is complete garbage! I don't know much about tech stuff but the picture on almost every one of these blu-rays is so dark that they are not worth watching, i don't know if it is how they were transferred to Blu-ray or what but i have watched them all on cable at 1080i and they were very good, thought they would be great on Blu-ray 1080/24p, i am so unhappy with these after spending $61.95 on them, I AM THROWING THEM IN THE GARBAGE CAN!, DONT BUY THIS SET AT ANY PRICE! I have a sony xbr52hx909 tv and a sony bdp-s790 blu ray player, cant get much better than that, the only way i can watch these blu rays is to set my tv on vivid, brightness on 68, and sharpness set to 80, which makes the picture very grainy so you have to sit at least 10 feet away from the tv to watch, otherwise there is no detail, no contrast, everything is so black, no contrast, its like they were filmed in a room with only 1 candle for lighting. guess i'll have to look elsewhere for a different set, which really sucks after spending $61.95, im on social security and that is almost a weeks money for food.
B000FBJHT4|5.0|I have no way of knowing if all Corso says is true, but it makes a fascinating and plausible story.
B00EI4V3X2|5.0|After reading all of the other reviews, I decided to take go ahead and purchase this headset.  I've owned a few headsets off and on for PC gaming, including the Ear Force X12.  I absolutely love PX4.  It's the first set I've owned that I felt worked fairly well right out of the box, the wireless setup was easy and the audio quality is superb.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this headset to anyone who just wants a great sounding, comfortable, almost 100% wireless headset.  I don't talk on the PSN much, so after I connect the headset, I usually just unplug the cord between the controller and headset, enjoying the freedom of wireless surround sound while sitting on my couch.  I am highly anticipating the future PS4 Bluetooth patch that will allow this set to be truly 100% wireless, but this is as good as you can get right now.<br /><br />My only complaint is that there are a few pieces of information missing from the included instructions, it's pretty obvious it was all printed up long before the PS4 actually launched, so there are no instructions included.  You may need to pair your headset with the base after you take it out of the box, and instructions on how to do so are not included.  Additonally, there is no information included in the box relating to what the 6 different surround sound options are (these can be rotated through using the base) nor what the tone and limiter buttons do.  Luckily, all that information can be quickly found on the Turtle Beach website at this address: [...]<br /><br />I do not feel like this headset is made with low-quality materials.  It is great quality for the price.  If you get this headset for your PlayStation or Xbox, I do not think you will be disappointed.<br /><br />This is my first Amazon Review, I hope it is informative!
B00000IQW3|4.0|Charming story, fun and exciting (well, maybe not so exciting for old ladies, but fast-paced enough to seem so).  It probably is a story for teenagers but I like these kinds of stories where Mr. Nobody gets to be the hero.
B00E5N8DGG|5.0|Tihis was awesome, Def Leppard rocks!!! I love  them, was not able to see them in Vegas, glad they made this.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|Good cast of characters without the phony, Hollywood southern accents that make most movies like this suck.  The background was very authentic.
1577314808|3.0|okay for a textbook.  Not really my kind of reading but I needed it for a college course I took.
B00EY8BRGU|2.0|This movie was lame and not worth the rental fee.  I wish I would have just taken a nap instead.
B00AEFY3MC|5.0|Funny movie, I can watch it again and again.  A great spoof of Star Trek.  All the actors do a great job in this movie.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|Good game just need to be easier to gain crowns to get other objects. Mire like t h e coins.
B00DJUPLY8|2.0|As much as I'd like to rate this application higher, I can't, due to the fact that the first WMV file I tried to view using GoodPlayer would not play! I know the creators worked hard on this program, but there remains to be more work done on it to do what it claims to do.
B00395ZYVS|4.0|Much of the culture of India and it's conflict with western values is exposed in this enlightening story of a female Indian child abandoned to an orphanage at birth. Her adoption follows and her progression to adulthood makes for an interesting story. The bonding between the people of East and West cultures is encouraging and augers well for the closely knit multicultural society that the world incremently progresses towards.
B00GH4R95C|5.0|What a movie best Superman movie that i have seen so far. Love the special effects and glad that they spent a little more time around Krypton too.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This was a fun one to play with my daughter. Not to hard but not to easy either. Only wish it was longer. :)
B0015DYIH2|5.0|It keeps you enthralled and saddened that the story has ended I want more but understand it must end.  The flowing of the story line is wonderful. Easy to keep pace with all elements of the storyline.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|A little clunky to set up and operate, but once you figure it out, a treat to see movies on the big asreen.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I really enjoyed this Clancy collaboration. Much better than some of his recent works. Brought back memories of staying up all night finishing the sum of all fears ( I read that in one sitting, actually called out from work!)
B00EQRMAJW|5.0|John Legend does it again! 'Love In The Future' ranks up there with 'Once Again', one of my favorite CDs of all-time. These songs are coming from a man deeply in love - love that radiates in every note of every lyric of every beat.<br /><br />&#34;You and I&#34; - John reassures his lady that she doesn't have to do much to be beautiful. What others think doesn't matter. Besides, &#34;ain't nobody in the world but you and I.&#34; Amazing!<br />&#34;Hold On Longer&#34; - The chord progression is new to my ears and absolutely beautiful. The waltz tempo, the violin arrangement, and the lyrics are just mesmerizing.<br />&#34;Open My Eyes&#34; - I can't imagine anyone else remaking this Bobby Caldwell classic. John does the song justice as he ushers it into the 21st Century to introduce it to a different generation of music lovers.<br />&#34;For The First Time&#34; - A ballad of discovery and liberation. John Legend soars in bliss during the chorus.<br />Interludes: &#34;Angel&#34; ft Stacy Barthe/ &#34;What If I Told You?&#34; - These interludes really fill in the gaps of the album to make it feel complete and special. I have always loved Stacy Barthe and appreciate that she is getting exposure with well-established artists. Her vocal style is gorgeous.<br />&#34;All Of Me&#34; - Another ballad celebrating the natural beauty of his betrothed (dang! this man is in love!)<br /><br />Why John Legend named this CD 'Love In The Future' is beyond me. He is definitely in the presence and recognizing the state of love he is experiencing now. This is certainly a CD for lovers, but it's also for those of us looking to fall in love. I believe in it and know this is what it will feel like in my future. 5 Stars!

B00AKL1XPU|3.0|I just didn't like this. I was not for me. I didn't really want a game I had to get a bunch of friends to play.
B007T8BYWE|5.0|This is a very fun app with neat puzzles that challenge your brain and helps keep it sharp. If you like this one the others are just as fun.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Great little app. Perfect for checking on my twitter updates and info. Works really well. No problems. Highly recommended cool app.
B004XIZN5M|4.0|one of the best books on bodywieght training. of course overcoming gravity is THE best but its a hard read. this is a great primer to getting to overcoming gravity. the problem with this book is the glorification of prison culture. that aspect of this book reads (and looks) like it was written by an impressionable 12 year old. even the guy they get to demonstrate the exercises (who is an accomplished athlete and clean cut guy) they put &#34;gang/prison&#34; attire. ridiculous. just ignore that stuff and you got a great book. don't let that garbage deter you from getting this book.
B007ZGO7EM|1.0|55-5*2= 45, right?  Not so in this app, where that expression equals 100. That's how calculators operated 40 years ago!  And since there are no parenthesis in calculator &quot;plus&quot;, you have to pre-arrange your expression in your head. Really, really bad!
0811870987|5.0|Got this for my 12 year-old niece, who had announced an interest in nature.  She loved it.  The pictures go far beyond standard idenfication photos to be artistic, sometimes spectacular images.
B00B5HQLMI|3.0|He is no James 007 Bond. We are missing the charisma of the beauty of the male character. Where is the Wolverine.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|A great read....we are back where Grisham started, it was great meeting all of the characters again.  Seemed like old, classic, Grisham.  Every Grisham fan will appreciate it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Totally enjoyable. I Compete with my family and friends by egging each other on with trash talk.  I recommend it highly. It's fun and challenges me.  LOVE IT. Call me ADDICTED
B00DYEBM3I|5.0|If your a Mazzy Star fan then you have waited patiently for this album and it has been completely worth the wait and this purchase is a no-brainer.<br />Anyone who has heard their work before will love the familiar sounds in your ears and if your new to Mazzy then give 'em a listen. You won't be disappointed.
0956721591|5.0|I have read this book over and read over again. I know most of the French by heart. It has really helped me move from 'intermediate' French to reading real books. Somehow in reading this book, French has become more transparent to me. Considering the things I have picked up from this one book, it's worth it's price several times over!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|after the first two this book is a significant let down.  the writing is monotonous and downright boring but you have to plug through just to reach the most depressing ending. as a fan of the first two it's impossible not to read it but i am disappointed.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Great device and good substitute for expensive alternatives like Roku and Apple TV. This is for non-Smart TV users like me. I am enjoying the 3 month free Netflix now. The code redemption was complicated but it got sorted out in one call with netflix. Device performance is great.
B009NF54ZE|4.0|Great little game. Hidden object, puzzles, word scrambles lost of mini games to keep things from getting repetitive just a down right fun little game. I play on a tablet and didn't miss the zoom not being there. Not sure I would play it on my phone.
B00428LIXO|5.0|My little girl is in the stage of pounding on things so she will LOVE this!!!  Even better it plays sounds and music, unlike the pots and pans she uses now.
B00FJSSK1O|3.0|Finally Epica have released a live dvd accompanied by a full orchestra and choir. It has taken too long as they have been deserving of such a show for such a long time. Hell even Nightwish haven't released a live dvd with an orchestra and they were one of the pioneers behind the symphonic metal growth seen in the past 20 years. They are arguably the biggest and most well known band for this genre and yet Epica have beaten them to it and fully deserving Epica are of such a show.<br /><br />However let's get straight on with the major issue this release has.... Whoever was in charge of the lighting for the show went and f****d up. The lighting is horrible and it ruins the entire show from a visual stand point. Throughout the whole show the lights glare on the cameras in a way extremely unpleasant way. The majority of the time you can't see the band as they are obscured from view. and other times they have lighting that would be better suited to a dance concert and is very out of place, during the Phantom Agony for example they have green lasers that would more at home in a nightclub. There are times when the lighting tones down, during softer orchestral parts and this is how the lighting should have been throughout the whole show. A great example of how lighting should be done is Kamelot's One Cold Winters Night, that dvd release was perfect in terms of presentation.<br /><br />This is a real shame because the actual music is fantastic, everyone performed very well and everyone for the brief moments you can actually see the band seems to be enjoying it immensely. Appearances from past members of the band and Floor Jansen were great and added a great emotion to the experience as it really brought the last 10 years together<br /><br />The set list is huge and gives 3 hours from a huge catalogue. From a personal stand point I was disappointed they didn't do Mother of Light fully and only included it in the orchestral medley and I would love to have heard Tides of Time asSimone's vocal performance on the studio version was phenomenal , but complaining and marking the show down based upon set list when it was so long anyway would be too harsh.<br /><br />There is good behind the scenes footage and interviews with the band which is a welcome addition, Simone is awesome as ever &#60;3<br /><br />Ultimately if you get this you will I think love the CD's because as I said the sound is great and listening to it in the car is great, the dvd's have let the band down tremendously though. Whoever decided on this lighting should never ever be allowed to make any decisions ever again with regards to live shows for this band.<br /><br />What could have been Epica's crowning achievement has instead finished as a huge disappointment of what could have been. They may never release another live dvd like this again. Hiring a full orchestra and choir isn't cheap and there was a time when the band said they weren't even going to release a live dvd at all because the costs involved weren't justifiable for the size of the band.<br /><br />It is with a heavy heart I have to rate this only 3 stars. As a huge Epica fan I am disappointed and hope sincerely they have a chance in the future to set right the wrongs of this show.<br /><br />P.S<br /><br />I notice also some people on other reviews I have submitted defending my criticism of the lighting saying things like &#34;well it doesn't matter&#34; or &#34;the visuals are not important&#34;. To this I ask you how?<br /><br />It is a dvd release a media format that has a much to do with the visual experience as it does with the audio. If the purpose was just the music (which is superb) then it would have made more logical sense to have released a live cd, it would have been cheaper and easier for Epica to have done so. Fact is someone messed up and Epica fans feeling the need to defend the band they love and choose to look past such a glaring mistake. This is called being a fan boy whereby no negative criticism is allowed to be placed at the feet of the band you love.<br /><br />To that I say a real fan will criticize every aspect of a show they deem unworthy in order to hopefully give enough constructive feedback that mistakes can be corrected and the experience improved for the future. You owe it to yourself and more so the band to be honest about what they can improve upon to make them an even greater band<br /><br />5 stars performance<br />5 stars set list<br />5 stars extras<br />1 star lighting
B003B02O0A|5.0|A true page turner. Once  you start you will not was my to put it down. Grisham at his best.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Not much apps on the device. Pse look into the possibility to add more apps onto the device so that we have more choices on wat to watch
B005GRTNXC|5.0|I think that Leona is underrated like other singers who actually have raw talent unlike what we have been seeing for the last decade or so. This is definitely a good buy if you are a fan of singers like Mariah Carey or Whitney Houston (RIP).
B002VUFKG6|2.0|Part of the book I enjoyed.  Much of the book had too many quotes and too many detail on the marriage concept.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|What a great book - it is one of the best books I have read in a long time.  I felt like I knew the characters by the end of the book.  I will definitely look for other work by this author.
1455525839|3.0|This was one of Preston & Child's better books with a few exceptions.  I thought the storyline good and it highlighted the fact that a lot of the old monied people around had their fortunes made by ancestors who were cold hearted bastards to those they employed (think Henry Ford)!  Also it highlighted the insane greed of the very wealthy and their utter disregard for the people whose life's are ruined by the wealthy's never ending lust for  \\" more \\" ( see Rick's comment about Rocky in \\"Key Largo\\")<br />  What I detested about the book was Corrie!  The woman is a stupid, self-centered, long over due for death, ass,  I found myself cheering when the authors made it appear she had finally had suffered the fate she so richly had worked<br />for at the hands of Ted only to be disappointed to find out she had lived!  Please P& C leave her out of you future books .<br />  I liked Pendergast better because he seemed more believable.  In their past few books he had become Superman with a black suit.  For example having someone speak four languages fluently might be believable but having someone speak 40 languages fluently is not!  I have long wanted the Pendergast of \\"Relic\\" back for his more believable character.<br />  Finally, was it just me or did many of you immediately feel that Ted was to good to be true and was probably a villain?<br />  I want to thank the authors for bringing up PTSD as something real that combat veterans suffer from.  I spent to combat tours in Viet Nam and every time I lay my head down I dread sleet because of the invariable nightmares that follow!<br />  All in all a readable book.  Not one of their best but certainly not one of the worst.<br />Kent Hartsoe
B000LB7G00|3.0|I'm going to knock this based on my experiences using in Revit and Sketchup.  I thought this might be helpful with modeling.  For me, it turned out to be a novelty best used for smooth flybys/walk thrus or twirling schematic designs around in perspective for clients to view on screen.  Keyboard shortcuts are necessary of course, and I found it inconvenient having to move the hand back and forth to the joystick rather than just holding down the shift button while moving my mouse around precisely with my dominant hand to orbit, pan etc.  No doubt this is a quality instrument, and very precise and sensitive in all axes (which are all integrated together and springy).  Also, max sensitivity settings still didn't allow me to navigate around fast enough for my preference in Google Earth (but that isn't the mouse's fault).  In the end, simply not worth the $90, man!
B001223BLU|5.0|The songs sound great and its a perfect mix of their hits. Brings back memories from when my Mom bought them for me on 8 track. I do love my Jersey boys.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book made me laugh and made me cry. I think Stephen Chbosky has created a masterpiece. Maybe this is because I am just a hormonal teenager myself, but I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />Charlie became my best friend as I flipped every page because he understood. Charlie is every lost teen kid. As you go through highschool and try to figure out who you are, you get in trouble, and you cry and you make friends, and break your heart, and try to fix it.<br />Honestly I wish that I did get these letters in the mail. Because this book made me feel infinite. I think that every time you take a drive after reading this book is going to be forever changed. I would recommend this book to any teenager out there, so long as you know the birds and the bees already.<br />One thing this book didn't do was censor the life of high school. Yes, there are drugs, and gays, and sex, and parties, and everything inbetween.<br />Because this book was real. You really got to see the mind of a boy named Charlie who is just trying to be happy and figure out who he is.<br />“So, I guess we are who we are for a lot of reasons. And maybe we'll never know most of them. But even if we don't have the power to choose where we come from, we can still choose where we go from there. We can still do things. And we can try to feel okay about them.” - Perks of being a Wallflower<br /><br />I wouldn't change anything about this book, because if I did then it would be Charlie anymore. The real story of a kid named Charlie.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This series ends so strongly because it is both unpredictable and satisfying.  In spite of the unrealistic setting, the story ends in a more realistic way and I applaud the author for doing so.  I loved this series and I loved getting to know the characters throughout all three books.
B0018QOIXU|4.0|This was a gift which I have not given yet - however I have heard the songs on this CD and they are very good - not as great as the 21 CD - but worth having as Adele's debut album.  We gave our friends the 21 CD and they loved it so we were sure they would also enjoy the 19 CD
B00GO95BUU|1.0|And this price jumping is why people pirate. Shooting yourselves in the foot, if not the face! boo booo and boo
B004YAS9N2|5.0|This is definitely a five-star collection of Ludovico Einaudi music!<br /><br />However I have a major complaint about the packaging of the CD - it arrived in a bubble-wrap envelope with no additional protection for the CD - unfortunately the CD was stuck to the glue which sealed the envelope.  It was impossible to get the envelope open or detach the CD from the glue without removing the clear plastic shrink-wrap on the CD.  This was supposed to be a gift for a November 28th occasion.  I was very upset because you cannot give an unsealed CD as a gift without looking like you're giving a hand-me down CD.  There was no time to re-order this CD in time.<br />P.S.  I have a second order of this CD which is also a gift for someone else - it will be arriving in a few days - hopefully it will be shipped intact...
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|the Game Downloaded Without Problem But Simply Would Not Run. I Allowed It Several Opportunities But It Continued To Crash.Very Disappointed.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I was hooked before finishing the introduction! This book hurts your heart in a beautiful way. This one will stay with you for a long while.
B003V1WST6|4.0|I'm somewhat torn about this book. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it. The writing was great, the conflict was awesome, I laughed, I choked up at times and I tore through the pages at a very fast pace. My issue might be the fact that I am from New York City and as a local, I had to seriously suspend reality while reading and really remove myself and my own experiences in New York while reading. The idea of a relatively &#34;ordinary&#34; woman moving to New York City and having the world basically fall at her feet within a week was hard to swallow. A hot sweet hipster and a rich Wall Street Guy both completely into her with zero effort on her part, a great career opportunity that was basically offered to her on a platter, wearing all designer clothes, hanging out at all of the coolest places etc. I think it was just a bit too &#34;Sex and the City&#34; for my taste especially since the main character led a completely different type of life in London. I also kept wanting Angela to feel just a bit more guilty about dating two guys at the same time with such intensity. There was some internal conflict but not enough for me. I did, however, fall madly in love with Alex...<br /><br />Despite the unrealistic aspect, I really did enjoy this book and love this author in general!
1401937519|2.0|Although I admire Ms. Moorjani for her ordeal with life and near-death,<br />frankly I found the book a bit boring, repetitious and sometimes even<br />confusing.  I am a writer and the title of the book is quite creative...<br />congratulations on this. But the content of the book left me confused and<br />rather empty. Not enough substance, very light writing to represent such<br />a profound event in anyone's life, illness, death and resurrection.
B00GH4RKYM|2.0|It lacked warmth and soul. The actress choice for Lois Lane was unfortunate. Just another Hollywood attempt to make up for a good story line by using special effects...sorry guys, it didn't work.
B00A2H9PLG|2.0|Exciting but very silly plot. You really must have an overactive imagination to watch this movie. This could never happen. Jamie Foxx's lines are often stupid and not presidential which makes his character totally unbelievable as the leader of the free world. Channing Tatum is following after Bruce Willis' character John McClane in the Die Hard series as he does the impossible time after time. There were two &#34;White House&#34; movies this year along with Olympus Has Fallen and both are based on the same idea and both are not very good. Olympus in my opinion is the better of the two. I recommend going out for a few beers before attempting to watch either of these 2013 action movies. Rent don't buy.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I was not sure that I would like this series at first but they really sucked me in. I love that it is set in Chicago and I know all the places so well.<br /><br />Revision. I have finished the last book and I am very disappointed. The first two books were great and I had high hopes for this one. I think it just went in a direction  I didn't see coming and the end made me angry. It IS worth reading to see how it all ends. Just be prepared to not be happy.
B00GO95TAC|3.0|It was a great episode but definitely not worth the cost. Save your money for a trip to the cinema and wait till this is available somewhere else. Amazon has disappointed many loyal customers with the increase in price.
B00AW57L96|4.0|The Husbands Secret.<br />A very interesting book.  The twists in it were great and the ending was a real surprise.  Always wanted to turn the page
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|Reviews seem extreme and vague by comparison to other applications. I installed it and now see why there's so much disparity.<br /><br />This application is a tech tool meant for those who have some understanding of the inner ops of the device. Globally removing/initializing everything is definitely going to have a negative impact on the device. Discretion is strongly advised.<br /><br />As for my impression, I found improved memory capacity, but no faster (or slower) responsiveness because of it. This is installed on my Kindle Fire HD. Setting up this app was pretty straightforward. The automatic stuff can cause more problems than it cures so I've inhibited any activity that doesn't alert, inform or otherwise require my &quot;ok&quot; to execute. Some function can be performed directly by the Kindle but it's convenient to have them nested under one interface. I encountered none of the problems other reviewers reported though I didn't perform mass eradication of all folders, data and processes. I will say that it's hard to know what this app has accomplished in terms of process management since I can't say what processes are required to run by the Kindle. When in doubt, I learn or leave it alone - good advice in any environment.<br /><br />I would give this app 5 stars if I knew it better. Having just started to use it, it seems to deliver as described. As a tool, it's effective but nothing extraordinary has developed out of its use. I understand its need to access sensitive files as a part of its function. Permissions seem reasonable accordingly. For now, I trust security is maintained. Given that I really put my Kindle to work (and play), I appreciate a tool that keeps it at optimal performance. This app is free and with careful use, it's a valued addition to my library.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I REALLY LIKE THIS GAME EVERYTHING IS HELPFUL AND EASY TO PLAY I USE TO Play it before but got bored I like playing now. My granddaughter can play and she can understand it.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Love this app! It's so easy to use and customize. I can create alarms to cover the various work schedules I have and add additional alarms for my lunchtime naps. Very happy!
B00AFROVQC|4.0|A fun swashbuckling story. I am hoping the characters will mature with the next book. It is still two diminutional. Likeable<br /> characters and villains but not quite as alive as they could be.
1400069807|5.0|This should be required reading for all. A great book that really opens one's eyes to what one is eating.
B00AMBLDEE|3.0|This latest entry in the Bourne series was very generic somehow.  Contrasted with the very first, it simply pales by comparison.  I found myself somewhat bored by the relentless action, uninvolving plot and poor dialogue.  Perhaps if it were cut by 1/3 or so??
B0012NVGHU|5.0|One of the most beautiful films I've ever had the privilege to watch. A true gem of a story with amazing acting, gorgeous music, and an ending that will make you smile. Don't miss this amazing film.
B005SV9X22|5.0|One of the best concerts I have seen. Lady Gaga goes all out in her performance at Madison Square Garden. I  don't tire of watching it and really enjoy her energy and exceptional talent. I saw her in Ohio of this same concert and will never forget it. She really rocks ! ! !
B0002F6BRE|5.0|I LOVE THIS MOVIE SO MUCH!!!!!! This and &#34;A Christmas Story&#34; comprise our holiday viewing every year. Buddy the Elf RULES!
B00AHXIC50|5.0|WOW - Bruno's music is going thru a change. When it's stated that it's unorthodox, they're not kidding. Gorilla is a real rocker and their video of this is one of the sexiest videos I have ever seen attached to music. Way to go, Bruno ! ! I was sadly surprised to hear M-F'er twice on this CD - I just don't see the need for that. However, the whole CD is great and gets a lot of play from me.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|This is a good story. It took me a while to get into the characters, and I had to put it down a few times to focus on other things but it is definitely worth the investment. Neil Gaiman is awesome.
B00DKY4LBW|5.0|These guys come a long way from 2006's Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not. The thing I love about Arctic Monkeys is their ability to change it up every album, although that might have upset fans with the release of Humbug, which I thought was an awesome album. If you to hear an album while making love to someone or having a beer on the patio and relax, this is the album to get.
B000W93CHC|5.0|Stirring historical fiction that totally captured me. I started to read the series in order to learn more about the architects who built the great cathedrals of Europe. Even though there is little material technical about those great buildings, the stories around the construction of these massive churches bring the Middle Ages to life.
B00GNK18X4|5.0|I've gone on record more than once declaring my appreciation for the power-pop of One Direction, even though it might not be &#34;cool&#34; for someone of my age and gender. In addition to watching them form on X-Factor, I'm just a huge fan of well-delivered, uber-catchy pop/rock. And these guys have delivered with remarkable consistency. Their newest album marks a big shift in sound for them. The bombastic hooks are still there, but somewhere along the line the guys have become a surprisingly credible rock vocal group. I can't recall any other &#34;boyband&#34; release that sounds like this, which is pretty awesome. That said, like their debut album, this one is in dire need of some reshuffling (I just can't deal with Story Of My Life completely stealing the energy as the second track). Here's my track by track review with a twist: below is how I would have sequenced the album, and I think it plays all the better for it.<br /><br />1. Alive - Previously relegated to a bonus track on the ultimate edition, I like this much better as a statement of intent to open the album. Not only is it a big, brash rock song, but its carpe diem theme seems to fit the album as a whole. Wherever this is on the running order, though, it's a total standout with its hair metal riffs and chorus turned up to eleven. 10/10<br /><br />2. Best Song Ever - It's amazing how much bigger this sounds coming as the second track. Though it's been with us for awhile, I'd still say this will probably go down as being the best, most memorable song on here. 10/10<br /><br />3. Diana - Another slab of arena-sized stadium rock, with verses reminiscent of the 80's and a chorus that burrows into your brain straightaway. Continues the rockier direction that I think the first half of the album should stick with. 10/10<br /><br />4. Little White Lies - Of all the tracks, this sounds the most like it would have fit in on the last album. That's a very good thing, as I think the last album will probably go downas the band's high point. The sound is an epically huge mash-up of guitars and electronics, with a sugary chorus. 10/10<br /><br />5. Little Black Dress - Yeah, so I've got the two &#34;little&#34; song titles back to back. But honestly, if they're both on the album anyway, it's the contrast kinda cool to have one after another? This continues the rock streak, so much so that I probably wouldn't have even guessed this was One Direction if I didn't know. It sounds more like the Fratellis or something. 9/10<br /><br />6. Don't Forget Where You Belong - The boys cowrote this with the guys in Mcfly, which were responsible for one of my favorite 1D songs (I Would) and one of my least (I Want). This is completely different from both, and one of the album highlights. A lighters-in-the-air singalong ballad about life on the road, this has a killer chorus. Should be a single, but probably won't. 10/10<br /><br />7. Midnight Memories - One of the harder-edged tracks on here, the title song sounds a lot like Pour Some Sugar On Me with its stomping guitar and electric edge. Not the best example of their newfound rock sensibilities, but it's certainly a new direction for them (though it does sound a bit like an edgier Rock Me from their last album). 9/10<br /><br />8. You And I - You And I - The only other &#34;rock&#34; ballad on the album, this one crept up on me. It's simple most of the way through, but suddenly becomes epic when the music drops out and returns tenfold. It's surprisingly effective. 9/10<br /><br />9. Does He Know - Back to a poppier sound, this retains a strong rock element but there's something much more 80's and &#34;teen pop&#34; about it. Still, it's the perfect bridge between what I see as the album's two halves. 9/10<br /><br />10. Happily - Now we're into the folkier sounds on the album (which sound so much better strung together than they do as separate experiments throughout the running order). This is the biggest and most rollicking of the three, with a huge shout-along chorus and pub atmosphere. 9/10<br /><br />11. Story Of My Life - The second single. It's quite nice on its own, but sounds especially great after Happily. I'm a fan of 1D's ballads generally, but they do tend to drag the energy down if placed too early in the running order. This really needed the bridge Happily provides so as not to sound out of place. 9/10<br /><br />12. Through The Dark - My favorite of the three Mumford & Sons-esque tracks, this is a midtempo, folksy pop song with one hell of a chorus. It didn't hit me on first listen, but has really stood out the more I listen to it. 10/10<br /><br />13. Why Don't We Go There - Back to a rockier sound, though this has strong indie-alternative touches reminiscent of bands like the Killers. Not as strong as the tracks I put toward the beginning, but pleasant enough. 8/10<br /><br />14. Strong -A lot of people are raving about this track, but I find it pretty generic. The melody's nice enough, but there just isn't anything unique about the production, at least for me. It feels more like enjoyable filler. 8/10<br /><br />15. Better Than Words - Back to a funkier, more electronic sound. I wish this became a little more bombastic and fully-formed, but I do love the verse with all their song title references. 9/10<br /><br />16. Something Great - Written with Gary Lightbody of Snow Patrol, this sounds pretty much like you'd expect it to. Of the ballads that I don't care for too much, it's probably the best, and a good album closer. 8/10<br /><br />BONUS TRACKS<br /><br />17. Half A Heart - The typical drippy boyband ballad about a bad break-up. It's fine, and melodically I like the verses even if the lyrics are a little cheesy, but it's just not as strong as other tracks on the album. 7/10<br /><br />18. Right Now - This ballad was co-written by Ryan Tedder. This is completely personal preference, but I've just never been much of a fan of Tedder's sound (and it definitely is a &#34;sound,&#34; asmany of his tracks are so cookie-cutter that they can be picked out instantly). This isn't one of his best, and 1D can't do much with it either. 7/10<br /><br />Album Grade: 8.9/10 (B+/A-)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|And I'm required to use a certain number of words or more?  What?  I loved this book, couldn't put it down.  Is that enough words for you, Amazon??

B00340I4KG|4.0|One of my favorite movies of all time. I would go 5 stars had the medical center scene been better written. Travolta, Cage and Nivola were each very charismatic and very fit for their roles.
B00G21XNKU|1.0|I was waiting for the release so I could have my personal copy... but $21.99 for a download, for one episode (as good as it was) is not worth the price.  Really?!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Loved it!! Very moving! Lots of twists and turns!! This definitely should be a movie with the same people playing the same parts! The author is and always will be my favorite!
B008602KQI|5.0|It is such a great story and the effects are exciting!  I have watched it several times and love it each time!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Simply became addicted to this series the second I picked up the first book.  I quickly read the other two in the series and had finished all of them in less than one week...so disappointed because I could have read soooo much more.  Would highly recommend to any female reader who needs to spice things up.  This is the first &#34;romantic&#34; novel or series I have read and it was a page-turner and worth every cent!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Love that you can combine sounds AND adjust each to it's own level.<br />Sounds are very realistic and I am so enjoying this app.
B00AZ7V0W0|3.0|Packaging sucks. but at least I have the films in the highest quality possible. Wish we still had the cool box set from the dvds! but we can't have it all can we?
B00F880BWG|5.0|I absolutely love this show. Amazon is very quick to release the newest episodes in crisp, clear quality. Buffer speeds are quick and almost unnoticeable. Highly recommend this show!
B000RZIGVS|1.0|Because you only allow short period of time for viewing this entire collection, and I have discovered damaged DVD just today in season 5 of this collection; it is next to impossible to watch all of these DVD's in such short period of 34 days.....
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Love Stephen King's books.  This was not his best, but when you just finished the Dark Tower series it's hard to compare.  I've never found his books &#34;scary,&#34; but his character development is incredible.  A notch above some of his lesser known novels for sure.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|This is, without a doubt, the greatest angry birds game of all time, and I have them all. From graphics to the corilations it has to star wars. I do wish that they had the option of choosing either to be a Jedi or Sith, but other than that, AMAZING game!
B00GLX1MG6|1.0|horrible, pathetic, weak...predictable...uncomfortable...waste of time and brain cells...in my opinion<br />watch something else, The Heat, Chevy Chase, but not this

B00FAPF5U0|4.0|had friends who have played for some time but until I got this game did not realize how addictive and fun it really was. draws you in to beat the levels. not as easy as it seems. fun toplay
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|This was a very fun game. Took a few hours to complete. I will definitely be playing this a few times. I was disappointed though, that I had to spend 2.99 to get the full version. Especially when it says free!
1451695195|5.0|Amazing book superbly written. And it is proof of heaven, totally believable and real. One if the very best books
B00GH4RKYM|5.0|Our family loved it! The backstory of Krypton was very interesting to us, as was experiencing Clark's life at different seasons. It was longer than I'd thought it might be, but there was a lot of ground covered. We also caught some awesome symbolism within the movie that was particularly meaningful to us. Inspiring!
B007ZGO7EM|1.0|This is a basic calculator with big buttons  and very easy functions.<br />It's easy to pull up when working on something, very accessible.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This was a really good book but it was very sad at the end. The main character kills herself. Overall this is a great book and I recommend this book to 8 and up.
B003B02O14|5.0|I have always been a fan of Grisham. This book lived up to its expectations.<br />I recommend it without reservation if you like his style.
B000A59PMO|5.0|I just recently re watched Veronica Mars. This is a great show. Kristen Bell is such a great actress and her portrayal of Veronica is spot on. The whole cast is also wonderful and very diverse. The show is a type that has a big mystery, surrounded by small mysteries that is solved throughout the other episodes. This is a laugh out loud type of show, but there are some somber moments. Overall one of the best shows out there! Too bad there's only three seasons!
B00G70WLJA|5.0|I read the samurai comic this movie is based on.The movie is better.There is an intelligent dipiction of guilt.loyaltyand redemption.Hugh Jackman is a great actor he delivers a great performance.I am a Wolverine fan and a great Hugh Jackman fan.
B00D4K8SBQ|5.0|I took this on my vacation, and loved how easy it was to connect it! You need to enter the photo app, then plug in the connector, then import the pictures you want...and voila, all your pictures in glorious detail! Can't get over how wonderful this was. My 77 year old grandma was in complete amazement that I could take her pictures and send them off to the family within seconds of taking them! Best buy ever!!!!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love this game. For it being free it's a great game and addictive. Thought it wouldn't be good but I play it all the time.
B00BEIYN3M|3.0|The movie was funny no denying that. It could have been better without the constant foul language. Yeah I know its rated R but hearing F you over and over doesnt make a movie great, acting does. To each his own if you like it or don't like it that's your choice.
B0064W639K|5.0|Always been a batman fan and a comic book nerd but never read this one.  I truly enjoyed it and any batman fan needs to read this one of my all time favorites
0316056863|5.0|I love Tina and I loved this book. I really hope she's writing the next one because I've read this a couple of times now and just so enjoyed it. It's funny, warm and sassy as hell.
006202406X|5.0|i love this book!!!!! &#60;4 tris is dead but i don't care, this book is incredible!!! i love verónica roth!!!
B00GIXWXEO|4.0|My 10 year old son loved this movie! He saw the movie in the theaters when it first came out.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|I love real steel world robot boxing it is my favorite game in the world I love this game more than any other game in the world.
B008BM0IUG|5.0|I like Sean Carroll as a presenter of scientific ideas. He does a fine job in making analogies that capture the main ideas. And he's funny, at least to my ear. I think you could do much worse than to read this book on the Higgs.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Its nice and fast paced. Cool as temple run. I luv it!<br />It has cool missions and I like its flow
B008Y5T5ZE|4.0|The Ninth Gate starring Johnny Depp was a movie that kept you on suspense the entire time from start to finish. The twisted plots and adventures will keep you guessing.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Love it. Hate waiting but wait times are way less than most games. My biggest problem is I wish you could level up faster.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|awesome game. better than temple run in my opinion. they also update this game a lot adding more places and other cool features.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|I thought this was the last book in the series  but no, there's at least one more. This 4th book in the Game of Thrones series seemed to drag on at times. I'm hoping it just set up the action for book 5.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Adorable yet addicting! I love it so much! Good pace with the timing on the creation of supplies! Easy to earn coins to keep going!
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|This movie has its moments, but it is not as great as the first G. I. Joe movie. The flare just was not there for me.
1451666179|5.0|After being a longtime reader of the Hyperbole and a Half blog, I was very much looking forward to the release of the book. Some of the stories are familiar from the website, some of them are new, and all of them are presented fantastically.<br /><br />Whenever I crack open this book, I find myself chuckling quietly in a corner. And then having to explain myself to whoever else is in the room. And then having to forfeit my book for a good long while, so they can read the story as well. At which point I must snatch the book from their hands and beat them over the head with it, in order to get it back (a sidenote - the book is hefty enough for said beating, which is always a bonus).
B000R7HY0K|5.0|This is one those movies that will keep you interested in it one way or another, no matter what. All I can say, in my opinion, is that you will enjoy this movie and get some popcorn and soda to snack on while watching like in theaters.
1451666179|5.0|I think Allie Brosh is actually one of the best writers of this generation. She's able to pick apart her experiences in a way that makes them completely relatable. Like, childhood binging on cake? Yup. The various levels of emotion experienced with depression? Yup.<br /><br />I would buy this book for everyone.<br /><br />Also, it's like, printed super nice? All bright and crap? And the pictures are good?<br /><br />Whatever. Just buy it, loser. As if you really need me telling you.
B0017KIBAI|2.0|I loved this color of the Gamecube controller, but it did not go well with the color of my Gamecube console, which was indigo by the way, so I got rid of it.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Awesome but if you are a beginner I would say it's too hard but I think that everybody who likes call of duty would like this
B005OCFGTO|5.0|love the movies and they are all now in one set. Was shipped quickly and in excellent condition. good price and will enjoy watching them again and again!
B00EJX2YGM|5.0|If you're a Twihard then you will defenitely love this complete edition of all the Twilight Saga Movies and also all the special features ever created. I'm enamoured by this box set, it's incredible, the photo album is cute and well created. I'm glad I bought this dvd box, it is absolutely perfect for my huge love for Twilight.
0385537131|5.0|Sycamore Row is one of the best books i have ever read. It's as if your sitting in the courtroom having it unfold before your eyes. Grisham explains every detail about the case and the characters,he keeps us spellbound all through the novel.
B001TH16DI|2.0|Bad news here<br />1. These disks do not RESUME to where disk was stopped.<br />2. Searching for a chapter is not the easiest<br />3. The disks alway start by playing the entro<br />4. all the above are time consuming andfrustrating<br /><br />Even though the movie quality is good, that doesn't make for the frustration of make one keystroke mistake on the remote and having to find where you left off.
B00EVW0SA0|5.0|Sure it was predictable but it was a fun watch. Don't look too much into the storyline or try to figure out the meaning behind the movie. Just watch and enjoy the action.
B003ASLJS6|1.0|Typical self directed Clint Eastwood movie portraying himself as yet another hero. This is a joke of a remake of a great film, &#34;Shane&#34; from 1953. This Clint version implies that he nailed Sarah Wheeler (the mother). What's the matter Clint, did it seem wrong to you when directing yourself as a hero that you couldn't get the younger girl, Megan ??
B005WYFLNU|5.0|We have at least 2 other M & D Reusable Sticker Pads and our Grandchildren love them.  It is a great way to use imagination and have fun.  At times we'll play &#34;find what is WRONG with this picture&#34; putting stickers in funny and inappropriate places (eg. flower pot on top of the lamp, dog on the slide etc).  Lots of laughs and easy storage to play again and again.
B004GCPJDQ|3.0|Best rechargable I've used.  However after a couple years it looks like the charge base is going flakey.  Often does not recognize the mouse and just recently has actually started &#34;turning off&#34; (don't know how that happens).  I have 4 of these, bought at different times for different Macs and they behave differently.  Starting to look like they might not make it to the 6 year mark (which BTW is about how long it takes to recoup the cost compared to AA batteries).  Although I did not buy these to save $$ on batteries (that would be foolish), I did expect it to last long enough to be &#34;green&#34;.  If it goes bad and becomes waste itself, then the only &#34;green&#34; part is avoiding throwing alkaline batteries into the land-fill.<br /><br />So... I like it, but I'm not sure it's living up to its &#34;promise&#34;
B0027MJU00|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book for several reasons, prime among them being the plot and the awesome way in which it unfolds. I read Gillian Flynn's &#34;Gone Girl&#34; and Amazon &#34;suggested&#34; this book. I don't regret the suggestion. It was a quick read and it was a page turner for me.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This is a good game the graphics are awesome too<br />Plus it had infrared rays that let you see the animals<br />Internal organs
B002VECM6S|5.0|Fantastic story of a family helping out someone else! Something the whole family can watch. Need more stories like this in real life.
B00FAVRHBE|5.0|They nailed it.  Virtually flawless celebration of all 50 years, not just the past 8 years.  If you only know the series from 2005 on, you will have no problems following the story, but the more you know about the complete history of the series, the more you will appreciate.<br /><br />Sit down, buckle up, and pay attention.  You are in for a fantastic ride.
B00BPDR3F6|4.0|An intriguing novel.  Not action packed but it grabbed me, kept me turning pages as it drew me into Alms's life.  Interwoven with a history of early biological thinking.  I enjoyed it.
B006M9NI48|5.0|My mother recommended this book & she said it is brilliant. Believe me if my mother said this it will be true.<br />Embarking on this myself today. Jane
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I like how the book was written I like how Peeta lies to save Katness.<br />it's well written I also love the movie.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Pretty good book. Slow in certain parts. Overall worth the read. I would recommend it to other military book fans.
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|Preston and Child have provided me with many hours of enjoyment and thrills. White Fire is no exception. Bringing Corrie zswanson back into the mix after all these years was a bold move, but it opens up many more story lines. I am, as always, already excited for the next Pendergast novel!!! Well done!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|It's amazing I love this one!!!!!!! I can't wait to see the movie!!!!! I remember how excited I was for the first one. I am even more excited about this one just because I read the book. When I read the end of every chapter, it really put me up on my toes. I could literally see Katniss in the arena, going through all the problems. I can't to see the movie, and read Mocking jay
B006NXIO0Q|2.0|This movie was pretty rough. It was full of violence and action, but somehow still pretty boring. I like Zoe Saladana, but this movie is definitely not worth your time.
B00AEFXV3E|5.0|I had seen a small part of this towards the end years ago and then i ran across it the other day being aired on TCM.  I really enjoyed what I saw. Looking forward to watching the whole thing.
B0073PZIYI|1.0|Definitely don't watch it! I was excited to watch this movie after seeing the previews, but really didn't like it. It was boring and didn't make any sense in terms of timeline. Even though I was looking forward to seeing it I couldn't even finish watching it.
B000002O4X|5.0|This is a wonderful sound track.  Good to play over dinner and wine.  Good back ground music.  A nice Christmas gift.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I've always been a fan of Stephen King's books, but had only seen the movie \\"The Shining\\". When I saw that there was a sequel I broke down and finally read the book that inspired the movie which had scared the living crap out of me as a kid. Reading \\"The Shining\\" first gave me a much deeper understanding of Danny ad what was really going on. I loved \\"Doctor Sleep\\". I felt every emotion. There was just the right amount of scare without making me loose sleep (except for not being able to put the book down). I recommend t anyone who likes King's books.
B00G6RK0VU|5.0|What a joy to read this book again after so many years. It was far better then I remembered. The underlying meaning is so true.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I thought the book was wonderful. Beautifully written.  Khalid Hosseini is a master storyteller.  I couldn't put the book down and was sad when it ended.
B0076DELIG|3.0|Liked the book but it all came together too quick at the end. Good but not his best work. Hope his next case is better.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This book was excellent and I could not put it down. I was surprised by the time I got to the end the more mature topics that were covered as I was under the impression this series for teens. It's definitely a great read for all ages (teens and older).
1465414444|5.0|It was informative well written and the art very well done. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves warcraft
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|Excellent movie. I prefer this English version over the Swedish version although both are excellent. This seems to follow the story closely and Rooney Mara plays an excellent Lisbeth Salander.
0988262592|4.0|The Phoenix Project is another business novel (a popular format at the moment). The story relates to an IT department who is in serious trouble and will require a drastic change if the company wants to surprise. They gradually start adopting more devops related practices and in the end it'll save the company (sorry to give away the ending :P)<br /><br />Bill is a manager in the IT department who suddenly gets promoted to the VP because his boss and his bosses boss get fired. Not a nice position to be in. He'll need to get a grip on the IT mess that was left behind and the mess turns out to be bigger than he thought it was ever possible. He meets Erik who might become a new board member and Erik becomes his sensei and gradually explains Bill the &#34;Three Ways&#34; which gradually transforms the IT from being a cost-center to being an integrated part of the business.<br /><br />I won't give away much more of the story. I enjoyed the story. At times it was a bit predictable. It does follow the stereotypical business novel patterns where someone needs to save the business and finds a teacher who gradually helps him step by step. It does a fairly good job and introducing key concepts around the devops movement and why this is important for organizations. I'd definitively recommend reading The Phoenix Project as it is insightful. 4 stars.
B00G6ZTM3Y|4.0|This game is awesome I also have It on ps3 but it seems that either the multiplayer function doesn't work or nobody's online  or it means that multiplayer  is just local.anyways the game is awesome but I would give it a five star if u added more stuff from pc I'm not saying everything from the pc version just a couple.I also know that the p e of terraria can't support eveything
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Another great read, please keep bringing us the suspense, the fear, and the imagination of a truly gifted writer.<br />Thank you
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|A good read, enjoyed that it further developed characters from an earlier book.  Always atreat to travel through one of<br />grishams of books.
0452295548|5.0|Incredible story. Very inspiring for those affected by strokes-- 8 years later you cannot tell that she even had a stroke. Highly recommended.
B0039YZPZ4|5.0|One of my favorite movies of all time!  Incredibly engaging plot and very well cast/directed.  Looking forward to getting this movie into my families regular line-up.
B000I9VZKW|5.0|Will Smith and a great story?  Can't do better than that. One of the best action/science fiction movies ever!  Feels like you are actually living this along with all the characters.
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|one of Sparks best books, i like the idea drama among a complicated soldier life. its a must read book
B00EAIMGDW|5.0|Cool game but it stopped working with my Nexus 10 upgrade to Kitkat.  Cool mix of puzzle and hidden objects.
B00ENNA62W|5.0|I'm not at all a big fan of japanime, but akira was/is something.  I have a copy on VHS and have just placed an order for a DVD/BR combo version of the \\"25th Anniversary\\" edition.  Nuff said.  Still hate most japanime, but am looking forward to a modern copy of this one that I can play pretty well anywhere/everywhere as I see fit.<br /><br />As to the content of this \\"film\\" well, I gave it 5 stars as most films go, it's no classic symphony piece but I guess it's as close as \\"films\\"(yes this is not a \\"film\\"), but this is close I guess as I'll ever see.  (I'm also not at all a fan of any animated feature nor of comic books in general, so the 5 star rating says something about this particular piece.)
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|Bryson is one of my favorite non-fiction writers and he knocks it out of the park with this story of 1927.  My wife always knows when I am reading a Bryson book because i read so many passages out loud. Bryson invariably finds facinating details that makes you marvel. The man can stone-cold write but his reporting gets overlooked. This is one of his best and he's had some great ones.
B0025VLELQ|5.0|Fantastic film. I still remember watching this on vhs when i was little. to finally have it on blu-ray is fantastic..
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Have been a fan of PATRICIA CORNWELL from the start.  Can't wait til I get my hands on her next book
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I really love the game, but one should not have to pay five coins to play an area already unlocked. And there are almost no chances to win the coins. Fix those things and it would and it would be an off the chart score!<br />Yes, I realize it is a free game...I would pay for it if the above were rectified.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|A very good book.  I didn't know what the book was about and was very surprised by the story. It was a page turner.
B001BWDG0W|5.0|If you loved the movie you will love the music, when you hear. It you will remember the movie, recommend 100%
B00BM1AJIO|5.0|love it its the best I played in a long time. graphics good keeps you guessing. like games like this its fun.
B008AVYOBC|5.0|Wow, this is a must if you always liked Bananarama, is also a must for your 80's collection. I recommend it 100%
B00FHATBGW|5.0|An exceptional game. Very challenging but not too hard that you would give up. Graphics are fabulous and the story is great. Well worth the price.
B0034DBRFC|5.0|You must have this one if you are a fan of Belinda, it comes a cd and a DVD as shown and the DVD is the live concert Goodheavens, which I must say it is spectacular and the sound is perfect, I recommend 100%
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|I love this game. Lots of different places to see but there is a map to help show you where each place is. Hint button helps but most of the time you can figure it out yourself. No hidden objects which is fine but I also like those games too. Fire Maple has made some awesome games and this is one of them. You need to get this one.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|Thank you to the Hendrix family! This is the best material yet released by them. This cd sizzles. Jimi's playing is astounding. I love this one. An amazing testament to a touchstone musician.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is amazing. It doesn't have caves or iron doors or redstone yet but it constantly gets new updates. If you don't have it you should get it.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love playing this game. Thanks so much! I hope you have more free apps like this. Austin I think you!
B00E9PMMX0|4.0|Awesome, awesome movies. FYI, black cover with Darth Vader has the CGI enhancements/additions. I was a bit disappointed as I wanted the original version but it is what it is. If you want the original, DO NOT order the black with Darth and a light saber on the cover. I suggest contacting the seller prior to purchasing.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Great game.  A lot you can do without having to buy anything, though sometimes you have to have a little patience.  A lot less waiting in this game compared to most, however.  definitely worth checking out!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|First I would recommend this book to anyone who read The Shining....only they will truly appreciate it. I gave it 5 stars because it definitely deserves 5 stars. The only thing I would change is the fact that Wendy died before Dan's sobriety. It would have been comforting to me (maybe no one else) to see a mother/son storyline. I read The Shining when it was first published, I was 16 and working for McDonald's. It got me through that rough time. This book is an awesome treat for us and a great work of art for Mr. King
B00G9U7R2O|5.0|Great movie, if you loved Monsters Inc. then you have to watch MU, it explains many things from MI and more!
0486268659|5.0|I love to read this every Christmas to help me remember what Christmas is all about.
B00FWLDHSY|4.0|Good action movie, the sci-fi is a little weak but then again I am a huge nerd so.....<br /><br />Not 100% sure Charlie Hunnam was the best choice for this role, he was probably choosen because of his SoA popularity.  Still, it is a good plot and if you like giant robots fighting giant aliens then this is your movie!
B009VI6682|4.0|We will own Smurfs 2, if only to appease our nine-year old daughter who is obsessed with these little blue people (just as I was at her age, which gives it a nostalgic edge for me).  Saw it at the theater with absolutely zero expectations other than for an expensive nap...and then, much to my horror, I laughed out loud...and then I did it a few more times.  My daughter was also thoroughly enjoying it, and there is no better sound better than your own child's laughter.  I will readily admit to being a big fan of what are generally considered to be kids' movies (Disney, Despicable Me, Shrek, etc.).  While this one is not necessarily at the top of that genre, keeping me from giving it the last star, it was enjoyable for what it is intended to be -- i.e., good, clean, family entertainment.  If you go into it expecting that, you will not be disappointed.
B006YTTVHO|1.0|I thought that this book would help me be more sociable and help me keep a conversation. The tops in there were ones that I already knew so it wasn't as much help as I wanted it to be.
B007FXLZ9K|5.0|This movie is just stunning...and the actors in this....AMAZING!! I think between Carrie Mulligan, Micheal Fassbender, and Nicole Beharie...there was a no brainer on how good this movie was going to be.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I Am so glad this app is up and running on my kindle fire. This game is so fun and addictive. Love it!
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|If you're one to want to see all the extended versions of the film (I'm one myself), then rent this from a Netflix DVD subscription, and wait for the typical multi disc version due out just around the corner.  Did the last movie trilogy not teach anyone this?<br /><br />I'll be buying the extended version when it comes out because I'm silly that way, but you don't have to.  But if you just want to watch this great film adaptation from one of the best fantasy stories ever written, and not worry about a gazillion hours of production video, then buy this DVD.<br /><br />When it gets to your home, pop it in the player, get some popcorn going, and sit down and enjoy.  Simple, cheap, and great entertainment.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Good hand/eye coordination. Fun for all ages to play. I would recommend this game for any one to pass the time away.
B0043GN6XK|5.0|The more I listen to it, the more I love it.  It really showcases Vivaldi's mastery of infusing emotion into music.
B008BDZOZY|5.0|A brilliant album by two talented musical artists.  St. Vincent is a new discovery for me, but I have known and enjoyed David Byrne's music for many years.  The arrangements on  this album are great!
B00B7Y0206|1.0|It never installed despite calling for tech support. Now I can't even watch or listen to videos or CDs that I once had access to
B00BAXFECK|5.0|The Goldfinch has the scope of a Dickensian novel and the dynamics of a Harry Potter tale. Tartt's language is muscular and poetic at the same time. Her characters are all vulnerable and revealed as subject to humanity's weaknesses and power.  It has that quality that all good art has of feeling as if it as always existed, we just needed to find it and revel in it's familiarity. The power of art exists in the small painting of a captive goldfinch that has impact on every life it touches. We are swept from one intriguing location to another like migrating birds landing in strange places. When I felt Tartt begin to apply the brakes to the inexorable forward movement, my sense of loss began because I knew the story had to end.
B000FCKL6G|4.0|Great history of the turn around of IBM and the transformation of it's business model. Really interesting to look at the strategy that was applied in not breaking the company up but leveraging off it's strengths and re-aligning the organization. The EBO was an excellent strategy of innovation to focus on the products and services (like IBM Global Services) that moved the company to a technology, software and services company and turned around the revenue and profit streams to move the company from the brink of bankruptcy to again e a formable giant of the tech industry.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game! Wish it didn't take so long to get more lives though. This is the best candy game I have found anywhere.
B00EL6AAEU|5.0|This is a must see movie! The movie takes you back  to the 70/80s and shows how the orcas were captured. It is a well documented movie in which it will make you understand why orcas do not belong in captivity. It was hearbreaking how these beautiful mammals were treated at a young age. It is a heartbreaking movie as well as educational for everyone to understand.
B00GH4R95C|3.0|Just saw man of steel and have to say I am sad that the people in charge of sups are bending to the winds in the name of keeping up to date and edgy. It is sad that DC took superman away from america to be more politically correct. Most of all it is sad that the current keepers of this bit of modern day mythology are messing it up so regularly. :(<br /><br />Superman Batman and Wonder Woman....the three big guns. DC has successfully sunk sups and bats...I just wish they could keep their heads afloat with WW, but i don't have much hope.<br /><br />Once again this could have been knocked out of the park...but there was too much effort to hug trees, make lois a more independent woman without jimmy and most of all push the edgy envelope with a kill in the superman collum. Stop preaching BS and run the characters in the spirit they were made .... that is what made them famous and loved.<br /><br />So unless they are trying to spin an injustice earth I just don't see this version of superman flying too high....sad
B008ALA6DW|5.0|Perfect. Wouldn't buy any other product unless its specifically from Apple themselves, so this was a great price for me.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Fast, easy set up, on mobile or laptop tis so so easy to use, open a movie file on your laptop in chrome browser and stream that too....I'm getting another one.
B005EHILV4|4.0|The products meet my expectations. Windows automatically recognizes the device and install driver.<br />Excellent for home recordings.<br />It's very simple to use, no requires external power supply when using plugged to an USB port.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|What more can I say that hasn't already been said about this amazing game? This is a great strategy game that has great replay value and should belong in everyone's game collection. If we could only keep one of our games this would be the one.<br /><br />We also own the Traders and Barbarian expansion which allows for a 2-player game. While not as fun as with 3 or 4 players it still allows us to play with just the two of us.<br /><br />We always have a great time playing this game. Each game is unique and who you play it with and the strategy you use will always keep things interesting.
B000LTAY1U|4.0|I chose a 4 star rating for one and one reason only: The arm band has begun to degrade a bit. Threads are wearing loose in the band, and I am roughly 2 weeks into wearing it.<br /><br />Here's as descriptive as I care to get about the product. It's a watch that looks expensive, but isn't, keeps time well, isn't too loud (if you do work that requires a lot of focus, or shoot a lot, you're going to want the least amount of background noise to have to block out) and doesn't weigh too much. When you do a lot of physical work, you're going to feel resistance from the automatic arm rolling around in there, just a heads up. It's noticeable but just so.<br /><br />This is the first watch I have ever chosen to wear, some people were asking me silly things about the color and if it was military issue etc, because it's olive or olive drab. As far as I know the US military has no issued watch. If it has one, this is not in. Do not buy it for that reason, that would be extremely foolish. Most anyone who saw you claiming that you had a military issue watch while you were wearing this, assuming they had ever held a single firearm or served, would dismiss you as a &#34;mall ninja.&#34;<br /><br />Doesn't seem to mind the bleach from work, I don't advise exposing the band to it, regardless of that observation.<br /><br />If you're looking for quality reviews that aren't someone raging out or professing their love for what they ordered, keep an eye out for my name.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|One of the best albums I have in my collection. Rodriguez has written great songs. And the sound is classic.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love playing this game it's addicting hours on end of fast paced fun.<br /> I highly recommend this game for hours and hours of fun for all ages to enjoy.
B003PJ6UHA|4.0|A thoroughly enjoyable romp through consciousness.  Each  chapter escorts the reader down the aisle of what seems real and what is real.  Leave your preconceptions at the door, you are on the good ship  consciousness and we're not stopping, ever.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|It's very fun and addictive like everyone's been saying but in order to get upgrades and such you need tokens and you have to buy tokens...
B00BP4W3WI|5.0|Timeless, enjoyable family movie.  Some movies lose their appeal over time, and I was not sure if this one would bore my 10 year old, given all the special effects advancements to which he is accustomed.  He was captivated the entire time, and I enjoyed seeing it again after 30 years.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I LOVE THIS I USE IT TOO CHEAT IN SCHOOL I HIDE IT IN MY DESK AND USE IT BTW I'M 14 &amp; IM IN 6thf
B00CHVIPP2|5.0|I am IN LOVE with this movie!!! Our daughter loves watching it and always says &#34;Dun-dun-DUUUNNNN!!!!&#34; :) Made me very happy.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|True story that is well written by a very mature and surprisingly well-adjusted young lady. I would highly recommend it.
B00EEDNA4M|5.0|UPDATE: here is Vince Gilligan explaining the product personally on Facebook! Enjoy:<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />I enjoy collecting these kind of special collections for tv shows and movies i love.. and BB is one of the BEST series to EVER be on TV!<br /><br />this collection is awesome!... the barrel is solid... when you open up the top you see MONEY... which is also the Los Pollos Hermanos apron (which i will never unpack)... the BB coin is cool... the discs and cases are excellent with great graphics and a solid feel... all seasons are separated into separate containers... even the package it comes in is cool... plastic, easy to open, sealed with 'rubber' glue that is easy to remove entirely...<br /><br />one of the BEST collectibles i have in my collection!<br /><br />PS - since i live in Las Vegas i get things a day early (stuff ships on the weekend to make sure it gets to recipients before Tuesday, and i get things the next day!)... i also have Amazon PRIME... so free shipping as well! :)<br /><br />UPDATE: i am just now getting into the discs themselves... the disc holders are very cool... they are very solid and thick plastic (almost glass like)... and the two halves of each holder are held together by three strong magnetic seals! :)<br /><br />UPDATE: each of the six season cases can be removed from the barrel and stacked on top of each other... by aligning the three magnets in each, they 'lock' into a perfect stack of all six seasons! ... which takes up less space on the shelf than their jacketed counterpart... although i believe keeping them in the barrel is the way to go!<br /><br />here are some images of the product i took, including one showing how the six disc cases stack...<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />[...]<br />[...]<br />[...]<br />[...]<br />[...]<br />[...]<br /><br />UPDATE: when you pull off the top of the barrel to reveal where the apron/money and coin are stored... turn it over and look under it... there you will find yet another disc... this one has GPS coordinates on it, and contains a 2 hour special on the making of Breaking Bad!<br /><br />Also, the 16-page booklet can be found inside the barrel cover that swings open... it has the words 'Break Bad - The Complete Series' written on it(white letters on a green pattern background)... this can be pulled out and is the 16-page booklet!
B001NLKT60|5.0|I have read all three of this series and wish there would be more. Very intricate plots. I think all ages of adults would enjoy these.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Sycamore Row<br /><br />This is one of John Grisham's best book. Very compelling and intriguing .<br />I was not able to put the book down
B0036S4B6M|5.0|An awesome book.  Everyone should read it.  How in modern times can we have a correctional system that is so dysfunctional and archaic as the system/s described in this book?  It is shameful.  It's no wonder that so many ex-prisoners come out of jail or prison non-rehabilitated.  I strongly recommend  that this book be required reading in every high school and college.
0609610570|5.0|Re-enforced what I knew but made me question why I didn't do these things to successfully complete projects.  Must reading for anyone who works on projects and business plans.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Good game to pass the time. It can be hard to pass some levels. At work every one has to check in in the morning g to see bow far they got the day before
B00FB029IU|4.0|The latest in &#34;new Dylan&#34; wunderkinds is 19 year old Jake Bugg, a Brit who sounds like he popped out of the Greenwich Village clubs with his enigma fully intact and a sophomore album called &#34;Shangri La.&#34; And yes, that's a compliment. He's plugged in and has Rick Rubin on his team to peel back any unnecessary varnish that might have gotten stuck to the kid had anyone tried to polish him up. He's such a young gun that his voice even sounds like it has acne. That nasal bleat on &#34;There's a Beast and We All Feed It&#34; could only come from someone too young to realize that he hasn't conquered the world just yet, but old enough to think that it should be listening to his every pronouncement.<br /><br />Jake Bugg can run the gamut from that hard chugging opener to the more introspective &#34;Me and You.&#34;<br /><br />&#34;All these people want us to fail<br />But I won't let that happen now.&#34;<br /><br />He sings this line like he's a knight coming to a rescue. The kid excels in earnestness. The closest I can recall another album that believed in itself so definitively was Ryan Adams when he released &#34;Gold,&#34; and I like &#34;Shangri La&#34; so much more than that album. His age is not a hindrance as he tackles some adult themes on &#34;Storm Passes Away,&#34; along with a decent pedal steel, or the street denizens of &#34;Messed Up Kids.&#34;<br /><br />There is a lot of raw talent on &#34;Shangri La,&#34; and it's good to hear a young talent that isn't spun off the hot-making machinery of some TV Talent contest. You may have to get past the nasal twang in the young man's voice (which is why he wouldn't have lasted an audition for the likes of &#34;American Idol&#34;), but give yourself an opportunity and you'll hear what sounds to me like a first class singer-songwriter on the way up. Jake Bugg is the real deal.
1250012570|5.0|I just finished this book and I'm not okay. I don't know how the author did it, but she made me feel like I was 16 and felt like that again. And i graduated high school in 1984, so it's been a long time. Rainbow Rowell creates such deep, complex, so very real characters with such simple, clean prose. Every character is so fully realized and the love and the pain. The build of the relationship was just perfect. You feel yourself falling in love and discovering the characters at the same pace they do. I loved the alternating POVs. I loved the ending.<br /><br />I truly didn't want this book to end. Best book I have read in a long time.
B000F7OPCC|5.0|What not to love, one of the best of all time, no CGI, no foul language, no smutty sex scenes. Great acting, action and story.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|Works well as a portable white noise machine for travel. I can leave the app running all night with my Kindle plugged in. My kids like the sound options.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Second book of the series about Katniss Everdeen.  Great read.  Interesting storyline.  Waiting now for the movie..  Some violence described . So be prepared.
B00004XQ83|5.0|It arrived on time, in excellent condition.  Love it and listen to it a lot!  I would recommend it to a friend!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I love it! In the first few minutes, I'm already hunting, and enjoying the scenery, great graphics, and the thrill of the hunt. Amazing game, and I recommend it to anyone who loves hunting.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love it I love it I love it love it.  it rocks and is so fun and challenging its just plain fun
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|As always, I was totally immersed in the storyline. Grisham always delivers! The characters are real and believable! The topic, an ever-present one even in this day and age!
B004M5AOGY|5.0|Gifts come in all kinds of forms, powers and packages, it is how we use them that determines who we are.
B000SEGQNS|3.0|Despite all 5 rating stars, I believe the book was not that great. The information on the book was too general and common. I have read much better books in web and UX. But overall it's a good book for beginners. Didn't worth the price though!
B00EMJBVAI|5.0|This movie had my attention every minute, hope there is a sequel.  Mother nature does indeed rule and we at her mercy.
B007PVHMCG|2.0|Pay attention, this is a lego MICRO set. It is comprised of two teeny tiny bags of micro legos. I decided that these were to small to give to my seven year old. I would say this is meant for an older child, or an adult collector. Honestly, underwhelming amount of legos for the $48.00 price tag. I get that it's 'minecraft', but for my money - not worth the price. I sent it back.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This game is lots of fun and love all the levels! I enjoyed this game on Facebook so was very happy when it became available for the Kindle Fire.
B00DVKOYBM|5.0|Well worth getting. Tried a few different pool games in the past but this is the best by far.easy to pick up how to play.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Awesome read. Book goes by extremely fast ans is very gripping. Love the change up at the end, can't wait for the movie.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I loved that the story continued characters from before. I couldn't wait to find out the connections between the main characters.
B000FA675C|4.0|Since I got this book I really enjoyed the time I spent reading it! I look forward to reading the other books by Dan Brown
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I love this version of castleville much better than Facebook's original version, I enjoy that you are not relying on others to complete tasks and quests.  I think that the crowns should be more affordable. But love the game play for sure. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys zynga games!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This is a cool game and I play it a lot without getting bored. The armour cost more than it should. I would recommend it to anyone.
B002MG2ATY|5.0|It explored every aspect of the consirpacy and was very convincing.  There was a human element to it, also -- when someone is so consumed with proving a point, it can definitely upset the balance of one's personal life.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|System is too locked down.  Cannot stream your own content -- ONLY stuff purchased in the Play store.  Extremely disappointed in this device.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|My 12 year old daughter loves the music in this dvd.  She is very excited for the sequel to come out in 2015.  She loves the main star of the movie as well.
B008JFUS5A|5.0|I have read both The Hunger Games (and own the movie) and Catching Fire.  The Catching Fire movie was VERY well done. The new cast members: Finnick, Mags, Plutarch, and Joanna were PERFECTLY cast and written. Katniss' look on her face during the elevator scene was PRICELESS! I laughed so hard. Everyone played their parts so well. I really felt myself getting all pumped up about the uprising. My 14yo and I had a long talk on the way home about the price of freedom and the sacrifices that were made by some of the characters.<br /><br />Biggest surprises: Effie Trinket getting me all choked up...more than once!<br /><br />Biggest letdown: It went too fast! Two hours wasn't long enough!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Game so far is a lot of fun! Keeps me busy when I'm bored and have nothing to do! Once you at you will be playing all day.
B00DV3A84G|5.0|Absolutely love this album. Its spectacular from start to finish. Beautiful vocals, very well written, masterfully produced, and great sound quality. I personally think this band sounds like a perfect mixture of Mumford & Sons, Vampire Weekend, and One Republic. So, if you enjoy any of these three bands you should definitely check out Bastille.
B005LN5UOC|3.0|The Gioteck EX03 Bluetooth Headset for PS3 is a good headset. I like that you can get a full charge within about two hours and then get hours of playtime with them.<br /><br />The fit is perfect and comfortable enough so that you can wear them for a longer amount of time. The sound is just okay but the savings make up for this flaw. The other issue that I have is that you have to use the included cord to charge with and you can't use the PS3 controller charger and this is a headache because we have tons of cords that we already have to keep up with and if this headset is designed specifically for the PS3 then it would be nice to make the chargers interchangeable.<br /><br />I like this headset and with a few added adjustments this can be a great headset.
B0048KXRR6|5.0|Emma Thompson hits a home run in this movie.  This movie just makes you smile and feel good.  It is a children s movie but it is also extremely enjoyable for adults.
1423136802|4.0|I purchased these books for my daughter as they were first released. Now I’m purchasing the gift set as Christmas Presents. They are great easy to read books and older readers, such as myself down to teen readers will get caught up in the legends and Greek Mythology as they follow this modern day hero and demigod around as he and his friends fulfill their quest, save Olympus and all mankind from destruction by the Titans.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|The book was compelling and difficult to put down. I learned a great deal about the Pacific Crest Trail, a trail I wanted to hike in my youth but didn't.
B00B0LPWU6|2.0|He is a terrific actor and did a great job but it was depressing and sad; not what I had expected.
B00G6YH6G0|5.0|Fantastic story telling. I really admire the way she uses the language to describe the setting, the mood, the characters and the plot. It is a great read for accomplished writers and newcomers alike. Deserves the Booker prize by all measures.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I was very excited to finish the trilogy.  I was thrown off by the way the author decided to write both perspectives.  It felt almost as though it was just one person.  I had to look back to remind myself who was speaking.  Both Tris and Tobias' voices sounded very similar.  I was also very unsatisfied with the ending.  I wasn't even sure the decision the author made for specific characters were final until the epilogue.  All in all, it just felt rushed.  I loved the series, but this was not my favorite in it.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|The Google Chromecast is certainly an interesting device. It seems like Google TV in a smaller form factor. Installation is super easy, I plugged it in to an HDMI slot (AND A USB SLOT, it needs both), and it was able to find my wireless network pretty quickly. I used my phone (Verizon Droid DNA) to complete the setup process, though as I understand it you can use a laptop or tablet to complete it as well, you just need the Chromecast app.<br /><br />Now as for what the product is supposed to do... it works great. Unfortunately there's just not much it CAN stream right now. YouTube, Netflix, Hulu, Google services, and recently HBO Go have native streaming support. That's not to say you can't stream other things, they just need to be passed through to a desktop (or laptop) Chrome browser, but this last solution is spotty to say the least.<br /><br />The official apps with streaming support work wonderfully. At a recent party we had we just let people connect to our WiFi as guests and they were able to play YouTube videos and music directly from their phones, it was really cool and easy to use. Netflix streams in HD without a problem, and being able to control everything from your phone makes things convenient. My wife and I love it so much we ended up picking up two, one for downstairs and one for our bedroom.<br /><br />I would love to recommend this product to everyone, but at this point if you already have a device that does your streaming, the Chromecast isn't going to replace it. Once more apps come available, it will become a no-brainer, but for now you won't necessarily be missing anything if you wait a month or so. Google is hosting a developer conference for the Chromecast on December 7th 2013, so do some research early next year to see what's going to be available.
B00FAX6XQC|3.0|I would enjoy it a lot more if it didn't just end!!  It's not a great purchase if I keep having to buy more modes and models.
B005ZB91KY|3.0|Somewhat slow moving introduction to the first Avenger. After watching the origin stories of other avengers this one was much less interesting.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Been using this now for a month. I like it and I was able to find some tricks by googling so I can watch Prime.  I guess you need to ask yourself why you want this.  I'm already starting not to use it that much... Do you own a lot of apple stuff? Than don't get this. Are you buying a new gaming console? Like Xbox 1, you probably don't need this then. This is great if all you want is to cast youtube or Netflix. Its early in the game and more apps are needed to really see the potential.
B00GO95BUU|5.0|Aaaaaaaamazing! Loved every moment of this episode! This was very well written and excited to see what will come next!
B00ECU2RGY|3.0|Ok but I really don't lie Tom Cruise.  The speecial effects are great.  The plot is different and a different twist but Cruise is Cruise.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This was one of my favorite games on Facebook and I was so excited to see it on the kindle
B004ZNB12O|5.0|My Son turned 40 and Pink Floyd has always been Our choice of Music, When I gave Him this CD His entire Face completely changed, The BEST CD of Pink Floyd EVER !!!!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Best alarm app ever. I would like to hear more options for sounds, though. Other than that I think it's one of the best apps I have.
B000WC3AJE|5.0|This is great because it does have all three volumes together in Blu-ray.  The third volume has very interesting commentary from Lena Horne, Cyd Charisse and Gene Kelly.  Any film buff who loves the output of the &#34;Freed Unit&#34; should welcome this!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I used to play the Facebook game but grew tired of it.  So far this version on the kindle is more interesting plus I can take it with me.  I hope they make more games like it.
B005AVIZ6U|5.0|Another fabulous read.  Love the characters and rich attention to Jack and his world.<br />Keep writing Lee, you are a master!
B001BANK32|5.0|I really love this book, I consider it one of King's best books.  It has a creepy hotel and the characters are great.  This is one you want to keep the lights on for when you read it.  Stephen King wrote a sequel nand it's not bad.  It is not a rehash of The Shining, but let's you into Danny Torrence's live many years later, but I digress.  The Shining is great because of all the characters the Overlook Hotel and it's hauning past is the star of the book. it seems to feed off weakness, dependance and it takes advantage of the familes isolation to get what it wants.  A really great horror read.  Well done Mr. King.
B0038LB4TE|5.0|Another fabulous read.  Love the richness of characters and detail.  Great plot and surrounding story.  Keeping writing Lee can't wait for more!
B009HUB40Y|2.0|Too much back and forth to play the next level. Actually not sure what level I'm on. May remove but it's ok for a quick time waster.
B00D23GXB2|4.0|In the book &#34;Revenge of the Orgasm (The Lust Series)&#34;, author and poet G.P.A redefines erotica literature and brings on a sensuous and voluptuous tone. Beyond just a sexual stimulant; the artistry, great story-telling and beautiful process of indulgence in physical lust was masterminded. I went searching in the thesaurus for synonyms of words that tend to describe such an exquisite art form, “erotica”. To my surprise I found words that were derogatory and concerned with vulgar nature. Revenge of the Orgasm (The Lust Series) is quite the opposite of the descriptions I found. In fact, it is deliciously naughty, not lewd.
B005STGJPI|5.0|If your a Foo Fighters fan this is for you, if your not, this will make you a fan. Wonderful alum all around.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I love this game loved on facebook and now on the kindle I play it all day and enjoy the graphics the only downside is you have to buy crowns to get the dragons
B00CWY76CC|5.0|love it. absolutely keeps the mind and body young.  not for people unwilling to use their mind. need more rooms though.
B007PT1PEY|5.0|I picked this up to visit classics I had missed. What a treat! The underlying humour & story about the friendship between Holmes & Watson was engaging. Thoroughly enjoyed this collection.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This game starts slow, but once you move up in the ranks and start joining factions in wars it gets to be fun and challenging!
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|I love this game it's really a fun game I enjoy it a lot  and also I enjoy all the the different levels and cars
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book!!! So well written and much more detailed then the .movie! It's just AMAZING! Read it before movie
B0058UXHHK|4.0|GOOD read, held my interest through the whole book.  I didn't want to put it down. Will read more of her books.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a good game, overall. The gameplay is simple. You get tasks that you can earn coins and gems from, but they only give you 24 hours to complete them. That's really the only thing that bugs me about this game. Sometimes the graphics go bad and it does this weird pixelated thing and slows dwn everything. Anyways. Once again, a very good game that I would recommend.
B00FN3HRG4|5.0|I don't understand why people keep comparing the Streisand of today with the the Streisand of the 1960&#34;s-yes her voice has changed to some degree, but In many ways she is a much better singer today. BACK TO BROOKLYN is a masterwork of a brilliant actress and a brilliant vocalist merging as one. Not since Judy Garland has a singer been able to communicate with an audience so completely . We should all count our blessings that we still have Barbra putting herself out there.
B00CEZJT2E|4.0|nice power bank , but  the only dis advantage is you have to unplug the cable to start charging.<br />keep up the good work
B00DHHWY9I|3.0|I really wanted to like this movie, but it falls flat in most respects.  The costumes are great.  DiCaprio is pretty good, but Toby McGuire, about ten years too old, is miscast and doesn't read well enough for the voice-over.  The photography, direction and script are mediocre.
0525478817|5.0|awesome book loved it, read it more then 5 times already and it dose have a slightly sad ending but still awesome :)
B00G32QIEG|1.0|Jeff and Kevin no doubt regrets this film.  This movie was absolutely terrible.  It was completely boring and predictable the whole time.
B00GO95TAC|5.0|The Day of the Doctor was a fantastic episode.  It was filled with Classic Who references to make long time fans happy and plenty of Tennant and Smith for newer Who fans to enjoy.  It as a very well done episode that also lays the groundwork for some exciting new possibilities for the show.  I'm not going to get into any specifics about the plot in the event someone reading this hasn't seen it yet.  Overall it was a fantastic anniversary episode.<br /><br />A note on pricing: I odered the Doctor Who: The 50th Anniversary Collection [HD] TV Pass on Friday 11/22 and have received all of the content that was already available at that time that wasn't free for $2.84 each. And I've received each subsequent purchase in the collection, including The Day of the Doctor, for $2.84.  It would have been nice if Amazon could have done a better job letting people know ahead of time the post-airing price for The Day of the Doctor would jump to $7.99 but I don't know how such pricing and price changes actually work.
B00CNQ7HAU|2.0|An engrossing story, guaranteed to hold your interest, yet full of holes and implausible as can be. As usual for Grisham, it is written at about a 14 year-olds level, as though the masses could not understand anything written at a higher level. Like eating a Big Mac, so enjoyable, yet nothing but a steaming mass of stool the next day.
B00AZMFJYA|4.0|The second Star Trek Opus staring Chris Pine serves to expand on James Tiberius Kirk’s rep as a rule breaking cowboy who makes it up as he goes along and his alter ego Spock a logical by-the-book straight arrow. The recycled character Khan bares no resemblance to the Wrath of Khan villain though it broadens the field for the player of Sherlock Homes. The final scenes somehow seem truncated as if the producers decided they’d run out of time and leave the viewer wandering, “just how did we get here?” I don’t like the new Warp take-off streamers. Otherwise the movie blows up real good.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|game is challenging but lots of fun.  makes you really think.  almost like a puzzle.  really enjoy it.  try it,  you'll like it!
B00FXEL00W|4.0|This is the story of two young women who fall in love in a big city with many watchful eyes. I enjoyed the chemistry between Payton and Kendall in the beginning of the story when they were both very much platonically involved as best friends. The romantic relationship was also very enjoyable I just wish that it would have been more of a fluid transition.<br /><br />This may be considered as a spoiler so read on at your discretion.<br /><br />Payton's feelings for Kendall come hard and fast. It seemed strange to me that Payton, being friends with Kendall for so long, would only find out after she came out to Kendall, how deep her feelings for her were. Later in the novel when Kendall reveals her owned reciprocating feelings to Payton it has the same startled, almost choppy, pace. Though it did seem this way, the idea of them as romantic partners and lovers was incredibly real and felt natural. The friendship is believable as well as likable. You may find yourself rooting for Payton to end up with a different girl but you'll just have to read and decide for yourself.
B002SSUQFG|4.0|Works and looks great!  The band is very comfortable and seemingly durable. I get compliments on it all the time
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is the best game incthe world it compacts all kind of games in one I love it and so do my kids
B00B7FOQCK|2.0|This product got good reviews and I thought it would be perfect to connect a third external drive to my retina MacBook Pro. Unfortunately, the drives never stay mounted and I kept having to eject and re-plug them in. Finally I just gave up. I'm sure this unit is just underpowered for what I am trying to do but in any event it doesn't work adequately for plugging in additional USB drives.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|addicting. they added a lot of new features. be sure to turn off in app purchases or else you'll spend a ton of money!
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|All of my friends recommend it and I thought why not so I got it and it was fun at first but it got too hard after a while
B00F031XPS|4.0|Documentary? There was a documentary? I went straight to the special features to see the Miami Pop Festival show, the New York Pop Festival, bootlegged as &#34;Rescued From Randall's Island&#34; and footage from Jimi's &#34;Isle of Ferhman&#34; synched to the tunes. I have to give credit where it is due: these shows are good, or even great, and it's nice to see them compiled like this instead of pieced out a show at a time.
B003NWS5AO|1.0|Never liked much of Led Zeppelin's music but love Robert Plant and Alison Krauss.<br />Compared to this even LZ sounds good to me.<br />It's just too slow, like Perry Como.<br />Good indicator is that you can buy a used cd for $2.15<br />Listen before you buy.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It's hard to imagine such a world as it is in this book. It gives a sort of eerie feeling, but you can't stop reading. Can't wait to read the next two.
B00EI4V3X2|4.0|I am coming from a few years of using a pair of PX5s.  They were programmable from a Windows PC and had some decent sound settings to isolate footsteps, etc.  These only have very basic settings, so if you are a serious gamer who wants to isolate sounds, like footsteps, look elsewhere.<br /><br />These are decent headphones, but they only have four basic sound settings, normal, treble, bass, and treble & bass.  There is also a four stop limiter button to cut out sounds that are too loud from damaging your eardrums.<br /><br />The chat is bluetooth, but PS4 doesn't support it as of yet.  So, the PX4's use a cable to connect to the controller for chat until bluetooth is enabled.<br /><br />Be sure to change the PS4 device output settings on the controller to only chat, not all, because &#34;all audio&#34; switches off the optical out.  You can control the volume and sound (chat or all) sent to the controller by pressing the PS button on the controller and selecting devices.  The volume change happening in a PS4 menu is a pain.  So, I have mine set to max, and adjust the main sound down.  The PX4's do use a overall volume logic with the limiter button so that top end volume is cut back if things get too loud.<br /><br />When bluetooth is enabled on the PS4, you should be able to use the mute, and volume control buttons.  Oh, why buttons for chat volume?  Was a dial that much more expensive to include? (there is a dial for the main volume, but not for the chat volume)<br /><br />I had some cutting out of power on the transmitter, not sure what was happening there.  I thought it may have been problems between the USB 3.0 outlet and what appears to be a USB 2.0 plug from the transmitter.  I plugged the transmitter into a PC USB outlet that is always on, and that problem seems to have gone away.  (Or, it could have been I wasn't using the headphones and it shut off.  I noticed the transmitter turns on when I turn on the headset and turns off when I turn off the headset.)<br /><br />Sound quality:  Decent enough. I didn't notice any transmission interference like I did with the PX5s.<br />Build: Cheaper than the PX5s, the cup of which eventually broke and survived by using plastic ties to engineer a fix.  No customizable sound settings, i.e., no darth vader or chipmunk voices....<br /><br />The internal battery is a plus. I used rechargeables with my PX5's, and changing out batteries and recharging was getting old.  The drawback will be the battery life and having to replace it with something proprietary from TB.<br /><br />Cons: chat cable is a temporary measure until Bluetooth is enabled, but expect Sony to fix the Bluetooth in the near future once other bugs are fixed.  No verbal menu cues , &#34;Powering Off&#34;, &#34;Bluetooth Powering On&#34;, etc.  You only get a series of beeps only R2D2 would understand....I'll figure it out.<br /><br />I suppose the PX4 will compete with the Sony PS headsets, and they are similarly priced (more expensive though).  I don't have a pair of the Sonys so, I can't do a comparison.  They do sound decent.<br /><br />Bottom line:  They are a good but cheap version of a high end headset.  They also work with the PS4 (although currently you have to use the chat cable until the PS4's bluetooth is enabled for chat).

B00B5HQLMI|4.0|it was pretty good, I need to watch it again, I may have missed a bit here and there. Good first look worth watching again I think.

B00DQQSD2W|1.0|Let me start by saying this is a very detailed and comprehensive book. I really like it and for the reading experience i would give 5 stars. Im rating &#34;the enhanced version&#34; and im going one star because i cant enjoy any of tne enhanced content because my android device cant play any of it. Its in a format only apple or newer kindle will play. Not even my PC can play any of it. Im really disappointed in amazon for getting in bed so snuggly with apple that the hork over so many consumers like this. Thanks for nothing Amazon.

B006XF5BTG|5.0|The no nonsense one stop shop to a brand new body. Mike dispels the myths and puts all that you need to know in one place. Finally a program that doesn't require 4 hours a day to follow. Which is more he follows up afterwards to make sure it is all clear. What other author does that!?
B0076UXKDG|5.0|Get ready to add some serious weight to an already heavy camera setup.  I have been doing photo shoots for long events, and this grips gives you the extra comfort of handling your camera, and peace of mind of having a second battery with you all the time.  Easy to install, and chaining batteries is a snap.  Haven't use the attachment for AA batteries, but is a good thing that is included inside the grip.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I know my review will be lost in the blizzard of comments readers have left, recommending this book for those who wish to make a scar on this world but I still want to be heard for something I love. The Fault In Our Stars walked on the edge on the crevices of my mind, extracting thoughts I have long kept hidden. It made me, I think, a better writer then I am which is a goal I have set for every book I read but only fulfilling it with few books. I can tell you what I thought, though meaningless with its over use, in a few simple words: I love it (present tense).
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|My review is basic. I could use a myriad of words to describe this amazing book. The author really plays up the love triangle and the sort of violent love vibe. I like how they would do anything for each other. It's artfully written as well.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect. I didn't really like the movie.  I loved the book! Can't wait to read the next one.
B00A2H9PLG|4.0|When I saw the trailer for this I went this is going to be awful. Boy i was wrong it was a great movie. I felt like it knew what it was and didn't take it's self serious.
B000HEWEDK|5.0|Classic science fiction movie. Brilliant for it's time. Oscar winner for special effects. Some movies made much later were not half as good.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|It's really fun to play. Good game. I recommend it to anyone. It's a bit addictive. I would give it 5 stars.
1490313370|5.0|Altucher had my entertained and enlightened from cover to cover. Not your everyday self-help book. A kick in the pants to go do what you always dreamed of.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's candy crush I played it on my other devices hence I was quite thrilled when Amazon afforded it to the kindle . The game is frustratingly addicted lolllll
B000AGTPUU|3.0|Young children (5-6 year olds) seem to enjoy the book more than the movie.  I think the movie is too long to hold their attention.
B00ECL7ZJ2|5.0|These three sisters from Southern Califonia are straight up musicians!  They write and play everything themselves, and it is crazy how talented they are.  Expect percussion-driven pop rock, a lot of which sounds like it could be from the 80s thanks to the use of the synth.  I find myself choosing a new favorite song every time I listen to Days Are Gone, but some of the definite stand out tracks are &#34;Forever,&#34; &#34;If I Could Change Your Mind,&#34; &#34;Don't Save Me,&#34; &#34;Falling,&#34; &#34;The Wire,&#34; &#34;Go Slow&#34;.. okay I'm just naming every track. The point is, do yourself a favor and buy this album.  TODAY!!
B00006JL1Z|4.0|Has mostly all the best songs - only missing Say You Will - volume is not consistent on every song
1577314808|2.0|I've heard good things about this book and thought I'd enjoy it. I'm working at  Mind Body Medicine site and it seemed like a good read. I was wrong. It was too foo-foo for me. I enjoy knowing the science behind things. It seemed too wordy and was difficult to enjoy.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Even though I never watched this movie and probably never will. We bought this for my daughter because its one of her favorite movies. Needless to say, she loves the movie. Great picture quality in the blu-ray version.
B00F8KIJ2I|5.0|I'm a huge and I mean huge avril lavigne fan since her first cd \\"let go\\". I didn't think I could like her more but I was soooo wrong. If you like or love avril lavigne you need this cd more than you need anything else in the wrold!!!
0385351399|5.0|As a professor of political science and information security policy at Iowa State University I strive to jolt my students into awareness of the zero privacy world in which we live. This excellent book can do that better than any textbook.<br /><br />Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg just bought four properties so he can have some privacy around his house. Privacy! ?Facebook?! The Zuck has recently stated that people should no longer expect any privacy anywhere, anytime. He said the the \\"social norm\\" of privacy no longer exists. Facebook and the other social media are now as powerful as the Vatican in reshaping society.<br /><br />The Circle is a daunting reminder that Orwell was right in 1984 the most chilling book. Big Brother IS watching you. And it's no longer the state, the government who is watching. It's also the business world from Google, to Amazon, Twitter, Facebook and every other networked platform. In fact your credit card company knows more about you than the National Security Agency. Actually, your wireless phone provider knows even more and shares that with the government Big Brother as we found out this year.<br /><br />Eggers Big Brother is the humongous corporation which works off the business model \\"All that happens must be known.\\"<br /><br />Really? Known by The Circle of course!<br /><br />To me the most telling, chilling maxim of The Circle is \\"Privacy is Theft.\\" Let that sink in for a minute.<br /><br />In the era of Big Data and pervasive surveillance when The Circle dominates, privacy is virtually prohibited and seen as socially unacceptable, perhaps even criminal.<br /><br />The novel is entertaining, often funny, sometimes deeply disturbing. It's a satire of brutal intensity which mocks the naïf geeks who populate the digital idealist ant hills of Silicone Valley. Oblivious of the dangerous mob rule of cyberspace, these denizens of data thrive in the moist world of crowd swarms, still convinced that stripping away all of the protections of anonymity produces a world of sharing and caring.<br /><br />Wrong!<br /><br />The heroine of this often amusing and entertaining novel Mae Holland becomes, as Michio Kakutani suggests in his review of this book, a \\"full time digital ninja.\\" She is a willing and eager implementer of her bosses corporate goals which are much more than a mere business model but instead are a cultural transformation, a revolution if you will, of society.<br /><br />Of course, Mae becomes entrapped in the metrics and demands of her employer which includes wearable life video 24-7 except for brief bathroom breaks. Thanks Google Glass!<br /><br />While fiction and often cleverly turning down unexpected pathways which I will not reveal, much of the minutia of corporate profit targets, pre-programmed feedback, and brutal demand on employees is all too real.<br /><br />My students and you will learn moral lessons and breathe quickly what little privacy from surveillance and total \\"transparency\\" we still have . Enjoy it with greater appreciation for the remaining freedom. On the other hand to my shock and despair most of my students don't care that their lives are, as we used to say, an open book. They say things like \\"I haven't done anything wrong so I don't care if the government or Facebook know everything about me.\\" All I can say is \\"yikes!\\"<br /><br />In the long run it seems doubtful, however, that we will be able to beat the monster of pervasive intrusion on our lives back into the steel box. We wanted the monster. We Tweeted \\"going to take a dump now at Panera!\\" \\"Got trashed at Whiskey River last night. Went home and hooked up with a blonde last night. LOL!\\" \\"Me in the shower! Haha. \\"<br /><br />\\"Selfie\\" is the newest word in the dictionary! \\"Look at me!\\"<br /><br />As a professor of information assurance and security policy I work on ways to better protect the personal data and information. There are days like today when I realize I am obsolete. There is no confidential, private information anymore and this excellent book nails the future world of pervasive transparency in a compelling fictional setting.<br /><br />You must read it and then ... weep.

B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|Brandon Sanderson continues to impress with his latest release &#34;Steelheart&#34;.  It's listed as a YA book, but it's very well written, completely engrossing and will certainly be enjoyed by any current Sanderson fans - regardless of age.  I'm not entirely sure how to categorize the book as it's almost a superhero story....except all the superheros are evil.  It really turns that particular genre on it's head in that regard.<br />The idea behind the story is that an event (calamity) occured a decade ago for some unexplained reason.  Because of that, certain people are endowed with superhuman powers.  Unfortunately, instead of using those new powers to aid humanity, all of those gifted (Epics) use thier new powers only for personal gain.  They are in the truest since of the word, anti-heros.  A small team of regular humans has banded together to try and fight against the epics.  They are called The Reckoners.  Our main character David, joins the Reckoners in an attempt to avenge his father - who died at the hands of Steelheart.  Steelheart is the most powerful of the epics and is the books namesake.<br />The characters (David and Megan in particular) have some great interactions as the story progresses at a very enjoyable pace.  In typical Sanderson style, he draws you into the story from page one.  He also is the most skilled writer I have ever read when it comes to introducing you to a whole new world, and making that world seem absolutely normal.  Sanderson is fantastic and this book is another winner in an already impressive resume' for him.  Very well done.  4.5 out of 5.
B00F8KIJ2I|5.0|It's hard to believe that Avril's been in the music industry for over a decade, it still feels like yesterday when she was dressed as a skater punk belting songs like &#34;complicated&#34; and &#34;I'm with you&#34;. Now, eleven years later, Avril's self-titles album, proves she's still in the game and deserves her rightful title as the &#34;mother-freaking princess&#34; of pop/rock.<br />1. Rock N Roll (5/5)<br />The album's explosive opener sounds familiar to the old avril fans, but not overdone. This song is the quintessence of a great pop/rock tune, fun lyrics, an amazing and ridiculously catchy chorus, vocals that remind us that Avril is one of the strongest singers among other pop artists, and a guitar solo that will definitely stay in your head for days. This song shows one of Avril's many strong suits, it's an anthem, and a great song to start the album with.<br />2. Here's To Never Growing Up (5/5)<br />The lead single, &#34;Here's To Never Growing Up&#34;, takes the listener down a nostalgic path, that reminds us of Avril's first single &#34;complicated&#34;. This song is driven by an acoustic guitar with a strong and catchy melody. However, the heart of this song lies in the chorus, it makes me want to belt it out every time. It's a great mid-tempo ode to Avril's first album &#34;Let Go&#34; which will certainly please the oldest fans.<br />3. 17 (5/5)<br />The nostalgic path continues with the power-pop anthem &#34;17&#34;, that tells the story of Avril's crazy antics when she was, and a relationship that clearly meant a lot to Avril. This is the first song off the album that really shows Avril's softer side, but more importantly her growth as a lyricist, one of my favorite lines from this song is in the first verse, &#34;tasted like cigarettes and soda-pop&#34;, it perfectly describes the moment and story. All the components of this song work really well together, the verses are strongly written and sung, the chorus shows off Avril's voice, the bridge is full of bittersweetness, and Avril's tone throughout song really fits.<br />4. Bitchin' Summer (4/5)<br />This song starts with a catchy acoustic guitar, (like the previous two songs), and quickly becomes a layer-back summer song about school being out, driving to the liquor store, and partying on the beach until the cops kick you off. Now I'm not quite sure how Avril is able to pull this off, but she does, and it sounds amazing. Then the song hits the bridge and Avril spits and awesome rap, completely unexpected, and it shows how versatile Avril can be.<br />5. Let Me Go (feat. Chad Kroeger) (4.5/5)<br />I really love this song, maybe not as much as some others on this album but its a solid, typical, Avril rock ballad with her new husband lead singer of Nickleback Chad Kroeger. Avril's vocals and songwriting take center stage in this song, she easily overshadows her husband, although his verse is strong, as Avril belts out the chorus about letting past loves and go and moving on. I really like the twist Avril and Chad put on the ending, they were able to make a break-up song with a happy ending as two adults without making it cheesy or monotonous. Also the outro of this song is ear-gasmic, absolutely awesome.<br />6. Give You What You Like (6/5) (STANDOUT)<br />WOW this song is amazing! So different, almost indie, amazing head-voice and lyrics by Avril, and the emotional appeal in this song is incredible. The song itself makes me think of a one-night-stand, when you're in the moment and you want something but after you get it all you want to do is forget. This song is sultry, sexy, mature, and without-a-doubt a standout from this album. I love the change of pace this album gets starting from this point. This song really puts every argument that Avril hasn't grown up to rest. This is REAL music, and I can only hope that more people will appreciate it.<br />7. Bad Girl (feat. Marilyn Manson) (5/5) (STANDOUT)<br />Two jaw-dropping tracks back to back, Avril has slayed me by this point. The eery beginning completely sums up the song, Manson says chillingly &#34;just lay your head on daddy's lap, you're a bad girl&#34;, and bam the electric guitar riff kicks in, an ultimate head-banging song. Seductive and over-the-top lyrics, vocals on the chorus that put artists like Katy Perry and Lady Gaga to shame, and instrumentation that successfully mixes bubble-gum metal, rock, and pop together, only Avril could... Another standout from the record.<br />8. Hello Kitty (3.7/5)<br />Well this album is full of curve-balls and this might be the biggest one. An electronic song by Avril Lavigne, sounds weird yes, and although I don't like electronic songs Avril can do it and make it sound like a strong song. This song's lyrics make me laugh, because of how outrageous they are, for instance &#34;let's all slumber part like a fat kid on a pack of smarties&#34;, they're so bad they're good, and very catchy. The song definitely has a lesbian underlying theme, and its beat and hook could unquestionably be played in the club, who knew Avril could pop, rock, and electronic.<br />9. You Ain't Seen Nothin' Yet (4/5)<br />The Best Damn Thing Avril, is that you? This song screams TBDT, which was Avril's third album in 2007. This song, which is awesomely and completely penned by Avril, takes me back to Avril's upbeat pop-rock (with a dash on punk) songs that she's so well-known for. It's very cute and feminine, with catchy hooks and killer bridge, perhaps the highest musical note hit by Avril is on this track. Very catchy, and fun listen.<br />10.Sippin' On Sunshine (4/5)<br />That bass guitar! I really love the bass line in this song, adds a really cool feature to this song. Sippin' On Sunshine is fun, light-hearted, and all about kicking it on the beach, laying in the sun, and spending time with that special someone, what's different about this song though is it's lyrics are a little more mature and strong than that of &#34;Bitchin' Summer&#34; and &#34;Here's To Never Growing Up&#34;.<br />11. Hello Heartache (5/5)<br />A really great mid-tempo song, that really makes the listener feel sympathetic with Avril. I mentioned before that Avril's tone on this record is impeccable, and this song along with the next two tracks really show that. She sounds broken and sad, just like she should with the message of this song. The lyrics are strong, the verses are somber and the chorus is drenched in sadness. I also really love the belt at the end of the bridge in this song. If there are any die-hard fans of Lavinge's previous record (Goodbye Lullaby) like myself, than you'll really love this track.<br />12. Falling Fast (5/5)<br />This track, which is also entirely written by Avril, is so soothing and melodic that I love to listen to it right before I go to sleep. Avril's voice sounds so pure and angelic in this song, it's very stripped down and perfectly describes the feeling everyone gets when they fall hard for somebody. I love the simile Avril uses in the second verse, &#34;I never knew I needed you like a sad song needs a sea of lighters&#34;, its so great and really attests to her song-writing capabilities. This is one of my favorites off the album.<br />13. Hush Hush (5/5) (STANDOUT)<br />What Avril album wouldn't end with a strong, emotional ballad. This song maybe Avril's saddest song against others like &#34;Remember When&#34;, &#34;Goodbye&#34;, &#34;Slipped Away&#34;, and &#34;When You're Gone&#34;. However, what makes this song different from previous Avril ballads is the message and tone. Avril usually lets her vocals go on a ballad, really belts out her feelings, however in this song she pulls back which brilliantly adds to the emotion behind this song. Instead of just focusing on her vocals in this ballad, she really poured her heart out into the lyrics and how she approached each note. After finishing listening to this song, every time, I get this strong and urgent sadness, the piano riff really gets me. Asong encompassing the true meaning of saying goodbye, and all the things that were left unsaid, and want to know the answers to questions that you can't. Another standout.<br /><br />All in all, an amazing and artistic album put together by Avril, that really shows who she is as an artist and person. Her writing has improved, her tone is the best I've heard her be, her voice is strong, powerful, and full of the vibrato that I love from her. Usually particular tracks make an Avril album special, however I would argue that every track adds something to this record and makes it her best effort yet.<br />My standouts (although I throughly enjoy every track)<br />&#34;17&#34;<br />&#34;Give You What You Like&#34;<br />&#34;Bad Girl (feat. Marilyn Manson)&#34;<br />&#34;Falling Fast&#34;<br />&#34;Hush Hush&#34;<br /><br />My Recommendations for previous Avril fans<br /><br />Fans of Let Go<br />&#34;Here's To Never Growing Up&#34;<br />&#34;Rock N Roll&#34;<br />&#34;Falling Fast&#34;<br />&#34;17&#34;<br />(maybe)&#34;Bitchin Summer&#34;<br /><br />Fans of Under My Skin<br />&#34;Let Me Go (feat.

B00AREIAI8|1.0|I really wish these &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; apps of the day would label themselves as what they really are: A Pay For Jems All The Time App. Because I'm used to appps moving in this &amp;#34;gems&amp;#34; direction, I really fail to see why My Horse is a game. Because the objective is NOT to level up or play the game, it's solely to spend hundreds of dollars leveing up that it's nearly impossible to do with regular game play.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Loved this!  Can't wait for the next chapter.  Just enough challenges to keep you wanting more.  Great graphics.  One of the best I've played.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|And now on my kindle too!!!  Love it.  Even my hubby plays.  Very happy there is now a kindle app.
B005I6EU7U|4.0|Great cover, I love the look of it; it fits my kobo arc almost like a glove (the one strap is over the volume buttons, but it works just fine)
0316067938|5.0|I bought this book used and it looks like new!!! Looks like it was never read. I never expected to buy a used book in such good condition!!
B00F3VOL38|3.0|Not as much 'new' material as the Vol 1.  Most are songs you have heard before, but they are very well done, and there are excellent interviews of the lads at the end.
B009NF54ZE|4.0|Nice and interesting with quite a bit of variation.  Also, a good little storyline to keep your interest up.<br />Not too difficult but my overly easy either.  Give it a try and I think you'll like it.
B002GYVRRI|5.0|This review is for all the Crimson 40th Anniversary releases, in that they all bring the music to a new sonic height.  The 5.1 versions simply create 'space' in your listening, and are best enjoyed with eyes closed, not trying to analyze the paticulars of which instrument is in which speaker, while the stereo versions are powerful adaptions that are MUCH better than any previous releases, including the excellent 30th Anniversary releases. And the best thing about this series is the price.  I have found each of the releases on Amazon or Ebay for about 25 dollars each, including shipping.  Look for other 5.1 releases and you will find these are sold at a fraction of other, less interesting material.  Any self-respecting Crimson fan will own all of these releases, and will thank him or herself, with each listen.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|Great to just kill time; hate the buying stuff. Wish crystals could be earned faster instead of being forced to buy to progress thru game at steady pace.
B00D8HNR5W|5.0|Trent Reznor at his best.  He has matured quite a bit, doing his work outside the NIN framework, which I always felt a lot of its material was a but immature, like a screaming kid.  If you liked some of Reznors work, the stuff that was not distored blasting, you will enjoy this cd.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Disappointing and cheesy conclusion to what started out as such a great series...  Disappointment is sure to follow to all that read this book.

0804162727|2.0|received my copy today and was impressed except for one thing.  The faux leather spine apparently tears unbelievably easy.  I received my copy with a puncture and tear in the book.  I give amazon 5 stars for sending another out hassle free but prima games gets 2 stars for terrible production.
B005APT8A8|5.0|No one had all of these albums, unless you were a Byrds freak.  It is a joy to discover all this excellent work, created so long ago, but sounding as if it were recorded yesterday.
B00F2RXROM|5.0|As a band they continue to be as dynamic as ever.  This album truly recaptures the old fire. Get this in your library.
B007P6VLRS|4.0|Corrigan has always been a surpurb songwriter, and performer.  Oceania is no exception.  His heavy metel stuff is weaker than his softer, melodic material, has always been, but some fans love it when he cranks it up.  Like his other cd's, this one has both deliverys.  Well worth the price, and essentual for any pumpkins fans.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|I saw the series and then read the book and it was interesting to see how the series had heightened themes in the book to make them more sensational. I liked the series but really enjoyed the book - PK comes across as very likable.
B000000W4M|3.0|Like most of pumpklins stuff, I like about half.  The half where he has actually written a melody and is singing, not blasting away at his guitar and screaming in the mike.  If you take all of Corrigans material, weed out the anxious stuff, and compile the rest, its is excellent listening.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is one of my favorite games I have ever played it is a lot like temple run I like Apple sauce

B00EW9GQR6|5.0|Some of the haters are saying this was a flop or &#34;her worst album&#34; but personally I feel like if you're a Gaga fan, you are going to love it, and if you are a casual fan of hers, there is plenty of catchy tunes to keep you satisfied. My favorites are Do What You Want, Gypsy, Venus, Mary Jane Holland, and Applause. But in all honesty, I LOVE each and every song. I do think The Fame and The Fame Monster were better, but I liked this much more than Born This Way.<br />This is an amazing album, Gaga can do no wrong.<br />4.75/5

B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|An entertaining and quick read about about technological, societal, and psychological changes taking place right before our eyes which offers a healthy note of caution (or warning) reminiscent of Orwell's 1984.  Parts of the book are predictable; there are a few loose ends that could have been tidied up; and the biological science is weak but these flaws aren't fatal.

Then again, the music landscape, at least on popular radio doesn't make any sense to me anyway, crapola.  I loved Love Tattoo, and this one follows up right where that one left off.  I love the real foot-stompers like Mayhem, Psycho, and Sneaky Freak.  This is a must-buy for any Imelda May fan.  Time for her to get a bit more recognition!

B00EAH3EAC|5.0|Though there are many new releases of old recordings of Benjamin Britten's monumental pacifist work during this centenary celebration, this new release is a magnificent addition to the performances captured on record. The Requiem is as poignant today as when it was written and performed and if history continues to repeat itself, very likely the work will continued to be performed when there is such a stringent dichotomy of opinion about war and the pity of war.<br /><br />In 1958, Britten was commissioned to write a piece for the consecration of England's rebuilt Coventry Cathedral -- which was all but destroyed by the German Luftwaffe in WWII. Yet instead of writing a conventional liturgical work, this lifelong pacifist juxtaposed the traditional Requiem Mass with antiwar poems by Wilfred Owen, a young soldier stuck in the trenches of WWI who was killed only a week before the armistice. As a gesture of reconciliation among three antagonistic WWII European powers, Britten wrote the individual vocal parts for a Russian soprano (Galina Vishnevskaya), a German baritone (Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau) and a British tenor (Britten's companion, Peter Pears). The recording of with those forces has just been released with a special rehearsal CD. There are fine recordings by  Richard Hickox, GIulini, Helmuth Rilling, Erich Leinsdorf, Robert Shaw, Kurt Mazur, William Hall, Robert Schafer, John Eliot Gardner, and Simon Rattle, but this new recording is deeply moving in impact and is graced by a splendid group of soloists.<br /><br />Antonio Pappano conducts the Orchestra dell'Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia and Coro dell'Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia and his control over both the chamber orchestra the accompanies the men soloists and the huge orchestra and chorus that sing the big pieces is exemplary. The demanding score of Britten's War Requiem includes a big orchestra, a small chamber orchestra, a large mixed choir, a boys' choir and three vocal soloists: a soprano, a tenor and a baritone. It is made up of different levels: the Latin text is sung by choir and soprano, and Wilfred Owen's verses are assigned to tenor and baritone parts, accompanied by the chamber orchestra. The piece is not only a religious invocation, but also a whole war scenario in which intimate reflection prevails. Pappano's performance entirely valued these differences and interwoven levels that create a comprehensive overview of war.<br /><br />Anna Netrebko brings a huge sound to her trying roles - the kind of sound too often missing who those who have always favored Galina Vishnevskaya's interpretation. Thomas Hampson is very comfortable in the baritone role but it is Ian Bostridge in the important tenor role that impresses most. His sensitivity to Wilfred Owen's poetry surpassed even Peter Pears. For those to whom Britten's mighty anti-war monument remains personally impactful, this recording is up there with the finest. Highly recommended. Grady Harp, November 13tenor and a baritone.

B009U9S6FI|5.0|His was a really good book, I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. The first half is about the time Frankl spent in the concentration camps. The second half I a bit more philosophical and talks about Frankl's theory that yo can't control what happens to you, only how you react to it. The book is a very easy read and was extremely well read. I read it over the course of a few days as its such a great book that I could not put it down. I decided to read this book after reading the 7 Habits of Highly Effective People in which the author gave this book high praises.

B00DEFW998|3.0|Anoushka Shankar's previous albums \\"Rise\\" & \\"Traveller\\" may be recognizable to Western audiences due to the PR surrounding those projects at the time, but \\"Traces of You\\", her 2013 record, arrived with far less fanfare, despite it being in parts even better than her past works. Anoushka's training under the tutelage of her father Ravi Shankar seems to really showcase itself here - comparing this to her debut album that was striking in its ineptitude in parts, this one is a welcome relief & only goes to show how hard she has been working on her craft. She plays her instrument with the skill of an old hand, and wisely chooses melodies that highlight her excellent skills (something that was sorely missing on `Traveller', despite most people falling for it as it had more of a `world music' feel to it, and wasn't a traditional Indian classical album like her earlier \\"Anourag\\" was).<br /><br />The highlight for most people who gravitate toward this record is that it features Anoushka's sister Norah on a handful of tracks - and whether or not this is enough to make people want to purchase this is up in the air, but in my estimation it perhaps was a most ill-advised move, as the Norah tracks are the most jarring & at times even cringe-worthy. Consider the pathetic songwriting on \\"Unsaid\\", which is supposed to be a heartfelt ode of some sort, but one listen to the amateur songwriting & you wonder how Norah could even sign up for something so decidedly mediocre. Certainly, Anoushka's sitar skills on this one are sublime, but they deserve a far better track. Easily the most disposable track on the entire album; but things don't altogether get better with the opening track \\"The Sun Won't Set\\", which consists of exactly two lines repeated ad nauseum in the hopes it will somehow function as a passable chorus (\\"The sun won't set, not now not yet\\"). When a song elicits laughs more than appreciation, there is definitely an issue at hand; one that again appears on the title track \\"Traces of You\\" (also the official first single), which is a much better example of how a Norah and Anoushka collaboration should sound. It isn't especially pathbreaking, but is sweet and pleasant and altogether serviceable, and I suppose if you go in with minimal expectations you might come away feeling halfway pleased.<br /><br />The rest of the record is where the true talent lies, as its stripped down and features just Anoushka and her instrument - most beautifully evident on \\"Flight\\", which might easily be the best track here. Going back to some of her raga-based classical Indian roots is a good move on a record that seems just so scattered with those Norah collaborations, and once again reminds us why Anoushka is a worthy heir to her fathers' many talents. Along the way, she also pays homage to an Indian victim of abuse (a well documented case in India in 2013), celebrates Indian monsoons, walks us through the stages of illusion in \\"Maya\\", and celebrates her fathers' life on the touching instrumental piece \\"Fathers\\" (which thankfully Norah doesn't ruin with her voice as she isn't even featured). Heres the thing, if you were waiting around for a delicious collaborative record between the two sisters, this one definitely is not that project. Norah's husky voice just seems out of place and jarring in a setting as serene as Indian sitar playing, and try as she might, Anoushka's attempts to pair her instrument with her sisters' voice just doesn't work. They had three songs here to prove that they could harmonize, and each one only proves that they cannot. Pleasant enough, but I can't imagine anyone wanting to sit through an entire album of their bizarre musical pairing. There is something off with the way they try to be in sync - I can't put my finger on it, but I sure don't want them to team up again anytime soon if their results are this mediocre.<br /><br />To sum up, I give this three stars. It would have been a four star record if Norah hadn't been on it. Unfortunately, she is, so there goes that plan.nately, she is, so there goes that plan.

B00AZMFK3K|5.0|My wife and I enjoyed this film greatly.  If you enjoyed (or even if you just thought it was ok) the first film in JJ Abrams reboot of the classic series, then you will enjoy this film.  Cumberbatch does an excellent job as the movie's antagonist and makes a good compliment to the established cast, which have great onscreen chemistry and a good grasp of the original character's identities.<br />Worth noting, however, is that if you are a stickler for the old series' cannon then you may not be able to enjoy this film.  The previous movie utilized a good plot device to account for this and give a great explanation for whatever creative decisions the writers decide to go with.  However, some do not like anything that deviates from what they know and this is a deal breaker for them.  Forewarned is forearmed.<br />Outside of that, the pacing is excellent with terrific visuals and an exciting story.  This is a fun blockbuster film.

0393345408|3.0|A very readable book, which is saying something when the subject is economics. Sharma provides plenty of quantitative data as well as anecdotal accounts in his analysis. Possibly he has correctly identified the next break-out nations. However the book does have some issues: 1. The basis of the book is economic data. Analysis of China's future also needs to consider the possible impact of Chinese political ambitions and potential impact on countries like Japan, Philippines, Vietnam, India etc. Maybe a shooting war will not start, but if it does (as the parallels being drawn between the rise of China and the rise of imperial Germany hint), all bets in Asia would be off, something the author fails to acknowledge. 2. The book also favours growth-oriented political regimes. Cases where such regimes (even if very corrupt) have come to power or have been re-elected are showcased as enjoying popular public support and ensuring continuity of such regimes. While that may be the case, it doesn't take long for electorates to swing (especially when they get tired of corruption) from growth towards socialist regimes - something that is not limited to developing countries. In other cases, the regime itself may move from growth to populism (as happened in India). 3. While the book quotes a lot of economic data, a fact sheet comparing data across the countries analysed has not been provided. Possibly this is because different data has been quoted for different countries. While thumbnail rules have been liberally scattered across the book, the measuring scale is not always uniform. 4. It tilts quite a bit towards favouring conservative economics (cut the deficit, balance the budget et al). While this works well in most cases, claiming Keynesian economics did not help during the Great Depression is going a bit too far. Also hinting that the Hayek school of thought was responsible for US economic growth in the 1940s seems to discount events like a world war which happened during the period with it's consequent economic impact. 5. Finally, the book ignores parameters like Purchasing Power Parity and education levels (and quality) of different countries. A person earning $15000 annually in the Philippines would be much better off than a person earning $15000 in Poland.  For all that, the book is still a good read. However it would be helpful to keep some caveats in mind while reading it.

B003XRELGQ|4.0|This book was considerably different from other KV I have read. Mostly it was how the story started contrasted with how it finished. In the beginning it lacked plot and structure, chapters were super short (20 chapters in 30pages, or so) and felt a poignant as wandering. In the end it all pulled together and turned out to be a pretty good story. I think it would make a better movie than a novel, really.

1455523003|4.0|I once designed a scheme of work for Year Nine religious Education aimed at critically evaluating the cult of personality. I entitled it ‘Mother Teresa: Saint of Bitch?’ This attracted a lot of flak, though I stand by what I had written and the graphic terms that I had used.<br /><br />Mother Teresa is revered by millions who, if they knew what was really going on in this woman’s life, would be shocked. Hitchens has delivered the shock but most people are in denial.<br /><br />Hitchens lays much of the blame on the book and film ‘Something beautiful for God by Malcolm Muggeridge. He hints that Muggeridge whitewashed Mother Teresa as a saint because of his Catholicism. The reality is the other way round. Muggeridge was so impressed by what he saw that he converted to Catholicism afterwards. However, this does not undermine what Hitchens write.<br /><br />‘Saints, it seems, are immune from audit,’ wrote Hitchens. Millions of dollars of charitable giving poured in to the coffers on Mother Teresa’s Sisters of Charity but it just sits in a bank account until such time as there is a media opportunity for the ‘saint’ to open a new refuge.<br /><br />One donation ‘for her work’ was spent on a ciborium and chalice fore the chapel.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the homes run by the sisters resemble the workhouse more than the hospice… No drugs are given: a fifteen-year-old had a kidney infection which could be treated fairly cheaply at a hospital but this wasn’t allowed ‘because all the others will want it’. So he is left to die without painkillers, like all the rest. There is no triage to decide who could benefit most from the limited (virtually nil available – because all the money is in the bank) resources. Needs are washed, not sterilised. What’s the point if they catch an infection, they seem to argue? They will all die anyway. Suffering is gods for them. It is a way in which they share in the suffering of Jesus, whether they want to or not. (Sothey weren't allowed to watch the Olympics. This would detract from their suffering.)<br />This didn’t stop Mother Teresa, who had heart problems, frequently checking in to expensive, state of the (Western) art, private hospitals herself.<br /><br />For all that she was supposedly above politics, she was happy to have photo opportunities with some of the world’s most corrupt dictators.<br /><br />She wrote a letter to a judge, pleading for clemency, for a fraudster who’d wrecked the lives of many poor families. The letter is full of pious clichés and it was good to read the reply, which quoted scripture against her, on the lines of it always being good to ‘love mercy’ but the prophet also stressed that it was important to ‘do justice’.<br /><br />When asked what was an appropriate response to genocide and disasters, her words usually were ‘Forgive. Forgive.’ This sounds like a mature spirituality but it’s easy to mouth such words. Has anyone asked for forgiveness? What about contrition and resolve to amend?<br /><br />There a few rants against the Roman church’s opposition to abortion and birth control. Fair enough, but I would have liked more about the work of the sisters. Then again, the work was underpinned by these beliefs.

1849808376|5.0|[[VIDEOID:moI5XMVREZUA6V]]<br />EX-NADER'S RAIDER TELLS ALL<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />Woe betide the poor whistleblower, especially if he, or she has blown said whistle for the best of reasons and the noblest of motives! While one has little sympathy with deliberate mischief-makers, those who `blow the whistle' on wrongdoing of whatever kind are likely to be acting in the public interest and therefore deserve all the protection from vengeful comeback that the law allows.<br /><br />Whether originating in the USA, or in other jurisdictions worldwide, whistleblower laws, with all their ramifications, are critically examined in this book, published recently by Edward Elgar.  The author, Robert G. Vaughn, a Professor of Law at the American University Washington college of Law, draws on his forty year experience as a lawyer and researcher to create a primarily historical overview and analysis of `whistleblower' legislation.<br /><br />Vaughn's perspective on these matters is nothing if not unique. As a recent law graduate back in the 1970s,  he joined the law firm of one Ralph Nader, the lawyer who made systematic war on General Motors over their Corvair motor car which was eventually proved to be 'unsafe at any speed'.<br /><br />As one of the famed `Nader's Raiders', Robert Vaughn was seconded to work on a project involving civil service reform and  experienced the consequences, which included surveillance and a sense of threat. `The attempts of governments and corporations to harass and undermine whistleblowers and citizen activists in ways similar to Nader's treatment resonated for me,' he recalls.<br /><br />In surveying the history of whistleblowing in this unique book, Vaughn is no mere ivory-tower academic propounding theories.  He has actually experienced what it is like to be a whistleblower himself and has interviewed many others.<br /><br />One should recall here, that not all whistleblowers are as savvy, organised and determined as Ralph Nader - and they're not usually trained lawyers either. They generally fall into the category of `ordinary people', often vulnerable, who desperately need and deserve the law's protection and the means of accessing it.<br /><br />If you're a lawyer, academic, student, or someone who is fascinated by this continuingly fascinating subject, you should enjoy this book.<br /><br />It covers all pertinent aspects of whistleblower laws from various perspectives, societal as well as legal and includes actual stories of whistleblowers, which serve, in the author's words, `to instruct and guide' and which  `make the successes and failures of whistleblower laws concrete rather than abstract, personal rather than statistical, and emotional as well as analytical.'<br /><br />Exciting, topical, as well as precisely analytical, this book examines a vast range of incidents and issues related to whistleblowing.  It will appeal not just to practitioners and other professionals, but to a wider public internationally. Copiously footnoted, with a detailed index it contains a mine of references for further research. It may well be destined to become a classic.histleblowers are as savvy, organised and determined as Ralph Nader - and they're not usually trained lawyers either. They generally fall into the category of `ordinary people', often vulnerable, who desperately need and deserve the law's protection and the means of accessing it.<br /><br />If you're a lawyer, academic, student, or someone who is fascinated by this continuingly fascinating subject, you should enjoy this book.<br /><br />It covers all pertinent aspects of whistleblower laws from various perspectives, societal as well as legal and includes actual stories of whistleblowers, which serve, in the author's words, `to instruct and guide' and which  `make the successes and failures of whistleblower laws concrete rather than abstract, personal rather than statistical, and emotional as well as analytical.'<br /><br />Exciting, topical, as well as precisely analytical, this book examines a vast range of incidents and issues related to whistleblowing.  It will appeal not just to practitioners and other professionals, but to a wider public internationally. Copiously footnoted, with a detailed index it contains a mine of references for further research. It may well be destined to become a classic.
B00F2LIV4E|4.0|Slick and polished, sure? As great as the middle years of DT? Not necessarily. A good purchase but left me wanting just a bit more from them.
1849801010|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo1SXSBV1WT536N]]<br />OPINION AND ANALYSIS<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />You can tell from the seventh word in the title: this book is American and deals with the various symbiotic links between law and economics pertaining to labor (excuse me, labour) and employment legislation Stateside.  We'll say no more about US v. British spelling except to recall that on the US side, it's part of the legacy of Benjamin Franklin's high minded attempts to reform the spelling of English words.  Good thing he wasn't entirely successful.<br /><br />But we digress.  What we will say is that if you are involved in any way with matters pertaining to trades union and /or employment legislation, you'll find this book an enlightening read no matter which side of the Pond you are on.<br /><br />Yes, it focuses on the American context, but all the better for that.  Particularly if you are UK-based, you will find yourself intrigued by the similarities and more interestingly, the differences between the UK trades union ethos and mind-set and that which prevails regarding organised labour in the United States.<br /><br />The book is a compilation of sixteen learned articles from seventeen top academics all of whom, including the two editors, are experts in this field.  Cynthia Estlund and Michael Wachter in their introduction, refer to `the integration of these two disciplines i.e. law and economics as having evolved over more or less the last 30 years, with roots in Roosevelt's New Deal in the 1930s.  Although such linkage of the two subject areas has not been without controversy, it is now acceptable among most that both are now integrated into labour and employment law scholarship.<br /><br />It is further pointed out that the law governing the employment relationship and labour relations is a natural field for economic analysis.  Fundamentally, labour and employment law are about voluntary contractual relations, which in turn will affect such factors as price, cost, supply and demand.  `It might seem inevitable,' argue the editors, `that economic analysis would make up a major art of legal scholarship in this area.'<br /><br />Well, we are not arguing - and impressed by the scope and scholarship contained in this book, which, for the opinions expressed and the research tools provided, is a boon to the research community on both sides of the Atlantic, whether the area of inquiry is law or economics-based. Topics covered include traditional labour law and organisation as well as all pertinent aspects of employment law, including contract, termination, discrimination, employee mobility and the forum and remedies for claims.<br /><br />The references to `neoclassical labor economics' are rather interesting in that, for example, they tend to convey a tone of approval rather than disapproval of market forces - supply and demand models and so forth.  Example: `... competitive markets are efficient because they maximize the total income that the economy can produce'.  One wonders what many of our trades union folk in the UK would think of that.<br /><br />The book certainly offers interesting perspectives on employee-employer relationships, often a fraught and politically divisive subject, which is why you should read it.  The extensive footnoting, reams of references and the detailed index provide any number of avenues for further research.l relations, which in turn will affect such factors as price, cost, supply and demand.  `It might seem inevitable,' argue the editors, `that economic analysis would make up a major art of legal scholarship in this area.'<br /><br />Well, we are not arguing - and impressed by the scope and scholarship contained in this book, which, for the opinions expressed and the research tools provided, is a boon to the research community on both sides of the Atlantic, whether the area of inquiry is law or economics-based.

B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Even Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of The Crystal Skull can't take away any stars from this set because the wealth of special features combined with the absolutely beautiful transfers and remastered audio for the films themselves make this Indy set a must buy. Last Crusade looks absolutely stunning but the best looking disc of the bunch is the one you'll probably watch the least, the aforementioned Crystal Skull, being that it's the most recently released film of the four. The less we talk about that movie, the better. All the films look and sound great but from the first three films, Last Crusade has a picture that just jumps off the screen. Raiders manages to retain that Douglas Slocombe feel in its transfer and while it's not a pitch perfect transfer, it's still really, really good. I love Temple of Doom unabashedly and the picture looks pretty good also.<br /><br />There's a great set of extras also and any Indy enthusiast would be pleased by what's offered here. The case is also nicely designed and represents the Indiana Jones aesthetic very well. If you want the Indy films on Blu, you probably won't get them in a better state than you do here and what is here is well done. Totally recommended.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a super fun game and saves big time over tossing away pocket fills of quarters away in the real thing.
B00FPH6AXE|4.0|will smith does it yet again a mans man even when he is just stuck with 2 broken legs ill watch again
B0052RDHTM|5.0|The history was fascinatingly revealing, but it was the characters from all over the world, tied together in great back stories, that engaged me deeply and held my interest cover to cover.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|cheesy but ok watched with my wife and kids not a bad plot but kind of predictable at times l
B00G6SDX36|5.0|The case is definitely worth the money. Arrived exactly as shown.<br />I will buy again and it did come with the screen protector. Love it! Shows off my gold 5S perfectly!
B00CDT41RY|5.0|so good we went out and bought it that should sum it up for you Quentin doesn't disappoint but if you are offended by the<br />N word this isn't for you
B002VPE1AW|5.0|fast and love it<br />it is as the ad said.I will use them again if I need another  dvd movir.
0804162727|5.0|I love this beautiful guide. This guide had beautiful pictures and it shows how to find the power ups, the pieces of heart, and weapons, it had the maps of dungeons and Hyrule, how to beat mini-games, It shows where to go next, and how to beat the bosses. If you have any problems, you can buy this guide and I promise that this guide is very helpful.
B00FP1NNJY|5.0|I do not care for the picture on the cover.  However, the song is super fun. Cannot stop playing it!
B0007TKNII|5.0|It would be impossible to rate this movie as anything else but perfect when I hear my 6-year old granddaughter walking down the street singing some of the music from this movie.  She watches it over and over and loves it as I do.
B004AQR29C|2.0|I am surprised at how bad this movie is. The stars combined to make this a really poor movie with laughable fight scenes.
B000683VI4|5.0|It is not often that I say that the movie is as good as the book, but in this case, it is true.  I loved the book and I loved the movie.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|This is awesome and fun app to play you put your brain to the test on what to do fast.
B00C5R7B0I|3.0|I've read her other books and know her characters well. This book wallowed in the characters - Benton so classic, so remote, so faultless; Scarpetta so perfect - her work, her cooking, her reaction, her emotions. Cornwell' s plots usually save the day, but not this time. It was contrived and disjointed, existing only to showcase Scarpetta and her beloved Benton. I did like the further development of Lucy as a character, for once not just focused on her sexual orientation, and alluding to sociopathic tendencies, but she also is over-the-top - too brilliant, too rich, and always too involved with her aunt's professional career. Hard to relate to any of it.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This is one of the rare paid applications that I use and that's for a good reason - it's the best keyboard app on the market without a doubt.
B004G6009U|5.0|Love, Love, Love this movie! The songs are fun to sing and the story is a great Disney Classic. Even my 2 year old enjoys watching and singing the songs! If you have a little girl and she enjoys singing, magic and Princesses, Watch this!!!
B009NF54ZE|4.0|I am really enjoying this game of hunt and find. At least it got me away from candy crush which only gives you a play every 30 minutes.
0765325950|4.0|A generally satisfying ending to the series.  A few things felt a little left out or ignored, and a few parts felt a little artificially extended, but overall I was happy with this ending.  Well worth the read for any fans of the series.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Highly Enjoyable and addictive hidden object game, need more crystals....fast. Are there any other ways to collect crystals other than levelling up?
B008Y5T5ZE|2.0|Not a quality story that needed telling. You will benefit from not watching. Time you'll never get back.Don't do it.  . . No
B00GN76K4Y|5.0|Daily it's on kindle this game is soooooooooooo.  I played it on my sister's iPod  I'm no happy. :-) like it stop it.gosh :-))
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is Fun to play!! I love games like this and it is so addicting!! Most of my friends play it too!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games is a book you just have to read. It's exciting, romantic and mind-blowing at the same time. When I first got the book I couldn't put it down. At all. It's a great investment.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This is a great point and click game. at least its a lot longer then most hidden object games that I have played in the past.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|Super fun, challenging too.  Very addictive game, with several levels very every ability. I would recommend this to both adults and kids alike.
B008MWBY6W|4.0|Wasn't expecting much since it's a relatively inexpensive product. I managed to snag it during the black friday deals for $16.87.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Very well constructed<br />Durable nylon material<br />Substantial padding to protect from bumps and minor drops<br />Convenient pockets for memory cards and other small items.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Plastic D-rings and strap clips<br /><br />My only complaint about this product are the plastic D-rings and clips that hold the strap to the case. The clips especially feel like a low-grade plastic that I fear will eventually break. It seems to me it wouldn't have been much more costly to use metal hardware with locking clips. (I would pay 10-15 dollars extra for the piece of mind). Otherwise I can't complain, the price was right considering other holster type camera cases can be in the 50-60 dollar range. I'm happy with my purchase.
B00FN811SY|5.0|This is a great apt.<br />No one else comes close to the resources of this apt in learning the Bible and in its study friendly profile.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|It was a very informative read while maintaining a relatable and humorous voice. Detailed presentation of life on the inside, and the flaws that accompany it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game it is so entertaining I had my little brother try it and he can do it to the game isn't to easy but anyone can play it! You will want to get this app!
B00003CXCT|3.0|When I purchased these I was under the impression that I was purchasing the original theatrical version.  I.e. the one where han shot first.  I was sorely dissapointed to find that it was not.  I see the current posting makes it very clear that this is the molested version.  When I purchased it it was not clear.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game such a relaxing way to spend ur evening seems like a real horse. I love it
B001AKTZOQ|4.0|Great choice for Rollin' on down the road on a carefree sunny Day! only thing I didn't need was a couple of replays of songs we'd already heard. Really liked the rendition of &#34;Before You Accuse Me&#34;!  All-in-All  a  good, play over again, Rock-a-billy album!
B008EKMB82|3.0|Took too long to get into.. but then becomes enjoyable. I read it for a book club and then didn't finish it. didn't think I would after the meeting. but surprised myself to pick it up and read it to find out how it ended.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|I don't remember the last time I read a book of this quality. I would wake up during the night and start reading because I just couldn't put it down.
B005LN5UOC|1.0|It won't stay on my ear.  I was so tired of trying to use headsets that I thought this would be the perfect solution but it won't stay on.  The earpiece doesn't mold to your ear so when you stick the earbud in the ear canal, thhe part that goes over your ear is waving like a flag in the air so if you move it's gonna fall out.  I'm dumbfounded that they would make an earpiece non-adjustable.  I'm a small female so maybe they figure that only large males play on a playstation.  My teenage daughter will be shocked to hear that.  lol
B00G4NUQYM|5.0|This is a great game to exercise the mind and learn new words. Even familiar words can become a challenge when the letters have been split up in an unfamiliar manner and scrambled with other words similarly split up. Great game!!!
145580570X|5.0|An excellent overview of the brain's plasticity and how humans can learn throughout their lives. The work being done with learning disabled people shows that there are pathways to learning in everyone. Even more stunning is Doidge's accounts of how stroke victims can relearn to use afflicted limbs and their voices.
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|A powerful story of self destruction and denial.  Having been self destructive I could relate.  It was a difficult to watch movie, but a very moving experience.  Highly recommend!
