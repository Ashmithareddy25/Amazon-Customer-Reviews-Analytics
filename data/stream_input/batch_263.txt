B00004TH83|5.0|such a pure voice and such a great talent...it's sad that she is'nt getting the glamour and the success she deserves in the US.<BR>this CD is more than excellent, the music and the words are just awsome, and Lara sings with such a burning passion...<BR>so please Lara, more CD's...
B00005YW4H|5.0|Listening to this woman's voice is like nails tearing into me.  It hurts, but few things are able to scratch that deep; it's refreshing.  She is able to convey some actual emotion into her words.  The music seems somehow classic, like it should belong on vinyl.  <BR>     The album seems short ,thankfully it doesn't grow tiresome after being repeated again and again.  I hope you enjoy it as well.
031286504X|3.0|Not quite all it could be...just settling down to enjoy a good novel that would hopefully last a week or so, and finished it in one night. Felt it had a lot more to offer, even though it did have a relatively satisfying ending. Brief, shocking and to the point, the story is luridly entwined around one man's stance against loneliness, and how he responds to unexpected development. Excellent scientific and biological descriptions of vampire anatomy, good characterisation and solid emotional descriptions, but once again, the tale winds down prematurely. Saddened that the second half of the book is filled with four-page long short stories that, although well written, would better serve as furthered chapters of the headline title.<br />Still waiting for more.....
B00005JKQZ|3.0|But, it deviated so much from true events. Ron Howard should have respected Mr. Nash's life, and not attempt to make this a moral story of triumph over mental illness. The biography is much more interesting. I recommend the book.
B00003CXAY|2.0|The quality of the picture is much less than any DVD I've seen before.  Indeed, dust and scratches appear throughout both DVDs.  I'm a big fan of both of these movies, but the DVDs just do not do them justice both in terms of video and sound quality.
B00003CX95|5.0|Braveheart is my favorite movie of all time!.Mel gibson gives a great perfomance and he also won an oscar for directing this movie (Braveheart won 5 oscar awards).I enjoy to watch the bonus cd with the interviews with Mel Gibson & Randel Wallace and the rest of the cast.If you didnt see it,you must see this movie! This was my first movie i ever buy on dvd and i be save it forever to show it to my children too.Im only 20 so i stil have time...the sound-Track for this movie is also great!

B00005QXXO|4.0|Originally intended as a CD single for &quot;I Might Be Wrong (Live)&quot;, Radiohead issued this short (40 min.) live album to remember their 2001 tour. It is an unintended &quot;best of&quot; compliation of the Kid A and Amnesiac albums, and works quite well.<br />The album contains pretty straight-forward live versions of &quot;The National Anthem&quot;, &quot;I Might Be Wrong&quot;, &quot;Morning Bell&quot;, &quot;Idioteque&quot;, and &quot;Dollar and Cents&quot;. The album really delivers with different takes on &quot;Like Spinning Plates&quot; and, foremost, &quot;Everything in its Right Place&quot;, giving a truly grand outro of synth distortion. The inclusion of Thom Yorke solo on &quot;True Love Waits&quot; is the icing on the cake.<br />Almost a year after this came out, for whatever reason, I find myself playing this CD more than either of Kid A (which is superb) or Amnesiac (which I found a disappointment). This is a great 40 min. of music, period.
B00005A1PR|4.0|A guitar-playing talent with a love for the warmth of real strings and percussion who eschews over-production and electronic treatments, Ms. Arie has made a disc of soulful R&B songs that resonate with the timeless quality often missing in today's radio-friendly music.  In addition to the song that did become a radio hit, \\"Video,\\" (which patiently states that as a woman confident in her own skin, she brooks no comparison to the stereotypical fashion model females flaunted in videos), \\"Simple,\\" and \\"Strength, Courage, and Wisdom,\\" are notable tracks. Using folk sensibilities along the lines of early Ani Difranco, or Tracy Chapman, but with a straight-ahead R&B feel, India Arie records with what could be described as stunning simplicity and grace, welcome in year of glitzy, overwrought, over-dramatised work.
B00004VXF2|3.0|(Music: 1 star. Historical Value: 5 stars)<br />Imagine a rock star/group issuing a totaly unlistenable album at the height of his/her/its commercial peak. It's unthinkable and has never been done EVER, except by Lou Reed. After scoring big with the \\"Transformer\\" (1972), \\"Berlin\\" (1973) and \\"Sally Can't Dance\\" (1974) albums, Reed came back with the (then double-vinyl) album \\"Metal Machine Music (An Electronic Instrumental Composition)\\", a 64 min. oddisey of guitar-whaling, feedback cacophony. It dropped jaws in the music biz then,,, and now. Reed himself said that \\"Anyone getting to Side 4 is dumber than me\\".<br />No, I don't play this album often. And when I do, it's for a 5 min. or so, just making me shake my head... what was Lou Reed thinking? Reed has been very silent over the years about the reasons for doing it. What we are left with is this reissue, which comes with nice liner notes. Not a must in anyone's CD collection, except to own a little piece of rock's history.
B00005B36H|5.0|Tool is one of the few bands that have consistently put out good product since its inception in 1991, when its vocalist and guitarist decided to start a project dedicated to the theories of a mysterious text called The Joyful Guide to Lachrymology.  Their fourth effort (preceded by Aenima in 1996, Undertow in 1993, and the EP Opiate in 1992) manages to satisfy their fans' extremely high expectations and in the process, raise the bar once again for their contemporaries.   An album that plays well from start to finish without discernible flaw or break in mood, Lateralus conjures fond memories of the way Led Zeppelin's Presence flowed, and the sort of amazing extended-length atmospheric songs that Rush used to craft, such as \\"La Villa Strangiato.\\"  Actually, those who will try to categorise Tool can only fail-sure, they fall somewhere in the hard-rock-to-metal genre, but nothing can adequately describe the fragile combination of raw power and ethereal beauty that their music imparts.  Stop reading, stop pigeonholing, put on the headphones, and pump up the volume.  Rest assured, you'll reach all the right conclusions.
6305531374|4.0|Once upon a time, way back in 1978, there was a little independent film released at the wrong time of year for its title:  Halloween.  Halloween was not only the first of its kind (in a very long time), but it provided its horrors elegantly and suspensefully, not grotesquely and blatantly.  It was the first film from director John Carpenter (waaaaaay before he insisted that his name go above the titles of his increasingly bad movies).  Halloween's popularity inspired not only imitations galore (Friday the 13th, The Burning, etc.), but its own sequels.  The first sequel (Halloween II) continued the horrors set up in the original on the same evening of the original (but this time full of gore), employing the newly crowned queen of scream, Jamie Lee Curtis, as the star just off her turn in the original.  This was a coup that made the sequel a huge hit too.  Then the misery began....<br />Someone in Hollywood got the bright idea to change the Halloween films into a brand name.  Thus was born Halloween III:  Season of the Witch.  This film had absolutely nothing to do with the first two films and it also had absolutely nothing to do with horror or scares (unless you count the horror of paying to watch such dreck).<br />Halloween IV through VI were sequels to the first two Halloweens, but their premise and association was only remotely attached (Halloween V was a decent delivery, but only when seen as a stand alone film).<br />Halloween H2O was a return to the original franchise.  All the press that came out on the film told viewers that this film is the real sequel to Halloween II.  In other words, it is the real Halloween III.  This was a wise move.  Not only do we have a return to the original story basis, but we are given a return of the original Halloween heroine - Jamie Lee Curtis (no longer a newbie, but a seasoned and accomplished actress, who has the Halloween films to thank, in part, for her success).<br />It is 20 years later (thus the 20, part of the title - the H refers to Halloween - get it? - Halloween 20 years later).  Laurie Strode is alive and disturbed after the horrors of that night some twenty years earlier.  She is a mental basket case, a functioning alcoholic, single mother to Josh Hartnett, and the head mistress of a toney boarding school in the middle of nowhere California.  Having faked her death many years earlier to avoid the infamy of the horrors of that long ago night (and to hide from her brother Michael, whom she still believes to be alive), she lives as much of a normal life as she can.  Only her son and she knows who she really is.<br />Of course, Michael is no more dead, than the Pope is Jewish.<br />Halloween H20 does some really neat things that make this film seem not only like a real sequel, but a welcomed return by an old friend.  For example, the opening scene features a nurse returning home from work - the nurse seems oddly familiar - and rightly so - if you remember waaay back, it is the same nurse who accompanied Donald Pleasance to the insane asylum the night that Michael Myers originally escaped in 1978.  The same actress is used.  I don't think she's ever done another film between these two films, but darned if I didn't like that continuity!<br />Also, Jamie Lee's secretary at the school is none other than her very own \\"real life\\" mother:  Janet Leigh.  This is a really cool cameo, because it offers us a nod to the Hollywood legacy that Jamie Lee inherited, but it also ties in the horror connection as well - Janet was the first to die in the Great Grandfather of all slasher films:  Psycho!  Now, the filmmakers decided to go even one better, which is the most delicious part of all to the cameo.  The car the secretary drives is the exact - and I do mean exact same car that Janet Leigh drove in Psycho.  Plus - Plus - if you listen carefully, you will hear the music change very briefly to the Bernard Hermann score from Psycho.  It is a very cool cameo!!<br />Halloween H20 is really a fine sequel and is deserving of being the real Halloween III.  No longer just a weakling girl who runs from Michael, Laurie stands up to him and shows her mettle.  This is not only within character, but necessary in light of the female empowerment movies that would not allow her to do otherwise (Sigourney Weaver in Aliens, anyone?).<br />Rent this film, because it is not only a good fright film, but it is an worthy descendent of the original film.
B00005JKWJ|2.0|The original Blade was a much better film.  Blade I's story was solid and the characters quite interesting.  I expected the sequel to be even better but unfortunately it relied too much on uninteresting special effects, the wrestling scenes were a joke, and gore.  The character Whistler had much more dialogue and actual &quot;Character&quot; in the first Blade film as did Blade himself.  The Vampires (The Blood Pack) in Blade II were in no way frightening or even semi believable.  Ron Perlman was good in City of lost children and Enemy at the gates and is obviously a better actor than portrayed in Blade II.  The first couple of minutes of the film was great with the &quot;blood bank&quot; scenes in the train station but it quickly went down hill with a thud.  Buy the original and get a memory wipe in regards to Blade II (I hope Blade III gets this series back on track).
6304602979|5.0|The first film ever written by Tarantino shows no differences of his other movies. Just like Pulp Fiction and Resevior Dogs, True Romance keeps you in your seat the entire movie and offers a great variety of violence and crime. I wish Tarantino could have directed this movie because I believe it would have been up there with Pulp Fiction as one of the best crime thrillers of all time if he did, however Tony Scott did a fabulous job.<br />The bloody stand-off at the end of True Romance reminds me so much of the Resevior dogs stand off and the happy ending reminds me of the ending in Pulp Fiction.<br />Bottom line is if you liked Pulp Fiction, Resevior dogs and if you are a fan of Quentin Tarantino's movies, than this DVD is the one for you. You'll watch it over and over!!!
B00005RFAI|5.0|I love most of the songs on this album but some of them could have been left out.<br />\\"Missundaztood\\"- Catchy, short, little ditty. Pink's so missundaztood.<br />\\"Don't Let Me Get Me\\"- Everybody probably knows this song, has sung along to it. She's tired of being compared, to damn Britney Spears.<br />\\"Just Like A Pill\\"- One of my favorites. Pink feels ill.<br />\\"Get the Party Started\\"- this song is so annoying, and it was played out ( but that's not really her fault).<br />\\"Respect\\"- This song just doesn't roll with me. It's a silly song, coated with techno sounds and posing poorly as a pro-femminism anthem.<br />\\"18 Wheeler\\"- It's just one line that ruins the whole song, \\" you can hang me lika a slave, I'll go underground...\\"<br />\\"Family Portrait\\"- You can almost see Pink's tear-stained face as she belts out this tragedy. Hey, who doesn't want the perfect family?<br />\\"Misery\\"- Another favorite. This has an old, jazzy, doo-wop feeling to it as Pink yet again, explains the pain she's left to wallow in. Steven tyler's not too bad either.<br />\\"Dear Diary\\"- Pink feels sad- she tells all in her dear diary.<br />\\"Eventually\\"- She's got so much pain and animosity towards those who've treated her wrong. Sh'e determined to make them feel the same. What goes arond comes around.<br />\\"Lonely Girl\\"- Actually this song is pretty upbeat. Pink wonders if she's lived up to her own expectations, with the help of Linda Perry.<br />\\"Numb\\"- Her man made her feel like she was nothing and she's just doesn't feel anything for him anymore.<br />\\"Gone To California\\"- She want to journey to the world outside of Philly. She's tired of all the crime and the pain. She thinks of California (real or imagined) as a Mecca of peace and sunshine.<br />\\"My Vietnam\\"- Pink's journey to find herself despite discouragement from her mom, teachers, everyone. Upbeat and catchy. The guitar solo at the end is a nice touch too.
B000021YQV|5.0|When I first heard the singles Aerials and Toxicity I knew I had to check this album out. I read some of the reviews on amazon and were more or less accurate to how I feel about this album. The vibrant 'Prison song' starts the show and sets you up for some serious rocking and it just flows from one song to another so easily. Technically they are brilliant Serj Tankian's voice is so unique and hauntingly changes from madness to mellow  in seconds. There are, in my opinion 10 great songs on this album but one to look out for (after the favourites Chop suey,deer dance,Toxicity and Aerials) is 'Forest' the drumming and guitars are mind blowing. Buy this album!
B000050XEI|5.0|I first got a taste of this cd when my English teacher played it during our silent reading/studying time. I've falling in love with it ever since then. Enya's songs just make you want to run through the dew of an Irish meadow. I reccomend this for anyone who wants a good wind-down-and-relax-at-the-end-of-the-day soundtrack.

6301902645|5.0|This weak flimsy script has well-known American, French, and German actors and actresses stumbling through some of the worst dialogue ever, but it also has the sights and sounds of the 1971 24 Hours of Le Mans (you even get a glimpse of the camera car with camera in one scene).  This priceless montage of the deep rumble of Ford 8-liter V8's, the bark of the Ferrari and Porsche 5-liter 12-cylinder engines, or the raspy howl of the Ferrari, Matra, and Alfa Romeo 3-liter prototype engines is a must-have.  <br />Some footage was staged, but most was filmed during the actual race in 1971, when a sunny afternoon gave way to horrible rain, as if conspiring with the director to try to make something for a plot.<br />If you've ever been to the race (full disclosure, I went in '92 and '93), it almost makes you misty-eyed.  The carnivals, the people sleeping absolutely anywhere, and the dedication to watch cars race until it hurts even to watch are all captured in this, and for less than 20 bucks and two hours, you can be transported back any time you want.<br />Buy this movie, and send the wife and kids to Gramma's house.
B00005JKBC|4.0|Spy Game is a clever action flick with a cool soundtrack and a few fun ideas that resists becoming too gimmicky for their own good.<br />Beginning in the early 90's, Robert Redford plays operative Nathan Muir in his last day on the job when he is brought in for questioning about agent Tom Bishop (Brad Pitt) he enlisted and trained but is now held prisoner in China for espionage. The film then goes back and forth between the drama of the present as CIA officials decide Pitt's fate, and the action of the past as Redford incorporates Pitt into the CIA.<br />The film manages to avoid falling back on over-used and often annoying devices of most flashback movies, and creates a fresh approach using fun, zooming camera shots with an upbeat music track. There's nothing deep here, just fun action done well in a time when many action films are becoming stale retreads of one another.<br />Much of this is thanks to action-director-extraordinare Tony Scott, who made one of my favorite films, True Romance, as well as Top Gun. He knows how to make a fun, entertaining action flick without relying too much on over-used ideas. The acting is all around decent too. The main characters have three dimensions, a plus in action flicks.<br />This is just a fun action flick definitely worth a few viewings. Not a bad way to spend an evening.
B00003CXXO|2.0|This is a dark,sad story set in the future and is about a little boy robot who wants to be a real boy(like Pinnochio).It is starnge and gets stranger and stranger toward the end,science fiction turning into confusing fantasy.The scriptwriters were getting drunker and drunker the longer they wrote..I'm sure that is the explanation.I have to note the incredibly cuuuuuuuuute walking,talking,thinking teddybear that had me gooing and gaaing all the way through!
B0000640SA|5.0|Great movies don't necessarily make great videos/DVD's.  There are some movies that you choose to own just to have and some movies you choose to own because the \\"extras\\" add to a movie that you might have previously appreciated, but wouldn't necessarily have considered owning.<br />><br />Then there's \\"Memento\\".<br />><br />If this movie came with nothing more than just the DVD and a brown paper bag wrapper a'la Led Zeppelin's old \\"In Through The Out Door\\" LP this movie would still more than earn back its price because it's so easy to watch again and again and again, picking up details that you've previously missed.  If you've only heard how good the movie is and haven't seen it, buying the \\"Limited Edition\\" is worthwhile.  If you own the orignal single disc version of the movie, buying the \\"Limited Edition\\" is likewise worthwhile.  At the very least you can kill hours of any rainy day surfing through the menu features.<br />><br />The packaging may be a bit daft, but it is at least original, which is befitting one of THE most original movies made from any corner of the industry in years.  Buy it, and give yourself a weekend to watch it...I promise it will be THE topic of conversation for you when you make it back to work Monday morning.

B000002ADT|5.0|To hear this 1959-recorded album today, in remastered sound, is a true joy. Miles Davis has recorded tons of albums, but this remains the most famous of them all, for good reason.<br />\\"Kind of Blue\\" is the pinnacle of \\"improvisation in jazz\\", as the really great liner notes put it. Starting with the first track \\"So What\\", the album puts on display the genius of Miles Davis, over and over again. Despite the free-flowing arrangements (or maybe because of them), the album does create a \\"blue mood\\", to great effect. Very interesting also is the addition of the bonus track, an alternative take of \\"Flamenco Sketches\\".<br />Even for those that are not die-hard jazz fanaticacs (such as myself), you will thank yourself for buying this album. An essential in anyone's CD collection.
0790735431|5.0|In 1943, the United States was involved in a daylight strategic bombing campaign against Germany.  The B-17 was the primary plane used for these missions, and the \\"Memphis Belle\\" was one of them.    This movie takes a look at the bombing campaign against the Germans as well as a rough account of the flight of the \\"Memphis Belle\\".  The movie stars Matthew Modine as Dennis, the captain, who doesn't seem to have totally earned the respect of his crew.  Tate Donovan stars as Luke, the co-pilot, who is jealous of Dennis and longs for his own plane.  Billy Zane stars as Val, the bombardier, who claims to be a doctor but in reality has had only 2 weeks of medical school.  D.B. Sweeney stars as Phil, the navigator, who is convinced he is going to die and tries to give away all of his possessions to the crew.  Harry Connick, Jr. is the tail gunner who is persuaded to sing at the group's anniversary party.  Sean Astin plays Rascal, the ball turret gunner, who is afraid of the turret jamming at a bad time.  Eric Stoltz plays Danny, the radio operator, who loves poetry and photography.  Courtney Gains  plays Gene, the waist gunner, who is very superstitious. John Lithgow plays an Army PR officer whose only concern is taking pictures of the crew and preparing a party for them after their final mission.  He has very little concern for anything or anyone else.<br />The battle scenes are first-rate.  The flak and the jarring of the aircraft are very realistic as well as the German fighter attacks. I thought the use of models in the film was very well-done, too.  They looked very realistic, and I couldn't distinguish them from the real planes.<br />I've watched this movie several times, and it gets better with each viewing.  I highly recommend this movie to World War II fans.  It is a highly entertaining and action-packed movie.  I'm sure you'll enjoy it.
B00006JL1Z|4.0|(Music: 5 Stars; Compilation: 4 Stars)<br />After 1988's &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; (too short at 1 CD) and 1992's &quot;The Chain: Highlights&quot; (2 CD's but mixing in too many pre-1975 tracks), we are finally getting the ultimate compliation of &quot;classic&quot; Fleetwood Mac (sorry, Peter Green!). All the hits and key tracks are here, including the obvious (Dreams, Go Your Own Way, Don't Stop, The Chain, Hold Me, Everywhere, Silver Springs, Tusk, Gold Dust Woman, Gypsy, etc. etc.) but also key album tracks like Never Going Back Again, Monday Morning, Love in Store, etc. All? well almost: missing are Oh Diane! and Not That Funny. Not funny indeed.<br />Two other quibles: why are we served with several live (from 1997, no less) versions that really don't add anything, including Big Love, a key studio song? Also, I find the sequencing less than desirable. I know it sounds cliched, but more often than not, a &quot;boring&quot; straight choronogical overview simply works best, and I think this would have been the case here as well. But in the end, the music is here in one place for us to enjoy, at last.
B000069AUI|4.0|This album is still growing on me but I would have to say that Parachutes is definitely better.  I wish they would have had more great chill tunes on here like on Parachutes.  But I guess that's why they titled it A Rush of Blood to the Head.  I still think it is really good compared to most of the pop alternative [stuff] out there, but it seems actually less mature of an effort in comparison to Parachutes.

B00006J3WH|5.0|This really is an indispensible album for Buffy fans. I would have bought it anyway, but it actually contains some excellent performances.<br />Sarah certainly holds her own on her numbers, especially Going Through The Motions, and the superb Tony Head and James Marsters deliver very creditable performances - see also Tony's Music For Elevators. However, one major disappointment is that the divine Al Hannigan barely gets in a line. <br />Yet the real revelation is Amber, whose exquisite Under Your Spell is as good a vocal performance as you will ever hear from a female singer. As another reviewer said, we can only hope that she puts out a solo album.<br />While this episode was the shining jewel of Season Six, and a tribute to Joss Whedon's genius, it was one of the few lighter moments in what was a very dark season. If Season Seven goes ahead as planned, we can only hope that it will be a little more uplifting. During Season Six's darkest moments, it seemed that the Buffy series may be on its way out. After the loss of Xena, ST:Voyager, Farscape and Roswell in such a short space of time, the idea of losing Buffy as well would be a bitter blow.<br />Here's hoping for another Musical Buffy in the future.
B00006HBUA|2.0|Scooby Doo, Where Are You? was a staple of my Saturday mornings as a youth. It was entertaining and, to me, at that age, a bit creepy. The cartoon series today is still charming and even a bit more disturbing now that I know what some of the \\"in-jokes\\" are today. The live action film adaptation is almost an exact replication of the cartoon series. That is both a compliment and an insult to those involved. Let me explain....<br />First of all, the kids will love this film. It is going to entertain them for hours on end and I'm sure they'll watch it over and over. That's who it's for isn't it? For them, it's going to be a four or five star affair. As parents, you can feel secure that the humor is clean enough (with enough innocuous potty humor thrown in to appease even the most jaded of 8 year olds), even if a couple of the scares are a bit intense.<br />For those raised on the cartoon and expecting something more powerful, you probably won't feel the same way. My review is from the standpoint of an adult trying to recapture my youthful enjoyment of that old series. Don't do it! Here's the details:<br />Matthew Lillard and Linda Cardinelli are almost creepy in their dead-on portrayals of their cartoon selves. Lillard, in particular, seems to be channelling Casey Kasem's voice work AND the cartoons bizarre movements for that character. Freddie Prinze, Jr. as Fred and Sarah Michelle Gellar as Danger-prone Daphne breathe a bit of new life into their cartoon selves. We discover that Fred is vain to the point of preening and Daphne is not just gorgeous, but a bit of an idiot. Scooby Doo is a computer generated character that will eventually have you believing that he must have really existed in his interactions with the actors. This is a tremendous compliment to the actors who had to do a great deal of blue or green screen work interacting with empty space.<br />Lillard as Shaggy (and Scooby Doo, but he's really not there) is the real \\"star\\" of the show and needs to receive kudos for not only his dynamite portrayal, but his fantastically believable interactions with the non-existent Scooby Doo.<br />What I didn't like about the film is that it is too much like the episodes and not enough like them all at the same time. The DVD extras lets us know that the filmmakers made a big mistake in not seguing the cartoon version opening credits into the live action film. It would have been great for those of us wanting a dip in the nostalgia pool (after all we have to take the kids, don't we?).<br />Also, the villain in this piece is actually a bit on the horrific side, if you're taking the wee ones to see the film. That's surprising since the filmmakers make comments that they wanted to be sure to target the kids.<br />Finally, if the filmmakers are merely going to remake an episode of the cartoon, what's the point? Why not just make a full length cartoon version of the quality of the original series?<br />Ultimately, it is an enjoyable distraction to view this film. The actors are having fun and they make you want to have fun. The filmmaker wisely decided to maintain the bright day glo colors of the costumes for the cast.  Too bad the whole film isn't as bright as those colors.

B00000IQMT|5.0|Well, I was advised after buying this one, that there was already a complete album with all the music from the film, but come on! They made us buy this selection before and I wouldn't buy the other after buying this one since I don't consider mine not so bad at all.<br />John Williams returns after all those years without Star Wars, and returns very well. Spite the major disppointement towards the mov, the score brings us back to the old memories, with a true gem-- \\"Duel of Fates\\" the most powerful music for a combat scene.<BR>Other nice tracks- <BR>A full rendition of a moving \\"Anakin's Theme\\" which some parts appear later. <BR>Spite no one like Jar Jar, he has joyful and playful cue that appear in #4 and #7. This one also includes a magnificent march for the Pod race.<BR>Good action tracks-#5,#12,#14(excellent cue for the droids) and #15(with the NOOO!)<BR>The soundtrack has a lot of calm/mysterious tracks in the middle, thing that many tend to despise. Well I think they're very nice, and sometimes they have a spooky effect (10 and that beginning of #13)<BR>Someone has already said an important thing, is that the score doesn't end with big notes at the end credits track, instead it drags to calm and peaceful notes. I found it quite original.<br />Overall, this soundtrack is a must, but if you haven't yet any from PHANTOM, buy instead the complete soundtrack. I have already heard it and it worths to pay a few more dollars.

He writes that he is enjoying his days in Rome, Italy, where Clarice searches for him. There was a little bit two much gore in this movie(Lecter killing the Inspecter, Lecter removing the top of Ray Liotta's head) but this movie was ok. Red Dragon did really good though.
B000065U1N|3.0|Great movie, but there'll be a special edition DVD with more features early 2003.  Save your money for that DVD instead of this one.
6305971099|2.0|This was a bad movie for the Halloween Series. This was not as bad as Halloween III. One year after Michael was shot by Sheriff Ben Meeker(Beau Starr) and the country boys, Jamie Lloyd(Danielle Harris) is put in the Haddonfield Children's Clinic and is mute due to the events of Halloween 4. Michael rises from a coma and puts his mask on again. He goes back to the Carruthers house and kills off Rachel(Ellie Cornell). He pursues Jamie and Rachel's best friend Tina(Wendy Kaplan) through town, while Dr. Loomis(Donald Pleasance) trys to lure him to the Myers house to finish him off once and for all. First of all, Michael Myers kills Rachel right of the bat. The psychic connection between Michael and Jamie was very dumb and Jamie got a little bit annoying after a while. Michael's mask is different. Dr. Loomis works in Haddonfield and works in the children's hospital that Jamie lives in. Skip Halloween III if you want to be really want to be scared! Watch this movie if you really love the series! I'd problably give this two and a half stars if I could!
B000069CWE|3.0|I really have to say, I was more than surprised by this disc. Having had Linkin Park force-fed to me for two years or so, I was getting sick of them, to say the least. I saw no difference between this band and any other \\"woe-is-me\\" whiny... new metal, and as such, I never EVER made an effort to listen to Linkin Park before. But! This remix CD is nice. It sounds crisp, clear, and thumpin' on a high-end stereo, and all the songs have a good beat. I don't consider it a musical revolution. I don't regard it as \\"pleasingly dark\\" or anything like that. It's nothing more to me than talented technicians who know how to take overall OK music and turn it into something fun to listen to. As an added bonus, this is a \\"let-it-play\\" CD - put it in and leave it alone. The remixes are innovative, and provide a fresh alternative to overplayed Linkin Park music. I think Linkin Park sounds just fine this way, regardless of hip-hop or rap delineations - those divisions are rapidly disappearing anyway. All in all, this CD is a keeper. I give it three out of five stars, a Damn Good rating in my book. I have a new respect for Linkin Park, but don't get me wrong - all the original material is still monumentally overplayed. Let's hope they can get something fresh out soon.
B00006J3WH|5.0|I love this cd, just as I loved the musical episode.  I'm not sure this cd would be a hit with a non-Buffy fan, but anyone that loves the show would love this disc.
B000068TPN|5.0|This is a great rendition of the beginning of the Vietnam War.  Mel Gibson does an excellent job as the the leader of the troops that fight in the battle at the start of the Vietnam War.  There are some gory parts...it has scenes where Napalm is used and you kind of get the idea of how bad that stuff really was/is.  The movie is based on a true story and I think that it gives a good idea of how some of the fighting in Vietnam took place.  I gained appreciation of how terrible the war was and how the lack of support from the U.S. people would put soldiers lives at risk.  It also depicts the women who are left at home to worry about their soldier husbands...and is very heartbreaking at times.  I recommend it for viewers who like this type of movie.  I am not a big war buff, so as far as realism, I am not sure where this movie would rank.
B000004286|5.0|Like the movie, this soundtrack is powerfully recorded to enhance the listener's visual experience.

B00003CX8Y|5.0|At first I was not that impressed with this film- after all I had seen all the classic Disney features and while this one was good it still was not &quot; Pinochio&quot; or &quot;Bambi&quot; but then the &quot;Be Our Guest&quot; sequence started and I realized this is animated masterpiece worthy of the best of Disney- watching it again on this must own DVD I had the same experience- dishes doing Busby Burkley extravaganze is what makes animation an art- the movie it self is beautifull, funny and moving- with that gorgeous score.  The DVD extras are top rate specially the work in progress print is a must for animation fans
0380789035|3.0|Like the other reviewer who has read since he was 5, I've been reading a long time.  I bought this book at the airport, having forgotten to bring a book.<br />I'll keep this short.  If you enjoy fantasy and mythology, read this book.  If you want to be scared or kept on the edge of your seat, find something else.  I didn't find this book to be at all suspenseful, it was quite predictable.  I got the whole &quot;plot twist&quot; quite soon.<br />It wasn't the worst book I'd ever picked up but it wasn't the best either.  I have read books that I didn't want to put down, Boris Starling's &quot;Messiah&quot; and Caleb Carrs &quot;The Alienist&quot; come to mind, however, this wasn't one of those.<br />Don't believe the hype, this book isn't going to renew your hopes for non-fiction.

B00006JL1Z|3.0|OK..first off, I'm a huge Fleetwood Mac fan. Have all the albums from 1975-1997, with the exception of &quot;Time&quot;, and some albums prior to the addition of Buckingham/Nicks, ie. &quot;Mystery To Me&quot;, and &quot;Bare Trees&quot;. Also have many bootlegs of live shows, demos, etc..Like I said, I'm a Mac nut. Disc #1 is classic. All the gems are here..Go your own way, Dreams, Rhiannon, the original Landslide, and the original Silver Springs! It's about time too. Also contains some amazing songs that were never released as singles like Second Hand News, Songbird, and What Makes You Think You're The One from &quot;Tusk&quot;. All wonderful choices. Then there's Disc #2 which starts off great with Don't Stop and the Chain, and also includes Think About Me..Classic! But it seems that whoever was compiling these songs got a little lazy by track #7. Ok, what are Family Man, No Questions Asked, Paper Doll, and World Turning doing here??? Anyone who has the 1988 greatest hits album has heard No Questions Asked, so I ask, who needs it here?? It's not that good. At Least As long as you follow was a moderate hit, and a good tune. Then there's Family Man, possibly the worst FM song..EVER. Parer Doll..not good. World Turning..boring. It seems like these were added to beef up the collection, but all they do is take away from the truly great songs. I am glad, however, that a live version of I'm So Afraid is here, and not the original version from the white FM album..IMO though,they should have put the live version from the 1980 live album which is amazing. If you have all the FM albums, you don't really need this unless you are a collector. If you're looking for an introduction to FM, this is a good start, but I would still go with the single disc Greatest Hits album, which btw is how I got hooked, or I would buy Rumours and Tusk together.
B000006IUQ|4.0|Absolutely brilliant film.  I don't know how well this movie did in the cinemas, but it is one that I have probably watched on video a dozen times.  David Mamet's story is fantastic, the actors' work is right on, and the setting of the film is sheer perfection.  This is a story of a man who has everything, goes LITERALLY into the wilderness having to fend for himself, and ends up rediscovering the essence of life through the betrayals of the people he previously trusted.  The ONLY reason why this DVD gets 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the horrible format it has been released on.  This was one of the first DVD's released, so it has virtually no special features, and it is also not enhanced for widescreen television.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|I don't get it.  How could something so simple be so complex?  This movie is one big juxtaposition and I love it.  So far I've put the DVD in the machine and sat through it a total of 14 times.  <br />Leonard certainly gets to you.  And after each viewing I'm still not sure if I'm with him or against him.  I guess that's a cretit to Guy Pearce's talent as an actor.<br />More movies like this should get made.  It's a shame that nobody's making them.

B00005EBPC|5.0|In stripping Dark Tranquillity's _The Gallery_ of all its historical importance and evaluating the music on its own, I think it will probably be the most enduring classic of the New Wave of Swedish Death Metal's early days.<br />The songs are spectacularly ambitious in breadth, epic in composition but not length. The opener, \\"Punish My Heaven\\", slides between its momentous guitar lines in movements rather than traditional arrangements, like a audio story. Acoustic guitars and pianos add to the mood where appropriate. Throughout, somber, gothic poetry and storytelling accompany the epic guitar storms. One of the most important musical elements separating _The Gallery_ from its contemporaries is the remarkable full-band dynamic. Rather than being dominated by guitars, the rhythm section (bassist Martin Henriksson and drummer Anders Jivarp) hold their own with very prominent roles. The bass playing is so independent of the guitars but also brilliantly harmonic, with impeccable note choice and timing. In some songs, it is the bass lines that are the highlights. Jivarp's blend of speed and accenting touch set him apart from his peers. Mikael Stanne's urgent rasp replaces the ungraceful Anders Friden (who sang on _Skydancer_ before hopping aboard In Flames), and his voice's desperation fits the band's music far better, in my opinion. (That said, I think Stanne's voice is infinitely better on _Haven_ and _Damage Done_.)<br />The band further demonstrates their excellence with less conventional stylings. Scandinavian folk music peppers the melodic flavor of the metal riffing. Listen to the crepuscular guitar chords opening and closing \\"Lethe\\" - just about the best chord progression ever in a metal tune. The instrumental prelude to \\"...Of Melancholy Burning\\" is a brilliant Latin-flavored instrumental with symphonic drumming building behind the amazing (amazing!) interplay of two acoustic guitars. \\"The Gallery\\" beings with gorgeous acoustic/electric counterpoint before the initial melody comes together. Classical guitar is sprinkled throughout, splitting the lush dual guitar motif. Then the female vocals of Eva-Marie Larsson come in, and though they are a bit awkward with English, the melody is hauntingly memorable.<br />_The Gallery_ is a must-have for any Gothenburg completist or anyone looking for Swedish melodic metal with a theatrical, progressive inclination. So says me.itial melody comes together. Classical guitar is sprinkled throughout, splitting the lush dual guitar motif.

B00004XOWM|4.0|It seems most people today use Limp Bizkit as a scapegoat for bands that don't write their own lyrics or watch their mouths; but ya know what: some music isn't meant to be studied. Limp Bizkit is loud, insane, vulgar and definitely in-your-face, which is a trait bands since Limp's \\"Faith\\" success attempt at replicating-hence the hundreds of talentless nu-metal bands, ruining the name of Limp Bizkit.<br />Though the album itself is straying from the formula of what some say was the best Limp album--3 dolla bill y'all, but it holds its own with the majority of the sound comprised of rapping on Durst's part. This album is in-your-face and very Gen-X [if that is a possible generalization] and has tons of vulgarity and sexist themes. This album is not to be listened to with your children or relatives; this album is not for you if you are a happy-go-lucky individual or religious zealot. <br />This album is for people who like to rock out to loud music in their suped up rice rockets and eat cheetos all day--long live America's sad-faced youth!
B00005OAIE|5.0|John Mayer's latest release &quot;Room for Squares&quot; is one of the best CDs I own!  From the upbeat, empowering feeling you get from track 1 to the desire for human touch and being a part of someone else in track 4 straight through to the heart felt emotion by 12 and 14... you are pulled in immediately... and don't want to leave.  <BR>His lyrics are unbelievable - and I find myself nodding my head, feeling as though he knows exactly how I feel... wishing that the morning could last until the afternoon... keeping the car in drive...<BR>As big of a fan of Dave Matthews as I have been for many years, John Mayer carved out his own little niche in my music heart.  Is it wrong to eagerly anticipate another release soon?!
0792846443|4.0|This was the first of Stephen King's novels that I ever read, and I thought it was EXCELLENT, but I didn't become his number one fan! This was one of the few films which proved that a film adaptation of a novel can be good.<BR>    Kathy Bates was superb as Annie Wilkes, she was able to be the devoted, adoring fan one minute. And the sadistic obsessed fan the next minute.<BR>    This was meant to be a cautionary tale of the perils of fame and fortune, but it is also a tale of cat and mouse mind games. Fabulous film.
B000066F6H|4.0|I will admit that this cd is hyped up, and most certainly is not the greatest thing to hit rock, but it's still a good cd. ...  Well, it's punk rock, that's all.  If you like loud punk, you'll like this.  If not, you won't.  Plain and simple.
B00000099Y|5.0|This album towers above jsut about anything that has come out in recent years.  Tool have come to a level musically that few bands ever achieve.  The emotional power and flow on this album is absolutely amazing.  It is 74 minutes of energy.<br />I cannot call it progressive rock, or hard rock, it is what it is, great music.  From Stinkfist until the climax of the 15 minute epic Third eye, this album grabs you and never lets go.  It can be listened to in any mood, because it is a masterpiece.<br />Track listing:<BR>1. Stinkfist - A great way to begin, with an awesome beat and hard energy, this song pulls you directly into the album.<BR>2. Eulogy - This song has complex lyrics, which could mean many things.  It is another hard rocking track and at 6-7 minutes, its a great listen.  It keeps the energy going.<BR>3. H. - The trakc that means the most to me.  It is a real emotion filled song with gut-wrenching lyrics and great instrumentation to illustrate.<BR>4. Useful Idiot - Segue into the next track, works well though, its  arecord needle skipping...backwards.<BR>5. 46 & 2 - Musically an insane song, the rhythms Danny Carey doe sin this song are nuts.  On first listen, might become the favorite track of many listeners.  High energy.<BR>6. Message to Harry Manback - Segue into the next song, a weird, but hilarious phone message, however, it still fits into this record as a whole.<BR>7. Hooker with a Penis - The most like Undertow, raw energy, and harsh lyrics about the music industry.  It rocks, although seems to not fit at on first listen.<BR>8. Intermission - Organ segue into the next track, It's actually the melody of Jimm,y the next song.<BR>9. Jimmy - Another emotional song about finding home (in my opinion),  Great song, which they hardly ever play live.  It has one of the most emotional screams by lead Singer Maynard.<BR>10. Die Eier Von Satan - Funny.  You will have to listen, its another Segue.<BR>11. Pushit - 9 minutes of a wonderful love song.  Great lyricsand this song grabs you by the throat as well.<BR>12. Cessaro Summability - Very freaky track of a screaming child.  another segue.<BR>13. Aenema - This song is amazing.  Excellent drumming and apocalyptic lyrics which really grab the listener, and almost chastise him or her.<BR>14. Ions - A segue track into third eye, 4 minutes long.<BR>15. Third Eye - 15 minute long finale to this wonderful album,  A song about conciousness.  the final Climax when Maynard is repeating \\"prying open my third eye\\" is....wow.<br />I stress that all the songs are great, but this album is best when viewed as one piece.  Take it all in, with numerous listens and look at the lyrics.  An amazing album which ranks as my favorite CD ever.
6305508550|5.0|Every Software Engineer (SE) should watch this. You will swear you are seeing your life on film. It is good enough to warrant 4 stars for the general public, but 5 stars for SEs. I put off seeing it for a long time because I had seen so many other office movies that were awful. This one was pretty good. The ending gets cut off rather abruptly and the outcome was not exactly what I would want -- which is why this movie is so true to life. The acting, the sets, everything is &quot;normal&quot;, but still done at a high production-quality level.

B0000028M7|5.0|AIC never released a bad album, and this is one is one of their best.  In many fans eyes, it is their best, and had they never released Jar of Flies and Sap, I would agree.  Since they released those two other masterpieces, it's impossible for me to pick a favorite AIC album, this is one of them though.  A very dark album that deals mainly with addiction, a problem Layne would struggle with until earlier this year.  Death is the only way such a unique talent as Layne could be silenced.  Layne's voice is amazing on every track, and his lyrics both dark and haunting.  Hemmingway said \\"Write abotu what you know about\\" and Staley gave an inside view into the world of a herion addict.  Jerry Cantrell works his magic on such tracks as the vietnam war epic \\"Rooster\\" and the rocking closer \\"Would?\\"  This album is one of AIC's masterpieces, and pick it up today if you haven't already bought it.
B000056K04|5.0|Everywhere I go I see DMB fans putting this album down in every way they can. They let it play for all of about 20 seconds before passing it off as complete crap. Dave Matthews Band has washed up. Glen Ballard is Satan. We've lost Dave Matthews to the pop music world. <BR>Well, I've been a DMB fan since their first album, and let me confess, when I had only listened to 20 seconds of Everyday I thought the same thing. And so, as I listened to the rest of the CD, I was in that mindset, and hardly gave it a second thought. And I stayed that way for quite some time I'm ashamed to say, hardly listening to Everyday at all, all depressed because I thought I'd lost my precious DMB forever. Then, at the release of their fifth CD, I realized they were still them, and a more happy me went back and listened to Everyday. And it was amazing. Absolutely amazing. If you look past the obvious, that yes, it is different, you realize that it is nowhere close to being teen pop. The lyrics are beautiful and touch on some very deep issues, and the music, although a little more restricted, still has that \\"naked honesty\\" that DMB is famous for. I think that people hear that electric guitar and see that all the songs cut off at 3 or 4 minutes, and they just throw it out without even giving it a chance. That's what I did. And I'll never forgive myself for it. <BR>It's time to grow up, people, and accept that bands change, that they can't do the same thing, work with the same producer forever and remain satisfied. Not only would they get tired of what they were doing, but I can promise you, you would too. Change, as hard as it may be to accept, can be a very good thing. And in this case, it opened the door new producers, and to the monumental masterpiece that is Busted Stuff. Glen Ballard, you are God.
B000002B2X|5.0|As a die hard AIC fan, I really love this CD.  This is similar to Jar Of Flies, and it shows AIC stretching their boundaries, and all the musicians are in top form, along with a high profile guest on one of the tracks (Chris Cornell).  Buy this CD now, you definitely won't regret it.  If you're new to AIC, this is a great place to start.
B000066NW0|4.0|So it's Avril Lavigne, a young pop singer who wants to walk a little closer to the edge than the average young pop singer.  <BR>What's good: <BR>-A solid pop record filled with catchy hooks<BR>-A fun attitude from Avril<BR>-Some rock guitar parts, particularly in &quot;Losing Grip&quot; and &quot;Unwanted.&quot;<BR>-Josh Freese, one of this reviewer's favorite studio drummers, recorded many of the songs on this album.<BR>-Her voice is nicely done on the album.<br />What's not so good:<BR>-Avril's lyrics.  They leave a lot to be desired.<BR>-More on lyrics; they are one-dimensional in that almost every song on the album is about the same thing.<BR>-Her voice is not so great live.  There are clues to this here and there on the album, but as a whole I'd rather listen to the CD than go to her concert.<BR>-A couple of the songs are blatant attempts to capitalize on a growing trend in music: The songs &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot; and &quot;Nobody's Fool.&quot;  The latter especially sticks out like a sore thumb in an album of otherwise solid pop tunes; it's the worst song here and really should have been left off entire.<BR>-This material may not have lasting value.<br />For the average pop fan, Avril may be seen as a groundbreaking new artist.  For those of us who are into &quot;other&quot; types of music, we may hear stark reflections - warped into pop territory - of grittier and edgier music.  But I don't see a problem here.  As a modern pop offering, Avril's &quot;Let Go&quot; can stand on its own and is definitely worth a purchase.
B000002B2T|5.0|members from two of my favorite bands, Pearl Jam and Alice in Chains combine on the only Mad Season album ever.  Most prominent is the late layne Staley.  Staley is one of the best rock vocalists of all time.  Right up there not only with his contemporaries Chris Cornell and Eddie Vedder, but with classic rock's greatest frontmen; Robert Plant, Mick Jagger,Roger Daltry, the list goes on.  Staley's unique delivery works well not only on hard rocking albums like Facelift and Dirt, but also on quieter albums such as Jar Of Flies, Sap, and AIC Unplugged.  The softer side is displayed throughout this album.  <BR>This is one of the most successful side projects ever assembled, right alongside the brilliant Temple Of The Dog.  After you get this album, get the VHS (not on dvd yet) performance of Mad Season Live, it shows Layne's unique gift as a live performer.  We miss ya Layne.
B000066NW0|4.0|This is a pretty good CD. Some of the songs are good (they're mostly just radio hits), and the rest is filler. But the songs have good lyrics, and she does play a mean guitar. Overall, Avril does a good job for a debut album, and she is one of my favorite female artists.

0385505833|3.0|I liked it better than \\"A Painted House\\". The characters seemed real, the story amusing, the idea of going on a cruise and skipping Christmas intriguing. I had a real problem, however, with the main character's concern over his daughter's boyfriend's skin color. It was brought up twice and ruined the book for me. Remember how relieved the parents were when they saw that the boyfriend was almost as light-skinned as they were? Did any of you readers out there notice this??
B000002IAS|5.0|This is one of those albums that puts other all-time favorites in perspective. It was a pivotal time for Clapton, who, coming from his brief Blind Faith experiment, was overwhelmed by superstar expectations. This tour allowed him to regroup as &quot;one of the band&quot; and, as another reviewer noted, continue with Carl Radle, Jim Gordon, and Bobby Whitlock as Derek &amp; the Dominoes, where he was once again the lone soloist. Dave Mason, even though on the album he is introduced as a member of Traffic, was more or less split from them and in the process of playing with everybody who asked. Also, Carl Radle appears on some of Dave's solo stuff. Overall, this is a rippin' band that is obviously having fun. &quot;Comin' Home&quot; is my personal favorite, but I find myself listening to this one over and over and over. . .

6304366078|5.0|As a young teenager, I stoped in to see this movie quite by coincidence while visiting my Grandmother in Daytona Beach.  In those days the movie theatre played a movie over and over during the day.  I was entranced and watched the film twice in a row. Some of the effects were unheard of in those days and the perspective of speed and gritty engine sound were intoxicating.<br />Upon review, many films from my youth fail the test of time.  Not this one! It is still a valid and pertinent statement about the cost of participation in motorsports at this level.  The excitement is the same.  Some commentarists have suggested that some of the characters and plot development is shallow, but how true!  In this film you find both deep and shallow characters, just as in life.  It is a film about the human drama that doesn't go overboard and doesn't forget that without the machines and the racing there is also no point.<br />An interesting and final note is that my 15 year old son is just as excited about the movie and is actually the reason that I made the move from rent to buy.<br />Enjoy a true classic (even cult?) film!
0553381709|1.0|Since A Storm of Swords is supposed to be the last installment of the triology, I thought this book would have an ending.  But it just leavings you hanging.  There is no conclusion.  Who eventually won the crown of Westros?  You have all of these would be kings fighthing amoung themselves and you'd expect one to come out on top.  But, no, old George just ends the books right in the middle of the battle.  Aftering reading all three books and getting involved with all of the characters, Mr. Martin just ends this last installment in mid-stride books.  Nothing gets resolved. None of the characters reach their final destiny,and the final battle is never fought.  It's as if Mr. Martin ran out of ideas and just decided to end the book.  If you have read the first two books, stop now and don't go any further because you will be disappointed in the end.  I like the story, the intrigue, the characters, and all that, but there is just no conclusion.  My favorite character Arya, never finds her way home, nor gets reunited with her mother, Catyln.  Sansa, Arys's sister, what is her final fate?  And Catyln, supposedly murdered, is somehow resurrected and begins avenging her so called death then abruptly the book ends. I can only surmise that Mr. Martin got writer's block and just ended the book, or he left himself an opening for another installment.
B00004XMS0|4.0|Well, How can I say this.. I remember back in 1989 when I first saw Batman with Micheal Keaton... it was most probably one of the best Superhero movies ever ....<BR>It was followed by another movie which was almost as good known as Batman Returns, with a cast like Michelle Pfeiffer, Danny Devito and Micheal Keaton what more could we expect but pure perfection... ..:)<BR>The last two, ...Plain and simple they were like kids stories. Another loss was the fact that Tim Burton did not direct them. His dark loomy presence was not felt and they seem to be geared move towards children... the magic was lost..  Final say I recommend this because of the first 2 movies.
B00006HBUB|1.0|Scooby-Doo the cartoon was great and classic - This movie just takes another property and turns it into trash.  Really bad story gets worse and worse. If anyone has ever seen the cartoon you have a million questions - like why does the gang hate each other? They never disbanded in hatred of each other! Were Fred and Daphne interested in each other in the cartoon? Who decided they should date? Shaggy all of the sudden has an interest in women over food and Scooby? <br />They went about this all wrong. the only right thing was the parts of Shaggy and Scooby. They were the most true to the original. The director should have played more on the simplicity of the story lines and look of the cartoon rather than dulling it up with a convoluted plot line that is unplausable and is just plain stupid. The director goes on how he mimicked the cartoon but I did not see it anywhere. ...
0671578855|5.0|Here I am reading a romance novel, and laughing.<br />Miles is in love with young Vor widow from the novel Komarr.  As Miles continues his hyperactive charge at courtship, Ivan Vorpatril get's involved with Barrayaran politics and an old flame (I still laugh at that).  <br />Next there is Miles' clone brother Mark, as he returns from Beta Colony.  He is madly in love with one of the Koudelka girls (Team Koudelka, as Miles would call them), has a damn ingenius scheme to make loads of money, while he is trying to settle things with his girl.  <br />The entire novel is a laugh riot, with some damn funny moments meant to kill the reader from stomach cramps.  <br />None of those moments in any novel I have read compare to the dinner party.  Reading the entire series just so you can read that chapter is worth it alone.<br />If read Vorkosigan, then you need this book now.  <br />If you are tired of those big tough, super perfect heroes in other sci-fi novels (Honor Harrington anyone) read this series and enjoy.
B00006HBUA|5.0|I think that they did a good job with this movie because all of the actors did a good job portraying the characters.  I especially liked Matthew Lillard playing Shaggy because he did such a good job playing him, that he could have been him in real life.  He was very funny and so where the other co-stars.  They did a good job with the animation of scooby-doo.  He was also very funny.  I just couldn't believe that they made scrappy-doo to be the evil one.  I always thought that he was just jealous of scooby's fame.I liked how freddie played fred.  I liked how sarah played daphne.  My favorite will always be Matthew Lillard.  He did a VERY, VERY good job portraying shaggy. I have watched about 10 times and I never get tired of it.  I laugh every time that I see it.  Overall, it was a very good movie.  They couldn't have found any one better to play these characters better than they did.
B00006SFLV|5.0|First off, I often find myself describing My So-Called Life to friends (it was never shown on free-to-air in Australia) and they're surprised that I enjoy it like I do.  Sadly, their general response is, \\"But it sounds like a girl's show!\\" Alas, these are the same people who believe The Simpsons is just a kid's show.<br />Personally, MSCL depicted the teenage experience better than anything I'd seen, and I was drawn to it from the beginning.  Sure, they may have embellished the `teen angst' theme a bit much in some storylines, but that just adds to the appeal of the show.  Also, almost anyone can identify with at least one of the show's characters.<br />One of the best things about this new DVD Set, is that those who may have missed MSCL during its initial run, and subsequent re-airings, will now get the chance to see what all the fuss is about.  So, buy this set, watch it all the way through, and then watch it again.  And like myself, you'll probably find yourself referring it to friends.
B00006FMDA|4.0|I've been waiting for some time for this. Read a review that said, it was the best B&amp;W movie one could own. At the time it was out of print. Well, it was worth the wait. The picture is suberb, the story still fresh and funny and the music, oh the music. The Beatles music is timeless and this DD presentation is the best I've heard, although not up to today's 6.1 surround standards, it is 250% better than the original sound track, I'm sure! In 1964, my wife waited, at 20 below zero in a line-up to see this (I can't remeber that far back, although I saw it then too). If you love the Beatles, get this, you won't be sorry.
0671775308|5.0|Truly an eye opener!  A pseudo-scientific look into millionaire behavior.  While much of the charting &amp; sampling discussion may lose some readers, one should press on to get the point of the read.  The book becomes particularly interesting when one sees millionaire (PAW) behavior in friends &amp; family and heavy consumption (UAC) behavior in those one would presume are wealthy.  Makes one wonder!  How better to learn to attain wealth than to study those who have done so?  I am buying this book for everyone in my family &amp; in my office.
B00005NWM3|1.0|This is the best country I've heard in my life!  I was amazed how great Chad voice for country.  All those catchy high-note guitar solos.  This is what we call rockin'-----country style.  IS THERE A DECENT SOLE IN HIM? IF POP LISTENINERS CALL IT ROCK...THEN WHY DOESNT HE JUST GO AHEAD AND MAKE IT ACTUAL ROCK! Anyways...i really hate country but honestly think if he changed to focusing on country he could do farely well.  This is probably the worst \\"rock\\" band thats recently come out.  Now...if they had made a few good cd's in the past, then that's expected of great rock bands to get soft and culture-oriented.  BUT DEBUT?  This puzzles me very much on how they're famous.  In a summed up summary...Nickleback [] very big D... im sure.  The songs have no catch, they have no originality, Chad gets annoying, should i go on? OK.  the songs are almost identical, and it sounds almost exactly like country(i hope i got it threw to you), and they also ruined Josey Scott with hero(Saliva [] but are much better than nickleback).  Let's get this straight RIGHT HERE!  NICKLEBACK IS NOT ROCK, METAL, OR \\"HARCORE\\".  THEY ARE WHAT WE CALL \\"POP-ROCK\\" OR ANOTHER NAME IS POSERS!i know that if chad is reading this, its gonna hurt his feelings, but he must here it for the future of the band and his country career.
B00003W8NM|5.0|I got so much garbage from people with low IQs just pointing out this movie was 'all about fighting'. It's not.    This movie shows the buildup and allure of commercialization in today's society. It also has a great storyline, cinematography, and a GREAT ending. Some scenes are graphic, but this movie's flow and storyline more than makes up for it.     Buy this one today folks.

0385486804|2.0|I would have to say that this book did not do much for me.  Don't get me wrong - McCandless was a really fascinating guy, and I was interested in his story.  I thought, however, that Krakauer could have done a better job of making it interesting.  I found the story hard to follow because Krakauer didn't tell it from beginning to end, but jumped around from place to place.  I understand that he didn't know all the facts between different locations, but I still think he could have made the book more interesting.  I do have a lot of respect for McCandless for doing what he did, though.
0060254920|5.0|Maurice Sendak is one of those great children's book creators who could write and draw. He helped me dream as a young boy, and I should pay him credit for helping me imagine things today.<br /><br />When I was little, I'd stare at the page long after my mother finished reading it to me. Sendak seemed to have found my creative pulse, as he drew me in to wonder about his world of pretend monsters. The monsters are not quite so terrible, and could be considered friendly.<br /><br />Max and I are both boys, and it must ordinary for we boys to get in a terrific amount of trouble in the process of playing. I related to Max. He sounded like a real boy. I was never quite sure what a rumpus was, but I knew it sounded like a lot of fun.<br /><br />The pictures are cool. There is a rich, full-of-flavor tension in the art. The expressions and poses of the characters come across as genuine.<br /><br />Don't be fooled by the amazing pictures. You'll enjoy the carefully laid story just as much, and your child can close his eyes and imagine his own version.<br /><br />A wonderful book. A classic. If you've got kids, or if you read to your family's or neighbor's kids, this is one book which will be dog-eared from numerous reads.<br /><br />I fully recommend \\"Where the Wild Things Are\\" by Maurice Sendak.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com
0440219078|4.0|The Giver is a book that makes you think.  It demonstrates how revolutionary thoughts come to mind in a society where you are constantly watched and told what to do.  The Giver demonstrates a utopian society in which everyone follows the rules, and no one knows of anything different. The people of this city do not feel pain, or have emotions.  People of the society live without having their own opinion, and can not demonstrate how they feel in any way.  The people live with no purpose but to do their assigned role in the community. <BR> <BR>I feel this books plot and setting are a masterpiece.  If you want to understand how a utopian society should work, it should help you understand how different societies could work; besides the capitalistic society we live in today. The story will helps visualize a perspective of a utopian society, and can bring out flaws in such a society.  It helps to understand political problems within such a government. Overall the story just helps in one to think better, and broaden knowledge of how a society can work.  This book broadened my view on society where everything is perfect, but it also showed me such a society could only work if the citizens feel no pain, or emotions.  To me it demonstrated how a perfect society like Marxism, cannot work in our world, because people do have emotions, and do want to voice their own opinion.  I recommend The Giver to young children, because it is an easy to understand the story.  I also recommend it to adults, because they can take the story's message on step further and give one a new perspective.
B00005JKNF|4.0|...If you are looking for an in-your-face action-packed thriller/murder mystery of the type in which Bruce Willis would likely star, this is NOT it.  This is a British murder mystery in the style of Agatha Christie.  It is calm and subtle. It requires a modicum of an attention span to watch...  What reviewers fail to realize is that they didn't understand the plot precisely because it is not flashed in their faces in neon letters.  The murderer is revealed at the very end through rather unique means and I bet you never would have guessed who done it!  The interesting part for me is the fact that life goes on for most of the characters as if nothing happened.  But that is the message of Gosford Park, I think:  life in inter-war England was like that.  Servants behaved as they should, masters as they should, everyone had his place, the King was in his castle, God was in his heaven, and the sun never set on the British Empire.  It was the end of those times.  I love how this movie portrays the abject boredom of \\"what is done\\".  Excellent story.  The only drawback is the sound-quality -- it's as if the microphones aren't in the right place sometimes.

B00005JKTE|2.0|Cate Blanchett can't be faulted for her portrayal of a British (Scottish, actually) agent of the Special Operations Executive in France.  But the story is thin, predictable, and isn't worth your time.  She falls in love with a RAF pilot who you just know is going to be shot down over France.  Somehow in her grief she makes it through SOE's rigourous psychological testing and gets sent to France with the private ulterior motive to find her lost love.  Unbelievable point number one.<br />When she gets in country, she's dressed like the belle of the ball, complete with a new hair colour and fabulous clothing.  No one in France in WWII was wearing well-fitted, new clothing unless she was the mistress of a high-ranking German officer.  Also, she has too many changes of clothing, certainly more than fit in the case she carries.  And no agent worth her salt would colour her hair and risk it growing out while she was being detained by the Feldgendarmes!  Cate's cover is housekeeper of a man who owns a run-down estate.  She wouldn't have had a tube of lipstick, much less lipstick that always looks perfect.  Unbelievable point number two.<br />I rented this movie because I am a WWII re-enactor who portrays an SOE agent (in Belgium, though, not France) and I am always looking for good movies to recommend to people who know nothing about the SOE.  Well, this ain't it!  Not only does the movie make terrible visual mistakes, it oversimplifies a very complex situation.  Like most American films, it treats WWII as if it was all about Jewish people being put into concentration camps.  MANY non-Jewish people were also sent to concentration camps for various reasons.  And the Nazis had numerous other agendas than exterminating God's chosen people.  Also SOE didn't drop agents into occupied countries to help hide Jewish kids.  They were there to equip and train Resistants, derail trains, blow up bridges, and communicate German positions and troop movements via wireless back to London.  The great success of the French Resistance was that, by derailing and incapacitating trains and roadways, they prevented enough German reinforcements from arriving in Normandy until the victory was already decidedly in the hands of the Allies.  This common oversimplification of the French situation into a fight to keep Jewish people out of danger practically infuriates me.  EVERYONE in occupied France was in constant danger of losing their lives, not just Jews.  It was a hellish situation.  I did find something redeeming in the scenes after the credits.  The director recalls shooting the scene in which the German tanks roll into the village and some of the real villagers started weeping.  Over fifty years later, and these people still cry when they are reminded of the horror they endured during the War.  I am rather certain that these villagers were not solely of Jewish extraction.  To beat the dead horse of the Holocaust demeans the sacrifice and loss suffered by the Gentile population of occupied Europe.  That is a terrible sin.<br />The most offensive character in this movie was Cate's contact who wished he was back in Birmingham.  And the idea that he was given a chance at jailtime or serving in the SOE is ludicrous.  While SOE used ex-cons as trainers in sabotage and subversion, they were well-cleared and not \\"straight from the dock\\".  SOE did not and could not afford to recruit untrustworthy people.<br />The cold, unfeelingness of London's orders may have a grain of truth, however, but England was never known to allow a Resistance cell to be exterminated on purpose (although some argue that this was the situation with the Dutch cells in 1942-43), and they certainly wouldn't set up a bunch of good anti-Germans just because they happened to be communists.  It is true that England was wary of working with Communists, it has been shown time and again that they would ignore their political affiliation as long as their dedication to irradicating the Nazi menace wasstrong.  As was the case in Tito's Yugoslavia, the French Resistance's hatred of Hitler outweighed everything else, although they were always suspicious of English assistance.  Directly after the War, SOE agents were practically deported to prevent England from having any control in French political matters.<br />To the non-thinking reviewers who were angry that Blanchett didn't speak fluent French the entire time, get over yourselves.  Do you really want to have to read the whole movie?<br />If you want to watch a good movie/series about SOE in France, get \\"Wish Me Luck\\".  It's a 6-part series about fictional SOE agents, their training and their operations in occupied France.  It lacks the namby-pamby love story of \\"Charlotte Gray\\" and the characters are intensely more likeable.strong.

B00000IL1K|5.0|I gave this Sarah Brightman CD five stars because I find it to be my favorite.  The opening with track 1 is brilliant and beautiful, simply beautiful.  Also some other amazing tracks are 9, Tu, So Many things, Eden, and track 14.  Of course Deliver Me, Dust in the Wind,  Anytime, Anywhere are excellent.  This album is the most diverse out of all of Sarah's, it includes some opera, pop like, and gothic like songs.  This is a beautiful album that should apeal to everyone, not only opera and classical fans.
0316666343|5.0|I read The Lovely Bones about three months ago and it has stayed with me ever since.  I loaned it to a friend about two months ago and can hardly wait for her to return it so I can reread it.  Beautifully written, The Lovely Bones is the story of a little girl who was murdered and what she sees and learns from heaven afterwards.  It made me hope that my loved ones who have died were experiencing the same things - and I began to see signs from above that they might be.  While it is a disturbing subject, The Lovely Bones is ultimately a comforting and intelligent novel.
B0000027DJ|4.0|This is the album that ended Alice's hair metal days, and it's probably the best of that era. In fact, it slowly veers away from the formula, it's alot harder sounding than Trash and touches down on many more topics than Trash(which was basically Alice's sex concept album). It's on a more serious and darker note though.  There isn't much humor to be found. This one gets a decent amount of time in the cd player, it really does have some great tunes on it.  After you listen to it a few times, it will really sink in.
0385503954|5.0|\\"Oh, what tangled web we weave, when first we practice to deceive\\" must certainly have been in McEwan's mind when he penned this sensitive and beautifully constructed novel. It moves so slowly at first that it seems almost like a 19th century tale. The language of the story is far more sumptuous than the modern reader expects and the intricacies of the personalities of the characters, and the relationships between them, are absorbing.<br />This is a truly unusual offering from a contemporary publisher -- a book to be relished, and thought about, and treasured. And read again.

B000002HJD|5.0|In response to Egghole 9, WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TRIPPING ON? IT'S O.K. TO COME DOWN NOW!<BR>  That said, this is a cool album, if you know what you're getting. Jim Morrison was a poet, straight up. He hated being a \\"Rock Star\\" and a \\"Sex Symbol\\". (That's why he exposed himself on stage!) He did this album on his birthday, by himself and for himself, because this is what he always wanted to do. If you listen to his lyrics in the \\"Doors\\" songs, you'll hear the same kind of themes trying to be heard. If you're expecting a radio - friendly, classic rock album, don't waste your time. However, if you're a true Jim Morrison fan, and want to experience him on the next level, check this out!
B00005JKG7|5.0|I have always loved the movie nothing overly bloody but keeps your attention throughout.  The re-mastering job only makes the movie better....  My two cents
B000003TAB|3.0|If you want B-sides that thrive with brilliance and sickness, pick up something by the Pixies. If you want something that thrives with genius in a few tracks, then loses the plot to meandering noodlings, pick Incesticide.<br />It has its moments, and what moments they are. Dive is monolithic. Stain is sickened and lovely. Sliver shows truth, honesty and humor (&quot;mashed potatoes and stuff like that&quot;). Aneurysm is buried heartache rising to the surface.<br />Then you have stuff about disco queens and Devo covers and well ... things that were a bit below Nirvana's album output. Even below the output of their following b-sides, such as Even in His Youth, Curmudgeon, Marigold and Moist V.<br />If you want to settle down with this record for a long while, you will find a friend.<br />But you sure won't find a lover.
1573225517|5.0|I read this book after seeing the movie a number of times and I found that, while I love the movie the book is just amazing. Of course the book is generally better than the movie and this still holds true but they did a good job with the movie not changing too many details. Nick Hornby writes great books. You can totally relate to his character's strange sometimes childish behavior and laugh at them and at yourself. I couldn't put it down!
B00006HBUA|4.0|The only reason I wanted to see this movie was because of Sarah Michelle Gellar. It was refreshing to see her without a stake. I was so amazed from beginning to end. The plot was simple yet intelligent enough to keep you guessing. The Scooby Gang is phenomenal. It's like they took the 2-D further without dissing the cartoon and I actually liked the CGI Scooby better than the animated one. I nixed one star off for the deleted scenes. The movie would've been better with them included. ok except for the Velma song which was bit overdoing it. Can't wait for Scooby 2!
B0000041WV|5.0|It's, unfortunately, probably fair to describe the status of Dvorak's symphonies by saying that the musicologists like the seventh, classical audiences like the eighth, and more general audiences can recognize the slow movement of the New World (although they frequently think that it is a Negro spiritual).  In fact, though, Dvorak ranks with Brahms and Tchaikovsky as one of the supreme masters of orchestral music in the late nineteenth century.  This set, with all nine of the symphonies, three of Dvorak's overtures, and the Scherzo Capriccioso, makes an impressive case for Dvorak's orchestral music.  While some may prefer other performances of individual pieces to those offered here, every performance is worthy of a five-star rating.  There are absolutely no issues with the sound, although the recordings date from the 1960s and, perhaps, early 1970s (Istvan Kertesz drowned in 1973).  The bargain price makes this set a superb value.

If so..... then you HAVE to hear the new self titled album from 30 Seconds to Mars... this completely different version of an actor/musician combination speaks for itself... extremely creative and odd noises add to their their rockin'ess.. and &quot;the calm before the storm&quot; pretty much sums up the lyrics and flare of the music as its soft at times then bursts into huge explosions [good explosions at that]... yet always seem to remain passionate and genuine, making them an all around great band. The sound is one that really sticks out among other artists today which explains their core of devoted fans, something that every band wishes to have within its career.. I personally  [im sure other people too] know they are one of the best bands to break through and make it to the &quot;big show&quot; this year, and I think they will be here for a long time to come. and i have no problem with that!...... so if you ever get the chance to listen to these guys absolutely DO NOT pass it up, then when you fall in love with them you can remember me saying... &quot;I told you so!&quot;

I still hum the tunes in my head and only amnesia can kick them out. The songs were great. This should've gotten an Emmy and a Tony nomination (TV Classic yes but it ain't RENT). Still I wish I could've heard more from Willow. Under Your Spell would've been nice duet I think. Either way I'm glad this is on CD and hope there will be another one soon.

6304233639|1.0|This movie has been called \\"wonderful\\" and \\"a great sc-fi movie for the modern times\\". Anyone who said that is obviously under some sort of trance or perhaps on drugs. This movie, at the most, is a \\"B\\" class flik with absolutely no plot and little acting ability. They could have at least made the movie make sense to make up for its horrible acting and scripting but no, it is incoherent dribble. For one thing, it takes place in 4 DAYS! All of that takes place in four days. What? Second of all, how young is that president? You have to be over thirty to be a president and he looks to be thirty at the oldest, possibly younger.<BR>     I also noticed that logistics played no part in the making of this movie. The directors said, \\"We want him to be in a desert.\\" So they put him in huge desert, where there isn't one in real life! Then there's the whole thing about them just saying, \\"Anyone who can fly or, heck, as even looked at a plane, come over here  and we'll give you some top of the line jets to use.\\" but don't get me started. Plus there is the scene where the city gets hit and the lady hides in a small room right next to where the flames are coming and doesn't even get first degree burns.<BR>      As for the acting, it is abysmal. But perhaps that's just because it is a horrible plot with crummy dialogue. They throw in mediocre jokes that are repetetive and stupid to begin with.<BR>      Finally, the ending doesn't even makes sense. Even if they did destroy the aliens, they still have radiation in the atmosphere and all of their major cities have been wiped out. What will they do about the economy? Luckily, they don't have to worry about it because they'll all be dead from radiation sickness in a few days anyway.<BR>     SO, in closing, I agree with everyone else who has given this a bad review and I pity the one person who said that they've seen it twelve times. You poor, disturbed man. It is the worst movie ever created that I have seen (besides \\"Glen or Glenda\\", Ialso pity anyone who has actually seen that). Do not buy or rent this movie, unless you enjoying laughing and making fun of movies. Instead you could just go stab yourself with hot fire pokers or possibly light your hair on fire or something equally enjoyable, you'd have as much fun as if you saw this movie.
B000002UYZ|5.0|Previewing the song selection before purchase, one scratches their heads at the sheer volume of Beatles songs that are a part of our shared culture. Suddenly all rational thought and sense of logic are thrown out the window when our friendly little \\"imaginary consumer\\" remembers that this is less than a mere ½ of the Beatles enduring legacy; part II, the \\"Blue\\" series is still necessary, as are their individual albums which continue to stand as landmark achievements in songwriting and recording. However, after gawking over the sheer magnitude of the hits on this compilation, our imaginary customer may now look at the price tag and begin to have doubts about it's value.  I now realize that I can no longer stand passively on the side lines; for the greater good of humanity as a whole, and the betterment of the personal psyche of \\"imaginary consumer\\", I must wholeheartedly and without prejudice recommend this amazing listening experience!<br />Sheer numbers of \\"mega hits\\" aside, the amount of growth exhibited in the brief four year span that this disc covers is remarkable.  As a young musician learning his first guitar chords, it may very well come to pass that disc one of this compilation will guide you through your darkest hour of musical doubts; indeed, it is humanly possible to progress from the relatively simple composition of a \\"Please Please Me\\" or \\"Love Me Do\\" to the orchestral grandeur of a \\"Yesterday\\", and this merely encompasses one single disc, an unbelievable span of  three years of songwriting growth!   Or perhaps our listener is learning his first lessons of love, feeling helplessly alone in suddenly harsh world, yet the soothing strains of \\"Yesterday\\" remind him that he is certainly not alone in this seemingly uncaring world.  The listener then puts in disc two, and if any doubt remains that he is alone in the darkness of love lost, the opening trilogy of \\"Help!\\", \\"You've Got To Hide Your Love Away\\" and \\"We Can Work It Out\\" will serve as a loving embrace and a reminder that indeed, you are not alone!!  <br />There are however among us a group of individuals who are widely known as \\"cynics\\", a pleasant group indeed, but certainly a group that may not relate to my psychological story above.  They have been shaking their heads all the while during my time on the podium, their eyes having still not left the price tag section of the disc.  It is at this time that I typically resolve to save my breath and allow the cynics their fair loss.  My heart grips me however, and I realize that I must relate to them the reasons why, even from a coldly economic standpoint, the purchase of this compilation is worthwhile.  Many of the songs on this compilation, \\"Paperback Writer\\" for instance, were originally released as \\"Singles\\" and are thus more difficult to locate on a typical compact disc format. To collect all of these songs by purchasing the many discs on which they are contained would likely cost triple or even quadruple the price of this compilation!!  Added to the fact that you have lyrics for everything, several lovely pictures (each one shows the Fab Four's hair growing slightly longer), and a crisp and clean remastered sound quality, it becomes necessary for me to advise even the harshest cynics of the world that this is a necessary purchase.  <br />I now thankfully alight from my soapbox, as warm fuzzy feelings of charity towards my fellow man engulfs my heart.  Perhaps my words today have inspired a real life \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" or \\"Father MacKenzie\\" to not feel so alone in this world, or at the very least allowed somebody to escape into the musical equivalent of heaven for the all too brief listening experience that is \\"The Beatles, 1962-1966\\".
B0000026UL|3.0|When I caught a whiff of this album, soon after its release, I was certain it wasnt Dylan. Yes, he'd been accused of shifts of biblical proportion before. And yes, he'd even written a couple of poor songs. But this change didnt seem to be about some kind of artistic growth or exploration. It's a paradox, magnanimous antipomp from a charismatic sinner, a strange blend of \\"ye shalt not\\" and \\"i wished i hadnt\\".<br />Ten years later, eh... T'aint so bad. If you have a great interest in Dylan, and want to know much about his evolution, you won't want to skip this turn. But if you're happy hearing what's fully enjoyable and don't need to dip into the eccentricities of some missteps and meanders, this one's skippable.
0142000663|5.0|I read this awhile ago, but it sticks in my head.  I must agree with some other reviews that the chapters explaining what is going on around the family can drag slightly.  However, they become less and less and story is amazing.  What these people went through and how they thought still amaze me.  Great stuff.  You will definately enjoy this classic and learn alot along the way.
0783246641|4.0|Well, I was thinking that I would be getting a visual interpretation of the incredible novel that swept through America like an unwanted fire, plaque, or insect invasion. Only the _Village Voice_ recognized the book for the marvelous, fun-filled romp through insanity and the light-hearted nature of purchases and acquisitions in the business world.<br />I was also thinking that it would be fun to watch the kid who was just great in _Empire of the Sun_. Well, the little devil grew up and isn't allowed to fall into being typecast as a boy entering puberty in a Japanese concentration camp. We do, however, get to see what hell post-puberty can be when it is mixed with far too much salary for far too little work in New York. <br />You *must* read the book first: this is required because the only serious flaw in the film is its inability to clearly let you know what really happened as opposed to what the psycho thought happened or, worse, what he wanted to happen but didn't!<br />Unfortunately, for common decency, the \\"best parts\\" did not appear in the film. You are cheated out of seeing all sorts of things that would be better discussed in a teenage serial killer chat room over in Yahoo. Let's just say that one of many highlights in the book but not in the film involved the things one can do with a sharpa (not sure of the spelling, but it is that dog from China that has thousands of wrinkles) before and after its senseless death. Does dinner sound good about now?<br />The obsession with food is not clearly explained in the film: let's just say for common decency here that our lead character is a man of extraordinary tastes--tastes that make Hannibal Lector come across as Julia Child.<br />Finally, the film mistook satire for parody: far too many scenes are so off-the-wall that they come across as humor. On the other hand, more often than not, good satire causes introspection and an uneasiness about a situation. In this case, the uneasiness is the awful feeling that our society is creating monsters because of its insane worship of power and the obscene display of wealth.
0671799320|5.0|Yes, the size of the book is a bit daunting- over 700 pages.  Thankfullly Yergin is an excellent writer and those 700 pages quickly seem like no burden at all.  \\"The Prize\\" is an engrossing tale of oil that shows how important the commodity has been for the last century and a half.<br />Yergin adds short little stories to his history that add flavor and color to the book. My favorite was about the last British man to leave Iran following the 1979 revolution.  He had just come down with a major sickness when the Ayatollah came to power and he went through one hell of a time to get back to Great Britian.<br />Anyway, the book hardly ever drags and is not boring at all.  The history of WW II is especially enlightening.  \\"The Prize\\" also is a great explanation of why we have such a vested interest in the Middle East.  If you are puzzled by our attachment to Saudi Arabia, you should read this book.
B00000255X|5.0|...this would probably be it. During the summer of 1990, it was in my player on &quot;repeat&quot; for nearly a week, and just as gripping every time. Each tune deserves its own review: &quot;Oh Sister&quot; is worth crying to. &quot;Hurricane&quot; is somehow incredibly powerful, but impossible to cover without sounding like a farce. &quot;Mozambique&quot; conceals something somehow sinister, beneath a veil of uptempo pizzaz. ... etcetera. Fantastic, throughout. Simply fantastic!
B00005T30L|3.0|First off this is not a review,plenty around on this flick.<BR>Also I'm lazy so you only get one paragraph.The acting was<BR>very good overall,some of it subdued to say the least.<BR> And the screenplay/story is good.It's a good film period.<BR>Every review I read on this film(5+),during it's theatrical<BR>release praise it to no end.Everything story,actors,ect.<BR>I think thier are far greater &quot;youth movies&quot;out there,with<BR>much more dynamics going on.<BR> I would have given this movie 4 stars had everyone else not<BR>been so liberal with the 5 star thing,I mean really its<BR>no Heathers.
B00005JKHP|3.0|Good movie for the year of production, only a little to long.
B00005JKDR|5.0|&quot;Monsters Inc&quot; is the most amazing movies I have ever seen (next to Shrek, GREAT MOVIE!).  It is both suited to the subtle adult humor as well as child oriented slapstick.  The characters are both very identifiable as well as limited by human like conditions.  Thus the audience can feel empathy for the Mike and Sully despite the fact that one is covered in blue hair and the other is a Cyclopes.<BR>   The plot is the movie is well developed for both the ADD attention span of today's youths and adults.  There is plenty of action for the youngsters, while also having more than enough non-cliché meat for the adults to chew on.<BR>   &quot;Monsters Inc&quot; also both all its viewers to remember what it was like to be a child; to wonder what hiding in the closet and what lurks under the bed.  The writers and Pixar effectively play off this instinct and build it into a fanciful world where the roles are switched and monsters are scared of humans.<BR>   Though the implications of some scene might slightly be pushing the bar on PG, this movie is suitable for every age group: kids, teens, young adults, adults, and older folk.<BR>   I give it an A+, one of the best movies I've ever seen.  I think every American home deserves a copy of this fine Hollywood flick.  Get it today!<br />-Blaise
B00000K3UR|2.0|I did not think this was a very funny movie.  I did not get the laughs I expected.
0871137380|4.0|Black Hawk Down is a true story of modern war. The dramatic account of a U.S. Special Forces' mission takes place in the year 1993, in Mogadishu, Somalia. The United States occupied Somalia for humanitarian reasons, dropping food and supplies.  The original mission of the Special Forces was to helicopter in and capture enemy warlords.  This is not one of the United States finer moments.  It is a horrifiying detailed account of a mission gone wrong.<br />The author, Mark Bowden, tells the story of how young eager soldiers full of enthusiasm, are shot down by the enemy. Our brave men are trapped and very unprepared. The author gives very graphic details of the battles and attempts to rescue the helpless soldiers.  He makes you feel as though you are there, watching the enemy come from all directions; the fear and desperation of our service men, as our casualties mount.  You feel the frustration of the commanding officers as they attempt rescue missions. The message is clearly, no one is left behind.<br />At the end of this true story, the United States lost 18 of our men. Many more were wounded and left emotionally scarred. This was a horrific misjudgement by the U.S. government, but it is a story that must be told.  It does not glorify our Special Forces as super-humans, but men sent to do a job, with the reality that they mey never come back.<br />I thought this was an excellent book that everyone should read especially at this time in our country.  It is a realistic look at war and not the glorified conquests we see so often on television and movies. After reading this book, I imagine I felt like the people who watched helplessly,as the number of dead mounted, during the Vietnam War.
0375414053|4.0|I thought \\"I Don't Know How She Does It\\" by Allison Pearson was an entertaing read.  Easy on the eyes and fairly quick to read.  The characters are a tad too busy for my tastes, but that's just me and not the writer.  The writer is great and her book like I said before is entertaining and well worth the read.
B00005NW02|5.0|This CD has to be one of the greatest to be released lately. System of a Down (SOAD for short) have progressed quite nicely with this CD. This CD is different from most of the stuff out there now, which makes it good.
0811836363|5.0|At long last something I have been wanting to get my hands on for a very long time, &quot;The Beatles:Anthology&quot; by Beatles.  A book well worth the read.
B000002MY3|5.0|Who would have thought that this former Canadian pop princess could have given us this brilliant piece of misery? Glen Ballard produced this record. Like all of his work, it is written, recorded and mixed in little time. But at the end, it is generally a radio and sales friendly peice of work. This time was the same, other than this captured something that defined an era of female music. It is passionate, edgy, and near perfect. There has not been a record of this caliber that has come across my desk since. Her follow-ups have not been anywhere near as good.<br />Songs like \\"You Aughta Know,\\" \\"Head Over Feet,\\" and \\"Ironic\\" are all great.  There is probably only one or two songs on this entire record that could not be released as a single.  There is not much that I would say is bad about this record except that it may be a bit whiney. . .But overall, this is one of the best records of the mid-1990's. . .
B000069AUI|5.0|&quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot; is one of the most brilliant records I've heard in many years, at least since the last Coldplay release &quot;Parachutes&quot;. The current CD is a bit more lush in production than the previous and generates more of an emotional response to the music, with simple yet honest lyrics. &quot;Rush&quot; is also more upbeat than the previous release too, while the band indulges in several shades of style, from pop rock, to folk rock, to ballady piano, to pyschedelic/mid eastern and you get the feeling that this band is ready to take over the world without compromising their integrity for honest and powerful music.<br />Absolutely fantastic vocals by Chris Martin with subtle yet powerful and clever muscianship from the other members, this new album is an awesome sophomore comeback from a band which I hope sticks around for a long time.<br />Buy it.
B00005RFAI|4.0|This was a very good CD.  The more I listened to it the more I liked it.  True this album is different from her first, but different isn't always bad.  In fact, this CD proves that Pink has a broader range than people give her credit for.  She can sing the heck out of R&amp;B (my personal favorite), but she's just as good at soul, pop, and alternative rock.  After reading the other reviews, it was obvious that the people who were polarized to solely one kind of music or the other (R&amp;B or Pop) couldn't fully appreciate this album.  There isn't a song on the album that's hard to listen too.  I'll let you decide for yourself which ones are your personal favorites.  Personally, If Pink can keep turning out albums like this regardless of the music focus, I'll keep buying.  I give it two thumbs up!  My big toes too.
B000000OPW|5.0|&quot;Candyman&quot; may open this album and &quot;Cities in Dust&quot; may be a club hit, but this album isn't a throw-away. faaaaar from it! Tinderbox is a full-bodied, dark tapestry of drama and night. &quot;The Sweetest Chill&quot; has a shimmering, nocturnal resonance that just screams dusk. &quot;This Unrest&quot; slithers in with a hollow autumn groove turning into a full-on night jam with synth strings, ghostly voices and all. &quot;Umbrella&quot; and &quot;An Execution&quot; are excellent pieces to evoke all you creatures of the night; great music for cruising at night or hiding in corners. aside from gothic music being half post-punk, the other half has always been(to me) a certain element of stark baroqueness: this album has it in spades. the guitars are beautifully arranged, almost to the point of sounding like harpsichords. if you're used to hearing gothic music performed in the minimalist Joy Division way you're in for a surprise; this is gothic music in the broadest way -- like drapes in a mansion, this is lavish gothic velvet.
0316666343|1.0|Although this book does an admirable job of portraying the family's shock, uncertainty and grief following the disappearance of elder daughter Susie in a way that rings true to those of us who thankfully have never experienced such a tragedy, it is on the whole an unbelievable and awkwardly written story.  The description of the rape-murder early on contains an embarrassingly clumsy allusion to a mortar and pestle, made all the more ungainly by its obvious attempt at poetic style.  Susie's heaven, the literary vehicle that has garnered so much praise, is really no different from the hokey limbo world of ghost stories where spirits who have \\"unfinished business\\" on earth pass eternity.  The relationship between Hal, the cool twenty-something biker and older brother of Lindsey's (Susie's younger sister) boyfriend, and Buckley, Susie's traumatized younger brother, is completely awkward and unbelievable.  No normal, good-looking young man in the prime of life, which is how Hal is portrayed, would really split his time between his rough and tough biker friends and faithfully babysitting a traumatized, unrelated four-year-old Buckley into traumatized teenhood.  Hal even goes so far as to bake cookies with grandma and help throw little family parties like The Fonz and Mrs. C.  The final appearance of the killer is unbelievable and strangely truncated, as if Ms. Sebold didn't know what else to do with him.  The treatment of Susie's \\"love\\" interest, Ray, is also totally unbelievable.  Fourteen-year-old boys simply do not agonize into adulthood over the end of a schoolyard crush on a girl they barely knew.  The \\"miraculous event\\" hinted at on the front flap of the dust cover is just plain weird, sort of like a twisted genetically engineered cross between a romance novel and The Exorcist.  The thinly veiled undercurrent of feminist dogma throughout the story makes the \\"miraculous event\\" hypocritical, involving as it does the usurpation of a woman's body for the sexual pleasureof others (does the fact that it's for a romantic interlude between those others make it ok?).  The feminist slant is particularly evident in the relationship between Susie's parents, although it is also evident in Susie's heaven, the relationship between Ray's parents (no happy marriages in this story), and the treatment of lesbianism in one character.  Susie's mother is portrayed as the tragic victim of the gender-repressive 1950's and 60's for whom the 1973 murder prompts a long overdue breaking-away to discover her true self, which I personally found to be selfish, dishonest and disloyal.  Susie's father is portrayed as a pathetically weak man for whom the murder only casts a spotlight on his inadequacies as a husband and father as he bungles his way to an incompetent attempt at revenge and years of isolation before re-accepting his wife without question and with open arms despite her humiliating abandonment of the family.  Indeed it is not the father but, in yet another unbelievable scene, his surviving 13-year-old daughter Lindsey who actually makes the heroic attempt to identify Susie's killer.  Yes, this book does have its moments but they are few and vastly overshadowed by its weaknesses.  Don't believe the hype.
0060392886|5.0|i highly recommend this book to anyone who likes sex, drugs and rock n' roll. even if you don't like their music, it's very entertaining and quick to read.
0743216458|5.0|I have read the book, watched the mini-series, read the unit battle citations, and even talked to a member of Easy Company 506th PIR.  Band of Brothers is a realistic, accurate representation of the events that shaped one of the finest fighting units ever assembled.  It made me feel like I was walking right alongside the other soldiers.
0140143505|4.0|84 Charing Cross Road<br />When I lived in London, people spoke of this address with awe and respect.  I did not know why until I finally picked up the story.  <br />84, Charing Cross Road is a delightfully plain (and true) story about a woman in New York who orders books from a regular old bookshop in London.  While the woman could seek out an address in London to purchase her books, she chooses to remain loyal to Marks & Co. of London.  The letters encompass a near 20 year span and each one is more brilliant than the next.<br />The charm and wit of this love affair between Ms Helene Hanff and the bookshop staff, and their books, is undeniable.  The book is short and sweet, enjoyable and just wonderful.  Tragically, being that it is from true life, it teaches an important moral.  <br />If you are ever in London, you will never pass 84, Charing Cross Road with the same feeling. Enjoy!<br />10/15/02
B000056V73|4.0|If you look closely, you can see the arc of Cameron Crowe's films as they mirror his own journey from precocious adolescent (FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH, SAY ANYTHING, SINGLES) to successful professional (JERRY MAGUIRE), with music always marking the trail he has taken. Now a successful 40-something, Crowe does what we all do at that stage. He looks backwards, with longing. And so, in ALMOST FAMOUS, he offers us a loving reflection on his youth and the music that lit the way. With this picture, Crowe does the impossible. he makes us nostalgic for the 70s. Somehow, thanks to Crowe, the era has taken on that burnished glow that only memory can endow.<br />Crowe starts his film with credits... not an unusual technique. Except these credits are being written in pencil on a yellow note pad by a disembodied hand. The hand writes out each name, even misspelling `Frances McDormand' then erasing the error and fixing it. The credits have not even finished and I already love this movie. This in not some generic, Hollywood story, measured and sliced with a cookie-cutter called `market research.' This is a personal story being told by somebody. And a young somebody, to boot. inexperienced, but gamely writing as fast as he can, fixing his mistakes along the way. If the credits are this good, what will the movie be like, I wonder.<br />Crowe was a teenager who wrote Rock criticism for Rolling Stone magazine in the 70s, before his FAST TIMES adventure. It is that period of his life that provides the basis for the movie's plot.<br />Cast as the young Crowe is Patrick Fugit. He is Crowe as a decent, nerdy, talented boy (called William), who is barely surviving his loving, overbearing mother. As mom, Frances McDormand is simultaneously unnerving and endearing in her Oscar nominated performance. William's loving but irritating big sister clashes with mom and sis takes off with her boyfriend to become a stewardess. In an effort to save him from mom's influence, sis leaves behind her record collection. That pile of vinyl opens up a whole new universe for William. He is an `un-cool' high school kid, isolated and in pain, father-less, sister-less. but Rock n Roll becomes his world and his salvation.<br />William becomes a writer, precociously penning music criticism for local papers. He is befriended by the burned-out editor of Creem Magazine, Lester Bangs, brilliantly played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Hoffman creates a curmudgeonly mentor for William, a sort of ghost of Christmas-yet-to-be, ranting that `Rock is dead' and providing other such heartening insights, while also giving him a willing ear and an encouraging word. Though based on an actual figure, Hoffman's Les Bangs is an original film creation. a Rock prophet-guru-nerd who, seeing his end in sight as he slouches toward Bethlehem, can't help but try to pass the torch.<br />William is offered the chance to cover a touring band on the rise (the group a bit preciously named `Stillwater') for Rolling Stone magazine by an unsuspecting editor that doesn't know the kid is only 15. William joins the tour while his worried mother screams to anyone who'll listen that `musicians have kidnapped my son!' She has only let him go because she knows how much he needs this adventure, yet she is deathly afraid of losing her last child. Upon boarding the tour bus, young William/Cameron journeys like Dante into the inferno. He is doggedly pursued by worried messages from mom and accompanied only by his yellow note pad, his long-distance calls to mentor Bangs, and the `Stillwater' family that teaches him about who he is and who he can become. Still waters run deep, indeed.<br />One of his Virgils is the band's enigmatic guitarist, Russell, brought to vivid life in actor Billy Crudup's breakthrough performance as the Rock n Roll hero with feet of clay. The other is the siren Penny Lane, the beautiful free spirit who, as a `band-aid', acts as both muse and sex toy for Crudup. She is ephemeral and damaged, living in devotion to the music. Of course, the Russell-Kate-William triangle is an eternal one, resulting in pain and growth for all concerned. Kate Hudson's Penny Lane is a magical character, and it's a star-making performance, worthy of her Oscar.<br />But the key, supporting player in Crowe's tale is the music. There is a moment in the movie when everyone is on the bus, and it has been a long, bad night. Emotions are frayed. The mood is fragile. Elton John's song `Tiny Dancer' is heard and, one at a time, everyone starts to sing along. Music heals. Families can injure, but they can heal, too. Like his earlier films, music is the heart and soul of this film, both in the dramatic moments and concert scenes, dramatizing the effect on both the players and the audience as together they create, for a moment, a surrogate family for all who need one.<br />It seems at first a small story to build a movie on. Nothing blows up. The sex is mostly off-screen. Like all of Crowe's other pictures, ALMOST FAMOUS is a character study in the coming-of-age genre. But, when seen through the context of his career to date, you realize it's about Crowe coming of age, as much as the characters in the film.<br />Unlike film-school filmmakers, Crowe doesn't make films about films. He makes movies about life. And so, he tells stories about us. They are stories worth telling and he tells them wonderfully well. Like all of Crowe's other films, ALMOST FAMOUS is a tale both personal and universal. It made me reconsider the era I grew up in, and the person I was then and am today. goddamn him. That's the power of a great storyteller and, make no mistake, Crowe is perhaps the foremost auteur of his generation.
0316666343|5.0|I must admit, I had no intention of reading this book when I discovered the subject matter.  I am very sensitive to issues of this nature, and didn't think that I could deal with it.  However, several members of a reading group I belong to raved about it.  They praised it as a deeply moving spiritual novel.  So, I decided to give The Lovely Bones a chance.<br />I couldn't be more glad that I did. The Lovely Bones follows the spiritual journey of a girl, a family and a community after a deep loss. The catch is that the story is written from the perspective of the murdered young girl. While the first chapter was difficult to read, the mood is softened by the soul of the girl. Her easiness and frankness with the subject matter make it readable. <br />This is only where the journey begins, though. Sebold has created a novel that is emotionally powerful and gripping. Her ability to mold and create characters is both eerie and comforting. Slowly, you will recognize growth and character development. The introduction of these qualities is so subtle, it is realistic, almost as though you are really meeting someone and getting to know them in reality.<br />Sebold has created a work of art with this novel. While the subject matter is intense, it is tastefully presented and flawlessly explored. Her exquisite talent is showcased by this beauty of a story. Enjoy<br />10/15/02
B000063DI8|3.0|No Prayer for the Dying is Iron Maiden's 1990 follow-up album to the Seventh Son album, a hugely successful album. Steve Harris wanted to take a step back to the basics and produce more of a \\"Garage\\" type sound, instead of expanding on the huge and progressive nature of their last two albums, \\"Somewhere in Time\\" and \\"Seventh Son\\". Adrian Smith disagreed with this approach and left the band. Janick Gers was brought in, and indeed brought a much more raw and hard edge to the rhythm and overall sound. The contrast between Gers and Dave Murray on guitar is extremely big. The two styles are extremely different, almost two much so. Harris' vision is understood, but the result is a rather poor and lackluster effort from a band that we came to expect so much from. Not that it's a bad album in anyway, just not up to the calibur of their previous seven albums. The first three songs are actually pretty good. \\"Tailgunner\\" is this albums fast paced energetic opener, followed by \\"Holy Smoke\\" one of the two singles from this album, a very good song with a great back to back solo where you can clearly hear the differences in style of the two guitarists. The title track follows and is a more melow but good song, similar to \\"Children of the Damned\\" from the \\"Number of the Beast\\" album. The album now proceeds to descend into a series of songs not worth mentioning. Assasin is just not a good song, not up to Maiden calibur. It does, however, pick up towards the end with the last three songs. \\"Hooks in you\\" is indeed a catchy song, with a cool chorus, and characteristic creepy vocals from Bruce Dickinson. Great guitar work as well. \\"Bring your Daughter to the Slaughter\\" in next, and was the other single released. A very catchy chorus with hysterical lyrics. \\"Mother Russia\\" is a descent attempt to end the album with a Maiden characteristic epic finale, but it falls short compared to \\"Alexander the Great\\" or \\"Hallowed be thy name\\". In general, it's a good album as far as Rock and Roll goes, but the worst Maiden album up until that point.
B00005QY5Y|2.0|I encourage all those who are interested in Adams (or have given up on him after this album) to check out the work he did previously with Whiskeytown- a lot more feeling and much better musicianship. He should never have given up on his country roots, in my opinion.
B000063DI9|4.0|\\"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\\" is the follow-up album to \\"Somewhere in Time\\", my personal favorite Maiden album. It's hard for any band to follow-up to their best work, but Iron Maiden does so very well here. This album continues with the mood and feeling from their previous offering delivering a very moody effects driven album. The songs however seem to be more structured with the intention of appealing to radio, etc. Four of the songs were released as singles, half the album. Even if this wasn't the case, it's not nearly as progressive as \\"Somewhere in Time\\". It's a \\"concept\\" album in that all the songs are related and continue narrating the life and saga of a character with special powers, the seventh son of a seventh son. The album opens with \\"Moonchild\\", a typical fast and catchy song that usually opens their albums. The next song \\"Infinite Dreams\\" slows down the pace and this is where you really get into the album. This is a great song, with several time changes, and cool solo's. The next two songs \\"Can I play with Madness\\" and \\"The Evil that men do\\" were the two big hits off the album, and they are great songs. \\"The Evil that Men do\\" is my personal favorite from this collection. Fantastic rhythms and solo's. Very catchy. The next song is the title track, and it's not one of my favorites. The album seems to loose a little steem here. The song, IMO, get's a little monotonous like some Maiden songs tend to do, but this is a long song, and I usually skip it I hate to say. The next song is a rare song written by Dave Murray, guitarist and founding member along with Bassist Steve Harris. It's a good song, and obviously features a good solo from the six-string wizard himself, Dave Murray. \\"The Clairvoyant\\" is next, also released as a single, and features another great solo from Murray. Overall a good song, but the finale, \\"Only the good die young\\" is a great song to close with. It describes the poetic end of the character we've been following throughout the album. It's a fast, and catchy song, great lyrics. Not a typical long epic song that usually ends most of Maiden's album, but you can look at this album as one big epic, and this song is one of my favorites. Overall a great album. I highly recommend it. This is guitarist Adrian Smith's last album with the band, and consequently the last truly great Maiden album, until their most recent \\"Brave New World\\", which marks the return of Bruce Dickinson and Adrian Smith to the band.
B00005OAIE|4.0|Every so often, we run upon a little pop gem here and there.  This is one of those treasures.  There's not a bad song on this record; though some were tarted up for major label release from their earlier versions.<BR>The last debut that excited me to this level was Marshall Crenshaw's first album.  If that gives you any indication, this kid's got an open road ahead.  Fresh sound!
B0000542DJ|5.0|first of all, JFK is probably one of the greatest and most contriversial movies EVER made. JFK was so contriversial, that the government themselves were scared about the threat this movie posed. because of all the uproar from the american people, the government formed an assassination committee which released certain files into the assassination of John Kennedy.<br />the movie centers around Distric Attonrney Jim Garrisson's investigation into the murder of the century. you follow Garrisson's every move from his interrigation into the \\"most important witness in history\\" in David Ferrie to the conclussion of the trial. Great movie with many factual events and many interpretations of what could have happened. you can't fit all the information of the JFK assassination into a 3 hour movie, so you compress some of the information, like Oliver Stone did.<br />the DVD features are great. you meet Donald Sutherland's character, X, and you see a 30 minute film on the new documents of the assassination. you also get to see a whole bunch of extra or deleted scenes. you have to watch the extra and delected scenes in order to appreciate what job the film editor and Oliver Stone did to make this masterpiece complete. <br />great film that moves you in one way or another.
B00006HBUC|5.0|At first I thought that it would be O.k but when I saw the movie I loved it!!! Since I was a little girl I loved Scooby-Doo and now im 10 and still love it!!! I kind of think at first Scrappy should of not been the bad guy. I think Scooby-Dum would of played the part but I see where it was going!!! I think anyone would love it even if you don't like scooby-doo. It is really funny!!!
B00004YZFR|5.0|This is a great video not so much for the music, but for the way that it captures Altamont and the end of the 60's.  The concert footage pales in comparison to concert videos that we now see, but no other Rock video has been made as captivating as this.  The setting up of the concert, the concert, and the climax give the video a story unlike anything imaginable.  It is really more of a documentary then a 'music video'.  No, I did not grow up in the 60's, actually more late 70's and 80's.  This would be in my top 3 of all Rock Videos.
B0000029GA|5.0|Easily one of the greatest rap records ever released, Nasir Jones' \\"Illmatic\\" is the Leonardo DaVinci painting of the Hip-Hop culture. Even when it hit the streets early in 1994, those who heard it for the first time knew it would stay a powerful piece of music history. From the very first sentence of his verse on \\"Life's A B****\\" (\\"I woke up early on my born day/ I'm twenty years, a blessing/ the essence of adolescence leaves my body\\"), Nas' intricate vocabulary and impecible flow catch the listener's mind in an evolving landscape of ghetto life. The young \\"Nasty\\" Nas flawlessly holds his own over the amazing soul-power of Pete Rock (\\"It's Yours\\"), the scathing basslines of Large Professor (\\"Halftime\\", \\"One Time 4 Your Mind\\") and the jazz-twinge of Q-Tip (\\"One Love\\"). And it's hard to hear anyone else over DJ Premier's production for \\"Memory Lane\\", a mirrored reflection of both the better and worse days of the past. Even Nas' father, famed Jazz musician Olu Dara, stops by to add a smooth, calming fade-out on his trumpet in \\"Life's A B****\\". As short as the album is (ten tracks), the pace is constant and the flaws are kept at zero. With both production and lyrics in the realm of perfection, the record ends almost before it begins, on the positive note of \\"It Ain't Hard To Tell\\", as Nas' last words almost smirk as they echo \\"My poetry's deep, I never fell...\\"
B000050IMH|4.0|It's about time slasher movies were poked fun at. They're such an old, abused form of horror. &quot;Scary Movie&quot; is a funny parody of the formula that works well. While much of the humor is sick and vulgar, it doesn't get over-excessive like the awful &quot;Not Another Teen Movie.&quot; We get pot-shots at spooky flicks like &quot;Scream,&quot; &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer,&quot; &quot;The Sixth Sense,&quot; as well as jabs at &quot;The Usual Suspects,&quot; &quot;Baywatch,&quot; and &quot;Kazaam.&quot; The plot is appropriately ridiculous and the humor is uproariously funny. &quot;Scary Movie&quot; is the best of the recent film parodies.
0375414053|5.0|Excllent read! The NY Times review of this title made me laugh so hard that I cried and I immediately got my hands on a copy--the book doesn't disappoint. While most working mothers might find it hard to identify with Kate Reddy's endless travel and lofty career as a fund manager, her inner dialogue will seem eerily familiar as will her hurried and skittish relationships with those she loves (children, husband, friends, mother, sister, etc.) This is a totally hillarious and perfect book for stressed out, career-juggling, shoe-addicted mommies everywhere who will laugh out loud as they recognize themselves dashing from home to office and back in a blur and the emotional wreckage that lies in the wake. Highly recommended.
B0000029DD|5.0|Everytime I listen to Grace, track 2 sends a shiver up my spine with the lyric 'Oh it's my time coming, and I'm not afraid to die'.  So prophetic.  This CD is one that I purchased many years back, and continue listen to over and over.  As mentioned by many, it's a must for the CD collection.  So much potential gone in an instant.
B000001Y9I|5.0|I used to think that any Deep Purple album without Ritchie Blackmore was something of an oxymoron, its like Black Sabbath without Tony Iommi or Led Zeppelin without Jimmy Page. After hearing Purpendicular I never thought that way again.  In a word this album is spectacular. This is the most diverse Purple album ever made and the best album since 1984's Perfect Strangers. Deep Purple keep rockin 4ever and Blackers: If you ever feel the need to do hard rock again, Do us a favor reform Rainbow and Never Ever Come Back to Deep Purple Again
0553573403|4.0|George LL Martin sees the story through a variety of characters without duplicating the same events.  I was extremely impressed with this novel and also book 2 of the series, Clash of Kings.  I found myself unable to put the book down because of the suspense brought to the book by the use of the different characters.  It's a must read.
B00006HBUA|4.0|I bought DVD thinking about my 4-year-old daughter, who is an avid fun of Scooby Doo. It's a fun movie, but definitely not for kids below 8. It's sometimes too scary and spooky for a little ones. But it's a great play for older kids and adults (like me) raised on cartoons and old Dracula movies. The crop of young American actors did a very good job. They are not sensational, but they don't have to be to imitate Fred, Velma and others. I wish Rowan Atkinson (famous Mr. Bean) had a better role. He could be such a funny addition to this movie. However, he is barely utilized. The one thing I didn't like was the ending. I want reveal it but I was surprise by the lack of better idea.
6305311463|2.0|Oh that Affleck.  The summer of 98 featured two wanna-be blockbusters that featured &quot;big asteroid hitting the planet and everybody dies&quot; scenarios; Deep Impact and Armageddon.  Armageddon was the worst of the two, and is clearly just another mainstream, crowd pleasing piece of film from wanna-be hotshot director Michael Bay (Bad Boys, The Rock, Pearl Harbor).  Bruce Willis stars as the leader of a group of oil drillers who are recruited to drill a hole in the big rock, drop a nuke, and go back home.  Naturally all doesn't go well, and we get an overly healthy dose of explosions, thrills, chills, and things we've all seen before.  Plus, there is also a love story in all of this (naturally) between driller Ben Affleck and Willis' daughter played by Liv Tyler.  Predictability is abound here, you'll know what will happen before it happens, and while Armageddon may be entertaining for some, it is mindnumbingly dull, and sometimes downright stupid.  The large cast also features Billy Bob Thornton, Owen Wilson, Michael Clarke Duncan, Steve Buscemi, and Keith David among others.  My only question here is why is this part of the Criterion Collection?  Who is Michael Bay paying to have this released on Criterion?  Oh well, at least Armageddon is better than Pearl Harbor.
B00000IPAX|5.0|This is definately blink-182 at its best. With hit songs like Adam's song, all the small things, and mutt, i would definately buy this even if you don't like punk that much. (although if you're still stuck in the nsync/otown/bsb phase, you should just get a life) Mark hoppus (he's so hot) does a great job with the bass and with singing, and tom is great on the FenDeR!! Travis, as usual, is the ausomest drummer, and together these three make music. Great music.
0375823360|2.0|Not very good.  Poor characterization, for one thing.  Characters barely introduced suddenly become everyone's best friend and tears shed when they die.<br />Pretty boring plot line, I kept hoping something would happen but it never did.<br />If you are really bored, try it, you might feel better.
B00005ATQD|1.0|After finally watching this movie, I thought it so pretentious. Tome Cruise's character gets all bent out of shape when his wife. played by his ex, Nicole Kidman, admits to him about having a sexual fantasy about having sex with a Navy man she saw at a party. It is shame that this was Stanley Kubrick's last movie. I especially enjoyed (have in my video collection) Spartacus and 2001: Space Odyssy...
B000002BUY|5.0|Would you please hire someone older than 12 to write your Incubus reviews?
0446677450|5.0|I really liked this book. One of the the things that struck me most was how the authors described one's house as a liability, not an asset. Their point of view is simply that anything you own that takes money out of your pocket is a liability. That goes against everything I've ever heard about houses being most people's biggest asset. A slightly different way of looking at something can have a profound impact.<br />There is another book that looks at life in an unconventional manner that has also had a deep effect on my life. &quot;Working on  Yourself Doesn't Work&quot;, by Ariel and Shya Kane, uses the authors' definition of awareness, which they define as a non-judgmental eeing of what is, to shed new light on how we operate in our lives. The authors take you on a gentle journey of self-discovery, without self-reproach, that opens up a whole new world of possibilities.
0316236535|5.0|My son's preschool teacher told me that my son, who is fascinated by all things scary, was choosing this book every day at preschool, so I bought it to see what it's about. Basically, each cut out page constructs another part of the scary monster's face (big yellow eyes, purple scraggly hair, sharp white teeth, etc.) until the whole face is visible; then, each page deconstructs the face with the order to \\"go away, big yellow eyes!\\" \\"go away, purple scraggly hair!\\" and ends with \\"AND DON'T COME BACK....unless I say so.\\" What a wonderful illustration of facing, deconstructing, and controlling your fears!
B00004VW35|5.0|Absolutely one of Neil's best records -- even if we're not hearing it as it was originally conceived.  And yes, I'm aware there was a lot of griping by the musicians on the sessions.  But the proof is in the pudding.  Why focus on &quot;Misfits,&quot; which is most definitely an acquired taste (and its minimal instrumentation requires a pretty good sound system to really appreciate)?  The first four songs on this record are among the best performances Young has made to date -- from his cover of &quot;The Wayward Wind,&quot; which he transforms wholly into a Neil Young song, to &quot;Are There Anymore Real Cowboys,&quot; which despite its somewhat didactic lyrics is among the most stirring music Young has written.  &quot;Get Back to the Country&quot; -- one of the best anti-rock anthems since Harry Nilsson's &quot;I'll Take a Tango.&quot;<br />And that's not even the best this record has to offer.  For that, look to the absolutely gorgeous &quot;Once an Angel&quot; and to the <BR>achingly sweet &quot;My Boy&quot; (in which Young effortly produces the touching tribute to the artist's son that John Lennon muffed on &quot;Beatiful Boy&quot;).  And the closer, &quot;Where is the Highway Tonight&quot; -- can tear your heart out.<br />This is a concept record, for sure -- it starts out like a parody of country, and gradually, song by song, Young reveals the gut-wrenching, tear-welling power of the genre.  It's quite a feat, and it should be at the top of everyone's Neil list.
B000002HAF|5.0|Up until recently, I had been a skeptic of this band I knew about called The Pixies. I had heard a few of their tracks, but was really not too interested. Not until a few weeks ago did I give &quot;Surfer Rosa&quot; the chance it deserved. Upon doing that I realized, I had it all wrong. Not only was this album great, it made me think. From Black Francis's amazing singing ability, to Kim's lead on Gigantic, I just couldnt stop listening. There is not one track no this CD that I'm not amazed by. Each track offers something new. They make me laugh, think, and just enjoy everything that music has to offer. Reminds me why I became a huge Nirvana fan, and  soon, hopefully, a huge Pixies fan. I don't plan on taking this out of my CD player for months, that is until I get Doolittle.
0780621972|5.0|This movie is a must see.I rented it on video and it was cool.so buy it today and tell me what you think.
0783246641|5.0|Just as the title implies, this guy is a PSYCHO.  But I enjoyed it just as much.  It had a very creepy quality, especially with the idea that his behavior, his life is easily feasible in our money-is-power- driven society. THAT'S what makes this movie creepy.  I recommend this movie to everyone.
B000002GBK|3.0|I've heard just about all of Rick Wakeman's work over the last 25 years.  His playing skill is first rate, but his composing less so.  At times phenomenal, amusing and engaging, he is also predictible and even plodding.  King Arthur is one more example.  His first and last track especially are first rate introductions and closing tunes, ranking right up there with his work in Journey to the Centre of the Earth.  However in the mid tracks (4&amp;5 esp) it seems that he just wants to one-up Kieth Emerson, a-la Brain Salad Surgery.<BR>If Ian Anderson were ever to co-write an album, this would have been it with the period effects balancing the synthesizer work of Rick Wakeman.  Parts of this album are simply too formulatic to be consistently good similiar to Criminal Behaviour and White Rock.<BR>It's too bad the middle is not as good as the first and last; every story must have a beginning, middle and end.  In this case it just isn't projected well enough.<BR>This isn't Wakeman's best nor worst - but it could have been better.
B000069KIZ|4.0|This is, overall, a fantastic set, especially considering the its budget price.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that your taste will decide whether you like the set or not.  Firstly, the 1st Symphony is fabulous, no reservations or quibbles.  The 2nd is elative, though, for some, the tempos may be a bit slow, but I find that Bohm makes it interesing enough (or really, more  interesting than any other conductor I have encountered) that you don't notice that slow tempos at all.  The 3rd may not be to everyone's taste, especially if you think Klemperer's 3rd is the ideal.  Really, though, it is never at any point less than satisfactory, and sometimes quite good.  The 4th is dark and gloomy, if you like it that way.  The Haydn Variations, Tragic Overture and the Alto Rhapsody (especially the Alto Rhapsody) are beyond praise.  The sound, though not digital, is late analog, and is really fantastic, warmer than any digital recording I have encountered made before 1990.  Really, if you want a good collection of the symphonyies, with some bonuses, you can't get better than this, especially at the price range.  Highly Reccomended.
0609610570|4.0|Yes. This book is filled with common sense ideas and information. It's simple stuff that I have never seen implemented well in any corporate environment I've worked in. A simple thing like accountability is all too rare in my experience. I've never had a lot of influence over the inner workings of my employers. But I can incorporate the important, simple ideas in my small sphere of influence. &quot;Execution&quot; is worth the few hours to read it. Then spend an hour deciding how to implement a few of the simple ideas well-presented here.
B00003CXRM|4.0|I am a long-time bluegrass fan, with vinyl from the Carter Family and Doc & Merle Watson to Bill Monroe and Chet Atkins, I looked forward to the soundtrack of this film as much as the story, characters, and direction.<br />I am a great fan of John Hartford and was told this is his last project, so I expected to be \\"wined and dined\\" by the quality of the sountrack. It wasn't up to par and didn't get me running out to by a CD.  But don't stop here -- read on to obtain suggestions for CDs to include in your library.<br />The characters are quirky and the somewhat forgettable, but I enjoyed it while it was on the screen.  There were some side-slappin' times and one of the few films that could bring this generation of movie-goers to visit the Great Depression.  For that reason alone, I give it three stars.<br />I hope younger folks will turn to their parents or grandparents to learn about their own stories of this unforgettable time in our country's history.  Perhpas even the \\"coolest\\" of kids will secretly be tapping their toe to a sound that is much of white America's dreams and struggles.<br />**** for the effort to show our humble years in the depression.  Hartford himself would have been a great character for this film, but I have since learned of his illness during its' inception.<br />Don't just go away with a cute story in your mind though.  Check out \\"Mark Twang\\" or \\"Steam Powered Areoplane\\" by John Harford (once famous for the song \\"Gentle on My Mind\\"); or pay the price for the three disc compilation called \\"Will The Circle Be Unbroken.\\"  You will be surprised to find your roots here, and I dare you not to tap your toes!!!
0800141431|4.0|\\"The Way We Were\\" is about two people who cannot surrender their respective way of looking at the world and is about America in the mid-20th century.  Either story is captivating and makes for fine viewing.  Seeing \\"The Way We Were\\" for the theme song alone is worth it.<br />Streisand plays a Jewish woman with deep convictions, who is ridiculed by many for these convictions.  Whatever she believes in, she believes in it deeply and fights for it.  She will not hold back in speaking her mind.  Redford plays the All-American boy.  He believes in having fun and is a bit of a cynic in his beliefs about the individual being able to change the big picture.  Regardless of their differences, the two fall in love in New York, but will fight for their particular ideologies.<br />The love story between the two is well done.  The audience sees that they care for each other, but that their differences will never let them find true happiness.<br />The view of Americana starts from their college days before WWII and carries until well after the war.  The most in depth view comes from the McCarthy hearings, and more specifically, we see the fight for the Hollywood Ten.  This is an interesting piece of history.<br />I would recommend seeing this movie.
B00006F7S4|5.0|When I popped this cd in I was amazed by it, the songs are so smooth and it puts you in a different world. This is truly Beck's best work yet, you gotta go get this cd
0812550706|5.0|This book kicks off the Ender series by Orson Scott Card, and sets the tone for the next three books.  Card uses moral puzzles and the characters' internal reflections to offset the fast-paced action of this book.<br />Having heard nothing about this book before I began reading it, I was quite surprised to find that the hero was a six year old boy.  However, despite his young age, Ender is mature beyond his years, and the world that surrounds him puts his considerable talents to use.<br />This book is a very good read, endears you to the characters quickly, and is a MUST if you are going to read the subsequent books in this series.  Due to Ender's age in this book, there is no romantic element, but it is more than compensated for by the books continuous action and tension.<br />I highly recommend this book.
0743455967|5.0|Stephen King's On Writing is a very insightful book on Stephen's life as well as the subject of writing. Any writer, like myself, owes it to themselves to check out the book. He really tells it like it is to you, and that's what I like about this book. He's open and honest about the craft and that is what I want to hear. Maybe, one day, I'll have a book published and I'll have him to thank for it all.<br />Seriously, do yourself a favor and get this book for your King collection....you'll be glad you did. :)
B00005JKMQ|2.0|could have been much better if scorcese had directed it. check out raging bull a much better boxing bio from martin scorcese. i expected a lot more from ali. it dosent show enough of his amazing boxing career and as for his life outside the ring it could do a better job there to. except for his stand against the us government the film is very sketchy and blurry. will smith is not to convincing as ali. there are some good performances though. jamie fox is excellent as bundini brown. jon voight is very good as howard cossel. casting real life pro fighter and former world champion james toney as joe frazier was a smart move but hes underused in the film. the fight scenes especially ali vs foreman are well done. in short its ok but could have been much better
B00004TWZK|5.0|When 4 freinds hear of a dead body being found they go off to take a look for themselves.  In the process they discover things about themselves, and each other.  This movie also has some very god acting(regrdless of the age of the participent).  <br />Scifi fans might recognize several of the child actors Will Weaston and Jerry O' Conell.  <br />Also in an interesting tidbit the leaches during the leach scean were real.  <br />So all I can say is.... <br />Wanna go see a dead body?
B00006JL1Z|5.0|This latest remastered collection of Fleetwood Mac Hits is their best yet. This is a more complete collection than the Greatest Hits cd which was released in the late 80's. Basically, you've got the best songs from the self titled \\"Fleetwood Mac\\" cd to the \\"25 Years - The Chain\\" cd collection. Disc 1 includes: Monday Morning, Dreams, You Make Loving Fun, Go Your Own Way, Rhiannon, Say You Love Me, I'm So Afraid (live 1997), Silver Springs, Over My Head, Never Going Back Again, Sara, Love In Store, Tusk, Landslide, Songbird, Big Love (live, 1997) and Storms. Disc 2 includes: The Chain, Don't Stop, What Makes You Think You're The One, Gypsy, Second Hand News, Little Lies, Think About Me, Go Insane (live, 1997), Gold Dust Woman, Hold Me, Seven Wonders, World Turning, Everywhere, Sisters Of The Moon, Family Man, As Long As You Follow, No Questions Asked, Skies The Limit and Paper Doll. Originally a 60's blues band featuring Peter Green and later Bob Welch, Fleetwood Mac in the mid-seventies added two unknowns to the group in guitarist/songwriter Lindsey Buckingham and his girlfriend singer/songwriter Stevie Nicks. The two transformed the once blues band into a sensational pop/rock outfit which was one of the seventies most successful groups. The band itself had some ups and downs throughout the years and at one time called it quits, before re-uniting and releasing a live cd and video entitled \\"The Dance\\". Thankfully Fleetwood Mac is still together and is working on a new cd. This \\"Very Best Of\\" 2-cd collection also includes a nice booklet with pics and a brief history of the band. The sound quality is also superb due to remastering. If you enjoy listening to classic rock then this cd is a must have. Buy it and enjoy. Highly recommended!
630428540X|5.0|After trashing several of John's movies I thought I would review one that I really liked.  It is a good story about a man who suddenly finds that his ability to reason has been kicked up by a factor of ten.  He manages to design a super fertilizer, court a lonely widow and  become an icon for his small community less then a year.  It is a great movie to rent with your date.  <br />Overall-If you like K-Pax you will like this.  <BR>.
0316666343|4.0|I was touched by this story.  It is a compassionate and hopeful vision of a family's struggle with loss.  Hopeful because it is comforting to think that when we lose someone, they are still around, watching us, pulling for us.  Compassionate because Ms. Sebold does not judge any of the players, most importantly, the narrator's mother, who does not deal with her wrenching loss in a &quot;typical&quot; or, it appears from the reviews written here, socially acceptible manner.<br />Yet, as a married woman and a mother, I do not find the mother's reaction impossible to believe or overly harsh.  Losing a child must be, as I can only imagine, the worst experience on earth.  Fleeing is not implausible.<br />Most touching is the interplay between Susie's mother and father, mostly at near the end of the story.  Again, a hopeful and poignant portrait of the complications, disfficulties, bonds and tenderness of marriage.<br />Some reviewers appeared to want more &quot;action&quot; from this read. Maybe our culture doesn't promote quiet studies of emotions enough anymore.  At any rate, I highly recommend this book to anyone who is not afraid to read about the emotions of being on earth (or in heaven).
B000059HCI|3.0|A young man (Jared Leto) gradually becomes an addict, meanwhile his mother (Ellen Burstyn) is becoming addicted to fad diets and diet pills. In addition to this she is watching too much TV and as a result is slowly losing the plot and gradually lapsing into her own bizzare world. But her son is too consumed with his own growing addiction and the lucrative profits to be made by dealing coke with his friends to notice her decline.<BR>The movie is interesting in fits and spurts, but it soon turns into an all-out sensoral assault with not much of a point to it. I don't understand how this is on some lists of \\"Most Disturbing Movies\\". REQUIEM FOR A DREAM didn't disturb me at all. THE SOUND OF MUSIC, now THERE'S a movie that scarred me for life.<BR>However, Darren Aronofsky has crafted a movie which is visually stunning, and puts the old split screen technique to creative use. The soundtrack is strange, to say the least; and features a bizzare combo of strings, techo and distortion.  The cast is good and also includes Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayons. But if you're expecting something \\"disturbing\\" you'll be disappointed.

B000068TPN|5.0|A wonderful movie showing not only the raw emotion on the frontline. But what happened to the wives and families of the soldiers. And what there hell was like. Everyone after seeing this movie should appreciate an American Soldier more and ask forgiveness of a vistnam vet for the way our country treated them during that time.
B00003CWL6|5.0|To me this movie is a classic.  Don't let anyone spoil anything for you if you haven't seen it.  This movie is both a comedy and a drama.  The movie is thoughtful with twists, humor, and storyline.  The acting is superb.  The movie is about a man that is 42 years old with a wife and daughter.  They pretty much hate each other and are all pretty much miserable.  The main character Lester Burnham(Kevin Spacey) narrates to you that he will die in less than a year.  He doesn't know it, and he doesn't tell you how he does.  From this point on, he pretty much tries to turn his life around from being miserable into being happy.  In the process, he makes everyone else miserable and everyone hates him then.  The movie is quite hilarious and is very enertaining.
0767802659|5.0|There is a long thick line drawn between people who \\"get\\" this movie and people who don't. The latter category can include both people who enthuse the violence and people who condemn it; people who don't see the satirical undertones and people who think the film is some sort of pinko plot (whether or not they think that would be a good idea). There's also a small minority of Heinlein fans who are furious that the book has been _adapted_ by the writer and director, rather than faithfully shot page for page.<br />The intelligent viewer will realise that things are rarely black or white: violence is awful, but pretend violence can be dramatically gripping or even funny (and this is nothing new). War is terrible, but the courage and loyalty it can summon are admirable. A war under false pretences is shameful, but once you're in it, you'd better win it. (Sound familiar?) Mindless patriotism is bad, but no state, no matter how civilised or postmodern, can survive without a vigorously maintained army. Citizens have an obligation to the state, but does the state invalidate itself by forcing the citizens to comply?<br />These are the ambiguities that Starship Troopers encompasses in its satire. Unfortunately, ambiguity doesn't play well in this day and age (if it ever did), so in a sense this film was doomed to fail before it was even shot.<br />Fortunately the DVD release includes a director's commentary in which Paul Verhoeven explains it for us one more time and spells it simple: If the plot seems goofy or over-the-top, it's because they based the movie on WWII propaganda films - from the Axis as well as the Allies. The philosophy that underpins the film is \\"War makes fascists of us all.\\"<br />As the cherry on top of this moral message, Starship Troopers delivers pure adventurous fun: huge spaceships exploding, a sappy love-triangle, heroic fights with giant bugs, and Michael Ironside, as cool as ever. The effects are great, the ending is satisfying, and the fake propaganda ads are very funny. The score by Basil Polidouris is also terrific, (although the CD is only 35 min. long) and would even make a great symphony.<br />So it's a win-win movie: you can enjoy a big dumb action spectacular with great special effects, or you can get all intellectual with the satirical sub-text about the human sacrifices that patriotism requires. Either way, this is one of the great science fiction movies, both visually and in terms of ideas. I highly recommend it.<br />(By the way, I'd recommend listening to the director's/writer's commentary even to people who don't like this kind of film - it's the best DVD commentary I've ever heard: very informative and funny, with Verhoeven coming across as a slightly mad, European intellectual-type character.)anda ads are very funny.

0767819594|3.0|At first the movie seem to be good, Sarah Michelle Gellar in the role of Catherine is great, she's a very good actress.  The movie seem to me a bit too much, like the actors performence was in the line to be too much but at first it was okay, it was kind of weird, funny let say cynical but it could had been a good movie.  It gets worst when Sebastian change, he had change way too fast, it was way too clich and after that the movie was too weird and ridiculous.Come on Sebastian had change overnight that impossible to change so fast, fall in love almost right aways with the goody goody, sweet and smart Annette seem so not real.Sebastian get on my nerves lots of time, the actor give a good performance but sometime it was way too much.  Also Annette gets on my nerves for being so goody smart and fall in love so fast with Sebastian that was stupid.  And the one who get on my nerves the most was Ccile, I could not tolerate her and sometime Catherine also gets on my nerves.I don't say it's a bad movie but it could had been way better.  It was too weird, everything went to fast that make it so unbelievable and the end was so stupid, that movie doesn't make any sence.  I think it was just a very cynical movie so it was met to be that way!
0060934913|4.0|As with many things, there is what we see on the surface, and there is what lies underneath.  Here is a book that is sharply written about what happens behind the scenes in a typical restaurant.  If you are faint of heart, you will probably want to skip this one.  However, I _love_ eating out at restaurants and thanks to this book I now have an even deeper appreciation for what goes on there.<br />The author pulls no punches.  Detailed and graphic are his descriptions of the many perils of chopping, slicing and the occasional finger tip lost.  In addition, the frightening description of a experienced chef's hands... covered in burns, scars and callouses from a lifetime of grabbing hot things and slicing a centimeter in the wrong direction... and the author's desire to have hands &quot;like that one day&quot;.<br />A most enjoyable part of the book is the detailing of his first encounter in a high-energy, upscale restaurant kitchen and the pressures that go along with working in this military-like atmosphere.  Do your job quickly and without error or the drill seargent (executive chef) will be all over you in his loudest and meanest tribute to &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot;.  Get this one and read it for laughs and the occasional jaw drop.  I did and don't regret it one bit.
B0000640VO|5.0|The story centers around a shy and &quot;playful&quot; character (Audrey Tautou) who becomes a secret guardian angel for other lonely people. The irony of the situation is that she herself has had a lonely childhood and her adulthood isn't any better.  Nevertheless, she decides to &quot;help&quot; others unseen.  The various episodes to illustrate the transition is well-presented.  There is a certain charm in the narrative style used by the director - in portraying fairly mundane activities with a novel vigor and mysterious charm. Having a wonderful cast does help that cause. In between helping others, the character realizes her own loneliness.  The story then moves into a &quot;chance romantic&quot; realm. <br />The movie is well taken, and is blessed with excellent score and talented cast.  Some slick editing adds to the wonderful spirit of the movie. (Since I dont speak French, the subtitles were critical, though the screenplay and the actors by themselves seem to have conveyed the intent and flow of the story pretty well!).   Wonderful features in the bonus DVD.  It is a must-see.  Overall, sweet and wonderful movie...slow at times with the plot...but never boring.  Arguably one of the best movies of modern times...whether it is a classic - only time can tell

B00003CX8Y|5.0|The DVD release of this film was for me the most anticipated of any movie I have been waiting for, and I am an avid Star Wars fan, with a DVD collection of 300+.  The DVD couldn't have been done better in my opinion.  Great for adults and kids alike.  I don't mind telling you that watching this movie on October 8th brought me to tears, with all the emotion I felt in 1991 coming back like a wave.  The special features are very interesting (unlike some DVD's that you never even watch the special features).  I never knew so much went into an animated film.  It was particularly fun to watch the Disney Exec's talk about their feelings when the film was so widely accepted and praised. Do yourself and your kids a favor, and buy this DVD!! I bought 5 of them, this will be a hard to find item some day as a lot of Disney's work is, I will be prepared.
8401373301|3.0|There is so much that has gone on in Michael Jacksons life it seems impossible for him to write it all down in a book and the fact that Michael still wishes to keep his privacy, it seems like Michael has only expressed the bare minimum of himself in order for him to keep some of his privacy. Even his family members have said that the book is cold and expresses little about Michael. The Magic and the madness is a great book telling the hidden facts about Michael and his family that he wishes to keep hidden. He often tell us something but stops and does not tell us why it happened or how he felt about it happening and being such an emotional person i am sure he was deffinatly not as happy and understanding about everything and everyone who has passed through his career.
B00005JL0I|5.0|You're making a mistake if you compare this film with the Eon Bonds of the Sixties.  You're also making a mistake if you compare it with later spy spoofs, like AUSTIN POWERS.  In fact, it would be a mistake to compare this film to anything.  Approached on its own merits, CASINO ROYALE is an oddball maze of plots, characters, pop-art images, and over-the-top gags that brims with a great sense of life and giddy humor.  Does everything make sense?  No.  Is it something of a jumble?  Yes.  Are all of the gags funny?  I don't think so.  But do any of those things get in the way of this being a thoroughly entertaining romp for anyone with half a sense of humor?  Not at all.  CASINO ROYALE is one of my all-time favorite pick-me-up movies when I'm stuck with the flu at home, and it's a great pleasure to share with friends, especially if you have a soft spot for Sixties culture.  It is silliness for the sake of silliness, designed purely to delight and distract, and, to paraphrase William Saroyan, I can think of few things more noble.<br />I've been looking forward to the DVD release for some time, and have been a little dismayed at the scant information about it from various sites.  Now that I have it, I can say that MGM has treated the film well.  Is it a red-carpet treatment like the Eon Bonds have gotten?  No.  But it is a far better DVD package than we were given with NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN.  The image and color quality have a vibrance fitting a film of the era (and I mean that in a good way), and the sound -- including one of cinema's most distinctive scores, written by Burt Bacharach -- is presented in a newly digitally enhanced 5.1.<br />The extras are what interested me, and (especially for the price) the disc provides some goodies.  One is the original TV version of CASINO ROYALE, shot with Barry Nelson as an Americanized \\"Jimmy Bond.\\"  The other is a NEW making-of featurette with Val Guest discussing the film.  Guest was one of the five directors (!) on the movie, and was charged with trying to tie it all together.  He has some really great behind-the-scenes info, mostly told under footage from the movie.  The featurette is not the best I've seen, but it's hardly the worst, and sheds great light on how this distinctive and idiosyncratic one-of-a-kind picture was made.  I wish they had asked Guest to do a commentary, but I'm not griping.  Considering how little has been written on the making of this genuinely twisted film, the featurette alone is more than welcomed.  There is an original trailer included, and the film is presented letterboxed.<br />For the price, CASINO ROYALE can't be beat.  Its influence on the POWERS series will be obvious to even the most casual viewer, right down to the music.ie, and was charged with trying to tie it all together.

6304681496|4.0|Con Air was a good movie. Good action flick with bloody deaths and a stuffed bunny rabbit. But, throughout the move, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was watching a \\"Die Hard\\" look-alike. The concept of a single guy stranded by a bunch of wackos led by an insane genious, with a good cop and a bad cop, it seemed interesting. Nicholas Cage reminds me of Bruce Willis. John Malkovich reminds me of Alan Rickman, and the 2 cops remind me of the Sergeant and the Lieutenant. Even when things go WAKO and the setting blows up, it seems the same. ...
079073463X|4.0|So Ladyhawk is no Legend, but it makes a great addition to any fantasy movie collection. I was really impressed by Matthew Broderick's performance as the thief, and of course Michelle Pfifer makes a great &quot;Ladyhawk&quot;. This movie has action, Romance, and a little sap, but overall if you are a fantasy lover, you really don't want to miss this one. The only thing negative to say is about the music. Trust me, you will NOT want to run out and buy this soundtrack!
B00005NGSE|5.0|The Scorpions blast out their talent in this concert. The last concert of the Uli-era (sadly, but true) has been recorded in this CD and the result is... I just cannot rate it. Live songs as &quot;All Night Long&quot;, &quot;Dark Lady&quot; and &quot;Fly To The Rainbow&quot; seem to blow up your brain. You can only listen to this record (and the others like Fly To The Rainbow, In Trance, Virgin Killer and Taken By Force) and lament what the Scorps turned out to be after Uli left the band. I consider this and Queen's &quot;Live Killers&quot; the two best live albums ever.
B00006F7S4|5.0|This CD has been on repeat for a solid week.  His soft mix of words, acoustic guitar and mellow beat make for one of the best albums I have heard this year.  It reminds me of a great album by Son Volt with the added characteristics of Beck.  A constant theme with many variations of tone show how Beck is one of our great musical talents. It's a paradigm shift that will lead Beck I hope to more great albums. At first listening to it in my car I couldn't completely hear the layers placed in each song.  Once I had time to bring it in and have a second look on my home audio system it was magical.
B00006SFLV|5.0|From the creators of thirtysomething, Relativity, and the recently cancelled Once and Again, this was a terrific series that aired in 1995 for only one season.  It is about Angela, so genuinely played by Claire Danes, going through a troubled teen year, and about her friends doing the same.  There was so many stories that were so important to the time--one girl had a drinking problem, one boy was gay, Angela just felt awkward through everything, and it all made sense.  But the show got cancelled and left a large void for all who followed it.  With it's resurfacing on MTV a year or so later it caught on again and never let go.  It's fan base has remained and with this DVD finally in release many of us can now throw out our much used, much overused VCR tapes.  If you are a fan of any of the above mentioned shows by Herskovitz and Zwick, the creators, this show will not disappoint.  This is a wonderful, entertaining, thoughtful, satisfying, and brilliant series that deserves a place on your shelf.  I'm so glad that it's come to us on DVD, it's about time......enjoy!!
0385491026|4.0|Wow. This story touched such a nerve as I read, invoking anger, rage, and sorrow for Elaine. And myself! For who among us has not had her own Cordelia? I've had TWO in my life! Argh. It speaks of how girls relate, and how very cruel they can be when they themselves feel weak and are compelled to squash the light in the eyes of others. I was riveted.
0440219078|5.0|This is an amazing story of a world in \\"sameness\\". Jonas thinks about why and how things work, and tries to understand it all. They way that Jonas slowly discovers things that we normally take for granted, i.e.: color, hills/valleys, sunlight, and smell, its all very thrilling and exciting. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a good adventure, or to someone who likes to read about heroes. Jonas definitely has an act of heroism.
0440219078|5.0|Lois Lowry hits another one out of the park with THE GIVER.  She gives us a wonderful taste of how boring life would be if we were all the same and had life decisions made for us. The community is as boring as watching coal turning to diamonds, basically sameness.  <BR>The book was done so well as Lowry out does her self this time while portraying a boy with a lost soul.  Jonas (main character) is growing up in a world of no terror or fear, no hunger.  Until he is given the job assignment as Receiver of Memory, he likes the life.  As he sees all of these wonderful things that were before, he panics.  This is easily understandable.  If I were living in this world of no love or color or memory I would panic if I saw memories of holidays and love.  He is too stressed, so he runs off to a journey of self-discovery.
B00004ZAV3|3.0|I was 11 years old in '64, so I remember all these songs on Top 40 radio.  But I recently caught a 20 year old clerk in my office listening to this CD, and realized this was her only exposure to the Beatles.  (It's not as if she has Abbey Road, Revolver or the White Album in her collection.)  And I realized that the Beatles (unlike the Stones in their recent '40 Licks' double CD) can't be appreciated by the young music fan from this 'Beatles 1' CD alone.  THERE HAS TO BE A FOLLOW-UP.  It may even be safe to say that some of the best Beatles tracks were never released as singles for the radio.  So for that young 20 year old girl in my office, can't some overpayed record executive release a BEATLES 2 (the BEST OF THE BEATLES) as a follow-up?  Guaranteed it will be as strong a seller as BEATLES 1.   And while you're at it, please choose my selections:         1. I Saw Her Standing There   2.  Rock'n'Roll Music   3. Please Please Me    4.  Twist &amp; Shout     5.  This Boy     6. All My Lovin'    7. She's a Woman            8. You've Got to Hide Your Love Away   9. I'm Down  10. Michelle 11. Girl    12. Norwegian Wood  13. Rain   14. Here There &amp; Everywhere   15. Taxman   16. Tomorrow Never Knows              17. Strawberry Fields Forever    18. Across the Universe       19. With a Little Help from my Friends  20.

B00005J9M1|5.0|The greatest mystery about this album (to me anyway) is what people like so much about &quot;Go West&quot;. I don't think it's anywhere near Pet Shop Boys' best work and certainly not the best piece of songwriting Neil and Chris ever produced.<br />Apart from that I really love this CD. Song like &quot;Can You Forgive Her?&quot;, &quot;A Different Point Of View&quot; and &quot;One And One Make Five&quot; really get the pace up and other songs like &quot;The Theatre&quot; and &quot;To Speak Is A Sin&quot; can get you thinking. <br />Also, I think this album produced one of the most memorable and typical Pet Shop Boys lyrics: &quot;You don't believe a single word I say; if I said black was white you'd say it was grey&quot;. Don't be fooled by the horrible orange CD-case, this CD is GREAT!
B00005R23S|5.0|FAntastic performance. Man, you can see the band is clearly enjoying themselves, otherwise they should win the OScar! Drummer Max Weinberg's enthusiasm is breathtaking.<br />I'm still catching my breath after watching this marvellous double DVD. The Boss's voice still is strong and emotional, even at 52. VAn Zandt is charismatic. Nils adds a lot to the band.<br />How can a band put out such an emotional  performance night after night on tour is something incredible. Yes, tehy're being paid for that, but that's not the point. THey could get the job done without sweating so much and nobody would notice it.<br />I have only two negative comments: the version of THE RIVER is too much watered down, too much sugar, too much slow. I hated it. Secondly, The Boss really does not know how to play a guitar solo. Horrible ones he did here.

B00001NFCY|2.0|Creed's first album, my own prison, was great. It was an amazing CD, and gets a 4 on my list. But...Human Clay just didn't offer me much. Sure, 'Higher' was great when it first came out, but now it's so annoying I want to break the record in half. Most songs are dull, and the same, and didn't catch my interest. Thankfully, Creed's new Weathered Album is great.
6304362498|5.0|Orwell's 1984 is a masterpiece of dystopian literature. A truly frightening look at a world that very well could have been and may still be yet to come. Michael Radford's movie is a nearly perfect adaptation, so much so that if you haven't read the book, it would probably help in understanding the complex nature of this movie. If you have read the book, you are in for a treat as the movie literally brings to life a perfect window view of the world described by Orwell. <br />The movie, along with the book, is a bleak look at a world dominated by the ultimate extreme of totalitarian regimes. Every aspect of people's daily life is controlled and monitored by the ever present INGSOC (English Socialist Party) and its masthead, Big Brother. The story is set in a decimated but recognizable London and revolves around the central character of Winston Smith. The basic premise is the will of one man to maintain his humanity against the overwhelming force of an inhuman system. I will avoid saying more about the story except to warn that if you are looking for light entertainment, this movie is not for you. <br />In short, this movie is brilliant in it own right, with riveting performances by both Richard Burton and William Hurt. The sets, cinematography and direction bring to life a fictional world in such perfect detail that I have no doubt that Orwell himself would have been astonished. Not since BladeRunner has a world been so convincingly portrayed in a movie. This movies imagery will haunt you and its story will stun you. 1984 is mesmerizing, terribly disturbing and utterly believable.
B000069CWE|2.0|Call me evil but I think that because of the unwanted publicity LP has earned from MTV, TRL, and radio, they must be punishing these so-called fans that listen to them because they will be considered cool [with this \\"album\\"]. I really like Linkin Park and thoroughly enjoyed their debut, but all this radio overplay, excessive (perhaps unauthorized) singles for radio, and MTV video play annoys me. Personally, I don't mind hearing the songs on the radio (I don't listen to it that much) however. I really don't know if the band only cares about money, but this might make me think otherwise...<br />Here's the deal. \\"Reanimation\\" is a truly awful remix album with about one good song. The songs from \\"Hybyrd Theory\\" have basically been turned into non-threatening; hip-hopish songs. Take the \\"Points Of Authority\\" remix for example. Say that somehow, they killed its song structure. It would destroy the song completely. Now, as some of you know, in the cult-movie \\"Re-Animation\\", the person had to put pieces of the dead body back together. If the band tried to put it back together, which they did, it would sound vastly different. Now when I say different, I mean that it sounds reduced, unlistenable, and boring. You see: pieces of the bridge are missing; the guitars are completely absent and other problems. Also, the effect of decay after it was killed gave it a different sound (vastly inferior to the original in excellent condition I might add). A bad techno one at that. In short, if they just wounded it, it would sound the way it is. Like the dead person back to life, the changes would take getting used to. If you can get used to the re-animated song, fine, but sometimes it just doesn't work your way. Same with the other songs (some of which with rap in them); they destroy the other songs with mind-numbingly awful structure. However, the Crawling remix (with Staind front man Aaron Lewis) is great. I like his voice a lot. <br />Do you Get it? Re-Animated! Why the hell would anyone want to bastardize their own songs????? Well, I think I have an answer: PUNISHMENT. Yeah, I say all the bad things about this and as I said, I don't know if they care more about money then their music, but all of the one-star reviewers that don't like this are missing the point. Remember, this is my opinion: Because lots of TRL watchers just bought \\"Hybyrd Theory\\" for the singles which they were forced to listen to hundreds of times, Linkin Park released this album. They kinda thought that it would sell millions since they were so popular. Millions would suffer the effect of these horrible songs for punishment. C'mon! This album is so horrible that they had to know what they were doing! We all know that with the small minds of a teenybopper, they have to have some kind of music that they secretly hate. They are being punished. And if this becomes the most popular album of the year, they might think it's so horrible, they'll tell their friends (who only like him/her cuz she bought a certain, popular album) and lose them and slowly become forgotten and hated for their slight beliefs. Good. They might have succeeded.<br />Get this if you want; I really can't say that I recommend it to anyone. Just get their debut if you haven't already heard it by now (which I doubt). That said, If they can't scrape up another album soon, I think that there is no hope for you. The music is definitely horrible. Where does this leave you? TRUST COMPANY! They are similar! Get them! Much better if you complain about Linkin Park not being heavy. Peace...
B000002JSP|4.0|You have to give Page credit for pushing the boundaries.  The fellows were old and had long since fallen out of favor with the fickle music fans of the 1970's. But, at least it wasn't the 'Miss You' disco tripe Mick Jagger passed off as music.<BR> There isn't a one of you that hasn't leaped all over your bedroom, strumming your air guitar to the opening riff of 'In The Evening'. <BR> \\"Oh! OH! I need your love!\\" Plant just let's it all hang out on this track, on 'I'm Gonna Crawl', and they funk it up with 'South Bound Suarez' a underrated gem.<BR> Is it the long overdue second coming of Led Zeppelin's first album ? No. But for their age, for 1979, it's a classic offering. And, it beats out anything the Stone's have offered up since 1985.

B000002JR8|5.0|By far the best southern offering from quite possibly the worlds greatest metal band. The possesed vocals of frontman Phil Anselmo command attention to his agony and strife.

B00005Q4CS|5.0|Have you ever seen a trailer that looks so cool that it gets your heart pumping, but when you see the film, it's a let down? Requiem for a Dream is just like one of those fast paced trailers, all the way through the film!<br />Of course this is a very depressing, upsetting film about addiction, be it to heroin, diet pills, or television. If you like your films upbeat, stay clear from this film. You'll hate it and curse all those who told you it was great. But if you are a film lover looking for a movie that is masterful and powerful in whatever message it gives, no matter what negative emotions it can create, this one is for you. It takes you right along for the ride as the film's central characters begin to have hope for the good life, then forces you to hold on as their lives take the wrong turn and hopelessly spin out of control into utter despair.<br /> The beautiful stylistic choices in this film are endless. From the quick editing to simulate the rush of getting high or the characters insanity, to the heart-pumping music adding to the editing, to the symbolic use of fades, cuts and dissolves to pack in layer upon layer of meaning, this film is a complete masterpiece. It was one of those rare films that gave me the chills of amazement all the way through, the thought &quot;My God, this is an awesome film&quot; running through my mind non-stop. I found it so amazing; I could watch it over and over despite its despair-filling mood. Its genius is enough to distract my emotions away from the doom. There's so much to find in Requiem for a Dream!<br />To any film buff, this one demands multiple viewings to appreciate all the layers of ingenuity. Look past the so-called &quot;gimmicky&quot; editing... it has a reason it's fast paced and stylized, and it's not so it &quot;looks cool&quot; to the MTV crowd. This gets my highest recommendation. A masterpiece on all levels!
0375414053|5.0|\\"I Don't Know How She Does It\\" is the blackly comic tale of a woman juggling motherhood, a job and a husband while feeling she's failing at everything.

Hank had 38 Billboard Hits from 1947-1953 all but a couple are right here on one 40 track CD. All are great.  The greatest compliment one can pay an album is to state that the more you play it, the BETTER it sounds.I've had this one over 10 years and it improves with age! No one gets to the soul of country like Hank.If you like traditional country, Hank is the grandaddy of it all. If you've heard of Hank. but don't know what the fuss is about- you will.
B00006JL1Z|5.0|What can anyone say......bloody brilliant!! If you are new to the Fleetwood Mac experience, this is probably the only CD of the band's that you'll need. It compiles the greatest music of this band's work, and every one of the tracks can be listened to over and over again. One thing that really suprised my was the quality of the live performances. If anything, I thought the tunes sounded better live than they do pre-recorded!! My absolute favourite is 'I'm So Afraid' because of the amazing guitar solo at the end. I find it difficult to believe anyone couldn't like Fleetwood Mac's music and this is the most complete collection on the market. A Five Star Work Of Genius!!
B0000026VZ|3.0|I feel sad to be giving a Toto greatest-hits collection a mere three stars when it features classics like &quot;Africa,&quot; &quot;I Won't Hold You Back&quot; and &quot;Georgy Porgy,&quot; but the album itself just doesn't flow as a piece.  The newly recorded songs give me an itchy skip-button finger, and one of my favorites, &quot;Stranger In Town,&quot; has been omitted.  Come on, guys, you are capable of doing much, much better than this.
B00004NRWH|5.0|I will be purchasing this album and any other album they will have. I think they're completely different than the music that already exists! They know how to rock and I believe they're lyrical geniuses! I'm absolutely in love w/'Silver Side Up' so regardless of the critics out there, I'm a huge fan of their music. Nickelback won't disappoint, satisfying your hunger for real music and complete rock!
0441008356|4.0|Other reviewers have more thoroughly explained the premise of the story, I will only add that I thoroughly enjoyed the tone of this book. I wish someone would make sci-fi movies that feel like this book does. Instead we get shallow action romps that always involve a monster loose aboard a ship...
0788811355|5.0|After the badly burned Hungarian patient Count Laszlo de Almasy (Ralph Fiennes) is pulled from the wreckage of a plane, he is taken to a military hospital with no memory of his past.  During the journey through Italy, his Canadian nurse Hanna (Juliette Binoche) insists on staying behind in a monastery to prevent further injury and discomfort to her patient.  While secluded in the countryside a different world with new meaning unfolds for both of them.  The Count flashes back to recall his life as an archeologist on a map making expedition, where he meets and falls in love with a married English woman, Katherine (Kristin Scott Thomas).  During his stay, he slowly regains the memories of their life together.<br />Meanwhile, Hanna who has lost a lover and a best friend in the war, meets Kip (Naveen Andrews), a Sikh bomb disposal expert, and she becomes romantically involved.<BR>  <BR>Anthony Minghella, director of The English Patient, remarkably brings cultural diversity, compassion, and emotion all together in this film.  The cinematography captured by John Seale shows not only the beauty of the desert and its unknown secrets, but also the coldness of the villages during the war.  After viewing this film, it leaves no doubt to why this film won nine Academy Awards and Best Film in 1996.
B000002U82|5.0|If only life consisted of infinite time to lay around and listen to Dark Side of the Moon.  It has spoken to generations, and will continue to remain an accurate reflection of the human condition for as long as Mankind walks this Earth.  Pink Floyd rivals Tolstoy, Dostoevsky and Hemingway (all of whom I have read) as the most inspirational artist(s) in history.
0553062182|3.0|This is a wonderful book, but anyone who knows about Asperger's Syndrome sees that *every single characteristic* described in this book is typical of Asperger's.  I guess the author either a) doesn't know about Asperger's Syndrome or b) is in denial that that is really her issue.  That said, the descriptions are clear, the coping techniques are helpful, and her writing style is clear in describing the issues that can overwhelm a HSP/Aspie.
B0000029DD|5.0|Rarely has an album impacted me the first time I listened to it as Grace has done.   He is the culmination of everything that the music of the 90's should have been.  He is sorrowful without being depressing and graceful without being pretentious, while hitting every note in between.   He somehow makes straight rock original again.  A  genuine album.
B000007T1M|5.0|My friend gave me this song, heard it and was in love by the first two words. System of a Down is awesome. For some reason they remind me of a harder, Tea Party. Maybe it's the cultural type thing they got going on in their music. But the lead singers voice is to die for and just listening to the beauty, it's just too good.<br />I bought this cd, after listening to Phsyco, and Prison Song. I can't help but love these guys, their videos... WOW!<BR>Anyways, Peephole is my all time favorite, but all the songs on this cd are good. All of them, not just some of them all of them.<br />System of a Down is orginal, I don't think there is too many guys like this out there. I'd say try these guys out, they are sensational! This Cd is awesome and I can't wait for more.
B00005YXZH|5.0|It's easy enough to see from the wide-ranging opinions on YHF that this is a complex record. Anyone who wants to form a worthwhile opinion on it acknowledges that it needs to be digested. That said, this is one reason why YHF deserves five stars. Wilco is not afraid to challenge listeners, and in these days of least-common-denominator musical swill, this is an extremely brave position to take.<br />The other reason that the record deserves five stars is because the songs are superb. My initial reaction to the record would've been to give it three stars for solid songs, knocking them a couple for the \\"indulgence\\" of all the weird sounds on the record. After a few listens, I was prepared to raise it to four as the songs began to emerge from under the layers of noise and distortion. Now, having listened to it probably 20-30 times, the things that once disturbed me as interfering with the songs have know fully integrated themselves within the fabric of the recording. For instance, the apparently disconnected piano at the end of \\"Ashes of American Flags\\" - if you listen carefully, you'll hear it's the chords from \\"Heavy Metal Drummer,\\" the next track. So the effect is like fine-tuning a radio until the full signal kicks in. Another example is at the end of \\"Poor Places,\\" as the wall of squawl builds up with the disembodied female voice intoning \\"yankee hotel foxtrot\\" drones on, you can still hear the piano mournfully thumping away on the chord like a pulse. The effect ends up sounding something like the end of \\"A Day in the Life.\\" And once the strange ending has settled itself into your brain, the craftsmanship for the rest of the song (and it is a drop-dead gorgeous song) becomes that much more clear. And the songs are really that good. I thought that Being There was Wilco's version of Exile on Main Street. Well, YHF is like the White Album. Brave, experimental, sublime, and totally addictive all at once.<br />Yankee Hotel Foxtrot is full of quirky little moments that really deserve careful listening. Your first impression may be that they just threw \\"all that extra junk\\" in there to be artsy, but there was obviously a lot of craft and consideration put in to the sonic textures of the album. It is well worth the time to find the beauty amongst the sonic chaos on this magnificent record.
B000002J1M|5.0|This album can't be described.  It's simply the best progressive rock album ever recorded.<br />&quot;Supper's Ready&quot; is the greatest piece of music ever written.  I'd rank Beethoven's 9th, first movement, as the second-best.  The first movement of the 9th is awesome -- it basically created the Romantic era in music.  But &quot;Supper's Ready&quot; is better.<br />If you've never listened to Old Genesis before, you might want to warm up by listening to Selling England By the Pound first.  Sadly, Foxtrot was not recorded using very high-grade equipment.  What a tragedy....
B0000542D2|5.0|I am a 16 year old beatle fan. A lot of adults are under this impression that because i did not grow up in the 60's i don't know anything about this amazing group. stupid.serious junk. i have every beatle cd, all their record LP's (yes i have a record player...no not my parents, mine!) i have read the beatles anthology 3 times, the beatles recording sessions twice, the beatles gear once, Shout! once...do you get the point? i love this band a lot, and anyone that can stick their face in this site and make derrogetory comments about 4 of the greatest, funny, innovative young men of our time should not be writing reviews because your comments are not welcome here. go in a beatles hater chat room or something, but stay away from here. amazon.com does not need your worthless comments taking up their precious space.
B00006JL1Z|5.0|Oh gosh, this is one of many Fleetwood Mac compilations (others: Greatest Hits &amp; The Chain Box Set), however, it is probably one of the more comprehensive yet.  Not only is the quality absolutely amazing, but the setlist includes the original studio version of &quot;Silver Springs&quot; and live versions (from 1997's The Dance) of &quot;Big Love,&quot; &quot;I'm So Afraid,&quot; and &quot;Go Insane.&quot;  In addition, songs like &quot;Storms,&quot; &quot;Second Hand News,&quot; &quot;Monday Morning,&quot; &quot;Sisters of the Moon,&quot; &quot;World Turning,&quot; and &quot;Songbird,&quot; made the cut and sound excellent!<br />This enhanced edition rocks even more because of the documentary footage included on the first disc.  Yes, we finally get a glimpse into the recording process of Mick, John, Lindsey, and Stevie recording for their 2003 album!  It's so much fun to watch, especially if you're one of the millions of fans out there. I recommend this right behind Rumours -- it's absolutely essential...and ROCK IS BACK!
B000063DI9|5.0|Although \\"Somewhere in Time\\" is my personal favorite, this one comes so close to surpassing it; however, if you're going to label the 'best' album, it might as well be this one or \\"Number of the Beast.\\"<br />Unlike most albums released, especially nowadays, this one's got NO fillers whatsoever.  Although I wasn't impressed with \\"The Prophecy,\\" it still holds up well... so yes, it's good.<br />You've got a whole album's worth of great songs, including \\"Moonchild,\\" \\"Infinite Dreams,\\" \\"Can I Play With Madness,\\" \\"The Clairvoyant,\\" and \\"Evil That Men Do.\\"  If you judged Maiden's albums by complexity, this one definitely gets #1.  To me, the album is unpredictable and a pleasure to listen to.<br />I find it funny that this was claimed as the band's \\"sell-out\\" because they used GUITAR synthesizers (NOT keyboards!) yet a lot of Maiden fans claim every album sounds the same.  I tend to agree that they all are very similar, but it shows the band's loyalty to the fans.  Maiden's always about heavy metal.<br />This album is a must-have for any metalhead.  This makes you wonder how Maiden's direction would've gone to had Adrian Smith not departed; nevertheless, we got \\"Brave New World,\\" another great album.
B00006JL1Z|4.0|Save Me, Tango in the Night, That's Alright are not part of this album. Instead we get No Questions  Asked, Skies the Limit and Paper Doll-Yuck! Save Me was their only hit from Behind the Mask and it's not here. I hate when  artists do this. If they're gonna say the &quot;Very Best of&quot; it better be. It must be a royalty thing, or a marketing strategy. Hell, Stevie put Whole Lotta Trouble, Desert Angel and  Loves a Hard  Game to Play on her Greatest Hits and they weren't even hits. She managed to leave off Nightbird and After the Glitter Fades. I was upset. Seven Wonders wasn't on  the Macs first greatest hits.<br />However, this still  manages to be a great album only because their worst  songs  are a level higher than most artists best.
B000065U1N|5.0|I know some people connected with the event and this is very similar to the way it actually went down. Amazing.
B00005JL5S|5.0|This movie is so funny that it cracks me up badly.<BR> All ya should really go see it when it comes out.<BR> I don't need to see it cause I got my own movie.<BR> This movie is so so so funny...really...........<BR> One of the best Chinese Sport movie i've ever seen..<BR>    peace out all ya.....RI_boi
B00006HBUA|4.0|A fan of the cartoon since childhood, I have to admit that I saw the movie with mixed anticipation.  I wanted to call it a horrible nightmare, to hate it.<br />But instead, I found myself thoroughly enjoying my time watching Mystery Inc back in action!  Freddy Prinze Jr and Sarah Michelle Gellar star along side Matthew Lilliard and Linda Cardellini as the infamous Scooby gang: Fred, Daphne, Shaggy, and Velma.  Each of the actors puts forth a great performance, from Velma's intelligence to the almost perfect sound of Shaggy's voice.  And Scooby is excellent as a CGI character who interacts with the rest of the cast remarkably.<br />This movie has a few tongue in cheek jokes, a lot of great laughs, and some stellar performances.  It's well worth checking out and the audio commentary by the cast is enjoyable as well!  Check this out and you will enjoy it!
B00006JL1Z|5.0|2002 is proving to be a popular one for 2-CD anthologies by classic pop artists, including the Stones, Sly Stone, Santana, etc.  (not to mention 31 Elvis hits crammed onto ONE disc).  Two discs seems like a happy medium for artists who have too many highlights to fit onto one CD, yet who want to provide an economical overview for those who don't want to splurge for a multi-disc boxed set (or don't have that much time time to listen).  The 36-track, 2-CD THE VERY BEST OF FLEETWOOD MAC lives up to its title.  Granted, in most cases these sets rely on product recycled yet again, but that doesn't necessarily mean diminishing returns: the new sets tend to offer improvements both selection-wise and with the remastering.    <br />If you are a newcomer thinking of buying RUMOURS (1977), instead why not throw in a few extra dollars and purchase this set.  You'll find not only 9 of 11 tracks from that album, but also the majority of the 1975 disc FLEETWOOD MAC that introduced this lineup, almost everything you'd need from later studio albums, key non-lp tracks such as SILVER SPRINGS, and three inspired live cuts from their 1997 reunion broadcast.  Every track from their prior GREATEST HITS CD is heard here (albeit one in an alternative version).  All but four cuts are the album versions rather than single edits, and only a couple of the tracks might inspire debate about their designation as being representative of FMac at their \\"very best.\\"  The multimedia content covers a lot of ground, from a discography and song lyrics to a documentary and other rarities that are worth checking out, even if you're a casual fan.  In all, if you just want one collection by this group, VERY BEST is the one to own!
B00006JL1Z|5.0|This new double CD collection of one of the most popular supergoups of all time is a very nice, if not terrifically innovative, compilation of most of their best songs--36 in all. Almost all of the Rumours album is here (9 of 11 songs) along with generous helpings of their 1975 self-titled white album, 1979's Tusk, 1982's Mirage, and my personal favorite--1987's Tango in the Night. There are also a few tracks from their Greatest Hits collection (the 2 new songs recorded for that effort), one from the hard to find Box set, and three of Lindsey's cuts from 1997's live The Dance.  Unfortunately there are no pre-1975 early Mac classics like \\"Oh Well\\", \\"Another Woman\\", or \\"Spare Me a Little of Your Love\\". That aside, the remasters of what is here are amazing.<BR> Everything sounds great--crisp and clean, very clear recordings. Another nice feature is that there are a few singles versions included,most notably the wonderful Christine McVie's \\"Over My Head\\", which are slightly different from their album counterparts.<BR> It would have been nice to see a few of their catchy solo hits-- particularly Christine's \\"Got a Hold on Me\\", Stevie's \\"Edge of Seventeen\\" or \\"Stand Back\\", and Lindsey's \\"Trouble\\". But since it is a group retrospective and they have so many songs these omissions are understandable.<BR> If you are an avid FM fan you may already have most of these recordings, but there are one or two collector's items that make it worthwhile--for example the original studio version of Stevie's terrific \\"Silver Springs\\" and her Box Set tune \\"Paper Doll\\". So there is something for everyone here, especially the casual Mac fan who wants a cohesive set of their work all in one place. Diehards like myself who can't get enough of their music will enjoy it too.<BR> A great new gift from a great old group.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|I have owned &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; on VHS for 10 years now, in the form of the special collector's edition. It's been watched more than ever though, since the birth of my daughter, who is now 2. One of hers and our favorite movies, we saw the Special Edition IMAX at the beginning of this year. Needless to say, we were excited to get the DVD at its release. We put it in the DVD player, turned it on, and the first thing my daughter said was, &quot;Ooh, look at all the colors!&quot; It's amazing to see this film on DVD and in letterbox. The colors are amazing and the letterbox makes every scene have something new. I HIGHLY recommend this DVD.
B0000636UN|5.0|I loved Sheryl Crow's new cd.  Whenever I get in the car I put that cd in and I just tap my foot and sing along with the song.  Her hottest two songs are Steve McQueen and Soak up the Sun.  I recommend this cd for a foot tapping good time!
B00006IU73|5.0|This is perfection. I need to be careful to contain my enthusiasm about this album or my review will be nothing but a maudlin glorification heavy on superlatives but low on actual, uh, 'reviewing'. But...this is a masterpiece. That's enough for me, but I will go on...<br />It is a concept album, which seems to be trendy all of a sudden. I barely even care when I hear a band I like is making a concept album these days, although it used to get me excited. _In Absentia_ gets the thumbs-up though because the story is actually VERY good. The chilling tale could entirely be peripheral depending on the listener, but to those interested it will find it is an integral part of this powerful record. Telling the story of a child growing up and becoming a serial killer, _In Absentia_ is dark thematically and musically. Bandleader Steven Wilson's lyrics have never blown me away until now. This album deals with some unpleasant subject matter, all rendered with great poetry.<br />The music, likewise, is remarkable -- and then some. \\"Blackest Eyes\\" is the first song on the album -- an almost childlike reflection of the future psycho's condition, and the blend of heavy riffs and plaintive acoustic strumming resonates the protagonist's disposition. When I say \\"heavy riffs\\" there, I seriously mean heavy - the crushing power chord strikes and monster distortion reminded me more of Tool than Porcupine Tree. But the song slips perfectly into the familiar, exquisite sonics of PT as well.<br />This dichotomy is seen elsewhere in the album as well, perhaps most notably on \\"Gravity Eyelids\\", with its harrowing build-up to an evil, Opethian guitar riff. \\"Wedding Nails\\" is a stunningly executed and composed progressive metal instrumental. \\"Strip the Soul\\" is gritty and punishing and enfeebling. Wilson definitely integrated a much heavier sensibility in this album, which surprised me as a longtime PT who had never heard the band do anything like this. It also blew my mind because it was done so well. And yet, countervailing this heavy side are some of the most gorgeous, sublime moments ever recorded - by this band or any other. \\"Heartattack in a Lay by\\" is a creepy, lonely nocturne that makes me shiver without fail every time I hear it. \\"Trains\\" is pop perfection and has not one, but two melting guitar solos. The finale, \\"Collapse the Light into Earth\\", is transcendental in beauty with string arrangements by XTC's David Gregory.<br />What's more? Vocal harmonies rivaled only by Spock's Beard, an impossibly good production, spine-tingling guitar solos, and a godly new drummer (Gavin Harrison, aka MASTER).<br />The production is freakin' amazing. Just amazing - probably the best I've heard. The texture, clarity, effects, power, stereo mixing, and inventive recording techniques make this album pure bliss to hear. And that's before you even put the headphones in - then you discover a whole new world of aural magnificence. Steven Wilson's studio wizardry on this record has me drooling to think what he has done for the next two Opeth albums (_Deliverance_ and _Damnation_).<br />_In Absentia_ blew me away from the first listen, which is not really uncommon. New things are exciting, after all. However, each subsequent listen only enhanced the intensity, never threatening to dilute it with the passing of time. This is utterly divine songcraft matched by almost nothing, and time will only make it greater.well.

B00006JL1Z|5.0|I've been a huge Fleetwood Mac fan for 20 years, so of course I'm going to think this CD is great.  Here's a bit more information for those of you thinking about buying this set.  All the songs were remastered by Bill Inglot, who does most of the remastering for compilation CDs by Rhino.  The sound quality here is definitely better than on the currently available original CDs.  (When will they be remastered?  It's about time!)  However, it's not the revelation that the sound quality is on Elvis' new hits CD.  I'm sure every fan will quibble a bit over what's included and what's not.  It's not a straight greatest hits CD, as the version of &quot;Big Love&quot; included is the live version from &quot;The Dance&quot; and not the studio version from &quot;Tango In The Night&quot;.  Also missing is &quot;Save Me&quot;, their last top 40 hit before regrouping in 1997.  A bonus for singles fans is the inclusion of four single edits never before on CD, I believe:  &quot;Rhiannon&quot;, &quot;Over My Head&quot;, &quot;Think About Me&quot;, and &quot;Sisters Of The Moon&quot;.  Both of the hits from &quot;The Dance&quot;, &quot;Silver Springs&quot; and &quot;Landslide&quot; are here in their original studio versions, which can be a plus or minus depending on how you feel about those versions.  Also added are lots of photos, detailed liner notes and track information - all done in the great Rhino tradition.  All in all, a thorough compilation of songs by one of the greatest bands of the last 40 years.  How can I not give it five stars?
0689829590|4.0|This is a very imaginative and educational book that also touches upon a father's love for his child. Very calming illustrations as well. A great concept.
B00005JKWI|5.0|This is an action packed movie, with 5 main action scenes.  It's kind of like blade, except it's got a story and it takes place in a different city.  Prague....wtf.  Any who, Wesley snipes does an impressive take on blade this time, putting his martial arts skill to the props, and having many fierce sword/gun battles.  In the first blade, their was 3 gun battles.  In this they're are only 2.  but they other 3 are pure simple martial arts death.  so if u want action, get this movie. but make sure u get Blade before getting this.
B0000009TT|5.0|Finally a legitimate release on one of uncle Frank's most adventurous projects. Lather (pronounced Leather) was the<BR>famous 4 LP set that Frank's former label at the time Warner Bros. refused to release in '77. Well as we all know the rest is history.<BR>Frank brought LP's to a Pasadena radio station and told the audience to get their tape recorders ready and tape the records!<BR>Well, lawsuits went back and forth and eventually snippets of the original 4 LP set turned up on later FZ records Zappa In<BR>New York, Sleep Dirt, Studio Tan &amp; Orchestral Favorites from '78 &amp; '79. now we have the entire 4 LP set on a snazzy<BR>little 3 CD set including 4 recently unearthed tracks from over the years related to the original LP project. These 4 oddities<BR>&quot;Regyptian Strut ('93),&quot; Leather Goods,&quot; Revenge Of The Knick Knack People&quot; &amp; Time Is Money&quot; are the bonus cuts that<BR>close out the set bringing the total playing experience to 3 hours! Exceptional separate liner notes by both Gail Zappa and<BR>Simon Prentis document the history of this missing masterpiece with articulate insight. Digitally overhauled for another excellent<BR>sonic blowout!
B000056BOR|4.0|Pleasant and harmless comedy which has some very funny moments indeed, about an unemployed small town girl in New York (Doris Day), who accidentally meets millionaire man-of-the-world (Cary Grant) and falls in love with him.<br />This film belongs to that kind of late `50s and early `60s glamorous chic fluff that was being made at Universal Studios at that time, with the aforementioned Day, Rock Hudson, James Garner, Tony Randall, et al.<br />Gig Young and Audrey Meadows give fine support as friends of the starring couple. John Astin (future Gomez Addams of the well-remembered 1960s TV series \\"Addams Family\\") is very funny as an extremely unpleasant character who's after Doris Day, and Richard \\"Dick\\" Sargent (later to be \\"Bewitched's\\" second Darrin Stephens) has a nice bit as a honeymooner in Bermuda.
B000000IRY|5.0|Originally released in '77 I never quite got off on this release. But now I know why... The problem had resided in the original<BR>  releases transfer. No matter how I tried to dig this release on all the PGD formats I gave up until now. Mofi has totally over<BR> hauled this album and as a ULTRADISC II gold CD I can finally hear why I was totally disappointed in the first place. First all<BR> the vocals have perfect clarity listen to the harmonies on &quot;Wonderful Tonight&quot;. The guitars have crunch and a slight surrealistic<BR>airy quality to them checkout &quot;Cocaine&quot; and once again &quot;Wonderful Tonight&quot;. Once again the rhythm section is full tilt and rocks<BR>  like a good old garage band having a jolly workout. The best examples of this are &quot;Lay Down Sally&quot; &amp; &quot;The Core&quot;. All the<BR>                 original art has been restored and the cover folds out to poster size.
B00006JL1Z|5.0|Unless you've attended one of their concerts, you haven't really heard Fleetwood Mac until this set was released, with the exception of 'The Dance' live album. This has to be one of the best remastering jobs yet. The first disc is also enhanced with videos and interviews. Most of their hits are included and a few that have never been released on an album before but were released as singles. I've beem waiting for this compilation for a long time and it was well worth the wait. If you can, listen to these discs in surround sound. The guitar and drums will blow you away. A must have for Fleetwood Mac fans.
B00004RFFU|5.0|This is an excellent movie. The acting is great and so is the dialogue. The storyline is multilayered and the movie keeps you wanting more and keeps you interested. Overall: EXCELLENT.
0375414053|5.0|What a relief to see a portayal of a woman whose career matters to her (a lot) who loves her family (a lot) and so artfully explores all of the ambivalence the combination of the two creates. My only regret-- I've been up until 3:00am two night in a row to finish it.  Tired-- but GREAT BOOK!
B00005JL2O|4.0|Austin Powers is back.  I thought that the new episode is funny with a well thought screenplay. I recommend it to all A.P. fans.
B00006F7S4|4.0|I don't own any Nick Drake, or Nick Lowe, or Lou Reed albums. & I don't see myself picking any up at any time in the future. So, I had no real conception of how this record would sound. 'Cept that, \\"it's like Mutations\\". I own that.<br />Let me say then: this is not Mutations. Certainly, though, on the surface, it seems to dovetail with that '98 \\"toss-off\\". The producer is the same. Beck plays mostly guitar, whereas on Odelay & Vultures he dabbled on guitar, bass, synth, drums, samples, etc. (Yes, he gets a coupla synth credits here, but this is thoroughly Beck-in-stripped-down mode.) It is a low-key release following an urban freakout. Etc.<br />But whereas Mutations had its excitements, though in particular Tropicalia (a good song no matter what the hardcore tropicalist fans & Beck junkies alike say), Sea Change is as much a downer as anything from the Leonard Cohen catalog. & unlike, say, the Songs of Leonard Cohen, it's not as peppy instrumentally. <br />Save for the end of track 10, where Beck & band do wild out on their tools. <br />I think the real comparison to this album, then, is Air's 10000 Hz Legend. & if you liked that, which probably you didn't (since very few did), then you'll like this. Each album is almost strictly ambient textures. Vocals drift in, & out; instrument striking is infrequent, & repetitive; the lyrics are sombre. Both feature Beck.<br />& most importantly, I think, neither is irono-contrarian in any way. This music, be it How does it make you feel? from 10kHzLeg or Paper Tiger from this, is straight from the heart. & so, frail as ever. <br />& a sadsack like me enjoys that.
B00005JKDR|5.0|What can I say about MONSTERS INC? Probably it is the best children's movie I have seen all year.  This movie is very funny and a big recommendation to the whole family.  I gave it five stars because I just think it is great!
B00000K31Q|5.0|I would highly reccomend this movie to anyone. It is filled with very clever portrayals of the issues that face teenagers. I really liked the fathers attitude toward the dating of his two daughters. I saw a little of my own father in him. This movie is also great for a family to watch together as the content is child friendly.
B0000399WI|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie, because I felt like I could relate to the way some of the characters were feeling. They made you feel like you were experiencing the same things they were going through, which means alot to me.
B000067CPX|5.0|It's always a treat to hear the mellow songs on a Chili Pepper album.  When I first heard By The Way, I wasn't sure what to make of it.  With repeated listenings, the music simply flows around you and through you and it's a beautiful feeling.  I think the band has reached a very cool level of maturity with their music and I'm so glad I can turn my kids on to this great band!
0316666343|1.0|Alright, for those of you who as me are not the avid reader,this comment is for you. I am still forcing myself to finish this book,that I started a month ago,yes can u believe it. I thought, best seller, sounds iteresting,something different other than Nicholas Sparks (I adore his books), well I believe last I put down the book I was on pg. 90 and it still hasn't grasped my attention. I am very dissapointed in it. I am determined to finish it though,a promise I made before I can start reading the new Nicholas Sparks book, LOL. My opinion so far, waste of time and money, fortunately the book was a gift for me.  :-)
0671510991|5.0|Dr. Kissinger takes us on a wonderful ride through modern (last 300 years) history and tells of the workings of diplomats and heads of states behind the scenes.  Yes, we know that a war happened, but what were the diplomats saying to each other before the first shots were fired?  Why did this country form an alliance with that country?  Did they agree with each other (United States and England) or did they need each other to put down an enemy that was worse (England and Russia vs. Germany in WWII)?<br />This book goes beyond the typical history book and explains the strategy of diplomats when confronted with another power.  It also explores the differences between a collective security (United Nations) and Balance of Power arrangements.<br />I have thoroughly enjoyed this book.  Thought provoking and insightful.  I highly recommend it.
B00005N9CV|5.0|This album is lovely, and I play it at least 2 or 3 times a week, and have bought the DVD of her live concert in Paris, which includes many of these songs. With the orchestrations of Claus Ogerman and with her piano playing in the Brazilian jazz style, Diana has GOT to make her next album the music of Antonio Carlos Jobim. Her voice would be perfect to bring his lost classics back to his fans. Meanwhile THE LOOK OF LOVE remains one of the loveliest romantic CDs ever.  Yeah, I mean it!
B00003CXZ4|5.0|It's difficult to think of a more engrossing movie then Memento. Chris Nolan took a good idea (a man who can't remember attempting to avenge his wife's murder), threw in a gimmick (a slick backward presentation), and created a masterwork. The opening, where a Polaroid undevelops, is a classy lead-in to the style. But that's just the start.<br />The backwards style is more then a gimmick. The plot is mostly told by ending the scene at the beginning of the prior scene; this is intercut with black and white footage that serves mainly for plot exposition; watch carefully the second time, and you'll see Nolan's genius<br />Guy Pearce's performance as Lenny, while not the key to the film, is effective. We can feel Lenny's confusion as time and time again he wonders, \\"What just happened?\\" Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano are equally effective; we are never quite sure why they're doing what they do, any more then Lenny is.<br />The ending... err, the middle... is one of the strongest and most confusing events in the film. Every thing you witnessed since the first shot of the movie is seen in a new light, questions are answered, and new ones are posed; that this is true in all good Noir does not in any way stifle the questions you find yourself asking as you attempt to decide who had been lying all that time.<br />All this: the style and substance, plot and gimick, performance and editing, together, adds up to one of the best, most distinctive films of 2001.
0684833395|4.0|Joseph Heller began work on Catch-22, the story of a US airman's attempts to survive the madness of the Second World War, shortly after returning from the conflict himself.<br />The book - tells the story of Captain Joseph Yossarian, a member of a US bomber crew stationed on the Mediterranean island of Pianosa. Yossarian is convinced that the military is trying to get him killed, and that those around him are insane, and he spends the book trying to get out of flying any more seemingly suicidal missions.<br />Yossarian is surrounded by a cast of bizarre characters, including Colonel Scheisskopf, obsessed with winning military parades at the expense of just about everything else, the newly promoted Major Major, who spends most of the war trying to hide from his men, and the profiteer Lieutenant Milo Minderbinder, a pure capitalist whose only ambition is to make money out of the war, and who ends up charging a commission on every military engagement.<br />Using satire, black humour and seemingly undefeatable logic, the book argues that war is insane, that the military is insane, and that, quite probably, modern life itself is insane too.<br />As Yossarian struggles against the self-serving bureaucracy at the heart of the military machine, Heller argues that the individual will always struggle against the vested interests that control the world. And, perhaps, that madness is an entirely relevant reaction to this.<br /><br />Yossarian's dilemma is summed up by &quot;Catch-22&quot; of the air force's code of practice, &quot;which specified that a concern for one's safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind&quot;. What this means, as the book's Doc Daneeka explains to Yossarian of another flyer's situation, is that &quot;Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he didn't, but if he was sane he had to fly them. If he flew them he was crazy and didn't have to; but if he didn't want to he was sane and had to&quot;.  In other words, the only sane reaction to war is to recognise its madness. But in doing so, and proving his sanity, Yossarian makes himself eligible to fight. As Yossarian puts it: &quot;That's some catch, that Catch-22&quot;. The doctor, whose job is to save lives only so that they can be put in danger again, can only agree that &quot;it's the best there is&quot;.
B00000739S|3.0|As noted many times before, this is the rest of the show that produced &quot;Rock N Roll Animal&quot;. Lou is in good voice and the band is still presenting things with an intense arena style sound.<BR>Here the emphasis is on his solo material with only one Velvet's song in the mix and the difference between the material is glaring. The solo work is much weaker than the Velvet covers, but the performance of it more than saves the day. <BR>Recommended to lovers of &quot;R-N-R Animal&quot; for the rest of the story.
B0000028RR|5.0|I'm writing this for detractors and fans alike. In my opinion, this album is the greatest and original rap-metal album created. But that's my opinion. You all are entitled to your own.<br />If you like Limp-Bizkit, Tool, System of a Down and other great rap-metal bands, this is the inspiration for them all. This is a great album, with piercing guitar licks, like on \\"Killin in the Name of\\" and my personal favorite, \\"Know your Enemy.\\" \\"Wake up\\" gets some of its sound from Led Zep's Kashmir, but it most certainly is not a copy. The lyrics are a bit repetetive, but effective. Also, its claim that they don't use synthesizers is correct, but they use effects pedals for most things, although they do create some great effects just by amplifier distortion, but you would have to see that live. Great Album, BUY IT!!!
B00004RD54|4.0|One of his better live efforts, Reed still has his voice here. The over reliance on old Velvet Underground songs doesn't say too much for Reed's solo material of the time. Still, they remain great songs and they're performed decently in an arena type sound that's strange to hear them in.<BR>&quot;Rock N Roll Animal&quot; may be a bit on the skimpy side, but it's just enough to leave you wishing you had more.
B000066NW0|5.0|This is a great cd, the best cd i've got
6301670132|3.0|This film is full of what Westerners think of Japan--land of submissive all-suffering geishas, androgynous men, pagodas, bridges, and ceremonies.  There's no mention of noodle vendors, crowded narrow streets or (female) natives who are proud of their culture and race, who prefer NOT to leave their land for the West.  The geisha who becomes Brando's girlfriend willingly offers herself to him--he doesn't need to earn her love. This film portrays Japan and the Japanese as they never were, as much as \\"Gone With the Wind\\" was of the antebellum South.  It is an affront to Asians everywhere and such a film would never be made today. <br />To its credit, it was made fifty years ago, when cultural sensitivity in the US didn't exist.  And it certainly doesn't have obnoxious scenes like the \\"Talky Talky\\" number in \\"South Pacific\\".  As for the film's merits, it is quite beautiful.  Shot in color, the Japanese landscape is postcard-picturesque.  The love story between Kelly (Red Buttons) and his Japanese wife is tender and helps illustrate the consequences of racist policies within the US military.  There's not a boring moment in this film as it is very moving.  But since I object to it on grounds that it perpetuates stereotypes of Asians by the imperialist West, I have to deduct a couple of stars.
B000050XEI|1.0|Enya is anything but a musical genius.Her music is boring,lame,dull,and pitiful.People like Elvis Presley are REAL musical genius'.However,Enya does not fall into the category of musical genius.I would reccomend skipping anything that involves Enya.Hope my review helped.
B0000028RR|5.0|No comparison. Buy this NOW!
B00006AG5N|1.0|It is not good, better buy original records. Dontt buy it.
B00005R2M3|1.0|Awful.  Just plain awful.<BR>Listening to her (try to) sing is like nails on a chalkboard. <BR>She should only be able to available through visual forms of media (and get your mute buttons ready) Why everyone is so ga-ga<BR>over Shakira is beyond me. I know talent when I see it and this is not it.
0452282152|5.0|This is the best book I've read all year.  The author's description of Holland in the 1600s is so vivid, it feels like you are walking the cobbled streets alongside the main character.  At the same time, she has not cluttered her book with mundane descriptions or details.  Her language is simple and crisp, easy on the reader.  The story itself is graceful, but riveting.  It's like listening to fine music.  You want to see what happens next, but at the same time, you don't want it to end.
B00000099Y|5.0|Beautiful, intense, deeply layered art which can and will be dissected by the intelligent listener for years.  My advice, buy this for art's sake.
B00005ATQD|5.0|The players slow dance through all the scenes, which themselves leap around with casual alarm...the old 'in & out' seemingly the one thing on our...(Whoops! Of course I mean their..)...mind. Oh My! But aren't we mocked . Is everyone in on it...is the whole world insatiable or is it just me? Oh My!  I didn't spot (until like the good Doctor...told) that the girl in the bathroom is the same obliging girl in need of the correct time on the street, is same amazing creature with dire warnings that unheeded lead to the mortuary slab...we are left to guess the how's...what's...when's and where's, only certain that all was gruesome, the more disturbed for not actually knowing. Oh My! But aren't we toyed with.
B00003CX9Q|5.0|This is one of those movies that is timeless.  I remember watching it when I was a child over and over again and loving it each and everytime.  When the the twenty year anniversery edition came to theaters, I was there opening weekend with my sister.  I was so excited to see what new sceens were added and to see it on the \\"Big\\" screen.  I laughed, cried and was on the edge of my seat, just as if I was a little kid again.  E.T. is a great family movie that encourages us to remember that everything is living and that just because something or someone is different from you, you need to treat it with the same respect and dignity that you want to be treated with.  E.T. allows your imaginiation to run wild with the possiblity that there may be other life forms somewhere out there.
B00006JL1Z|5.0|One word does this collection justice: \\"wonderful\\". \\"The Very Best of Fleetwood Mac\\" is without a doubt the best greatest hits the group has ever had. Not only does this collection include every Top 40 hit the band had from 1975-1997(\\"Rhiannon\\",\\"Dreams\\",\\"Little Lies\\",\\"Everywhere\\"),it also includes some great album tracks which never made the Top 40(\\"Songbird\\",\\"Landslide\\",\\"Sisters of the Moon\\"). This album is a great showcase of the special talents that Mick,John,Christine,Stevie,& Lindsey have demonstarted in the rock world for the last 27 years. This collection is vital to any music fan from the last 30 years.
B000059QY3|5.0|This is the first opera I have purchased on DVD and was not disappointed.  On the contrary, I was blown away.  This is due mostly to two things: Angela Gheorghiu's heartbreaking, mesmerizing performance as Violetta, and Sir Georg Solti's masterful handling of the score.  I have always been a Gheorghiu fan, particularly the times I've seen her in the opera house, but I was unprepared for the depth and feeling she displays here.  And the voice!  Just remarkable.  Frank Lopardo's Alfredo and Leo Nucci's Germont are both top-rate, but this really is Gheorghiu's show.  I have some quibbles with the production (where does Violetta live anyway, in the bottom of a barrel?) but on the whole it's splendid.  Ok, so the stage is a little crowded at times, with the singers manuevering uneasily around furniture, people etc.  And while the Act IV set is truly eye-catching, Violetta&quot;s &quot;magic mirror&quot; has got to go.  So all in all, the production's a mixed bag.  But by all means get this DVD.  Thak goodness the BBC had the forethought to capture what has already become a legendary debut.  Watching &quot;La Traviata,&quot; there's never any question why.
B00006J3WH|3.0|Buffy The Vampire Slayer is one the best written, most inventive shows on television and creator, producer, director &amp; writer Joss Whedon showed that with last year's musical episode, \\"Once More With Feeling\\".  A demon has mysteriously appeared in Sunnydale and it is causing the town's residents to spontaneously burst out into song and dance.  The singing also reveals the deep personal feelings each person has.  On the program, the singing was fun, a bold step in the land of television, but the cd doesn't translate.  The first problem is that most of the cast can't really sing.  Sarah Michelle Gellar has a weak voice at best, but as Buffy, she must carry the pivotal songs.  On tv, this isn't that big of the problem because you get visuals, but on the cd you get Ms. Gellar's voice alone which isn't strong enough by itself.  Nicholas Brendon and Allyson Hannigan flat out can't carry a tune and Michelle Trachtenburg isn't a whole lot better.  Some of the cast can actually sing like Anthony Stewart Head and Amber Benson and their \\"Standing\\" and \\"Under Your Spell\\" are strong.  James Marsters does well with his track \\"rest In Peace\\".  Broadway veteran Hinton Battle plays the demon and he brings a Broadway flair to his character.  The disk ends with score music from previous episodes and the \\"suite From Hush\\" is a powerful piece and in that episode there was virtually no dialogue and the music played a vital role.  Despite the flaws in the singing, the songs are still enjoyable and of course will appeal to any fans of the show, but might also appeal to fans of musicals.
B00006JL1Z|5.0|I own many greatest hits CD's (including \\"Fleetwood Mac's Greatest Hits\\" from 1988), and one thing I've learned is that very few of them actually contain every single notable track one could want.  There's always a few missing, be it a Top 40 single or an album track that received heavy airplay.  Rhino Records was basically created for the music collector who wants the ultimate compilations, and while they still don't always manage to get everything \\"right\\", they come way closer than anyone before them ever have or ever will.<br /><br />Yeah, the live acoustic version of \\"Big Love\\" from \\"The Dance\\" is here instead of the hit single version from \\"Tango In The Night\\" and \\"Greatest Hits\\" (probably because it's shorter).  Conversely, the studio version of \\"Silver Springs\\" is here instead of the more popular live version from \\"The Dance\\".  And there are a few songs - most notably \\"Rhiannon\\" and \\"Over My Head\\" - that are represented by single versions instead of album versions. \\"Over My Head\\" in particular has a much louder acoustic guitar and doesn't have the \\"fade-in\\" of the album version. Either way, any Fleetwood Mac collection that contains well-known but rarely anthologized songs like \\"The Chain\\", \\"Second Hand News\\", \\"Never Going Back Again\\", \\"Gold Dust Woman\\", \\"Monday Morning\\", \\"World Turning\\", \\"Songbird\\", and great but forgotten singles like \\"Sisters Of The Moon\\", \\"Think About Me\\", \\"Family Man\\", \\"Seven Wonders\\", and \\"Paper Doll\\" is one worth having.  And as always, the remastered sound is spectacular and the liner notes are comprehensive, including release dates and chart peaks for all singles and the albums they came from - a Top 40 geek's dream!<br /><br />Things I might've done differently - included the original version of \\"Big Love\\" instead of the live version, included one of Stevie Nicks' solo tunes done live by the Mac (\\"Stand Back\\" is a staple of Mac concerts whenver Nicks is in the band) to go with Lindsey Buckingham's \\"Go Insane\\", included full-length versions of all songs (even if it meant cutting one or two lesser known numbers), and I probably wouldn't have included anything from \\"Behind The Mask\\", but if I had to, I would've gone with \\"Save Me\\" instead of \\"Skies The Limit\\".  Either way, this is a five star 2CD set by a five star band if ever there was one.  Rhino has previously done great overviews for bands like Chicago, Foreigner, INXS, the Cars, and Black Sabbath (forthcoming!) and I only hope they get around to giving the same treatment to bands like the Eagles, Dire Straits, ZZ Top, and many others I can't even think of right now!
B000001Y5J|5.0|This is truly a great work of art by a great band...i think its my favorite one that the nails made...this album shows that industrial and metal can make a great combo...its short fast hard and also brilliant...and times youll be wondering what you hit you..this is the the nine inch nails most people are not familiar with..this is the lesser known of the three good nails albums...i keep trying to forget that they made the fragile...please...no one buy the fragile..it is the last album nails made and it was a big mistake...it clearly shows that they were at a loss for ideas around that time....broken doesnt though...it shows how creative and artistic the nails are...there isnt any album that sounds like it...if there is it came after broken..also something important about this album is that it shows nails can rock with the best of them..if any metal fans think the nails make music for wimps than buy this album and listen..

B00003CXTG|1.0|DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE!!! ...Unrealistic battle scenes and a sappy love triangle. But if you want unrealistic war movies, buy \\"Behind Enemy Lines\\", and if you want realistic, buy \\"Band of Brothers\\". But not this one!
B00005JKQZ|4.0|After watching this movie last night, I am somewhere between the \\"This Movie was Pile of garbage\\" and the \\"It Won Best Picture So It Must Be the Best Movie Ever\\" crowds. . . .  I purchased the book several years ago, and it looked absolutely fascinating.  It looks even better now.  If this movie did nothing else, it inspired and motivated me to put the book by Sylvia Nasar way higher on my reading list for next summer.<br />Nash is/was obviously a tremendously complex man, regardless of his disorder, and to convey those complications in a two-hour movie is virtually impossible.  Howard took the easier road and omitted a pile of details regarding their marriage, some of Nash's personal views, etc., probably for the better.  Real scholars will read the book and get the \\"real\\" story from the biography; the casual moviegoer got a fascinating glimpse into the extraordinary life of a tormented genius.<br />What bumps my review up from three to four stars were the extras on the DVD.  Seeing the real footage of Nash accepting his Nobel Prize was a beautiful addition to the film, brief though it was.  I'd love to have seen and heard Nash's acceptance speech in that footage.  Some of Ron Howard's commentary, particularly as he described the deleted scenes and how/why they were left out, was very interesting.  They made the move of the two-disc format by piling on a bunch of extras, more of which I'll be exploring this afternoon and tonight.<br />Did Howard and Crowe manage to portray the \\"beautiful mind\\" of John Nash in their limited opportunity?  I'll leave that to the more irate and gushing reviewers.  Is it a \\"Pile of garbage\\"?  No.  Is it \\"The Best Movie Ever\\"?  No.  It is ambiguously somewhere in between, probably on the higher end of the spectrum--I've seen movies try to achieve more with less success. . . .<br />Bottom Line:  This movie kept me intrigued, off-base, guessing, and engaged for its entirety.  Not all movies can do that.  It also prompted and piqued my interest in the book, wherein I will obviously find a more thorough, detailed, and complete picture of John Nash's life.  Take a Hollywood movie for what it is:  a Hollywood movie. . . .
B000065V42|1.0|This DVD presents the film in full frame, not widescreen.  Why Disney did not include a widescreen transfer on the other side of the disc or as a separate release is beyond my reasoning capabilities.  I had to return mine unopened once I realized this.  Same for HONEY, I BLEW UP THE KID.
B000001I0K|5.0|Some people like \\"Gravest Hits.\\"  But for my money, \\"Psychedelic Jungle\\" represents the Cramps' masterwork.  Swampy, bluesy, dark and menacing.  One New York, er, critic called it racist.  Go figure.  Anyhow, this album shows that these voodoobilly idols not only ooze and throb, they rock pretty hard too.<br />10 stars.
B00006AFF5|1.0|After walking out of the theater I regreted paying to see it. Owning it would be throwing good money after bad. I've seen much better remakes done by Golan and Globus. Why a wonderus, joyfull, entertaining story needs a rewrite is beyond me. Stay away from this one, get the original 1966 TV version directed by Chuck Jones with Boris Karloffs hauntingly memorible narration and the voice of Tony the Tiger singing the Grinch theme. As for the remake I wouldn't touch it with a 39 and a half foot pole.
B00003CX9Q|4.0|This isn't reflected in the press release or above in the disc specs, but both the 2-disc and 3-disc sets include both the 1982 and 2002 versions of the film! This has been confirmed by Steven Spielberg on the Today show on NBC.
B00001NFCY|5.0|In a word: awesome. They have oan incredible amount of raw talent. Here's a track by track review.   1.Are You Ready?=4/5-A great rock song. Good start for the disc.   2.What If=5/5-Arguably the best track on the disc(in my taste). Great lyrics.    3.Beautiful=3/5-OK. Pretty much a poem in song.   4.Say I=5/5-Awesome cristian lyrics. Great music too. Good for head bangin'.   5.Wrong Way=3/5-Pretty good. Interesting lyrics.   6.Faceless Man=3/5-A softer song than the first five. Creepy lyrics, about maybe a ghost? Or...God...maybe? I dunno.   7.Never Die=4/5-Your classic song about wanting to stay young and...well..never die. Only withh creepier music.   8.With Arms Wide Open=5/5-Need I say anything about this song about the arrival of Scott Stapp's son? I thought not.   9.Higher=5/5-Another exremely popular song. Lyrics about not wanting to wake up from wonderful dreams. The other best song on the disc.   10.Wash Away Those Years=5/5-An incredibly awesome song with truely amazing lyrics. You decide what you want them to be about.   11.Inside Us All=4/5-A very good uplifting song. The main lyric line tells you what the whole tune is about: &quot;there's a peace inside us all&quot;.   BUY THIS CD!!!
B0000630YA|5.0|I was one of the lucky people who got to see the tv show of this album.  Remembering that this was before MTV, seeing someone that was considered to be somewhat of a rebel and counterculture on tv at that time was incredible.  Naturally I ran out and bought the (vinyl) album.<br />And what an album.  Not quite like his previous albums, \\"Nightmare\\" had a few softer touches, most notably \\"Only Women Bleed\\", a song about how women in general at that time were considered second class citizens.<br />There are more highlights.  \\"The Black Widow\\" has a narrated opening by the incomparable Vincent Price, preceding Michael Jackson's \\"Thriller\\" by quite a few years.  My general rule of thumb is that just about anything that Vincent Price ever did on vinyl is excellent, and this narration is perfect for the album and as a lead-in to the song.<br />Listen to the end of \\"Department of Youth\\" cranked up really loud.  As the sound is fading Alice Cooper asks the children who has the power, they answer that they do, then Alice asks who gave them the power, with the expectation that it would be Alice Cooper.  The children answer \\"Donny Osmond\\", setting Alice into a frenzy, a hilarious fadeout.<br />\\"The Awakening\\" is a bit of a chiller that implies the singer has killed his wife.  All seriousness here, and one of the best songs on the CD.<br />\\"Cold Ethyl\\" is pure laughs.  Macabre laughs yes, but laughs nonetheless.  Cold Ethyl is his lover, but she's cold because she's dead and in the refrigerator.  As long as you can handle the subject, the song should make you smile.<br />\\"Devil's Food\\" and \\"Stephen\\" have some rocking moments more characteristic of Alice Cooper, and are both good as well.<br />\\"Some Folks\\" and \\"Welcome to My Nightmare\\" are both good, though each has a mainstream feel to the music though the lyrics are anything but.

B00003CXS4|5.0|Guy Ritchie has done it again - a great follow-up to his 1999 star debut \\"Lock, Stock, & Two Smoking Barrels\\". \\"Snatch\\" is masterpiece of a film, full of fun characters and a great intricate plot. It may seem a little confusing at first, but it all comes together for a great ending. This movie is a keeper - buy it and u won't ever get tired of it.
B0000025GW|5.0|* * * * *<BR>By far, this is one of Dylan's great works of art.  Among his \\"gospel albums\\" it is in the forefront, though I would submit that his recent albums tell of the good news, too.<br />From the beginning to the end this album is soulful, crisp--a joy for the ears and heart.  You'll be sliding to \\"Gotta Serve Somebody,\\" you'll be grinning with Dylan's wit in \\"Man Gave Names to All the Animals.\\"  And you'll be struck by his unapologetic stand for what he believes.  \\"Gonna Change My Way of Thinking\\" and \\"When He Returns\\" are superb.  \\"Slow Train\\" is a masterpiece.  Mark Knopfler's guitar work along with Muscle Shoals Horns is icing on the cake.  And the wonderful backing vocals of Carolyn Dennis, Helena Springs, and Regina Havis, give an added depth and resolute completeness to the album.<br />As a Gen-Xer, it intrigues me that so many people from Dylan's own generation were apalled at his coming to faith in Yeshua Ha Mashia (Jesus Christ).  It was fine when he made statements they agreed with...but when he didn't many of them were dumbfounded, and felt betrayed.  So much for the freedoms they evidently embraced.  They just couldn't handle the truth, and Dylan isn't afraid to share it.  \\"When You Gonna Wake Up?\\"<br /> ...<br />Matthew Lipsey<BR>East Lansing, MI

I suppose I can understand those who think Fight Club is only about inebriated morons getting together and beating each other to a pulp.  But of course they could not be further from the truth.  Fight Club does an amazing job of anaylyzing the state of soceity and questions mans place in soceity through impressive visulas and witty dialouge.  Don't be deceived, Fight Club is much, much more than gruesome violence.  ...
B0000636UN|3.0|I've been a fan of Sheryl's for some time now, and have seen her in concert a few times.  Bottom line, she knows how to rock.  There are not very many female rockers who can pull this off in modern times.  I ran out and bought her new album the day it came out.  I was very dissappointed.  It seems she quit rocking, and gave in to the big-money record company's push for the radio-playlist-friendly bubblegum pop, built to compete with the other awful radio artists of today (what happened to radio, anyhow?).  Bring the rockin' edge back, and quit immitating the rap stars by bringing 20 gueststars to hold your hand while you sing (that is a bad trend I hope goes away soon).  If you want to hear the essence of Sheryl, buy her older stuff.  It's much better.
B000000W5B|4.0|This is a great album.  &quot;100 Years Ago&quot; could be the best thing Mick and Keith have ever written, and &quot;Winter&quot; isn't too far behind.  Most of these songs (save the silly &quot;Dancing with Mr. D&quot;, which has the odd honor of being the Stones' first exercise in self-parody) are brilliant, affecting tunes that recall &quot;Exile on Main Street&quot; in flavor and character -- and I can't think of any higher praise than that.

B000002J2F|3.0|At first listen, this sounded like a concept album about divorce, and it probably works better in that context.  Half the album was a set of songs co-written by the group about a character (Duke) whose lover leaves him, driving him to madness (a recurring Genesis theme?  \\"Domino\\"?  \\"Evidence of Autumn\\"?).  These songs were split up on the album because having them in sequence made the rest of the album sound weak by comparison.  Add to these a pair of Phil Collins songs about his recent divorce, especially the heartbroken \\"Please Don't Ask\\", a couple of feeling-lonely Mike Rutherford cuts, and a couple of gloomy Tony Banks tracks, and the overall feeling is of loss and dissolution.<br />\\"Duke\\" and \\"...and Then There Were Three\\" were transition albums between the prog-rock of the 70s and Genesis' pop career of the 80s and early 90s.  \\"Misunderstanding\\" was the biggest radio hit Genesis had had to date, though at the time the piano shuffle sounded like Toto's \\"Hold the Line\\" and the faux-Motown backing vocals had fans screaming \\"sellout\\".  The best cuts here are from the Duke group:  \\"Turn It On Again\\" (which has to have had the most airplay ever of any song based on a riff in 13/4 time) and the mostly-instrumental \\"Duke's Travels\\", which features another classic Banks synth solo and tremendous drumming by Collins.  It's interesting to compare the \\"heavy\\" version of \\"Behind the Lines\\" included here with the \\"light\\" version of Collins' \\"Face Value\\" album.  I don't care much for the two Rutherford cuts.  Banks' \\"Heathaze\\" is a pleasant ballad (Tony Banks in-joke: the repeated chords when Collins first sings \\"I feel like an alien\\" are the same chords that start \\"Watcher of the Skies\\", about an alien).  \\"Cul-de-Sac\\" seems like a missed opportunity -- if it was stripped of some of the opening clutter and played faster, it would be as powerful as \\"Squonk\\".  Mike Rutherford gets in a few of his best guitar leads on \\"Behind the Lines\\", \\"Cul-de-Sac\\", and \\"Duke's Travels\\".<br />The album sound is sort of muddy.  The band's surprise at hearing how poor the album sounded on radio led to the sonic overhaul and clear, crisp production of \\"Abacab\\".  Genesis fans on this site seem to give every single album five stars, which can't be helpful to newcomers trying to figure out where to start.  \\"Duke\\" is not a good choice for your first Genesis album.  It's enjoyable, but not crucial to a music collection.<br />(1=poor  2=mediocre  3=pretty good  4=very good  5=phenomenal)
0316666343|4.0|...and another leap of faith to read it. I'm not sure why it hit the big time, #1 on NYT, etc, especially with the insipid cover. But it slowly sucked me in, in spite of the premise of a child looking down on her family from heaven, after she has been raped and murdered.<BR>I suspect the author was as surprised as her readers when this book took off into the stratosphere. Frankly, I'm not sure it's going to stand the test of time, and I don't feel moved to reread it. But there was a quiet power in the story, and a rare kind of healing took place, in spite of the somewhat unfulfilling ending (which I don't mention for the sake of those who haven't read the book yet).<BR>Read it. Think about it. Then give it to a friend.

B000000I0K|5.0|This is INCREDIBLE music, I still listen to it 20 years after it was released. It's hard to find the words to describe the feeelings this music conveys. While providing us with a handful of great instruments (harps, african drums, mandolin, tambourine ..), Mike Oldfield seems to find his celtic roots back. With Voyager, it is certainly the most celtic of his records, though you can't really classify this kind of music. I do enjoy the mixture of happy, energetic tracks (Celt) and sad, rather short ones (Molly). This is probably one of Oldfield's most underrated records. I can't help but thinking the 80ties were Mike's best period, and that nothing (and certainly not The millenium bell or Tres Lunas) will ever resemble Five miles out or Discovery ..

Trust me, metal fans, you'll love each of these 9 songs.  If you get the chance, be sure to see an 80's Whitesnake video.  It's like Led Zeppelin re-formed and came back to do some heavy entertaining - with a great lookin' chick!!<br />CHECK 'EM OUT!!

6302969352|5.0|Steven Spielberg put it best: Kurosawa is every bit the equal of Shakespeare. No one opened our eyes to Eastern mythology, royalty, history and culture quite like Kurosawa. His films are like huge tapestries, both appealing to the eye but also educating the heart and mind to the rich, complex history of Japan.<br />Seven Samurai is my favorite of Kurosawa's films (next to Dreams) because it is one of the most perfectly balanced films I have ever seen. The cast is superb, the camerawork is legendary, and the script is so full of wisdom and poignancy that by the end of the film you want to become a samurai.  <br />Whether or not it is the greatest film of all time is irrelevant because art is not measured quantitatively.  It's about as silly as trying to figure out the greatest painting of all time. This movie is to be appreciated along the same lines as Beethoven's 9th. Simply absorb in the genius of the work and be transformed in your perceptions of what is possible.
0393307050|5.0|It's interesting to compare Commander Jack Aubrey to Horatio Hornblower and Richard Bolitho, whom I have long considered the most successful fictional naval heroes of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Actually, Aubrey is only nominally a &quot;hero,&quot; being a much more human individual than the other two. In fact, while a notable seaman and a resourceful tactician, in many other respects he can be a thoughtless and blundering dunderhead, down on Whigs and Catholics, and with a tendency to be led by his own bowsprit where the ladies are concerned. But O'Brian certainly has invented a fully rounded character and put the reader inside his head. Even more interesting, though, is Dr. Stephen Maturin, a creature of the Enlightenment, reared in Catalonia -- physician, natural scientist, Irish ex-revolutionary, and, in the later books, secret intelligence agent for the British government. Maturin is worldly, liberal, and fearless in expressing his opinion, though he also has his narrownesses. He also is an absolute naif when it comes to marine matters, which makes him an excellent foil for whose benefit (as well as the reader's) everything must be explained. The greatest difference between O'Brian and his predecessors, perhaps, is this author's narrative style which (not even counting the nautical jargon) makes much heavier use than most of the idiom and cant of the day. It never becomes un-understandable, though. But I do have a small complaint: Now that O'Brian is gone, we shall never know the details of Aubrey's earlier career, to which some fascinating and intriguing references are made here.
B00005JKCH|5.0|This movie was very good, it had a great cast that complimented eachother.  I wanted to go see it in the theater because of the song \\"HERO\\" that is on the sound track.  But I didn't think it was going to be as good as it was.  The ending is not what I wanted it to be but it was very good and left it open for a sequel.  I can't wait till it is out on DVD because the day that it is placed on the shelves I and going to pick one up!

This book shows a number of objects that an infant would have around him/her: a car seat, toys, a bottle, a baby swing, a blanket, a crib with mobile, a changing table, and a stroller. In addition, this book explains what babies do (babies cry) and what they enjoy (being sung to, watching people, and sleeping).<br />I enjoyed this sweet and educating book.

B00005221M|5.0|Michael Mann (producer/director/cameraman - yes, if you notice in the credits he always serves as a cameraman in his productions because he is so dedicated to putting on film the precise images he wishes) - brought us Miami Vice, Manhunter (the first screen appearance of Hannibal Lecter so is the prequel to Silence of the Lambs) turned his eye to this classic tale.<br />He has often been accused of being more style than substance, which I think is wrong. Mann is both style and substance, and as in all his efforts, repeat viewing bears this out. But nowhere more so than in this film. Mann is likely a perfectionist, and he carried that out to the smallest degree with this production. They spent nearly two years before they began filming growing the crops needed for fibbers and dye, tanning the hides so that the period dress for this film is accurate.<br />Daniel Day-Lewis brings the character of Hawkeye to life, giving it warmth, sensuality, charisma, wit and strength, showing he is one of the best actors of our time. Stowe is beautiful, winsome, feminine, sensual and yet full of pioneer fortitude, displaying the strength women needed to survive in the new world. The two leads work well together.<br />The remainder of the cast give solid performances, Steve Waddington (BBC's Ivanhoe and Sleepy Hollow) as Heyward is properly stuffy, but a man willing to give his life for the woman he loves, Wes Studi as menacing a bad buy you would want,and Russel Means as Chingachgook all work to make this period piece perfection that Mann wanted.<br />Romantic, full of adventure and beautiful filmed, with haunting music by Clannad and Leahy...a must!!

B000003TSP|4.0|I tried to get into this album for years. However, b/c of the dismal soundscapes and misplaced industrial clatter that make up the majority of the songs, I never really got beyond a few tracks. However, what resurrected the album for me was the much more accessable (and just plain listenable) Roseland live album and video/DVD. Every single performance on the live album outdoes almost everything this band has ever done. It managed to help me see the songs on this album in newer and better ways since almost every song was performed live. Here's how:<BR>(note-grades are based on the studio versions only)<br />\\"Cowboys\\": An ambitious tone-setter that unfortunately falls flat with its ugly industrial loops and bogus sound effects. Beth's voice doesn't quite escape unscathed. The live version blows the studio one out of the water with the gorgeous orchestra contributing variety to such a dull rhythm section.<BR>D+<br />\\"All Mine\\": The obvious lead single. I loved it the first time I heard it but it became boring after a while since the lyrics were so cliched and \\"Fatal Attraction\\"- esque and the big band loops become grating after multipal listens. The live version, again, completely blows the studio one of the water with the monster violas and violins that give song an almost Bernard- Herrmann-\\"Psycho\\"-score sort of class. <BR>C+<br />\\"Undenied\\": This where the album begins to get good and remind the listener of the simplicity of \\"Dummy.\\" The live version lacks the clausterphobia this song needs. The spare electronic effects are used to great effect.<BR>A-<br />\\"Half Day Closing\\": Beth's attempt at social commentary. I just couldn't get past the dismal sound of this one until I heard the beautiful live version with the circus effects at the end and audience applause that blends effortlessly with the song. I went back to the studio version and it was like listening to a completely different song. I can't decide which is better now. They are both wonderful. A completely underappreciated song. <BR>A<br />\\"Over\\": Another single. I liked this song for a while b/c of Beth's wailing voice but the guitar work just seems tacked on and off-beat for some reason on both versions and I just can't get past it. I'd say it's the closest the group has ever come to sounding like an actual James Bond song (or at least the way they should be played), but the song is a bit of a failure.<BR>B-<br />\\"Humming\\": This is the song that convinced me to buy this album and give Portishead a chance (I heard this album before \\"Dummy.\\") Both the live and studio versions sound the same but the live version is more airy and allows the song to breath easier. It is probably one of my favorite electronically based songs of all time. This makes the entire goth genre look fickle in comparison.<BR>A+<br />\\"Mourning Air\\": I can't understand why this didn't become a single. I think the album would have been more successful if it had been. This is a wonderfully addictive song that really gives the listener a taste of what Portishead is all about. This wasn't on the live album or video and I just don't understand why. This is Essential Portishead!<BR>A<br />\\"Seven Months\\": Another underappreciated song. The live version is forgettable, but the studio version really grows on you. It is extremely well-crafted and non-grating. Unfortunately, you could say it kind of sounds like the rest of the album and un-special, but I think it has a unique design of its own.<BR>A-<br />\\"Only You\\": I love the music video dircted by video genius Chris Cunningham, but this is my least favorite song on the album. The lyrics are whiny and obnoxious and the beats are canned and pathetic if you compare it to Portishead's other work. The sound design is effective but this is what the critics are talking about when they say Portishead really walled themselves into an artistic corner with this album. I can't believe it became a single when there so many better ones to have chosen from, but at least itgave birth to that great video!<BR>D-<br />\\"Elysium\\": Despite the optomistic title, this is horrid and incredibly grating! Don't waste your time on the live or sudio versions! Definitely one to skip (at least the last track didn't have those horrible electronic keyboard loops to fight through). The lyrics (if you can understand them) are somewhat interesting, however.<BR>F<br />\\"Western Eyes\\": I loved this song at first but the lyrics are too conventional and amateurishly \\"GOTH,\\" and the chorus is really soggy, but the soundscape is brilliant and the most beautiful on the album. The sample at the end is very interesting and surprising. A very appropriate ending to the album, unfortunately, there isn't a live verison to compare it to (they just play the studio version over the closing crdits of the live video).<BR>B<br />Overall, a very unaccessable and uneven but memorable album from of electronic music's Class Acts. Perfect for Halloween, goth-wannabes, cultured intellectuals and getting over a bad break-up. Now, if only they'd release another album...
B000069AT7|5.0|The 2002 version of \\"ET\\" was an unfortunate mistake. Political correctness ran amok, and Mr. Spielberg became a prisoner of some misguided bleeding-hearts.<br />On the other hand....<br />But please, take some time to listen to the string of miracles that John Williams assembled for it's magnificent, Academy Award winning score.<br />In 1982, interest in symphonic music was slowly pulling out of what seemed then an irrevocable downward spiral. The score for \\"Star Wars\\" had sparked a revival of interest in orchestral performance that later on allowed ensembles like the Chicago Symphony, the New York Philharmonic and L'Orchestre Symphonique de Montreal to capitalize on the \\"rediscovery\\" of virtuoso playing in the works of Mahler, R. Strauss, Shostakovich and others. <br />Audiences became acquainted with the un-familiar  through the familiar. WHAT A TRIUMPH for good music!<br />This is clearly a credit to Mr. William's unerring melodic gift and his demanding but also extraordinary handling of orchestral color and resources.<br />The glories of the score for \\"ET\\" only confirmed the strength of what the Maestro had achieved for classical music. Audiences, and young people in particular, were listening again. I ought to know. I was one of them.<br /> Better yet: WATCH AND LISTEN!You will not be disappointed. Open your heart a little bit, and Maestro Williams and Mr. Spielberg will take care of the rest.<br />What a priviledge it has been to be  alive to listen to this music and to watch this movie, when they were still new.<br />We all, sorry enough, missed the premieres of Beethoven's 9th, Bach's St. Matthew Passion and Wagner's \\"Ring\\". How will audiences feel about this music/film 100 years in to the future? <br />Will they be sorry too, to have missed its  premiere performance?  I wonder...<br />Thank you Maestro Williams. Thank you Mr. Spielberg.<BR>

1573301183|3.0|All fans of Alice In Chains know that Layne Staley was a hopeless junkie.  They also know that he was a great musicsian, and it is a great shame that he ruined his and AIC's ability by getting all strung out on heroin.  This is a great DVD, but i must say that Layne's performance as a singer took a great toll on the band.  He is very quiet, the vocals are half-gone (seriously, they were faded and he missed a lot!), and it seems like Jerry Cantrell (guitarist) is holding the band up entirely.  It is almost like the band could have gotten along just fine without their frontman, and that just explains how Layne ended up dragging this concert down with himself.  <br />   On another note, however, the rest of the performance was great, with Mike's bass playing far better than on album, Sean's drumming as precise as ever, and Jerry's guitar sounded good in acoustic form.  <br />   This brings me to the final problem.  With \\"unplugged\\" taken literally, about half the songs on this album lose their impact entirely.  \\"Angry Chair\\", usually one of AIC's heaviest songs, is all stripped down and light on an acoustic guitar and bass.  Don't get me wrong, it is still great, but without the heavy songs adding impact, that just makes the whole performance a little boring.  <br />   After these setbacks, the end result is an OK performance that die-hard/long-time fans will love for sure, but this IS NOT IN ANYWAY a good introduction to AIC.  The best intro to this band is their album \\"Dirt\\".  Get this if you know and love AIC.  If you are not a fan of awhile, this can be a dissapointment.  Otherwise, get it.
0380789035|4.0|This is a great work, much like early Stephen King, or Terry Pratchett, or previous Gaiman works.  But it is flawed in a way common to nearly every novel of this sort.  It confuses the moral landscape early on, so that you aren't really sure whether the protagonist is fighting on the right side, and then it turns the tables, removing most of the ambiguity, and leaving us with yet another flawed-but-basically-good leading man.  A literary work of this type yearns to be freed from this clich&eacute;, and for a while I thought Gaiman had it in him.  I can only hope that he's not finished yet.
0385484518|5.0|I picked this book at a bookstore because of its interesting title Tuesdays with Morrie; an old man, a young man, and lifes greatest lesson Then, I was to it after I read the first paragraph of the first chapter.<BR>        The author of this US bestseller is Mitch Albom, a very famous sports columnist. He is also the author of another bestseller, Bo and Fab Five. This book is the story between Mitch Albom and his favourite college professor, Morrie Schwartz. It includes some flashback of the days when Mitch was still studying in college sixteen years ago. I think the most touching scenes include what happened on Mitch's graduation day and also the last class Mitch had with his dying professor about the meaning of life at Morrie's house.<BR>        At first, I thought that this book might just be a record of their conversations about the meaning of life. Out of my expectation, there are a lot of incidents in the story. Morrie was his favourite professor who loved dancing and swimming very much but he got ALS, a brutal illness of the neurological system which made him lose the ability to move his head. Also, he had a hard childhood. At the same time, Mitch had already encountered with death when his dear uncle, who taught him music, died in Mitchs early twenties. And he had a strange brother who got the cancer of pancreas but never let anyone does anything for him or takes care of him. So, Mitch was ripped with guilt and he was relieved when he could do something for his dying professor. The moment of the past and the present appeared alternatively in the book so it is like watching scenes of a movie which made me difficult to put it down.<BR>         At the beginning of my reading, I sympathized with Morrie's life so I read it as a tragedy. But then, I was influenced and touched by his optimistic and progressive spirit. It is like a biography. Yet, the ideas that were taught by Morrie in this book are quite difficult to understand and I really can't digest andabsorb them at once. But, I also have a lot of resonance with many of his ideas like the tension of opposites in our lives, how to detach ourselves and I really love the wise story about the waves and the sea. <BR>        Tuesdays with Morrie has become one of my favourite books because it makes me think about a lot of things. It makes me yearn for such a teacher, who can help me to see the world as a more profound place and give me sound advice to guide my way in my life. Mitch is lucky to have Morrie. This book is about the philosophy of life and I think we will react to it differently at different ages or after having different experiences. So, it is not only a story book, it can be a guidebook to living your life!

0451169514|4.0|I've always been a King fan. My Mom started me on his books at a young age. The first time I read the book I was fairly young maybe 10 or 12, so the story was not real clear then. I've read it and saw the movie since and feel it to be a very good story. Everyone has a childhood fear and a lot of people are very afraid of clowns. For the fear in this book to be a clown and be so utterly terrifying gave me chills. Since this is my genre of chioce I love to read this book when I'm in between books.
B00003CX9Q|4.0|'E.T.' is a movie worth owning and remembering. Steven Speilberg has given all fans the option of remembering it as they first saw it, whether that be in 1982 or in 2002, on which DVD they decide to purchase.<br />A newspaper article in today's (10/16/02) CNN states that Steven Spielberg has arranged for BOTH DVD releases of E.T. to contain both movies. Mr. Speilberg is quoted as saying \\"My intention was never to replace the original film. When people buy 'E.T.' I want them to know they have the original movie, not just for collectors and aficionados, but for everyone who remembers it and wants to continue remembering it just that way.\\"<br />While I understand other's opinion that the changes made for 2002 were extreme and detracted from the film itself, I have to respect the director's desire to revisit one of his works and use modern technology to bring it closer to his original vision. <br />And as a parent who has to teach a young child that strangers should be avoided - unless that stranger happens to be a police officer, firefighter or EMT, I can appreciate wanting to make the police seem a little less intimidating to kids. I wouldn't have made the same choice, but again I have to respect the director's choices.<br />Whatever version I prefer, or my child ultimately prefers, both will be available regardless of the DVD I choose to purchase. I am glad the Mr. Spielberg brought Universal around to his thinking on this matter. As to the additional material available on the 'Ultimate' set - I think I'll wait until the release details are finalized before I dismiss it as being solely profit minded.
B00006IU73|5.0|This is my first Porcupine Tree album.  I liked 3 or 4 of the songs  right away.  A few of the others, I was not too sure of.  All I can say is that this is one of those albums that the more you listen to it, the more you hear.  It is a study in contrasts with dark images contrasted against achingly beautiful harmonies and melodies.  Heavy riffs contrasted against, deep textures.  And so on.  You have to hear it for yourself.  But I think anyone into fresh sounds, that may have hints of other influences, but is totally its own thing, will like this.  Comparisons of &quot;Tool meets Beach Boys meets Pink Floyd meets King Crimson&quot; etc are good as far as they go, but will not do this music justice.<BR>After listening to this pretty steadily in my car, in my office and in my home for the last two weeks, there is only one tune I don't like at all and one that I could take or leave (I won't say which ones because it might prejudice you and you might like them anyway! Plus, I am looking forward to seeing this band in concert in Nov 2002 and they may improve on these tunes live).  The rest of this album is essential listening with great writing, singing, harmony vocals, playing, arrangements, recording, sounds and overall presentation. And that's a very good ratio of gold to dross if you ask me. Check it out!
B00000J7SS|5.0|Growing up as a young child in the 1970s, I was exposed to jazz through my father's extensive record collection.  One of his most-played titles was a double LP called &quot;Bitches Brew.&quot;  At the age of around 7 years old, I remember fixing my gaze on the album cover, watching its bold and vivid colors stare right back at me while the music was blaring out of the speaker.  Even then, I was able to appreciate the album's many riches as a tremendous milestone in jazz.  Then, years later, I bought the CD version, hoping to relive those distant childhood memories.  Even after all these years, the album still holds up remarkably well.  An unparalleled fusion of jazz and rock, &quot;Bitches Brew&quot; is less an album than a guided tour through the mind of a genius.  &quot;Pharoah's Dance&quot; and the title track are two extremely long, unstructured, but well-nuanced tracks that are potent as they are hypnotic.  &quot;John McLaughlin&quot; bristles with fire and spunk, and &quot;Spanish Key&quot; also holds up well.  This is a great album to listen to on a rainy evening, on your walkman during a long flight, or for a dinner party for almost any occasion.  The remastered version is a huge imporvement over the original pressing, whose sound quality was embarrassingly poor.  Those who are debating whether to make the &quot;upgrade&quot; are strongly advised to do so.  Not only is the sound richer and more crisp, but this edition also has a bonus track, the 11 minute &quot;Feio,&quot; that appears on the box set.  Quite simply, &quot;Bitches Brew&quot; is a bold, brilliant piece of work.  To give it anything less than five stars is sheer lunacy.
6300182193|5.0|In my opinion this is the finest version ever. The sinfully<br />...Frank Langella takes the title role--and makes it his<br />own:0) The entire cast has a lot of heavy hitters including<br />the incomparible Sir Laurence Olivier, Donald Pleasance and one of my favorite actresses Kate Nelligan. This movie<br />has it all--romance,scary elements, and John Williams<br />completely haunting soundtrack. I love it--hopefully you will<br />too.
006441034X|5.0|I picked this book up from the library not knowing what to expect. All I knew is that it was about a magic castle, I really didn't care to check inside, I just wanted a book.<br />...This story pulled me right in, there was never a spot in which I was bored...I found all the character's amusing, and laughed quite loudly when Sophie went and yelled at a moving castle. I recommend it for anybody that wants to have a good time, because you will have a good time.
B00006690G|5.0|As a former sceptic of Eminem this album has proven him to follow the patern of his previouse albums. This album helped explain to us why he is the way he is, also I have found his love for his daughter to be displayed in abundance throughout the album.
630512762X|5.0|The DVD of FACE OFF is one of the best, and a must-buy on the format. John Woo, uber director of The Killer (1989), Hard Boiled (1992) and Broken Arrow (1996) proves that even after the move to Hollywood, he still knows how to create fantastic action and Face Off is no exception. Building on the good but not great BROKEN ARROW, this one is a fantastic action ride. The film stars Nicholas Cage as Castor Troy, a villain, and John Travolta as agent Sean Archer, the only man who can stop Castor from unleashing a nuclear device.<br />Woo's trademarks are all present here: slow-mo gunfights, explosive action and those perennial doves. And both Nic Cage and Travolta are brilliant, especially Cage, whose eccentric performance is one of his most unrestrained and outstanding. One of the best (If not THE best) action films ever made. Excellent.<br />The DVD extras are sparse, with only a trailer. One hopes a future re-release will come soon...
6301902645|5.0|This is the film that got me hooked on motorsport back in the late 1970s. The action sequences are superb and without wanting to ruin the ending for anyone who hasn't seen it - Steve McQueen doesn't win the race in the film, so thankfully no yucky &quot;running around in slow motion&quot; ending. Limited dialogue so more time for atmosphere and on-track action which speaks far more anyway.<br />Thoroughly enjoyable, any motorsport fan will enjoy this.
B00005JY1B|5.0|Sweet November is the best movie yet. You will laugh and you will cry when your watching this movie. Although there is some sexual content and adult language in this movie, it teaches people of all ages a lesson. That lesson is that even though you work hard that doesn't mean you can't have fun. That is why I like  this and I think you will too.
0312243022|5.0|I thought that this was one of the most creative and well written books that I've discovered in quite some time.  With the over abundance of &quot;book club&quot; novels that are surrounded by hype and promotions, this ingenuity of style wove complex themes, a historical foundation, and pure creativity into a fabulous work.  Worth the read.
B00006AW2J|5.0|Well, Beggars Banquet is a 5-star album if they burn the disc from a master that's been dragged across asphalt, so that goes without saying.  I just got this remaster in the mail tonight and it sounds absolutely terrific and I don't even have an SACD player (may ask for one of those for Christmas this year).  The difference isn't profound on every song, but you can hear it in the little details that really come through on some tracks.  \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\" has never sounded more crisp, but I think the changes to the acoustic tracks are probably the most dramatic. I don't know that I have a musical ear sharp enough to pick up on the fact that the recording is a bit faster, but there are moments when, at the very least, the songs feel like they are really moving.  Who knows to what degree I'm actually hearing the up-tick in speed and it is making a discernible difference--whatever difference it's making, it certainly doesn't hurt the album.<br />Well worth replacing your old copy.
B00004RF9I|5.0|Incredible film.<br />Lumet and company put on a clinic.  If you haven't become a humanoid who refuses to see anything pre-TomCruise then you're missing out on not just one great film, but many.  This movie is about finding your own voice, and not simply accepting the truth as given.  You've got to seek it out!

B0000029LG|5.0|It is hard to choose Mike's best work but this is definitely a candidate. The first disc I won't go into detail on since it is a compilation of older songs. Most of the songs are very emotionally charged and reflect his feelings on issues from personal to political.<br />-Scream is great to listen to and is perfect to sing along with when you want to let out your anger.<BR>-They Don't Care About Us is wonderful. It has a great beat. <BR>-Stranger In Moscow is a slower song which takes some getting used to but is as good as the rest in the end.<BR>-This Time Around feels like a song from Dangerous to me. I Can't Let Her Get Away?<BR>-Earth Song is amazing! It is so beautiful and indescribable. His voice is amazing and that coupled with the choir makes a powerful effect. <BR>-D.S. is one of the lesser songs accoustically. It compensates with the mystery and fun of it though. Who is Dom Sheldon?<BR>-Money is a great song. I can almost hear his exasperation with people who are too greedy. Could this song reflect the vices of certain people who are connected to Michael due to a certain scandal? Who knows...<BR>-Come Together was recorded by Mike in the 80's and it still sounds good. It rocks.<BR>-You Are Not Alone is so soothing. It comforts me whenever I am down.<BR>-Childhood is very sweet. It is very pretty.<BR>-Tabloid Junkie is different, but good. It is fun to sing along to.<BR>-2 Bad is excellent! I love this song. It is great. It is a song you can jam too.<BR>-History is very good. It takes about a minute and a half to get into because it has snippets from speeches and stuff but it leaves you with a positive feeling.<BR>-Little Susie is very haunting. If you see the picture in the booklet you will really be freaked out. The song really begins at 2 minutes and 50 seconds into it.<BR>-Smile is simple song that reminds you to do something really basic. It has a loose, informal feeling.<br />What makes this CD great is that the songs are charged with emotion and youget the feeling that they really have meaning and are an uninhibited disclosure of Michael's emotions. Overall it is one of his best albums.
B000065U1N|5.0|One of the best movies ever almost. as good as \\"the thing\\" i was amazed by the special effects and the fighting constant fighting among the skinnes \\" the samalia malitia .\\" it was a constant battle between the two i give this a 5 star movie it almost felt like you were in the fire fight. at first i thought it was going to be a [poor] remake of the atual thing. this whole movie made me think of the clinton scandle and how he got our men in this.
B00003CXQY|3.0|The movie is great! For those who want to know whether or not to buy the movie I would recommend it. I bought it the second it came out on video. However, when I decided to upgrade to DVD I had to decide whether or not I wanted to fork over an extra 10 dollars to get the two disc version rather than the standard DVD. I bought the ultimate groove and I regret it now. I would have been much happier if I had chosen the regular dvd. The second disc is loaded with behind the scenes features which are explained by the director and producer. I hate to be mean but after the first five minutes their attempts to be entertaining become cheesy and redundant. Maybe if I was a little kid I would appreciate it more, but then the behind the scenes footage probably wouldn't hold my interest. It gets repetitive after a while. For all the time they take explaining the processes of animation they could have spent a little more focusing on the actors and/or how they came up with the idea for the movie. It is all very dry and technical. In the end they kind of took the fun out of the behind the scenes features. You would probably be more satisfied with the other version which seems to have all the other features this one has.
B00000AF98|5.0|A truly amazing album. It got me through some rough times, and made the good times even better. This album gets wrongfully ripped on, which is a shame. It is a gem and honestly should be part of every rock collection. Forget bands like Pink Floyd and U2. This album is great fun, but that doesn't mean there aren't serious moments. Every song is a winner. \\"Crazy Crazy Nights\\" is a mighty anthem. \\"Bang Bang You\\" is totally KISS, just 80's style. The intro solo on \\"No, No, No\\" rips. \\"My Way\\" is inspirational and is how everyone should live their life. \\"Reason To Live\\" delivers a sincere message. \\"Turn On The Night\\" is pure fun. \\"Thief In Night\\" is shadowy and rocks the album to a finish. These descriptions are brief and I didn't describe every song, I would go way over the limit. You should get the idea. Seriously, do yourself a favor and get this one. Then check out other overlooked albums like Aerosmith's Done With Mirrors and anything (everything) by Cheap Trick.
B00000J2SQ|2.0|After the brilliant 'Difficult to Cure', Rainbow sold out on the horrible 'Straight Between The Eyes'. THis album is Rainbow doing tough man rock. The opening track 'Death Alley Driver' is essentially HIGHWAY STAR updated for the 80's...not that it NEEDED to be updated!'Stone Cold' is a likeable ballad and a nice melodic song and is probably my favorite track here.'Tearing Out My Heart' tis mellow and has some nice emotional guitar playing from Blackmore.<br /><br /> The rest is just yer standard, heavy big man rock, with Joe Lynn Turner and Ritchie Blackmore trying too hard to be neat with alot of overused rock cliches, both musically and lyrically. 'Eyes Of Fire' is okay, tho'<br />Rainbow did the same thing much more effectively with 'Gates Of Babylon'. Blackmore does get in plenty of good guitar solos, even on some of the weaker songs and Roger Glover's bass playing is pretty solid. If this were a Foreigner album, it would be okay...but it's NOT a Foreigner album, just a very weak Rainbow album. I'm not completely recommending it, though it does have it's good moments, for sure. And I'll take even a weak Rainbow over a great Foreigner album anyday!
0375757856|5.0|It was T S Eliot who described Wilkie Collins' \\"The Moonstone\\" as \\"the first, the longest, and the best of Modern English detective novels\\".  Not everybody might agree with this, but all practitioners, readers, and fans of detective fiction will find much to admire and enjoy in this magnificent 1868 publication.<br />Although not exactly the first example of detection novels, it provides the archetypal sleuth, Sergeant Cuff, an astute though idiosyncratic detective who leads the chase to the solution of the mystery, easily surpassing the dim-witted local police authorities.  It also explores the full potential of the whodunit formula.<br />Arguably, it is still the longest example of detective fiction.  Unlike most other serialized novels of its era, this one is meticulously plotted.  You'll find red herrings, suspense, the unexpected, climaxes that overwhelm or fizzle out, and a satisfying denouement.  It is narrated largely by some of the principal characters.  All are revealed in well-rounded perspective while carrying forward the story line.  The most popular has always been Drusilla Clack, \\"that rampant spinster\\", a self-righteous tract-dispensing lady who likes to eavesdrop and to be judgmental.<br />Is it the best?  I would unhesitatingly award it the prize, while welcoming other internet browsers to name other contenders.<br />Wealthy internet browsers are recommended to download the unabridged audio reading of the book.  It is a novel that reads well, and the full length reading available is a model of its kind.  Naxos has produced an abridged version. It has the benefit of multiple readers, but most of the charm and all the atmosphere seems to disappear in the abridgment process.  Book format will put you in touch with the original text and, provided you have the leisure and disposition for tackling a 20 hour read, will provide your imagination, your mind and your literary appetite with rich material.
0788821075|5.0|Pretty Woman released in 1990 stars Julia Roberts as Vivian and Richard Gere as Edward Louis.  The director Garry Marshall captures a fairy tale about a street-wise prostitute who meets her prince charming.  He portrays Vivian the street-wise prostitute as a person who you can't help but fall in love.  Vivian captures Edward's eye when she drives his friends borrowed car to his hotel.

They spend the evening together and the next day Edward asks Vivian to be his companion for the week.  He leaves her a wad of cash and wants her to go out and buy some clothes.  She does what every woman would do go shopping on Rodeo Drive.  She gets snubbed by the snobbish shopkeepers and goes back to the hotel without any clothing.  The hotel manager places an important phone call and helps her out with her clothing problem.  He also assists her with learning the importance of silverware.  <br />Even though Vivian may get treated like ... trash in different parts of the movie, you will not see her like this at all.  Edward never once says anything to make her feel like this or gives you the impression that he even remotely thinks of her like ... trash.  He sees her as a beautiful woman who just took the wrong turn on the road of life.  <br />Vivian and Edward attend many events together including the opera and an evening meal with flying oysters.  Vivian will keep you on your seat with her wit and talent.  This Cinderella story will make you laugh, cry, and make your heart break.  You can't help but hope that love prevails in the end.
B000002BYD|5.0|To all the naysayers. . . this is proof that this band can rock beyond all belief.  No Code was experimental and great but many of the fringe Pearl Jam fans did not like it.  <br />This album is packed with old school pearl jam.  MFC, Give in to Fly, Faithful, and a slew of others are nothing but killer.  This is arguably the best PJ record to date.  Jack Irons was a great addition to the band for this record, great drum work.  Eddie always has a great voice and the rest of the band backs up that voice to perfection. What a great record.
B00005JK8K|1.0|John Woo, who normally makes good films, should fall on his samuri sword for putting his name on this trash.  Nick Cage gives a performance second only to the infamous 8MM.  This contrived and predictable trash should be fed to death row inmates on a steady diet, the chair cannot compare to the torture.  This Rodney King We Should All Get Along Despite Our Differences drabble made me want to vomit.  Before you rent this flick, pull the pin from a grenade, put it in your mouth, then duct tape it shut, you'll thank yourself for the sweet release of death...
044022165X|4.0|I love John Grisham's work without exception, although I find that each work has it's perks and different aspects. As one reviewer (of many I'm sure!) already pointed out is this book is very emotionally charged. While this book lacked any thriller aspect found in say \\"The Partner,\\" an aspect that made you not want to put it down, it was still a solid piece of Grisham work. This book was written in the first character, and for the first time in my experience with Grisham's work there was an element of sexuality. Have no fear, the book was not rittled with steamy sex scenes, but the characters merely came across as more human for the lust they were feeling and occasionally, at times, were not entirely concerned with the court cases at hand.
B00003CXXM|4.0|It's nice to see a spy movie that actually has some intelligence behind it, and not just big explosions, and fancy gadgets (nothing wrong with either!)  Sure the amnesia plot line might be clich&eacute;, but it's done very well.  Matt Damon is a good actor, with an ability to handle some seemingly different roles, and making them believable, and likeable.  The movie keeps you interested and engaged, with only a little silliness, at times.  Franka Potente is a very fine discovery, as she and Matt have very good chemistry together.  The car chase scene in this movie ranks among the very best of all time!  What is it about European settings that make car chase scenes so awesome (such as in Ronin!)  Matt is believable enough in the fight scenes, and the action has a nice pace to it that keeps things interesting.<br />Not having read the book, I am able to enjoy the movie for what it is: a smart and interesting spy movie.  Having read the other reviews, apparently the movie producers did more slicing and dicing to the original novel than a chef at Benihana's.  Having seen the book in stores for years, and always passing it up for one reason or another, this movie, along with those previous reviews, has given me the desire to pick it up on my next trip to the bookstore.<br />The only other comment I have is why is there such a lag between the dvd release dates of this movie, and The Sum Of All Fears, which were only released a week or two apart in the theaters?  Obviously TSOAF was a bigger budget movie, but this was a much better movie!  Anyway, my copy of the dvd has been pre-ordered, and it will enter my dvd player the second it's delivered to my door!  This movie rates 4½ stars.&lt;P...
B00004YYDI|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all times. And maybe I'm losing my objectivity in this review but what the hell. I freakin love this movie. The cinematography, excellent performance by Jean Reno, one of my favorite actors (yes he`s in rollerball and godzilla but u have to eat, don't u?), and a solid story. (not mentioning incredible action scenes). Buy this DVD, its a really great movie. It touches, I know I touched me, and I'm as analytical and objective in my reviews as as I can be. But this movie won my heart and soul, so if I can give it five stars, I really would. The whole escence in in solety, absence of love, and love itself. A true masterpiece. Worth every penny.

This one will keep you bumping all night long.
0446608955|4.0|I would recommend this book to anyone.  If you have seen the movie you need to read the book.  I liked watching the movie first because I could compare the differences between the two.  The book has taught me to treat everyone you meet with respect.  I have also learned to treat others the way you wish to be treated.  I could relate too the book well.  Some of the things the main characters had to face I have been faced with before in my own life.  A Walk to Remember is an all out great book.  I give it two thumbs up.
B000056HRZ|4.0|The movie\\"Casablanca\\" was 103 minutes of some of the best classic film ever recorded.  I was never before interested in viewing this film, but am now glad that I did.  It's helped to open my eyes to the world of the black and white classic movie.<BR>  <BR>The awards for best director (Michael Curtiz), best actor (Humphrey Bogart),and best supporting actor (Claude Rains) were all well deserved.  Ingrid Bergman also did a fabulous job in the part of Bogart's ex-lover.  And who could forget Dooley Wilson's part as Sam, the piano player always willing to provide atmosphere where it was needed most.<br />I find it to be interesting that this movie would take a controversial situation, such as the German occupancy of France, and apply it to a movie based on a love triangle, while still managing to keep the entire thing believable.  I wonder if this might not be the beginning of the day time soap opera. <br />Memorable scenes filled with memorable lines, like \\"Here's looking at you, kid.\\" Help to make this movie.  While the music, aside from that played by Sam, helped to not only provide the emotional atmosphere for the movie, but it also tied together important pieces that might have otherwise been left astray. <BR> <BR>I found this movie to be well done.  It was believable, but with a twist.  Much like a nice cold glass of iced tea with a twist of lemon; sweet, refreshing, and with just enough of a zip to keep you interested.
B00003CX8Y|4.0|The features on this DVD does make it a PLAT NUM Edition. But, the quality of the movies' image is not. Pacting 3 versions of the movie on 1 disc, it suffers MPEG2 compressions. There are a lot of artifacts if you look carefully. Also, I hate the fact that they advertise &quot;Original Theatical Edition&quot; while they modified some little parts and used the soundtrack of the IMAX re-release.<br />Apart from those little (or big for some people) things, it's a great set. Wish they've put everything on 3 discs and gave us the real &quot;Original Theatical Edition&quot;.

B00000BKE1|4.0|This is the follow-up to Maiden's unsuccesful \\"No Prayer for the Dying\\". In comparison, Fear of the Dark is a better album. You can sort of hear on No prayer, where they were trying to go, but didn't quite get there until this album. The style Steve Harris was shooting for with their previous album made more sense with Fear of the Dark. A similar sounding album, just simply a better collection of songs. Janick Gers and Dave Murray seem to be working together a little more and better. It's a bit more diverse, and sprawling. It's definitely a long epic album like the Maiden albums of the 80's, but executing their new hard \\"garage\\" style sound. It's a long and rather uneven album, but not that that's a bad thing, it actually seems to work here. It took many listens for me to appreciate this album for what it is. I didn't like it when I first heard it, but it gets better with each listen. There is a definite mood that all the songs have in common, which is very cool. Something No prayer was lacking. In typical Maiden fasion, the album opens up with a short fast and furious song in \\"Be quick or be dead\\", which was released as a single. \\"From here to Eternity\\" is next and is another fast paced song with a great solo, also released as a single. Then comes \\"Afraid to shoot strangers\\". This is a truly great song. It starts of slow, with Bruce almost in narrative describing how it feels before marching into battle, and then half way through, enters the usual guitar melodies and harmonies, and features two great solos. \\"Fear is the Key\\" is not a good song. \\"Childhood's End\\" is a very good song, not typical Maiden, but the mood and feel definitely works. \\"Wasting Love\\" is an attempt at a ballad, but it isn't their best effort. Not a bad song though. I'm personally a fan of \\"The Fugitive\\", many people don't like it, but I think it really rocks, it took a few listens, but it definitely works in the context of the other songs on the album. \\"Chains of Misery\\" is a rare song writtenmostly by Dave Murray, and the highlight is the solo, to no surprise. \\"Judas be my Guide\\" is a great song, the second best song on the album. It's a fast and catchy song, with two great solos from Murray. This album is worth getting for this song and the title track at the end alone. The title track is one of my favorite Maiden songs ever. It's a classic epic finale that reminds you why you love Maiden, and even bought this album to begin with. Great intro, great lyrics, great solo's, and great chorus. A truly great song. Not their best album, but a very good one. I recommend it to anyone.
B000002BYD|5.0|I own the entire Pearl Jam catalog and this is their best album, just ahead of Ten and Vitalogy. Also, this is their only album, I can listen to all the way through. A wide variety of songs, from the hard rock &quot;Do the Evolution,&quot; experiemental &quot;Push Me Pull Me,&quot; ballad &quot;Wishlist,&quot; and incomparable &quot;Given to Fly.&quot; My personal favorite is &quot;Low Light,&quot; which has affected me deeper than just about any of song. Listen to the album a few times, like I did, and you'll want to go out and buy all of thers, like I did. You'll return to this, I guarantee.
B000066NW0|4.0|When i first listened to this cd I thought the artist put a lot of work into this cd. Since she is a new artist she has done very well with the younger audiences. She has a long way to go to get where Britney and the other female arists are at. She has her own style and grace, but her music is like no other females in the music world which is nice because it is different and not like the other females before her.
B00006CXSS|5.0|When i first heard about Band of Brothers i was thrilled to see what it would be like. I was worried when i heard that it would be a tv released series. But my doubts were soon put to rest, the shear work that went into this series blew me away. The movie pulled me right in and almost made you feel like you were watching the real thing. Every episode grabbed you more and pulled you deeper in the the series. This DVD is a must buy for any War Epic lovers out there.
B000002JPA|4.0|With this album they hit many things on the head. Very positive, uplifting and hopeful. Many of their best lyrics are on this album. Petrucci is a great guitarist-fantastic but not ridiculous and over-the-top riffs most of the time, still staying close to the melody, mixing it up. Myung should be louder in the mix on most DT albums. Labrie has his finest technical performance on this album, especially in Another Day-what range, but still with passion in other songs. Moore was their best keyboardist, choosing to focus on melodic conceptualism rather than blowing notes all over like Rudess does with that junky guitar-distortion keyboard effect he uses. Yes, Jordan's great, but I feel what Moore is doing was better. Portnoy is great technically and in terms of filling the music (the next level from Peart), but he uses very little dynamics and isn't expressive enough. All of his drumming is way too rigid, filling in every space possible. Why use so many straight-ahead double-bass lines? Mix it up! Pull Me Under is skill with a focus on melody-a great opening song. Take the time is very positive, great guitar work, funk guitar is fun. Petrucci is just so good on this album-he knows how to break up his chords into the coolest rhythms. Inherently, my problem with prog is that breaking up your songs into little breaks really takes away the momentum. Metropolis has it's moments, specifically the beginning and the end. That \\"as a child\\" part is so bad, though. Under A Glass Moon is a gorgeous song with great guitar work. Overall, a very beautiful and cohesive album. I would recommend this album first to all beginning DT fans.
6304595247|4.0|I discovered this film while helping my son understand Emily Bronte's passionate novel.  Unlike the other more popular older classic with Merle Oberon and Lawrence Olivier in the roles of Cathy and Heathcliff, this adaptation does not end with Cathy's death by the open window in Heathcliff's arms.  The Juliette Binoche-Ralph Fiennes collaboration faithfully follows the course of the novel through the two generations of Heathcliffs, Earnshaws and Lintons and for this reason is extrememly helpful to anyone needing supplementation while reading the novel.<br /><br />Especially stirring is Ralph Fiennes as Heathcliff, although I would have liked to have seen his character without the slick-backed pitch-black hair.  As Wuthering Heights is a story of a sheltered community of few individuals where emotions run as wild as the ravaging weather and revenge and obsession are the confused results of a union mistakenly kept apart, I thought Fiennes' portrayal of the tortured antihero true to Bronte's vision.<br />Fiennes as Heathcliff concentrates on and never forgets his storeroom of inner pain.  His inner scars sear through in his every word and deed especially in the hour following his Cathy's death. His anger smolders from within and one can quite believe that he is haunted by both inner and outer demons.  Any tangible softness is noticeable only when thinking or speaking of his lost love and this one-track intensity more than adequately demonstrates the character's obsession with destruction and revenge.  For all these reasons, Fiennes captures the literary Heathcliff magnificently.<br />On the otherhand, his performance is hindered by Juliette Binoche's less than satisfactory portrayal of Cathy Earnshaw and her daughter Catherine Linton. Binoche is certainly no Cathy, at least not the Cathy envisioned while reading Emily Bronte's novel.  She is too reserved; there is a mischievious quality beneath the surface, but just barely beneath it, she doesn't blaze with the fire of soul like Bronte's heroine must in order to be Heathcliff's female equivalent.  Her dual role as Catherine Linton is off-putting as the quieter daughter is in essence played no differently by Binoche except for a change of haircolor.<br />All in all the movie is entertaining.  I would have liked to see more romantic interludes between the younger Heathcliff and Cathy to further support their tempestuous connection instead of the silly, unnecessary and wasteful opening scene of Bronte walking her beloved moors in order to introduce the story.<br />Best of all is the haunting score written by Ryuichi Sakamoto; he really captures Bronte's yearning and thirst for something that could never fully be.l like Bronte's heroine must in order to be Heathcliff's female equivalent.

B00003CX8Y|5.0|The animated feature which revolutionalized all future animated features has finally been given the royal treatment.  The movie itself truely deserved all of its accolades.  I do feel that it was the best picture of 1991, despite what the academy said. What did win the BP Oscar in '91?  Ten years later, the masterpiece was shown in large screen/IMAX format; however, not everyone lives within close proximity to one.  The DVD is pristine in quality.  The movie has never looked better.  The work-in-progress version was fascinating to see as it was seen at the New York film festival of '91.  And the Special Edition adds so much without taking anything away from the original.  The extras are extraordinary.  The games are fun for everyone.  The behind the scenes features add detail to the pains taken in making both editons.  The inclusion of the Celine Dion/Peabo Bryson video is a nice touch.  However, did we really need a new teeny-bopper version of the title song?  My only complaint is that more could have been done with the Broadway stage production material.  Was it not possible for Mr. Eisner and the other big shots to include actual scenes from the show instead of only snap shots?  One can only hope that Eisner's vision of turning the musical into a grand, gothic, cinematic masterpiece comes to fruition.  Can't wait for The Lion King in 2003!!!!
0553277472|1.0|I read this years ago when I was in college, and spent a good amount of effort with a highlighter, rereading and cross-referencing, trying to figure out the Big Message that this book kept threatening to deliver.  Well, there isn't one.  It's (useless nonsense) philosophy as fiction, and not much satisfying on either count.  If you want a measure of enlightenment from motorcycle maintenance, buy a motorcycle that doesn't run and fix it up like new.
0593044703|5.0|Some people who start reading 'Gardens of the moon' may feel slightly out of their depth. The book does not have some series-defining prologue that tells you where the story is going, nor does it reveal anything about the world's past.<br />The world that Erikson has created with this book is startlingly original, without appearing too esoteric. However, you only learn about this world as you read through the series. This makes you hunger, not just for the answers to the plot that Erikson unfolds, but also for understanding as to the vagaries of magic and society within this world.<br />This book presents a story in which the reader will be unaware of just who is the villain. Gardens of the moon only touches the tip of the iceberg, and it will have you craving more at the end. Erikson writes in a way which leaves the person enthralled, yet totally aware of what the author is describing; For instance, the action scenes of the book are written in a way that actually gives a clear image of what is going on (unlike many fantasy authors i can name).<br />Steven Erikson's books are written in an expert manner. The characters he creates are able to be sympathised with, yet display a remarkable diversity. He crosses Robert Jordan's fecundity of imagination, George R R Martin's dark side, and Robin Hobb's avoidance of blatant cliches. I have read all the books that have been released in this series thus far, and will buy the next one as soon as it is released. I recommend that everyone else does the same.

B000067JG3|5.0|Robert Wise  directs<BR>Genre:  Musical/Family Classic<BR>Starring:<BR>Julie Andrews ....  Maria<BR>Christopher Plummer ....  Captain Georg von Trapp<BR>Eleanor Parker (I) ....  Baroness Elsa Schraeder<BR>Richard Haydn ....  Max Detweiler<BR>Peggy Wood (I) ....  Mother Abbess<BR>Charmian Carr ....  Liesl von Trapp<BR>Daniel Truhitte ....  Rolf Gruber<br />What review of this film would be complete without the requisite gushing praise for the opening sequence? It's justifiably famous, and gives an epic feel to a film that, at its heart, is a simple family story. <BR>Director Robert Wise lives up to his surname...he wisely takes a very effective minimalist approach with the story. Where a lesser director would have 'pumped up' the song sequences with flashier camera moves, Wise lets the songs speak for themselves and instead concentrates on getting the texture and feel of the scenes just right. \\"The Sound of Music\\" is simply but beautifully shot. <BR>Julie Andrews is a delight as the plucky Maria, who starts as an erstwhile nun, becomes a governess, and earns the affections of the children of the steely Captain Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer, all poise and polish), not to mention the captain himself. The children are all properly cute and talented, and the supporting performances by Richard Haydn (the charming sponge Max Detweiler) and Eleanor Parker (Captain Von Trapp's would-be society fiancee) hit all the right notes. <BR>If the film has a weakness, it's length; \\"The Sound of Music\\" weighs in at almost three hours, which is quite a stretch by today's standards. In the original theatrical version, there was an intermission, which was common practice for long films in those days. <BR>There are also times that Wise plays it a bit too minimalistically, and the big finish should have more emotional punch than it does, but overall this film is an unqualified smash. <BR>It's worth noting that at the time of its release, \\"The Sound of Music\\" was wildly popular; in fact, adjusted for inflation, it's the third highest grossing film in history, behind only \\"Star Wars\\" and \\"Gone With The Wind\\".  Not bad company for this classic film.<br />This all-time favorite won five Academy Awards, including Best Picture.

6305308659|5.0|Very few movies these days can be called true \\"originals.\\" Especially nowadays when TV and comic books seem to be the main inspiration for film scripts. And this movie doesn't seem very original since it is clearly lampooning (honoring? In a small way) the early-fifties family sitcom genre made famous by \\"Father Knows Best\\" \\"Leave it to Beaver\\" and the like. But the film itself is original in the best possible way. It is a fantasy. It is one of the most wonderful answers to the eternal question \\"What if?\\" <br />Bickering siblings from the nineteen-nineties are zapped into Tobey Maguire's favorite TV show by a mysterious remote control, weilded by classic TV fave Don Knotts. At first Maguire digs livng the life of his TV idols, working at the Malt Shop and telling people his dad's new Buick is \\"Swell.\\" But when his sister (the usually annoying, but here quite well cast Reese Witherspoon) introduces sexuality into the equation, something mysteroius and wonderful happens in Pleasantville. Something that Maguire tries to stop at first until it occurs to him that \\"You can't stop something that's inside you.\\"<br />The script is superb, flawless to the last. The recreation of the TV show genre is meticulous, from the distant yet authoritative patriarch (a very funny, yet sadly mustacheless William H. Macy) to the energetic mother who lacks self-identity (the lovely Joan Allen), right down to Jeff Daniels as the malt shop owner who, if he disapeared on his way out of the shop it wouldn't surprise you at all.  But an English teacher once told me \\"There are no static characters, just static readers\\" and this story digs deeper into these character's minds and strikes pure gold. Top notch performances by the entire cast, particularly Daniels, Allen and Maguire, who really got himself on the map with this picture. And a pleasant surprise, Malcolm in the Middle's Jane Kaczmarack (that's probably spelled wrong) in a small but suitable role. <br />In short (a little late for that,I know) this movie is beautiful. The special effects will make you double take more than once, but the story itself shines thorugh like a candle behind a curtain. The beautiful story about life, happiness, and trusting your feelings.<br />Pleasant indeed.
0743517849|5.0|It may surprise many of you that the vast majority of millionaires interviewed by the authors of this book did not inherit their wealth, nor do they attribute their fortunes to luck. On the contrary, most of the now wealthy were ordinary people just 2 or 3 decades ago.  The majority lived beneath their means.  They did not choose to buy fancy cars; nor did they strap themselves financially by buying more house than they truly needed.  They were able to accumulate wealth, even though they were not the highest paid people in the country. They did not spend money to give the appearance of being rich.  They chose to plan for the future and worked hard at becoming financially independent. They achieved this goal by saving part of every paycheck, budgeting, and by paying careful attention to their investments. The authors assure us that we can do the same if we are willing to accept a not wasteful lifestyle. Saving and investing are mandatory, as wealth comes from accumulating growing assests and not from ever increasing salaries. This philosophy goes hand in hand with my recommending that investors learn about stock options, for those investment tools can be used by the prudent investor to make his portfolio safer.

0805062971|5.0|Now this is a very very very very very very VERY difficult thing to review. Enough people have read this book to decide whether they are going to be outraged by it or whether they'd rather just join their local chapter of Fight Club. If you haven't heard of this phenomenon, I can't think of what I would say here that would make you join up. But, I'll try.<br />The book is about an insomniac who meets an eccentric soap salesman disconcertingly called Tyler Durden. The two of them become close friends and their hobby of beating the living s**t out of each other becomes very popular among the white and blue collars of this world. Thus are a ring of underground clubs called &quot;Fight Club&quot; born. Our hero is living his life for the first time. But somewhere between Tyler taking things too far, his lingering feelings of materialism and a girl named Marla Singer, the protagonist finds himself in way over his head and sees no escape in sight.<br />People don't join Fight Club because they want to hurt people. They join Fight Club because they can't punch their bosses. They can't punch the president. But they gotta punch something. It's freedom. It's getting back to our basest instincts to a time when we didn't have to wear a tie to work. When we didn't have to wear a shirt to work. It's anarchist, it's revolutionary, and it's probably just the wakeup call you need. Between this and the movie (read seperate review) I know I have a whole new perspective on life.<br />But remember, the first rule of Fight Club is that you do not talk about Fight Club.<br />And the second rule of Fight Club is, you do NOT talk about Fight Club.<br />The third rule...
B00005OAIE|1.0|honestly, folks. i know there's been painfully little to satiate our folk-pop cravings of late, but have we gotten so desperate that john mayer sounds like five stars? things can't be that bad. <br />this album is so jam-packed with pretense it's a wonder mayer found room for some music. track after track we recieve rather obvious (and not terribly practical) observations and universalizations delivered with an absolute minimum of eloquence and style (witness the rhyming of \\"lungs\\" and \\"above\\" on the insufferably braggy single)<br />these songs might be better described as a random string of look-at-me-ma chords employed without any understanding of voice leading or the slightest hint of melody. jazz idioms can be worked into folk music quite successfully, but it requires a care and attention to detail that mayer is either unable or unwilling to give. why we're listening to him above the countless other self-proclaimed prophets haunting the world's coffeeshops is well beyond me.

B00006J3T4|5.0|Ragpicker's Dream is by far Mark Knopfler's best solo album.  Although not one single song on the album is better than Sailing to Philadelphia's &quot;What it is,&quot; the album as a whole is very strong.  &quot;Why Aye Man&quot; and &quot;Old Pigweed&quot; are, in my opinion, some of the better songs.  In general, Mark Knopfler does not get the credit and publicity that he deserves.  I encourage people to listen to any of the older Dire Straits albums as well as his previous solo album &quot;Sailing to Philadelphia,&quot; which is also quite good.  If you are not familiar with this material, you are in for a treat.

B00006FXB6|5.0|Wow.  I bought 'Rated R' because I kind of liked 'Feel Good Hit of the Summer' (who didn't?), and spent 4 hours bussing around Seattle looking for 'Songs for the Deaf' the day it came out.  Was I ever rewarded!  I'm not a big 'metal' fan (what does 'metal' mean anymore?), but I am in LOVE with this album.  Nick's vocals are great on the first track &quot;You think I Ain't Worth A Dollar But I Feel Like A Millionaire&quot;.  Try it in the car with the volume up-- way up.  Then leave the volume at that same level for the rest of the album.  It hasn't left my car in a month.  I got into QOTSA originally by way of Mark Lanegan, and I was rewarded for that on here as well. &quot;Hanging Tree&quot; is spooky and beautiful, and I swear that no matter what he sings about, Mark makes it the dirtiest, most longing love song ever-- just how I like 'em!  I would give this album to anyone who ever appreciated some really loud guitars and unexpectedly intelligent vocals.  God bless Josh Homme and Nick Olivieri for being the heart and soul (or is it throat and fingers?) of a great band.

B00003CX8Y|5.0|Some thoughts on the Blu-ray (which I've just watched on a 60\\" plasma)...<br /><br />There have been Horrible Arguments here about \\"Pinocchio\\", as to which (if any) of the various transfers most-accurately reflects the way the film originally looked 70 years ago -- or for that matter, whether one would /want/ a video transfer that looked like the original. (There are valid arguments in favor of \\"improvements\\".) Oddly, this version of \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" unquestionably \\"looks different\\" from the way it looked in the theater, or previous DVD versions.<br /><br />As is typical of many video transfers, there's a notable drop in contrast, which (combined with the high resolution) in this case makes subtleties of coloration and shading more-apparent. It also reduces the seeming \\"crudity\\" of some of the art and animation (\\"B&B\\" is far from the best-drawn or best-animated Disney feature), especially in the beast's rendition.<br /><br />One is also aware of changes in /lighting/. In the very opening, as Belle enters the village, we're aware that this is the \\"magic hour\\" of early morning (which gradually wears off as the sequence proceeds). I don't remember this from either the theatrical version or the DVD.<br /><br />In short... For those reading this in 2060... The Blu-ray /does not/ look exactly like the theatrical version. It is significantly \\"better\\", and probably closer to what the artists intended.<br /><br />This transfer is at 16:9, rather than the 1.85:1 of the previous DVD. This is an \\"overscan\\" of less than 7%, which isn't too bad. I would recommend viewing the film using your set's Dot-by-Dot setting.<br /><br />I haven't yet watched all the supplemental material, but the feature about the making of the film is excellent.<br /><br />This is such a handsome transfer that I have no hesitation recommending it, especially if you have a 50\\" or larger display.<br /><br />----------<br />There's no point in discussing the film itself, which made the People magazine list of 100 Greatest Films (winning over the Cocteau version after what was apparently a near-violent office fracas), other than to say it beats the Cocteau to a bloody pulp in every category (other than B&W cinematography!), and it's the only G-rated film with a song about homophobia. (It's interesting that the auteurs of both films were gay.)<br /><br />Serious movie viewers will be a bit surprised at the changes. Disney has widened the format from 1.66 to 1.85 by selective cropping. Although this provides enhanced vertical resolution on monitors with variable vertical scan, some of the scenes become a bit claustrophobic.<br /><br />ALL THREE versions have been reformatted to 1.85. This means the \\"original theatrical version\\" is _not_ the original. If you have the CAV LV, don't toss it.<br /><br />The color rendition (as in the case of the platinum \\"Snow White\\") is noticeably different. In some cases it comes closer to the artist's intentions (eg, Belle's blue dress versus the earth tones of the town), while in others it's more garish.<br /><br />The supplemental material is not up to that provided with \\"Snow White.\\" Too much of it is typical \\"Disney gush.\\"<br /><br />Nevertheless... I've been going to the movies for over 50 years, and this is still one of the very best films I've seen.

But that does not constitute a good reason to buy or even watch this movie. lots of action. minimal story. pretty useless. Go find a nice cheesy romance to watch with your special someone.

0316776963|5.0|Sedaris has a real gift for language.  Although according to the book, that langauge is decidedly not french.<br />The tales that comprise the first half of the book relate his childhood and family - they're the sort of absurd family everyone has but never really talks about.  They're an odd bunch, and Sedaris truly manages to make them seem larger-than-life even though you know deep-down they're no stranger than anyone else's clan.   Particularly howl-inducing is the story of his youngest brother, who has mystifyingly deisgnated himself &quot;the Rooster&quot; and is about as far at-odds with the rest of the family as could possibly be.  And yet, between the Rooster's foul language and rough manners, the sense of kinship between him and the clan's detatched patriarch si definitley conveyed in a heartfelt and stupifyingly funny manner.<br />Also notable is the vignette &quot;12 Moments in the Life of the Artist&quot; which self-deprecatingly plays on Sedaris's own artistic pretension and relates his daliances with art school, sculpting, methamphetamines and most terrifyingly conceptual and performance art.  An absolutely brilliant piece, he manages to skewer the whole performance art movement as well as his own silly notions of the artist lifestyle in one fell swoop.<br />The second half of the book details his life in France and his struggles with the language.  While slightly less emotionally attached than the first half of the book, it is often even funnier, with the ridiculous mangling of the french langauge, the odd things he learns to say (he studies medical french for fun), the aggressive and verbally abusive french teacher, and the difficulties with noun gender.<br />I've read this book a dozen times already and never does it fail to send me into fits.  Definitely one of my all-time favorites.

B000063K2W|5.0|The female of the species goes jungle red in tooth and claw in this brilliant screen adaptation of Claire Boothe Luce's famous Broadway play--a wickedly funny portrait of 1930s society women whose lives revolve around beauty treatments, luncheons, fashion shows, and each other's men.  Socialite Mary Haines is the envy of her set: rich, beautiful, and happily married... but when her husband steps out on her with a gold-digging perfume counter sales clerk, Mary's so-called friends dish enough dirt to make divorce inevitable whether Mary wants it or not.<br /><br />The script is wickedly, mercilessly funny, fast paced, razor sharp and filled with such memorable invective that you'll be quoting it for weeks and months afterward: \\"He says he'd like to do Sylvia's nails right down to the wrist with a buzz-saw;\\" \\"Why that old gasoline truck, she's sixty if she's a minute;\\" \\"Gimme a bromide--and put some gin in it!\\"  And the all-female cast, which includes every one from Cora Witherspoon to Butterfly McQueen to Hedda Hopper, plays it with tremendous spark.<br /><br />This was the last significant starring role for Norma Shearer, one of MGM's greatest stars of the 1930s, and she aquits herself very well as the much-wronged Mary Haines.  But the real winners are the members of the supporting cast.  Joan Crawford is truly astonishing as Crystal Allen, the shop girl who leads Mary's husband astray, and Rosalind Russell gives an outrageously funny performance as the back-biting gossip whose nasty comments precipitate Mary's divorce.  Indeed, it is hard to do anything except rave about the entire the cast, which includes such diverse performers as Marjorie Main, Paulette Goddard, Joan Fontaine, and Lucille Watson.  Even the smallest bit parts score with one-liners that have the impact of a slap in the face, and director George Cukor does an incredible job of keeping everything and every one in sharp focus.<br /><br />Perhaps one of the most interesting things about THE WOMEN is the way in which director Cukor ties the behavior of its characters to their social status. Possessed of absolute leisure and considerable wealth, their energies are inevitably directed into competition for the ultimate status symbol: a successful man.  Cukor allows us to sympathize with Mary (Shearer) and laugh at Sylvia (Russell), but he also requires us to pity them--and indirectly encourages gruding admiration for the devious Crystal (Crawford) and the savvy Miriam (Goddard), characters who are considerably more self-reliant.  Consequently, not only does THE WOMEN paint a poisoniously funny portait of women as a sex, it takes a hatchet to the society that has shaped their characters as well.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this landmark comedy has not received the full benefit of what DVD offers.  Although the print is crisp, the film has not been restored, and the extras are spurious and hardly do the film justice; while I would recommend the DVD simply because you're likely to wear out a VHS, the DVD has no great advantage over the VHS release.  But whether you have it on VHS or DVD, this is one title that you must have in your collection: you'll watch it again and again.

B00006AG5N|5.0|My kids were already big Elvis fans from the Lilo &amp; Stitch (Disney movie) soundtrack which has five Elvis tunes; four sung by Elvis and one (&quot;Burning Love&quot;) by Wynnona Judd.  (They had also seen several Elvis impersonators at stage shows in Las Vegas, so they could already attach a &quot;persona&quot; to the music.)  Elvis 30 #1 Hits only made them even bigger Elvis fans.<br />This album has everyone's favorites.  My kids love &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot; and &quot;Stuck on You&quot; (which are also on Lilo &amp; Stitch).  My favorites are &quot;Are You Lonesome Tonight?&quot; and &quot;It's Now or Never.&quot;  And my kids always get a big kick out of daddy lip-sync serenading &quot;I Can't Help Falling In Love&quot; -- to mommy!<br />They are still too young to understand Elvis' impact on popular music.  (I tell them Elvis was the Eminem of his day, but that doesn't work either.)<br />They love just about every tune on this immensely satisfying disc.  The only song they don't like is &quot;Burning Love.&quot;  They like Wynnona's (nearly identical) rendition better.<br />I guess 29 out of 30's not bad, huh?
B0000640VN|5.0|Leopold (Hugh Jackman), a very handsome duke from 1876 finds himself waking up in Stuart's apartment in the 21st century in New York. Stuart who has been tampering with time portals accidentally brought Leopold back with him. Stuart's ex-girlfriend, Kate McKay (Meg Ryan) who is an independent career woman and stays just below in the same apartment gets romantically involved with Leopold. It is so touching to see Kate being swept off her feet by this 19th century gentleman! There are many parts that will make you laugh and some parts that are so sentimental that you may cry too. Hugh Jackman's acting is very good and Meg Ryan is her usual self. So if you are her fan, you will definitely enjoy this movie. Overall, a very nice movie to watch.
0316666343|5.0|I have read some harsh reviews.  I have also read some reviews were people were selfish enough to give away some of the story.  That said, I am an avid reader.  I read 2-3 books per week.  The Lovely Bones is an excellent book.  You grow to know the characters and care about what happens to them.  I found them all very believable and unique in their reactions to the crime.  I have passed this book around to 6 friends, one of them male, and everyone loved it.  Buy this book, you wont regret it.
B0000640VO|5.0|Before I watched it , I did not read reviews in purpose - Just wanted to be surprised . I was wrong ! Before you se it - make shure , it is right film for you , or you might hate it . If you are not a romantic \\" dreamer \\" ; if you never cryed while watching a movie ; if you never felt sorry for Tom , brutally destroied by Jerry ; if you think , that \\" Dumb and Dumber \\" is the best comedy of all times - DO NOT watch this film ! <BR> O'Key , if you are still reading my review - you are in the right place . It is kind of slow film , but I didn't mind - I just relaxed and and enjoy it . Very romantic , absolutly wonderful ( THE perfect word for it ) movie . Very unusual and surprising camerawork . What is not a big surprise for you , if you seen other films by Jean-Pierre Jeunet ( City of Lost Children , Alien 4 ). Only this time he opens his another side for us - the sentimental one . And he gives it to us thru Emelie. Who just desided one day to start helping everybody around her . And trust me - she is very good and funny at it . And of couse , the love she gave - came back to her .
B00003CWL5|3.0|Boy, am I getting tired of this kind of movie.<br />Every few years a film comes along designed to skewer the supposed \\"complacency\\" of middle America.  You know, we're all a bunch of shallow, crass, materialistic, out-of-touch, hypocritical phonies who've failed to connect with the \\"beauty\\" of everyday life.<br />A few years ago, it was \\"The Ice Storm.\\"  Bored American suburbanite couples contemplating adultery.  An alienated teen-age daughter who romances the misfit/social outcast boy next door.  Recreational drug use to underscore the general sense of ennui.  Then, at the end, somebody dies, and that tragedy is supposed to imbue the movie with resonance and meaning.<br />Or did I just describe \\"American Beauty\\"?  Oh, well, doesn't matter.  In another few years, another filmmaker will crank out another cinematic screed along the same lines, and no doubt that film will wow critics and win multiple awards as well.<br />The real tragedy of \\"American Beauty\\" is that the script had real potential.  If you ever had the opportunity to read Alan Ball's screenplay (available on the Internet), you're in for what they call in Hollywood \\"a good read.\\"  Ball is an exceptionally gifted writer and has a real ear for dialogue.  My problem is with the film's direction.  Others have raved about Sam Mendes.  Kindly include me out on that score: his direction reeks to high heaven.  Rather than working to flesh out his characters, he portrays his characters as unsympathetic cartoons.  Spacey, Bening (lord, especially Bening) and several other, ahem, \\"actors\\" give screeching, eye-bulging, over-the-top, look-ma-I'm-in-a-movie type performances.  Mena Suvari's turn as the would-be high school nympho wouldn't get past the first round of a casting call for the TV version of \\"Clueless.\\"  Only Thora Birch (a long underrated actress) and newcomer Wes Bentley manage to give sympathetic, humanistic performances.  The rest of the cast seems to think it's in an episode of \\"Hogan's Heroes.\\" <br />And therein lies the problem.  This is one of those movies that isn't funny enough to rate as a good comedy yet doesn't take itself seriously enough to work as drama.  Spacey gets a few funny lines (okay, he gets all the funny lines) but that's essentially it.<br />By contrast, Robert Redford's \\"Ordinary People\\" back in 1980 (written by Alvin Sargent) also tackled the subjects of loveless marriage, alienated youth, angst in suburbia, and so forth, but it did so with a great sense of compassion for its lead characters.  Deep down, \\"American Beauty\\" has contempt for its characters, and for that reason the film never really connects.  It would be like having the makers of \\"Amos & Andy\\" direct \\"Roots\\".  The filmmakers were so blinded by their desire to give suburbia the cinematic finger that they missed the opportunity to explore real human emotions.<br />Maybe they should have looked closer.

Yeah, I have often wanted to skip the whole Christmas ordeal, too.<br />Just the thought of skipping Christmas relieves the stress, but I never thought about the ramifications.  John Grisham has delightfully presented the awkwardness associated with breaking a tradition.<br />And, as to the anonymous reviewer that said such horrible things about John Grisham's &quot;Skipping Christmas&quot; book:  Have you never met a person with more than one talent?

0316666343|5.0|I bought this book after noticing a review of it in the New York Times.  Now, Alice Sebold is one of my favorite authors.  Her ability to tell a story in a simple way is remarkable.  She does not clutter each chapter with unnecessary detail, nor does she overdescribe each character.  Enough information is revealed to give the reader a good sense of what was going on while letting the imagination do all the rest.  Most importantly, I could not put this book down.  It has given me a fresh new outlook on life and afterlife, which I think we all could use in these times we live in.  After reading The Lovely Bones, I read Lucky and enjoyed it as well.  Keep your eyes on this author.  She is extraordinary.

As always, another MIB is absolutely welcome because so far, they have both been comedically entertaining.  Will Smith was georgous (a talented actor too), and Tommy Lee Jones was excellent.  I liked the dog (obviously, screening did this producer wonders) and the fact that he had a larger role this time.  <br />All in all?  You wont be regretting this purchase.

B00006J9OT|5.0|After seeing Diana Krall in concert last Spring, I was amazed at the breadth of her talent. While I love her studio CDs, she really shines in concert. Her improvization  with the band is a whole different experience. The songs are longer, more sultry, and showcase her tremendous vocal and piano playing talent. The only song missing from this CD is &quot;Cry Me A River&quot;. I look forward to finding this one on a future live perfromance.
B000001DQI|5.0|Elton John eventually became known as a purveyor of melodious but fairly unremarkable popular ballads.  This album is a vivid reminder of a brief period when his creative range was almost as great as any popular recording artist of the rock era, including the Beatles.  The variety of musical styles and emotional atmospheres on this album is truly astonishing, and on top of that, all of the tracks are accessible and fun to listen to.<br />This album is best known for the mega-hits on it:  &quot;Bennie and the Jets&quot;, the title track, and &quot;Saturday Night's All Right for Fighting.&quot;  Though anyone who has been awake for the last thirty years is more than familiar with all three, it's worth remembering how unusual these hits were.<br />&quot;Bennie and the Jets&quot; begins with nothing more than the down-beats of its now familiar march:  Thump. Thump. Thump. Thump. Perhaps only someone who has dabbled in pop song writing can appreciate the maturity and audacity it takes to write a song in that way, and to resist the temptation to have *something* going on, anything, on the piano or on the drums or somewhere, between the beats.  Elton combines an appropriate melody with Taupin's lyrics that perfectly capture the adolescent rush of excitement over the latest pop sensation, and the result is a true pop classic.<br />&quot;Goodbye Yellow Brick Road,&quot; too, is more original than usually credited.  Both the verse and chorus melodies are extremely strong, but they are combined in a very unexpected way:  &quot;my future lies, beyond the yellow brick Ro-o-oad.  Ah-ah-ah-ah&quot; etc.  What possibly inspired Elton, instead of simply ending the verse as any typical composer would, to immediately splice its last note over to the first note of a very different and seemingly unrelated melody altogether?  And yet it works seamlessly.<br />The album is also loaded with a number of lesser hits -- &quot;Love Lies Bleeding,&quot; &quot;Grey Seal,&quot; and &quot;Harmony&quot; among them, each of them quite good.  This description also applied to &quot;Candle in the Wind,&quot; typical of the album's emotionally precise gems before it later exploded into a monster hit on its own.  &quot;Funeral For a Friend&quot; is the album's ethereal, strange instrumental introduction, and it, too, has made many appearances over the years in many forums.  I'm convinced that it was the inspiration for ELO's &quot;Fire On High,&quot; a similarly pervasive instrumental that borrows heavily from &quot;Funeral&quot;'s mysterious elements.<br />Surrounding all of this great work, though, are little known songs that cover a vast variety of feelings and which are among the finest things Elton ever recorded.  One of my favorites is &quot;Roy Rogers,&quot; a sensitive waltz-ballad about a middle-aged man who escapes from the drudgery of his domestic and professional life by watching Roy Rogers every night on TV after his family goes to bed.  Elton's composition and his performance capture perfectly the contradictory emotions of the scene -- the genuine euphoria of the escape into Wild West fantasy, and the tedium of daily life.  It's a wonderful, poignant piece.<br />One of the finest cuts on the album is &quot;Sweet Painted Lady,&quot; sung about a prostitute in a seaside town who services sailors.  Elton's composition on this one mimics some of the conventions of seaside music halls, again with emotionally complex results.  The tune is simultaneously cynical but sympathetic, and the recorded sounds of seagulls and waves don't sound gimmicky at all, simply because the music is so perfect to the scene.<br />&quot;This Song Has No Title&quot; is a typical minor gem on the record; it's unpretentious and short, and the lyrics document a young mind's hunger for adventure and beauty.  A short cut, but very nice.<br />Even the album's siller fare really shows off Elton's compositional virtuousity -- Jamacia Jerk-off, Social Disease.  Sometimes it seems like theearly Elton had a greater command of different piano styles -- gospel, honky tonk, rag, and so forth.  It's this album on which that diversity of styles is accompanied by equally diverse other instrumentation and a lot of lyrical emotional power.  <br />There haven't been many albums by any artists that are as good as this one.  It's one of the few double albums on which the output is top-notch from start to finish.

For the star Julie Andrews and the cast, this film has solidified its place in history. <BR>The magnitude of this film to be undertaken back when cinematography was in its beginning phase and to overcome the obstacles of a foreign country. There were political issues that had to be addressed. The house that was depicted as Mr. von  Trapp's house was really an official building and had to be repainted the special yellow that is used to signify official buildings. <BR>On the issue of the family being brought back to life by Marie through the use of song and music is what I connected with immediately. For Maria to prove that things can change by going against the rules, takes her out of the role of an ordinary governess. Secondly, in my opinion, having the setting of the Austrian mountains as the set of the movie, just makes cry. Why is that so? Because, I participated in the tour of Sound of Music and seen the country side of Austria when I was stationed in Europe. <br />I cannot be fair to this movie and not give it five stars for the depth of this film.

B00000K19E|5.0|Based in the future after computers have taken over the world a computer hacker, NEO is trying to save to the living world.  This is a classic story of the loaner who steps up to the plate and saves the day.  The charater development is excellent, the cinematopgraphy is cutting edge and the acting is great from everyone, including the extras.  Although you know how the movie will end the trip there is full of unexpected twist.  Even after seeing this movie numerous times I still get excited, all over again, at some of the best parts of this movie.  This is one of the few movies I keep watching over and over again.
B00005QDW1|5.0|No Doubt has maintained a fairly original style of music. They mix rock and reggae which is fresh and pleasing. Lead singer Gwen Stefani creates a fun and wild sound with her unique style of singing. Rock Steady consists of several moods which showcase the group's musical range. The songs &quot;In my head&quot; and &quot;Waiting room&quot; prove to be somewhat weak and dissapointing with their constant repeating of lyrics to a bothersome extent. &quot;Waiting room&quot; just never seems to get anywhere in terms of its lyrics. On the other hand the songs &quot;hey baby&quot; and &quot;hella good&quot; were put together very well. The energy and beat is inspirational. Although this album does have a fun, perky, and entertaining vibe, overall, it does not have any groundbreaking material. This band has nothing to prove, they are just in it to have fun and make music, and they do a great job at it.
B00005221M|3.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all times.  It should have won an acadamy award.  The cinamatography is gorgeous, the actors perfect, and this is one movie that is actually better than the book in my opinion but, where the heck did the beautiful song go?  I bought the DVD expecting more not less of my beloved movie and I feel totally [upset]. I won't watch the DVD again it is simply ruined for me.  For anybody who has'nt seen this great movie, get the VHS!
B000000OQF|5.0|The masters of the metal bands have done it...marked their place in history of Rock-N-Roll. Of course im talking about the irreplaceable Guns-N-Roses c.d. \\"Appetite for Destuction.\\" This c.d. is a crazy ride through the jungle of 80's metal music, including smash hits \\"welcome to the jungle,\\" \\"paradise city\\" and \\"sweet child o'mine\\" prove that this c.d. is a prime example of what real music sounds like. With Axl Rose on lead vocals, Duff \\"Rose\\" McKagan on the bass, Steven Adler on the drums and Izzy Stradlin playing along with the master of the strings himself SLASH! You can't afford to not pick up this c.d. with the explicit lyrics of Axl Rose and mind numbing guitar solos by Slash you aren't going to want to miss any of this action. This is by far the bets work done by these youg talnted masters of the metal realm. The c.d. is and always will be a classic and will never leave your c.d. collection.<br />release date:1987<br />company:Geffen
B00003CXAE|3.0|I wasn't too sure about Grease right off the bat and don't really remember falling in love with the movie right away. Though when I was older I have respect and a very much liking for it. When I went to see the stage play in DC I always liked the Broadway Play better then the movie. However, the movie is a pretty great addition to the teenage-musical-era. John Travolta does a pretty amazing job singing and dancing as Danny, one of the head Greasers. And Olivia Newton John does an excellent job pulling off playing sweet and loving Sandy, and then to wild Sandy at the end of the movie. They also make the perfect pair for this movie. The rest of the cast is quite incrediable and memorable as well. This movie will always be a classic and beloved. And I don't think I need to say what it's about because the name speeks for itself :) everyone should know what it's about.<br />The only thing I was disappointed in is the DVD quality. I was expecting a lot more, and apparently everyone else was too. It has a pretty good interviews with some of the cast from Grease but it's nothing we haven't heard about before. And a theaterical trailer. And then of course the movie. As much as they advertised Grease coming out on DVD it's pretty much a slight disappointment especially it being the 20th Anniversary of Grease you just expect a lot more.<br />However, I would give the movie about a B+ - C+ and a DVD about a C-.
B000000OS2|5.0|This cd is awesome. Tesla recorded this live acoustic before the beginning of the show \\"MTV unplugged\\" but it's in the same spirit. \\"five man acoustic jam\\" is for me the best of Tesla. the versions of \\"the way it is\\", \\"before my eyes\\", \\"paradise\\", \\"love song\\" and \\"modern day cowboy\\" are among the best acoustic-rock songs ever. Frank Hanon plays the kind of guitar-solos you want to listen 5 times in a row (at least!!!)... conclusion, if you like rock and acoustic guitar, you can't go wrong with that album...
B00003CWL6|5.0|This movie unfolds much like a documentary on everything that is wrong with America. The story begins with Kevin Spacey's narrative that this is his story of the last year or so of his life. So we start out already knowing that his character, Lester, has died for some reason. It is based on the lives of 2 families, and I think alot of personalities are represented. The over-bearing, prudish wife who is concerned only with appearances and what people think of her. She is repressing her true feelings to fool everyone, and herself, that she is happy with her life. She has forgotten how to laugh. Lester is the husband that needs to regain his self respect and stop living just to survive. Their daughter, Janie, is trying to deal with being different, fitting in and trying to find out who she is. Her friend, Angela, awakens something in Lester and makes him realize that there is more to life then trying to please everyone else. The next-door neighbors has the ex-army, homophobic man, who is more of an abusive drill sargent then a husband and father. He is a hateful person and clearly fears his own true feelings. His son is the one who helps awake Janie and show her the true beauty in life. I think this movie shows how destructive conformity and lack of self-expression is. We live with a great deal of this in this country. We are taught through religion or other means to feel guilt for natural feelings and to conform to what people think of as &quot;acceptable&quot;. At the ending of the movie, we witness that society's violence begins at the place where creativity and self-expression is controlled. The surreal vibe of the movie is brought to life with a haunting musical score and sprinkled with dark and witty humor. Of coarse Kevin Spacey gives a spectacular performance. I am sure people will get different meanings from this movie, but this is what I got out of it. Learn to accept yourself and enjoy finding your beauty.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Band of Brothers is an HBO original series, based on the book of the same name by historian Stephen Ambrose. It is the true story of a company of American warriors in World War II - E (Easy) Company of the 506th Infantry Regiment, a component of the famed 101st Airborne Division. Band of Brothers is based in large part on the accounts of surviving members of that group. It follows the men of Easy Company from their gruelling training at Camp Toccoa, Georgia, through their airborne drop into France on D-Day; their involvement in Operation Market Garden and the Battle of the Bulge (where they gained great notoriety as the \\"battered bastards of Bastogne\\"); their conquest of Hitler's Eagle's Nest; and the end of the war. <br />If you've seen Stephen Spielberg's fictional World War II epic Saving Private Ryan, you already have some inkling of the horror and constant peril accompanying the allies' assault on Fortress Europe in 1944. Ambrose's true account of the remarkable soldiers of the 101st Airborne will leave you wondering how any of these fellows survived at all. That they not only survived but achieved victory is a tribute to their training and their hardihood, but most of all their devotion to one another. The title is based on Henry Plantagenet's battlefield oration to his outnumbered and beleaguered men on St. Crispian's Day in Shakespeare's Henry V: <br />\\"He that outlives this day, and comes safe home, Will stand a tip-toe when the day is named, and rouse him at the name of Crispian. He that shall live this day, and see old age, Will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbours, and say 'To-morrow is Saint Crispian:' Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars and say 'These wounds I had on Crispin's day....'This story shall the good man teach his son; and Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by, from this day to the ending of the world, but we in it shall be remember'd - we few, we happy few, we band of brothers. For he to-day that sheds his blood with me shall be my brother....\\"<br />Band of Brothers is permeated by that same sense of comradeship through shared danger - of glory based not on conquest but on the loyalty of ordinary men one to another. Saving Private Ryan alumni Spielberg and Tom Hanks are the Executive Producers of the 11-episode HBO series, and Hanks is the Executive Director as well (in which capacity he directed one episode, co-wrote another, and closely oversaw the whole production). Spielberg's influence is evident in the look and feel of the work; but where Saving Private Ryan is austere and ultimately repelling, Band of Brothers is warmer, more accessible - more personal. One of the most successful features of the series is that each episode begins with reminiscences of one or more survivors. As the series progresses, you come to know these old guys and like them enormously. When the whole thing is over, you feel you really have seen the war through their eyes. <br />\\"We sweated bullets in order to achieve authenticity,\\" Hanks said in an interview with the BBC. \\"There are two types of authenticity. What's relatively easy to accomplish are things like making sure the buttons on the uniforms are right, the ammunition is correct and the locations look like they looked in the photograph. The thing that's much harder is the motivation and the nature of the interplay between the characters. So we were always forcing every moment of every page of the script through this sieve of authenticity. We said, 'look, if we can't be sure what they said and did at any given moment, we must at least capture the emotional reality of being there.\\"<br />Successful acting in a miniseries, especially one as long as this one, is really a different enterprise than in a two-hour production at the cineplex. Dynamism and inventiveness are less important to a performance than subtlety and sustained character development. (Do you really want to watch a dozen hours of Dennis Hopper as Frank Booth? Didn't think so.) Judged by that standard, the performances in Band of Brothers are very fine indeed. Damian Lewis, the young British actor who stars as Captain (later Major) Richard Winters, painstakingly reveals a new facet of Winters' adamantine character with each successive episode. In the role of battalion intelligence officer Lewis Nixon, Ron Livingston beautifully portrays Nixon's gradual descent into despair and alcoholism. Supporting performances of note include Donnie Wahlberg as Carwood Lipton, Frank John Hughes as Bill Guarnere, and Rick Gomez as George Luz. The miniseries' other production values - soundtrack, effects, cinematography, constumes, etc. - are likewise top notch. <br />There are a few flaws in the series. The earlier episodes in particular sometimes drag a bit. There is also a tendency from time to time to toss in a little melodrama, some small \\"moment\\" that is the war movie equivalent to the rising organ notes at the end of a 60s soap opera. Generally, though, the filmmakers resist such temptations to yank on the heartstrings. That is especially appreciated in parts like episode 9, \\"Why We Fight,\\" in which Easy Company stumbles across a concentration camp for the first time. The encounter is handled with a degree of restraint that makes the shock and enormity of the discovery all the more affecting...
0316666343|3.0|I must say, the opening line of The Lovely Bones totally hooked me, and I did enjoy reading portions of this book. Ms.Sebold definitely has a poet's talent with words, though it is my opinion that at times less would be more. Even so, I feel she is an emerging talent.  That said, I can not for the life of me see how this novel managed to hit the New York Times top ten list, with so many other great books out there!  Perhaps it is because of the Times review, which called it refreshing and unique ~ written from the grave in the voice of the victim, or something to that effect. For those that did not enjoy it, but found the novel approach of being written from the grave compelling, I recommend Roseflower Creek by J. L. Miles which debuted in September 2001. It, too, is written from the grave in the voice of the victim, in this case, ten-year-old Lori Jean, who dies at the hands of her step-daddy in l950's rural Georgia.  A tale of the loss of innocence, like Lovely Bones, it also celebrates the power of forgiveness, but does so in such a compelling manner that the reader can't help but know the journey was worth it. For those of you readers that did enjoy The Lovely Bones, and I believe I fall somewhere in between those that did and those that didn't, I again recommend Roseflower Creek.  What hooked you in on The Lovely Bones, will take your breath away in Roseflower Creek. I guess what I am saying is, I liked reading The Lovely Bones okay, but I absolutely loved Roseflower Creek, and can not get Lori Jean out of my head. The last character I felt that way about was Scout in To Kill A Mockingbird.  My girlfriend Rebekah feels exactly the same. I'd like to hear from other readers comparing the two. So, please buy both, read both and don't be shy. Write a review.
B00005JK8K|1.0|Synopsis: In the Pacific theatre in World War II, the U.S. armed services developed a secure radio code based on the Navajo language. Navajo servicemen recruited as radio operators, or \\"codetalkers,\\" were assigned guards to protect them and the vital code they carried - or kill them if they were in imminent danger of capture by the Japanese. Windtalkers tells the story of Marine codetalker (Adam Beach) and the sergeant assigned to guard him (Nicholas Cage) as they participate in the invasion of Saipan. It also follows a similar relationship between another codetalker (Roger Willie) and his protector (Christian Slater). <br />Joe Enders is a guy with a lot on his mind. First, there is the guilt. As a corporal in the Solomon Islands invasion, Enders abruptly inherited a small unit command when both his superiors were killed - and then just as quickly lost all his men in a Japanese counterattack. The lone survivor of the attack, he is sent to a naval hospital in Hawaii to recuperate, but he conceals a painful injury in order to return to combat. Instead of being allowed to return to the front lines, Joe is assigned to protect a wet-behind-the-ears codetalker named Ben Yahzee. Already traumatized by failing to save his old unit, Joe is in no mood to make friends with Ben, knowing that he might someday be forced to kill him in order to protect the code he carries. You know just where this movie is going. <br />There's a point somewhere in Windtalkers when the viewer begins to ask questions. And that's not a good thing. Like, with about a bazillion Marines on Saipan, how come there aren't any officers? You've got a gunnery sergeant (Peter Stormare) running what appears to be about a battalion of guys. No knock on sergeants, but I don't think that's the way it's supposed to work, even in the Marine Corps. And at the end of the movie, when a couple hundred Marines with tanks, trucks, and such are getting the snot kicked out of them by Japanese artillery: why is it up to onelone codetalker - in an entirely different location, separated from his radio and pinned down under fire - to call in an air strike? You mean to tell me there isn't a single radio in that whole convoy of beleaguered grunts? How are they communicating with each other, semaphore? I guess that's what happens when you don't have any officers around. <br />And there are other questions that are ultimately more ruinous to the success of this movie. What is the story about? The codetalkers? Joe Enders? The contrasting relationships between the codetalkers and their protectors? The conquest of Saipan? And how does any sort of relationship develop between Enders and the people in his life when he doesn't say two words to anyone? Early in the movie, the obligatory beautiful nurse (Frances O'Connor) falls for Joe, cares for him, pursues him with unanswered letters throughout the rest of the film - and he never gives her the time of day. Why does she bother? For that matter, it's hard to see why anyone does anything they do in this picture. Characters turn about-face in attitude and behavior so often at the whim of the plot that there must have been a minor epidemic of whiplash during the filming. <br />Even that wouldn't be such a bad thing if the plot were worth all the contrivances necessary to advance it. Unfortunately, Windtalkers is an encyclopedia of the hoariest war movie cliches: the haunted soldier who watched others die due to his mistakes; the medical condition (call it \\"Old Movie Disease\\") that debilitates the hero while somehow allowing him to fight on; the bigoted antagonist who is brought around to see the light; the young newcomer who proves his worth to the unit by an act of stupendous bravery; and so on. <br />Windtalkers is cliched visually as well. War films like Saving Private Ryan, Black Hawk Down, and HBO's Band of Brothers have raised the bar when it comes to realism and viewer involvement. In their wake, John Woo's trademark pyrotechnic style seems dated, even quaint, and his material trivial. <br />The biggest problem with Windtalkers, though, is Nicholas Cage. Cage is capable of being a very fine actor with a good emotional range, as evidenced by roles in movies as varied as Leaving Las Vegas and Moonstruck. Here, though, he seems clearly uncomfortable in a monotonous, clench-jawed performance as Joe Enders. The script, by John Rice and Joe Batteer, is execrable; but a lower-key actor like Billy Bob Thornton could probably have redeemed it somewhat by injecting a bit more nuance than Cage can summon. The rest of the casting is uneven as well, with Stormare particularly distracting as a Swede trying to fake an American accent. <br />The wartime contribution of the Navajo codetalkers is interesting grist for a movie. It's too bad Windtalkers doesn't come near to doing it justice.
B00006AG5N|5.0|Having only liked a few Elvis's slower songs I decided to pick up this cd. I am quite impressed with it. I never thought Id dig Elvis as much as I do now. Its no wonder he's so legendery. What to pick up next.
B000001DTM|5.0|I hope anyone is not seriously contemplating getting this album, do yourself a big favor, BUY IT.  This album quite frankly was too good.  It raised the standard for everything else.  Get into the songs that did not make radio play such as Acrobat, Ultraviolet etc,,,just go sit in front of a HIFI system and let this baby rock you out.  Its sexy, dark, uplifting, feel good  stuff.  I think this is the best album of all time.  Im a huge music fan, into Classical, Coldplay, U2 of cource, Radiohead, Floyd, Doors, Enya etc.  I know my music, this without doubt is brilliant.  Every track.
0060934700|3.0|Being a huge fan of Gaiman's novels I bought this book just to see some of his earlier works. Most of the stories are pointless and don't go anywhere. Diehard fans would give 5 stars for anything he released, so don't go by most reviews. I highly suggest you read a few pages of this before purchasing. If you were totally in awl after American Gods, Neverwhere, and Coraline, don't expect that much brilliance in this <BR>collection. There are two or three stories which are quite impressive but the rest just seemed wish washy and falls short.
B000002UAX|4.0|I want to give this five stars because it is a great album, but the inclusion of  the following forces my hand:<br />Wild Honey Pie<BR>Piggies<BR>Rocky Raccoon<BR>Why Don't We Do It In The Road<BR>Revolution 9<br />While the rest of this album is amazing, these songs are out of place and in some cases, annoying.  Enough about them.  Let's get to the good stuff.  Despite its rather incoherant rambling assortment of tunes, the &quot;White Album&quot; has some stunning music.<br />Dear Prudence: has there ever been a more beautiful song than this?  One of the high points of the Beatles career.<BR>While My Guitar Gently Weeps:  One of George's best.<BR>Blackbird: now a standard being covered by everyone from Manhattan Transfer to rock bands.<BR>Julia: Gorgeous.  Music for a late night or a rainy day.<BR>Helter Skelter:  The Beatles at full-bore.  A great rocker.<BR>Long, Long, Long: A beauty of a soft song.<BR>Mother Nature's Son:  Great guitar work and an almost Irish/Gaelic melody.  Another of the Beatles best songs.<br />There are plenty of other gems here to explore as well.  Of all the Beatles albums, this is definitely one of the five must-haves.
0780629450|5.0|Kenneth Branagh's HAMLET is the best film adaption of Shakespeare's play I've ever seen. A &quot;definitive&quot; version will never be made, just as there has never been a definitive production of it in the theatre. It is up to each director, whether in cinema or theatre, to give us their own interpretation of the text. And with each new version, we learn something new about the tragedy of Hamlet. <br />Branagh's take on the play is the most interesting and significant since Laurence Olivier's, although they are very different films. Personally I feel that Branagh has made the superior adaption, not only because of the inclusion of every word spoken, but also because of his understanding and insight into the play. He is able to give each scene a new visual context and really transport the audience into the drama. I won't go into the specifics regarding the interpretation of the play, except to say that Branagh's is less oedipal than most other HAMLET adaptions, and in a sense, is truer to the text. But that is undoubtedly a matter of taste, and how one personally views the play.<br />As far as the acting is concerned, there is nothing but high marks for everyone. Dereck Jacobi is astounding as Claudius, and gives us a really fleshed out character, whom the audience can develope empathy for, rather than the sterotypical 'villain' we usually see. Kate Winslet is equally good as Ophelia, playing her as an independant woman with a mind of her own, rather than the fragile, unstabil young girl we usually see. Julie Christie makes an admirable Gertrude, and manages to portray the queen as more than a vain and selfish woman, but as someone with a real sense of duty towards her country and affection for Claudius.     <BR>But the real star of the show is naturally Kenneth Branagh as Hamlet. He is undoubtedly the greatest Hamlet of his generation, and in my opinion delivers a more complete and nuanced performance than even Olivier and Jacobi gave us. But again, a matter of taste. <br />Adding to the sensational performances we have the amazing visuals and Patrick Doyle's finest score to date. Doyle is able to elevate and penetrate Shakespeare's poetry with an effectiveness and ease which has not been seen, or heard, since Walton.<br />All in all, I'd say HAMLET is Kenneth Branagh's supreme cinematic achievement. He has made a HAMLET for the modern age; one that is relevant and accessible to a modern audience without being condescending or un-Shakesperean. A film which will no doubt live in the memory of many people for years to come.
B00006690G|5.0|Eminem and his mentor, Dr. Dre, have created his third album, \\"The Eminem Show\\". It is an excellent album; in fact it is better than his previous ones. It has excellent music and lyrics but it has one thing in common to all of Eminem's earlier albums, his loud and straightforward way of singing the lyrics. He uses this fantastic style to sing almost every song and every song is somehow related to his life. For example \\"cleanin out my closet\\" features his difficult relation with his mother and \\"superman\\" features his terrible relationship he had with his ex-wife, Mariah. ...
0790737345|5.0|I love this movie. I cried like a baby for the first time in forever when I saw it in the theater, and I've cried every time I've seen it since. It's a classic. It's made like they used to make movies. The acting is amazing, the whole movie is just a thing of beauty. It's a love story from the old school of filmmaking.<br />Nicholas Cage is an angel, and like all angels he's invisible,  dresses in black and hangs around high places and the city library. Meg Ryan is a doctor, and she's completely stressed out.
B00006CXSS|5.0|war movie (mini-series) ever created.  You really get to know all the actors and the special effects and attention to detail in uniforms and equipment is unbelievable.
0316666343|5.0|An excellent heartbreaking, yet soul-lifting, book. This chilling view from heaven is better than I expected. A moving, sentimental, heartwrenching story. And, much like Norman Thomas Remick's &quot;West Point&quot; (a book I also loved, but in a different way), it is a unique and fascinating presentation that you should certainly try not to miss.
6305350205|4.0|This movie is more Star Trek than a lot of the other movies or series.  Lets all remember that the original pilot was rejected for being &quot;too cerebral.&quot;  Star Trek only became an action/adventure type show/movie to survive commercially and make it on the air.  At its heart Star Trek is a deep exploration of the human condition and Star Trek V makes a fine contribution to this.  All too often latter day trekkies (or trekkers as the too-refined-for-their-own-good modern fans call themselves) focus on the technology, sensuality, and action of Star Trek while ignoring the greater messages within.  The movie's message is,  &quot;Happiness is where you find it, and painful experiences are as much a part of your personality as joyous experiences.&quot;<BR>Watch it, its a fine movie.
B00003CXTG|1.0|I wasnt expecting this film to be a comedy, but the wooden cliche ridden acting admittedly had much of the audience in hysterics, despite the serious subject of war that lies somewhere within this extended soap opera. Seen from a British perspective, this film may not have quite the same relevance as it does to the target audience, but one line in particular stands out as the work of a scripting genius; the RAF bloke saying to Affleck \\"if all Americans are like you god help anyone who starts a war with you\\" (or something to that effect). Pleeeease. Another pointer to the inept directer of this pile of tripe; not showing the stars and stripes EVERY five minutes may save upwards of 20min film time, and therefore allow some sort of plot development, or other minor detail that is normally a prerequisite for a movie.
B00006690G|4.0|\\"Guess who's back...back again...Shady's back...tell a friend...\\"  Eminem has done it again with his new album \\"The Eminem Show.\\"  I'd give \\"The Eminem Show\\" four out of five  stars.  The lyrics are not as offensive to people as they were in his last albums.  This CD is full of awesome beats and rhythms.  Eminem has a unique style and is good with words.  He expresses himself many times throughout this album.  \\"Hailie's Song\\" is exceptionally good.  In it he talks about how much he loves his daughter and how he will always be there for her.  \\"Cleanin Out My Closet\\" has a good beat to it.  It talks  about what he has gone through in his life.  However, the only part that I didn't like was how he disrespected his mother in this song.  Overall, this CDis worth the money and will get almoswt anyone hooked on its songs.
B000002KNY|4.0|A star needs to be withheld from the rating because there's no arguing that some of the tracks consist of dressed-up noodling.  That being said, it's damned creative and accomplished noodling.  The fully-realized tracks are already well-celebrated by anyone who has ever heard of this band.  The chugging &quot;Life During Wartime&quot;, paranoid &quot;Animals&quot;, hectic &quot;Cities&quot;, and staccato &quot;I Zimbra&quot;: each of these songs by themselves are worth the relatively low price of this CD.  This band is among the very few that managed to live up to art-house pretentions, and that slightly snooty attitude enhances the complex dynamics of this CD.  As has been noted elsewhere, this album serves as a kind of bridge between the band's earlier minimalist efforts and the lush, dense, polyrhythmic workouts that followed with &quot;Remain in Light&quot; and &quot;Speaking in Tongues&quot;.  By this great band's standards, this is a merely good album.

B000067CPX|3.0|The Red Hot Chili Peppers latest effort, By The Way, is more of an extension of Californication, their previous effort, than anything new. Songs like \\"I Could Die for You\\" or \\"The Zephyr Song\\" start up where \\"Scar Tissue\\"--the first single from Californication--left off. The unpredictable mayhem of the early Peppers albums has been lost and supplemented by mature and emotionally-driven ballads--with the exception of the bizarre latin \\"Cabron\\", which sounds like a Ricky Martin knockoff; and the redundant and immature lyrics of \\"Throw Away Your Television\\". Sticking to formula is not necessarily a bad thing and many would say the sound of By the Way is more refined than Californication, with \\"Can't Stop\\" and \\"Tear\\" bringing new, catchy riffs and choruses that will stick in any pop-rock-fan's head. Some rocking tracks that actually resemble the Red Hot Chili Peppers on Blood Sugar Sex Magick are \\"By the Way\\" and \\"On Mercury\\"--both showcasing John Frusciante's masterful presence on guitar. Over-all the album lacks the solidity of other Peppers albums and shows the Peppers--after almost 20 years--toning it down and acting their ages; therefore, my reaction may be biased as this RHCP album is not for the same target audience as previous efforts.
6305181810|4.0|Despite some problems, The Rainmaker comes off as an entertaining court room drama elevated by an excellent cast.<br />The film, starring Matt Damon as a lawyer on his first case, has two main stories: his relationship with a client who is beaten by her husband, and his attempt to bring down a fraudulent insurance company for denying coverage for a young man's leukemia.<br />While both plots help Damon's character development, in the end it seems both really deserve their own film. They don't seem to mesh well, and neither gets the emotional development they need to propel their stories as best they can. Perhaps the novel by John Grisham, which this film is based on, builds these two stories better, but I haven't read to book to find out. The film as is, though, is still intriguing and entertaining, despite its predictability as a typical court room story.<br />Another distraction was the use of a lot of stereotypes and cliched characters. Though humorous at times, for the most part it takes away from the drama of the film, making it seem like you shouldn't take the film seriously. Which you should, it is primarily meant as a drama, it just overuses comic relief at times.<br />Although this film was directed by Francis Ford Coppola, it doesn't seem to have any of his signature touches incorporated into it. I would never have guessed it was his film just by watching it. It's the film's cast though, not the director, that makes this film really worthwhile. Danny DeVito's supporting role is great as a paralawyer who's flunked the bar exam six times. Other great performances include those from Jon Voight, Danny Glover, Dean Stockwell and Roy Scheider.<br />The Rainmaker is definitely an enjoyable piece with a great cast, but story-wise, don't expect anything too earth shattering.
0800177177|4.0|This is a gothic love story of sorts, but is different in that it spans an amazing four hundred years.<BR>In the beginning we encounter Prince Vlad who is leaving to battle the invading Turkish army. Leaving behind his beautiful, if somewhat emotionally fragile bride Elisabeta. When she receives a forged note telling her that her husband is dead, she flings herself into the river. Prince Vlad vows to avenge her death, by selling his soul to the Devil.<BR>Forward four hundred years, Prince Vlad is still alive and kicking. He has hired a lawyer by the name of Jonathan Harker, who has left behind his fiancee Mina Murray. Prince Dracula sees her picture, realising that his beloved wife has returned, he imprisons Jonathan in his castle and travels to London to meet and woo Mina/Elisabeta.<BR>Gary Oldman shone in the role of the tormented lovesick Count Dracula, he was dark, dangerous, mysterious and [...] on legs. Which made me wonder why Mina went through with her marriage to the bland and unromantic Jonathan even after she had met the Count. Winona Ryder was spectacular as the woman torn between the man she died loving four hundred years ago, and the man she's stuck with in this life. Anthony Hopkins gave some much needed wit and humour in the role of Dr. Van Helsing.<BR>But don't be surprised if you find yourself barracking for the Count to woo Mina away from Jonathan, or for the Count to defeat Van Helsing, or praying that Mina will come to her senses and realise that she belongs with the Count.<BR>Love comes but once in your life, but I guess it depends which life you can remember!
B000002VCU|5.0|The Alan Parsons Project blazed into the 80s with this superb concept examination of gambling addiction.  Parsons and collaborator Eric Woolfson along with orchestral leader Andrew Powell concocted an aural masterpiece and one of the Project's best recordings.<br />MAY BE A PRICE TO PAY opens the album, a fine tune with a marvelous instrumental anchored by Powell's sweeping strings and the subtle jazz piano riffs.  GAMES PEOPLE PLAY, a driving synth rocker and the ephemerally lovely TIME were the two hits from the album and further advanced the APP's wider commercial acceptance.  I DON'T WANNA GO HOME is a desperate plea from an addicted gambler.  THE GOLD BUG is an Ennio Morricone-ish instrumental, highlighted by a haunting whistler.  The extended final track is a collage of the medievalish title track and its reprise; the sardonic SNAKE EYES, the soaring instrumental ACE OF SWORDS and the bittersweet NOTHING LEFT TO LOSE.<br />Vocals are expertly handled by Woolfson, Chris Rainbow, Elmer Gantry and Lenny Zakatek.  As always, the musicianship is impeccable.<br />TURN is Parsons at his peak and a great example of his creative genius.
B00000JMOJ|4.0|This film is based on a short novel Stephen King wrote under the pen name Richard Bachman of the same name.<BR>The film itself became social satire, with television being the central character in this satire.<BR>The year is 2019, nobody has anything better to do with their time than to watch television. And so, the highest rating program is a game show called 'The Running Man'. Contestants are all convicted felons, who are given the chance to win their freedom and a pardon from their crimes, but only if they survive the game. They must live through three hours of stalking and facing death in the face more than once. So far, nobody has won.<BR>But Ben Richards hasn't played yet. He's an ex-cop who refused to carry out orders to kill innocent people in the streets, but the press claimed that he did it, and with pleasure. After he escapes from prison, he is recaptured and meets the loathsome and undignified game show host Damien Killian. Killian threatens to put two fellow inmates, whom he befriended in prison on the game. Richards consents to be put on this freak show, but he has a plan to play the game and escape with his life, irrespective of whether he finishes the game or not. And that is because he plans to change the rules a little, where the hunted will become the hunter.<BR>Although big Arnie is the star of the show, the film wouldn't be complete without Mick Fleetwood as the leader of an underground resistance organisation. Or Dweezil Zappa as Mick's right hand man. Who could possibly forget Jessie Ventura as the retired Captain Freedom (go figure!), who spends his time scoffing down steroids while he stares at a poster of himself in a pathetic moment of self-gratification?<BR>Don't let the lack of extra features put you off, if you are a big fan of this movie, go and buy it. This is the kind of movie that one should appreciate for the powerful, and relevant, social statement being made. Not for the presence or absence of special features.
B000002MP2|5.0|Green Day's &quot;Dookie&quot; is an absolutely amazing album.  There are only several records that can never get played out.  In my opinion, the best CDs are the ones that can be listened to from beginning to end without skipping any tracks.  Every song is original, and the none sound the same.  Green Day's dismal lyrics, combined with the upbeat rhythm and great guitars, make music like no other.  In these ways, &quot;Dookie&quot; is hands-down my favorite album.

B00005CDNF|5.0|In my opinion this is ABBA's best album. Sure, they had many hits after this release but the true, at least classic, ABBA sound is all over the place here. What I mean by that is; their later songs (as good as they were) moved in the disco pop direction, while here we get timeless pop rock at its finest. To me this is their &quot;Tapestry&quot; (legendary Carole King album) filled with monster song upon monster song. How can you beat an album featuring hits like &quot;Mamma Mia&quot;, &quot;S.O.S.&quot;, &quot;I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do&quot;, and &quot;So Long&quot; ?. Add to that gems like the catchy &quot;Bang-A-Boomerang&quot;, &quot;Rock Me&quot; (shades of Slade), and the ballad &quot;I've Been Waiting For You&quot;. -Not only one of their best ballads, but one of the best pop ballads ever. That's nearly the whole album right there, I might as well mention the rest; the excellent and underrated &quot;Hey, Hey Helen&quot;, the seductive &quot;Tropical Loveland&quot;, the funny &quot;Man In The Middle&quot;, and the superb instrumental &quot;Intermezzo No. 1&quot;. -Pop music doesn't get much better than this, folks. A classic album from start to finish, with two interesting bonus tracks. Like I said, they were to write many more great songs, but in pop history this remains their classic album and deserves to be seen as such. At least in my humble opinion.
B00003CXTF|4.0|I like this version of The attack on Pearl Harbor, but I thought somethings were lacking that were apparent in the focus on the love triangle.<br />1. Dorie Miller: He was the first significant hero, but very there was very little coverage of him in the movie. Some of the coverage was unrealistic since the navy was segregated at the time.<br /> 2. Japanese: There should have been more coverage about the Japanese in this picture, since they are a major part of this historical episode.<br />  3. Roosevelt: There was no coverage of his policy decisions such as the embargo against Japan.<br />   The plus is that the movie refreshed many people about this tragedy and why the sacrifices of these men must be remembered.
B00004WGAA|5.0|....The story itself is common enough: A woman (Patricia Jessel) is burned at the stake for witchcraft and she leaves a curse on the people of the town as she is consumed by the flames. Forward 300 years to the present day and we have Nan Barlow (Venetia Stevens) as a self determined college student who decides to write a paper on witchcraft. Her professor, Alan Driscoll (Christopher Lee), gives her directions to the town of Whitewood where 300 years earlier an alleged witch was burned at the stake. She goes to the town and after a few days disappears. Her brother then goes to the hotel where she was last seen, and runs into all kinds obstacles, not the least of which is the innkeeper of the Whitewood Inn, who just happens to look exactly like the witch burned 300 years earlier, and also Christopher Lee who happens to be a long ago resident of Whitewood<br />There is an old, blind priest who stays in his church despite the fact that he has no congregation. His granddaughter, Betta St. John (Patricia Russell), who seems to not be a witch, and has just returned to the town to take care of her grandfather, runs the local used book and antique store. She had befriended Nan before she disappeared and is now working with her brother, Dennis Lotis (Richard Barlow), to try and find out what happened to Nan. <br />Of course they run into the witches along they way and there is a showdown of sorts. The strength of this movie is in it's crisp acting and smart script. Especially notable are Patricia Jessel, Christopher Lee and Venitia Stevens. Despite it's low budget, the director, John Llewellyn Moxey, has made an altogether unforgettable film. ...The VCI Entertainment release is just what this movie has needed for years. An excellent transfer at 1.66:1 with two extra minutes of footage added from previous video and dvd releases. There is a commentary by director John Llewellyn Moxey and another separate commentary by Christopher Lee. There are also three interview segments with Lee, Moxey and Venetia Stevenson. Pretty impressive extras for a 40 year old low budget movie.<br />The commentary by Christopher Lee is interesting in that he has not seen this movie since it came out 41 years earlier. He is watching it with an interviewer from VCI who knows more about what is going on in the movie than Lee does. But Lee's ability to recall information about people and give anecdotal information is unsurpassed. He is literally a walking, talking encyclopedia of info on people he has worked with over the years. <br />This is one of my prize dvd's and I really cannot recommend it highly enough. ...
0684874350|4.0|This is a very sad story of a Catholic child raised by a drunken father and a depressed mother. It was a very good book, that taught me to be grateful for the parents that I have. Frank McCourt captured the story perfectly through the eyes of a child/young adult. In the book, he describes things as though he wrote it just as it happened. If you like looking through the eyes of,or pretending to be people, this is a book is for you. I you don't want to follow the crazy life of an Irish, Catholic kid, then you don't want to read this.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|This is a truly great film - not just an animated film, but a great film. Everyone knows the story, so I won't talk about that, but seeing it again after about  4 years reminds me of how much fun it is.<br />The music is a glorius mixture of operetta and broadway -  and the DVD format brings it into your home in remastered digital sound. The animation is very smooth and the backgrounds are truly impressive.<br />The three versions are all worthwhile viewing. I can't even imagine how New York audiences felt seeing the animated pencil sketches and finished scenes of the &quot;Work-in-progess&quot; version, they must have been stunned.<br />The commentary is a bit chatty, but very entertaining and informative. And the special features which talk about the animation process are enlightening.<br />Best of all - sing along words for a special feature of the decision, I just wish they appeared off screen and were a bit more legible.<br />All in all, a great family DVD... buy it - get a version for the kids, and keep one for you.
0393317552|3.0|Guns, Germs and Steel challenges the traditional historians view of the world, that world events are shaped by people and ideas, instead the author claims that some societies flourished while others stagnated due to geographic and environmental factors, vice concepts such as liberty, the rights of man, or teh pursuit of scientific inquiry. The author describes in great lengths the details of early man and how he developed in different parts of the world. European culture has come to dominate mainly because they were the first to have domesticated animals and crops. If the Africans had them first we would be living in an Afro-dominated world. While I leaned much about early history, I never convinced of the author's major argument. He completely disregarded the role of culture and ideas on societal development, and labeled anyone who stated that some societies were better at doing certain tasks than others as racist. I found this tone smothering and prevented the book from being intellectually valid.
079073639X|2.0|This movie was impressively bland. What started out as an interesting premise - an alien spacecraft trapped on the ocean floor, becomes rapidly tedious. If there is no action in the movie, then there needs to be character development so that I will care when the characters start getting knocked off. No luck here.<br />I hoped that the movie commentary from Hoffman and Jackson would at least be enlightening, but it was of little value as well.<br />You would be better off renting &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; - same premise, better movie. Plus it had Ann Francis in a much better costume than Sharon Stone, and RObbie the Robot getting drunk.

B000001ESN|5.0|&quot;Permanent Waves&quot; (1980) marked a departure for Rush, with shorter, more accessible tunes and forays into the sounds that would shape their music for the rest of the decade.<br />I was fourteen when my sister took me to my first concert, which was Rush on the &quot;Permanent Waves&quot; tour.  I was blown away by their musicianship and seeing Alex Lifeson and Geddy Lee both playing double-neck guitars.  I was also amazed at watching Lee play bass, keyboards and sing at the same time.<br />The sound hear is much clearer than its predessor, &quot;Hemispheres&quot; thanks to Lifeson's new guitar sound, which changed from record to record.  Also, take into consideration that this was their 7th studio recording and these guys continued to improve and innovate.<br />1.  The Spirit of Radio.  The leadoff cut &quot;bristles with the energy&quot; of Lifeson's brilliant intro lick.  There is great melody, down-to-earth lyrics and great band musicianship.  There's also a bit of &quot;world&quot; music with &quot;reggae-like&quot; playing that portends things to come.  5 stars.<br />2.  Free Will.  Another great intro, way cool bassline, especially in the middle part, and inspirational lyrics about choosing your own way.  5 stars.<br />3.  Jacob's Ladder.  Great lyrical imagery and allegory here.  &quot;bruised and sullen stormclouds have the light of day obscured&quot; and I've always loved the alliteration of &quot;the shifting shafts of shining weae the fabric of their dreams...&quot;  At first glance, this appears to be a long, boring song, but &quot;Jacob's Ladder&quot; is like an onion, in that one must listen to the layers and intricacies as now two lines are quite alike.  Great building dynamics from the bass/drum martial-like intro and the band playing as a unit.  Math-rock at its finest.  3+ stars.<br />4.  Entre Nous.  I agree with other reviewers that this is kind of the overlooked gem of the album, even though the synths are a little overdone.  It's a great relationship song about communication.  I like the lines &quot;Just between us, I think it's time for us to realize, the spaces in between, leave room, for you and I to grow.&quot;  4 stars<br />5.  Different Strings.  Another underrated nugget, featuring nice piano work by guest Hugh Syme.  This songs says to me, everyone is different so respect other people's opinions.  Also, that there are those out there ready to watch other's fail.  3+ stars.<br />6.  Natural Science.  Another allegory-laden song that has to be reviewed to look beneath the surface.  It's not just about science, but also the environment and society as well.  Overall, this tune lacks a strong melody and some of the instrumental parts are kind of droning.  3 stars.ationship song about communication.

B000063USY|1.0|If you are looking for a movie that has morals and values, then go get a Disney flick.  This film is tasteless, stupid and really really dumb.  The plot concerns evil LA gansters who drive cars at 130 gazillion miles per hour to kill innocent people so they can steal DVD players, then they go hold illegal street races and everybody cheats to try and win while avoiding the \\"Evil\\" cops.  Thats basically the entire plot of the film.  Theres also something about a undercover cop, but I dont care.  This film is really tasteless and stupid, with no reedemning values whatsoever.  This is a film that tells kids that killing innocent people and commiting violent crimes are fun, exciting and ok to do.  I cant believe this film did so well during its run in theaters, but I'm forgetting the rules to succed in a teen film<BR>1. Have really fast cars drive around<BR>2. Have scantilly clad women<BR>3. Have shots of the \\"Good guys\\" killing innocent people.<BR>and <BR>4. Make it tasteless<br />If a film targeted at teenagers has these rules, then it is virtually garenteed to succed.  My favorite sequence is when the \\"good Guys\\" (The theives) try to stop a truck so they can steal the 35,660,332nd DVD for thier secret hideout, and when they try, the truck driver fights back, breaking a guys leg, shooting the \\"good Guys\\" and destroying thier cars.  Hooray for the truck driver!  It makes me feel so good that innocent civilians can stop heartless crimminals.  Evil and tastelessness have a new name, and that name is \\"The Fast and the furious\\"  Burn foul Demon, Burn!<br />The good:<BR>Umm.... a truck driver inflicts pain on the main charachters<br />the bad:<BR>Everything<br />and the ugly:<BR>Teaching kids and teens that it is okay to kill people and live a life of crime should be punished.

0812548094|2.0|I read the whole Wheel of Time series just before starting this series. I give this a rating of 2 stars since I found at least a few things interesting in the books, like Kahlan, but sadly, the rest is nothing more than copy and paste of the Wheel of Time books. :(<br />Here, let me give you some parallels:<br />Richard = Rand<BR>Rand is in prophecies, gee, so is Richard....<BR>Rand becomes a sword master, hmm, so does Richard, although via spirits instead of actual practice.<br />The White Tower = Palace of the Prophets, both establishments are on an island next to a big city with a river. Goodkind hardly even makes an effort to make anything different.<br />Sisters of the Light = Aes Sedi<BR>Sisters of the Light want to control Richard, the Aes Sedi want to control Rand.<br />Wizards in this series are basically the male Aes Sedi of WOT. <BR>In this series, new wizards must learn to control their magic or it causes them a horrible death if they are not rescued and taught how in time. In WOT, the men must overcome the 'taint' of the male half of the power or they die horribly.<BR>Wizards are at odds with Sisters of the Light...Male Aes Sedi are at odds with the Female Aes Sedi....<br />There are 'Black Ajea' in the White Tower, and surprise, there are 'dark sisters' in the Palace of the Prophets. In both series, it's forbidden to mention the 'Dark sis...er Black Ajea' and they are mythical, scary, and powerfull. Identical in both series.<br />In WOT, the \\"Dark One\\" is trying to escape his prison where he was put by the Creator...the \\"Nameless One\\" in this series is trying to escape his prison where he was put by the Creator. There aren't even minor differences here. They are the same.<br />Richard is the only one who can stop the Nameless One from escaping. Rand is the only one who can stop the Dark One from escaping. Both Rand and Richard are headed for the 'big showdown one on one fight with the Nameless One.<br />Chase the border guard = Lan in WOT. Both the formidable almost unstoppable fighters of the series.<br />Blood of the Fold = White Cloaks in WOT.<br />The Bak Ban Mani = Aiel<BR>Both have men and women fighter sects. Both series, Rand / Richard ends up ruling them.<BR>Rand becomes the Caracarn, Richard becomes the Caharin. <BR><br />I can go on, and on, and on.... but I'm running out of space to shoot holes in these books.<br />Bottom line: Both the Wheel of Time series and the Sword of Truth series were essentially written by the same author, Robert Jordan. <br />It's too bad that he copied someone else's work, because the 'few' places where the books actually diverge, the characters are interesting...like Kahlan...and he did do a decent job of getting some emotion into the story, which was fun.<BR>I loved the part where Kahlan leads 5,000 young recruits against 50,000 battle hardened men. I was rivetted and that was one of the more original parts of the book, so trust me, I'm not just bashing the series. The problem is that there are just too many similarites to WOT.<br />Maybe next time he'll actually take the time to come up with his own story and write a real book, but this stuff is mostly just a work of cut and paste. Goodkind has lost my trust as a reader. Skip this and go read WoT....
B000068TPN|5.0|Having watched this film now on two occasions I felt compelled to write a review. Yet having sat down I felt lost for words. How does one do justice to such a film as this ?<br />As a Christian I abhor war and all that it stands for. Yet having served in the military I appreciate all the values depicted here, not least the sacrifice and the bravery of all those who suffered and died on both sides.<br />This is a story that must be told. It must be told to the American and Vietnamese people whose soldiers fought on that November day in 1965 and the world must be made aware of the horrors that were faced on the battlefield in the Ia Drang Valley, known as 'The Valley of Death'.<br />Many might be unaware that this film is indeed based on a true story. A true story of a place in Vietnam where some 400 US soldiers found themselves isolated and surrounded by an opposing force of roughly 2,000 North Vietnamese soldiers and the ensuing conflict.<br />This is not a film for the squeamish. War is horrific, barbaric and full of butchery and the scenes depicted in this film portray these properties in no mean measure.<br />The film proceeds at heart-racing pace from beginning to end. The acting is absolutely superb. This film will no doubt rank as a classic amongst it's genre. The battle-scenes are as realistic as they come.<br />This is not a film that glorifies war, or that seeks to do so. It clearly seeks to tell a story. A story of the men who were there and the horrors that they endured & suffered and the casualties that were sustained. To it's credit it also includes the stories of the families, wives and children left at home whilst their loved ones faced the ultimate sacrifice..<br />One of the characters in the film, notably the battle scenes, is depicted as a photographer. Might I respectfully suggest that anyone with an interest in the historics of this battle, this war and the suffering of those involved, take some further time to examine a book entitled \\"REQUIEM\\". It is a book entirely devoted to the story of combatants such as these. A book devoted to the photographs of those war photographers who did not return. Photographers whose lives were also sacrificed in the process of bringing us the story of those soldiers who suffered.<br />This film will choke you and might very well bring a tear to the most hardened of viewers. We need to be aware of the horrors of such conflicts and ensure that we do all we can to prevent them. Highly recommended viewing.\\".

B0000542D2|1.0|I wish I had read some of the reviews here before ordering this DVD.  Many of the reviewers have spoken of the terrible sound, and they are correct.  I guess this is what one must expect when people in love with technology approach a work of art.  The supposedly enhanced sound ruins the movie.  I have watched only a few minutes of this DVD, and I will never watch it again, even though A Hard Day's Night is one of my favorite movies.  I should probably study this fiasco a little more before writing this review to verify what I'm going to say, but I'm so disgusted that I can't wait.  Although I have read 30 or 40 of the reviews here, I haven't seen a couple of particular complaints mentioned.  My apologies if someone has already written about them.  In the performance of &quot;If I Fell,&quot; I believe the released recording has replaced the &quot;live&quot; version the Beatles recorded for the movie.  To synchronize the video with the sound, Miramax has slowed down the latter!  The music is about a half-step off.  Later, during the big TV performance toward the end of the movie, the producers have removed the ambient sound, so one gets no sense of the audience's wild excitement.  Because I couldn't watch any more than this, I'm probably missing many other transgressions.  I can't imagine what Miramax was thinking when they released this.  I will never again let my eagerness to own a DVD permit me to order it before reading reviews, but how could I have anticipated a disgrace of this caliber?  I'm thankful I have the VHS copy I recorded off cable many years ago.
B000001Y5J|5.0|Wow, what happened here? Trent's gone metal on us!!!!! This 8 song EP marked the introduction of the metal to NIN's already potent industrial mix, and helped define the trademark, vitriolic sound that has become their trademark.<BR>Remarkably complete and forfilling for what could be called \\"stop-gap\\" material, it earns a solid spot in my \\"Top 5 EPs\\" list. <BR>...fortunately, he retains a hefty sense of cohesion throughout, not going overboard on the amphetamines, but also giving us an acoustic track, an Adam Ant cover, and a collaboration with industrial supergroup Pigface. Those last two are hidden tracks (tracks 98 and 99, 7-97 are 2 second clips of silence), but even they retain the angry feel of the main tracks. <BR>And texture makes an even greater emergence than in Pretty Hate Machine...tracks such as \\"Last\\", have uncountable layers, that prove that NIN make some of the most complex dance music ever...well, excepting all noise music. This makes a greater showing on the next full album, the masterwork, \\"The Downward Spiral\\", in which Trent would consolidate his standing as being the best at building songs from the ground up...All in all, not bad. At all. In fact, it's probably THE BEST E.P. I've ever heard. The remix EP, Fixed, which has this entire set remixed/\\"reborn\\", is also worth a listen, preferably back to back. Pick that up also, if you must, but this comes second only to The Downward Spiral. So get it...and fast.
B00005JKCH|3.0|I'm not sure what all the hype was over this movie.  Maybe my expectations were too high, but this did not even come close to the original Batman, and the movie was far too slow to truly entertain me.  Maybe there's something I'm missing, but I expect more from the sequel.
B00004XOWM|1.0|Possibly the most hated CD of all time. And for good reason. Fred Durst - and the rest - have quite possibly come up with the most hyped, yet easily most disappointing \\"metal\\" CD of the year 2001 (or any other year!).<BR>I used to remotely like this, but once I heard all my friends noting the lack of brains in the music and lyrics, I went over the album and realised they had a point.<BR>Breaking out in countries all over the world thanks to their version of the Mission Impossible theme, they then followed that up with one good yet monotonous song (My Generation)...and isn't it funny how that description can be applied to ANY Bizkit song? Why, yes!<BR>Bottom line? This CD is dull, repetitive crud, destroying metal's self-respect by going mainstream, and being an embarrasement to countless fans. Haha!<BR>Anyway, tracklisting:<br />1.Intro. Dull. Rock bands should NEVER apply stupid \\"techno\\" intros to their CDs without running them by anyone else. Truly boring and ...(Who's in the house?/Limp Bizkit. ZZZZ).<br />2. Hot Dog. As with the majority of this album's songs, Fred's inflated ego has taken command of the lyrics and made them stupid and unnecessary. In this case, 46 uses of the word f**k constitute the words. Oh how tough. That's more than most albums have (yet this one has over 200 f words and 300 swearwords in total...easily the most crude album I've heard. Maybe to make up for a lack of talent, cuss them to death!) Even having the balls to steal from Nine Inch Nails' monumental \\"Closer\\", and \\"borrowing\\" the line \\"Everybody knows It's On\\" from Korn's \\"It's On\\" (hey, they're friends so we can forgive them!), it shows how Fred has no talent. Even the riffs and song structure (the actual music) lacks a sense of cohesion..and that's what really matters in music, not brain-bashingly \\"heavy\\" music.<br />3. My Generation. More swearing. But no one cares after the last track. Still, this track improves on the basic musical structure of most other Bizkit songs by including both a very good (!) riff and an awful DJ solo. DJs and rock bands should stay away from each other.<BR>Still, one of the slightly better songs.<br />4. Full Nelson. Even more stupid techno noises, \\"crushing\\" riffs, and stupid swearing. Yet this remains one of the tracks I still have a soft spot for. Maybe it's due to the dynamics, I don't know. It's just somewhat different. Yet if you want to get into detailed Bizkit discussion I ain't your man.<br />5. My Way. Clean! 3 swearwords in the song, and not 40 like others. Slightly more \\"upbeat\\" cos there seem to be major chords in the song.<br />6. Rollin'. Awful. The worst song ever by Bizkit, released purely for it's commercial appeal and easily imitable dance routine. Dance? I thought that's what rock was against. Still, do you find some coincidence in the fact that this was the most played Bizkit tune ever, and yet my most hated? Aaaaah!<br />7. Livin' It Up. Always include apostrophe in at least two songs. More of the same, very slightly above average, cos the Eagles sample doesn't sound out of place, like the album in the metal world, cos it's quite a good sample. But more bad swearing - sorry, rapping! from Fred spoils a possibly good song.<br />8. The One. The \\"mellow\\" track. Pretty pointless stadium filler, and Fred's attempts to sing don't work too well either.<br />9. Getcha Groove On. No wait, THIS is the worst Bizkit \\"song\\" ever. It's not even theirs, it has some disgusting \\"beats\\" from producer, erm, \\"Swiss Beatz\\". It's very very very bad, even Xzibit's attempts at rhyming, which work well, are drowned out by Fred's poorness and the constant nagging beat.<br />10. Take A Look Around. Played a lot on the radio. I'm not too sick of this song though, it seemed to be recorded at a point when Limp's talent hadn't been sucked out by the promise of money. The Mission Impossible tune seems a bit irrevelant. But hey, Fred's rap isn't self-centred tripe for once.<br />11. It'll Be OK. More tripe, aimed at exploiting the self-hate crowd. Dull.<br />12. Boiler. Boring! More MTV material, this time getting one up (or so they think) on the haters. We don't want to hurt you Fred. We just want to hurt your music!!<br />13. Hold On. Another OK tune, the most sensitive Bizkit song to date. Also the only one where the attempts at singing are worthwhile<br />14. Rollin (Urban Assault Vehicle). 2 hip-hop tunes in one album?!??! NO THANKS! We also didn't need another version of Rollin', pretty dull stuff. Except for the moment where the rappers upstage Fred by being better than him...oh, that's the whole song!!<br />15. Outro. More boring techno naffness. Ben Stiller sullying his name by association, then breaking up into ... giggles. Not worth it OK?<br />So, overall, a boring CD. Only the 2 CD set redeems the entire idea of this package even existing, as it has the videos for the best material from the last album, Significant Other, which is miles better than this, as the idea of rap-metal hadn't been ...dry by then, like it is now.<BR>All in all, any other nu-metal group - Tool, SOAD, Linkin Park and Slipknot - are much much much more worthy of your time. Avoid.
B00005K3O4|5.0|Released at the tale end of the 80s slasher movie smothered era, the direct to video monster movie Killer Klowns from Outer Space was a breath of fresh air for the stagnating horror genre.  Alternating between unashamed goofiness and actual creepiness, this seemingly unworkable concept of having a race of silly yet very dangerous alien 'clowns' who drop out of the sky one night to scoop up a small town's populace for a quick snack.  As one of the Chiodo brothers says, \\"It's The Blob, but with clowns.\\"<br />And that it is.  Killer Klowns from Outer Space plays the classic 50s monster movie scenario with a sure hand.  The Killer Klowns seem overly goofy when first introduced in their Circus Tent Spaceship - they use a balloon animal bloodhound to track the escaping teens, shoot popcorn guns instead of ray guns, throw pies, and cocoon their victims in Cotton Candy pods or storage balloons for later cooking.  But once they get to work the laughter gets a bit nervous, for these Klowns love to play with their food.<br />MGM/UA has done a wonderful job on the disc, jamming it with tons of behind the scenes footage, interviews, bloopers, and commentary.  We even get to see the Chiodo Brothers first attempt at home movies, which is a treat.  The only oversight is the music video of the theme song, performed by The Dickies - so don't throw out those old videos or laserdiscs just yet.  Still, this release is a must have for any monster movie enthusiast.  I give it my highest recommendation.
B000021YQV|5.0|What a disc. Out of the five biggest releases of the metal scene - this, Tool's Lateralus, Slipknot's Iowa, Machine Head's Supercharger, and Incubus's Morning View (sorry Slayer and Megadeth fans, I'm talking commercial wise), this has to be the best - and I haven't heard Incubus yet, so you can tell I mean business. The massive range of influences on show mix together in a blend so potent that a fan of only one of the styles on show will almost certaintly love every track. &quot;Prison Song&quot; - self-explanatory. As Wicked Neil said, this is what Rage Against The Machine did, but didn't. &quot;Chop Suey&quot;, the first single, is stunning, an amalgam of twisting styles, with a very sweet melody from Serj. He's got the &quot;best..metal voice...EVER&quot;<br />And before you come to a jarring HALT, one last piece &quot;Aerials&quot;, shows the band's Eastern influences. Closing in at an all-too-brief 44 minutes, it's even better buying the Special Edition CD-ROM version (red cover, making-of CD ROM, 3 extra tracks - that makes 18). Good Good Good! Not only is this the best metal album so far this year, it's an awesome introduction to a wider range of styles. As Pitchshifter said - &quot;GEEEENNNNIIIUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUSSSS!&quot;
B00005BL2A|2.0|I was looking forward to the new depeche mode album a great deal, and the moment i heard the samples from the site i was pretty badly disappointed. Then, like an idiot, I purchased the album, and then decided to give it away to someone else because I felt it really lacked the emotional rollercoastery ride that Depeche Mode's albums usually have. The songs are not bad though, they just are nowhere near what Gahan and Gore are capable of coming up with. This is more music to listen to if you're in those happy moods that don't really have any direction or intensity or sometimes, sincerity, and I feel it reflects in the way the songs have been written. I wouldn't go so far as to call them insincere, but it seems as if Gore's taken a break from proper songwriting. The lyrics,  \\"there's no time for hesitating, pain is ready, pain is waiting\\"  simply suck when compared to stuff like \\"Morality would frown upon, Decency look down upon, The scapegoat fate's made of me.\\"  So if you haven't heard the old ones, and want to get into DM, I would say purchase any of the previous three..SOFAD , Violator or Ultra. This one isn't worth it.
B000002JNJ|4.0|....1. Cowboys From Hell. Opening with the now classic riff (hum it with me now), and signified by Phil's chant of \\"We're taking over this town\\", this CD starts in style. The solo and leadout are some of the most impressive I've ever heard. Gone are the glam Pantera. Thank goodness for that!<br />2. Primal Concrete Sledge. A 2 minute rollercoaster, with some neat drum work from Vinnie Paul ...Practically the only song without a solo, yet at a mere 2:13, that couldn't be possible. Catchy chorus too.<br />3. Psycho Holiday. The first song to have that true Pantera groove which is so synonomous ...with the band today. Not a major standout for me, yet you may find that this is for you.<br />4. Heresy. This is a standout for me. Dimebag's solo's pretty incredible, and'll leave you slackjawed the first time you hear it. Very nice. And the doublebass pounding by Vinnie is the first drum standout.<br />5. Cemetery Gates. ... Even better than \\"Hollow\\" off Vulgar Display Of Power, a similarly styled mellow metal tune. ... At 7 minutes, it's long, but superb. The best song on this CD without a doubt, despite Phil's somewhat glam singing at the end ...which would disappear with time...phew.<br />6. Domination. ...- not much swearing on this album surprisingly - this song kicks off very well. It changes styles somewhat drastically towards the end however, to a more heavy rather than hard style. Doesn't particularly matter though, it still works very well.<br />7. Shattered. A very speed metal song, that's for sure. Nice and speedy. ...P>8. Clash With Reality. A personal favourite of mine. ...P>9. Medicine Man. ...Another one of those songs that lets down the album... ...P>10. Message In Blood. A great little song, with heaps of that under-used trick syncopation ... And the tune's OK as well, with some good bass by Rex during the verses. ...11. The Sleep. Another track that's a little pants in relation to the others. It has an anthemic feel to it, which Pantera don't do that wellby the sound of this. Because this song is in a style of it's own, it's hard to compare it to any other song. It's a ballad, but not...hard to describe. It has a decent solo though. ...!<br />12. The Art Of Shredding. ...
B000002J2B|5.0|Sounds weird, but this is a really beautiful album. And better than the others for someone who is not a Genesis fanatic. Buy it.
B00000IN5G|5.0|...Get 'Red Light In My Eyes pt.2' from their debut, Something Wild, and listen to the intro, that has been directly taken from Mozart's Symphony No.25. <BR>The amalgam of undiluted death metal, melodious overtones (often due to the keyboards), and the aforementioned classical influences make for a powerful yet cohesive listening experience. Not to mention the soloing. Every song here has a completely synapse-shredding solo to boot, courtesy of frontman Alexi 'Wildchild' Laiko. And the drumming gives Trym, from the seminal black metal group Emperor, a VERY fast and tight run for his money.<BR>The vocals may be a touch overdone, but if you like the style on show here (frog-in-throat) you'll most probably love this. ... Follow The Reaper, whilst sadly shedding a lot of the brutal thrash that at times characterises this disc (to awesome effect). But for seasoned metalheads, this sophomore effort is a fist-in-the-air ride all the way. Enjoy.<br />Tracklisting:<br />01. Warheart. Coming out the gates with a quote from Amadeus, 'From now on, we are enemies...you and I'...setting the scene for the aggressive treat ahead. All involved play their wrists off, and soon settle into a groove which spells out the word 'anthemic'. Jaska Raatikainen's unbelievable skill ... plays the first of it's many tricks - he's as fast as Mike Portnoy is complicated. The solo section, shifting into double time, steals the show...The only weak point is the end - the song should stop at a more obvious point.... Silent Night, Bodom Night. One of the weaker tracks I think, though the intro is good. There isn't much of a hook anywhere to be found, as the chorus and tempo shifts around too much. These may be quibbles, as this is supposedly one of the best songs the group have composed, but it feels average to me nonetheless.<br />03. ...The group are at the very pinnacle of their powers, as not a note seems misplaced. Even the potentially disastrously overlong guitar keyboard 'battle' (amazing) solosection seems a stroke of genius. ... Bed Of Razors. After 3 thrash songs, the group relax, and take down the tempo several notches, thus giving a counterpoint to the speed. It's well placed, another thrash song and I would have got whiplash. With perfect timing on their side, this comes off as the group's best slow song, beating anything on Follow The Reaper to the ground with it's intricacy. The keyboards, by Janne Wirman, get another chance to shine, with a brief solo not seeming like a chance to get off by any means.<br />05. Towards Dead End. Such a deviation from plan doesn't last long. ...P>06. Black Widow. A sinister keyboard part leads into the darkest song on the album, with the bleakness reaching a head with a stunning 4/5 section, 32th notes on the kick drums underlying a sweeping harmonized dual guitar riff. A standout part on the disc altogether, even if the song as a whole is cut short.<br />07. Wrath Within. At this point, the whole formula has burnt out somewhat, so some slightly slower songs complete the disc. This is another average song, with the same problems re-emerging, and only a catchy half-time riff around 2:30 in makes any difference. Nice, but unremarkable.<br />08. Children Of Bodom. Slightly better, and the most accessible track on show here. ...
0780628551|1.0|An interesting premise is ruined by a director's desire to make a name for himself through imagery.  <br />If you can bare to keep your mind switched on, for what must be the dullest film of all-time, then you'll see some beautiful design and cinematography.  Also in shot you may see the deadest actors this side of 'Zombie Flesheaters'.  I like Jonny Depp as an actor and, being male, I like Charlize Theron too but... God knows what they were thinking.<br />I've seen my fair share of boring films but they can usually at least prick my attention with a little fast-pacing every-so-often but, as I said, the film is simply a long string of nice looking but inconsequential set-pieces. <br />Watch Abel Ferrara's 'Body Snatchers' instead, for a relevant update of 50s B-movie ideas.
B000021YQV|5.0|What a disc.

B000002U8G|5.0|Meddle is a stellar record and in my opinion, one of the four definitive Pink Floyd albums. The other three being Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here and Animals. Naturally, my most glaring omission is The Wall, which I feel can be a little difficult to digest for the casual fan. Most of it's better moments are staples on classic rock radio anyway.<br />From the opening riff of One of These Days (perhaps the birth knell of what was to become heavy metal) to the closing bars of Echoes (a gargantuan, esoteric, eclectic epic), Meddle is one of the few Floyd albums that combines musical elements as diverse as hard rock, blues, jazz and psychedelia. The influence of the latter especially began to wane in the later Waters-led period (Animals, The Wall).<br />It is also one of the few albums that is not thematic in content (as opposed to Dark Side, WYWH, Animals, The Wall, Final Cut, etc) and is individually accessible on a song-by-song basis, ranging from the Beach Boys-like San Tropez to the Mississippi-Delta-Blues-inspired tongue-in-cheek Seamus.<br />Some argue that the production of Meddle does not match their later work, and though this may be true, it is this 'grit' that gives Meddle a superflous aura.<br />On the whole, a superb Pink Floyd album and a worthy buy for anyone who truly appreciates the power of their music.
B000002JOH|5.0|Wow.<BR>If you haven't heard of Pantera, and you're a \\"metalhead\\", you've been living under a rock for the last decade. They are the only metal band to reach No.1 on the mainstream album charts (Far Beyond Driven), not counting Slipknot, or Limp Bizkit, or Staind...aagh. Pantera is certaintly the greatest out of all these groups - and this is their finest 52 minutes.<br />This CD will wake you up anytime waking up is needed - much like any other Pantera CD, but to a even greater degree of quality music. With the opening chords of the now classic \\"Mouth For War\\", to the piledriver lead out of the still quite mellow \\"Hollow\\", all 52 minutes of this CD are worthy of your time. And while the standard of musicianship would be topped in songs that come on later in Pantera history, this is their most all rounded, and giving you a severe case of moshing while you're at it.<BR>Tracklisting:<BR>1. Mouth For War. Classic. Giving the US it's first metal No.1 single, and if you listen, you'll figure out why. From Dimebag's awesome solo to the throughly speed metal outro, this simply rocks. Best Pantera song ever, no contest.<br />2. A New Level. A particular live favourite, and though it takes a while to grow on you, believe me it will. Also, the first time that Rex Brown's bass really stands out - during the other awesome solo - Dimebag's, how convienient!<br />3. Walk. The only slow song on the album I dislike, and also the most radio-friendly. It's OK, for a few listens, but you'll find you'll be skipping it after a while, onto...<br />4.F**king Hostile. Absolutely awesome. 167 seconds of sheer speed, though quite a few songs can top this for BPM, not many can top it for sheer power. 1,2,3,4!!!!<br />5. This Love. The first \\"power-ballad\\" on the album, but far heavier than most. With truly dark lyrics (anti-love), which have become a Pantera staple, and again another great Dimebag solo (I don't think there is a single song on this album where he doesn't solo actually), this song was released as a single, and though you may see why, you'll change your mind.<br />6. Rise. ! The opening chords may pin you to the floor. Linking seamlessly with the quiet of the previous track, all the time building up to an amazing chorus, with Phil screaming, \\"What's wrong with your mind!!!\\", undercutted by Vinnie Paul's stunning drum work. Vinnie is a drum god, by the way.<br />7. No Good (Attack The Radical). Though the second half of the CD doesn't quite live up to the sheer brlliance of the first, and even though this track in particular ain't so good (probably because they're all the same pace, though I wouldn't complain too much), this still has some great moments, with one of the grooviest bridges on the album.<br />8. Live In A Hole. More of the same, yet this track has a rather abrupt tempo change twice throughout the bridge, which does throw you off some, but it's still Pantera, and there's no denying the quality of the musicians on show.<br />9. Regular People (Conceit). With more of that groove undercutting the entire song. It takes time going, but you may just be humming/screaming the chorus for weeks.<br />10. By Demons Be Driven. Another metal cliche, attacking religion. Maybe this is what is meant when people say Phil has stupid views. Yet this is a powerful song, the last relatively weak song on the CD but still containing some crushing guitar work. Signals a previous intensity not heard before on any other Pantera work.<br />11. Hollow. After that, the final piece of masterwork. Being careful not to put all the excellent songs at the start, they've held back this \\"power-ballad\\", again relative, for the final cut. And without it, the CD would probably only get an 8 - as it's the depth and breadth of Pantera's music that is a particular standout about the band - being able to write sweet sounding yet bitter songs and incredibly heavy MAINSTREAM metal tunes. For the first 3 minutes, a lovely little song about, well, being hollow inside, before kicking into a very catchy end part that leads out the CD in style.<br />There are those that say this is probably the end of the really great Pantera, as Far Beyond Driven went even heavier and alienated about half their fanbase, but I say this one was an indicator that this CD indicated that was their new direction. Songs like Rise and By Demons Be Driven show startling balls for such a mainstream group. Nowhere else would you be able to hear this stuff on daytime radio back in 1992.<BR>And if you think this is metal, wait for The Great Southern Trendkill!
B00006HBUA|2.0|I'm sorry, but this movie is an embarassment to the franchise. The plot was just too weird and didn't make a lot of sense, although the special effects were great. But the casting was the WORST! The actors who played Shaggy and Velma were ok, but Freddie and Michelle, gotta go. Were they a package deal or something? Talk about over-playing Daphne!
B000002H2H|5.0|If Kill 'Em All was the manifesto, Ride The Lightning is the revolution. If you count out Master Of Puppets, this amazing album is Metallica's best and an album that should not be ignored. Years before MTV had heard of them, these people were cracking out classic after classic, and this proves that. Songs like \\"Fade To Black\\" and \\"Creeping Death\\" may not be known by anyone under 12, but at this quality they should be... The guitar work from Kirk Hammett has gone up higher from the last album, reaching very nice speeds indeed (hehe). James Hetfield's voice is still improving, but his lyrics have already reached their peak. Well, what can I say? You know you want it. Highly recommended.
0312265859|4.0|My husband actually introduced me to this series after he read the latest book, \\"Hard Eight\\". It was a quick read, especially if you stay up late to see what happens next!  I found it witty and entertaining, and as a result, have started reading the series from the first book, \\"One for the Dough\\". Being a Peace Officer myself, I can relate to Plum's character attempting a tough job in a \\"man's world\\" and making necessary compensations. Being inept at times, Plum is frustrating and yet loveable. I could have used a little steamier love scene or two, anticipating Plum's character finally acting on her primal urges, but overall, the book kept me hooked until the last page.
B000002JR8|4.0|So, the Pantera wagon rumbles on. Vulgar Display Of Power has become a huge hit, with it's flagship single, the unstoppable \\"Mouth For War\\" hitting No.1, the first metal song to do so.<BR>How do they follow that up?<BR>Go HEAVIER....<BR>Tracklisting:<br />1. Strength Beyond Strength. This CD takes exactly 1 second to kick your ass. I mean that. The opening riff will floor you to the ground, it's so strong. In essence, a wake-up call to those who were expecting another VDOP: No way people. Pantera do what they wanna do.<BR>As for the music, this displays some of Dimebag Darrell's new tricks - the increased distortion, and the deeper riffs. Very nice. And Vinnie Paul's drums have a strong showing as well...the pounding of the opening drum rolls do a very good job of leaving your jaw on the floor. And the speed of this song impresses too - the fastest Pantera song since Rise.<br />2. Becoming. With a now classic riff permeating the introduction, this has a few more classic moments, namely Dimebag's truly eyepopping solo, one of his best EVER. Even though it sounds like Kerry King.<br />3. 5 Minutes Alone. One of the huge singles from the album. The first time you hear this song, it's actually quite terrifying. You probably won't have heard anything quite as heavy as the verses, and probably will hear nothing of the standard of Rex Brown's bass solo, during the bridge. Excellent...again.<br />4. I'm Broken. Catchy describes this song best. It's this album's \\"Walk\\", only better than that over-rated song.<BR>One for the head-bangers for sure, nice and crunchy. Like biscuits. Only not very chocolately.<br />5. Good Friends And A Bottle Of Pills.<BR>Thus comes the first stumbling block on this CD. What was Phil thinking when writing this lyrics? I know, I'll include random swearing into a song that's about getting off with another person's girlfriend, that's supposed to sound dark and evil but comes off on repeated listening as completely dumb?!?!?!??\\" All respect to Phil,but this is one of the songs the album could have done without. It doesn't really fit in, even in this bleak album. When Dimebag said that Reinventing The Steel only had 10 tracks because it was better to have 10 good cuts, rather than 15 tracks and only 3 of them are any good (Limp Bizkit?), yet this track and 25 Years let the CD down. So that's 10 good tracks on this one, and only 2 are bad. Good batting average, nonetheless.<br />6. Hard Lines, Sunken Cheeks. The main issue with this track, at 7 minutes long, it drags on for a while. The other issue is that it changes tempo quite drastically. Still, this song becomes good thanks to an excellent solo from Dimebag in the bridge.<br />7. Slaughtered. Very very heavy. Like a certain 5 Minutes Alone and Use My Third Arm. With nothing but screams and grunts consisting as vocals for this track, this one nearly hits death metal standards it's so extreme. Not very fast, just heavy, and with a memorable chorus and end too.<br />8. 25 Years. The other bodge up on the CD. Overlong at 6 and a half minutes, this track just seems to be very repetitive, and when you think you're going to hear a memorable chorus, it just doesn't materialise. Yet, the catchy finish, with a pummel from Vinnie Paul accompaning Phil's shouts of, \\"We're f**king you back\\" makes for a very cool, if somewhat profane ending to an otherwise dull song.<br />9. Shredding Skin. Another \\"change in tempo\\" song, but it works, thanks to the good guitar links from part to part. The solo is reminiscent of the tons of groove Pantera have, and the ending lures you into a false sense of security. You think it's going to go all mellow...wrong. You should know by now!<br />10. Use My Third Arm. Whenever this is played live, Phil yells out, \\"We wrote this when everyone was trying to sound like f**king Nirvana\\". And all you mall-core sheep: take a quick listen to this anti-cop song (boring topic? Think again), and your perceptions about heavy will be redefined. Easily theheaviest track on the album, and considering what's come before, that's an incredible achievement. Like Domination and By Demons Be Driven before it, this song gives an indication of the next album, The Great Southern Trendkill, which is heavier and darker still. And you think this is extreme. AHAHHAHA!!! You wait for Trendkill people. The best bit? The stunning lead in to the chorus. HEAVY.<br />11. Throes Of Rejection. Also very heavy, with depressing angry lyrics, about, well, rejection. Some good musicianship on show: the Dimebag riff just before the bit which is just before the verse, which is good and clever too (try understanding that), and the excellent leadout, which, while being tuneless, illustrates the album's dark feel well.<br />12. Planet Caravan. The final song on the album. A cover of a Black Sabbath song off the classic album Paranoid, and while the hardcore slagged Pantera for doing this, everyone else loved it. I loved it. A nice twist on the extremely heavy album stereotype, with all involved showing they can do mellow beautifully. But after songs like Hollow, This Love, and Cemetery Gates, you should already know that.<br />That's the way the CD leaves you...very shaken, and maybe that little bit stirred. The brain-bashing...no, BLUDGEONING, assault of tracks like 5 Minutes Alone, and Use My Third Arm especially, comes as a shock to the un-initated. Those who already are will still be surprised. And while the album earns it's advisory sticker (Good Friends..., 25 Years, and Use My Third Arm all have at least 10 \\"f\\" words, to be really coy), most of you won't give a flying *!*!. Hahahaha. Shame that only Use My Third Arm is the only one out of those three that's worthwhile, which bumps the CD down to an 8.<BR>And by the way, this CD went straight to No.1 in the album charts. See, extreme metal can make it big. Ask Slipknot.
B000067CPX|5.0|I don't listen to the radio so current airplay of songs matters not to me.  I do agree with the folks who say it is possible to shed a tear while listening to this album.  Until you've had a shiver and a quiver while listening to &quot;Warm Tape&quot; let's just say you haven't lived.  I have loved the Red Hots since the days of Freaky Styley and I am more in love with their music now than I have ever been.
B000002TQB|5.0|Released just one year after their spectacular (but largely ignored) \\"Modern Life Is Rubbish\\" album, this album catapulted them into superstardom everywhere but the US, and with good reason.  It is nothing more or less than a superb guitar-pop album, and it broke down the walls for other bands to follow in their wake.<br />The highlights (difficult as it was to pick for something like this) are: Girls & Boys, Tracey Jacks, Parklife, Badhead, To The End, London Loves, and This Is A Low.  But this is better listened to as a coherent work, from beginning to end.  And if you do listen, you'll understand how much America missed out on by not picking up on them till \\"Song 2\\"
B000066NW0|5.0|This girl kicks ass!!! I'm in my 30's and don't buy much new music. I heard Complicated on the radio and loved it, so I went out and bought the cd. She has an awesome voice and the music is great! Every song is great. There are not too many albums out there where you can actually listen to the whole thing without skipping a song. I can totally relate to her songs. <br />I never write about anyone. I highly recommend you buy this cd. She's going places. It's nice to see she's not dressing like the other \\"girls\\" just to sell records. She doesn't need to she can really sing. JUST BUY IT!!! :-)
B00003CXAA|4.0|The novel, &quot;The Godfather&quot; was the first adult book I ever read. I have since read it twice more. It is rare that one can say that a movie is better than the book, but in this case it is true. Parts I and II are two of the finest movies ever made. Part III will always be up for debate. Personally, I did not care for it.<br />I found the box set, handsome and wonderfully presented. The added features were entertaining as well as informative. <br />If you are a movie fan, you have seen the three movies already. If you are not a movie fan you have to see this entire set.<br />Get it for someone during the holiday season this year.<br />Enjoy.
1573301183|5.0|Unlike a previous reviewer, I think Layne Staley's voice is outstanding at this show, the same way it always is.  Alice In Chains is so talented, they are just as comfortable in this acoustic setting as they are in hard rock like the albums Dirt and Facelift.  I was surprised they could do such an effective job converting loud, heavy rockers like Would? and Rooster into such great acoustic songs.  This concert is at least twice as good as Nirvana Unplugged in New York.  Alice in Chains is one of the most versatile bands ever, and Layne Staley is sorely missed.  For more live Layne footage, check out the VHS of Mad Season, Staley's side project with Pearl Jam's Mike McCready.  It just shows how talented this man was, and hopefully it will be released on DVD soon.
B00003W8NM|2.0|This film starts out with an interesting premise about a guy who's searching for meaning in his ordinary, boring life of conformity. It could have been a thoughtful film. Instead, it descends into a display of mindless anarchy and nihilism. This is an ugly film. Please don't waste your money and more importantly, your mind on this.
B00005QFE5|5.0|...Without question, at the heart of the film is a monumental yet simple story of true love in the purest sense, and of the devotion which renders that love eternal.  But the film transcends even that, and within the greater context indicates the impact of the past upon the present, which is summed up in a single line from the film:  \\"Know the past, know the present.\\"  And know, too, that the love portrayed in this story is the kind of love that is abiding, and that which sustains all that makes life worth living.  It's a veritable journey of the soul; one that will touch you deeply and linger in your memory long after the screen has gone dark.<br />Upon receiving the news that his father has died, Luo Yusheng (Honglei Sun) leaves the city to return to his home, a small village in the mountains, to bury his father and comfort his bereaved mother, Zhao Di (Yulian Zhao).  When he arrives, however, he discovers that his mother will not be consoled until her wish concerning the burial of her husband, Luo Changyu (Hao Zheng) is fulfilled.  In keeping with a long standing tradition and superstition, Di insists that his coffin be carried by hand by the men of the village along the road connecting the village and the city, insuring by so doing that in death Changyu will always be able to remember his way home.<br />Yusheng quickly finds that realizing his mother's request will be no easy task; their village is small and all of the able-bodied men have left for the city, leaving only children and those too old for such an arduous undertaking.  And it is winter, a harsh time of year in the mountains.  But Di is adamant, and so Yusheng sets about the business of fulfilling her request.  And as he does so, he reflects upon the story of his parents; a story well known throughout the village, for theirs was a love that was unbridled and boundless, the likes of which no one in the village had ever know before.  Or since.<br />This film, so wonderfully crafted and delivered by director Zhang, is altogether ethereal and transporting; he tells the story in simplistic terms, and yet it is in that very simplicity that he finds the genuine honesty and truth that provides such an emotional impact and makes this love story one that rivals any the screen has ever known.  Aided by the masterful cinematography of Yong Hou, Zhang achieves that same sense of transcendence that defines much of Akira Kurosawa's films, such as \\"Ran\\" and \\"Akira Kurosawa's Dreams,\\" or Ang Lee's \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.\\"  There is not a superfluous moment in the entire film, and Zhang proves that capturing pure emotion with the camera can express more than pages of dialogue recited by an actor.  And with his lens, Zhang opens up the very heart of the film and lays it bare for all to see and feel, finding more in the eyes of his characters and in their expressions than words could ever convey.  It's a study of human nature that is disarming in it's candor, and quite simply a brilliant piece of filmmaking by a director with an irrefutably incisive understanding of the human condition.<br />Without question, though, the single aspect that makes this such an unforgettable film is the performance (in her motion picture debut) by Ziyi Zhang as the young Zhao Di.  A young woman of exquisite beauty, she has a sublime screen presence that is a portrait of the angelic, and her innate ability to silently express the myriad emotions called for by her character is used to great effect by director Zhang.  Ziyi's portrayal is one of youthful innocence mixed with stubborn determination, which gives her character the necessary depth to be entirely convincing, and she will win you over in a heartbeat.  She is so affecting that near the end, when Di, now an old woman, is hurrying across a rickety foot bridge, the same bridge we've seen the young Di traverse many times on her way to and from the schoolhouse (which is central to the story), despite the weathered age so evident on her face,because of the lasting impression made by Ziyi, you realize that she still bears the heart of the young woman you've come to care so much about by this time, and you understand that age is superficial; that this is a shell housing the spirit and the true beauty that resides within.  It's a beautiful moment to behold, and ours forever, due to the extraordinary performance and presence of the delicate Ziyi Zhang, as well as the tremendous sensitivity and care with which she is presented by director Zhang.<br />The supporting cast includes Bin Li (Grandmother), Guifa Chang (Old Mayor), Wencheng Sung (Mayor) and Zhongxi Zhang (Crockery Repairman).  A love story told sincerely from the heart is a treasure that endures forever, like a painting by Monet or Renoir; and like those artists, director Zhang is nothing less than an impressionist behind the camera, capturing the distinctive rhythms of life and love for all time in \\"The Road Home,\\" a gentle, poetic film that will make it's way into the hearts of all who experience it.  And therein remain, forevermore.
B00006JL1Z|5.0|For anybody who is a Fleetwood Mac fan, and for those who are unfamiliar with the band this cd is a must have.  On this cd you will find most of the hits plus a few great songs that weren't played on radio much.   In my opinion Fleetwood Mac is the greatest Rock band of all time, and in this day and age when music is so manufactured I am thankful that they are still playing.  This is a great collection and should wet the appetite for the new album they are in the studio making right now.
B000021XS0|5.0|In todays age of pop drivel and &quot;bottom line - what have you done for me lately&quot; mentality, its hard to find an artists that will make music for themselves and do it successfully. Dream Theater has done just that.<BR>This is a true progressive metal album, and an expansion of the characters introduced in &quot;Metropolis Pt.1&quot; on &quot;Images And Words&quot;. It's a story album about a man named Nicholas who is the re-incarnation of a woman named Victoria. It is a mystery about how Victoria really died. <BR>It starts with a hypnotherapist counting backwards, hypnotizing Nicholas. An acoustic guitar comes for the song &quot;Regression&quot;. Then the keyboard gives off a high accent, and the music takes off.<BR>The best part about SFOM is it's balance between hard rock and soft ballads. And they are not afraid to show off their talents. Many songs have long instrumental interludes that are full of energy, and very precise and meticulous at the same time. The ending is mysterious and confuasing on first listen, but when you understand it, it makes sense (for those who don't know the meaning of the ending, e-mail me).<BR>Dream Theater's last album &quot;Falling Toward Infinity&quot; was so overburdened by the record company, and such an unhappy experience for the band that Mike Portnoy went to Electra and told them to let DT make the music they want, or there won't be a band. Fortunately for us, the music execs agreed. If this is the kind of music they put out when left alone, then for goodness sakes leave them alone.
0792151712|4.0|Granted, teenage girls went nuts over this film due to a sappy love story, but give TITANIC its due.  Utilizing state-of-the-art CGI and a relentless attention to detail, James Cameron successfully captures the human tragedy of April 15, 1912, when over fifteen hundred people perished in the icy waters of the North Atlantic.<br />Look beyond the contrived \\"poor-boy-meets-rich-girl\\" love story (wow, like that's never been done before), and even the annoying class warfare pitting the noble, hardworking poor against the arrogant, greedy rich (standard staple from the Hollywood left).  Focus instead on the numbing pathos of this disaster, which really happened.  Cameron brings the sheer terror of the event to the screen in all of its tragic dimensions, from husbands and wives being separated to countless bodies floating face down in frigid waters.  The magnitude of the tragedy, of the largest luxury liner in the world sinking on its maiden voyage, is vividly conveyed.<br />Incidentally, Billy Zane stands out wonderfully from an otherwise mediocre cast, but the strength of this film is not in its characters, but in the actual disaster itself.
B000002UEB|5.0|Every so often, on that rare occasion, when the moon is blue, you actually find a perfect album, one where every song is good. This is one of those albums.<BR>Whether or not it is based on the movie \\"The Manchurian Candidate\\", I cannot say. But the similarities in storylines are too obvious to ignore. And only a band like Queensryche can pull it off.<BR>The album starts in a hospital. A nurse gives a patient a shot to help him sleep. ...The music explodes right in your face and doesn't let go.<BR>This album is a combination of progressive metal and short radio-friendly songs. This balance helps tell the story without becoming overbearing or pretentious. The guitar licks of Chris DeGarmo are some of his best, and Geoff Tate is in high form. The rest of the band helps keep a balance while incorporating some intricate melody lines. <BR>This is an intelligent metal album that is equal with the ranks of Pink Floyd and Rush. The fact that their follow up album was \\"Empire\\" shows how talented these guys really are.
0385720920|5.0|What can I say he did it again? This is Palahniuk's funniest book yet and more odd than any other, even \\"Invisible Monsters\\". I was taken aback by \\"Choke\\" because it is not the same as the others. It has a special additive of fantasy entwined in it, which captivates the reader. As usual the main character, Vincent Mancini with his numerous sexual encounters and hilarious moments, leads the story into a web of uncertainty, confusion, and explicit sexuality whether in another woman's bedroom, the mile high club, or in the hospital where his mother is dying. I loved this book and recommend it to any one looking for a bizarre story that has a tremendous heaping of humor in it.
B000002J1M|5.0|Although I believe &quot;Lamb Lies Down On Broadway&quot; is their best musically, this has become my favorite. Starting out with a single keyboard chord, it quickly builds up, telling stories of humor, alienation and lost memories. The final track, &quot;Supper's Ready&quot;, is a 20 minute epic that is still one of their greatest musical achievements. <BR>If you are a fan of progressive rock, this is a must. Every musician's talents are showcased. Musically it is very complex without sounding like it. All the songs on this album are great.
B00005QZWJ|4.0|...but where is the lovely strings melody that is repeated heavily in the movie? I only hear it once, 1:54 into track 15, and there it's beefed up with an ascending brass movement behind it. Where's the original, less epic-sounding version of this wonderful melody?
B000002J1S|5.0|This is the best album Genesis ever released. This is a story album about Rael who gets \\"sucked\\" into an alternate world. Trapped, he tries to get out, going through many perils and encountering many characters. <BR>This showcases Genesis' musical talents, giving us layered songs and instrumentation. The different songs shift through many dynamics and styles, evoking the emotion experienced by the main character. <BR>It's too bad this was Peter Gabriel's last album with Genesis. If this was the direction they were going, think of what else they could have made.
0380977788|5.0|This is an amazing book. Coraline wanders into a world like hers, only terrifying! She has an \\"other mother\\" and \\"other father\\". Her other mother is very creepy- the way she looks at her hungrily- this book runs chills up your spine!
B000065V9N|5.0|One of the hardest jobs an artist has is to make an album commercially viable for sale, and yet stay true to your musical ideals. Peter Gabriel has managed to do that on this album. All the songs are well written and easy to digest. At the same time, you can tell immediately this is a Peter Gabriel album. <BR>The album starts with the lyrically haunting but musically catchy Red Rain - a strong start. It then moves into the radio smash \\"Sledgehammer\\" - a fun and funky song. The album alternates between the easily accessible to the moody and emotional with ease.<BR>Some of the great highlights on this album are not necessarily the hits. \\"Don't Give Up\\", featuring Kate Bush, is an encouraging song about and how to pick yourself up after failing. \\"Mercy Street\\" is dedicated to the poet Anne Sexton. And I still think \\"In Your Eyes\\" is a powerful song.<BR>It's fun to see an artist succeed with his or her own unique style, no compromises. PG has a great talent to do just that.
0064407667|5.0|I liked this book very much.  When I started to read it I couldn't put it down.  I read this book in 1 hour.  when the 3 Bauldelaire children find out that their parents have died in a fire they are sent to live with a horrible man named Count Oalf.  Count Olaf is out to steal their fortune and will do anything to get it.  Including killing one of the children.
6304666799|1.0|Swan Lake has suffered a lot in the past hundred years.  Few productions, with the exception of the act 1 pas de trois, the second act, and the Black Swan pas de deux, use the original choreography.  However, there has never been such a vulgar, tasteless prodcution as this.  Not only is the score and libretto butchered into a pretentious quasi-homoerotic, quasi-Oedipal fantasia but the choreography is boring, ugly, and cold.  Anyone who loves Swan Lake (or just good art period) should steer clear of this monstrosity.  Frankly, I can't possibly think of enough bad things to say about it.
B00005Y228|5.0|I orginally purchased this CD off the hype that &quot;Can't Get You Out of My Head&quot; created-I loved the song and took a chance on Kylie that the album would be as good as the single.<BR>Well, it sure was! The second I popped in it my car CD player I knew it was gonna be good. That was February 26th, it hasn't left my CD player since. All my friends (and my friends aren't into pop, they're into hard rock) liked the album-that says a lot for its appeal-and another friend I bought a copy for also loved it. She said quite eloquently that it's a CD you can listen to all the way through. <BR>This album was recently certified platinum in the USA-meaning 1 Million copies sold-so if a million others like it, it's gotta be a good CD. <BR>Here's a rundown of the songs-<BR>1. More More More- This opening track is probably the weakest song on the album. A poor opener, but it may grow on some people. <BR>2. Love At First Sight- The album's second single in the USA, this uptempo, sunny jam will have you singing along in no time to the fun chorus.  NOTE: The version of this song on the album is different than the radio version.<BR>3. Can't Get You Out Of My Head- Catchy or what? Who DOESN'T love this one? <BR>4. Fever- A hot jam with silly lyrics but a very catchy beat; you'll be dancing around to this one by the first chrous.<BR>5. Give It To Me- A funky 70s inspired track, very short at less than three minutes but sort of catchy. The song goes faster and faster to an explosive climax.<BR>6. Fragile- The most &quot;ballady&quot; song on the CD, but an uptempo ballad. You'll love it or you won't. It's like that. <BR>7. Come Into My World- A cousin of &quot;Can't Get You...&quot; and the album's third single. The la la la's of &quot;Can't Get You&quot; turn into Na na na's with a bouncing bass. It'll grow on you. The album version is different than the radio version.<BR>8. In Your Eyes- Internationally the album's second smash single but sadly a non-single in the USA. This songis very uptempo with a sneaky bass and groovy beat-another &quot;sing-along&quot; song that everyone will love.<BR>9. Dancefloor- Quick and happy with a fun beat. The vocals are very subdued and almost &quot;whispery&quot; and you'll wish YOU were on the dancefloor with Ms. Minogue after hearing this one.<BR>10. Love Affair- This song was a contender for a single for a while. A hot jam with a catchy and quick chorus- the perfect song to look at someone at a club and mouth the chorus to-&quot;I am only here for a little while/Would you like to take me out tonight?&quot; We'd all love to take Kylie out!<BR>11. Your Love-A great track, a song everyone will relate to. Kylie's vocals are warm and the bass spins-very cool.<BR>12. Burning Up- A strange closer, very experimental. An almost musicless simple verse lurches into a disco-heavy repetive chorus. Interesting, to say the least.<BR>Hope my review helps. Feel the Fever!
B000002JSV|2.0|&quot;Powerage&quot; is the weakest of the band's early records...coming on the heels of the excellent &quot;Let There Be Rock&quot;, maybe they were a little tapped out.<BR>A large part of the disc is unmemorable with only &quot;R'N'R Damnation&quot;, the hilariously great &quot;Down Payment Blues&quot;, &quot;Riff Raff&quot; and &quot;Sin City&quot; making any impression at all. The rest of the material isn't terrible by any means, just forgettable.<BR>For hardcore fans only.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|The Beatles latest released CD is really great. It's a compilation of their best songs over the years and a long compilation at that. each song is different from the next and usually way out there, on a topic that isn't popular. The songs will make you think about things from life in submarines to life on Penny Lane; Songs about love, to songs about hate. The things that I think I like the most about this CD is that I can listen to it when I'm mad or sad or angry or happy. There is a song on this CD for every mood and everytime because the songs are so outrageous and yet they are calm. Out of the countless songs that The Beatles wrote and sang, only around 30 of their greatest were put on this CD, which still left out many great songs. Anyone who likes The Beatles or oldies songs at all will fall in love with this CD.
B000002JST|4.0|Quite possibly their best early album. &quot;Let There Be Rock&quot; starts out kinda slowly with the weak &quot;Go Down&quot; and &quot;Dog Eat Dog&quot; (both throwaways that knock the release back a star) then recovers quickly, with the title track on down being some of the best hard rock of the era.<BR>The definitive version of the mighty &quot;Problem Child&quot; is here as well as &quot;Overdose&quot; which may very well be the best song still in the band's entire catalog. <BR>Almost always underrated and passed over, &quot;Let There Be Rock&quot; remains the best document of the band's early sound.<BR>Highly recommended.
B00005JK8K|4.0|Let's get one thing straight right off - legendary Hong Kong director John Woo does wonderful things for the action genre by turning violence into a sort ballet. Bullets fly, people leap, and sparks splash the screen in slow motion. Woo's take on the action genre has been copied a thousand times by lesser filmmakers... But realism is not Woo's strong suit. This being the case, one must wonder why he chose to direct a World War II film in a day and age when war pictures are more realistic than they've ever been (see SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and BLACK HAWK DOWN, for example). John Woo is perhaps the least likely candidate to head into the hell of war. And, really, did we need WINDTALKERS? War pictures have been so commonplace in recent times that their scenes of graphic violence are beginning to numb our sense of the dreadful. WINDTALKERS is not SAVING PRIVATE RYAN in Saipan (though the duplicate John Williams score will have you wondering). It's more like a throwback to guts-and-glory war films with a flare for the melodramatic. I'm not sure if this was intentional, but one thing is a definite - WINDTALKERS is melodramatic (sometimes the drama works, sometimes it doesn't). Oh, and there's plenty of combat - and not all of it is realistic. Nicholas Cage might as well be Rambo, really, considering the things he can accomplish on the field. <br />The premise of WINDTALKERS is a good one (even if it's less than accurate in its depiction of things), which places Native Americans in the midst of war as code-talkers who must be guarded by soldiers like Cage and Christian Slater (who does a great job with a fairly minor role). Then again, it's the CODE that must truly be protected, at all costs... And so in comes Adam Beach, who is essentially the hero of the story. Beach does a splendid job with his role, while the name of the picture, Cage, is hit-and-miss. Cage can definitely chew up the scenery if he's not cautious. It worked well in FACE/OFF, but WINDTALKERS isn't going forthe same silly tone.<br />In the end, WINDTALKERS is a fine film that lacks a bit in the credibility department, but still comes up with much of the stuff that makes this genre compelling. Had this film not followed on the heels of BLACK HAWK DOWN and WE WERE SOLDIERS, it could only have helped. As it is, it all seems like too little too late, but it's a good film all the same.
B000002JS0|4.0|\\"High Voltage\\" is a compilation of the best stuff from the band's first two Aussie releases for American ears. The material is really strong up to \\"T.N.T\\" and then doesn't recover from the filler until the great title track closes things out....it's that 15 minutes or so that keeps the disc from being a classic.<BR>Not a bad place to start though not the best place either, it remains a great purchase and a good forcaster of the even better \\"Let There Be Rock\\".<BR>The rest of the material from the Aussie records was reassembled as \\"Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap\\" following Bon Scott's death in 1980.
0140277447|5.0|This is a brilliant work of history.  Other readers who find<BR>the author biased are themselves perhaps biased against truth.<BR>That Japan's atrocities during the WWII era are not taken as<BR>seriously in the West as Germany's atrocities, is largely due<BR>to racism.  I.E. cruelty and savagery against Asians is not<BR>considered as newsworthy as cruelty and savagery against<BR>Caucasians.<br />This book was a best-seller when it was published and deserves<BR>an enduring place among literature.
B000002JS8|4.0|&quot;H.T.H&quot; is Bon Scot's swan song and the band's commercial breakthrough in the U.S. Several tracks went on to become hard rock classics, much like the CD itself. It has a cleaner, clearer sound courtesy of major league producer extrodinare Mutt Lange, which helped break it stateside no doubt.<BR>While a good hard rock release, it does contain a fair amount of dross..making it closer to &quot;High Voltage&quot; than the very solid &quot;Let There Be Rock&quot;. Even still, it's head and shoulders above other band's offerings in the same genre at the time.<BR>AC/DC ruled hard rock in the Bon Scott era (and even for a couple of years afterwards) &quot;H.T.H.&quot; goes a long way towards explaining why.
0920668372|5.0|My son's first grade teacher read this book to a classroom of adults on parents night. I wasn't the only parent that cried and couldn't stop.  Maybe it was the way the teacher read it out loud, maybe it was just the mood, whatever it was, there wasn't a dry eye in the room.  It was a favorite of my son's for many years. I also purchased the tape and we played it in the car many mornings on the way to school. Over the years I have bought this book as gifts for all new baby boys.

6302642256|5.0|I really loved this movie as a kid and I have looked for it for the last few years. I want to show my kids the &quot;special effects&quot; my day had. As well as the great joy I experienced as a kid. <BR>I REALLY hope Disney does remake of this on DVD I would and it to my collection in a sec.
B00006JL1Z|3.0|Simply put, the collection is not as complete as it could be.  Where is Bare Trees?  Any Fleetwood Mac that does not contain that song or material from the album of the same name can not is lacking.
B0000542D2|3.0|This DVD set of A Hard Days Night looks and sounds great, BUT they crop the print to give it a movie feel, and that is NOT necessary. The Bonus materiel (Interview with the filmmakers; with the Beatles cast; The Production Crew; Post Production Crew, etc.), is also OK, personally I am not into DVD bonus materiel unless its live footage of the band or unreleased songs, but most of the people I know who are into that stuff say on this set its not as good as it could have been. The Set also includes DVD Rom features (screenplay viewer, access to special web site, etc.), And least we forget a Hard Day's Night is a very fun movie. I think most Beatles fan's will like this set, BUT maybe wait and see if they do it better.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I can understand why some reviewers hated this movie.  It's loud, colorful, and trippy, with fast-paced and frenetic editing.  It's different than most of the items on, say, Blockbuster's \\"Top 10 Video Rental\\" list.  I don't recommend this movie to my \\"normal\\" friends, but I found it visually stunning, emotionally charged, and quite addictive.  I've watched it three times in the past week.<br />     Yes, the songs are obviously modern, too modern to really have existed in an actual ninteenth century theater.  But.  The director used songs that we, as a post-twentieth century audience, would connect with.  What song to better help us understand the agony of loving a prostitute than \\"Roxanne\\", even if it's been transformed into a sort of nightmarish tango?  How more clear can Satine express her moral views than with a \\"Diamonds/Material Girl\\" medley?<br />     Nicole Kidman was an absolute goddess in this movie.  I thought she and Ewan MacGregor took an extremely big risk by taking on an unconventional project like this.  They had to be over-the-top-in-your-face-balls-to-the-wall theatrical to create the carnival-like madness of Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge.  I feel that their efforts paid off nicely.<br />    If you're not a brave movie-goer, I would skip this one and get \\"The Scorpion King\\" or something.  Yes, that was a jab.
B00006J3WH|5.0|yeah, yeah some of the conversation and background noise it cut out - but i don't think that warrants taking stars off of this wonderfully unique and original work of art. I am a huge Buffy fan and applaud Joss Whedon and the cast, who all did their own work. For the Buffy fan - this can't miss.

B00003CXTG|2.0|I give the movies special effects 4 stars, but the actual plot and acting negated it back to 2. Ben Affleck is just plain horrible and Josh Hartnett did little to improve my low opinion of his acting skills. And I'd like to ask what happened to Alec Baldwin? He used to do movies like Hunt for the Red October, now he's doing bad General MacArthur imitations? Guess he shouldn't have passed on 'Patriot Games' for 'the Shadow' huh?<br />Well now that I've given my opinions on the actors, if you can call them that, let's get to the plot. It's not enough to recreate the film based upon the tragedy itself that occurred, we've got to have a love story in it? One that made me laugh histerically.<br />I mean this movie is just an over-budgeted flop that has attempted to get some of the attention that was stirred up when they recreated another tragic event to film, the Titanic.<br />Just like that other Affleck flop, Armageddon , this movie is great for those with the attention span of about 15 seconds. You know, like the average MTV viewer.
B00006AG5N|3.0|This is a very decent compilation, but it sounds very dry.  The producers have attempted to make this sound like a modern recording with mixed results.  If you want the ultimate sounding Elvis collection try to find the 24 Carats gold CD remastered by Steve Hoffman.

B00005JKJA|5.0|Stories usually have a series of nice parameters: the plot is mapped out clearly with an introduction, rising action, climax, denouement, and conclusion.  Many movie viewers expect and need this comforting, usual structure.<br />Real life is not often this tidy.<br />Mulholland Drive by no means follows the conventional rules of literary or dramatic structure.  If you want a nice, tidy, traditional exposition, avoid this film like the plague.<br />On the other hand, if you would like to be teased, puzzled, fascinated, stunned, confounded, intrigued, turned around, challenged, dazzled, confused, and/or amazed, this is a film for you.<br />As usual, Lynch blends images of stellar beauty with profound horror.  He has the skill of showing us the grotesque in the ordinary.  Why is the image of a kindly looking grandmother and grandfather-esque couple driving off in a limo so disturbing?<br />I have now watched this film three times in the past week (watched in the sense of putting in and playing the DVD).  I constantly watch scenes over and over (watch in the sense of playing them in my brain).  I frequently listen (again, in my brain) to the haunting musical score created by Angelo Badalamenti and David Lynch.  Lynch is a master of blending image and sound, and Badalamenti is a master at complementing Lynch's images and visions.  Roy Orbison's \\"Crying\\" is transposed into Spanish, and transformed into a remarkable torch song by Rebekah Del Rio (Playing herself.  Who is she?  Where did she come from?  Why can't I find an album of hers on this site?)  Badalamenti also appears in the film as a disgruntled espresso connoisseur.<br />I bought the French version of the CD from Amazon.fr.  It includes a few interviews, some clips of the Cannes Film Festival, a press conference with the cast, and a scene index of sorts.<br />In a nutshell, I adored this film.  It has soared into the ring of my all-time favorite films.  For me, Lynch is a master of the paradox of life, and one of the greatest artists in the visual image.

B00005JL1C|5.0|John Hughes (here as producer) has always put together some films about teenagers that made them filled with interesting traits, true feelings and genuine situations. Though this film is a bit far-fetched, it has the best characters (tomboy, skinhead, nerd, popular girl in school, rich fool). I've loved Mary Stuart Masterson since this film, and have made an attempt to see everything she's done since. Lea Thompson had the hardest part, trying to be cool and \\"real\\" at the same time. Eric Stoltz was never better looking, truly handsome, belying his previous role in \\"Mask\\" and future independent film projects, as well as carrying the lead role with genuine confidence. Elias Koteas is a real delight as Duncan, the skinhead; later he was in \\"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\\" as a romantic lead, and the great Terrence Malick used him to excellent advantage in \\"The Thin Red Line\\". This film really marks the beginning of many fine film careers. The use of current popular music in all of Hughes' films has always added to their appeal, as well as good writing. This was a little more brutal than \\"16 Candles\\", but it hit all the right nerves. Also, as a middle-aged baby boomer, the emotions involved, I must say, are as relevent now as then. It was also a pleasure to see John Ashton (\\"Beverly Hills Cop\\") as the dad; he plays the bewildered authority figure very well. The DVD release offers an excellent transfer of the film (1.85:1 LBX) as well as great sound. A true feel-good film, this is real entertainment and I wish there were more like it.
B00003CY5J|4.0|This is a film about two thieves who have been hooked up together by a common benefactor (Marlon Brando). Robert Deniro plays the aged veteran thief looking for that one final score to give him enough to retire on. While Edward Norton is the &quot;new blood&quot; who's worked his way inside of the installation with an absolutely brilliant performance as a mentally handicapped janitor. Norton really showed how good of an actor he is, he rivaled his performance from Primal Fear.<br />But this movie is sold on Deniro's acting. He carries the ending, it's great. You realize how good Deniro is when sells the ending perfectly. Brando's performance is decent, although he was a little difficult to understand at one point.
B00003CX9Q|4.0|If you read other reviews posted here, they say that this does not included the original movie, but the specs clearly say the second disc is the 1982 addition. This is because Steven Spielburg resently changed his mind and decided to included the origingal version with the special addition so that people wouldn't forget the original (as if that is possible). You do not have to shell out the big bucks for the full set to get both versions of the movie like previous reviews stated.
B0000009S3|5.0|Jazz Rock Fusion made much more sense on paper than it generally made in reality. But Frank Zappa, who in reality was much closer to classical and avant-garde orchestral music than to Charlie Parker, probably gave the jazz-rock concept the best ride it ever had with Hot Rats, and several of his other albums from the same period (Waka/Jawaka, Grand Wazoo, and parts of Uncle Meat, Burnt Weenie Sandwich and Weasels Ripped My Flesh).  This particular album also has the feeling of Brian Wilson, Van Dyke Parks and other late 60s Los Angeles studio czars who used the recording studio and session musicians like a paint box.  Ian Underwood should get co-billing for his unbelievable instrumental work on keyboards and woodwinds.  I'm not much of a fan of Zappa's satirical music, finding it increasingly forced and not particularly funny.  And some of his homages to avant-garde heroes like Edgard Varese seem to be simply derivative, aping the polytonalities but without soul.  But, to my mind, Zappa found his sweet spot with the type of music found on Hot Rats and the other albums I've mentioned, and I am certain these albums will be listened to long after the Valley Girl has retired to Cucamonga, and Tipper Gore has her own fashion museum.  They are simply brilliant, very entertaining, unique, totally creative and surprising, and (a word Zappa would've probably shunned) music with potentially universal appeal.

B00006J3T4|2.0|The latest cd from MK is in many way a disappointment! There is some good lyrics and MK has for sure improved his singing but that's not very unik. Where is that guitar-man we love to listen to? Golden Heart was nothing but excellent and I don't know how many times I have played that CD, and MK:s second solo album Sailing To Philadelphia was also great, but what happened to his latest recording? I use to admire Mark Knopflers music and especially -of course- his wonderful guitar playing, but MK:s latest effort is not what you would expect from such a talent guitarist and musician. MK, go back to what you once was! Or do you dont't really care about your guitar and your unik sound anymore? MK used to be able to put together some wonderful music but The Ragpickers Dream is nothing but some kind of ordinary recording and even if I try I have a hard time appreciate his latest album. The Ragpickers Dream is certainly not a \\"MK-guitar-picking-fans dream\\" in the record player:(
B00000IPAX|4.0|This CD is one of Blink 182's best CD's. Even though most of the lyrics are not laudable, they still give the songs a good rythm and beat, allowing the listener to really get into the song. Each song on the CD is unique and fresh, except for \\"All the Small Things,\\" which was on their previous CD, \\"Dude Ranch.\\" The CD is not too short and gives you plenty of Blink 182. Each song has a lot of bass, good vocals by both Tom and Mark, and excellent rythms played by their new drummer, at the time, Travis. The enhanced Cd feature is a definite plus, allowing you to see the behind the scenes video from the photo shoot for the cover of the CD. Overall the CD is well worth the price, and is a definite must have for all Blink 182, or punk rock fans.

B000002J20|5.0|I saw Yes perform this around a week before it came out. What a thrill and a let down at the time. We were expecting all the classics played, but instead they played these four songs that we did not know. It threw all at Miami Baseball Stadium for a loop. The band was in top form and played their butts off for us. Little did any of know just how good this was. They then played all the rest of their stuff, after Jon assured us to just sit back and enjoy. What a show and an album. Hard to get into but well worth it. For prog heads the world over.
B00006BTCA|4.0|Thankfully, the deluge of talentless bands such Staind and  Korn, et al (yes, you are truly unique if you think of a clever way to spell your band's name!) seem to be fading away.  Perhaps they can pick up Creed on the way.<BR>Anyway, this is a truly enjoyable album that does harken in some respects to those glory years of great music.  I do see some similarities to Joy Division and very early New Order, but feel other bands are a bit closer such as the underrated Kitchens of Distinction.  Honestly, I have difficulty understanding some of the lyrics, as is the case with the other bands they remind me of, but that's okay because I find the instrumentation to be superb.  I missed seeing these guys in SF a month ago when I hadn't yet purchased the CD, but will certainly attend on their return.
B000002UUH|5.0|John Lennon was brilliant. With Paul McCartney he was genius. What we see on this album is the genius that John was able to achieve without Paul (which makes some of us wish they had remained friends and co-writers).<br />Documenting the very best John Lennon solo songs from 1969 to 1980, this collection is nothing less than a must-have for any serious music or rock fan. Why? Because John had the knack for writing it all. Hard rock, soft rock, romantic rock, a touch of experimental, psychedelic rock...but he didn't call it any of those. It was just simply his music. John never liked to be labeled or classified in his life, and I think he would be happy that he is thought of as a great artist and musician and human, and not just a particular type.<br />\\"Give Peace a Chance\\" is what was once called a classic protest song. Yet it is a poignant reminder of what John stood for and how he died. Hard to listen to this song and not think of John.<br />\\"Instant Karma!\\" is another song of peace, and wonders why people spend so much time worrying about the unimportant things, and not enough time worrying about each other and the world we live in.<br />\\"Power to the People\\" is another song from the era of protests, getting right to the heart of John's belief that if all people banded together they could make the government do right.<br />\\"Whatever Gets You Thru the Night\\" is good rock and went to #1. Elton John jokingly bet John that this song would go to #1. If it went to #1 then John had to appear at one of Elton's concerts. The song did go to #1 and John appeared at an Elton concert in Madison Square Gardens, the last concert appearance by John Lennon.<br />\\"#9 Dream\\" is so very good. One of my favorite John Lennon songs. A very surreal and mellow song, bringing back memories of the psychedelic songs of the 60s. Ah! bowakawa pousse pousse.<br />Next is \\"Mind Games\\", a song about seeking answers in life. Of course the song says the answer is love, and anyone who looks beyond love has missed the answer. \\"Love\\" follows, a very simple song with minimal instrumentation that fits well with \\"Mind Games\\" given the essential theme of both.<br />\\"Happy Xmas (War is Over)\\" is another great song in the vein of protest songs. John was very anti-war, and many of his songs hold to the ideal that people have more important things to do than fight with each other.<br />Then comes \\"Imagine\\", once again a song about an ideal world, where the strife caused by religion and property and hate and greed and hunger are all gone, and we live together in harmony. This song will always be John Lennon's signature song.<br />From here the CD moves on to relationship songs. \\"Jealous Guy\\" is song about being jealous over his wife. John realizes that he broke with the very ideals he has espoused for so many years in his relationship with his wife. A great way to say \\"I'm sorry\\".<br />The next song is a fantastic cover of \\"Stand By Me\\" by Ben E. King, Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller. A very classy song by a very classy guy.<br />\\"(Just Like) Starting Over\\" is one of several songs from the album \\"Double Fantasy\\". This song did very well in the charts and helped make \\"Double Fantasy\\" a huge selling album. Good solid rock love song, just like \\"Woman\\", the song that follows.<br />\\"I'm Losing You\\" takes a different tack on love, where the singer realizes that somehow he and his significant other have somehow lost what made their relationship, and the two are growing apart. There are some good riffs in this song.<br />\\"Beautiful Boy (Darling Boy)\\" is an ode to John's son Sean. A bit of whimsy and pride, and a pretty song.<br />\\"Watching the Wheels\\" would seem to be John's explanation for why he dropped out of the music business. At the end of the song he says simply:<br />No longer riding on the merry-go-round,<br />I just had to let it go.<br />\\"Dear Yoko\\" is a faster paced song, and there is no need to explain what it is about. \\"Move Over Ms. L\\" would seem to be written about a female Lennon, but I have it on good authority that the song was written for Keith Moon. I can't credit my source, so we'll leave it as a mystery.<br />\\"Cold Turkey\\" has got to be the most bizarre song on the collection, and just goes to show what happens on a bad trip, or perhaps from going cold turkey. A touch of progressive in this song.<br />Enough details. John Lennon was a great. This collection has his very best (unusual in a \\"greatest\\" collection).

B00006JL1Z|5.0|Any Fleetwood Mac fan could easily burn themselves  a replica of this collection using previously released material from the boxed set, import singles, and earlier album releases. But to have it delivered in a nice package with bonus video material is a great thing for fans old and new. <BR>Yet another testament as to why this group of hyper-talented musicians has managed to stand the test of time - over and over again.

0790720434|5.0|&quot;The Secret Garden&quot; was a great movie! Has everything a movie needs and the book was great also. If you liked this movie, I think you would like the book also. The story is about how a young orphaned girl goes to her father's friend's home(more like castle) and finds the Secret Garden. She was once a spoiled brat but after finding the Garden, she gradually improves both physically and mentally. She meets Dicken, an animal charmer who is actually my favorite character, and also discovers her cousin Colin, who is an invalid.<br />This movie was really great. The book was great also and it is one of my favorites. This movie is definently something you have to watch.

B000002UJQ|5.0|Radiohead - OK Computer. You have read the good reviews, and the bad. My opinion? Every single bad review here is written from someone who obviously is missing the point by a mile and a half. Boring? Untalented? Such words merely reflect the mindless droning of people with minds too incompetent to give this album the chance it deserves.<br />At first listening, I thought OK Computer was some way short of The Bends. However, to truly appreciate this album do the following. Wait till it is night time. Turn off all your lights. Lay on your bed and put this on with some headphones.<br />Standout tracks include Paranoid Android, a swirling epic that has so many changes in style you wouldn't know it is the same song; Exit Music, a beautifully written and touching song, Karma Police, which goes on at a pace, and No Surprises, another beautiful song. Every song on the album is a great one though, with the possible exception of Fitter Happier, which was in retrospect a slice of what we were to expect from Radiohead in future years.<br />So all those who have rated this anything less than 4 stars can go back to their Limp Bizkits or their Linkin Parks, the manufactured face of a pathetic new wave of the music industry. For anyone else, this album is a must buy.
B00005Q3KC|5.0|Have you ever bought a 'greatest hits' album only to find it swimming in filler tracks? Fear not, discouraged music listener! This record reflects its title; it IS the best of the Corrs.<br />In 1995, the Irish siblings released their first single, 'Runaway', and the music world was forever changed. Suddenly, tin whistles, bodhrans, and violins were playing alongside drum sets and electric guitars in some of the most  beautifully-crafted songs ever recorded. <br />All of the albums are well-represented on this collection. The early works from \\"Forgiven Not Forgotten\\" are here, from the gentle 'Runaway' to the dark 'Forgiven Not Forgotten'. Smash \\"Talk On Corners\\" adds classics such as the vivid 'Only When I Sleep', the sexy 'I Never Loved You Anyway', the gentle 'What Can I Do' and the youth anthem 'So Young'. The MTV \\"Unplugged\\" comes in with the melancholy 'Radio', as well as two live tracks, the instrumental 'Lough Erin Shore' and the touching cover of REM's 'Everybody Hurts'. \\"In Blue\\" is here as well, featuring the radio sensation 'Breathless' and the brilliant 'Give Me A Reason'.<br />As well as their past hits, the Corrs present fans with two new songs, both worthy of 'best of' status. 'Will You Be Happier?', a hit single in Europe, is about the uphill battle for perfection, while the catchy 'Make You Mine' is about the wait for love. <br />Few bands can accumulate so many hits in such a short time span (six years). The Corrs, however, are, as always, the exception. Every song here is a destined to be a classic, and some are already. Want a great sampling of the Corrs' music? This is it. Fillers not included.

0316666343|3.0|...This novel is both obsessed with serial rapist/killers and written in a mystical spirit with the belief that the dead watch us and are always flitting among us.  Although the day to day life of the Salmon family is rendered realistically, much of the action is implausible, and you need to accept that to enjoy the book.  We have to believe, for example, that some people can just sense the presence of evil and know when they are standing on the spot where a woman was murdered.  Some readers who have given the book a negative review are probably bothered by the mix of realistic detail and horror/fantasy elements. The part of the book that I liked least was the dwelling on the ongoing life of Susie's rapist/murderer.  I felt I was being drawn into an obsession of Sebold's, especially when the character of Ruth begins to sense the spirit of violated women and Susie herself, in heaven, starts meeting with other victims of her killer.  There is a definite subtext about the violence that afflicts women and children in our world.  Even the killer has an epiphany recognizing that to be a woman or a chid is to be in danger.  Fortunately there are a few positive male characters in the book to offset the general tone that women are always at risk, or at the very least oppressed by motherhood.  The parts of the book I liked best had to do with what it's like to be a teenager, as shown through the experiences of Susie (even in \\"heaven\\") her sister, and her friends Ray and Ruth.  I believe this book will especially appeal to those who believe in an afterlife and who feel the presence of their dead loved ones--or who strongly wish they could.
B00004STPT|3.0|* No cabe duda de que es un gran trabajo. Los temas principales son 'Progeny', 'The Battle', 'Patricide', 'Elysium', 'Honor Him' y el bello 'Now We Are Free'.<BR>* Para los que le gust la pelcula y la msica es una excelente adquisicin. Sin embargo, yendo a una crtica sobre la creacin de Zimmer y Gerrard, debo decir que me molestaron las excesivas referencias. 'Am I Not Merciful' tiene mucho de Grecki. 'The Might of Rome', de Wagner. 'Marte, el Guerrero', de la Suite 'Los Planetas', de Holst tambin resuena en algunos fragmentos. <BR>* Analizando la banda de sonido, podemos percibir que el manejo de orquestacin de Zimmer es bastante dbil, comparado al de otros (Williams, Goldsmith, Rota, Silvestri). Las lneas meldicas son demasiado simples, no hay contrapunto, o mtodos que enriquecen la partitura, como la passacaglia, ostinato, etc. Pareciera que la msica original se hizo en teclado de sintetizador y luego se adapt a &quot;orquesta&quot;, pero cometiendo negligencias a la hora de orquestar. El uso de la percusin es muy deficiente, y por otro lado, hay un abuso de las cuerdas. Es decir, no hay una nutrida mezcla de los distintos colores orquestales. <BR>* De este modo, al escuchar el CD, y ver nuevamente la pelcula, pueden apreciarse con mayor claridad las debilidades de Zimmer como compositor de msica para pelculas. Quizs estaba consciente de ello y por eso pidi prestado talentos externos como Lisa Gerrard(fantstica), y los &quot;clsicos&quot;.<BR>En resumen, un gran CD, pero para el entendido, una obra que produce sentimientos encontrados, sobretodo si el que lo escucha gusta -entre otras- de la msica clsica y de la msica para pelculas, como en mi caso.

However, although the sound on this album/CD is great, it is too \\"studio-ized.\\" You do not feel (or hear) the excitement of the audience. You hear the song and instruments as if the microphones fed them into a basement, and that's how the mix sounds to me. As I stated, I was at 3 shows, and although the music sounds like it did live, the sound doesn't. It doesn't even come close. I have a 3 album set bootleg (Los angeles, June 1976; red, white, blue vinyl) that kicks this CD's butt as far as reproducing what the concerts were like. If you are interested in \\"experiencing\\" the concert, buy the bootleg, skip this one. I'm not knocking Paul or the performance.

0140186409|3.0|I read OF MICE AND MEN in high school and still remember the book fondly.  I couldn't believe that I had never read more than bits and pieces of THE GRAPES OF WRATH and decided recently that I wanted to read this classic book.  I must say that although I enjoyed the book and liked the characters much of the book seemed preachy and heavy-handed.  The pages also seemed to drag on and on and on... Finally, I don't want to spoil the book for those of you who haven't read it yet, but the closing scene completely through me for a loop and will give me the &quot;heebie-jibbies&quot; for the rest of my life.
B0000029DD|5.0|If you don't know Jeff Buckley, then you're in for a bittersweet listen. &quot;Grace&quot; has been one of the most influential pieces of music in my collection. I give out at least 2 copies to new friends every holiday season, and am always thanked later.<br />His passing created a ripple in the music industry that is still being felt years later - My favorite album of the 90's.<br />Make sure to listen intenly to the lyrics of &quot;Lover You Should Have Come Over&quot; - I still get the chills.
B00005TT77|5.0|...  I Am Sam the movie was one of the stinkiest things I've seen in the last year and a half.  The soundtrack is absolutely phenomenal however. <br />Weird thing is, I dig the songs that sound the least like the original Beatles' recordings the most.  I think the Grandaddy cover of Revolution is absolutely inspired, and does a great job of illustrating what a great cover can be - unique, even in its sameness.  It take a masterful hand to light up someone else's song in a completely different way, especially when you're dealing with a juggernaut group like the Beatles.  I loved Paul Westerberg's cover, and Nick Cave brought his typical darkness to \\"Let It Be\\" that really changed it for the better.   Also, don't miss Ben Harper's cover of \\"Strawberry Fields Forever.\\"  It's incredible. <br />My least favorite tracks were the Black Crowes, Sheryl Crow, and The Vines.  Thanks guys, but if I wanted to hear the Beatles version of a song, I'd listen to it.   <br />These psychotic Beatles-devotees have got to take up knitting or something.  I can't even believe how worked up they're getting over an album of covers.  I guess it's nice that something still holds emotional value, but from the reaction, I'm expecting some Paul McCartney shrines lit up with Ringo-shaped candles. <br />Look.  Get this album.  It grows on you.  It's great.  Unless you're a psycho death hand Beatle fanatic or something and the thought of hearing the words of a Beatles song coming out of anyone's mouth besides the original four makes your crazy little pinhead explode.
B000001ELD|1.0|Gene Simmons never stopped criticizing the solo-effort of his collegue Peter Criss. But where Criss really tried to make a 'solo' album, not a great one but a good one, Simmons never came any further than hiring a couple of famous names, without even considering taking time to write a decent tune. This resulted in one of the worst Kiss albums ever. It contains a couple of decent songs, but most of the songs are rock-musical based tunes that are just not good enough. Wanna buy one of the solo-albums? Don't go for this one...

I do belive by reading Frank McCourt's book anyone can see how good they really have it at home!
B00005JKNF|4.0|Gosford Park is a highly entertaining British upstairs/downstairs whodunnit set in a 1930's stately home, which examines the social relationships and etiquette of the era and is filled with excellent one-liners and an excellent cast.<br />Opening with a cross-section of British high society arriving at a stately mansion for a weekend shooting party along with their servants at Gosford Park, it is not long before the upstairs downstairs politics of master and servant (illicit sexual trysts, dodgy business deals and unspoken heirarchy's are revealed). Eventually of course the bitter politics and sordid double-dealings lead to the murder of the lord of the manor, Sir William McCordle (Michael Gambon) and so the movie transforms from social commentary (with black comedy) to a whodunnit murder mystery. Although, as is eventually revealed, its less of a whodunnit and more of a who cares because it transpires that Sir William was such a loathsome and morally reprehensible character that his  loss is mourned by (next to) nobody. And so with a houseful of suspects, both upstairs and downstairs, the task of solving Sir William's murder is assigned to the hapless Inspector Thompson (Stephen Fry), a dithering idiot who contaminates the crime scene and is bullied by the aristocrats. He ignores all the obvious clues much to the frustration of his uniformed working class assistant, whilst the guests try to conceal their deepest darkest secrets.<br />For Gosford Park, a kind of cross between Remains of The Day and an Agatha Christie novel, Director Robert Altman has assembled the cream of British acting talent and provided them with a sparkling script by screenwriter Julian Fellowes. Full of wit and insight, the script provides wonderful material for all its excellent ensemble cast which includes, above stairs; Michael Gambon is the grumpy lord of the manor and Kristin Scott Thomas (The English Patient) his very elegant but dissafected wife. Charles Dance (White Mischief) plays 'war hero' Lord Stockdale, and Geraldine Somerville (Arthur/Harry Potter) his wife. The excellent Jeremy Northam (The Net/Enigma/Emma) is acclaimed songwriter Ivor Novello, and James Wilby (Howard's End) plays the Honorable Freddie Nesbitt, to name but a few.<br />Downstairs the servants include; Ryan Phillipe (Cruel Intentions/Antitrust), Helen Mirren (2010/The Mosquito Coast), Richard E. Grant (Withnail and I/Bram Stoker's Dracula), Alan Bates (The Sum of All Fears, Women In Love), Derek Jacobi (Gladiator/Dead Again), Emily Watson (Angela's Ashes/Breaking The Waves/Red Dragon), Clive Owen and Kelly MacDonald. Particularly good amongst this cast are (perhaps surprisingly) Clive Owen (Croupier/The Bourne Identity), who is a good bet to be the next 007, and Kelly MacDonald (Trainspotting) as Mary, Lady Trentham's Lady's Maid. However it is Dame Maggie Smith (Harry Potter/The prime of Miss Jean Brodie) that steals the show as the acid tongued Lady Trentham.<br />This is undoubtedly Robert Altman's best movie for some time perhaps since The Player and definitely since Short Cuts. Infinitely superior to Altman's last outing, the ill-judged Dr T and the Women, Gosford Park is a very elegant movie performed by a faultless cast and even if the ending is a little flat and unsatisfactory, Gosford Park is never less than entertaining.<br />Four stars ****r hero' Lord Stockdale, and Geraldine Somerville (Arthur/Harry Potter) his wife.

B00005R2M3|5.0|Shakira has succeeded in creating an innovative style that is unlike any other genre today. In her CD, &quot;Laundry Service,&quot; she mixes pop, Latin techniques, and even Arabic influences. In her song, &quot;Ojos Asi,&quot; she fuses Arabic lyrics and music with her own unique style to create a work that is not corny at all but rather one of the CD's best songs. Using a variety of instruments and rhythms, Shakira produces all of her own songs and lyrics. Her voice is part of her superb style. When she sings, her voice is completey real and her lyrics are even more genuine. This is something that most female &quot;sensations&quot; of today cannot say. She sings beautiful ballads in both English and Spanish. Three of her songs on this CD have become hits. Though not all of the songs on the CD are award winners, most are good and more than half are of superior quality.
B00000IPAX|4.0|This CD is one of Blink 182's best CD's. Even though most of the lyrics are not laudable, they still give the songs a good rythm and beat, allowing the listener to really get into the song. Each song on the CD is unique and fresh, except for \\"All the Small Things,\\" which was on their previous CD, \\"Dude Ranch.\\" The CD is not too short and gives you plenty of Blink 182. Each song has a lot of bass, good vocals by both Tom and Mark, and excellent rythms played by their new drummer, at the time, Travis. The enhanced Cd feature is a definite plus, allowing you to see the behind the scenes video from the photo shoot for the cover of the CD. Overall the CD is well worth the price, and is a definite must have for all Blink 182, or punk rock fans.
B0000020C4|3.0|I like the orchestral work behind this recording. As a violist and composer, im particularly attentive to background accompaniments to these kinds of things. But honestly, Marious is absolutely hideous. Every time Marious sings, it sounds like he's sitting in a vibrating massage chair. His vibrato is so wide and fast the entire time you cant focus on what you're hearing, all you know is you're getting motion sickness. Its completely distasteful. I can understand that in certian places, you might intend to sound nervous or upset, but I mean this guy has no control over his voice at all. feel free to email me if you want a sample MP3 of what im talking about.
B00006L3LD|5.0|I've owned this album for nearly a year, and I decided I owe it to Incubus and to anyone who doesn't own this album to write a review. Morning View is a great album. At first I didn't like it as much as Make Yourself or S.C.I.E.N.C.E., I thought they &quot;sold out&quot; because the sound was different than what I expected. But then the obvious became more clear with every time I listened to Morning View... this is a totally unique sound - incredible music, brilliant lyrics, superb vocals by Brandon Boyd. No, Incubus definately has not sold out. They are simply evolving as a band, and growing in talent. Morning View is an incredible work of art by a band that you can expect plenty more from in the future. And if you haven't seen this band live, get yourself some tickets! The Morning View tour is incredible, I saw them in Cincinnati where I live and it was probably the most fun I've ever had... they were perfect!

B00005V9HH|5.0|I've owned this move in VHS, DVD, and now enhanced DVD. I don't think I've done that with any other movie in our collection. Every actor's performance, although written to be over the top, just works perfectly. You buy into the characters and there motivation so easily, they seem like weird friends that you've known forever. We've love to share this movie with people that have never seen it, just to watch their reaction and their faces light up when they put it all together. I can't praise this movie enough. Especially with the holiday season coming up, I can see no better present than a wonderfully written, seamlessly portrayed, SMART movie that your friends and loved ones will thank you for.
0767903862|4.0|I didn't know anything about Australia before reading this book.  Bryson goes into detail about history, creatures and plants.  That gets tedious for some readers.  But it made me want to go to each city on my own.  This was the perfect book to read before my trip to Oz.

B00006IUL7|3.0|This movie was so compelling in the begining.  The plot for the first hour and a half and acting were excellent. Al Pacino is excellent as usual.  Excellent cinematography and boy it really grabs you; However, all that build up and the ending was so predictable.  My guest and I were saying, &quot;What the heck was that&quot;.  When the credit rolled we were sitting there with our mouths open.  Was that it?  Did we miss something?  All that great acting and that ending?  It is worth seeing simply because Al Pacino and Robin Williams are in it.  I give it 3 stars for the cast and cinematography.

B00006JDVV|4.0|For those of use who grew up with the wonderment of dragons and other medieval creatures, this is a fun film. I usually walk in as a skeptic of the D&D genre in movies, because it seems the people making the films never had the childhood interest. Of course this is my interpretation of films like Dungeons & Dragons, Dragonslayer and the like. I always give them a chance, even if I end up disappointed. RoF did not disappoint.<br />RoF takes an interesting approach to dragons and holds to it fairly well. The characters are sound actors and lightly developed. the nice thing about the character development is that they maintain it throughout. The two lead men don't end up buddies as seen in many films. They represent the two types of people in our society. Some hide and some fight. I felt like they were having political debates at some points, because they really had differing ideas about how to survive.<br />The film is dark and dreary as should be expected by what the world has come to. The cinematography is good and the visuals are kept under control. They really made sure the dragons were not these pretty and colorful beasts. Some reviewers didn't like the 3D, but I think it is because of the low key graphics. There is only enough 3D to get the job done. The movie doesn't take the easy road of everyone survives either, which is nice. I think that is the saving grace of the film; it is not completely over the top. Dragons have resurfaced in the modern world, which by itself is already over the top. I felt like someone who grew up with mythology made this film.<br />If you haven't seen RoF and you like the genre, you'll enjoy this film. Of course, this is only my opinion.

B00005JKCF|1.0|The movies \\"Shrek\\", \\"Superman\\" and \\"The Fifth Element\\" are among my favorites because of the animation and special effects.  Based on the reviews of the critics and other viewers I anticipated that \\"Spider-Man would excel in some of the same attributes as these movies such as interesting and engaging storyline and good acting as well as first rate special effect and animation.<br />In \\"Spider-Man\\" the special effects were so repetitive that I wondered if they were the same ones used over and over.  The story line, for me, droned on with little purpose or interest.  A soliloquy by Spider-Man in the last scene typified the acting in that it was wordy, delivered like it was from a middle school play and spoiled the possibility of a satisfying ending with an obvious setup for a sequel.  Finally, the villain wore a solid mask which looked, to me, like a way to avoid the expense of additional animation.<br />With all due respect to the critics and others who loved the move, what you all saw, I missed.  I wrote this because I find the negative reviews equally helpful, often even more so when I disagree.  I hope you find this, along with the positive reviews, helpful in drawing your own conclusions.
B00000DLV1|4.0|Portishead, despite releasing only two studio albums, have been one of the most influential acts in modern music. Along with Massive Attack and notable others, they helped give birth to the nebulous non-genre of \\"trip hop,\\" which, in the case of Portishead, can be described as \\"lazy hip-hop-esque beats spliced with a musical sensibility straight from the 1940's and a talented female vocalist.\\" On their two studio albums, which are both worth picking up, Portishead relies heavily on studio trickery to help deliver their patented style of chilling, distant, brilliant composed and profoundly sad music. How would such an obviously studio-centric band handle the daunting leap to a live performance?<br />With surprising grace and aplomb, actually. With only a few dips, the quality level is superb here. The anal-retentive nature of the band really pays off, as Portishead, complete with backing orchestra, sound incredibly polished and rehearsed. To be blunt, this band is one of the tightest you will ever come across. Everything seems to be planned and meticulously executed, like a military strike, or brain surgery. This approach is to the benefit of the listener.<br />Tracks such as 'Humming,' 'Cowboys,' 'Mystyrons,' 'Strangers,' and 'Over' come alive with new, startling emotion. The same musicial brilliance as the studio cuts remains, but the sheer power of the songs in their live incarnations is an awesome thing to behold. The timpani on 'Over' thunders live, where it simply thudded in the studio. Mystyrons is a high-strung epic masterpiece building to a glorious climax. The ugly 50's sci-fi of the studio verison of 'Cowboys' is transmuted into raw rage by the live version. For the most part, the songs improve drastically live, (which is really saying something, as Portishead is an excellent studio band.)<br />There are a few mis-steps, however. While the rock-out at the end of 'Sour Times' is jaw-dropping and visceral, the first four minutes of the song I could easily trade in for the James Bond-esque studio version. Portishead was never meant to be a grunge or punk band, and the live incarnation of Sour Times shows this. <br />The other mistake would be 'Roads.' While an already sad and delicate song could become even more fragile and ethereal live, the audience sees fit to begin clapping along, as if the concert is a country hoe-down. This human drum loop is not appreciated, and detracts from a potential moment of beauty.<br />However, the moments of pure and amazing power - so surprising in such a formerly subdued band - make the mistakes more than forgiveable. If you are looking for a good entry into the world of Portishead, this is the cd for you.
B00005LB50|2.0|This box set was a huge disappointment.  Not because of the music (which is excellent), but because it is not comprehensive (some key songs are missing) and all the songs on the entire 4th are included elsewhere on the other 3 CD'S!  They should have put four albums on 2 CD's (the three regular albums along with the unreleased \\"Stampede\\") and made 2 CD's of live and previously unreleased songs.  <br />I suspect this was out of (surprise! surprise!) greed on the part of the record company, forcing the consumer to buy a whole extra CD for two or three missing songs.<br />And record companies wonder why people prefer to get their music from the internet...
0793518326|5.0|I was given this book as a gift and was amazed at both the quality of the work as well as the quantity of information contained. Any Beatles fan MUST own this book.  If you can sing or play an instrument there are hours of enjoyment to be found.  If you only want to sing along with your CD's, you'll find whatever song you want in this marvelous collection of scores. I had no idea how many Beatles tunes I had never heard.  Grab your instrument and your MIDI and there is nothing you can't do.  This book is great for ALL Beatles fans, whether they just want the sheet music for reference or plan to play covers of the songs with their bands or solo.  If you want your Beatles collection to be truly complete, don't miss out on this great buy.  On top of that, if you follow Beatles memorabilia, you know that the value of this book will increase greatly with time...

0201633612|5.0|I used to think that OOP was all about building elaborate class hierarchies. Reading this book I realize I was wrong. Large hierarchies lead to inflexible design.

Clocking in at 78:39, the album is jam packed with his very controversial thoughts that are laid out in a fashion that will blow any ones mind.

B00005JKCH|5.0|From what I heard, this DVD is going to be a must have. It has commentary by the director and a lot of behind the scenes things to watch. A lot of people saw this movie in a theater, but they should watch it at home too.<br />Spiderman was a neat movie. It has a cool lovestory with Peter Parker and Maryjane. But the best part is all the cool special effects. Spiderman swings all over the city just like Tarzan. Or I guess Spiderman! It will be perfect to watch the movie on DVD because the special effects will look sharp and realistic just like at the movie.<br />Its also full of funny jokes, like Spiderman's first outfit. He starts as a wrestler, and has to make a suit out of sweatshirts and stuff. Spiderman also makes fun of the bad guy, Green-Goblin. He calls him Gobby for short, which makes Gobby mad.<br />There's some tragic parts too. Spiderman learns a lesson when he lets a crook escape. He becomes a well rounded superhero because he can be both funny and sad...
0767836286|5.0|I'll keep it short. I first saw this movie at a theatre in Omaha (weekday matinee) and didn't know what to expect. I was glued to the screen the whole time. I kept watching, even though I had just consumed a large soda and needed to go..I just couldn't miss what was going to happen next. The last 20 minutes was one of the most incredible ends I have ever seen on film.  NO ONE expected it. The audience was absolutely silent as they left the theatre. It went totally against the grain of similar movies where the good guy saves the day. Tim Robbins gives his best (and most menacing) performance here. I highly recommend it.
B00004TDTO|5.0|At its heart, &quot;Jaws&quot; is simply a monster movie.<br />But it's a monster movie with depth, humor, and skillful direction. The performances are flawless, and the special effects are (for the time) quite good.<br />Of course, &quot;Jaws&quot; is so frightening because the shark is no imaginary creature. As you swim in the ocean, you never know what is beneath you--sharks are the ultimate &quot;monsters under the bed.&quot; The shark in this film is a malevolent force of nature, preying on a small seaside town.<br />&quot;Jaws&quot; had a famously difficult production, and the DVD features a decent recounting of the tribulations faced by the cast and crew. It's difficult to believe that such a cursed film turned out so well.<br />The film looks great on DVD, and the bonus material is (for the most part) entertaining. Sadly, Steven Spielberg refuses to add commentary tracks to his films. Even so, &quot;Jaws&quot; is an essential addition to any DVD collection.
B00005JKG7|5.0|This is without a doubt the best horror film I have seen, and I've seen many. In spite of a low budget and lack of backing from a major studio, John Carpenter even surpasses his excellent Halloween movie with The Fog. I've watched this movie more times than I can count. The setting is perfect; the small coastal town of Antonio Bay (which is really parts of Inverness and Point Reyes Station, CA) and the awesome Point Reyes lightstation. I've visited these places several times and they're worth the trip.<br />What makes the movie so special is the musical score. It really sets the mood and makes it all the more creepier. I also liked  the cast chosen: they played exceptional roles. My favorite scene is where the three fishermen encounter Blake's ghost ship, the Elizabeth Dane. What a fantastically creepy first encounter with Blake and his crew.<br />Anyway, you MUST watch this movie in the dark, with the surround sound cranked up. Damned scary! Here's a little-known bonus for you: Pay attention to Father Malone's Diary. If you pause the scene as he is turning the pages of the Diary, you'll find some interesting notes!
0316666343|3.0|&quot;The Lovely Bones&quot; is a book full of warmth, love and mystery. Susie Salmon, a 14-year-old girl, had been murdered and was brought to heaven for ever. From there, she watched her family and all of her intimates living without her. To Susie, all these were not easy to go. Her sorrow was so exquisite. And she couldn't help feeling nervous and concerned for all her loves, in a place from where she's far away, though.<br />I like this book not only because the attractive cover lured me to read, but the minute affections that the writer can describe in the story. No matter the joy or sadness of the characters, it also impresses me a lot. Other than that, the memories which Susie usually recalled are amazing, like her sweet experience with Ray........^,^<br />However, I found this book quite difficult to understand, lots of vocabularies I have never heard of and the many characters made me confused all the time. My feeling is that it may only suitable for native speakers. I think there's a room for improvement.<BR>Nonetheless, I still love the overall story as well as Susie Salmon.

Some of you people with the low reviews saying that they shouldn't have let their three year old child watch it because it is gross, cruel, and bloody you musn't have seen the movie because this movie have no gore or blood and yeah it may have cruel parts at times but hello that is why it is rated PG which means Parental Guidence that is why most children aren't allowed to see it without their parents near by so you people saying it is a violent film have not seen it or known the rating. Also this is a great movie it is up there on my top movie list and I am a big movie buff. This movie has so much imagination it is unbelievable. This movie has great detail and the music is great!!!

It is the best Burton film yet!!!<BR>This movie is so great we decorate our house for halloween with christman and halloween stuff and have created scene murals from the movie.(Our town has a halloween decoration contest)<BR>THIS MOVIE RULES!!!!<BR>watch the movie before you write the review!!!!
B00006AG5N|4.0|In 1987, RCA released a one-disc Elvis compilation called The Number One Hits that featured 18 tracks. So how did the label come up with 13 additional songs?  The 1987 compilation only featured the famous songs.  The new compilers have used the major pop charts in both the U.S and U.K. to determine inclusions. The tracks have all been remixed from original masters.  Elvis has never sounded better.  The voice is crisp and clear, not the distorted version.  One can hear the little details in the songs, such as a guitar lick or a piano sound that are more prominent than before.  These little details also make the song annoying.  Despite the complaints, this is arguably the best single disc Elvis has to date.
B00006IU73|5.0|With the release of In Absentia and the new label, there should be no excuse why P-Tree shouldn't become a major force in the music industry.   Steve Wilson and company really did a nice job on this one.  There isn't a bad track on the whole CD...it's one of those cd's that gets better and better with each listen.  My favorite pieces on In Absentia are: .3, The Sound of Muzak, Gravity Eyelids, Strip The Soul, Wedding Nails and Prodigal. This is a great CD to put on and play from begining to end, which is rare these days.  The band is touring the US from the end of October throughout the month of November.  If they are anywhere near your city you should get out and see them, you won't regreat it.  The Tree Rulz!!! \m/
B0000640VO|5.0|This movie captures the essence that is Paris. Great cinematography and excellent editing, most inportant of all, a story with heart. It is a praise to life; to every samll joys one can enjoy and about never giving up. It makes you want to hop on the next airplane and just fly to Paris. It is common for European movies to stress destiny and fate, still, this is a journey worth taken.
0393317552|3.0|After reading this book, and many of the reviews here, I am more than ever convinced that concision is a virtue!<br />The author presents the thesis that environmental causes were responsible for the hegemony of  primarily Eurasian peoples (some Chinese) over the rest of the world. It is provocative and perhaps controversial to some. What I find missing in the book is any consideration of the role of gender in society and of religion apart from its role in nation building in more &quot;civilized&quot; societies. <br />To give just two examples, many anthropologists and archeologists think that early Neolithic Cretan culture was in some respects matrifocal; it was &quot;advanced&quot; in terms of architecture and art but not warlike. Some scientists believe that there were a number of such cultures, yet how  matrifocality and nonaggression may have played a role in Eurasian history is not touched upon here.<br />Similarly, the author goes to great pains to show how Aboriginal Australians were prevented by environmental factors from developing agriculture. Yet he does not even mention their often breathtaking telepathic and locational abilities, unsurpassed anywhere else in the world, nor does he touch upon their highly original art or their eco-friendly religion. <br />In sum, the book tries not to privilege Eurasian societies but it cannot help privileging normative eurasian culture.
B00005JG6Q|5.0|Katsuhiro Otomo's master piece that is Akira can only be called superb. It is now a cult classic and though many other animes have been released that boast even better animation than it for some reason Akira still tops them off as a better film. Perhaps this is because of the excellant balanceing of many different elements to the film, as well as shear class.<br />Akira has everything. It has real characters that are thrust from a world that does not want or care about them into a supernatural world of awe and grandeur. Fastly paced action and chase sequences are quickly followed by sci-fi style combat as individuals use their mere thought to rip apart the Neo-Tokyo landscape that is their battle field. As well as this the film also has a well structured story that centres around two biker gang teenagers-one is Tetsuo, a youth that was bullied and ridiculed by others who is then given god-like powers; the other is Kaneda, a well like individual that has acted as a leader and friend to Tetsuo though finds that he must confront and kill the omnipitant force that has become of his friend. What also makes the film is a sombre and some times brooding musical score that leaps with life at one moment and is quiet and mournful the next.<br />Akira has charcter; class; as well as guts to create a truely epic and original expierinace that will not leave your mind for some time.<br />This is Cinema.
B000053VAF|4.0|A little precursor. . . <br />I saw this movie at the local \\"art film\\" theatre a week earlier than the major release in amungst 50 protestors pickiting the theater. . . <br />This movie tackles some pretty intense subject matter. . . Organized religion.  It says that the idea of goodness and kindness in religion is what is right and that the organizations oftentimes forget this concept.  It is not \\"against\\" any religion.  I was raised in a Catholic community, though not Catholic, I saw what the movie talked about around me every day.  Everybody saying that they were right and everybody else was wrong.  Kevin Smith hits a chord by saying that everyone is wrong because they are man and not perfect, and that they should focus on the \\"idea\\" of right as opposed to telling others they are wrong. He also says that the organization can put a lot of negative spin on concepts that were never meant to have negativity in them.  <br />The movie is good.  The cast is strong.  The message is wonderful.  Kevin Smith makes a racey, witty, and amazingly funny movie that touches on serious subjects.  Alan Rickman was hilarious as \\"The Metitron,\\" Jason Lee, Ben Affleck, and Matt Damon were all strong in their parts.  The extras on the DVD were impressive, lots of cut scenes (the original cut of this film ran almost 4 hours). . .

B00006BTCA|5.0|'Turn on the Bright Lights' is a modern masterpiece. Reminiscient of Joy Division, Chameleons UK and a bit of Breathless for good measure, Interpol is the first band in the neo-Brit Pop genre to actually stun me. The lush guitars and unique vocals, along with interesting change-ups, such as the song 'New,' that has a certain lightness in the beginning and switches into a quite eerie dirge, really got my attention. Fans of Gothic music take note: You will get into this album as well. It has a certain balance of darkness and light that we all appreciate. This album deserves to be in high rotation. Buy it!
0395645662|5.0|Personally, ever since reading this book in 4th grade I have loved it. it shows true emotion, speaks of struggles that are understandable, and provokes thought. This book is amazing in that there is no way you can read this and not take something out of it. I have read it at least 5 times and am still wanting to read it over and over. this book teaches me so much about life, and the value of what we have. it made me happy to know that i live in a \\"functional\\" (compared to disfunctional.. the way they live) community! i would definitely reccomend this book to any age, any gender, any time! this is my all-time favorite book!!!
B000065U6O|2.0|I was forced to watch this movie in my Film Communications Class.  I gave it a 2 star rating because I stayed awake for over 10 minutes.  I think you get the Idea of how I like it.  But if you have a lot of time to waste and you want to watch a very very boring movie then I would still suggest that you watch a different movie.
0385335482|5.0|Normally I prefer more serious and profound works of literature but a friend had this book and sugested I read it.  I politely accepted it with the thought that it would just end up collecting dust on my book shelf.  However I found I myself one Sunday morning with nothing to read and decided I would just read a few pages.  I didn't stop until I was finished.  It was a joy to read, fun, and crazy, yet you understand completely what Becky Bloomwood is feeling.  Bravo Sophie Kinsella!
B00006690G|5.0|Eminem's \\"The Eminem Show\\" is a step away from everything else he has ever created; stepping away from his old, songs about killing everyone he knows. He now writes about things that are or were important in his love and show compasion for his daughter, Halie. This is a very good CD, I would consider it his best CD yet. His cursing went also went extremely down, as he stopped talking about death and drugs, and hating his mom, to everything in life, and mkaing the contrversial apology to his mom. He has some really good bass lines that will get your head moving and your feet stomping within some meaningful songs.
B000002JSP|3.0|Along with The Eagles, Led Zeppelin was the band that most personified the 1970s.  Like their California counterparts, their career spanned the decade almost perfectly and each recorded their final album in 1979 as disco was is its death throes and the new wave was just starting to crest onto rock radio.  All that said, it would have been interesting if not for John Bonham's untimely demise to see if Zeppelin could have adjusted its sound and avoided dinosuar status.  \\"In Through the Out Door\\" suggests that it might have just been possible.<br />The album has all the earmarks of a band in transistion.  There are sonic experiments here that Zep had never tried before, most particularly on the catchy almost new wavish \\"Fool in the Rain.\\"  The synthesizer content is upped noticably, most particularly on the lovely ballad \\"All My Love\\" and the overlong rocker \\"Carousemlambra.\\"  Only the leadoff track, \\"In the Evening\\" sounds like the old Zeppelin, indicating that Page, Plant and company had no intention of getting stuck and dying in the tarpits.  At any rate, we will never know if they could have pulled off their reinvention.<br />Overall, an uneven transistion album with some soaring high points.
6304639457|5.0|I've been more of a Steppenwolf rock fan for decades, but<br />I bought both the video and CD of this classic reunion concert<br />by Fleetwood Mac.<br />As other reviewers have noted, it is a very tight concert, well-edited, and each of the band members,and the audience really enjoy it.<br />The addition of the USC marching band for the big finish was a stroke of genius.  I'd like to hear more of that kind of collaboration.  Wish I'd been there in person to see the USC band march in and blow the roof off the place.  It also seemed to give the aging Fleetwood Mac cast a final burst of energy to go out with a big bang!<br />During a recent cold and windy night in my home in Barrow, Alaska, I pulled out the video and played it from start to finish, delaying my bed time by over an hour.<br />\\"You just wanted to see Stevie Nicks,\\" my wife said with a laugh.<br />I told her I was thoroughly enjoying the whole package.  She is not a big rock fan, but she sat down and enjoyed the last couple of songs with me.<br />Each of the Mac-Five put all they had into this concert.  We hear a lot about the interaction between Stevie and Lindsey on stage, but hey, how about the spontaneous surge between Mick Fleetwood on drums and Lindsey Buckingham on guitar and vocals!<br />My only concern was for the backup musicians and vocalists.  We'd see very brief glimpses of them in the edited video, but we can hear them working hard and adding a lot to the rich fabric of the music.  I think it would have been nice to include a segment or two where the Fleetwood Mac folks finish a song with a turn-around and a tribute to the backup crew.<br />But overall, this is a super, super concert.  Get it, enjoy it, and watch it over and over!<br />Earl
B000002J1U|3.0|Sandwiched between the blazing fire of Led Zeppelin's first two albums and the massive success of &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; and the fourth album, &quot;Led Zeppelin III&quot; often gets overlooked in the band's catalog.  That's not surprsing, since III is a transition album in which the songwriting is for the most part not up to what came either before or after it.<br />The first half sounds very similar to the first two albums, only not as catchy.  &quot;Immigrant Song&quot; was a decent single, but the rest pale in comparison to anything the band had recorded previously.  On the second half, however, things get interesting.  &quot;Gallow's Pole,&quot; &quot;&quot;Tangerine&quot; and &quot;That's the Way&quot; are dominated by accoustic guitars and show Zeppelin broadening their sonic attack.  This approach would come to fruition on the next album's  most meorable cuts, including &quot;Stairway&quot; and &quot;The Battle of Evermore.&quot;  At the end of the album comes the cover tune &quot;Hats Off to Roy Harper,&quot; which acknowledges once and for all the debt Zeppelin owed to American roots music.<br />Overall, a transistion album that will be of more interest to ardent Zep-heads than casual fans.
B000002UAX|5.0|Instead of me, trying to be Mr. Journalist, and saying what everyone else here has said already, I'm gonna say buy this album, and that this is the best album ever. Those who don't own it, or those who dislike it are very deprived. Most of my songs are based off of songs from this record (among a few others), and it takes artists around 15 records to do what The Beatles did on the White Album. Without this album, the world of music would be a very dull one indeed. <BR><br />How come NO ONE ever mentions &quot;Long Long Long?&quot; True it comes after the bombast of &quot;Helter Skelter,&quot; but it's a haunting ballad by George Harrison and easily one of his best songs ever.
0380018179|5.0|This book is my favorite novel.  I watched the outstanding miniseries originally, fell in love with it, and had to purchase the book.  The miniseries doesn't even come close to capturing the magnificence of this book.  How could it?  There is no way to capture the journey the Cleary family undertook or the life they lived in any other media except literature.  The book tells the tale of the Clearly family, particularly the women, and, especially, Meggie.<br />There is one thing that puzzles me, though.  Meggie Clearly grew up on a farm and didn't understand reproduction, how babies are made -- isn't that a little far fetched?  Reproduction is very important on farms.
B000069AUI|5.0|I have both Parachutes and this album.  Instantly loved it.  They are kind of like a more melancholy Matchbox20.  There is some similarity to the Doves, both of those groups have great music if your looking.  I have hear some complain that the lyrics are too simple, but ya know I like LOTS of different music, I like variation.  If I want wild abscure lyrics I will toss in one of my MANY PinkFloyd albums.  I cant tell you which song is my favorite, they are all really good.  Although I have a wide range of music interests, I do not buy albums if more that 1 or 2 songs tops are less than good.  Sooo... happy listening...
B00005JKGI|5.0|IF YOU WHERE BORN IN ENGLAND ABOUT NINE YEARS BEFORE THE FILM WAS MADE YOU MOST LIKLEY GOT TO SEE IT FOR THE FIRST TIME THE WAY I DID .

B000068TPN|5.0|The action is good. Mel Gibson is great in war films(just watch \\"The Patriot\\" to see what I mean). The film has lots of graphic violence, so I would not show it to kids. Then again, you can't show any Vietnam movies to kids. It is a good one, but it's no \\"Platoon\\". Good for war film collections.
B00005JKL8|1.0|Why Gene Hackman ever signed onto this horrible film is puzzling.  I really enjoyed Hackman in BAT 21, but Behind Enemy Lines is too bad for even him to save.  Simply, this film lacks any feeling of realism - More true-to-life aircraft combat sequences can be found in today's video games.<br />It may be better than \\"In the Army Now\\" with Pauly Shore, but at least that was meant to be a war-comedy.  This one just falls so [heavy] on its face that one can't help laughing at it.
B000059TPI|5.0|This film is a treat for thre entire family and is so funny and entertaining. Jimmy Stewart gives a wonderful peromance in this film, &quot;Harvey,&quot; about a guy and his over 6 foot tall rabbit friend.
B00006L85B|4.0|First of all, good compilation.  I am not able to detract very much from this production for the sheer power of the chosen play list, the bonus track, \\"Hasta Que Vuelvas,\\" and of course the DVD.  The list of videos is too short, but everyone will be glad to have had them included in this issue.  We expect, as is certainly the case with any \\"Best of\\" compilation, that this will be a kind of leave taking from the ROMANCE portion of Luis Miguel's opus.  We, however, sincerely hope that it is not.  <br />The collection presented here is very good.  Of course, there is the problem of the previous and similar work, TODOS LOS ROMANCES, and the endless faraggo of questions it necessarily engenders to now have both it, and this particular collection, in circulation merely two years apart with only the exception of a few \\"new\\" songs. <br />This reviewer and ardent admirer of Luis Miguel's hopes against all that is contrary and cinical about the recording industry that MIS BOLEROS FAVORITOS was submitted for the further erudition of only his serious fans who also happen to be collectors of his music.  <br />However, WEA International and Warner Musica Latina's thinly veiled attempt to keep the ROMANCE franchise alive is very frustrating.  To be sure, from a purely commercial perspective, Luis Miguel, and all that has been produced from the ROMANCE series, has brought ENORMOUS wealth and longevity to the Latin division of the company; and one can only speculate what this artist and his beloved ROMANCE projects have done world-wide for the Latin Music genre on the whole.  But, that is all.  Once again, the almighty dollar rules over CREATIVITY and ART and INDIVIDUALISM.  The truly lamentable thing is that Luis Miguel is most assuredly bound by contract with this corporation, and has probably been suffocating under the weight and pressure of the money requirement, and the growing despondency at not being able to record all that he wishes. Indeed, in his much-anticipated press conference, which convened in Madrid before the release, he openly alludes to the fact that this was wholly a \\"company decision\\"--leading us to believe that this compilation was neither his idea, nor his desire at this time.  Nonetheless, either you are for your ART, or for your MONEY; and these two masters demand it ALL from an artist.  You will serve one and hate the other, but you CANNOT serve them BOTH--not effectually, nor convincingly.<br />What makes any fan of Luis Miguel's the infinite ... in all of this is that he or she will never know to what degree, nor just how intimately important Luis Miguel's work is to him personally.  Notice that from any of the recordings dating from 1988, none of the releases contain liner notes: the sacred space within the album jacket that is permitted an artist, where he can dedicate his work, thank all those around him, offer some of his personal thoughts; and in general, make the purchaser (the most IMPORTANT PERSON in the equation of \\"Artist + Admirer\\") feel that the work and final product was a journey embarked upon solely for the purchaser's pleasure and continued admiration.  One always feels what an unfathomable abyss it is not to see one single, solitary word Luis Miguel feels, says, or thinks about his current work when one buys one of his CD's.  He has never communicated that.  We are never invited to peer into what a journey of evolution and discovery making an album is for him.  No.  Instead, we are left to wonder how much does he really respect his audience, how much of that shyness of his is really an escape from his adoring public (manufactured by him or the corporation that handles his material), and whether or not taking a simple fan's patronage of his music and industry into account is a concept that ever enters his own mind.  He pays much lip service to that, but never issues his fans a Valentine to go with it.    <br />We are, in this plastic and throw-away world, continually looking for a glimpse of the SINCERE, of the GENUINE, of PROPRIETY, and certainly, a look into an artist's true GRACIOUSNESS and, most of all, GRATITUDE toward his audience.  For whatever reason we are left to ponder about our beloved Luis Miguel, we take what little we are given about this artist, extrapolate, that, beneath those elegant and highly polished veneers of his, there truly exists an immense talent who is a veritable GENTLEMAN, and that somehow, a bit of his HUMANITY still exists.   <br />I raise my glass to Luis Miguel, if only for the immense scope of talent I have been so fortunate to witness, both from his live performances, and from every time any of his albums are delivering his indelible voice to the pleasure of heart.<br />Sir, may you continually gather success unto yourself as abundantly and as limitlessly as your fans love and admire you.  May you obtain, however fleeting, a tinge of happiness and the satisfaction of your self-respect.<br />And may you never forget the extent of your welcome into our lives, that you possess it only for the while when you have exalted us above your own existence and power, and have made us the joy or your art-making.
B00005UEAR|5.0|In today's music world, I'm sure many can agree that we have one too many sweaty teen-poppers, second-rate alternative bands, women-abusing rappers, and screaming wannabe-metal bands. In my musical travels, I've come across the perfect medicine. I've found music that supplies something for almost everyone. This is music that is soothing, yet heavy. This is music that is fast at times, and then slows down at others. This is music that forces you to think, and constantly gasp in awe and excitement. I give you Dream Theater.<br />This quintet has become an underground sensation in the past ten years for their unique style of progressive-meets-thrash-metal. This means that they write concept albums with unbelievably long songs, which are full of odd time signatures, hyper-melodic guitar, and rapid beat changes. Many argue that these guys are the best musicians in the world, composers of very complex and heavy-mental music. In asking people, through casual conversation, I was shocked to find that people just don't know who they are. Their newest album, Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence, was released in late January of this year. Let me just say that this is one of the greatest pieces of music I have ever heard. This is the remedy for those looking for something new and failing to find anything. I present a two-disc album for the true music enthusiast:<br />The first disc contains five songs, the average being about nine minutes long. Don't let that scare you, though. The first song, entitled \\"The Glass Prison,\\" is so entertaining that it feels only about 4 minutes long by the time it's over, although 14 minutes have passed. Mind-blowing? It's just the beginning. This song is the band's heaviest song to date. The song mingles crunchy guitar, heavy bass, and cool drumming in the heavy parts, and in the softer parts, synthesizers, pianos, and turntables provide some needed variety. There are also loads of showy guitar solos for the people that like that. The other songs on the first disc are \\"Blind Faith,\\" which is a ten-minute laid-back rocker, \\"Misunderstood,\\" a slightly softer, moodier, piece, \\"The Great Debate,\\" another 14-minute song definitely recommended for Tool fans, and the quiet closer \\"Disappear.\\" Throughout these songs, Dream Theater shows off their amazing talent in piano interludes, more solos, and the amazing vocal power of singer James LaBrie. <br />The real meat is on the second disc. It contains one song, the title track, \\"Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence,\\" which comes out at a whopping 42 minutes long! Fear not, because this song is divided into eight parts to provide easy access to your favorite movement. The song itself is quite a roller coaster, starting off with orchestral touches and turning into a metal song, quieting down into folk music, then picking up into metal again and ending with more orchestral touches. Fans of Metallica, Pantera, Tool, Pink Floyd, Rush, Yes, Alanis Morissette, Incubus, George Michael, and John Williams/Johann Sebastian Bach will all find something to enjoy here. It does not feel 42 minutes long. Trust me.<br />On to the bad: The real downside to the album is the lyrics. In some cases they could be improved a lot. There's no profanity, and some songs, like \\"The Great Debate,\\" which is about the stem cell research controversy, are well written, but others leave big gaps. Many lines are cliché and boring, others downright embarrassing. In addition, the keyboard arrangements sometimes end up sounding cheesy, like 80's-style. The guitar solos are very self-indulgent, and the songs suffer from \\"overplaying.\\" LaBrie's voice can also get annoying, especially when he struggles to hit the really high notes. Not to mention that this is metal, so if that isn't your cup of tea, you probably won't like it. Other than that, it's a gem. I give Six Degrees an 8 out of 10 on a scale of 1 to 10.
0679746048|2.0|I made the mistake of watching the movie first, and I have to say, though the movie took extreme liberties with the book, the movie was better.  I felt the book was dry and sparse, and at the end of the book, I really didn't care anymore about Susanna then I did in the beginning.  Susanna is not a very sympathetic character in the book
B000002KB8|5.0|This album is a classic. Bar none. Nothing else to it. Everyone who listens to metal should purchase this album at some point. It is much better than Paranoid. It started a revolution. Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, and The Doors laid the groundwork, but no one was this prepared to get down and get heavy.<br />&quot;Black Sabbath,&quot; the song, is such a cool track. Starting off with the patter of rain and the distant church bell, it gives a dark mood off, keeping the listener in suspense until the guitars crash in. Ozzy's vocal performance here is amazing. At the end, Geezer and Bill Ward pull off a little metal rhythm that remains buried in the listener's head for days. All the makings of a classic song. &quot;The Wizard&quot; is a blues-based rocker, with some of the Ozzman's harmonica and Tony Iommi's slide guitar featured. The medley in track 3 was a stupid idea, but I digress. &quot;Behind The Wall Of Sleep&quot; is a good song, and leads into the bass solo wonderfully. My favorite Sabbath song ever, &quot;N.I.B,&quot; is up next. Everyone has heard this song at one point, I mean, that riff is famous. And so catchy! The solos are great, too. &quot;Wicked World&quot; and the track 5 medley are pretty average, but not bad enough to bring the album down from its high 5. <br />Get this album. Stare at the creepy cover, then insert the disc into the player of your choice and enjoy the ride. It's 1970 all over again. Metal is born!
B00005V9QJ|4.0|I like this album alot, it's too bad it had to be recorded with an AUDIENCE! I like the crispness of her voice without a crowd behind cheering and hootin'....I usually don't mind LIVE, but somehow I would've liked this one without all the whistlin' and hootin' from a LIVE audience.
B00000K2SC|1.0|\\"People who think that The Matrix contains one single original idea should probably not try to read a Phil Dick novel. Their heads would explode.\\" - Marc Laidlaw<br />From Star Trek Borg to Sleeping Beauty, there is not a single original thought in this movie.  Most of it derives from concepts and theories portrayed in several Star Trek and Outer Limits episodes.  Yes, the special effects were good, but they would have been much better had they been illustrating an idea born, and not re-born.  The cheezy ending topped it off.  I really wish he would have taken the blue pill.
0316666343|3.0|\\"The Lovely Bones\\" was a well written book. I sailed through the pages almost at one sitting on a Saturday. It wouldn't be the way I'd like to spend another Saturday, as when the book ended, I was quite down. <br />Many of the described passages in \\"The Lovely Bones\\" should have been left out. The gruesome details of murder were not necessary to the story. I felt truly sickened many times in this book.<br />The author created an interpretation of Heaven from which the murdered 14 year old girl was looking down from that I enjoyed greatly. I liked the authors choice to make heaven something that you create for yourself. What a happy thought. The only one in the book, I think.<br />I was left with a feeling of unfinished business when the story ended. I would have loved for there to have been closure. The hype was huge for this book, I expected more.
B00006690G|5.0|This cd is really a must buy.It is a step up from \\"The Marshall Mathers LP\\".Em takes the ability to make words rhyme that just shoulndt and showcases them on this well put togother album.The highlights of this album would be \\"Sing for the Moment\\",\\"White America\\",\\"Till I Collapse\\",\\"Hailie's Song\\",\\"My Dads Gone Crazy\\",and \\"Soldier.\\"<br />I enjoy all of the songs and its constantly in my cd player.I do however sometimes skip \\"Drips\\",\\"Without Me\\",\\"Say Goodbye to Hollywood\\" and others.This cd though,as a whole is great.But one things really irks me...hey Eminem...get off Vanilla Ice...hes back and doing really good forhimself.Sure,we all poke fun at his past,but hes a talented musician,so realize em,he layed the path for guys like you.

0380789019|4.0|I've read a lot of sci-fi/fantasy and admit to being jaded. However, Gaiman's work in this book is beautifully written, suspenseful, and original. As with his style, there is humor and clever twists to the story of a man lost in an alternate London... seeking his fate among mystical vagabonds, mysterious magics... and a myriad of bizarre characters. (ok, I've used up my M's.)<br />I read this in 2 nights flat, and sighed when it was done. Recommend heartily. Only 4 stars because I thought the ending was a bit pat, or perhaps I was just annoyed that it ended at all.

B00000JMOJ|4.0|Ok, first off I'll say that I'm not a big Arnold fan, and the movie is campy and silly at times.  That said, the concept of a futuristic TV show that kills people off for entertainment of the masses is truly prophetic.  Think about all the enourmously popular 'reality' TV shows of today.  How long will it be before the decision is made to air shows that actually show people getting killed?  I'm not talking about news reports here, I'm talking about people being killed for purely entertainment purposes, perhaps with a bit of prize money dangled in front of them.  Are we really that far away from the modern-day equivalent of the Roman Colllesium?  And we all know what happened to Rome soon after their population lost all sense of decency and compassion.

Allison Pearson really captures the essence of the Professional Woman's environment perfectly in this novel. A bit over the top at time, but then it is fiction.<br />Happy reading!
B00005BJ2O|3.0|If you are like me, and want the soundtrack to the film 'Moulin Rouge,' be prepared to hand over some extra cash.  The only way to get the &quot;real&quot; soundtrack to Moulin Rouge is to buy both Moulin Rouge, and its complement cd, Moulin Rouge 2, to get the best songs of the soundtrack.<br />This cd seems to have been made for people who only ever heard of Moulin Rouge from hearing that its the cd &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; is on.  Instead of providing the wonderful performances from the film's stars, we're given souped-up studio versions of the songs, designed to trail Lady Marmalade up the charts, sometimes even sung by famous pop stars (such as David Bowie).  Okay, so most of the songs originally WERE sung by famous pop stars; nonetheless, these are not the original film versions that fans of the film want to hear.<br />Luckily, or perhaps designedly, the MR producers put out a second cd, which includes 'important stuff' like 'Spectacular, Spectacular,' 'Like a Virgin,' and 'The Show Must Go On,' that they forgot to put on the first CD.  I gave this CD 3 stars, one more than I was inclined to at first, because of the other important stuff they did put on it.  Ewan McGregor's 'Your Song' is a natural standout.  Others are the full versions of Fatboy Slim's 'Because We Can,' and Beck's 'Diamond Dogs,' and Rufus Wainwright's atmospheric 'Complainte de la Butte.'<br />If you are the reigning monarch of pop music fans, then this cd might sustain you in the long run.  Otherwise, save your pennies and buy Moulin Rouge 2.

1565115147|5.0|I am not a historian in part because of the non-causal way in which history is often taught.  This book presents a pretty cohesive story about how long-term human history was shaped by basic causes we all understand, like geography, topography, climate.  The climate and location made it better to grow stuff in the Middle East, so early people did it and it worked.  That led to farms and farm animals and civilization.  Pretty simple story.  He fills in the details pretty convincingly.  Things fit together.  He doesn't need some non-scientific excuse like \\"white people are smarter\\", which only serves to inflame people.  <br />It's not that this book is completely right in all it's explanations.  Occasional holes in logic appear, but nothing dramatic.  However, this book provides such a solid framework to allow the reader to think pretty hard and deep, if they don't already have preconceived notions about genetics as explanations.
B00006IUL7|1.0|You know a movie is boring when you check your watch, half expecting to be half an hour closer to the end of the movie, and it's really been five minutes.  The most enjoyable thing I could see was watching Al Pacino's forehead...you don't even need the DVD for this.  Watch him as he talks for long periods of time with wrinkles in his forehead that don't move one bit...watch his eyebrows raised from plastic surgery.  Truly amazing.  I was expecting much more than an A to B to C to D movie where you can see the ending coming from a mile away.  This was the guy that did Memento...hopefully, his next one will be better.
B00006HBUC|5.0|When I put this in, I had an open mind and was expecting a good laugh and a heck of a good movie, and I got what I expected.  Scooby-Doo was extremely funny, super-cool, and loaded with stuff that SD characters wouldn't say in the show, such as the slang for the F-word and Daphne says [butt] in here also: \\"Anybody messes with me, I'll just open a can of 2000-year-old Chinese whoop-[butt] on 'em!\\"  And I laughed for minutes after the part where Scooby and Shaggy had a fart-off, and Shaggy kept on farting, and just when Daphne appeared behind him and he ripped a huge fart.  Or when he was in the suit of armor and he farted in their and ingnited the candle behind him for a brief second.  All I can say is that this is absoulutely worth the 90 minuts, so take some time out of your day and just laugh out loud for once in how many years?
B0000667RO|4.0|I was browsing the music store when I stumbled upon this.  I've always been a Bryan Adams fan, but I only owned 'So Far, So Good'.  I saw this, saw that it had some of the same tracks...but other Bryan Adams songs that I've heard on the radio...I had to get it.  I wasn't disappointed.  I love the first track, 'Best of Me'!  Was glad to get 'Have You Ever Really Loved A Woman?' AND 'All For Love' without having to buy the movie soundtracks.  But where was 'I've Finally Found Someone'?  The only major drag.  Fell in love with 'Inside Out' and 'Cloud Number Nine'.  I had been wondering what had happened to Bryan Adams.  After listening to this album, I went to Zia's Record Exchange and bought all of the Bryan Adams albums that I could find - I didn't even know about 'On A Day Like Today', &amp; it's my favorite with '18 Till I Die' and 'Waking Up The Neighbors'.  Of course, I have the 'Spirit' soundtrack.  Can't wait for a new album by Bryan.
B00006JL1Z|5.0|This has to be one of the best compilations ever made!  The simple fact that Sara is on CD 1 says it all.

B000065V42|2.0|I had waited for quite some time for this film as well as Jungle 2 Jungle, Babes In Toyland, and White Fang to be released on DVD. I was only to be disapponted by Disney that it's awaited release was only available in the full-frame/pan and scan version. A benefit of owning a DVD player is the ability to own films widescreen and with extras (which these DVDs lack). If we are turning into a digital society... then make it worth our while. Disney's choice of the aspect ratio 1:33:1 release has cheated these films' directors in that the widescreen anamorphic format is how the director intended us to see it. Disney cheated us, the audience, as well leaving us with a full screen of plot rather than the wonderful vision of the films' crew. <BR>P.S. Hey Disney give us a reason to buy your DVD's

0440237688|1.0|My step daughter had to read this book for school.  How sad that we give medals to books that have no message other than that of a liberal perfect world. I found this book very depressing and not edifiying in any way.  My wife and I read the book and can't believe that there isnt't a more positive book that the schools can promote.  How sad.
B00000JZJ0|2.0|The picture quality is decent, the audio horrible.  It has this annoying hiss and when you put it in stereo the hiss just gets louder when the rest of the audio.  The story itself is boring and been done before.  I realize they were paying homeage to &quot;The Bride of Frankenstein&quot;, but this movie is an insult to that classic horror film.  Not only that, it is an insult to the first &quot;Re-Animator&quot; movie which is a modern classic.  Skip this stinker.
B00005OAIE|4.0|John Mayer hits the spot with his unique sound. He starts out with an energetic tune, and eventually captures you with his catchy rhythms and sweet guitar sound. He perfected his style in Atlantic City coffee houses. One thing I love about John's music is how he turns you mood into that of a mellow dreamer. As you surrender to his music you wonder about many things you probably never gave much thought to. This c.d. is written by John himself, and he takes you through his life's emotions. He really opens up the way best friends do. Each song represents a different element of him. John was inspired by Stevie Ray Von, and developed his own sound around this jazz/blue style. We can't be exactly like those we love, and John knows his original sound will capture the hearts of many.
B000002L9Y|4.0|Way back in 1987, this was one of the first CD's I ever bought.  I liked it a lot, but then FM's \\"Greatest Hits\\" came out a year later, and \\"Tango\\" was abruptly left to collect dust as I favored listening to the band's more popular output instead.  I recently \\"rediscovered\\" this disc and realize what a great album it is.  Every song is exceptional, perhaps the only dull point being Christine McVie's \\"Mystified\\", and even that one serves its purpose of being a nice ballad to slow down the pace for a bit.  The singles are all among Mac's best - Lindsey Buckingham's techno-tinged \\"Big Love\\" and stark \\"Family Man\\", McVie's urgent \\"Little Lies\\" and bouncy \\"Everywhere\\", and Stevie Nicks' percussive \\"Seven Wonders\\" (which actually wasn't written by any of the band members).  Elsewhere, you find Nicks' shoulda-been-a-single \\"Welcome To The Room...Sara\\" (who is this Sara chick she keeps talking about anyway?) and her acoustic \\"When I See You Again\\".  Buckingham's \\"Caroline\\" and \\"Tango In The Night\\" are likable but sound way too similar in their world-music approach, which is only punctuated by the fact that the two songs appear back-to-back on the album.  His \\"You And I, Part II\\" is an upbeat and fitting album closer, featuring his usual \\"piercing\\" guitar tone (this is one album that would really benefit from remastering - acoustic and high-pitched guitars really assault your senses when recorded properly!),  The only other song not mentioned is McVie's \\"Isn't It Midnight\\", another pseudo-hit similar in tone to \\"Little Lies\\", and arguably the album's most rocking track.  <br />Were it not for Buckingham's defection immediately following the release of this CD, I think the subsequent tour would've driven it to megaplatinum sales for the band once again.  As it stands, it's simply a great and often overlooked Fleetwood Mac album, in my honest opinion better than \\"Rumours\\" if only because these songs aren't beaten to death on the radio anymore!

1556154844|5.0|Considering the rapid-fire replacement/evolution of languages, versions, porgamming models, project management and design etc., it is good to see some of the most basic and direct things don't change.  <BR>Steve McConnell brings a wonderful, down-to-earth sensibility to a topic that is still not written about very often: software construction, aka building your code.  I have to believe it's because he got it right the first time.<BR>The tone is conversational, understandable and clear.  The examples are presented in multiple languages, showing some differences between each, the pros/cons of one over another without becoming preachy but while still providing an approach for either that meets the objectives of the topic.<BR>The beginner and the intermediate programmer need this book to get their coding skills up to speed quickly.  The experienced programmer needs it handy to loan to the latest newbie and to refine a few bad habits with these well-defined reasons to change them.  Project managers might want to look at large portions of this book if they want to try and understand why programmers become frustrated with their requirements, or lack thereof.  Managers who have never been coders themselves would read it to begin to understand just what their developers are doing, why they ask the questions that they do, what their biggest roadblocks can be and why we become frustrated with unbridled &amp; unchecked changes &amp; feature creeps.  It presents a good case for developing a flexible coding standard.<BR>These days we have so much information coming at us on related but unique topics and are constantly trying to absorb new things that it is comforting to know that plain, old common sense survives.  All in all, one of the best software books I have read, and that it is still in print and still of value cannot be overlooked.  Having some of the best practices laid out for you makes it easier to remember them. Code well.
B00005RY7X|5.0|A review of ANDREW W.K. and his 2002 album I Get Wet<br />Anyone who misses music that makes them feel good probably appreciates Andrew W.K. I first became educated on all things Andrew many months ago, on vacation and watching some stupid video show somewhere. Well, originally I had heard bits and pieces of the first single \\"Party Hard\\" on a lot of late-night radio, but I had never caught the whole song. I knew Andrew was going all over the country, but I had no idea who this man (or, band) was.<br />So thus began my education, seeing the \\"Party Hard\\" video coupled with an interview with Andrew himself. They were showing clips of what appeared to be an amazing live experience, energy and love and anger and overall, FUN. The video for the song is surreal, too. It's like heavy yet refined electronic-assisted 80's rock with more power. Quite odd.<br />The interview with Andrew described how he was a classically trained pianist (he was sitting at this tiny piano with his dingy clothes and banging out Barbara Streisand songs - he claims he loves her music) who wanted to get his music out there. He said something like he saw all these other people making music and thought, \\"I can do that\\". And he HAS.<br />A true musical powerhouse, the album rips through song after song of pure energy and near-perfect melodic catchiness. The only complaint I could really say I have about the album is that sometimes it's TOO much, I think if he further refines his sound for his next record, it's going to be something to reckon with. But Andrew's debut I Get Wet stands up as a nice piece of art from the viewpoint that it's pure.<BR>Songs about partying (most of them - \\"Party Til You Puke\\", the previously mentioned single \\"Party Hard\\") plus girls (\\"She Is Beautiful\\") and several killer singalongs (read: \\"I Love New York City\\" and the disc's title track) plus tons of great stuff in between. There are several songs that really do give me chills and I can feel my adrenaline flying. It's really weird. A rare feeling to get from mere music. I mean hey, the Beatles excite me. But not like THAT.<br />So it can be said that it's a fun, good-sounding album (the story is that Andrew perfected these songs, shopped them around in various bands and finally assembled a group of totally amazing musicians to help him achieve the vision of I Get Wet) that really does rock and is enjoyable to listen to. Campy at times, but never too goofy that it can't just be laughed off instead of turned off. Which is a good thing, I think.<br />The last thing I'll mention is the most recent thing I found out about Andrew W.K. You can read more about this at his website ...but for being just some strange longhaired guy, he knows more about life than most people I've met. He means \\"Party Hard\\" not like drinking, drugs, but always living your life to the fullest, having fun all the time. This is why I respect him and his message so much. If everyone could understand this simple idea, the world would be better. <BR>And what's more, the other thing you should know about this CD is that for the cover bloody-mouth shot, Andrew actually smashed his face with a cinderblock at the photo shoot for that grisly effect. It's an album cover you'll never forget. But a lot of the censors have had a problem with it and felt the need to cover it with a black sticker on the cover (seems stupid to me). But Andrew agrees with this decision! He went on record saying that if it offended even one person, he doesn't want that. <BR>Amazing. Brilliant.<br />So I'll leave you with that.
B00005OM4N|5.0|If anyone doesn't not listen to Britney Spears Music. Some thing must be wrong because this year she did a new album and the album was hot, sexy and great.The songs  on the album are so powerful.Some people say that Britney is just another teen singer  with no talent. Britney Spears, Nsync,Backstreetboys, Christina Aguilera, Destinys Child and Mandymoore were all pop singers that came out at the same time. And if you listen to all their music you will see that they are all different. And you will see that Britney has changed her style in music changed. But I love Slave 4 u and Overprotected and the rest, but listen to the sample of the songs on amazon.com and see for your self...
B000065U1N|1.0|Had our regrettable experience in Somalia never occurred, this movie would never have received the undeserved accolades it's gotten. Reviewer Robin Bell recommends reading the book to appreciate the movie. Absent that information the lack of plot, background, and character development leaves no more than a confusing melange of battle scenes, albeit presented sharply and with crystal clear sound.

B000002R48|4.0|People complaining that there are &quot;no 10+ minute songs&quot; or that the production is shoddy are not opening their eyes. This is a debut! How many bands can claim to have seemless songwriting skills, talent beyond their years and to produce an album full of great music on their debut? Not many, I tell you now.<br />OK, so it isn't flawless. I DON'T like Dominici's vocals as much as LaBries. I DON'T think the production is good. I DON'T think the songwriting is AS strong as on later albums. And there is the tendency for influences (especially Queensryche and Rush) to shine through, along with a fairly typical 80s sound (that I don't go for here; maybe since I just don't associate it with Dream Theater). But what can you expect? Dream Theater are not Gods, merely musicians. Listen to Images And Words or Metropolis-Part2 - do you really think any band can get it absolutely right first time around? It took Dream Theater a lot less time than most to perfect their sound and still keep it varying from album to album.<br />What's more (or at least what I really like about this album) as that is is argueably more tasteful than later offerings. It never goes overboard, and the only thing I don't particularly like about Dream Theater is when they do just that. That isn't to say that this isn't technical or progressive. The music is melodic, speedy, progressive, technical and emotional - all rolled into one. And sometimes (on more &quot;mature&quot; albums) Dream Theater lose some of those qualities in favour of others. I'm not slagging them because they are one of my favourite bands, but it has to be said.<br />To sum up, this isn't Dream Theater's best (that would be Images And Words), their most well produced (Metropolis-Part2: Scenes From A Memory) their heaviest (Awake) or their most accessible (Falling Into Infinity). It isn't flawless. But is also very far from being a collection completer. If you like Dream Theater then I just don't see where you can go wrong with this album.this album.
B000069CWE|4.0|.. This is possibly the most creative cd I own... This got me back into rap, ... Truly, if you are ready for a change, and have a broad music taste, this is a good one, I highly recommend it.
B000002INJ|4.0|Overall, I think the music here is good. Cheesy, yes, but good nonetheless. Wheels Of Fire and Kings Of Metal are straight ahead metal, Hail And Kill and Blood Of The Kings are both heavy yet melodic, Heart Of Steel and The Crown And The Ring (Lament Of The Kings) are both very moody, emotional quieter metal ballads while Sting Of The Bumblebee is the best bass solo since Cliff Burton's Pulling Teeth on Metallica's Kill Em All. It appears that Manowar have found a great sound - the aggressiveness of thrash metal (in some places at least) like Metallica and Anthrax with the melody of earlier heavy metal bands like Iron Maiden and Judas Priest. It isn't hard to see that Manowar had a big influence on a lot of power metal.<br />However, there are some obvious gripes. Firstly, there's Kingdom Come and Pleasure Slave. These two songs sound just like the so called \\"false metal\\" that Manowar criticise. Both these songs are boring, useless pieces of junk. And the Warrior's Prayer isn't even a song, it's just a filler track that takes up time and re-enforces the stupid image that this album gives.<br />Which brings me on to my second complaint. The lyrics are the worst I've ever heard. Only Limp Bizkit have worse lyrics - fortunately Manowar have decent music to go with them. But seriously, when Eric Adams sounds like he's almost in tears during as he screams \\"May your sword stay wet/Like a young girl in her prime\\" or when 20 people shout out \\"MANOWAR KILL!!\\". \\"We like it hard, we like fast, when we get on we're gonna kick your ass!\\". I could go on, but I might as well type out the whole lyric booklet. They truly are that bad. They almost (not quite thank God, but almost) ruin the album.<br />I also hate the whole \\"death to false metal\\" image. It's stupid. It's pretentious. It's arrogant. Both the lyrics and the image could almost be forgiven if Manowar weren't taking themselves so seriously. But they do, and it makes all the more laughable at best, unforgivable at worst. And with synths on this album the note which says \\"No synths just metal and might\\" or whatever makes it even more contradictory.<br />In conclusion, this is a good metal album, but it does have some dud tracks on it and the lyrics are plain ridiculous. If you like 80s metal and you like it hard then you can't go wrong with Manowar. Just don't say you weren't warned...nd with synths on this album the note which says \\"No synths just metal and might\\" or whatever makes it even more contradictory.<br />In conclusion, this is a good metal album, but it does have some dud tracks on it and the lyrics are plain ridiculous.

B000069CWE|1.0|I was a huge fan of LP until i heard this.  I was really excited about their new CD after I heard crawling and I heard Jon Davis was on the CD too.  I'm not a big fan of remixes, but they are usually better than this.  Like other people have said, this remix is full of hip-hop/rap ... that really gets on my nerves.  I mean, Hybrid Theory does have some hip-hop but it's all mixed in with real rock and makes a beautiful piece of music.  But I could not stand listening to any songs on this CD other than Crawling or Run Away.  I bought it yesterday and I already plan on returning it.  Some people might like this CD, some people might not, but to me, it's not worth the time and especially not the money.
630027120X|5.0|When I first saw this film on the big screen, I wanted to walk out based on the inhumane treatment of indiginous people.  I was admonished to stay and get my moneys worth and see what the film had to say.  I was glad I did.  It exposes the abuse of the indiginous people to the politics and religion of the time.  I have the vhs and sound track and am awaiting the dvd in wide screen because the scenery is magnificent.  This film has a message.  Politics, Religion, respect for indiginous culture, and teaching music, values, and the power struggle of the Europeans nations. This is a motion picture that opens a lot of dialog.  See it and remember our inhumanity to man.
B000002J1U|5.0|Now maybe I am getting sentimental, but this album holds a dear place in my heart.  'Thats The Way' and 'Tangerine', echo the kind of heartbreak that only true high school love can provide.<BR>'Immigrant Song' is a staple of stomping AOR rock. 'Since I Been Loving You' will forever remain a drawn out blues orgasm of a song. Granted, 'Hats off To Harper' is far from the best song ever written, but the outstanding quality of the other tracks warrant 5 stars. And folks, that is RARE.
6302453003|5.0|The story of the re-conquest of the Sudan by Lord Kitchner is done best by this release from 1939 starring Sir Ralph Richardson, John Clements, and C. Aubrey Smith. The issues of cowardice, valor(of a different sort), romance, adventure, and redemption are much needed today. The story, directing by Alexander Corda, and superb acting and highly credible disguise for Faversham, make this the very best of the several(?5) films of the novel. The 1978 version for television(Beau Bridges and Jane Seymour) is also worth watching, but the current 2002 version starring Heath Ledger is a very poor remake.<br />Most of us probably didn't study the historical basis for the story in high school. I suggest watching the DVD(available in stores) of Khartoum(Olivier as the Mahdi and Heston as General 'Chinese' Gordon) before viewing this movie, and also reading the abridged 'The River War' first published by Winston Churchill in 2 vols. in 1899(paperback available-I got mine through (a local store))-a fascinating historical account-Churchill served in the Hussars and writes vividly of the Dervish defeat in the battle of Omdurman, Sep. 2, 1898. The scenery in the current 2002 version now showing is spectacular,but that's it.  This is a movie with a strong message, viewable by the whole family without incessant vulgarity or needless 'bathroom-urinal-etc' scenes.  definitely a 'G' rating in my opinion.
B00004TH6O|5.0|I bought this CD without ever actually hearing any of the songs, based on word of mouth and reading a few reviews.  Being familiar with both Kyuss and the Screaming Trees, I figured QOTSA would be pretty good.  Rated R has quickly become one of my favorites, and I've listened to it nearly every day for the past couple of months.  <br />QOTSA actually defies categorization into a particular genre.  Much of the music is radio-friendly and a couple of songs could even be Pop/Top-40 hits.  But, there's an edge to it, of course (how could there not be, with Josh Homme on guitar?).  If you like newer alt-rock bands like the Strokes, Vines and Hives, and if you've heard and like Kyuss, then you'll enjoy QOTSA.<br />The CD's best tracks:  &quot;Autopilot&quot;: Dreamy, trippy with strong musicianship and a weeping guitar.  &quot;Better Living Through Chemistry&quot;: Love the tempo change in the middle--slow, laid back becomes frenetic in a hurry.  &quot;In The Fade&quot;: Deep, raspy lead vocal by former Screaming Tree Lanegan.<br />The CD's very good tracks: &quot;Lost Art of Keeping A Secret&quot;: Probably the first track that will catch your ear on the initial listens.  &quot;Monsters in the Parasol&quot;: Goofy, but a strong, driving beat makes this a powerful rock song.  &quot;Leg of Lamb&quot;: Unorthodox time signature and a sudden ending make this song unique.<br />Throwaway/Skip tracks:  &quot;Tension Head&quot;: Just annoying, and hard to listen to.<br />If you haven't gotten into QOTSA, this is the album to acquire first.  Definitely the band's best work to date.
B0000009TJ|5.0|The world needs a Frank Zappa every now and then to shake things up.  There are at least 15-20 Zappa recordings that are essential.  This is one of them.  Yes, Frank has been known to be crude from time to time, and yes, he mercilessly takes aim at many icons and traditions in our society.  With that little caveat in mind, I highly recommend this live album.  Many of FZ's recordings have a wonderful sound to them.  They literally sound full, round, wide, fat-whatever you want to call a well-mixed record.  I know some-Lenny Kravitz for one-have championed analog recording techniques over digital, and since most of FZ's catalogue was recorded in analog fashion, perhaps that explains the sheer beauty of the *sound* of many of his albums.<br />This album is no exception.  This band could easily have held its own with his ROXY &amp; ELSEWHERE crew.  These guys are tight, tight, tight.  Although Frank's soapboxing can become tiring on some recordings, here it doesn't detract from the fun.  I won't bore you with details about specific songs, but those from ONE SIZE FITS ALL come across extremely well.  There are some goofy portions that are actually funny and don't make you cringe.  Kudos to the bass player on his wonderful work.  A newbie may not want to dish out the $ for a double disc set, but I think in this case it is worth it.  (Look, you're going to end up buying numerous three-disc sets like SHUT UP AND PLAY YER GUITAR anyway!).  A great album by a truly great band.  In fact, the title could not be more true-this band fell apart before anyone could hear them...<br />Recommended.
0151008116|5.0|This book is wonderful.  The story is engrossing, the descriptions and little side stories are amusing and interesting.  Everything about this book screams CLASSIC!  No matter what kind of books you like, you will like this book.  Nuff said!
B000002OVJ|5.0|Wowsa! Amazing that Led Zeppelin got so much of the 'heavy metal' press. The scorching opener from this famous 1970 recording \\"Heaven & Hell\\" is as heavy as anything I've heard from that era. Pete's guitar work is trancendent. RIP Mr. Entwistle, who is in TOP form on this recording. Roger and Keith also sound as good or better than they ever have. \\"Live At Leeds\\" tops many 'best-of' live recording lists and it is at the top of mine as well. I used to think \\"Exit: Stage Left\\" by Rush was the standard, but after hearing this and subsequently learning that Rush in fact did some overdubs on the aforementioned album, I came to the conclusion that \\"Live At Leeds\\" may NEVER be topped.  (Frank Zappa's ROXY & ELSEWHERE comes close). <br />But the draw of this album is not simply that it is a great live recording. The fact is, this is one of the best moments in rock HISTORY period. \\"Fortune Teller\\" ROCKS, \\"Amazing Journey/Sparks\\" from Tommy gets its best treatment here, and the fourteen minute bombast of \\"My Generation\\" -including one of Townshend's most amazing solos ever recorded- leaves the listener gasping for air. Not to be missed.<br />Essential.
1878424319|1.0|Where to begin? I was recommended this book by a friend. She is very sweet, but I know she has some rather curious ideas about a lot of things, and upon hearing the cheesy title of the book she talked so warmly about it was with great reluctance I made a mumbling promise to at least give it a try.<br />I was expecting 150 pages of simplistic New Age mumbo-jumbo, and simplistic New Age-mumbo jumbo is what I got. Chock-full of false dichotomies, logical contradictions and non sequiturs, this book of \\"ancient wisdom\\" provides recipes for anything from A Good Life  to World Peace . All you need to do is to follow the four principles of Miguel the Great and everything will somehow magically work out.<br />Whereas most of what Ruiz says is just silly, some of it really makes my blood boil. I particularly take offence at principle number two (\\"don't take anything personally\\"), which, if you read between the lines, in essence preaches extreme arrogance, turning a deaf ear towards all opinion and criticism, and the sacrifice of love for happiness. This is probably not the conscious intent of the author, but rather he just hasn't followed his lines of reasoning to their logical conclusions. At page 93 he says (freely translated - I read this book in Swedish): \\"We don't need to know or prove anything. [...] You don't need knowledge or grand philosophical schemes.\\" Well, as a salesman of snake oil of the worst kind, I'm sure you don't, Mr Ruiz, but the rest of us might be interested in at least thinking things through!<br />To be fair, some of his ideas are not all bad. But then they are not very useful either. How many times haven't we, for example, heard \\"always do your best\\" (principle number four)? I'm not sure doing everything in your might to adhere to that is any more realistic than slavishly following the advice of other truistic bumper sticker messages. And I'm not sure it will do you any more good either.<br />\\"If we compare [modern society] with the description of hell provided by world religions, we find that they are identical.\\" (p. 28.) While this sentence is a prime example of the bold assertions with no backing whatsoever that plagues many pages of this book, I think most people who are reading this review can agree that life isn't always rosy, and I know we would all like to know how to make it so. But if you really think you'll find it neatly summarized in four sentences on sale for $10.36, then gawd help you.
B00005NKKZ|5.0|A defining album in folk/rock history.  A defining American album.  BOTW is a wonderful journey.  This uber-talented duo have never sounded better, or written better than here.  The melacholy vibes just pour off of &quot;So Long, Frank Lloyd Wright&quot; and &quot;The Only Living Boy in New York&quot;.  Gorgeous songs that captivate the spirit and imagination.  Then throw in hoots like &quot;Baby Driver&quot; and the heartfelt &quot;Bye, Bye, Love&quot;.  This is an album that spoke many things for many people.  It spoke for a generation of Americans disturbed by economic distress and wars and rumours of wars in far away places.  A powerful snapshot of American history.<br />Essential.
B00004RF11|5.0|If you are looking for an entertaining and heartwarming story, this is the one for you.  It is great through out and the ending might remind you of a scene from Pink Floyd's &quot;Another Brick in the Wall&quot;.  You will find yourself watching this movie every time it comes on.
0553062182|3.0|Okay, I have only read part of the book. Yes, I think Americans place far too much emphasis on being outgoing and should take lessons from Oriental societies. But I just had to write this. I had found out not too long ago that a person's blood type is a likely indicator for their personality. Blood type O is known for being athletic, extroverted, and wanting to be the boss and type A are more noted for their sensitivity and being prone to anxiety. In the United States, over half are type O and about 35% are A types, whereas in Japan, over 40% are A type and only about 25% are type O. So I think that explains it partially. All you who have read the book and think it's you, you're probably A type, or in smaller numbers, type AB.
B00003CXXP|3.0|I thought that this was actually a pretty good movie but everything seemed so fake.  I mean, I am a virtual futuristic film expert and this film did no justice to the creativity and expertise of the graphic arts and technical directors.  Come on guys, what has happened to you all?  Final Fantasy was an animated film but it was more realistic than this.
0800135954|4.0|Family values, brotherly love, Legend of the Fall is an epic which depicts every side of both. <BR>Watching this film, it is easy to believe that Brad Pitt, Aidan Quinn and Henry Thomas are brothers and the sons of Anthony Hopkins. The love-hate relationship between Tristan, Alfred and Samuel is almost too realistic. The iron hand of a domineering father who only knows the army way leads to desparate struggles for independence and identity.<BR>Tristin (Brad Pitt) is the middle son, favored by the father (Anthony Hopkins) because of, as well as inspite of, his wild nature. Alfred(Aidan Quinn) is the eldest son. He feels he should be most privilaged, and since he can't get honor and respect from his father, he struggles his entire life to acheive success and out do his brother. Samuel is the youngest son who is looked after by all the family. It is Samuel who brings the woman into the picture.<BR>The struggles of life and death, love and hate weave their way in and out of the story.<BR>Edward Zwick did an excellent job of blending the story with the talents of the actors. <BR>Legend of the Fall is an emotional dramatic ride. The scenery of the remote wildernes is the perfect back drop to support the legend as it unfolds.<BR>I would recommend this film to anyone who wants a good emotional drama with all the twists and turns of real life.
B00006JL1Z|4.0|First of all, I'm a huge FM fan.  I have all the albums from 1975<BR>to 1997, the box set and the Greatest Hits (1988).  So, I bought<BR>this collection primarily for the remastering.  And it sounds great.<br />My problem is that several of the songs are radio edit versions.<BR>This seems to be the new standard for 'best of' albums.  Many<BR>recent releases (ex. Stones' Forty Licks) are using edited tracks<BR>so they can cram 20 songs on a disc.  Don't get me wrong: the<BR>more tracks the better.  But I think they could have removed ONE<BR>track from this bulky collection to allow the room for album<BR>versions of the other 4-5 classic songs.  For example, \\"Go Insane\\"<BR>is a Lindsey solo song.  Do we have to listen to a cut version <BR>of 'Rhiannon' so that it can be included?<br />Despite this issue, I think the song selection is great and very<BR>comprehensive (maybe a little too comprehensive).  There are<BR>several songs on here I don't care about but it's OK because<BR>every FM classic is included (again, some are shortened<BR>versions).<br />Last note:  I really would have liked \\"The Dance\\" version of<BR>'Silver Springs'.  I just think it's much more powerful.  But,<BR>I'm sure that the record company wants to continue to sell <BR>\\"The Dance\\", so the studio version is included here.  Ahhh, what<BR>the heck, buy \\"The Dance\\" on CD and DVD too!!!!!
B00006HBUA|3.0|Wow, I really thought I was going to loath this movie in every shape and form.  I really did not want to see this movie, but I was forced to watch it with my family.  But to my surprise, I found the movie &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; to be pretty entertaining and decent.  It's nothing I'm going to see again any time soon, but it is a lot better than I thought it was going to be.<br />The film version follows the cartoon pretty well.  Mystery Inc. is on the verge of breaking up forever until they are invited to a spookey theme park where the owner thinks there is something strange going on.  So it is up to them to uncover the mystery and find out why people who leave the park seem like mindless zombies.  As with the cartoons, there are tons of twist, surprises, and a logical explanation at the end.<br />What really made me like the movie was Matthew Lillard.  He was a true spitting image of Shaggy in every possible way; he even sounded like him!  And even the animated Scooby, which I thought would turn out really bad, was very comical and convincing.  The rest of the cast was all right, but it was really Matthe Lillard who made me appreciate the movie more.<br />The DVD is pretty cool.  Lots of special features, the picture looks great and the sound was also pretty impressive.  However, the menu is terrible!  It's very confusing to figure out which option or feature is highlighted at first.  One of the worst I have seen on a DVD in a long time.<br />All in all, &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; turned out to be an all right film.  I don't love it, but I don't hate it.  I guess it's somewhere in the middle.  Am I ever going to want to see it again.  Probably not.  But, I will say I enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I would.  If you're a fan of the cartoon show, chances are you will enjoy this movie.  It wasn't great, but then again, I didn't think it was bad.
B00006F7S4|5.0|Beck is an artist who is in the vein of David Bowie, a musical chameleon who is constantly shifting musical styles from album to album.  On his previous effort, Midnite Vultures, Beck assumed the roll of funkmeister with a sexy, r&b lathered affair.  He does a 180-degree turn for Sea Change as he turns into a heartbroken troubadour.  The album is the most personal and confessional work he has recorded as the focus is on the breakup of his long time relationship.  The music is acoustic based, but heavily orchestrated (the strings were arranged by Beck's father).  The opening track, \\"The Golden Age\\", is the album's best and a stunning work.  Beck's vocals are laconic, almost sleepy and the song has a powerful imagery.  \\"Sunday Sun\\" has a Beatlesque psychedelic vibe with droning sitars.  \\"Guess I'm Doing Fine\\" is a powerful lament and \\"Paper Tiger\\" has an epic quality.  The acoustic stylings of Sea Change aren't new to Beck as he has gone this route before on Mutations and One Foot In The Grave, but neither of those albums can come close to matching Sea Change's power and pure artistry.

B00006JL1Z|4.0|I know it's another repackaging of previous material - and just in time for the holidays.  Convenient, yes.  I swore to myself I wouldn't buy this b/c I have everything on the disk(s).  But I broke down 3 days after release and got it - if nothing else for the enhanced video of the making of their new album.  Ok - it was only 5 minutes long, but still......<br />But the sound quality IS incredible on the disk - and so far I've only listened to it on my computer speakers.  There is a great deal of difference from the original cd releases AND &quot;The Chain&quot; boxed set.<br />I can only imagine what the DVD audio of &quot;Rumours&quot; sounds like, but if it's anything like 'Silver Springs' remaster, it must be incredible.  ...and as someone said here earlier - when WILL they remaster the past albums so the sound isn't so muddled?  If they rereleased &quot;Tusk&quot; w/a remaster like this it would be perfect.  If they released it on DVD audio, I'd breakdown and buy a frickin' player!<br />My beef w/this set?  Two things:  One is single version remixes.  In my opinion, they are inferior to the album versions and dilute the original song (though i may not hold 'Think About Me' to that statement). But I loathe how 'Sisters of the Moon' just drops off on this mix!<br />The second issue is IF they're not going to have the original album versions on anyway - go for it all they way.  Somewhere there HAS got to be a version of 'Sisters of the Moon' w/the verse they dropped. I've heard Walter Egan sing it many times before &quot;Tusk&quot; was even recorded (ok, I'm dating myself). And supposedly 'Silver Springs' was edited even before it was dropped from the &quot;Rumours&quot; tracklist.  If so - where is the full version (though the one included here is better than my original '77 single or the boxed set version (or the horrible live version on &quot;The Dance&quot;).<br />Anyway - I still think the disk is worth it until remasters of all their past albums come out - and it's still better than their &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album.- and it's still better than their &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album.
B000003S0I|5.0|...and that's not to say that this is unemotional music, or that it's elitist (although some who prefer less thoughtful music might consider it to be just that).  When I read comments comparing this album to IN THE COURT OF THE CRIMSON KING, or other works from other KC eras, I'm compelled to remind listeners that they MUST consider the various incarnations of the band more than they consider each individual album - the personalities of these varying amalgamations (all captained by Robert Fripp, the band's eternal driving force) are each unique in their own way.<br />The personnel that make up the edition of King Crimson represented here are, for my tastes, the band at its finest, most creative and challenging.  Abandoning the more orchestrated sound favored on the first few KC albums - IN THE COURT OF THE CRIMSON KING, IN THE WAKE OF POSEIDON, ISLANDS and LIZARD - Fripp has pared his ensemble and sound down to a more minimalist approach, while still creating music that is filled with power, subtleties and imagination.<br />Fripp's guitar is one of the most recognizable instruments in progressive rock.  His complete control, his restrained yet incredibly powerful playing, his unique use of sustain, his amazing dexterity - all combine into a musical personality unlike any other.  As a directing force, it's been said that he's a hard taskmaster - but with the vision he possesses, and the creative forces at work within him (not to mention the unbelievable string of `results' in his career), I can't imagine him being much more of a `democratic' leader.  There's too much at stake here.  Listen to his playing on every single track - no one else sounds or plays like this.  I've been listening to him play for over 30 years, and he still makes my jaw drop.<br />The rhythm section here - what an inadequate term for the talents of these three individuals - is simply stunning.  John Wetton - a veteran of British rockers Family (with several fine recordings to their credit), adds his dexterity on bass as well as a voice that could never be mistaken for anyone else.  At times he sounds like he's reaching for the notes with all of his might - the timbre of his voice, and the emotion with which he sings, makes it a beautiful, expressive instrument.  Bill Bruford is one of rock's greatest drummers - his work with Yes prepared him well for the intricacies of King Crimson's music, a leap I believe that led him into a much more demanding sense of his art.  Jamie Muir - the consummate percussionist - left the band soon after this album was recorded, reportedly because he was unwilling to travel.  His mark on this album is indelible, and his influence on Bruford's subsequent work is easy to see.<br />David Cross, playing violin, viola and mellotron lends the band a sense of the orchestral arrangements that dominated the earlier recordings - but, again, in a more minimalist sense.  His playing can be both delicate and aggressive, as the arrangement requires.<br />This album is nothing short of a revelation - it shows that rock music can be both powerful and intelligent.  I was fortunate enough to hear this band (minus Muir, of course), in 1972, just before this album's US release.  I knew that Fripp had put a new band together - and, having been a KC fan for several years already, I was doubtful that anything I heard could top those early recordings.  The band lifted the audience off the ground and didn't replace them until after the final notes had died - it was one of those musical experiences that live in the heart of the listener for a lifetime.  I was so struck by the power and glory of this band that I managed to see them five times over the next year and a half.  The follow-up album by this grouping, STARLESS AND BIBLE BLACK, and, to a somewhat lesser extent, RED (as a trio, minis David Cross) and the live album USA (recorded before Cross left the band, but with his parts re-recorded in the studio because of sound problems), showed that thisalbum was not a fluke - this was something very, very special.  This album is an essential component of any serious listener's collection - it will change the way you listen to music.album was not a fluke - this was something very, very special.

B000021XS0|5.0|I own 4 DT albums(Images &amp; Words, Falling Into Infinity, this one, and 6DOIT) and after alot of listening, I've decided this one is my favorite.  They're all great, but this one is just amazing, and their crowning acheivement.  It is a concept album, based loosely on a movie called &quot;Dead Again&quot;.  I haven't seen the movie, but I've heard they're actually not that similar.  Anyways, this album is amazing.  I would recommend buying this or I&amp;W if you want to get into Dream Theater. <br />One thing you can tell right away is that these guys are serious musicians.  The music is very complex, but it's not &quot;music for musicians&quot;.  James LaBrie is also an amazing singer, in case you didn't know.  As a guitar player, John Petrucci has become on of my biggest influences.<br />Listening to this album from start to finish is quite an experience.  When &quot;The Spirit Carries On&quot; comes on, you'll just be amazed at the feeling of triumph it gives at the end of this long story.  The story cannot and should not be explained in  review, you should just buy this album for the music, then you'll figure out the story.  I'd have to say, my favorite songs are &quot;Fatal Tragedy&quot; with it's killer solos, &quot;Home&quot; the epic, with amazing muscianship as well, and &quot;The Spirit Carries On&quot;, a beautiful song, with a BEAUTIFUL solo from John and amazing singing by James.  Every song is great, that's why it's so cool to listen to it from start to finish.  Anyways, I'll stop talking now, but this album is really a great find, and I also highly recommend the DVD &quot;Live Scenes From New York&quot; if you liked this.
B000056Q81|5.0|To begin by comparison, I originally bought the french 60 Songs import and wished I had purchased this one first. Francoise's original versions of her early vogue singles (4 song eps released every three months during her prolific heyday) have a much more understated orchestration than some of the remixes. Also, this two cd set gets to the heart of what makes Francoise one of the most interesting pop icons of the 60s. Her voice, though soft, is often warm and plaintive with a tonal resonance that stands up to repeated listenings. The tunes (most of them penned exclusively by her on an acoustic guitar) have a simplicity that is refreshing, real, and perhaps more relevant to the current edgy guitar pop that we know today. True, for younger listeners, the occasional choir-like background vocals may be a bit sappy, but with Francoise so up front, you tend to forgive a lot of those bygone conventions. Almost every song resonates with the catchiness of good 60s pop tunes and clocks in at an average of 2 minutes per. Francoise runs the gamut of rockabilly, folk, motown, haunting ballads, and country all with an acute ear for her craft - mixing the traditional french vocal style with the newer milieu that came from these shores. Perhaps if she had written more in English (the UK embraced her translated versions), she'd have been as well known in the states, but there's no denying her talent when it comes to melody and its affect on the imagination.

B0000009SY|3.0|...to help finance his early 80s orchestra projects with RnR 3 record sets he did not really believe in? Unless it was to beat Warner Brothers at realeasing as many Zappa albums as possible within a year?... (Between '79 and '81, inclusively, FZ released himself 12 single LPs and 1 original single 45 RPM... You count 'em!) Or both?... Who knows what he really had in mind when he got around to releasing the second set (double album) of material as the follow-up to \\"Joe's Garage, Act I\\", back in '79. When we get to Acts II and III, what had started out on the first LP as a reasonably coherent premise now has turned into a hodgepodge that goes nowhere and everywhere, the backbone of which being seemingly his live, \\"xenochronized\\" (see other reviews here for explanation) guitar solos. Zappa could be, and was often, an extremely funny and scathing man, but he had no knack for story-telling... well not the kind of story-telling knack you need to fill 6 LP sides of a concept album anyway. When he runs out of steam for a development, then his Joe protagonist suddenly \\"dreams up an imaginary guitar solo\\" and... voila: another 8 minute \\"song\\" has seen the light of day! (...and straight from the producer's archives of live recorded material!)    There is some good music to be found in there. There is also some really bad music! Childish lavatory humour set-up to one of the most irritatingly hackneyed AOR chord progressions of all times (\\"Why Does it Hurt When I Pee?\\"), insincere, mechanical, boring blues-pop ditty (\\"Crew Slut\\") and, to top everything up, several minutes of a pointless, non-sensical party reggae freak-out sort of... just forget it!! (\\"A Little Green Rosetta\\", the closing track)    The \\"Sheik Yerbouti\\" double vinyl (from approx. the same era) was an aurally stimulating, wildly edited and generally funny mix-and-match collection of mostly very good material, and the band that performed it was involved, tight, spiritful and passionate. I don't really care for xenochrony: to me, it's like a fancy gimmick. I dislike \\"Joe's Garage\\"'s conceptual pretentiousness, almost complete lack of direction and, between every track, the boring interruptions by the Central Scrutinizer's voice (Zappa's), that force-fits everything from random live guitar solos to hitherto unreleased, irrelevant songs (some dating as far back as 1971) into the contrived storyline of this \\"rock opera\\".    If that's conceptual continuity, I don't believe in it. Music is (the) best!

The movie slowly builds from an espionage movie to the moment that Gant gets to the plane. From then the theme is switched to action and for a 1982 movie I think it looks very polished. Excellent job!

B000055Y0Y|5.0|I stumbled onto this movie years ago. I hadn't seen any commericials or trailers. It looked OK to me, so I rented it for the evening. It's about one of Kennedy's disillusioned former bodyguards, Frank Horrigan (Clint Eastwood), who's taunted by an unknown man (John Malkovich) who's planning to assassinate the president. The ensuing cat and mouse game between the two man makes for a very tense and interesting thriller.<br />What a pleasent surprise this movie was! Not just Clint Eastwood, as the aging Secret Service agent. Also John Malkovich (whom I didn't know until this movie) for his excellent portrayal of the psychotic terrorist. It's one of the better thrillers of the nineties!
B000050IE6|5.0|I FINALLY managed to get my hands on this album (for some reason it seems rather difficult for even underground retailers to get their hands on this disc). I have to say it was worth the wait. I've been a fan of Opeth for a long time now, and I've heard snippets of this disc before but never the whole thing. I can say that I'm a very happy individual now that I have this album. There are two things that are particularly outstanding on this album: 1) the concept, and 2) the greater emphasis on clean vocals.<br />I consider this album to be a great concept album since all the songs flow together to tell a story about two lovers separated, reunited and eventually, fatally separated once again. This isn't some kind of cheesy love-sonnet based theme, however. The emotion poured into the music is incredible, especially in the vocals by Mikael Akerfeldt. It holds mostly a morose, melancholic feel combined with violent anger at the circumstances that the subjects of the songs must deal with. A lot of bands tell a story with their music on particular albums, but this one especially stands out so much (as does Fear Factory's \\"Obsolete\\") regarding a great, thoroughly explored theme that it's necessary to consider this a concept disc. <br />The fact that there's a bit more of an emphasis on the clean vocals here is great. I think Akerfeldt's death vox are perhaps the best in the industry right now (just check out his side-project death/slash metal band 'Bloodbath' and you'll see what I'm talking about!), but his clean vocals stand out even more in the fact that they are honestly superb, easily better than even greats such as Vortex (Borknagar, Dimmu Borgir) and Vintersorg. They are so completely timeless and smooth one cannot help but simply wonder at their majestic qualities. Again, I love death metal vox as much as any hardcore fan of metal, but the clean vocals here are a force to be reckoned with in their beauty and perfection. <br />\\"Still Life\\" is a wonderful album highlighting some of the best aspects of Opeth's creative imagination, and any music fan should at least give this album a listen. Personally, \\"My Arms, Your Hearse\\" is still my favorite disc by these guys because it provides so much diversity, but \\"Still Life\\" is an awesome example of how to do a concept album and do it right.
0060930187|5.0|Sylvia Plath's semi-autobiographical story gives an outstanding insight into the mind of an insane woman.  The excellent imagery in this book makes you see, feel, taste her experience.  Book World described it perfectly when they say the book has &quot;no reassuring vacations when we can keep company with the sane and listen to their lectures&quot;.  Sometimes the scenes seem a little scattered with sudden jumps in time, but this is just another way she makes the reader see things how the main character experiences it.  An excellent read!

0226264017|5.0|There is no question that Milton Friedman is a brilliant man and an excellent writer.  This book is the best writing on ultra-conservative thought I have seen.  Anyone who is trying to develop a solid worldview should read this book closely.  I enjoyed this book much more than &quot;Free to Choose&quot;, which is more popular, as this book is more illuminating on the conservative philosophy as opposed to particular policies.<br />Another reviewer suggested that this book would give any left-leaning person a dramatic shift in their political ideology.  If such a thing happens, then I would suggest that person has to work on the depth of their knowledgebase.  However, reading this book is a good first step.

B00004Z459|5.0|Linkin Park's \\"Hybrid Theory\\" is a very successful CD. It has everything you are looking for from this band. It has hip hop, rock, and rap. Contrary to what people say about them having the same genre as Limp Bizkit and Papa Roach, I believe they have dissimilarity in music. Linkin Park displays their lyrics so that we can relate to their emotions, unlike Limp Bizkit and Papa Roach, who show their emotions through explicit language. It is good because Linkin Park decides to put their own personal meanings into each song, which we can relate to. It really helps with whatever emotion you have. Linkin Park has songs on this CD that will make you want to listen to them over and over again. Every track is good on this CD. I am giving this CD five stars out of five. This is one CD worth buying.
B00004ZAV3|4.0|There are three stereo tracks here that were never before in stereo. \\"Can't Buy Me Love,\\" \\"A Hard Day's Night,\\" and \\"Eight Days a Week.\\" That's cool. This is a great greatest hits album, but it's still missing some of the essentials \\"STrawberry Fields Forever,\\" \\"I am the Walrus,\\" \\"Michelle.\\" But those weren't number ones. \\"The Ballad of John and Yoko\\" is a cheap excuse for stereo, though. And \\"Let it Be\\" and \\"The long and winding road\\" both sound mono.

B000021XS0|5.0|My favorite album yet from a great band.  Heavy, dark and absolutely gripping from start to finish.  A must-have for anyone interested in progressive metal.
B00005QIPH|5.0|Like others I bought this CD because of \\"Last Nite\\", and at first I only listened and liked that one song on the CD.  I thought I had just wasted a good fifteen dollars.  But sitting in a car on a boring day can open a lot of doors.  I put in \\"Is This It\\" and told myself just to listen to the whole thing.  I liked about three or more songs.  Once I kept listening to it more songs started to grow on me.  Now I'm hooked.  I can listen to the whole CD and like every second of it. ...  I hope The Strokes last a long time.  And as long as they're putting out albums, I know they'll have at least one person buying them.  <br />Good Luck Strokes,<BR>Fan
B000002HK4|5.0|This was the first Dream Theater album I ever owned, and it very rapidly made me a devoted fan of Dream Theater and of progressive metal generally.\.  The title track is one of the best progressive metal songs ever, and is never boring for a moment despite it's great length.  The cover songs are also quite good, especially their rendition of &quot;Funeral for a Friend.&quot;
B00006JL1Z|5.0|Although the songs on this 2-CD set are available on other CD's, the sound quality on this set is SUPERIOR.  In addition, I think they did a great job of capturing a true &quot;greatest hits&quot; set with this one.  Yes, it's true that they have other &quot;greatest hits&quot; compilations - but, not with this sound quality - AND CERTAINLY NOT WITH THE ADDED MOVIE ABOUT THE MAKING OF THE NEW ALBUM.  In my opinion, the movie alone is worth the purchase price - and coupled with the great sound quality (you hear parts that you don't hear on previous releases), then really, it's definitely a must-have.<br />If you are a casual fan, then this set really does give you a great selection of their biggest hits.  If you are a huge fan, and are on pins and needles waiting for the release of the new album, then the movie on the first CD is worth every penny of the purchase price.  It's very well done, and quite long.<br />I think this one is a must-have in any record collection.
B000002JKA|5.0|A great album that is consistently excellent through virtually every song.  Songwriting and musicianship are outstanding.  Of special note are the heavy, intense &quot;Mirror&quot; and the very moving closer &quot;Space-Dye Vest.&quot;  Absolutely essential metal.
B00006J9OT|5.0|I've got to admit that most of the CD's I've bought lately put me to sleep.  Diana Krall~&quot;Live in Paris&quot; is thrilling!  I sang vocals in my jazz choir in high school and so I appreciate the upbeat vocals in this collection.  Every song is a hit or made to sound like Diana has made it her own.  Ella and Etta make room in the hall of fame.  My favorites are &quot;I've Got You Under My Skin&quot;, &quot;The Look of Love&quot;, and &quot;Just the Way You Are&quot;.  But, I really like the whole CD a lot.  Jazz in Paris lives.
B000002HPT|4.0|This was a bit of a dissapointment to me.  The first few times I listened to it, it just didn't grab me like &quot;Awake&quot; did.  Still, even so-so Dream Theater is better than 99% of what's out there, and after listening to it more I came to appreciate it.  If you like progressive metal, than by all means get it, and enjoy it on it's own merits.
B000009ROK|5.0|since Luis Miguel was 12 years old he has taken over the latin music world and has never let it go.  If you wish to know the true meaning of an artist and his craft just listen to Luis Miguel, this young man takes a song and makes it his own and you the listener will become entrapped in the web he weaves when he sings.  He can make you fall in love just by the sound of his voice, he makes you think that he is singing only to you.  If you are a true fan of music then you should have the complete works of Luis Miguel in your music collection!
B000002P7R|5.0|Two words.  Pali Gap.  You can buy the boxed set and find the song, and i think it's on voodoo soup.  I personally think this his most amazing song ever recorded, even though it's obvious that it was unfinished.  The sounds in the song are unbelievable, going in whichever direction you can fathom, yet there's method to the madness in the song.  The other songs are very good as well (although anything done by jimi I am personally very biased), but having Pali Gap on cd is worth buying the whole album.  As a guitar player it completely changed the way I thought I should play.
B00004WEJZ|1.0|I have just recently just started watching the Bond movies. Goldfinger, The Spy Who Loved Me, Moonraker, etc. This is supposed to be a remake of the Bond Classic Thunderball. I prefer Thunderball much more than this. I wanted this movie to end since the first scene. This was almost like an Austin Powers movie. I prefer the other Bond competition that year, Octopussy. Here's a list what's different from Thunderball...<br />THUNDERBALL Locations: 75% Nassau, 2% Bahamas, 3% France, & 20% of the South of England.<br />NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN Locations: 10% Nassau, 2% Bahamas, 3% MI6 Training Area, 15% Africa.<br />THUNDERBALL Villian: Age - 50 (Eyepatch)<br />NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN: Age - 35 (Both Eyes)<br />THUNDERBALL: ***1/2<br />NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN: BOMB (thank god this wasn't an official bond)
B00003CX9Q|4.0|Steven Spielberg and the folks behind this DVD release have finally seen the light.  Both editions (the 2002 and the original, \\"terrorist\\" line and all) will now be included on the 'cheap' versions of the DVD.  This is a great decision, and I think shows that our (the fans') response to the original plans were well-heeded by those in charge.  Never underestimate the power of the fan!  Some people in Hollywood DO still pay attention to us.
0312954468|5.0|I have to admit that after 150-200 pages, I couldn't force myself to read any more of this book. It was uninteresting and slow up to that point, and I gave up on it (something I almost never do).  However, after getting stuck on the plane without anything else to do, I picked it back up, and began reading again.  I'm glad that I did so, because the book was wonderfully entertaining after you get past the first 150-200 pages.  I found it interesting that the author based the book on some scrolls found about 20 years ago, and I can't help but wonder how many liberties the author took on history and translation of the scrolls ???  Excellent read!
B00006JL1Z|5.0|I'm very glad that I did buy this album.  Even though I currently own the majority of the albums, the 4-disc box set (&quot;The Chain; 25 Years...), the redux of that box set, the DVD-audio of &quot;Rumours&quot;, a couple of bootleg discs, etc, I find that this compiliation is an essential addition.<br />The improved sound quality of the CD in whole is an essential factor.  The remixed versions of some songs such as &quot;Rhiannon&quot;, &quot;Over My Head&quot;, etc gives the song a whole new meaning.  <br />The one key reason I had for purchasing the CD was the addition of &quot;Go Insane&quot; from The Dance video.  To really appreciate this song, you would have heard it originally from Lindsey Buckingham's 1984 album of same name.  However, the acoustic version live redefines the song from the electronic sound that it originally had in the early 80's.  <br />What else am I missing?  Oh yes, the enchanced features that you can view on your computer. The live footage videos of &quot;Rhiannon&quot;, &quot;The Chain&quot;, &quot;Go Your Own Way&quot;, etc are fun to watch, especially if you were not aruond at time to have seen the concert (ex: I was 2 years old during the Mirage tour).<br />All in all, you may be the proud owner of every Fleetwood Mac album, compiliation, etc.  However, you need to own &quot;The Very Best...&quot; in order to have a truely complete set.
B0000683DH|5.0|Director's Cut of this film is excellent. The sub-plot with Scotty's nephew made the film even more powerful.

A few months of reading modern, respectable editions (e.g., from Routledge/Arden, Cambridge, or Oxford) for any popular Shakespeare play will help a newcomer realize that for almost all Shakespeare plays determining what is 'the text' is a vast conundrum; nay: an oxymoron. As with many aspects of Shakespeare study, 'tis not so easy:  for most plays there are multiple alternative *original sources* - differing in important ways from each other.

B00005V3Z4|5.0|With so much garbage being made today, it is so amazing to see a film like this.  Donnie Darko makes you think, makes you wonder, and makes you believe that just about anything is possible.  The characters are complex, the story is intriguing and the acting is outstanding.  More films should strive to do what this one has done.  It forces you to think about life, death and what everything in between is really all about.
B000068TPN|3.0|This was a good movie, but a movie with Mel Gibson, about Vietnam, demands special attention. Two things constantly bothered me, one silly the other important. First, Mel's Southern accent just did not work and I had to stifle a chuckle each time he tried to sound like someone from my home town. Second, the constant close-quarter, almost hand-to-hand nature of the fighting shown in this picture, in broad daylight, is inconsistent with everything I have come to understand about Vietnam and modern warfare. Modern weapons are so lethal that soldiers rarely get close enough to even see who they have shot. The American troops were constantly running around and standing up in plain view of dozens of machine gun firing NVA. That is not consistent with survival instinct or military training. So I challenge the technical accuracy of the movie on this point...Movies like \\"Platoon\\" and \\"Apocalypse Now\\" express the dark side of that time, and there was plenty of it - - In total I'll take \\"Blackhawk Down\\" for shear intensity and the portrayal of the incredible professionalism of the US soldier. I'll take \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" for the acting and that incredible opening scene. And I'll take \\"Braveheart\\" anyday as far as Mel is concerned.
B00006F7S4|5.0|This is clearly Beck's strongest album. Every song displays his talent better than previous albums. Similar to Mutations and One Foot in the Grave becasue it's mellow and slow paced, however, in this album his lyrics make sense to the audience as much as they did to him. He was definitely blue when he wrote this one; I've read that he wrote ten of the songs after a breakup.<BR>Any true Beck fan will devour the contents of this disc. It has his distinct style mixed in with his sensible songwriting.<BR>definitely the best album Beck has produced so far(and I own them all).

0316666343|5.0|While reading The Lovely Bones, I found that I didn't want to put it down.  I read page after page with a growing feeling and understanding for each of the characters.  If you've ever thought about a type of afterlife outside the ordinary, you'll find this book to be striking and original.  I wasn't so much caught up in whether or not the actions of characters were age appropriate, as I was in the idea of what lies beyond and how those people who have already passed on keep in touch with all of us still here.  It's a beautiful thing to think about and I praise Alice Sebold for her work.  The Lovely Bones has feminist undertones, which I find refreshing and appropriate for the 1970s setting described by Sebold.
B00003CWL6|5.0|This Film is outstanding! There is something that anyone can appreciate in this film. It's hard to discuss this film without spoiling a lot of it, which is also what makes this film so great. Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) is a true American hero. He's not stunningly handsome, overly rich, or possessive of a will to make the world a better place. In fact, he seems to be the anti-thesis of the term. But his spirit is what has made him one of my personal fictional idols. After he realizes that his life is pointless, he ventures down the road of enlightenment. To him, this means blackmailing his company, lifting weights, fantasizing about his daughter's best friend, and smoking pot like he did in his better years. It is the outrageousness of his new hobbies that make this film so hilarious. It seems to be more of a drama, but you will definitely fall over at points. It seems that the point of the film is that freedom is not the successes of responsibility, but freedom of doing whatever it takes to be happy. To some, this may mean becoming a serial killer or a degenerate, but to Lester Burnham, it's all about listening to rock n roll, smoking pot, cruising his vintage Firebird, and causing domestic havoc with his family. It couldn't paint a more accurate picture of what American suburbia has become to many of its citizens.<BR>    The acting is superb, and it offers real humor along with a solid plot with a good moral. Watch it once and it will be only the first time of many.
B00006HAZG|5.0|My fears that this would be another Dickensian yawn turned out to be 100% wrong. After a few minutes of this glorious adaption, I was hooked. It has an all-star cast with Maggie Smith, Ian McCellan, Bob Hoskins, Trevor Eve and so on, and they are all so obviously having an absolute ball of time playing up the wonderful characters of the Dickens novel. Even if you know this novel backwards and are jaded with 19th century literature, watch this stunning, compelling version and be rejuvenated. The BBC made a number of marvellous adaptions of classic novels in the 1990s, including Pride and Prejudice, Middlemarch and Martin Chuzzlewitt (for the latter, it's hard to imagine a more riveting version of the novel being possible - it's so good), and this version of David Copperfield is up there too. A great way to experience Dickens.
B000065V1V|4.0|Hmmm, this album was extremely uninteresting when I first listened to it.  I got a few previews from some live television performances of a couple of the songs and that made me promptly buy it.<BR>But when I listened to it.  It bored me.  And collected a little bit of dust.  But I picked it up again, and then again, and again etc.  And the album really blows me away(I was very tempted to give it 5 stars).<BR>So yeah, it didn't catch me at first--but none of the greatest musical pieces ever do.  The stuff that grows on you is that which will last for years to come.  The only track that is very dreadful and does not belong here is the Neil Young cover('I've been waiting for you').  Maybe that song works for Tin Machine, and for Neil Young--but this song is pointless to be included here.  <BR>The biggest problem with HEATHEN is the track order--it's absolutely horrible and I think that's what threw me off so much to begin with.  Try this order, it makes much more sense:<BR>   11, 4, 3, 10, 2, 7, 9, 5, 8, 1, (omit track 6)<BR>That will make just a big a difference for you as it has for me.<BR>Let's go back to what DB has been doing since 1995.  OUTSIDE was such a brilliant abstraction, a new Bowie, an updated sound--alligned with the times and ahead of its time.  Followed by the 1997 EARTHLING, a good experimentation, furthering the modern Bowie sound.  Next the extremely disappointing HOURS(from 1999)--this album was pretty bad, none of these songs will make it in years to come and none of the songs really stick out.  <BR>With HOURS, he somewhat left behind the new sound he obtained just before, and ventured back to his roots.  The whole concept of David Bowie is to flow with the times and continue the &quot;Chameleon Charade&quot;--so to revert back complicates things and made for an awful album.  He was probably trying to regain some of the long time fans.  And the sound was just not a fresh one.<BR>HEATHEN will appeal to both old and young Bowie fans alike.  This isthe album of 2002.  It should be selling so much more than it is(not that it's doing poorly, but it should be way up there).  Hopefully you're not looking for a lot of guitars--they don't need to be here(who wants them anyway???).  Enjoy the lush synthetics, heavy strings, fusion bass, and pounding drums(tightly matched with machine rhythums also).  The production is pure and clean(though the lows are a little over powering--raise the treble and mids to fix that).  It's worth every penny, but give my track listing a try, it improves the album vastly.

Who is he?
0316666343|4.0|...The Lovely Bones is a great read!  I think it is different and fresh and doesn't conform to any contemporary model.  All the frailties that a lot of readers seem to be pointing out are all strengths.  Writers are like painters.  They are looking to innovate from current convention and make a name based on total originality.  Alice does this brilliantly, taking chances like literary bungee jumping.  Bravo!
B00005RFAI|4.0|Pink took us to a different level and musical journey with this cd. I know fans of her first cd might be a lil thrown off but they have to realize she is both rock and R+B but R+B just happened to be the first thing that she dropped. Even then it had rock influences in the music. Now she gives us Missunderstood that already has made more sucess than her first. The title is good becasue I think it explains how she mgiht be judged by fans and other people in her styel music. I liek soem rock and this cd dosent make it any different. Her first cd was 5 stars easy and this I would rate 4.5 stars but its still good. Now...whats good here? Missundastood, Dont let me get me, Jsut liek a pill(Tight rock and roll jam that shows a lot of soul even through this(Favorite)), Get the party started(The song says it all...tight beat (Another favorite)), 18 wheeler, misery, lonley Girl, and My vietnam. Overall pink came strong and showed another side of her talents with this one. People wanted her to stick with R+B but she cant grow doing the same thing. When she did R+B it had elements of rock and vice versa on this one......showing that both styles are really a part of her and not just one. Once people get that it will be easier to over look the rest but pay attention to the music. Still Missundastood?...Listen and find out.
B00005NB0H|5.0|In February 1970, The Who played a concert at Leeds University in England. This live album is the product of that concert. I don't have the newly remastered edition,(I have the one rereleased in '95) but all I can say is that The Who's performance is absolutely stunning. The version of &quot;I Can't Explain&quot; (their first single) is loud, ferocious, powerful, enthusiastic and awesomely energetic. Moon's fills are insane! Entwistle's bass playing is superb. Townshend's power chords are forceful and his solos are simple, melodic and amazing. Roger Daltrey's snarling is even better than his singing on the original release. Their version of the classic rock'n'roll song &quot;Summertime Blues&quot; is a highlight of the album, with John Entwistle supplying the amusing bass vocal at the breaks. (No dice son, you gotta work late.) And the almost fifteen minute &quot;My Generation&quot; jam is awesome, with breaks into &quot;Tommy&quot; choruses and a loud, energetic, beautiful Townshend solo. This is pure rock'n'roll, folks!

B0000024SN|4.0|Simon and Garfunkel contribute great songs and harmonies to this Sunds of Silence release.  The title track is oh so haunting.  The instrumental support is quite captivating in an understated way.  Anji is dynamic guitar workout and spunky rhythms of We've Got A Groovy Thing Going are surely pleasing to the ear.<br />Some people may settle on a compilation but Simon and Garfunkel bring too much to the table to bypass this release as well as several of their other original releases.
0790729628|3.0|I give this version of Blade Runner 3 stars because the elimination of the narration by Harrison Ford, as the \\"Ol' blade runner,\\" is to my mind a big mistake.  It is not that the narration is crucial to understanding the movie, but it gives the movie a Sam Spade quality; Mickey Spillane meets the the 22nd Century.  I very much like the deadpan delivery of the narration...very matter of fact.  The narration adds texture to the film that the director's cut sorely lacks.  I, in fact, am writing this following a search for the theatrical release on DVD.  Though the video and sound are so much better on the DVD, I find myself watching an old video tape version because I want the lead character narration.  More IS sometimes better.  Give me more!
1573222038|5.0|Sarah Waters' third novel begins simply enough. Sue Trinder is a teenage orphan who lives amongst a group of confidence men, thieves, baby farmers and fingersmiths (a 19th-century term for a pickpockets). An unscrupulous man commonly and ironically known as Gentleman compels Sue to join in his plot to win the heart of an elderly bookish man's niece named Maud. Maud is heiress to a fortune, but she can only claim it if she marries. The plan is: win the lady, ditch the wife in an insane asylum and split the fortune. Sue becomes Maud's maid and when the plot is reaching its timely conclusion is the exact point where it is fractured and split like a forest path into numerous twisting paths revealing long held secrets and hidden strife. Sue and Maud are made to endure separate trials in their journey including the incarceration in a mad house, the subjection of reading and transcribing appalling pornography to a perverted old man and a dangerous journey through treacherous London in search of a friend in order for them to discover what their true pasts consist of and what predestined traits may tweak their futures.<br />It is fitting that at the beginning of this novel a reference is made to Dickens' Oliver Twist. Fingersmith is a novel descended from Dickens voluminous library as well as much 19th century sensualist fiction. Waters skilled use of language to evoke characters and a sense of place through physical detail and psychological mapping of experience is a distinct characteristic of this descent. She also has a tremendous ability to use fabulous names such as (Mrs Sucksby and Miss Bacon) as Dickens did to mark poignant traits of her characters. Where Waters veers from Dickens is in her conjuring of robust female characters who can dominate the novel, not through the circumstances of their plight and their representation of certain social injustice, but through the powerful voice they use to assert their individual positions. Of course the great descriptions and plotting Waters uses to conjure this tale of a 19th century English plot to capture a family fortune makes a great many statements about the ways in which women were marginalised and the bizarre social positions they were forced to inhabit. However, the great strength of her brilliant protagonists Sue and Maud is in the way their actions are guided more by their impulsive desire to survive rather than to spur the trim, thrilling plot or subscribe to any societal roles presented to them. Their struggles led by these natures produces a longing for a happy resolution built not out of sentimentally contrived conventions, but a deserved reward for revealing to us their faulty human natures.<br />Sue and Maud are not angels. They both deceive and betray each other, but they discover in this Darwinian world a rare affection for each other and a chance to share confidence when one's closest family is apt to betray you. The curious mirroring effect Waters uses with them, mixing pasts and characteristics of them, is descended from a more recent literary genius, Angela Carter. There are elements of her ideas (particularly realised in her novel Wise Children) on the way identity can be splintered, performed and reimagined which correspond to the ways Susan and Maud's fates are intertwined. Their relationship is drawn out as a struggle to express their mutual love and define their suppressed lesbian desires. But this is also presented as an arduous task to realise the aspects which make them powerful individuals. This novel makes the remote past enticingly familiar and relates a harrowing story that makes you wish it to continue on and on.lotting Waters uses to conjure this tale of a 19th century English plot to capture a family fortune makes a great many statements about the ways in which women were marginalised and the bizarre social positions they were forced to inhabit.

B000002UVX|5.0|I have close to all of Jimi Hendrix's albums and this is my favorite. I have the original one not the new remastered one so I cannot compare them. The opening track Who Knows is my favorite Hendrix song and the close to ten minute version here is worth the price of the entire CD. Jimi goes out there and doesn't come back until the end of the show. I had a friend that didn't like Jimi (yes, these people do exist) but I converted him with this album. This album is 7 stars out of 5.<br />I would also reccomend the Live at The Filmore East album with this one.
B0000024W3|1.0|I'm a huge Dylan fan and have been for many years, but I've gotta say that this is the worst album he's ever released. Full of weak performances and displaying a shocking lack of originality, what could have been an okay followup to Nashville Skyline was turned into unlistenable dreck with the presence of overdubbed strings, horns, and backup singers. Some of the album was made up of live performances from the Isle of Wight in 1969 (and I believe the main reason for this album's existence was the failure to come up with a decent complete live album from the Isle of Wight, as originally planned), and those are the best moments on this album. Other songs were recorded in Nashville with Bob's Nashville Skyline crooning voice (but sabotaged by overdubs), and still more songs were recorded in New York City with &quot;folkier&quot; musicians. The New York performances are not too bad, but would have been better with a few more rehearsals. Just overall a very inconsequential album and a big disappointment at the time of its release. In spite of all the revisionism, this album still disappoints.
B0000024UX|5.0|An enduring classic indeed.  These songs are all gems.  The title track stands out not only because of its poignant lyrics but mainly due to the beautiful arrangement and instrumentation.  Art Garfunkel's crowning moment as a singer.<br />And oh what other great tunes.  The Only Living Boy In New York is an underatted gem. Just love the tone between the vocals and the instrumental support.  Cecilia, Baby Driver, Bye Bye Love, and meandering ballad The Boxer are all great songs to sing  along to.  Song For The Asking is pretty way to close this chock full of classics recording.<br />One of the few times, an recording group concluded with their best original work.  Paul Simon wnet on to record some excellent solo material but truthfully this recording may be his best one of them all.
B00005MAM2|5.0|The music is unbelievable. It might sound silly, but combined with the animation, it is unbelievable. The animation makes me question my senses. The story is so deep that you might drown in it. I'm willing to help if you can't on your own. But I insist that the manga version is superior to even this. It makes sense, the cowardly fanatic you see in the movie turns out to be a wise, valiant psychic and a number (19), Akira is alive, and it's basically far superior. It astonished me, though, that the movie has such a different yet similar plot, without significant plot holes or stupidity. <br />But making Akira dead actually was a good idea. Itmade him a sort of mysterious force that must be stopped. Of course, the manga Akira didn't talk much, so he was also mysterious and frightening.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|In 1991, Beauty and The Beast became one of the year's top grossing movies and a favorite among Critics and audiences, it's also the first animated movie to recieve a academy award nomminee for best picture making this movie into one of the greatest movies of all time.<br />The DVD: Stunning! has a excellent transfer with not a single grain in sight but the sound is terrific as well certified with THX digital sound, this first disc contains three versions of the film which includes the Special Edition with a never-before-shown Musical number, the original Theatrical edition and the Work-in-progress edition, second disc includes games, documentaries, Music Videos and more.<br />So if your a DVD lover, own this DVD cause it's one of the best movies of all time and best DVDs of all time.
B000002H70|5.0|I can't imagine a more perfect CD, truly. Robert Smith and the band hit on something here that is absolutely classis. It's creepy, dark, gothic, but shimmering and beautiful, like icicles the day after Christmas. <br />I listen to this CD at night when it's dark and it transports me to another world. <br />&quot;The Same Deep Water&quot; is 8 minutes of mind-blowing bliss. It's slow and repetetive and it makes you happy to be indoors when it's raining. <br />&quot;Pictures of You&quot; just brings me joy, with pictures of my loved one on the wall as I play it. Even on a sunny day, this one makes me happy. <br />Ummm, hmm, let me think, I also like &quot;Untitled,&quot; which closes the CD. It sounds like Weird Al playing along on the accordian at first, but then the drums come crashing in and Robert sings &quot;helplessly adrift by the eyes of ghosts again, pushing my face in the memory of you again, I'll never lose this dream, will for always love again&quot; in a way that is so longing, you want to just hold that feeling in you for the whole day!<br />My favorite and I'm not being generous giving it five stars.
B0000024TQ|3.0|Don't get me wrong. There are several strong songs on Bookends such as Mrs Robinson, Fakin' It, Hazy Shade of Winter, America, and At The Zoo. However, the tone does not vary too much. And the pace is oh so slow. Good for introspective moods indeed.<br />However, such number like Overs, Old Friends, and especially Voices of Old People are mostly good for skipping over. Dull, dull, dull this three song sequence. They are just too depressing for me. The Bookends theme is pleasant but its just way too short and to repeat it later in the record just takes up space.<br />In general this collection is Ok, not harmful or anything. However, I clearly prefer Bridge Over Troubled Water, Parsley, Sage, and Sounds of Silence to this bland batch.
B00006AL1G|5.0|I cannot say enough about this film.  It's a great documentary, and a fabulous look at the history and rise of the turntablists.  Definitely one for the collection.  If you love hip-hop or electronica, buy it!
6304602979|5.0|Man WHAT a movie. What a love story...what a beginning and what an ending. Fabulous laughs from Brad Pitt (Floyd...the interminable house guest), Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper (re; the trailer scene...as poignant as it is vengeful, and still achingly funny). Gary Oldman my man..what'cho'on man...gimme-sommmmme! Elliot...(Bronson Pinchot...\\"And to what is it pertaining\\"-Beverly Hills Cop. Remember?) You a weed boy...a very funny weed. We even have the ghost of Elvis...AND IT WORKS...WHAT! Loved it! loved it! loved it!
B000005ZGZ|5.0|\\"End Hits\\" is an amazing record, one that immediately moves the listener and only grows better with familiarity. Yeah, it's another Fugazi record, and it's not too much of a depature for the band, although it's often lumped together as one of the bands more \\"experimental\\" releases. If experimental means well structured, inovative songs then yes, this is experimental. But experimental has a negative connotation to it, implying that anything experimental is inaccessable. This is still a Fugazi album, and as such it really rocks.<br />They've perfected the stop-start sound with this album, allowing for every song to build to the point where the listener is dying with anticipation. The song is building, what comes next? A catchy chorus? A guitar lick? A guitar solo? A drum solo? A mellow refrain? An all out power chord? The result is next disappointing.<br />An interesting note: This album features a lot more of Guy Picciotto's vocals, which is a really welcome change. He's got a powerful, emotive voice with just a hint of glam in it that really makes these songs work. Ian Mackaye is still a presense, and the vocal duality that makes the band thrive still exists, but having Picciotto in more of a leadership position certainly makes this album unique. I love Fugazi, and this is probably my favorite release by them.<br />One final note that must be mentioned: [...] It's something worth considering, but no matter how you obtain a copy of End Hits, it's worth it.
B00005RFAI|5.0|Wow!<br />One word to sum up the cd that I have. The girl is back and ready for round 2 so hold on to your seatbeats because it's going to be a fun ride w/ Pink. I love Pink style for music and this cd is no different from her last. She is here to stay and she wants everyone to know who she is and what her name is. Pink rules! As simple as that enought said.
B00006DEFA|5.0|I won't go into any explanation of why Amadeus is a great movie; it is, and if you're looking into this new version you are probably already aware of it. What I do want to touch on is the new \\"Director's Cut\\":<br />First off, the transfer is excellent. Deep blacks. Not too much color in this film except when we are in the emperor's court, the opera stage and the robes of the archbishop, but in those more lit scenes the colors are vibrant. This is not going to be like Fifth Element as far as sharpness, but it pleases the eye. But then, the original Amadeus had a fine transfer as well.<br />As for the extra scenes: they fit into the whole seemlessly. These are not scenes that were cut because they didn't contribute to the story; rather these were cut due for reasons of duration and to avoid an R rating (really, there's only Constanza's breasts that threatened to put Amadeus over the edge--our rating system is stupid). The story is better than ever, and the quality of the footage is in no way inferior to the rest of the film. Seemless cut.<br />5.1: nice sound. Not too much use of the rear channels outside of soundtrack (enough reason there!) and applause during performances, but this is certainly a treat nonetheless. the LFE .1 channel got some good use. During Don Giovanni the heavy footfalls of Wolfi's Don/Father come booming to life.<br />The documentary is one hour, not 37 minutes as stated on the amazon description. It is excellent!!! Did you know that Meg Tilly was to play Constanza? No footage of her screentest but there is pics of her in costume. Beautiful. Milos talking about returning to his homeland after becoming declared persona non grata is worth watching.<br />The commentary: I wasn't able to get more than 20 minutes into it. A shame that Milos couldn't be accompanied by Zaentz or Hulce or the best would be F. Murray Abraham (fat chance on that one), or any minor character or any of the dogs or even the cat from the first scene...anyone would have been better than Schaeffer. All he could say was \\"That's Right\\" or simply repeat the last few words of whatever Milos said. What a bore. But as bad as that may be I'd still pay twice the cost for this cut. BRILLIANT BRILLIANT!!!<br />The trailor: great to see how such a great movie can have such a stupid trailor.<br />And then there's the awards. The usual.<br />All in all, this dvd is fantastic. Fully deserving of it's 8 awards. A shame that Hulce didn't get more recognition. many contend that he overplayed his part, but it's his presence that saves it from being a depressing epic. This film really has it all.<br />Oh, and lest I forget: the music. Mozart. 'Nuff said.better than Schaeffer.

B00006JL1Z|5.0|The word on the street is that Fleetwood Mac is about to release the most creative studio album of their storried career. They've accomplished this as \\"Buckingham Nicks\\" with one of the most sturdy rhythm section in the business. So this \\"Very Best of\\" collection is a nice piece of history showcasing the band's tunes with Christine McVie. Most die-hard fans like myself have always preferred the album cuts over the over-played radio hits. Most of the great ones are here, remastered like butter, with sound quality so supreme it makes you want to go out and buy better speakers. Turn the volume way up, close your windows, and play World Turning. What's better than that on a sunny October day?
B00005JKGV|5.0|*SPOILERS*the theme of this movie is male obsession and posessiveness - the saxaphonist controls his wife obsessively (what are you going to do? read? what are you going to read?) - she barely has any personality left -but when she morphs into the blond Patricia Arquette she plays what would have been in the 40's or 50's the typical noir black widow heroine ... who manipulates the mechanic - but Lynch turns the femme fatale icon (undoubtedly a male invention) around in an ironic, postmodern sense - here she is a figure who can't be controled by a male - when she tosses the car keys to the mechanic and says, \\"you drive,\\" she is stating, I'll give you the illusion of control, but I'm obviously really in control - Even more explicitly, she tells him, you can't have me - and that's when he morphs back into the saxaphonist - when he realizes he indeed can't control another human being - which he of course needed to realize in his original incarnation but didn't - also when Mr. eddy is done away with - mr. eddy is a projection of his rage and jealosy - his jealousy is done away with, expiated - but it's too late - he killed his wife - so that his screaming realization at the end is that he takes responsibility but it's too late - either that or he's still self-deluded but realizes he can't escape his fate (the cops closing in)- anyway, I think it really is about a man trying to come to terms with his lethal posessiveness - but too late - one possible interpretation of many, I realize...
B00006JL1Z|4.0|This two-disc compilation updates the groups' previous single disc GREATEST HITS with some terrific remastering(as well as multimedia tidbits) and some essential tracks not found on that set.  Particularly welcome are the addition of 'Seven Wonders', 'Silver Springs', and Christine McVie's sterling 'Love In Store'.  The sequencing of the tracks, however, leaves something to be desired, and the inclusion of some tracks(particularly Lindsey Buckingham's 'Go Insane','I'm So Afraid', and even 'Family Man')are a little head-scratching(though it's nice to see the DANCE rendition of 'Big Love' here). The set is further proof that FM produced some truly classic work--though there's no questioning Buckingham's and Nick's fine work here, the great Christine McVie's contributions('Hold Me','You Make Loving Fun','Everywhere')are particularly underrated. That  said, this is probably as close as you'll get to complete for one of pop's truly great bands.
B000003S0P|5.0|It had been years since I had last played \\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\", an early progressive rock album that didn't push the envelope of rock, it ripped through the side of the envelope.  I was recently reading several reviews by another Amazon reviewer, Star/Prog, and intrigued by his comments regarding various classic and modern progressive rock groups and albums.  He enjoyed quite a number of CDs that I liked and I decided perhaps I might enjoy some of his recommendations that I didn't own, so I tried \\"Red\\".  I think from now on I'll just use his recommendation list as a shopping list for anything I currently don't own.  \\"Red\\" is absolutely incredible.<br />The album starts with \\"Red\\", an instrumental that has elements similar to some of the elements on \\"In the Court of Crimson King\\".  The song kicks off with a series of guitar riffs, drums and bass, leading into exploitation of the musical theme.  While the lead guitar periodically uses the theme as a launch platform, it returns to the same theme once again to maintain the continuity of thread.  At nearly 3 minutes into the piece we get string bass taking the lead in the theme, and the lead guitar falls into the back ground.  The string bass provides an ominous feel, a sense of impending something...doom perhaps.  Then the lead guitar takes back over, repeating the original theme with variations.  The instrumental ends with a series of climbing riffs into a discord that make you start to feel like perhaps there is a positive ending, but the discord ending on a downbeat immediately changes the feeling of the end.  Excellent instrumental.<br />\\"Fallen Angel\\" implies a younger brother dying in a drug deal gone wrong (\\"Risk a life to make a dime\\").  The cornet is prominent until about halfway through the song, when the song segues into a bridge.  After the bridge the lyrics are repeated from the second verse, until the \\"Fallen angel\\" chorus when all the instruments play counterpoint to the fade out.  Very sad song.<br />\\"One More Red Nightmare\\" starts with heavy bass and drums, adding in mellotron, sounding ominous.  This song is actually hilarious.  The singer is on a plane when the plane starts dropping out of the sky.  However, the singer wakes to find that the whole flight was a dream, he's actually on a Greyhound bus.  The supporting music is about as whimsical as King Crimson gets on this album, which is to say, only modestly.  There is an extended bridge after the first two verses where there is a dream-like feel to the music, leading to the third verse where the singer finds that he is on the bus.  After that the music takes on a joyous/relieved feel, celebrating life.  The ending is abrupt and...<br />the beginning to \\"Providence\\" is as slow as \\"One More Red Nightmare\\" was abrupt.  Violin leading to small pieces of additional music, in and out.  Think \\"Moonchild\\", but done better.  This instrumental would make a good soundtrack for a horror film.  At about 5 minutes in the music begins to accelerate, and the instruments begin a serious counterpoint that seems improvisational, and perhaps is, leading to the string bass that finishes off the instrumental, not abruptly, but not in a fadeout either.<br />\\"Starless\\" finishes the CD with 12 minutes of song and instrumental.  The song kicks off with about 4 minutes of beautiful lyrics and music, that transitions into bass and lead guitar with drums and blocks, slow...building, building, building, almost forever, it seems, but at almost 8 minutes in the lead guitar starts into a fevered pitch, sustaining what came before, until at 8:40 or so you are on the runway, blasting off at just past 9 minutes.  The music moves and rocks, the saxophone providing the lead for a while...then mellowing back out, the calm before the raucous, rocking end.<br />The CD is ominous.  It is dark.  Do not listen to it when you are feeling down.  Mellow, okay.  Down, no.  One small thing: this music is addictive.  Once you listen to it, the diode photons may wear the plastic off...iode photons may wear the plastic off...
B000021YQV|5.0|just hearing 'chop suey' once was enough for me to buy this album.From the intro of the prison song to the melodic and haunting aerials, this album is a mindblowing experience.It sounds like nothing ever done before and system mixing their roots with the music makes it all the more unique.I rate this as the best album in my collection.Don't hesitate to buy it!
B0000025RI|5.0|I sense a legend in the making on this one, folks. If this young and talented kid can keep his head on straight, I predict big, big things for him. \\"Thriller\\" is a 9-song masterpiece - I only wish it were longer. This man Michael Jackson is without equal in the show business world, a living, breathing sensation! <br />Ever seen him dance? He does a \\"moon walk\\" number that's guaranteed to floor ya'!! And his singing? Forgetaboutit!! His vocal range and depth on each gleeful note will get you dancing yourself - although not nearly as great as Michael Jackson himself! <br />\\"Billy Jean\\" will enrapture you; \\"Thriller\\" (especially the video) will scare you; \\"Beat It\\" will make you groove on your living room floor; and \\"Human Nature\\" will catch you singing in the shower.<br />Trust me folks, if this guy doesn't turn to drugs, drink, women or any other hurtful vice, he's going to go far in the music world. As long as he stays down to earth, I think he'll be just fine.<br />A REAL SENSATION, THIS ONE!!
B0000640VO|5.0|Amelie is completely intriguing and very quirky from the first line.  I found myself sypathizing with the title character innumerable times; Amelie is a very poignant character and is beautifully acted.     This is one movie with everything -- vibrant colors, amazing acting,  a rich, witty plot and script, and uncontestable direction.  It is infused with French culture, and the language makes it just as beautiful to hear as to see.  <br />After seeing Amelie for the first time, I found my thoughts returning to it every few minutes.  I was so moved by this film that I could not go a full twenty-four hours without watching it again, and I bought it three days after my first viewing.  Be assured that you will be as touched as I if you watch it with your mind and heart open.
0316666343|4.0|Wow!  This lady had some nerve to write such a quirky story.  What a risk this book takes.  Like Kurt Vonnegut's 'Happy Birthday Wanda June.'  That's what this reminds me of.  I found this when I was on the Amazon page for 'Rich Man's Coffin,' another good book which a lot of people are getting in addition to this book for some reason.  I think they are similar in their unique approach to writing.
B00000DFSK|4.0|I must admit that I am not very fond of  U2. Personally I think they are overrated however I do think the band does have some really good songs. Most of those songs I like are before \\"Achtung Baby\\". In my case, I didn't want to go and get all of U2's earlier albums so instead I opted for their best of collection. Other than \\"Sweetest Thing\\" and \\"Bad\\", I love all of the songs on this cd.
B00006AFUR|5.0|I bought the 30 Seconds to Mars CD after seeing them in concert September 28th. They were amazing. I listening to the cd front to back like 4 times in a row. Its all so amazing with lots of outstanding special effects and the music blends so well with the singing and effects. Its a must buy. I reccomend it to anyone and everyone.
B00006G8HX|5.0|I haven't yet bought the DVD version of this fine movie, but I have watched the VHS version until my copies have all been reduced to tatters. One thing I haven't read in other reveiwers' comments is that this is the ultimate Star Trek movies' take on love. Mr. Nimoy's perspective on the freindship and love our heroes deal with during these trying events is exactly the reason I've spent thirty six years being addicted to Star Trek. If you wouldn't sacrifice everything for the people you care about, then what are they (and you) worth? Once again, James Kirk has shown us a proper path to justified existence. It's not about a battle, or a threat to human existence. It's all about the people we care about, and what we are willing to do (and lose) to keep them safe. I love this movie more than any of the other \\"classic\\" Trek films, because it is the most human of them all. Every time I watch it, I feel reaffirmed in my dedication to compassion, love, and loyalty. Mr. Nimoy deserves great credit for his work, as does Mr. Bennet. \\"Greater love hath no man than that he would lay down his life for a freind\\".<BR>This movie has inspired me for years.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|This movie was excellent.  I had no idea of the true story behind this movie, so how the producers introduced the characters (both real and imagined) was exceptional.  I normally don't watch drama's, however, this is a must own.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I completely disagree with the editorial reviewer. John Mayer's 2nd CD (Inside Wants Out was his first), is brilliant. His lyrics are true to life, unlike the bubbly-air-head pop of other groups and &quot;singers.&quot; And he has a voice like Dave Matthews? No! He has a voice all his own. One that's easy to fall in love with. ;D<br />This is a must buy. John Mayer rocks.
B000001EC1|4.0|This was a good compilation of Bon Jovi's music.  I am extremely happy that they put Runaway on the CD which was recorded by Jon Bon Jovi before he had a band.  It's a good collection of music if you liked the 80's rock and roll scene.  Good album if you remember Bon Jovi, but don't own any albums yet.
B00005KA9G|5.0|This classic (albeit very modern) 1997 British film, which I have seen a few times now, is one of my favourites.  The storyline is highly original, very funny, and hugely entertaining overall, but it's also heartwarming.  The setting is Sheffield, England, world famous for its steel.  Sadly Sheffield, like most of the North of England, has had to deal with massive unemployment; in Sheffield's case, it's a result of the collapse of the steel industry.  Briefly, the story revolves around six unemployed men, victims of the times, who aspire to \\"putting on\\" a one-night-only \\"full monty\\" (British slang for \\"taking it ALL off\\") strip show to raise some much-needed cash.  <br />The idea is actually the brain-child of one of the men, Gaz (played by Robert Carlyle (The World is Not Enough)), who is in arrears in his maintenance payments for his son (who lives with Gaz's ex-wife and her new boyfriend).  Gaz is at risk of losing joint custody and fears he may lose his son altogether.  His motivation (and indeed his desperation) in coming up with such an outrageous scheme is, therefore, both plausible and understandable, for the men stand to pocket a nice little sum of money if they can, quite literally, pull it off.  The film, which is 95 minutes, also features Tom Wilkinson (Essex Boys), who plays the lads' former boss from the steel factory, and Paul Barber (Denzil from Only Fools and Horses).  <br />In conclusion, I highly recommend this film to fans of British comedy in general, but I think its appeal is broad enough to be enjoyed by anyone looking for a thoroughly enjoyable comedy with a really good storyline.  Just one thing: Viewers ought to be prepared for fairly thick Yorkshire accents.  This may be a bit of a shock at first for the unfamiliar, but close attention helps and it is well worth the effort.  It's a cute story that is superbly acted and very well presented.  What's more, it's a film that can be enjoyed time and again.<br />Very highly recommended!
B000002UAR|5.0|When SGT PEPPERS was released it was said to be The Beatles masterpiece. All that has changed in recent years. This came out the year before PEPPER but is just as innovative as the latter. The Beatles spent 3 months recording this when they were on a break. Every song is good and the album as a whole is good. John and Paul were deep into studio experiments George was becoming a prolific songwriter and Ringo's drumming with his innovative \\"space fills\\" was brillient. John's \\"tommorow never knows\\" was a brillent collaboration of all four. At the time though not too many people  want too agknowledge this Paul was the avant garde member and he came up with the idea of using backward tape loops on the song. John other songs like \\"And your bird can sing\\" and \\"I'm only sleeping\\" are brillient exemples of psycadelia. \\"Dr. Robert\\" is not a bubblegum song as notated here by some people. It is about a drug dealer in england. Not a subject for a bubblegum song. Paul's songs like \\"For no one\\" are beutiful complex love songs that are not trite. George contributes his first real classic \\"Taxman\\". This is a great album were the songs and the experiments all come together as one to create a classic.
0375751513|5.0|\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\"<br /> Dorian Gray is a young Englishman who has it all - incredibly good looks, he is rich and favored by everybody, but bad companions encourage the worst in him.  A good friend of his paints his portrait.  Dorian Gray sees it and makes a wish not possible - to stay youthful forever.  He doesn't grow old but the picture of him does, in the most awful and frightening ways.<br /> Dorian shows his friend who painted the picture how it has changed - his friend reaches for a knife and charges at the picture.  Dorian restrains his companion and kills him with the knife.  Dorian grows more and more evil as the picture grows from awful to hideous.  Dorian tries to repent in the end and stabs the picture and the picture returns to how it was at the start, and the hideousness of it that tells who he has become shows on him at last.  He has stabbed at it and at himself, so he dies repenting.<br /> \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" was my favorite book over the summer because it was easy to read and easy to get into.  I also liked the pictures in the book.  I thought the storyline was great and loved the ending.<br /> I think that the one who would really like this book as much as me would be my sister, Breena because I know what she likes and she takes my judgement on books as I take hers.  She was the first one that introduced me to \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" because she is four years older than me.
B00006BTCA|5.0|Interpol are a group of Post modern New York rockers whose doomy bass line propelled songs provide a remarkably plaintive platform in which to launch their angst ridden musings on urban mayhem and alienation.<BR>A bass that shoots low and penetrates the spleen accompanied by the lead singers Ian Curtis like brooding voice gives it that Joy Division gloom, but the guitars bounce along like a CBGB's reunion - more Television than Bernard Sumner. <BR>NYC and PDA are early highlights building to a crescendo giving them a slightly cathartic quality. While Say Hello to Angels takes a riff from the clash and blasts off into another galaxy  leaving a trail of carnage and dispair in it's wake. Stella was a diver and she was always down sounds like a suicide note one would leave to a long lost lover and Roland nulifies the senses with guitars and bass grinding like a front end loader in overdrive. Interpol could well be the long lost off spring of Lou Reed and Patti Smith, they swagger and ooze New York arrogance in their op-shop suits. If they avoid imploding they could be at the helm of a far more insidious revolution than the one currently lead by the strokes, hives and the white stripes and become the conduit to a wave of new, new wave sounds. A dazzling debut, one of the albums of 2002.
B0000027G6|5.0|What an amazing score! It echoes the vast expanse of the prairies, shows us a peek inside the human heart and soul, spans the chasm of conflicting emotions and lets us down as gently as a falling feather. Standout tracks include Two Socks' Themes (loving playfulness), Kicking Birds Gift (stoic honor, steadfast friendship), The Love Theme (pure beauty unrestrained) and Farewell and End Title (to remind you of the journey you just took, like looking back on a sunset from a beaten path). The Love Theme is so beautiful it just breaks my heart every time. Hearing this score is what made me want to study music and learn to compose-the honor I would feel after creating such a work! What a joy to bring these emotions forth in so many others. Bravo, John Barry. What an amazing achievement!
0316666343|5.0|Sebold has created a breathtaking novel that builds an incredibly realistic world inhabited by well-developed characters the reader learns to care about. Each character is allowed to come to life and attempt to struggle through a world come undone. It is at once hauntingly beautiful and thoughtful and filled with vibrant details. It will leave the reader aching for more.
0316926345|5.0|This partial account of the life of the central character, Charles Ryder utilizes the &quot;flashback&quot; technique to show contrast between the barbaric present (1943) and the rich, full life that he had from the period of 1923 to 1939. As he enters the university we initially see Charles as he was taught to be, in reality a somewhat small and boring figure, never having experienced the joys of boyhood, but is given a glimpse of happiness during his tenure at Oxford and beyond, where he is influenced by a fateful encounter with members of an Aristocratic family. Charles discovers his true vocation as an Artist and is accepted as a member of the &quot;smart set&quot; that is a part of the Marchmain family social scene. The tragic aspect centers on the dictum: &quot;life does not always turn out like you planned&quot;. At one point Charles seems on the verge of inheriting the entire Marchmain estate due to his intended marriage with Julia but everything falls apart due to religious convictions, and world events. In Waugh's intent, he wants to show how the structure of society was shaken by World War 1 and completely destroyed by World War 2. When Charles speaks of the era of &quot;Hooperism&quot; he is implying that now an uneducated, somewhat disrespectful class of people were now ruling society and would lead us to a new dark age. When we return to the present in 1943 Charles is forlorn and regretful of all that has transpired, but he comes to accept things as they are having by chance returned to Brideshead in the army encampment and through those memories of the past renews the vigor within himself.
B00005J4HH|5.0|A-MAXING STUFF!! these guys are the best live act in the world at the moment, and this cd a work of art. if you like alternative music (of any kind) buy this cd right NOW! i promise you wont regret it!
B00000IWVS|5.0|The history behind this recording alone is a reason enough for piano music fans to get it. It is really great that such a gem was not kept locked in a drawer for good!<BR>For me, Fryderyk Chopin is the greatest piano music composer there is. My music teacher used to tell me that his music, perhaps more than any other's, allows a performer to express himself/herself thoroughly. Notably, tempo changes are a characteristic feature of the Polish composer's music and make it possible for every player to feel a composition in his or her very own way.<BR>That's exactly where Martha Argerich shows her class. Yes, she is passionate and vigorous, it is her primary feature, but also her sustained and soft playing is stunningly emotional. The mazurkas included here, especially No.s 37 and 38, are a good example. Argerich's victory at 1965 Warsaw Chopin competition is also a testimony to this. The Poles have always claimed they know &quot;their&quot; Chopin best and they feel it when someone plays his works well.<BR>The best performance on the CD is the final movement of Sonata No.3, the Finale, teeming with glorious virtuosity. As Suvi Raj Grubb writes in what later happened to be the liner notes, it was recorded in one flawless take. Splendid.<BR>The Polonaise No.6 is highly passionate piece and played in this manner alright, although some false notes occur now and then; however, it does not matter in this case, the sheer musical power here is overwhelming. By comparison, listen to Maurizio Pollini's version recorded for DG label -- his version is more polished and in my opinion better than Argerich's.<BR>Scherzo No.3 is also played very well, but I know a better version; on a rarity CD Rachmaninov Plays Chopin (RCA Victor Gold Seal), the maestro Rachmaninov himself performs this scherzo and the contrast between low chorals and sparkling high cascades in the middle of the piece is puzzling indeed!<BR>Overall, though, this disc deserves 5 stars. Martha Argerich was in top formin June 1965 and the sound is also very good. Here, the title 'legendary recording' is no exaggeration.
B00000G3PL|4.0|[Damn] do these guys talk a lot or what? Riggs and Murtaugh (Mel Gibson and Danny Glover) don't know when to quit. All they do is argue. It's like watching an episode of \\"The People's Court.\\" In \\"Lethal Weapon,\\" Riggs sports a mullet and teams up with old man Murtaugh to taken down a syndicate. The first movie is the best. More syndication going on in the sequel, \\"Lethal Weapon 2.\\" The mullet is back with Murtaugh. They are assigned to protect one of the most annoying guys in the world. Joe Pesci plays that man. More talking, more action and explosions. Good sequel. \\"Lethal Weapon 3\\" is cutting it close with it's overuse of bad jokes. The mullet is way too long here. Rene Russo was added in the cast to show more flair. Ok movie. Finally in \\"Lethal Weapon 4\\" you have Joe Pesci and Chris Rock going back and forth about cellular phone companies. The mullet has disappeared. Yes! Too bad Jet Li's character didn't get a hold of Leo and Noisy Guy #2. It's not flied lice, it's fried rice. Offensive! The most action, noise and nonsense were all rolled into this movie. It's still a good series that people will enjoy.
B00000JPH6|5.0|Jim Henson actually resented the Muppets' success much of the time, as it kept him from being taken seriously by many members of his industry, as well as the public.  He channeled much of this resentment into &quot;The Dark Crystal,&quot; which is often too dark for many of the children it was marketed towards.  As a child, however, I was never frightened by the film.  I was awed, mesmerized by it.  Although not wholly succesful in some aesthetic terms (the mouth movements of the Gelflings can be annoyingly badly synced to the actual dialogue), it is a truly beautiful film.  Almost 20 years down the line, and the ending still makes me a little teary.  OK, so I'm a big sap.  But as much as I love the Muppets, and I do, I regret that Jim Henson didn't have more opportunities to stretch his wings into more science fictiony, older audience things like this.  The extras on the disk are nice, too.  A fairly lengthy featurette on the making of the film sent me back to childhood, happily wide-eyed at the tricks they used to create another world.
B00005JKDR|5.0|I haven't read all the reviews, but I'm amazed that I've yet to see anyone point out the similarity between Monsters Inc. and the mid 1990's Nickelodeon cartoon series &quot;AAAAH! Real Monsters.&quot;<br />The idea of a secret monster civilization that has organized and institutionalized their mission of scaring humans is hardly original, but in this movie is well executed.<br />I wish the movie itself had been a bit longer and the characters had been developed a little more.  I would have liked to see a few more scenes from day-to-day monster life.<br />However, the bonus material on the DVD more than makes up for that, and it's all really great fun.  Good job, Pixar!

B00006HBUA|1.0|How can anyone with a functioning brain think that this film is worth looking at, let alone watching in its entirety.  I must confess however, I hate Scooby Doo, I've always hated Scooby Doo.  But there are a lot of things that I do not like that make good movies.<br />This is not a good movie. Scooby Doo is not only the worst movie ever made but it's probably the worst thing ever created by mankind.
0452282152|1.0|The basic elements of this story make no sense and are never explained.  <br />Why is it a secret and a big deal that Griet has been given the task of grinding pigments for her employer, Vermeer?  Grinding pigments was part of the daily work of the household, something a servant would have been expected to do.  The author, Chevalier, never suggests any reason.<br />Why should the wife, Katarina, go beserk when she learns that Griet has been sitting for a painting and wearing her pearl earrings while doing it?  The other maid had already been in a painting (the famous 'Woman with a Pitcher') so that could not have been any surprise or outrage.  <br />Half of Vermeer's paintings are of women wearing what Chevalier supposes was Katarina's yellow ermine-edged shawl, and her rope of pearls.  Why should she have had any problem with the same thing again?  Again Chevalier has no idea and proposes none.<br />Since, in the story the painting is commissioned by the patron Van Ruiven specifically because he is in lust with Griet, and Van Ruiven specified who he wanted in it, Katarina's fury makes no sense at all.<br />Finally Vermeer's gift to Griet by will of the pearl earrings, &quot;each as large as a hazelnut&quot;, and even larger in the painting, is not believable.  Vermeer would have known that, now ten years on, Griet was married and well-provided for.  He would have known too that his eleven children were going to be in poverty when he died.  That he would have given away immensely valuable pearls to a former maid, even one he had some feelings for, is not to be believed.<br />Based on the internals of the narrative, the earring weren't even his to give.  They belonged to his wife.<br />Nor are these minor details.  The story line and the ending revolve around them.  Peripheral plot failures can be overlooked.  Central ones cannot.
B00005JKL8|2.0|Watch Owen Wilson run!  Watch him outwit those ... foreigners!  Watch him bring truth and justice to war-torn Eastern Europe!  The problem is that this film is actually not too bad, it's just that sometimes I feel the need to be wrapped around the American flag while I watch parts of it.  There are some good action sequences in this film, like the one where he's walking through a minefield but there are other parts of the film that are so heavy-handed they make me groan.  But \\"Behind Enemy Lines\\" does answer one question: Can Owen Wilson act? Answer: Owen Wilson is one of the worst actors on the planet Earth.
B00005YW4H|5.0|... Her voice is so soothing and confident. ...After I learned Norah Jones' name I went out and bought the CD. No listening previews, no reading reviews, nothing. I just chanced that this would be a good purchase and how right I was!   I just pop the CD into the player and let it play all the way through. It gets twangy in spots but,...I'm willing to investigate a little twang. I really like this CD.  It has the craft of good, old music but it doesn't sound dusty or anything. Sounds like someone who enjoys what they're doing and enjoys doing it well.
B0000636UN|4.0|I must admit that I put off buying this album for a long while since the song \\"Steve McQueen\\" didn't appeal to me at all when I heard it on the radio. On the other hand I really enjoy \\"Soak up the Sun\\". <BR>     I have bought to many CDs with only two good songs on them, so I stayed away from this CD until I had a chance to listen to most of the songs on the album.<BR>     This is a solid album. Track 11 - \\"Lucky Kid\\" is the song that rocks the most on this CD. Track 5 - \\"It's so Easy\\" is a great duet with Don Henley. Overall it is a very mellow album.<BR>     <BR>     This album seems to be another confirmation that artists write better songs when they are poor and pissed off. The quality of their work seems to taper off after they have alot of money in their bank account. Hopefully, Sheryl Crow will have something that brings her back to the level of her self titled album.
B00006JL1Z|5.0|The Very Best of Fleetwood Mac collection is a nice warm up for the holidays, which should please fans old and new. The retrospective, which features the classic Rumours lineup, includes all the hits (and then some) from the 1975 \\"white\\" album through 1997's reunion album The Dance.<br /><br />It's refreshing to find some new elements incorporated into this release, making it more than just your standard best-of. Some of these highlights include single versions for \\"Rhiannon,\\" \\"Over My Head,\\" \\"Think About Me,\\" and \\"Sisters of the Moon\\" -- all previously unavailable on CD. There's also a different mix of \\"Silver Springs,\\" emphasizing Stevie Nicks' ad lib vocals at the end of the song. (The original 45 mix of \\"Silver Springs\\" has never been released on CD.)<br /><br />Overall, the sound quality is excellent. Remastered by engineering heavyweights Bill Inglot and Dan Hersch (who handle many of the Rhino remasters), the tracks have never sounded this good, particularly the ones from Rumours and Mirage. Everything is clean and crisp, with bass and high-end levels faithfully restored. Finally, the depth to these recordings has returned -- something dreadfully missing from the shoddy CD reissues from the late-80s and early 90s.<br /><br />The liner booklet is very well done, though the selection of photographs could be better. But there are some nice ones, like the one of Christine McVie playing a large bass. There is also a charming Rumours cover outtake featuring Stevie Nicks and Mick Fleetwood in an alternate pose. The liner notes are written well by David Wild, a contributing writer for Rolling Stone. Informative and concise. Selected discography, chart placements and credits are also included.<br /><br />The enhanced material (on disc 1) is adequate though it may a challenge to play on your computer. (QuickTime for the studio stuff and Windows Media Player for everything else seemed to work). The behind-the-scenes footage is probably the only real interest here, as much of the other material has been available previously. The behind-the-scenes footage takes you through a beautiful Bel Aire mansion (where the band is recording a new album, 2003's Say You Will), practice sessions, and short interviews about the recording process without Christine McVie, who retired from the music business.<br /><br />The other material on the CD, like \\"the vaults\\" (which has to be accessed through the Internet), is a bit disappointing, particularly the selection of performance clips. Two tracks are culled from the 1982 Mirage concert video (\\"The Chain,\\" \\"Go Your Own Way\\") and one from The Dance (\\"Don't Stop\\"). The music video for \\"Seven Wonders\\" is also included. The rarest footage included here is the classic Rosebud documentary performance of \\"Rhiannon.\\" (The entire Rosebud documentary will be available for the first time on DVD, when Warner Bros. issues the super deluxe edition of Rumours on January 29, 2013.)n available previously.

B00000IFWE|5.0|My first impression after I finished listing to the album for the first time was that Tom Petty had created the perfect rock and roll album. I still think that if it isn't the perfect rock and roll album it as close as we are ever going to get to it.  <BR>   Track 1 - \\"Room at the Top\\" and Track 5 - \\"Swingin'\\" give you a good taste of this album. If you don't like them, you won't like this album. <BR>   Track 9 - \\"Billy the Kid\\" and Track 10 - \\"I Don't Wanna Fight\\" are pure musical pleasure - rock and roll at its best. Hopefully Amazon will add samples of these tracks sometime soon.

B000068TPN|5.0|Just a hair shy of beating Saving Private Ryan as the best war movie of all time. If you enjoyed Blackhawk Down or Saving Private Ryan you need to buy this DVD. Then read the book. The movie is a very accurate rendition of the book - but the movie is only the first half of the book - the 3 day battle at Landing Zone X-ray. A few days after end of the battle at Landing Zone X-ray, a sister battalion that marched in to relieve them at Landing Zone X-ray then push forward, was chopped to pieces by the North Vietnamese.<br />      The book that the movie is based on: We Were Soldiers Once... and Young: Ia Drang--The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam is the best account of battle I have ever read. Even surpassing The Killer Angels by Michael Shaara.

B000002J1O|5.0|Message to James Rotondi: &quot;Selling England&quot; came out in 1973, Phil Collins' first lead vocal for the band was on the 1971 tune, &quot;For Absent Friends,&quot; and &quot;Abacab&quot; is a CUTE Genesis song??? (*major rolling of the eyes*) Please!Now that I've said that....1973's &quot;Selling England By The Pound&quot; is a much-loved Genesis album, featuring many great favorites from the band's Peter Gabriel era, such as the dramatic &quot;Dancing With The Moonlit Knight,&quot; the whimsical &quot;I Know What I Like&quot; (the band's first hit single on the British charts), the glorious &quot;Firth Of Fifth&quot; (featuring THE greatest guitar solo that Steve Hackett ever recorded with the group), the epic &quot;Battle Of Epping Forest,&quot; the lovely &quot;More Fool Me&quot; (with vocals by drummer Phil Collins), and the endearing Genesis staple, &quot;Cinema Show.&quot; All throughout the album, Peter Gabriel's lead vocals and flute-playing are supreme, Tony Banks serves up some of his best keyboard work ever, Phil Collins' drumming &amp; Mike Rutherford's bass-playing make a fantastic rhythm section, and guitarist Steve Hackett lays down what is arguably his most exquisite fretwork with the band (it's no wonder that Hackett names &quot;Selling England&quot; as his favorite Genesis album).&quot;Selling England By The Pound&quot; also marks a pinnacle of sorts for Genesis, as it represents the last time that Peter Gabriel thoroughly enjoyed himself as the band's frontman. The seeds of discontent between Gabriel &amp; the rest of the band would be sown on the next album, 1974's &quot;The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway.&quot; &quot;The Lamb&quot; is, without question, a great Genesis classic, but it ultimately signaled Gabriel's departure from the group soon afterwards. &quot;Selling England By The Pound,&quot; however, represents Gabriel-era Genesis in happier times, and the lovely, majestic quality of the album reflects that. &quot;Selling England&quot; isnot only one of Genesis' very best works, but it also stands today as one of the very best albums from the 70's progressive rock era. &quot;Selling England By The Pound&quot; is an outstanding, must-have Genesis album. :-)
B0000640SA|5.0|Director Christopher Nolan recieved a great deal of critical acclaim for Momento, and deservedly so. The film is unlike any film before it, and the amount of thought and artistry put into the film make it a true masterpiece. <br />The film is very unorthodox, for the sequence of events play almost backwards and forwards at the same time, achieveing a somewhat strange viewing experience. Often times it feels like deja vu, and leaves you questioning your own perception of events. <br />Nolan has really crafted this film into a visual and mental puzzle, giving us clues here and there yet never insulting our intelligence. Joe Pantoliano does a great job in this film, as does Carrie-Anne Moss, but Guy Pearce really does a marvelous job. He uses body language and other subtle devices to make his \\"condition\\" truly believeable. <br />The special edition DVD is very nice, as its packaging is very clever and fitting for a film such as this. The special features menu is a giant puzzle which you must decipher to access certain features, and it is very entertaining and enjoyable. A DVD set like this really makes you frown upon the many DVD's being released for big name movies with hardly a commentary track on them but priced twice as high. This limited edition version is worth every penny and is a must have if you love this film.
0385335482|5.0|This book was fantastic--I read it in less than two days. The heroine is believable, even if some of her misadventures were somewhat far-fetched.

B00006CXSS|5.0|I am a high school history teacher who teaches an elective that deals exclusively with the Second World War. This is, in my opinion, the single best production ever completed dealing with that conflict. Although I will always have great respect for \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" as the film that reopened the interest in this conflict, the \\"Band of Brothers\\" series matches and, in my opinion, surpasses that film because it is all true. If you are a WWII buff or even just marginally interested, this is worth owning and watching several times--all the time remembering that these are characterizations of REAL PEOPLE... as the ad says, \\"...ordinary men who were asked to do extraordinary things...\\" so we could all enjoy the freedom we currently (many of us) take for granted. This is a film series that is at once moving, historically informative, entertaining and a tribute to men who never asked for one, but richly deserve one (at least one). BUY THIS AND WATCH IT WITH YOUR KIDS. Then tell them to call grandpa and say THANK YOU.
B0000524CY|5.0|The Exorcist is truly a scary movie, even almost 30 years after its release. It had just the right amount of special effects to comprise some truly gory scenes. An excellent cast and crew featuring Ellen Burstyn, Linda Blair and Max von Sydow made the movie quite engaging.<br />In one sense, The Exorcist is almost the scariest movie of all time; it is second only to John Carpenter's Halloween. Michael Myers in the dark seemed just a little creepier than a bedridden, demon-possessed Regan. However, I say almost in the context of what was played out on the screen. <br />In another sense, The Exorcist is truly the scariest of them all. With scenes featuring the unholy desecration of a Statue of Mary at the start and evil eyes that come from nowhere, especially those that Regan suddenly sees as she is undergoing EEG's, there is not much left to the imagination in terms of what more might have been added. And that is enough to make one say, \\"Thank God that these visions and added effects were limited!\\"

6305358613|5.0|Elizabeth is a fine movie featuring the many talents of Cate Blanchett, Geoffrey Rush, John Gielgud, Joseph Fiennes, Richard Attenborough, and more. Though not historically accurate, it is nonetheless a tribute to the monarch, who is displayed as a woman who progresses from an unassertive individual to one who, as Queen Elizabeth, has the power to create what is regarded as the Golden Age of England's history.<br />Upon inheriting the throne from half-sister, Mary of Scots, Elizabeth is faced with legions of foes. Her opponents are those heading the Catholic church and are essentially looking for a theocrat who, as her predecessor had done, will continue to make Catholicism thrive and persecute those of other faiths. Elizabeth, however, is the antithesis of their desires, for she seeks to loosen ties with Rome and help establish a Church of England. Not only does this stance sit unfavorably with many religious and political leaders, but the very fact that she was not born into the Catholic faith leads many to disregard her as a true Queen of England.<br />Throughout the movie, the rivals and, to a certain extent, supporters of Elizabeth meet with forces from France, Spain and Rome to undermine her authority as Queen of England. She is faced with various choices as given to her by her initial advisors: If she marries the ruler of either France or Spain, then she will become the wife of a leader whose empire is mightier than hers and thus make England subordinate, or if she decides to no longer continue as Queen, then the doorway will be open for the Catholic massacres to continue.<br />Elizabeth decides neither, for she wants to remain in power without having to marry a powerful individual she does not love or even like. Upon resolution, she changes her administration and appoints a confidant who is well aware of the political and religious scenes that threaten her security to the throne.<br />Intermittently in the picture, there is one supporter who lacks confidencein her ability simply because of her gender. As an ultimate response that seems to set the tone for the remaining third of the picture, she firmly retorts that she is her father's daughter and that if she chooses so, she can have the heart of a man. <br />It is from that scene that the viewer might be led to think that perhaps Elizabeth wants to replicate Henry VIII's reign and that the determination to \\"think like a man\\" will lead her to triumph. But I say that that they are only pieces of the formula, because with time she is revealed as an intelligent person who is increasingly cunning.<br />And when she finds out that her once intimidating opponents now want her dead after discovering that they have placed their signatures on documents that declare her an \\"illegitimate\\" heir ... she sees clearly where things unequivocally stand and can then face this hateful resistance like a woman scorned...
B00005JKLZ|2.0|The movie is another recent (Queen of the Damned) poor book's adaptation. Guy Pierce is better to play a villain than a hero. The settings for the future world to come is decent but who will believe the earth could survive the Moon's destruction. And even if it did, how come some (extremely beautiful) people survived intact on the surface of the Earth while others needed to hide below it mutating into brainless (or brainstorming) canibalistic creatures. Sure, H.G. Wells book covers some of this stuff, but the the fashion the movie is trying to paint the evolution doesn't have any sense. If you need to watch this movie, wait until it's on free TV. Don't waist money on rental, and definitely do not buy DVD.
B000002KKS|5.0|This is the best Black Sabbath album ever recorded. Nothing which was recorded before or after can hold a candle to it. This was the pinnacle of their musical prowess and creativity. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love all the Ozzy stuff, and I even love all the later Sabbath stuff, namely the albums recorded in the late 80's and early 90's with Tony Martin on vocals. But there is something about this album that is different. Perhaps it just found me at the right moment of my jaded youth when it could speak to me with a voice that I was perfectly in tune with, and which I perfectly understood. Either way, Dio was not simply a replacement for Ozzy. He took the band to a level of genius that was impossible in the earlier days. If you haven't heard this one yet, do so. You won't be disappointed.
B00004TWZF|5.0|I have only seen the european version of this film, and the usage of French, Italian and English altogether.. adds sooo much to this film. 'Cause, the main characters of the movie are extremely different from each other, but they come together in a very poetic plot. And this continuous use of different languages supports this story. The scenes, the characters are all so beautiful that I find myself holding my breath while I watch the film. Its a classic.
B000002U82|5.0|If you haven't heard this album yet you should be slapped.  It is THE BEST rock album ever created in my opinion.  Dark Side is an emotional rollercoaster.  You must listen to it in the dark, alone, straight through and then more.  Sure, Pink Floyd's other albums are great but what separates this album from things like The Wall, Meddle, Wish You Were Here, Etc..is the way the tracks are laid out.  The first track slips you into Floyd's slow, hypnotic realm, and then you are hurled into a fast-paced paranoid adventure with &quot;On The Run&quot;, and so-on.  At the end of the album you feel like it is the end of your life each time, with Floyd's two minute explanation of it in &quot;Eclipse&quot;. It is a highly emotional, well-structured, great sounding masterpiece.  Many disagree but i feel the length of it is excellent too.  It isn't up for arguing.  Get this album if you don't have it...or *slap*!...I'll getcha!
B00006F7S4|4.0|Cracks me up when a reviewer says this:<BR>&quot;Play this at a hip, happening party, and one of 2 things will happen: people will leave, or someone will say 'what happened to the GOOD music?'&quot;.  <br />Give me a break - what's wrong with different types of music for DIFFERENT situations.  You're not going to put this on at a party so why even put that absurdity in a review.  Fact is, this is some great music.  Some parts remind me of acoustic Neil Young (like &quot;Already Dead&quot;) and I've even heard a little Waters/Floyd vocal in there.  Yes, it's not completely new/original acoustic work, but it's great and it sounds like Beck needed to get it out.  Listen a couple of times and it hooks you.  Beck is one of those great artists that can change from album to album.  Enjoy it - I do.
B0000042MY|5.0|I finally had to come recommend this soundtrack.  I've never even seen the movie, but every night, and I mean EVERY night, unless the t.v. goes off too late and we're too drowsy to get back out of bed to turn it on, this cd plays on our stereo.  Night after night, the same music, and we've never once felt that we were tired of it.  I guess it's become like an old friend by now.  I look forward to each and every track, and have spent many minutes lying in my bed, trying to identify the different instruments as they play their part.  It's much more interesting and soothing than counting sheep, and I actually don't think my husband has ever heard the last track.  One day I was teasing him about never hearing &quot;the lady&quot; sing on the last track, and he replied, &quot;What lady?&quot;.  Sweet dreams everyone!
B00006J3WH|5.0|After reading a few reviews, I think some people are being picky. If you bought this album, more than likely you have seen the episode, are a BtVS fan/fanatic, a fan of one or more of the actors, or of Joss Whedon himself.  <br />This album is a perfect compliment to the musical episode as it has every song--in order-- and even includes some instrumentals from &quot;Hush&quot;, &quot;Restless&quot; and &quot;The Gift&quot;.  I especially enjoyed the songs &quot;Under your spell&quot;, &quot;Where do we go from here?&quot;, &quot;Walk through the fire&quot;, &quot;Coda&quot;, &quot;Standing&quot; and &quot;Under your spell/Standing- reprise.&quot;<br />The bottom line is the CD is a great buy if you loved the musical enough that you want to hear the music over and over.  Some are more talented than others, but everyone sang to the best of their ability and Sarah Michelle Gellar gets a gold star from me because she had to sing the most as she's the star. Her voice was fine, though higher than I expected. As far as I'm concerned, this CD is better than the soundtrack to the show. <br />Also, &quot;Where do we go from here?&quot; is still a theme that I think can be applied to this new season of Buffy as well.
B00005QK3D|5.0|I'm not going to analyze every song here, because it's pointless, but I had to write a review in order to bump up this album's rating. Is it just like old Helloween? No. But it is still BRILLIANT. It's more complex, they're songwriting improved, vocals are earth-shattering as always. If you're a Helloween fan who wants an album that could blow the doors off the house this is it.

0425098478|5.0|Imagine a show where a whale suddenly emerges above the surface of the water, jumps over a rope to a thunderous applause from the audience who don't mind being drenched by the splash of water. How was the whale trained to do this, one may wonder. The training had actually started under water, where the whale was rewarded with food each time it crossed over the rope. The rope was then gradually raised and the whale jumps over it even if is above the water level.<br />Imagine the rope as the goal setting exercise in our organizations. We reward people for attaining their goals and we raise the bar every time to get the best out of every one.  <br />This book is about Goal Setting, Rewarding and Reprimanding. It also proves a very important concept. The normal confusion is that democratic managers sacrifice results while the result oriented managers sacrifice people. The One Minute Manager teaches us to be simultaneously good at achieving results and taking care of people.
B00000JFV9|5.0|Anythin' he touched in the 70's was great...even those bad diso albums....
B00005JKGV|5.0|David Lynch spent most of the early- and mid-1990s in a kind of torpor.  After the cancellation of Twin Peaks and the (deservedly) cool reception to \\"Wild at Heart,\\" Lynch turned to other projects, including his art and another television show that never really made it past the pilot stage.  In 1997, he returned, arms swinging, with \\"Lost Highway,\\" and it was certainly a project for which the wait was worth it.<br />Bill Pullman (whom I normally cannot stand as an actor, but he turns in a killer performance here) plays Fred Madison, an avant-garde jazz saxophonist who suspects his wife (the beautiful Patricia Arquette) is cheating on him.  Someone keeps leaving plain brown envelopes on their doorstep, with videotapes of their house inside.  When one of the tapes shows the couple sleeping, Madison calls the cops.  That night, at a party, he meets a Mysterious Stranger who convinces Madison that something's very wrong.  He doesn't know the half of it, and the rest of the movie is an unraveling of Fred's life, in more ways than one.<br />Some of the typical Lynch stuff is here: mysterious people who seem to be some kind of supernatural force, invisible characters, and characters that `morph' into new characters.  It's also a tribute to the film noir style with some amazing scenes (the desert seduction scene is one of the sexiest ever committed to film), and borrows many elements from \\"Vertigo,\\" a film that was truly ahead of its time.<br />\\"Lost Highway\\" may seem like it's weird for the sake of being weird, and it's the kind of movie that appeals to those snobby filmgoers who like to brag about figuring out artistic mumbo-jumbo, but it's not.  Lynch, who typically says very little about his films, has given people two clues about \\"Highway\\": it's set in the same `universe' as Twin Peaks, and that the film is essentially a `psychogenic fugue,' a term described in the DSM-III-R as a state where someone under immense stress suddenly adopts an entirely new personality, with new memories.  With that in mind, the film isn't terribly difficult to figure out, if you are familiar with some of Lynch's recurring symbols and his style.  Each Lynch film has a certain theme, and the theme here seems to be how one person deals, psychologically, with his life when he discovers it was not what it seemed to be.  To say any more would ruin the fun, though, except to add that \\"Lost Highway\\" is almost a mirror image of \\"Mulholland Dr.,\\" so if you understand one, it's not difficult to understand the other.  I should also note that, personally, I found \\"Lost Highway\\" to be a (slightly) better film than \\"Mulholland,\\" but still believe \\"Blue Velvet\\" is Lynch's best, so that might offer some kind of measuring stick for those familiar with his other works.<br />Like Lynch's other films, \\"Highway\\" isn't for everyone, but it offers the same kinds of rewards for anyone who wants to engage himself or herself in following the trial of clues \\"Highway\\" offers.<br />Final Grade: Ath new memories.

B000003TA4|5.0|This is just one of the few albums in which the entire album just flows without any weirdness or moments that need to be skipped over. All the songs fit the album like a glove, and the order of the songs is very fitting as well. From the Gen-X anthem \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\\" to the aduction-tale of \\"Polly,\\" to the sadness of \\"Something In The Way,\\" Nevermind is just a great record. Cobain, Novoselic and Grohl had an excellent chemistry together, and Butch Vig/Andy Wallace made the group sound very tight and captured their essence perfectly.
B00006674X|3.0|This, Elvis' final acting film is probably one of his best and gives the King a serious acting role from the beach movies of a few years previous. The DVD is very clear, but seriously lacking in extras, after all, it is full priced.
B000002GVO|4.0|The Eagles were always better at recording singles than whole albums.  At least, they were until guitarist Joe Walsh joined the fold for &quot;Hotel California&quot; in 1976.  Give Walsh credit.  He already had a successful solo career, and didn't need to merge with Henley, Frey and company to enhance his popularity.  What Walsh managed to do was improve the band's songwriting and give it a stronger sonic edge.  That is readily apparent on the title track, which is the band's best song.  Without Walsh's expert picking, the song simply wouldn't be the same.<br />&quot;Life in the Fast Lane&quot; and &quot;New Kid in Town,&quot; were also radio hits, but unlike previous Eagles albums the remaining songs don't sound like mostly filler material.  Walsh even gets in a lead vocal on &quot;Pretty Maids All in a Row.&quot;  Ultimately, &quot;Hotel California&quot; is a true group success, with all five members contributing equally, a major feat given the egos that must have been involved.<br />Overall, &quot;Hotel California&quot; deservedly ranks as The Eagles' best studio album.
B00003CXAE|5.0|Just when I thought musicals were dead in Hollywood, I got this one to be personally devoted to. Great ensemble cast managed to carry this movie to all-time favorite status. Just wish they made more like this one. Travolta, Newton-John, and the rest of the gang did it for me! Wonderful stuff. And I loved all the cameos.....Sid Caesar, Eve Arden, Joan Blondell, Edd Byrnes. Major cool stuff!
0060977493|5.0|This novel was wonderful.  The characters were so alive and the story was breathtaking.  I can't wait until she writes something else.
B00003CXSM|4.0|I am probably not a J. Lo fan per se, but I thought she was absolutely perfect and even divinely adorable in this movie. As for Matt McConaughey.....wow, who wouldn't like this guy! This flick wasn't cerebal, but it didn't have to be. I wanted to laugh and get involved and it suited my needs at the moment. (I was in a funk.) It's a feel good movie as well as a comedy of errors. You know things will get complicated and will improbably work out. If that wasn't enough, the story is set in San Francisco and I got to see a favorite city to boot. Anyway, by the last scene, I was funk free and very glad I bought this one.
B0000542D2|2.0|With such a deluxe package, why only 5.1 audio track ? This movie was originally in mono. I would welcome that! When I called Miramax, they said it was in 2.0 only. Well, my dvd player reads it in 5.1 only. I dont own surround sound (and dont want it) and I sure didn't think with such a deluxe package, that I had to worry about an audio track. It sounds processed when I play it. Thanks Miramax !!!
B00005TT77|5.0|What can I say- the CD was a gift and one that I didn't particularly want and now its one of my favorites.  All the artists did justice to the beatles originals.  This is truly a fun CD.  For some younger listners who weren't familiar with the older tunes this will be a particularly sweet treat. Enjoy...
B00006AG5N|5.0|Elvis Presley. The King. Burger guzzling, pill popping, jump suited cultural atrocity. Impersonated, idolised, revered. Heart stopping beauty, hip thrusting iconoclast. Elvis. How easy to forget that under the smothering legend there was also a singer.<br />This collection therefore offers an ideal opportunity to take a hard look at the musical legacy and ask whether it still bears scrutiny. To many Elvis seems the preserve of the aged, ridiculous and irrelevant, but this record makes it clear that Elvis is one of the major ghosts haunting pop music, as powerful and potent a presence as The Beatles, Bowie and Dylan. <br />'Number Ones' brilliantly kicks off with Presley's voice, raw, whooping 'well, since my baby left me', and leading into the bluesy boogie of 'Heartbreak Hotel'. It's a stark reminder of Presley's charisma and just how earth shattering this feral music must have felt, crashing into the polite world of the post war fifties. It also reminds how apt a phrase rock and roll was: this music really does rock with sexual energy and roll with lecherous intent.<br />Speaking of sexual energy, 'Hound Dog' is unbelievably lewd, a thunderous slice of carnality that makes Prince sound like a eunuch. 'All Shook Up' is as fresh and irresistible as ever, and 'Jailhouse Rock' is a thrilling, charged rock masterpiece. Strangely, the recent remix of 'A Little Less Conversation' sits quite happily amongst these tracks, similarly virile and brash. For the gusto and potency Elvis brought to rock, we are forever in his debt.<br />Presley the balladeer is as influential, though this is more an accusation than a plaudit. Though Presley's technical performances on melodramas such as 'Are You Lonesome Tonight' are spectacular, there is something manipulative in these songs, the sheer sugariness of the sentiments appearing to hide a fatal insincerity. Its an insincerity that has been one of pop's direst and most persistent maladies, today found in its purest, tritest form in Gareth Gates' soulless confections, not a word of which any sane person could believe.<br />Why did Presley eclipse more sincere songwriting contemporaries, such as the idiosyncratic Buddy Holly or the heartbreaking balladeer Roy Orbison? Partly its due to his skill as an all rounder, switching from swagger to sentiment with chart-teasing ease. But surely the real answer lies in one word: SEX. All pop pretty boys follow in the footsteps of this pouting momma's boy. <br />Few, however, can boast a back catalogue as fine as this. The spurious 'number one' theme means the sad omission of 'Always On My Mind' and the sadder inclusion of second raters such as 'Wooden Heart' and the nauseatingly camp 'Teddy Bear'. <br />But 'Can't Help Falling In Love' is a dreamy, seductive wonder, whilst 'In The Ghetto' overcomes its potentially hypocritical sentimentality to become a truly moving cry for the dispossessed of the world. And 'Suspicious Minds' is simply perfect; bitter, intense and harrowing, all wrapped up in one of the loveliest melodies of the last century. Even if Elvis hadn't been Elvis he would deserve remembering for this.<br />BIG DAN's OVERALL RATING: 9.5/10
B00006AFUR|5.0|From hard rocking riffs, to beautiful melodic melodies, this album is a must buy. Take Incubus, Linkin Park and Tool, then mix with a psycho space rock sound. Then you'll have 30 seconds to mars. This is a truly great album.
B000002UV9|3.0|OK i think there is something wrong with me, I got this CD after reading such great reviews about it only to find a few songs on it I liked, Its kind of Meat Head . The title song is great and a couple of the slower ones have substance but mostly I found the other songs on this CD I just tolerate, Queensryche have proven they can do much better than this, check out OPERATION MINDCRIME or PROMISED LAND for something great...HEAR IN THE NOW FRONTIER, thats a very good CD.
630460291X|1.0|There is only one version of the Robin Hood story worth looking at, and that is Robin of Sherwood. Better acted, better scripted, better filmed, better researched and a thousand times more entertaining.<br />And given how much the Costner debacle has &quot;borrowed&quot; from it, they obviously thought so too
B00005JKWI|5.0|I was going to say refreshingly new levels, as in the creative sense, but the word &quot;refreshing&quot; might not exactly work in this movie.  For this is a bloody, gory, sadistic piece of art that gets down and dirty from the starting gate, and never lets go.  It's really a terrific movie.<br />Why?  Two reasons.  First, the special effects.  I've written in other reviews how I can give or take them.  Sometimes they help, sometimes I find them annoying.  A good movie still depends on plot, and if it's all special effects, no matter how good, there will be always something missing from the movie.  In this movie, they are not only good, as in the fight scenes, which convey the speed and agility of super beings fighting each other.  But they are also essential to the plot, which is reason two. <br />We are used to vampires being the bad guys, and this also remains for this flick.  But the story takes a plot twist when Blade and his mortal vampire enemies find themselves uneasy allies.  Why?  Because an even more terrifying and powerful breed of monster has evolved.  This new breed is kind of like a vampire, but, and this is where it becomes art, has powers and physical abilities that make the &quot;regular&quot; vampires look wimpy.  Part of these physical abilities are very realistically shown via the special effects, and therefore essential to the plot.  <br />I will not reveal what these new abilities are, but if you like you vampires gory, sadistic, and bloody, this one's for you.  And yes, there is even some good plot thrown in, as the previously mortal enemies are forced to work together.  There is also the return of Kris Kristofferson, who has been rescued from the vampires, but must be watched to see which side of the fence he's going to be playing on.  <br />Overall, one of the best action sequels ever made.
B00000254Q|5.0|Excellent selection of some of Carlos' best work, songs ranging in tempos for every taste.  Great collection for getting your body moving, starting with &quot;Dance Sister Dance&quot;, but &quot;Europa&quot; is a gorgeous classic song.  An often overlooked CD in Santana's huge catalog, but definitey a 'must listen!'
1565847032|2.0|This book is 25% brilliance, and 75% sheer lunacy.<br />Readers should take Chomsky's discussion of the corporate media apparatus at face value. Understanding Power discusses at length the fact that the media is driven by what sells newspapers and ad space, rather than actually informing the public.  In addition, some of Chomsky's discussion about \\"Big Brother\\" operations of the FBI (e.g. COINTELPRO) reinforce Jefferson's brilliant maxim:  \\"the government that governs least, governs best.\\"<br />On the other hand, Chomsky's thesis, which lays the blame for virtually every conceivable global problem at the doorstep of the White House, is tired, careworn and simplistic.  His discussion of U.S. foreign and domestic policy during the Cold War is out of context and one-sided.  While focusing on CIA wrongdoing in Southeast Asia and FBI abuses at home, Chomsky omits the fact that the U.S. was embroiled in a life or death struggle with a superpower dictatorship:  the Soviet Union.  In addition, the terroristic acts and espionage of such groups as the Black Panthers, the Communist Party of the USA, and the Viet Cong are conveniently swept under the rug in Chomsky's analysis.<br />If you want to learn more about Big Brother, then this book should work for you.  When reading about U.S. foreign policy, however, a grain of salt won't do -- you'll need a whole shaker!
B000068IEU|2.0|...This is not a <BR>Horror\\" movie but rather a cheply made exploitation film ...The acting is bad, the script is bad and this film is horrible except for the rather campy ending of revenge with the father who weilds a chainsaw and buzzes the maniac who raped his daughter. The extras on the dvd were better than the movie...
B000002LCD|3.0|Who's that Girl has a total of 9 songs on the soundtrack.  I like 5 out of the 9 songs.  Of course the Madonna songs are the best.  I would def. recommend you buying this if you are a big Madonna fan.  Madonna contributed 4 songs on the soundtrack.  The only non-Madonna song I like on the cd is Turn it Up.  I skip the other 4 songs because they just don't interest me.
B0000640VO|5.0|After seeing Audrey Tautou in this film, even a sociopath might start looking at life differently. That's all I can say. Please browse my Listmania list for other &quot;comedies that touch your heart&quot; like this one. They don't come by very often.
B000003TAW|5.0|There is only one word to epitomize this debut album: brilliant.  If this opened the doors to the music business for Weezer, they were given the key and asked to return.  This songs, aren't only catchy, they have hidden meanings. &quot;Say It Ain't So&quot; is about a person dealing with an alcohol addiction (This bottle of Stephen's awakens ancient feelings/My love is a life taker) although you might be more taken in by the quirky lyrics (Flip on the tele/Wrestle with Jimmie).  Now lets look deeper at the song that made Weezer famous: &quot;Buddy Holly&quot;. &quot;Buddy Holly&quot; is about a meganerd who both him and his girlfriend are getting harassed and beaten (What's with these homies, dissing my girl?/Why do they gotta front?/What did we ever do to these guys that made them so violent?). So there, once you buy this cd, listen not only to the catchy tunes, or the straight forward lyrics, but listen to the songs &quot;between the lines.&quot; Other favorites: &quot;My Name is Jonas&quot; &quot;The World has Turned and Left Me Here&quot; &quot;In the Garage&quot;.
B00005JKNF|1.0|I respect Robert Altman for Short Cuts and McCabe and Mrs Miller and The Long Goodbye. Some of his other films, such as Nashville or MASH, I see as possessing some ineffable sort of integrity, while not exactly being able to muster a solid appreciation for them. The later films, like Cookie's Fortune and Gosford Park, I turn inside out, like an empty coat pocket, searching for the Altman of old, alas to find that he really isn't there, and beginning to wonder if he ever was in the first place.<br />To a part of Altman's audience, the absence of dynamics from his work is a premium seal of his seriousness as an artist. There was always a lack of affect in Altman's films, even in his best work, a Dreyer-like, Bresson-like reticence to direct the audience's experience of the material of the story, or in other words, to give that story dramatic shape. There are no Spielbergian cues in all of Altman. He leaves it to his audience to sort through the uncollated heaps of data, and make of the time spent what they will. Flattered as I am by his trust in me as a sort of information sieve, I wish he would exert himself just a little more as a storyteller, a narrator, a dramatist. --Now more than ever. The part of the audience that is made feel brainy by the postmodern eschewing of shape are welcome to it.<br />Gosford Park goes over the top as anti-experience. It is indeed a two and a half hour vamp, spent waiting for something that never does to materialize out of thin air. <br />Sadly, I give this film 1 star.
B000003BD3|4.0|The Rolling Stones Rock And Roll Circus was released Oct 15, 1996.  It is the long suppressed made-for-TV special recorded 28 years earlier on Dec 11-12, 1968 with The Who, John Lennon, Taj Mahal, Jethro Tull, Marianne Faithful, and Eric Clapton.  The packaging is beautiful with a great 42 page glossy color booklet that has all the rare behind the scenes photos and a full account of things leading up to the event.  The Who were red hot at the time and easily upstaged the Stones who were still struggling through their first major crisis after the removal of Brian (and his subsequent death) and attempting to figure out how to hold on to their status as the premier band.  The Stones refused to release the recordings because their performances were not spectacular.  Most reviewers agreed when they finally got to see the film themselves.  However, what the film lacks in production (which was obviously amateurish) it makes up for in history.  The Stones lackluster set of Jumpin' Jack Flash, Parachute Woman, No Expectations, You Can't Always Get What You Want, Sympathy For the Devil, and Salt Of The Earth are easily compensated by The Who's mini opera A Quick One While He's Away and Lennon and Clapton's Yer Blues.  There are also dated period piece interviews with Mick and John and very amateurish introductions by the individual Stones, which when combined with the extremely amateurish set, acting, and cinematography amply demonstrate why this is one for Stones and rock history collectors.  The Stones were right, it didn't work for them, and it is good that the release was delayed until it appealed to collectors and would not reflect on the reputation of the band.<br />Most people know the music, so in my reviews I try to give you data on the sessions and interesting facts connected with the songs and the album.  Here we go:<br />Interesting notes include:<br />.....this CD and the companion DVD and VHS releases were the last time Brian Jones performed with the Stones<br />.....Brigitte Bardot was Mick's original choice for the ringmaster, when she declined, he did it himself<br />.....Keith wanted Johnny Cash, but he declined too<br />.....Mick refused to consider Jimmy Page's new band \\"The New Yardbirds\\" without hearing their tapes (which were released on their first album \\"Led Zeppelin\\")<br />.....Ivry Gitlis was a great classical violin virtuoso.....he accepted an invitation to perform because he respected Brian Jones<br />.....John Lennon's temporary supergroup (Clapton, Mitch Mitchel, and Keith) was named Dirty Mac in response to the hottest band of the day....Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac<br />.....the taping started around noon on Dec 11 and ran for 18 hours...when the specially chosen fan audience left at 6AM, Mick and Keith shook hands with most of them and thanked them for coming<br />Other songs from the same show that were recorded for the Circus but which have not yet been released are:<br />.....Route 66<br />.....Confessin' The Blues<br />.....Yonder Wall<br />.....Walkin' Blues<br />This information comes from \\"It's Only Rock And Roll: The Ultimate Guide To The Rolling Stones\\" by Karnbach and Bernson  and from my own collection, with some of the notes from Davis' \\"Old Gods Almost Dead.\\"  Both books are available from Amazon.com.

B00005JKDR|5.0|This loveable movie takes you behind the scenes of the life of Monsters! There are a few scary moments for the little ones at the beginning, but knowing the monsters secrets sure gives them power over their own monsters in the closet!<br />The 2 DVD collection contains many extras for the young and old. The games are engaging and the graphics are wonderful!
B000005JHP|5.0|Never for Ever is in my opinion the aural equivalent of a Miyazaki film.  You know, the director of Princess Mononoke and the more recent Spirited Away.  I guess the reason Kate Bush is my favorite artist of all time is because she has the ability to fuse the elements of myth with situations which take place in some far off reality.<br />My personal favorite songs on this disc: Delius (Song of Summer), Blow Away (For Bill), The Wedding List, and Breathing; are tunes which deal with the physical and metaphysical in a way which is simply breathtaking.  For much of her career Kate has retreated from the mainstream only to reemerge with a new view on reality which is quite utterly unique.  This is THE Kate Album in my opinion.  Only The Dreaming can equal it in sonic adventurous-ness and depth.  <br />Truly an album for all time.
B00006IUL7|1.0|The original Erik Skjoldbjrg version stands head and shoulders above this release-it at least was original and not just a Hollywood re-packaging job. This version... attempts to re-make a fine movie for consumption by the US population. Don't give me the excuse that \\"North American audiences only want this English version.\\" They have been marketed the \\"desire\\" to consume this version and the monopolistic distribution mechanism is why this version has sold. Why didn't they put the original version's actors on the Dave Letterman, Jay Leno and the rest of the Hollywood re-marketing division shows? It is the TV advertising for weeks and then the screenings at every theater in the country that \\"made\\" this version a success. <BR>Don't forget this is a copy of a great movie; any good aspects of it come from the original and not from this version's directorial skills or even the actors. Just a suggestion for those involved-try being original for a change. BTW I give this version 0 stars and two thumbs down...
B000006U44|5.0|Well, this is cd where it all began.  And being that these were the recorded musings of a teenager, some of the songs are a little guilty of whimsy overload.  But at the same time you will never hear these melodies anywhere else...<br />Personal favorites are:  Kite (one of her best songs in my opinion although it often provokes a strong love/hate reaction from fans, I think it's signature Kate), Feel It (an incredibly sweet piano ballad), and Them Heavy People (a lightly funky ditty about honoring your own imagination instead of the droll realism of those around you).
B00005R62K|2.0|I can assure you that this album is overrated. SIN AFTER SIN and HELL BENT FOR LEATHER (KILLING MACHINE) are clearly better than STAINED CLASS. They have more focus, more punch, a consistent line of work.<br />The riffs in STAINED CLASS are weak and uninspired (exception: EXCITER and BEYOND THE REALMS OF DEATH). The album is not bad, but the others albums are better.
B000007MVL|5.0|Lionheart is an interesting case.  Completed in relative haste after the success of Kate's debut \\"The Kick Inside\\" is has stimulated both love and loathing from those who have experienced it.  <br />I for once think that it's darling.  For one thing it's shorter (10 songs compared to TKI's 13) and benefits from a more uniformity of mood.  The songs themselves also seem more focused and concentrated than those on her debut.<br />My personal favorites are: In Search of Peter Pan (which has a stunning chorus refrain and includes a dark version of \\"When You Wish Upon A Star\\"), Wow (a very memorable melody and chilling vocals, though knowing Kate that really isn't saying much ;p ), Coffee Homeground (a slightly insane number about serial murder through poisioning), and finally Hammer Horror (which features of of Kate's most driving choruses).<br />Overall I like Lionheart much better than either her debut or her two later albums The Sensual World and The Kick Inside.  As I have discussed on a Kate related messageboard, it would make a great musical indeed!
0399230033|5.0|My son loves this book!  I think it must be because the illustrations are easy on his eyes.  The drawings are very childlike and the colors(mostly primary)are perfect.  This is the story of a zookeeper who is closing the zoo for the night, and while he says \\"goodnight\\" to each critter, the gorilla, who is first, steals his keys and lets all the animals out.  They all follow him home, and he never even notices!  His pop eyed wife has to take care of them herself.  It's the most adorable little book!  There isn't much to read. It's more of a feast for the child's eyes right before he sets off to night nights.<br />The copy I have is a small board book, and it's small enough for my son's little hands to hold and admire all by himself.<br />I highly recommend buying this for the child at age 21 month and over.
B000006MS3|5.0|The Dreaming, The Dreaming, The Dreaming...*sigh*<BR>Where to begin...<br />Let me start off by saying that The Dreaming is a COMPLETELY self-contained work.  Nothing on projects preceding (Never for Ever) or subsequent (Hounds of Love) sound quite like what Kate was able to achieve here.  The songs are dominated by Kate's piano, some wonderfully evocative fretless bass work, and complex drums lines which were either programmed on Fairlight or handled by Kate's regular drummer Stuart Elliot.<br />If Never for Ever started off fairly light in texture it definitely became bruise purple with the nuclear apocalypse of Breathing.  The Dreaming takes that inkling and turns it pitch black.  Although it has become cliche to dub it so, this is Kate's &quot;Mad Album&quot;.  Sorry, Kate ;).  Anyways this album is amazing and definitely up with Never for Ever if slightly below for it's rather dark uniformity in mood. <br />My personal favorites are: Sat in Your Lap, There Goes A Tenner, Get Out of My House, Sus...oh what the heck, I LOVE THEM ALL!!)
B00006JL1Z|4.0|No one can deny that the most successful years of Fleetwood Mac started with the 1975 addition of Nicks and Buckingham.  But fans should still be reminded that FM goes a lot farther back than that with some really great stuff that is getting ignored.  Check out the original version of &quot;Black Magic Woman&quot; by Peter Green, &quot;Bare Trees&quot; by Danny Kirwan, and &quot;Hypnotized&quot; by Bob Welch and then tell me that this album has all of their &quot;Very Best!&quot;  I'd like to see a &quot;Best of FM Pre-1975&quot; album someday.
B000066NW0|2.0|she gets a bonus star for some pretty nice extra multimedia content included on the CD.  but the music is remarkably ordinary and bland - if you've heard Complicated and Sk8er, you've heard everything on the album.  every song is slow start, then a fast, pseudo-exciting tempo switch coupled with some screaming by avril, then devolves into a repetitive, bland chorus.
B000050XEI|4.0|This CD sounds exactly the same as all of her other CDs.  It is a hard rocking collection of depressing ditties.  While some people dismiss her work as Mongolian Punk Rock, I think this is the future of music as we know it.  Fortunately, this music's real depth is in the lack of emotion behind the techno melodies.
B00005O5CM|2.0|are you really going to watch this movie over and over again?  i'm not sure it's worth 20 bucks to own it...
B000002BHE|3.0|Celine's first North American release was a collection of songs about the rock 'n roll life style with a mild blend of blues, fusion, and polka.<br />Who could argue that Celine would not be a singer to remember? During the 70's, rock bands like Heart, Peter Frampton and The Bee Gees ruled the air waves and to have a rowdy female for the 21st Century who sings songs about sinking ships, who wouldn't notice?<br />Anyway the album is a boring classic!
B00006AG5N|5.0|This is one great CD!  It includes so many of his very best songs. TEDDY BEAR is my all-time favorite plus my favorite Elvis gospel number, CRYING IN THE CHAPEL, is also included.  <BR>Personally, I can live without JAILHOUSE ROCK and HEARTBREAK HOTEL.....would have preferred their B sides. But, after all, this is a Greatest Hits package and both were big #1 songs.<BR>This CD is a must for all who love ELVIS, the greatest singer of the 20th Century!
B000069HKH|2.0|When 20 year old Bruce managed to forward a demo tape to Peter Noone of &quot;Herman's Hermits&quot; in London, I doubt either of them knew where it would lead. From the haunting memento of his experience in Brisbane Psychiatric Hospital, the album gives a blueprint of the easy, poignant style Bruce is famous for.
6305358613|3.0|Cate Blanchett is fantastic as the magnificent Queen Elizabeth although historians may disagree!!<br />Wonderful acting especially Geoffrey Rush as Sir Francis Walsingham.<br />Personally I would have rather seen an epic film based on the reign of Elizabeth rather than a love story that probably never happened, however I wasn't disappointed.<br />Summary:  Nice film, great ending.
B000065V42|5.0|I just got the DVD after waiting years and was totally bummed when I opened it and it was in &quot;Pan &amp; Scan&quot;....<br />If it were not such a great movie we never would have bought it.  Why wouldn't Disney just offer a dual format like everyone else?
B000068TPN|3.0|It takes alot more than this to make a classic movie... It takes alot more than realistic war action to make a classic movie. First, it can't be made by formula, the formula of so many, like Pearl Harbor for example. Classic, great movies take something much much more. Second, it can't have the \\"dumbed down\\" cheesy scenes for the first 45 minutes or so, the scenes so stupid and \\"spoon fed\\" to the audience...   The bottom line is, movie making is a business. That extra box office money this business needs is why this movie is so dumbed down and really an insult to any intelligent movie fan.
6305308659|5.0|The value of this masterful film is how it vividly portrays the transition those in the 50's made to their mindsets in adjusting to the exciting new culture emerging. The time of the 50's was a pivotal time in American culture.  This film captures the essence of that time period and how people in the 50's began to open up to new ideas and lifestyles, some more than others.  Pleasantville is one of the best movies I've ever seen.  Its value is enormous in how it shows the exciting transition people made to a new time period and culture.
B00003CX9Q|5.0|5 stars for one of the greatest movies of all time, and another 5 stars for Mr Spielberg for stepping up and making sure we get our 1982 version included in this without the fans having to shell out double the price. Always repect for Steven and now even more!!
B000001G1E|5.0|James Brown is the man! No one can ever be funkier than this brotha! This amazing box set gives you the key to a bottomless vault of irresistable funk. Including the most recognizable hits like Sex Machine, I Got You (I Feel Good), Mother Popcorn and all those other bangers as well as quite a few that were not as popular but still equally funky, this 4 disc set is absolutely the best thing a JB fan can get. OW!
0871294273|5.0|This book is about a Hobbit named Bilbo Baggings who is a gental ceature. Gandalf, a wizard, meets him one day to send him on a adventure with 13 dwarves. Bilbo is 14th to be lucky. Togather the 14 of them go through many adventures togather; to find the treasure of Thrain. This is one of my favorite books that I have ever read, It is packed full with adventure and fantisy which makes it interesting to read when you combine these togather. I hope you can find the time to read The Hobbit and find out what happens to Bilbo next.
B000002JPA|2.0|Don't become confident because you just began hearing \\"A Change of Seasons\\", and think that Dream Theater are geniuses.  You don't want to end up in the situation I was in, paying $20.00 for the \\"Images And Words\\" album, and was not worth it.  <br />You've got a mixture of Metallica, and a couple of good ballads and that's it.  Dream Theater seemed to step off balance with this one, ultimately due to constant screaming, and excessive instrument playing.  This is just complete \\"noise\\" to me, because hearing instruments playing (quitars, bass, drums, piano) for a combined 15 minutes I suppose, is uncalled for.  <br />The only songs on here that are ok is 'Surrounded', and 'Wait For Sleep'; they seem to have some definition added to it.  The rest is all boring, mostly filled with screaming, and that's what makes this cd the most irritating.  <br />Get 'A Change of Seasons': there you have more quality, and not all the agitating vocal effects and annoying instruments playing.

0375414053|5.0|One of the best books to describe the ambivalence of the working mom. I laughed and cried and hurt for me, my kids and husband, and all of my friends. The truth is none of us can have it all. It is obvious as you read this book that Allison Pearson has been there, done that. I highly recommend it for both working and stay-at-homes moms. Well worth the $$.

B000068QVN|2.0|I liked everything starting with \\"Inside Looking Out\\" (song 8) to the end of the CD.<br />But the \\"I'm your captain\\" medley everyone else raves about is the worst version of this great classic to ever see the light of the laser!  They sound completely burned out on playing this medley.  ALL songs from hea Staadium \\"suffer\\" - surely there are some better renditions out there _somewhere_...<br />... The 1975 Live CD or the 1999 \\"Bosnia\\" CD are MUCH more listenable.

B00005N919|5.0|... Basic Instinct remains one of my favorite movies of all times. It's not only about the plot. It's the style. The acting. The cinematography. ... Sharon has never been better so far, Michael Douglas says it itself, Jennie Tripplehorn is a nice discovery. And that ice-pick...<BR>    As far as the DVD is concerned, this movie couldn't have been treated better. Experience the remastered video and, if you're as lucky as to have a good audio system, hear the waves crashing against the cliff as Catherine and Nick first meet. The extra features are unbelievable. The audio commentaries join you through the entire movie feature (Paglia's the best one!. The making of is rather interesting and two thumbs up for the comparison between the tv version and the theatrical version ( never experienced something funnier!) and that between the storyboard and the actual scene. Add to this a theatrical trailer and a teaser, the usual production notes and the cast and crew information and a photo gallery - and now tell me this isn't worth it!!!!<BR>PS: one more good reason. Click on the ice picks in the various menus, and see what happens...
B000024D4R|5.0|Dogs is the greatest song ever made. David Gilmour is a brilliant guitarist. Pink Floyd is incredible, and DOGS is musical perfection.
B0000024K1|5.0|We've all heard the story; Public Enemy's 1988 classic It Takes A Nation Of Millions To Hold Us Back is the greatest rap album of all time. This title may not be fully appliable following the mind-blowing lyrical dexterity of '90s' rap albums such as the Notorious BIG's Ready To Die, 2Pac's All Eyez On Me and Eminem's The Slim Shady LP, but PE's second album was by far the greatest thing ever to come out of the hip-hop scene at the time; hip-hop had been alive for over a decade and nothing like this had even been heard of. It was the kind of album most acts couldn't even dream of creating - it was just too new and revolutionary. Possibly the only truly great and innovative rap album preceding this was Run-D.M.C.'s old-school epitomy Raising Hell. But Nation of Millions was where rap was truly changed forever. Since this album came out in 88, rap has never turned back; thanks to this album rap is now respectable, powerful, clever and political, whether subtly or outwardly so. Nation of Millions just came out of nowhere and transformed the rap game for good. It's opener, Bring The Noise is a nerve-shredding piece which thunders along at a hundred miles per hour, with Chuck D spewing out rhymes like thunder. Don't Believe The Hype continues on the same powerful and rallying theme, but it is not just a lazy continuation. Almost every single track has a totally different sound from everything else. It will leave you fully agreeing with everything Chuck argues for on the album, with the music eating away so fast that it quotes itself by the end. Remarkable and the undoubted best rap album of the 1980s. And since, there has been little to match it. Key Tracks: Bring The Noise, She Watch Channel Zero?!, Black Steel In The Hour Of Chaos.
6304240554|5.0|IS A GREAT MOVIE, I SEE THIS MOVIE FIRST TIME, WHEN 13 YEARS OLD, AND GEORGE ROMERO IS A TERRORIFIC DIRECTOR, THE SPECIAL EFFECTS FOR HIS TIME (1979) IS AMAZING, CONGRATULATIONS GEORGE ROMERO YOUR MINT IS VERY SICK, OF COURSE FOR THIS MOVIE.
B00000JCB2|3.0|1999's Significant Other from Limp Bizkit was often overlooked; a smart, bouncing album with an almost perfect mix between heavy metal and rap, even with some melodic pieces, and an appeal to audiences both black and white, young and old. The commercially successful Nookie was a pretty dumb piece: \\"I did it all for the nookie, so you can take that cookie/And stick it up yo...\\" Working better is single Break Stuff, with a grinding heavy metal guitar driving Fred's angry but still fun lyrics which explodes into a climax where Durst blurts, \\"I might just break yo ... face tonight!!\\" The best thing on the album, though, comes with Re-Arranged, a summery ballad with a bittersweet theme leaving the listener feeling bruised but elated. Ditto Don't Go Off Wondering, a heart-breaking and oft-overlooked track. On the hip-hop side of things, there is a very accomplished duet with the Wu Tang Clan, the famous N 2 Together Now. There is a lot of weak material, of course; throwaways such as Trust and Show Me What You've Got, but that's as can be expected from the group who went on to make the terrible Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water...
B00006690G|5.0|I never thought I'd like Eminem, but this CD changed my mind.  I love it!  The rhythm, the emotion behind the lyrics, even the lyrics themselves, complete with expletives, just blew me away. Eminem bares his soul in every song, and by doing so, creates a tour de force.<br />\\"Cleanin' Out My Closet\\" is one of the most heartbreaking songs I've ever listened to. You can hear Eminem's anguish in the line to his mother \\"I never meant to hurt you.\\" \\"Halie's Song\\" is surprisingly tender, a great song that still has the artist's distinctive stamp. \\"White America\\" makes for biting social commentary, and the often-played \\"Without Me\\" is hilarious. Eminem has constructed a diverse CD that is never boring.  Buy it - you won't regret it.
B00006ADFL|3.0|I never...and I mean never thought that I would be giving this movie 3 stars.  To begin with the movie itself in it's original version is 5 stars.  The 3 stars refer to this version only.  If you have never seen this movie before, please see an older version first before viewing this one.  This review is intended for those who have seen the film before, but have yet to see the extended version.<br />As mentioned before in another review the added and extended scenes aren't more vulgar, intense, or grotesque.  This is not the problem.  The major problems are that there is an extensive overhaul dealing with the imaginary fantasy element.  This tends to drag the movie down (which in my oppinion was already a tad long in the original version) and may lose focus on the real world elements that are forcing their will upon Juliet and Pauline. <br />The extended dialogue is 'okay' for the most part, some of it could have (should have) been left out.<br />Another complaint is certain added shots move the girls' close relationship from questionable to be almost certain about their sexuality.  The debate over whether they were gay or not is almost certainly non-existent in this movie, since the homosexual undertones are much stronger.  There isn't anything wrong with that (I'm not trying to bash anyones sexual preferance), but part of the fun with this film is analysing it and debating whether or not they were or weren't.  In the original version you could argue either way.  In this one there's a little more evidence to the \\"they are\\" side.  <br />But perhaps the second most thing that really bothered me about the film was the sub-story between Juliet's mother and father.  Very obscured in the original version, until Juliet's entrance in the bedroom and finding out her parents \\"arrangement\\".  It floored me the first time I saw it and made me really feel for Juliet.  This version you see it a mile away, so the impact isn't there at all.  Very disappointing.  <br />But last is how the very end sequence is handled.  In the original version Pauline screams as the \\"theoritical boat sails without her\\" and then it cuts to black and there's one last blood curdling scream.  OUTSTANDING.  The perfect ending, made my skin crawl.  This version unfortunately felt it necessary to give us a quick fuzzy (probably from a bad print) shot of Pauline covered in blood screaming in color.  Very ackward shot- to the point of almost a jump cut.  <br />Boooh!  I say bring back the Criterion Heavenly Creature's Laser Disc!  <BR>Boooooh!  Miramax.  Booooh!
B000065V9P|5.0|The passage of time of has shown this CD to be one of Gabriels best.  While adorned with a complex soundscape this album is full of the right melodies to support the heavy material that is at the CDs core.  Yes, the predominant focus on hurt, marital infidelity and pain can be difficult and could seem self absorbed, as many professional reviewers of the disc apparently felt.  What they fail to understand is the the music, melodies and rhythm are completely in tune with and support the themes.<br />I picked the CD up again in anticipation of seeing Gabriel on his upcoming tour and found that the music had matured and deepened on subsequent listenings.  I hope you enjoy.<br />Peter
B00006JL1Z|4.0|A great album but I would like to hear the early Mac tunes of Peter Green and Bob Welch. I have not found any compilation that contains these songs.
B000002KHF|5.0|Moondance is an essential album to own if you have ever found yourself humming or singing along to songs like &quot;Moondance&quot;, &quot;Into The Mystic&quot;, &quot;And It Stoned Me&quot; or any of the other Van Morrison classics. Great songwriting, musicianship, and &quot;feel&quot; are present throughout Moondance. You will be satisfied with the entire album.
B00003CXCS|5.0|The Sound of Music is, without a question in anyone's mind, the greatest musical ever made. It is the supreme ruler of the musicals, and all other musicals are its infants. Although many people today find this sort of sentimental, romantic, even LONG musical outdated and boring, and contest whether there are greater musicals, there are many good reasons why The Sound Of Music remains number one. First of all, it was the film that made a star out of Julie Andrews (she does an even better performance as Maria von Trapp than she does as Mary Poppins), 2: It was the 60's when this film was made, a pivotal decade, and a time for such heartwarming, romantic musicals to ease the stress-filled and changing world, and 3: It's unforgettable. From the opening scene in which a spirited Julie Andrews runs across the Austrian hills that overlook the Alps and sings \\"The Hills Are Alive\\", we are taken directly into the sweeping tale. Based on an actual event, that of the von Trapp family singers who fled Nazi Germany  during WWII, the story is essentially about an irrepressible, influential and loveable governess, Maria von Trapp, formerly a nun at a convent, who touches the lives of a naval captain (Christopher Plummer) and his seven children. The songs are catchy and memorable- \\"My Favorite Things,\\" \\"Do-Re-Mi\\", \\"I am Sixteen going on Seventeen\\", etc. The romantic chemistry between Plummer and Andrews, the pseudo romance between the Captain's eldest daughter and the young mailman who later turns Nazi. This is a perfect family film, as well as a romantic film for a couple. I fell in love with musicals just from watching this film. Five stars well deserved and on DVD, the experience of the Sound of Music has never been greater.
B00006HBUA|5.0|This was such a great movie I saw it three times in the theaters and am buying it right now! It's a great family film, but it's really enjoyable for teens and older people too. The casting is perfect, and it has great special effects. The plot's unusual but still really cool. This is a movie that is really  worth getting!
6304712944|5.0|The Lerner and Lowe musical seems to be a variation from the T.H. Lawrence novel, &quot;The Once and Future King,&quot; from which the animated Dysney film was taken. Richard Harris, Vanessa Redgrave and Franco Nero effectively carry out the movie, their voices superb in every song and their dramatic performances making an excellent and enjoyable film. The story is the age-old Arthur myth. King Arthur, the idealist, tutored by his all-knowing wizard Merlin, creates Camelot, a peaceful realm supported by the mighty Round Table, whose aim is &quot;Might for Right&quot;. But things begin to fall apart for Arthur and his dream. Guenevere, whose marriage to Arthur had all been arranged, falls for the dashing French-born champion Knight, Lancelot. Their affair sparks the suspicion of Mordred who reveals it to the public, just when it was ending (the parting scene between Guenevere and Lancelot..&quot;And I shall never come to you again&quot; and their duet is very emotional and heartrendering). As we know, Mordred and Arthur battle, the Round Table is dissolved and Camelot becomes a dream remembered. This musical was appropriate to its milieu. It was the 60's when this film was made, and peace rallies were manifested over America. The idealism of peace and brotherly harmony (as in the Round Table) is effectively similar to the idealism of American government. The allegory of the musical is quite transparent. I hope you give this musical a chance, and it has a special place in my heart. Along with The Sound of Music and The King and I, this musical stands out in the great tradition. Five stars well deserved. Songs that stand out in this musical are &quot;I wonder what the King is doing tonight&quot; &quot;Where are the Sweet Joys of Maidenhood ?&quot;, &quot;Camelot&quot; &quot;How to handle a woman&quot; and &quot;If I ever Would Leave You.&quot;
B000000WHX|5.0|First advice, if you don't know MASSIVE ATTACK, you should try to listen one or two of their songs to check if you like this style of music. If you know that it's the case, you can buy that CD with your eyes closed ! All the tracks are awesome, \\"BLUE LINES\\" is always original but never annoying... \\"unfinished sympathy\\" and \\"Hymn of the big wheel\\" are, for me, among the best songs ever in the style...<BR>Second advice, you should pay attention to another great CD in the style of that one : AFTERLIFE \\"SIMPLICITY\\". you won't be desappointed...
B00005MAM2|4.0|Rating this movie was no easy task for me. The animation is one side of it, the story is another. As for the animation, the motorcycle chase at the beginning was breathtaking. And as one watches this movie, one can't help but realize that this movie probably influenced Final Fantasy 7 and (according to my friend) Full Throttle. <br /> There is lots of other eye-candy throughout the movie--helicopter blades spinning faster and faster, LOTS of explosions and debris. There is a scene that involves a killer Teddy Bear, Rabbit, and Toy Car that is very, uh, weird, but extremely entertaining. And, of course, the very end of the movie. If you like action, you'll see PLENTY of it. <br /> The story started out good, but once Tetsuo starts going crazy, the story does the same. Dozens of questions rise in your mind. What is going on? But, hey, it looks good, so you keep watching it. When I got to the end, my eyes widened at some of the grande finale visuals, but at the same time my eyebrows raised a hair more as my mind tried to figure out what had gone on. <br /> Like I mentioned earlier, Akira probably influenced Final Fantasy 7. In fact, I couldn't help but say to myself, &quot;Hmm, Akira would make one heck of a video game.&quot; Just take a look at these parallels: Akira = JENOVA, both have motorcycle chases in dark, large, banged-up super-cities and the SOL spaceship reminded me of the one in Final Fantasy The Spirits Within. <br /> Even if you're new to anime like I am, this movie is definitely worth at least a rental. And when you consider that they took a 1,300+ page graphic novel and condensed it into 2 hours, they really did a pretty good job.
B000001DQI|5.0|THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST DOUBLE ALBUMS EVER PUT OUT. THE WRITING AND MUSIC ARE AND ALWAYS HAVE BEEN VERY HARD TO DUPLICATE. THANK GOD FOR THE PROBLEMS THEY HAD IN JAMICA OR THIS ALBUM WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN MADE. OR AT LEAST THE ALUBUM I LOVE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN. IF YOU HAVE NEVER HEARD THIS ALBUM YOU SHOULD.
B00005JKG7|4.0|I remember the release of John Carpenter's \\"The Fog\\" back in 1980. The expectations were so high for this film after the stunning box office/critical success of his now-legendary \\"Halloween.\\" I recall, somewhat hazily, of critics being disappointed and the film performing below expectations financially. But I remembered thinking after seeing the movie that in many ways it was superior to \\"Halloween.\\" Today, \\"The Fog\\" has a nice cult following and deservedly so. It is an old-fashioned ghost story with extraordinary atmosphere. It is blessed with a cast of veterans including Hal Holbrook, Janet Leigh and John Houseman. And it contains one of Carpenter's finest musical scores (as good, if not better than his peak work on \\"Halloween\\" and \\"Escape From New York\\"). <br />The coastal town of Antonio Bay is celebrating its centennial, but a dark secret is discovered about the town's historic origins. An eerie fog soon rolls in and within its glowing depths are ghosts bent on revenge. Carpenter regulars Adrienne Barbeau, Jamie Lee Curtis, Tom Atkins and Nancy Loomis eventually are fighting for their lives, with the final confrontation taking place within the confines of a historic church.<br />The word \\"creepy\\" comes to mind often when discussing \\"The Fog.\\" The opening scene, taking place around a campfire, will send chills up your spine. The isolation of Barbeau's lighthouse/radio station is a near-brilliant location. The multiple H. P. Lovecraft touches including hidden diaries with terrifying secrets are great set-ups. The eyeless dead body rising from the stretcher is a perfectly directed scene. The gold coin turning into a piece of ship wreckage is a nice touch. And the ghosts, complete with moldy clothes and clanking swords, red eyes staring through the green fog, are about as nightmarish a portrait as one could imagine.<br />I have some problems with several of the characters in \\"The Fog,\\" most notably that of Jamie Lee Curtis. Hers is essentially a throwaway role, seemingly added so that she could co-star with her mother (Janet Leigh). A hitchhiker in the wrong place at the wrong time, she ends up in bed with Tom Atkins about an hour after meeting him. I suppose any good old horror film needs a little sex thrown in for good measure, but it seems rather B-Movie fabricated.<br />But \\"The Fog\\" is a perfect example of John Carpenter at the peak of his once notable creative powers. After suffering through his recent work including \\"Escape From LA\\" and the uninspired \\"Ghost of Mars,\\" I return to this terrific 1980 ghost story. I enjoy the chills with great fondness, like one does when putting on a childhood Halloween mask. This will always be one of my favorite Carpenter films, a better tradition for Halloween in many ways, than the film \\"Halloween\\" itself.
B000068IEU|3.0|The Last House on the Left fell horribly short.  Lines are awkward, acting terrible, and the plot was that of a third grader.  . This movie is not scarey, not explicit or even half GOOD!  I would have given it less stars but factoring in that it was Wes Cravens first movie and filmed in the early seventies it was probably scarey and horrible to audiences.
B00005R1N3|2.0|Listen here goes, Black Christmas is without a doubt a landmark movie, after seeing it u will realize how many movies including Halloween copied it. My major downfall with this film is that it is way to slow,,I mean real slow, I do not think it is a top-notch horror flick, and I despise these new genre of horror/comedy films like Scream,etc... I do think I need to watch it again and then maybe my review will be different. It does have some scary parts but I just thought the killing of the women could be more of the focus in the movie, way to much soap opera like B.S.,,,,check it out ur self..u decide.
B00005K9LN|5.0|I've had an love affair with this album from my high school days and still do 20+ years after!! Classic tunes like &quot;Breaking the Law&quot; and &quot;Living After Midnight&quot; but my personal favorite is &quot;Steeler&quot;. It is so uplifting I can't help but stand up and move up and down as if it was being played live! Must have for classic heavy metal music fans!
B000069AUI|5.0|I have to say this is the first band in many years that is truly exciting.  Every song is great and the band reaches an epiphany with &quot;The Scientist&quot; and &quot;Clocks&quot;. Their first album, &quot;Parachutes&quot;, had multiple moods and textures and was great, but this album has more of an &quot;album&quot; feel.  The piano and guitar interplay is awesome.  The sign of a true masterpiece is that you can come back to it again and again and take something new from it.  This should rank in the top 10 of anybody's record collection and that, of course, is faint praise.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I don't normally really read music reviews, and although it seems many people love this album, I don't really care much about the popular opinion. With that said, I can now state that this is the most amazing album I have ever heard. <br />To me, OK Computer is an utterly human story on an epic personal scale. It is a story that begins with death. Obliteration. Utter destruction. And it is the tale of rebirth -- the journey through every agonizing emotion from horror to terror to abandonment to isolation to spite and anger to hope to wonder to joy to peace to ecstatic bliss. <br />One common thread in many of the reviews here is the raw, real emotion that this album has the power to create. If you are in the right place to hear it, you will recognize yourself in this album, and you will see profound truth in the experiences it describes. <br />I agree that it is a difficult listen at first. Took me a year. But if you come to this album seeking an answer it will not disappoint.
0671799320|1.0|I really wanted to learn about the history of oil extraction, and I admit that the book taught me something about that. But I found myself routinely cursing at the author's hypocrisy. When the United States, England, France, or any other empire invades some country to make certain that American or European oil transnationals have access to that nation's oil, the actions of these empires are seen as rational, normal, expected. These empires are seen as acting in their national interest. Yet if any country attempts to keep them out, they are seen as \\"greedy,\\" \\"rapacious,\\" and their leaders are seen as silly or foolish or dangerous (many of Yergin's characterizations of third world leaders are shockingly racist). When the US wants to use any and all means to gain access to oil from the Middle East, well, that's \\"defending\\" national interest.  When the Soviet Union wanted to do the same, well, that was \\"Soviet aggression.\\" (And I'm not suggesting that Soviet aggression would have been any better than US aggression, but merely pointing out the obvious double standard.) He consistently trivializes those of the third world who oppose the despoliation of their land and the theft of their resources. He also consistently trivializes or ignores the massive environmental destruction and social dislocation caused by the oil economy. In search of an informative history, I found a propaganda tract for the oil industry and for the nations that provide the muscle for them.
B000002JR8|5.0|god dam* will they ever make a cd that doesnt kick as*
0316666343|4.0|I am a definate believer in the afterlife.  So this appealed to me.  I was curious to see what it was all about.<br />I was alittle &quot;spooked&quot; for the first two chapters- as I have a fourteen year old girl and it was alittle disconcerting for me to read how the character died.  After I got past that part the book was excellent.  Very interesting concept on how she views her &quot;new world&quot; and her old with memories that keep coming back in to her memory of her life on earth.<br />I do recommend this to people, but my recommendation is to not read the first chapters right before bed!!  I just couldn't &quot;turn it off&quot; before sleeping.<br />EMW
B00006J3WH|5.0|I was blown away! Of course I found the lyrics just as fast, and more wow! The way that Joss made the ep be a part of the ongoing story of season six is just fantastic.<PThe clean versions of the songs without all the background noises, the battles, and the few spoken lines, doesn't make it worse, just different. >Sarah Michelle Gellar sings exactly like she speaks, a steady clean voice that hits the right keys so accurately that you'd think she's afraid to even try variations. >That the soundtrack includes some of Chris Beck's original score has left me with a craving for more of his music. WOW! Now I wish they'd release a Buffy Original Soundtrack album someday. If you want feeling, this is your album!
0380977788|2.0|Gaiman is up to his usual tricks in \\"Coraline\\": children more grown-up than grown-ups, his typical moral-- Adults lose their ability to \\"imagine things\\" (all adults except Gaiman of course), scary eye gimmicks (see the Corinthian in Sandman)and cliche dressed up in Gaiman's mannered prose (see the \\"what it takes to be brave\\" cliche in Coraline, all of \\"Stardust\\".)<BR>    Perhaps I have just read too much of Gaiman's material to find this book entertaining or original. I had the same problem with \\"American Gods\\" which retreads the same anthropological theories and concepts that seemed so fresh in the Sandman series (at least I bothered to finish Coraline). <BR>    Another problem with this book is that it is supposed to be for children, but, like \\"The boy who swapped his Father for two Goldfish\\", it is really aimed at Gaiman's established fan base who no doubt find some comfort in his predictable style and concerns. I added this book to my classroom collection (yes, I know-- those who can't teach) and it has remained untouched by my group of 13 year olds.<BR>    I wasn't disappointed by Coraline; I knew what I would be getting-- but that's the problem; an author as talented as Gaiman should really try something different. The greatest joy of his comic book work was that it often managed to transcend genre, especially in works like \\"Violent Cases\\" and \\"Mr Punch\\" and even in the fantasy driven Sandman series. His novels just recycle in prose ground he has already covered in comics.<BR>    The worst thing about my Coraline purchase is that it is unillustrated and although style wise Dave McKean is in the same rut Gaiman is, his art is always interesting. Gaiman's isn't.

0800141660|5.0|Britain is possibly unique in that our world-renowned dramatic talent is, on occasion, actually less gifted than our apparent  &quot;second string&quot; company.  A fact which this production illustrates to perfection.<br />The script for &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; is the work of Emma Thompson (who also plays Elinor Dashwood), better known world-wide as Mrs Kenneth Brannagh, yet proving here that her own talents are easily the equal of her husband's.<br />Likewise seemingly supporting, but actually key roles, are filled by by Elisabeth Spriggs (Mrs Jennings) and Robert Hardy (Sir John Middleton), two players who, though not well-known to the world at large, have been the making of more productions than I've had hot dinners.<br />Taken at face value, the work of Jane Austen is little more than a historical version of Danielle Steele.  When it is the focus of a galaxy of such genuine talent as is collected here, however, it becomes far, far more - a genuine work of genius that transcends time and becomes not simply a piece of quaint English history but a tale that has something worthwhile - and entertaining - to say at any point in time.<br />You *may* find productions that equal this version of &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; in its chosen field, but you'll find VERY FEW that do any better.<br />HIGHLY recommended.
B000063DHL|5.0|I just recently heard wasted years, and i had to buy this cd. I'm now a huge Iron Maiden fan. Since then, I have also bought number of the beast (another great Iron Maiden cd). Iron Maiden is definately one of the best heavy metal bands out there, along with Metallica, Black Sabbath, Guns n' Roses, etc. So if you're a fan of any of the bands I just mentioned. BUY THIS CD!
B00005JL96|1.0|Oh wow. Where to start?  It's like Wack-A-Mole at Chucky Cheese.  So many moles, so few mallets.  This movie is singularly the most cruel movie I've seen in the past dozen years.  It's Animal Farm with a bad Hawaiian soundtrack and no sense of humor. It's so bad, I have to talk in broken sentences, like a punch-drunk boxer who lost the last round on a technicality.  Wait - I am getting a sense of how the story-board at Disney went!! Happy-go-lucky, destructive beastie does not fit in to society.  Moons government authority figure.  Audience giggles, nods in understanding that he must be banished.  Can't be productive member of higher society.  Only an evil scientist likes it. Stitch is only redeemed when he learns to appreciate family, and get along with everybody else. Children taught valuable lesson about what happens when authority figures go unheeded. Estrangement, banishment, righteous indignation - Bad musical interludes will be your fate if you do not find your right place in Society. See, everybody really wants to \\"be like folks\\", right? We all wanna be the SAME, don't we?  We wanna FIT IN and FIND OUR PLACE in the world. Oh sure, Stitch can be crazy and wacky and creatively independant (for the first half of his life), but when it gets right down to it, he's a sorry, needy squid like the rest of the modern world.  Stitch is on his knees begging for Family before the One-Hour mark in the movie, spittling the movie's theme line just in CASE you missed the point when it was said for the previous 87 times.  Ohana means Family.  Of course, it's not really about family - it's about conformity (maybe that's what family is about these days, too - who knows?).  It's about finding a group and blending in.  Disney tells us about freedom - the freedom to be like everyone else or be excoriated.  Excuse me, but I'd rather cozy up to \\"Dude Where's My Car\\" while being pelted with rocks than ever have to subject myself to this trite, insidious piece of propaganda again.  IfI wanted trashy propaganda, I'd watch Triumph of the Will - at least then the fascists would be easily spotted.  Today, they apparently sometimes have mouse ears and cute fuzzy voices.
B000002KDO|4.0|master of reality was the first black sabbath with ozzy that I heard (on vinyl in the early 80s). i had previously digested black sabbath with dio and really liked it. <br />i loved master of reality from the very start. but over time, i grew to like sbs and sabotage much more. the music here is dull and one-dimensional. the riffs are gloomy and uninspiring (compare it to wheels of confusion on volume 4). i'll get a kick out of sweet leaf from time to time, but children of the grave, lord of this world, etc. are silly, stupid songs. why this is a double platinum seller i will never know.<br />then again, heavy metal bands like metallica sound exactly like the \\"master of reality\\" sound. its just rehashed black sabbath, circa 1971. so the album has tremendous influence, that's why i rate it a four, not three. it is a classic, but i prefer the later sabbath albums (ie. sbs and sabotage, the latter being my favourite).
B000000Y1H|5.0|Thelonious Monk had a reputation for eccentricity-his stle of piano playing was originally thought of clumsy and unmusical-but on this album his genius is proved.  With a great line up of other jazz musicians-the great drummer Max Roach, holding it all together with impeccable musicianship, and doubling on timpani in the final track, Bemsha Swing; bassists Oscar Pettiford and Paul Chambers, who did outstanding work on the Miles  Davis classic, Kind of Blue; Ernie Henry, on alto sax, and the legendary tenor saxophonist Sonny Rollins, who does some amazing playing on the title track.  Then of course there is  Monk-whether doubling on piano and celesta in the 'ballad with guts'  Pannonica, or soloing in I surrender, dear, he is a revalation.  His compositions have a quirk originality all of their own, and make compelling listening, especailly when so brilliantly played.  The supremely difficult title track comes off marvelously, as does the following blues number-my favourite has to be Pannonica though, it's gorgeous-then there's the solo  I mentioned and a great finale in Bemsha Swing, where Clark Terry turns up on trumpet.  I urge you to hear this album!
B00003CX95|4.0|This is a film based on William Wallace who led a revolt against the English in the late 1200s, early 1300s. The film starts out showing Wallace marrying the girl he loves, who he has known since childhood. Some English soldiers kill her, and this sets Wallace off, to begin his quest to overthrow British rule. What follows for the rest of the film is a captivating story, and inspirational battles to gain freedom. The battles are directed amazingly, and are very graphic, and realistic. All the characters, of Wallace, the King, Princess, and members in Wallace's army, are interesting, and drawn out. You back the good guys, and want the bad guys to get what they deserve. The film is just about 3 hours, but the time goes by real fast, and the story is always interesting, never getting boring. If your into historical films, war films, big action romantic films, check this out. Just know the battles can be disturbing for some who do not like to see realistic violence. 4 stars.
B00006SFLV|5.0|I can remember the first UK run of My So Called Life and it being the first show that I ever really got hooked on. Then 3 episodes in I heard that the network had pulled the plug and they hadn't even finished the series. It should have run for 21 episodes rather than the 19, I think, but I'm not sure. Clare Danes is an amazing actress and all the supporting cast are fantastic too. This is as close as it gets to how mid-to-latter years of teenage life is and possibly something anyone planning to be (or is already) a parent should watch, just to remember.
B00006DEFA|5.0|OK, so I'm biased--I'm a Mozart freak. But as we all know, the movie isn't about Mozart, it's about a man who wanted to be God's beloved (thus, the title \\"Amadeus\\") but was spurned by God, or so he felt.<BR>I call the original release a clean version. All the elements in the story are there and perfectly placed. Director's Cut has more details but is not necessarily better. Salieri looks more villainous, Mozart, more pitiful. However, I find one added scene brilliant. In the scene where Constanze undresses in front of Salieri, we hear \\"Qui Tollis\\" from K.427, Mass in C Minor. \\"Qui tollis peccata mundi (Thou who taketh away the sins of the world)\\" is sadly appropriate a verse for both characters. It is also a known fact that Mozart wrote this mass with Constanze's soprano in mind. Of course, this nude scene is pure fiction, but I find the use of this music wickedly delicious.<BR>\\"Making of Amadeus\\" was a great added bonus. I especially enjoyed two separate interviews of F. Murray Abraham and Tom Hulce in which they talk about the dictation scene in the movie. It's like \\"Rashomon\\" American style.
B000001A3H|5.0|I first heard about Kyuss while reading an interview with Glenn Danzig back in the early '90's.  Danzig counted Kyuss as one of his favorite bands which immediately sent me to the store to find and buy a Kyuss album.  I was not disappointed.  While I cannot recommend any Kyuss albums before or since &quot;Blues..&quot;, I can definately say this album is without a doubt one of the best albums I have ever heard, period.  If you have never heard of Kyuss, you are in the majority.  But the majority is often cheated by the radio and music industry.  Don't let them deprive you of this gift any longer.
0385503954|5.0|It's not just the time period of this novel (the years just before and into WWII) that feels removed from today. There's something about the writing style itself in the first section that's not-quite-contemporary. It's a little more formal, a little more English, a little more innocent. It sets up a beautiful contrast to the total end to innocence that comes next, as personal lives are shattered against a backdrop of a world torn apart by war.<br />This is a book about a crime and its effect on the lives of all involved (no secrets given away there, as it says that much right on the dust jacket). Yet it's not a crime story. The details of the crime and its immediate effects are mercifully absent. I turned the page to the next section after this crime with real dread. What could come next but the excrutiating details of confrontation, interrogation, trial, and the horrors of punishment, none of which I could stand to read about?<br />That's where this novel is different. McEwan knows you've read that book a hundred times, so he doesn't bother to re-write it. Instead he picks up years down the road, with the trial and punishment already accomplished facts. The crime remains inescapable and binds everything together, but it's far from the only fact of life. After all, there's a war going on. McEwan brings all that together to create fully-realized characters with their own stories and real psychological depth--they are, as Briony says, &quot;separate minds, as alive as [one's] own.&quot;<br />Oh no, you groan. A literary novel? A psychological novel? But I like books with plot and a gripping story!<br />Not to worry--McEwan manages to do it all. Part II, which focuses on soldiers in the war, is a particularly gripping bit of story. <br />I do have a few qualms. For a novel built around a misunderstanding, there are places where the characters are ridiculously over-insightful: &quot;I think Briony saw this and thought that and felt this,&quot; they say--which happens tobe exactly what all the previous pages just got through telling us Briony saw, thought, and felt. And much of the scene towards the end in Cecilia's flat feels canned. But the biggest issue for me is the final &quot;epilogue&quot; chapter. It's an awkward device that I could do without--what light it sheds on the rest of the novel has already been made clear by the end of the previous chapter anyway.<br />Still, none of these are qualms that you won't gladly overlook for the pleasure of reading this wonderful, rich novel.
B00000K19E|1.0|One of the characteristics of bad science fiction is the use of a fundamental premise that is unscientific.  It is one thing to suspend physical laws (e.g., to \\"allow\\" faster-than-light travel to make a story) and another to be ignorant of them.  I refer to the fact that humans do not produce any kind of energy; we, like all organisms, consume energy in endothermic processes.  So, if one were connect a whole bunch of us together in a giant farm, one would get a net energy consumption and a whole bunch of fertilizer.      I am only person I personally know who hated this movie, but the other people I personally know who saw it are children. There are many other things about the film that are unbearable, but I wouldn't expect anyone to want to read any more about it.
B000002MU3|4.0|After the more elaborate, studio-oriented productions of Out of Time (1990) and Automatic For the People (1992), REM knew it was time to tour after an extended hiatus.  To that end, they recorded a Monster (1994).  Upon releases, many long-time fans accused REM of jumping on the lucrative grunge bandwagon.  While Monster is louder and more guitar oriented than REM's previous releases, it isn't REM's attempt at grunge.  Instead, REM combines the the blarring distortion of The Velvet Underground [circa White Light, White Heat (1967)] with the pop sensibilities of glam rockers like New York Dolls.  If anything, Monster is a creative departure from REM's previous albums; something they usually aren't given enough credit for.<br />While Monster isn't as ambitious as REM's best work [Murmur (1983), Document (1987), Automatic for the People (1992)], it is a compelling, enjoyable album.  With such a jarring musical environment, it's not surprising that the vocals seen deliberately obscured.  Beneath the distorted guitars and propulsive rhythm section, Stipe's singing is often distorted to the point of incomprehensibility.  On many tracks, only a few lines are discernable, which is fine because the overall presentation is what is important here.  Appropriately, when words do emerge, most seem related to themes of obsession, sex, and possibly death (while making Monster REM's close friends Kurt Cobain and River Phoenix died).  Despite the potentially bleak themes, REM's keen pop sensibilites (and humor) are never buried.<br />Monster seems a largely forgotten release from REM.  Most ardent fans consider it an artistic compromise (and therefore dismiss is all together) while most others don't pay much attention because it isn't among REM's best albums (to an extent, this is a fair assessment).  While Monster isn't as sublime as Murmur, or as articulate as Document, or emotionally transcendent like Automatic for the People, it is an intense, compelling, and focused release.  It's also the last consistent album the band has made to date.
B00003CX5P|4.0|Almost a great movie, it wasn't Jar Jar, it was Liam Neeson that hurt this film. His portrayal of a moody almost stupid highly trained Jedi blows my mind! What was Lucas thinking? Yes Jedi have human bodies and are therefore subject to the earthly needs, thus they turn to the &quot;Dark Side&quot;, but they are still powerful, but for personal gain, not universal peace and justice for all. Strange character he was! In all fairness he didn't write the part, but I got the feeling he didn't believe in the character.
0060254920|5.0|You say your child acts like a wild thing sometimes? Read this book with him, and see what happens. Max was acting quite wild one day, and got sent to bed without supper. He dreamed (or was it a dream?) that he went to the land of the wild things and became their king. He had a lot of fun there, but missed home, so he came back, and his supper was still warm (I love that line). This is the granddaddy of the modern picture book where kids aren't always good, but Mom loves them anyway. A must-have for your 4-7 year old.
B000067DNC|5.0|Like many others, I wish there were more extras in this set (there's a lot of room on 5 DVDs that just isn't used).   And I would like to catch up with Europe where they are seasons ahead of the US.    But for the price, and to have that many episodes in a little box, I can't complain.    You get what you pay for.
B00005YW4H|4.0|This was an impulse buy after hearing her on NPR. It was really cheap when it was a new release, and at that price I've remained happy with my purchase. I do have lingering doubts, though, if I would have felt the same at normal CD prices.<br />When I put this in my car, I can drive around for days happily listening to it over and over. It really is quite nice, and there are no songs that have me jabbing at the skip button.<br />The problem happens when I take it out of the player. It's entirely too forgettable. I don't just mean that I don't miss it when it's not playing. I mean several times I've had the embarrassing experience of asking what music is playing in a store and finding out it's this CD that I own but didn't recognize!<br />There just isn't a Nora Jones \\"sound.\\" You don't hear a song and say, \\"This sounds like Nora Jones.\\" You say, \\"This sounds like Bonnie Raitt, but no wait, maybe it's... no, it's...\\" She covers a wide range of styles, which I would normally applaud, but she doesn't seem to take ownership of any of them. What comes across is just a performance, and not an individual performer. Nice to listen to while it's playing, but not much left with you when it's over.<br />I do like her, though, and I hear something in both her style and her musical taste that suggests she can be much more than just another pop singer. Personally, I'd like to see her focus more towards the bluesy, country-influenced sounds that her voice seems well-suited for. After all, to have people say you sound too much like Bonnie Raitt is one of the nicer compliments you can get!<br />Bottom line I guess I'd say this is a good CD that delivers more than I would normally expect from a first release--especially at her age--but is still tentative. There is definitely more to her than just her family connections, but I'm still waiting to see how *much* more. I hope that the success of this album gives her the confidence and freedom to produce a second album with a focused style and individual sound, with nothing held back. It's nice to know who influenced her, but now I want to hear who *she* is.
B0000640SA|5.0|I've already reviewed this movie twice, so I'll just mention some themes I have been uncovering in watching this movie and in reading detailed analyses...<br />GRIEF.  For me, this one comes home more than the others, yet is the linchpin for all the others as well.  \\"How can I heal ...if I can't feel ...time?\\" Leonard asks, and I must admit, grief is like that.  You can't feel time.  Which leads to a sense of...<br />PERMANENT DISORIENTATION.  No matter where you are, you're not completely there.  Everything feels disconnected, effects not lining up perfectly with causes.  Leonard states that \\"It's like waking, like you just woke up\\" and it is this disorientation, among other things, that leads to...<br />ALIENATION.  I call this \\"Portable Loneliness,\\" for it goes with you wherever you go.  In a crowd, on a bus, at lunch with a friend, we Gen Xers and so forth feel alone in a crowd, for we have become convinced through existentialist, post-modernist Deconstructionism that nothing holds together and that only the self is truly real and permanent.  This brings us to...<br />SELF-DECEPTION.  We lie to ourselves to be happy, and as Teddy says \\"We all do it!\\"  We want to believe that we are good people and that the people we love are good people.  Leonard wanted to believe that his wife was murdered when she was raped so that he did not have to face the truth that (1) he accidentally killed his own wife, and (2) his wife had become an unbearable person to live with after \\"the incident\\" and tricked him into killing her.  We lie to ourselves.  All of us.<br />This is apparently not much of a Memento review.  ..  I think it's time we explore the themes that Nolan has woven so discreetly behind the films ...themes so unobtrusive that they can be passed over without a second glance.  As much as an over-the-top person like myself might hate to admit it, that is the sign of truly excellent writing...
B000001IPL|5.0|Smash was the first album I ever heard by Offspring, I bought it after a concert in France. And what an album! It starts out strange with the odd intro Time to Relax, but then it moves on to Nitro. And what a fitting name that is for the track. The name of the track(Nitro), is a fitting name for the whole album. It is full of energy and pent up frustration. Those are the some of the ingredients that make up a good punk album. <BR>The album never seems to lose its vitality and energy right from Nitro and untill the closing of Smash.<BR>The album is vital and seems to have alot to tell, although that might get lost in the catchy tunes. This album was the rise of Offspring, after they went on to the equally brilliant album Ixnay on the Hombre. After changing to a major label, it went sadly downhill for Offspring, and they never seemed to find the spirit or good shape they had. Sad, because they were really good, arguably the best band in the punk revival. I am hestitant to use the word \\"sellout\\", but I can't really find anything speaking again for Offspring.
6304233639|4.0|This movie was good but what I don't understand is why can't they have some cities in canada or Australia get destroyed once in a ehile. No matter what disaster movie yous ee its either los Angeles or New York (In this case Washington DC). The only cities that haven't gotten destroyed in America was Paris and Shanghai in Armageddon. So America has technology, Aliens don't know that. They want to destroy earth not America! But if your looking for major disaster seens than this is your movie.
B000068OCS|5.0|Koyaanisqatsi is a film with a number of shots of different environmental and social settings.  This kaleidoscope of moving images creates an endless story with an endless number of notions, however, a recurring theme seems to be disharmony in nature.  The cinematic experience is similar to a visit to the Louvre, and yet it produces a feeling of mass production and discomfort.  The end product can be whatever the audience wants it to be, thus it is art.
B00006HBUA|1.0|What a piece of ...! For those of you who grew up watching the original cartoon as a young child, or, for those of you who spent their teenage years watching the original classic in an altered state of consciousness, this movie is NOT for you!  The dog, I refuse to call it by its more well known name, looked less like a real object than its predecessor, the ten year old Steven Spielberg dinosaur, from the first Jurassic Park.  Is it possible that computers have downgraded since the concept of CGI dinosaurs was created? Hardly.  This movie was made for those under the age of three, namely those too young to watch TV.  I strongly warn you, do to the offensive nature of the material, do not expose yourself, or your poor young child, to this BEEP!
6304211740|1.0|I feel like this movie was made for people who don't want to be bothered with reading the novel.  Every trace of rebellion against gender, race, and class hierarchies is completely eliminated, and the plot is whittled down to an unrealistic love story.  Charlotte Bronte was making a statment against the norm, this movie is shameful in its adherence to it.  If you have any love for the novel, STAY AWAY from this movie.
B000002BPS|5.0|Offspring was on a tough mission: Having to live up to the bestselling Smash. But they somehow succeeded.<BR>Ixnay on the Hombre is not original in any way, but it does posses an energy that will rub off. The simple and powerful riffs, is a sure way to get charged up.<BR>The Offspring as most punkbands address problems in our society, and they do it in an easy to understand way, without the use of fancy words and phrases. The influence from legends Bad Religion is evident on Ixnay on the Hombre, but that can only be positive.<br />As a conclusion I would say that Ixnay on the Hombre is just a notch better than Smash, although not by much. It is also Offsprings best album to date, something they never surpassed. Their next album Americana was a sad example of how brilliance can regress. Sadly changing to a big record label had a bad influence. But let us remember Offspring for what it once was.
B00003CX9Q|5.0|I first saw E.T. back in 1982 (like a LOT of other folks) and thought it was a masterpiece then.<br />Judging from the new enhancements, the 2002 version will be even better (can't wait to see this in Hi-Def)!<br />If you've never seen this movie (my wife has not and is in for a real treat), you gotta get it! Hard to believe that there is anyone that hasn't seen this movie, but I guess there is.<br />If there was ever a &quot;must see&quot; (with apologies to NBC) movie, THIS IS IT! If you never see (or buy) another movie in your life, make this one a part of your collection. It'll be in mine on October 22!
B000069HKH|5.0|All I can say is WOW!  This is one of the best rock cds that I have ever listened to.  The music is so uplifting and some of the songs have such a positive vibe.  It is rare to buy a cd and like every song.  It is hard to say what my favorite songs are because they are all so good.  But I guess I would have to say that I like these the best: &quot;Lonesome Day&quot;, &quot;Empty Sky&quot;, &quot;Worlds Aparts&quot;, &quot;The Rising&quot;, &quot;Mary's Place&quot; and &quot;You're Missing.&quot;
B000001GXI|3.0|The reviewers from Singapore, Mohegan Lake, Austin and Salem are obviously inexperienced opera listeners who listen to only a narrow range of CDs and who lack any sense of tonality. <br />Roberta Peters is obviously technically incompetent to take on the brilliantly and freakishly difficult role of Queen of the Night. She literally sings out of tune. Anyone with musical sense can tell that she is not singing in tune in parts of the coloratura. Her voice simply WON'T DO. Just listen to the Queen of night's first aria. Roberta was excellent at the start (where registers are low) but as the register goes higher, her voice changes and she sings out of tune at certain parts of the coloratura. The second aria is also poorly sung.<br />I suggest to the reviewers from Singapore, Mohegan Lake, Austin and Salem that they listen to Sumi Jo (Solti, Oestman), Lucia Popp (Klemperer) or Christina (Solti). Their ears will be opened.<br />The only reason to acquire this set is Wunderlich's peerless tamino. Wunderlich is really fantastic. If you just want ONE version of Magic Flute, forget this one. It simply won't do.<br />The orchestral playing is wonderful. Bohm's classicaql mastery is evident here. But Bohm is a shade slow. <br />5 stars? No way. A magic flute without a brilliant Queen of the Night just WILL NOT DO.
B000063S6Z|4.0|I have been a fan of Moby since the first time I heard the Porcelin. Wow, what a song....<BR>Well, to me I like the direction Moby takes with this album. Im into diversity, and to me, this has it. My musical tastes span everything from Bt to Ryan Farish...thats diversity?. Well, this is simply a great album to drive to, or whatever. I liked it.
B000002KFJ|5.0|While Paranoid is voted the classic album from Black Sabbath, I consider this the second best if not my very favorite. When I first heard Hole in the Sky and Symptom of the Universe, I immediately loved this album. The later songs definitely do not disappoint. To the mysterious sound of Megalomania to the lighter side of Am I Going Insane, this is a flawless album by one of the most well-known bands in heavy metal. Ozzy's vocals and Tony Iommi's guitar riffs are wonderful, not to mention excellent work by Geezer Butler and Bill Ward as well. My very favorite tracks are: Hole in the Sky, Symptom of the Universe, Megalomania, and The Writ. Definitely buy this for a great piece of 70s heavy metal!
B00006JDVV|1.0|...However this movie [stinks]! It's no good at all, even the huge fan of dragons I went with hated it! The movie might have been good with a little more thought...
0446677450|5.0|As a physician, psychiatrist and internet marketing expert, I often see why people fail financially. The number one reason is because they have disempowering beliefs about money and abundance. They often think it was never meant for them or they could never achieve such success even though they want to. The author clearly demonstrates the VITAL importance of adopting the right psychology. He does this eloquently by comparing his real dad with his &quot;other&quot; dad. I highly recommend this book to those I mentor for their internet marketing business.<BR>Stephen Gilman, M.D. of Loudspectrum.com
B00003CXFG|4.0|For the most part, Pitch Black is your basic sci-fi horror movie.  You've got a group of people who want to survive but are forced to learn how to do so by trial and error.  It's true to the genre, in my opinion.<br />However, what really makes this film stand out is: 1) it doesn't show us the monsters too clearly too early, 2) the stunning photography during the first half of the film (before nightfall), and 3) fantastic character development.  <br />The character development is the most interesting part of the film and I've watched it often just for that.  Vin Diesel is spectacular in his role, as is Radha Mitchell and several others.  The role reversals and character developments and humor make this film very fun.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|This CD started my passion for the Beatles.  I am only 17 years old and yet I feel that I can connect with the messages that are so powerfully displayed within thier songs.  This is a CD that my entire family enjoys, and My parents, who are both long time fans, love to listen to the tracks.  I highly reccomend this album to everyone.  It gives a great overview of the Beatles long career
B00006HBUA|2.0|Although Matthew Lillard did an oscar worthy preformance of shaggy (it's very hard to distingush between him and the cartoon) the rest of the cast was somewhat of a bad casting job. I give them credit they did try...The CGI scooby was fairly good technologically wise, but just not quite the fun cuddly scooby from the cartoon. ...Worth seeing if you are a big scooby fan...
B00001QEE2|2.0|The kids like it, so I guess that's all that matters. But overall, It's not what I would consider a Disney Classic. In fact, It's not very memorable. Get &quot;Monsters,Inc&quot; or &quot;Tarzan&quot; instead. Chances are your kids won't watch it a second or third time.
B00006GFAB|4.0|Yeah - it's another greatest hits collection by KISS even though there's already one out there for every day of the week. Everyone is baggin' on this like it's just a ditch effort to make more money. Sure they'll make money on this but it's NOT the band's choice to put this out -it's THE RECORD COMPANY'S! KISS is no longer with this lable and, as part of their (old) contract, the label gets to do this kind of thing even though the band does NOT want to put out another GH package. Since the label was going to do it anyway - the band put their two cents in (!!) so what if they get more than two cents out of it... KISS always was about makin' money!<br />If you already own this music go listen to your other KISS CDs and stop complaining. If you don't own any KISS CDs then here's an excellent collection for you - turn it up, rock out and forget about the money - yours or theirs. The music is great, that's what really matters...
B000003TAR|5.0|so i bought this CD.o.k lets turn the stereo on.i listen to it about an hour or so. the best CD i ever heard. the thing i like in it the most are the lyrics. even though im from a country that her people dont talk english in thier everyday life(and even prefer to avoid it) i found kurt's lyrics are unique strange and beautyful. its offer some rush(milk it, tourchate) and some quiet(dumb,all apolegies) and some songs that you just love for no reason(all the rest). i like all the songs exept from on and i recommand that nirvana's fans just skip it. Radio friendly shiftter unit. but you cant be perfect, you know im right? right?!
B00006IUL6|1.0|Long drawn out, the pace is that comparable to a turtle. I imagine it could have been good if they would have picked it up a bit. However Robin Williams needs to stick to comedy. He is not the killer type at all, thus his role is fairly unconvincing! <BR>Al Pachino as always mastered the part, to the best of his ability. Hillary Swank was very good, for the first time that I've seen. <BR>All and all though it's not a movie to run out and pay a lot for, wait until the rental price drops or it's on cable!
B00005JKNF|2.0|It's watchable, but takes too much time to get the story line going. My time is valuable. I fell asleep twice and had to go back to catch up. A rental for a slow Sunday afternoon.
B000068UXF|5.0|First of all, I have compared this new DVD release with the old LD release. The picture quality has been improved with sharper image and fuller color. The audio part now contains LPCM (CD quality, same as in LD) and dts5.1 surround. I use dts5.1 surround and it gives a very natural sound stage and greater presence than listening to the LD release. The DVD prodcution quality is first rate, thanks to Universal Music's new company high standards for DVD production. I hope the other companies, especially Kultur and VAI can learn something here.<br />Now go to the performance. Sir Georg Solti has made a name for his Richard Strauss opera recordings in the classical music world. And in my opinion, Die Frau ohne Schatten is among his best! His great command of the unique and sometimes bizarre orchestral color in this opera gives it an everlasting charm. In several orchestral interludes (during scene change), Sir Georg keeps the tension of the drama very well. And Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra responds with rich string and woodwind colors.<br />The staging is magical. Changes of scenes are seamless and each scene stage decoration is done with very good taste and elaboration.<br />For the soloists, I think Eva Marton is the greatest star in the production. Her effortless vocal skill rides above thick orchestral sound and pierce through it clearly. She seems to have endless power. It's not raw power, but power with beauty. Her powerful voice suits this commanding woman role (the dyer's wife) perfectly. And Marton's acting is a delight to watch, as in many other operas. Marjana Lipovsek as the nurse is another surprise and star in the production. Both singing and acting are first rate.  Cheryl Studer as the empress (the woman with no shadow) demonstrates her sweet voice as in 1992. Her decline on stage in later years is really a pity. Robert Hale as Barak (the dyer) and Thomas Moser as the emperor are also very well casted. I don't find a weak major role in this production.<br/>I wholehearted recommend this DVD to people who love operas.
B00006J3WH|4.0|Well, here's the CD we wanted.<br />And, as usual, the music part of a musical play turns out to be less of an experience than the production as a whole.  Big surprise, huh?<br />That said, the songs are pretty good -- for music written by a non-musician, and the performances are quite good -- for a cast composed mostly of non-singers.<br />Standouts are Tara (Amber Benson) singing \\"Under Your Spell\\", a love-song to Willow, Anya and Xander (Emma Caulfield and Nicholas Brendon) with \\"I'll Never Tell\\", their paean to cold feet and Spike (James Marsters -- one of the two real singers in the regular cast) channelling Billy Idol on \\"Rest in Peace\\".<br />Anthony Stewart Head (Giles), the other singer (who played Frank N. Furter in a 1990 London production of \\"Rocky Horror\\")does well with his big number, \\"Standing\\", meditating on the line between helping and hindering.<br />\\"Walk Through the Fire\\", the big ensemble number, is a big ensemble number.  Without the full-cast staging and visuals (the fire trucks were a brilliant touch), though, it's not quite so impactful.<br />Sarah Michelle Gellar's performance of Buffy's big number, \\"Something to Sing About\\" confirms my suspicion that she's a good actress.  \\"DOn't quit your day job\\" applies, to others of the cast as well as to her.  The irony of this song, of course, is that it's Spike, the vampire, who drives home the point that the only way to deal with life is just to live it.<br />Unlike some musical cast/soundtrack albums, this one cuts doesn't throw in bits of dialog to set up songs (which is an aesthetic decision, and may well go different ways for different shows or producers), but also cuts some dialog cues that were actually part of the songs or closely related to them -- especially several bits of Dawn's dialog with Sweet, the dancing demon responsible for the musical curse that has descended on Sunnydale, which i miss -- particularly her quote of Buffy's line from the end of Season Five \\"The hardest thing to do in this world is to live in it.\\"<br />Most of the extra material included is Nice But So What -- instrumental suites from two shows and another instrumental -- but it's nice to hear Joss and his wife's demo of \\"Something to Sing About\\".<br />I sort of hoped there might be hidden tracks, maybe ASH's solo acoustic performance of \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\", say, but no -- 'twas not to be.  Oh well.<br />If you're a \\"Buffy\\" fan, this is solid value for money.  But then, if you're a \\"Buffy\\" fan, you saw the show when it was on teevee, and you know what's going on -- why people are singing and dancing and catching fire and so on.<br />Because, as i said, without the visuals (or the memory of the visuals) a lot of this disc, sadly, doesn't stand up very well.<br />But, since i remember the visuals, and i enjoyed the original boradcast, and because this CD calls it up for me, a solid four stars.<br />Best line in a song: Willow (Alysson Hannigan, definitely one of the non-singers in the cast) rhymes Spike's \\"First I'll save her, then I'll kill her\\" with \\"I think this line's mostly filler\\"...  (After all, they KNOW that they're in a musical...)<br />So, if you're a fan of the show, buy this CD.  Actually, if you're a real fan of the show, since it's been out almost a month, you probably already HAVE bought it...<br />So enjoy.n this world is to live in it.\\"<br />Most of the extra material included is Nice But So What -- instrumental suites from two shows and another instrumental -- but it's nice to hear Joss and his wife's demo of \\"Something to Sing About\\".<br />I sort of hoped there might be hidden tracks, maybe ASH's solo acoustic performance of \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\", say, but no -- 'twas not to be.

B00005JKDR|5.0|Monsters Inc is by far the best animated film to date! The CGI animation is SO real, that half the time, you completely forget you are watching drawn characters rather then real actual monsters!<BR>The story line has something for everyone to enjoy, it's great for the kids of corse, but theres no kind of person I can think of anyhow that would not find this film to be enjoyable! It's so convincing as well that it seems hard to believe that the &quot;Monster World&quot; isnt real! As far as the comedy goes, no other movie lately has made me laugh quite as much!<BR>John Goodman and Billy Crystal deserve some sort of award too for lending their voices to the film. The casting is no less the perfect which makes the characters seem all the more real! This is a definate must have movie, if you don't get it, you are crazy! I would have paid a hundred bucks for it twice if I had to!
B00004W221|5.0|Sean Astin gives his best performance as Rudy, an undersized football player who decides at a young age he wants to play for Notre Dame. Some obstacles stand in his way before he can even play a down. For one, his family has little money and no desire to send Rudy to college when he has shown no interest in high school. To get onto the hallowed grounds of ND, Rudy first goes to Sacred Heart to get his grades up and work on the grounds crew that prepares the football field. Eventually, he does get into Notre Dame, but he really has no football skills so he doesn't play in a game. He does however have the biggest heart of any player who tries out. Rarely does he get through a day of tryouts without blood dripping from his lip, but he does make the practice squad where he bides his time hoping to play in a game. This is another film that builds up to the final scenes. I don't want to give away anything. The only thing I will say is that I get goosebumps and a lump in my throat every time. A must see if there ever was one.
0316666343|2.0|I honestly don't know what all the hype is about over this book.  I found it to be depressing, boring and lacking in any kind of style.  I think it is highly overrated.
B000000H3W|5.0|My first year of grad school I rented a room in a 3-bedroom apartment on West 121st Street in Manhattan.  My apartment mates were Bob, an aspiring playwright, and Naomi, an aspiring architect.  We were by no means close - like orangutans we led solitary existences and crossed paths mainly at large feeding patches.  Bob and I got on well enough, stopping to chat on those occasions when we encountered one another.  Naomi was a more difficult animal - she didn't like to meet face to face, but rather preferred to leave me notes with little reminders about household chores it was my turn to do.  Her notes were always signed N. as though she were a character straight out of some 19th century Russian novel.  Plastered to the refrigerator, the bathroom mirror and even my bedroom door, N.'s little missives never failed to get under my skin and more often than not, I ignored them and returned to my lair to blast some death metal.  Believe me I had some great death metal just waiting to be heard on such occasions - Obituary's The End Complete and Entombed's Left Hand Path leap immediately to mind.  But even more compelling than those classics was Sepultura's Arise, a 42-minute slab of pure aural aggression. Max Cavalera's brutally precise riffing and wolf-like growl were enough to put that little N. beast and her petty desires out of my mind for awhile, that's for sure.  <br />Sepultura's world on Arise is an unforgettable one - it is heavy, bleak and beautiful all at once.  If you've ever driven the New Jersey Turnpike on a rainy afternoon and said to yourself, `damn, those factories are strangely beautiful', you know exactly what I'm talking about.  If you're still clueless, imagine the sort of music that might go along with the song titles, \\"Dead Embryonic Cells\\", \\"Desperate Cry\\", \\"Altered State\\", and \\"Under Siege (Regnum Irae)\\".  This is metal with an appeal that crosses international boundaries.  I seem to recall once seeing the word \\"Sepultura\\" carved into a desk in a classroom atop a windswept hill on the campus of the University of Antananarivo in Madagascar.  A pretty wide sphere of influence for the boys from Brazil, wouldn't you say?  One word of warning - you may not want to listen to the lyrics closely if you like to sleep well at night.  Max's lyrics are a lot more unsettling today than they were when this album came out 11 years ago.  For example, on the first track, \\"Arise\\", he warns of a \\"terrorist confrontation waiting for the end\\" and \\"cities fall(ing) in ruin\\".  Then, on the classic \\"Dead Embryonic Cells\\", Max rails against \\"tribal violence everywhere, life in the age of terrorism\\".  Let's hope that's as prescient as Max gets as there's a lot of other disturbing stuff on here that we can only hope never happens.  <br />Did I tell you that I really hated N.'s notes?  Trust me, I got around to the chores eventually - I'm not that inconsiderate.  Of course, I could have retaliated by leaving notes for N. when she fell behind in her chores, but decided that would be a bit unfair since as far as I could tell, N. didn't have her own copy of Arise to take solace in.  No reason to put her through the stress of encountering notes signed J. if the poor dear had nothing to help her cope with them.<br />I know, annoying notes are not a big deal in the grand scheme of things.  You probably have more to worry about than some recent Yale grad and her inordinate fondness for post-its.  But, I'm telling you, Arise is the sort of album that can help you forget your minor worries, whatever they are, at least for awhile.  Along with the groundbreaking Roots, Arise is one of Sepultura's two best releases and did time as my favorite album back in the early 90s.  I listened to it again today and it still blows me away.  If you dare to call yourself a metal fan, I expect to find Arise in your album collection the next time I look through it.

B00005JL0I|5.0|I consider this the best movie of the late 60s just as I consider The Prisoner as the best television program and White Rabbit as the best song.  This movie is a psychedelic satire of the James Bond movies.  Everyone involved in the production, directing, acting and film scoring were the first rank talent of that era.   The story is intentionally disjointed and strange in order to produce a confusing effect in the viewer.  The only thing this has in common with the book is the title and the James Bond character.  It is a total rewrite. The bonus feature of the TV version of Casino Royale is also included.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Donnie Darko was a movie that I had wanted to see, but hadn't gone out of my way to do so. It was on late one night, and it certainly kept me up. This is one of those movies that, if you get it, will probably be one of your favorites, but if you don't get it, you won't like. It certainly is not frivolous and you have to watch the movie and pay attention, and probably will require multiple viewings to really see everything. That's ok because it's a wonderful movie, despite its dark overtones. The acting is top-rate from everyone and it was well cast and directed. If you like movies and aren't afraid to be challenged a bit, this comes very highly recommended.
B000056NX4|1.0|This is the worst movie I've ever seen.I actually had to stop watching it about 30 minutes into it.  Thismovie is no where near as good as the 1973 version.  The older version has better voices, better actors, better sets, better costumes, better directing, better anything and everything.
0316666343|2.0|It was a struggle to get through this book<BR>as it's very disturbing and dangerously depicts <BR>dying and heaven in a way that is very misleading. <BR>If one believes in heaven, then by default, one<BR>would believe in God, and also the Bible.  For people<BR>who are confused or seeking answers about<BR>their creation, dying and heaven, she has dangerously<BR>implied heaven and dying as something other than what <BR>it is. I understand that this is a work of fiction, but<BR>nothing would lead a reader to believe that this is a work of science-fiction. Some readers may be okay with the rape and dismemberment of a young girl, as for me, it's an unfortunate reality for few and the rest of us should not deem it entertainment.  I'm giving two stars because it does portray a good account of what effects a loss such as Susie's might have on her family and even people she hardly knew, such as Ruth.
B000067FP7|5.0|&quot;Gremlins&quot; is a Christmas classic for the family to enjoy. Ugly little critters run amok after being birthed by a strange creature named Gizmo. Zach Gilligan is the boy who takes care of his gift, given to him by his inventor father. Don't let it get wet, eat after midnight or get sunlight. He breaks all the rules obviously and he pays the price. The gruesome amount of violence is surprising since the movie is PG. It is funny and Joe Dante knows how to direct a dark comedy. Phoebe Cates is the girlfriend (of that guy? please). This is a splendid Christmas treat especially with the gremlins attacking with bulldozers and causing major damage to the city. Classic.
B000063NPX|5.0|\\"Beauty and the Beast\\" is one of those rare films (animated or live action) that never seems dated despite the fact that it was released just a decade ago. The premise of the whole film is timeless and can always be told over and over to impressionable viewers. The message that you should not judge a person by his or her appearance is an excellent message, especially today when people are being scrutinized simply because they are of a particular ethic group and/or religion. I think \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" succeeded in achieving that goal that you should not judge a person by his or her appearance and that beauty is only skin deep.<br />As a film, \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" is my personal favorite Disney film and all around film of all time. This movie isn't just for kids but for everyone of all ages. I loved the animation when the movie first came out in the movie theaters, and I still love it in the special edition format. Although I really didn't notice a terribly huge difference in the remastering in the quality of the film, I didn't care. The movie still manages to engage me for all 90 minutes. I did notice though that in the introduction just as the narrator was explaining how the prince became the Beast, I swore I never saw that shot of the stained glass window with the prince just standing there. I also noticed during the introduction that the rose was brighter than in the original format. I may be just imagining things though. I must admit that I was a bit suspicious of the inclusion of \\"Almost Human\\" but now that I have seen it. I just adore that segment. It was one of the funnier moments in the movie. I thought it flowed real well with the rest of the movie.<br />\\"Beauty and the Beast\\" is one of the rare movies that I can never tire of watching. It is my personal favorite Disney movie (next to \\"The Lion King\\" and both \\"Toy Story\\" movies), and one of my all time favorite movies. Although it has been just over ten years since it was first released in the theaters, the movie still sounds fresh as ever.rs, the movie still sounds fresh as ever.

B00004Z4WQ|5.0|this movie is the funniest movie I have ever watch. yup, i have to admit it is stupid and senseless. but this is what the movie shines! funny lines, unexpected scenes and stupid spoof of other movies. strongly recommended to get if u seriously want a good laugh!!
B00004TDTO|4.0|You take one step into ocean water, you might as well say 'goodbye' to your feet. Steven Spielberg's &quot;Jaws&quot; made people think twice before they got into the ocean. In a Long Island town, the local people were traumatized by great-white-shark attacks. Raw! The sheriff (Roy Scheider) and two other men took an adventure to hunt down the shark. You know how big that thing was? That could've been food for a month. But no, the shark specialist and the arrogant hunter had to ruin everything. Explosion, boom, shark pieces flew every which way but loose. Seafood will never taste the same ever again.
B00005JKDR|5.0|...for the folks at Pixar.  I found this movie every bit as entertaining, clever, and ingenious as their other films.  The animation and voice talents are superb.  Aside from the jokes and the dizzying chase scene, there are two scenes in the film that are living proof of the power of truly great animation; one, near the end, is absolutely heartbreaking and puts a lump in my throat no matter how many times I see it.  The other is the final image of the film, and it blows my mind to think about how a collection of pixels could carry such emotional resonance.  I say bravo.
B00003CX5P|1.0|One of the worst movies I have ever seen is &quot;Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace.&quot; Forget the story of politics, nobody cares about that. Nobody even cares about it in real life. Jedi Knights train a little boy named Anakin Skywalker (played by an annoying child). He build pod racers and even races himself. How wonderful. Darth Maul (not scary) wants to eliminate the child for he is the chosen one. What a bunch of bull. Jar Jar Binks is the absolute worst thing ever created. Natalie Portman needs to stick to making movies like &quot;The Professional&quot; which is a way better movie than this. This movie is meaningless and has no heart as in the other three. Shame on anybody who likes this.
B000002BE9|5.0|After the death of grunge, and before the boom of pop, Fiona Apple appeared on the 1996 music scenes, a mixture of the two forms...And what wasn't there to love? The angst and anger of grunge plus the marketablitity and commericial appeal of pop...all in the shape of a pretty little waifish girl. Right? Wrong. <BR>Fiona Apple soon contradicted her soft looks with a take-no-bull personality and a speech that dissed the Establishment (being MTV)... She soon followed up with a critically acclaimed jazz-tinged album with a 90 word title...<BR>Yeah. this girl wasn't what we expected.<br />Tidal isn't what we expected. It manages to achieve more than the female grunge/pop. Lyrically and musically, this album rises above the two genres weaknesses and achieves something rarely heard...musical and lyrical individualism...a grating, painful musical concept if used inappropriately. Yet the content heard on Tidal is the very definition of how taking your own path and doing your own thing is the best and most original way.<br />The lyrics concern Fiona, her emotional problems, and her dealings with the Ego...not that this is philosophy class, but one guesses that Fiona probably likes Ayn Rand books. At least Fiona is honest about her self-absorption vs. the Sting, \\"save the animals\\" approach. If self-absorption isn't your thing and celebrity faux-altruism is, then maybe this isn't the album for you, and pick up one of those grating New York tribute albums, or Michael Jackson's \\"We Are the World\\" single instead. <br />None of Fiona's attitudes read literally. In fact, literally they read like an extended monologue to a lover explaining her various weaknesses as a person and her need to repair those weaknesses. But instead of simple self-pity, Fiona also has some swagger, some kick, and self-confidence that prevales occasionally from the doom and gloom. For all Fiona complains about how little of a person she is, she really does have a healthy sense of herself. <br />\\"And you'll yield to me, like a scent in the breeze\\" she slurs in Slow Like Honey, obviously aware of the power she holds over men. <br />The songwriting is sophisticated and jazzy with a staying power that ranks it in the classics. I can say with full relish that 6 years later, \\"Criminal\\" is still one awesome tune...it's almost surprising that it was a hit, considering the low standard that radio consistently plays.  This album is chock full of amazing songs...I could go on and on about the virtues of each one. Andrew Slater's production accentuates the blues and soul prevalent in both her music and her emotions. <br />Unfortunately, the music industry never truly appreciated Fiona...they kept on painting that unfortunate Alanis Morrissette-esque grungy portrait, when really Fiona's songwriting and vocal styles recall nothing but herself. Remember this is individualism, pure and simple. <br />Tidal is a different album, unique and more than a bit odd. Yet it's aim is so exact and the aspirations Fiona has are so dead on, that it remains the most effective self-confessional singer-songwriter experiment in individualism the 90's and perhaps the entirety of musical has beared witness to.
B00006F7XJ|3.0|This is not a particularly energetic effort. Where many of the songs contain interesting passages, overall, there is an absence of strong compositions. As usual, Andy Latimer's guitar playing is strong. There are moments when his tone is somewhat reminiscent of David Gilmours most recent work on the Division Bell, an equally unenergetic work. Where Rajaz possessed more consistently solid songs the keyboard work and overall musicianship were also far superior. Ton Scherpenzeel is a far more creative and original voice on the keyboards than is Guy LeBlanc. LeBlanc is a capable player who is vulnerable at times to playing too brief or superficial a passage. He can sound somewhat cliched. There are moments (see the Fox) where he turns it up a bit but he fails to ignite a fire under Latimer as did Ton on Rajaz. Colin Bass is as he always is, steady but uninspiring. The same can be said of the drum work. The difference between these more contemporary recordings to that of their much earlier work in the 70's is that the bands fail to ignite a significant chemistry. It's a shame as it leaves the listener, and long time fan, somewhat disapointed. Still it's nice to know that even if the old farts are slowing down, along with the meter, they are still around making an honest effort. Perhaps Latimer could take a page out Ian Anderson's book and upgrade the band in order to rejuvenate it and keep it vital and energetic. Proceed with caution...Simon
B00005JKCH|1.0|One geeky guy with a love interest to another girl, gets superpower. Another guy, gets superpower ,becomes the first guys' archenemy. They fought. Good guy wins. End of story. Oh yeah, what story again? What alternate reality did this Spiderman movie is based from again?<br />     Spider-Man is \\"suppose\\" to be the best superhero movie of the past 20 years. But watching Spiderman at the theater is like watching a movie out of the \\"The 10 worst movie superhero sequel of all time\\". Being a fan of Spiderman (from comics to saturday morning cartoons), watching this movie is like watching \\"Batman & Robin\\" movie (and you thought that movie was bad already). Spiderman/Peter Parker is suppose to be smart, funny, sensitive and caring. The whole potrayal didn't even get close (or maybe just bad acting).  The way he talked to his uncle at the museum is totally out of character. The movie went too fast, JJJameson and Robertson maybe had about 3-4 minutes of screen time, and these characters are vital parts of Spiderman. You never really get to know the characters and never really have the time to humanize them. And the special effects? There is nothing special about it. Not even close to the industry standard at the present, I wish some other studio made this movie (or director). It feels like you are in a studio yourself watching the night scenes, everything is so boxy looking, no realism at all. There was a scene that the shadow of a building  is going the opposite way the shadow of MaryJane against the same reference sun (lighting issue?).<br />    The whole movie is just a set-up for the sequel(s). It's only the first movie but it is already going south substancewise(did somebody say \\"Batman 3\\"?). This movie is nothing but hype, music videos, Spiderman fans(count me in), and/or for the lack of good movie competition.
B000065U1N|2.0|I am an aspiring film director so I do understand what this movie has done.  It has shown battle as if the viewer of the film is in it.  Not an ounce of formalism is present.  98 percent of this movie is combat.  I appreciate that it has shown combat how it is, chaos and all.  However, I do not think the fact that it shows combat realistically constitutes a \\"good film\\" for me.  The constant wall of violent images becomes dull and gross after an hour or so.   A shock technique with no purpose other than to disgust.  Maybe it's premise was to make combat seem horrendous, but all I saw in this film glorified combat.  This makes sense considering we are now a post 9/11 generation.  Lines of intelligible dialogue are few and far between.  A mission briefing full of military terms, a seizure while watching a movie, and shouts of \\"NO!\\" are about the only things heard throughout.  One extra star is given because of it's combat portrayal, that while dead on in realism, suffers horribly because of it's negative to film qualities.
B00005JL3A|3.0|I've played every Resident Evil game and book there is and I have to say what the heck is this movie about?  I mean if you're going to call it Resident Evil you might want it to look and be as close to the game as you can.  When I heard the movie was coming out I couldn't wait to see it...but now that I have I wished I didn't.  The script was terrible; it took away from the whole resident evil series.  Originally the whole plot was Umbrella Corporation was creating genetically engineered B.O.W. Weapons.<br />From the start things were terribly wrong.  The mansion (if you could call it that) wasn't even what it looked like in any of the games and the hive what the hell was that???  Both the mansion and Raccoon City had its own underground labs. And the Red Queen what the hell where they thinking?  That took away from what could be expected to be a great screen play of the popular Resident Evil games.  R.E. gamers expect if you have zombies and the other nasty creations where is the scientists who created them?  The scientist in the movie look like college graduates rather than medical geniuses who would research on something like the T-Virus.<br />There was no mention of S.T.A.R.S. the G-Virus or even William Birkin, who was the man who created the T-Virus. That would have made this movie more worth while to see. It would also have cleared a lot of things up and made the movie sell more.  The zombies both portrayed what they did in the game because they weren't all messed up because they don't decay fast.  I thought that the licker and the zombie dogs were also a really good touch.  But the movie would have been better if there were a little bit more monsters like hunters, zombie crows, and the infamous Tyrant.  They would have made this a better movie.<br />The acting was good considering the bad script.  Actresses Milla Jovovich (Alice) and Michelle Rodriguez (Rain Ocamo) did really well.  The scripting and design on the laser room scene was bad.  The whole team could have just stayed but the front or back doors where the laser beam couldn't hit them (because the glass wall didn't extend to the doors) would have been a smart move. But instead you have 3 butchered commandos and one diced leader.<br />In all, this movie to Resident Evil gamers is a partial upset.  And its replay life is only a couple of times.  But for all you suspense/horror movies this one is your movie.  It contains many thrilling parts including zombie carnage, action packed gun battles, navigating through a dark murky sewer, and a high speed train slug match between the living and undead.  This is an especially good zombie movie even though it isn't as gory as some but the suspense is what makes it a good movie.<br />Although this movie had a lot of changes and upsets it is still a good movie.

1573225517|4.0|I picked up High Fidelity on the recommendations of others not having seen the flick prior to reading the book. I flew through it in 2 days - would have finished it in 1 if not for babysitting. Suffice it to say, it proves to be a quick, easy, and hilarious page-turner. Hornby writes with his witty, British style that makes for a book that you will enjoy and fly through in a short amount of time.<br />I particularly enjoyed the sadistic dialogue between Rob and his 2 dim-witted Championship Vinyl employees Dick and Barry. The totally unoriginal name for Barry's band made me laugh out loud seeing as it fit with his obtuse character - Barrytown. \\"Be afraid. Be very afraid. Here comes Sonic Death Monkey!\\" As Rob undergoes his belated rite of passage, he inversely states his previous motto into \\"It's not what you like, it's what you're like.\\" Good stuff.

B000069I3O|4.0|I loved this movie. Michael Douglas plays the lead role of a cold, structured, and lonely business tycoon whose father committed suicide at the age of 48. In the movie, Douglas is about to turn 48. He is divorced, has no children, and no real friends. He lives alone in a huge mansion and the person he is closest to is the housekeeper, Elsie, who has taken care of him and his house since he was a child. On his birthday, the millionaire's secretary advises him that there's a &quot;Seymour Butts&quot; on the line who wants to meet him for lunch. The millionaire agrees to meet the person for lunch and it turns out to be his younger brother (played by Sean Penn -- who is great, as usual) who gives Douglas a present; a voucher that entitles the millionaire to a 'game'. The rest of the movie is about the 'game' -- the only problem is that Douglas's character doesn't know what the 'game' is and neither do we! So we join the main character on a thrilling ride of strange events, compelling characters, perplexing contradictions, and plot twists like you wouldn't believe. <BR>Although the whole movie is great, my favorite parts are the 'set-up' (the first half hour of the movie) and the conclusion (last twenty minutes). Douglas is great portraying the cold, conservative man we meet at the beginning of the movie. And the climatic ending is totally satisfying and finally it all makes sense! The stuff in between is kinda' unbelieveable (to say the least) but it keeps you guessing and wanting to know what happens next. <BR>It's heartening to see that some people in Hollywood know that it's possible to make a great thriller that doesn't involve the gory deaths of half of the cast. I recommend this movie -- watch it and enjoy!
B00003CX8Y|5.0|Beauty & The Beast is a phenomenal Disney Production. A plush film of brilliant colours and animation. An enchanted story of love and acceptance, with the staple cliché' of happily ever after. Disney is notorious for its sweetly glazed sexist and racist generalizations. But this conscious mind still enjoys most of the Walt Disney Animations, and Beauty & The Beast is one of my personal favorites (behind The Lion King and the Little Mermaid).<br />Without a doubt, the movie deserves a 5-Star rating - but the DVD .... well, [stinks]. Without a surround sound system or an SS option on your TV/DVD - you'll be missing 50 percent of the dialogue...But as the opening tune of \\"Belle/Bonjour\\" played, Belle's voice beautifully sings,  \\"there goes the baker with his tray like always....\\" And as her poor provincial town mates sing of her oddity, \\".........\\" silence!...
B00000K19E|5.0|You have to admit, there are very few movies that can be watched more than 3 times. This is a movie than can be watched more than 10 times and still amaze an audience of all ages. The Matrix is definitely a movie that amazes a movie goer by how much detail there is in it!! Great story line and creativity -all unveiled in a couple of hours!! ...
B000068TPN|5.0|This movie showed the true war in not just Vietnam but also at home.  It is a tribute to the fighting men of Vietnam.  Faced paced and action packed.  Never a dull moment.  It captures a real feel of battle.  Excellent movie.
0789420694|4.0|Robert Louis Stevenson's \\"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\" is one of the classics of horror literature because it provides the paradigmatic example of the \\"werewolf,\\" the human being with a monstrous alter ego.  However, originally it was much more of a mystery story and that is the best way of describing this adaptation of Stevenson's novella by Michael Lawrence.  The book's complex structure is simplified and Lawrence employs a narrator to help retell the tale.  The adaptation is certainly competent enough, but the story clearly takes a back seat to the illustrations in this particular volume.<br />This Eyewitness Classics adaptation of \\"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\" is full of the illustrations and details we have come to associate with books put out by DK Publishing.  A two-page spread before the first chapter details The Two Face of London, contrasting the rich West End of Victorian London with Soho area where criminals stalked the poor.  Background about how Victorian gentlemen dressed for evening and how women were second-class citizens is provided.  Once the story commences there are not only illustrations by Ian Andrew depicting events in the novella, but the borders are usually filled with small photographs and detailed text amplifying the action.  One such note might explaining the gas lighting system in use at the time while another actually explains the significance of the key Jekyll supposedly gave to Hyde.  These pictures and notes are certainly informative, but they are also somewhat intrusive, especially when the reader is trying to decide when they should read each of these additional bits of information.<br />The attempt here is to provide something more than a straightforward presentation of the novella without going so far as to provide an annotated version.  The information provided is quite useful for young readers, for the most part, but their intrusiveness may well get in the way of enjoying the story itself.  The illustrations by Andrew are stylistically evocative of the shadowy, misty streets of London we associate with tales of violent crimes such as \\"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.\\"  A final spread in the back of the book looks at the Legend of the story, which includes the various dramatic versions on stage and screen.  More interesting are the insights into how the story reflected what people were thinking about evolution, psychology, and drugs at the end of the 19th-century.  The best solution might be to just try and read the story without always resorting to the additional information and then going back and filling in the details (maybe on a chapter by chapter basis).  This approach is used in a pair of other \\"horror\\" classics, \\"Dracula\\" and \\"The Hunchback of Notre Dame,\\" in the DK Classics series.ally evocative of the shadowy, misty streets of London we associate with tales of violent crimes such as \\"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.\\"  A final spread in the back of the book looks at the Legend of the story, which includes the various dramatic versions on stage and screen.

I found that I couldn't put it down, and was amazed that Richard Adams could make rabbits seem so human and still make them seem like rabbits.  I loved this book, and was suprised I hadn't read it earlier.  I would recommend this book to people of all ages.
B00002ND77|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite movies. It is long and there are some parts that move by really slowly, but taken as a whole this is truly one of the best films ever made. I am not a huge fan of Spike Lee, but he really out did himself with \\"X\\". Denzel is perfect as Malcolm. Angela Bassett is wonderful.<br />This movie is moving and dramatic. I cried numerous times through out the movie. I was caught up in the life of Malcolm X and I immediately went out and bought the book by Alex Haley.<br />No matter your views about Malcolm, Spike Lee, or the Civil Rights movement this movie is entertaining and stands on its own merit.
B000065U1N|5.0|Although my military experience does not involve much contact with the Army, I found this film to a be a realistic portrayal.  I'm a big Ridley Scott fan and believe he does a great job with detail and placing the filmgoer in another place and time.  Although there are a few composite characters, it faithfully tells the story of what was perhaps the bloodiest small unit action since the Vietnam War.  In the course of my recent travels, I happened to come across an individual who was deeply involved in this fight (and several times wounded)...his evaluation was also quite positive.  This is the way movies about the military should be made!
B000065U1N|5.0|I love this movie, which is very suprising since I normally don't like war movies. I just can't get into them. A friend of mine forced me to watch the movie and I was hooked from the very first scene. There is a lot of blood and guts, and there are some really horrific scenes. If you are faint at heart prepare yourself, but the movie is great. The heroism of each and every Ranger and Delta operator is fantasically portrayed. It also gives due respect to the Somalians instead of depicting them as the typical enemy. This movie is great. I definitely recommend it to your collection.
B00005JKDR|5.0|Pixar's seemingly endless roll continues with this gem of a movie.  And once again I hew not only to the standard that I liked it, but of the audience reaction as well when I saw it in the theaters.  Everyone laughed as one, watched silently in awe as one, you get the picture.  And when Boo / Sulley first said goodbye, there was not a dry eye in the house.<br />The meat and potatoes is, this movie hits all the right buttons.  It fulfills the promise that both Toy Story movies, good movies though they are, never quite made it to.  They combine the whip-smart humor, heart-string-tugging sequences, and lush landscapes for all this to happen in.  Randall alone (somewhat cliched, yes, but in my book a great classic villain, wonderfully voiced by Steve Buscemi) shows what can be done with a great voice in the hands of animators.  This proves another coup for the filmmakers, in that everyone's voice fits.  Jennifer Tilly is the perfect Celia.  Billy Crystal is just right for Mike, the same as John Goodman is just who I'd picture behind a character like Sulley.  In the same vein, I have a hard time picturing anyone ELSE doing these characters, because they were picked this well.  And while I'm at it, kudos to those who put together the extras.  Just seeing the length of time they spent getting something so seemingly simple as Sulley's fur to work correctly is a treat in itself.  Not only that, but there's a treasure trove of other oddball studio tour treats, etc.. the new short film isn't the best thing they've ever done, but it's good.  And the short &quot;For The Birds&quot; is still exquisite in all it's simplicity.<br />In any event, there is no more to be said.  I could go on about the movie's storyline more, but I don't want to ruin anything.  Suffice it to say the folks at Pixar did a fine job, and this is an excellent movie that works on many levels for both kids and adults, and well worth your picking up.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|I knew this movie was great but when I bought the DVD I fell in love with it all over again. The movie is a masterpiece. Not only is the movie great (all three versions!), the DVD is amazing! The menu is beautiful and the behind the scenes features are enlightening as well as entertaining. It is set up so you are exploring the castle at the same time and it really is amazing. There are also games galore. This DVD is completely worth the money!
B000067JBN|3.0|This film remake of \\"The Time Machine\\", an adaptation of the H.G. Wells novel of the same name, is enhanced by Dreamworks' digitalized, special effects wizardry. It lacks, however, the intelligent handling of its 1960 predecessor, a science fiction film classic, which starred the very virile and testosterone charged Rod Taylor and the ethereally beautiful Yvette Mimieux in the lead roles. Instead, we now  get a seriously emaciated Guy Pearce (hand him a Big Mac, for Pete's sake) and the pretty, but tepid, Samantha Mumba.<br /><br />In this version, Alexander Hartdegan (Guy Pearce) has lost the woman he loves in a pointless murder. Depressed, he tinkers with the construction of a time machine for years, hoping to go back in time to right what went wrong. What he discovers is that though he can go back and make some changes, the end result is always the same. In an attempt to obtain a resolution of this paradox, he travels into the future. In his quest for answer, he has an accident that causes him to go hundreds of thousands of years into the future.<br /><br />There, he encounters a dual society, that of the aggressive Morlocks, the hunters, and that of the peaceful Eloi, the hunted. The Eloi are a group of humans that defy racial typing, as they all seem multi-racial, which is, in and of itself, one of the most interesting ideas in this remake and virtually its only social commentary. The Morlocks are a  frightening society, totally monstrous in appearance. Their overlord, well played by an albinoesque Jeremy Irons, is suitably menacing.<br /><br />Mara (Samantha Mumba), an Eloi lovely, takes care of the injured Alexander when he first arrives. When the Morlocks go into attack mode and Mara is taken captive, Alexander (Guy Pearce) goes into superhero mode to the rescue. Guy Pearce as an action hero? I think not. Guy Pearce, who has given excellent performances in other films, is ill suited for the role of Alexander and his acting in the part reflects this. Moreover, while Samantha Mumba is lovely to look at, she exhibits very little acting ability.<br /><br />It is unfortunate that the screenplay left H.G. Wells story' by the wayside, deciding to fix what ain't broke. In doing so, they constructed a story that does not work that well, losing much of the tension inherent in the original film. The film's only saving grace, apart from the specal effects, is the dazzling homesite of the Eloi, cocoons built onto a canyon wall, which are just beautiful.<br /><br />Don't buy this remake. Instead, buy the 1960 version. This remake is worth a rental, however, if one is looking for some mindless, moderately enjoyable  entertainment., while Samantha Mumba is lovely to look at, she exhibits very little acting ability.<br /><br />It is unfortunate that the screenplay left H.G.

B0000648WZ|2.0|I really hope someone redoes this movie someday with a better script, director and actors who are all in part to blame for this movie.  There were so many things wrong with it it is hard to know where to start: I guess the best place to start is at the root, the script.  Writer ED Neumeier packs the script with flat dialouge, lackluster scences and relies more on gorey battle sequences than on giving his director to work with.   But his director, \\"Robocop's\\" Paul Verhoeven,  seemingly did nothing to get past it.  He gives the movie even more boredom than the script alone would have.  His direction style and camera angles do nothing to intensify the battles or give the dialouge more muster.  He gives his actors absolutely nothing to fall back on.  And finally there are the actors to critque.  First off, the studio who financed the movie looked like all they tried was to find the prettiest faces and put them with them a movie that they thought would be able to look past their sub-par performances and become a hit.  Unfortunaetly, most of us have the movie sense to see that.  Almost all the actors don't try to get into character or delivering their lines with feeling and purpose (but that goes back to script problems).  All in all,  this movie should be put in a vault and then have someone else create a deeper, more emotional, more thrilling film.
B00006AFUR|5.0|30STM-  A well put together album with hypnotic guitar riffs and catchy vocals. Jared Leto uses high pitch vocals with relentless Synthesizer melodies that keep the listeners ears against the speaker. I highly recommend the album if you like Taproot,Deadsy,Deftones,Linkin Park. These guys have a music taste all of their own and are a band to reckon with.  -Isaac-
B00006JL1Z|5.0|Fleetwood Mac always created their own &quot;Timespace&quot; to use Nicks' phrase. What I find most exciting about this new album is the relase of the long awaited studio version of &quot;Silver Springs&quot; (I remember listening to it as a child and being bewitched)which next to Sara are my personal favorites (of course I love them all). I remember hearing Buckingham Nicks when I was 4 years old and seeing the album leaning against my dad's friends stereo. The magic hasn't left them, nor the enchanted songs that generated the Fleetwood Mac albums all these years. <br />I personally love the acoustic versions of Lindsey's Go Insane, Big Love, etc. I think he is a musical genius and an underrated guitar player. <br />Stevie of course, only gets better and better. I'm excited to hear the infamous &quot;Paper Doll&quot; which I'd heard about, but never listened to. Sister of the Moon is another I look forward to hearing again. <br />Mick, John, and Christine's beautiful songs are being looked forward to. This is the best group in the world. I listen to many others, but Fleetwood Mac music and members are the Queens and Kings of Rock n' Roll forever. They are the music..... of my lifetime....<BR>I love you Stevie, Lindsey, John, Christine, and Mick.
B00001ZULV|4.0|As the title, &quot;Turn It On Again: The Hits&quot; suggests, this Genesis compilation simply represents the band's *hits* (well, most of them). This is not a &quot;Best-Of&quot; retrospective of the band's career, just the stuff that made it onto the singles charts, which explains why the lion's share of this album comes from the Phil Collins era, Peter Gabriel's era is only represented twice, and Ray Wilson only once. Still, as a longtime Genesis follower, I'm very pleased with this disc, as it represents a great time when these guys were a strong presence on the radio airwaves. If you're a Genesis fan, either diehard or just casual, then listening to this CD will be a nice stroll down memory lane.Most of the usual suspects are here: &quot;Follow You Follow Me,&quot; &quot;Abacab&quot; (single version), &quot;That's All,&quot; &quot;Invisible Touch,&quot; &quot;Tonight Tonight Tonight&quot; (single version), &quot;No Son Of Mine,&quot; and &quot;I Can't Dance.&quot; Thankfully, Ray Wilson's brief time as the group's frontman is represented here by &quot;Congo,&quot; which briefly charted in the UK (I'm glad that at least *one* track from the very-overlooked Genesis album, &quot;Calling All Stations,&quot; will be heard by somebody). And Peter Gabriel's only &quot;hits&quot; with the band, &quot;I Know What I Like&quot; &amp; &quot;The Carpet Crawlers&quot; (both charted in the UK), are also here. And speaking of &quot;The Carpet Crawlers,&quot; this version is a remake, with Gabriel, Collins, and guitarist Steve Hackett briefly returning to the fold for a handsome 1999 reworking of this classic nugget from &quot;The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway&quot; (though everybody in the band recorded their parts separately). Quite possibly the very last thing the band will ever record together, this '99 &quot;Carpet Crawlers,&quot; like the original version, is a sheer beauty. The album is worth getting just for this one track alone.    However, with only so much space to workwith on a compact disc, several other chart singles by Genesis have been left off, such as &quot;Ripples,&quot; &quot;Your Own Special Way,&quot; &quot;No Reply At All,&quot; &quot;Man On The Corner,&quot; &quot;Paperlate,&quot; and &quot;Never A Time.&quot; Still, all things considered, &quot;Turn It On Again: The Hits&quot; is a very good representation of Genesis' most popular tunes. If you're a diehard fan who already owns the whole band's catalog, get this CD for the &quot;Carpet Crawlers&quot; remake, as it's totally worth it. And if you're simply a casual fan, well then, get it for the hits. Either way, it's a win-win purchase. :-)
B000001DYA|5.0|One thing that separates REALLY great rock 'n' roll from the merely great or the very good is that the REALLY great is usually really DUMB. And this is as dumb as they come, and, thus as great as they come. It fits in with such classic dumbness as the Stooge's first album and Iron Butterfly's &quot;Are You Happy&quot; and, of course, &quot;Inagoddadavida&quot; and a lot of stuff Suicide and Flipper did a decade and a half later.<br />Summertime Blues was the big hit from the record, but I don't think it's that good at all, and often when I play this record, I skip it to go on to the really cool stuff. And everything on the rest of the record is COOL, COOL, COOL. &quot;Doctor Please&quot; is maybe the coolest song in history. As a special reccomendation for this song let me say I play a lot of music at work, most of it very annoying to almost everyone else there besides me, but no song has more annoyed more people than &quot;Doctor Please&quot;. The essence of cool is something you like and everyone else hates.<br />I like hysterical singers, and the hysteria of Blue Cheer's singer is unmatched. His style is very dated, but that just adds to the charm (and humor, maybe unintentional) of this record.<br />Get this record. With &quot;The Psychedelic Sound of the Thirteenth Floor Elevators&quot;, it is one of the two best rock'n'roll records of the sixties. Together they were the definitive answer to the British Invasion. Nothing coming out of England could match this stuff (maybe the Pretty Things in their best songs-&quot;Buzz the Jerk&quot; specifically-came the closest). When Blue Cheer and the Elevators started recording, the Beatles and Stones and DC5 should have packed their bags and gone home.<br />Unfortunately, this was it for Blue Cheer. They put out a few more records, but they were mostly junk. There were a few good songs (like Babylon), but as albums were not really worth buying. But if you want to know cool, get this record.
B0000065MS|3.0|This fictionalized account of the real life disaster takes a while to get going, but does deliver some good scenes in the final third of the film.  George C. Scott is a Nazi colonel sent aboard the Hindenburg due to threats made about its voyage.  He is joined by a cast of familiar actors, including Anne Bancroft as a bitter German countess.  As was typical with disaster films of the Seventies, there are several small stories involving the various passengers, but none of them are particularly interesting.  I found the set up scenes for the bombing plotline confusing to follow.  The film's strength is the terrific set pieces for the Hindenburg and its final thirty minutes.  The actual explosion doesn't feature the level of special effects we're used to seeing, but since it combines real footage of the disaster, it made a strong impact on me.  By no means a great film, The Hindenburg is salvaged by its final moments and by the audience's knowledge that it really did happen, although perhaps not for the reasons presented in the movie.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|You can easily trace the Beatles' progression through this disc, although the critical parts that make up the whole can only be found on the albums. Most albums didn't include their most recent single releases, including many songs in this CD. Rather, each release captured a moment in time...a water mark of sorts that more or less allowed the public in on what was about to come in the next LP. It continually recaptures and refreshes each of those moments in an era that changed the world forever.
B000002GJH|5.0|I recently got Temple of the Dog. I was a pretty big fan of the whold grunge movement of the early and mid 90s. Temple bring together Pearl Jam and Soundgarden, the of the best grung bands. It collaborations are great, the songs are well written. The combination of Eddie Veder's and Chris Cornell's vocals are brilliant. Temple of the Dog really makes me remember why I stated listening to grunge.
B00005B36H|5.0|If you've listened to any other Tool CDs, then expect this one to be very different. Aenima (the previous album) is probabaly most closely related, this CD is also worth listening to. But Lateralus is truely a musical masterpiece. Tool has the ability to convey the most thoughful and interesting music that I have ever heard. Their music will usually impress anyone within most genres of music because there music is just amazing. The guitar doesn't have any annoying droning riffs or something weird, everything seems to be in perfect harmony. The drums are just awesome. They go very well with the songs. Each song has a very mysterious feel to it, making it even more enjoyable. Below is a review and brief descroption of the songs.<br />The Grudge (100/100) - A great song. It really starts the CD out well. The only thing I have against it is that some time near the end Manyard (lead singer) screams for about 15 seconds. This annoys me a litte. Other than that it is a nice song.<br />Eon Blue Apocalypse (100/100) - If I remember correctly, this isn't really a song, more like a bunch of strange noises. But nonetheless, its a great bridge to the next song.<br />The Patient (100/100) - Another stunning song. The powerful lyrics and sound are cool.<br />Mantra (100/100) - Another track that really isn't a song. Apparently one of the band members was hugging his cat and whenever he squeezed it made a weird noise. So he made it into a track with echoing noises and stuff. It doesn't really sound like much, but its a great bridge to Schism.<br />Schism (100/100) - One of my favorite songs. You have probably heard this on the radio. This really shows Tool's skill.<br />Parabol (100/100) - A nice soft acoustic song. Its really a prelude to the next song. (This track in the next seemed like they were split because this track leads into the next).<br />Parabola (100/100) - This song undoubtably shows Tool's full potential. This is one of the best on the CD.<br />Ticks and Leeches (100/100) - This is a strange song. Also the only one where they scream. After all this screaming it goes into an interlude where its all soft and then back into screaming again.<br />Lateralus (100/100) - You have to have heard this one on the radio. This is an amazing song.<br />Disposition (100/100) - The next three songs are one of the best. The music turns into some sort of medatative music here. They were oringinally together as one 22 minute track, but now split up. This first one is slightly boring, but prepares you for the middle track.<br />Reflection (100/100) - The drums are unreal here! This with the awesome song make this track the coolest of the three.<br />Triad (100/100) - This song is pretty cool. Its a great finale to the three songs.<br />Faaip de Oiad (50/100) - Apparently Enochian for &quot;Voice of God&quot;, this song is the worst on the CD. Its not really a song, but more like a drum solo with annoying high-pitched noises with a distressed man talking about UFOs and aliens invading earth. Very annoying track.<br />This CD is the best, it must be added to your collection. Its the longest CD I have ever seen clocking at 79 minutes and 58 seconds!
0451167716|5.0|Th ebook is exactly like the movie except for a few touches that I really like.  You get to hear what the charecters are acrually thinking.  In the movie you had to guess by what they said(they always did a very good job).  The secound thing that I really like about the book is that eventually Kay excepts that she is never going to change her husband Mike and ceases to moan and complian.  <br />Conclusion-If you liked the movie, you will love the book.
B000002UB3|5.0|If I had to choose which record by the Beatles, one of my favorite groups ever, I enjoyed the most, I would think for a few seconds, debate between The White Album and Abbey Road, and then choose the latter. It may have been the last recording they ever made, but they made much use of what little time they had left.<br />Abbey Road kicks off with &quot;Come Together&quot;, which is probably the best track on side one. It's a pretty subdued track until the end, but John's surreal lyrics are as good as they're ever going to get here. &quot;Maxwell's Silver Hammer&quot; is Paul's demented tale about a serial killer, which manages to work on many levels. Rounding off side one is the bizarre &quot;I Want You (She's So Heavy)&quot;; after switching back and forth between varying tempos for four minutes, the group finally decides on one, and continues playing it for the last three minutes, while white noise slowly engulfs the song.<br />Side two, however, is how the Beatles left their legacy to the world. &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot; is a very uplifting song, written by none other than George Harrison. &quot;Because&quot; has some of the most gorgeous melodies ever recorded.<br />After this, the first of the two famous medleys begins with &quot;You Never Give Me Your Money&quot;, which is the most accomplished song of the 5-song medley. It segues into the beautiful &quot;Sun King&quot;, written and sung by John. After this is the psychadelic &quot;Mean Mr. Mustard&quot;, a great, albeit short, number.<br />Before I continue, I would just like to make a short note. &quot;Her Majesty&quot;, which is at the end of Abbey Road, was actually meant to go right after &quot;Mean Mr. Mustard&quot;. Paul didn't like it, however, so he had the song cut out of the medley. However, it was accidentally put at the end of the master tape, but the Beatles liked it, so they kept it. I have used Cool Edit Pro to reinsert the song in between &quot;Mustard&quot; and &quot;Pam&quot;, and it sounds much more natural, in my opinion; it allows for a short, but needed, instrumental break in the medley. <br />Next is &quot;Polythene Pam&quot;, which flows right into &quot;She Came in Through the Bathroom Window&quot;, which is a great way to end the awesome first medley.<br />The second medley, though only three songs, is the best part of Abbey Road. It starts off with the touching &quot;Golden Slumbers&quot;, which then moves into &quot;Carry That Weight&quot;, which is sort of a reprise of &quot;YNGMYM&quot;, but features one of the greatest uses of a brass instrument in any song. Abbey Road ends with a song that is fitting called &quot;The End&quot;, which features the greatest line the Beatles ever sung in a song of theirs. If you don't know what it is, I won't tell you; it's probably best if you just listen to it yourself.<br />If you call yourself a Beatles fan, but haven't listened to Abbey Road, you're a liar. The Beatles were arguably the greatest rock band ever, and this album shows why.
B00003CXA4|5.0|This magnificent film has a cast of thousands as it was was produced before digitizing later became common practice.  It was filmed on location in India and starred Ben Kingsley as Gandhi.  Of course he had to lose weight, and he did have to maintain a suntan.  But in spite of being English and not Indian, he sure did look like Gandhi.  And during the course of the film, he just melted right into the character of this very special man he was portraying.  The supporting cast was wonderful too and included Candice Bergen, John Gielgud, Trevor Howard, Martin Sheen and Om Puri.<br />The film covers more half a century, beginning in 1893 in South Africa when Gandhi, an attorney educated in England, is treated like a second-class citizen.  Always, he yearned for freedom for his people from British rule.  And always, he preached non-violence.  It worked.  Eventually India did become independent.  And, later, when the tension mounted between Muslims and Hindus, and blood began to be shed, Mahatma Gandhi's hunger strike was able to stop the fighting.<br />Watching the film on DVD is a special treat because it included some original newsreel footage of Gandhi himself as well as a recent interview with Ben Kingsley, who is now in his late fifties.  I love all those behind-the-scene stories, such as how he had to learn to spin fabric as part of his role and how difficult it was for him to spin and say his lines at the same time.  Also, in the funeral scene, which included 400,000 people, he actually played the part of the corpse instead of using a wax dummy.<br />I definitely recommend this DVD.  See it for the great performances.  See it for a sense of history.  And see it as a moral lesson in what is possible.
B00006690G|5.0|I was blown away with his talent!!  Being a white, middle age woman, I'm probable not someone who you would classify as a \\"typical\\" Eminem fan.  This was my first rap CD and I was hooked from White America on. I heard \\"Cleanin Out My Closet\\" on TV and had the desire to buy this CD.  I am now definitely one of his fans.  I won't rate every song like some of the other reviews but I will say if you are open minded and want to hear some great \\"stories\\" with great music to back them up, I would recommend this CD!!  I loved every song, a few more than others.....I'm hooked and you will be too!!!
B000068QY7|5.0|My gal was overseas, I was just about to quit my job and I was feeling pretty low - and then I heard The Hindu Times on the radio for the first time.  Nearly eight months later it's still in my top 5 songs of the year and this album rates likewise.  As a 32yo who hankers for the old Oasis dominance days of Wonderwall and Morning Glory this is a welcome return to form.  Hardcore Oasis fans will always wish that Bonehead &amp; Guigsy never left but Andy &amp; Gem actually make the band sound tighter, and their songwriting experience relieves some pressure off Noel.<BR>Little By Little and Stop Crying Your Heart Out rank alongside the best of Oasis, and the live reviews are &quot;better than Knebworth&quot; according to the NME.  No matter what, they are still about the only band today who follow the great traditions of The Beatles, The Jam, The Smiths and The Stone Roses, and if nothing else that makes this an essential purchase.
0385335482|5.0|[...]I love this bk, it's the perfect mixture of comedy and drama!  I couldn't put it down the night I bought it (LITERALLY) I read all 315 pgs in under 24 hrs & I'm the kind of girl who hardly reads magazine articles!  I went to the spa & the woman there told me to put the bk down & relax!  Ha!  Not on my clock honey!  I'm in the works of reading it for the 2nd time & my heart beats just as fast as it did when I read it for the 1st time!  I relate so well to the main character, & when you think about it luggage is just as fun to buy as clothes or make-up or perfume or...     ...well everything!!!  If your a true shopaholic you'll buy this bk in the truck-load.  Happy shopping!
B00003CX8Y|5.0|Every time I am confronted with this film I try to resist it, and yet every time I end up falling completely under its spell. No, it is not the ne plus ultra of animated film as some insist, nor is it as good as the classic French live action version that it borrows from so liberally. For what it is, though, a sentimental, Broadway-style romantic musical comedy, it can't be beat. Good fun for the whole family, even if you don't have kids. <br />A new musical number available on the DVD does nothing to advance the plot, but is nevertheless a charming addition to the the film. A &quot;Work In Progress&quot; version provides fascinating insight into the animation process.
B00002ND77|4.0|Greetings,<BR>I will write this review from a different angle, trying not to repeat what other reviewers have already strongly stated about Spike Lee's \\"Malcolm X.\\"<BR>It's a sweeping, briskly told story, always captivating.<BR>And so don't let my small critiques (NOT criticisms) of the movie make you think this movie is not worth purchasing. Anyone who likes historical-based drama, civil rights-themed films, Denzel Washington, Spike Lee films and/or Malcolm X must buy this.<BR>My critiques are small. Spike Lee could have done without the ending connecting Malcolm X's battles for equality, justice and recognition to Nelson Mandela. While it's somewhat poignant, it doesn't quite work as the film's ending. It might have served better as a separate feature from the movie -- maybe in the middle or at the end of the credits.<BR>And my second critique has to do with historical fact (although I know there are many things it altered and overlooked in the name of making a well-flowing movie). Malcolm X died in the arms of Japanese-American civil rights activist Yuri Kochiyama, not in the arms of his wife, as is shown in the movie. Showing him dying in his wife's arms may have made for a more dramatic, poignant scene, but it's not fact.<BR>But, again, don't let these small critiques turn you away from the film. If its quality could be measured in awards, it would have been the big winner at the typically political, money-based, skewered Academy Awards. Those films the Academy Awards will be forgotten in a matter of years, whereas such films like Malcolm X will still be seen decades from now.
B00005OM4N|5.0|I think this is Britney's best album yet. There is only one slow song (Not A Girl) and all the rest you can dance to and have fun with. If you like to just have fun every now and then this is a great album to own. No party is complete without it.
B00003CXPJ|4.0|I really, really didn't want to see this movie.  I don't think Ben Stiller is that funny, and I didn't think the concept was all that great.  But my wife talked me into it, and I'm glad she did.  All things considered, this movie was very entertaining. <br />Ben Stiller puts on a great performance as Derek Zoolander, and does it well.  He's stupid, but not TOO stupid.  Throw in Owen Wilson (quickly becoming the king of braindead roles) and you have quite the duo.  With a part for Ben's dad and also a role for Will Farrell as the bad guy, you have an good cast that works very well together.<br />Of course, you shouldn't think this movie is going to have a plot, or even a direction of any kind.  Brace yourself for stupid jokes, and corny developments.  But, if this is what you've come to expect in a comedy, you'll definitely not want to miss this one.  I'm glad I didn't.
B00003CXS4|5.0|Guy Ritchie had a hit with \\"Lock, Stock, And Two Smoking Barrels\\" (which didn't agree with me). \\"Snatch,\\" however, is one of my favorite movies and is one of the DVDs that I watch on high rotation. There are a lot of actors you'll recognize including Jason Statham, Alan Ford, Dennis Farina, Vinnie Jones, Benicio Del Toro, and Brad Pitt. <br />The movie takes place in London and involves a huge diamond, a jewel thief with 4 fingers, boxing promoters who are being pressured by an underworld kingpin (who feeds people to pigs), an Irish gypsy who loves his mother, a band of amateur thugs who can't do anything right, and a couple of hired hit men. You'll love the opening sequence of rabbis discussing theology, a Russian assassin that won't die,  the run-away dog that squeaks, and Brad Pitt's gypsy-talk. The dialogue is witty, the bare-knuckle fight scenes are well choreographed, and the gunslinging is exciting. If you enjoyed movies like \\"Ocean's 11,\\" \\"The Big Hit,\\" and \\"The Big Lebowsky,\\" you'll love \\"Snatch.\\"
6305165912|4.0|A millionaire's young wife is supposedly kidnapped. And it just so happens that the millionaire shares the same name with The Dude.  Two thug's break into The Dude's house and ruin his favorite carpet... what can you say? They had the wrong Lebowski. So the dude tries to get his carpet replaced (because it really tied the room together, afterall) and embarks on a wild journey with his paranoid best friend, euro-trash anarchists, an erotic artist, and an eccentric Latino bowler.<br />The story itself is pretty arbitrary... it's the oddball cast of characters that really makes the movie so chraming. It stars Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, Julianne Moore, and Steve Buscemi. The characters are quirky and very loveable. The dialogue is witty but not for the faint of heart. And the DVD comes in both standard and widescreen formats. This is among one of my favorite movies.
B00005JKDR|5.0|I have three children under 4.  My youngest just turned 1, and I think he loves this movie the most!  The kids ask to see this movie daily, and would if I let them watch that much TV.  It really is a great movie for all ages.<br />Very appealing to my 4 yr. old are the games as well.  They did a great job with the second disk, as well as the bonus game disk.  It's a great package, and well worth the price.
B00000K19E|3.0|I heard so much about this movie that I had to try it myself. I liked most of it except for the dumb ending. I also didn't like the fact that in order to get extras - a separate DVD has to be purchased. Disks like this should be boycotted. The special effects are fine, but overloaded (just as said in Amadeus: too many notes). Rent this DVD if you have to, but there's no real reason to buy this one. Wait for one with a different ending (hope there is one on the editing room floor) and more special effects.
B0000214F0|5.0|Parts of this movie look like patches of Porn. Other parts are extremely violent. Don't buy it if your stomach won't bear it or if you live by moral values. Other than that, this is a great movie, with teriffic acting of Mr. McDowell and the rest of the cast. It has some amazing sets and a disturbing story. It will defenitely keep you at the edge of your seat.
B000063UR2|4.0|This movie was mutiliated in it's original release. This DVD makes it justice - it looks wonderful, the story and editing make sence, the acting is also great. For fans of Ridley or this movie - this is a must. For fans of Tom Cruize - this is also a must. Movie addicts should see both versions and see what bad editing can do to a movie. Other viewers should defenitely see it if they can bear fantasies - it's well worth for the wonderful images.<br />P.S. Trekies - note the Dr. from Voyager plays a really surprising role!!

B00006IUL7|5.0|Much as I enjoyed Chris Nolan's \\"Following\\" and \\"Memento\\", he really pulls out all the stops with this third film. I saw the foreign film upon which this was based and, unusually, this is the better film.  (Usually American remakes of foreign films are total schlock but that is not true here.)  It has some key ingredients for achieving this though.  First off, a first rate script that no one has \\"Hollywoodized.\\" Secondly, letting Al Pacino and Robin Williams loose with their talents on first rate material and, in Williams' case, against his usual type, was sheer genius.  The two are absolutely superb together.<br /><br />Pacino is the anti-hero cop who investigates a murder case in Alaska while trying to cope with a partner (Martin Donovan) who is going to turn state's evidence against him when they return to LA.  Not only will this ruin his career but it might also release all the murderers Pacino's character put away in prison. The partners are trying to track down the villain, Williams.  Surprisingly though, instead of running, Williams' villain comes forward and plays with Pacino's character, preying upon his weaknesses.  Pacino is further handicapped by not being able to get any sleep because of a variety of factors but not the least of which is that he's not used to sunlight 24/7 which occurs in Alaska in the warmer weather.  Martin Donovan and Hillary Swank do very good work as the other detectives but it is hard to compare them against the sheer star power and magnetism of Pacino and Williams together. The murder case is actually not as important as the unravelling of these two men's characters.  Buy it.

B000055ZB8|5.0|1922 classic silent vampire film, the first of its kind, by German expressionists. Based on Dracula, this film deals with a man going to the \\"land of the phantoms\\" in Romania, to sell property, to a fellow, who turns out to be a vampire. The Vamp would like to kill his guest, but when he sees his wife, he travels to her town to have her. The scenes are brilliantly shot in black and white, in fearsome surroundings. Heavy shadows, and spooky music play. The camera is always still, it does not move. The acting or overacting is in the style of Expressionism, where all emotions are thrown out to be displayed. Before I sat down to watch this I felt a sense of dread, as I heard how great and terrifying this film is. As it started it got more and more eerier, and scary. I can understand why this film is regarded so high, as it is so entertaining, and captivating. That's quite good, since its in black and white with no sound, and moves at a slow pace. Seriously constructed by all who made this, I can see how it has survived and remained on critic's lists for 80 years, while modern horror films are forgotten after first viewing. Great addition to your library, 5 stars!
B000053V7O|2.0|I liked the first half and the rest does not play on my Grundig machine.
0375701427|5.0|Roth just seems  to get better and better. This is his finest work (along with Sabbath's theatre)--forget the magical realism and the embedded narrative. This book is a unforgiving but poignant meditation on the 60's--which had the patina of exhuberance but as Roth so deeply understands an underlying hurt, a pathology that  wrecked peoples lives--that caused damage that will take years--if ever to get over. I was a participant but I sensed it--the danger--in some inchoate way--at the time. It takes a great writer like Roth to articulate that dementia. Walker Percy sensed it also and wrote about it, but even his fine work (Lancelot for example) cannot match the subtlety the humor and the utter terror that Roth exposes. Be aware that Roth is not exxagerating--he is on the mark. The moral disintegration and the sanctimonious (and just plain old) violence really happened. The book is not a political tract--I am just focusng on that, but he details the period with the precision  of  an historian. He understands the \\"mere anarchy\\" that was the real agenda of the times.<BR>I omit his brilliant language and literary crafsmanship--his understanding of wounded human spirits because that should be obvious. <BR>He is the greatest writer of our times.
B000002I4W|5.0|For jazz, this was what The Velvet Underground and Nico was to rock music (though released 8 years later); it introduced an unknown realm of unconventional experimentation to that genre of music and opened many doors for its followers. Cacophonic, frantic, nice bass lines, melodic, all rolled into one. Ornette Coleman and Don Cherry played off of each other beautifully, and the quartet had quite a chemistry together. <BR><BR>This is where &quot;A Love Supreme&quot; (John Coltrane) came from. This is where &quot;European Son&quot; (VU) came from. And even 40 years later, it is still ahead of its time, and it's still influencing many to explore new territories in music that others are afraid to go into. Ornette Coleman went from having his instrument smashed for not playing convential music, to being a revolutionary force in jazz music.
B000068OSK|1.0|I see a reviewer here compared the guitar work to Rush. This is somewhat misleading, for the following reason: whereas the guitar work in Rush is superb and frequently astounding, the guitar work in White Stripes is absolutely awful, periodically ascending to lousy. So you see the two are not quite as similar as the other reviewer would have you believe.<br />To get down to brass tacks, here's the deal with this recording. This is one of those times where there's a band that everyone has decided is cool, so you, wanting to be hip, purchase their recording. Having had a few listens, you struggle to find some redeeming quality in the music; unfortunately, the stuff is junk. You struggle to suppress the truth and make overblown comments about the &quot;return to rock&quot;, the &quot;gritty rawness&quot; of it all, and so forth. Your buds all make the same sort of crummy, sanctimonious observations, none of you realizing that each secretly knows that it's all lies and the music is no good.<br />Years later you dig it up in a box in your basement and have a good laugh at yourself. Kind of a kick, I guess, but wouldn't you rather keep the cash?
B000002H97|3.0|After releasing 3 of the finest metal albums in history, they made THE BLACK ALBUM. The band's changes are quite obvious: the songs are shorter, and they hired BoB Rock to be their producer which gave the record a more 'commercial' sound. Nothing against it.. but this is an album of contrasting highs and lows.<BR><BR>It certainly starts off good with \\"Enter Sandman\\" and \\"Sad But True,\\" but then falls to a bottom with \\"Holier Than Thou.\\" <BR><BR>\\"The Unforgiven\\" and \\"Wherever I May Roam\\" is then followed by \\"Don't Tread On Me,\\" another bad song. <BR><BR>Other bad songs include \\"the God That Failed,\\" and \\"The Struggle Within.\\" The rest of it is pretty good. <BR><BR>This was their biggest album, but ther are certainly a few songs I can cut from this, and maybe make a pretty good EP out of it. But it only gets worse from here. From here, we would have Reload, S&M, and Lars suing Napster! Leaving the BLACK ALBUM to stand as their last album worthy of any praise.
B000002U8G|5.0|Meddle is really a album of transformation. Echoes is simply classic art rock! They really solidified on this recording. Everyone raves about Dark Side as the classic Pink Floyd work. Actually, to capture all of what Pink Floyd was about from 1967 to 1980, Meddle is the best of the best. Also, the most influencial on musicians of the time. People began to realize a little weirdness can be real art and also sell!
B000003TAR|5.0|Instead of cashing in on \\"Nevermind\\" and releasing a series of knock offs, Nirvana did a 180, and released by far, the most abrasive and volatile album of their short but excellent career. <BR><BR>Kurt, Krist and Dave were overwhelmed about the success they had achieved in a few short years, and they wanted to make a record that went against that. With the help of Steve Albini, probably the most uncommercial producer in the business, they created 41 minutes of anger and reflections. <BR><br />\\"Serve The Servants\\" is a song about Kurt's very troubled family life. (\\"I tried hard to have a father/but instead I had a Dad\\"/\\"That legendary divorce is such a bore\\"). A great opener, and the first chord of roaring distortion sets the tone for the whole record. Rating: A <BR><BR>\\"Scenless Apprentice\\" contains some of the most primal screams, and the most graphic lyrics of Cobain's entire career. Rating: A <BR><BR>\\"Heart Shaped Box\\" is probably the most perverse love song of all time (\\"I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn black\\") nonetheless one of the greatest rock songs of all time. Rating: A+ <BR><BR>\\"Rape Me\\" is the most controversial song on the record, which DOES NOT promote rape. Kurt said that it was about bieng raped and the concept of karma. He said \\"the song is like 'rape me and you'll go to jail and get it 3x worse.'\\" An excellent guitar riff. Rating: A+<BR><BR>\\"Frances Farmer...\\" is definitely about a turmoiled relationship. \\"I miss the comfort in being sad\\" is one of the best lines Kurt ever came up with. Rating: A+<BR><BR>\\"Dumb\\" is probably the sweetest song in Nirvana's catalogue. The cello and the tone of Kurt's voice is a tearjerker. Rating: A+ <BR><BR>\\"Very Ape\\" is an ode to Neanderthals. \\"I take pride as the king of illiterature.\\" Great songs, and realistic about the lives of some of the jocks that bullied people like Kurt in high school. Short (at less than 2 minutes) but great. Rating: A+ <BR><br />\\"Milk It\\" is angry and visceral, and rivals \\"Scentless Apprentice\\" is the heaviest and angriest song on the record. With lyrics like \\"Look on the bright side is suicide,\\" you can tell that Kurt was one angry person. Strangely prophetic too. Rating: A+ <BR><BR>\\"Pennyroyal Tea\\" is a relic dating back to the Nevermind sessions. Great song with a melodic sense. Rating: A<BR><BR>\\"Radio Friendly Unit Shifer\\" is a bunch of feedback and interesting imagery.. it's pretty cool. Rating: A-<BR><BR>\\"tourette's\\" is just 95 seconds of Kurt screaming about god knows what. Great to listen to when those moments of frustration just come at you like a tidal wave. Rating: A <BR><BR>\\"All Apologies\\" is a perfect way to end the album. A heartfelt song, but rather disturbing at the same time, because some of the lyrics do foreshadow Kurt's suicide. <BR><BR>I think it's Nirvana's best album, and also a heartbreaking album which makes it hard to listen to sometimes. Nirvana definitely ended their album cycle with some great music.
B000002N2Z|5.0|I'm not trying to put down their newer stuff, but it seems less exciting and more repetive and with a few exceptions I don't like repetive music. This is and incredible album though the songs have great riffs which while they aren't very technical or anything they are usually very interesting. All the songs are great and are worthy of many multiple listens. If you like heavy music of any kind you should own this album.
0671775308|4.0|The Millionaire Next Door explains how anyone can become a millionaire. This book was very informative and had many interesting points, however it stated these points numerous times and as a result was a little boring. Reading this book at a young age allows those readers to control their finances as Stanley and Danko instruct, thus being able to retire comfortable and without worries. Basically an interesting and informative book that gets a little repetitive.

630018403X|5.0|'The Breakfast Club' changed the way a movie could be presented. <BR>Think about the plot, 5 different high school kid's: The punk, The jock, The nerd, The princess, and The essentric; all in detention together, sounds pretty boring on paper. But once you have seen the movie, you want to see it 1000 times, and each time you realize why you love this movie even more, it never gets old. <br />I am only 16 years old, and I have seen this movie 10+ times over the span of 3-4 years. The first tiem I saw this film, I thought it was alright. But as I got more into it, it became something that I get estatic every time I see it.
B0000640VN|3.0|This would be at the top of the list.  I have a feeling that the &quot;hook&quot; of the movie was that it's another Meg Ryan rom-com, but aside from that, it is actually a pleasant movie.  Sure, the plot has some holes--if you looked up &quot;suspension of disbelief,&quot; this movie would be listed--but has some truly romantic and humorous parts.  Ryan repeats her usual act; Jackman is great (and the REAL reason that women watch this movie), and so is the rest of the supporting cast.  <br />What's interesting, though, is how thoughtfully the movie was directed.  You can see signs throughout the movie that show that although the plot may be off, the movie itself is very well made.  I won't list all the little touches here and there, but the observant viewer will get a kick from them.  All in all, as a movie, this is far better than it should be.

6300271439|5.0|This isn't a thinking movie.  I'm wondering if all the one star ratings on this site are from the philosopher people that has to analyze every speck of the movie?  This isn't an analyzing movie.  This is just one of those fun 80s flicks.  <br />As the critics say, Madonna isn't much of an actress.  Out of all of the movies she's starred in, the only two that I like is &quot;Who's that Girl&quot; and &quot;Desperately Seeking Susan&quot;.  Madonna and Griffin had excellent chemistry.  It's just a fun movie.  If you are a Madonna fan, you'll like it.  If you aren't a Madonna fan than just skip the movie.  <br />Like I said, don't analyze the film too much.  If you analyze it too much than you'll probably think it's a dumb movie.  Just sit back and watch it.  I guarantee you'll love it.
B000000OUJ|5.0|This cd has definitely spend the most time in my cd player, than any other album that I own.  GZA is in his prime, and that's scary considering how ill he is today.  This is proof that GZA is a lyrical genius, and the beats are also off the hook (credit to the RZA).  I would recommend this to anyone who considers themself to be a true hip hop fan.  It's without a doubt, a classic.  Some tracks to mention are Killa Hills 10304, Cold World, Investigative Reports, Shadowboxing, 4th chamber, Duel of the iron mic, and Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth.  Anyone notice how &quot;BIBLE&quot; is spelled out there? Simply amazing...
B00005BCK6|5.0|Volume 25 of the Star Trek DVD collection has two great episodes from the second season.  Although season 1 of Star Trek was far more diverse and fresh, season 2 just happend to spawn some of the series most classic and memorable episodes.  This DVD contains just two of these great episodes.<br />A PIECE OF THE ACTION may very well be one of the top five most popular episodes of the original series.  The Enterpirse crew arrives at Sigma Iotia II to find a civilization similar to the Chicago Mobs of the 1920's.  The planet itself has been divided by gang wars and Kirk feels he must reunite the planet so it can have good relation with the Federation.  Kirk resorts to him and Mr. Spock donning mobster gear and talking in slang which leads to A PIECE OF THE ACTION being one of the funniest Star Trek episodes.  The episode itslef is quite good and very entertaining especially Kirk driving the old jalopy, the card game and Spock acting like a gangster.  However the episode wraps up unevenly and it really makes you think: Kirk completely disobeyed the Prime Directive in this episode! However this episode doesn't fail to please and the end left this plot open for a sequel.  Unfortunetly it has never been produced.  A PIECE OF THE ACTION is an excellent episode of Star Trek though.<br />BY ANY OTHER NAME may be one of the strangest episodes of Star Trek ever!  Kirk and the crew are abducted by Kelvans who take on a human form.  The Kelvans demand control of The Enterprise so they can take a voyage to find a planet suitable for colonzation since there own ship was destroyed.  The Kelvans are so ruthless they even go to the extent to killing an innocent enterprise crew member to get what they want.  This makes BY ANY OTHER NAME seems like a serious episode that is until the crew discovers the Kelvans weakness: human sense and emotion.  This results in Kirk flirting with the beautiful Kelinda, Spock making Rojan feel jealousy, and Scotty getting himself and another Kelvan drunk.  This results in BY ANY OTHER NAME to be a comical episode of Star Trek but it's strange how the mood changes.  The first half hour is somewhat dark whereas the second half hour is bright and funny.  The episode ends with The Kelvans making peace with the Federation even after the death of a crewmate.  BY ANY OTHER NAME is an uneven but above average episode of Star Trek.   <br />In conclusion I highly recommend this DVD for it does have twoo great episodes.  The picture and quality are fine too!  Highly recommended!
B00004XPOZ|5.0|When ep 2 came out,they reissued the pan/scan VHS of the orginal trilogy (special edition) but NOT THE WIDESCREEN casette (at that time).<BR> Although a DVD may be less then a year away,there should  be a way for folks to watch the orginal trilogy the way it was intended to be seen! in the ORGINAL ASPECT RATIO!

0345442970|4.0|I have to admit, I only bought this book to complete my SW collection. In fact, I almost didn't, because of the cheesy annoying cover, but boy, am I now glad that I did..<br />Prequels are not an easy thing. After all, your audience pretty much knows the ending; so how do you keep them interested? <BR>Well, in this case, J Luceno did it with superb characterisations and the most wonderfully layered plot since.. well, ever. (at least in the SW novels).<br />If you 've seen The Phantom Menace, you probably walked out with as many questions as I did. Everything in that movie was happening more or less in a vacuum. Well, Cloak of Deception will answer your every question. In that alone, this book is worth four stars. It doesn't only lay the groundwork for everything that happens in the SW Universe afterwards, it does so rationally and creatively. Episode I makes sense to me now!<br />What makes it so gratifying though, is that Luceno does not pull a W. Williams and Destiny's Way fiasco. He does not sacrifice the people for the storyline. The Cloak's characters (Palpatine, Vallorum, the Jedi, the Neimoidians) made so much sense. Their motives, their methods, their reactions felt totally right, every step of the way. Even the cameos, like for example Tarkin, were bang on.<br />But in the end, Star Wars Universe notwithstanding, this novel stands out all by itself, by virtue of an inventive, complex plot, that keeps you guessing right to the end. Not since Asimov's Foundation Series, have I read SciFi with such sweeping political intrigue, down to the last bit of dialogue and interplanetary politicking.<br />Definatelly worth the read, even if you are not a SW fan.
0671004611|1.0|Senator Strom Thurmond wrote the original forward to The Day After Roswell-- only to have it removed. Thurmond was under the impression that Corso's book was autobiographical. The book was supposed to be titled \\"I Walked With Giants: My Career in Military Intelligence\\". Which is certainly not the same as Roswell.<br />This seemed like a ploy by Corso or Birnes to make the story seem authentic. (Disinformation?) Very slick. However, the UFO community mainly dismisses Corso as a fraud... for too many reasons I won't go into.<br />A better account is \\"The Roswell UFO Crash: What They Don't Want You to Know\\" by Kal Korff.

B00006IUL7|4.0|The fascinating psychological thriller \\"Insomnia\\" is a remake of an excellent Norwegian movie released about five years ago. In large part, it succeeds in improving upon the original because it fleshes out the relationship between the main character and the killer he is pursuing.<br />Detective Will Dormer [Al Pacino] and his partner are dispatched to the far reaches of Alaska to help investigate the grisly murder of a young woman. Internal Affairs has them under investigation back in Los Angeles, and their trip seems to be part of a plan to get them out of the way for awhile. With the help of local detective Ellie Burr [Hilary Swank], the investigation starts out well, but soon Dormer is plagued by insomnia triggered by the lack of darkness during the Alaskan summer. After a couple of days, fatigue sets in, and he begins to falter. The situation gets much worse after a dreadful accident occurs during a stakeout. It isn't long before the killer [Robin Williams] begins to play a deadly cat and mouse game with him. [Note: Saying who plays the killer gives almost nothing of the plot away.]<br />The cast is uniformly excellent. Director Christopher Nolan, whose last film was the highly original thriller \\"Memento\\", again takes on the tricky concept of time. In this case, Dormer's insomnia causes him to lose track of time in a palce where there is no night. In the process, he also loses track of himself.<br />\\"Insomnia\\"s main theme is moral ambiguity, and Dormer's not knowing whether it's day or night serves to underscores that theme. [Everything is relative.] This is a sophisticated thriller for adults. Its few action scenes seem almost beside the point, as if they were placed there as an afterthought to make the movie more appealing to mainstream audiences.
B00005JKDR|5.0|My twins LOVE this movie. They ask to watch &quot;Boo and Kitty&quot; every chance they get. My 5 year old niece and 2 year old nephew love it too! Definitely a must have for kids, between you and me I think it's pretty cute too ;)
1585471488|5.0|I am digusted with the meanness of some of these reviews.<BR>Although this identifies me as a naive and simpleminded reader, I must admit that I found the book impossible to put down, and speed read it in about four hours.  The plot concerns a money hungry student who attempts to marry three sisters in succession, all of whom stand to inherit a lot of money.  Because of some plot complications however, our protagonist is forced to murder two of the sisters.  He is caught and gruesomely punished however before being able to marry and kill the third sister.  (Sorry if this gives away a little of the plot.)
630289915X|5.0|This is a classic in itself directed by Frank Capra starring James Stewart and Donna Reed.  This film was once thought of as a flop, but it bounced back and beyond anyone's wildest imagination.  James Stewart as George Bailey performs superbly in one of his most infamous roles.  This movie is watched over and over by millions especially during the holiday season.  It delivers a message of hope, romance, humor, failure and success.  There aren't too many films out there that touch on so many emotions successfully. The movie reveals life's ups and downs, personal struggles and triumphs.  This is a great movie, if you have never seen it, I recommend you watch it this winter.
B0000214F0|5.0|I have never seen a movie that has both aroused me and repulsed me simultaneously (well, with different scenes).  Alternately, there is some of the most erotic sex I've ever seen captured on film juxtaposed with some of the most graphic violence I've seen outside of an unrated slasher movie, usually inflicted on genitalia.  There is also a huge amount of callous brutality, especially towards the end of the movie, which is absolutely accurate as to how the Romans behaved (the strong destroying the weak).  Some VERY beautiful girls (and well endowed males, for you ladies) appear in the sex and orgy scenes, no names you'll recognize (aside from the stars, who insisted that they did not know the film was to be sexually explicit), but I doubt you'll care.<BR>If you like erotica, buy this film.  I sure will.
0767817478|5.0|... except this guy can MOVE! There's no use comparing it to the Japanese \\"Godzilla\\" movies, even \\"Godzilla 2000\\", because it's not anyways near the same. People get hung up on comparing things to the original (or the book, if there was one), and that seems to color their judgement way too much. This lizard was CGI slick, smart, funny and could actually make facial expressions. Most of the destruction was done by the Air Force jets trying to kill it, which I personally thought was the most hilarious part. Love it or not, this movie remains the most realistic 'giant monster run amok in a big city' movie ever made.
B00004ZDVQ|5.0|They are: &quot;Ribbon in the Sky&quot; and &quot;Do I Do&quot;.<br />And that does not lessen the value of the remaining selections.

B00006F7S4|4.0|I adore Beck so I am biased to begin with. That being said, I love this CD.  Is it as good as 'Mutations'? Well, no but that is because it's different...it's melancholy all the way through without any quirky rhymes or instrumentations.  Initially, I wasn't too sure about this but after a couple of spins it grew on me.<br />Don't get me wrong though, it's still Beck.  For those of you who have listened to him through the years/phases, this won't surprise you at all as he has a tendency to shift gears rapidly from one CD to the next.  This is about as far away from &quot;Midnite Vultures&quot; as you can possibly get.  <br />As with all of his CD's he is sticking with a genre, 'Odelay' was heavy on 60's sound, 'Mutations' country/folk, Midnite Vultures 80's synth with a dash of funk  and 'Sea Change' is well, humm...folk meets 70's lite meets the Cure, meets The Smiths, kind of..hard to describe really but worth the effort.
6302862949|1.0|I guess Baryshnikov was trying to switch from the world of Ballet to the world of Hollywood movies with this effort. But then everyone realised that all he could play was surly, prima donna Russian ballet-dancers, so they had to put the rest of his career on ice. I would at least have liked to se him make an appearance as a ballet-kicking bad guy in one of the 80s Bond movies. Unless you take your ballet very seriously or have got a thing about bulges in tights, this movie will come over as a load of dated, Cold War ballet hoo.
0385335482|4.0|I liked Confessions of a Shopaholic, not because I found it exceptionally funny, but it told the story of a girl we can all relate to on some level.  The writing was never jejune and suspenseful enough to keep you interested.  The author created her as someone we could all feel sympathetic for, thus we all root for her in the end.<br />This novel stars Rebecca (Becky, Bex) as its protagonist and the deemed &quot;shopaholic.&quot;  I enjoyed reading about her job as a financial journalist, however at some parts I found myself questioning it.  It's a little hard to believe that a girl so easily persuaded and irresponsible ever managed to pull through college and get hired.<br />At some points I also found myself feeling sorry for poor Mark Smeathe of Endwich Bank, who had to endure Becky's endless games.  However, had she faced up to the predicament she got herself into, this would have been one short book.  Another questions raised in the back of my mind was the motivation for her excessive spending, and I think Sophie Kinsella could have gone with that a little bit.  However, all things considered I thoroughly enjoyed this book, although I wouldn't recommend it to any man, ever.
6304712499|3.0|Todd McFarlane began the 'Spawn' comic series in 1992.  The series went on to set records for comic sales.  My own personal knowledge of 'Spawn' comes from the large number of imaginative action figures that appear on many toy and comic store shelves.  I have bought and set up several, and I decided to see the film to get some insight into the story behind the figures.<br />The film starts like a buzz saw.  You are dumped right into the life of secret agent/assassin Al Simmons (Michael Jai White) as he destroys a planeload of people, realizes what he had done, and tries to leave the agency for whom he worked.  Needless to say, his evil boss Jason Wynn (Martin Sheen) has no intention of letting him go.  Wynn tricks Simmons into one 'last' assignment.  It's a setup, and Simmons is toasted for real.<br />Suddenly (everything is sudden in this film) it is five years later.  Simmons pops back into existence, looking like the aftermath of a nuclear explosion, with a severe memory shortage.  A really gross clown (John Leguizamo) keeps trying to be his buddy, his best friend has married his girlfriend, and the only thing that remembers him is his dog - Spaz (I don't know who played the dog).  This is a situation that can only get worse, and sure enough, that's what it does.<br />The basic plot turns on Simmons' (now called Spawn) moral progress.  Hell has been tempting souls all over the world in order to create an army of badness.  Now they want Spawn to be the general of that army and lead the last apocalyptic attack on heaven.  In order to qualify, that have to play on Spawn's anger and thirst for vengeance until he does something so bad that he loses all his humanity.  Of course, this involves killing most of the people in the world.  Cogliostro (Nicol Williamson) plays the good guy, trying to help Spawn keep his humanity.<br />My immediate problem with 'Spawn' was that it was not 'Blade.'  It took me the first 15 minutes of the film to get over that.  I think this was really a matter of seeing 'Blade' just before viewing 'Spawn.'  Once I was able to get into the movie a bit, I found that my original reaction was overkill.  Even so, most of the script is people morphing into things that kill and then smashing other people into smithereens.  Yes, there is a plot, but its primary purpose is to provide an excuse for a steady procession of outrageous (but bloodless) violence.  Exactly how it managed to hold on to a PG-13 rating is beyond me.  'Blade' had an element of style that is simply lacking in 'Spawn.'<br />The cast consists of many skilled and experienced players (Martin Sheen's film credits are probably longer than the script).  Unfortunately, the pace is so intense that the only character you get to know well is that godforsaken clown, and you will really wish that you hadn't.  Most of the other characters are limited to parts that are heavily typecast.  Despite this, 'Spawn' is almost a very good film.  Many of the special effects are great, and there certainly isn't anything wrong with a lot of fast-paced action.  However, the story never completely gripped me, and the film work is a bit too claustrophobic.  Still, it's worth seeing if you get a chance.really a matter of seeing 'Blade' just before viewing 'Spawn.'

B00006F7S4|5.0|Very rarely have I bought an album from listening to it for free. You know what I mean -- those stores that allow customers to preview CD's. But this was the first time I bought an album from listening to the first sentence of the first song. I knew I had to have this one; the mood and the atmosphere are dead-on perfect. Yes, Sea Change is sad, moody, even depressing. It's also nothing short of brilliant.<br />This is the perfect road companion while driving, the mood-setter for a date, the background to a California sunrise. Listening to Beck lament about love lost, gained, and lost again, over subtle guitar licks and orchestral movements, the listener can't help but take a deep breath, relate, and move on to the next track. This is not Odelay nor the self-conscious Midnight Vultures. This is as bare and naked as you will ever hear an artist get, and it's simply breathtaking.
0767817478|2.0|I have a feeling that Godzilla is going to fall into the same camp of \\"cinema non grata\\" as ID4, for films is based in Manhattan which revel in the spectular demolition of iconic buildings are going to be in questionable taste for some time yet, even if released well before September 2001. In this case we even have a self-agrandising mayor, a pending election campaign and frequent references to \\"ground zero\\" (in this case the monster's lair).<br />But they're the only points of interest in this very silly movie, which would have you believe that there are vast, cathedral like expanses of space below New York City in which a nuclear-contaminated, mutant, hermaphrodite dinosaur (courtesy of French nuclear testing at Mururoa, of course) is brooding.<br />Suggested tag line: \\"When New York city is terrorised by a big fat dinosaur, there's only Matthew Broderick between hope and oblivion!\\"<br />An extra star, maybe, for casting the French as villains for once (the Brits will love that), and for the French SAS man's excellent Elvis impersonation, with which he foxed a gormless sentry guard at the critical moment in order to help save the day.

0671646788|5.0|It is always shady when you see someone using the usual cliché \\"This book has changed my life!\\". While I usually don't <BR>take those comments seriously (too much money wasted in 'life-changing' books, I guess) I have to admit that sometimes<BR>a particular book hits you with more impact than usual and after a couple of years some self-examination might leave you<BR>with the impression that perhaps the author has indeed influenced your choice of paths more than you would have expected.<br />This was the case with me and Dr. Schwartz's \\"Magic\\". I am not an intense fan of self-help and motivational literature, <BR>but do read a title or two now and then. I have read many of the classics like Dale Carnegie's books (almost all), Napoleon Hill's \\"Think and grow rich\\", Covey's \\"The 7 habits of highly successful people\\" and others like \\"How to be a start at work\\", <BR>\\"The power of positive thinking\\",Psychocybernetics\\" and many more that have sold millions, are mentioned everywhere and everybody seems to love. <br />Maltz, Hill, the list goes on. The fact it that so far no book of this kind has proven to be as effective with me as this one. I<BR>even felt I have wasted too much money. Not the case with this particular book. This is the kind of title where you read things you already know, you are after all mostly just looking for motivation. That extra push to get you going in particular moments when things aren't flowing as easily as you'd wish. And for that use, my preference goes to books that have an honest simplicity. This title isn't verbose, it isn't very technical or full or scholarship, perhaps even some of its examples are fully fictional. The truth is that I don't care about that, because it has proven very effective.<br />If you are looking for something to motivate you (in any area), I suggest you try this title first. The effect with you might be quite different. <BR>Perhaps Napoleon Hill's style suits you better (I truly disliked his books) or maybe some other author. But to many of us, Schwart'z approach is perfect. I first read this over a year ago, and can now look back and see certain aspects that were definitely made easier because if it. Overall, the only thing I regret is not having found this title much sooner in my life (I'm 27), but it will no doubt still prove useful for many years. <br />As a side recommendation, I suggest you combine this with the autobiography of Benjamin Franklin, or the more accessible \\"The Art of Virtue\\" also based on Franklin's words, Dale Carnegie and as much wisdom and self-examination as you can come up with. The results won't be magic, but I'm pretty sure the improvement will be easy to notice.
B000002AZ8|5.0|\\"Vitalogy\\" is, by far and away, Pearl Jam's best record to date.  True, not every song therein is crafty perfection.  But it's the album's entirety that really shines through.  An interesting concept album marking both the poignancies and idiocies of modern culture, \\"Vitalogy\\" really breathes in listening from start to finish.<br />The new directions and styles experimented with by the band on this record have been unfairly criticized by some Pearl Jam fans.  After all, how can a band creatively progress without such experimentation?  (Case in point, Radiohead's \\"OK Computer\\")  Though \\"Vs.\\" was a great album - and another one of the band's high points - one more guitar-anchored album and Pearl Jam might have drilled themselves into a hole.  And they knew it.  Songs such as \\"Bugs\\", a suprisingly humorous slant from an otherwise melodramatic group, and \\"Aye Davanita\\", a sweetly eastern-flavored hymn, were a breath of fresh air in the dingy corners of grunge in the mid-90s.  \\"Hey Sexymophandlemomma\\" is a track like no other; a seemingly inspired homage to the Beatles' \\"Revolution 9\\" (a sharp revolution that has yet to catch on).  These new directions for Pearl Jam, along with \\"Vitalogy's\\" acompanying eerie booklet, are what set them apart from other voiceless grunge bands of their time.  <br />What also stands out about this record is fact that the properly crafted songs on \\"Vitalogy\\" are some of the band's best.  \\"Corduroy\\", \\"Better Man\\", \\"Nothingman\\" and \\"Immortality\\" are golden.  Beautiful lyrics and melodies combined with interesting chord progressions and guitar licks abound.  The primary phrasing of \\"Tremors Christ\\" seems elementary, yet is simultaneously complex.  Repetitiveness gives way to dynamic in \\"Not For You\\".  And \\"Spin the Black Circle\\" is just flat-out rock n' roll fun.<br />\\"Vitalogy's\\" one and only downfall is the lull in it's middle.  Though \\"Whipping\\" - like almost any Pearl Jam song - blares solid lyrics and theme, it simply sounds awkward after the touching \\"Nothingman\\".  And though in \\"Pry, to\\" lies a point that Vedder yearns to get across, it really ends up as the throw-away transition to the record's second half.<br />Lyrical highlights include \\"Satan's Bed\\", \\"Not For You\\" and \\"Immortality\\".  Shining melodies grace almost every track on the album.  And there is the sense in each song that your are connecting with an important message.  (Even in \\"Bugs\\", which may or may not have social themes.)  The booklet alone could be the band's grandest statement, containing alarming past cultural morals and images.  From beginning to end, \\"Vitalogy\\" is Pearl Jam's greatest achievement, both musically and artistically.  If you didn't like it the first time, give it some time to grow on you.  Few rock albums of the 1990's will have as much vitalogy.
B00005R24G|4.0|1972's Sleuth is literally a two-man show, with Olivier and Caine matching each other scene for scene in this lengthy 2-hour, 18-minute story revolving around some rather unusual parlor games.<br /><br />It's a pleasure to watch these two actors at work (or is it \\"play\\"?).  I've never enjoyed Mr. Caine more.<br /><br />It's quite unusual to see a movie with the entire cast comprising just two people! (Well, for the most part we see just the two leads at any rate.)  And each of these standout \\"leads\\" does a bloody good job of holding our interest till the end.<br /><br />I would certainly recommend this top-notch tongue-in-cheek murder mystery.
0517189542|5.0|When people ask me how I became such an avid reader, my answer is because I read Little Women in High School.  This timeless classic of four sister growing up during the Civil War is my all time favorite book and I do not even know how many times I have read it. I treasure my copy of this book and it is one I could never part with.  <br />Little Women is a coming of age story about four sisters Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy, and it always amazed me how Marmee would sit back and let them learn life's lessons and always find the right words to say to each of them afterward.  Family values and morals as well are hard lessons to teach but through love and understanding they all learn.<br />Jo is my favorite character, she is so vibrant and full of life and the character based on Louisa May Alcott herself.  My favorite movie version of this movie is the 1933 version with Katherine Hepburn as Jo, she truly captured Jo's spirit.  <br />This story has been read by many generations and I'm sure that there will be many more generations enjoying the story of Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy for many many years to come.
B0000026VZ|3.0|This collection definitely caters to the pop and Toto IV fans.  Toto could really rock and Steve Lukather is one of the best guitar players around.  I would like to have seen a better variety of songs and inclusion of some old FM rockers.  You can do a better job piecing together your own &quot;Best of&quot; collection from their first 3 albums and their 5th album.  Some great Toto songs are missing including: I'll Supply the Love, Rockmaker, Hydra, St. George and the Dragon, Gift with a Golden Gun, Think I Could Stand You Forever, English Eyes, Stranger in Town.
B00006DEFA|4.0|It is always very funny to see a Masterpiece made out of historical distortions.<br />I know that Peter Schaffer meant well by writing a play about the competition between Salieri and Mozart.<br />Unfortunately, history found Salieri far more successful in Austria and abroad than Mozart at that time.<br />Salieri was the \\"talk of the town\\", NOT Mozart...<br />So why is it that all of a sudden Salieri should become immensely jealous of Mozart and even go as far as to murder him for his music, if it should have been quite the opposite?<br />Schaffer needed a conflict situation in which to set his own Drama and add a scapegoat for the tragic death of the \\"brat\\".<br />This scapegoat happened to be Salieri.<br />Very good for someone who has never studied history of music, but what about historical accuracy? Goodbye and farewell...<br />Of all the enemies that Mozart made throughout his lifetime, Salieri should have been considered the less threatening of them all. He certainly didn't need it.<br />What about, instead, the many \\"close\\" friends, who flocked to Mozart's feasts/orgies?<br />Many of them were totally untalented musicians, eager to be \\"seen\\" with Mozart in order to even just be considered as such.<br />Couldn't one of them have had a secret wish to murder him, in order to steal his work and resell it for profit?<br />That would have been a true motivation for murder.<br />Instead we have a whimpering Salieri, who almost seems to be sexually attracted to the young Mozart and in a frenzy of jealousy, not only indirectly murders Mozart, by inciting him to \\"work harder\\" while the composer lies in bed feverish, but ultimately also attempts to committ suicide like a woman abandoned by her lover.<br />C'mon, not everybody is gay in this world! Let's get real for once.<br />Salieri who was Venetian by birth, exactly like Vivaldi, was a highly celebrated Court composer and beloved and envied for his position by everybody. Not only this, but he also had followers of his style throughout Europe.<br />Could a man like this really care about a newcomer like Mozart. Not really, especially because Mozart's music was only appreciated in France and in some remote corners of Germany. His popularity in those days was just limited by the fact, that he was an \\"Enfant prodige\\" and as such, more a Circus attraction than anything else.<br />His music was \\"tolerated\\" at best.<br />Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart became only famous after his death and not even immediately afterwards.<br />It took people like Schubert and Mendelssohn-Bartholdy, almost three decades later, to revive the interest in the composer's works and even then they didn't come through as masterpieces.<br />Beethoven was still far more popular in people's ears than Mozart.<br />Finally, and only after many following attempts by various parties to revive his music, did Amadeus' music make it in the \\"charts\\".<br />Almost a Century in fact, had past since the Maestro died and only now was his style truly admired and understood.<br />\\"Amadeus\\" is a totally fictionalized tale that may have some symbolism in it, but that's all it is.<br />I understand artistic licence to a point, but then my ethical instinct kicks in, and revulsion and rebellion sets in.<br />Like in \\"Immortal Beloved\\", a piece of [junk] unworthy of any true \\"follower\\" of Beethoven, this is totally unworthy of any true connaisseur of Master Mozart or even Master Salieri.<br />Hollywood will naturally praise its so-called \\"works of art\\", but only a completely illiterate [person] would agree with them.<br />Hollywood has never produced any true Culture, just pure hype and Entertainment, just like young Mozart loved to do and in so far, this movie may be a mirror depiction of what Hollywood is all about: superficiality and no substance.<br />If you like this kind of spectacle, then you're more than well served in this, otherwise very well-done, filmed version of an abstract, almost surrealistic and totally unbelievable tale of two musicians who loved to hate each other (when would they ever have found the time to compose anything with so much mayhem?).<br />If instead, you are like me, a person with common sense and respect for \\"true\\" and well-written Biographies and History, then you will either take it as a purely \\"amazing stories\\" episode, a bit overstreched maybe, but watchable, or you will keep your fingers away of this one and go on listening directly to Mozart's or Salieri's music and make the necessary comparisons. You will be much better informed and immensely appreciate the intensity of both Composers.<br />I only would wish, just once in my lifetime, that a director or a writer could come up with a faithful Biography of such  talented musicians.<br />I am a director and an actor myself and truly believe that such endeavor is still feasable, but certainly not through the intrusion of Hollywood or Broadway producers, who only care about making a fast buck with anything they touch.<br />Art is Art, Culture is Culture, History is History and making money is totally another game...ould they ever have found the time to compose anything with so much mayhem?).<br />If instead, you are like me, a person with common sense and respect for \\"true\\" and well-written Biographies and History, then you will either take it as a purely \\"amazing stories\\" episode, a bit overstreched maybe, but watchable, or you will keep your fingers away of this one and go on listening directly to Mozart's or Salieri's music and make the necessary comparisons.

B0000542DJ|5.0|I have always been a little bit interested in why and how JFK was assassinated, and especially with who killed JFK.  I saw this film when it first came out, but it was so controversial then that many people sought to debunk it.  Like Orson Welles's &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; (Okay - it's good, but not THAT good.) JFK, and its director Oliver Stone was subjected to incredible criticism.  Now that time has borne out Jim Garrison's version of events, JFK is even more accurate than originally thought.<br />The directors cut, along with the deleted scenes, has Oliver Stone admitting that he was playing a little fast and loose with the facts, but in a more conservative direction most of the time.  In other words, he downplayed some things that he believed to be true but could not adequately document.  The extra disk with an update on the Garrison version, and the interview with the mysterious Mr. X is priceless.<br />Be careful.  If you buy this DVD (and watch it, of course) you will never look at our government in the same way again.
B00004STW4|5.0|This film satisfies on so many levels. As about 100+ reviewers before me have commented, it's a really great spoof on those campy films of the 50's which I grew up on. However, it's also a truly magnificent social comment on how various strata of our society respond to crisis. Peace-freak types are ready to embrace the invaders, the academician assumes because they are technologically advanced, they come with benevolent intent and the governing bodies look to him for advice. The military types assume malevolent intent as a sort of knee-jerk reaction. The president assures the public \\"all is well' even though it isn't and tells them to go about their lives. The President and First Lady sit gulping their dinner(like the rest of us) while watching the glitzy newslady with the brain of an ambitious 6 year-old. The White House press secretary advises the Pres on various photo-ops. I could go on and on. This film is not only about 50's sci-fi flicks just as \\"Gulliver's Travels\\" was also not only a unique tale for children in its day. One only need to look at the current situation we find ourselves in with destructive forces from the Middle East to see the corresponding elements in this film. It not only satisfied the graying ex-English major in me but it is damn good fun. Brilliant but apparently misunderstood.
